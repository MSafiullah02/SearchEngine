However, there is a lack of effective antiviral agents for many coronavirus strains. Naturally existing compounds provide a wealth of chemical diversity, including antiviral activity, and thus may have utility as therapeutic agents against coronaviral infections. The PubMed database was searched for papers including the keywords coronavirus, SARS or MERS, as well as traditional medicine, herbal, remedy or plants, with 55 primary research articles identified. The overwhelming majority of publications focussed on polar compounds. Compounds that show promise for the inhibition of coronavirus in humans include scutellarein, silvestrol, tryptanthrin, saikosaponin B2, quercetin, myricetin, caffeic acid, psoralidin, isobavachalcone, and lectins such as griffithsin. Other compounds such as lycorine may be suitable if a therapeutic level of antiviral activity can be achieved without exceeding toxic plasma concentrations. It was noted that the most promising small molecules identified as coronavirus inhibitors contained a conjugated fused ring structure with the majority being classified as being polyphenols.",

Based on their genotypic and serological characteristics, the viruses are subdivided into four genera: Alpha-, Beta-, Gamma-, and Deltacoronavirus (Chu et al., 2020; Lu et al., 2015) . At present, all identified CoVs that are capable of infecting humans belong to the first two genera. These include the alphacoronaviruses (\u03b1CoVs) HCoV-NL63 (Human CoV-NL63) and HCoV-229E and the betacoronaviruses (\u03b2CoVs) HCoV-OC43 (Human CoV-OC43), HKU1 (Human CoV), SARS-CoV (Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome CoV), and MERS-CoV (Middle Eastern Respiratory Syndrome CoV) (Lu et al., 2015) .

The S proteins interact directly with human angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) 2, allowing the virus to enter the cells. At present, no preventive vaccines or established antiviral therapies are available for coronaviruses (Sohrabi et al., 2020) . However, several synthetic compounds have shown promise, including hydroxychloroquine and choloroquine phosphate (Cortegiani et al., 2020; Gao et al., 2020) , which act through several mechanisms, including alkalisation of the host cell phagolysosomes. Newer antiviral medications such as lopinavir (Yao et al., 2020) , remdesivir (Holshue et al., 2020; Wang et al., 2020) , and arbidol (Khamitov et al., 2008) also show promise.

            "text": "In addition, traditional herbal medicines and purified natural products may guide the development of novel antiviral drugs. In other words, more efficient drugs can often be designed based on the structure of natural compounds that exhibit the desired activity. Classic examples of this drug discovery pathway include emetine, an isoquinoline alkaloid isolated from Cephaelis ipecacuanha and used as an amoebicidal drug; quinine, derived from the bark of Cinchona trees; and numerous other drugs modified from natural compounds, such aspirin, morphine and paclitaxel, an antineoplastic drug used for the treatment of cancer (Ganjhu et al., 2015) . Indeed, half of all drugs approved between 1981 and 2014 were derived from or mimicked a natural compound (Newman and Cragg, 2016) . Furthermore, in the current outbreak of COVID-19, many patients appear to be turning to complementary or traditional medicinal therapies, albeit using them almost exclusively in conjunction with western medicine. For example, one study suggested that almost 92 % of 135 hospitalised patients in northeast Chonqing (China) received traditional Chinese medicine in addition to western medicine . However, based on the many studies conducted on this topic, it is hard to separate the potential effects of, and interaction between, traditional Chinese herbal medicine and western medicine. Recent reviews have suggested that traditional Chinese medicine could be used for the prevention or treatment (Yang et al., 2020a ) of COVID-19; while still acknowledging that many studies involving clinical trials are poorly designed or controlled, and the choice of treatments is largely empirically based. As previous work has highlighted the potential of traditional Chinese medicines as a source of potential novel drugs (Ling, 2020) , we have not included details on such studies investigating the antiviral activity of remedies comprising portions of numerous plant species in this review. Rather, our aim is to collate data on the broad spectrum of natural phytochemicals from individual plant species that may have therapeutic potential.",

Papers primarily focussed on the antiviral activity of prepared Chinese traditional medicines, which typically comprise multiple plant species, were considered out of scope of this review. All articles up to and including 25 March 2020 were considered, yielding a total of 659 results. Two of the authors independently screened the results and identified relevant articles, yielding a total of 35 primary articles on human coronaviruses and 22 on animal coronaviruses were found to be pertinent and thus included in this review (total = 58 papers). Of these, two papers (6%) were on SARS- . The majority of studies on human coronaviruses (69%; n=24) included SARS-CoV, with only 3 (9%) including MERS-CoV and 8 (23%) other human coronaviruses. It should be noted that one study included both SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV (O'Keefe et al., 2010) while another included both MERS-CoV and HCoV-229E (M\u00fcller et al., 2018) , hence these percentages do not add to 100%. Table 1 summarises the studies reporting the inhibition of various human coronavirus strains using compounds derived from plant sources. The table is arranged by viral strain in order to better compare the bioactivity of compounds from different studies upon the same viral genotypes. Where identified, the key compounds responsible for the antiviral activity and their identified mechanisms of action are presented. It should be noted the term EC50 (effective concentration) applies to cell-based assays, while IC50 (inhibitory concentration) applies to enzyme-or biochemical-based assays.",

While the results highlight the potential of selected plant extracts against SARS-CoV, they also demonstrate that such work can be akin to searching for a 'needle in a haystack'. For example, Li et al. (2005) screened over 200 ethanol/chloroform extracts of Chinese medicinal herbs and found only four (Lycoris radiata, Artemisia annua, Pyrrosia lingua and Lindera aggregata) with moderate to high antiviral activity using a CPE assay (EC50 values ranging from 2.4 \u00b1 0.2 to 88.2 \u00b1 7.7 \u00b5g/ml). Of these, a single compound (lycorine) from one plant species (L. radiata) was earmarked as a potential drug candidate against SARS-CoV. The antiviral efficacy of lycorine was quite high (EC50 of 15.7 \u00b1 1.2 nM), with a selectivity index greater than 900. Although the authors did not make mention of this fact, lycorine can cause toxic effects at low dosage levels (around 1 mg/kg in dogs) (Kretzing et al., 2011) , hence great caution would be required for further development of this compound as a drug candidate. Yu et al. (2012) screened the activity of a library of 64 naturally occurring compounds against SARS-CoV helicase, which plays a key role in the viral genome replication, transcription, and translation. The polyphenolics myricetin and scutellarein ( Figure 2 ) were identified as the most promising candidates (IC50 values of 2.71 \u00b1 0.19 and 0.86 \u00b1 0.48 \u00b5M, respectively). Although the antiviral activity of the compounds was not assessed in cell-based assays, the authors did report that neither compound was toxic to normal (non-tumorigenic) breast epithelial cells. Myricetin is found in reasonably high concentrations in fruits such as cranberry (H\u00e4kkinen et al., 1999) as well as in several vegetables such as Calamus scipionum and garlic (Miean and Mohamed, 2001) . Scutellarein was isolated from Scutellaria baicalensis (Chinese Skullcap), which has been traditionally used in the treatment of inflammation and respiratory infections, amongst other uses (Zhao et al., 2016) . Both compounds were found to inhibit SARS-CoV helicase (nsP13) through the inhibition of ATPase activity, but did not directly inhibit helicase activity. This appeared to be the only publication identifying naturally occurring compounds as inhibitors of SARS-CoV helicase.",

Although the exact mechanism of action was not determined, activity at the stage of viral attachment or the end of the infectious viral cycle were deemed to be the most likely targets. In clinical trials, other lectins have demonstrated reasonable to good tolerability (Petersen et al., 2006) , hence with further testing, they may prove to be one of the more promising classes of naturally derived compound(s) for the treatment of SARS-CoV-2 and other coronavirus infections.",

For example, adding 2-acetamido-\u03b2-D-glucopyranosylamine to the glycoside chain of glycyrrhizin increased its antiviral activity in a CPE assay by 10-fold (decrease in EC50 from 365 \u00b1 12 \u00b5M to 40 \u00b1 13 \u00b5M), through increased attraction to the S proteins. Amides and conjugates with amino acid residues and free COOH increased activity of glycyrrhizin by up to 70-fold (EC50 for CPE assay ranging from 5 \u00b1 3 \u00b5M to 139 \u00b1 20 \u00b5M), albeit with significantly reduced selectivity. Cho et al. (2013) demonstrated that tomentins A-E (all naturally occurring compounds) showed viral inhibition activity against SARS-CoV greater as compared to their non-geranylated precursor compounds. Similarly, quercetin-7-rhamnoside ( Figure 2 ) demonstrates over 100 times higher antiviral activity against an animal coronavirus strain compared to its parent compound, quercetin (Choi et al., 2009) .",

For example, Park et al. (2017) found that the compound 3'-(3-methylbut-2-enyl)-3',4,7trihydroxyflavane, isolated from Broussonetia papyrifera, showed good inhibition of PLpro from SARS-CoV (IC50 of 3.7 \u00b1 1.6 \u00b5M), but not against PLpro from MERS-CoV (IC50 of 112.5 \u00b1 7.3 \u00b5M). In contrast, the polyphenolics kazinol F and broussochalcone A isolated from the same species showed better efficacy against MERS-CoV PLpro. Similarly, O'Keefe et al. (2010) found that the efficacy of the compound griffithsin against SARS-CoV was highest for the Urbani and Tor-II strains (EC50 of 0.61 \u00b5g/mL using a CPE inhibition assay) and lowest for the Frank strain (EC50 of 1.19 \u00b5g/mL). Griffithsin, isolated from the red alga Griffithsia sp., is a lectin possessing three large identical carbohydratebinding domains orientated as an equatorial triangle, which enable multivalent binding (O'Keefe et al., 2010) . Although the source of these observed differences in the inhibition activity of griffithsin against different SARS-CoV strains was not explored by O' Keefe et al., (2010) , it may be attributable to genomic differences in the amino acid sequences of the spike proteins between SARS-CoV strains, leading to varying multivalent interactions with the carbohydrates-binding domains and thus differing affinity for binding to the spike proteins. Nevertheless, these studies highlight the importance of conducting in vitro tests of potential naturally-derived therapeutics on SARS-CoV-2 prior to animal or clinical trials.",

It comprises three carbohydrate-binding domains which allow it to bind specifically to glycans on CoV protein spikes and inhibit viral attachment to host cells, with high potency found in in vitro trials against MERS-CoV (EC50 of ~0.125 \u00b5M) (O'Keefe et al., 2010) and several HCoV strains (EC50 of 0.0032-0.33 \u00b5M) (Millet et al., 2016) . Griffithsin also appears to have a low systematic toxicity, with its specificity index against HCoV cells (compared to human colorectal adenocarcinoma or fibroblast cell lines) has been estimated at between 30 -3100 (O' Keefe et al., 2010) , hence showing the potential to be considered as one of the prime candidates for animal and clinical trials against SARS-CoV-2.",

            "text": "A recent study highlighted the potential anti-HCoV-NL63 activity of the methanolic extract of Strobilanthes cusia leaf and its major phytochemicals (Tsai et al., 2020) . The S. cusia extract effectively reduced virus yield (EC50 = 0.64 \u00b5g/mL) in cells infected with HCoV-NL63 in a dose-dependent manner. Of the six key compounds isolated, purified and identified via NMR spectroscopy, two exhibited the most potent antiviral activity against HCoV, namely tryptanthrin ( Figure 2) , a natural alkaloid containing the basic indoloquinazoline moiety, and indigodole B (5aR-ethyltryptanthrin), an indole alkaloid derivative. The EC50 values against virus yield from infected cells were 1.52 \u00b5M and 2.60 \u00b5M for tryptanthrin and indigodole B, respectively. The increased antiviral activity of tryptanthrin in comparison to indigodole B may result from the double bond at C5a in the former, as compared to the additional ethyl moiety in the latter. This highlights that for compounds based on a tryptanthrin structural conformity, addition of a double bond in the quinazoline ring could significantly increase their antiviral activity. Tryptanthrin has previously been found to have a broad spectrum of biological activities including anticancer, anti-inflammatory, antiprotozoal, antiallergic, antioxidant and antimicrobial action (Kaur et al., 2017) . Through manipulation of varying modes of time-ofaddition/removal assay, it was found that tryptanthrin prevented the early and late stages of HCoV-NL63 replication, particularly by blocking the viral RNA genome synthesis and papain-like protease 2 activity, and inhibiting the post-entry stage of HCoV replication (Tsai et al., 2020) . Intriguingly, both tryptanthrin (EC50 = 0.06 \u00b5M) and indigodole B (EC50 = 2.09 \u00b5M) exhibited strong viricidal activity directly against HCoV-NL63. As the HCoV-NL63 spike protein (S protein) targets the ACE2 receptor, showing a highly conserved sequence and structural similarity to SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 (Letko et al., 2020) , tryptanthrin has the potential to be explored as a possible bioactive agent against SARS-CoV-2 and other human coronaviruses.",

            "text": "Another recent study on HCoV-OC43 focussed on the antiviral activities of the bis-benzylisoquinoline alkaloids tetrandrine, fangchinoline, and cepharanthine (CPE assay EC50 values of 0.33 \u00b1 0.03, 1.01 \u00b1 0.07 and 0.83 \u00b1 0.07 \u00b5M, respectively) (Kim et al., 2019) . These compounds were the primary bioactive phytochemicals identified in Stephania tetrandra and related species. All compounds were found to inhibit virus-induced cell death, through suppressing viral replication, expression of viral S and N proteins (nucleocapsid protein), and the virus-induced host response. However, the effective inhibitory concentrations were not reported for the inhibition of viral protein expression or host response. In addition, tetrandrine activated the p38MAPK pathway in MRC-5 cells, improving the aforementioned host response. Weng et al. (2019) tested the ethanolic extracts of Sambucus formosana (elderberry) stems against the human coronavirus strain HCoV-NL63, finding quite high efficacy (EC50 of 1.17 \u00b1 0.75 \u00b5g/mL) for viral yield reduction. With further investigation of the phenolic composition of the extracts and antiviral assays performed on the main individual phenolic acids present, caffeic acid ( Figure 2 ) was identified as the most potent compound present (EC50 of 3.54 \u00b1 0.77 \u00b5M; or ~0.64 \u00b1 0.14 \u00b5g/mL). Although no specific binding sites were identified, caffeic acid was found to inhibit the attachment of HCoV to host cells, indicating potential binding to S proteins. Caffeic acid has also been found to inhibit other viruses such as hepatitis B (Wang et al., 2009) . Notably, extracts of Sambucus nigra (black elderberry), another species in the same genus as S. formosana, have been commercialised for the treatment of cold and flu symptoms. Therefore, it is likely that extracts from S. formosana would prove similarly nontoxic and suitable for human use, although clinical trials would be required to confirm this. Nevertheless, the bioavailability/delivery mechanism of such extracts would need to be considered in order to reach therapeutic plasma concentrations for viral inhibition (Wittemer et al., 2005) . Cheng et al. (2006) examined the anticoronaviral activity of saikosaponins (A, B2, C and D) and their mode of action against HCoV-229E in vitro. Saikosaponins represent a group of pentacyclic triterpenoid derivatives, usually present as glycosides, that have been isolated from medicinal plants such as Bupleurum spp., Heteromorpha spp. and Scrophularia scorodonia, previously found to possess efficacy against several viruses, including human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) (Chiang et al., 2003; Ushio and Abe, 1992) . All saikosaponins tested showed good to moderate anti-coronavirus activity, with saikosaponin B2 (Figure 2) showing the greatest potency (EC50 of 1.7 \u00b1 0.1 \u00b5M). Subsequent timeof-addition studies indicated that saikosaponin B2 inhibited viral attachment and penetration. Interestingly, the same compound has been found to inhibit hepatitis C entry (Lin et al., 2015) as well as multidrug resistance-associated drug transporters present on the cell surface (Zhao et al., 2019) , indicating that it has potential to display a broad spectrum of bioactivity. This may be advantageous in developing nations where hepatitis C prevalence is high (Pawlotsky, 2014) .",

The genomic diversity, coupled with the ability of coronaviruses to rapidly adapt and mutate, presents unique challenges in the development of novel antiviral agents, hence exploring alternative methods of controlling these viruses could potentially be effective across many or all serotypes. As natural phytochemicals have been shown to have activity across a wide range of viral pathogens (Chen et al., 2014) , they form the basis of the studies reviewed here. The majority of plant-derived compounds considered in this review are direct-targeting antivirals, acting through direct inhibition of some part of the virus, such as proteases or spike proteins. For example, silvestrol prevents viral replication occurring through the specific inhibition of RNA helicase eIF4A (M\u00fcller et al., 2018) , while griffithsin binds directly to the S protein, preventing viral entry to the host cell (O'Keefe et al., 2010) . However, host-targeting antivirals form another important group of antiviral compounds. For example, extracts of Cinnamomi sp. Inhibit the clathrindependent endocytosis pathway, thus preventing viral entry to the host cells (Zhuang et al., 2009) . Other host-targeting antiviral compounds may stimulate the immune response (Lau et al., 2008) . Table 2 presents a summary of studies reporting anti-viral activity of plant-derived isolates against a range of animal coronavirus strains. Where available, the key compounds responsible for the antiviral activity and their mechanism of action are provided.",

Considering all studies on avian IBV that have established the mechanism of viral inhibition, the main mechanisms of action appear to be through viral envelope disruption or interference with the spike protein (Table 2) . A notable exception are the terpenoid compounds 1,8-cineole, (-)-\u03b1-pinene and (-)-\u03b2-pinene, which bind to the IBV nucleocapsid protein (N-protein) (Yang et al., 2010; Yang et al., 2011) , inhibiting its interaction with the viral genomic RNA and breaking the IBV replication cycle. These observations were reinforced by conformational models of the terpenoids binding to the active site at the N terminus of the N protein, which indicated that these compounds have the potential to bind strongly to five amino acid residues at this location (TyrA92, ProA134, PheA137, AspA138 and TyrA140) (Yang et al., 2010; Yang et al., 2011) . As these residues are highly conserved between IBV strains (Yang et al., 2010) , these terpenoids would be expected to show high efficacy against most or all IBV strains, making them a sensible target for further research.",

In one study, Galanthus nivalis agglutinin, another lectin, was identified as a potent inhibitor of feline coronavirus (FCoV) (Hsieh et al., 2010) . With an EC50 of just 0.0088 nM and a high selectivity index (>218), this carbohydrate-binding protein outperformed all synthetic antiviral agents tested for comparison purposes. For example, the protease inhibitor nelfinavir displayed an EC50 of 8.19 \u00b5M and a selectivity index of just 1.4. As with other agglutinins, Galanthus nivalis agglutinin binds to the spike and membrane proteins of FCoV, preventing their attachment to the host cells. McDonagh et al. (2014) conducted a screening study against 19 compounds, focusing on those demonstrated to have previous antiviral effects against coronaviruses or other RNA viruses. Several naturally occurring compounds were included in this study, such as quercetin, curcumin, rutin, glycyrrhizic acid, hesperidin, hesperitin, baicalin and artemisinin. However, none of these compounds reached EC50 at the concentrations tested. Glycyrrhizic acid was the most promising, causing a 26.7% reduction in CPE at a concentration of 25 \u00b5M. As only a single concentration was tested for each compound (ranging from 10-50 \u00b5M, depending on the compound), further investigation of these compounds against FCoV is required. Theerawatanasirikul et al. (2020) adopted a computer-aided approach to their screening study against feline infectious peritonitis virus (FIPV), a mutated form of the parental enteric form of FCoV. Firstly, compounds from a chemical library were virtually screened for potential binding to the protease 3CL. The 15 most promising compounds were then evaluated in vitro using a protease inhibitor assay against FIPV 3CL pro . Of the naturally occurring compounds tested, the lowest IC50 values were shown by 7-methylluteolin (28.5 \u00b1 4.2 \u00b5M) and stictic acid (29.4 \u00b1 4.6 \u00b5M). Quercetin 7-rhamnoside ( Figure  2 ) also showed moderate inhibition (IC50 of 77.2 \u00b1 13.8 \u00b5M); however 7-benzyl luteolin and steviol showed no inhibition (IC50 > 500 \u00b5M). Subsequent testing of the active compounds using a cytopathic effect (CPE) assay indicated that only stictic acid protected cells from viral-induced death (EC50 for previral entry treatment of 16.24 \u00b1 1.33 \u00b5M; selectivity index of 23).",

Nevertheless, none of the studies of this viral strain have conclusively managed to determine the specific compounds responsible for viral inhibition, but rather suggested possible compounds or classes of compounds based on their abundance in the extracts tested. The low inhibitory concentrations (<1 \u00b5g/mL) of extracts obtained from Sophorae sp., Acanthopanacis sp. and Torilis sp. appear to show significant potential. In particular, the high viral specificity (SI = 696) of Sophorae sp. root extracts suggests that it could be considered as a prime candidate for future studies on the screening and isolation of compounds from the aforementioned species.

Notably, quercetin was also one of the compounds shortlisted by Zhang et al. (2020) in their virtual screening of inhibitors of SARS-CoV-2 proteases. Against PEDV, quercetin-7-rhamnoside, a disaccharide glucoside, provided 50 % inhibition of viral activity at a concentration of just 0.03 \u00b5M, approximately 187 times lower than quercetin alone (Choi et al., 2009) . Significantly, the specificity of quercetin-7-rhamnoside was exceptionally high (SI = 7143), indicating its potential for application in future animal or clinical trials. This study again highlights the importance of considering all possible structural conformities of a compound, including glycosides, in order to identify the most bioactive chemical species. Although the mechanism of action was not determined for quercetin or quercetin-7-rhamnoside against PEDV, previous computer modelling work has indicated that quercetin binds to and inhibits the SARS-CoV proteases PLpro and 3CLpro . As previously determined, griffithsin binds to the spike protein of CoV, preventing attachment to host cells (Millet et al., 2016; O'Keefe et al., 2010) .",

This is consistent with a wide body of research indicating that relatively polar extracted fractions generally contain a greater level of bioactive and antimicrobial compounds compared to their nonpolar counterparts (Han et al., 2007; Tian et al., 2009; Wigmore et al., 2016) . This may also be indicative of increased bioactivity of highly polar glycosylated compounds, similar to the vast difference in antiviral activity observed between quercetin and quercetin-7rhamnoside (Choi et al., 2009 ).",

Further chemical modification of these structures, guided by computerbased docking simulations, may also increase their potency and/or selectivity. Some of the key compounds that show promise for the treatment of coronavirus in humans include scutellarein, silvestrol, tryptanthrin, saikosaponin B2, lectins such as griffithsin, lycorine and polyphenolicsincluding quercetin, myricetin, caffeic acid, psoralidin and isobavachalcone. Needless to mention, these compounds may be toxic at certain levels, and hence in vitro and in vivo testing is required to determine safe and therapeutic levels for each compound before clinical trials in humans can be performed. Initial studies could focus on compounds which have previously been approved for drug use, or are generally regarded as safe by the FDA or other national organisations, as is the case for some polyphenolic compounds. It is hoped that researchers will be guided by this information presented here in the process of developing safe, effective anti-coronavirus therapeutic agents from naturally derived compounds.",
