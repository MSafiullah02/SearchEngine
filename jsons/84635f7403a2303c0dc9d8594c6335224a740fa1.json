Specimens for staining by the fluorescence method were obtained from nasal washings collected on the third or fourth day after virus inoculation. Phosphate-buffered saline (10 ml) was instilled in small amounts alternately into each nostril, and the expelled fluid and nasal secretions were collected; these were kept on melting ice for not more than 30 minutes before centrifugation at 1,500 rpm for ten minutes at 4\u00b0C. The deposited cells were thereafter prepared as described by Gardner and McQuillin [4] , The nasal washings from volunteers inoculated with 229E and OC44 were cultured in a 229E-sensitive continuous cell line (MRC-C) obtained from Dr A.F. Bradburne. NPS specimens from infants and children admitted with respiratory tract disease to the Tyneside hospitals during 1969-1974 were inoculated into three tissue culture types (HELF, HEp-2 or Bristol HeLa, and rhesus monkey kidney). In addition, slides of shed nasopharyngeal cells were prepared for and examined by immunoflourescence methods for respiratory viruses [4] . Extra acetone-fixed slides were stored at 4 0\u00b0C . Coronavirus studies were performed only in specimens where routine virus tests had failed to uncover a virus. The tests for coronaviruses were performed in 1974 after storage at 4 0\u00b0C for four months to five years.
