The principles should be rooted in empirical experience but transcend the finite boundaries of observation. Two universal characteristics of human behaviour that contribute significantly to the generation of man-made risks are malicious action and human error. Malevolence and benevolence are opposite sides of individual character. Here we are concerned with the negative aspects of human behaviour, leading to terrorism and political violence. The adversarial nature of terrorism and political violence is captured within the methodology of game theory, which addresses the strategic interactions between opposing groups. The behavioural aspects of these interactions are accounted for in behavioural game theory (Camerer 2003).",

Thus, Sun Tzu notes: Now an army may be likened to water, for just as water avoids heights and hastens to the lowlands, so an army avoids strength and strikes weakness. For attacks by terrorists, cyber hackers or warring states, quantitative risk modelling is unified by the principles of adversarial conflict, such as those laid out by Sun Tzu. The well-defined principles underlying quantitative terrorism risk modelling minimize the need to resort to expert judgement (Woo 2011, 2015). Within the bounds defined by the Western counter-terrorism environment, terrorists maximize their operational utility by abiding by the classic principles of terrorist modus operandi: substituting hardened targets; following the path of least resistance in weapon selection; and leveraging their scarce resources to achieve the greatest impact. The metric for impact includes not just loss inflicted but also the media attention gained. An insightful ISIS slogan is that media is half Jihad. Media coverage is essential for terrorist recruitment and funding, as well as for propaganda. This is so important that in 2002, Osama bin Laden wrote that the media war may reach 90% of the preparation for battles (Awan 2016).",

Insurance accumulation risk in an urban area may be gauged from a loss analysis using a five-ton bomb scenario. But how likely is such a weapon mode? Attack severity is constrained by the logistical burden of acquiring the skilled personnel, material, testing facilities and financial resources required for a weapon attack mode: the bigger and more ambitious the weapon, the greater is the logistical burden. Most importantly in a hostile counter-terrorism environment, attack severity is limited by the persistent and pervasive threat of arrest and plot disruption. Once a weapon of a particular size has been developed, an expedient terrorist choice would be to deploy it without delay. Alternatively, a riskier decision may be made to continue to develop a larger more potent weapon, which would pose a greater logistical challenge and would require extra material and financial resources, more time and more operatives. Accordingly, for the operatives involved, it would carry an increasingly higher likelihood of arrest.",

In an oppressive counter-terrorism environment, it is hard and perhaps foolhardy for a terrorist organization to skip weapon sizes because the extra development and testing time for a new superior weapon would present an excessive risk of interdiction or malfunction.

Before any massive CBRN attack, some precursory lesser attack may provide an early warning indicator of increasing terrorist capability and progression on the demanding technical learning curve. As the anthrax letter scare in Autumn 2001 demonstrated, even a small quantity of anthrax can cause mass terror. If a terrorist cell has accumulated even a modest quantity of a highly toxic substance, there would be very strong counter-terrorism pressure to deploy it rather than to delay an attack by months to acquire much more. The law of diminishing returns would apply to the prospective terrorist gain. Operational research methods can quantify the balance between the risk of arrest and the reward of a more potent weapon. Since 9/11, denial of safe terrorist havens for laboratory R&D has meant that not even a minor Jihadi CBRN attack has been witnessed, and there is scant evidence of experimentation and preparation of toxic material. In Syria, chlorine bombs have been deployed, but these lack the lethal potency of nerve agents.",

Nobody can read the mind of a terrorist, so how can the risk of a terrorist action be estimated? There would indeed be a strong dependence on human behaviour if terrorists were allowed to attack at will. In many countries of the world, where the law enforcement and security services are ineffective or corrupt, terrorists are allowed to attack at will, and terrorism risk is then very dependent on human behaviour. In Pakistan for example, where the ISI intelligence service openly supports the Taliban because of unresolved Indian border disputes, terrorists may attack at a time and tempo of their own choosing. In Pakistan, terrorism risk is governed by Taliban behaviour.",

Indeed, in a parliamentary Inquiry after the Edward Snowden surveillance revelations, Andrew Parker, the director-general of MI5, insisted that such surveillance was essential if terrorists were not to be able to attack at will. Terrorist behaviour is tightly governed by controls placed on what terrorists can do without being arrested. In particular, the trend towards smaller lone-wolf plots is a causal reflection of the practical difficulty in organizing larger plots without counter-terrorism disruption. On assuming the leadership of Al Qaeda after the death of Osama bin Laden, Ayman al Zawahiri recommended the strategy of lone-wolf plots. He had learned a basic lesson of conspiracy, which dates back to Imperial Rome: when others are listening, conspiracies should be kept small. Back in 2006, he had boasted of an Al Qaeda plot bigger than 9/11. This was the ambitious liquid explosives plot aimed at bringing down seven transatlantic passenger jets from UK to USA and Canada.

The scientific process of randomized control trials can discriminate those with particularly good judgement on political events. Superforecasters can be identified who have special skill in forecasting, as can be measured through a Brier score. It is not necessary to have years of intelligence experience to be good at forecasting political events. Indeed, many who do have such experience are rather indifferent or poor forecasters. Superforecasters have been identified as having some special traits. They are typically numerate, with a technical knowledge of Bayes theorem, even if they may not explicitly make their forecasts doing any actual Bayes theorem calculations. Rather, they edge towards the truth by implicitly following the Bayes principle of updating according to the weight of evidence using their own sense of intuition.",

Extradition treaties allow hackers to stand trial abroad, such as has forced UK hackers to submit to US justice for cyber crimes against US targets. However, many cyber attacks against Western countries are launched from Russia, China, Pakistan and so on, where there is very little prospect of bringing the cyber criminals to justice, and no sanction against their activities in their own countries.

Just as regular criminals can buy firearms and need not have the capability and labour to make such weapons on their own, so cyber criminals can buy exploit kits made by others, rather than endeavour to create their own hacking tools. There is a thriving market in the sale of exploit kits, made often by cyber criminal gangs based in Russia and the Ukraine. There is also an active market in the buying and selling of zero day exploits. Governments are active participants in this market, keen to maintain arsenals of effective cyber weapons in anticipation of a future cyber war. Governments hold the most powerful arsenals of cyber weapons, in readiness for war. The possibility of a security breach of a cyber arsenal is not hypothetical; it was demonstrated in 2016, when some National Security Agency weapons were picked up by a hacking team called Shadowbrokers. This demonstrates the catastrophe risk potential of cyber risk.",
