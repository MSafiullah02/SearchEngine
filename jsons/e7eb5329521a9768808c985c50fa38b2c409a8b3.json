Over 90 countries have put in place travel restrictions and quarantines at the time of writing. In many countries, COVID-19 has, at least temporarily, changed the face of cities and fundamentally affected the discussion of how we should manage urban life in the wake of a pandemic. The current crisis has ushered in talk of states of exception, unique measures, and unprecedented moves in cities and countries the world over. Questions such as ''Will there be a lasting impact?'' and ''What will urban resilience and sustainability look like in a post-coronavirus world?'' are emerging.",

COVID-19 is perhaps not quite, as authoritative voices such as Bill Gates called it in the New England Journal of Medicine, a ''once-in-a-century pandemic.'' 1 Yes, the impact of coronavirus will uniquely drive a change in the way we think about cities and health. But it is not a completely unique occurrence. In 2003, severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) followed a very similar path to global contagion and fell just short of the current impact of COVID-19. Near misses and concerning cases of infectious-disease outbreaks are a near-daily occurrence for the World Health Organization (WHO), which detects about 7,000 signals of potential outbreaks every month. 2 The majority of such crises lead to our learning key lessons in both global and urban governance. SARS taught us to better understand how our international system is centered on global cities and how, through their planetary connections, epidemics can go global. 3 H1N1, echoing medical history lessons, stressed how epidemics are superimposed onto contexts of urban marginalization and affect the already disadvantaged. The global impact of COVID-19, although perhaps not the deadliest nor the most formidable of all these diseases, has captured global attention and triggered a response like no other in recent history. What will the lesson be this time-and will it be heeded? The current crisis still has, at least at the time of writing amid countrywide lockdowns, the potential to follow the same path as that of the 1918 ''Spanish flu,'' which affected 27% of the world's population. Anyone from that generation would have known an infected acquaintance or, worse, had to witness the brutal effects of that flu on a loved one. The coronavirus portends a key challenge in global health governance but also a key trial for the way in which we manage, plan, and live in possibly contagious cities.",

Ever since the early 2000s, Roger Keil and colleagues have commented on the relative unmanageability of the suburban sprawl and how coronavirus contagions can start and spread inward from, and between, the edges. 4 Much of the German contagion story is that of a link-via an automotive production factory-between the outskirts of Wuhan and peri-urban Bavaria. These are the edges that the ''global city'' imaginary of the late 20 th and early 21 st centuries has again largely overlooked. 4 And then there are the informal settlements devoid of governance, design, services, and legal status; in these, upward of a billion people are estimated to presently live. The management of infection, treatment, social distancing, and service provision in such settings is a formidable problem. But once more, although this has only recently surfaced in the media, this is no novelty. The Sierra Leone Urban Research Centre noted at the time of the 2014 Ebola scare how the poor attempts to quarantine and sanitize informal settlements ended in poor results and violence. 5 Of greater concern still is that, although most stark in informal settlements, inequalities are not restricted to the Global South. Globally, nearly two billion people have poor or no access to adequate sanitation, and more than 150 million are considered homeless. 6 Inequalities permeate urban society and introduce a further layer of complexity to managing pandemics-this is already evident in the current crisis in that concerns regarding housing evictions in major cities were flagged at the beginning of March 2020.",

The crisis has, for instance, seen the proliferation of regularly updated crisis-information repositories at international and national levels, as with the well-known Johns Hopkins University Center for Systems Science and Engineering dashboard or the quick release of territory information by the Italian Protezione Civile. Emergency notification, advice, and health-check apps, as well as WhatsApp-based information bots, have also become a regular feature. These could be leveraged to drive a more risk-literate urban citizenry in the longer term, just like health and prevention measures could provide the foundation for better sanitation practices across cities.",

Whether we will leverage COVID-19 as an opportunity for greater community building and more explicit considerations of urban equality remains to be seen. Appreciating how tacit networks of mutual care, 8 and the informal governance of our cities, work is a critical step at this juncture in time. Mutual aid groups, such as the COVID-19 Mutual Aid UK initiative now sprawling in the hundreds across Britain, have proliferated in the wake of the crisis. Recognition of the most at-risk groups by local authorities is also key. Greater Manchester Mayor Andy Burnham launched a \u00a35 million fund to be used with immediate effect to house 1,000 rough sleepers across the city in a time of extreme vulnerability. Philadelphia and New York have made COVID text alerts available for residents of all nationalities irrespectively of visa status. Sydney has been providing multilingual public-health information via the city's community centers. Many cities, such as San Francisco, have declared a moratorium on residential evictions. Ljubljana has organized a home-food-delivery system for children in at-risk families and elderly citizens.",

Mayors the world over are faced with the suffocating pressures discussed above while wielding stifled powers, often limited data (in capacity, geospatial coverage, and level of accuracy), and global connectivity challenges amid closing borders and nationalist separation. In this context, it is fundamental for local and national governments to understand the extent of the urban experimentation afoot at present in urban areas worldwide, and temporary measures can teach us a great deal about the possibilities for reform. Mobility limitations have, for instance, blatantly put in check transport-related emissions to the tune of 25% reduction in China and Italy alike, which speaks volumes for the radical efforts to curb our greenhouse gas impact on the atmosphere. 9 The digital response to what has already been tagged by the WHO as the most ''information-intensive'' public-health crisis of modern times has been a treasure trove of digital change promoting teleworking, web-based community building, virtually delivered services, and 3D printing of essentials ranging from test swabs in the US to ventilators in Italy. A similar discussion could apply to the vast labor implications of the crisis, where not only massive challenges such as misinformation and job precarity are under the spotlight, but also sizeable tests to virtual alternatives and working patterns are taking place across developed and developing nations. At present, these are reported with curiosity, but better mechanisms of learning not only from the crisis but also while in the crisis 10 and of understanding possible alternative pathways for city life could be put in place while we respond to the current disruptions. Transport, public venues ranging from stadiums to cinemas and sites of prayer, and even streets might have to be retrofitted with the goal of avoiding overcrowding and service redundancy rather than continuous strain.",
