The operational principle is based on passing of air sample through porous medium submerged into a layer of collecting liquid. As the result, during passing through narrow and tortuous channels inside the porous medium, the air stream is split into a multitude of very small bubbles with the particulates are being scavenged by these bubbles and, thus, effectively removed before the effluent air leaves the device. Bioaerosol particles are being accumulated in the collecting liquid during the entire process of sampler operation. The experimental verification of the sampler for monitoring of common viruses with different levels of sensitivity to physical and biological stresses showed that it can recover up to 25% of rather labile Influenza virus, whilst a very robust and stable Vaccinia virus is being recovered at the level of 90% (Agranovski et al., 2005a, Agranovski et al., 2005b). A higher survival level of biological material was observed when the sampler was tested on bacteria (Agranovski et al., 2002).",

During the sampler operating time from t to t+\u0394t (0\u2a7dt\u2a7dT), the number of bioaerosol particles collected by the device is: \u0394n=\u03baQC(t)\u0394t, where \u03ba is the coefficient taking into account the efficiency of aspiration and capture of virus-containing particles by collecting fluid (0\u2a7d\u03ba\u2a7d1), Q is the sampling flow rate, and C(t) is the calculated concentration of virus-containing particles in the air. As discussed earlier, some microbial inactivation could occur during sampling process due to bubbling related stress. As the result, along with time related increase of the number of collected viral particles, the competitive process of their inactivation will take place in collecting fluid. Linear approximation of the live virus concentration values, C\ns(t), in the collecting fluid for different bubbling time periods t results in the exponential dependence of biological activity of viruses on the time: n(t)=n(0) exp(\u2212t/\u03c4), where \u03c4 is the time of the virus activity decrease by a factor of e\u22482.72.

When sampling times, T, are much larger than the Euler time scale, \u03c4(E), the ergodicity condition would be approximately fulfilled (Tikhonov, 1982) with Eq. (5) remaining unchanged. The expression for dispersion of the unbiased estimate for the nonstationary case can be obtained from Eq. (7) by presetting \u201cquasi-stationary\u201d form of the correlation function of the concentration pulsations as (Byzova, 1974):B(t,\u03be)=\u03c32(t)exp[-|\u03be|\u03c4(E)].Quasi-stationarity becomes apparent in the fact that, along with C(t) value changing on the average rather slowly in the interval (0,T), quick pulsations with frequencies of the order of 1/\u03c4(E) impose on the process of the concentration change. In this case,\u03c3mes2(T)=2\u03c42[1-exp(-T/\u03c4)]2\u00d7\u222b0Texp[-|\u03be|/\u03c4(E)+\u03be/\u03c4]\u00d7\u222b0T-\u03be\u03c32(t)exp[-2(T-t)/\u03c4]dtd\u03be.\n",

For practical situations, six wells are used for each measurement making the total amount of analyzed liquid\u2014600 \u03bcL.

Firstly, determine the time scale \u03c4(E) by the empiric formula \u03c4\n(E)\u2248(45\u00b18)z/U where z should be preset in m, and U is the module of wind velocity at the height z in m/s (Borodulin et al., 1992). In the considered example \u03c4\n(E)\u224870 s. That is why curve 3 corresponds to the dependence \u03c3mes2/\u03c32 on the normalized sampling time T/\u03c4 in Fig. 2. It can be seen that at the preset sampling conditions the errors in the estimate of C\nmes make up \u03c3mes2/\u03c32\u22480.7, which is a rather large value.",

            "text": "Thus, for utilization of the personal sampler, to obtain unbiased estimates of the countable concentration of virus-containing aerosols, besides taking into account the efficiency of capture of particles sampler, a fudge factor \u03bc should be introduced. The physical nature of this factor is associated with exponential kinetics of viral particle degradation in a suspension at air bubbling through a porous membrane. The fudge factor depends on the sampling time T and the typical time of viral activity decrease \u03c4. The fudge factor value increases with T/\u03c4 increase. As the result, the average integral value of the countable concentration within the sampling time from t to t+T can be obtained. The dispersion of the unbiased estimate of the concentration of virus-containing aerosols C\nmes is determined by Eq. (9). The dispersion of the unbiased estimate of the concentration \u03c3mes2 decreases with T increase and increases with a decrease in \u03c4/\u03c4(E) parameter. The values of the countable concentration of virus-containing aerosols lower than the threshold values determined by Eq. (10) cannot be considered as reliable. Considering a very high physical collection efficiency of the sampler (Agranovski et al., 2002), in our calculations we assumed this value to be unity, however, the particular number corresponding to the size of targeted microorganism can be obtained from our previous paper (Agranovski et al., 2002) and directly used to correct the final results (the minimal measurable concentration in the air should be divided by the collection efficiency).",
