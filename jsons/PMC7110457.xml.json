The event can facilitate the acquisition and transmission of infectious agents, including those responsible for respiratory tract infection, and has been linked to both local and international outbreaks of diseases (Ahmed et al., 2006, Memish et al., 2015a, Memish et al., 2015b, Yezli et al., 2016a). Examples include meningococcal disease and influenza (Salmon-Rousseau et al., 2016, Yezli et al., 2016a). Experience from Hajj shows that the implementation of appropriate prevention measures such as vaccination can significantly reduce the incidence of disease and outbreaks associated with this mass gathering. Of note is the prevention of meningococcal disease outbreaks since 2001, after the introduction of compulsory vaccination with the quadrivalent meningococcal vaccine and targeted chemoprophylaxis (Yezli et al., 2016b).",

Crowding in particular has been associated with pneumococcal disease outbreaks (Banerjee et al., 2005, Mercat et al., 1991). The acquisition and transmission of S. pneumoniae is well documented during Hajj, independent of clinical status (Memish et al., 2016, Memish et al., 2015a), and the organism is a leading cause of pneumonia-related hospitalizations and intensive care unit (ICU) admissions during the event (Al-Tawfiq and Memish, 2016, Memish et al., 2014).",

The addition of urine antigen testing for adult pneumonia patients is expected to add sensitivity to the etiological attribution, without inappropriately minimizing specificity (Mandell et al., 2003). The sensitivity and specificity of this test in the diagnosis of community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) due to S. pneumoniae have been reported to be in the range of 77%\u201397% and 67%\u2013100%, respectively (Gutierrez et al., 2003, Klugman et al., 2008, Molinos et al., 2015, Song et al., 2013).",

The study was therefore able to capture three time periods: pre-Hajj (August 23 to September 8), Hajj (September 9 to September 14), and post-Hajj (September 15 to September 23). Patients were enrolled from all general hospitals (excluding specialty hospitals such as obstetrics and gynecology hospitals and pediatric hospitals) designated to treat Hajj pilgrims.

CAP patients originated from a wide variety of countries with a sizable proportion being older males, which is reflective of the general population of Hajj. A number of other studies have reported that pneumonia is a leading cause of hospital admission (accounting for 15\u201340% of hospital admissions) during the pilgrimage (Al-Ghamdi et al., 2003, Khan et al., 2006, Madani et al., 2006, Shirah et al., 2017).

The organism is commonly isolated from Hajj pilgrims treated in clinics or hospitals during their pilgrimage. Several studies have found S. pneumoniae to be the cause of pneumonia in up to 10% of cases during Hajj (Alzeer et al., 1998, Asghar et al., 2011, Mandourah et al., 2012, Shirah et al., 2017), while one study found that among 38 patients treated for severe CAP at 15 facilities during the 2013 Hajj, S. pneumoniae was found in 56%, using the Randox respiratory multiplex array (Memish et al., 2014). Other important causative pathogens reported in these studies have included other bacteria such as Staphylococcus aureus, K. pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa and viruses including human rhinovirus, influenza A virus, and human coronaviruses, as well as the fungus Candida albicans. The results of this study are likely to be a more accurate reflection of the actual proportion of CAP caused by S. pneumoniae during Hajj, as the urine antigen test was used in addition to the standard culture-based methods. The test adds sensitivity to the etiological attribution without minimizing specificity (Mandell et al., 2003) and overcomes many of the limitations and difficulties in culturing S. pneumoniae from clinical samples (Bartlett, 2011). Although the test was highly specific in this study, it had lower sensitivity than that reported in other studies (Mandell et al., 2003).",

This is also in accordance with other reports, including those among Hajj pilgrims (Drijkoningen and Rohde, 2014, Mandourah et al., 2012, Shirah et al., 2017), and is likely because patients treated in the ICU or those with invasive disease have a more severe illness and are at a higher risk of death.",

            "text": "Most CAP cases in this study were admitted to Mecca hospitals, and the number of cases increased over the study period, with the highest admission rate being after the Hajj rituals days. This pattern is in accordance with the Hajj journey and its characteristics. Most pilgrims arrive in KSA a few days (or weeks) before the Hajj ritual dates and spend time in the holy cities of Mecca and/or Medina. During the Hajj dates, all pilgrims return to Mecca to perform the Hajj rituals, most of which take place at the Mecca holy sites. Hence, the pre-Hajj period is characterized by a smaller number of pilgrims, living in less crowded environments, spread across both Mecca and Medina, and relatively free of stressors associated with performing the Hajj rituals. During the Hajj dates, the maximum numbers of pilgrims are located in a small area of Mecca performing physically challenging Hajj rituals in crowded conditions, under both physical and environmental stressors. These conditions facilitate disease transmission and render pilgrims more prone to infection. It is likely that many CAP cases admitted after Hajj were infected during the Hajj dates. This may explain the increase in the number of CAP cases post-Hajj, while the number of pilgrims in Mecca and Medina was decreasing.",

Although no significant association was found between these factors and pneumococcal pneumonia in this study, age, co-morbidities, and smoking are established risk factors for CAP, including pneumococcal pneumonia (Almirall et al., 2017, Lynch and Zhanel, 2009). The latter is a vaccine-preventable disease and the above risk factors are indications for pneumococcal vaccination in adults (Tomczyk et al., 2014). The finding that a proportion of CAP during Hajj was caused by S. pneumoniae, and that most of it was among individuals at risk of the disease, is significant. Currently, pneumococcal vaccination is not one of the officially recommended/compulsory vaccinations in the Hajj health requirements set by the Saudi authorities (Saudi Ministry of Health, 2017). Although some countries have recommended pneumococcal vaccination for their Hajj pilgrims (Feldman et al., 2013, Mathai et al., 2016, Rashid et al., 2013), an evidence-based policy requires a better understanding of the clinical and economic burden of the disease associated with Hajj. This study is a first step in providing such data, by defining the burden of the disease in the Hajj season using a more reliable diagnostic test for pneumococcal pneumonia. However, further studies are warranted, including accurate estimations of the incidence of the disease during the mass gathering and determining the serotypes causing the illness.",

However, very early pneumonia may not be apparent on chest radiographs and may have led to the exclusion of some cases from the study. Not all CAP cases were investigated using culture-based methods, which are not routinely conducted by hospitals during Hajj due to feasibility. Some of the information collected from pilgrims was self-reported (e.g., smoking status) and hence may be subject to underreporting. Also, information on the pneumococcal disease vaccination status of the cases was not collected, so it was not possible to investigate the effect of vaccination. In addition, as no accurate data on the adult population at risk during the study period were available, it was not possible to accurately estimate the incidence of CAP during Hajj.",
