The variations in DNA sequence found within regions that make up genes are responsible for the genetically determined variation in our physical characteristics, our physiology, and our personality traits. Genetic variability also appears to be involved in susceptibility to some diseases, as well as therapeutic responses to treatment. Recent data have also suggested that genetic variations may affect the severity of some illnesses, thereby impacting the fi nal outcome of these illnesses. In this chapter, we explore the evidence for whether genetic variation has an impact on critical illness and response to injury. We discuss how genetic variations may infl uence susceptibility to, severity of, and outcome from critical illness and injury and how they may help to identify risk factors for complications in children in the pediatric intensive care unit (PICU).",

            "text": "The sequencing of the human genome has revealed that many genes are polymorphic, that is, there are small differences in DNA sequences among individuals. Polymorphic genes are genes in which variation at a specifi c site is found in greater than 1% of the general population. The sites that are variable within the genes are referred to as polymorphic sites. The polymorphisms in DNA sequences may exist in several forms, with the most frequent form being a single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) caused by a base number of different techniques that have been used for genotyping. Until recently most of these techniques were labor intensive, required experienced personnel, and were not conducive to genotyping many SNPs rapidly. More recently, with the increased interest in SNPs as tools for mapping genes and for candidate gene association studies, techniques for high-throughput SNP genotyping have begun to be developed. As the underlying strategies for the newer high-throughput techniques and the older, more labor intensive techniques are both based fi rst on a reaction that discriminates which nucleotide is present at the polymorphic site and second on a technique that allows the identifi cation of the product of the reaction, we discuss in detail several of the older techniques that are found in much of the literature published thus far to illustrate the general concepts. A brief discussion of high-throughput techniques is included at the end of this section.",

Allelespecifi c primers that are identical except for the last nucleotide are used in the PCR reaction. Polymerase chain reactions generate new pieces of DNA by the addition of nucleotides to the 3\u2032 end of the primer that has hybridized to the DNA of interest, which acts as a template. If there is no match at the 3\u2032 end of the primer, the polymerase extends the primer at a 100-to 10,000-fold lower effi ciency, and no PCR product is detected. If the last nucleotide of the primer hybridizes to the specifi c allele it is designed to detect, a PCR product is formed if the individual has a copy of that allele. Presence or absence of the PCR product is determined by electrophoresis. To genotype an individual using the allele-specifi c PCR technique, two different PCR reactions are performed with one or the other allelespecifi c primer and a second primer common to both reactions.",

Such probes differ only by a single nucleotide (the polymorphic site, which is generally in the middle of the ASO). In the simplest of these types of assays, hybridization conditions are chosen such that each ASO hybridizes only to its specifi c allele. The presence of one mismatched nucleotide is enough to prevent annealing under the hybridization conditions used. The DNA sequence surrounding the polymorphic site determines whether conditions can be identifi ed in which the ASO probe hybridizes only to its matching allele and not to the other allele. If this is not possible, the less stable DNA duplex (that containing the mismatched nucleotide) can be distinguished from the perfect match by its melting temperature (Tm), which is an indicator of the stability of the duplex. The mismatched duplex is less stable and consequently has a lower Tm. This technique, however, is more complicated and time consuming.",

When the T is present, a restriction enzyme recognition site is formed that is cleaved in the presence of the restriction enzyme as determined by gel electrophoresis. If C is present at the site, the restriction enzyme does not cut. (B) Genotyping by allele-specific polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Reactions contain a common primer and an allele-specific primer ending with one of the nucleotides found at the polymorphic site. In this example, the allele-specific primer shown is for the T allele and only extension from the allele-specific primer, not the common primer. If the patient has the T allele, the last nucleotide will hybridize and extension will occur, allowing a productive PCR reaction. If the patient contains the C allele, the last nucleotide of the primer cannot hybridize and extension does not occur, resulting in no PCR product. With this technique two PCR reactions have to be performed with each patient sample. Each reaction contains a common primer and one of the two allele-specific primers. The presence of a PCR product is determined by gel electrophoresis. (C) Genotyping by allelespecific hybridization. Two allele-specific oligonucleotide (ASO) probes are made that are identical except for the polymorphic site. The probes are tagged for visualization as indicated by the stars. Only the allele-specific probe for the T allele is shown. The ASO will hybridize only to the DNA that contains a perfectly matched complementary sequence, in this case the T allele. Although only one reaction is shown (that containing the ASO with the T), two reactions containing the two different ASOs are performed for each patient sample.

This variability in the susceptibility to and outcome from sepsis, which is considered to be the most common cause of death in children in the world, has been attributed to a number of factors. These include the virulence of the etiologic agent and the length of time between onset of symptoms and initiation of treatment. However, the genetic makeup of the host also appears to play an important role in the susceptibility to and the development of sepsis, as well as its severity and outcome. For example, familial studies in which there were deaths due to severe infections demonstrated a strong genetic infl uence [9] . The body's infl ammatory response to bacterial infection fi rst requires recognition of pathogen-associated bacterial products. The initial recognition and the resultant response require dozens of cellular proteins, many of which are polymorphic. Genetic variation within these polymorphic genes may infl uence the overall response to the infection. In this section we discuss the evidence that genetic variability in specifi c genes plays a role in development of sepsis and its outcome [for review, see 10].",

A number of studies suggest that variations in the TLR4 gene can generate variability in susceptibility and/or response to infection. In mice, TLR4 is required for response to LPS [16] , and a single amino acid change can signifi cantly reduce response to LPS [14, 17] and enhance susceptibility to infection. In the human TLR4 gene, two SNPs have been identifi ed that result in the replacement of an aspartic acid at amino acid position 299 with glycine and a threonine at amino acid position 399 with an isoleucine. The Gly299Ile399 variant appears to be expressed at lower levels in human airway epithelia [18] , and a number of studies have demonstrated association of this variant with a reduced response to LPS as determined by examining airway reactivity or systemic cytokine response to inhaled LPS [18] [19] [20] . This variant is also associated with a diminished response to LPS in a transfected cell system using primary human epithelial cells [18] . An association of the TLR4 Gly299Ile399 variant with Gram-negative bacterial infections and septic shock [21, 22] and mortality in systemic infl ammatory response syndrome [23] has also been demonstrated in humans. However, the Gly-299Ile399 variant showed no association with susceptibility to, or severity of, meningococcal disease [24] , although other rare TLR4 mutations have been implicated in meningococcal susceptibility [25] . The lack of any association of the Gly299Ile399 variant with meningococcal disease may be explained by the observation that Neisseria meningitides is capable of eliciting an infl ammatory response via the TLR2 receptor in the absence of LPS [26, 27] .",

These receptors bind to the constant region of IgG and are primarily responsible for the phagocytosis of immunoglobulin G (IgG)-coated bacteria and induction of the infl ammatory response [28, 29] . The human Fc\u03b3 receptors are grouped into three classes, which vary in their affi nity for the various IgG subclasses. The Fc\u03b3RI class consists of the Fc\u03b3RIa receptor; the Fc\u03b3RII class consists of Fc\u03b3RIIa, Fc\u03b3RIIb, and Fc\u03b3RIIc; and the Fc\u03b3RIII class consists of Fc\u03b3RIIIa and Fc\u03b3RIIIb. Genetic polymorphisms affecting function have been described in three of the Fc\u03b3 receptors [29] . The Fc\u03b3RIIIa has a polymorphism at amino acid 158 resulting in either a valine (V) or phenylalanine (F) at this position, which in turn affects its affi nity for IgG 1 , IgG 3 , and IgG 4 [30, 31] . The Fc\u03b3RIIIb has a polymorphism that is a four amino acid substitution (allotypes Fc\u03b3RIIIb-NA1 or -NA2), resulting in differences in glycosylation [32] . This substitution alters the opsonization effi ciency Variants B, C, D Variants associated with decreased levels and activity; associated with increased risk of infection TNF-\u03b1 \u2212308 G/A, others A associated with increased levels; associated with increased mortality in sepsis and meningococcal disease LT-\u03b1 or TNF-\u03b2 LT-\u03b1+250 G/A A associated with increased levels; associated with increased mortality in sepsis and bacteremia IL-1RA Variable 86-bp repeat A2 associated with increased levels of IL-1RA; variable results of association studies examining risk of sepsis and mortality IL-6 \u2212174 G/C G associated with increased IL-6 levels in patients, but C associated with increased levels in monocytes from neonates; associated with sepsis in neonates but not adults IL-10 \u22121082 G/A, \u2212819 C/T, GCC haplotype associated with \u2212592 C/A increased levels; associated with sepsis but not mortality HSP70-2 +1267 G/A G associated with lower mRNA levels; A associated with septic shock in adults with CAP ACE I/D DD associated with increased serum and tissue levels; associated with more severe meningococcal disease PAI-1 4G/5G 4G associated with increased levels; associated with septic shock in meningococcal disease *The terms used for the various polymorphisms are the ones most commonly used in the literature and may refer to the nucleotide position, amino acid position, or name of the allele.

            "text": "required for phagocytosis of IgG 1 -and IgG 3 -opsonized particles [33, 34] . Individuals homozygous for the Fc\u03b3RIIIb-NA1 allotype appear to have more effi cient phagocytosis. The Fc\u03b3RIIa gene has a polymorphic site at amino acid position 131 [35, 36] that results in either a histidine (Fc\u03b3RIIa-H131) or an arginine (Fc\u03b3RIIa-R131) at amino acid position 131. This amino acid is in the extracellular domain of the receptor, and the Fc\u03b3RIIa-R131 allotype binds the Fc portion of IgG 2 with lower affi nity than the more common Fc\u03b3RIIa-H131 allotype [36] . In vitro studies have demonstrated reduced phagocytosis of IgG 2 -opsonized particles in cells from individuals homozygous for Fc\u03b3RIIa-R131 compared with cells from individuals homozygous for Fc\u03b3RIIa-H131 [37, 38] . Immunoglobulin G 2 is the main antibody subtype directed against encapsulated bacteria such as Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus infl uenzae type b, and N. meningitides and plays an important role in their phagocytosis [36, 39, 40] . Studies have examined the association between the presence of the Fc\u03b3RIIa-R131 and/or the Fc\u03b3RIIIb-NA2 polymorphisms in individuals and an increased susceptibility to infections, particularly meningococcal disease. Although the vast majority of reports have shown an association between infection and/or sepsis and the Fc\u03b3RIIa and Fc\u03b3RIIIb polymorphisms, there are two reports where no association was seen [41, 42] . However, in most studies higher frequencies of the Fc\u03b3RIIa-R131/R131 or Fc\u03b3RIIIb-Na2/Na2 genotypes have been found in patients with meningococcal disease [43] [44] [45] [46] [47] [48] , particularly in patients with severe meningococcal disease [45, 46] or fulminant meningococcal septic shock [43, 44] when compared with a healthy control population. An association between the Fc\u03b3RIIa polymorphism and infection with other encapsulated bacteria has also been reported [49, 50] . Thus, genetic variation in the gene coding for at least two of the Fc\u03b3 receptors appears to infl uence the susceptibility to and outcome from infection with encapsulated bacteria. Mannose binding lectin is also involved with the opsonization [51] of bacteria and binds to bacterial surface oligosaccharides Nacetyl glucosamine and mannose [52] . The heterotrimeric MBL protein contains a carbohydrate binding domain and a helical tail domain that is important in polymerization of the three peptides [53] . Polymerization of the heterotrimer is crucial for the stability of MBL. Three genetic polymorphisms have been described in MBL in the amino acids at the positions 52, 54, and 57 (referred to as variants D, C, and B, respectively). These polymorphic sites result in amino acid changes that diminish the ability of the helical tails to polymerize, resulting in an increased degradation of MBL [51, 54, 55] and reduced serum levels of MBL [55] . Studies have demonstrated associations among these MBL genetic polymorphisms and increased susceptibility to infections [56] , hospitalizations because of infections in children [57] , number of acute respiratory infections in children [58] , increased risk for meningococcal infections [59] , susceptibility to infections in patients with systemic lupus erythematosus [60] , increased risk for recurrent respiratory infections [61] , and increased susceptibility to invasive pneumococcal disease even in individuals with at least one copy of the variant polymorphism [62] . Thus, as with the genetic polymorphisms in the genes coding for the Fc\u03b3RIIa and Fc\u03b3RIIIb receptors, there appears to be an association between the MBL genetic variants and susceptibility to bacterial infections.",

This is balanced by the subsequent release of antiinfl ammatory cytokines such as IL-10 and a return to baseline of cytokines and chemokines [63, 64] . It is now generally accepted that an overexaggerated proinfl ammatory response resulting in an imbalance between the proinfl ammatory and antiinfl ammatory cytokines results in the clinical manifestation of severe sepsis and septic shock. The mechanism by which this imbalance occurs leading to exaggerated response is an area of intense research. Genetic variability within genes coding for the proinfl ammatory and antiinfl ammatory cytokines might infl uence this balance and could potentially infl uence the overall susceptibility to and outcome from the sepsis.",

We will discuss the genetic polymorphisms found in the TNF-\u03b1 locus in more detail here and briefl y mention other polymorphisms and association studies. As a proinfl ammatory cytokine, TNF-\u03b1 plays a key role in the pathogenesis of the acute infl ammatory response and is responsible for the activation of the infl ammatory response. Tumor necrosis factor-\u03b1 is also responsible for the development of the harmful effects of the systemic infl ammatory response such as capillary leak, hypotension, acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), and multiple organ system failure [65] [66] [67] [68] [69] . Several SNPs within the regulatory region of the gene coding for TNF-\u03b1 have been identifi ed that impact TNF-\u03b1 production [70] [71] [72] [73] [74] [75] [76] [77] . The most studied are the G to A transitions 308 and 238 base pairs upstream from the transcriptional start site for the TNF-\u03b1 gene. In vitro studies have demonstrated that the rarer TNF-\u03b1-308A allele is associated with increased transcription [77] and increased secretion of TNF-\u03b1 from LPS-stimulated macrophages [72] compared with the more common TNF-\u03b1-308G allele. In contrast, the more common TNF-\u03b1-238G allele is associated with higher TNF-\u03b1 production in vitro compared with the rarer TNF-\u03b1-238A allele [78] . These polymorphisms lie near putative DNA binding sites for several transcription factors, and in vitro studies have demonstrated differential binding of nuclear proteins to DNA fragments containing either an A or a G at the TNF-\u03b1-308 position [79] .",

This site (also referred to as the TNFB allele, LT-\u03b1+250, and TNF-\u03b2+252 site; for this chapter, LT-\u03b1+250 site will be used) is approximately 3.2 kb upstream from the TNF-\u03b1 gene. Higher serum levels of TNF-\u03b1 have been demonstrated in septic patients with the LT-\u03b1+250A allele [73] [74] [75] . Consequently, either this region acts as an enhancer for the TNF-\u03b1 gene, or it is linked to a regulatory region further downstream. In any case, the data from studies of the TNF-\u03b1-308, TNF-\u03b1-238, and LT-\u03b1+250 alleles provide convincing evidence that genetic variation within regulatory regions of the gene coding for TNF-\u03b1 infl uences the amount of TNF-\u03b1 produced.",

Specifi cally, the frequency of the TNF-\u03b1-308A allele is higher in adults who died with septic shock [82] and in children who died from meningococcal disease than in controls [80] . Even those children who were heterozygous at this position (TNF-\u03b1-308 G/A) were at increased risk for more fulminant meningococcal disease and death compared with those children who were homozygous for the wild-type genotype (TNF-\u03b1-308 G/G). At the LT-\u03b1+250 site, analysis of a cohort of adults with communityacquired pneumonia demonstrated that those with the A/A genotype were at greater risk for presenting with the clinical symptoms of sepsis [83] . Patients in postoperative and trauma intensive care units who developed sepsis and were homozygous for the LT-\u03b1+250 A allele have higher levels of TNF-\u03b1 and a higher mortality rate [75, 84, 85] . Similarly, an association among the LT-\u03b1+250 A allele, higher serum levels of TNF-\u03b1, and higher mortality rate in bacteremic children has been observed [73] . Children who were heterozygous at this position (LT-\u03b1+250 GA) had an intermediate mortality rate.

Individuals have been shown to have variable plasma and tissue levels of ACE, and evidence suggests that these variable levels are caused in part by genetic factors [107] . Specifi cally, an insertion (I)/deletion (D) of a 287 base repair repeat sequence in the noncoding intron 16 of the gene coding for ACE [108, 109] is associated with variable plasma levels; individuals with the DD genotype have higher plasma and tissue levels of ACE than individuals who are heterozygous or are homozygous for the insertion sequence [110, 111] .

Diminished activity of anticoagulants, or elevated levels of inhibitors of fi brinolysis, can lead to fi brin deposition and may contribute to multiple organ system failure. Plasminogen activator inhibitor 1 (PAI-1) is an inhibitor of fi brinolysis because of its ability to inhibit the potent fi brinolytic, plasminogen activator. High plasma concentrations of PAI-1 have been observed in sepsis [114] and severe meningococcal disease [115] , and high concentrations are correlated with worse outcome. A single nucleotide I/D polymorphism exists within the promoter region of the gene coding for PAI-1 that appears to infl uence the amount of PAI-1 production, with individuals homozygous for the 4G/4G genotype producing more PAI-1 than either individuals heterozygous (4G/5G) or homozygous for fi ve guanines (5G/5G) [116] . Children with the 4G/4G genotype who had meningococcal disease had higher plasma levels of PAI-1 [117] and an increased risk of death from sepsis than did children with either the 4G/5G or the 5G/5G genotype [117] [118] [119] . This polymorphism is not only associated with outcome from meningococcal disease but appears to be a marker for poor outcome after severe trauma [120] . Thus, there appears to be a strong association between the 4G/4G genotype in the PAI-1 gene, high plasma concentrations of PAI-1, and worse outcome in critical illness.",

Thus, the list of potential genetic polymorphisms that may infl uence respiratory failure is likely to be very diverse.

Indeed, it has been suggested that alterations in surfactant may play important roles in these processes [121, 122] . Surfactant contains four major proteins, A, B, C, and D, which exhibit a variety of functions, including a role in host defenses in the lung [123] [124] [125] [126] [127] [128] and the reduction of surface tension at the airliquid interface. The surfactant protein-A (SP-A) genes as well as SP-B, -C, and -D genes are polymorphic, and polymorphisms in these genes have been associated with lung disease [129] [130] [131] [132] . The polymorphisms in the SP-A genes (A1 and A2) and SP-B gene are the best characterized, and many reports have shown association of these genes with lung disease [130, 131, [133] [134] [135] [136] . We will discuss SP-B and how a common genetic polymorphism in the gene coding for SP-B may infl uence respiratory failure and lung injury in critically ill children.",

We have examined the genetic polymorphism in the SP-B+1580 site in adults with community-acquired pneumonia and demonstrated that a higher percentage of those individuals with the less common C/C genotype developed respiratory failure requiring mechanical ventilation and met the criteria for ARDS compared with those individuals with the T/C or T/T genotypes [154] .

In adults with ARDS, ACE concentrations in bronchoalveolar lavage fl uid are elevated [155] as are the transpulmonary gradient and circulating concentrations of ATII [156] . An association between the D allele, which is associated with higher plasma tissue levels of ACE as described earlier, and ARDS has been observed in adults [157] . A higher percentage of adults with ARDS had the D/D genotype than did adults who were at risk for the development of ARDS, including those who underwent coronary artery bypass graft surgery or were in the ICU for other reasons.

Whether genetic polymorphisms are associated with various complications in the post-operative period in this population is another area of intense research. One of the potential sources of many of the complications observed in the post-operative period may be the release of infl ammatory mediators, including TNF-\u03b1, IL-6, IL-8, and ATII [158] . Studies of adults and children undergoing cardiovascular surgery involving the use of cardiopulmonary bypass have demonstrated a release of proinfl ammatory and antiinfl ammatory cytokines after surgery [159] . Various stimuli have been suggested to initiate cytokine release after cardiopulmonary bypass, including exposure of blood to the foreign surface of the bypass machine, complement activation [160, 161] , ischemia-reperfusion injury [162] , and endotoxin released because of gastrointestinal tract hypoperfusion [163] . Whatever the inciting event, this infl ammatory cascade may result in postoperative complications such as cardiovascular instability, systemic infl ammatory response syndrome, and multiple organ dysfunction [164] [165] [166] . As discussed previously, genetic variation infl uences the levels of many of the proinfl ammatory and antiinfl ammatory cytokines. It is plausible, therefore, that the complications observed in patients after exposure to cardiopulmonary bypass may be, in part, infl uenced by genetic variation.",

Approximately 6% of patients undergoing their fi rst CABG surgery and 11% of those undergoing repeated CABG surgery are unable to be tracheally extubated by 24 hours [167] . The etiologies for prolonged mechanical ventilation include both pulmonary-related (atelectasis, bronchospasm, congestive heart failure [CHF], ARDS, and acute lung injury) and nonpulmonary-related (cerebrovascular accident, cardiogenic shock, and excess postoperative bleeding) events.

This appears to be contrary to the idea that hypersecretion of proinfl ammatory mediators may be detrimental to patients in the postoperative period [174, 175] . Possible explanations for the apparent benefi cial effect of TNF-\u03b1 are that TNF-\u03b1 appears to protect the myocardium from hypoxic insults [176, 177] and that TNF-\u03b1 stimulates protective HSPs [178] [179] [180] .

Concentrations of ACE are elevated after CABG surgery [183] , and these elevated concentrations appear to be infl uenced in part by genetic polymorphisms. Other studies have demonstrated that adults with the D allele had higher mortality and restenosis rates after CABG surgery compared with patients with the I allele [184] . Also, as mentioned previously, the D allele appears to be associated with susceptibility to and prognosis of ARDS [157] , an important cause of prolonged mechanical ventilation in the postoperative period for adults who have undergone CABG surgery. The ACE D allele is also associated with prolonged mechanical ventilation in this population except for patients who had their CABG procedure off-pump [185] .

            "text": "Thromboses in both arteries and veins are signifi cant problems in children in PICUs [186] [187] [188] [189] [190] [191] [192] . These children are exposed to multiple risk factors for thrombosis, including sepsis and central venous catheters, with reports of deep venous thrombosis in 7.5% to 50% of children with central venous catheters [193] [194] [195] [196] . A number of inherited defects in the coagulation and thrombolytic systems also predispose children to thrombosis [197] [198] [199] . These defects can result in hyperactive coagulation, hypoactive anticoagulation, or hypoactive fi brinolysis. Several genetic variations (Table 16. 2) have been identifi ed in genes coding for components of the coagulation system that infl uence the quantity or function of these proteins and have been shown to be signifi cant risk factors for thrombosis [198, 200] . These include variations in genes coding for factor V [201] , prothrombin [202] [203] [204] [205] , antithrombin [206] [207] [208] [209] [210] , protein C [211] [212] [213] [214] [215] , protein S [216] [217] [218] [219] [220] [221] , methylentetrahydrofolate reductase [222] , endothelial nitric oxide synthase [223] [224] [225] , \u03b1-fi brinogen [226] [227] [228] [229] , and factor XIII [228, [230] [231] [232] [233] [234] [235] . However, no researchers have reported the relative risks of these various genetic polymorphisms in the development of thrombosis in children in PICUs. The Arg506Gln polymorphism in the factor V gene (factor V Leiden) has been reported in 13%-45% of pediatric patients with thromboembolism [236] [237] [238] [239] , but this population may not necessarily refl ect the population of PICU patients who also have the other nonhereditary risk factors mentioned earlier. Because the development of thrombosis can be deterred with anticoagulants, knowledge of a child's genetic polymorphisms in the genes coding for components of the coagulation system might identify children who could benefi t most by anticoagulant therapies.",

Pharmacogenomics attempts to determine the genetic factors that affect the various aspects of drug action, including drug transport, binding to receptors and signal transduction, and metabolism. That genetics can infl uence some drug responses was fi rst suggested by associations between inheritance or ethnicity and abnormal drug responses and further defi ned through biochemistry and molecular genetics [for review, see refs. [240] [241] [242] [243] . While the list of genetic polymorphisms in genes coding for drug transporters, receptors, and enzymes involved in drug metabolism is growing rapidly [244] , there are very few examples of genetic polymorphisms that infl uence the action of drugs commonly used in PICUs. The best-described examples of genetic polymorphisms that infl uence drug response are those that are found in genes coding for enzymes involved in drug metabolism (Table 16 .3). One example is briefl y described here in order to demonstrate the clinical relevance of such genetic variations. Thiopurine S-methyltransferase (TPMT) is an enzyme primarily responsible for inactivation of the thiopurines mercaptopurine and azathiopurine used as immunosuppressants and chemotherapeutic drugs. Genetic polymorphisms in the gene coding for TPMT result in a nonfunctioning enzyme; thus, patients receiving mercaptopurine or azathiopurine who inherit the nonfunctional allele accumulate high concentrations of the active metabolites and are at risk for developing life-threatening hematopoietic toxicities [245] [246] [247] . Clinical diagnostic tests are available for detecting the SNPs in the TPMT gene that result in TPMT defi ciency, thereby allowing for the identifi cation of patients at high risk for thiopurine toxicities. Patients receiving mercaptopurine or azathiopurine who are genetically predisposed to be TPMT defi cient have been treated successfully for their oncologic diseases using approximately 5%-10% of the conventional dose of the thiopurines [245, 246] without the toxicities. This represents a good example of modifying drug therapies based on an individual's genetic makeup.",

Substantial variation in \u03b2 2 -AR response between individuals has been observed [250] .

In addition, the two most common SNPs, glycine or arginine at position 16 (Gly16 or Arg16) and glutamic acid or glutamine at position 27 (Glu27 or Gln27), alter the amino acid sequence of the \u03b2 2 -AR, which in turn alters properties of the receptor [251] . More recently, Drysdale et al. [254] genotyped 13 SNPs in \u223c80 individuals and identifi ed 12 different combinations of these individual SNPS in the \u03b2 2 -AR gene, meaning that there are 12 \u03b2 2 -AR haplotypes (and hence alleles). Only one haplotype has Glu at amino acid 27; this is also the only haplotype with C at the \u221247 polymorphic site [254] . The \u03b2 2 -AR variant with C at \u221247 has been shown to express lower levels of the receptor than variants with T at that site [252, 253] .",

            "text": "Studies have investigated the association of \u03b2 2 -AR SNPs with asthma, asthma phenotype, or treatment modalities. Such studies have been performed primarily with single SNPs in the adult Caucasian population. Although there is no strong evidence linking a specifi c \u03b2 2 -AR genotype to asthma, there are a number of studies linking specifi c genotypes to asthma phenotypes [255] [256] [257] [258] [259] [260] . In children there is an association between the homozygous Gly16 genotype and bronchodilator desensitization [261] , and we have recently reported an association of the Gln27Glu genotype with the need for aminophylline treatment in African-American children with status asthmaticus [262] . Aminophylline inhibits phosphodiesterase, the enzyme responsible for degradation of cAMP, and consequently the level of \u03b2 2 -AR-stimulated cAMP is greater and its degradation is delayed, prolonging the elevated cAMP levels in the cell. These results suggest that African-American children with this genotype may have diminished response to \u03b2 2 -agonist therapy and may respond more effectively to treatment with a phosphodiesterase inhibitor in addition to the \u03b2 2 -agonist therapy. One possible explanation for the association of the Gln27Glu genotype with aminophylline treatment is that these patients may have a lower \u03b2 2 -agonist-stimulated cAMP response than patients with the Gln27Gln genotype, and aminophylline addition may be required to increase cAMP to levels that are clinically effi cacious. Presumably the Glu27 variant is responsible, as the need for aminophylline treatment is seen only in patients who have this variant of the receptor. A lower cAMP response could be caused by lower expression of the Glu27 variant, which has been reported in in vitro studies [252, 253] , or by increased desensitization of the \u03b2 2 -AR Glu27 variant, which is still controversial as different studies have concluded that the Glu27 variant undergoes greater [263] or lesser [264] desensitization than the Gln27 variant.",

A few of these limitations are briefl y discussed here, and the reader is referred to a more comprehensive review of these limitations [265] . First, it is important that the correct control population is used in the study. For example, in some sepsis studies the frequency of a polymorphism in the group of patients with sepsis is compared with the frequency of the polymorphism in a healthy control population. However, healthy individuals are not the appropriate control population, as they may not have been exposed to the same pathogens to which the patients with sepsis were exposed. A more appropriate control group for comparison would be a group of patients with a similar infection who did not develop sepsis.",

Carefully controlled studies examining candidate genes alone and in combination with other genes will be required to determine whether patient treatment can be tailored more specifi cally to an individual patient's genetic makeup.",
