In world one, a moral Shangri-La, people are aided by advanced moral technologies and are able to consistently behave morally while expending little effort to do so. In James Hilton\u2019s novel Lost Horizon (1933), Shangri-La is the mythical land of peace, harmony, and happiness that exists hidden away in the mountains of Tibet. In a moral Shangri-La, for example, smart lighting on crowded streets deescalates potentially violent confrontations and robotic diplomats easily negotiate peace processes, etc. World two is similar to our world, where being moral is difficult and people frequently behave badly.",

Your alarm clock uses gentle light and ambient smells to gradually rouse you from your sleep, putting you in a mood of openness to new experiences and giving you an optimistic outlook. Your breakfast is vegan, sustainably sourced, and produced under fair-labor conditions. After undergoing a series of treatments, you have lost your taste for animal products and other foods that have a high carbon footprint. In addition, although foods with a greater environmental impact are available, they are placed on the lowest shelves in the grocery store and the sustainable ones are at eye-level, where you always end up grabbing them. Turning on the television, you are reminded that there has been an earthquake in Indonesia. It is essential to combat the insensitivity, or \u201cpsychic numbing,\u201d felt towards large numbers of victims, and the preference people have for single, identifiable ones (Slovic 2010). Therefore, you take your daily dose of Empathico. Empathico is a personalized drug, which improves one\u2019s ability to overcome insensitivity to large numbers of victims and feelings of \u201ccompassion fatigue\u201d by allowing you to vividly imagine each of them as individuals (Vastfjall et al. 2014).",

Moral technologies include such diverse interventions as moral bioenhancement, nudge-designed environments (from shopping malls and work-places to entire urban landscapes) and policies, ambient persuasive technologies, and social robots designed for moral coaching or advising.1 Ingesting a pharmaceutical that changes one\u2019s brain chemistry or undergoing invasive and potentially risky deep brain stimulation for the purposes of moral improvement raise a specific and complex set of ethical questions. The ethical issues they raise are distinct from those posed by less invasive and risky technological interventions, like a wearable fitness tracker that also automatically reminds one to perform a daily act of kindness. However, they are grouped together here because of their shared purpose, moral improvement, and for the reason that a worry about their interference in moral progress can apply to them all.",

Second, they may assist people in overcoming cognitive and affective limitations and biases that prevent them from fully appreciating a situation\u2019s moral dimensions. There is some evidence, for example, that a feeling of disgust induced by morally irrelevant environmental factors plays a role in the strength of people\u2019s moral judgments (May 2016). Moral technology may serve to dampen or even eliminate this kind of \u201cperformance error\u201d (Ibid). Third, they may simply make it easier for people to make the morally right choice, helping them to overcome ego depletion, for example. Ego depletion is the phenomenon that self-control is a finite resource that can be depleted and then requires time to be restored (Baumeister et al. 1998).2 Beyond this specific phenomenon, moral technologies may help us overcome the deleterious effects of stress, fatigue, hunger, and other sources of weakness of will.",

Oxytocin, which promotes trusting behavior in economic cooperation games, is another drug that leaves Persson and Savulescu optimistic about future research into the biological basis of morality and the potential avenues for bioenhancement (Zak et al. 2004; Kosfeld et al. 2005). Genetic interventions have also been entertained by some as a means of moral enhancement (Faust 2008), as has deep brain stimulation and transcranial brain stimulation (Kadosh et al. 2010).",

What one person or group sees as a moral improvement to behavior or attitudes, may be seen as a sign of moral decay or decline by another.4 The description of moral Shangri-La I presented as well as the description of sample moral technologies appears to assume that there is consensus on the ethical issues, which is not always the case. However, this complication is set aside in this paper, assuming that the moral technologies in this case are those which have latched on to the \u2018right\u2019 moral theories, the relevant values, norms, and principles. Whether or not this is a metaethical possibility is beyond the scope of the argument.",

In a sense, these technologies will allow people to engage in a kind of moral offloading. Just as people can offload certain cognitive tasks, such as keeping track of appointments on the calendar application on their smart phones, the phenomenon of moral offloading is getting machines to do moral work for people in a variety of ways, be it care work, tactful communication, or automatically sending birthday cards (for an example of this phenomenon, see Lee et al. 2017); these technologies will allow them to delegate certain internal moral processes to the environment, a technology, or other kind of intervention. Given these assumptions, the following considers whether or not humanity loses anything valuable when technology makes being moral and behaving morally much easier, eliminating difficult moral deliberation and internal moral struggle.",

Moral struggle can be characterized in an ecumenical way, one that is neutral about moral psychology. It can be characterized by any moral psychological theory, including cognitivist, noncognitivist, hybrid view, or something in between or entirely different. This is because moral struggle is generally accepted as part of what it is that any metaethical or moral psychological theory needs to explain. It is especially important that these theories account for the fact that individuals sometimes, perhaps even often, fail to act in accordance with what they think is the best way to act from a moral perspective. Therefore, whether a theory takes moral judgments to be belief-like mental states or affective, emotion-like mental states, it must still be able to account for weakness of will and the experience of mismatch between one\u2019s moral commitments (however that is construed) and one\u2019s behavior.",

On this view, moral struggle includes experiences associated with traditional notions of weakness of will but can include cases in which one ruminates extensively over what the right course of action actually is, and in the end, one is not sure whether or not one has done well from a moral point of view. Moral struggle can also include the experience of guilt or regret that one may feel looking back at bad moral decisions or failures to act.

It can lead to nurses contemplating leaving their job or the field of nursing altogether (Corley 1995; Hamric and Blackhall 2007). There is also evidence to suggest a positive relationship between moral distress and burnout (Meltzer and Huckabay 2004). This can lead to conscientious objection or whistleblowing with respect to practices nurses find morally unacceptable or problematic (Catlin et al. 2008).",

Moral overload arises in situations in which one\u2019s moral obligations outstrip one\u2019s material resources, either physical or financial (Kuran 1999, p. 233).

Thus, experiencing moral struggle may be a catalyst for new and radical moral innovations; for example, strategies of nonviolent resistance to authoritarian political regimes that have emerged from movements and leaders of movements during times of great inner moral conflict.

This may free the physician to dedicate more of their time and energy to assessing the decision-making capacity of a mildly demented patient to refuse life-saving medical care, a decision with arguably greater moral significance.",

Before such an argument can be made, however, some suggestive evidence is offered that moral technologies and the reduction of moral struggle could indeed have these kinds of effects on well-being and stress. Wilhelm Hoffmann and colleagues have demonstrated that individuals with higher levels of self-control experience higher degrees of momentary positive affect as well as higher overall reported life satisfaction (Hofmann et al. 2014). The fact that both of these measures of well-being are positively correlated to self-control is telling; it weighs against the picture of the highly self-controlled person as one who forgoes momentary pleasures and thus experiences a reduction in positive affect, and instead achieves long-term goals.",

On some readings acquiring virtue is done so that one may live a flourishing life. It is beyond the scope of this paper to discuss these subtleties.

The details of the design, functioning, and psychological impacts of moral technologies are relevant here for the following reason.
