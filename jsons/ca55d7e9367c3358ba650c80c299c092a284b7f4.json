There is hypercoagulability associated with COVID-19 that is likely a \"sepsis-induced coagulopathy\" and may predispose to stroke. The SARS-CoV-2 virus binds to angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) present on brain endothelial and smooth muscle cells. ACE2 is a key part of the renin angiotensin system (RAS) and a counterbalance to angiotensin-converting enzyme 1 (ACE1) and angiotensin II. Angiotensin II is proinflammatory, is vasoconstrictive, and promotes organ damage. Depletion of ACE2 by SARS-CoV-2 may tip the balance in favor of the \"harmful\" ACE1/angiotensin II axis and promote tissue injury including stroke. There is a rationale to continue to treat with tissue plasminogen activator for COVID-19-related stroke and low molecular weight heparinoids may reduce thrombosis and mortality in sepsis-induced coagulopathy.",

SIC is a precursor state to DIC and associated with elevated prothrombin time (PT), elevated D-dimer, and thrombocytopenia, but without hypofibrinogenemia. It is related to an infection-induced systemic inflammatory response with endothelial dysfunction and microthrombosis with organ failure and usually no bleeding [4] . In a multivariate analysis of a retrospective series of 440 severe COVID-19 patients, the predictors of 28-day mortality were age, prothrombin time, D-dimer levels, and thrombocytopenia. Patients with elevated D-dimer or SIC score had lower mortality when treated with heparin (mostly low molecular weight) compared with those not treated with heparin. A case series of 3 patients with respiratory failure and high D-dimer levels reported transient improvement in respiratory parameters with the use of tissue plasminogen activator [5] . The lung pathology in one COVID-19 patient revealed microvascular thrombosis suggesting that the lung microvascular thrombosis in COVID-19 patients may contribute to respiratory failure and ARDS [5] .",

The SARS-CoV-2 virus binds to the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) via its spike (S) protein [9] . Transmembrane protein serine protease 2 (TMPRSS2) is also required for viral entry into cells [10] . Similarly, the virus that caused the SARS pandemic in 2003, SARS-CoV-1, also binds to ACE2 [11, 12] . ACE2 is a dipeptidyl carboxydipeptidase, a homologue of angiotensinconverting enzyme 1 (ACE1), and part of the renin angiotensin system (RAS). Renin secreted from juxtaglomerular cells in the kidney cleaves angiotensinogen produced by the liver to angiotensin I. Angiotensin I is cleaved by ACE1 to angiotensin II. Angiotensin II binds to angiotensin 1 (AT1) and angiotensin 2 (AT2) receptors and its binding to AT1 leads to vasoconstriction, aldosterone secretion with sodium and water retention, proinflammatory and procoagulation effects, and elevated blood pressure. Angiotensin II worsens heart failure and worsens ARDS. AT1 blockers are widely used antihypertensive drugs and have beneficial effects in organ protection including the brain.",

Since ACE2 is expressed by brain endothelium and neurons, it is likely that viral mediated depletion of ACE2 impairs endothelial function and predisposes to or worsens acute stroke (Fig. 1) .",

While there has been some concern that ARBs and ACE inhibitors may be harmful in COVID-19 patients by increasing expression of ACE2 and SARS-CoV-2 binding, a joint statement from the American Heart Association, American College of Cardiology, and Heart Failure Society of American has recommended ARBs and antagonists of the RAS system be continued in COVID-19 patients as they may be effective. https://www.acc.org/latest-in-cardiology/articles/ 2020/03/17/08/59/hfsa-acc-aha-statement-addressesconcerns-re-using-raas-antagonists-in-covid-19",
