Early clinical observations from a small non-randomised trial reported eradication of viral load in 20 patients of 26 treated with HCQ [3]. However, six patients were lost from their treatment arm in this open label, non-randomised, clinical trial (two of whom were admitted to ICU and one died). There was also no clinical benefit analysis, and only short-term follow-up [3]. The details of the Chinese trials are limited: Gao et al. report that CQ is superior to placebo in limiting worsening of pneumonia [4]. At present we await the results of larger trials, which have already started. Since 2020, there have been >20 publications regarding HCQ, CQ and COVID-19, and Ferner and Aronson stated that nearly 80 trials using HCQ or CQ are registered worldwide [8].",

The high-profile claims for the benefits of these drugs have led some individuals to self-medicate, with attendant cardiac and ocular risks.

This highlighted the risks of developing HCQ toxic retinopathy using HCQ/CQ in high doses over long duration for any individual [17]. Currently, there are four main areas to consider regarding the use of HCQ during the COVID-19 pandemic. These include (1) participation in trials to evaluate the use of HCQ in the context of treatment of complications of COVID-19, once admitted to hospital. This might potentially involve taking a moderately high dose such as 600\u2013800 mg, but usually for a short period of time (usually about 10 days); (2) participation in trials evaluating the potential of HCQ as prophylaxis against acquiring COVID-19, which could potentially be long term, with an as yet unknown dose; (3) self-medication without supervision, and no knowledge of the dose and duration, and use of unknown active constituents if the drug is not prescribed and not obtained through regulated channels; (4) current postponement of ongoing HCQ screening and monitoring for patients under chronic treatment, due to the COVID-19 pandemic lockdown with postponement of appointments. Regarding (1) short courses of HCQ would not be expected to confer a high risk, unless there were predisposing comorbidities/susceptibility to HCQ retinopathy. (2) The risk of retinal toxicity would depend on how long, and what total dosage was taken. (3) This is probably the risk with the highest concern that individuals who are unaware of the risks of retinal toxicity may be taking HCQ because, influenced by high-profile news regarding its potential, they are taking these drugs with no monitoring and no advice regarding dosage, potentially leading to cases of retinal toxicity. (4) Regarding postponement of screening: it is expected that this would be low risk; patients will be reviewed once it is deemed safe for them to attend. However, patients should be informed that if they notice any new deterioration in their vision that they should contact their local Eye Department.",
