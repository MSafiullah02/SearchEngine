Even in the indoor environment, the volatile organic compounds used in building materials that cause the so-called \u201csick-house syndrome\u201d have caused serious health problems. Also, contagious diseases such as SARS and bird influenza viruses as well as toxic molds can be easily spread through air. To address these concerns, various air cleaners have been developed and even commercialized. However, most air cleaners use activated carbon and adsorption materials in which the initial adsorptive performance is superior but slowly decreases and finally disappears. Also, unpleasant odors are inevitably caused by the desorption of these adsorptive materials. The used adsorption materials then become industrial waste, leading to greater environmental problems. For this reason, it is necessary to develop air purification systems that do not use such waste-producing adsorption methods as well as find new energy resources that are clean and safe. Photocatalytic reactions using ultraviolet light irradiation that can render toxic or odorous organic compounds harmless are considered a promising field of research in the development of new purification methods to replace conventional adsorption systems.",

However, powdered TiO2 was not easy to use and various binder materials have to be combined to fix or immobilize a powdered photocatalyst onto substrate materials. The binder materials, however, decrease the photocatalytic reactivity of the TiO2 itself since they act as a physical covering while the mechanical strength of the photocatalyst is also weakened.",

            "text": "Highly active \u201crectangular column-structured TiO2 crystals\u201d which could be anchored onto silica sheets were developed. The rectangular column-structured TiO2 crystals could be anchored perpendicularly onto a silica fiber substrate in a very dense state with stable chemical bonds. The TiO2 crystals had a width of 100\u2013500 nm and length of 1,000\u20135,000 nm, with anatase TiO2 nanoparticles of 10\u201330 nm. Moreover, the rectangular columnar crystals were observed to have a hollow structure. Investigations on the complete oxidation reaction of acetaldehyde into CO2 with these rectangular column-structured TiO2 photocatalysts showed a high performance equivalent to or even higher than the most efficient standard P-25 powdered photocatalysts. Thus, effective and stable air purifying systems could be successfully developed with the incorporation of these TiO2 photocatalyst sheets for the complete oxidation of organic compounds and bacteria in the gas phase.",
