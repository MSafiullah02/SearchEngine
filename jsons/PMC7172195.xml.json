            "text": "Hepadnaviruses (family Hepadnaviridae) are characterized by partially circular, double-stranded DNA genomes (~3.2 kb in length). Interestingly, the replication of these viruses requires an RNA intermediate produced by reverse transcription (Urban et al., 2010). At present, the Hepadnaviridae are classified into three genera: Avihepadnavirus, Orthohepdnavirus and one unassigned genus (https://talk.ictvonline.org/taxonomy/). As their names imply, avihepadnaviruses have been identified in birds (e.g. ducks and parrots) while orthohepadnaviruses are associated with mammals, including human hepatitis B virus (HBV). The unassigned genus contains two hepadnavirus species found in fish - white sucker hepatitis B virus and bluegill hepatitis B virus - and a single virus associated with the Tibetan frog (Tibetan frog hepatitis B virus). Recently, highly divergent non-enveloped viruses that are the sister-group to the hepadnaviruses, denoted the nackednaviruses, were discovered in fish (Lauber et al., 2017). Despite their diversity, all members of the mammalian genus Orthohepadnavirus contain four overlapped open reading frames (ORFs): polymerase (P), core protein (C), surface protein (S) and X protein. The large S mRNA is thought to encode three proteins - the preS1, preS2 and S. The preS1 is a domain involved in virus-host interaction via cell receptors (Neurath et al., 1986).",

While the majority of human pathogens causing emerging infectious diseases have an animal origin (Wolfe et al., 2007), the host range of the known orthohepadnavirus is limited and the evolutionary history of orthohepadnavirus is therefore unclear. Although rodents comprise approximately 42% of living mammalian species (Wilson and Reeder, 2005), to date only ground squirrels (genus Marmota) appear to be natural rodent hosts of the virus (Summers et al., 1978, Marion et al., 1980, Testut et al., 1996). Similarly, bats comprise around 20% of living mammalian species and are also natural hepadnavirus reservoirs (He et al., 2013, He et al., 2015, Drexler et al., 2013, Wang et al., 2017a, Nie et al., 2018). Although a divergent orthohepadnavirus was recently identified in domestic cats (cat hepadnavirus, CHV) (Aghazadeh et al., 2018), the only other mammalian species that appear to be natural hosts of orthohepadnavirus are primates, including divergent viruses present in the woolly monkey (WMHBV) (Lanford et al., 1998, Rasche et al., 2016) and capuchin monkey (CMHBV) (de Carvalho Dominguez Souza et al., 2018). Importantly, a phylogenetically distinct virus harboured by tent-making bats (TBHBV) has the ability to infect human hepatocytes (Drexler et al., 2013). Interestingly, those viruses harboured by rodents, woolly monkey, capuchin monkey and tent-making bat were all identified in New World species (Rasche et al., 2016).",

While rodents and bats are recognised as important hosts of zoonotic pathogens, including lassavirus (Smith and Wang, 2013), filoviruses (Smith and Wang, 2013), hantaviruses (Guo et al., 2013) and coronaviruses (Wang et al., 2015, Lin et al., 2017, Woo et al., 2012), relatively little is known about the role played by shrews in shaping virus diversity, evolution and transmission. Recently, several viruses - arenaviruses (Li et al., 2015), coronaviruses (Wang et al., 2017b), hantaviruses (Lin et al., 2014, Radosa et al., 2013, Zhang, 2014) and rotaviruses (Li et al., 2016) - have been discovered in shrews. The shrew arenavirus is particularly important as it is considered a zoonotic pathogen that could infect humans causing fever and respiratory symptoms (Blasdell et al., 2016). Hence, shrews may be key hosts for a diversity of RNA viruses of which only a tiny proportion have been sampled to date (Wang et al., 2017b), but have been largely neglected as reservoirs for infectious agents.",

(2014) and Wencheng county (\nFig. 1). A total of 200 Anourosorex squamipes and 39 Crocidura attenuata were captured from Wufeng, eight Crocidura attenuata from Xingshan, 32 Crocidura lasiura from Cixi, and 60 and 110 Suncus murinus from Longwan and Wencheng, respectively (\nTable 1). Shrews were identified to the species level by sequencing of the mitochondrial b (mt-cyt b) gene following morphological identification. Liver tissues were collected from all sampled animals to screen for hepadnaviruses by amplifying a 360-bp fragment of the hepadnavirus polymerase (P) gene. Of 449 shrews screened, eight were found to be positive for hepadnavirus, with a total detection rate of 1.8%. Separated by species, the viral positive rate was 2.5% in Anourosorex squamipes (Wufeng, Hubei province), 4.3% in Crocidura attenuate (Wufeng, Hubei province), and 3.1% in Crocidura lasiura (Cixi, Zhejiang province) (Table 1). Interestingly, the virus was only identified at two sampling sites, Wufeng and Cixi, with positive rates of 2.9% and 3.1%, respectively. Five complete genomes were successfully recovered from the hepadnavirus positive samples collected in Cixi (Cixi-Cl-88) and Wufeng (Wufeng-Ca-70, Wufeng-Ca-111, Wufeng-As-178, Wufeng-As-205) based on host species and sampling sites (Table 1).",

In the full genome tree (Fig. 2), SHBVs and other orthohepadnaviruses largely clustered according to their host order (with the exception of bats) and could be grouped into six lineages: (i) primate, (ii) bat (Old World), (iii) cat, rodent, (iv) shrew, and (v) Tent-making bat (New World). Notably, the novel shrew hepadnaviruses formed a distinct clade within the orthohepadnaviruses, and grouped with TBHBV sampled from New World bats (Uroderma bilobatum) in Panama (Drexler et al., 2013) with strong bootstrap support, although separated by a long branch. Additionally, the phylogenies based on both polymerase and core genes had the same grouping as seen in the whole genome, with SHBV forming a clade with TBHBV (Fig. 3). The only tree in which SHBV exhibited a different phylogenetic position was that for the surface protein, in which SHBV and TBHBV did not group together, with the shrew viruses falling in a well-supported basal phylogenetic position (Fig. 3). Although this topological movement is suggestive of inter-genic recombination, no statistically significant evidence for recombination was found using the RDP and Simplot recombination analyses (Fig. S4). The conflicting signals among gene trees may in part reflect the short alignment lengths and the highly divergent sequences involved. Finally, it is notable that the newly discovered shrew hepadnaviruses formed two lineages according to their geographic origins rather than their host species (Fig. 3), indicative of a local cross-species transmission event.",

This reveals relatively frequent cross-species virus transmission both the family and order levels. Similarly, a co-phylogenetic analysis of all orthohepadnaviruses and their hosts using two methods (a distance-based method and a heuristic event-based method) revealed that co-divergence was evident overall (p < 0.02, copycat), but that cross-species events occurred frequently on this background of long-term virus-host associations (p < 0.01) (Fig. S1).",

However, SHBV showed fewer conserved amino acid residues with primate HBV than TBHBV in main receptor binding region (\nFig. 6). Specifically, the shrew viruses had only three (NPLXXXXXX) and four amino acid residues (XXDWD and XXXXXXXXXXXXXG) that were conserved with primate viruses in the essential domain (NPLGFFPDH) and adjacent accessory domains (NPDWD and NKDHWPEANKVGVG). Additionally, TBHBV and orangutan HBV exhibited more conserved amino acid residues than SHBV, with two and one mutant residues in essential domain, respectively. Notably, although there were some differences between SHBV and HBV in the \"a\" determinant region (aa 99\u2013172), SHBV had no mutation at key cysteine residues (aa 121, 124, 137, 138, 139, 147 and 149) which play a crucial role associated with the entry of HBV into human hepatocytes (Abou-Jaoude and Sureau, 2007).

According to the proposals for the delineation of recent bat hepadnaviruses species, viruses with greater than 20% genome divergence and a new host species may represent new viral species. Hence, the SHBV identified in this study is sufficiently genetically divergent to be considered a new species of the genus Orthohepadnavirus.",

Although co-divergence and cross-species transmission have both been reported in primate hepadnaviruses (Geoghegan et al., 2017, Rasche et al., 2016, Locarnini et al., 2013, Littlejohn et al., 2016), both in this and our previous study of bat hepadnaviruses (Nie et al., 2018) revealed that cross-species transmission was commonplace. The SHBVs newly identified here were found in three shrew species from two subfamilies (Fig. 2). Notably, they clustered according to their geographic origins rather than their host species, again indicative of the cross-species hepadnavirus transmission in shrews. Indeed, our additional analysis of all known hepadnaviruses revealed cross-species transmission at both the family and order levels. Thus, like RNA viruses (Shi et al., 2016, Shi et al., 2018), the evolutionary history of hepadnaviruses is likely characterized by the occurrence of cross-species virus transmission on a background of virus-host co-divergence.",

However, the SHBV identified in this study were from shrews captured in China (Old World) and fell as a sister group to TBHBV in the genome phylogeny. This argues against a New World origin, as does the very deep phylogenetic position of the newly identified cat hepadnavirus identified in Australia (Aghazadeh et al., 2018). Moreover, SHBV was discovered in multiple shrew species and at more than one sampling site (two distant sampling sites, >1200 km), indicating that SHBV has likely been present in these animals for an extended time period. Similarly, the hepadnaviruses discovered in Rhinolophus ferrumequinum bats sampled from Henan province, China clustered with the RBHBV and HBHBV identified in bats sampled from West Africa (Nie et al., 2018), and the ancestor of Noctilionoidea (U. bilobatum belongs) has been proposed to have an Old Word origin (Teeling et al., 2005), again indicative of a long evolutionary history. The virus positive shrew species identified here, Anourosorex squamipes, Crocidura attenuate and Crocidura lasiura, have only been identified in the Old World (http://oldredlist.iucnredlist.org/), and although 170 Asian house shrews were captured (37.9% of all shrew samples) in this study, no virus positive samples were identified in this globally distributed shrew species. In sum, more data is clearly needed to resolve the geographic origins of the hepadnaviruses.",

However, these mammals have attracted far less attention in studies of virus emergence, transmission and evolution. In recent years, however, the discovery of several viruses in shrews have highlighted their potential as virus hosts (Wang et al., 2017b, Tsoleridis et al., 2016, Li et al., 2015, Li et al., 2016, Zhang, 2014). We identified a novel and divergent orthohepadnavirus, SHBV, in three species of shrews sampled from two counties in China, but not in mice and rats captured from the same location. We therefore propose that shrews are likely to comprise natural host of hepadnaviruses and that other shrew species should be investigated to understand their potential role in virus evolution and transmission.",
