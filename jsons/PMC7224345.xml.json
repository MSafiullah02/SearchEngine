The \u201cflatten the curve\u201d graph, whose origin can be traced back to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC 2007), has become a popular visualization tool in the midst of COVID-19 pandemic to explain the benefits of containment, suppression, and mitigation measures. Since CDC developed the graph, several versions were created such as the use of different color shadings to contrast the epidemic waves associated with different intervention scenarios (see for example, London and Milan 2020). Furthermore, in a Twitter post by Harris (2020), a horizontal line was added to represent the healthcare system capacity, which was featured in a New York Times article (Roberts 2020). Animation has also been created to illustrate ways with which the curve can be flattened (Wiles 2020; Stevens 2020).",

The WEIGHT is an acronym that partitions disaster risk management into systems (Workforce, Economy, Infrastructure) and context (Geography, Hierarchy, Time). Nonetheless, the specific focus of the perspective shall be on the analysis of the economic losses that may arise from pandemic-related workforce absenteeism. Workforce recovery analysis in the context of disaster preparedness deserves an equitable level of importance and emphasis placed on critical infrastructure systems. Disaster management often tends to focus more on restoring damaged infrastructure systems to their pre-disaster levels, consequently leaving relatively less attention on managing losses that could stem from workforce disruptions and related factors. The analysis of workforce recovery relative to critical infrastructure protection still remains underdeveloped. In contrast to the numerous publications on infrastructure systems in the context of disaster risk management, a disproportionately low number of disaster-related research articles focus on the workforce.1",

            "text": "Containment is the approach of managing individual infection chains (e.g., broad testing, contact tracing, isolation of travelers coming from high-prevalence areas, travel restrictions, among others). Containment is effective only when applied prior to the occurrence of community transmission, or after community transmission has been adequately suppressed. On the other hand, suppression aims to decrease the basic reproduction number (denoted by R0 in epidemiology literature) to a value lower than 1 and bring community transmission down to levels where implementation of containment will be feasible. Suppression measures are more aggressive and are typically applied at the early onset of the outbreak to keep infections to a minimum (Pueyo 2020). Suppression measure include mandated quarantine2 in addition to implementing some of the containment measures like broad testing and travel restrictions). Furthermore, enforcement of quarantine would consequently lead to suspension of business and school operations, as well as large gatherings, during the pandemic period. Although both containment and suppression measures can be effective in decreasing the duration of the first wave, the likelihood and severity of a second or subsequent waves can be more extreme in the absence of vaccines, relative to mitigation. Finally, mitigation (\u201cflatten the curve\u201d) does not aim to completely stop the transmission, but to lower R0 enough sufficiently that the medical system can handle peak demand. Mitigation measures aim to delay further spread of the disease such as social distancing, personal protective equipment (PPE), and hand hygiene. The advantages are that it requires less extreme restriction on contact, and that at the end of mitigation phase enough people would have contracted the virus, developed herd immunity, and are at a low or negligible risk of reinfection.",

A vast majority of the previous literature focused on workforce absenteeism due to personal illness or provision of care to sick family members. Nonetheless, the phenomenon of \u201cforced\u201d workforce absenteeism is unprecedented and is an area that has gained attention due to the COVID-19 pandemic.

This is typically referred to as epidemic curve (or epi curve). An epi curve can be constructed from data published by health agencies and research institutions.3 Typically, the y-axis of an epi curve shows the number of people infected by the disease, while the x-axis depicts the time in days. The daily number of new infections can be expressed in terms of a percentage relative to the population of the affected region. This percentage is typically referred to as the attack rate4 in epidemiological literature.

This can be done by computing the ratio of the contribution of workforce relative to the total production output of each sector. Economic sectors and infrastructure systems depend on their workforce in varying degrees. As the level of labor dependence increases for a sector, its expected economic loss is also expected to rise in the event of workforce-debilitating events, like pandemics. Some sectors are less labor-intensive than others. A case in point, automation in sectors such as advanced manufacturing has reduced dependence on workforce, which were traditionally labor-intensive. Furthermore, it is possible to account for the flexibility of some economic sectors to perform workforce continuity strategies (e.g., teleworking), in which healthy workers in quarantine are assumed to be able to work remotely; hence reducing the impact of business closures.",

Simulation results indicate that strict suppression measures can significantly flatten the curve (James et al. 2020). In addition to relieving the pressure off the healthcare system, such measures can also decrease the expected economic loss relative to the baseline (Orsi and Santos 2010). This result may be counterintuitive at first since suppression measures (e.g., quarantine, travel restrictions, and business closures, among others) arguably generate costly opportunity losses. Nonetheless, the baseline scenario\u2014which assumes significantly fewer closures\u2014may lead to steeper and faster incidences of absenteeism due to more workers getting sick, caring for sick family members, or worse, dying\u2014ultimately creating a surge in economic losses. Consistently, findings from the research work of Sergio Correia et al. (2020) concluded that US cities that implemented more aggressive and prolonged social distancing measures emerged with higher employment growth rates several years after the 1918 Spanish Flu pandemic. Nonetheless, an important caveat has to be made with the complexities and uncertainties surrounding COVID-19. To wit, steep escalation of unemployment rates and sector-specific losses are currently being experienced worldwide and there will come a point in time that prolonged implementation of suppression and mitigation measures may result in global economic collapse. Hence, government assistance and creative approaches6 have to be put in place to cushion the losses to vulnerable sectors such as restaurants, retail stores, personal care services, and entertainment, among others.",

Alafrangy (2020), who worked in NASA\u2019s Human Exploration Research Analog (HERA) project, relayed his first-hand experience living in a confined environment for 45 days:The impact of isolation on humans, which are by nature social beings, can be profound. My time in HERA allowed me to develop a few techniques to mitigate the effects of isolation, which can be applicable to the current COVID-19 situation. I learned that following a strict schedule helped me keep busy and remain active. As the days and weeks went by, I noticed my progress with various tasks and experiments, which undoubtedly fueled me with energy and focus to keep going. Conflict within confinement is bound to arise as nobody is immune to it. It is not difficult, however, to understand that this isolation affects everyone, and that people may react differently.",

However, containment, suppression, and mitigation measures are not a panacea. They may work effectively in the current wave but will not guarantee the avoidance of future waves. Hence, vaccines, antivirals, and other pharmaceutical interventions need to be developed at the quickest time possible to thwart the potential resurgence of the virus. Furthermore, government officials and policymakers also need to be mindful of other negative side effects of pandemic interventions. To wit, enforcement of quarantine may further expose and amplify the inequality across various socioeconomic segments of the population. The impact of COVID-19 on lower income groups has been found to be much more profound, further impeding their ability to access basic resources, employment, as well as services such as healthcare and online education, among others. Studies also have indicated that low-income groups are more susceptible to contracting the disease itself, which further compounds the socioeconomic disparities associated with COVID-19.",
