This will be realised by considering infection from an ecological perspective; that is, the world is a changing and dynamic community of organisms, of which humans are only a very small part. It is this aspect that makes treating infectious diseases so challenging, because infections are the result of an interaction between two organisms, both of which are evolving to exploit or reject the other. Consequently, the relationship is ever changing and dynamic; in the case of humans, this is most notably being seen in the development of immunity throughout the lifespan. Although some microorganisms can cause disease, most do not, and seeing all microorganisms as dangerous is to misunderstand our relationship with them and reliance upon them. As will be explained, most microorganisms on the planet live in the soil and in the sea and will never encounter a human, let alone cause infection. For those that do, and in terms of understanding how infections are treated, the focus throughout is on a concept known as selective toxicity: how can we damage or inhibit the infecting microorganism without damaging the host?", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Introduction"}, {"text": "Because there are general principles that apply across the different groups of microorganism, each group will be considered in turn, starting with bacteria and viruses which cause most infections. These are followed by fungi, and finally protozoa and helminths, which are only briefly referred to because severe diseases caused by these are rare in most developed countries, although globally protozoa such as those that cause malaria are a major problem. Throughout the chapter, the reader is asked to consider the vital question above; how can we damage or inhibit the infecting microorganism without damaging the host?", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Introduction"}, {"text": "The world in which we live is a complex and diverse one containing many different species and communities of different organisms. It is estimated that there are around 4-6 \u00d7 10 30 prokaryotes in the world (these are non-nucleated organsisms and comprise bacteria and archea), in contrast to the approximately 7.7 \u00d7 10 9 (7.7 billion) humans (Whitman et al. 1998) . Fortunately, very few microorganisms cause disease; it has been estimated that there are in the region 1407 pathogenic species of organism, of which bacteria comprise 538, fungi 307, helminths 287, viruses 208, and protozoa 57 (Woolhouse and Gowtage-Sequeria 2005) . Although this estimate is somewhat elderly and probably underestimates this number, even doubling this would still represent a small proportion of the total number of organisms. Some of these, around 816, are shared with animals, known as zoonoses; and around 13% are new or re-emerging pathogens. Recently, emerged diseases include human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), while other infections such as tuberculosis (TB) and influenza continue to circulate and in the case of influenza to evolve and change at a rapid rate. The human body is similarly diverse, providing a home for many different types and species of microorganism. In most cases, these organisms receive benefit from the relationship without causing any harm to the host, the technical term for this being that they are commensal. This is in contrast with mutual relationships where both benefit, or parasitic ones where one benefits but damages the other. Some parts of the body have a large number of organisms, while others are normally sterile, examples of the latter being most internal organs, bones and the blood and central nervous system. If microorganisms do infect these normally sterile sites, the resulting infection is known as an invasive infection. Because this means that microorganisms have gained access to a normally sterile site, such infections are often associated with injury or serious disease. Many of the most serious infections such as meningitis, septicaemia and osteomyelitis are invasive infections.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 341, "end": 362, "text": "(Whitman et al. 1998)", "ref_id": "BIBREF29"}, {"start": 592, "end": 629, "text": "(Woolhouse and Gowtage-Sequeria 2005)", "ref_id": "BIBREF30"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Microbial Ecology"}, {"text": "The normal range of microorganisms found in a particular part of the body is known as the flora or microbiome, and sometimes these play an important part in host defence, for example, the normal microbiome of the gastrointestinal tract is important in preventing pathogens from colonising and growing in the gastrointestinal tract, and one of the main risk factors for Clostridium difficile infection is the use of broad spectrum antimicrobials that damage this flora. Maintenance of a healthy and balanced flora is important for this and other reasons, for example, it is thought that it helps to regulate the immune system and reduce the risk of allergy (Belkaid and Hand 2014) . In addition to not using antibiotics unnecessarily, other factors such as diet may be important, this being the rationale for the use of pre-and probiotics; prebiotics being non-digestible substances that encourage a healthy flora, while probiotics are the organisms themselves (sometimes referred to in advertising as 'friendly' or 'good' bacteria).", "cite_spans": [{"start": 656, "end": 679, "text": "(Belkaid and Hand 2014)", "ref_id": "BIBREF2"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Microbial Ecology"}, {"text": "The aim of antimicrobial therapy is to kill or inhibit the infecting organism without damaging the host; this is known as selective toxicity. This is commonly accomplished through the use of antimicrobial drugs.

This definition excludes completely synthetic products which are antimicrobials, a broader term referring to any substance that has this effect.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Treating Infections: Selective Toxicity"}, {"text": "Many of the antimicrobials in common use are true antibiotics, being isolated from bacteria and fungi, but some are not. For example, penicillin is made by a number of fungi in the genus Penicillium and vancomycin by a bacterium known as Amycolatopsis orientalis, and both are therefore true antibiotics, while ciprofloxacin and linezolid are synthetic products and so are technically antimicrobials. Some drugs, such as the newer penicillins, are semi-synthetic, which means that they have a natural base that has been altered synthetically. In practice this makes very little difference, but it does have implications for the development of resistance, as it means that some resistance genes are found in the producing organism or the environment; for example, a bacterium producing an antibacterial substance must itself be resistant to the substance it is producing if it is not to kill itself. From a resistance perspective, this becomes problematic if these resistance genes spread into medically significant bacteria (Davies and Davies 2010) .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 1024, "end": 1048, "text": "(Davies and Davies 2010)", "ref_id": "BIBREF8"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Treating Infections: Selective Toxicity"}, {"text": "The aim of selective toxicity means that pharmaceutical companies developing antimicrobials have to identify structures or metabolic processes in the microorganism that is different to or absent from the host. In the case of bacteria, our evolutionary relationship is distant meaning we have had a lot of time to evolve to be different and there are many selective targets; however, this is not the case with fungi to which we are relatively similar on a cellular basis. Viruses present a more difficult problem again, as they do not have their own metabolic or growth capabilities; instead, they use those of the host cell; technically, they are known as obligate intracellular organisms. Therefore, damaging viruses or preventing their growth usually means damaging the infected host cells, and while the immune system is able to differentiate infected from non-infected cells, it is more difficult to find drugs that are able to do this. This explains why drug formularies contain many antibacterial drugs and far fewer antifungal and antiviral drugs and why some of the latter are associated with the toxicities and adverse effects resulting from poor selective toxicity; that is they damage the microorganism but also the host. Protozoa are even more problematic because they often have a complex life cycle, are relatively similar to human cells in many respects, and are often found in developing countries with limited healthcare budgets.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Treating Infections: Selective Toxicity"}, {"text": "Many serious infections are caused by bacteria, and the first task in their treatment is their identification. There are many ways of identifying bacteria, for example, by shape; by their ability to take up and retain certain stains (e.g. Gram's stain); by their susceptibility to antimicrobials (antibiogram); or, increasingly, by molecular methods. The first three of these are known as phenotypic traits, that is, they are observable characteristics; the latter are genotypic, being based on bacterial genetics. Although most tests used in everyday practice identify phenotypic characteristics, molecular and genetic methods such as the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) are becoming increasingly important. Bacteria are prokaryotes, that is, they do not have a nucleus and, consequently, are relatively simple organisms. Because they are only distantly related to humans, there are a lot of selective targets, some of the more important of which are shown in Table 6 .1. The bacterial cell wall is an important target because it is a structure that is lacking from human cells and is made of a substance known as peptidoglycan, which again human cells do not have; thus, it is a very good selective target. Bacterial ribosomes are a target not because these are lacking in humans, but because they are of different sizes, so most drugs that bind to bacterial ribosomes do not bind to the human equivalents. Similarly, some of the enzymes involved in the reproduction of bacterial nucleic acid are different to their equivalents in humans. Folic acid synthesis is an example of a metabolic process that differs between bacteria and humans; while bacteria synthesise their own folic acid, humans gain theirs from the diet. Hence, blocking the synthesis of folic acid production is selective against bacteria. The evolutionarily distant relationship of bacteria to humans means that there are lots of differences between human and bacterial cells and so lots of selective targets. However, the clinician still needs to identify the infecting organism, establish the best treatment and deliver that treatment in a way that can resolve the infection. Although the details differ, many of these principles are common to most infections and are considered later in the chapter.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [{"start": 961, "end": 968, "text": "Table 6", "ref_id": "TABREF0"}], "section": "Bacteria"}, {"text": "Because fungi are relatively closely related to humans, compared to bacteria, they have had less time to evolve differences, and so fewer selective targets exist (Table 6 .2). This means that there are far fewer drugs to treat fungal infections than there are to treat bacterial infections, and many of those which do exist, particularly older antifungal drugs, have toxicities associated with them. A further complication is that many people who have severe systemic fungal diseases also have comorbidities, in particular, immunodeficiencies, further compromising the ability to treat the infection. Fungi can take two main forms: a yeast-like form that usually grows on surfaces and a hyphal form where it grows as finger-like projections that can force their way between cells and so become invasive; this is sometimes referred to as being a 'mould' (one may see these growing on bread). Candida species are examples of the former, and Aspergillus the latter; in addition, some fungi can take both forms known as dimorphic fungi. Most antifungal agents work by inhibiting the cell wall or membrane which is the main difference between fungal and human cells. Human cells do not have a cell wall, and the fungal cell wall, which contains glucan and chitin, is the target for a range of drugs. The other main target is ergosterol which is a component of the fungal cell membrane, a structure that humans do have, but in fungi the membrane sterol is ergosterol, in humans the equivalent is cholesterol. Although there is a difference between these two sterols, the difference is not great, reducing the selective toxicity and explaining some of the toxicities associated with the main drugs that bind to this, the polyene drugs amphotericin B and nystatin. Amphotericin, which has historically been the most important drug for treatment of severe fungal disease, has a range of toxicities including nausea, vomiting, rigours, fever and hypotension or hypertension. However, of most concern is its effect upon the renal system, where it can cause nephrotoxicity, particularly in those individuals with existing renal problems, on high doses, who are dehydrated or on other nephrotoxic drugs (Laniado-Labor\u00edn and Cabrales-Vargas 2009).", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [{"start": 162, "end": 170, "text": "(Table 6", "ref_id": "TABREF0"}], "section": "Fungi"}, {"text": "These adverse effects are reduced in those drugs that inhibit its production rather than bind to it and in liposomal preparations where the amphotericin molecules are enclosed in a lipid membrane. Additionally, polyenes are not absorbed through the gastrointestinal tract, making nystatin a safe drug for the topical treatment of superficial fungal infections. Less commonly used drugs include flucytosine which inhibits fungal nucleic acid synthesis, griseofulvin which has the same effect upon microtubules and the polyoxins and nikkomycin which inhibit chitin in the fungal cell wall (Kathiravan et al. 2012 ).", "cite_spans": [{"start": 587, "end": 610, "text": "(Kathiravan et al. 2012", "ref_id": "BIBREF15"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Fungi"}, {"text": "Viruses are simple organisms that have no metabolism of their own. Consequently, they have to use the metabolism of host cells to replicate, making them obligate intracellular pathogens. This is problematic for treating viral infections because it means there are few selective targets, and while the immune system is able to differentiate infected from non-infected cells, it is hard to produce drugs that can damage or inhibit infected cells while leaving uninfected cells alone; and targeting all cells would lead to severe toxicity or even death. Consequently, most therapies in this area have tended to maximise immunity through immunisation rather than treat established infections. Viruses that can most successfully be treated are usually those which have something in their structure or replication cycle which is different to or not found in human cells. The first viruses to be successfully treated were the herpes viruses, in particular, cytomegalovirus (CMV), varicella-zoster virus (VZV) and herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV1) and type 2 (HSV2). These can be treated using drugs such as acyclovir that inhibit viral DNA polymerase, which is the enzyme that copies viral DNA during replication. Its selective toxicity stems from its specificity for the viral polymerase rather than the human equivalent, and because the drugs are inactive in the form given needing to be activated by phosphorylation which is preferentially done by a viral enzyme known as thymidine kinase. Although humans also have this enzyme, the drug is specific for the viral version, hence its selective toxicity.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Viruses"}, {"text": "The treatment of influenza has undergone major changes in recent years.

Although human cells make DNA copies of DNA when cells replicate and RNA copies of DNA for protein production, they never convert RNA to DNA in the way that retroviruses such as HIV do, and because of this reverse transcriptase is a highly selective and important target for anti-HIV drugs. There are two groups of drugs that target this enzyme, the nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTI) and the non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NNRTI).

There are a number of different types of such genetic elements, the most complex being plasmids which may contain many different genes, and acquisition of such a plasmid by a bacterium might confer multiple resistances upon that bacterium. Plasmids may also contain genes encoding for toxins, in which case the bacterium may be capable of causing severe disease. The development of resistance is almost inevitable when antimicrobials are used. This is because populations of microorganisms are heterogenous, that is to say all are a little different; for example, some will be very susceptible to an antimicrobial, while others may be a less susceptible. This is sometimes referred to as heteroresistance. Often a resistance mechanism reduces growth rates of organisms that have it, meaning that they are less likely to predominate than their susceptible equivalents. For example, a thickened cell-wall might reduce susceptibility but it might also take longer to grow. However, the use of that antimicrobial, particularly if the dose is not sufficient or it is not given for sufficient time may result in it killing the susceptible organisms but not the less susceptible ones, turning the disadvantage of resistance into an advantage and allowing them to 'take over'. Over time this leads to selection of resistant organism, the use of the antimicrobial resulting in 'selection pressure' for resistance. Although this may seem complicated, it is a simple Darwinian Table 6 .3 Mechanisms of resistance in bacteria (Giedraitien\u0117 et al. 2011; Kapoor et al. 2017 selection occurring as a result of antimicrobial use. This is the reason why antimicrobials are fundamentally different to all other medicines; they have both an individual effect (curing the infection) and a population effect (selection for resistance), and sometimes these conflict (Sandoval-Motta and Aldana 2016).
