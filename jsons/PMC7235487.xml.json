When addressing infectious diseases that are not well understood, and capable of exhibiting aggressive clinical courses with subsequent patient mortality, rapid intervention that is optimally suited to target the pathogen is critical. Due to the unpredictability and severity of these pathogens, combination therapy based on drug repurposing is often indicated due to the urgency of intervention and the requirement of previously established drug safety in humans. Unfortunately, these drug combinations are often designed using trial\u2010and\u2010error strategies. Specifically, drugs are selected based on their targets or mechanism of action, and they are administered using clinical standard dosing guidelines. Dose adjustments are made when toxicity is observed. Unfortunately, these approaches likely preclude optimal treatment outcomes.",

When confronted with a novel pathogen strain with high virulence, a potential capacity for rapid and continuous mutation, and poor patient outcomes, the global community often requires rapidly actionable responses due to patient mortality that may quickly follow initial diagnosis. To address the COVID\u201019 crisis, a substantial number of clinical trials have been initiated.[\n\n8\n\n] Treatment options explored to address COVID\u201019 have included repurposed human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and influenza\u2010related monotherapies and drug cocktails, trials of investigational therapies such as remdesivir (Gilead Sciences), and has sparked a worldwide effort to develop a vaccine. Among large sets of candidate therapies for drug repurposing in combination therapy, standard approaches involve drug selection based on mechanism of action. Drug dosing is subsequently determined by established clinical guidelines. Traditional design approaches are based on trial\u2010and\u2010error, and barriers include sub\u2010optimal efficacy and dose\u2010limiting toxicities. In sum, the lack of a systematic way to interrogate the massive drug\u2010dose parameter space created by these pools of candidate therapies preclude the ability to optimize treatment outcomes.",

Project IDentif.AI sought to determine the duration of time required to simultaneously identify the best drugs and doses from a pool of 12 candidate therapies that optimally inhibited the infection of the A549 lung cell line by VSV (efficacy) while maintaining A549 (efficacy). These therapies included amantadine HCl, dexamethasone, azithromycin, chloroquine diphosphate, naproxen sodium, fluoxetine HCl, loratadine, omeprazole sodium, ritonavir, lopinavir, doxycycline and ribavirin. The 12 candidate therapies were selected based on multiple factors that may be considered during pandemics, including prior studies examining their role as repurposed monotherapies in addressing a diverse range of viral pathogens, global adoption and availability of the therapies, as well as tolerability by broad classes of patients, among others. Specifically, Amantadine HCl is an organic compound that was developed to address influenza infections.[\n\n9\n\n] It has been repurposed for treatment of motor impairment in Parkinson's disease,[\n\n10\n\n] and explored for improvement of fatigue in patients with multiple sclerosis.[\n\n11\n\n] Dexamethasone is a potent anti\u2010inflammatory and immunosuppressant glucocorticoid. It is used in therapies against a wide range of indications, including oncology and bacterial infections.[\n\n12\n\n] It has been successfully used to treat dengue\u2010related hemophagocytic syndrome.[\n\n13\n\n] Azithromycin is an antibiotic given to patients with bacterial infections of lower respiratory tract,[\n\n14\n\n] including community\u2010acquired pneumonia.[\n\n15\n\n] It has been explored as a novel antimalarial agent.[\n\n16\n\n] Chloroquine disphosphate is the most widely used drug against malaria. In recent years it has been found to target other infectious diseases, including HIV and fungal infections.[\n\n17\n\n] Naproxen sodium is an established nonselective, nonsteroidal anti\u2010inflammatory drug (NSAID) commonly used for treating mild and moderate pain and inflammation.[\n\n18\n\n] Recently, It has been shown to act against influenza A and B viruses.[\n\n19\n\n] Fluoxetine HCL, widely known as Prozac, is an antidepressant used to treat a range of depressive disorders.[\n\n20\n\n] Its antiviral properties have been explored for treating coxsackievirus.[\n\n21\n\n] Loratadine is a second\u2010generation nonsedating antihistamine used for allergies.[\n\n22\n\n] Recent clinical trials have evaluated its use as abortive therapy in pegfilgrastim\u2010associated bone pain.[\n\n23\n\n] Omeprazole sodium is a proton pump inhibitor (PPI) used to treat gastrointestinal reflux disease and in Helicobacter pylori eradication therapy for gastritis and peptic ulcers.[\n\n24\n\n] Omeprazole and other PPIs have recently been investigated for and demonstrated antitumor activity and anti\u2010inflammatory effects.[\n\n25\n\n] Ritonavir and lopinavir are antiretroviral medications commonly used in combination treatment for patients infected with (HIV), with ritonavir used as a booster with other protease inhibitors like lopinavir.[\n\n26\n\n] Lopinavir and ritonavir combination has demonstrated in vitro antiviral activity against SARS and favorable clinical response in patients with SARS.[\n\n27\n\n] Ritonavir has also been explored and shown to be highly effective as a booster in fixed\u2010dose combinations for patients with Hepatitis C.[\n\n27\n\n] Doxycycline is a tetracycline antibiotic with a broad antimicrobial spectrum of activity.[\n\n28\n\n] In recent clinical trials, doxycycline has been shown to treat nasal polyps and rosacea, as an anti\u2010inflammatory.[\n\n29\n\n] Ribavirin is an antiviral medication often administered in combination with interferon\u2010based therapies for patients with chronic Hepatitis C.[\n\n30\n\n] Additionally, Ribavirin has been shown to be an effective treatment for respiratory syncytial virus and hemorrhagic fevers.[\n\n31\n\n]\n",

In addition, this platform identified multiple highly efficacious and tolerable regimens, presenting the potential of multiple options for treatment. This study demonstrated that Project IDentif.AI can potentially be used for patient\u2010specific or population\u2010wide development of actionable combination therapy. It's implementation also does not require complex disease mechanism or drug target information for implementation.

The GFP intensity of VSV\u2010infected cells under different MOI parameters (0.125, 0.25, 0.5, 1) were assessed. Cell densities for each well of 96 well plate varied between 4000 (4k), 8000 (8k) and 12 000 (12k) per well. Infection was allowed for 24 and 30 h (Figure\n\n1A,B). As indicated in the figure and microscopic images, MOI as low as 0.125 was sufficient to mediate nearly 100% cell infection after 24 h for 12k per well initial cell density. We therefore utilized 12k per well as the initial cell density throughout the study. We then further reduced the MOI and incubation time. Microscope images of bright field and fluorescence are merged for visualization under different MOI parameters (0.001, 0.01, 0.1) after VSV infection occurred for 12 h (Figure 1C) and 24 h (Figure 1D). Of note, as indicated in the Figure 1C and ImageJ cell counting results, only 9.56 \u00b1 2.55% (n = 3) cells were infected under MOI = 0.001 during 12 h. A MOI = 0.01 infected a majority of the cells after a 12 h incubation and the overall GFP intensity continued to increase at the 24 h checkpoint, indicating that the virus continued its reproduction inside the cells during this period of time.",

As monotherapies, none of the drugs were able to mediate viral infection levels below 5%. With the exception of AZT, FLX, LRT, LPN and DOX, which mediated observable toxicity at high concentrations, the candidate monotherapies and their studied concentration ranges appeared tolerable (over 75% cell viability). Of note, the final DMSO concentration for all the tests did not exceed 0.3% to ensure the cell viability can be attributed to drug treatments.",

            "text": "To validate the combination regimens of the 5 candidate drugs that were advanced for further consideration, we conducted a subsequent round of experiments with 30 combinations consisting of these 5 drugs (MOI = 0.1, Table S3, Supporting Information). Viral infection and drug treatment was simultaneously applied to host cells. The viral infection from each drug treatment was recorded at 12 h (Figure\n\n4A). A parabolic polynomial model was built with stepwise regression following the combinatorial optimization studies. When assessing the drug interaction coefficients as well as the parabolic response surfaces, broad synergy was subsequently observed (Figure 4B\u2013D; Equation S1, Supporting Information). The optimal combination (Optimal Combo 1) mediated a 1.5% VSV infection rate compared to no drug treatment and was comprised of Amantadine HCl (5 \u00d7 10\u22126\nm), Azithromycin (5 \u00d7 10\u22126\nm), Chloroquine Diphosphate (0.5 \u00d7 10\u22126\nm), and Ribavirin (2.5 \u00d7 10\u22126\nm). Optimal Combo 2 mediated an infection rate of 1.6% compared to no drug treatment and was comprised of Amantadine HCl (5 \u00d7 10\u22126\nm), Azithromycin (5 \u00d7 10\u22126\nm), Chloroquine Diphosphate (0.5 \u00d7 10\u22126\nm), and Omeprazole Sodium (0.5 \u00d7 10\u22126\nm) (Table\n\n1\n). Of note, both of these combinations were based on individual drug doses that were lower than the high doses needed to achieve sufficient efficacy as monotherapies. It is important to note that for many of the top\u2010ranked combinations, the component therapies exhibited unfavorable efficacy when delivered as monotherapies, but played a key role in mediating optimal efficacy when co\u2010administered. As an example, for Amantadine HCl, Chloroquine Diphosphate, and Omeprazole Sodium, monotherapy was shown to be relatively ineffective at high doses. Compared to no drug treatment, Amantadine (HCl) treatment exhibited infection rates of \u224875%. Chloroquine Diphosphate treatment exhibited infection rates of \u224825%, and Omeprazole Sodium treatment exhibited infection rates of \u224850%. To further evaluate the importance of drug and dose optimization in systematic combination therapy design, it is important to note that Optimal Combo 1 and Sub\u2010Optimal Combo 2 were comprised of the same therapies, but at different doses. This alone resulted in infection rates of 1.5% and 10.7%, an approximately sevenfold difference in efficacy and demonstrating the importance of simultaneous drug and dose optimization. This is further confirmed by the scenario where replacing Amantadine HCl with Omeprazole Sodium and administering this combination at a sub\u2010optimal dose results in a 21.6% infection rate. This represents a 14\u2010fold difference in efficacy compared to Optimal Combo 1. With regards to the factors contributing toward the optimal treatment outcomes, analysis of the interaction terms showed that the effects were primarily due to single\u2010drug contributions, drug quadratic effects, 2\u2010drug interaction synergy as well as 3\u2010drug interaction synergy (Figure 4E; Equation S2\u2013S4, Supporting Information).",

In lieu of drug selection followed by dose finding, we used a previously established quadratic correlation between the 12\u2010drug pool and drug doses (input) as well as inhibition of A549 infection by VSV and A549 viability (outputs) to systematically identify the top drug combinations. This was achieved independent of any prior knowledge of drug targets, mechanism\u2010of\u2010action, or complex disease biology. Furthermore, the implementation of our platform does not require training based on existing data sets or big data. Instead, a specified set of experiments based on a broad spectrum of drug\u2010dose combinations that sufficiently represents the parameter space that is created by the 12\u2010drug set is prospectively conducted. As such, the optimization process is driven completely by prospectively validated data on a cell line or patient sample. Many efforts to evaluate drug sets for single drug treatment or sampled combinations have been conducted. Global optimization of combination therapy design from a large drug set opens up the doors to a broader spectrum of actionable regimens. As our study has shown, even when combinations comprised of the same drugs are administered at varying doses, a sevenfold difference in efficacy was observed, and even greater differences (14\u2010fold) were observed when one drug was substituted (omeprazole sodium) for another (amantadine HCl, yielding a combination of azithromycin\u2010chloroquine diphosphate\u2010omeprazole sodium\u2010ribavirin) under sub\u2010optimal dosing conditions. This is an interesting finding considering the single drug substitution resulted in such a profound disparity in treatment outcomes, even if all of the drugs considered comprised the top 2 optimal combinations. This further demonstrated the importance of simultaneous drug/dose optimization. Importantly, this process produced multiple drug/dose\u2010optimized combinations within 3 days.

In addition, the VSV model was selected primarily due to it being a well\u2010characterized and readily available platform. If a different disease platform and/or host model are used, it is highly probable that the ranking, drugs that comprise the combinations, and the number of drugs that mediate optimal performance will change. Also, this study was conducted with a diverse range of potential drug candidates. In a clinical setting, especially to address COVID\u201019 or other clinically relevant pathogens, the pool of drug candidates, which should be developed in consultation with the treating clinical team, is likely to differ substantially from the pool used in this study. Furthermore, if this approach is applied toward clinical samples, patient\u2010specific rankings of optimal combinations can potentially emerge. The importance of the findings of this study are centered on the ability to rapidly interrogate massive parameter spaces that are created when both the right drugs and their right respective doses have to simultaneously reconciled. The ability to reconcile this extraordinarily large set of possible combinations in a timely fashion into actionable and globally optimized combinations may be effective for scenarios where the prevention of community spread of novel and aggressive pathogens is critical. While additional further clinical validation at the point\u2010of\u2010care is required, several key factors pertaining to the broad clinical relevance and prior validation of technologies related to Project IDentif.AI should be noted. Firstly, previous oncology studies using the quadratic phenotypic optimization platform (QPOP) and CURATE.AI, which are foundational to Project IDentif.AI, have demonstrated that benchtop\u2010based implementation of this approach have directly led to markedly enhanced patient outcomes compared to traditionally observed results.[\n\n33\n, \n34\n\n] Additional clinical validation studies, including one study that harnessed a related AI\u2010guided dosing platform against HIV in humans have further demonstrated the critical importance of drug dosage in mediating optimal treatment efficacy and tolerability.[\n\n34\n, \n35\n\n] Of note, doses that are lower than expected, as well as dosages that were dynamically modulated were commonly used to optimize patient outcomes.",

This relationship will also be driven by the emergence of quality variation, as some patients, hospital systems, and payers will be more willing than others to make available and/or pay for the testing that may generate more, or better data on patient\u2010specific drug/dose profiles. In turn, this may lead to the introduction of performance\u2010based contracting or quality\u2010based price discrimination, which are suitable pathways to explore, especially if they result in better health outcomes while reducing the cost of care.[\n\n37\n\n] This concept led to a proposed personalized treatment plan for diabetes patients by using the patients\u2019 dose\u2010effect characteristics.

When considering the core disease areas that receive the most attention, such as cancer, diabetes, and cardiovascular, the reality is that communicable infection remains a formidable healthcare infrastructural burden.[\n\n41\n\n] For example, in many parts of the world, there remains a need to develop better infectious disease interventions to fight the overuse of antibiotics (positioned to consume 10 million lives annually by 2050).[\n\n42\n\n] This challenge alone could have dramatic economic consequences.
