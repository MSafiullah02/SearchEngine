The demand for a sufficiently large supply of antiviral drugs and vaccines was clear.

However, ribavirin monotherapy had limited activity against SARS-CoV and led to significant hemolysis collateral effect [10]. Ribavirin is more commonly used together with lopinavir, ritonavir and HIV protease inhibitors [11]. These combinations were demonstrated to improve the outcome of patients with SARS [9].",

S protein is composed of two subunits: S1 recognizes and binds to host receptors, and S2 facilitates fusion between the viral envelope and the host cell membrane [15]. Numerous studies have explored how to target this first stage of the virus lifecycle. These methods mainly involve peptidic fusion inhibitors, anti-CoV neutralizing monoclonal antibodies, and entry receptor antagonists. However, none of these curative agents is approved for commercial use in humans [16]. Regarding the SARS-CoV-2 infection, in the absence of a clinically proved effective antiviral therapy against COVID-19, a combination of different drugs has been often supplemented (Table 1).",

It is currently under clinical development for the treatment of Ebola virus infection and it also demonstrated a good antiviral result in vitro against SARS and MERS coronaviruses [6]. Remdesivir also revealed as an effective antiviral agent in vitro against COVID-19 infection [21]. Among small-sized molecular agents approved for viral human diseases, an immune modulator, chloroquine, shows inhibitory effects against SARS-CoV-2 [19]. It is known as a potential broad spectrum antiviral drug, widely used as anti-malarial drug [22]. Chloroquine (CQ) blocks virus infection by increasing the endosomal pH required for the fusion between virus and cell. It also interferes with the glycosylation of cellular receptors of SARS-CoV [5,22]. A recent in vitro study demonstrated that CQ functions at both entry- and at post-entry-stages of the SARS-CoV-2 infection [19,23]. Besides its antiviral activity, CQ also presents immune-modulating activity, which can enhance its antiviral effect in vivo. Notably, CQ could be replaced by the less toxic hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) [23].",

It is imperative to ensure the protection of health-care workers. This is not only crucial to guarantee continuous patient care (in all nosocomial environments), but also to prevent virus transmission by unaware SARS-CoV-2 carriers [25]. Besides, contagion protection for the whole population is mandatory in all those cases when social confinement is not possible due to force majeure (work, health problems, caregiving, etc.).

COVID-19 can easily propagate via cough or respiratory droplets, contact with bodily fluids, or from contaminated surfaces (Figure 1). Secondary infection routes involve touching dirty/contaminated surfaces, followed by self-inoculation of mucous membranes. A study carried out on 29 patients [29] estimated that secondary routes are less probable than direct contagion (including eye-, nose-, oral-, etc.). Nevertheless, this risk is not considered negligible by different other sources, including WHO [30]. Many commonly touched surfaces, along with nosocomial environments and PPE have been tested against this risk. Based on a previously published paper [31], which revealed the persistence of human coronavirus 229E on the surface of common materials, G. Kampf recently reviewed the topic for SARS, MERS and SARS-CoV-2 viruses [32,33].",

Van Doremalen et al. [36] tested the viability of SARS-CoV-2 in different environmental conditions (aerosols, plastic, stainless steel, copper, and cardboard). The longest viability was on stainless steel and plastic surfaces; the estimated median virus half-life being approximately 5.6 h on stainless steel and 6.8 h on plastic. Copper was found to be effective in inactivating the virus in a shorter time. These findings are in agreement with what already reported on CoV-229E in 2015 [31]: brasses containing at least 70% copper were very effective at inactivating CoV-229E, and the rate of inactivation was directly proportional to copper percentage. Copper ion release and the generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) were demonstrated to be responsible for the inactivation of coronaviruses on copper and copper alloy surfaces [36]. Several already-approved biocides based on silver or zinc oxide are just waiting to be tested against SARS-CoV-2 as well.",

It is evident that inadequate PPE and inappropriate PPE guidelines can be responsible for the death of many health-care workers and for viral nosocomial spreading. Bhattacharjee and co-workers reviewed the topic in 2019, before the spreading of SARS-CoV-2, taking into account other viral pandemic diseases like Ebola, SARS, and MERS [64]. They reported that metal-grafted graphene oxide (GO), for the modification of non-woven tissues, showed to have very effective antimicrobial properties. Graphene derivatives have been reported to be used as antimicrobial composites with different metals (Ag, Fe, Cu, Zn, etc.), and photocatalysts (TiO2, CdS, MnS2, etc.) [65]. GO grafted with metal nanoparticles has been investigated as a potential treatment for PPE [66]. Specifically, it is known that silver and copper nano-based systems loaded on GO are very effective against both enveloped and non-enveloped viruses [65,67]. Anti-influenza copper oxide-loaded polypropylene respirators were proposed in 2010; Borkow et al. demonstrated that copper oxide-impregnated masks safely reduced the risk of influenza virus environmental contamination, without altering the filtration capabilities of the masks [68]. However, no reports about the impregnation of masks and other PPE with copper salt solutions were found in literature [68,69]. Their use is actually part of our future research plans, which will involve both nanophases and reference compounds and salts. In order to prevent the potential nano-toxicity of metal nanoparticles on masks and respirators through inhalation, we think that, besides embedding nanoparticles in polymer matrices (vide infra), the best strategy could be the use of copper salts for the impregnation of PPE pieces. In fact, when used at low concentration levels, Cu(II) ions have low cytotoxicity on eukaryotic cells [70].",

CQ and HCQ are aminoquinolines, a class of heterocyclic scaffolds with an amino group. They are able to form metal complexes with Fe(II), Ni(II), Zn(II), and Cu(II) ions [83]. In addition, metal complexes have been investigated as drug delivery agents, leading to reduced side effects and improved pharmacokinetics. It is worth noting that metal complexes of 8-hydroxyquinoline have been already shown to be antiviral agents [84].",
