The multimodal repository usually consists of paired objects from two modalities, but may be labelled or unlabelled. Classical approaches to compare data across modalities include canonical correlation analysis [12], partial least squares regression [28], and their numerous variants. More recently, various deep learning models have been developed to learn shared embedding spaces from paired image-text data, either unsupervised, or supervised using image class labels. The deep models popularly used include deep belief networks [23], correspondence autoencoders [9], deep metric learning [13], and convolutional neural networks (CNNs) [33]. With all these models it is expected that by learning from pairwise aligned data, the common representation space will capture semantic similarities across modalities.",

VRSS produces a joint representation of the image-text repository, where the semantic associations are grounded in context by making use of the sequential nature of the data. Stepwise query results are then obtained by searching this representation space. More concretely, we incorporate the global context information encoded in the entire text sequence (through the attention mechanism) into a variational autoencoder (VAE) at each time step, which converts the input text into an image representation in the image embedding space. To capture the semantics of the images retrieved so far (in a story/recipe), we assume the prior of the distribution of the topic given the text input follows the distribution conditional on the latent topic from the previous time step. By doing so, our model can naturally capture sequential semantic structure.",

A number of pairwise-based methods over the years have attempted to address the cross-modal retrieval problem in different ways, such as metric learning [26] and deep neural networks [32]. For instance, an alignment model [16] was devised that learns inter-modal correspondences using MS-COCO [19] and Flickr-30k [25] datasets. Other work [18] proposed unifying joint image-text embedding models with multimodal neural language models, using an encoder-decoder pipeline. A later method [8] used hard negatives to improve their ranking loss function, which yielded significant gains in retrieval performance. Such systems focus only on isolated image retrieval when given a text query, and do not address the seq2seq retrieval problem that we study here.",

Recent work [4] proposed a cross-modal retrieval model that aligns Recipe1M images and recipes in a shared representation space. As this dataset does not offer any sequential data for stepwise illustration, this association is between images of the final dish and the corresponding entire recipe text. Our Stepwise Recipe dataset, by comparison, provides an image for each instruction step, resulting in a sequence of image-text pairs for each recipe.",

For our human evaluation, we pick a random sample (164 recipes, 1564 image-text pairs) from the test set (1K recipes, 6K image-text pairs). We present each evaluator with a sequence of recipe instruction steps that make up one complete recipe. Alongside each text segment, they are given three possible illustrations that depict that step, which are randomly shuffled images of the gold-standard, the non-context model, and the proposed VRSS model. The evaluator is asked to select all image options that may be appropriate illustrations for the corresponding text segment. A total of 5.1K ratings are obtained from 12 evaluators, ensuring that every sample receives at least 2 ratings.",

LDA gives the worst results, which shows that using a generative model for capturing the semantic topics from both text and image does not work well in the seq2seq retrieval task. By mapping both text and image into the same embedding space, VSE++ outperforms LDA. Our VRSS model without the VAE component (VRSS-VAE) gives similar performance compared to the non-context model VSE++ despite considering the contextual information. VRSS without the incorporation of global context (VRSS-GlobalCon.) performs similarly as VRSS-VAE. CNSI gives worse results compared to both VRSS variants in Recall@k and Story Recall@1. Our new VRSS model, which maps each hidden state of the RNN into a latent topic and also further incorporates global context information, gives the best results across all metrics. This indicates the importance of representing semantics encoded in both text and images in a more abstract manner and the benefit of incorporating global context.\n",
