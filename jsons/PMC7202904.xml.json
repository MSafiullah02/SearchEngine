Misinformation contradicts the best expert evidence available at the time and can lead to individual misperception or \u201cfactual beliefs that are false or contradict the best available evidence in public domain.\u201d [1, 2] The emergence of new communication platforms and access-enabling technology, such as social media and cell phones, that connect networks of people who often share similar opinions and cultural beliefs, has exacerbated and amplified this problem [3, 4]. Misinformation is not limited to the political realm, where it is widely recognized, but has emerged as an important issue in public health-related messaging and potential barrier to effective disease outbreak preparedness and response [5]. Common examples of health misinformation during public health events or emergencies include false remedies for illness, incorrect information on disease transmission, or allegations that the disease is associated with a government conspiracy [6, 7]. Characterization of health-related misinformation is needed to develop evidence-based risk communication efforts during public health emergencies. In particular, it is necessary to develop more effective strategies to manage misinformation during infectious disease emergencies based on an understanding of typical trends in health-related misinformation.",

Additionally, when health or science information is framed in the form of \u201cculturally antagonistic memes\u201d that connect such information to divisive social or political issues in provocative ways, risk perception can be altered [9]. Furthermore, the outcome of competition between differing message frames is often dependent on how much each message resonates with an individual\u2019s values [11].

Moreover, social media may increase its effects, serving as both a source of misinformation and a catalyst for its dissemination [12\u201314]. Some research has indicated that social media may lead to selective exposure to specific types of content, driving possible \u201cecho chambers\u201d and the formation of homogenous clusters is a primary driver of information diffusion [15]. Other studies assessing this phenomenon note, however, that echo chambers may not be as present depending on how diverse exposure is to different forms of media [16]. False information can spread easily over social media platforms. For example, in Twitter rumor cascades, false news reaches more people than true information [4]. Social media is now one of the key sources in how many people receive their health news and [17, 18], as such, has a key role in the spread of health misinformation.",

Despite very low case counts within the United States (US), widespread fear and media attention contributed to dissemination of US Ebola-related misinformation [7]. Coverage from traditional media sources was dispersed on social media, where it joined a mixture of factual and false information [7, 24\u201326]. News and social media content during the Ebola epidemic has been explored both within West African [25, 27, 28], American contexts [7, 24], and European contexts [29]. Research focusing on Ebola-related misinformation in the West African context identified common rumors including false treatments; misinformation about the intentions and motives of healthcare workers treating Ebola patients; and rumors about the Ebola epidemic being a hoax [27, 28]. Such rumors may have impeded the ability for public health responders to communicate to communities about effective prevention and control methods. Research on Ebola-related misinformation in a predominantly Western context found that rumors such as the existence of \u201cEbola zombies\u201d, misperceptions about the disease transmission, or inaccurate information about experimental Ebola vaccines was common, potentially leading to fear, uncertainty, and confusion amongst the public [7].",

Piloting was conducted until all three authors were in agreement on coding methodology and interpretation of coding instrument. The final coding instrument included dichotomous yes/no codes assessing tweet characteristics (e.g. joke, opinion, discord), veracity (true, false, partially false), political context, risk frame [31], health context, Ebola specific messages [30, 32], rumors [7], and 23 hashtags previously identified in literature as potentially suspicious or associated with misinformation (Additional File 1) [25]. Two authors (DH and MT) coded tweets using a Google survey form. The extensive piloting process indicated a need for collaborative review of some tweets that were challenging to code. As a result, a system in which three authors (DH, MT, and TKS) reviewed those tweets in question was established and continued throughout the coding process. Two authors (DH and MT) assessed interrater reliability for each dichotomous yes/no item by each coding the same random sample of 200 tweets. All but one item had kappa values of 0.79 of higher and therefore met conventional standards for adequate reliability [33]. The remaining item \u2013 statement in support of government - did not have a satisfactory Kappa value but remained in the coding instrument because it was very rare and showed 99.5% agreement.",

Past research indicates that the types of social media content can vary over the course of an outbreak and political framing of social media messages in past outbreaks appeared more frequently during the \u201cmaintenance\u201d stage of outbreak response, which occurs during peak activity of response efforts prior to the resolution of an outbreak [39]. Ebola response activities within the US and the time period of interest in this study corresponded with the lead up to US midterm elections (which occurred Nov 4, 2014). This temporal overlap may have contributed to the political content found in many tweets, particularly with respect to discourse on travel bans and quarantine procedures. Furthermore, the politicization of this health issue extended beyond discussion about the disease itself, and often touched on other contentious political issues in the US, such as immigration, general health care policy, and government spending. These findings support previous research tying the acceptance of information and perceived risk perception with whether such information would align with a person\u2019s political identity [8]. The intersection of health misinformation with political discourse may have also contributed to Ebola response efforts being viewed as partisan topics. As other researchers have noted [8, 10], when a statement is associated with a particular conservative or liberal viewpoint, readers that align with that political ideology may be less likely to critically assess the truth to the statement, which posed a challenge for promoting evidence-based policies in public health response.",

Additionally, a substantial proportion of these tweets were framed in ways that could promote discord or bait readers into responding. Similar trends have been observed by other researchers assessing vaccine misinformation on social media [23]. Published literature on misinformation during the H1N1 pandemic have also shown that misinformation circulating during pandemics often elicits lack of trust in government or traditional institutions [40]. Notably, the prevalence of tweet characteristics of concern, including the presence of misinformation, discord-inducing statements, and political messaging, remained relatively constant even among highly retweeted content. Given the relationship between political content and misinformation, another potential approach to ensure that accurate information is included in political discourse is to provide political leaders with frequently updated disease information fact sheets. Federal health officials, for example the Health and Human Services Assistant Secretary for Public Affairs and Assistant Secretary for Legislation, can provide frequent updates and concise information to policymakers and political staff members to ensure that science-based health information is easily available. Furthermore, practitioners, policymakers, and the national security community should be aware of the potential usage of public health emergencies to create discord amongst the public during public health emergencies and strive to reduce these effects. Experience with outbreak emergencies has shown the deleterious effects of misinformation and diminishing trust [5].",

Results showing high frequency of risk perception elevating tweets align with previously published literature on social media content during the Ebola epidemic [7, 25]. The high proportion of these messages, paired with inflammatory political statements and misinformation demonstrate how public health response efforts and public health messaging can be interpreted or distorted in ways that promote political and social discord. Furthermore, driven by public interest, mass media may sensationalize or exaggerate the risk of disease in a population, which could increase risk perception and risk-elevating messages on social media [24]. Although appropriate levels of risk perception in situations that warrant public attention, investment in protective actions, and policy intervention is necessary, messages that elevate public perception of risk situations that do not warrant high levels of public concern are problematic. Disease outbreaks may naturally lead to messages that could increase perception of risk and public health communicators must work with transparency and empathy for public fears [41].",

            "text": "Developing a strategy to combat misinformation during an epidemic, particularly one that induces increased levels of fear amongst the public, is challenging, and effectively addressing misinformation will likely involve multifaceted approaches, such as developing compelling public health awareness campaigns, engaging in media literacy efforts, and monitoring of circulating content to develop proactive responses to emerging communication issues. Public private partnerships between social media companies and public health agencies to promote public health messages is also an important component in combating misinformation, as observed in the partnership between the World Health Organization and social media companies to combat the novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) misinformation [42, 43]. As governments and global health organizations become increasingly aware of the dangers of misinformation in both health and political sectors, more research will need to be done to ensure that strategies to reduce misinformation are effective and do not infringe of the spread of true information or the ability of members of the public to speak freely. Research assessing the effects of correcting health misinformation has shown varied results. While some studies have indicated that correction of certain misinformation by trusted sources can help reduce misperceptions, others indicate correction can sometimes have limited impact or even contribute to further misperceptions in certain circumstances due to factors such as the perceived trustworthiness of the source and whether corrective information conflicts with the social or political identity of the individual [44, 45]. Furthermore, countering of messages will require clear understanding of the underlying drivers and motivations among stakeholders for promoting false information.",

            "text": "This research is subject to several limitations. Tweets are short and provide limited content to frame coding. The coding process involved human interpretation of sometimes confusing material and may have introduced bias or error. Sarcasm and satire were occasionally difficult to interpret. However, this was mitigated through continual consensus seeking efforts with the team throughout the coding process for tweets considered particularly confusing or challenging. Frequent discussions prevented coders from deviating from agreed upon code definitions over the course of the coding process. Although interrater agreement for coders was high, double coding was conducted on a limited 5% of the sample. Another potential limitation is our decision not to limit the study sample to US geotagged tweets due to concerns about potential bias this may have introduced\u2013 that users who allowed geotagging may have been different from other types of Twitter users. Instead, the sample was limited to English language tweets during a time period of heightened attention to Ebola in the US. As a result, not all tweets may have originated in the US. Additionally, codes to assess political nature of tweets were not specific to a particular ideology or political party. Therefore, we were not able to systematically quantify the political leanings of different tweets. Furthermore, tweets were automatically and randomly selected as part of the 1% sample of tweets published in our timeframe of interest. As a result, tweets with low retweet counts may have been published just prior to data capture, potentially showing fewer retweets than they eventually received. Finally, the time period for our study was limited to the period of most intense interest amongst the US population but may have been too short to identify general trends in Ebola-related social media posts.",

Results demonstrated that most analyzed tweets were risk elevating, and that misinformation was not a dominant feature but notably present. Findings also highlight the importance of anticipating politicization of disease outbreaks, and the presence of provocative, discord-inducing messages in response to public health measures. Policy makers, public health practitioners, and social media companies will need to work together to develop communication strategies and response frameworks in advance of outbreaks to mitigate misinformation and the resulting public health impacts.",
