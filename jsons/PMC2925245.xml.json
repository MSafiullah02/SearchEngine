Autophagy, which has been well characterized in yeast, is an essential process by which bulk protein degradation and organelle turnover take place (Kim et al., 2001, Mizushima et al., 1998).",

Recently, the contribution of an autophagy protein, ATG5, to viral replication has been demonstrated (Prentice et al., 2004). Indeed, production of MHV particles is profoundly reduced (> 99%) in ATG5\u2212/\u2212 knockout (KO) embryonic stem cells (Prentice et al., 2004). In this system, the expression of ATG5 in ATG5\u2212/\u2212 cells restores virus production. The relationship between ATG5 and MHV replication may come from the ability of ATG5 to initiate the formation of DMVs, which have been observed in MHV-infected cells (Gosert et al., 2003, Mizushima et al., 2001). As seen for dengue virus-2 (DV2), when autophagy is blocked by ATG5-KO MEF cells, extracellular DV2 virus titers are reduced by 3-fold compared to those from wild-type MEF cells (Lee et al., 2008).",

Because HCV replicons replicate autonomously in Huh-7, it has been proposed that the membranous web that contain the HCV replication complexes represents the genuine site of viral replication (Gosert et al., 2002, Moradpour et al., 2003). In HCV-infected cells, accumulation of lipid droplets, shown to be essential for HCV replication, has been observed in the proximity of the membranous web (Miyanari et al., 2007). Given the involvement of autophagy at the site of replication of other positive-stranded RNA viruses, are the autophagy proteins or structure involved in HCV replication? In that regard, Tanida et al. (2009) recently showed that Atg7 silencing decreased the levels of infectious HCVcc by about 40%, whereas intracellular HCV RNA and protein levels remained unchanged. At the same time, another group demonstrated that autophagy proteins (ATG4b and Beclin-1) are required only for the initiation of incoming HCV RNA translation/replication (Dreux et al., 2009).",

Two of these positive clones matched the sequence of the human eukaryotic initiation factor 4AII (eIF4AII), recently identified as an interacting protein for HCV NS5B (Kyono et al., 2002). Two more clones corresponded to the EMBL/GenBank/DDBJ accession number Y711588a. This gene is highly homologous to the Saccharomyces cerevisiae ATG5 gene (Hammond et al., 1998). ATG5/NS5B interaction was confirmed in the yeast two-hybrid system using the full-length human ATG5 gene amplified from a human liver cDNA library (Clontech) (Fig. 1\n).

We used yeast cells in this study because cotransfection of Huh-7 cells with c-myc-NS5B and HA-tagged ATG5 resulted in a low level expression of ATG5 protein. Yeast extracts were immunoprecipitated with monoclonal antibody against either the c-myc or the HA tag, followed by separation on SDS\u2013PAGE. As shown in Fig. 2A, an immunoreactive band (lane 2) that corresponds to the size of the NS5B protein (68 kDa; lane 4) was coimmunoprecipitated with ATG5. This band was not present when the extracts were immunoprecipitated with monoclonal anti-5A antibody (lane 1) or without any antibody (Protein A/G sepharose beads alone) (lane 3). The bands corresponding to the 50- and 25-kDa molecular weight are the heavy and light chains, respectively, of the antibody. Conversely, ATG5 was coimmunoprecipitated with NS5B when the same extract was incubated with monoclonal anti-c-myc antibody. Indeed, a distinct immunoreactive band (lane 5) that corresponds to the size of ATG5 (lane 7) was detected. However, this band could not be immunoprecipitated by the monoclonal anti-5A antibody (lane 6). This protein\u2013protein interaction was further substantiated by the metabolic labeling experiments shown in Fig. 2B in which ATG5 was constitutively expressed and NS5B expression was under a copper-inducible promoter. As expected, when the labeled extracts were immunoprecipitated with monoclonal anti-HA, a prominent band corresponding to the size of ATG5 was detected in yeast extracts under induced (lane 1) and noninduced (lane 2) conditions. However, the band corresponding to NS5B was only detected in lane 1 (induced condition). When the same extracts were immunoprecipitated with monoclonal anti-c-myc antibody, an intense band corresponding to the size of NS5B was apparent under the induced condition (lane 3). As expected, a band corresponding to the size of ATG5 was also detected in the extracts under the induced condition (lane 3) but not under the noninduced condition (lane 4).

For that purpose, the truncated fragments were inserted into a pGBKT7 or pGADT7 plasmid. As illustrated in Fig. 3\n, all constructs containing the C-terminal end of the NS5B displayed interaction with ATG5, while truncation of the NS5B C-terminus completely abrogated such interaction. To confirm the data obtained by yeast two-hybrid screening, co-IP of the putative interacting domains was performed. Both techniques were able to identify the C-terminal end (aa 450\u2013570) of NS5B as the interacting domain for ATG5 (Fig. 3). The NS5B may have several amino acids involved in this interaction since the fragments 1\u2013501, 500\u2013535, and 536\u2013570 independently interacted with ATG5. Thus, the binding domain of NS5B to ATG5 corresponds to the back surface of the thumb domain which has been proposed to be a premium site for protein-protein interaction due to the presence of a highly conserved patch of basic amino acids (Bressanelli et al., 1999).",

In cells replicating HCV RNA, NS5B has been localized to the membranous web (Egger et al., 2002, Gosert et al., 2002). Therefore, we analyzed the localization of ATG5 and NS4B (a well-recognized marker of the membranous web) in genome-length C5B replicon cells (Aligo et al., 2009, Konan et al., 2003). The results presented in Fig. 4A indicate that NS4B indeed colocalized with the endogenous ATG5 protein. It is known that ATG5 and its conjugated form, ATG5-APG12, are mostly cytoplasmic in mouse embryonic stem cells but that their association with the membrane increases upon starvation (Mizushima et al., 2001). Thus, we looked at the subcellular membrane association of ATG5 in replicon cells. As expected, both NS5B and ATG5 proteins were excluded from the cytoplasmic fraction (Fig. 4B). Indeed, both proteins appeared to reside in the microsomal/mitochondrial fractions, suggesting that ATG5 is directed to membranes in replicon cells. Note that the nuclear fractions contain both proteins most likely through contamination from the single-step purification protocol of the nuclear fraction.",

It has recently been suggested that autophagy is required only early in infection (Dreux et al., 2009). Therefore, we evaluated the colocalization of ATG5 and NS5B in infected Huh7 cells at 2 days postinfection (2 DPI). The selection of 2 DPI, as our earliest time point, was based on the slow replication of JFH1 in Huh7 cells for the first few days of infection (Wakita et al., 2005, Zhong et al., 2005). Indeed, at 1 DPI, HCV core, NS5B, and NS5A were undetectable by immunofluorescence staining (data not shown). Therefore, infected Huh7 cells were transfected with pEGFP-ATG5 and analyzed at 2 or 5 DPI for the presence of NS5B and ATG5 (Fig. 5A). To our surprise, a strong colocalization of GFP-ATG5 and NS5B was evident in approximately 80% of infected cells at 2 DPI, but completely disappeared at 5 DPI. This result suggests that ATG5\u2013NS5B interaction occurs only during the initial onset of HCV replication and may explain why this interaction has not been detected previously.",

Interestingly, strong colocalization between the two proteins was only seen early in infection and was completely absent late in infection (Fig. 5A). This result may imply that the ATG5\u2013NS5B interaction is required for the onset of the viral replication. Since the primary known function of ATG5 is the formation of the crescent shape DMV, one could argue that HCV requires membrane import during the early stages of viral infection. Indeed, ATG5 is involved in other positive-strand RNA virus replication, probably through the formation of DMV (Khakpoor et al., 2009, Lee et al., 2008, Prentice et al., 2004).

Another report has shown physical interaction between NS5B (or NS5A) and the SNARE-like protein, hVAP-33 (Tu et al., 1999), leading to the localization of the HCV replicase complex on lipid rafts (Aizaki et al., 2006, Gao et al., 2004).

S. cerevisiae Y187 (MAT\u03b1), which contained the pretransformed human cDNA library (complexity > 2\u20134 \u00d7 106 independent clones) cloned into the Gal4 activation domain vector (pACT2) was allowed to mate with S. cerevisiae AH109 (MATa), which had been transformed with a Gal4 DNA-binding domain vector (pGBKT7) containing HCV NS5B as a bait. To construct the bait, the HCV NS5B gene lacking the region encoding the C-terminal 21 amino acid residues was amplified by PCR using the HCV-BK (genotype 1b) genomic cDNA as a template and NS5B-H1 and NS5B-R1700 as primers (Table S1). The resulting NS5B\u039421 gene containing unique EcoRI and BamHI sites at the N- and C-termini, respectively, was cloned into the pGBKT7 expression plasmid to generate an in-frame fusion protein with a Gal4 DNA binding domain. The resulting plasmid, pGBKT7-5B\u039421 was sequenced and subsequently used to transform the AH109 yeast strain. Following mating, the diploid yeast strain (Y187-AH109-NS5B) was selected on SD medium in the absence of leucine, tryptophan, and histidine (\u2212LTH). Eight hundred potential positive yeast clones were obtained from two million screenable clones and were replica-plated onto X-\u03b1 Gal indicator plates in the absence of leucine, tryptophan, histidine, and adenine. Three hundred blue colonies (positive for X-\u03b1 Gal as a result of MEL1 gene activation) were selected by prototrophy for histidine and adenine. These clones were retested for positive interaction, and pACT2/cDNA plasmids were isolated from 20 strong positive clones as reflected by the intensity of the blue color formed on X-\u03b1 Gal indicator plates. These plasmids were retransformed into yeast strains carrying the bait construct, pGBKT7-5B\u039421 or pGBKT7, to confirm true interactions. Clones that gave a positive signal when cotransformed with pGBKT7-5B\u039421 were chosen for DNA sequencing. The DNA sequences of the positive pACT2/cDNA clones were translated and compared with a nonredundant sequence database using the BLAST program through the National Center for Biotechnology Information network service. CLUSTAL_X program was used to analyze statistically significant matches.",
