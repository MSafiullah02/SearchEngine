The highest levels of TSLP were identified, in our patients, in infants with RSV + HRV coinfections. Multivariate logistic regression analysis found that infants with dual RSV + HRV infection were 9 times more likely to have detectable nasal TSLP and this association was independent of other factors such as age or illness severity. These findings suggest that the immunological response in acute bronchiolitis is partly dependent on virus-specific factors. Although other authors also found higher levels of nasal cytokines (IL-6, IL-1b, and IL-8) in infants infected with both RSV and HRV,[43] no previous study has evaluated the differential production of nasal TSLP in single versus dual RSV and HRV infections. Furthermore, the role of coinfections in terms of clinical severity is still controversial. A recent study by our group in 1229 hospitalized children (599 RSV single infections, 510 single HRV infections and 120 RSV + HRV coinfections) found that patients with coinfections had more frequent fever \u2265 38\u00b0C and hypoxia than those with single RSV or single HRV infections.[44] Our results suggest that these clinical findings associated with severe RSV + HRV coinfections might be accompanied by a predominantly Th2 response, suggesting that these viral coinfections may lead to an altered mediator profile that biases towards a Th2 immune response. This hypothesis is also supported by the absence of significant differences in IFN-\u03b3 levels (principal Th1 cytokine) between bronchiolitis and healthy infants and between simple versus dual infections.",

Furthermore, this immunological response was accompanied by the clinical finding that children with HRV + HBoV1 wheeze tended to develop recurrent wheezing later and less often than did those with HRV wheeze. Our results suggest that a virus\u2013virus interaction may also occur in RSV and HRV coinfections, but in an opposite way, towards a predominant Th2 response. This shift in the immune response towards Th2 could favor the development of recurrent wheezing/asthma. However, as far as we know, no previous study has evaluated the frequency of recurrent wheezing after viral bronchiolitis in RSV + HRV coinfection versus the single ones.",

Prior to ours, no study has analyzed levels of periostin in infans with bronchiolitis. In our series, nasal concentrations of periostin were significantly higher in RSV, HRV, HBoV and hMPV-infected infants compared to healthy controls. Given the similarities in clinical manifestations between bronchiolitis and asthma, as well as the high frecuency of recurrent wheezing and asthma following an episode of bronchiolitis,[7,8] the high level of nasal periostin found in infants with viral bronchiolitis might suggest the presence of eosinophilic inflammation even at a young age. Further longitudinal studies are needed to elucidate if these infants with higher levels of periostin during acute bronchiolitis will develop recurrent wheezing/asthma more frequently later in life.",

The neutralization of IL-33 completely abolishes the severe RSV disease phenotype in neonatal mice, whereas the administration of the cytokine during infection in adult mice results in exacerbated Th2-inflammation, lung dysfunction, and airway mucus.[49] Saravia et al[49] detected IL-33 in nasal secretions of infants with RSV infection whose levels decreased during convalescence, although a limitation of their study is the lack of a control uninfected group. Recently, Jackson et al[50] demonstrated for the first time that IL-33 is induced by rhinovirus in the asthmatic adult airway in vivo. These observations have important implications for the understanding of virus-induced asthma exacerbations and offer a mechanism through which respiratory viruses, that are classic Th1 triggers, might promote type 2 inflammation in susceptible individuals.[50] Our study reports for the first time, that other respiratory viruses, besides RSV and HRV, also elicited secretion of IL-33 in the airways of infants with bronchiolitis compared to healthy control children. In our series, as was the case of TSLP, no infant in the healthy control group had detectable levels of IL-33, supporting the role of viral infections in IL-33 induction.",

Our results showed that the induction of nasal periostin and TSLP was more frequent in infants with longer hospitalizations even after adjusting by age as the main confounder. Nasal TSLP was also detected more often in infants who needed ICU admission, although the difference did not remain significant after logistic regression, probably because of the small sample size, as only 8 infants needed ICU admission.
