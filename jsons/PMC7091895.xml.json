Interestingly, the T>A polymorphism has recently been reported to be a risk factor of other lung diseases, including bronchial asthma (Heinzmann, Ahlert, Kurtz, Berner, & Deichmann, 2004) and bronchiolitis caused by respiratory syncytial virus (Hacking et al., 2004; Hull, Thomson, & Kwiatkowski, 2000). It is interesting to mention that, even though we did not find any significant relation between the IL8 polymorphism and mortality, those with IL8A allele or AA homozygous genotype had an increased risk of becoming infected with influenza A (H1N1) virus. Like the study done by Yu et al. (2011), we found some diseases that might determine whether the patient would be infected or have a more aggressive disease. Among them were diabetes, HCV, TB, renal disease, and respiratory disease.",
