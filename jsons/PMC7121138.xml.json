Mass vaccination and public sanitation are the two most effective prophylactic treatments forestalling the depredations of infectious disease. The greatest part of the vaccine story is that of smallpox. At its height, Smallpox killed 10% of Swedish children within their first year. In London, more than 3,000 died in a single smallpox epidemic in 1746, and during the period of 1760\u20131770, the city lost another 4% of its population to the disease. Even as recently as the late 1960s, there were 10\u201312 million cases in 31 countries, with two million deaths annually. Yet the disease is, apart from a few hopefully well-guarded stockpiles, a thing of the past. There have been no cases for most of last 30 years. It has been completely eradicated. Poliomyelitis or Polio has also been the target for a worldwide campaign designed to eradicate the disease by the year 2000. A program undertaken by the Pan American Health Organization eliminated polio in the Western Hemisphere in 1991. The Global Polio Eradication Program has dramatically reduced poliovirus transmission throughout the world. In 2003, only 784 confirmed cases of polio were reported globally. Today Polio remains endemic in only four countries: Nigeria, Afghanistan, Pakistan, and India.",

Annual figures are stark: pertussis accounts for 294,000 (aged under 5); tetanus for 198,000 (under 5) and 15,000 (aged over 5); Hib for 386,000 (under 5); Hepatitis B for 600,000 (over 5); Yellow Fever for 15,000 (under 5) and 15,000 (over 5); and diphtheria for 4,000 (under 5). Projections for as-yet-not-universally available vaccines estimate a consequently greater saving of human life: 449,000 for rotavirus vaccine and 1,612,000 for Pneumococcus vaccine. For example, influenza with an annual global estimate of half a million deaths. However, perhaps the most lamentable situation is Measles, which accounts for 540,000 (under 5) and 70,000 (over 5). Measles is an acute viral disease. The Arabic physician Rhazes referred to it, saying that it was \u2018more dreaded than smallpox\u2019. The eldest son of the famous late Victorian and Edwardian author, H Rider Haggard, who, among 68 novels, wrote Allan Quatermain and She, died from the disease aged 10. Oliva Dahl, daughter of Roald, died aged 7 from measles-induced encephalitis.",

It is a commonly held conception that new infectious diseases will emerge continually throughout the twenty-first century.

About half of these 30 vaccines are in common use, and are, in the main, employed to prevent childhood infections. In the First World, annual mortality for diseases such as polio, diphtheria, or measles is less than 0.1%; and the lasting effects of vaccination work to greatly reduce the morbidity and mortality of disease, often conferring lifetime protection. Most vaccines target childhood infections or are used by travellers to tropical or sub-tropical regions; a significant minority combat disease in the developing world.",

Persistent infection, which includes HIV, Hepatitis B, hepatitis C, and TB, occurs when a pathogen evades or subverts T cell responses, is a key therapeutic target. At the other extreme are benign yet economically important infections, such as the common cold. Respiratory track infections remain the major cause of community morbidity and hospitalisation in the developed world: about 60% of GP referrals and cause the loss of a huge number of working days. Sporadic or epidemic respiratory infections are caused by over 200 distinct viruses, including coronaviruses, rhinoviruses, respiratory syncytial virus (better known as RSV), parainfluenza virus, influenza A and B, and cytomegalovirus. Anti-Allergy vaccination also offers great potential for successful commercial exploitation. This often relies on allergen-specific immunotherapy (STI) (Palma-Carlos et al. 2006), where a patient is administered increasing quantities of allergen to augment their natural tolerance. STI, though often effective, is very time consuming and is not universally applicable. Recombinant hypo-allergenic allergens are also of interest, as they can target specific immune cells. New agents for the prophylaxis and treatment of allergic disease are legion: recombinant proteins, peptides, immunomodulatory therapy, and DNA vaccines, which are particularly promising tools. Several anti-allergy DNA vaccines are being developed: including optimised expression of allergen genes, CpG-enrichment of delivery vectors, and the targeting of hypoallergenic DNA vaccines. Vaccines against the common cold or anti-allergy vaccines lie close to so-called life-style vaccines. None of these vaccines necessarily saves lives but does reduce hugely important economic effects of disease morbidity. Life-style vaccines target dental caries and drug addiction, as well as genetic and civilisation diseases, such as obesity.",

Gardasil, the new human papillomavirus vaccine (Hung et al. 2008), was licensed in 2006 with the goal of saving 4,000 deaths a year from cervical cancer. Cancer is the second greatest cause of death in the developed world after cardiovascular disease; yet most of the 250,000 deaths from cervical cancer occur in the Third World. Cancer treatment typically involves a combination of chemotherapy, radiotherapy, and surgery. While treating primary tumours this way is largely successful, preventing the metastatic spread of disease is not. Cancer vaccines are attractive, both clinically and commercially, since they exploit immunity\u2019s ability to recognise and destroy tumours. Tumour cells express several mutated or differentially expressed antigens, enabling the immune system to discriminate between non-malignant and cancerous cells. Tumour antigens form the basis of both subunit and epitope-based vaccines. Host immune system responses to tumour-antigen cancer vaccines are often weak, necessitating the use of adjuvants.",

Vaccinology has, until relatively recently, been a primarily empirical science, relying on tried-and-tested \u2013 yet poorly understood \u2013 approaches to vaccine development. As a consequence of this, few effective vaccines were developed and deployed during the 150 years following Jenner: most targets remained inaccessible to science to the emerging science of vaccinology. The success of a vaccine can be measured by its strength, its specificity, the duration of the immune response, and its capacity to create immunological memory. A vaccine is a molecular or supramolecular agent which can elicit specific protective immunity and ultimately mitigate the effect of subsequent infection. Vaccination is the use of a vaccine, in whatever form, to produce active prophylactic immunity in a host organism.",

Safety difficulties have led to the subsequent development of other strategies for vaccine development. The most successful alternative has focused on the antigen \u2013 or subunit \u2013 vaccine, such as recombinant Hepatitis B vaccine (Ebo et al. 2008). Vaccines based around sets of epitopes have also gained ground in recent years. They can be delivered into the host in many ways: as naked DNA vaccines, using live viral or bacterial vectors, and via antigen-loaded antigen presenting cells. Adjuvants are substances, such as alum, which are used with weak vaccines to increase immune responses (O\u2019Hagan et al. 2001).",

While it is possible to assess in the laboratory those properties of vaccine which make it successfully, it is not practical to do on the scale of a large pathogen genome. Immunomics is a solution to this dilemma. It is a post-genomic systems biology approach to immunology that explores mechanistic aspects of the immune system (De Groot 2006). It subsumes immunoinformatics and computational vaccinology, combining several fields, including genomics, proteomics, immunology and clinical medicine. To date, a key focus of immunomics has been the development of algorithms for the design and discovery of new vaccines. Here we outline currently available techniques and software for vaccine discovery as well as examples of how such algorithms can be applied. We concentrate on four areas: antigen prediction, epitope prediction, vector design, and adjuvant identification.",

If sufficient quantities of the epitope are presented, the T Cell may trigger an adaptive immune response specific for the pathogen. MHC Class I and Class II molecules form complexes with different types of peptide. The Class I molecule binds a peptide of 8\u201315 amino acids in length within a single closed groove. The peptide is secured largely through interactions with anchoring residues at the N- and C-termini of the peptide, while the central region is more flexible (Rammensee et al. 1999). Class II peptides vary in length from 12 to 25 amino acids and are bound by the protrusion of peptide side chains into cavities within the groove and through a series of hydrogen bonds formed between the main chain peptide atoms and the side chains atoms of the MHC molecule (Jardetzky et al. 1996). Unlike the Class I molecule, where the binding site is closed at either end, the peptide can extend out of both open ends of the binding groove.",

These include motif-based systems, Support Vector Machines (SVMs) (Donnes and Elofsson 2002; Liu et al. 2006; Wan et al. 2006), Hidden Markov Models (HMMs) (Noguchi et al. 2002), QSAR analysis (Doytchinova et al. 2005), and structure-based approaches (Davies et al. 2006; Davies et al. 2003; Wan et al. 2004). MHC-binding motifs are a straightforward and easily comprehended method of epitope detection, yet produce many false-positive and many false-negative results. Support Vector Machines (SVMs) are machine learning algorithms based on statistical theory that seeks to separate data into two distinct classes (in this case binders and non-binders). HMMs are statistical models where the system being modelled is assumed to be a Markov process with unknown parameters. In an HMM, the internal state is not visible directly, but variables influenced by the state are. HMMs aim to determine the hidden parameters from observable ones. An HMM profile can be used to determine those sequences with \u2018binder-like\u2019 qualities. QSAR analysis techniques have been used to refine the peptide interactions with the MHC Class I groove by incrementally improving and optimising the individual residue-to-residue interactions within the binding groove. This has led to the design of so-called superbinders that minimise the entropic disruption in the groove and are therefore able to stabilise even disfavoured residues within so-called anchor positions. Finally, molecular dynamics has been used to quantify the energetic interactions between the MHC molecule and peptide for both Class I and Class II by analysis of the three-dimensional structure of the MHC-peptide complex.",

Each B cell produces a unique antibody due to the effects of somatic hypermutation and gene segment rearrangement. Those cells, within the primary repertoire whose antibodies convey antigen recognition, are selected for clonal expansion, an iterative process of directed hypermutation and antigen-mediated selection. This facilitates the rapid maturation of antigen-specific antibodies with a high affinity for a specific epitope. A B cell appropriate to deal with a specific infection is selected and cloned to deal with the primary infection, and a population of the B cell is then maintained in the body to combat secondary infection.

B Cell epitopes can be divided into continuous (linear) and discontinuous (conformational), the latter being regions of the antigen separated within the sequence but brought together in the folded protein to form a three-dimensional interface. Another problem with B cell epitopes relates to the fact that they are commonly divided into two groups: continuous epitopes and discontinuous epitopes. Continuous epitopes correspond to short peptide fragments of a few amino acid residues that can be shown to cross-react with antibodies raised against the intact protein. Since the residues involved in antibody binding represent a continuous segment of the primary sequence of the protein they are also referred to as \u2018linear\u2019 or \u2018sequential\u2019 epitopes. Studies have shown that this class of epitope often contains residues that are not implicated in antibody interaction, while some residues play a more important role than others in antibody binding. Discontinuous epitopes are composed of amino acid residues that are not sequential in the primary sequence of a protein antigen but brought into spatial proximity by the three-dimensional folding of the peptide chain (Greenbaum et al. 2007).",

However, to date, the amino acid distribution of the complementary antigen surface has been difficult to characterise, presenting no unique sequential or structural features upon which to base a predictive system. It is partly for this reason that B Cell epitope has lagged far behind T Cell prediction in terms of accuracy but also because most of the data upon which predictions are based remain open to question due to the poorly understood recognition properties of cross-reactive antibodies. One of the central problems with B cell epitope prediction is that the epitopes themselves are entirely context dependent. The surface of a protein is, by definition, a continuous landscape of potential epitopes that is without borders. Therefore both epitope and paratope are fuzzy recognition sites, forming not a single arrangement of specific amino acids but a series of alternative conformations. In this instance, a binary classification of binder and non-binder may simply not reflect the nature of the interaction. A factor also to be considered is that the average paratope consists of only a third of the residues within the CDR loops, suggesting the remaining two-thirds could potentially bind to an antigen with an entirely different protein surface.",

Since the majority of antibodies raised against complete proteins do not cross-react with peptide fragments derived from the same protein it is thought that the majority of epitopes are discontinuous. It is estimated that approximately 10% of epitopes on a globular protein antigen are truly continuous in nature. In spite of the this, the majority of research into B cell epitope prediction has focussed largely on linear peptides on the grounds that they are discrete sequences and easier to analyse.

Unfortunately, the wide variety of different epitope surfaces that can be bound made it impossible to determine any such motifs. More sophisticated machine learning approaches such as Artificial Neural Networks have also been applied but never with an accuracy exceeding 60%. More recently, structural analysis of known antigens has been used to determine the surface accessibility of residues as a measure of the probability that they are part of an epitope site. Despite these fundamental limitations, several B Cell epitope prediction programs are available including Discotope (Andersen et al. 2006), 3DEX (Schreiber et al. 2005) and CEP (Kulkarni-Kale et al. 2005). Both CEP and Discotope measure the surface accessibility of residues although neither has been developed to the point where they can identify coherent epitope regions rather than individual residues. A recent review of B cell epitope software (Ponomarenko and Bourne 2007) calculated the AROC curves for the evaluated methods were about 0.6 (indicating 60% accuracy) for DiscoTope, ConSurf (which identifies functional regions in proteins), and PPI-PRED (protein\u2013protein interface analysis) methods, while protein\u2013protein docking methods were in the region of 65% accuracy, never exceeding 70%. The remaining prediction methods assessed were all close to random. In spite of this, the increasing number of available antigen\u2013antibody structures combined with sophisticated techniques for structural analysis suggests a more methodical approach to the study interface will yield a better understanding of what surfaces can and cannot form stable epitopes. The proposed research will take several different approaches to this problem that will lead to a more comprehensive understanding of antibody\u2013antigen interactions.",

Rather than concentrate on epitope and non-epitope regions, the method used bacterial, viral, and tumour protein datasets to derive statistical models for predicting whole protein antigenicity. The models showed prediction accuracy up to 89%, indicating a far higher degree of accuracy than has, for example, been obtained previously for B Cell epitope prediction. Such a method is an imperfect beginning; future research will yield significantly more insight as the number of known protective antigens increases.",

In NERVE, the processing of potential ORFs is a six-step process. It begins with the prediction of subcellular localisation, followed by the calculation of probability of the protein being adhesion, the identification of TM domains, a comparison with the human proteome and then with that of the selected pathogen, after which the protein is assigned a putative function. The vaccine candidates are then filtered and ranked based upon these calculations. While it is generally accepted that determining ORFs is a relatively straightforward process, the algorithm used to define extracellular proteins from other proteins needs to be carefully selected. One of the most effective programs that can be used for this purpose is HensBC, a recursive algorithm for predicting the subcellular location of proteins. The program constructs a hierarchical ensemble of classifiers by applying a series of if-then rules. HensBC is able to assign proteins to one of four different types (cytoplasmic, mitochondrial, nuclear, or extracellular) with approximately 80% accuracy for Gram-negative bacterial proteins. The algorithm is non-specialised and can be applied to any genome. Any protein identified as being extracellular could be a potential vaccine candidate.",

Vaccines based upon the capsular proteins have been developed for all the serotypes with the exception of subgroup B. The Neisseria meningitides genome was scanned for potential ORFs (Tettelin et al. 2000; Pizza et al. 2000b). Out of the 570 proteins that were identified, 350 could be successfully expressed in vitro and 85 of these were determined to be surface exposed. Seven identified proteins conferred immunity over a broad range of strains within the natural N. meningitidis population, demonstrating the viability of in silico analysis as an aid to finding candidates for the clinical development of a MenB vaccine. Another example of the successful application of reverse vaccinology is Streptococcus pneumoniae, a major cause of sepsis, pneumonia, meningitis, and otitis media in young children (Wizemann et al. 2001; Maione et al. 2005). Mining of the genome identified 130 potential ORFs with significant homology to other bacterial surface proteins and virulence factors. 108 of 130 ORFs were successfully expressed and purified; six proteins were found to induce protective antibodies against pneumococcal challenge in a mouse sepsis model. All six of these candidates showed a high degree of cross-reactivity against the majority of capsular antigens expressed in vivo and which are believed to be immunogenic in humans.",

Viral delivery of genes has effectively targeted inter alia haemophilia, coronary heart disease, muscular dystrophy, arthritis, and cancer. Despite their immanent capacity to transfer genes into cells, concerns over safety, manufacturing, restricted targeting ability and plasmid size have limited deployment of effective and generic gene therapy approaches. This remains a key objective for vaccinology. Vectors for gene therapy and vaccines differ in their requirements, yet both must overcome issues of targeting, plasmid cargo, and adverse immunogenicity. For example, up to 10% of the vaccinia genome can be replaced by DNA coding for antigens from other pathogens. The resulting vector generates strong antibody and T cell responses, and is protective. Viruses commonly used as vectors include Poxviruses, Adeno, varicella, polio, and influenza. Bacterial vectors include both Mycobacterium bovis and Salmonella. Adding extra DNA coding for large molecule adjuvants greatly can exacerbate antibody or T cell responses.",

Adjuvants are defined as any chemical which is able to enhance an immune response when applied simultaneously with a vaccine and thus improve the efficacy of vaccination (Harish et al. 2006); Singh and O\u2019Hagan 2002. It is possible that some adjuvants act as immune potentiators, triggering an early innate immune response that enhances the vaccine effectiveness by increasing the vaccine uptake. Adjuvants may also enhance vaccination by improving the depot effect, the co-localisation of the antigen, and immune potentiators by delaying the spread of the antigen from the site of infection so that absorption occurs over a prolonged period (Stills 2005). Aluminium hydroxide or Alum is the only adjuvant currently licensed in humans. Aluminium-based adjuvants prolong antigen persistence due to the depot effect, as well as stimulating the production of IgG1 and IgE antibodies (Gupta 1998) and triggering the secretion of interleukin-4. There are also several small-molecule, drug-like adjuvants, such as imiquimod, resiquimod, and other imidazoquinolines (Singh and Srivastava 2003; Schijns 2003; Iellem et al. 2001). Other small molecules that have been investigated for adjuvant properties include Monophosphoryl-Lipid A, muramyl dipeptide, QS21, PLG, and Seppic ISA-51 (Schijns 2003). In many cases, the adjuvant molecules have displayed toxic properties or showed poor adsorption making them unsuitable for use.

GPCRs are a superfamily of transmembrane proteins responsible for the transduction of a variety of endogenous extracellular signals into an intracellular response (Locati and Murphy 1999; Christopoulos and Kenakin 2002; Gether et al. 2002). Activation of the chemokine receptors triggers an inflammatory response by inducing migration of the leukocytes from circulation to the site of injury or infection. The receptors play a pivotal role in angiogenesis, haematopoiesis, brain and heart development, and there is also evidence that CCR5 precipitates the entry of HIV-1 into CD4+ T cells by the binding of the viral envelope protein gp120 (Bissantz 2003; Deng et al. 1996). There are 18 chemokine receptors and over 45 known chemokine ligands. The chemokines can be divided into the CC and CXC family, the former contains two cysteine residues adjacent within the protein sequence while in the latter they are separated by a single amino acid. CCR4 is a chemokine receptor expressed on Th2-type CD4+ T cells and has been linked to allergic inflammation diseases such as asthma, atopic dermatitis, and allergic rhinitis. There are two chemokines which bind the CCR4 receptor exclusively, CCL22 and CCL17 (Feng et al. 1996). Inhibition of the two ligands has been shown to reduce the migration of T cells to sites of inflammation, suggesting than any CCR4 antagonist could provide an effective treatment for allergic reactions, specifically in the treatment of asthma. Both anti-CCL17 and anti-CCL22 antibodies have been observed to have efficacy, the property that enables a molecule to impart a pharmacological response, in murine asthma models.",

            "text": "It is possible for the CCR4 receptor to act as an adjuvant due to its expression by regulatory T cells (Tregs) that normally downregulate an immune response (Chvatchko et al. 2000). The Tregs inhibit dendritic cell maturation and thus downregulate expression of the co-stimulatory molecule. A successful CCR4 antagonist would therefore be able to enhance human T cell proliferation in an in vitro immune response model by blocking the Treg proliferation. This suggests that an effective CCR4 antagonist would have the properties of an adjuvant. A combination of virtual screening and experimental validation has been used to identify several potential adjuvants capable of inhibiting the proliferation of Tregs. Small-molecule adjuvant discovery is amenable to techniques used routinely by the pharmaceutical industry. Three-dimensional virtual screening is a fast and effective way of identifying molecules by docking a succession of ligands into a defined binding site (Lieberam and Forster 1999). A large database of small molecules can be screened quickly and efficiently in this way. Using \u2018targeted\u2019 libraries containing a specific subset of molecules is often more effective. It is possible to use \u2018privileged fragments\u2019 to construct combinatorial libraries, those which are expected to have increased probability of success. A pharmacophore is a specific three-dimensional map of biological properties common to all active confirmations of a set of ligands exhibiting a particular activity that can be used to discover new molecules with similar properties. Several small molecules that have been investigated for adjuvant properties in this way (Schellhammer and Rarey 2004). More recently, molecules that selectively interfere with chemokine-mediated T Cell migration have shown the potential to act as adjuvants by down-regulating the expression of co-stimulatory molecules, limiting T Cell activation. Small-molecule chemokine receptor antagonists have been identified and shown to be effective at blocking chemokine function in vivo (Charoenvit et al. 2004b; Godessart 2005), although to date no compound has reached a phase II clinical trial.",

This phenomenon is, in part, a by product of the First World\u2019s ever more comfortable, ever more urbanised post-industrial environment. Coupled to decades of better nutrition, medical advances in both treatment regimes and medicines will allow an ever-increasing section of the population to exploit their own genetic predisposition to long life.
