            "text": "Many children and adolescents in the youth welfare system have experienced traumatic stress. They were witness to, and/or themselves victims of, child maltreatment and neglect, domestic violence, or emotional, physical, or sexual abuse. It is estimated that up to 78% of children and adolescents cared for by the youth welfare system had been exposed to traumatic events and 58% had experienced multiple traumatic events [1]. Youths with a trauma history, particularly those living in residential care, have an elevated risk of mental health problems such as anxiety, depression, externalising disorders, substance abuse, or risk-taking behaviour [2, 3]. Moreover, these traumatic experiences can have long-lasting effects on the young person\u2019s concept of self, cognitive control mechanisms and problem solving, relationships with others, and attachment to caregivers [4\u20136]. In order to account for the maltreatment experiences and trauma-related needs of this high-risk population, efforts have been made to implement trauma-informed care (TIC) practices in various psychosocial settings, especially youth welfare settings [7\u20139]. But TIC concepts should not be limited to residential group homes and youth welfare institutions [10]. They are relevant for all psychosocial settings, such as juvenile justice institutions [11, 12], special needs schools, child and adolescent, as well as, adult psychiatric settings [13], paediatric health care networks [14], shelters for the homeless, refugee centres (9), rehabilitation and detox centres [15] etc. A systematic review [16] of TIC literature on concepts with staff training reported 23 implementation and evaluation studies. The conclusion is, that TIC may improve clinical practice and can reduce trauma symptoms and the psychopathology of clients. Due to the high prevalence of traumatic life events in young people living in out of home placement and the need of placement continuity, some countries have realized countrywide implementation processes [17\u201319]. The challenge for youth welfare, juvenile justice, mental health institutions regarding the implementation process of TIC is that lies in the process of organization development which includes fundamental changes in attitudes and key processes and scrutinizes established institutional practice and structures [20, 21]. However, overall the implementation of TIC is associated with higher staff satisfaction [22].",

TIC conceptualises, and reframes, problem behaviour in the context of an individual\u2019s traumatic experience(s), and involves anticipating and avoiding institutional and individual practices that could increase the risk of traumatic re-enactment [25]. Besides addressing the needs of traumatised individuals, TIC further aims to promote the self-efficacy and work related resilience of youth welfare staff, by guiding them to a better understanding of their countertransference and personal stress symptoms and by promoting their self-care [23, 26\u201328]. Continuous self-awareness and self-care may reduce stress and distress among social-service professionals, thereby enhancing work satisfaction and quality of care in the institution [29, 30]. The ability of staff members, who interact with severely traumatised children, to cope with stress and apply self-efficacy, are key factors for alternative correctional experiences, the reorganisation of trustful relationships and positive attachment representations (f. ex. [22, 24, 31, 32]).",

            "text": "Youth welfare employees are continuously exposed to the traumatic experiences and challenging emotional and behavioural coping strategies of their clients and are at increased risk for developing burnout and secondary traumatic stress [28, 30, 33]. Furthermore, traumatic experiences of the children and adolescents may increase the risk of escalating interactions and physical violence against youth welfare staff [34, 35]. Much of the abundant literature on the association between traumatic experiences and auto- aggression has come to the conclusion that traumatic experiences in childhood are a prominent risk factor for aggressive behaviour and conduct problems throughout the course of a survivors\u2019 life [12, 36\u201343]. The close correlation could be explained, for example, by the misinterpretation of specific social interactions [44\u201348], model learning, deficits in implicit and explicit emotion regulation [49], especially the self-regulation of aggressive impulses, deficits in the ability to mentalise and be empathic [50] . Since adverse childhood experiences are associated with an impaired ability to regulate or tolerate negative emotions, as well as externalising types of behaviour, affected youths may find themselves relying on counterproductive and detrimental coping strategies, such as opposition, aggression or delinquency when confronted with challenging emotions and situations (e.g., trauma triggers) [36\u201339]. Therefore, it is not surprising that frequent exposure to client aggression is a common reality in the professional life of social workers [34, 35, 51]. Alink et al. [34] found that 81% of youth residential care staff experienced client aggression, and about half of them reported physical aggression, within the last year. Another study reported that 91% of youth welfare staff experienced at least one type of verbal and physical aggression, with 53% reporting verbal threats and 24% experiencing physical violence in the past three months [35]. A central aim of TIC is to ensure internal and external safety for both social workers and their clients, including the prospective prevention of violent behaviour [35]. However, the question whether implementation of TIC is associated with a reduction in physical violence against youth welfare staff has barely been investigated. A review on effective strategies for implementing TIC in youth psychiatric and residential treatment settings concluded that TIC might lead to a decrease in client and staff injury rates [8]. However, more longitudinal studies are needed, to demonstrate that TIC significantly improves client and provider safety.",

Cortisol is traditionally measured in the blood, urine, or saliva, but these measurements only reflect short periods of time. In contrast, obtaining hair cortisol concentration (HCC) is a promising approach to measuring long-term cortisol release (for a review see [56]). A recent meta-analysis concluded that HCC is a valid indicator of stress. Individuals with chronic stress exhibited a 22% higher HCC, and among those with ongoing stress, the increase in HCC was around 43% [56]. Since TIC aims to reduce stress levels among professionals working with traumatised clients [23, 26\u201328], it is of great interest to compare whether there are long-term differences in HCC between youth welfare employees from institutions with and without TIC practices.",

In order to create such an atmosphere, it is crucial to address the security and self-efficacy of the residential staff as well as reorganise some key institutional processes. It is necessary that professionals on all levels of the organisation, including Management, are committed to changing their existing attitudes and practices. Therefore, the management staff and counsellors underwent a specific training in organisational development, supervision skills, and burnout prevention. Implementation of TIC requires a long-lasting commitment of the institutions to allocate resources and building capacity, to fully train the staff with respect to values and principles of TIC, e.g., knowledge of neurobiological and behavioural sequelae of trauma, awareness of trauma triggers, intervening in a trauma-sensitive way, and attention to self-care in response to working with traumatised clients [23, 57]. Apart from intensive training, the uptake of TIC practices requires ongoing supervision as well as sufficient time for the transfer of knowledge and the consolidation of new strategies into institutional practice.",

These results indicate that after implementation of TIC, youth welfare staff in these institutions showed significantly reduced stress levels and experienced fewer client physical aggression compared to staff who did not receive training in TIC. The significant reduction after T4 indicates that training and knowledge of psycho-traumatology are not enough to change institutional practice and reduce the stress level of staff [22, 66] and that such implementation processes take time and the allocation of resources [20]. It appears necessary to develop and implement TIC key procedures in those institutional processes and structures focusing on client and staff safety and self-efficacy in interactions, towards a kind of supply chain in which the management supports staff and staff support clients.",

[67] showed that TIC is associated with a decline in staff injury rates. Exposure to client aggression is associated with impaired physiological and emotional well-being and may have implications for work satisfaction and quality of care [46, 68, 69]. Of course, this is a bidirectional association, which could lead to either a positive or a vicious circle: boundary violations against staff lead to insecurity and low self-efficacy, this induces reduced pedagogic presence and positive interactions, which can, in turn, enhance the risk of new boundary-violations [70].",

Furthermore, from a perspective that regards aggression as a failure to regulate emotions in the face of threatening or frustrating situations [60, 71] and through a trauma-sensitive lens, it might be helpful to create an atmosphere of shared decision-making with youths and thus promote their self-regulation and coping skills [72]. The staff\u2019s ability to regulate and contain their own emotions in highly stressful interactions is of equal importance in order to recognise and adapt to the young people\u2019s needs [73]. As noted above, client physical aggression is highly prevalent in residential youth welfare institutions and may be seen as an innate and unavoidable occupational hazard [35, 73]. Therefore, the staff should work within the framework of institutional structures that encourage communication and the sharing of their concerns and highly emotional experiences in these challenging situations [74].",

McElvaney and Tatlow-Golden [75] report that professionals working in the care and youth justice system describe themselves as feeling helpless, frustrated and incompetent in the face of the complex mental health needs of their clients. The authors conclude that the staffs own psychological response mirrors the traumatic response of their clients thus, the staff members feel traumatised themselves, thereby possibly contributing to further client traumatisation. High rates of traumatic stress and/or compassion fatigue are common among youth welfare staff and may lead to job burnout, work withdrawal, and turnover [76\u201378].",

Moreover, TIC-trained study participants\u2019 experienced significantly less physical client aggression than those who did not receive TIC training at T4. Training of individuals to support the adoption of TIC may be time-consuming and demanding and requires a long-term commitment of the institutions and their employees.

Employees who feel less stressed and experience fewer physical assaults may be able to offer a better quality of care for their clients and remain in their jobs for longer, thereby fostering stability in the institution.",

As the data was taken from an exploratory study with longitudinal design, the final sample size was small, which might have precluded the ability to identify group differences. The complete set of measurements at the four annual time points was available for only 33% of the study population, which indicates a large participant drop-out rate due to turnover or other reasons. However, we have decided against an imputation of the missing values because participation in the entire implementation process is crucial for evaluating the effectiveness of TIC. High rates of staff turnover are a common problem in social services [76\u201378] and might have contributed to the small sample size in our longitudinal study. However, we controlled the attrition regarding different variables and could not find significant differences regarding psychosocial variables, hair cortisol concentration and burn out risk. The gender differences between IG and CG could be also a relevant limitation. Some studies show, that female staff is at higher risk of boundary violations and sexual harassment at in the workplace [79, 80]. We had very limited possibility to control and specify the correlation between violence against staff and gender in this small sample (we found no difference regarding hair cortisol concentration, TIC and boundary violations p > .175). It will be necessary to prove the effect of gender in studies with greater samples that take into account the effect of gender on boundary violations and hair cortisol concentration, even if we could not observe such an effect in our study.",

Our results suggest that TIC practices can successfully reduce physiological stress and client physical aggression among youth welfare employees working with traumatised children and adolescents. Most notably, we used a biological measure of stress instead of subjective stress ratings, to assess the physiological changes after implementation of TIC practices more accurately. The measured decrease in stress levels among the staff might be associated with the core principles of TIC, such as fostering and maintaining mental hygiene, coherence, mindfulness, and resilience. By implementing operational procedures that guide the staff to a better understanding of their own stress symptoms and promoting self-care, they might be better equipped to recognise and adapt to the young people\u2019s needs and to avoid traumatic re-enactment.
