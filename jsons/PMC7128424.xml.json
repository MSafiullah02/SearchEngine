Viruses such as porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV) [4], [5], pseudo-rabies virus (PRV) [6], [7], porcine arteritis virus (PoAV) [8], swine fever virus [9], [10], [11] and transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV) [12], employ the strategy to evade the host immune system by destroying type-I interferon system when infecting the host.",

The results of antiviral activity titration, Mx protein induction and Mx promoter stimulation are all consistent, indicating that the recombinant PoIFN-\u03b2 expressed in CHO-PoIFN-\u03b2 cells has the natural biological activity and functions of type-I interferon. In addition, the expressed recombinant PoIFN-\u03b2 completely suppressed the 1000 TCID50 of TGEV (110 IU/ml PoIFN-\u03b2CHO) and PRV (1100 IU/ml PoIFN-\u03b2CHO) infection in PK15 cells in vitro, indicating its potential value in clinical therapeutic applications. The result that the antiviral activity of PoIFN-\u03b2 needed was 10 times lower against the TGEV (Coronavirus branch, single-stranded RNA virus) than the PRV (Herpesviridae, double-stranded DNA virus) indicates that PoIFN-\u03b2 is more effective against RNA viruses.",

In comparison, recombinant PoIFN-\u03b2 production from CHO cells has great advantages in that the process is simple, the product composition is easy to control, and the protein yield of PoIFN-\u03b2 in this study is 70 times higher. Human IFN-\u03b1 expression in mammalian cells could reach the level of 2.4 \u00d7 107\n IU/ml [41], 10 times the expression of IFN-\u03b2 in this study. The difference in the expression levels may be due to the differences in screening tags, promoters, cells, IFN activity detection systems and units defined for activity, etc. By optimizing the culture medium and cultivation techniques, it is expected that expression levels can be greatly increased to meet future demand for industrial production.
