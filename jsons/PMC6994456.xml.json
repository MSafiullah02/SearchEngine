            "text": "During the last 30 years, much emphasis has been placed on the importance of patient-reported outcome measures (PROM) in research investigating patients hospitalised in critical care [1]. It is well established that oral health status is one of the determinants of quality of life [2]. Poor oral health has been shown to negatively impact quality of life across different populations [3\u20138]. Therefore, it is of concern that recent evidence suggests that hospitalisation is associated with deterioration in oral health as shown by increased plaque levels, gingival bleeding and xerostomia [9, 10]. The decline in oral health during hospitalisation is of the utmost importance: this population is more vulnerable to oral disease, this deterioration may potentially affect their quality of life and poor oral health may result in a greater risk of Ventilator Associated Pneumonia (VAP) as it is reported that VAP-associated pathogens may translocate from the oral cavity into the lungs. When patients develop VAP, this infection results in an increase of mortality, length of CCU stay and cost. A systematic review that included 11 trials and 3242 patients concluded that \u201cOral decontamination of mechanically ventilated adults using antiseptics is associated with a lower risk of ventilator associated pneumonia\u201d indicating that fourteen patients would need to receive this intervention to prevent one case of VAP [11]. Poor oral health might add an additional burden, affecting the patient\u2019s comfort and limiting the ability to eat and speak in these already compromised patients [12]. Therefore, deterioration of oral health in CCU patients might constitute a public health issue, as it could reduce quality of life, with evidence indicating that it also confers an increased risk for nosocomial infections [11]. A major limiting factor to further research is the absence of a validated tool to measure oral health-related quality of life in CCU patients. Commonly used generic OHQoL questionnaires include a large number of questions which are irrelevant for the critically ill given their life circumstances, limiting their applicability in this setting. Furthermore, these questionnaires take a long time to complete and are not feasible if the patients are frail and severely compromised, as it is the case in a CCU, because of the burden placed on patients and/or healthcare givers. Therefore, the aim of this study was to develop and validate a suitable tool to assess the impact of critical care on oral health-related quality of life (OHQoL) and to investigate patient-reported outcome measures of OHQoL in patients hospitalised in a CCU.",

A literature search was performed which ascertained that no research was available in relation to OHQoL in CCU nor were there any validated tools to measure the OHQoL of patients at a CCU. We reviewed the literature to identify the most common oral health problems experienced by those hospitalised in CCU. We mapped the items and domains obtained from the literature and sought advice from a panel of experts, including consultants and nurses in critical care and experts in oral care and public health, to compare them against existing OHQoL tools validated in other settings. The domains and items were revised and re-presented to the expert panel until consensus was reached.",

Fourteen out of the 15 items loaded highly on no more than one particular dimension (see Table 3). The four items in the first rotated principal component describe functional limitations and include four out of the five items which were included by our expert panel within this dimension and therefore maintained the name of the original dimension. Items referring to psychosocial impacts (items 14 and 17) were found in the second factor only. In addition, this factor also included items 9 and 10 which were included in the oral symptoms dimension. Item 10 may well have been considered by patients as an indicator of a social interaction and this factor was therefore named \u201cPsychosocial impacts\u201d. The third dimension/factor included the two items measuring symptoms of dry mouth and was therefore named \u201cXerostomia\u201d. The main item tapping into the 5th factor was question 16. The second highest factor loading (although just short of the cut-off 0.55 value) in this dimension was item 15, which was also the only other item with a factor loading above 0.3 for this component. Since items 15 and 16 were the two items originally included in the dimension \u201cSelf-care\u201d, this component retained this name. Finally, the fourth factor referred to questions 3 and 9. Question 3 was included as an item for \u201cSatisfaction with oral health\u201d and seems unrelated to question 9; therefore, it is difficult to discern to which specific dimension these items may be tapping and remained unnamed.",

Similar to our findings, hospitalisation resulted in worsening of oral health and low OHQoL in other hospitalised populations [22\u201324]. Yu and co-workers showed that for Chinese geriatric patients, the disruption of the normal daily living routine as a result of hospitalisation translated to a worsening of oral health and low OHQoL [22]. Additionally, Schimmel and co-workers compared the OHQoL of 31 hospitalised stroke patients who presented with hemi-facial and/or limb palsy at the University Hospital of Geneva (Switzerland) to that of 24 subjects with similar age, gender and dental status [23]. The results also indicated a lower OHQoL in the hospitalised population compared with the control group. The OHIP-EDENT [25] mean score was 12.3 \u00b1 17.7 in the control group and 18.8 \u00b1 15.5 in the hospitalised population (p = 0.01), with higher scores indicating lower OHQoL. Also in accordance with the previous studies, Cornejo et al. [24] in a cross-sectional study amongst 194 institutionalised elderly in Barcelona (Spain) found that 67% of the participants had poor OHQoL and this was associated with self-reported poor oral health. All in all, it seems that the decline of quality of life due to a worsening of the oral health might be more marked in unwell and hospitalised patients. Extrapolating what we know about the impact of critical care on the HQoL and the impact of poor oral health on the OHQoL of medically compromised patients as discussed above in addition to the results of our study, it could be possible that some of the deterioration in HQoL of the critically ill is due to changes in oral health. In order to improve patient care, we need to know what OHQoL means to patients and what experiences they relate to their stay in CCU. Experiences of critically ill patients are an important aspect of the quality of the care and are essential to guide bedside decisions in the CCU; they should be placed at the centre of public health debate.",

Since the care received at the CCU would ultimately influence the oral health of the critically ill, this is an extremely important finding encouraging the search of new interventions and care pathways to maintain oral health following admission to a CCU, being this an important public health matter. By including this OHQoL tool in future research, influential data will be provided to decision makers for the development of health promotion and may help to identify a group of patients for whom new care pathways aimed at improving oral health are needed [28].
