From 1990 to 1994, a further 112 cases of imported infections, mostly Guangdong residents, were reported and by the end of this period, 12 of Guangdong's 21 prefectures had at least one HIV case.

Although a majority of newly-diagnosed cases of HIV infection continued to report heterosexual contact as their infection route, Guangdong's first HIV infection reported as acquired via drug injection had been identified by 1996. From 1997 to 2007, the HIV epidemic in Guangdong province was in a rapid growth phase, which was characterized by an explosion in HIV prevalence among people who inject drugs (PWID). Although infection via heterosexual contact continued to occur during this period as well, it was not until 2008, when it regained its position as the most common HIV transmission route in Guangdong. Also in 1998, the first cases of infection via homosexual contact emerged, and thereafter, HIV prevalence began to increase among men who have sex with men (MSM). For the first time, in 2012, the male-male sexual contact route had surpassed the injecting drug use route in terms of transmission event frequency. By the end of 2017, a cumulative 81,641 cases of HIV infection had been reported in Guangdong, among whom 33,993 had progressed to AIDS, and 21,006 had died.",

Among these 81,586 HIV/AIDS cases, a majority were male (81%), and most were either in their twenties or thirties (60% ; Table 34 .1). The main routes of transmission were heterosexual contact (55%) and injection drug use (21%). Although, a majority were residents (59%) and a relatively large proportion were not legal permanent residents (41%). Finally, the most densely populated central region of Guangdong had the largest proportion of HIV cases (71%), compared to the western region (20%) and the eastern region (9%; Fig. 34 .1). When the 1997 to 2017 time period is divided into smaller spans of years, some trends are observable. For example, the age profile trended older-half of all PLWH diagnosed between 1997 and 2002 were in their twenties (52%), but only roughly one-quarter of PLWH diagnosed between 2013 and 2017 were (28%), whereas less 2% were in their fifties between 1997 and 2002 and 24% were in their fifties between 2013 and 2017. Similarly, the proportion of PLWH who were non-residents increased over time from 12% in the 1997 to 2002 period to 46% in the 2013 to 2017 period (Table 34 .1).",

The dramatic increase in HIV cases among men between 2003 and 2005 may be, at least in part, due to HIV testing campaigns that were conducted in detention centers during this time. The dominant transmission route shifted from injection drug use (85%) in the 1997-2002 period to heterosexual contact (56%) in the 2013-2017 period, with other transmission routes emerging then as well-homosexual contact (30%), and mother-to-child transmission (0.3%; Table 34 .1 and Fig. 34 .3).",

The results show that the HIV prevalence has been at a stable, low level since 2008. One possible explanation for the higher prevalence estimates in 2007 and prior may be the differences between samples drawn from detention centers versus communities. In general, low-fee FSW in China face a higher risk of incarceration due to their relatively greater exposure-they are not conducting business from inside a venue and do not have the protection of a venue owner and other FSW. Furthermore, evidence indicates that low-fee FSW tend to have higher HIV prevalence due in large part to their reduced ability to negotiate condom use because of economic pressures and vulnerability to client violence. The higher HIV prevalence in earlier years when samples were taken from detention centers is therefore not surprising.",

In another study conducted in Guangzhou, no HIV infection was found among high-and mid-tier FSW sampled but found a 2.63% HIV prevalence among low-tier FSW participants ). This study also reported that street-based FSW tended to have lower levels of education, to be supporting their families, to charge less for their services, and to remain in the commercial sex industry for a longer time, compared to establishment-based FSW. Also, the proportion of low-fee FSW consistently using condoms with clients and with regular, non-commercial partners was lower than for the mid-and high-fee FSW. The prevalence of syphilis, gonorrhea, and chlamydia was also higher among street-based FSW (Li et al. 2012 ).

Therefore, it is likely that many MSM have HIV infection and still do not know their status, further causing underestimation of the HIV Since MSM tend to be \"hidden\" because of persistent stigma and discrimination, epidemiological survey data have historically been somewhat scarce.
