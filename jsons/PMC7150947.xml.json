However, some recent human coronavirus infections have resulted in lethal endemics, which include the SARS (Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome) and MERS (Middle East Respiratory Syndrome) endemics. Both of these are caused by zoonotic coronaviruses that belong to the genus Betacoronavirus within Coronaviridae. SARS-CoV originated from Southern China and caused an endemic in 2003. A total of 8098 cases of SARS were reported globally, including 774 associated deaths, and an estimated case-fatality rate of 14%\u201315% [10]. The first case of MERS occurred in Saudi Arabia in 2012. Since then, a total of 2,494 cases of infection have been reported, including 858 associated deaths, and an estimated high case-fatality rate of 34.4% [11]. While no case of SARS-CoV infection has been reported since 2004, MERS-CoV has been around since 2012 and has caused multiple sporadic outbreaks in different countries. ",

It has a genome size of ~30 kilobases which, like other coronaviruses, encodes for multiple structural and non-structural proteins. The structural proteins include the spike (S) protein, the envelope (E) protein, the membrane (M) protein, and the nucleocapsid (N) protein. With SARS-CoV-2 being discovered very recently, there is currently a lack of immunological information available about the virus (e.g., information about immunogenic epitopes eliciting antibody or T cell responses). Preliminary studies suggest that SARS-CoV-2 is quite similar to SARS-CoV based on the full-length genome phylogenetic analysis [9,12], and the putatively similar cell entry mechanism and human cell receptor usage [9,13,14]. Due to this apparent similarity between the two viruses, previous research that has provided an understanding of protective immune responses against SARS-CoV may potentially be leveraged to aid vaccine development for SARS-CoV-2.

For the former case, antibody responses generated against the S protein, the most exposed protein of SARS-CoV, have been shown to protect from infection in mouse models [15,16,17]. In addition, multiple studies have shown that antibodies generated against the N protein of SARS-CoV, a highly immunogenic and abundantly expressed protein during infection [18], were particularly prevalent in SARS-CoV-infected patients [19,20]. While being effective, the antibody response was found to be short-lived in convalescent SARS-CoV patients [21]. In contrast, T cell responses have been shown to provide long-term protection [21,22,23], even up to 11 years post-infection [24], and thus have also attracted interest for a prospective vaccine against SARS-CoV [reviewed in [25]]. Among all SARS-CoV proteins, T cell responses against the structural proteins have been found to be the most immunogenic in peripheral blood mononuclear cells of convalescent SARS-CoV patients as compared to the non-structural proteins [26]. Further, of the structural proteins, T cell responses against the S and N proteins have been reported to be the most dominant and long-lasting [27]. ",

These epitopes have the potential, therefore, to elicit a cross-reactive/effective response against SARS-CoV-2. We focused particularly on the epitopes in the S and N structural proteins due to their dominant and long-lasting immune response previously reported against SARS-CoV. For the identified T cell epitopes, we additionally incorporated the information about the associated MHC alleles to provide a list of epitopes that seek to maximize population coverage globally, as well as in China. Our presented results can potentially narrow down the search for potent targets for an effective vaccine against SARS-CoV-2, and help guide experimental studies focused on vaccine development.",

This tool uses the distribution of MHC alleles (with at least 4-digit resolution, e.g., A*02:01) within a defined population (obtained from http://www.allelefrequencies.net/) to estimate the population coverage for a set of T cell epitopes. The estimated population coverage represents the percentage of individuals within the population that are likely to elicit an immune response to at least one T cell epitope from the set. To identify the set of epitopes associated with MHC alleles that would maximize the population coverage, we adopted a greedy approach: (i) We first identified the MHC allele with the highest individual population coverage and initialized the set with their associated epitopes, then (ii) we progressively added epitopes associated with other MHC alleles that resulted in the largest increase of the accumulated population coverage. We stopped when no increase in the accumulated population coverage was observed by adding epitopes associated with any of the remaining MHC alleles.",

A straightforward reference-sequence-based comparison indeed confirmed this, showing that the M, N, and E proteins of SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV have over 90% genetic similarity, while that of the S protein was notably reduced (but still high) (Figure 1a). The similarity between SARS-CoV-2 and MERS-CoV, on the other hand, was substantially lower for all proteins (Figure 1a); a feature that was also evident from the corresponding phylogenetic trees (Figure 1b). We note that while the former analysis (Figure 1a) was based on the reference sequence of each coronavirus, it is indeed a good representative of the virus population, since few amino acid mutations have been observed in the corresponding sequence data (Figure S1). It is also noteworthy that while MERS-CoV is the more recent coronavirus to have infected humans, and is comparatively more recurrent (causing outbreaks in 2012, 2015, and 2018) (https://www.who.int/emergencies/mers-cov/en/), SARS-CoV-2 is closer to SARS-CoV, which has not been observed since 2004.

We aligned these T cell epitopes across the SARS-CoV-2 protein sequences. Among the 115 T cell epitopes that were determined by positive T cell assays (Table 1), we found that 27 epitope-sequences were identical within SARS-CoV-2 proteins and comprised no mutation in the available SARS-CoV-2 sequences (as of 21 February 2020) (Table 2). Interestingly, all of these were present in either the N (16) or S (11) protein. MHC binding assays were performed for 19 of these 27 epitopes, and these were reported to be associated with only five distinct MHC alleles (at 4-digit resolution): HLA-A*02:01, HLA-B*40:01, HLA-DRA*01:01, HLA-DRB1*07:01, and HLA-DRB1*04:01. Consequently, the accumulated population coverage of these epitopes (see Materials and Methods for details) is estimated to not be high for the global population (59.76%), and was quite low for China (32.36%). For the remaining 8 epitopes, since the associated MHC alleles are unknown, they could not be used in the population coverage computation. Additional MHC binding tests to identify the MHC alleles that bind to these 8 epitopes may reveal additional distinct alleles, beyond the five determined so far, that may help to improve population coverage.",

Nonetheless, they also present promising candidates for inducing a response against SARS-CoV-2. For the expanded set of epitopes, all of which have at least one positive MHC binding assay, we found that 229 epitope-sequences have an identical match in SARS-CoV-2 proteins and have associated MHC allele information available (listed in Table S2). Of these 229 epitopes, ~82% were MHC Class I restricted epitopes (Table S3). Importantly, 102 of the 229 epitopes were derived from either the S (66) or N (36) protein. Mapping all 66 S-derived epitopes onto the resolved crystal structure of the SARS-CoV S protein (Figure S2) revealed that 3 of these (GYQPYRVVVL, QPYRVVVLSF, and PYRVVVLSF) were located entirely in the SARS-CoV receptor-binding motif (https://www.uniprot.org/uniprot/P59594), known to be important for virus cell entry [34].

Our aim was to determine sets of epitopes associated with MHC alleles with maximum population coverage, potentially aiding the development of vaccines against SARS-CoV-2. For selection, we adopted a greedy computational approach (see Materials and Methods), which identified a set of T cell epitopes estimated to maximize global population coverage. This set comprised of multiple T cell epitopes associated with 20 distinct MHC alleles and was estimated to provide an accumulated population coverage of 96.29% (Table 3). Interestingly, the majority of the T cell epitopes for which a positive immune response has been determined using T cell assays (Table 2) were presented by the globally most-prevalent MHC allele (shown in blue color in Table 3). Moreover, the functionally important epitopes located in the SARS-CoV receptor binding motif were associated with the second and third most-prevalent MHC alleles (underlined in Table 3). Thus, while the ordering of T cell epitopes in Table 3 is based on the estimated global population coverage of the associated MHC alleles, it is also a natural order in which these epitopes should be tested experimentally for determining their potential to induce a positive immune response against SARS-CoV-2. We also computed the population coverage of this specific set of epitopes in China, the country most affected by the COVID-19 outbreak, which was estimated to be slightly lower (88.11%), as certain MHC alleles (e.g., HLA-A*02:01) associated with some of these epitopes are less frequent in the Chinese population (Table 3). Repeating the same greedy approach but focusing on the Chinese population, instead of a global population, the maximum population coverage was estimated to be 92.76% (Table S4).",

Specifically, 20 of the 23 linear epitopes (Table 4) mapped to S2 (Figure 2b). Thus, the antibodies targeting the identified linear epitopes in the S2 subunit might cross-react and neutralize both SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2, as suggested in a very recent study [43]. While S2 is comparatively less exposed than S1, it may be accessible to antibodies during the complex conformational changes involved in viral entry of coronaviruses [44,45,46]; though this remains to be more clearly understood. In contrast, the 3 discontinuous B cell epitopes (Table 5) mapped onto the more exposed S1 subunit (Figure 2c, left panel), which contains the receptor-binding motif of the SARS-CoV S protein [34]. We observed that very few residues of the 3 discontinuous epitopes were identical within SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 (Figure 2c, right panel). These differences suggest that the SARS-CoV-specific antibodies S230, m396, and 80R known to bind to these epitopes in SARS-CoV might not be able to bind to the same regions in SARS-CoV-2 S protein. Interestingly, while this paper was under review, this has been confirmed experimentally [47]. Further studies are currently under way to identify other SARS-CoV antibodies that may bind to discontinuous epitopes of the SARS-CoV-2 S protein [48]. ",

This important observation should not be taken for granted. Despite the apparent similarity between SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2, there is still considerable genetic variation between the two, and it is not obvious a-prior if epitopes that elicit an immune response against SARS-CoV are likely to be effective against SARS-CoV-2. We found that only 23% and 16% of known SARS-CoV T cell and B cell epitopes map identically to SARS-CoV-2, respectively, and with no mutation having been observed in these epitopes among the available SARS-CoV-2 sequences (as of 21 February 2020).

On the B cell side, in agreement with very recent experimental studies [47,48], our results suggest that SARS-CoV-derived antibodies targeting the receptor binding motif in the S1 subunit of the SARS-CoV-2 S protein may not be effective, due to the large genetic mismatches observed in known structural epitopes targeting this domain. Linear SARS-CoV-derived B cell epitopes in the S2 subunit may potentially be more promising candidates for inducing a protective antibody response. Numerous of these epitopes, while being less exposed, are found to map identically to SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2, and preliminary results are already emerging which suggest their potential in generating cross-reactive and neutralizing antibodies [43]. Hence, vaccine solutions that attempt to induce antibodies that target the S2 linear epitopes may be effective and should be explored further.",

Again, there are multiple differences to our work. First, the focus of that study was on MHC Class II epitopes, while here we considered both MHC Class I and II epitopes. Interestingly, while we found a few MHC Class II epitopes using our approach (Table S3), only one of these (HLA-DRB1*01:01) appeared in our identified epitope set (Table 3), due to their comparatively low estimated population coverage. Second, computational tools were used to predict MHC Class II epitopes in [55], while here we analyzed the SARS-CoV-derived epitopes that have been determined experimentally, using either positive T cell or MHC binding assays, and which match identically with the available SARS-CoV-2 sequences (as of 21 February 2020). Thus, our identified epitopes are seemingly a more rational set of potential targets that can assist in the ongoing search for a SARS-CoV-2 vaccine.",
