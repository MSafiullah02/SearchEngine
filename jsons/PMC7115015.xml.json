            "text": "Mechanical sensors consist of a fixed and a movable part. The movable part can be a thin membrane, a plate or a beam, fixed at one or both ends. The structures described here are called cantilevers. A cantilever is regarded here as a microfabricated rectangular bar-shaped structure that is longer than it is wide and has a thickness that is much smaller than its length or width. It is a horizontal structural element supported only at one end on a chip body; the other end is free (Fig. 15.1). Most often it is used as a mechanical probe to image the topography of a sample using a technique called atomic force microscopy (AFM) or scanning force microscopy (SFM) [15.1],\ninvented by Binnig et al. in the mid 1980s [15.1]. For AFM a microfabricated sharp tip is attached to the apex of the cantilever and serves as a local probe to scan the sample surface. The distance between tip and surface is controlled via sensitive measurement of interatomic forces in the piconewton range.\n\n",

SFM methods are nowadays well established in scientific research, education and, to a certain extent, also in industry. Beyond imaging of surfaces, cantilevers have been used for many other purposes.

            "text": "\nThe idea of using beams of silicon as sensors to measure deflections or changes in resonance frequency is actually quite old. First reports go back to 1968, when Wilfinger et al. [15.2] investigated silicon cantilever structures of 50 \u00d7 30 \u00d78  mm3, i.e. quite large structures, for detecting resonances. On the one hand, they used localized thermal expansion in diffused resistors (piezoresistors) located near the cantilever support to create a temperature gradient for actuating the cantilever at its resonance frequency. On the other hand, the piezoresistors could also be used to sense mechanical deflection of the cantilever. This early report already contains concepts for sensing and actuation of cantilevers. In the following years only a few reports are available on the use of cantilevers as sensors, e.g. Heng [15.3], who fabricated gold cantilevers capacitively coupled to microstrip lines in 1971 to mechanically trim high-frequency oscillator circuits. In 1979, Petersen [15.4] constructed cantilever-type micromechanical membrane switches in silicon that should have filled the gap between silicon transistors and mechanical electromagnetic relays. Kolesar [15.5] suggested the use of cantilever structures as electronic nerve-agent detectors in 1985.",

In 1994, Itoh and Suga [15.6] presented a cantilever coated with a thin film of zinc oxide and proposed piezoresistive deflection readout as an alternative to optical beam-deflection readout. Cleveland et al. [15.7] reported the tracking of cantilever resonance frequency to detect nanogram changes in mass loading when small particles are deposited onto AFM probe tips. Thundat et al. [15.8] showed that the resonance frequency as well as static bending of microcantilevers are influenced by ambient conditions, such as moisture adsorption, and that deflection of metal-coated cantilevers can be further influenced by thermal effects (bimetallic effect). The first chemical sensing applications were presented by Gimzewski et al. [15.9], who used static cantilever bending to detect chemical reactions with very high sensitivity. Later Thundat et al. [15.10] observed changes in the resonance frequency of microcantilevers due to adsorption of analyte vapor on exposed surfaces. Frequency changes have been found to be caused by mass loading or adsorption-induced changes in the cantilever spring constant. By coating cantilever surfaces with hygroscopic materials, such as phosphoric acid or gelatin, the cantilever can sense water vapor with picogram mass resolution.",

The cantilever surfaces serve as sensor surfaces and allow the processes taking place on the surface of the beam to be monitored with unprecedented accuracy, in particular the adsorption of molecules. The formation of molecule layers on the cantilever surface will generate surface stress, eventually resulting in a bending of the cantilever, provided the adsorption preferentially occurs on one surface of the cantilever. Adsorption is controlled by coating one surface (typically the upper surface) of a cantilever with a thin layer of a material that exhibits affinity to molecules in the environment (sensor surface). This surface of the cantilever is referred to as the functionalized surface. The other surface of the cantilever (typically the lower surface) may be left uncoated or be coated with a passivation layer, i.e. a chemical surface that does not exhibit significant affinity to the molecules in the environment to be detected. To enable functionalized surfaces to be established, often a metal layer is evaporated onto the surface designed as sensor surface. Metal surfaces, e.g. gold, may be used to covalently bind a monolayer that represents the chemical surface sensitive to the molecules to be detected from environment. Frequently, a monolayer of thiol molecules covalently bound to a gold surface is used. The gold layer is also favorable for use as a reflection layer if the bending of the cantilever is read out via an optical beam-deflection method.",

We will call this process development of compressive surface stress, because the forming self-assembled monolayer produces a downward bending of the cantilever (away from the gold coating). In the opposite situation, i.e. when the cantilever bends upwards, we would speak of tensile stress. If both the upper and lower surfaces of the cantilevers are involved in the reaction, then the situation will be much more complex, as a predominant compressive stress formation on the lower cantilever surface might appear like tensile stress on the upper surface. For this reason, it is of utmost importance that the lower cantilever surface is passivated in order that ideally no processes take place on the lower surface of the cantilever.",

            "text": "To exclude such influences, simultaneous measurement of reference cantilevers aligned in the same array as the sensing cantilevers is crucial [15.11]. As the difference in signals from the reference and sensor cantilevers shows the net cantilever response, even small sensor responses can be extracted from large cantilever deflections without being dominated by undesired effects. When only single microcantilevers are used, no thermal-drift compensation is possible. To obtain useful data under these circumstances, both microcantilever surfaces have to be chemically well defined. One of the surfaces, typically the lower one, has to be passivated; otherwise the cantilever response will be convoluted with undesired effects originating from uncontrolled reactions taking place on the lower surface (Fig. 15.2a). With a pair of cantilevers, reliable measurements are obtained. One cantilever is used as the sensor cantilever (typically coated on the upper side with a molecule layer exhibiting affinity to the molecules to be detected), whereas the other cantilever serves as the reference cantilever. It should be coated with a passivation layer on the upper surface so as not to exhibit affinity to the molecules to be detected. Thermal drifts are canceled out if difference responses, i.e. difference in deflections of sensor and reference cantilevers, are taken. Alternatively, both cantilevers are used as sensor cantilevers (sensor layer on the upper surfaces), and the lower surface has to be passivated (Fig. 15.2b). It is best to use a cantilever array (Fig. 15.2c), in which several cantilevers are used either as sensor or as reference cantilevers so that multiple difference signals can be evaluated simultaneously. Thermal drift is canceled out as one surface of all cantilevers, typically the lower one, is left uncoated or coated with the same passivation layer.\n\n",

In the case of alkanethiol covalently binding to gold, the affinity is very high, resulting in a fast bending response within minutes [15.13]. Polymer sensing layers only exhibit a partial sensitivity, i.e. polymer-coated cantilevers always respond to the presence of volatile molecules, but the magnitude and temporal behavior are specific to the chemistry of the polymer. Molecules from the environment diffuse into the polymer layer at different rates, mainly depending on the size and solubility of the molecules in the polymer layer (Fig. 15.3b).

Cantilevers functionalized by coating with biochemical sensing\nlayers respond very specifically using biomolecular key\u2013lock principles of molecular recognition. However, whether molecular recognition will actually lead to a bending of the cantilever depends on the efficiency of transduction, because the surface stress has to be generated very close to the cantilever surface to produce bending. By just scaling down standard gene-chip strategies to cantilever geometry utilizing long spacer molecules so that DNA molecules become more accessible for hybridization, the hybridization takes place at a distance of several nanometers from the cantilever surface. In such experiments, no cantilever bending was observed [15.18].",

This size has to be selected in such a way that all eight laser beams pass through the lens close to its center to minimize scattering, chromatic and spherical aberration artifacts. The light is then reflected off the gold-coated surface of the cantilever and hits the surface of a position-sensing detector (PSD). PSDs are light-sensitive photopotentiometer-like devices that produce photocurrents at two opposing electrodes. The magnitude of the photocurrents depends linearly on the distance of the impinging light spot from the electrodes. Thus the position of an incident light beam can easily be determined with micrometer precision. The photocurrents are transformed into voltages and amplified in a preamplifier. As only one PSD is used, the eight lasers cannot be switched on simultaneously. Therefore, a time-multiplexing procedure is used to switch the lasers on and off sequentially at typical intervals of 10\u2013100 ms. The resulting deflection signal is digitized and stored together with time information on a personal computer (PC), which also controls the multiplexing of the VCSELs as well as the switching of the valves and mass flow controllers used for setting the composition ratio of the analyte mixture.",

The current flowing between the two branches of the Wheatstone bridge is initially nulled by changing the resistance of the adjustable resistor. If the cantilever bends, the piezoresistor changes its value and a current will flow between the two branches of the Wheatstone bridge. This current is converted via a differential amplifier into a voltage for static-mode measurement. For dynamic-mode measurement, the piezoresistive cantilever is externally actuated via a frequency generator connected to a piezocrystal. The alternating current (AC) actuation voltage is fed as reference voltage into a lock-in amplifier and compared with the response of the Wheatstone-bridge circuit.

Both beams (the reference beam from the hinge region and the object beam from the apex region of the cantilever) are reflected back to the objective lens, pass the Wollaston prism, where they are recombined into one beam, which is then reflected into the other arm of the interferometer, where after the \u03bb/4 plate a phase shift of a quarter wavelength between object and reference beam is established.

The inkjet-spotting\ntechnique, however, allows rapid and reliable coating of cantilever arrays [15.42,43]. An x-y-z positioning system allows a fine nozzle (capillary diameter: 70 \u03bcm) to be positioned with an accuracy of approximately 10 \u03bcm over a cantilever. Individual droplets (diameter: 60\u201380 \u03bcm, volume 0.1\u20130.3 nl) can be dispensed individually by means of a piezo-driven ejection system in the inkjet nozzle. When the droplets are spotted with a pitch smaller than 0.1 mm, they merge and form continuous films. By adjusting the number of droplets deposited on the cantilevers, the resulting film thickness can be controlled precisely. The inkjet-spotting technique allows a cantilever to be coated within seconds and yields very homogeneous, reproducibly deposited layers of well-controlled thickness. Successful coating of self-assembled alkanethiol monolayers, polymer solutions, self-assembled DNA single-stranded oligonucleotides [15.43], and protein layers has been demonstrated. In conclusion, inkjet spotting has turned out to be a very efficient and versatile method for functionalization, which can even be used to coat arbitrarily shaped sensors reproducibly and reliably [15.44,45].",

The catalytic reaction of oxygen present in a reaction chamber with hydrogen being introduced into the chamber produces oscillatory chemical reactions resulting in mechanical oscillations of the cantilever due to heat formation related to catalytic conversion of H2 and O2 to form H2O. By use of an array of four platinum coated and four uncoated microcantilevers, a change of the deflection signal due to bending of the platinum coated cantilever relative to the uncoated cantilevers is observed upon hydrogen adsorption in the presence of oxygen [15.11]. Similar responses are obtained with Pd coated glass cantilevers [15.46] and with Pd coated silicon microcantilevers using dynamic mode [15.47], capacitive readout [15.48] or beam-deflection readout in static mode [15.49].",

Hg2+ has been measured at a concentration of 10\u221211 M using a microcantilever coated with gold. Almost no affinity to other cations exists, such as K+, Na+ Pb2+, Zn2+, Ni2+, Cd2+, Cu2+, and Ca2+ [15.75]. Adsorption characteristics of Ca2+ ions as a function of concentration in aequous CaCl2 solution was investigated in static and dynamic mode [15.76]. Microcantilevers functionalized with metal-binding protein AgNt84-6 are able to detect heavy metal ions like Hg2+ and Zn2+, but are insensitive to Mn2+ [15.77]. Hydrogels containing benzo-18-crown-6 have been used to modify microcantilevers for measurements of the concentration of Pb2+ in aqueous solutions [15.78]. Using different thiolated ligands as self-assembled monolayers (SAMs) functionalized on silicon microcantilevers (MCs) coated with gold allows to detect Cs+, Co2+ and Fe3+ [15.79]. A gold coated microcantilever is utilized as the working electrode to detect Cr(VI) [15.80]. Others use 11-undecenyltriethylammonium bromide [15.81] or sol\u2013gel layers [15.82] for detection of Cr(VI).

            "text": "A microcantilever-based alcohol vapor sensor is described in [15.84] using the piezoresistive technique and polymer coating. They also present a simple evaporation model that allows determining the concentration. The detection limit found is 10 ppm for methanol, ethanol and 2-propanol. In [15.85] an integrated complementary metal oxide semiconductor (CMOS) chemical microsensor with piezoresistive detection (Wheatstone bridge configuration) using poly(etherurethane) (PEUT) as the sensor layer is presented. They are able to reversibly detect volatile organic compounds (VOCs) such as toluene, n-octane, ethyl acetate and ethanol with a sensitivity level down to 200 ppm. An improved version of that device is described in [15.86]. The sensitivity could be increased to 5 ppm for n-octane. Later the technique has been refined by using electromagnetic rather than electrothermal actuation and transistor-based readout reducing power dissipation on the cantilever [15.87]. Piezoelectric readout in dynamic mode and electromagnetic actuation of cantilevers spray-coated with PEUT is reported in [15.88], achieving a sensitivity of 14 ppm for ethanol. In [15.89] a study is published how to prepare polyethylene glycol (PEG) coated microcantilever sensors using a microcapillary pipette assisted method. PEG coating is suitable for ethanol sensing as ethanol quickly forms hydrogen bonds with the OH groups of the PEG. Sensor operation is reported to be reversible and reproducible. In [15.90] artificial neural networks are used for analyte species and concentration identification with polymer coated optically read-out microcantilevers. The analytes detected are carbon dioxide, dichloromethane, diiso-propylmethylphosphonate (DIMP), dioxane, ethanol, water, 2-propanol, methanol, trichloroethylene and trichloromethylene. In [15.91] the chemical sensing performance of a silicon reconant microcantilever sensor is investigated in dependence on the thickness of the sensitive coating. For a coating thickness of 1, 4 and 21 \u03bcm of PEUT a limit of detection of 30 ppm was found for ethanol. A new concept of parylene micromembrane array for chemical sensing is presented [15.92] using the capacitive method. The parylene membrane is suspended over a metal pad patterned on the substrate. The pad and part of the membrane that is metal-coated serve as electrodes for capacitive measurement. The top electrode located on the membrane is chemically modified by applying a gold layer and self-assembled thiol monolayers (\u2013COOH, \u2013CH3 and \u2013OH) for detection of analyte molecules. Successful detection of 2-propanol and toluene is reported. In [15.93] a sensitive self-oscillating cantilever array is described for quantitative and qualitative analysis of organic vapor mixtures. The cantilevers are electromagnetically actuated and the resonance frequency is measured using a frequency counter. Sensor response is reproducible and reversible. Using PEUT coating the smallest measured concentration is 400 ppm, but the limit of detection is well below 1 ppm. In [15.94] a combination of gas chromatography with a microcantilever sensor array for enhanced selectivity is reported. Test VOC mixtures composed of acetone, ethanol and trichloroethylene in pentane, as well as methanol with acetonitrile in pentane were first separated in a gas chromatography column and then detected using micocantilevers coated with responsive phases such as 3-aminopropyltriethoxy silane, copper phtalocyanine and methyl-\u03b2-cyclodextrin. Analytes detected include pentane, methanol, acetonitrile, acetone, ethanol and trichloroethylene. In [15.95] results are presented on independent component analysis (ICA) of ethanol, propanol and DIMP using cantilever coated with molecular recognition phases (MRP), whereby ICA has proven its feature extraction ablility for components in mixtures.",

            "text": "Security\nmeasures require inexpensive, highly selective and very sensitive small sensors that can be mass-produced and microfabricated. Such low cost sensors could be arranged as a sensor grid for large area coverage of sensitive infrastructure, like airports, public buildings, or traffic infrastructure. Threats can be of chemical, biological, radioactive or explosive nature. Microcantilever sensors are reported to offer very high sensitivities of explosives detection. Photomechanical chemical microsensors based on adsorption-induced and photoinduced stress changes due to the presence of diisopropyl methyl phosphonate (DIMP), which is a model compound for phosphorous-containing chemical warfare agents, and trinitrotoluene (TNT), an explosive are reported [15.97]. Further explosives frequently used include pentaerythritol tetranitrate (PETN) and hexahydro-1,3,5-triazine (RDX), often also with plastic fillers [15.98]. These compounds are very stable, if no detonator is present. Their explosive power, however, is very large, and moreover, the vapor pressures of PETN and RDX are very low, in the range of ppb and ppt. By functionalizing microcantilevers with self-assembled monolayers of 4-mercaptobeonzoic acid (4-MBA) PETN was detected at a level of 1400 ppt and RDX at a level of 290 ppt [15.99]. TNT was found to readily stick to Si surfaces, suggesting the use of microcantilevers for TNT detection, taking advantage of the respective adsorption/desorption kinetics [15.100,101]. Detection of TNT via deflagration on a microcantilever is described by Pinnaduwage et al. [15.101]. They used piezoresistive microcantilevers where the cantilever deflection was measured optically via beam deflection. TNT vapor from a generator placed 5 mm away from the microcantilever was observed to adsorb on its surface resulting in a decrease of resonance frequency. Application of an electrical pulse (10 V, 10 ms) to the piezoresistive cantilever resulted in deflagration of the TNT vapor and a bump in the cantilever bending signal. This bump was found to be related to the heat produced during deflagration. The amount of heat released is proportional to the area of the bump in the time versus bending signal diagram of the process. The deflagration was found to be complete, as the same resonance frequency as before the experiment was observed. The amount of TNT mass involved was determined as 50 pg. The technique was later extended to the detection of PETN and RDX, where much slower reaction kinetics was observed [15.99,102]. Traces of 2,4-dinitrotoluene (DNT) in TNT can also be used for detection of TNT, because it is the major impurity in production grade TNT. Furthermore DNT is a decomposition product of TNT. The saturation concentration of DNT in air at 20 \u00b0C is 25 times higher than that of TNT. DNT was reported detectable at the 300 ppt level using polysiloxane polymer layers [15.103]. Microfabrication of electrostatically actuated resonant microcantilever beams in CMOS technology for detection of the nerve agent stimulant dimethylmethylphosphonate (DMMP) using polycarbosilane-coated beams [15.104] is an important step towards an integrated platform based on silicon microcantilevers, which besides compactness might also include telemetry [15.105]. Cu2+/L-cysteine bilayer-coated microcantilever demonstrated high sensitivity and selectivity toward organo-phosphorus compounds in aqueous solution. The microcantilever was found to undergo bending upon exposure to nerve agent simulant DMMP at concentrations as low as 10\u221215 M due to the complexation of the phosphonyl group and the Cu2+/L-cysteine bilayer on the microcantilever surface [15.106,107].",

The interfacial stress of self-assembled monolayers of mercaptohexadecanoic acid and hexadecanethiol depends on pH values and ionic strength [15.39]. SiO2 and silicon nitride microcantilevers were also found to exhibit a deflection dependence with pH when coated with 4-aminobutyltriethoxysilane, 11-mercaptoundecanoic acid and Au/Al-coated over a pH range 2\u201312. Aminosilane-modified SiO2/Au cantilevers performed robustly over pH range 2\u20138 (49 nm deflection/pH unit), while Si3N4/Au cantilevers performed well at pH 2\u20136 and 8\u201312 (30 nm deflection/pH unit) [15.108]. Microcantilevers with poly(methacrylic acid) (PMAA) and poly(ethylene glycol) dimethacrylate coating showed to be sensitive to pH changes [15.109]. Also hydrogel catings were found to be sensitive to pH [15.110]. The dependence of the micromechanical responses to different ionic strength and ion species present in the aqueous environment is discussed in [15.111], highlighting the critical role of counter- and co-ions on surface stress.",

The differential deflection of the cantilevers was found to provide a true molecular recognition signal despite large responses of individual cantilevers. Hybridization of complementary oligonucleotides shows that a single base mismatch between two 12-mer oligonucleotides is clearly detectable [15.17]. The findings were confirmed or modeled by several groups [15.117,118]. Hybridization in a complex nonspecific background was observed in a complement concentration range between 75  nM and 2 \u03bcM [15.40], following Langmuir model kinetics [15.119]. Enzymatic processes were directly performed on a microcantilever functionalized with DNA incorporating a Hind III restriction endonuclease site, followed by digestion with Hind III to produce DNA comprising a single-stranded end on the cantilever surface. Ligase was used to couple a second DNA molecule with a compatible end to the DNA on the cantilever [15.120]. Using gold nanoparticle labeled DNA, microcantilevers have been used to detect DNA strands with a specific sequence in dynamic mode, whereby a concentration of 23 pM could still be detected, as well as a single basepair mismatch [15.121]. Whereby adsorption of thiol functionalized single-stranded DNA is easily observed, hybridization cannot be observed if long hydrocarbon spacer molecules between single strand DNA and thiol anchor are used [15.122]. DNA hybridization is also observed using piezoresistive cantilevers [15.119,123]. A different technique to read out the microcantilever deflections in an array is reported in [15.124]. There the optical beam deflection technique is combined with the scanning of a laser beam illuminating the cantilevers of an array sequentially. DNA hybridization is also reported using polymer SU-8 cantilevers [15.125]. Mukhopadhyay et al. report 20 nM hybridization sensitivity using piezoresistive cantilevers and DNA sequences with an overhang extension distal to the surface [15.126]. A larger array comprising 20 microcantilevers is described in [15.127]. Moreover, the authors present integration of the array with microfluidics. Surface stress changes in response to thermal dehybridization, or melting, is reported [15.128]. The dependence of salt concentration and hybridization efficiency is discussed in [15.129]. Two different DNA-binding proteins, the transcription factors SP1 and NF-kappa B are investigated [15.130]. Phase transition and stability issues of DNA are discussed in [15.131]. Differential gene expression of the gene 1-8U, a potential marker for cancer progression or viral infections, has been observed in a complex background. The measurements provide results within minutes at the picomolar level without target amplification, and are sensitive to base mismatches [15.132].",

In [15.134] the activity, stability, lifetime and re-usability of monoclonal antibodies to myoglobin covalently immobilised onto microfabricated cantilever surfaces was investigated. Using piezoresistive microcantilevers the interaction of anti-bovine serum albumin (a-BSA) with bovine serum albumin (BSA) was studied [15.135]. Continuous label-free detection of two cardiac biomarker proteins (creatin kinase and myoglobin) is demonstrated using an array of microfabricated cantilevers functionalized with covalently anchored anti-creatin kinase and anti-myoglobin antibodies [15.41]. Label-free protein detection is reported using a microcantilever functionalized with DNA aptamers receptors for Taq DNA polymerase [15.136]. Label-free detection of C-reactive protein (CRP) using resonant frequency shift in piezoresistive cantilevers is described in [15.137], utilizing the specific binding characteristics of CRP antigen to its antibody, which is immobilized with Calixcrown SAMs on Au. Receptors on microcantilevers for serotonin, but insensitive to its biological precursor with similar structure tryptophan are described in [15.138]. Using single chain fragment antibodies instead of complete antibodies allowed to lower the limit of detection to concentrations of about 1 nM [15.139]. In [15.140] detection of prostate specific antigen (PSA) and C-reactive protein is reported. Detection of the human oestrogen receptor in free and oestradiol-bound conformation can be distinguished [15.141]. The Ca2+ binding protein calmodulin changes its conformation in presence of absence of Ca2+ resulting in a microcantilver deflection change [15.142]. No effect is observed upon exposure to K+ and Mg2+. Detection of activated cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cyclic AMP)-dependent protein kinase (PKA) is performed in dynamic mode employing a peptide derived from the heat-stable protein kinase inhibitor (PKI) [15.143]. Detection of streptavidin at 1\u201310 nM concentration is reported using biotin-coated cantilevers [15.144]. Using GST (glutathione-S-transferase) for detection of GST antibodies, a sensitivity of 40 nM was obtained [15.145]. A two-dimensional multiplexed real-time, label-free antibody\u2013antigen binding assay by optically detecting nanoscale motions of two-dimensional arrays of microcantilever beams is presented in [15.146]. Prostate specific antigen (PSA) was detected at 1 ng/ml using antibodies covalently bound to one surface of the cantilevers. Conformational changes in membrane protein patches of bacteriorhodopsin proteoliposomes were observed with microcantilevers through prosthetic retinal removal (bleaching) [15.147]. Using an analog of the myc-tag decapeptide, binding of anti-myc-tag antibodies is reported [15.148].",

A detailed theoretical study of viscoelastic effects on the frequency shift of microcantilever chemical sensors is given in [15.164]. Microcantilever deflection as a function of flow speed of viscous fluids is investigated in [15.165]. Viscosity of sugar solutions is tested using microcantilevers [15.166].",

            "text": "Gas sensing does not only involve chemical detection, but also pressure and flow sensing. Brown et al. [15.167] have studied the behavior of magnetically actuated oscillating microcantilevers at large deflections and have found hysteresis behavior at resonance. The amplitude at the actuation frequency changes depending on pressure due to damping. The authors have used cantilever in cantilever (CIC) structures, and have observed changes in deflection as gas pressure is varied. At atmospheric pressure, damping is large and the oscillation amplitude is relative small and hysteresis effects are absent. At lower pressure, abrupt changes in the oscillation amplitude occur with changes in the driving frequency. Since the change of amplitude and driving frequency, at which they occur are pressure dependent, these quantities can be used for accurate determination of gas pressure, demonstrated in the range between 10\u22123 and 102 Torr. Brown et al. [15.168] emphasize that microelectromechanical system pressure sensors will have a wide range of applications, especially in the automotive industry. Piezoresistive cantilever based deflection measurement has major advantages over diaphragms. The pressure range has been extended to 15\u20131450 Torr by means of design geometry adaptation. Su et al. [15.169] present highly sensitive ultrathin piezoresistive silicon microcantilevers for gas velocity sensing, whereby the deflection increases with airflow distribution in a steel pipe. The detection principle is based on normal pressure drag producing bending of the cantilever. The minimum flow speed measured was 7.0 cm/s, which is comparable to classical hot-wire anemometers. Mertens et al. [15.170] have investigated the effects of temperature and pressure on microcantilever resonance response in helium and nitrogen. Resonance response as a function of pressure showed three different regimes, which correspond to molecular flow, transition regimes and viscous flow, whereby the frequency variation of the cantilever is mainly due to changes in the mean free path of gas molecules. Effects observed allow measurement of pressures between 7.5\u00d710\u22125 and 7500 Torr. Mortet et al. [15.171] present a pressure sensor based on a piezoelectric bimorph microcantilever with a measurement range between 75 and 6400 Torr. The resonance frequency shift is constant for pressures below 375 Torr. For higher pressures the sensitivity is typically a few ppm/mbar, but depends on the mode number. Sievil\u00e4 et al. [15.172] present a cantilever paddle within a frame operating like a moving mirror to detect the displacements in the oscillating cantilever using a He-Ne laser in a Michelson interferometer configuration, whereby the cantilever acts as moving mirror element in one path of the interferometer. A fixed mirror serves a reference in the other arm of the interferometer.",

The infrared (thermal) image of the source is obtained by rastering a single microfabricated cantilever across the image formed at the focal plane of a concave mirror [15.175,176,177]. The method has later been refined such that photons are detected using the stress caused by photoelectrons emitted from a Pt film surface in contact with a semiconductor microstructure, which forms a Schottky barrier. The photoinduced bending of the Schottky barrier microstructure is due to electronic stress produced by photoelectrons diffusing into the microstructure [15.178]. The performance of IR imaging via microcantilevers has been enhanced by one-fold leg and two-fold legs beam structures with absorber plates [15.179,180,181].",
