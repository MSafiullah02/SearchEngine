It also includes many forms of processing foods ranging from grinding grain to make raw flour for home cooking to complex industrial methods used to make convenience foods. Food processing can be improved much in the aspects of smart delivery of nutrients, nanoencapsulation of nutraceuticals, bioseparation of proteins, rapid sampling of biological and chemical contaminants, solubilization, delivery, and color in food systems. These are some of the emerging uses of nanotechnology in food science (Ravichandran 2010) . Nanotechnology can assist in the development of functional or interactive foods, which respond to requirements of the human body and can deliver these nutrients more efficiently. Various research groups are also developing new on-demand foods, which will remain dormant in the body and deliver nutrients to cells as and when needed. The concept is that thousands of nanocapsules containing flavor or color enhancers, or added nutritional elements (such as vitamins), would remain dormant in the food and these will be released only, when triggered by the consumer (Amin et al. 2015) . A key element in this sector is the development of nanocapsules that can be incorporated into food to deliver nutrients timely. Other developments in food processing include the addition of nanoparticles to existing foods to enable increased absorption of nutrients. One of the bakeries in Western Australia is quite successful in incorporating tuna fish oil (a source of omega-3 fatty acids) in nanocapsules in their top-selling product \"Tip-Top\" Up bread (Bund 2008) . The microcapsules are designed to break open only when they have reached the stomach, thus avoiding the unpleasant taste of the fish oil.",

While Est\u00e9e Lauder is manufacturing antiaging formulations making use of nanoparticles (Joseph and Morrison 2006) , Unilever is developing ice creams with low fat by decreasing the size of emulsion particles, which is responsible for its texture.

These nanosensors are diagnostic devices to monitor the quality of food processes and also safety of food. Such nanosensors are used for the detection of very minute amounts of any chemical pollutant, virus, or bacteria in food systems. There is a possibility of combining biology with nanoscale technology in fabrication of sensors with a great potential of higher sensitivity and reduced response time. Nanoparticles may selectively attach themselves to food pathogens, and even traces of harmful pathogens could be detected with sensors using either infrared light or magnetic materials. It is advantageous that numerous nanoparticles can be placed on a single nanosensor so as to detect the presence of different bacteria and pathogens rapidly and accurately also. Another advantage is that nanosensors can gain access into the tiny crevices because of its small size, where the pathogens often used to hide, and nanotechnology will reduce the time taken for this detection from days to a few hours, minutes, or even seconds (Choudhury and Goswami 2012) . Nanotechnology utilizes biological molecules like sugars or proteins as target-recognition groups for nanostructures as biosensors (Charych et al. 1996) .

These devices show extraordinary sensitivity, quick response, and rescue Yalcin and Otles 2010) . Mostly, nanosensors are used in recognition of pesticide as organophosphate in plants, fruits, and aquatics. It is known that pesticides are highly permeable and soluble and these are harmful. These are extensively used in agronomy. There is significant importance in analysis of residue of highly sensitive pollutants (Mclaren et al. 2009 ). Nanosensors devices have benefits over other techniques like gas/liquid chromatography and mass spectroscopy, because they contain high surface to volume ratios, primarily loading of more antibody/enzymes (great sensitivity interface), less recognition limits, exceptional selectivity with small size, and quick response. It has been known that the use of these nanosized materials is likely to enhance the sensitive transducer indication or signals. Carbon nanotubes semiconductor and metal nanostructures have exceptional electrical or optical characteristics (Hwang et al. 2011 ). Intelligent packing is another aspect, where covering a nano-biosensor makes these to fluoresce in various colors on interaction with different pathogens of food materials. Various types of devices have been developed to identify contaminants, chemicals, and pathogens in food materials. Such device is highly sensitive in identifying E. coli and Salmonella (Chen et al. 2008) .",

Nanocapsules can be incorporated into food to deliver any nutrient. Addition of nanoparticles to existing food can also enable increased absorption of these nutrients (Jampilek et al. 2019) . Nanoparticle additives could easily be absorbed by the body, and these could increase shelf life of the product. Nanosized dispersions, emulsions, and filled micelles have an advantage that they are not subjected to sedimentation resulting in better life span and storage of the product. As size of these nanoadditives is much smaller as compared to wavelength of light, they can be easily incorporated even in clear and transparent foods without causing problems of colors. Substances, which are difficult to dissolve by the body, can more easily be absorbed in nanoscale size, because of their larger surface area. If any active substance is to be protected during storage or its passage through the intestines, the nanotechnology can provide perfect protective layers. It is also possible to tailor these protective layers so as to release active substances in an intelligent way (caused by a change of pH value).",

In other words, there are a number of factors which decide the absorption of food in the body for infants, children, adults, old people, and those who are suffering from any type of gastrointestinal diseases. A nutrition delivery system is a system or nanocarrier that delivers nutrition to specific places. Chitosan is such a nanocarrier (Maestrelli et al. 2006) . Although a delivery system has numerous functions, one of them is to transport a functional ingredient to its desired site. Just like taste, texture, and shelf life, major functions of a delivery system for a food product are that it should protect an ingredient from chemical or biological degradation, such as oxidation, and controlling the rate of release of functional ingredient under specific environmental conditions. Nanodispersions and nanocapsules are ideal mechanisms for delivery of functional ingredients because they can effectively perform all these tasks.",

Neither polysaccharides and proteins nor lipids provide all the properties in an edible coating and identify additives. Newer additives are searched that can improve these properties, e.g., polyols. Foods can be coated with nanolaminates either by dipping them into a series of solutions containing substances or by spraying substances onto the food surface (Shit and Shah 2014) .

Metal or metal oxide-based nanocomposites are used in food packaging and coating or sometimes even as ingredients of food. Silver nanoparticles and its nanocomposites are most commonly used nanomaterials as antimicrobials in the food industry (He and Hwang 2016) . The use of a number of silver-containing zeolites or similar substances as food contact materials has been approved by the USFDA for the purpose of disinfection (Duncan 2011) . These nanoparticles are used as a source of Ag + ions, which binds to membrane proteins, forming pits and/or causing other morphological changes (Morones et al. 2005) . These also catalyze the generation of ROS in bacterial cells, which, in turn, leads to cell death through oxidative stress (Kim et al. 2007 ). It has been suggested that silver nanocomposites are quite safe for packaging of food, as no detectable or negligible levels of silver nanoparticles are released, which migrate from containers to actual food samples and food stimulants (Ntim et al. 2015) . Nanocomposites have an advantage of enhanced stability, which is very much required for sustaining antimicrobial activity and reducing the possibility of migration of metal ions into stored foods. Some polymers are designed to form nanocomposites with metal/metal oxide nanomaterials for various applications in food science. Polymers most widely used in nanocomposites include gelatin, polylactic acid, isotactic polypropylene, and low-density polyethylene (LDPE). Nanocomposites of LDPE with metals (Ag/LDPE) and metal oxide (CuO/LDPE, TiO 2 /LDPE, and ZnO/LDPE) are used in some food applications. Apart from these ZnO/gelatin, ZnO/polylactic acid, and ZnO/graphene oxide/polylactic acid, ZnO/polycarbonate, ZnO/isotactic polypropylene, Ag/OMteLDPE, and Ag/poly(3-hydroxybutyrate-co-18 mol%-3-hydroxyvalerate) are also used specifically for food packaging applications (He and Hwang 2016) .

Polymeric nanoparticles are considered suitable for the encapsulation of bioactive compounds such as flavonoids and vitamins, which are released in the stomach having acidic environments (Pool et al. 2012) . SiO 2 -gallic acid nanoparticles were also developed, and these were tested as antioxidant with its scavenging capacity of DPPH (2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl) radicals (Deligiannakis et al. 2012 ). Browning of fresh-cut fruits is another problem, which can be controlled by the application of antioxidant treatments in association with edible coating, because browning of fresh-cut fruits is an undesirable effect due to conversion of phenolic compounds into some dark-colored pigments in the presence of oxygen (air), during storage and marketing (Garcia and Barrett 2019) . But only some applications of nanomaterials directly as anti-browning agents have been known. The shelf life of Fuji apples (as a fresh-cut product) was enhanced using nano-ZnO-coated active packaging (Li et al. 2011 ).",

The introduction/ presence of any pathogen in food can result in its poisoning, which can be deadly. Therefore, it is of utmost importance that the food must be protected at all levels. A good-quality packaging material is thus required, which is safe, nontoxic, and costeffective. Packaging using nanomaterial controls pH, temperature, moisture, and freshness of the material kept inside the packet. It also contains information for consumers, along with controlling the environment to enhance the shelf life of the food material. It provides smart packaging and extends the shelf life of a product so that food material can be transported to a long distance also. Nanosensors are developed for smart packaging so as to detect spoilage of food and release nanoantimicrobials as and when required, to extend shelf life. It helps markets and in keeping the food fresh and that too for a longer period. There is a great demand for nano-enabled packaging for food, beverage, and pharmaceutical industries due to the regularly changing consumption patterns. Such nanopackaging systems can repair small losses like holes/tears because of environmental conditions (temperature and moisture) and make the customer alert if the food is being contaminated due to some or the other reasons. Nanoscience can provide solutions for such problems, change in permeation behavior of foils, enhancing barrier properties (like thermal, chemical, mechanical, and microbial), improving upon mechanical and heat resistance properties, introducing active antimicrobial and antifungal surfaces, and sensing/signaling any microbiological and biochemical changes that have occurred (Alfadul and Elneshwy 2010) . Not only this, the cost of food additive ingredients can be lowered and the shelf life of food products can be increased using this technology. It is potential frontier of material science in packaging using nanomaterials. It has been estimated that advancement in nanotechnology supported by increased global investments has thrusted the nano-enabled packaging market all over the world in the past few years (Nano-enabled Packaging Market 2019).",

But, alcohol in beer reacts with the plastic of the bottles, which shortens the shelf life of alcohol to a great extent. Voridan has developed a nanocomposite in association with Nanocor, containing clay nanoparticles and named as Imperm (Srinivas 2016) . These bottles are having both the qualities; these are lighter and stronger than glass and also less likely to shatter. It has been suggested that such nanocomposites structure minimizes the loss of carbon dioxide from the beer and the ingress of oxygen to the bottle, so as to keep the beer fresh up to a 6-month shelf life (Lua and Bowles 2013) . Whatever may be the impacts of nanotechnology on the food industry and products entering the market, as the safety of food is the main concern, there is an urgent need to find new sensors, which will not only ensure food safety and security, but they will make customers and shopkeepers alert that a food is going to reach the end of its shelf life. Antimicrobial coatings and dirt repellent plastic bags are used ensuring the safety and security of packaged food. This will solve food shortage crises by ensuring that food reaches to masses in time and with good qualities (Hamad et al. 2018) .",

Active packaging technology also involves change in permselectivity (selective permeation) of package materials to different gases. Some nanocomposite materials have been used in active packaging so as to prevent oxygen, carbon dioxide, and moisture from reaching the food (Brody et al. 2008 ). An active system involving moisture scavenging has been quite commonly used particularly for packaging of dried and moisture-sensitive foods, while oxygen scavengers are normally inserted into the package in the form of small sachets just to reduce the oxygen level within the package, because an environment free from oxygen prevents oxidation of food as well as the growth of aerobic bacteria and mold.

Some such smart packaging has been developed to be used as a tracking device for food safety. Presently, British Airways, MonoPrix supermarket, and Nestl\u00e9 are using chemical sensors, which can quickly detect any color change (Pehanich 2006) . Nanotechnology has been used to manufacture a \"smart\" packaging, which can extend the shelf life of food dramatically, which permits it to be transported to a longer distance. Intelligent or smart packaging has been designed to monitor and communicate information about quality of food. It includes time-temperature indicators (TTIs), ripeness indicators, biosensors, and radio frequency identification. Such smart devices may be either incorporated in package materials itself or these are attached inside or outside of a package (Kerry et al. 2006; Yam et al. 2005; Kerry and Butler 2008) . Smart packaging either responds to change in environmental conditions, repairs, or alerts the consumer about such contamination and/or the presence of some harmful pathogens. It is capable of detecting spoilage of food and release nanoantimicrobes to extend shelf life of food, so that supermarkets can keep their food materials even for a longer time periods before it is sold. Nanosensors are used as tiny chips invisible to the human eye, embedded into food products that act as electronic barcodes (Sekhon 2010) .",

These packaging are already in use in brewing and dairy industries. These consist of nanofilters, which can filter microorganisms and sometime even viruses. In some experiments, color was successfully removed from beetroot juice, but the flavor is not affected. Similarly red wine was turned into colorless or white in color. Lactose can also be filtered from milk, and it is replaced with some other sugar so that milk can be used by the lactose intolerant also. Nanoceramic particles are used for clustering of dirt molecules, so as to keep cooking oil fresh (Llobet et al. 2007; Wooster 2010) . Nanotechnology has proved it worth in food safety by developing highly sensitive and low-cost nanosensors, which can respond to changes in environmental conditions during storage, degradation products, or contamination by microbes. Such nanosensors can be effectively used in packaging materials (Bouwmeester et al. 2014; Liao et al. 2005) .",

Carbon nanotubes (CNTs) are available in both forms, singlewalled nanotube (SWCNT) and multiwalled nanotube (MWCNT). SWCNT is generally one atom thick, while MWCNT comprises of several concentric tubes with very high aspect ratios and elastic modulus. Asgari et al. (2014) reported that CNTs infused with polyethylene films can be used for the packaging of Mazafati dates, which can prevent fungal invasion up to 90 days. Carbon nanotubes have also been developed in packaging to pump out carbon dioxide or absorb undesirable flavors (Sinha et al. 2006) . It has been known that CNTs also have antibacterial properties, which may be due to their direct penetration through microbial cells (Sharma et al. 2017) . It has been reported that antimicrobial activity of silver nanoparticles against E. coli and B. cereus spores is significantly enhanced in combination with titanium dioxide and carbon nanotubes, respectively (Krishna et al. 2005) . Ionic nanocomposites of carbon ceramic electrode with multiwalled carbon nanotubes may be used for the electrochemical determination of the adulterants in food and beverages such as food dyes, like sunset yellow, tartrazine, etc. In addition, carbon nanotubes have many other properties that may be exploited later on to develop the next generation of nanosensors. An important role is played by CNTs in food packaging and processing, but there may be some pitfalls, like these may migrate into food and contaminate it and can lead to toxic effects in human beings. The toxicity levels of CNTs are considerably high, and therefore, their use is limited.",

This feedstock can be obtained from a variety of agricultural products like wheat, maize, molasses, and whey. Biodegradable polylactic acid (PLA) polymer was evaluated for its use as a material for antimicrobial food packaging (Jin and Zhang 2008) . They incorporated nisin in PLA films for controlling foodborne pathogens. Antimicrobial activity of PLA/nisin films was evaluated in liquid foods (orange juice and liquid egg white) against Listeria monocytogenes, Escherichia coli O157:H7, and Salmonella Enteritidis. Ramos et al. (2014) prepared nano-biocomposite films based on polylactic acid by incorporating thymol (as the active additive) and modified montmorillonite (D43B) at two different concentrations. It was observed that thermal stability was not significantly affected by the addition of thymol, but the incorporation of D43B improved its mechanical properties and reduced the oxygen transmission rate by the formation of intercalated structures. It was suggested that the formulated nano-biocomposites could be considered a potential antioxidant active packaging material.",

Poly(lactic acid) and poly(hydroxybutyrate) were blended and plasticized by Arrieta et al.

As-prepared materials were melt-blended and processed in transparent films. Disintegrability under composting conditions was also worked out, and it was reported that PHB delays the PLA disintegrability, but on the contrary, D-limonene speeds it up. Ma et al. (2018) developed poly(lactic acid)-poly(hydroxybutyrate) (PLA-PHB) based films containing bioactive elements and prepared seven formulations containing different contents of plasticizers (mono-caprylin glycerate (GMC) or glycerol monolaurate (GML)). Two formulations (PLA-PHB-based films with 0.5% GMC or GML) were selected, and 5% cinnamaldehyde was added into each of these. It was revealed that PLA-PHB-based films possessed better mechanical properties and better active properties on application to high lipid food simulant.

It has some interesting applications in the fields of medical and agricultural areas (Nakayama et al. 1997) . It has high elongation at break and low modulus. Apart from it, its physical properties and availability on commercial scale made it very attractive material for commodity applications. An antimicrobial nanopackaging was developed by Ahmed et al. (2019) for food application by incorporating zinc oxide nanoparticles and clove essential oil (CEO) into polylactide/polyethylene glycol polycaprolactone (PLA/PEG/PCL) blend. Here, CEO acts as an efficient plasticizer, which facilitates the chain mobility in the blend, as evident from tensile and thermal properties. The efficacy of these composite films was confirmed by using Staphylococcus aureus and Escherichia coli inoculated in scrambled egg. It was indicated that the PLA/PEG/PCL/ZnO/CEO film exhibited the highest antibacterial activity during 21 days storage at 4 \u00b0C. Cesur et al. (2018) prepared antimicrobial and biodegradable food packaging films with polycaprolactone (PCL). The 0.4 wt% of organo nanoclay (C) and 25, 50, 75 wt% chitosan (K) and glycerol monooleate (GMO) or oleic acid (OA) as a plastifier (5, 10, 20, and 30 wt%) were added, and 12 polymeric composite films were prepared. The samples were coded as PCL (P), organo nanoclay (C), oleic acid (O), and glycerol monooleate (G). The antimicrobial properties of these films were evaluated against Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Bacillus cereus, and Candida albicans. Polycaprolactone (PCL)/starch/ pomegranate rind (PR) hybrids were developed by Khalid et al. (2018) for antimicrobial packaging applications. PR was used as an antimicrobial compound, and it was incorporated directly in PCL matrix, without the extraction of any active compound from the fruit rind. It was revealed that PCL/PR films show reasonably good antimicrobial activity at higher concentrations. Addition of starch was found to enhance the antimicrobial activity of PR. As all the materials used here are biodegradable and food contactable, it has been suggested that the as-developed material could be used as food-grade antimicrobial packaging material.",

Silver nanoparticles are used for their antimicrobial effects in certain types of food containers by some manufacturer in the United States such as Kinetic Go Green basic nanosilver food storage container, Oso fresh food storage container, and FresherLonger\u2122 Plastic Storage bags. It is also possible that some of these silver nanoparticles may migrate into foods from these containers and they could be ingested by humans (Echegoyen and Nerin 2013) . Emamifar et al. (2011) prepared nanocomposite LDPE films containing Ag and ZnO nanoparticles via melt mixing in a twin screw extruder. Orange juice was sterilized and then inoculated with 8.5 log cfu/mL of Lactobacillus plantarum. They filled packages prepared from nanocomposite films with orange juice and then stored at 4 \u00b0C. Microbial stability of the juice was evaluated after 7, 28, 56, 84, and 112 days of storage. It was reported that microbial growth rate significantly reduced on using this nanocomposite packaging material. A potential role of quantum sensors (QS) in food spoilage and food safety has been indicated (Naik and Kowshik 2014) . Anti-QS materials like ATNPs were proposed as efficient models for controlling spoilage of food. Incorporation of ATNPs in food packaging materials could play an important role in preservation of food and ensure its safety by prolonging their shelf life. They proposed ATNPs as QS inhibitors with their potential use as an antipathogenic but nontoxic bioactive material. Ag/TiO 2 -SiO 2 -coated food packaging film was developed also (Peter et al. 2015) . Its ability to inactivate Botrytis cinerea was evaluated during the storage of fresh lettuce. Packaging film was prepared by coating the Ag/TiO 2 -SiO 2 ethanol suspension on polyethylene film. As-prepared packaging film was used for storage of green lettuce in a vegetation room. It was revealed that the shelf life of the lettuce stored in single-and double-layer film modified with TiO 2 was extended by 4 and 2 days, respectively. It was revealed that the spoilage of the lettuce in double-layer film modified with Ag/TiO 2 -SiO 2 was lower after 5 days of storage than that of the lettuce stored in film modified with ethanol and unmodified film. Microbiological and chemical characteristics of white bread during storage in paper packages modified with Ag/TiO 2 -SiO 2 , Ag/N-TiO 2 , or Au/TiO 2 have been investigated (Peter et al. 2016) . The whiteness and the water retention of the modified packages were found to be slightly superior. The water retention was also observed to be very good, especially for the Ag/TiO 2 -SiO 2 paper. These improvements can be associated with the high specific surface area and with the low agglomeration tendency of Ag nanoparticles in comparison with the Au ones. Their use extends the shelf life of bread by 2 days except Au/TiO 2 as compared with the unmodified paper package.",

Nanomaterials have some unique properties like high surface area, which makes them more active chemically than their bulk counterparts, and therefore, they could participate in most of the biological reaction having harmful effects on human health and/or environment. It is very much desired that nanostructures in food or related industries should not damage them directly or indirectly. Food and related industries have seen major changes due to unique properties of nanomaterials. But these unique properties may occasionally lead to dangerous side effects to ecosystems and even in people. There are two main safety concerns on using nanoparticles, and these are allergies and heavy metal release. At present, they are being used into food products at a relatively faster rate without desired knowledge and regulations, which can affect health and environment (Ranjan et al. 2014) . It is necessary to take extra care while using nanomaterials as they may have potential toxic effects and their use in food science is increasing day by day. A report by the British Royal Society notes that we may face a nanotoxicity crisis in the future (Amini et al. 2014) . Only with a proper detailed understanding of the properties of nanomaterials like size, solubility, surface chemistry, composition, etc., we will be in a position to find useful and safe food products. Of course, some of these unique properties of nanomaterials are making them wonderful materials, but sidewise, their use is also questionable at some or the other side.",

The size of particles is an important factor, which can be deciding for observing dermal-cell cytotoxicity in vitro. Such absorbed nanoparticles in different absorption routes could trigger an immune system response. The smaller size of these nanoparticles permits them to pass through different biological barriers.

Human exposure to these nanomaterials is regularly increasing, and its impact on health of the human and environment has become a point of public concern and interest. Although huge benefits are being offered by nanotechnology, the accumulation of nanostructured materials in human bodies and also in the environment has aroused several health and safety issues.

Different preparation technology could produce nanoparticles with different physical properties for their application in food. But, public perception regarding this new technology is still uncertain. Multiple guidelines of potential risks posed by nanomaterials have been released by different regulatory bodies like the US Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA), International Organization for Standardization and the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (IOSOECD), National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH), Health and Consumer Protection Directorate of the European Commission (HCPDEC), and Food and Drug Administration (FDA). It has been reported that these nanomaterials can improve food safety by increasing the efficacy of food packaging, shelf life, and nutritional value of food using additives without affecting the taste and physical characteristics of food products.",

It has almost revolutionized conventional food science and food industry (He and Hwang 2016) . It is also important to ascertain the toxicity of nanoparticles and the possible environmental and health hazards it may cause. Improvement in inorganic nanosubstance and microfluid manufacturing has permitted the preparation of effective and competent sensors to quickly detect/identify pathogens, microbes, or pesticides. The nanosensor or nanobiosensor should also be used in environmental contamination control in the food sectors. Functionalized food and nanosubstance should improve food value and protection as flavor and nutrient transporter.",

A large strength of the public is having a fear in using food engineered and genetically modified materials. Of course, one should be cautious in using nano-based materials in food science and the food industry but not afraid of its application. Although the fate and potential toxicity of nanomaterials are not fully known at this stage and such concerns require the education of public, ultimate success of such products will depend on acceptance by consumer. Time is not far off when nanofood technology will become a new frontier of this century, provided its harmful effects are fully controlled so that health and the environment are not adversely affected.",
