With the help of a large screen, Dr A. presented a list (prepared by her team), which was then discussed by the experts assembled round the table. This list contains the situations requiring careful monitoring; some have already been through the verification process and others still need to be verified with the member countries concerned. At the same time, other screens display the geographical location of the countries concerned by the threat and the number of cases declared that day (as well as figures from the preceding days).

The WHO defines an epidemic as \u2018a disease contracted by a relatively high number of people in a given region in a relatively short period of time\u2019. The risk of an epidemic is the probability of a disease arising in a given time and place and spreading at different scales. During the course of history, populations, ignorant of how to protect themselves, opted to separate those affected from those in good health. The notion of quarantine goes back to at least the fourteenth century (WHO 2007). The idea was to guard themselves against evils of \u2018foreign\u2019 origin, such as the plague. Over time, scientific progress and, most notably, the introduction of sanitation to towns (in the nineteenth century) allowed some infectious diseases to be contained, such as cholera. Then, during the twentieth century, the advent of better hygiene, vaccinations and medicines enabled certain diseases to be brought under control. Smallpox, for example, has been totally eradicated, following a widespread vaccination campaign organised by the WHO.",

It was founded on 7 April 1948, shortly after the end of the Second World War, and currently has 194 member states. However, the origins of the WHO go back to the nineteenth century (Poulain 2003). The major European cholera epidemics which raged between 1830 and 1847 led to the first International Sanitary Conference, held in Paris in 1851. Following this conference, two conventions were signed: the first in 1892 on cholera and the second in 1897 on the plague. In 1907, a number of the states that had signed these conventions met in Rome, where they established the International Office of Public Hygiene. After the First World War and the epidemic of Spanish influenza that was responsible for the death of over 20 million people in 1918\u20131919, the League of Nations set up a Health Committee, which was the \u2018embryo\u2019 of the WHO.",

Despite the considerable efforts made by the WHO, as well as by the Member States and other bodies, such as NGOs, there are still infectious diseases that develop as a result of the ability of microorganisms to adapt to their environment or their host. For this reason, the possibility of an outbreak of a new epidemic remains a reality and an unpredictable reality at that. Over the course of the last 30 years, epidemiologists have noted both the emergence of new diseases (such as legionellosis and AIDS) and an increase in the number of old diseases. There are various reasons for this: \u2018demographic and behavioural changes, economic development, land use, the internationalisation of travel and trade, changes in the climate and in ecosystems, poverty, conflicts, hunger and even the deliberate release of infectious or chemical agents\u2019 (WHO 2007).",

This unit consists of four teams: Risk Assessment and Decision Support, which processes the information on epidemics received and carries out a rapid evaluation of the risks;Global Outbreak Alert and Response Network (GOARN), which brings together institutions and networks to pool human and technical resources in order to identify, confirm rapidly and respond to global outbreaks;Logistics, which provides a comprehensive logistic capability to support the operations responding to outbreaks and maintains and distributes stocks worldwide;Strategic Health Operations (SHO), which acts as the organisational hub for the WHO Headquarters and manages the JW Lee Strategic Health Operations Centre.

He described an emergency response. He also set out the roles of the various institutions in ensuring a better response to epidemics in the field;A doctor from the Global Influenza Programme team.

The information and the notifications are communicated to the WHO through the \u2018focal point\u2019 established in each Member State. The focal point receives information on a round-the-clock basis, allowing it to establish an efficient network between the WHO and its Member States. In addition, countries are responsible for developing their own national monitoring and health emergency systems. They are able to request advice from the WHO if they are unfamiliar with the pathogen agents involved. In the case of a very serious event, the Director-General of the WHO, after consulting with the Emergency Committee, which consists of external experts, is authorised to take a decision in order to prevent the spread of disease on an international scale. The revised IHR has therefore improved communication between Member States. The effectiveness of the international response to a health emergency has been improved and information can be communicated more rapidly.",

The idea was to develop a system capable of detecting information by recognising key words in English and in French. The information came from all forms of telecommunications: television, radio, press, Internet, etc. In 2002, a new version appeared: GPHIN II (Mykhalovskiy and Weir 2006: 43). This search engine covers nine languages: all the official languages of the United Nations (Arabic, Chinese \u2013 traditional and simplified \u2013 Russian, Spanish, French and English), plus Farsi and Portuguese. What is interesting about this approach is that a \u2018rumour\u2019,7 in other words non-official information, is taken into account at a very early stage in the chain. It is emailed to the WHO. This information has no official status, but as it is a \u2018rumour\u2019, it is important to check it out. This system for detecting events highlights the fact that information is traced right back to its source. Thanks to the range of key words selected by the WHO, the slightest bit of information pointing to risk of a potential pandemic is immediately intercepted by the server, then analysed in order to short circuit any problems. There is constant monitoring, making it possible to identify all the indications of the risk of a pandemic.",

Every day analysts examine the strength of the information received and verify the automatic processes incorporated in the system. As an indication of what these automatic processes entail, one might say that the articles are first filtered according to their classification (e.g. animal diseases, human diseases, plant diseases and natural disasters). Then each article is scanned and awarded a percentage figure according to the number of predefined key words it contains. If the level is high, the information is immediately entered into the GPHIN database and emailed to the WHO, as an alert. Conversely, articles scoring below the agreed threshold are discarded. In the case of articles with a median score, it is up to the analyst to decide whether the article should be published or rejected. In addition the analyst checks whether the articles discarded by the automatic system have been translated correctly, ensuring that no suspect case is missed. The human element is therefore essential as it offers a more discerning look at the elements collected by the machine. With the GPHIN there is a shift: rather than considering it as a system, it should be seen as a heterogeneous \u2018calculation centre\u2019 (Latour 1987), where risk situations are identified and considered to be a possibility.

In order to pick up on very first indications of such an event, the very notion of risk needs to be redefined and expanded.

There is an announcement of an irregularity identified using GPHIN, or one of the databases or a formal or informal source. The aim is constantly to make further progress. Scientists have become aware that human and animal diseases are closely linked. For this reason, the investigation of indications is no longer limited to humans but also includes animals. The management of a pandemic risk is expanding its circle of interest to ensure that any risk will be detected and treated.

They can get information much more quickly. But we still work in close collaboration.\n",

Thanks to modern technology, the actors spread across the world can communicate in real time, in collaboration with the other key experts. For example if the Headquarters has some information that needs verifying, the experts in that field meet in the SHOC Room, where they can communicate with the regional office closest to that case. They communicate by telephone or video conferencing, thereby enabling the intelligence to be transmitted directly to the appropriate person. It also works the other way round if the regional office has crucial information to pass on: The work is facilitated by being closer together, by having quicker access to telephones, by having too many video conferences to constantly run to and fro, by sitting face-to-face rather than being lined up like ducks in a row. It\u2019s purely for practical considerations; there is nothing else beyond that. We have telephone conferencing capabilities on every telephone, but if we want to link in 17 parties instead of two, if we have two or three video conferences, or if the Director-General is there, then we activate the SHOC.

The teleconferences between the experts (from these three nodes) are a good example of this connexity. The transmission of information does not depend on the physical distances between locations, but makes use of platforms and networks that negate the geographical distances. The transmission of the information and the communication between experts is possible thanks to technology (in this case the video conferences) and can be achieved in \u2018real time\u2019, with no physical or temporal obstacle preventing the information from reaching the desired target.

The same is true of viruses. They are carried round the world by tourists and can easily adapt to their new environment. Microbes are transmitted in a similar way. National borders have been eliminated, both with regard to the spread of microorganisms and in the management of epidemic risk across the globe, thanks to the interconnecting networks that have been established. The borders, and the links to a particular territory, exist only in terms of identifying the source of the risk. As soon as an event has been detected, the networks take on the key role in ensuring the circulation of information and also the management of epidemic risks within the WHO.",
