These two responses are so critical that also known DNA vaccines can induce long-term immunity in many diseases. This has become a requirement for vaccine efficacy. DNA vaccines are easy to produce and purify, and this has enabled the production and evaluation of new DNA vaccines in animal models within months. Another advantage is the long shelf life of DNA vaccines and the capability to transport (no need to cold chain). Various studies, including on humans, show the reliability of DNA vaccines (Bagarazzi et al. 1998; Kim et al. 2001) . DNA vaccinations have proved in rodents as efficient. Studies on DNA vaccination are continued even in outbred species (Carvalho et al. 2009; Redding and Weiner 2009) . Currently, four DNA vaccines have been licensed for veterinary use. One is for swine in Australia, for growth of hormone releasing hormone, the other is against infectious hematopoietic necrosis virus for salmon in Canada, and the others are against west nile virus (WNV) for horses and melanoma for dogs in the USA (Kutzler and Weiner 2008) .",

Their results exhibit that the DNA vaccine is useful against the Newcastle disease (Sakaguchi et al. 1996) . Park et al. (2006) generated a chimeric Avian Influenza Virus (AIV). This virus expressed the ectodomain of the hemagglutinin-neuraminidase gene in place of the neuraminidase protein of the H5N1 AIV. A single vaccination of chickens with this improved vaccine prototype virus induced strong immunity against H7N7, highly pathogenic AIV, and against Newcastle disease Virus (Park et al. 2006) . Park et al. (2006) proposed that chimeric constructs should be developed for convenient, inexpensive, and effective immunization against Newcastle disease and avian influenza in poultry (Park et al. 2006) .",
