One option to solve this crisis is to promote individual actions, i.e. to encourage people to change their lifestyle and reduce their carbon footprint [1,2]. Examples include buying goods locally, decreasing the use of high-carbon emission transport means, investing in a green economy, or eating less meat. Focusing on individual actions may be a bit too simplistic however. Social psychology and behaviour economics studies indicate that citizens may lack finances, knowledge and motivation to effectively participate in a low carbon economy [3,4]. In other words, while the ecological clock is ticking, only little will be done to alleviate climate change and prevent disastrous ecological consequences without top-down grand scheme political action [5].",

My point of view comes from my clinical experience in addiction and eating disorders, two issues in which reluctance to change (e.g. stop using drugs, putting on weight) is one of the core symptoms. One of the arts of being a psychiatrist is precisely to understand and deal with difficulties to change, be able to say or do things that can get a patient to take the plunge, and avoid saying things that could increase resistance to change. This situation requires the selection of specific strategies to be used in the doctor-patient relationship. Historically, two key options have been trialled to promote behaviour change, confronting and collaborating. A vast amount of evidence from the scientific literature pleads for the latter as being a more effective change method than the former [10]. However, recent accounts from the field of eating disorders suggest that collaborating could elicit verbal rather than behavioural motivation, which in turn can obstruct recovery [11]. A third, more recently proposed option is to withdraw from purely verbal accounts of motivation to facilitate behavioural change, for instance by preparing for future consequences of inaction or even disinvesting from treatment [11].",

I show why attempts to alleviate climate change by confronting and collaborating are ineffective.

After all, low weight is associated with severe physical, psychological and social consequences that could reverse if the patient simply decides to put on weight: recovery is only one step away. These impairing consequences are typically the basis of the potential drive to change, along with future positive prospects such as discovering their own personality, getting their libido back and being able to have children. However, these drivers to change are also counterbalanced by a strong opposing force for the status-quo (i.e. to continue business-as-usual) (Table 1\n). First, patients often have to face other, more pressured, challenges that conflict with their core treatment: they have financial difficulties, a family to look after and day-to-day crises to solve. Second, although patients suffer from their disorder, they can also strongly value their disorder as it often helps them cope with life and increase their self-esteem. Third, potential solutions are inherently tough to implement. For instance, taking a pill everyday can give rise to side effects, and implementing CBT exercises regularly can be very time-consuming. Overall, despite their good intentions, our patients often lose track of expressed motivation to treat their disorders after having left the therapist office \u2013 a phenomenon called \u201cthe parking lot syndrome\u201d [12], and a clear sign that their \u201cbusiness-as-usual\u201d mindset is back into place.",

Their motivation, like that of patients, is ambiguous and dependent on a decisional balance (Table 1). Most politicians say change needs to be implemented, following consistent scientific evidence, to avoid disastrous consequences. Positive consequences of change, such as energizing green growth, are also evoked. However, politicians also have good reasons to not change. First, there are always other, more pressured, social, political, economical or cultural challenges that distract them from climate action. Often, the resolution of these other immediate challenges in fact require anti-climate actions. Second, greenhouse gas emissions are somewhat strongly valued by politicians (and their potential electors) because energy consumption is directly related to affluence [13] in wealthy societies. Decreasing greenhouse gas emissions would significantly compromise our way of life. Third, from increased regulations or carbon taxes to stimulation of clean energy innovation or even degrowth, each potential solution to alleviate climate change has its pros and cons [14]. Choosing and implementing the best options is a long and delicate process that needs a lot of compromises and discussions amongst different stakeholders, including securing substantial financial inputs. Overall, it is only too easy for politicians to lose track of their good intentions to face climate change and to restore their usual mindset, where climate matters are ignored. Conversely, simply condemning their inaction is seriously underestimating these political challenges.",

Specifically, these activists are calling for a strategy of public disruption, with actions such as occupying parliaments and council chambers, blocking access to famous events, or other extreme demonstrations. Other confronting activists may rely on calmer actions, yet they share with Extinction Rebellion a tendency to antagonize those who are in power. For instance, young Greta Thunberg and the Flight-Shaming movement add to their demonstrations emotional components that often reject those in power to make changes. Here, the activists' method is to clearly set up a moral opposition between those who want change (the good) and those who are reluctant to change (the bad) [17].

Motivational enhancement therapy has been found to not add much to other treatments that aim at helping anorexics recover [24,25] \u2013 treatments whose overall efficacy is already relatively low [26]. Why is that? In a remarkable conference that then became a journal article, Professor Glenn Waller, a consultant clinical psychologist specialized in eating disorders, theorized the difficulties and myths related to motivational change in patients suffering from eating disorders [11]. Crucially, according to Waller, anorexic patients' statements of motivation (hereby called manifestos) can relatively easily be obtained, yet they are not necessarily meant to achieve recovery. Rather, the typical function of such manifestos is to receive treatment in order to get \u201ccare\u201d, get \u201cpeople off my back\u201d, \u201cmake others feel happier\u201d, \u201cget out of demands\u201d, or the opposite \u201cbe allowed to carry on with my life's many demands\u201d. This leaves a situation where patients engage in treatment but without changing. In other words, the assessment of motivation using MI can easily be flawed: while the motivational process is blocked at its verbal stage rather than progressing to the behavioural phase, the assessment gives the impression of a strong motivational case.",

Second, not implementing (behavioural) change methods allows patients to avoid facing the difficult consequences of not coping with life using eating disordered behaviours and cognitions. Third, coming to therapy sessions and showing verbal motivation to change without trying to recover fulfils the reasons of being in treatment that were mentioned above (i.e. it provides care, reduces worries in loved ones, and gives a certain status to either get out of or be allowed to carry on with demands). Overall, when motivational work is blocked at its verbal stage with strong manifestos, the function of therapy is limited to reassurance without helping to change, and in turn, can give more power to the status-quo.",

For Greta Thunberg, as for so many others, only two options can explain that political leaders are currently failing to act against climate change: their evilness or their actual lack of understanding of the problem. Here, I plead for a more realistic option, that is, lack of political action is a direct consequence of their ambivalence \u2013 which is also that of our society. Climate action can save the world, but it can also seriously perturb the lifestyle we are so attached to. The originality of this qualitative study comes from its psychiatric lens: interpreting politicians' inaction against climate change as a core motivational issue, politicians may resemble patients that are stuck with inaction.",

On the one hand, discounting the challenges that politicians have to face on a day-to-day basis, and reacting emotionally or forcefully as if they were \u201cevil\u201d, is equivalent to playing a power struggle, which risks increasing their resistance to change. On the other hand, adding more arguments, discussions and statements of intents to the table, as if politicians had not understood the climate problem, risks feeding their manifestos without promoting active change. Going a step further, I have discussed withdrawal from politicians\u2019 manifestos as a third strategy that could create change. Yet, both disability training (based on scientific warnings) and disinvestment (from public institutions) have only little chances to succeed. This is because the benefits of climate action are seriously outweighed by the benefits that are dependent on our current greenhouse gas emissions, even after bypassing the manifestos.",

One of the perspectives brought by the current paper is to reframe the \u201cclimate paradox\u201d under a motivational, rather than a communicational or informational framework. This may better reflect the root cause, as well as the deadlocks, of the climate paradox. Under the motivational framework emphasis is put on the very strong value of greenhouse gas emissions (as a force for no-change), which systematically outweighs potential reasons for change. Communication strategies to reverse politicians' decisional balance have all great potential, however, counteracting strategies from those who do not want to lose the values attached to greenhouse gas emissions are arguably at least as powerful. Political manifestos are used in this line, to continue with business-as-usual, greenhouse gas-related, social norms whilst also promising change.",

This is of particular significance for the withdrawal strategy. Strategic withdrawal from the therapist removes the benefits of the patients' manifesto because the clinical situation involves a \u201csimple\u201d patient-therapist interaction. Conversely, in the climate situation, the multiplicity of interactions between different social groups complicates the power and pressure plays. In that sense, it is possible that withdrawal (e.g. with scientists' warnings or school boycotts) will have no effect on a politician's interaction with social groups that are not participating in the strategy. In turn, a politician's manifesto could still have a role to play when interacting with these social groups. This potential limitation is however orthogonal to the other, core drawback of the withdrawal strategy discussed in this paper, that is, the compelling benefits of the disorder (in the clinical situation) and of greenhouse gas emissions (in the climate situation).",

If a politician's decisions follow the demands of citizens, however, it is likely that the decisional balance of citizens is similar to that of politicians. In that sense, citizens facing climate change would also be subject to a core motivational dilemma and the three investigated strategies would lead to similar roadblocks than for politicians. Confirming these predictions, for instance by comparing politicians vs. citizens motivation using semi-structured interviews could be an interesting prospect for future research.",

Yet, while there is potential for a politician's manifesto to turn into action at some point, parts of the planet might already be inhabitable by then. To avoid this situation, this study pleads for a discontinuation of current strategies aiming at promoting climate action.

Greenhouse gas emissions being at the core of our normative way of life, enhanced methods may be necessary to change our mindset about climate change. Enforcing strict constraints to impose climate action, for instance through authoritarian governance or dictatorship, is a potential solution that we obviously would like to avoid, just as we all tend to avoid sectioning patients to impose weight gain in anorexia. A more interesting and viable option may reside in increasing the level of support to those who need to change. In anorexia, adolescents have good evidence of recovery with family-based therapy [38,39], and increasing the level of care into a day programme or full-time hospitalisation has shown good (and persistent) rates of remission [40]. In the world of climate change, the solution might also come from solid, powerful and effective institutions that could support politicians to create change, for instance justice, education, businesses and cultural industries. Here, contrary to boycotting those institutions as in the disinvestment strategy, the idea would be to strongly rely on them in order to assist politicians to implement change methods.",

Moreover, some educational systems [43], but also music bands [44], sport stars [45] and even airline companies [46,47] have acknowledged the climate problem or even started to decrease their greenhouse gas-related activities. Here, rather than simply confronting, discussing, or withdrawing from reassuring speeches, these institutions and industries may have implemented the very first steps towards the adoption of more sustainable practices, and as such could be setting examples for policy-makers. This in turn could promote the long term goals of changing social norms and mindsets in order to achieve drastic cultural changes that should expedite climate action [48].",
