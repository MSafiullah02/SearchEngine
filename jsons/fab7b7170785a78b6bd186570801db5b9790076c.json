Since the healthcare resources are highly stretched taking care of the COVID-19 patients, other parts of the Iranian healthcare system are critically influenced. Cancer care is specifically facing innumerable challenges in our country, putting the clinical decision-makers in a parlous risk of mismanagement, ranging from the risk of the exposure to COVID-19 to the harm caused by the delayed treatment. Regarding the therapies, cancer patients are vulnerable to a broad spectrum of infectious diseases, and that is why careful management has always been taken into account [1] . Age, treatment history and underlying health conditions are the most determinative factors for the prognosis of infection in cancer patients [2] . Also, the weakened immune system tremendously increases the risk of acquired infection, either from the community or hospital. Therefore, COVID-19 infection will ultimately interrupt the patient's treatment.",

This emphasizes the fact that all patients should be properly educated about personal hygiene and reduce close contact with others as much as possible. In patients who are tested positive, manipulating the immune system should be done under caution, considering the key features of the type of cancer. Otherwise, isolation procedures still need to be in progress. For the latter recommendation, Telemedicine proves to be useful as it can make the in-person clinical appointments shorter or even not needed at all, enable remote consultation anytime and anywhere, and make the follow-ups much safer [4] . This is especially important for cancer patients due to their need for constant surveillance, though only a few centers in Iran have considerable telecommunication infrastructures and expanded hotlines, and are capable of implementing this strategy.",

The general opinion points to reschedule elective surgeries. In case of facing oncological emergencies or complex cases, it is again up to the clinician and the harm-benefit analysis of each patient, considering that the surgery puts both patients and medical teams on a higher risk of exposure. On the other hand, skipping radiation therapy sessions seems to have rather unfavorable results, mainly because of potential insufficient clinical outcomes as a result of the interruption. Also, in some patients, interrupting the radiation therapy cuts the curative effects and results in tumor growth. However, in early-detected cases, a patient-based adjusting or delaying the therapy may lead to protective effects against COVID-19 infection. Chemotherapy may include the most diverse viewpoints. It has an extensive clinical effect but almost always is accompanied by immune suppression. Any change in chemotherapy should be done according to these three considerations:",
