EBV [Figure 1], a virus of herpes family, also called human herpes virus 4, which is one of the most important viruses in human being.[1] LCLs have been used for simplification of immunological and molecular studies, effectively. Banking of EBV cell lines also holds great potential for providing reference material for rare genetic disorders diagnosis. This virus was first discovered by Sir Michael Anthony Epstein and Yvonne MR. Barr in Burkitt lymphoma cell line mononucleosis and was then linked to the infectious mononucleosis disease by the Histocompatibility Research Community. LCLs are used to produce reference HLA typed cells for use in functional and serological studies, extensively.[2] LCLs were also used in the management of large amounts of DNA for genetic analysis of complex conditions in population and family disease collections.[3]",

The B-lymphocytes were purified to allow direct deduction of the number of inflexible and growing cells after infection.[12] Benefits of human immortal blood lymphocytes is that it provides a permanent storage source of the desired genetic materials,[13] preventing the repetitive sampling.
