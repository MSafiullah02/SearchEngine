Coastal cantons have a lower attack rate than the highlands and living above >2,500 m seems to be linked with a lower risk of dying (RR: 0.63 [CI 95% 0.50 -0.79]).

According to the Health Services Report published by the National institute of Statistics (INEC), Ecuador has less than 2,000 respirators nationwide and less than 700 in Guayas, the province most affected by this pandemic (40) . The lack of intensive care units in the country (less the 400 ICU units in 2017) and the lack of available beds during the first peak of the pandemic in Ecuador is probably one of the reasons behind the high death toll reported locally (40) . Although the hypostatized protective effect of living at above certain elevation on the pathophysiology of COVID-19 has been described, the effect of hypoxia, adaptation and mortality caused by SARS CoV-2 at higher altitudes is still unknown (41) .

            "text": "One of the main limitations in understanding the development of COVID-19 in Ecuador is the lack of molecular testing capabilities (48) . In January, alarms went off with the first suspected COVID-19 case in Ecuador, alarms that denoted the poor readiness of the public health system that took more than 15 days to rule-out a highly suspicious COVID-19 patient, who died with the diagnosis of hepatitis B and atypical pneumonia (49, 50) . At the beginning of the outbreak, the World Health Organization (WHO) emphasized the importance of testing capabilities in order to improve case tracing and diseases detection worldwide. Nevertheless, Ecuador has not enough capabilities to perform molecular diagnosis (RT-PCR), limiting epidemiological surveillance strategies and case tracing (30, 51) . For this reason, the number of samples taken exceeds the local molecular diagnosis capabilities, causing that thousands of tests are not been reported in a daily basis (25, 26) . Despite the limitations, in some areas of the country, especially richer areas, such as Samborondon, testing rates are as high as those seen in Iceland or even close to those seen in the US (52). This trend might be driven by those patients who were able to pay for their diagnosis and their medical treatment. Therefore, their high attack rate is interpreted as better access to health resources and that is why mortality is also low among these cantons. Although social status and monthly income was not assessed, in Ecuador, blue collar workers have less monetary income than health care and white-collar workers (53, 54) . In Ecuador, it is hypothesized that labor workers and the unemployed have less access to health services, therefore the high case fatality rates among these groups is significantly .
