Even the timing of the initial stages of the infection and its dynamics seem to have been very different even among contiguous provinces, as clusters of Covid-19 contagion have been often located in very restricted areas. One of the proof of this lack of spread homogeneity is in the initial stage of the virus outbreak which was located at the border between Lombardy and Emilia-Romagna regions, namely in the Lodi province (Lombardy) and in Piacenza province (Emilia-Romagna). The provinces of Varese in Lombardy and Ravenna in Emilia-Romagna are not in the least comparable with the provinces of Lodi and Piacenza in terms of intensity of the contagion. Moreover, antigen testing had been initially conducted depending on the choices of the local health authorities, and hospital admissions in the early stages of the emergency depended on the management and absorption capacity of the local health units, resulting in many differences in practising hospital care at a local level. Also the management of elder people, in particular those living in retirement homes, was quite different locally, causing in some cases the development of local sites of the infection, and a local increase of the mortality, since the illness was particularly severe on elder people.",

We consider here a model consisting of 4 compartments: susceptible (S), infected (I), recovered (R) and died (D), that were the only compartments for which we could find available data at NUTS-3 level in Italy. In the case of SARS-Cov-2 virus, it was proven that the infection has an incubation period of about 5 days and that a significant percentage of the infected people are asymptomatic [7, 6, 13] , thus actually more compartments should and have been considered both in deterministic and stochastic models (see e.g. [1, 2, 9, 10, 15, 21] ). Unfortunately the data unavailability at NUTS-3 level would cause problems in the parameters identification [20] . Furthermore we decided to keep the model as simple as possible in order to make it more accountable and, at the same time, robust to the variation in time of the parameters.",

In fact the rate of infection depends implicitly on the limitation of the mobility of the citizens; on the measures of protection of the healthcare personnel and of the workers who kept on doing jobs which were considered essential services to the community; on the number of antigen tests performed locally to detect the infected subjects in order to put them in strict quarantine. Also the recovery rate and the death rate are changing in time and in space because of the different burden of the local healthcare systems and the new insights in the pulmonary illness caused by the SARS-Cov-2 virus and its possible pharmacological and medical treatment. We thus studied a SIRD model whose parameters are evolving in time, and able to automatically adapt to the factors which are implicitly causing their changes. This makes our model able to predict with a good reliability the short term evolution of the epidemics, in particular in absence of sudden big changes of the population behaviour or the health policy. We leave the detection of major change points in the parameters behaviour to subsequent papers, using time series or stochastic processes techniques like the one described in [17] In the following sections we describe our main data sources, the model that we implemented and its parameters estimation and provide a detailed study of the fitting of the predictions made by our model with real data.",

No data about deaths and recovered patients were provided 1 . Therefore, we decided to integrate the official data on cases with data on deaths derived from press conferences and reports published online by regional authorities or local newspapers. The number of the cumulative recovered individuals at a provincial level has been estimated using the recovery rate at the regional level, computed as the ratio of recovered people and the total number of cases in each day.

Another series not available at a provincial level was that of the number of recovered people at time t. We estimated it proportionally to that of the region where the province is in, taking into account the population of the province. The reason for this choice is that patient treatment for the illness due to Covid-19 could be considered more uniform across the various provinces (with almost the same recovery rate across provinces within the region) than for the number of deaths.",

The problem of unreliable data becomes even more cogent with epidemiological models, both deterministic and stochastic, when many parameters should be estimated on the basis of unreliable data, especially for long-range estimates which are even more important for an outbreak with such dramatic consequences the whole world is experiencing. This inevitably results in a few more uncertainty on the estimates.

COVID-19 definitely respects the first assumption and some preliminary studies show that recovered individuals receive at least short-term immunity.

This kind of model is chosen because in Italy, as well as in various other countries facing the virus, containment measures have been adopted and incremented over time. In particular, a national lockdown was introduced in Italy on March 11th, 2020 and lasted until May 4th, 2020. By allowing the parameters, and especially the effective transmission rate, to vary over time, the effect of control measures can be somewhat included in the model. On the other hand, recovery and mortality rate are likely to depend on the pressure under which hospitals and, in particular, intensive care units are in, which increases sharply at the beginning of an epidemic (i.e. when a high mortality rate is reported) and then relaxes after the health system capacity is enhanced.",

As the transmission rate is the parameter that most depends on policy decisions and therefore the most likely parameter to change over time, the number of lags for the other parameters has been set equal to the optimal number of lags for \u03b2(t), so as to have three homogeneous time series. The method that was employed to choose the optimal number of lags is the Akaike Information Criterion (AIC): the number of lags that minimizes the AIC is chosen within a given range.

For a time horizon lower than 5 days, 75% of the provinces are accurately predicted with percentage errors lower than 10%. A time horizon equal to 6 days still shows an acceptable level of error with almost all of the provinces below the 20% threshold. Even when the time horizon covers 13 days, half of the provinces show errors below 25%, meaning that although the overall accuracy decreases, the model still performs pretty well on some provinces. The maximum reasonable time horizon is chosen using the value of the 3rd quartile metric and setting the upper bound to 20%, so that at least 75% of the provinces would show acceptable levels of prediction errors. Using this method, the resulting maximum time horizon is 9 days. We consider predictions within a 7 to 9-day period as being still accurate enough, while any consideration based on the model beyond this horizon may be misleading and should be carefully assessed.",

Here, the MAPE on currently infected is used using a one-week horizon. Figure 9 shows how the one-week prediction error varies when we start to forecast the currently infected in different days. We can see that there are no alarming shifts in the model accuracy and that the large majority of the provinces are always below the 20 % threshold. Although this happens in the sample period of our choice, it is likely that the model accuracy has improved since the beginning of the epidemic, when most provinces reported very low numbers of cases, making the predictions harder.",

There are different reasons why the model is unable to accurately forecast the development of the disease in these provinces. For example, some of them, such as Oristano and Matera, are among the least-hit provinces in Italy. On the other hand, there are some provinces like Imperia that show quite inconsistent time series on the official reported total cases, with frequent later adjustments. The following is the complete list of provinces with a MAPE less than 10%, between 10% and 20% and more than 20%.",

In order to build prediction intervals for the model's parameters, a forward bootstrap algorithm using fitted residuals was used [19] . A zero lower bound was imposed for all the parameters so as to avoid results that contradict the compartmental logic of the SIRD model. The number of lags in each regression is kept constant during the bootstrap re-training repetitions. The same procedure is applied to the three regressions of the model, respectively used for \u03b2, \u03b3R, and \u03b3D. The lower (low) and upper (up) bounds for the basic reproduction number are computed using Equation (5) . However, when all the three parameters have a zero lower bound, the upper bound of R0 cannot be computed since the denominator will be equal to 0. Bootstrap interval for each parameter are shown in Figure 13 . Figure 13 : Parameters' prediction intervals with \u03b1 = 10 % -Torino Each of the model's variables depends on all of the parameters so that the obtained error range for a parameter must be combined with the other two parameters' intervals: thus, the intervals for the variables are subject to the uncertainty of three different parameters and can be composed in different ways.",
