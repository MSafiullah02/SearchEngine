During the 1970s, several viruses were associated with this syndrome, which are now known to be caused mainly by viruses belonging to four distinct families-rotaviruses, caliciviruses, astroviruses, and adenoviruses. Other viruses, such as the toroviruses, picobirnaviruses, coronavirus, and enterovirus 22, may play a role as well. Transmission by food or water has been documented for astroviruses, caliciviruses, rotaviruses, and norovirus. In developing countries, gastroenteritis is a common cause of death in children \\5 years, while deaths from diarrhea are less common, much illness leads to hospitalization or doctor visits. Laboratory confirmation of waterborne illness is based on demonstration of virus particles or antigen in stool, detection of viral nucleic acid in stool, or demonstration of a rise in specific antibody to the virus. Newer methods for syndrome surveillance of acute viral gastroenteritis are being developed like multiplex real-time reverse transcriptase PCRs. Application of these more sensitive methods to detect and characterize individual agents is just beginning, but has already opened up new avenues to reassess their disease burden, examine their molecular epidemiology, and consider new directions for their prevention and control through vaccination, improvements in water quality, and sanitary practices.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Abstract"}], "body_text": [{"text": "Viral gastroenteritis resulting from exposure to contaminated drinking and recreational waters has been reported worldwide.

Group specificity of rotaviruses is determined by the internal structural protein, viral protein 6 (VP6) which is the target of commercial immunoassays (Tang et al. 1997) . Within each group, rotaviruses are classified into serotypes on the basis of two outer capsid proteins, VP7 (G-protein/glycoprotein) and VP4 (P-protein/protease-sensitive protein) which induce neutralizing antibodies, on the basis of which a binary serotyping system has been developed. Till date, 15 VP7 or G serotypes have been identified. VP4 is a protease-cleaved protein, and serotypes determined by this protein are termed P serotypes. Due to a lack of readily available typing serum or monoclonal antibodies to different VP4 types, 26 different genotypes of VP4 have been identified based on sequence analysis of VP4.

When intracellular calcium concentrations fall, rotavirus virions uncoat, forming double-layered subviral particle (DLP).

In developing countries, the incidence of rotavirus diarrhea has varied between 0.07 and (Bresee et al. 1999) . The incidence is similar in developed countries, implying that this infection cannot be effectively controlled by improvement in sanitation and hygiene. Incidence of disease peaks among children 4 to 23 months of age, but illness in adults is also known. Neonatal infections are often asymptomatic because of protection from maternal immunity, while infections after 3 months of age are more likely to be symptomatic. Reinfections of rotavirus are common, but disease severity decreases with each repeat infection. Therefore, depending on the epidemiologic setting, the proportion of children with rotavirus diarrhea varies, for example, a median of 8 % of all cases of diarrhea in the community, 28 % of outpatient visits, and 34 % of hospitalizations are accounted for by rotavirus infections (Bresee et al. 1999 ). The incidence of rotavirus serotypes has varied by geographic location and time. Gene segments that encode the G-and P-proteins can segregate independently. This gives rise to strains with at least 42 different P-G serotype combinations. Of the different serotypes of group A rotavirus identified, only 5 types (G1 through G4 and G9) are common; recently, G8 strains have emerged as important strains in parts of Africa. The four predominant P-G combinations, P[8]G1, P[4]G2, P[8]G3, and P[8]G4, comprise 88.5 % of the strains worldwide (Santos and Hoshino 2005) .
