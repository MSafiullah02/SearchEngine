However, it is still unclear how the viruses survive for such a long time and why their survivability varies between different surfaces. To address these questions, we conducted systematic experiments investigating the evaporation of droplets produced by a nebulizer and human-exhaled gas on different surfaces. We found that these droplets do not disappear immediately with evaporation, but instead shrink to a size of a few micrometers (referred to as residues) which can stay on a surface for more than 24 hours. The evaporation characteristics of these residues change significantly with surface types. Specifically, the surfaces with high thermal conductivity like copper do not leave any resolvable residues, while stainless steel, plastic and glass surfaces form residues that remain stable for extended durations. Lowering humidity can significantly suppress the formation of residues. Such trends are well correlated with SARS-CoV-2 survivability measurements in the literature. Our results suggest that these microscale residues can potentially shield viral RNA, allowing them to survive inhospitable environments and remain infectious for prolonged durations after deposition. Our findings are also applicable for other respiratory viruses (e.g., SARS-CoV-1, flu viruses, etc.), and can lead to practical guidelines for disinfecting surfaces of different types and other prevention measures (e.g., humidity control) for limiting virus infection.",

            "text": "The ongoing COVID-19 pandemic has infected more than five million people as of writing, causing major disruption to the global economy and social orders. As reported by two recent experiments (Chin et al. 2020; van Doremalen et al. 2020), the virus that causes the disease (SARS-CoV-2) has a long survival time on different surfaces and can remain viable under different temperature and humidity levels. Specifically, Chin et al. (2020) investigated the stability of SARS-CoV-2 deposited as droplets on ten surfaces and under different temperatures, and found the virus to be more stable on smooth surfaces (e.g. glass and plastic), remaining viable for up to two and four days, respectively, and that this survival time reduces with increasing temperature. van Doremalen et al. (2020) measured the viability of viruses on four surfaces to vary from approximately seven hours on copper to more than three days on plastic (polypropylene). However, neither study provides a mechanism that can explain the long survival times and such large variation between the different surface materials tested. In addition, several studies explored the statistical correlation of COVID-19 outbreaks with environmental factors such as temperature and humidity, but did not lead to any clear conclusions Wang et al. 2020; . Considering the fact that the contact of virus-laden respiratory droplets on surfaces is a well-recognized pathway for COVID-19 transmission (Li et al. 2020; WHO 2020), we hypothesize the evaporation characteristics of such droplets may indicate SARS-CoV-2 survivability on different surfaces and under different humidity and temperature conditions. In the literature, the studies of droplet evaporation on surfaces typically involve seeded particles and focus on particle pattern formation for various applications such as inkjet/3D printing, manufacturing selfassembled structures, etc. (Partsa et al. 2018). Only a recent study investigated ultrapure water",

Qualitative inspection reveals that the water droplets do not disappear with evaporation but rather leave behind a residue on the order of micrometers that persists with no visible change in its size for hours ( Figure 1 and supplementary videos) . Broadly, we observe either a single residue, most likely a thin film or droplet, or multiple residues, formed by breakup of a thin film. Single residues form due to evaporation on a glass surface both in the absence of contact pinning (Fig. 1a) or with a pinned contact line (Fig. 1b) . Near the end of evaporation on a coated glass substrate, the pinned film sometimes recoils due to effect of surface tension, leaving behind a central lobe of liquid (Fig. 1c) . Alternatively, on a stainless steel surface, strong pinning of the evaporating droplet results in a large area thin film residue as shown in Figure 1d . We do observe similar thin films on copper substrates but with a thickness much smaller than for steel. Our approach is unable to fully quantify the residues size on copper surfaces due to the weaker signal inherent to such thin films. However, we expect the size and scale of such residues to be significantly smaller than for the steel surface. The primary mode of forming multiple residues is through breakup of a pinned thin film due to the effect of surface roughness, particularly on the stainless steel surface (Fig 1e) or surface tension based instabilities on a coated glass slide (Fig.  1f ). (upper) and their corresponding residues (lower) indicating the various pathways for the formation of single and multiple residues. Single residues form by (a) non-pinning droplet evaporating on a coated glass surface, (b) pinned droplet evaporating on an uncoated glass surface, (c) film recoil for pinned droplet and (d) contact pinned evaporation on stainless steel forming a large area of residue (marked by outline). Multiple residues form due to (e) roughness induced film break-up in stainless steel surface or (f) surface tension induced film breakup on a coated glass substrate.",

            "text": "To characterize the evaporation process of the droplets, we measure the diameter (Dp) as a function of time (t) for the different surfaces. For the three different outcomes observed on different surfaces, i.e., unresolved residue (on copper), single residue (either droplet or thin film) and multiple residues (film breakup to multiple droplets or multiple thin films), the corresponding trends of the evaporation curves are illustrated in Figure 2 . We define Dp as the area equivalent diameter of the droplet to enable comparisons between non-spherical and spherical shapes observed. The initial droplet size Dp(0) is identified at the time when the droplet begins to changes in size (non-pinned evaporation) or indicates a change in the intensity distribution within the droplet (due to drop height change under pinned evaporation). The time for evaporation TF and the size of the residue Dp(TF) are also defined separately for each type of residue formation mechanism illustrated in Figure 1 . For cases that form an unresolved residue, we define the time at which droplet disappears completely as the final evaporation time (Fig. 2a) . Note that we prescribe the final droplet size of zero for such unresolved residues. A majority of droplets result in the formation of a single residue (either droplet or film) whose size is defined as the plateau in the droplet size near the end of evaporation. Concurrently, we define the time at which the curve reaches this plateau as the final evaporation time. Lastly, in a small fraction of cases, we obtain multiple residues predominantly due to breakup of a film type residue. For such cases, we measure multiple plateaus for the individual residues but define the final size as the root sum of squares of all candidates (or as the droplet with area equal to the sum of all residues). The use of the aggregate area of all residues serves to accurately capture the total contribution of the cluster that originates from a single droplet and will have a value larger than the individual droplet size. Figure 3 presents the average evaporation curves for the five tested surfaces, with data points at each time step calculated using 100 independent droplets and the shaded region corresponding to the standard deviation which we use as a measure of variation between the droplets. For all surfaces, we see an initial slow rate of change in size over a duration of ~0.1TF to 0.4TF followed by a rapid descent to form the final residue. Surfaces which do not pin contact lines (i.e., hydrophobic surfaces like the coated glass) present a much higher initial evaporation rate (Fig. 3c ) compared to the remaining cases. It is interesting to note that even though the plastic surface is hydrophobic, the absence of a similar rapid initial evaporation points to the presence of an additional source of influence for contact pinning, possibly surface roughness. The copper surface measures the sharpest rate of change in size near the end of evaporation, with a large variation in droplet shapes leading to the higher variance in size at this time. In contrast, the coated glass substrate, which produces droplets of uniform shape, shows the least variance in size along the entire evaporation process.",

The steel surface indicates the largest residue of ~ 0.22D0 ( Fig. 3e ) with the highest variance in size due to a large fraction of film type residues as well as the influence of large scale roughness. Next, we have the coated glass substrate at ~ 0.18D0 (Fig.3c ) followed by the uncoated glass and plastic surfaces at ~ 0.09D0 (Fig.3b, d) , respectively. It is interesting to note that both coated and uncoated glass surface have the lowest variation in residue size which can be attributed to the lack of diversity in the type of residue formed on these surfaces.

Interestingly, our measurements on the copper surface shows no clear dependence between the droplet size and evaporation time, possibly due to the high thermal conductivity influencing the evaporation process. The plastic surface measures the longest duration for evaporation, on average, followed by the coated glass. Such trends compare favorably to lower evaporation rates expected on hydrophobic surfaces due to the smaller surface area exhibited by the droplet. In contrast, all hydrophilic surfaces measure evaporation times which are approximately half of the coated glass, with the uncoated glass showing even faster evaporation. The large scatter in the data for copper and plastic cases can be attributed to the presence of the large variation in droplet shapes and size for the former as well as the range of residue types formed by both surfaces, which may point to multiple underlying evaporation mechanisms. Surfaces with minimal variation in droplet residue type i.e., both glass surfaces, show the least amount scatter in the evaporation time. To investigate the long-term behavior of the residues, we measured the number and size of residues on the four surfaces that produce resolvable residues (i.e., all except copper), for a period of 24 hours in Figure 5 . As shown in Fig. 5a , the normalized number of residues, referred to as residue fraction, decays gradually with time for all surfaces except for steel which shows a sharp decline at the beginning, reaching a plateau at ~15% potentially due to the large thermal conductivity and surface roughness improving contact area for evaporation. The uncoated glass surface with the highest surface energy retains ~95% of the residues while the hydrophobic surfaces (i.e., coated glass and plastic) both retain ~80%. The average residue size shown in Figure  5b for all surfaces show a rapid decrease at the beginning followed by an almost linear tail with very similar slopes (~0.01 to 0.03) at longer durations. Such slow rates of change in the size means that such microscopic residues, which are mostly invisible to our eyes, can survive on such surfaces for extended periods of time. Figure 5 .

The authors suggest that this phenomenon is caused by deliquescence by the ionic compounds in the photoresist substrate, in the presence of humidity. However, such a mechanism cannot be extended to explain the observations from the current experiment, especially for a clean substrate in the absence of similar ionic compounds. In comparison, the phenomena observed in our experiments can be generally attributed to an equilibrium state during droplet evaporation, in which a delicate balance among substrate surface energy, gas-liquid interfacial energy, the internal energy of the evaporating droplet and its surrounding air is established. For instance, the air temperature influences the rate of evaporation, and often decreases as the droplet evaporates, due to energy consumed by the phase change process, at the same time increasing the humidity of the air. Simultaneously, water vapor in the air condenses on the droplet, the rate of which is controlled by the absolute humidity of the surrounding air. Although initially high, the evaporation rate often decreases with time due to both the local reduction in temperature and increase in humidity (McDowall 2007) . However, in cases where the thermal conductivity of the substrate provides sufficient energy to keep the evaporation rate high (i.e. copper), the droplet completely disappears leaving behind a thin film residue (Lopes et al. 2013) . In contrast, for the remaining surfaces, once the evaporation and condensation rates become equal, the process achieves equilibrium with no net change in the droplet size possible without any external stimulus (through lowering humidity or increasing temperature of air) thus leaving a residue droplet (Mezhericher et al. 2010) . The exact mechanism underlying this phenomenon requires further investigation and is outside the scope of the current study.",

Specifically, the residue size, which is typically 1-2 orders larger than that of SARS-CoV-2, can shield the viruses from fluctuations in the environmental conditions that lead to the breakdown of viral RNA (Chin et al. 2020 , Moriyama et al. 2020 . Our work has shown that these residues do form, and their formation depends on surface characteristics such as thermal conductivity and wettability. In particular, the challenge to form large scale residues on copper in comparison to other surfaces under the same humidity and temperature conditions explains the substantially shorter survival time of SARS-CoV-2 on copper reported in van Doremalen et al. (2020). Next, a high surface wettability leads to formation of large area thin film type residues compared to a spherical or thick film types formed under hydrophobic surfaces (coated glass & plastic). The presence of surface roughness can also retain residues within acting as a shield, protecting viral RNA from the environment. The combination of surface roughness, low thermal conductivity and hydrophobicity for plastic or the coated glass ensures the longest survival time for the residues on them, followed by stainless steel and uncoated glass with copper at the bottom, which mirrors the results reported in van Doremalen et al. (2020) .",

The samples are placed with the test side facing up on an inverted microscope, connected with a Flare CMOS camera (2048 pixel \u00d7 1024 pixel sensor size) sampling at 30 frames/second. We used the nebulizer to generate droplets on the substrate (deposited size range 5 to 100 \u03bcm) and imaged them simultaneously under 10x magnification (1.21 mm \u00d7 0.64 mm field of view at 0.59 \u00b5m/pixel resolution) to capture the evaporation of liquid droplets and formation of the residues. The size of evaporating droplets at each time step and the corresponding residues are extracted from the 10x microscopic images manually using ImageJ, where the size is defined as the area-equivalent diameter.
