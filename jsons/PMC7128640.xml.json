A month later, the family moved to Webster, New York, a suburb outside Rochester. At the time of Steve\u2019s birth, his father was a recent graduate of St. Lawrence University, and he had accepted a teaching and coaching position in the Webster school district that later would lead to the position of principal of the high school. Eventually, the family settled into the family home in Penfield, where they have lived now for more than 50 years. Winifred had more than a full-time job as homemaker, lovingly rearing their five children (Figure 1) and supporting their various endeavors.",

He particularly enjoyed visiting his paternal grandparents, Leonina and Carlo Cochi, immigrants from Maenza, Italy, who had come through Ellis Island and settled in upstate New York and Long Island, where they established their own business, a single-pump gas station and small neighborhood store. After Carlo\u2019s death, Leonina continued to run the business until she was in her late 70s and a hip fractured forced her to retire. Today, Steve fondly remembers the summers spent helping her pump gas and selling ice cream and candy to the local children, as well as playing with his cousins and attending the annual St. Johnsville Fireman\u2019s Fair (personal correspondence, Jane Skvarich).",

He joined Sigma Alpha Epsilon fraternity and lived with fraternity brothers in Back Bay, where for fun they would go out after dark and chase rats from the trash bins with their hockey sticks!

From Duke, Cochi headed back to Boston and Massachusetts General Hospital, where he completed a 3-year residency. While he was doing a pediatric residency program, Cochi met a lovely young nurse in the pediatric intensive care unit, Jane Skvarich.

Global polio eradication is his highest priority (Figure 4). Cochi\u2019s leadership of this program, in coordination with the World Health Organization (WHO), Rotary International, UNICEF, and other partners has led to the following extraordinary achievements:\n\u2022Only six countries in the world remain polio-endemic, the lowest number of endemic countries in history. Since the initiative began in 1988, the number of polio cases has been reduced from more than 350,000 annually to 784 cases in 2003, a decline of more than 99 percent.\u2022Since 1988, an estimated 250,000 lives have been saved and nearly five million cases of childhood paralysis have been prevented through the initiative. In addition, more than one million lives have been saved since 1998 by administering vitamin A during polio-immunization campaigns.\u2022In June 2002, the European Region of WHO became the third region, along with the Americas and the Western Pacific, to be certified polio-free. Now more than 3 billion people in 134 countries, territories, and areas are living in certified polio-free zones.\n",

In partnership with WHO, UNICEF, the American Red Cross, the UN Foundation, and the International Federation of the Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies, his leadership has been critical to the following achievements:\n\u2022The elimination of indigenous measles in all countries of the Americas for nearly 2 years. Consequently, measles importations from Latin America, which used to be the most common source of imported measles into the United States, have decreased to zero since 2000.\u2022A 5-year global action plan to reduce by 2005 the number of deaths from measles in children by 50 percent (compared with 1999 estimates) is being implemented, with CDC as a major partner. During 2001 to 2003, campaigns against measles have been conducted in 29 countries in Africa, with more than 112 million children being immunized and an estimated 266,000 deaths being prevented.\u2022An integral part of the global polio-eradication program is a highly functional global surveillance system for acute flaccid paralysis and polioviruses. This system includes a network of 145 accredited poliovirus laboratories and a massive infrastructure of trained managers and staff and logistics. The system also is providing the backbone for developing surveillance for other vaccine-preventable diseases and will play a central role in a global early outbreak detection system.\n",

They both missed him and expressed desires to travel with him. Cochi promised them that when they were 13 years old, he would take them on a trip of their choice. That day finally came! Brad chose to go to China, and he and his father traveled together for 3 weeks in 1999 throughout China. When Shea\u2019s turn came in 2003, she and Cochi traveled to Switzerland, Northern Italy, and Austria.",

The newest addition to the family\u2019s interest is a house on Lake Hartwell, South Carolina, that includes a boat, and the entire family is enjoying learning about boating and lake life. And, of course, Cochi still loves movies of any kind.",
