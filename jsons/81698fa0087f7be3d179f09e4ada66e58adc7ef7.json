Today, these units have been expanded to care for severely ill patients with a wide variety of clinical conditions requiring close monitoring and support. A variety of medical conditions and physiologic disturbances have benefited from this care. Many critically ill patients have underlying infections and of those with infections, viruses are the cause in a small but important percentage (1,2). The majority of viral infections which require care in an intensive care unit involve the respiratory or the central nervous system. However, other organ systems, such as the gastrointestinal tract, may be severely affected by viruses and require support or close monitoring. The conditions reviewed in this chapter are found in adults and do not include HIV infections. Table 1 is a summary of acute illnesses which may be caused by viruses and require treatment in an ICU in the Western Hemisphere. The syndromes and special hosts that are associated with severe viral infections may be diagnosed from epidemiologic clues and specific laboratory tests (3, 4) . Clinical signs and symptoms are rarely sufficient to make a specific diagnosis of a viral infection.",

Pregnant women are more susceptible to a variety of viral infections including pneumonia (189, 190) . Influenzavirus, VZV, and measles have all been reported as causes of pneumonia (191) (192) (193) (194) . Complications of VZV can be particularly devastating during pregnancy. Ninety percent of adults living in nontropical areas are immune to varicella, therefore most pregnant women are not susceptible (195) . Pneumonia can occur a few days after the development of rash and fever and can lead to respiratory failure. Both the mother and fetus can suffer morbidity and mortality from varicella. Patients with the complication of varicella pneumonia should be treated aggressively with antiviral therapy and close monitoring (194) (195) (196) (197) . Acyclovir is generally accepted as the treatment of choice despite the lack of safety studies (198) . In pregnant women with no history of VZV who have an exposure, the use of VZIG may be beneficial in preventing maternal infection (199) . Another virus that may lead to admission to the ICU is HSV. HSV infection can affect both the mother and the developing fetus (200) (201) (202) . HSV of the genital tract can be transferred to the newborn and result in severe and life-threatening disease (203). Although rare, HSV type 2 causing encephalitis following cesarean section has been reported (204). Finally, given recent concerns regarding bioterrorism, it is important to realize that smallpox has had high mortality in the pregnant woman compared to the non-pregnant woman (205).",

CMV, EBV, VZV, HSV, HHV-6 and HHV-8 have all been reported to cause disease (188, (235) (236) (237) (238) . CMV disease constitutes a serious problem in bone marrow transplant recipients with a 30-50% incidence of clinically significant infections (239, 240) . Pneumonitis is the most serious complication and was associated with high mortality prior to antiviral therapy (241). Ganciclovir and foscarnet have been frequently used for prophylaxis and treatment of CMV (242-245). Hyperimmune globulin in combination with antivirals has also been used for treatment of disease (246). Ganciclovir resistance in CMV has been reported and should be considered when clinical responses do not occur (247). EBV can reactivate in transplant recipients and lead to uncontrolled B-cell proliferation and post-transplant lymphoproliferative disorder (PTLD) (248). This can present as frank lymphoma with high mortality rates. Donor lymphocyte infusions and anti-CD20 antibody has been used for treatment (249). HSV can present as both severe mucocutaneous disease or in rare cases encephalitis (250 ",

Predisposing conditions for influenza pneumonia include age >65 years, diabetes mellitus, chronic lung disease, pregnancy, and immunosuppression. Influenzavirus pneumonia can be overwhelming and rapidly fatal (37-39). Influenzavirus infection can lead to bacterial superinfection and pneumonia secondary to Streptococcus pneumoniae and less commonly, Staphylococcus aureus. Diagnosis can be made by obtaining respiratory secretions and testing for viral antigen or virus growth in cell culture, or by serologic tests such as HI or ELISA. HPS causes a non-cardiogenic pulmonary edema after initial influenza-like symptoms. HPS has a higher mortality than HFRS. The virus is transmitted to humans by inhalation of aerosolized particles of rodent excreta or by direct rodent contact. HPS has been recognized in 31 states, most commonly in the western region of the United States.",

Viral infections in transplant patients may present as a variety of clinical syndromes that require ICU stays. These include pneumonia, encephalitis, hepatitis and gastroenteritis(180,(214)(215)(216)(217)(218)(219).The variety of clinical presentations and radiographic features make diagnosis of specific viruses difficult. In the transplant patient, common community respiratory viruses such as influenzaviruses A and B, respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), adenovirus and parainfluenzavirus (PIV) can lead to fulminant pneumonia, respiratory failure and death (4,220-224). There has been increased mortality reported in hematopoietic stem cell transplant patients who. Occasional cases with metapneumovirus have been reported in stem cell transplant recipients (228,229). Both ribavirin with and without IVIG have been used to treat RSV pneumonia; but mortality remains high(33,230,231).Treatment benefit is generally seen when used prior to the development of respiratory failure (232). Other respiratory viruses that can lead to severe pneumonia are rhinoviruses and adenoviruses",
