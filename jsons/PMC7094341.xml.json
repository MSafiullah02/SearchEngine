            "text": "For the production of recombinant SARS-CoV PLpro, P-PLpro(C2)-His6 was expressed in Escherichia coli and purified as previously described [7]. P refers to the eight amino acid C-terminal pro-sequence (GTEPGGRS) of the ISG15 precursor protein, and PLpro(C2) corresponds to residues Gly1507 to Thr1858 of the SARS-CoV polyprotein. The purified protein was digested with 1 \u03bcg of trypsin (Roche Diagnostics, Laval, QC) per 100 \u03bcg of protein for 45 min at 22 \u00b0C. The reaction was quenched by 1 mM benzamidine (Eastman Kodak, NY), and was subjected to chromatography on a MonoQ HR 5/5 column (Amersham Biosciences, Inc., Piscataway, NJ), showing the same elution behavior as P-PLpro(C2)-His6 [cf. 7]. The purified PLpro migrated at an approximate molecular weight of 37 kDa in reducing SDS\u2013PAGE compared to 41 kDa for undigested purified P-PLpro(C2)-His6. N-terminal sequencing of two independent PLpro preparations showed that they consisted of two PLpro species each present in the protein band in close to equal amounts, starting with residues Ser1538 and Glu1541 of the SARS-CoV polyprotein, indicating the loss of the first 41 and 44 residues of P-PLpro(C2)-His6, respectively. Analytical gel filtration was consistent with the absence of these N-terminal sequences in the purified protein (not shown). The PLpro band was further detected by anti-His6 Western blotting (not shown), demonstrating the presence of an intact C-terminus. The two protein species in the PLpro preparation differ in length by only three amino acids at the N-terminus. They essentially comprise the catalytic core domain plus the N-terminal ubiquitin-like domain of SARS-CoV PLpro, and this represents the complete PLpro [13]. After addition of 2 mM dithiothreitol (DTT), purified PLpro was stored at \u221280 \u00b0C retaining its enzymatic activity for at least 6 months.",

ISG15 was modified to carry the stabilizing C78S mutation [9] using the QuikChange\u2122 Site-Directed Mutagenesis Kit (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). GFP refers to a variant of Aequorea victoria green fluorescent protein with the F64L/S65C/I167T/K238N mutations (Qbiogene, Montreal, QC), and the sequence of the E. coli maltose binding protein (MBP), including a C-terminal polylinker, was taken from the pMAL vector (New England Biolabs LTD, Pickering, ON). In order to generate fusion proteins that could serve as polyprotein substrates for the PLpro, sequences derived from MBP, Ub, ISG15, and GFP were PCR-amplified and cloned into the BamHI and XhoI sites of pET-21a(+) (Novagen, Madison, WI) with the T7 and the His6 tags at the N- and C-terminus, respectively (see supplementary material). In brief, in T7-MBP(6)-P-GFP-His6 and T7-MBP(12)-P-GFP-His6, the MBP is followed by the C-terminal six and twelve residues of mature ISG15, respectively (Fig. 1\n). The latter linker was included because results of a previous study using peptidyl vinyl sulfone inhibitors suggested that the 12 C-terminal residues of a Ubl sequence alone may contribute significantly to enzyme recognition [20]. T7-ISG15(C)-P-GFP-His6, where ISG15(C) refers to the C-terminal portion of ISG15 starting at Leu82 and ending at Gly157, was derived from T7-ISG15-P-GFP-His6 by deletion of the N-terminal Ub-like domain of ISG15. T7-ISG15(N)-Ub-P-GFP-His6, where ISG15(N) refers to the N-terminal portion of ISG15 ending at residue Pro81, resulted from T7-Ub-P-GFP-His6 by insertion of this domain upstream of the Ub sequence. Protein expression in E. coli BL21(DE3) cells (Novagen) was induced with 0.4 mM isopropyl-1-thio-b-d-galactopyranoside for 3 h at 22 \u00b0C. Proteins were purified by Ni2+ affinity chromatography, followed by buffer exchange to 20 mM Tris\u2013HCl (pH 7.8), and further purification on a MonoQ HR 5/5 column (Amersham Biosciences, Inc.) as described for PLpro. Samples were stable at 4 \u00b0C for at least 1 month. Protein concentrations for the PLpro and polyprotein substrates were determined using the Bio-Rad protein assay (Hercules, CA) with bovine serum albumin (Sigma, Saint Louis, MO) as the standard.",

It must be noted that for both ISG15(N)-Ub-AMC and ISG15(C)-AMC, minor peaks could be observed by MS at molecular mass higher than the predicted values by 16 and 32 kDa, indicating oxidation. Purification and storage of the substrates in presence of 1 mM of the reducing agent Tris(2-carboxyethyl)phosphine hydrochloride prevented the appearance of the minor peaks. Substrate oxidation did not, however, affect the rates of hydrolysis by the PLpro (data not shown). HPLC analysis of purified AMC substrates detected approximately 2\u201310% of non-labeled protein, and 50% of Gly-AMC. Control experiments, however, showed that the presence of the non-labeled protein and of Gly-AMC did not interfere with the activity measurements.

            "text": "The activity of PLpro and, for comparison, UCH-L3 and USP5 against the fluorogenic AMC derivatives of Ubl and variants was assessed as previously described for Ub-AMC [7]. For PLpro, the reaction conditions consisted of 50 mM Tris\u2013HCl (pH 7.8), 2 mM dithiothreitol (DTT), 200 mM NaCl, 1 mM benzamidine and 2% (vol/vol) dimethyl sulfoxide. UCH-L3 and USP5 were assayed in 50 mM Hepes (pH 7.8), 0.5 mM EDTA, 2 mM DTT and 2% (vol/vol) dimethyl sulfoxide. For USP5 enzyme assays, 100 nM of ubiquitin was also included in the reaction mixture [22]. Temperature was set at 25 \u00b0C for all assays involving AMC substrates. Reactions were initiated by the addition of enzyme to the cuvette, yielding final concentrations of enzyme of 3.3 nM for the assay with the substrate ISG15-AMC and 100 nM with the other AMC substrates. For UCH-L3 and USP5, enzyme concentrations were in the range of 0.05\u20131.0 nM and 2.0\u20137.5 nM, respectively, depending on the substrate used. The kinetic parameters for substrate hydrolysis were determined by monitoring full progress curves (i.e., by allowing complete hydrolysis of the substrate) at [S] << \nK\nM. Under these conditions, the progress curves follow first-order kinetics and values of k\ncat/K\nM were obtained by dividing the first-order rate constant by enzyme concentration. Controls were performed to insure that the enzyme did not loose activity during the course of the reaction, and that no product inhibition interfered with progress curve analysis. The reported k\ncat/K\nM values were within \u00b114% of the mean for at least three independent measurements. For poor substrates (i.e., k\ncat/K\nM values below ca 10,000 M\u22121\n s\u22121), k\ncat/K\nM could only be estimated using initial rate measurements.",

To investigate the influence of the ubiquitin-like domain sequences of ISG15 and Ub on the efficiency of hydrolysis by SARS-CoV PLpro in a precursor processing assay, we incubated the PLpro with a series of artificial precursor molecules illustrated in Fig. 1. Fig. 2\nshows the analyses of the reaction mixtures by SDS\u2013PAGE. The extent of substrate hydrolysis by the PLpro was quantified by densitometric analysis of the gels (see supplementary material). For T7-ISG15-P-GFP-His6, 50% hydrolysis was reached after 10 min of incubation (Fig. 2a). By comparison, hydrolysis of T7-Ub-P-GFP-His6 had reached only about 30% after 180 min (Fig. 2b). No hydrolysis was detectable for T7-MBP(6)-P-GFP-His6 and T7-MBP(12)-P-GFP-His6, where the non-Ubl protein MBP is fused to P-GFP by a linker containing the six and twelve C-terminal residues, respectively, of mature ISG15 (Fig. 2c). Therefore, hydrolysis of Ubl fusion proteins and variants by PLpro do not reflect solely the recognition of the LRLRGG sequence by the enzyme. In order to gain insight into the nature of the molecular determinants of substrate specificity, we have generated ISG15/Ub variants. A fusion protein containing only the C-terminal ubiquitin-like domain of ISG15 (T7-ISG15(C)-P-GFP-His6) was hydrolyzed more slowly than T7-ISG15-P-GFP-His6, reaching 50% hydrolysis after 60 min (Fig. 2d). We have also generated the fusion protein T7-ISG15(N)-Ub-P-GFP-His6, which contains a hybrid Ubl protein including the N-terminal residues of ISG15 followed by Ub. However, the purified protein was found to be unstable under assay conditions, and hydrolysis by PLpro could not be assessed. Overall, the results clearly show that the ISG15 fusion was hydrolyzed at least 15 times more efficiently than the Ub fusion, with the truncation of ISG15 missing the N-terminal Ub-like domain, i.e., ISG15(C), adopting an intermediate position.",

Hence, we synthesized a series of substrates representing fluorogenic AMC derivatives of the Ubl variants (Fig. 1) and used them to quantitatively determine catalytic efficiencies. The substrates were also evaluated against two well characterized DUBs, namely USP5 and UCH-L3. The results, illustrated in Fig. 3\n, are in agreement with the activity profile obtained by SDS\u2013PAGE analysis of fusion protein hydrolysis by PLpro. ISG15-AMC is a good substrate for PLpro, with k\ncat/K\nM of 602,000 M\u22121\n s\u22121. By comparison, the activity against Ub-AMC was 30-fold lower, with k\ncat/K\nM\n = 19,800 M\u22121\n s\u22121. PLpro is also able to hydrolyze Nedd8-AMC at an appreciable rate, with k\ncat/K\nM\n = 10,500 M\u22121\n s\u22121, a value 60-fold lower than that obtained with ISG15-AMC. Among the Ubls, Nedd8 displays the highest level of sequence identity to Ub (\u223c60%), and features a C-terminal sequence (LALRGG) that is similar to the one of Ub and ISG15 (LRLRGG). Activity against SUMO1-AMC, which has a different C-terminal sequence (QEQTGG), was another three orders of magnitude lower (k\ncat/K\nM\n = 14 M\u22121\n s\u22121), which agrees with the strict requirement of SARS-CoV PLpro for a LXGG sequence at the N-terminal side of the scissile bond [18]. In contrast to PLpro, USP5 and UCH-L3 are very specific for Ub-AMC, displaying more than three (USP5) and four (UCH-L3) orders of magnitude preference for Ub-AMC over ISG15-AMC (Fig. 3). UCH-L3 is also able to efficiently hydrolyze Nedd8-AMC, in agreement with its reported dual specificity for Ub- and Nedd8-conjugated proteins [23].",

Removal of the N-terminal ubiquitin-like domain of ISG15-AMC, to generate ISG15(C)-AMC, reduces the activity of PLpro 6-fold (from a k\ncat/K\nM of 602,000 M\u22121\n s\u22121 to 94,000 M\u22121\n s\u22121), while it remains still 5-fold higher than against Ub-AMC (k\ncat/K\nM\n = 19,800 M\u22121\n s\u22121). This indicates that part of the selectivity for ISG15 resides in the C-terminal Ub fold of ISG15, and that the N-terminus contributes to this property as well. This could be due to specific interactions between the ISG15(N) domain and the enzyme, and/or reflect interactions between the two ISG15 domains stabilizing a particular conformation of ISG15, as exemplified by the crystal structure of ISG15 [9]. The latter alternative is consistent with the observation that SARS-CoV PLpro activity against the hybrid molecule ISG15(N)-Ub-AMC (k\ncat/K\nM\n = 24,800 M\u22121\n s\u22121) and Ub-AMC are very similar.",

However, for both enzymes the activity against the hybrid molecule was still over two orders of magnitude higher than against both ISG15-AMC and its truncation, ISG15(C)-AMC. This indicates that the presence of the Ub domain, both in the context of Ub-AMC and ISG15(N)-Ub-AMC, is a major specificity determinant for USP5 and UCH-L3.

USP5, which acts on both linkage types [24], [25], was used as a positive control. As expected, SDS\u2013PAGE analysis (Fig. 4\n) shows that USP5 debranches both types of Ub2\u20137 chains, only leaving, besides monoubiquitin, detectable amounts of Ub2 and Ub3 species (lanes 4 and 7). PLpro, however, did not significantly process Lys63-linked polyubiquitin chains (lane 6). Nevertheless, a small amount of monoubiquitin could be detected, but it is not clear from the gel from which of the higher Ub-polymers it had been liberated. As previously observed with P-PLpro(C2)-His6 [7], Lys48-linked polyubiquitin chains were hydrolyzed by PLpro, generating mainly Ub2 as well as smaller amounts of monoubiquitin (lane 3). Incubation of PLpro with Lys48-linked Ub4 at the same concentrations of substrate (200 nM) and enzyme (20 nM) as in the Ubl fusion protein cleavage assay described above, led to the rapid appearance of Ub2 with 50% conversion after 5 min (data not shown), suggesting that this debranching reaction occurred at rates superior even to ISG15 precursor processing.",

The enzyme\u2019s specificity profile, outlined in our study, shows marked differences with the corresponding profiles for USP5 and UCH-L3. Overall, PLpro displays a broader specificity profile than the two other DUBs, with a preference for ISG15. This preference originates both from interaction with the C-terminal ubiquitin-like domain of ISG15, and from recognition of an additional, likely conformational feature in the context of the complete two-domain ISG15. The absence of a crystal structure or a relevant structural model of an ISG15-PLpro complex makes it difficult to delineate the molecular basis of the Ubl specificity of the PLpro. Available crystal structures for a number of Ub-USP adducts [14], [15], [16] reveal that the \u03b2-grasp fold of Ub interacts with the Zn-ribbon domain characteristic of the USP family of DUBs. A similar interaction has been postulated for PLpro [8], [13], [18].

While viral strategies to take advantage of protein ubiquitination are well documented [26], viral interactions with deubiquitination are also increasingly reported. Several new enzymes from viruses and bacteria, able to deubiquitinated substrates in vitro, have been identified in the last few years [27], [28]. As discussed recently by Catic et al. [28], it remains to be shown if these enzymes truly act as deubiquitinating enzymes in vivo. The involvement of SARS-CoV PLpro in viral polyprotein processing is well established. Deubiquitination of host substrate(s) in the context of a SARS-CoV infection, however, remains to be demonstrated. The observed in vitro activity against Ubl derivatives suggests that the SARS coronavirus could benefit from the deubiquitinating activity of PLpro through deconjugation of ISGylated proteins, or through polyubiquitin deconjugation, leading to protection of host and/or viral proteins from degradation [6], [7]. In the present study, we have shown that the SARS-CoV PLpro displays a broader specificity profile than USP5 and UCH-L3, indicating that the enzyme is more promiscuous than these host (human) DUBs. Activity of the PLpro against Ubl derivatives in vitro may therefore be a reflection of this broader specificity. In vivo, however, the SARS-CoV PLpro is part of nsp3 localized to the membrane-bound viral replicase complex [29]. Although we previously reported PLpro mediated cleavage of an ISG15-nsp2 fusion protein in a cell-based assay [7], we could not detect any clear decrease in ubiquitinated or ISGylated proteins using anti-Ub and anti-ISG15 Western blotting of cell lysates incubated with purified PLpro (data not shown). Therefore, as an isopeptidase, PLpro may exhibit more restricted substrate specificity. PLpro may also act on modified viral proteins that require its confined membrane localization as part of the replication complex. Identification of putative PLpro deubiquitination substrates during virus infection will require a more extensive, proteome-wide, approach.",

The substrates used are ISG15-AMC (black), Ub-AMC (gray), Nedd8-AMC (white), ISG15(C)-AMC (horizontal lines) and ISG15(N)-Ub-AMC (crosshair).",

Lys48-linked Ub2-7 (lanes 2\u20134) and Lys63-linked Ub2-7 (lanes 5\u20137) were incubated for 2 h at 37 \u00b0C with PLpro (lanes 3 and 6) or USP5 (lanes 4 and 7). Enzymes and substrates were present at 8 \u03bcg/mL and 200 \u03bcg/mL, respectively. Proteins were resolved by a 10% SDS\u2013PAGE and revealed by Coomassie blue staining. The molecular weights of the marker proteins are indicated on the left of the gel (in kDa). Arrowheads indicate the positions of PLpro and USP5.",
