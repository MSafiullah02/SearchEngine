MERS-CoV has since spread to different countries in the Middle East and other regions, with 2519 laboratory-confirmed cases of MERS-CoV infection, including 866 deaths in 27 countries, reported by Jan 31, 2020.2 MERS-CoV poses a major threat to public health security because of its epidemic potential and absence of currently available effective countermeasures, and it has been listed as a priority pathogen for research and development by WHO and other health agencies around the globe. Dromedary camels are now a recognised source of zoonotic infections, and occupational exposure has been associated with seroconversion,3 although only 40% of primary cases have been associated with direct camel exposure.4 Human-to-human transmission, especially in hospital environments, has been responsible for the majority of cases seen in outbreaks in the past 7 years.5 However, no sustained human-to-human transmission has been recorded so far (overall R0<1), and the role of asymptomatic or mild cases in transmission patterns remains controversial and unclear. No specific treatment options or licensed vaccines are currently available.",

A fourth of their genome is responsible for coding structural proteins, such as the spike glycoprotein, and envelope, membrane, and nucleocapsid proteins. Envelope, membrane, and nucleocapsid proteins are mainly responsible for virion assembly, whereas the spike glycoprotein is involved in receptor binding, mediating virus entry into host cells during infection via different receptors.7 MERS-CoV belongs to the phylogenetic lineage C of the genus Betacoronavirus, and it recognises the dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP4) host receptor, which is well conserved between camels and humans.8 It is the sixth coronavirus known to cause human infections and the first human virus within lineage C. Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV), which was responsible for the 2002\u201303 SARS global epidemic and SARS coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), which is responsible for the current pandemic, belong to lineage B (genus Betacoronavirus). HCoV-OC43 and HCoV-HKU1 are representatives of lineage A (genus Betacoronavirus), whereas HCoV-229E and HCoV-NL63 belong to the genus Alphacoronavirus. HCoV-OC43, HCoV-HKU1, HCoV-229E, and HCoV-NL63 are globally distributed and generally associated with mild respiratory symptoms, accounting for up to a third of all common cold cases.9\n",

Preclinical work has shown that the vaccine is highly immunogenic in animal models, being able to induce both cellular and humoral responses (polyfunctional CD8 T cells and neutralising antibodies).13 A single dose of ChAdOx1 MERS also conferred protective efficacy in transgenic mice expressing human DPP4 against a lethal MERS-CoV challenge, which supported progression into clinical development.14 Immunogenicity and partial protective efficacy in a natural transmission model in dromedary camels have also been reported.15 We aimed to assess the safety and immunogenicity of the ChAdOx1 MERS candidate MERS-CoV vaccine in humans.",

The coated plates were washed six times with phosphate buffered saline-Tween and then blocked with casein for 1 h at room temperature. Plasma samples diluted to fall within the linear range of the curve (typically 1/500 in casein) were then added to individual wells on the plates. This step was followed by incubation of the plates at room temperature for 2 h and washing of the plates, as initially described. The plates were then incubated at room temperature for 1 h with a secondary antibody, alkaline phosphatase-conjugated goat anti-human IgG (\u03b3-chain specific). After a final wash, plates were developed by adding 4-nitrophenyl phosphate in diethanolamine substrate buffer (Fisher Scientific UK, Loughborough, UK). The standard curve used on each plate was derived from a pool of volunteers' sera containing high-titre anti-MERS IgG. Endpoint titre determined by ELISA was used to identify the volunteer samples with the highest anti-MERS IgG titres after vaccination. A 1/100 dilution of the standard pool was used in a two-fold serial dilution to produce ten standard points that were assigned arbitrary ELISA units. The optical density values of the standard points were fitted to a four-parameter hyperbolic curve against the arbitrary ELISA units using GEN5 software (version 3.04; BioTek Instruments, Winooski, VT, USA), and the parameters estimated from the standard curve were used to convert absorbance values of individual test samples into ELISA units. Each ELISA plate consists of the samples and internal positive control (1/800 dilution of the standard pool, corresponding to standard 4) in triplicates, ten standard points in duplicates, and four blank wells. The optical density reading of the plates at 405 nm was done with an ELx808 microplate reader (BioTek Instruments).",

Antibody responses peaked at day 28, with the high-dose group producing the highest antibody response (figure 2B). IgG titres increased significantly at day 28 and day 56 after vaccination with increasing ChAdOx1 MERS dose compared with baseline (figure 2B; appendix p 8), and no significant differences in anti-MERS IgG was found between the dose groups at these timepoints (data not shown). Detectable anti-MERS IgG titres were observed in four (17%) of 24 participants at baseline. However, this baseline response did not inhibit the antibody responses to the vaccine, as evident by the increased IgG titres observed for these participants at day 28 and day 56 after vaccination (appendix p 9).",

Between 71% and 79% of all participants produced neutralising antibodies in assays using pseudotyped lentiviruses expressing the spike glycoprotein from three different strains of MERS-CoV. Despite differences in methodology, there was a strong positive correlation between neutralising antibodies from pseudotyped viruses and neutralising antibodies obtained from the live virus assay in the high-dose group. Strategies to increase neutralising antibody seroconversion include a two-dose regimen, and investigations for this hypothesis are underway. Importantly, in MERS survivors CD8 T-cell responses were found to correlate with less severe disease and lower virus shedding.31 ChAdOx1 MERS vaccination resulted in significant increases in MERS spike-specific T-cell responses that were maintained for at least a year after vaccination at four times higher than baseline. Adenoviral vectored vaccines are potent inducers of CD8 T-cell responses, and the phenotype of T cells induced by vaccination will be determined in further studies.",

Target groups include people who are occupationally exposed to camels and health-care workers. However, severe and fatal cases of MERS-CoV disproportionally affect individuals older than 50 years and those with comorbidities. Therefore, it is paramount that vaccines developed against MERS-CoV are suitable for administration in older age groups in the context of an outbreak. The use of replication-deficient vectors avoids the risks of inadequate attenuation of replication-competent vaccines, which could potentially lead to disseminated disease in immunocompromised hosts. Immunogenicity of a ChAdOx1 vectored vaccine against influenza has been demonstrated in older adults (50\u201378 years of age).20 For use in outbreaks, rapid onset of immunity after a single dose, as demonstrated here, is highly desirable.",
