This is because we need to use the CT suites for the next patients as soon as possible. Nakajima et al. reported that CT examinations on the patients with COVID-19 confirmed or suspected were performed at the end of the daily CT schedule [1] . Therefore, we estimate that their interval time may be approximately less than 12-18 h from scanning the patients with COVID-19 infection confirmed or suspected to scanning the next patient. The National Institutes of Health (NIH) reported that novel coronavirus was detectable in aerosols for up to 3 h, up to 24 h on cardboard and up to 2-3 days on plastic and stainless steel [4] . Since unfortunately, our CT suites do not include a negative pressure ventilation system, we may need to take much longer intervals in our clinical practice. If we are to use CT for rapidly increasing patients with COVID-19 infection confirmed or suspected, we presume that CT operating times, as well as numbers of patients that can be scanned, will markedly reduce due to the extensive time spent on cleaning CT suites. In the worst-case scenario, healthcare using CT may collapse in our hospital.",
