In bone marrow, FLT3L acts on MDP and/or CDP and activates different transcription factor cascades to give rise to different DC subsets in a steady state (Poltorak and Schraml 2015). Granulocyte-macrophage colony stimulating factor (GM-CSF) is the other important growth factor for DCs development. Although GM-CSF does not have a major role such as FLT3L in DC development, it seems to balance DC subsets. For example, GM-CSF decreases pDCs and CD8\u03b1+ DC differentiation by blocking interferon regulatory factor-8 (IRF8) via signal transducer and activator of transcription-5 (STAT5) (Zhan et al. 2012a).",

            "text": "Brucella evades the innate immune response, impairing DC maturation and subverting macrophage and neutrophil killing; indeed, Brucella resists and survives the bactericidal actions of neutrophils but does not replicate inside these cells (Barquero-Calvo et al. 2007). At the initial stage of infection, Brucella induces an adaptive immune response involving the microbicidal activity of macrophages (activated by IFN-\u03b3 of CD8+ and CD4+ T cells), and then infected macrophages are eliminated by cytotoxic T cells, and Brucella opsonization/phagocytosis is induced by IgG antibodies (Ahmed et al. 2016). In the case of chronic brucellosis, CD4+ and CD25+ T cells increase in the spleens of infected mice, which exert an immunosuppressive state regulating T cell activity. In patients with chronic brucellosis, high levels of TGF-\u03b2 have been found in their sera, and furthermore, no T cell proliferation after stimulation with Brucella antigens has been observed, indicating suppressed T cell function mediated by TGF-\u03b2 (Elfaki and Al-Hokail 2009). The chronicity of brucellosis is due to Brucella\u2019s ability to survive inside professional phagocytic cells and to evade the host immune response. Brucella can infect different cell types, including epithelial cells, trophoblasts, B cells, DCs, macrophages, synoviocytes, and T cells (Baldwin and Goenka 2006; Giambartolomei et al. 2017; Goenka et al. 2012; Vel\u00e1squez et al. 2012). Brucella persistence occurs in mononuclear phagocytic system tissues, but the bacteria can also be found in reproductive organs, bones, and joints (Ahmed et al. 2016). Once infection is established, Brucella uses infected cells as a replicative niche and reservoir, inhibiting apoptosis and promoting chronic infection (Baldwin and Goenka 2006). Omp31 from B. melitensis contributes to the apoptosis inhibition induced by TNF\u03b1 in RAW264.7 macrophages by the classical and mitochondrial pathway (Zhang et al. 2016), while B. abortus induces the A20 protein in RAW264.7 macrophages and promotes apoptotic pathway inhibition (Wei et al. 2015).",

Susceptible IL-12p40 KO (Knock out)-mice infected intranasally with B. melitensis showed spleen infection after 28 days postinoculation. The bacteria were located in T cells on the white pulp of the spleen, and the main cells harboring Brucellae were cells resembling M2a macrophages. These reservoir cells infected with Brucella expressed CD11c+, CD205+, and Arg1+; these markers were observed also in lung cells infected with Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Hanot Mambres et al. 2015). The deficient Th1 response in KO mice favoring the differentiation of the M2a macrophages population is indicative of a Th2 environment. Previously, Xavier et al. found that M2a macrophages were induced during chronic infection provoked by B. abortus; interestingly, macrophages containing high numbers of bacteria were observed (Xavier et al. 2013). Because M2a macrophage polarization is induced by IL-4/IL-13 via STAT6, bacterial colonization in the spleen and impairment of M2a macrophage surface markers in double KO mice (IL-12p40\u2212/\u2212 STAT6\u2212/\u2212) were expected. However, Hanot-Mambres et al. found that neither Brucella infection in IL-12p40\u2212/\u2212 STAT6\u2212/\u2212 mice nor the surface markers expressed in macrophages were affected. Based on the observations of Xavier et al. and Hanot-Mambres et al., it is probable that myeloid cells are the critical reservoir in the spleen that may promote chronicity during brucellosis.",

In the acute phase (from the third day to the second\u2013third week postinfection) the number of bacteria increases in the organs, and cell infiltration is apparent. In the liver, granulomas are evident in the first week after infection; granulomas are composed of macrophages and DCs, accompanied by plasma cells and lymphocytes (de Figueiredo et al. 2015; Grill\u00f3 et al. 2012; Yoneyama and Ichida 2005). The spleen in the acute phase, after the first week of infection, shows increased size with macrophage and neutrophil infiltration, while the bacterial burden remains constant (Enright et al. 1990). At the end of the acute phase, the numbers of macrophages, neutrophils, and B and T cells increase slightly, as well as levels of IL-12, IL-6, and IFN\u03b3 (Grill\u00f3 et al. 2012; Murphy et al. 2001). In the chronic phase (ranging from 8 to 11 weeks postinfection), granuloma size in the liver increases, and multinucleated giant cells and polykarions are observed in the centers of the granulomas (Cheville et al. 1995). Similarly, granuloma number and size in the spleen increase. The initial chronic brucellosis phase starts around the second\u2013third week, and bacterial burden slowly decreases at approximately 75 days postinfection. Moreover, splenomegaly decreases, and macrophage infiltration is reduced (Enright et al. 1990; Grill\u00f3 et al. 2012); however, the liver shows clearance at approximately 3\u20134 weeks postinfection, whereas the spleen is highly colonized during the chronic stage (Grill\u00f3 et al. 2012).",

The authors demonstrated that B. melitensis modulates inflammatory responses, limiting intestinal histopathological lesions, invading Peyer\u2019s patches, and disseminating to the mesenteric lymph nodes to induce bacteremia (Rossetti et al. 2013). Likely, Brucella translocates through the mucosal epithelium and is taken up by the DC subset present in the subepithelial dome of the ileal Peyer\u2019s patch. This DC subset secretes high levels of lysozyme (termed LysoDCs) and is highly efficient at capturing Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium (hereafter referred as S. typhimurium) (Lelouard et al. 2010, 2012); however, further investigation is needed to clarify whether LysoDCs are involved in Brucella uptake.",

CLNs drain the oral cavity, and most of the bacteria acquired by the oral route reach this regional lymph node (von Bargen et al. 2015; Yamazaki et al. 2012). Upon arrival at the CLNs, bacteria are captured or disseminated. Therefore, CLNs represent an efficient trap and reservoir for pathogens able to cause chronic infections, and the tissues drained by CNLs are the most successful route of entry to the host for pathogens acquired orally. As mentioned above, ingestion of unpasteurized contaminated dairy products is the most common route by which people acquire Brucella infection; however, it has been demonstrated experimentally that this is not the most efficient route since the bacterial burden required to infect mouse ranges from 109 to 1011 CFU. In infections caused by pathogens transmitted via the oral route, regional lymphadenitis is more common than diarrhea, indicating that the upper mucosa is the normal site of entry for these pathogens instead of the gastrointestinal tract. Taking into consideration these observations, it has been proposed that Brucella is not a proper enteropathogen (Gorvel et al. 2009; von Bargen et al. 2015).",

Intranasal infection of mice with S. typhimurium increases the percentage of DCs located at the submucosa level, whereas intraepithelial DCs decrease. However, both of these DC subsets upregulate the expression of costimulatory molecules such as CD80 and CD86, indicating clear activation of the immune system in the lung. Since Brucella is considered highly infectious, the inhalation of Brucella aerosols from aborted placenta or through laboratory exposures also leads to infection. In the case of the intranasal route, mice inoculated intranasally with 5 \u00d7 105B. abortus 2308 were compared with a group of mice infected with S. typhimurium. The results showed that pulmonary B. abortus infection did not change the distribution of pulmonary DC subsets in the lung nor upregulate the expression of costimulatory molecules from 24 h up to 5 days postinfection (onset to acute infection) (Archambaud et al. 2010; del Rio et al. 2010; Smither et al. 2009; Traxler et al. 2013; Vermaelen and Pauwels 2005).",

            "text": "Another common route for Brucella infection in humans and animals linked to bacterial aerosols is the conjunctival route. Although the eye is considered an immune-privileged organ, a subset of immature and mature DCs were found in the human and mouse cornea, at the epithelium and stromal zone. At the normal cornea, cDCs and Langerhans DCs have been observed: CD141+ (cDC1) and CD1c+ (cDC2) in humans and CD103+ (cDC1) and CD11b+ (cDC2) in mice (Knickelbein et al. 2009, 2014). However, it is not clear which DC subset is involved in Brucella infection. Although the conjunctiva is a less common route of natural infection with Brucella, this route has been used for vaccination to control caprine and ovine brucellosis, employing a B. melitensis Rev. 1 live vaccine (Blasco 1997). The conjunctiva is related to the conjunctiva-associated lymphoid tissue (CALT); an interconnection in the mucosal system allowing a distal immune mucosal response when the local mucosa is stimulated has been demonstrated, and M cells might be involved in the translocation of antigens (Pulendran and Ahmed 2011). For example, when sheep were infected by the conjunctival route with 5 \u00d7 107 CFU of virulent B. melitensis H38, the animals developed acute systemic brucellosis located in the peripheral lymph nodes but eradicated the bacteria at the local site of inoculation (Suraud et al. 2008).",

A large number of studies have focused on these Brucella species and their interactions with the host due to the importance, incidence/frequency, and virulence of infection. Compared with the three species mentioned above, B. canis and B. ovis are the only two natural rough Brucella species that infect their animal host. B. canis, with a lower incidence of human cases, also represents a public health risk; however, until now, no studies examining its interaction with DCs have been reported (Marzetti et al. 2013). In humans, B. canis causes a mild or asymptomatic infection, whereas in dogs, like other animals, brucellosis induces abortion in females and epididymitis/orchitis in males, as well as some complications such as diskospondylitis (Wanke 2004). It is possible that differences in human and canine brucellosis may be attributed to differences in the immune response. When infected with B. canis, human and canine GM-DCs upregulate the expression of CD86, CD83, and class II molecules 24-h postinfection. On the other hand, cytokine gene profile expression differs: while canine GM-DCs overexpress IL-17A, IL-6, IFN\u03b3, IL-12p35, human GM-DCs overexpress IL-12p35, TNF\u03b1, and IL-1\u03b2. At the protein level, the cytokine profiles are very similar; high production of INF\u03b3 and IL-17A in canine GM-DCs and IL-12 and TNF\u03b1 in human GM-DCs. Clearly, B. canis elicits a Th1 response in human GM-DCs that is essential for the pathogen eradication, and this is likely the reason symptoms in humans are less severe. GM-DCs infected with B. canis, elicit a Th1/Th17 cytokine profile (Pujol et al. 2017). The role of the Th17 response in brucellosis is not clear yet; IL-17 has been implicated in osteoarticular complications in brucellosis. Additionally, Th17 cells producing IFN\u03b3/IL-17 are related to inflammatory disorders (Giambartolomei et al. 2017). Another intracellular pathogen, M. tuberculosis induces a combined Th1/Th17 response and the formation of granulomas (Bystrom et al. 2015; Lyadova and Panteleev 2015). It is likely that the IFN\u03b3/IL-17 cytokine profile elicited by B. canis in canine DCs is associated with osteoarticular complications in dogs such as diskospondylitis.",

Human monocyte-derived GM-DCs infected with smooth B. suis or B. abortus decreased the expression of maturation surface markers (chemokine receptor CCR7, CD83), costimulatory molecules (CD86, CD40), and MHC-II relative to GM-DCs infected with rough mutants. Moreover, Brucella infection decreased Ag presentation, as well as the production of the inflammatory cytokines IL-12 and TNF\u03b1 (Billard et al. 2007b). TNF\u03b1 is essential for DC maturation; in a previous report, B. suis Omp25 impaired TNF\u03b1 production on THP-1 monocytes (Jubier-Maurin et al. 2001). Recently, it was demonstrated that B. suis Omp25 dysregulates microRNA expression on porcine alveolar and murine macrophages, leading to the inhibition of NF-\u03baB signaling and TNF\u03b1 suppression (Billard et al. 2007b; Luo et al. 2018). The decrease in inflammatory cytokines and the poor T cell stimulation of Brucella-infected GM-DCs avert the induction of a Th1 immune response, which is essential for eradicating intracellular bacteria (Billard et al. 2007b).",

Although these bacterial pathogens have an intracellular lifestyle, they have different preferential niches for their replication; while B. abortus 2308 and C. burnetii reside in an intracellular vacuole, O. tsutsugamuchi is located in the cytoplasm (Benoit et al. 2008; Gorvel et al. 2014; Tantibhedhyangkul et al. 2013). Gorvel et al. (2014) infected GM-DCs with B. abortus 2308, C. burnetii, and O. tsutsugamuchi for 24 h. Compared with GM-DCs infected with C. burnettii or O. tsutsugamushi, B. abortus-infected GM-DCs showed impaired immune responses. However, the expression of CD83 (a DC maturation marker), and costimulatory molecules (CD80 and CD86) was relatively higher in O. tsutsugamushi-infected GM-DCs, than B. abortus 2308- and C. burnetii-infected cells (Gorvel et al. 2014). Despite the intracellular lifestyle of these pathogens, notable differences in GM-DC immune responses were observed; further analysis involving transcriptomics was performed on infected GM-DCs. Transcriptomic analysis revealed high levels of IFN-\u03b2 in GM-DCs infected with O. tsutsugamushi, whereas IFN-\u03b2 expression was impaired in Brucella- and C. burnetti-infected GM-DCs. According to the results obtained, IFN type I was impaired due to defective activation of p38 in GM-DCs infected with B. abortus 2308 and C. burnetii (Gorvel et al. 2014).",

Bone marrow cells were differentiated in GM-DCs, FL-DCs (pDCs, and CD8\u03b1+, and CD11b+ equivalent to cDCs), GM/FL-DCs (GM-CSF plus FLT3L DCs), and GM/15-DCs (GM-CFS plus IL-15 DCs) and then infected with virulent B. abortus 2308 strain. In the case of GM/FL-DCs, GM-CSF decreased CD8\u03b1+ DCs and pDCs, while CD11b+ DCs increased these subsets. On the other hand, GM/15-DCs produced higher levels of IFN\u03b3 and IL-12 (promoting Th1 response) than GM-DCs (Brasel et al. 2000; Naik et al. 2005; Papadopoulos et al. 2016). When DC subsets were infected with Brucella, different infection kinetics were observed; for example, FL-DCs and GM/15-DCs showed higher infection levels at early time points than GM/FL-DC or GM-DCs. Brasel et al. (2000) observed the similar efficiency of FL-DCs and GM-DCs for ovalbumin (OVA) uptake; however, Brucella uptake may be mediated by different mechanisms (i.e., lipid rafts and/or phagocytosis). At late times postinfection, Brucella uptake levels were similar in all different DC subsets. On the other hand, GM-DCs and GM/FL-DCs showed late maturation (high levels of CD86, CD80, and MHC-II at 48 h), while GM/15-DCs and FL-DCs (only CD8\u03b1+ and CD11b+ DCs) showed early maturation at 24-h postinfection. GM-DCs and GM/FL-DCs induced high levels of IL-10 corresponding to late maturation of cells. FL-DCs and GM/15-DCs showed higher expression of INF\u03b3, IL-12, IL-6, IFN\u03b2, and IL-1\u03b2 as well as higher levels of chemokine and chemokine receptor (CCL2 and CCR7) corresponding to early maturation. Moreover, in DC subsets with inflammatory cytokine profiles, Brucella replication was lower than that in GM-DCs and GM/FL-DCs (Papadopoulos et al. 2016).",

In this sense, DCs, CD4+ T cells, and macrophages from the spleen are the main IL-10 producers (Corsetti et al. 2013). IL-10 is considered an immunoregulatory cytokine that is able to suppress IL-12 production and modulate an excessive Th1 response (Couper et al. 2008). During Brucella infection, IL-10 production at early times is crucial for evolution to chronic brucellosis, which includes the inhibition of pro-inflammatory cytokines. Xavier et al. (2013) found that at early times during Brucella infection, IL-10 produced by CD4+CD25+ T cells has a regulatory effect during the acute phase, which decreases inflammation and tissue damage; this immune response protects bacteria from being eliminated. Valuable data were obtained in experiments using IL-10 KO mice infected with B. abortus. IL-10 KO mice showed lower bacterial loads than wild-type mice. Additionally, GM-DCs from IL-10 KO mice produced higher levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines than GM-DCs from wild-type mice. Altogether, these results indicate that IL-10 has a detrimental effect on the protective immune response against Brucella (Couper et al. 2008); Xavier et al. 2013).",

Typical LPS is composed of lipid A, a core oligosaccharide, and an O-side chain polysaccharide. Brucella LPS is an unbranched homopolymer ranging from 96 to 100 glycosyl subunits; the O-side chain is linked to a core oligosaccharide, and the lipid A is linked to the core oligosaccharide (Cardoso et al. 2006). LPS plays an important role in Brucella pathogenesis, protecting from cellular cationic peptides, reactive oxygen species, and complement-mediated lysis and is involved in invasion. Brucella LPS is less cytotoxic than enterobacterial LPS (Cardoso et al. 2006; von Bargen et al. 2012). There is some controversy as to whether or not Brucella LPS hampers the DC immune response; as mentioned above, some authors have reported DC maturation/activation inhibition by smooth Brucella strains, whereas DCs infected with rough strains showed maturation/activation and proinflammatory cytokine profiles.",

The B. abortus wadC mutant exhibited a partially defective core oligosaccharide but an intact lipid A and O-side chain. bmGM-DCs were stimulated with LPS purified from the wadC mutant and wild-type strain. The mutant LPS induced higher production of IL-12, TNF\u03b1, and CD86 and MHC-II overexpression, but cells stimulated with the wild-type LPS did not (Conde-\u00c1lvarez et al. 2012). Similar experiments were performed by Zhao et al. (2018) using human monocyte-derived GM-DCs stimulated with B. melitensis-wadC mutant LPS and wild type LPS, the production of IL-12p70, IL-6, and TNF\u03b1 was observed only in cells stimulated with mutant LPS (Zhao et al. 2018).",

It has been reported that the O-side chains of LPS from B. melitensis 16M, B. abortus 2308, and B. suis 1330 are able to restrict the activation of p38 in murine J774A.1 macrophages. Additionally, the production of inflammatory cytokines and chemokines depends on p38 MAPKs (Jim\u00e9nez de Bag\u00fc\u00e9s et al. 2005).

TIRAP is an adaptor molecule for the MyD88-dependent pathway derived from TLR2 and TLR4-signaling (Kawai and Akira 2007; Underhill and Ozinsky 2002). Radhakrishnan et al. (2009) observed no interaction between BtpA, TLR2, TLR4, or TIRAP to inhibit NF-kB activation in HEK293 cells transfected with the btpA gene. Interestingly, BtpA was found to mimic TIRAP function during TLRs signaling; BtpA likely competes with MyD88 and blocks downstream signaling (Radhakrishnan et al. 2009). On the other hand, recombinant BtpA was able to induce the degradation of TIRAP, while other TLR components were not affected. It has been suggested that the interaction of BtpA and TIRAP facilitates the ubiquitination of TIRAP for its degradation (Fig. 1) (Sengupta et al. 2010).",

Some differences were observed between BtpA and BtpB; for example, BtpA, but not BtpB impaired TNF\u03b1 production, while BtpB decreased the expression of MHC-II, CD40, CD86, and CD80 in bmGM-DC cells. However, both proteins contributed to the control of DC activation during Brucella infection (Salcedo et al. 2013).

A high percentage of the studies to examine Brucella pathogenesis, host-pathogen interaction, virulence, etc., are performed in macrophages, and in some cases, these cells are the preferential niche for intracellular replication. However, there is no doubt that DCs are an intracellular niche for Brucella species, and their migratory properties allow bacterial dissemination. With the exception of bovine-derived DCs, this pathogen infects and replicates inside DCs. Brucella recognition at the outside of the eukaryotic cell is mediated by TLRs and signaling triggers the immune response, as shown by cytokine production. Despite discrepancies regarding DC activation/maturation after Brucella infection, it is clear that Brucella infection is detected by murine or human GM-DCs since the bacteria drive low pro-inflammatory cytokine levels. Unlike other intracellular pathogens such as Salmonella, which induces high levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines and the expression of activation/maturation surface molecules, Brucella is able to subvert or \u201cdelay\u201d the DC response, impairing the inflammatory response or the expression of surface molecules. At later times postinfection, Brucella exerts immunomodulatory mechanisms to avoid a protective immune response, promoting intracellular trafficking and reaching its intracellular niche by blocking TLR signaling and cytokine production.",

In part, this contradiction is due to a large number of variables that are managed in experiments using DCs, for example, the bacterial strains used, the bacterial dose and the time for infection/stimulation. It is impossible to homogenize all methodologies, since one DC subset cannot be used because, as we have emphasized in this review, there are several DC phenotypes. On the other hand, the genetic variation of Brucella strains, even though the same bacterial species are used, including references or clinical isolated strains, may affect the results. Similarly, it is impossible to control the physiological and genetic variations of the animals and donors used to obtain DCs. Undeniably, the nature of the stimulus used causes variations in the results, since stimulation performed with a purified protein, purified LPS, heat-killed bacteria or a live mutant strain is not the same. For example, in the case of subunit stimuli, although they are fundamentally important to determine the role of a specific macromolecule, they do not contain all elements encompassed by the whole bacterium and act together at the time of infection. However, some variables can be controlled, such as the dose and time of infection/stimulation with Brucella or Brucella antigens, the time of DC subset differentiation, the strain and the age of the animals used.",
