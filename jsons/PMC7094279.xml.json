            "text": "As an increasing number of people are traveling by air, the exposure risk of infectious diseases in aircraft cabins has become an important public health issue [1]. Most modern aircrafts have high-efficiency particulate air (HEPA-type) filter in their ventilation recirculation systems, which can remove more than 99.9% of the pathogen particles produced by the passengers [2]. However, these pathogen particles can spread in the cabin air before being removed by the HEPA filters. The worldwide spread of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) [3] and tuberculosis (TB) [1] further indicates that the transmission of infectious diseases through airflow inside aircrafts is a key factor for passenger exposure risk. The present standards [4], [5] in commercial aircrafts provide ventilation and contaminant requirements based on the comfort of passengers. For example, ASHRAE [4] recommends a minimum air supply of 9.4 L/s per person and required the in-flight ozone concentration shall not exceed 0.25 ppm at any time. However, they do not consider the effects of airflow patterns on airborne contaminant transport. Therefore, it is important to study how aircraft cabin air flow patterns affect the transmission of airborne contaminants in the aircraft cabin to optimize the ventilation system and control the spread of infectious diseases.",

These previous studies contribute to our understanding of airborne contaminant transmission inside aircraft cabins. They found contaminants released at points farther from the cabin exhausts had a wider spread than those released close to the exhausts, lateral dispersion in the middle injection case was more rapid than that in the side injection case due to the center mixing zone, and droplets were more likely to travel backward because of the thermal plume from infected passengers. However, they primarily focused on qualitative analysis of the bulk airflow patterns and did not consider the impact of fine airflow structures on the transmission of airborne contaminants. Recently, Li et al. [7] studied the effect of different contaminant sources and found that in the narrow cabin space, a small different (10 cm) in the source locations can result in a significant difference in contaminant fields. This indicated the fine and complex airflow structure was an important factor in determining airborne contaminant distributions.",

Then, we introduce vortex structure analysis, which is a technique commonly used in studies on oceanic transmission, into the cabin environment. For example, Okubo [8] classified the two-dimensional velocity field into five parts by the roots of the characteristic equation and found that particles in different parts displayed different dispersion performances. Provenzale [9] reviewed the transmission properties of coherent vortices in rotating barotropic flows and reported that \u201cpassive tracers can be trapped inside vortex cores for long times and are transported by the vortex motion over large distances\u201d. Isern-Fontanet et al. [10] used a common definition of a coherent structure [8], [11] to investigate the statistical vortex properties of the Mediterranean Sea. They considered this definition appropriate to identify the characteristic of vortex structure, such as size, amplitude and mean kinetic energy.",

In contrast to source 2, the contaminants from source 1 and 3 can be transported to its respective upside, and the concentration above the seats is much higher (Fig. 5(a, d)). Using a path line as an indicator, the trajectory of the contaminant can be indicated more clearly. In this section, 20 massless particles [16] were released on each location, and their trajectories were got. The path lines from source 2 almost escaped from the cabin, and fewer path lines went back to the upsides (Fig. 5(c)). However, more path lines from source 1 and 3 were recirculated back to the upsides, which resulted in higher concentrations above the seats (Fig. 5(a,d)). This meant the region dominated by vorticity had a \u201clock\u201d function which could lock the contaminant inside and make it difficult to escape.",

A white line \u201cMN\u201d is drawn in the mouth front region dominated by deformation. On both sides of line MN, two vortexes were captured. Ten massless particles were released on each side respectively to get their path lines. Note that path lines are three dimensional and the two dimensional figure can only show their projections. Fig. 7 suggests if a contaminant source was on the left side of line MN, the contaminants were more likely transported forward, but if the source was on the right side of line MN, the contaminants went downward and did not cross line MN. From the lower part of Table. 2, it presents clearly that, comparing with the source position, the mean position of mouth source moves back, while the mean position of forward source moves forth.

            "text": "The aim of this study was to investigate how the vortex structures of airflow affect airborne contaminant transmission in an aircraft cabin. We employed an Okubo-Weiss parameter Q from fluid mechanics to identify the vortex structures. By setting the contaminant sources at locations with different vortex structures in the simulation and experiment in the 7-row cabin, we found that the fine airflow vortex structure has an important effect on airborne contaminant distributions.",

However, these locations should have similar relative distances to diffusers and exhausts. In the longitudinal section, different airflow vortex structures also resulted in different concentrations between the front and rear parts. The airflows close to the heated manikin\u2019s chest and face was more likely to move contaminants backward, while the airflows distanced to it was more likely to deliver contaminants forward. However, the trend for unheated manikins was uncertainty, because of low longitudinal velocity and Q value.",

The vortex structure analysis also can not only be applied in cabin environments, but also in another enclosed environments such as rail cabins and submarines. Further research on applications of more advanced numerical models and three-dimensional vortex structure analysis are needed.",
