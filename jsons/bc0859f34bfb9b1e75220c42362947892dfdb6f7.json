Unraveling a long-standing mystery of MIRR triggering and transmembrane signaling, the SCHOOL model reveals the intrareceptor transmembrane interactions and interreceptor cytoplasmic homointeractions as universal therapeutic targets for a diverse variety of disorders mediated by immune cells. Further, assuming that the general principles underlying MIRR-mediated transmembrane signaling mechanisms are similar, the SCHOOL model can be appHed to any particular receptor of the MIRR family. Thus, an important application of the SCHOOL model is that global therapeutic strategies targeting key protein-protein interactions involved in MIRR triggering and transmembrane signal transduction may be used to treat a diverse set of immune-mediated diseases. This assumes that clinical knowledge and therapeutic strategies can be transferred between seemingly disparate disorders, such as T-cell-mediated skin diseases and platelet disorders, or combined to develop novel pharmacological approaches.

Cytoplasmic homointeractions between MIRR signaling subunits. This is a simplified graphical illustration of the molecular mechanisms underlying proposed intervention by cytoplasm ic-targeted agents (peptides and their derivatives, small molecule disruptors of protein-protein interactions, etc) and site-specific mutations. Specific blockade of homointeractions between signaling subunits is proposed to prevent formation of signaling oligomers, thus inhibiting antigen-dependent immune cell activation (A). Within the model, in contrast to transmembrane-targeted agents (Target I,Fig. 2), stimulation of MIRRs with cross-linking antibodies to signaling subunit in the presence of cytoplasm ic-targeted agents should not result in receptor triggering and cell activation (B). The proposed cytoplasmic-targeted strategies can be used not only to inhibit but also to modulate MIRR-mediated transmembrane signal transduction, thus modulating the immune response (see main text for details).

Indirect evidence for importance of the proposed cytoplasmic-targeted strategy. A) Fas apoptosis signaling by a normal Fas receptor and the receptor with the Fas T225K mutation that naturally occurs in patients with the autoimmune lymphoproliferative syndrome (ALPS). In contrast to all other ALPS-associated Fas DD mutations, this pathogenic mutation specifically disrupts homooligomerization of the cytoplasmic tails of the receptor but retains the ability to interact with FADD [SiegelRM, Muppidi JR, Sarker M et al. SPOTS: signaling protein oligomeric transduction structures are early mediators of death receptor-induced apoptosis at the plasma membrane, j Cell Biol 2004; 167:735-744]. As shown, the blockade of the cytoplasmic homointeractions does not allow full caspase-8 activation and apoptosis induction, thus revealing these protein-protein interactions as a therapeutic target.

J Biol Chem 2005; 280:15809-15814], cell-permeable analogs of MyD88 peptides derived from the TIR domain of MyD88 as well as a synthetic peptidomimetic compound effectively inhibit homodimerization of MyD88 TIR domains, significantly reducing IL-1 signaling in vitro and dose-dependently inhibiting IL-ip-induced production of IL-6 in treated mice.
