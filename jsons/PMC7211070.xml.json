However, thus far, Taiwan has had 306 confirmed cases and ranked 73rd on the list of infected areas. With its previous experience of the severe acute respiratory syndrome epidemic in 2003, rapid response and quick implementation between government and private enterprise, Taiwan has been able to prevent a large-scale epidemic.2\n",

This demonstrates a fast response from the CDC to follow guidelines. However, clinicians have become exhausted and ordinary people overwhelmed. Dedicated phone lines for consultations about COVID-19 were jammed 24/7 with anxious people.",

It also provides instructions for quarantine regulations under selected circumstances, following Taiwan CDC guidelines. The system is designed to help both ordinary citizens and clinicians check the reporting criteria by themselves and decrease the need for consultation with the public health service. Users complete a questionnaire on the website regarding the patient\u2019s clinical symptoms, occupation, travel history, contact history, cluster history and chest imaging results if available (figure 1) and receive recommendations and further quarantine instructions if needed. The risk classification algorithm was developed with the cooperation of the Emergency Department of Chang Gung Memorial Hospital and the Computer Science Department of Sun Yat-sen University.",
