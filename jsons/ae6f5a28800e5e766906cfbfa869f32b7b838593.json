Fortunately, all patients encountered (a total of 225,569 out-patient attendances and 10,819 in-patient admissions), and all our 3178 staffs have remained free from COVID-19 contraction. 5 For Clinical Oncology Center, we strived to maintain our services (Fig. 2B) . We did not reduce the quota for out-patient appointments, but we encouraged follow-up patients without active diseases to postpone the appointment unless continuation of drug supply is needed, hence the total number of out-patient attendances decreased by 3.7%. For in-patient services, more patients actually requested admission for treatment to minimize the risk incurred by frequent travelling, hence the total number of in-patient admissions even slightly increased (+0.6%).

Furthermore, no new cases were detected in Hubei Province since 3 rd April. However, infection control measures are still enforced to stop the risk of new infection by citizens returning from overseas countries and undetected asymptomatic patients in the community.

The key indicators include: (1) all patients with suspicious fever/respiratory symptoms; (2) travel history to any foreign countries, outside regions (including Hong Kong, Macau, Taiwan), Hubei province or any other community infected with COVID-19; and (3) contact with confirmed or asymptomatic COVID-19 patient in the past 2 weeks. Early hospitalization of confirmed cases is important. We learnt the bitter lesson at Wuhan when patients were asked to stay at home as there were not enough hospital beds at the beginning of the outbreak. This resulted in rapid surge of cross-infection. Effective rectification by installing more than 16 hospitals with 12000 beds was implemented within 10 days. Although very few hospitals have ideally equipped wards with negative pressure and HEPA filter, a well-ventilated environment is provided for isolation of patients under proper care by health care professionals. Central assignment of responsibility to different hospitals, basing on available infrastructure and expertise, is another effective step. All confirmed cases are treated in COVID-19 designated hospitals, allowing the other hospitals to continue essential medical services for non-infected patients. The COVID-19 designated hospitals are basically divided into 3 categories -(A) entire hospital for patients with severe symptoms needing intensive care, (B) entire hospital for patients with mild symptoms, and (C) other hospitals 8 with designated isolation wards for recovering patients. This arrangement allows costeffective assignment of health care workers and rapid accumulation of knowledge. To provide the rapid increase in manpower needed, central coordination for deploying the required expertise is needed. Over 42,000 health care workers from different provinces have been thus deployed to Hubei Province during the peak period. There is a touching spirit of volunteerism all over China. Another crucial government policy to ensure full compliance with early detection and hospitalization (if infected) is the waiving of medical expenses on COVID-19 related investigations and treatment. Although 90% of citizens in major Chinese cities are covered by medical insurance, a huge population are inadequately covered. Without such financial assurance, under-privileged suspects/patients may decline the recommended investigations/ treatment, seriously affecting the attempts for early isolation.",
