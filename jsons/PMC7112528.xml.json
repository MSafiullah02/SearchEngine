            "text": "One of the most efficient and rapid host response against viruses consists of the production of type I interferons (IFN-\u03b1 and IFN-\u03b2), an essential part of the antiviral innate immune system (reviewed by Kawai and Akira, 2006). Many if not most nucleated cells are capable of producing type I IFNs, though differences in the production of IFN-\u03b1 or IFN-\u03b2 between cells have been described (reviewed by Thiel and Weber, 2008). Secreted IFNs stimulate adjacent cells to express potent antiviral proteins and stimulate macrophages and natural killer (NK) cells to elicit antiviral responses. IFN-\u03b3, a type II IFN, is predominantly produced by NK, NKT cells, dendritic cells and Th1 CD4+ and CD8+ effector cytotoxic T lymphocytes once antigen specific immunity develops. IFN-\u03b3 increases antigen presentation on macrophages and expression of MHC class I molecules, promotes NK cell activity and leukocyte adhesion and binding required for migration. Thus interferon production triggered by the first contact with the viral intruder slows down the virus multiplication, allowing the host's immune system to respond, and helps to establish an adaptive immune response. In a previous study, we showed that IFN-\u03b3 production was not only significantly increased in splenocytes of IBV-infected chickens after in vitro restimulation with IBV, but also in splenocytes of IBV-uninfected chickens after 24 h incubation with IBV-M41 (Ariaans et al., 2009). Based on these findings, we investigated whether chicken NK cells are activated upon infection with IBV, which might suggest that this cell population might be the possible producers of the IFN-\u03b3.",

            "text": "Avian NK cells have been described as a population of cells in the chicken embryonic spleen at a developmental stage where T cells have not yet migrated to the periphery. These cells express surface CD8\u03b1\u03b1 homodimers, but no T (CD3) or B-cell specific antigens and are able to kill the NK-susceptible cell-line LSCC-RP9 (G\u00f6bel et al., 1994). In adult chickens, these cells have been reported in the intestinal epithelial lymphocyte (IEL) population (G\u00f6bel et al., 2001). The frequency of avian NK cells in peripheral blood lymphocytes (PBL) and spleen was very low, ranging from 0.5% to 1.0% (G\u00f6bel et al., 2001). This is in sharp contrast to NK cell frequencies in mammals, which have approximately around 10% NK cells in blood and in spleen. One explanation for this difference in NK cells frequencies between chickens and mammals can be that the current markers used to detect chicken NK cells are based on NK cell populations in embryonic spleen and the gut and do not necessarily recognize all NK cells in blood and spleen of adult chickens. Recently, we identified additional markers that are expressed on splenic NK cells and developed an assay in which surface expression of CD107 (LAMP-1) is analyzed as a measure NK cell activation (Jansen et al., 2010).",

            "text": "To measure whether the NK cells were present and activated, a CD107 assay was performed using lung cells of infected and uninfected control birds. Cytotoxic cells contain cytolytic vesicles with proteins like granzyme and perforin. Lining the membrane of these vesicles is CD107 and upon activation the vesicles degranulate and merge with the surface membrane resulting in relocation of CD107 to the surface membrane (Alter et al., 2004). Activation of NK cells was measured by determining the surface expression of CD107 combined with staining for CD3 to discriminate between CD3\u2212 NK cells and CD3+ cytotoxic T cells. Upon infection with IBV-M41, CD107 expression was significantly up regulated on CD3\u2212 cells at 1 dpi in the lungs (Fig. 1A), suggesting that NK cells were activated. Thereafter, NK cell activity in lung was decreased to background level. In contrast, the percentage activated NK cells in PBMC (Fig. 1B) was much higher compared to the lung and showed a biphasic pattern, with a significant increase at 1 dpi, a decrease to background level at 2 dpi similar to the lung, followed by a significant increase at 4 dpi. The high percentage of activated NK cells in blood might indicate a rapid systemic spread of IBV-M41 (Smith et al., 1985). Transcriptome analysis of pooled tracheas at 3 dpi with an attenuated IBV Massachusetts strain revealed induction of genes involved in cytotoxicity such as Granzyme-A precursor, Fas, CD3 \u03b4 and \u03b3 chain, MHC II, and TLR2. This expression pattern could be due to cytotoxic T cell responses as suggested by the authors (Wang et al., 2006), but these molecules are also playing a major role in NK-cell cytotoxicity (Zhang et al., 2012). Based on our study a contribution of NK cells at 3 dpi seems very likely and confirms the transcriptome analysis. Furthermore, newly entered but not yet antigen-specific CTLs might be present though not yet cytotoxic, whereas the IBV-M41 specific CTLs can be detected after 9 dpi (Liu et al., 2012).",

Changes in IFN mRNA were measured using qRT-PCR (IFN-\u03b1, IFN-\u03b2, and IFN-\u03b3), and IFN proteins were measured using an IFN-\u03b1/\u03b2 reporter assay and an IFN-\u03b3 Elispot assay. The amount of IFN-\u03b1 and IFN-\u03b2 mRNA in the lung of IBV-M41 infected birds did not change during the first 4 days after infection compared to uninfected control birds (Fig. 2A). These findings were confirmed at protein level, no difference in IFN-\u03b1/\u03b2 activity was detected in the supernatants of ex vivo lung leukocytes isolated 1\u20134 days after IBV-M41 infection and cultured without restimulation in vitro for 24 h compared to uninfected birds (Supplement 2). The potential of IBV to induce IFN-\u03b1/\u03b2 after infection and its sensitivity to IFN-\u03b1/\u03b2 seems to be IBV strain dependent. IBV-M41 induced low levels of acid stabile IFNs in chick embryo and chick kidney cells (CKCs) and no IFNs after inoculation in embryonated eggs (Otsuki et al., 1979), whereas for example the tissue culture adapted IBV Beaudette strain induced IFNs in embryonated eggs (Otsuki et al., 1979). In contrast, Holmes and Darbyshire (1978) showed that IBV-M41 and IBV-Beaudette failed to yield IFN in primary CKC and in tracheal organ cultures using Semliki Forest Virus inhibition assays. In the latter study these strains were not susceptible to the inhibitory effects of IFN, whereas Pei et al. (2001) treated CKC with recombinant ChIFN-\u03b1 which inhibited replication of IBV-Beaudette and Gray strain. Repeated in vivo administration of recombinant ChIFN-\u03b1 before and after inoculation with IBV-Gray strain reduced the clinical respiratory illness.",
