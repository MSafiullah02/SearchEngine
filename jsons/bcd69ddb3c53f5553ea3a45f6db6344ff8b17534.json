            "text": "Avian infectious bronchitis virus (IBV), a chicken Gammacoronavirus, is a major poultry pathogen, and is probably endemic in all regions with intensive poultry production. Since IBV was fi rst described in 1936, many serotypes and variants of IBV have been isolated worldwide. IBV isolates are capable of infecting a large range of epithelial surfaces of the chicken, involving the respiratory, renal, and reproductive systems; however, the clinical signs are usually not specifi c for differential diagnoses. Virus isolation is commonly used for diagnosis of IBV infection, which was achieved through passage of clinical materials via the allantoic route of embryos. Currently, more sensitive molecular approaches for the detection of avian pathogens have been developed, including reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and real-time RT-PCR, which are more suitable for use in diagnostic laboratories. In this chapter, we describe a one-step RT-PCR which can be used for detecting most of IBV serotypes in the IBV-infected allantoic fl uid and has been used routinely in our laboratories for detection of IBVs.",

This disease is prevalent throughout the world and affects the performance of both meat-type and egg-laying birds, thereby causing severe economic loss within the poultry industry. IB can affect chickens of all ages and result in respiratory disease, nephritis, proventriculitis, and decrease in egg production and egg quality [ 1 -3 ] . Furthermore, this disease is often complicated by secondary bacterial infections that cause increased mortality. It may be the most economically important viral respiratory tract disease of chickens in countries and regions where there is no highly pathogenic avian infl uenza virus or velogenic (highly pathogenic) Newcastle disease virus [ 4 ] .",

Since there is lack of cell lines to support the growth of IBV, 9-to 11-day-old embryo inoculation via the allantoic route is commonly used for virus isolation.

This type of diagnosis assay has been used for many years. However, for most of the fi eld samples, several blind passages (more than three times) were needed before typical characteristic embryo changes can be observed, and interpretation of the results was subjective.

For collecting oropharyngeal swab samples, insert swab into the bird's throat and leave it in place for a few seconds to absorb secretions. It is considered that replication of IBV in intestinal tract normally does not cause clinical disease, although it does result in faecal excretion of the virus. The excretion of IBV in the faeces may be associated with apparent long-term persistence of IBV in chicken fl ocks. Therefore, cloacal swab is the material of choice to detect IBV.

In addition, kidney and caecal tonsil are candidate materials when investigating kidney infection or declined egg laying performance. If swelling of the proventriculus, the characteristic changes of infected chickens, occurs, proventriculus can be selected as sample for IBV detection. 4 . In order to detect as many IBV serotypes as possible, N protein genes from 228 IBV strains available in GenBank were aligned using the MegAlign application in the Lasergene software package [ 16 ] . The forward primer N (+) targeting a conserved region of IBV N gene and reverse primer N (\u2212) targeting the conversed 3\u2032 UTR of the IBV genome were designed. We have successfully detected the Massachusetts, 4/91, LX4, CK/ CH/LSC/99I, CK/CH/LDL/97I, and Connecticut type of IBV serotypes by using this pair of primers. The Georgia 98, Arkansas, and Florida (isolated from USA), Australian Group 1, 2, and 3 (identifi ed in Australia), Italy02, and D274 (predominant IBV types identifi ed in Europe, except 793B, Massachusetts, and LX4 types) have not to be tested, due to that these isolates are unavailable in our laboratory. However, the primers N (+) and N (\u2212) could also be used to detect these IBV types, because the primers are targeting highly conserved regions among these IBV strains. It should be noted that although the primer targeting regions are conserved, N gene and 3\u2032-terminal region of 3\u2032 UTR show certain variations among different serotypes. It is likely that primers N (+) and N (\u2212) may need slight modifi cation to increase their universality for other IBV serotypes that have not been tested in our study. For example, degeneracy of primers should be considered which has been successfully applied in detection of viruses with genetic diversity. 5. We prepare homogenized tissue suspensions by using the TissueLyser II (Qiagen, Germany) which has been widely applied to sample preparation. The 2 ml microcentrifuge tubes with stainless steel beads for tissue disruption should be sterilized. Precooling the Tissue Lyser Adapter Set in \u221280 \u00b0C can reduce the RNA degradation in the process of sample preparation.",
