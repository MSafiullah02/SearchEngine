There were no significant differences between males and females. Those who were of over 50 years old, had an undergraduate education and below, were divorced or widowed, and agricultural workers had significantly more symptoms. However, significantly more minors and medical staff were in the high-risk group. These results show that COVID-19 has a significant adverse socio-psychological influence on ordinary citizens.

Furthermore, seven additional items (ADD) assess disturbances in appetite and sleep. The three Global Indices measure composite psychological distress, including Global Severity Index (GSI), Positive Symptom Distress Index (PSDI), and Positive Symptom Total (PST) (Derogatis and Unger, 2010) . The GSI was considered the overall index of psychological symptoms in this study, which was calculated as the mean of all 90 items in SCL-90.

However, data from our study show that during the epidemic, men's psychological symptoms were generally higher than women's, which may be because most of the deaths resulting from COVID-19 occurred in men ( N. Chen et al., 2020) . With regard to education level, the psychological symptoms of those who graduated from high school were the most serious. In China, most of the migrant workers are below the undergraduate level who have to leave their hometown and take public transportation (such as high-speed rail, trains, and planes) to work in big cities. Some scholars have concluded that the psychological symptoms level of migrant workers in large Chinese cities is generally higher than those of local citizens (Ji et al., 2020; Lu et al., 2012) .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 748, "end": 778, "text": "(Rytil\u00e4-Manninen et al., 2016)", "ref_id": "BIBREF34"}, {"start": 1240, "end": 1260, "text": "(Curto et al., 2018;", "ref_id": "BIBREF11"}, {"start": 1261, "end": 1281, "text": "Kamara et al., 2017)", "ref_id": "BIBREF20"}, {"start": 1395, "end": 1413, "text": "(Lim et al., 2018)", "ref_id": "BIBREF22"}, {"start": 1626, "end": 1644, "text": "Chen et al., 2020)", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 2133, "end": 2150, "text": "(Ji et al., 2020;", "ref_id": "BIBREF18"}, {"start": 2151, "end": 2167, "text": "Lu et al., 2012)", "ref_id": "BIBREF25"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "High-risk group"}, {"text": "During the COVID-19, due to the need for overall isolation and control, migrant workers should resume work in batches under the country's deployment after the extended Spring Festival holiday.

Studies conducted by some research groups have shown that the psychological symptoms level of divorced or widowed people is generally higher than those of unmarried and married people (Al-Krenawi and Graham, 2004; Lindstr\u00f6m and Rosvall, 2012) .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 590, "end": 619, "text": "(Al-Krenawi and Graham, 2004;", "ref_id": "BIBREF0"}, {"start": 620, "end": 648, "text": "Lindstr\u00f6m and Rosvall, 2012)", "ref_id": "BIBREF24"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "High-risk group"}, {"text": "With regard to the difference in the proportion of the high-risk and low-risk groups, the differences were the largest in three groups, namely, others, enterprise staff, and agricultural workers, when compared to that in the other occupations.

People in these other occupations (such as middle and smallsized enterprise owners, individual industrial and commercial households) may lose their jobs or go bankrupt due to the impact of the epidemic. Staff may face layoffs and salary cuts, while fruits and vegetables may go unsold, as they cannot be gathered and processed, causing loss of money. Migrant workers may not be able to return to work due to the impact of the epidemic, and their wages may be damaged. With regard to academic qualifications, those with high school education and below accounted for more of the high-risk group. Some studies have found that people's psychological symptoms decrease with the increase in academic qualifications, which is consistent with the finding of this study (Assari, 2018; Erickson et al., 2016) . Among all age groups, those aged 50 and older accounted for more number in the high-risk group, which may be due to the average age of death in COVID-19 being 55.5 years ( N. Chen et al., 2020) , and ordinary people are usually anxious about being infected or suspecting they have been infected. Studies have shown that SOM, OC, and PHOB increase with age (Hessel et al., 2002) . Moreover, the proportion of women in the high-risk group was slightly higher than that of men. These results are consistent with the results of previous studies (Prunas et al., 2012; Urb\u00e1n et al., 2014) . During the epidemic, women are often more sensitive to the guarantee of family stability, the main bearer and implementer of educating children and the caregiver and therapist of family members' emotions.
