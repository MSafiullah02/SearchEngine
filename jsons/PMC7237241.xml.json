As a matter of urgency, research has promptly focused on designing cures and vaccines, which is understandable, but is the classical \u2018painkiller\u2019 approach that will be less and less efficient in our globalized society because such an approach is treating the effect and not the original cause (Lichtfouse 2009, 2010). In particular, this is somehow underestimating environmental factors such as climate change and pollution that have more or less directly favored the pandemic. For instance, climate modeling has predicted increased risks of food- and water-borne diseases with very high confidence (Woodward et al. 2014). Similarly, air pollution has been shown to alter the immune system (Glencross et al. 2020; Bauer et al. 2012). Environmental chemistry, as the science of contaminants in the environment, thus deserves more attention to prevent future pandemics (Qu et al. 2020).",

Lassa and Ebola are examples of infectious viruses associated with hemorrhagic fever. The novel coronavirus is a class of enveloped, positive-sense single-stranded RNA viruses that are responsible for the Middle East respiratory syndrome, MERS-CoV, and the severe acute respiratory syndrome, SARS-CoV, in humans. The current pandemic caused by the novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 causes severe acute respiratory symptoms and is often referred to as coronavirus infectious diseases 2019: COVID-19. No effective vaccine or drugs are available, which makes it very challenging to treat or prevent the deadly COVID-19.

In the air, the SARS-CoV-2 virus may be present as droplets, or as dust, or particulate matter (PM). The decay of the virus under various environmental conditions would determine the survival of the virus. These conditions may include the size of particulate matter and aerosols, humidity and temperature. These suggest the potential role of climate change on occurrence and the fate of the virus. Environmental chemistry research on the fate of pollutants in air (Kfoury et al. 2016; Yu 2019; Gopinath and Kadirvelu 2018), water (Gopinath and Kadirvelu 2018; Mahmood et al. 2012; Rodgers et al. 2019; Wen et al. 2019) and wastewater (Padervand et al. 2020; Simas et al. 2019; Villase\u00f1or and R\u00edos 2018; Crini and Lichtfouse 2019) is therefore highly relevant to the study of pathogenic microbes. Future detailed investigations about the physiochemical role of environmental parameters of air might therefore address the control of future outbreaks or pandemics with greater efficiency.",

For example, the novel coronavirus may survive for prolonged periods on surfaces such as latex gloves, sterile sponges, aluminum, wood, laminate, steel and plastics. Viruses usually have longer survival in a host and thus may have increased likelihood of transmission. Similarly, complete information is essential on how the novel coronavirus interacts with surfaces on a mask that vary in composition, material  and pore size to understand survival and protection. Systematically designed experiments will help us gain insight into the virus survival on various surfaces, thus minimizing the exposure of the novel coronavirus to the humans. Here, recent research in environmental chemistry has shown the role of surface materials on antimicrobial resistance (Khan et al. 2019) and bacterial communities (Dong et al. 2019).",

Additionally, faulty plumbing in buildings may increase exposure to the viruses. Very limited data sets are available on human viruses in the literature.

The purity of the stock of virus must be checked fully. Many efforts should be made to explain the novel coronavirus concentrations in gene copies and infected units. The recommendation of using oxidants and disinfectants to inactivate SARS-CoV-2 must be experimentally based, which includes testing dose demand and contact time under the environmental conditions at which the virus would be presented. In applying light-based processes to inactivate the SARS-CoV-2, attenuation through the treated water must be fully reported. Researchers should also study the surrogate virus, similarly as the well-investigated nonenveloped bacteriophage MS2, thus enabling different laboratories in world to compare their findings among different global communities.",
