In such situations, automatically expanding queries is a popularly accepted approach to add new terms and add additional context for the search engine [1].

Classic query expansion techniques expand the original query with terms selected from related documents; terms are usually added as a bag-of-words [1, 9]. There is prior research that shows classic query expansion to be effective for a few neural ranking models where query terms and document terms are matched softly [10].

It has been previously shown that applying a BERT reranker using descriptive queries written in natural language provide impressive performance gains over using classic keywords queries [2]. We hypothesize that this is due to a combination of two factors. First, the sentence structure in natural language that draws relations between different concepts, and second, the introduction of new concepts that are closely tied with the underlying information need.

We train up to a depth of 1000 in the initial retrieved documents and only rerank the top 100 documents from the initial ranking at test time. We also sample 10% of all passages with overlap in addition to the first passage of every document during training to prevent over-fitting, as original proposed [2]. Other existing BERT rerankers use a similar architecture as BERT-MaxP, and apply more complex techniques to improve accuracy, e.g., domain adaptation [2, 16], fusion with BM25 [16], and customized pooling layers [11]. This work focuses on using the simpler BERT-MaxP so that the effectiveness of queries is more clear.",

A win-loss analysis reveals that Google queries improve the original query by providing new concepts as well as several reformulations of the original query. Often, few but meaningful follow-up questions are more useful than several unrelated ones. Further, rephrasing the original sentence in multiple ways benefits the reranker. For instance for the query \u201copening adoption records\u201d, the questions \u201cAre adoption records public?\u201d, and \u201cShould adoption records be open?\u201d give a boost of +0.3 in NDCG@5. This behaviour has been previously studied in previous work [15] wherein BERT favors text sequence pairs that are close in semantic meaning. Often, synonyms and multiple paraphrased versions of the original intent benefit the reranker. On the other hand, without filtering, the GoogleQuestions model does not produce any improvement in performance. This is mainly due to the off-topic questions, which take up about 60% of all retrieved queries. Our results reveal promising direction of query expansion for BERT using related questions that people often searched together. We show that these natural questions, when on-topic, provide valuable information to the original keyword queries, and are more effective than class query expansions or solely adding structures.",
