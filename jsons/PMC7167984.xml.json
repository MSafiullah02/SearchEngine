The isopeptide bond between ubiquitin and a substrate protein, or between ubiquitin molecules in a polyubiquitin chain, can be cleaved by deubiquitinating enzymes (DUBs), which are also responsible for the activation of ubiquitin and ubiquitin\u2010like modifiers by C\u2010terminal processing of their precursors.7 A large number of DUBs have been discovered and represent an emerging class of ubiquitin pathway regulators, predominantly from eukaryotes,8 but also of bacterial and viral origins.9, 10, 11\n",

The current view is that the modular, multidomain architecture of USPs contributes to their specificity with respect to the type of ubiquitin polymer and modifier, but perhaps more importantly, to the target protein part of the substrate.8 Human USPs have highly variable amino acid sequences upstream and/or downstream of the catalytic core. A number of domains have been annotated in these regions based on sequence homology,8, 12 some already confirmed experimentally, for example, the TRAF\u2010like domain of human USP7, the DUSP domain of human USP15, and the CS domain of human USP19. However, a large proportion of the N\u2010 and C\u2010terminal extensions of human USPs remain structurally and functionally unannotated. Also, the size of their catalytic core domains varies from \u223c300 to 800 residues due to large sequences uncharacterized structurally, which may play functional roles.",

For example, human USP14 and its yeast homolog Ubp6 bind through their N\u2010terminal UBL domain to the 26S proteasome, which also results in a dramatic increase of their catalytic activity.32, 40, 41, 42 Proteasome\u2010associated DUBs can act catalytically to remove (poly)ubiquitin before proteasomal degradation, thus serving in the editing of poorly targeted substrates and ubiquitin recycling, or noncatalytically to delay proteasomal degradation and regulate both the nature and magnitude of proteasomal activity.43 It is tempting to speculate that other human USPs would also have the ability to bind directly to proteasome subunits via some of their UBL domains identified here. The UBL domain of mouse USP14, as well as other UBL domains known to associate with proteasome, for example, from human ubiquilins 2 and 3, or DNA damage repair protein Rad23A,44, 45, 46 were retrieved among the high scoring structural templates for newly mapped UBL domains of several USPs (see Supplementary Material).

Indeed, a fold recognition analysis of the unannotated sequence content of the USP family from the Saccharomyces cerevisiae yeast (16 enzymes, Ubp1 to Ubp16), detects UBL domains in Ubp12 and Ubp15, the yeast homologs of human USP15 and USP7, respectively, in addition to the known UBL domain in Ubp6 (see Supplementary Material). Another compelling example suggesting the importance of the UBL domain as a key structural and putatively regulatory module in the USP class of DUBs is provided by the SARS coronavirus papain\u2010like protease. This viral enzyme, whose primary function is in viral replication via polyprotein processing, not only acquired the USP molecular architecture and deubiquitinating activity common to the corresponding host cell enzymes,11, 26, 27 but it also features a UBL domain (albeit about 20 residues smaller than ubiquitin).28\n",

            "text": "The UBL domains detected in human USPs do not show, in the sequence following their C\u2010terminal \u03b2\u2010strand, similarity to the ubiquitin precursor processing site, which occurs after the ubiquitin C\u2010terminal sequence 73LRGG76. We therefore conclude that they are internal noncleavable UBL domains. However, a structural relationship to ubiquitin has been recently proposed for human USP1, which is inactivated by auto\u2010cleavage after an internal ubiquitin\u2010like di\u2010glycine motif.50 The cleavage occurs in the middle of a 140\u2010residue insertion in the minimal USP catalytic core domain, based on the available crystal structures of USPs 2, 7, 8, and 14. However, we could not detect the UBL fold in the 70\u2010residue inserted sequence preceding the processing site. It is possible that in the case of USP1, key substrate interactions between its catalytic groove S\n6\u2010S\n1 subsites and its residues 666IGLLGG671 preceding the cleavage site, which are homologous to the ubiquitin C\u2010terminal sequence 71LRLRGG76, are sufficient for cleavage without the need of additional interactions from the rest of the ubiquitin fold. Like the acquisition of noncleavable UBL domains, the utilization of a cleavable internal ubiquitin\u2010like C\u2010terminal motif in USP1 provides another fascinating example for the reuse of structural elements specific to the ubiquitin signaling pathways towards increasing their own regulatory capabilities and functional diversity. The structural bioinformatics analysis reported here provides valuable information that can spur further structure\u2010function characterization studies in this class of deubiqutinating enzymes.",

Note the split in the circularly permuted Zn\u2010finger\u2010like domain (blue) and the catalytic core (cyan) due to sizable insertions in some family members. Other domains of these USPs, according to their currently available public annotations, are also shown (see insert). Human USPs 14 and 48, with UBL domains previously annotated based on sequence homology, are shown at the top. (B) Sequence and secondary structure alignment between UBL domains predicted for human USPs (upper part) and selected members from the ubiquitin superfold (lower part, identified primarily by their PDB codes). See Materials and Methods for details, and Supplementary Material for other UBL structures identified by consensus fold recognition as statistically significant templates for the newly detected UBL domains, including the full query\u2010to\u2010template assignment. Secondary structure elements, predicted for USP sequences, and observed for the other UBL domains, are highlighted in blue \u2013 \u03b2\u2010strand, red \u2013 \u03b1\u2010helix, brown \u2013 G\u2010helix, and violet \u2013 ambivalent \u03b1/\u03b2 predictions.

The common fingerprint sequence of the ubiquitin superfold is taken from Ref.29, where conserved hydrophobic residues are denoted by h (90% conserved) and H (100% conserved) and conserved polar residues are denoted by p (90% conserved).
