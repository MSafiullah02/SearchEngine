            "text": "Coronaviridae represent a very important family of animal and human viruses [1,2] that are in permanent circulation. Four common human coronaviruses (HKU1, NL63, OC43 and E229) cause 10\u201320% of respiratory infections worldwide and are present in all continents [3], [4], [5], [6], [7], [8], [9], [10], [11], [12], [13], [14] (Table 1\n). Mortality is poorly assessed, but it is clear that there are chronic carriers as well as asymptomatic carriers. Studies have shown that there are as many asymptomatic carriers as symptomatic patients [3,9]. Three epidemic episodes of emerging coronaviruses have been reported. The first, severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) coronavirus, had very little impact on global morbidity and mortality, with more than 8000 recognized cases and 774 deaths [15,16]. The second, Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS)-coronavirus, remained localized in Saudi Arabia, with a small epidemic of mainly nosocomial infections in South Korea [17]. MERS-coronavirus, like SARS-coronavirus, highlighted the major danger of nosocomial transmission to healthcare personnel, the health of whom is essential in these epidemics [18]. Finally, SARS-CoV-2, the novel coronavirus that appeared in December 2019, has expanded and has now affected more than 90 000 people worldwide [2,19,20]. At the time of writing, a significant number of cases had occurred in the Far East. It is incontestably contagious, as a quasi-experimental study on the Diamond Princess cruise ship showed that confinement of infected patients with uninfected patients resulted in rapid infection of the uninfected patients, leading to 700 additional cases on board [21]. However, coronaviruses in common circulation remain predominant because of their global distribution and their non-negligible mortality [14,22]. The aim of this study was to share the experience of a reference laboratory representing approximately 1% of serious and diagnosed respiratory infections, particularly seasonal, in France. This will allow the evaluation of the relative mortality of different human coronaviruses presented in hospitals in Marseille compared with that of SARS-CoV-2.",

In comparison, the mortality rate of SARS-CoV-2 in European or American developed countries of a comparable economic level is 1.3% (Table 3). If the extrapolation of deaths in AP-HM hospitals is correct, in metropolitan France, this would represent 543/0.8 * 100 = 67 875 cases of patients hospitalized with a respiratory infection with common coronaviruses in 2 months, which is almost as many cases as for SARS-CoV-2 worldwide. In fact, mortality from respiratory infections is extremely dependent on the quality of care and access to care, and severe forms have a better prognosis in countries with superior medical infrastructures. Under these conditions, there does not seem to be a significant difference between the mortality rate of SARS-CoV-2 in OECD countries and that of common coronaviruses (\u03c72 test, P=0.11). Of course, the major flaw in this study is that the percentage of deaths attributable to the virus is not determined, but this is the case for all studies reporting respiratory virus infections, including SARS-CoV-2. Indeed, viral infections are ecosystem infections where the outcome depends on the inoculums and the surrounding microbiota [26]. Thus, certain bacteria seem to be associated with symptomatic manifestations, such as Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae and Staphylococcus aureus, which are known to cause an excess of mortality due to secondary infection. Finally, seasonality, geographic location, heat and humidity are co-factors, as are age, gender and underlying pathologies. Under these conditions, and all other things being equal, SARS-CoV-2 infection cannot be described as being statistically more severe than infection with other coronaviruses in common circulation.",

There is little chance that the emergence of SARS-CoV-2 could change this statistic significantly. Fear could have a larger impact than the virus itself; a case of suicide motivated by the fear of SARS-COV-2 has been reported in India [28].",
