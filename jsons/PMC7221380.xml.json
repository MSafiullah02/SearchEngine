On February 28, World Health Organization announced that it would raise the level of global communication and impact risk to \u201cvery high\u201d. How to effectively block the transmission of COVID-19 has become an urgent public health problem. In the whole stage of prevention and control, how to effectively manage close contacts is very important [1].",

Close contacts are defined as those individuals who have not taken effective protection and come into close contact with suspected and confirmed cases within 1 meter. The definition of time is from the 7 days before the onset of symptoms of suspected and confirmed cases, or 7 days before the sampling day of asymptomatic infections. Management measures include:1) The body temperature and health status of close contacts shall be monitored twice a day; 2) Close contacts once have any symptoms, including fever, chills, cough, runny nose, sore throat, headache, muscle pain, shortness of breath, vomiting, diarrhea and so on, immediately report to the local health department and sent to designated medical institutions for diagnosis and treatment. 3) At the end of the medical observation period, throat swab specimens will be sampled and tested for 2019-NCoV Nucleic acid detection by Real-Time PCR.",

Due to the centralized medical observation sites were temporarily requisitioned, there was no possibility to perform a completely separate decontamination of passageway, so it iswas recommended to concurrently disinfect the passageway after use. The waste generated in the sites wa defined as medical waste, which should be collected by a designated person who was only responsible for collecting and transporting medical wasteand stored in a temporary storage room conforming to the requirements medical waste management. During the supervision, it was found that some temporary storage room had potential leakage just like that the medical waste would be taken away or residents living nearby would enter the room, which could not be locked, or was not convenient for routine disinfection. At one observation site, the medical staff entered the room of close contacts to measure body temperature twice a day. However, this practice was considered as increasing the risk of infection among medical staff as well as the increasing the consumption of personal protective equipment. Therefore, in most of the centralized medical observation sites, the body temperature monitoring was performed by the observed individuals themselves, then text the body temperature data and their health status to the medical staff by point-to-point WeChat and recorded. Another objective monitoring method was to take a throat swab for detecting 2019-NCoV nucleic acid three times. One was within three days after entered in the medical observation room, the other two was just before be dismissed and the interval time needed to more than 24 hours.",
