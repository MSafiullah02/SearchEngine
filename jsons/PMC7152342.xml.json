            "text": "Tissue transplantation therapy, which has been utilised for over 50 years [1], is a rapidly developing field carrying with it great promise for ameliorating or curing many diseases. One of its drawbacks, however, is the potential for donor-to-recipient disease transmission. This risk is greatly reduced by excluding donors at risk of carrying infection and by testing the donor for transmissible infectious disease. Aseptic surgical technique in a quality environment, when removing the tissue from the donor, when processing and storing the tissue and during implantation is critically important to prevent bacterial and fungal contamination. Non-viable tissue grafts such as bone can undergo disinfection and sterilisation steps. During the past two decades the disease transmission risk associated with tissue transplantation has been greatly reduced by implementation of standards set by professional organisations, such as the American Association of Tissue Banks [2], the European Association of Tissue Banks (EATB) [3], the Eye Bank Association of America [4], and governmental regulations. However, the incidence of transplant-transmitted infection is unknown and the studies needed to determine this have not been performed.",

Unlike the limitations of organ transplants, tissue transplantation generally is not limited by HLA histocompatibility barriers [7] or by ABO blood group incompatibility [8]. No longer a scarce resource, the widened availability of tissue allografts encouraged new clinical use and brought attention not only to their effectiveness and advantages over autografts but also to their drawbacks, side effects, and complications. One complication of tissue transplantation has been transmission of viral infections of donor origin to the recipient [9,\n10]. Viral infections can be transmitted if the donor has a viral infection and the viral levels are too low for detection. In asymptomatic donors who are recently infected, a transient viremic phase can exist prior to development of a positive donor-screening test for antibodies. Preventing donor-to-recipient infectious disease transmission relies heavily on selecting safe donors not only through testing, but also by medical and social behaviour screening to select donors more likely to be free of transmissible infections. In addition, sterilisation with gamma irradiation can be important.",

Consequently, it is not very immunogenic nor is it often rejected by the recipient, unless it becomes vascularised. Similarly it is not very efficient in transmitting viral infectious disease from the donor. Diseases transmitted through corneal transplants are listed in Table 4\n. The cornea is not efficient in carrying or transmitting HIV. Based on assumptions about HIV antibody test sensitivity, Goode et al. estimated that 3 per 10,000 cornea allografts would be from HIV-infected donors despite HIV antibody testing [11]. There have been several documented cases in which cadaveric organ and tissue donors were infected with HIV but the cornea recipients did not become infected. Although HIV has been isolated from tears, retina, cornea, aqueous humour, iris, and conjunctiva 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, HIV from infected cadaveric donors has not been transmitted to cornea recipients [17,\n18]. This should not be surprising because the inoculum of HIV is small in the relatively avascular, hypocellular cornea compared to that in an organ transplant or a blood transfusion from an HIV infected donor.",

HCV was transmitted by the use of a femoral head allograft after it was donated by a donor undergoing hip arthroplasty and stored frozen for 2 months [36].

In this study, the cadaver bone donor tested negative for HCV antibodies using the first generation test available at the time of donation in 1990, but stored serum tested positive when a new, more sensitive test was introduced in 1992. Testing for HCV RNA by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) was also positive.

Both the donor and the bone allograft recipient subsequently died of AIDS. A test for HIV-1 antibody was not available at the time of donation. This donor would not have been eligible to be a donor today due to his history of intravenous drug abuse and lymphadenopathy. There have been other cases of HIV infection in recipients of bone allograft derived from HIV-infected donors who were not tested for HIV at the time of donation. Prior to HIV antibody test availability in Germany, 12 recipients had frozen bone allografts from an infected cadaveric donor during November 1984 through January 1985 [48]. Only four of these recipients became HIV positive. Seven remained HIV-negative. In Taiwan a man donated a femoral head during hip replacement surgery but was not tested for HIV. The bone allograft was used in a 34-year-old woman in 1996 during knee reconstructive surgery. She seroconverted with HIV antibodies when tested five months later [49].",

Multiple organs, corneas, bones, and connective tissues were transplanted [42]. Three organ recipients and three recipients of frozen bone and tendon allografts became HIV infected. These allografts had not been sterilised with gamma irradiation or ethylene oxide gas prior to use. The donor tested negative for HIV antibody at the time of donation in October 1985, which was a few months after the first, relatively insensitive HIV antibody testing kits became available. Between 1985 and 1991, there were several modifications that greatly improved test sensitivity. Prior to 1989, HIV antibody was detectable a median of 63 days after initial infection [50,\n51]. A study of HIV infected blood donors between March 1987 and 1991, when whole viral lysate enzyme immunoassays were used to detect HIV antibodies, showed an average seronegative window period of 45 days [52]. A report in 1992 showed HIV antibody test kits in use at that time detected twice as many infected individuals as did the test kits available in 1985 [53]. Since 1992, HIV antibody tests became even more sensitive, detecting IgM, the earliest form of antibodies, an average of 8-20 days earlier [54,\n55] and resulting in a seronegative window period of approximately 22 days [56,\n57]. Since then blood donor testing for HIV RNA by nucleic acid testing (NAT) has been implemented and has further reduced the risk of a transfusion and when validated and implemented for cadaver tissue donors will reduce the risk in tissue transplantation[58].",

This may be true for living bone donors [59,\n61] but not necessarily for cadaveric donors. Of 9000 living bone donors who donated femoral heads at the time of hip arthroplasty surgery, none were found to have confirmed positive tests for HIV-1 antibodies at the time of donation [59]. Prevalence of infectious disease markers in surgical bone donors was not different from that of blood donors, except for a higher prevalence of false positive syphilis tests and antibodies to HBV core protein [60]. Retesting of 1608 living bone donors 180 days later yielded none with confirmed positive HIV or HCV tests [61]. Of 5513 cadaver bone donors tested throughout the United States in 1992, there were three confirmed positive for HIV antibodies [62], but these three were from a single tissue bank that later disclosed accepting donors with risk factors for HIV. A more recent survey by AATB [63] revealed a higher prevalence rate of infectious disease markers than have been reported for blood donors, with rates ranging from 2 to 40 times higher (Table 5\n). The addition of viral nucleic acid testing, since 1999, in screening blood donors for HIV and HCV has further reduced the risk from blood donors. First time blood donors have a higher infectious disease marker rate and may be more similar to organ and tissue donors [64].",

Twenty-two recipients were HBsAg-positive prior to transplant or were immune to HBV and not susceptible to HBV infection. Of the nine recipients susceptible to HBV infection, only one developed HBV viral markers. None developed clinically apparent hepatitis. However, four susceptible recipients received hepatitis B immune globulin and one received HBV vaccine following transplant, which may have prevented infection [76]. Currently all donors are tested for HBsAg and if positive are excluded. Despite testing donors for HBsAg and anti-HBc, HBV transmission can still occur because some donors can have circulating HBV at levels not detectable in routine tests. Thijssen et al. found one of 676 heart valve allograft donors to have HBsAg detectable with routine screening tests [77]. In addition, they found 10% to have anti-HBc. Fifty-two of 63 donors with anti-HBc also had antibodies to HBV surface protein (anti-HBs), indicating a resolved HBV infection and a recovered, immune noninfectious status. Three of those with anti-HBc but without anti-HBs were positive for HBV DNA using a more sensitive liquid-phase DNA hybridisation assay. This would suggest a possible value of anti-HBc donor testing to prevent transmission of HBV; however, one study of blood donors has shown a lack of predictive value in preventing post-transfusion hepatitis [78]. More recently, however, several reports have confirmed that some anti-HBc positive donors will be positive for DNA and will transmit HBV [79].",

The burned patient also acquires CMV infection but does not generally experience serious complications as regularly as organ recipients, perhaps because burn-related immunosuppression may be less profound than that produced by drugs used to prevent organ rejection. As burn patients begin to receive potent immunosuppressants such as cyclosporine to block rejection of skin allografts, CMV may become a more serious complication of burn care and related blood transfusion and skin allografting. Further studies of skin allograft recipients are needed to determine whether transmission of CMV by skin allograft is associated with symptomatic disease as seen in organ transplantation recipients, or is asymptomatic as generally seen in transfusion-transmitted CMV infections in immunocompetent blood transfusion recipients. It is thus premature to assume that it is beneficial to base selection of skin donors on CMV antibody testing.",

In addition to being mosquito-borne, WNV has been transmitted through organ transplantation, blood transfusions, transplacental intrauterine spread and percutaneous route from laceration and needlestick [94]. A new corona virus infection recently caused a severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and spread across the continents [95].

Donor selection is an important first step taken to ensure that the resulting allograft is safe and effective. The cadaver tissue donor selection process includes a donor's medical and social history obtained from the next-of-kin and medical care providers, blood tests, a physical examination performed by tissue bank personnel, and an autopsy, if performed (Table 6). Preliminary donor selection is based on the donor's medical history and circumstances surrounding death. Donors are excluded if elements of the past medical and social history or recent hospitalisation indicate a risk of infection, malignant disease, or inadequate quality of donated organ or tissue. The living donor, the legal consenting next-of-kin or life partner of a cadaveric donor, or both, must be directly interviewed to determine whether HIV or hepatitis risk behaviours are present (Table 5). Persons with HIV and hepatitis risk behaviours are excluded from donation. The tissue bank physician makes the final determination of suitability of a cadaveric tissue donor as required by national professional standards [2,\n72].",

One study of 1424 cadaver bone donors showed that the use of HIV DNA (not HIV RNA) and p24 antigen blood testing did not detect additional HIV infected cadaveric bone donors [103]. All 1424 donors negative for HIV-1 antibodies were also negative for HIV DNA. This is what is expected since the appearance of HIV DNA in a recently infected person's blood does not occur sooner that the onset of detectable antibodies. On the other hand, HIV RNA appears earlier and has a greater potential benefit. Although HIV RNA testing is more sensitive than antibody assays, it may be premature to apply it routinely to cadaver donor testing due to the low HIV prevalence in the donor population, its uncertain predictive value, its false positive rate, and its false negative rate due to haemoglobin contamination and other potentially interfering substances in cadaveric post-mortem blood samples.",

Initially, viral nucleic acid testing was not feasible in blood donor screening applications due to lack of automation, time and space restrictions and cost. Recently, however, test systems are being used to test over 13 million blood donations annually in the United States: the Roche Molecular Systems COBAS AMPLISCREEN tests for HCV and HIV and the Gen-Probe/Chiron Pooled Plasma HIV-1/HCV Amplified Assay. Testing is being done on pooled samples using pools of 24 or 16. Testing of pooled samples reduces the number of tests required on a daily basis, the time to perform testing and the cost. It also takes into account the rapid rise of viral RNA in recently infected individuals so that pooling has a minimal impact on the sensitivity of these assays. The increased sensitivity of these systems over previously available PCR tests has also made this possible. Both systems have now been licensed for blood donor screening and efforts are underway to qualify them for organ and tissue donor screening. The same approach is now being tested in trials for HBV and WNV.",

Although not required by AATB Standards and in the absence of HBV DNA testing, the use of anti-HBc in donor testing likely had a safety benefit in reducing HBV infections. Several reports have documented the presence of HBV in the sera of HBsAg-negative, anti-HBc-positive blood donors [79,\n106,\n107]. These reports also suggest that the addition of HBV DNA testing will increase the sensitivity of HBV detection but may not entirely replace the need to test for anti-HBc or HBsAg. For example, recipient directed lookback procedures have revealed recipients of HBsAg negative, NAT negative, anti HBc-positive blood components to have been infected with HBV [79].",

Sample quality and presence of haemoglobin can also cause false negative results when testing for HIV and HCV by NAT [110,\n111]. Frozen storage and multiple freeze-thaws do not have a major effect on detectability of antibodies to infectious agents in serum, but they may reduce the reliability of testing for microbial nucleic acids by NAT. Busch et al. showed that multiple freeze thaws can reduce the detectability of HCV RNA by NAT [112]. Published studies are too few to draw any firm conclusions, other than a possible deleterious effect of frozen storage and freeze thawing on testing serum for HCV RNA and peripheral blood white cells for HIV DNA by NAT. Despite this, NAT was used to detect and retrospectively diagnose HIV infection using marrow specimens from an organ and tissue donor and frozen sera from organ recipients 5 years after the donation and transplantation [42]. HCV testing by NAT was also useful in confirming HCV infection in one cadaveric donor [38] and was essential in another [39].

The retest aims to identify recently infected donors who were seronegative for HIV and HCV antibodies at the time of donation. This 180 day retest is required for semen and bone donors but not for living donors of blood, marrow, amnion, umbilical veins, or foetal tissue. Retesting the low risk voluntary living bone donors has not detected any additional infections despite thousands of donations and retests [61]. whereas it may have utility in the higher risk population of paid semen donors. Most tissue banks have ceased collecting surgical femoral heads, partly due to lower quality, but also due to the difficulties of acquiring the 180-day sample for retesting. Testing of samples for HCV and HIV RNA from living donors at the time of donation would enhance safety and could eliminate the need for a 180-day retest",

When the first truly effective immunosuppressant, cyclosporin, became available in 1981, organ transplantation flourished. The numbers of organs transplanted each year grew rapidly leading to implementation of effective programs to develop public support for organ donation. As organ donation grew, so did tissue donation. With the rapid growth of transplantation, early cases of transplant transmitted viral diseases arose from infections of the donor but could have been prevented if tests were available. The use of new and more sensitive donor viral detection tests has reduced the risk of recipient infections.",

Surgeons should use allografts only when needed and obtain them from accredited tissue banks. They should consider use of autografts, alternative nonhuman graft material, or processed and sterilised tissue allografts whenever possible tissue banks reduce the risk for rejecting those donors suspected to be at risk for HIV, hepatitis, or other viral or bacterial infections, performing a donor physical examination, reviewing autopsy reports, and the surgical removal of donated tissue using aseptic technique. Lastly, sterilisation of certain tissues can be very effective, but it is not universally applicable, because some viruses are relatively resistant to sterilants and because the clinical effectiveness of many tissues (such as skin, cornea, valves, veins) can be altered by sterilisation procedures [117]. Application of all these steps will assure a very low risk of transmitting disease from the donor to the recipient.",
