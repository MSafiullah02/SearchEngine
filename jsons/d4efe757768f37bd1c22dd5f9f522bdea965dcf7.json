            "text": "According to reports of clinical studies, several drug therapies could be potentially helpful as treatment options for patients with COVID-19, 1 and they are being evaluated. For instance, chloroquine/hydroxychloroquine (CQ)/(HCQ), 2 tocilizumab, 3 lopinavir/ritonavir, 4 or remdesivir. 5 The message regarding the pharmacotherapy of hospitalized patients with COVID-19 is clear; unfortunately, it could be regarded as unenthusiastic because there is no accurate and sufficient evidence to recommend any specific treatment for patients. Similarly, a recent rapid systematic review of clinical trials utilizing chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine as a treatment for COVID-19 concluded that: \"there is currently not enough data available to support the routine use of HCQ andCQ as therapies for COVID-19\". 6 The situation underscores the need to design and develop more randomized and controlled clinical trials with these drugs in patients with COVID-19. In addition, it is necessary to offer some available pharmacotherapy options both with a plausible mechanism of action and with information that show some favorable risk/benefit relation in patients hospitalized with moderate or severe COVID-19. This practice would be adjusted to guidelines on the treatment and management of patients with COVID-19, as follows: \"in the context of a clinical trial\" (drug-therapy with knowledge gap) or \"only in the context of a clinical trial\" (drug therapy with higher uncertainty or more potential for harm). 1 Results and conclusions of these clinical trials could be controversial; that is, some primary outcomes will prove positive and convince, while others will prove negative or will be inconclusive, and yield additional safety concerns. 7 We have been waiting for several months, and maybe we must wait one or more years for guidelines supported on highquality evidence for the specific therapy of moderate and severe COVID-19. While we should stay up to date with results of clinical trials regarding pharmacotherapy of patients with COVID-19, we must also must also perform our reading diligently, thus cautiously interpreting the methods, results, and conclusions. We must make a critical appraisal of the clinical and sociodemographic conditions of the patients included in the studies. Even more, we must recognize the core outcome set of these studies and discuss the implications of results in terms of invasive mechanical ventilation or hard outcomes as death. 6 It implies a call to action, and not only for waiting.",
