And then the author proceeds with: \"However, in a few cancers, cycles of conventional therapies, such as chemotherapy, radiation therapy and hormonal therapy, are sufficient to result in successful treatment. Why some cancers, but not most cancers, respond to conventional therapies is uncertain; the mechanism by which therapies treat cancer is generally not known. The most common human cancers are epithelial cancers and they are the least treatable with conventional therapies. The biology of the type of cancer influences the response to treatment. Even when epithelial tumors do initially respond to treatment, eventually the tumors recur. These observations suggest that cancers may either become resistant or become dormant and later regain their neoplastic properties. Over the last decade, cancer treatment has entered a new era with the development of targeted therapeutics. The presumption was that by targeting the molecular underpinning of cancer with specific drugs, the tumors would respond better to treatment. Targeting tyrosine kinases, in particular, BCR-ABL and c-KIT, Imatinib has proven to be useful in the treatment of CML (chronic myelogenous leukemia) and GIST (Gastrointestinal stromal tumor). Hence, 1 The article is published in the original. Imatinib is universally considered an example of a successful targeted therapeutic\".",

The attributes of every evolution, variability and selection, can explain both the emergence of cancer and why it is so hard to cure [5, 11] . Tumors are highly robust and maintain their proliferative potential against a wide range of anticancer therapies. Two aspects of robustness are exploited by tumors-functional redundancy due to cellular heterogeneity, and feedback-control systems that are used to facilitate survival in hazardous environments (for example, due to anticancer drugs or hypoxia). The robustness of a tumor as a system is not equal to the robustness of individual tumor cells. A tumor cell can be more fragile than a non-tumor cell in response to a particular treatment, but heterogeneous redundancy can give rise to robustness at the system level through intercellular genetic variability in the pattern of drug resistance [11] .",

However, it is now accepted to consider a tumor as an integrated ensemble of tumor and surrounding cells, in particular stroma cells. There is convincing evidence for possible mutually beneficial cooperation of partially transformed cells with each other, as well as cooperation with adjacent stroma cells beneficial for progressing tumor cells [5, 9, 12, 13] . The role of mutations in stroma cells in the development of tumors was discussed as late as 1998 [14] . A recently proposed hypothesis of morphostatic field and maintaining it molecules called morphostats [9] suggests that cancer is initiated also due to a disturbance of this field. Within this hypothesis, there are facts that carcinogenic effect results not only directly from accumulation of mutations in an evolving epithelial cancer cell but also from mutually complementary mutations in the cancer cell and surrounding stroma cells. It was also suggested [12] that partially transformed cells in the neoplasm can cooperate through a two-way paracrine exchange of diffusing factors thus providing each other with growth and proliferation resources which enhance the viability of the cells within the tumor, increase the rate of accumulation of mutations and accelerate tumor progression. Thus, cancer is not just a progeny of a particular cell that develops into a tumor due to accumulation of mutations, but a co-evolving cell population containing cancer stem cells, differentiated cancer cells with a limited proliferation potential, normal epithelial cells and surrounding stroma cells that get \"activated\" due to paracrine signals and must play key roles in driving tumor cell proliferation [5, 7, 15] . Many of the growth signals driving the proliferation of carcinoma cells may originate from the stromal cell components of the tumor mass. These cooperating cells may eventually depart from normalcy, coevolving with their malignant neighbors in order to sustain the growth of the latter [14] .",

Transfer of various tumor-suppressor genes directly to cancer cells has been demonstrated to suppress tumor growth via induction of apoptosis and cell-cycle arrest. Various studies have also shown that combination of tumor-suppressor gene therapy with conventional anticancer therapy can yield synergistic therapeutic benefits. Clinical trials with tumor-suppressor genes, especially the p53 gene, have demonstrated that the treatment is well tolerated, and favorable clinical responses have been observed in a subset of patients with advanced disease or with cancers resistant to conventional therapy [26, 27] .",

This redundancy causes immense pharmaceutical problems, as most or all pathways have to be blocked to achieve effective treatment. Many of the favored targets of modern anti-cancer drug development, including apoptosis, metastasis, and angiogenesis, suffer from problems of redundancy in that they may fail to block other potential pathways of cancer. The redundancy problem could be got over by simultaneous inhibiting several crucial upregulated genes in cancer cells. It can be carried out using coexpression of multiple shRNAs that can simultaneously inhibit multiple genes. Recently, such an approach with multiple shRNAs expression vectors containing different combinations of six shRNA expression cassettes targeted at genes involved in cell proliferation and survival pathways (Bcl-2, Survivin, Akt1, Erk2, CyclinE and NfkappaB) was reported. In HeLa and HEK293 cells, the multiple shRNAs expression constructs efficiently and simultaneously induced inhibition of all six genes. An introduction of multiple shRNAs expression vectors in the human prostate cancer cell line PC3, which contains different cell variants with distinct oncogenic signaling alterations, revealed that the multiple inhibition was much more efficient in inducing apoptosis in PC3 cells. Possibly, such a multitarget shRNAs expression system could be an effective strategy in cancer therapy [53] .",

            "text": "for Genetic Surgery Engineered oncolytic viruses (OV) with various mechanisms of action were developed in the past two decades [58] . There are many excellent reviews devoted to oncolytic viruses, and the most recent of them are [59] [60] [61] [62] . Therefore, I will only briefly outline the general principles of virotherapy, its advantages and disadvantages. Oncolytic viruses are replication competent, tumor selective and lyse cancer cells. Their potential for anti-cancer therapy is based upon the concept that selective intratumoral replication will produce a potent anti-tumor effect and possibly bystander or remote cell killing, while minimizing normal tissue toxicity. The viral infection and amplification eventually induce cancer cells into cell death pathways and elicit host antitumor immune responses to further help eliminate cancer cells. The use of OV for killing cancer cells is known as (oncolytic) virotherapy. By their ability to amplify and penetrate into surrounding cells, OV differ from conventional drugs that do not amplify themselves and are needed at very high concentrations to affect all tumor cells. Different RNA and DNA viruses are used in virotherapy. Oncolytic virotherapy is a promising form of genetic surgery for cancer, employing nature's own agents to find and destroy malignant cells. Some of the newest additions to the panel of oncolytic viruses include the avian adenovirus, foamy virus, myxoma virus, yaba-like disease virus, echovirus type 1, bovine herpesvirus 4, Saimiri virus, feline panleukopenia virus, Sendai virus and the nonhuman coronaviruses [60] .",

The type I interferons, IFN \u03b1 and IFN \u03b2 , have anti-proliferative properties, and many tumor cells manifest a faulty antiviral response due to disturbances of the interferon (IFN) response system critical components [60] . Defects in these pathways were found in tumors, where they promote cancer growth. Several oncolytic viruses, in particular RNA viruses such as RV, Newcastle disease virus (NDV) and vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) exploit these defects in the IFN pathways. For example, NDV is able to inhibit IFN signaling in avian but not human cells, and is therefore not a human pathogen. NDV can, however, infect and lyse human tumor cells lacking an intact type I IFN response [61] . A deletion of viral genes that counteract IFN has been used also to design oncolytic herpes virus (DNA virus) and influenza virus (RNA virus).",

The most known example are adenoviral vectors deleted in the E1B gene in order to restrict their replication to cells in which the p53 protein function is impaired (see above). Whereas the E1B protein of wild-type adenovirus binds p53 thus preventing apoptosis induction in response to infection, E1B-deleted vectors can replicate productively only in cells lacking functional p53, though this requirement is not absolute [60] . (The mechanism of tumor selectivity now appears more complex, with evidence that E1B has a function in the export of viral RNA. Tumor cells but not normal cells appear to be able to provide the missing export function of E1B). The adenovirus mutant ONYX-015 engineered to lack the E1B protein was one of the first modified viruses to enter clinical trials.",

A virus was constructed containing F-protein with the furin cleavage site replaced by a matrix metalloproteinase 2 (MMP2) cleavage site. As many cancer cells secrete high levels of proteases like MMP2, such a modified virus will be preferentially activated in the vicinity of tumor cells [59, 61] .

It is now about 13 years since the beginning of the first clinical trial in which cancer patients were treated with an oncolytic virus. By 2008, oncolytic viruses from several different species have been taken to phase I and II clinical trials in over 800 cancer patients [58] . These included genetically engineered vaccinia, herpes simplex virus (HSV), adenovirus (all based on human adenovirus serotype 5), and measles, as well as non-engineered viruses such as NDV and RV [79] . Two agents have been most extensively tested in clinical trials (>400 patients by 2008): a first-generation RV (Reolysin, Oncolytics), and a second-generation adenovirus (ONYX-015, an E1B-55 kDa deletion mutant) [62] . Mechanisms which provide viruses with tumor selectivity do not completely preclude infection of normal tissue and consequent toxicity. That is why in the majority of clinical trials the virus was administered by intratumoral (i.t.) injections [79] . Intratumoral delivery of oncolytic viruses provides a further direct physical restriction to enhance tumor selectivity. Although the safety results were encouraging, efficacy of OV as single agents was rather low [58, 80] after both direct intratumoral and intravenous (i.v.) injection, and no systemic spread to distant tumors was detected [61, 62] (see also discussion below). Studies with i.t. administration have generally not demonstrated activity against distant non-injected lesions [79] , greatly limiting the potential of local viral therapy in the treatment of metastatic disease. In an exception to this observation, in patients with metastatic melanoma receiving i.t. injections of GM-CSF armed vaccinia virus (JX-594, JENNEREX), regressions in distant non-injected dermal metastases were noted in four of seven patients treated. These regressing lesions were found to be heavily infiltrated by T lymphocytes. Similarly, in a phase I study of intratumoral administration of a modified HSV expressing GM-CSF, non-injected distant tumor sites became inflamed in 4 of 30 patients [61] . Most of these vectors have proven safe, and phase II studies are ongoing [60] . In total, the observed level of anti-tumor activity, although low, provides encouragement for future oncolytic viral therapy if the route of administration, potency, tumor selectivity and immune interactions can be optimized. In contrast to conventional phase I drug trials, the maximum tolerated dose of virus is commonly not reached, and dose is limited by technical restrictions in the quantity of virus which can be produced [59] .",

            "text": "The bystander effect is the major driving force behind any GDEPT strategy. Numerous studies performed with a variety of suicide gene/prodrug combinations have demonstrated that complete tumor eradication is possible even when the suicide gene product is expressed by less than 10% of the tumor cells [93] . Bystander effects can either be exerted by free diffusion of toxic metabolites or can rely on intercellular communication via gap junctions [22, 87, [94] [95] [96] . It is worth mentioning that interactions between cells are primarily mediated by four types of structures in the plasma membrane: gap junctions, tight junctions, desmosomes, and adherence junctions [97] . Gap junctions are intercellular plasma membrane domains enriched in channels that allow direct exchange of ions and small molecules between adjacent cells. Gap junction channels are composed of a family of transmembrane proteins called connexins [98] . Many tumor cells do not have or have impaired functional gap junctions [98] [99] [100] , therefore free diffusion may have advantages for cancer gene therapy, however, it may also cause off-cancer toxicity due to systemic diffusion. It is important, that the bystander effect can be further potentiated by the immune system, when released foreign and/or tumor antigens from dying cells stimulate the immune system to eliminate tumor cells which do not express the suicide gene, even when these are separated either spatially (the so-called \"distant bystander effect\") or temporally (the so-called \"vaccination effect\") from the suicide gene expressing cells [85] , phenomena which could also lead to the destruction of metastases originating from a primary tumor.",

            "text": "KINASE/GANCICLOVIR AS A CLASSICAL ENZYME/PRODRUG PAIR FOR GENETIC SURGERY The 376 amino acid protein thymidine kinase (tk) encoded by the herpes simplex virus 1 (HSV1) genome is responsible for initiating the phosphorylation of deoxythymidine to deoxythymidine triphosphate for incorporation into nascent DNA. HSVtk has a different catalytic specificity compared to mammalian thymidine kinases, exhibiting around 1000-fold greater efficiency in monophosphorylating ganciclovir (GCV) (Fig. 2) [85] . Expression of HSVtk to activate ganciclovir was used for the first proof-of-principle of suicide gene therapy [101] . Since then, the HSVtk/GCV combination and variations thereof remain the most widely used systems in both clinical and experimental GDEPT applications. Following the monophosphorylation of GCV to GCV-MP by HSVtk, GCV-MP is subsequently further phosphorylated to its diphosphate (GCV-DP) and triphosphate (GCV-TP) forms by endogenous guanylate kinase and several other enzymes such as phosphoglycerate kinase. The cytotoxic effect of GCV results from incorporation of GCV-MP into DNA using GCV-TP as a substrate. The GCV-terminated strands of DNA are not substrates for DNA chain elongation, therefore the elongation of DNA strands is prevented, leading to cell death. The precise mechanism of HSVtk/GCV mediated cell death is still not completely understood. Apart from a few possible exceptions with certain cell types, the death is apoptotic and is probably independent of the p53 pathway. Indeed, tumor cell lines exhibiting mutated p53 are also sensitive to HSVtk vectors, hence this therapeutic strategy can be applied irrespective of the p53 status of the tumors [93] .",

Independent of cell replication, some toxicity of GCV to quiescent cells expressing HSV-tk, such as thyrocytes and hepatocytes, has been reported. The mechanism underlying this phenomenon is not yet clearly understood but could be the consequence of mitochondrial DNA polymerase inhibition. GCV-TP, the most active toxic metabolite of GCV, apart from incorporating into growing DNA chains also exerts its cytotoxic effects intracellularly by inhibiting cellular DNA polymerases. However, replicating DNA is considered to be the major target in cancer cells for GCV activated by HSVtk [83, 85, 93] .",

In spite of this, however, a bystander effect is often still observed both in vitro and in vivo [96] . This is generally due to the transfer of GCV-TP across gap junctions [93] , though some reports indicate that the presence of gap junctions is not obligatory for the bystander effects [22] . The intracellular TK level might influence the bystander effects. The efficiency of GCV killing and the magnitude of the bystander effect were compared for cell lines containing single and double-copy TK. The two copy expressing cells metabolized GCV more efficiently, were more sensitive to GCV, and demonstrated improved bystander killing [22] .",

Several of these trials which used high-titre or replication-competent adenoviral vectors for HSVtk delivery demonstrated encouraging results, including long-term tumor regression and patient survival in retinoblastoma, malignant pleural mesothelioma and glioma therapy. An important result was reported concerning treatment of patients with operable primary or recurrent malignant glioma resulting in statistically significant increase in patient survival times [105] . In this study, 36 patients were enrolled, 17 of which were randomly selected to receive an HSVtk-expressing adenoviral vector injected into a resected tumor site. Subsequent twicedaily intravenous delivery of GCV for 2 weeks led to an increase in mean survival time from 39 weeks in the control group to 71 weeks in the treated group.",

The question is-why? Clearly, a number of factors are responsible for this discrepancy, starting with a very simple one-toxic side effects associated with GCV, especially against bone marrow cells. The GCV doses which can be administered to humans (about 10 mg/kg/day) are much lower than those used in animal experiments (up to 300 mg/kg/day) [106] . Other reasons might be inefficient gene transfer, a larger size of human malignancies as compared with those in murine models, and a slower growth rate of spontaneous tumors compared to experimental xenografts [85, 106] .",

In their comprehensive review [107] , the authors remind us that mice are not small people and then point out at parallels and discrepancies between mouse and human carcinogenesis at the cellular and molecular levels and indicate limitations that are inherent in the mouse models used for elucidating the human disease process. In particular, they note a marked decrease in age-specific cancer rates that has accompanied the substantial increase in lifespan that has occurred during the past 80 million years of the mammalian evolution that led via the primate lineage to humans. This decrease in cancer susceptibility has been accomplished through the development of several distinct antineoplastic mechanisms, many of which are intrinsic to human cells. The authors indicate also that if transformation of murine cells requires far fewer genetic and/or epigenetic alterations to the cell genome, then multistep tumor progression occurring in mice must involve far fewer changes and be far simpler than the comparable processes in humans. Stated differently, these discrepancies in the organization of cell-autonomous regulatory pathways must dictate markedly different courses of tumor progression in the two species. Moreover, the substantially greater number of pathways required to transform human cells means that most of the cellautonomous, anticancer protective mechanisms that are present in human cells must have been developed or at least perfected during the time since our evolutionary lineage diverged from that of rodents.",

In one of such attempts, the tk gene was linked to the gene of another herpes virus protein, VP22. The VP22 protein has been shown to pass freely between cells by an unknown mechanism [22, 119] . It can spread to almost every cell in a monolayer from only a few producer cells. VP22 fusion proteins might function as potent protein delivery systems. Therefore, a VP22-TK construct was tested on different tumor cell lines in vitro and in vivo to improve bystander killing. It has been reported that VP22-TK chimeric proteins spread between cells in quantities sufficient to induce cell death in response to GCV treatment, not only in the primary TK+ cells but also in surrounding TK-cells. This effect was observed in vitro after GCV treatment of transfected tissue culture cells, and in vivo after GCV treatment of mice injected with tumor cells transduced with VP22-TK fusion genes. However, more recent findings indicate that any differences between the action of VP22-TK and wild-type HSV TK are not actually mediated by intercellular trafficking of the fusion protein [120] . However, the idea seems to be fruitful, and recently Luo et al. [121] constructed recombinant HSVtk chimeras fused with the arginine-rich (RXP) repeat of herpes simplex virus type 2 (HSV-2) US11 protein and examined their activity of intercellular trafficking and cytotoxicity. The US11 gene product of herpes simplex virus is an abundant virion structural protein with RNA-binding regulatory activity. Its carboxyl-terminal half consists of tandem tripeptide repeats of the RXP sequence. It was demonstrated that the US11 protein had intercellular trafficking activity and that the RXP repeats were responsible for this activity. These same properties were also observed in cells expressing a fusion protein linking US11 to the green fluorescent protein [122] . When examining the immunofluorescence staining patterns of RXP-TK fusion proteins in transfected COS7 cells, the RXP chimeras revealed a conservation of the trafficking activity of RXP [121] .",

Another antiherpes drug, aciclovir (ACV), is less immunosuppressive and generally much better tolerated than GCV, but HSV TK displays a much higher K m value for ACV than for GCV. Therefore, HSV TK mutants with increased specificity for GCV or ACV have been found and characterized, and some of them are already in clinical use. Of these, the most extensively evaluated one is 43-fold more sensitive to GCV and 20-fold more sensitive to ACV than the parental HSV TK [126] . New mutant enzymes are being revealed [127, 128] , one of them displaying 124-fold decrease in K m with aciclovir as the substrate [127] . Such new \"prodrug kinases\" could provide benefit to genetic surgery making it feasible to use relatively non-SVERDLOV toxic aciclovir at nanomolar concentrations or ganciclovir at lower, less immunosuppressive doses.",

            "text": "UTILIZATION OF TWO ENZYME/PRODRUG COMBINATIONS An evident way to overcome the GCV resistance is the use of HSV TK/GCV genetic surgery with another enzyme/prodrug combination. One of the promising complements is the bacterial or yeast cytosine deaminase (CD) gene, associated with the prodrug 5-fluorocytosine (5FC), which also is a most widely used suicide system in gene therapy [69, 84, 85, 106] . Cytosine deaminase (CD) is found in bacteria and fungi, but not in mammalian cells. It catalyzes the deamination of cytosine to uracil and ammonia. Both bacterial and yeast CD deaminate 5-FC, a low-toxic drug used in human medicine to control fungal infections, to 5-fluorouracil (5-FU), a chemotherapeutic agent with radiosensitizing properties used to treat carcinomas in humans. 5-FU is then either converted via a multistep process to 5-fluoro-2'-deoxyuridine-5'-monophosphate (5-FdUMP), an irreversible inhibitor of thymidylate synthase, or phosphorylated to 5-fluorouridine-5'-triphosphate (5-FUTP). Thymidylate synthase inhibition by 5-FdUMP results in thymidine starvation, which subsequently prevents DNA synthesis. 5-FUTP can be incorporated into RNA in place of UTP, resulting in the inhibition of nuclear processing of rRNA and mRNA. In addition, the precursor of 5-FUTP, 5-FUDP, can be further metabolized to 5-FdUTP, which is subsequently incorporated into nascent DNA, resulting in DNA damage. There are also other ways of 5-FU catabolism but the reader can find them in the above cited reviews. Recent studies on the problems of efficiency and resistance to the treatment with either HSV TK or CD systems suggest that TK/GCV and CD/5-FC-induced apoptosis does neither require p53 nor death receptors, but converges at a mitochondrial pathway triggered by different mechanisms of modulation of Bcl-2 proteins [142] . GDEPT using CD also involves a strong 5-FU mediated bystander effect, and, since 5-FU can readily move out of and into cells by non-facilitated diffusion, direct cell to cell contact and functional GJIC are not prerequisites for this process. There are data indicating that besides the 5-FU-mediated bystander effect, a distant bystander effect involving natural killer cells as the major immune component contributes to the success of this therapy [85] .",

Targeting has been intensively reviewed in [144] [145] [146] [147] [148] [149] [150] . Viral vectors, which usually do not have a natural tropism for tumor tissue, were gener-ated to carry tumor targeting molecules on their surface. Targeting to receptors unique to or overexpressed on tumors was discussed above in the part devoted to oncolytic viruses.

The Moloney murine leukemia virus (MoMLV) envelope (env) protein was engineered to incorporate a high-affinity collagen-binding domain derived from vWF. The chimeric virions were capable of binding collagen matrices, and retained their infectivity [158] . When administered by portal vein infusion, vector particles accumulated in the angiogenic tumor vasculature within 1 hour of infusion [159, 160, 164, 166] . The \"pathotropic targeting\" introduces a new paradigm in cancer gene therapy. An exposed collagen targeted vector carrying a dominant mutant cyclin G1 gene as a therapeutic gene, aimed at the suppression of the cyclin G1 cellular function, was referred to as Rexin-G. The ability of Rexin-SVERDLOV G to reach and safely impact metastatic disease was demonstrated in preclinical and clinical trials [161] [162] [163] [164] [165] .",

The development of new vector systems and other improvements of techniques within the strategy may certainly give new, additional opportunities for more successful clinical applications.
