After the first confirmed case reported on February 20 th 2020 in Codogno, a small town near Milan, the rapid diffusion of the infection prompted the Italian Government to proclaim a national lockdown on 9 th March 2020, forcing the entire population to severe restrictive isolation measures. These measures, certainly helpful in reducing the diffusion of SARS-CoV-2 infection, significantly modified the patients' response to non-SARS-CoV-2 medical conditions, including acute coronary syndrome (ACS) (2) . Since ACS is a lifethreatening condition with outcome strictly dependent on prompt recognition and treatment, under-or misdiagnosis and late or missed treatment might be deleterious. In the current study we report data from high-volume hospitals from three variably affected regions Piedmont, Marche and Tuscany in order to evaluate changes in ACS-hospitalization rate during the first month of the SARS-CoV-2 Italian outbreak.",

Categorical variables were compared using the \u03c7square test. Incidence rate (IR) for ACS related hospitalization was calculated by dividing the number of cumulative events by the number of days for both time periods. A P value < 0.05 was considered statistically significant. Statistical analysis was performed using SPSS 26 (IBM Corporation, Armonk, NY, USA). There were no significant differences in patient clinical characteristics or risk factors in the two groups. In March-2019 NSTEMI was a more frequent admission diagnosis (57.4%vs39.3%, p< 0.01) and symptom to PCI was significantly shorter (18.8+20 vs 36.9+38.4 hours, p<0.001). In the STEMI subgroup, door-to-balloon and symptoms-to-balloons were significantly higher in March-2020 (66+17vs40+12min , p< 0.001 and 5.8+3.1hours vs 3.9+2.2 hours, p<0.001- Figure   1 ) with a delay from symptoms to wiring for STEMI-PCI >24 hours more frequent in March 2020 (17.8% vs 4.3%, p<0.001). The GRACE score was significantly higher in 2020 (126+27vs116+26, p<0.001) and more patients were in the higher ESC tertile predictive of higher in-hospital and 6-month mortality (GRACE score above 140: 33.3%vs18.5, p<0.01 and GRACE score above 118: 59.6vs44.4%, p<0.05).",

Numbers were too small and follow-up too short to show a survival difference at discharge or in the first month. The higher release of cardiac enzymes, more severe LVEF impairment and more frequent GRACE scores in the group with predicted higher 6-month mortality suggest high likelihood of a worse outcome at late follow-up. The time delay in the door-to-balloon of 10 extra minutes, probably explained by the need to carefully wear personal protective equipment was sufficient to be statistically significant compared with 2019 but unlikely to cause a clinically relevant worsening in prognosis. We have applied in these patients the same aggressive approach recommended in the current ESC-Guidelines. In Sichuan Provincial People's Hospital, a conservative approach with frequent use of thrombolysis was applied in most ACS-STEMI/NSTEMI syndromes certainly a suboptimal treatment in the urgent/primary PCI era. Possibly the fact that dedicated COVID-hospitals were created led to a dedicated path of treatment that made it difficult to retransfer patients already in a COVID-area into hospitals with PCI facilities, a problem not present in any of the three hospitals recruiting for this study (2) . The marked reduction of ACS-complications observed in the last decades are certainly justified by the widespread diffusion of an emergency network allowing most of our population to an early reperfusion therapy. If our findings will be confirmed in large scale registries, we might expect to face an increase of serious myocardial impairment that will represent a new challenge for the entire cardiological community.",

A larger sample size including more hospitals and multiple inter-year and intra-year control periods would have certainly improved the statistical power of our findings, but the reduction of ACS-hospitalization during the first three months of the Italian lockdown has been confirmed by our recently published large North Italian registry (1) Stay home is an important message able to contain spreading of the virus but this message should be tempered by a clear exclusion of chest pain and other medical emergencies that still require rapid in hospital treatment.

Viral infections and ACS share the development of a peak during winter as clearly shown by epidemiological studies and meta-analyses that suggest a significant increase in ACS-STEMI in patients affected by seasonal flu when compared with the remaining population (3, 4). SARS-CoV-2 infection shares many similarities with other coronaviruses infection such as SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, both responsible for increase in acute cardiovascular events rate in infected patients (5). Patients with SARS-CoV-2 infections also develop a general pro-inflammatory and hypercoagulative status explaining the frequent acute coronary events observed in-hospital (2). The opposite phenomenon of a paradoxical reduction observed can have several possible explanations. Firstly, the fear of risking a close contact with infected SARS-CoV-2 patients might have discouraged the access to the emergency room in case of mild symptoms of chest pain or breathlessness. Secondly, the insistence on isolation at home may have deterred patients to seek consultations with their general practitioner or undergo examinations such as ECG or echocardiography. Mild clinical ACS-symptoms such as dyspnea, chest tightness associated with increased myocardial enzymes and without clear ECG changes could have been dismissed as a consequence of widespread viral organ involvement and the overstress suffered by the National Health Service might have impacted at least for the most crucial days of mid-March on the timing of transportation and hospital admission. Unfortunately, underdiagnosis and late or missed treatment might be deleterious for ACS-patients, a life-threatening condition with outcome closely related to prompted recognition and treatment. Untreated ACS might result in both acute and long-term complications such as cardiac rupture, pericardial tamponade, mitral regurgitation, aneurysmal dilatation and marked reduction in LVEF resulting in immediate cardiogenic shock",
