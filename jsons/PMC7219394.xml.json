For instance, chloroquine/hydroxychloroquine (CQ)/(HCQ),2 tocilizumab,3 lopinavir/ritonavir,4 or remdesivir.5 The message regarding the pharmacotherapy of hospitalized patients with COVID-19 is clear; unfortunately, it could be regarded as unenthusiastic because there is no accurate and sufficient evidence to recommend any specific treatment for patients. Similarly, a recent rapid systematic review of clinical trials utilizing chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine as a treatment for COVID-19 concluded that: \u201cthere is currently not enough data available to support the routine use of HCQ andCQ as therapies for COVID-19\u201d.6\n",
