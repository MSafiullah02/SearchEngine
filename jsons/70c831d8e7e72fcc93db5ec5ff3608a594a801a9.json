E3L is highly conserved among orthopoxviruses and hence could provide important protective T-cell epitopes that should be retained in any subunit or attenuated vaccine. We have therefore evaluated the immunogenicity of E3L in healthy VV vaccinated donors. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells from healthy volunteers (n=13) who had previously received a smallpox vaccine (Dryvax \u00ae ) were activated and expanded using overlapping E3L peptides and their function, specificity and anti-viral activity was analyzed. E3L-specific T-cells were expanded from 7 of 12 (58.3%) vaccinated healthy donors. 25% of these produced CD8+ T-cell responses and 87.5% produced CD4+ T-cells. We identified epitopes restricted by HLA-B35 and HLA-DR15.",

Hence, there is significant interest in a less pathogenic, but equally immunogenic vaccine. The highly attenuated modified vaccinia Ankara (MVA) has proved safe in HIV-infected persons and is a promising alternative vaccine [11] . However, having lost up to 15% of its genome after extensive passage in chicken embryo fibroblasts [12, 13] , it cannot replicate in human cells and therefore requires doses over 100 fold higher than for Dryvax \u00ae and booster vaccination to provide equivalent protection in animal models [14, 15] .",

An E3L deletion mutant provided a promising attenuated vaccine that was safe and effective in murine and rabbit infection models, but it did not prevent lethal infections in a monkeypox model [17] . Since E3L is expressed within 0.5 hours of infection by VV [18] , it should be processed and presented to the cellular immune responses before immune evasion genes of VV are expressed and allow T cell killing before newly replicated virus is released from infected cells. If so, this may explain the lack of efficacy of E3L deletion mutant vaccines. Hence, E3L and other immediate early genes, might provide important, protective T-cell epitopes that should be preserved in any live-attenuated or subunit vaccine. The identification of viral proteins that induce protective T-cells and are recognized by a majority of immune humans would be useful for the development of subunit or deletion mutant vaccines, might determine the relative importance of each arm of the immune response and assist in the monitoring and evaluation of effective T-cell responses to vaccination.",

However, position 5 is a nonanchor position and VV E3L-NPVTVINEY-specific T-cells recognized the variola epitope and should therefore provide protection not only against VV, but also variola and monkeypox. E3L-specific T-cells could kill peptide-loaded target cells as well as VVinfected cells and could prevent the spread of infectious virus in a cell culture system. By contrast, although CD8+ T-cells specific for an early VV protein, C7L and a late/virion protein A10L were able to kill vaccinia-infected cells, they were unable to prevent VV amplification and infectious virus spread. CD4+ T-cells specific for E3L, H3L, G5R and A10L were detected, but were unable to kill infected target cells nor prevent infectious virus spread in our assays ( Table 2 ). This suggests that simple induction of a T-cell immune response to a viral antigen by vaccination may not guarantee that the vaccine will be effective. presented by infected cell before the expression of the many immune evasion genes encoded by poxviruses, they may never be presented on infected cells and will have little biological relevance [37] [38] [39] [40] . In our assay, CD8+ T-cells specific for C7L and A10L, expressed early and late respectively were able to kill virus-infected LCLs, but while Tcells specific for B22R, expressed early, were able to kill pepmix-pulsed LCLs, they could not kill VV-infected LCLs. B22R may not be expressed early enough in the viral replicative cycle to escape viral inhibition of antigen processing, while recognition of the late protein, A10L may be explained by its abundant presence in the virion. Thus A10L core antigens enter the cell at the time of infection and will be among the first proteins processed and presented to the immune response.",

As a result of these studies the NIAID compiled a bank of potential HLA class I-restricted VV epitopes that were identified using the SYTHPETHI and Bioinformatics and Molecular Analysis Section of the National Institutes of Health BIMAS (www-bimas.cit.nih.gov) algorithms [46] . However, in our hands, when tested in VV-immune individuals with appropriate HLA alleles, only one of these epitopes elicited a T-cell response (not shown). We therefore took a different approach to the identification of protective epitopes and hypothesized that the viral proteins first presented to the immune system after infection were most likely to induce protective T-cells. These antigens would include virion proteins carried into the infected cell during infection as well as immediate early proteins expressed rapidly after infection. Of immediate early proteins, the most abundant are likely to be most immunogenic. E3L is abundantly detected within 0.5 hours of infection, potentially before the many immune evasion genes of VV take their effect and is also carried in the virion so that it can exert its immune evasion functions promptly. E3L inhibits innate immunity to poxvirus infection by inhibiting interferon responses to dsRNA and downstream activation of MAP kinase and NF\uf06bB pathways [16, 47, 48] . We predicted that because of its abundance and rapid expression, E3L would induce T-cells that could protect against virus infection. Indeed CD8+ E3L-specific T-cells were able to kill newly infected cells and prevent infectious VV spread in autologous LCLs. respectively. There are other potential epitopes within E3L with higher (better) scores, restricted by other HLA alleles. However, these epitopes were not detected by our Tcells even though our donor panel carried the predicted HLA alleles.",

(A) The cytotoxic activity of C7L-and E3Lspecific CD8+ T-cells from donor 2 against VV infected or pepmix-pulsed, HLA-HLA-B35 matched allogeneic donor LCL in all the conditions of 2, 4 and 8 hours after infection with VV. Only E3L prevented VV replication in co-culture virus inhibition assay (right panel). (B) B22R-specific CD8+ T-cells from donor 4 were able to kill pepmix pulsed-but not VV-infected LCLs in chromium release assay (left panel, and were unable to prevent infectious virus spread in cocultures (right panel) (C) The cytotoxic activity and viral inhibition assay of A10L-specific CD8+ T-cells from donor 5. A10L-specific CD8+ T-cells killed pepmixpulsed LCLs and VV infected LCLs if added 8 hrs after LCL infection, but did not kill VV infected LCL when added 2 or 4 hrs after infection with VV. A10L-specific T-cells did not prevent infectious virus spread in infected LCLs. (D) CD4+ T-cells from donor 4 that were specific for A10L-, H3L-, G5R-and E3L as measured by IFN-\u03b3 ELISPOT (left panel) did not prevent VV replication in coculture with VV-infected autologous LCLs (right panel). (E) CD4+ T-cells from donor 5 secreted IFN-\u03b3 in response to A10L-, H3L-and E3L in ELISPOT assays (left panel) did not inhibit VV replication in cocultures with VV-infected autologous LCLs.",
