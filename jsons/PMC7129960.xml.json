In addition, DNA viruses, such as adenovirus, polyomavirus, and bocavirus, may also be responsible for cases of respiratory tract infection. While the majority of infections due to CARV are restricted to the upper respiratory tract (URT), SOT recipients, due to alterations in cellular and humoral immunity, are at a higher risk of developing progression to the lower respiratory tract (LRT) 2. CARV LRT infections are associated with significant morbidity in SOT recipients. Specifically in lung transplant recipients, CARV LRT infections may be associated with a higher incidence of chronic lung allograft dysfunction (CLAD), although the literature on this topic is controversial 3.

Infection with influenza virus can occur at any time after transplantation, and it appears to be most severe in the early post\u2010transplant period (<3 months) 10. The risk of influenza is also related to the type of organ transplant. In a study involving 3569 SOT recipients, the incidence of influenza was 41.8, 4.3 and 2.8 cases/1000 person\u2010years among lung, kidney and liver transplant recipients, respectively 4. Similarly, studies performed during the pandemic documented that the incidence of influenza A/H1N1 infection was higher in recipients of lungs (30\u2013400 cases per 1000 person\u2010years) than in recipients of other organs, such as the kidney (19\u201322 cases per 1000 person\u2010years), liver (29 cases per 1000 person\u2010years) or heart (37 cases per 1000 patient\u2010years) 11, 12.

Influenza should be clinically suspected in all SOT recipients presenting with respiratory symptoms such as fever, rhinorrhea, cough and sore throat, with or without myalgias and headaches and dyspnoea during the influenza season 4, 15. However, fever may be missing, and the usually abrupt onset may be delayed in immunocompromised patients 16. Therefore, a proposal has been made to modify the definitions of influenza\u2010like illness provided by the ECDC to better capture the presentation in immunocompromised patients 17. Basically, the definition of CARV disease includes: (i) a new onset of symptoms and (ii) at least one of the following four respiratory symptoms (cough, sore throat, shortness of breath and coryza) and (iii) the clinician's judgment that the illness is due to an infection. The occurrence of pneumonia in SOT recipients with influenza infection ranges from 14% to 49%, and bilateral involvement is frequently observed 4, 5, 6. Bacterial, viral or fungal co\u2010infection is relatively common in SOT recipients and reported co\u2010infection frequency ranges from 7% to 29% 5, 18. An increased risk of acute and chronic allograft rejection also has been associated with infection by influenza and other respiratory viruses 4, 5, 11. In lung transplant recipients, influenza has been linked to the occurrence of chronic lung allograft dysfunction (CLAD) 12, 19, although not consistently in all studies 3. Other less frequent complications of influenza in SOT recipients include encephalitis, myocarditis and myositis. Influenza in SOT recipients has been associated with high rates of medical complications and even mortality 4, 5, 6. The main risk factors associated with impaired outcomes are the presence of pneumonia and diabetes mellitus, the use of antilymphocyte globulin (<6 months), and delayed antiviral therapy 10.",

The few studies assessing the clinical effectiveness of influenza vaccine in SOT recipients have reported an overall low rate of clinical failures of vaccination (ranging from 1.1% to 3.6% with the use of adjuvanted vaccines during the pandemic), although this is also dependent on the matching between the vaccine and the circulating strains 30, 31. In addition, patients who developed symptomatic influenza infection after vaccination had a 70% reduced risk of subsequent pneumonia 32. In a large registry of kidney transplant recipients, influenza vaccination during the first year after transplantation was associated with a reduced incidence of graft loss and mortality 33. However, data on the immunogenicity of influenza vaccination in the transplant population are controversial and most published studies suggest that a reduced humoral immune response is expected in SOT recipients 29, 34. Lung transplant recipients appear to have a poorer response than recipients of other allografts, probably related to the higher degree of immunosuppression needed after lung transplantation and the allogeneic constellation between virus\u2010infected host cells and effector T cells 8. The use of mycophenolate mofetil and mTOR inhibitors has been related to a weaker response to influenza vaccine in some studies 8, 35, 36, but not in others 37.

This recommendation is made irrespective of the duration of the symptoms and the severity of illness. In any case, antiviral treatment of influenza\u2010like illness should not be delayed by waiting for microbiological confirmation, but rather discontinued when appropriate test results are negative. Early specific antiviral treatment should be especially encouraged in cases of pneumonia. Two classes of antiviral drugs are currently approved for treatment of influenza infection: M2 inhibitors (amantadine and rimantadine), which are active only against influenza A, and neuraminidase inhibitors (oseltamivir and zanamivir). Other drugs under investigation are parenteral zanamivir and peramivir. M2 inhibitors are not currently recommended due to resistance of most circulating influenza A strains and the variable, but at times predominant, circulation of influenza B. Neuraminidase inhibitors are usually well tolerated, with the most common adverse effects being gastrointestinal symptoms. In children, the use of oseltamivir has been associated with neuropsychiatric adverse events. Inhaled zanamivir (two puffs, 10 mg, twice daily) does not require dose adjustment either for hepatic or renal failure. Oral oseltamivir (75 mg twice daily) dose adjustment is not needed in hepatic impairment but doses should be modified in renal insufficiency according to the recommendations included in Table 3. Proven benefits of higher doses of oseltamivir in SOT recipients with severe influenza infection are lacking 43. If available, intravenous zanamivir or peramivir can be considered in SOT recipients who are severely ill despite oral oseltamivir, in patients in whom oral absorption is a concern, or in those with suspected or confirmed oseltamivir resistance. Duration of antiviral therapy is 5 days in mild cases of influenza, but it can be prolonged in more severe cases with protracted evolution until viral load in the nasopharyngeal swab is undetectable. Pregnancy is not a contraindication for the administration of oseltamivir and pregnant women should be encouraged to receive influenza vaccination.",

            "text": "The use of ribavirin for the treatment of RSV infection is controversial. Nevertheless, some experts consider ribavirin for the treatment of severe forms of LRT disease in SOT recipients 17. Aerosolized ribavirin can be administered as 2 g for 2 h every 8 h or as 6 g over 18 h/day for 7\u201310 days. Appropriate precautions should be taken to avoid environmental teratogenic exposure in pregnant healthcare workers and visitors when aerosolized ribavirin is used. A few reports have reported the use of systemic ribavirin for RSV disease: orally or intravenously as 10\u201330 mg/kg of body weight in three divided doses 46, 47, 48, 49, 50. Patients treated with systemic ribavirin should be checked for haemolysis, abnormal liver function and kidney failure. Of note, there are few data about the potential impact of the use of ribavirin on the prevention of indirect effects in lung transplant recipients with RSV infection 51.",
