The continuous development of medicine, the use of sophisticated methodologic tools, the increasing need for cutting-edge evidence-based medicine (which cannot be achieved with case reports), and the continuous restrictions from journals on case reports all have contributed to the \u201cdiminishing value\u201d of case reports. However, a few questions remain to be answered here. Should authors stop reporting their unique cases? Should journals stop accepting such unusual cases? Are we in an era where there is no more scientific value in case reports?",

            "text": "Looking back at history, we find various diseases and discoveries that were described initially as case reports. The perfect example of this is Cushing disease. In 1910, Dr. Harvey Cushing first encountered the disease in a 23-year-old woman, who is historically known as \u201cMinnie G.\u201d The patient had an unusual and complex clinical presentation in the form of obesity, hypertrichosis, amenorrhea, overdevelopment of secondary sexual characteristics, low-grade hydrocephalus, and increased cerebral tension.2, 3 Such an unusual clinical combination was not yet described by any medical disorder at the time, which stimulated Cushing to begin his lifelong interest and extensive research and investigations. Cushing was confident that Minnie's unusual presentation was due to a problem of the pituitary gland. Because of Minnie's case and similar unusual cases reported in the literature, Cushing's efforts eventually culminated in 1932 in his pivotal work, \u201cThe basophil adenomas of the pituitary gland and their clinical manifestations (pituitary basophilism).\u201d4 In his article, Cushing described 2 cases from his own experience (Minnie G. was the first case) along with 10 other cases reported in the literature.4 Because of such single case reports, the clinical symptoms of the disease were described and were named after Cushing.4 Not only did Minnie G. aid in discovering a new syndrome, but her very unusual long-term survival intrigued Carney5 to speculate that she might have had the Carney complex of primary pigmented nodular adrenocortical disease.",
