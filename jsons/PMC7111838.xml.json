The mortality rates of the disease reached as high as 15% in some age groups (Anand et al., 2003). The etiological agent of the disease was found to be a novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV), which was first isolated from infected individuals by propagation of the virus on Vero E6 cells (Drosten et al., 2003, Ksiazek et al., 2003, Peiris et al., 2003). Analysis of the viral genome has demonstrated that the SARS-CoV is phylogenetically divergent from the three known antigenic groups of coronaviruses (Drosten et al., 2003, Ksiazek et al., 2003). Analysis of the polymerase gene alone, however, has indicated that the SARS-CoV may be an early off-shoot from the group 2 coronaviruses (Snijder et al., 2003).",

The S glycoprotein is primarily responsible for entry of all coronaviruses into susceptible cells through binding to specific receptors on cells and mediating subsequent virus-cell fusion (Cavanagh, 1995). The S glycoprotein specified by mouse hepatitis virus (MHV) is cleaved into S1 and S2 subunits, although cleavage is not necessarily required for virus-cell fusion (Bos et al., 1997, Gombold et al., 1993, Stauber et al., 1993). Similarly, the SARS-CoV S glycoprotein seems to be cleaved into S1 and S2 subunits in Vero-E6-infected cells (Wu et al., 2004), while it is not known whether this cleavage affects S-mediated cell fusion. The SARS-CoV receptor has been recently identified as the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) (Li et al., 2003). Although the exact mechanism by which the SARS-CoV enters the host cell has not been elucidated, it is most likely similar to other coronaviruses. Upon receptor binding at the cell membrane, the S glycoprotein is thought to undergo a dramatic conformational change causing exposure of a hydrophobic fusion peptide, which is subsequently inserted into cellular membranes. This conformational change of the S glycoprotein causes close apposition followed by fusion of the viral and cellular membranes resulting in entry of the virion nucleocapsids into cells (Eckert and Kim, 2001, Tsai et al., 2003, Zelus et al., 2003). This series of S-mediated virus entry events is similar to other class I virus fusion proteins (Baker et al., 1999, Melikyan et al., 2000, Russell et al., 2001).",

            "text": "Heptad repeat (HR) regions, a sequence motif characteristic of coiled-coils, appear to be a common motif in many viral and cellular fusion proteins (Skehel and Wiley, 1998). These coiled-coil regions allow the protein to fold back upon itself as a prerequisite step to initiating the membrane fusion event. There are usually two HR regions: an N terminal HR region adjacent to the fusion peptide and a C-terminal HR region close to the transmembrane region of the protein. Within the HR segments, the first amino acid (a) and fourth amino acid (d) are typically hydrophobic amino acids that play a vital role in maintaining coiled-coil interactions. Based on structural similarities, two classes of viral fusion proteins have been established. Class I viral fusion proteins contain two heptad repeat regions and an N-terminal or N-proximal fusion peptide. Class II viral fusion proteins lack heptad repeat regions and contain an internal fusion peptide (Lescar et al., 2001). The MHV S glycoprotein, which is similar to other coronavirus S glycoproteins, is a class I membrane protein that is transported to the plasma membrane after being synthesized in the endoplasmic reticulum (Bosch et al., 2003). Typically, the ectodomains of the S2 subunits of coronaviruses contain two regions with a 4, 3 hydrophobic (heptad) repeat the first being adjacent to the fusion peptide and the other being in close proximity to the transmembrane region (de Groot et al., 1987).",

Specifically, to investigate the amino-acid requirements of the HR1 of the SARS-CoV S glycoprotein, the a and d amino-acid positions L(898) and N(901) were both replaced by lysine residues in the cluster mutation CL2, effectively collapsing the predicted \u03b1-helical structure at the amino terminal terminus of the HR. This amino-acid sequence is thought to align with the L(1184) of HR2 in the formation of the HR1/HR2 core complex (Xu et al., 2004). In addition, cluster-to-lysine mutations CL3 and CL4 replaced the a and d positions within the HR1 region (Fig. 1B). The CL5 cluster mutation was placed adjacent to the HR1 region to investigate whether regions proximal to HR1 had any effect on S-mediated cell fusion. Similarly, the role of the a and d positions within the predicted fusion peptide, located immediately proximal to the N terminus of HR1, was investigated by constructing the CL1 cluster mutation (Fig. 1B).",

Specifically, for coronaviruses, the MHV S glycoprotein endodomain has been shown to contain charged-rich and cysteine-rich regions, which are critical for fusion of infected cells (Bos et al., 1995, Chang et al., 2000, Ye et al., 2004). The carboxyl-terminal portion of the S glycoprotein contains a consensus acidic amino-acid cluster with a motif that has been predicted by the NetPhos 2.0 software to be phosphorylated (Blom et al., 1999). To investigate the potential role of the acidic amino-acid cluster in synthesis, transport, and cell fusion, serial truncations of S were constructed. The acidic cluster was specifically targeted by mutagenizing the predicted phosphorylation site embedded within the acidic cluster as well as by replacing acidic residues of the acidic cluster with alanine residues. In addition, carboxyl-terminal truncations of 8, 17, 26, and 41 amino acids were engineered by insertion of stop codons within the S glycoprotein gene. The 8 aa truncation (T1247) was designed to bring the predicted charged cluster DEDDSE proximal to the carboxyl terminus of the mutated S glycoprotein (Fig. 1C). Similarly, the 17 aa truncation (T1238) was designed to delete the DEDDSE acidic cluster. The SARS-CoV S glycoprotein endodomain contains two cysteine residue clusters, a CCMTSCCSC (CRM1) cluster immediately adjacent to the membrane and a CSCGSCC (CRM2) downstream of the first cluster. To address the role of these domains in S glycoprotein-mediated cell-to-cell fusion, the 26 aa truncation (T1229) was designed to delete the CRM2 domain, while the 41 aa truncation (T1214) deleted both the CRM1 and CRM2 domains (Fig. 1C).",

Cellular lysates prepared from transfected cells at 48 h post-transfection were electrophoretically separated by SDS-PAGE and the S glycoproteins were detected via chemiluminescence using a monoclonal antibody specific for the SARS-CoV S glycoprotein. Carbohydrate addition was shown to occur in at least four different locations of the SARS-CoV S glycoprotein (Krokhin et al., 2003, Ying et al., 2004). Furthermore, transiently expressed S glycoprotein in Vero E6 cells was proteolytically cleaved into S1 and S2 components (Wu et al., 2004). The anti-S monoclonal antibody SW-111 detected a protein species in cellular extracts from transfected cells, which migrated with an apparent molecular mass of approximately 180 kDa, as reported previously (Song et al., 2004). All mutated S glycoproteins produced similar S-related protein species to that of the wild-type S indicating that none of the engineered mutations adversely affect S synthesis and intracellular processing (Fig. 2A). The SARS S glycoprotein is known to form homotrimers in its native state (Song et al., 2004). To investigate the effect of the mutations on S oligomerization, cellular lysates from transfected cells were electrophoretically separated without prior boiling of the samples and in the absence of reducing agents (Song et al., 2004). The different S species were detected via chemiluminescence using the monoclonal SW-111 to the SARS S glycoprotein. An S protein species was detected that had an approximate apparent molecular mass of 500 kDa, which was consistent with previously published data (Song et al., 2004) (Fig. 2B). Although levels of oligomer expression seemed to vary slightly between mutant forms, all mutated S glycoproteins produced similar species to the wild type, indicating that none of the mutations blocked oligomerization from occurring.",

A recombinant S protein having the 3xFLAG added in-frame to the carboxyl terminus of S was used as a negative control, since it would not be stained by the live cell reaction conditions (see Materials and methods). Both wild-type versions of S having the 3xFLAG, either at the amino or carboxyl terminus of S, caused similar amounts of fusion (Fig. 3\n), which also was similar to that obtained with the untagged wild-type S (not shown). The relative amounts of cell-surface versus total cellular expression of S were obtained through the use of an ELISA. A ratio between the cell-surface localized S and total cellular S expression was then calculated and normalized to the corresponding ratio obtained with the wild-type S glycoprotein (see Materials and methods) (Fig. 4\n). The CL1 (95%), CL2 (78%), CL3 (86%), CL4 (80%), CL5 (92%), CL6 (86%) mutants as well as the T1229 (91%), T1238 (94%), and T1247 (79%) truncations were expressed on the cellular surface by the percentages indicated when compared to the cell-surface expression of the wild-type protein.

These mutations included CL7, which modified the acidic cluster and the T1229 truncations that deleted the cysteine-rich motif CRM2; (3) the single S mutant in Group III, T1214, produced significantly less cell-surface expression and concomitantly the average size of syncytia was substantially reduced in comparison to the wild-type S; (4) the T1238 truncation in Group IV produced high levels of cell-surface expression equivalent to that of the wild type (94% of the wild-type S), while the average syncytium size was 43% larger than that the syncytial produced by the wild-type S (Table 1).",

In this assay, cell-surface-expressed S was reacted with anti-FLAG antibody at 4 \u00b0C and subsequently, cells were incubated at 37 \u00b0C for different time periods before processing for confocal microscopy (see Materials and methods). Generally, these time-dependent endocytosis studies were in agreement with the results shown in Fig. 6. Specifically, in cells that were not shifted to 37 \u00b0C, referred to as time zero cells, wild-type and mutant spike were detected exclusively at the surface of the cells (Fig. 7\n, panels A1, B1, C1, D1, E1, F1). At 5 and 15 min after the shift to 37 \u00b0C, the wild-type S remained exclusively at the surface while the other S mutants were detected in numerous intracellular vesicles dispersed inside the cell (Fig. 7, panels A2 and A3 compared to panels B2 and B3, C2 and C3, D2 and D3, E2 and E3, F2 and F3). By 60 min after the shift to 37 \u00b0C, the wild-type S was still localized exclusively to the surface of the cell (Fig. 7, panel A4), while the T1229, T1238, CL6, and CL7 S mutants appeared to be present throughout the cytoplasm of the cell (Fig. 7, panels B4, C4, E4, F4). The T1247 S mutant seemed to undergo rapid and complete endocytosis during the 60 min observation and appeared to localize into punctuate structures in the cytoplasm of cells unlike the fairly even cellular distribution of all other S mutants (Fig. 7, panels D1\u2013D4 compared to panels A4, B4, C4, D4, E4, and F4).",

Biochemical and X-ray crystallography studies have shown that the HR1 and HR2 form a stable six-helix bundle, in which the HR1 helices form a central coiled-coil surrounded by three HR2 helices in an oblique, antiparallel manner termed the fusion core (Ingallinella et al., 2004, Tripet et al., 2004, Xu et al., 2004), which is consistent with other class I fusion proteins (Baker et al., 1999, Bullough et al., 1994, Caffrey et al., 1998, Chan et al., 1997, Lu et al., 1995, Tan et al., 1997, Weissenhorn et al., 1998a, Weissenhorn et al., 1998b, Weissenhorn et al., 1997). Amino-acid residues 902\u2013947 in the SARS-CoV S HR1 domain fold into a predicted 12-turn \u03b1-helix (entire length of the fusion core) with hydrophobic amino acids predominantly occupying the a and d positions. The CL3 and CL4 mutations were designed to change the a and d hydrophobic residues to hydrophilic (lysine) residues. Both mutant glycoproteins were expressed on cell surfaces at reduced levels in comparison to the wild-type S glycoprotein (14% and 20% reduction, respectively). However, these mutations inhibited S-mediated fusion by 68% and 71%, respectively (Table 1; Group I mutants). Therefore, the inability of the CL3 and CL4 mutants to cause fusion is most likely due to ectodomain structural changes involving the HR1 domain. Inhibition of proper HR1 interaction with HR2 may be the primary cause of the observed inhibition of S-mediated cell fusion.",

This S mutant exhibited a 65% reduction in cell fusion in comparison to the wild-type S, while cell-surface expression was reduced by 20% in comparison to the wild-type S (Table 1; Group I mutants). Kinetic endocytosis experiments revealed that the T1247 S mutant also endocytosed much faster than the wild-type S glycoprotein. Acidic cluster motifs are known to serve as endocytotic signals (Brideau et al., 1999, Zhu et al., 1996). The rapid endocytosis of the T1247 S mutant form may be due to the relocation of the acidic cluster KFDEDDSE proximal to the carboxyl terminus of the S glycoprotein after removal of the terminal 8 amino acids resulting in more efficient endocytosis. Therefore, the inability of the S mutant form to cause extensive cell fusion may be due primarily to its rapid endocytosis from cell surfaces. It is worth noting that a similar deletion of 8 amino acids from the carboxyl terminus of the MHV S glycoprotein resulted in enhanced S-mediated cell fusion (Chang et al., 2000). A comparison of the carboxyl-terminal amino-acid sequences of these two glycoproteins reveals that the MHV S does not have a well-defined acidic cluster in the SARS-COV S homologous location; however, the last three amino acids of the MHV S are charged residues (HED). Therefore, the ability of the truncated MHV S to cause more cell fusion may be due to increased surface retention resulting from a reduction in endocytosis mediated by these charged residues. Alternatively, the MHV deletion may cause structural changes that enhance the MHV S fusogenicity by destabilizing the overall structure of the glycoprotein. Stabilization of the carboxyl terminus has been shown to decrease the fusion activity of the vesicular stomatitis virus G glycoprotein (Waning et al., 2004); therefore, conversely, it is possible that destabilization of the carboxyl terminus may cause an increase in fusion.",

            "text": "Of particular interest is the T1238 truncation which removed the S carboxyl-terminal acidic domain. This S mutant glycoprotein exhibited a more than 40% increase in cell fusion relative to the S wild type, while there was only a slight decrease in cell-surface expression (Table 1; Group IV mutants). The fact that the overall levels of S glycoprotein detected on cell surfaces as well as the endocytosis profile were not altered suggests that this deletion may enhance fusion via a structural destabilization of the glycoprotein. In contrast, changing acidic amino acids of the acidic motif to alanine residues inhibited cell fusion indicating that the acidic motif was important for S-mediated cell fusion. Specifically, the CL6 cluster mutation changed the acidic residues (DEDDSE) to alanine residues (AAAASA). This mutant protein, while being efficiently expressed at cellular surfaces (87% of the wild-type protein), exhibited a 51% reduction in fusion activity in comparison to the wild type (Table 1; Group I mutant). The observed reduction in S-mediated cell fusion suggests that the acidic cluster plays an important regulatory role in S-mediated cell fusion without appreciably affecting intracellular transport and cell-surface expression. This result is in sharp contrast to the T1238 truncation that deleted the acidic cluster and caused enhanced S-mediated cell fusion. A possible explanation for these seemingly disparate results is that modifications of the carboxyl terminus produce differential effects on the structure and function of the protein by rendering the S glycoprotein more or less prone to S-mediated fusion. Alternatively, it is possible that the acidic cluster plays important roles only in the context of the entire S glycoprotein by regulating binding to other viral or cellular proteins that may modify the S fusogenic properties.",

            "text": "The acidic cluster located in the cytoplasmic portion of the SARS CoV S contains a predicted phosphorylation site (DEDDSE). To address the role of this predicted phosphorylation site within the acidic cluster, the CL7 cluster mutation was constructed. The CL7 replaces the serine residue with an alanine residue within the acidic cluster. This mutant S protein fused cells extensively (85% of the wild type) and was expressed on cell surfaces at levels similar to that of the wild-type S (88% of the wild type) (Table 1; Group II mutants), suggesting that the potential phosphorylation site does not play an important role in S-mediated cell fusion and cell-surface expression. However, the CL7 mutant appeared to recycle to early endosomes in contrast to the wild-type S, which remained mostly on cell surfaces. Therefore, it is possible that the altered putative phosphorylation site within the acidic cluster may play a yet unknown role in S retention at cell surfaces. Conversely, lack of this signal may cause aberrant endocytosis to early endosomes. The overall charge of the carboxyl terminus may also play some role in the structure and function of S. In this regard, there are additional charged amino acids dispersed upstream and downstream of the mutated charged cluster that may play some role in S transport and S-mediated fusion through electrostatic interactions with other viral and cellular proteins. Additional alanine scanning mutations would be needed to resolve their potential contribution to S functions.",

            "text": "In contrast to the MHV S glycoprotein, in which the domains overlap, the charged region of the SARS-CoV S glycoprotein and the two cysteine-rich motifs CRM1 and CRM2 are separate distinct regions (Fig. 1, Fig. 8\n). The T1229 mutation deleted the CRM2 domain, while the T1214 truncation deleted both CRM1 and CRM2. Deletion of the CRM2 slightly inhibited surface expression (91% of the wild type) while reducing fusion activity by 22% (Table 1; Group II mutants). A similar truncation of the MHV S glycoprotein produced a comparable effect on cell fusion (Chang et al., 2000). The 1214 truncation severely inhibited cell-surface expression by 77%, when compared to the wild type, while cell-to-cell fusion activity was reduced by 84% (Table 1; Group III mutant). These results differ from previously published data on similar truncations of the MHV S glycoprotein. Specifically, it was found that the replacement of the entire cysteine-rich domain with amino-acid sequences derived from the cytoplasmic terminus of the herpes simplex virus 1 (HSV-1) glycoprotein D (gD) severely inhibited MHV S glycoprotein function without necessarily affecting cell-surface expression (Chang et al., 2000, Ye et al., 2004). In contrast, the SARS-CoV S T1214 mutant glycoprotein failed to be expressed on cell surfaces explaining the inability of this glycoprotein to cause cell fusion. These results suggest that the proximal cysteine residues of the SARS CoV S play crucial roles in intracellular transport and cell-surface expression. The discrepancy with the MHV S carboxyl-terminal replacements may be due to additional gD sequences that facilitated intracellular transport and cell-surface expression. It is worth noting that depending on the algorithm used to predict the membrane spanning domain of S, a few of the cysteine residues may be included in the membrane spanning region (Chang et al., 2000, Ye et al., 2004). Therefore, it is possible that deletion of these cysteine residues may lead to S misincorporation into membranes, resulting in the apparent transport defects.",

Then, the cells were immediately fixed and permeabilized with ice-cold methanol. Monolayers were blocked for 2 h in TBS blocking buffer before incubation for 1 h with Alexafluor 488-conjugated anti-immunoglobulin G (IgG) (Molecular Probes) diluted 1:750 in TBS\u2013Ca/Mg blocking buffer. After incubation, excess antibody was removed by washing five times with TBS\u2013Ca/Mg. The nuclei were counterstained for 15 min with TO-PRO-3 iodide (1:5000 dilution) and visualized at 647 nm. Cells were examined by using a Leica TCS SP2 laser-scanning microscope (Leica Microsystems, Exton, Pa.) fitted with a 63\u00d7 Leica objective lens (Planachromatic; 1.4 numerical aperature). Individual optical sections in the z axis, averaged eight times, were collected simultaneously in the different channels at 512 \u00d7 512 pixel resolution as described previously (Foster et al., 2004, Lee et al., 2000).

Concurrently, Vero cell monolayers in six-well plates were transfected with the plasmid encoding the ACE2 receptor protein utilizing the Lipofectamine 2000 reagent (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's directions. At 24 h post-transfection, cells containing the mutant plasmids, the ACE2 receptor, and normal untransfected cells were washed with TBS\u2013Ca/Mg, trypsinized, and overlayed in a single well of a six-well plate at a ratio of 2 ml (cells transfected with the ACE2 receptor):0.5 ml (cells transfected with the mutant):1.5 ml (untransfected cells). All of the cells transfected with ACE2 were pooled to ensure that every well had an equal amount of cells with receptor expressed on their surface. After incubation for 24 h, the cells were washed with TBS\u2013Ca/Mg and fixed with ice-cold methanol. Immunohistochemistry was performed by utilizing the Vector Laboratories Vectastain Elite ABC kit essentially as described in the manufacturer's directions. Briefly, cells were washed with TBS\u2013Ca/Mg and incubated in TBS blocking buffer supplemented with normal horse serum at room temperature for 1 h. After blocking, cells were reacted with anti-FLAG antibody (1:500) in TBS blocking buffer for 3 h, washed four times with TBS\u2013Ca/Mg, and incubated with biotinylated horse anti-mouse antibody. Excess antibody was removed by four washes with TBS\u2013Ca/Mg and subsequently incubated with Vectastain Elite ABC reagent for 30 min. Finally, cells were washed three times with TBS\u2013Ca/Mg, and reactions were developed with NovaRed substrate (Vector Laboratories) according to the manufacturer's directions. The average size of syncytia for each mutant was determined by analyzing the area of approximately 300 syncytia, from digital images, using the Image Pro Plus 5.0 software package. The averages were then converted to percentages of the average syncytia size of the wild-type SARS-CoV S.
