The Delphi method is a validated and structured technique to obtain expert consensus, and it particularly well suited for the present situation where there is limited outcomes data, and guidance for procedural timing is urgently needed. 9, 10 Conducting new studies to assess outcomes related to delaying procedures amidst the ongoing pandemic is impractical. The Delphi method allows for timely formulation of expert consensus in a rigorous and systematic manner. We also recognized that delaying procedures not only has clinical implications, but also moral and ethical ones. We therefore designed our study to emphasize patient-important outcomes while considering procedural timing.",

The panel felt that the AGA \"time-sensitive category\" (schedule with 0-8 weeks) was too broad and did not adequately differentiate between emergent procedures like acute cholangitis, and urgent procedures that could be delayed a few weeks, like cancer staging. We chose to adopt this three-tier timing categories for our present study. In our previous study, we also prioritized patient-important outcomes during decision making. Patient-important outcomes are defined as characteristics or variables that reflect how a patient feels, functions, or survives. 14,15 These are outcomes that patients' value and are related to death and quality of life (morbidity, pain, function).

There was broad consensus that symptomatic patients with known/suspected choledocholithiasis required ERCP within 1 week and that urgent ERCP was warranted in patients with acute cholangitis, as this is associated with lower in-hospital mortality, 30-day mortality, length of hospital stay, and organ failure. 31, 32 Indications 20 to 21: the risk of permanent duct changes and pancreatitis is low with small caliber pancreatic stents, and given the high spontaneous migration rate (>85% by 100 days), deferring ERPC for >8 weeks was deemed appropriate. 33 In young patients, women, those with a history of recurrent acute pancreatitis, small pancreatic duct diameter, or 5F stents placement, removal in <8 weeks may be appropriate. 34 For patients with biliary stent in-situ for 3 months, there was agreement among only 67% of panelists to defer stent exchange for >8 weeks. Most panelists felt that routine stent changes could be deferred during this pandemic as long as close clinical follow-up of patients was undertaken and an individualized approach was undertaken to balance the risk of stent occlusion with that of exposure to COVID-19. Thus, some patients are at relatively low risk for biliary stent occlusion, eg, stent placement after incomplete clearance of bile duct stones, or treatment of postoperative bile leak, or those with multiple stents in place for stricture management. 35 In contrast, patients with malignant hilar strictures or distal biliary strictures may be at a higher risk of stent occlusion. 36 opinions can be systematically incorporated to achieve consensus. 39 Anonymity is an important aspect of the Delphi method, and reduces the likelihood of personality conflicts and status relations and helps preserve constructive group dynamics. In our study, results of the written survey and voting during video conferences were anonymous. However, panelists were able to see and hear each other during the video conference, and this may have potentially biased their responses.

Third, we fully recognize that in addition to procedural indications, factors including severity of symptoms and patient co-morbidities should be considered while determining procedural timing. We hope that our recommendations will serve as a starting-point for such difficult decision-making, and that endoscopists will adapt these on a case-by-case basis to reach their final recommendation. We are entering a new phase of the COVID-19 pandemic where there is even more heterogeneity in the prevalence of infection across the country. Our system of categorizing procedures into broad time periods allows endoscopists the flexibility to take these local circumstances as well as local resource availability into consideration.",

We chose to classify indications within a 3-tier system that provided specific guidance while allowing gastroenterologists the additional flexibility in scheduling procedures. We believe it will take many months before endoscopy capacity returns close to prepandemic levels. It is our hope that these guidelines will serve as a useful instrument for endoscopists in planning their strategy as they reopen and ramp up endoscopy at their institutions. ",

Differing opinions over timing centered around 2 issues: (1) unpredictability regarding the possibility of clinically relevant tumor progression over an 8-week time period, owing to significant variability of tumor doubling times and (2) patient anxiety surrounding a new diagnosis of malignancy and the importance of establishing a treatment plan. 38 Some aspects and limitations of our study warrant further discussion. First, our recommendations are based upon expert opinion. The decision to perform endoscopy during the COVID-19 pandemic needs to balance the risks associated with delaying the procedure with the risk of viral exposure to patients and health care providers. Literature on outcomes when procedures are delayed, especially for short duration like of up to 8 weeks, and on the likelihood of acquiring COVID-19 infection during endoscopy, are extremely limited. Furthermore, scheduling timing decisions also need to take into consideration factors such as saving personal protective equipment in a time of dire shortage and avoiding diversion of hospital resources away from the direct care of COVID-19 infected patients. Complex nonlinear decisions that require subjective judgement are often unsuitable for traditional methods of guideline development. However, the Delphi method is well suited for such situations as it is a validated methodology that provides a framework whereby conflicting values and differing",
