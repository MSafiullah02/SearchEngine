Early epidemiological analyses show that compared to the seasonal flu, COVID-19 patients may require ventilation much more frequently [1]. This can lead to a shortage of ventilators and intensive care resources, resulting in limited medical care and death [2]. Whereas some countries have been exposed very early [3], others had the opportunity to prepare for the ethical challenges that emerge when intensive care resources become scarce.",

In crisis situations, such as pandemics, this practice is superimposed by an additional triaging process. Medical factors of triage recommendations typically contain exclusion criteria, a mortality assessment (e.g., Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) score), and a re-evaluation requirement [2]. Beyond the medical aspects, however, triaging unavoidably involves moral choices. The main ethical considerations for making such choices concern equity and maximizing benefits [5, 6]. Other criteria such as considering life stages, rewarding prosocial behavior, or giving priority to the worst off have been subject to long-standing controversy [5, 7, 8].",

Rather, prognosis\u2014assessed in accordance with current intensive care standards\u2014is seen as an indispensable precondition for maximizing benefit. There is some difference between the guidelines as to the role of short-term vs. long-term survival. Whereas some guidelines (CH, A) refer to short-term survival only as a key triaging criterion, others either do not specify survival (UK, BE) or explicitly allow for the possibility that long-term prognosis (G) or a reduced lifespan, due to old age or to comorbidities, could affect a patient\u2019s access to a ventilator (I). In Switzerland, an age limit is rejected as a criterion in itself, yet an age of over 85 years is mentioned as an exclusion criterion to admission to the ICU if no free beds are available.",

No preferential treatment for specific subgroups is advocated, except for health staff (CH) with a view to maintaining the workforce. Rather, fair decision-making processes are emphasized as well as good palliative care (I, CH, A, G, BE). Most guidelines (CH, A, G, BE) call in their statements for interprofessional teams to make and document triage decisions fairly and transparently; others (I) require a second opinion in case of uncertainty. All guidelines demand regular re-evaluation of the decisions taken. In recognition of the moral stress that taking these decisions may bring on, all guidelines call for psychosocial support for health professionals.",

There is some disagreement as to whether only short-term survival should be considered or if more long-term considerations\u2014life expectancy, possibly in combination with quality of life\u2014should have a place as well. Age limits or the exclusion of other patient groups with reduced long-term survival may be very sensitive from a political and psychological point of view. It might be preferable to strengthen advance care planning, assuming that a significant number of patients with a high likelihood of poor outcomes would not opt for intensive care if other choices, such as good palliative care, were readily available to them.",
