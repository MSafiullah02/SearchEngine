To further explore the relationship between NaDC-3 and aging, we observed NaDC-3 expressions in the kidneys of both aging rats and aging humans. The results showed that the abundance of NaDC-3 protein in the kidneys of rats of the 24-month-old group was higher than in the 3-month-old and 12-month-old groups (Figure 9A\u2013C). The abundance of NaDC-3 protein in human kidneys of the old-age group was also higher than in both the child group and adult group (Figure 10A\u2013C).",
