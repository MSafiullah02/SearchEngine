            "text": "A series of reforms in science education in Hong Kong started at the turn of the twenty-first century. In line with international trends, science education in Hong Kong has undergone considerable changes in the last decade since the implementation of the revised junior secondary science curriculum (grades 7\u20139) (Curriculum Development Council [CDC], 1998). The new curriculum encourages teachers to conduct scientific investigations in their classes, advocates scientific investigation as a desired means of learning scientific knowledge, and highlights the development of inquiry practices and generic skills such as collaboration and communication. Most importantly, it was the first local science curriculum that embraced understanding of nature of science (NOS), for example, being \u201cable to appreciate and understand the evolutionary nature of scientific knowledge\u201d (CDC, 1998, p. 3) was stated as one of its broad curriculum aims. In the first topic, \u201cWhat is science?\u201d, teachers are expected to discuss with students some features about science, for example, its scope and limitations, some typical features about scientific investigations, for example, fair testing, control of variables, predictions, hypothesis, inferences, and conclusions. Such an emphasis on NOS was further supported in the revised secondary 4 and 5 (grade 10 and 11) physics, chemistry, and biology curricula (CDC, 2002). Scientific investigation continued to be an important component while the scope of NOS was slightly extended to include recognition of the usefulness and limitations of science as well as the interactions between science, technology, and society (STS).",

We note a further leap forward along the direction of earlier curriculum reforms in the curriculum and assessment guides. The importance of promoting students\u2019 understanding of NOS is more explicitly spelt out. To put greater emphasis on environmental issues, students\u2019 appreciation of STS is extended to STSE, where \u201cE\u201d stands for environment. For example, in the physics curriculum, students are expected to \u201cappreciate and understand the nature of science in physics-related contexts,\u201d \u201cdevelop skills for making scientific inquiries,\u201d \u201cbe aware of the social, ethical, economic, environmental and technological implications of physics, and develop an attitude of responsible citizenship,\u201d and \u201cmake informed decisions and judgments on physics-related issues\u201d (CDC-HKEAA, 2007, p. 4). There is a clear intention to develop students\u2019 awareness and understanding of issues associated with the interconnections among science, technology, society, and the environment. A separate subsection entitled STSE connections is embedded in each science topic of the Curriculum and Assessment Guides. It suggests examples of issues that teachers could make use of in developing \u00adstudents\u2019 awareness and understanding of STSE connections. For example, in the topic mechanics, one of the issues suggested is a dilemma of choosing between convenience and environmental protection in modern transportation.",

            "text": "Based on the literature and our local context, we identified a host of problems and challenges we had to tackle in encouraging and training teachers to teach NOS. In particular, we have been cognizant of the disappointing conclusions that were consistently reached by various studies. That is, both students and science teachers have inadequate understanding of NOS (Lederman, 1992) and STSE (Rubba & Harkness, 1993). There is however emerging empirical evidence that can inform efforts to improve NOS and STSE understandings. Explicit and reflective approaches in teaching NOS can support learner development of sophisticated NOS ideas (Abd-El-Khalick & Lederman, 2000; Khishfe & Abd-El-Khalick, 2002). Teachers with good understanding in NOS still face many constraints including concerns for student abilities and motivation (Abd-El-Khalick, Bell, & Lederman, 1998; Brickhouse & Bodner, 1992), lack of pedagogical skills in teaching NOS (Schwartz & Lederman, 2002), and lack of teaching resources (Bianchini, Johnston, Oram, & Cavazos, 2003) particularly those in local contexts and language (Tsai, 2001). Effective NOS teaching also depends on teachers\u2019 belief in the importance of teaching NOS (Lederman, 1999; Tobin & McRobbie, 1997) and their conception of appropriate learning goals and teaching role (Bartholomew, Osborne, & Ratcliffe, 2004).",

            "text": "In addition to the problems identified above, Hong Kong teachers very rarely have experienced learning of NOS or STSE during their own schooling. Noting teachers\u2019 inadequate NOS understanding and hence their lack of appreciation and less than effective use of the NOS instructional materials, we then restructured our teacher training programs to allow more time on these aspects. For example, in early 2000s, we proposed the use of science stories, such as on the discovery of penicillin, the development of cowpox, Newton\u2019s proposition of Law of Universal Gravitation, and the treatment of stomach ulcers (Tao, 2002), as a medium through which NOS could be introduced to students. However, due to the lack of both understanding of NOS and experience in learning and teaching NOS, many teachers made use of them only for arousing students\u2019 interest. Hence, the availability of teaching resources would not by itself result in teachers\u2019 learning of NOS and an effective teaching of NOS. Unless teachers had the ability to understand and appreciate the rationales behind the design of the instructional materials, it was likely that they would overlook or miss the targeted learning objectives (learning NOS features) and gravitate toward the parts which were more appealing to them (dramatic stories which promote students\u2019 interest). Such a situation was reflected in the comment made by a junior science teacher who had been telling the interesting science stories to his students. He came to realize his oversight of not having made good use of the stories for teaching NOS after he attended our NOS training workshop:\nI found the story on stomach ulcers very interesting\u2026.Marshall tested his hypothesis by trialling out himself\u2026.Students all enjoyed the story\u2026 I only realised now that there are deeper meanings behind the story and other important learning outcomes to be achieved through it and other stories.\n",

The SARS incident was a unique experience that everyone in Hong Kong had lived through and the memories of which would stay for years to come. At the beginning of the outbreak, the causative agent was not known, the pattern of spread was not identified, mortality and morbidity seemed soaring, yet an effective treatment regimen was uncertain. It attracted the attention of the whole world as scientists worked indefatigably to understand the biology of the disease, develop new diagnostic tests, and design new treatments. Extensive media coverage kept people up-to-date on the latest development of scientific knowledge generated from the scientific inquiry about the disease. We believed that the incident would have much to reveal about NOS.",

They included the tentative nature of scientific knowledge, theory-laden observation and interpretation, multiplicity of approaches adopted in scientific inquiry, the inter-relationship between science and technology, and the nexus of science, politics, social, and cultural practices. The incident also provided some insights into a number of NOS features less emphasized in the school curriculum. These features included the need to combine and coordinate expertise in a number of scientific fields, the intense competition between research groups (suspended during the SARS crisis), the significance of affective issues relating to intellectual honesty, the courage to challenge authority, and the pressure of funding issues on the conduct of research.",

Since January 2005, we have been using the SARS story in the training of hundreds of preservice and in-service science teachers about NOS. The feedback has been encouraging. The SARS story was particularly successful in promoting teachers\u2019 understanding of NOS in terms of (1) the realization of inseparable links between science and the social, cultural, and political environment, (2) deeper understanding of how science and technology impact on each other, and (3) a richer appreciation of the processes of authentic scientific inquiry and the humanistic character of scientists. The effectiveness was mainly attributed to immediacy, relevance, and familiarity of the SARS story which made the abstract tangible. Teachers\u2019 personal experience of this unique piece of \u201chistory\u201d of science and the powerful affective impact of the interviews with scientists also contributed to the favorable learning outcomes (Wong, Hodson, Kwan, & Yung, 2008).",

            "text": "The encouraging results of using the SARS story with teachers prompted us to produce NOS instructional materials that should also be grounded in the local contexts (and language) for school students. At the same time, we were fully aware that high quality curriculum materials do not automatically result in student learning. Such materials have to be mediated by teachers with necessary content knowledge, pedagogical skills, beliefs, and intention of meeting the curriculum goals (Bartholomew et al., 2004; Lumpe, Haney, & Czerniak 1998; Schwartz & Lederman, 2002). Thus, in September 2005, we embarked on a 2-year project which aimed to produce local NOS/STSE curriculum resources while preparing more teachers for NOS/STSE teaching. We also envisioned that the project was timely in view of the new science curricula to be implemented in 2009. Having made reference to the reminder by Hodson (2006) that,\n[a]ction research offers the most likely route to such far reaching curriculum changes, committed teachers work together in mutually supportive groups to address the theoretical and practical issues surrounding the implementation of a learning about science curriculum and to develop suitable and effective curriculum resources. Curriculum materials need to have a \u201cstreet credibility\u201d that can only be gained when they are developed by teachers, for teachers. (p. 305)\nwe deliberately involved teachers at the beginning stages of the design process of instructional materials. More than 50 senior secondary science teachers worked together with the university team members to develop 12 sets14 of teaching resources which integrate NOS knowledge with subject knowledge of the new senior secondary biology, chemistry, and physics curricula. Efforts were made to include as many local examples as possible. The topics included development of the Disneyland in Hong Kong, consumption of shark fins, an abridged version of the SARS story, etc. In doing so, teachers would be more ready to make use of the materials in their own classrooms. This was important for our project as we wanted to collect data to refine the teaching materials as well as provide opportunities for the teachers to learn how to teach NOS with the support of the university team members. In brief, the teacher development project comprised the following key components:\nA 6-h NOS session conducted by the first author using SARS and other contexts in illustrating various aspects of NOS.Workshops on refinement of NOS instructional materials drafted by the university team members.Prelesson discussion with the university team member(s) on the main ideas and fine adjustment of the instructional materials to be tried out in the teacher\u2019s own classroom.Teaching the lesson(s) using the instructional materials.Reviewing the lesson video and reflecting on the trial lesson(s).Meeting between the university team member(s) and the teacher to discuss critical incidents in the videotaped lesson (followed by written feedback from university team members) in preparation for a sharing session with other in-service teachers joining this project (teacher members).Sharing of the trial-run experience with other in-service teachers of the project and receiving their comments.Dissemination seminar: Over 500 teachers from other schools in Hong Kong attended. Sharing of teaching materials and trial-run experiences with a wide audience.\n",

These teachers found learning through a contextual approach, as what they did in the NOS workshop, very effective in promoting, enriching, and consolidating their NOS understanding. They also treasured both the training materials and some activities in the teaching resources that they tried out in their classroom as they could modify or had modified them to incorporate teaching of NOS in their teaching of subject knowledge teaching. The actual classroom implementation and detailed review and discussion of the lesson video \u201cworked best\u201d and more importantly were \u201ctreasured most\u201d by the teachers in enhancing their pedagogical skills in teaching NOS and intention to teach NOS. The review and analysis of the lesson videos facilitated teachers\u2019 reflection on which areas needed improvement. It also allowed them to appreciate and value the teaching of NOS when they saw students\u2019 ability and interest in learning NOS. The proof of workability of both teaching and learning NOS had prompted teachers who were reserved about teaching NOS to follow suit. Details of their development, their concerns, and their learning outcomes were reported in Wong, Yung and Cheng (2010).",

Thus in September 2008, we initiated another 2-year professional development project. It aimed to cultivate a mutually supportive environment where teachers would collaborate and develop their pedagogical content knowledge of NOS. A key feature of the new project was the formation of study groups among teachers of the same subject discipline from different schools (subject-based approach) and science teachers of the same school (school-based approach). We believe that putting like-minded teachers together in a study group is more likely to sustain and even enhance their commitment to teach NOS. While retaining the components that teachers who participated in the previous project valued and treasured most (such as the SARS case study, the detailed review and discussion on their lesson videos with the university team members and their peers, etc.), we also encouraged teachers not to simply modify and adapt the available teaching resources, but to proactively design their own instructional materials. This is indeed a goal that we wish teachers could ultimately achieve. Thus at the outset of the current project, we explained our intention to the teachers by a Chinese proverb, \u201cGive a man a fish and you feed him for a day. Teach a man to fish and you feed him for a lifetime.\u201d (In Chinese, it says \u6388\u4eba\u4ee5\u9b5a,\u4e09\u9910\u4e4b\u9700;\u6388\u4eba\u4ee5\u6f01,\u7d42\u751f\u4e4b\u7528\u3002).",

At appropriate places, we include views and comments expressed by Wayne and Kyle during our interaction with them in the following occasions: brainstorming sessions on how to incorporate NOS ideas in their physics lessons, pre- and post-lesson discussions, video workshops with the team of science teachers of their school in which we shared and reflected on video episodes of how the teachers instilled NOS in their respective subjects, and an exit interview near the end of the project.",

Wayne\u2019s lesson with class 4F took place in the morning while that of Kyle with class 4E took place in the afternoon. Kyle and Alice joined Wayne\u2019s morning lesson. Wayne and Kyle had put great effort in locating relevant videos, historical world records of swimming and track events, and other informative data for various lesson activities. During the lesson, videos like the return of Liu Xiang back on the track, which obviously captivated students\u2019 interest and attention, Kyle and Alice felt the lesson was too loaded in the first half that the time left for student discussion in the role play activity and their subsequent reporting was limited (with less than 15 min). Opportunities for quality student interaction and arguments were scarce. Kyle was very sensitive and reflective in identifying components with good engagement of students, for example, the 110 m-hurdle race with Liu Xiang. As an observer of Wayne\u2019s lesson, Kyle acted as a critical friend for Wayne, identifying several lesson components that could be run more efficiently by (1) rephrasing some questions to ensure clarity and good understanding by students, (2) showing only selective parts of some videos while retaining its original purposes, and (3) rearranging some videos to make better linkage from one component to the next. Kyle\u2019s immediate postlesson reflection on the codesigned lesson plan turned out to be very successful in addressing some inadequacies identified in Wayne\u2019s implementation.",

You know, probably she was prompted by your joke you made at the end of the lesson [would bring along a shark skin swimsuit for the running in the School Sports Day tomorrow].

            "text": "We see several similarities of our teacher training lesson in promoting teacher NOS understanding and Wayne and Kyle\u2019s lesson in promoting students NOS understanding (in particular STS connections). First, both lessons used timely contexts that were relevant to learners. SARS has captured much attention of all people in Hong Kong where it was most hard-hit by the epidemic. Thus it has been highly relevant to teachers in Hong Kong and its timeliness would last for years due to the unforgettable experience and the scare of a similar crisis due to another outbreak, like the recent swine flu. For Wayne and Kyle\u2019s lesson, sports have been mostly liked by teenage students. Wayne and Kyle deliberately included examples of a diverse range of sports. Kyle reminded us that the effectiveness would be enhanced if the teachers also find the context relevant. He said, \u201cI love sports very much and enjoy looking up information about sports\u2026feel excited and at ease when talking about them to students.\u201d They also capitalized on the timely context of the ban of shark skin swimsuits that happened a couple of months before their lessons. The use of the return of Liu Xiang (favorite sports star of many Hong Kong students) to the 110 m-hurdle competition 2 days before their lessons was both timely and relevant to the students. Students were obviously attracted to the many video clips of sports competitions and sports training used by them in the lesson. Similarly, the SARS teacher training materials also made heavy use of videos of scientists who fought against SARS and documentaries produced by reputable media about the inside story of SARS. Teachers felt excited to hear these inside stories. These videos were immensely helpful in the reconstruction of the relevant SSIs to give learners a sense of authenticity about the events shown. This is the second common feature of the SARS training materials and Kyle and Wayne\u2019s instructional materials that motivated the learners. Third, both lessons engaged learners in critically reflecting on dilemmas, issues, and problems faced in decision making. Instead of being a purely rational and logical exercise, such decision making mandated considerations of social demands, sentiments of public, incomplete scientific findings and possible consequences to different stakeholders, etc.",

Our oversight was due to our belief that another similar incident as SARS would be unlikely, which embodied so many NOS features in one case. It was interesting to find that Kyle and Wayne somehow translated some of the unique features of the SARS training session to their teaching of NOS. Kyle and Wayne\u2019s lesson demonstrated that the same features could still be nicely applied to a simple SSI embedded with just a few NOS aspects. Indeed Kyle said that he felt fairly at ease in running the role play activity as he had experience using one of the sets of teaching resources, LASIK, developed in our previous project from 2005 to 2007. In the LASIK package, there was an activity in which students were asked to advise, with justification, people of different backgrounds, careers, and eye problems whether they are suitable for taking laser-assisted in situ keratomileusis (LASIK) surgery. Kyle further commented that if he had not used the LASIK package, it would have been quite daunting for him to design a lesson teaching STSE on his own.\nI used the LASIK package before\u2026all information are there\u2026I didn\u2019t need to prepare anything extra, only implemented the activities\u2026After the implementation, I felt relatively easily to design a new one\u2026. If I have to design one right from the beginning, it would be hard. But if there is a sample, like LASIK\u2026also on STS\u2026I can follow it like a model.\n",
