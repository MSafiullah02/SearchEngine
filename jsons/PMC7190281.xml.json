The document states that \u201cin patients dying with SARS-CoV-2 infection, the autopsies can confirm laboratory and radiological findings and can contribute to an accurate diagnosis and to a better understanding of mechanisms of the disease.\u201d In the meantime, the SIAPC Board accepted to collaborate with the Scientific Society of Hospital Forensic Medicine of the National Health System (COMLAS) to produce a joint document, which was available on the SIAPEC web site on March 22 [2]. The document was translated in English and published on Pathologica, the official SIAPEC journal [3]. We acknowledged that safety of operators must be the main goal to confront with, and we defined the criteria to perform the post-mortem studies in suspect, probable, or confirmed COVID-19 cases [2, 3]. In this document, we highlighted that post-mortem examination does not have a primary diagnostic role: the diagnosis relies on the clinical picture, the results of laboratory tests (nasal and oropharyngeal swabs aimed at identifying viral RNA with PCR techniques), and typical lung CT scans. Autopsy may still have a clinical role in selected cases, but should more appropriately be restricted to research projects, where the collection of tissues may shed new insights on the disease-induced organ damages. We also suggested that tissue sampling on corpses can be done using core biopsies, as suggested by one of the first reports of an autopsy case of COVID-19 [4].",

Due to the high level of contagion in hospitals and in the general population, any corpse is regarded as potential source of infection. Therefore, for any autopsy, we recommend always to adopt the same biosafety measures as for confirmed COVID-19 cases. In addition, in cases of autopsies without apparent SARS-CoV-2 infection, we recommend (i) to discuss with the clinicians the reason why the post-mortem examination is requested; (ii) and if available, to perform nasal-oropharyngeal swabs on corpses within 2 h of death to assess the presence of SARS-CoV-2 infection to implement the safety measures [3].",

Autopsies should be restricted to well-motivated cases and performed in accordance with strict biosafety rules. Moreover, as post-mortem histopathological findings could play a role in understanding the pathophysiology of the SARS-CoV-2 infection, SIAPEC is promoting a national study group to deal with diagnostic and organizational challenges related to the ongoing emergency and is willing to create a repository of micro- and macroscopic images illustrating the organ damage induced by SARS-CoV-2. A repository of these images will certainly be of help in the diagnostic activity and could be an important source for future collaborative studies.",
