In those studies, influenza and rhinoviruses were detected most frequently, followed by other respiratory viruses, like parainfluenza, adenovirus, respiratory syncytial virus, coronaviruses and, more recently, human metapneumovirus [4]. These viruses can cause severe pneumonia with ARDS requiring mechanical ventilation (MV). Although unknown, the precise frequency of this complication is probably very low.",

Within months after its emergence, it had affected more than 8000 patients and caused 774 deaths in 26 countries on five continents [11]. The responsible pathogen was a new coronavirus, Sars-CoV [12]. Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) affected persons of all ages, with a slight female predominance, which probably reflects the increased likelihood of exposure of nurses [13], [14], [15]. Its initial symptoms include fever, chills, myalgia, cough, but also shortness of breath and/or tachypnea [13], [15]. Chest X-rays showed abnormalities in 60\u2013100% of the patients [16]. During this pandemic, one-third of SARS patients had simple courses but the other two-thirds developed severe complications. Indeed, 20\u201330% of the infected patients required ICU admission and a large majority of them required MV because of ARDS [11], [13], [14], [16]. Management of SARS patients includes preventing human-to-human transmission. In the most severely ill patients, no specific management strategy was applied other than protective MV and usual rescue therapies, e.g., nitric oxide, prone positioning, recruitment manoeuvres\u2026 The most critically ill patients were given ribavirin, as a broad-spectrum antiviral, and most also received broad-spectrum antibiotics, including drugs effective against agents that cause atypical pneumonia [11], [17]. However, no treatment demonstrated clinical efficacy [11], [14], [15]. Corticosteroids were given to the most severely ill patients and effectively resolved pneumonia and chest film opacities, but no controlled trial has confirmed those observations [11], [17].",

Direct avian-to-human H5N1-virus transmission is the predominant means of human infection, and human-to-human transmission is probably limited [19], [20]. Autopsies of patients who succumbed to H5N1 infection found diffuse alveolar damage with hyaline membrane formation, patchy interstitial lymphoplasmacytic infiltrates, bronchiolitis with squamous metaplasia and/or pulmonary congestion with various degrees of hemorrhage [19], [20]. The nonspecific clinical and radiological characteristics of H5N1-induced disease often result in the misdiagnosis of subsequently confirmed cases. Conventional or real-time reverse transcriptase\u2013polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) detection of viral RNA is the best diagnostic method. Because the disease is still endemic in poultry in parts of Asia, Africa and the Middle East, clinicians must be aware of this rare but fulminant ARDS etiology, particularly in travellers with pulmonary symptoms of unknown origin [19], [20].",

Treatment with high-dose oseltamivir (e.g., 150 mg twice daily) for 10 days is recommended [20]. For oseltamivir-resistant H5N1 variants, compassionate use of intravenous zanamivir to treat seriously ill patients showed promising results [21]. Although the new, intravenously administered, neuraminidase-inhibitor peramivir has demonstrated antiviral activity against H5N1 and yielded encouraging results in lethally infected mice, data are lacking in humans [22]. Corticosteroids should not be used routinely, not only because their efficacy has not been demonstrated, but also because their use might increase the infectious complication rate. Other therapeutic modalities are nonspecific and include MV, rescue strategies for severe ARDS (nitric oxide, recruitment manoeuvres, high-frequency oscillation and/or extracorporeal membrane oxygenation [ECMO]) and organ support.",

Indeed, HSV detection does not automatically mean viral infection, but can reflect either contamination (from mouth and/or throat for bronchial specimens) or local tracheobronchial virus excretion [44]. HSV-specific nuclear inclusion detection in cells recovered during bronchoscopic bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) can diagnose parenchymal lung involvement (figure 3\n) [44], but this technique may be difficult to implement in daily practice, because it requires trained intensivists and pathologists with specific skills. Another way to diagnose HSV bronchopneumonitis could be virus-load assessment. This approach is based on the fact that the higher the virus load, the higher the incidence of HSV bronchopneumonitis [44]. It was shown that a threshold of 8 \u00d7 104 HSV copies/106\n cells had 81% sensitivity (95% CI, 69\u201390%) and 83% specificity (95% CI, 71\u201391%) for diagnosing HSV bronchopneumonitis [44].",

In a recent study, patients were considered to have developed CMV pneumonia when the following two criteria were met: clinical signs leading to BAL (ARDS, suspected ventilator-associated pneumonia) and either CMV recovery in the lower respiratory tract or a positive cytopathic effect in BAL fluid [56]. However, this strategy might falsely increase the CMV-pneumonia rate. Indeed, as for HSV bronchopneumonitis, it is important to bear in mind that virus isolation in BAL fluid does not necessarily mean viral infection or viral disease. CMV recovery in the lower respiratory tract might be a reactivation without true lung involvement. For suspected viral pneumonia, cytologic examination looking for specific viral inclusions in BAL-collected cells is the foundation stone of the diagnosis. Moreover, the cytopathic effect depends on the Herpesviridae considered: nuclear inclusions are specific to HSV infection (figure 3), while cytoplasmic inclusions are specific to CMV infection (figure 4\n) [4]. But this technique is probably less sensitive for CMV pneumonia than for HSV bronchopneumonitis: in the recent study on CMV infection in ICU patients, a positive cytopathic effect in BAL fluid was observed for only one of the 11 patients diagnosed with CMV pneumonia [56]. A virological technique, like virus-load determination, should replace histology in a near future.",
