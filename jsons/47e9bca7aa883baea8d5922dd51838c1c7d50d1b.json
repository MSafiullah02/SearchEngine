            "text": "Plants are a fascinating research topic if we relate to environmental stress. Because they are physically stuck in specific spots, the plants have to handle in that site, regardless of the environmental conditions. Moving to another place is not an option. But what plants can do is to modify the internal \"environment,\" and plants are \"true masters\" of manipulating their metabolism to deal with environmental disturbances. This feature is one of the reasons why plants are useful in various research; we can rely on them as \"sensitive indicators\" of environmental changes, even in completely new environments. In the absence of normal conditions, plants cannot use the classical pathways of metabolism, so they need to identify other solutions. This is what happens when plants adjust their metabolism for regulating gene activation, thus producing more or less proteins that are useful or not in the new environmental conditions. The different parts of the plant come with their own genetic regulation strategies. A number of genes that are involved in the creation and remodeling of cell walls are activated differently in growing plants. Other genes with a role in identifying light, which are normally active on the leaves, are active at the root level. In leaves, many genes associated with transmission of hormonal information are suppressed, and genes associated with insect protection are more active. These trends are also seen in the (higher) number of proteins involved in message transmission, cell wall metabolism, and plant protection. These patterns of gene and protein functioning indicate that in unfavorable conditions, the plants respond by weakening the cell walls and creating new ways to understand the environment. It is possible to monitor changes in the genes in real time by labelling certain proteins with fluorescent elements. Plants modified with fluorescent proteins can give useful information about how they respond to the environment. These modified plants act as biological sensors (NBSs).",

Analysis of signals in plant nanobionics aims at processing signals recorded by measurements in order to extract the maximum of useful information for diagnostics and These devices are mostly used in genetic engineering in agriculture, where it is necessary to know the mechanisms of reaction and the affinity of enzymes and microorganisms for different substrates of interest and signaling molecules. A biochip is a device that contains a structure of individual sensory elements (NBSs) interconnected by functions and recognition specifications, integrated on a chip. The number of NBSs on a chip may be of the order of 10 6 units. In this degree of integration, a set of distinct tests can be performed extremely quickly and efficiently. In contrast to microchips, biochips are not electronic structures (they contain different electronic structures coupled to nanobiosensory elements). Each NBS can be thought of as a \"microreactor\" that performs a specific chemical reaction with an analyte. NBSs from biochips can be designed to detect a wide variety of analytes, including DNA, antibodies, proteins, and biomolecules. The advantages are multiple: sensors can be produced in batches or sequences that can be assembled in parallel or serial, providing a high manufacturing yield; sensors can be assembled on very small areas with reduced distances between them; 3D structures can be generated providing high signals besides 2D structures; any type of biochemical reaction may be incorporated; NBSs can be produced separately and subsequently assembled according to the specificity and nature of the application.",

In enzymes, weak noncovalent interactions (hydrogen bonding, electrostatics, dipole-dipole, van der Waals, etc.) are used to link the guest into the enzyme pocket (interactions stabilize host-guest interaction). Macrocycles contain polar functionalities, capable of interacting with guests via hydrogen bonding, electrostatic interactions, and dipole-dipole interactions. It is desirable that bonding in the cavity is not strong, because it is important that the analyte, the guest, is released from the host after it has been detected and measured.

Results from genetics, molecular biology, and nanotechnology have led to one of the most accurate detection methods: electrochemical NBSs with DNA (combining the principle of NBS ISFET with molecular wires from nanotubes). The operating principle consists of collecting the signal between two electrodes-one working electrode and another reference electrode. The auxiliary electrodes have a specified role in their turn. The sensing mechanism consists in modifying the I-V characteristic (current-voltage) in the presence of a target molecule. Carbon nanotubes are exceptional for the work electrode with high electron transfer velocity and excellent spatial resolution. Target in NBS DNA is an unknown sequence of DNA (or oligonucleotides) attached by functionalization to the carboxyl or amino CNT groups. Researchers reported the developing plants' ability to capture 30% more energy by implanting carbon nanotubes into chloroplasts and plant organisms where photosynthesis takes place. They managed to modify plants so as to detect nitric oxide by implanting another type of carbon nanotubes. \"The plants are suitable for the role of a technological platform. They heal themselves, they are durable, they resist the harsh environments and they have their own sources of energy and water.\" The transformation of plants to photon devices, with own energy, such as explosive detectors or chemical weapons, is expected (Panchal and Upadhyay 2014) . External or surface electrodes are metal electrodes that contact the NBSs' bioactive component either directly (dry or solid electrodes) or through an electrolyte solution (liquid electrodes). Solid or dry electrodes are made in silver, platinum, gold, and nickel. Internal electrodes are made of thin wires made of durable metal: stainless steel, platinum, and tungsten. The active part of the electrode can be covered with a metallic conductor layer (gold, silver) and the inactive one with an insulating layer (polymer/thin film). NBSs' active contact surfaces are large in size compared to cell sizes and are used for extracellular recordings.",

This electrochemical addition was possible due to the quasireversible binding of cytochrome \"c\" to the modified gold electrode with 4.4\u2032 bipyridyl, thereby resulting in the hydrogen linkages in the lysine residues to bound to the nitrogen of the pyridyl which modified the surface of the electrode. Transmutation through complex protein electrode rapidly directs the transfer of electrons, which is accomplished by the following scheme: cytochrome diffusion \"c\" on the electrode, protein binding on the surface, electron transfer, and protein desorption.

A transporting protein, lactose-permease (LP), can be incorporated into a liposomal bilayer that permits protonic carbohydrate transport with a stoichiometric ratio of 1:1. This mechanism was identified through the pH-dependent fluorescence of a fluorophore immobilized in liposomes. Liposomes with LP were incorporated into a lipid bilayer deposited on a pH-sensitive ISFET. Preliminary results show that this modified ISFET is capable of irreversibly detecting lactose from an FIA system. Protein receptor NBSs have been recently discovered. Binding of analytes, here called agonists, to immobilized receptor proteins is monitored by changing the flow of ions through these channels. Glutamate, as an agonist, can be determined in the presence of other agonists that can interfere with the determination of Na + or Ca 2+ streams using conductometric method or ion-selective electrodes. Due to the dependence of the ionic channel on the nature of the linkages, it produces an independence toward the enzyme nature in order to achieve the desired sensitivity. Two methods have been approached. The first refers to oligonucleotide duplex interleaving during the formation of the double helix structure of the DNA of a molecule that is electrically active. The second method is the direct detection of guanine which is electroactive. Some of these NBSs cannot operate through analytical-sensing membrane separation membranes. The sensitive layer often has to be in contact with the biological environment where the analytes are located (Fang et al. 2015) .",

For any NBS built on the principle of molecular recognition, it is important to characterize it by its response, which is related to operating parameters and limiting reaction speeds. Accuracy, precision, sensitivity, and reproducibility are basic criteria for estimating NBS performance. These parameters are in direct relation to the reaction mechanisms, the transport phenomena, and the kinetics of the processes in the volume at the interface. Most criteria have been developed for enzymatic NBSs, being the most studied in the literature. In the case of immunosensors, the key element is the ability to capture the surface, i.e., the number of surface molecules that is active. One method of checking this parameter is to measure the specific activity, meaning the ratio of the number of active molecules to the number of immobilized molecules. This estimation is dependent on the immobilization mode (molecular orientation, number of attachment points or active sites), and the ratio ranges between 0.15 and 0.3, rarely reaching the unit. Capture capability becomes important when the surface decreases as in microfluidic applications. A problem encountered in immunosensors is that of regenerating the surface without significant loss of activity. There was a lack of rigor in the performance criteria (Affi et al. 2016) .",

Representatives for organometallic complexes are ferrocenes and their derivatives because they have redox potentials and are independent of pH. Bienzymatic systems' recent works have focused on the direct communication of electron transfer between enzymes and electrodes. Successes in the field are the peroxidase enzyme HRP (horseradish peroxidase) that catalyzes the reduction of hydrogen peroxide for a number of organic compounds. When the enzyme is immobilized on the electrode, the need for the organic reducer is prevented by the electrode itself providing the reducing equivalences. The coupling of peroxidase with an enzyme oxidase allows for the construction of bienzymatic systems through which the peroxide produced by the oxidase is detected by the electrode-peroxidase system which operates at lower potentials relative to a simple platinum electrode. This is where the minimization of active species interferences results from (Frederickson Matika and Loake 2014).",

By wrapping the particles into polyacrylic acid, a heavily charged molecule allowed the particles to penetrate the lipid hydrophobic membranes surrounding the chloroplasts. In these chloroplasts, the level of decomposition of molecules has decreased tremendously. Using the same technique, the researchers introduced semiconductor carbon nanotubes embedded in negatively charged DNA into chloroplasts. Plants use only one tenth of the available sunlight, but carbon nanotubes have functioned as artificial antennas that have allowed chloroplasts to capture unusual light waves such as green, ultraviolet, and near infrared. When carbon nanotubes functioned as prosthetic photoabsorbents, photosynthesis, measured by the activity of electrons in tilacloids, was 49% more intense than in chloroplasts isolated without attached nanotubes. When cerium oxide was joined with carbon nanotubes, the chloroplasts remained active for the next few hours (Nikolelis et al. 2008) . Researchers went to live plants and used a technique called vascular infusion to attach nanoparticles to Arabidopsis thaliana, a small flower plant. Using the above method, the researchers applied a nanoparticle solution on the lower side of the leaf, penetrating the stomata that usually allow the carbon dioxide to get in and the oxygen out. In these plants, the nanotubes have penetrated into chloroplasts and have increased the photonic electron circuit by about 30%. It is also to be discovered how these percentages influence the sugar production of plants. Scientists have been able to transform the Arabidopsis thaliana plant into a chemical NBS by implanting nanotubes that detect nitric oxide, a pollutant produced by combustion (Hines et al. 2015) .",

In the case of potato, the control program for certain diseases, such as the rot caused by Phytophthora infestans, had to be abandoned because the resistance to this disease of potato plants obtained by transferring the 11 resistance genes on the basis of crossbreeds with the Solanum demissum species proved to be of short duration. Identifying genes of resistance in the genome of different plant species and transferring them to other crop plants are extremely difficult and time-consuming if traditional methods (intra-and interspecific hybridizations) are used.

This is the case for pepper Bs2 genes and rice Xa21 which provide resistance to different phytopathogenic strains of X. campestris or X. oryzae in the case of species in which the genes have been cloned (e.g., tomatoes). Resistance to these genes is due to the recognition of proteins produced by bacteria or phytopathogenic fungi, resulting in the occurrence of a plant hypersensitivity phenomenon and necrosis of affected tissues.
