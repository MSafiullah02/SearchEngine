            "text": "Viroporins serve highly diverse functions in viral infection cycles (illustrated in Fig. 6.1). Early studies of viroporins have focused on only a few systems including 2B of poliovirus, 6K of togavirus, and M2 from influenza A virus (AM2). The 2B is a well-known viroporin that can modify membrane permeability and allow the passage of ions and small molecules during later stages of viral infection [1\u20133]. The 6K is a small, hydrophobic acylated protein that has been shown to form cation-selective channels when inserted into lipid bilayers [4]. The 6K is proposed to be involved in virus budding, but the exact role of 6K in the viral life cycle is poorly characterized [5\u20137]. The AM2 proton channel is the most studied viroporins because (1) it is the drug target of the first anti-flu drug (amantadine or rimantadine) and (2) it is one of the smallest proton channels with proton selectivity motif not found in any of the proton channels from other organisms [8\u201310]. Since the definition of viroporin has been put forward, more and more viroporins have been classified (Table 6.1). The influenza B virus encodes the BM2 proton channel that is a functional homolog of the AM2 but cannot be blocked by the adamantane family of drugs [11]. The human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) Vpu and the hepatitis C virus (HCV) p7 have been shown to form oligomeric channels to conduct cations [12\u201316]. The 2B protein from the enterovirus 71 (EV71), however, displayed altered channel activity, as it conducts anions (e.g., Cl\u2212) instead of cations [17]. Paramecium bursaria chlorella virus 1 (PBCV-1) has a viral K+ channel named Kcv that contains the canonical potassium selectivity filter [18] and was proposed to adopt similar structure as KcsA [19]. In addition to the ion channels, the VP4 from rhinovirus can form pores that allow single-stranded viral RNA to cross the membrane [20, 21], further expanding the list of substrates that viroporins transport.",

            "text": "Probably the best-defined roles of viroporins are that of the M2 proton channels of influenza A and B viruses, both of which involve equilibrating pH between compartments. One important role of the M2 is to equilibrate pH across the viral membrane during viral entry, which acidifies the virion interior immediately after endocytosis and facilitates RNA release [22, 23] (Fig. 6.1a). Another role of M2 is to equilibrate pH across the trans-Golgi membrane of the infected cells during viral maturation, which preserves the pre-fusion form of the hemagglutinin fusion protein through de-acidification of the Golgi lumen [24] (Fig. 6.1b). The roles of other cation-selective viroporins are less clear. One of the general roles proposed for viroporin is to depolarize either the ER or plasma membrane to facilitate membrane curvature formation during virus budding [25, 26] (Fig. 6.1c). In the case of HCV, for example, the p7-mediated channel activity has been reported to facilitate virus release [27, 28]. Another general role for viroporin is simply to cause cation leakage, which would induce cellular stress and programmed cell death [29] (Fig. 6.1d). In addition to ion permeation, several viroporins are known to participate in viral assembly through interaction with other proteins. For example, the influenza AM2 and BM2 proteins both have significant cytoplasmic domains that are believed to recruit matrix proteins M1 during virus assembly [30\u201332]. The HCV p7 protein has also been reported to interact with other non-structural proteins such as NS2, and this interaction appears to be crucial for the production of infectious HCV particles [33, 34].",

            "text": "Enveloped viruses infect host cells by the fusion of viral and cellular membrane. Depending on the type of the virus, fusion can occur either with the host plasma membrane or with the endosomal membrane. The membrane fusion must occur without consuming energy; it is catalyzed by major conformational changes of specialized envelope proteins generally known as viral fusion proteins. Despite their diversity, all known viral fusion proteins convert from a prefusion state (dimers or trimers, depending on the class), through a key intermediate state (extended conformation), to a postfusion state (a trimer of hairpins) that brings the fusion peptide, attached to the target membrane, and the TM domain, attached to the viral membrane, into close proximity thereby facilitating the fusion of viral and target membranes (Fig. 6.2a) [35]. Three distinct classes of viral fusion proteins (exemplified in Fig. 6.2b) have been defined based on structural criteria [36]. The Class I includes fusion proteins from some of the best characterized human pathogens, such as influenza and HIV-1. These proteins are trimers of a single chain precursor that requires a proteolytic cleavage to generate two fragments. For example, the influenza A hemagglutinin (HA) contains the N-terminal fragment HA1 and C-terminal fragment HA2 [37], and the HIV-1 envelope protein is cleaved into the gp120 and gp41 fragments [38]. The fusogenic fragment gp41 bears a hydrophobic fusion peptide capped by the outer receptor binding fragment gp120 [39]. Receptor binding accompanies cap protein release, allowing major conformational changes in the gp41 that ultimately leads to fusion [40]. In the case of influenza, the cap HA1 is released by low pH of the endosome after endocytosis [41]. The Class II fusion proteins are found on flaviviruses, alphaviruses, and bunyaviruses (E in flaviviruses, E1 in alphaviruses, GN and GC in bunyaviruses) [42, 43]. Although these fusion proteins are architecturally different from the Class I fusion proteins, i.e., Class II fusion proteins are mostly made of \u03b2-sheets as opposed to the helical structures of the Class I fusion proteins, they operate on the same physical principle. Their fusion peptides are formed as loops at the tips of \u03b2-strands that serve as an anchor to insert into the host membrane after endocytosis. Unlike Class I proteins, which remain trimeric, their conformational change involves a change in oligomeric state from pre-fusion dimers to post-fusion trimers [44, 45]. The reduced pH of the endosome induces a cascade of subsequent refolding and trimerization events that achieve membrane fusion [46]. Members of the Class III include G protein of VSV, gB of herpes simplex virus and Epstein-Barr virus (EBV), and gp64 of the insect-cell baculovirus [47]. The Class III fusion proteins combine some of the features of Class I and II fusion proteins [48]. Each protomer is composed of five domains that contain a central trimeric coiled-coil, a hallmark of Class I proteins in their post-fusion states, three of the domains are predominantly made of \u03b2-sheets and their fusion peptide more closely resemble those of Class II proteins in that their fusion loops are found at the tips of extended \u03b2-strands [49].",

For example, the approved small molecule drug Arbidol is used as a broad-spectrum inhibitor of influenza A and B virus, as well as hepatitis C virus [50, 51]. Unlike many other broad-spectrum antivirals, Arbidol has an established mechanism of action against the HAs in influenza A and B viruses that involves the inhibition of virus-mediated membrane fusion and thus viral entry [50]. In addition, Enfuvirtide (T20, Fuzeon) is an approved peptide drug that blocks the HIV-1 entry [52]; it is derived from the C-terminal heptad repeat 2 region of the HIV-1 gp41 envelope glycoprotein, designated the C-peptide, that disrupts membrane fusion by competing with an intra-molecular interaction that is important for the refolding of gp41 during membrane fusion [53]. Apart from being therapeutic targets, another important medical use of the fusion proteins is vaccine development. Viral fusion proteins are usually presented on the virion surface with high copy numbers, and thus are popular antigens for eliciting broad-spectrum neutralizing antibodies. For example, the native conformations of the HIV-1 envelope glycoprotein have being pursued intensely as immunogens for B-cell based vaccine development [54, 55].",

There have been only a few examples of crystal structures of the small TMDs, including the TMD of the AM2 [56, 57] and the more recent crystal structure of the TM helix dimer of the glycophorin A protein [58]. As cryo-EM is rapidly approaching atomic resolution, it is becoming increasingly used to examine the structures of the much larger viral fusion proteins containing the TMD. Most notably, a recent cryo-EM study of the HIV-1 envelope glycoprotein (Env) including the TMD achieved a high resolution structure of the prefusion state of the HIV-1 Env [59]. This study, however, showed that the TMD and the membrane-proximal regions of the Env are disordered, possibly due to incompatibility between the membrane-associated regions of the Env and the detergent used to solubilize the Env.",

The first challenge of NMR studies is preparing sufficient quantities of isotope labeled proteins and this is not trivial for small and hydrophobic proteins. A robust approach is to force high-level expression of the hydrophobic peptides, which are toxic to cells, into inclusion bodies. In our experience, the most effective implementation of this approach is to express the peptide as a C-terminal fusion to the trpLE protein (which drives inclusion body formation) in the pMM-LR6 vector [60\u201362] (Fig. 6.3a). The trpLE has an N-terminal 9\u00d7His tag to permit nickel affinity purification. A methionine between the trpLE and the peptide is added for cleavage by cyanogen bromide so that the peptide can be released from the trpLE. Purification of the peptide involves (1) purifying the trpLE-peptide fusion protein from the inclusion bodies by nickel affinity, (2) cleavage by cyanogen bromide of the fusion protein in formic acid, and (3) separation of the peptide from trpLE or fusion protein by reverse-phase HPLC. While the above protocol is quite general for hydrophobic peptides, it requires that the peptides have no methionine in the middle of the peptide sequence. If the native methionines cannot be mutated, an alternative method is to use soluble fusion domains (e.g., the maltose binding protein) with specific protease cleavage site for releasing the peptide.",

            "text": "The purified hydrophobic peptides can be reconstituted in any membrane mimetic media, including detergent micelles, bicelles, and lipid nanodiscs. While nanodiscs are the closest mimic of native membrane, we find that the lipid/detergent bicelle system is a good compromise between having the capacity to provide a near lipid bilayer environment and generating good NMR spectra. Previous studies on the bicelle system with 1,2-dimyristoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine (DMPC) as lipid and (1,2-dihexanoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine (DHPC) as detergent have shown that when the molar ratio of lipid to detergent (q) > 0.5, the assembly reaches the ideal bicelle condition in which the lipid and detergents are well segregated [63, 64]. At q = 0.5, for example, the estimated diameter of the lipid bilayer region of the bicelle disc is ~45 \u00c5 according to the equation describing bicelle assembly [64\u201366], and this size is sufficiently large to accommodate small TMDs. Remarkably, even bicelles of such size could generate NMR spectra of sufficiently high quality to enable full-scale structure determination, as was demonstrated for the structure determination of the trimeric TMDs of the Fas death receptor [67] and HIV-1 Env [68]. Here we provide an example of bicelle reconstitution from a previous study on the TMD of HIV-1 Env [68]. The hydrophobic peptides (lyophilized) are first completely dissolved in strong organic solvent (e.g., hexafluoro-isopropanal) with calculated amount of DMPC. The solution is slowly dried to a thin film under nitrogen stream. The dried film is then dissolved in 8 M Urea containing calculated amount of DHPC. The denaturant is removed by dialysis, during which the DMPC: DHPC ratio is monitored by 1D NMR, and the loss of DHPC during dialysis is compensated by further addition of DHPC.",

            "text": "Owing to the small size of most of the TMDs of viral membrane proteins, structure determination by NMR is normally straightforward. Probably the biggest challenge is measuring inter-protomer restraints in cases of oligomer complexes. In particular, structure determination of symmetric oligomers faces the challenge of measuring NOE-based 1H-1H distances between structurally equivalent protomers having the same NMR peaks, which are needed as inter-protomer restraints. A proven way to solve this problem is using a mixed sample in which half of the protomers are (15N, 2H)-labeled and the other half 13C-labelled, for measuring, exclusively, NOEs between the 15N-attached 1H of one protomer and 13C-attached 1H of the neighboring protomer [60, 69] (example from the TMD of the Fas receptor shown in Fig. 6.3b). Once the trimer solution is established, conventional 15N- and 13C- edited NOE experiments can then be used to collect self-consistent backbone-sidechain and sidechain-sidechain NOE restraints. In addition to structure determination, an important aspect of small TMDs is interaction with membrane. The bicelle system allows accurate determination of the position of TMD in the bilayer region of the bicelles using a solvent paramagnetic relaxation enhancement (PRE) analysis [63]. In this method, titration of the water-soluble and membrane-inaccessible paramagnetic agent, Gd-DOTA (Gadolinium (III) 1,4,7,10-Tetraazacyclododecane-1,4,7,10-tetraacetate), is used to generate the solvent PRE. This approach is based on the notion that if the bicelle is sufficiently wide, the lateral solvent PRE becomes negligible, thus allowing the use of measurable solvent PRE to probe residue-specific depth immersion of the protein along the bicelle normal. At each titration point, a 2D 1H-15N correlation spectrum is recorded to measure residue-specific PRE. For each of the residues, the PRE titration curve is fitted to exponential decay to derive the residue-specific PRE amplitude (PREamp). The PREamp vs. (residue position) along the trimer symmetry axis (parallel to the bilayer normal) is then analyzed using the sigmoidal fitting method [63] to determine the TMD region that resides at the center of the bilayer as well as the thickness of the bilayer around the protein.",

            "text": "For studying small molecule drug binding to viral membrane proteins, chemical shift perturbation (CSP) induced by drug titration is a convenient probe for identifying the approximate binding site. But, cautions need to be taken due to complications associated with membrane-mimetic media. First, many small molecule inhibitors are hydrophobic and preferentially partition into detergent micelles or lipid/detergent bicelles, and thus the CSP can be induced simply by alteration of the micelle/bicelle environment. Second, in addition to CSP caused by close ligand contact, CSP could arise from changes in conformation and/or dynamics. Hence, the more direct NOE data is preferred wherever feasible. The simplest and the most sensitive approach for collecting protein-drug NOE is using proteins that are 15N-labeled and completely deuterated so that NOE between the protein backbone amide protons and drug protons could be measured unambiguously (Fig. 6.3c). Once the binding site has been unambiguously spotted, further contacts between the drug and protein sidechains can be measured using conventional 13C-edited methyl or aromatic NOESY. Details of these experiments have been described in studies that identified the drug binding sites in the influenza AM2 and HCV p7 channels [60, 70, 71].",

The unstructured extracellular segment of AM2 is relatively conserved and has been sought after as a vaccine epitope [77\u201381]. BM2 has a similar sized TMD (residues 4\u201333), but a much larger C-terminal cytoplasmic domain [32, 82].

            "text": "The first high-resolution structures of the AM2 channel were reported concurrently by solution NMR spectroscopy and X-ray crystallography in 2008 [56, 62]. Subsequent X-ray and solution NMR studies also determined structures under different conditions [57] and with different drug resistance mutations [85, 86]. Moreover, structural characterization by solid-state NMR studies generated the channel structures in the lipid bilayer environment [87\u201389]. The above AM2 structures solved under different conditions show significantly different conformations (Fig. 6.4a), suggesting that the tetrameric assembly of the AM2 is quite dynamic and is sensitive to the reconstitution environment. The structural plasticity observed in AM2 is likely present in many other viral membrane proteins, which could explain why structural study of this type of proteins has been so difficult. Despite the differences, the experimental structures converged to a common mode of channel assembly: a left-handed four-helix bundle forms the channel pore, and that tetramerization of the four TM helices is further stabilized by intermolecular contacts between C-terminal amphipathic helices flanking the TMD [62, 88]. This mode of assembly places the \u201cH\u201d and \u201cW\u201d of the HxxxW sequence motif inside the channel (Fig. 6.4a). Four imidazole rings of His37, which are pH-gating features and are essential in transporting protons, are packed closely inside the pore (Fig. 6.4b). Moreover, packing of the Trp41 indoles creates a channel gate, which occludes the C-terminal end of the pore.",

Although the overall assembly of the BM2 TMD is similar to that of the AM2 TMD, i.e., both show left-handed helical packing, the two differ substantially in details (Fig. 6.4c). Unlike the AM2, the BM2 channel shows strong coiled-coil characteristics with regular heptad repeats [8]. In the BM2 structure, the two heptad repeats show that positions a and d are occupied mostly by hydrophilic residues such as serines and His19; positions g and e are occupied by hydrophobic leucines and phenylalanines, respectively, to allow for peripheral hydrophobic interactions between the leucines and phenylalanines (Fig. 6.4d). This arrangement for coiled-coil assembly in membrane allows the TM segment to form a stable tetramer by itself and is the opposite to that of water-soluble coiled-coil tetramer, in which positions a and d are typically hydrophobic residues and positions g and e are polar residues [90]. The histidine (His19) and tryptophan (Trp23) of the HxxxW motif are also pore-lining in the inverse coiled-coil assembly in membrane. The cytoplasmic domain of the BM2 also oligomerizes into a left-handed coiled-coil tetramer, but it is water-soluble and shows strong bipolar distribution in the surface charges. This charged domain supports the interaction with the M1 matrix protein [32].",

Functional mutagenesis [91] and NMR measurements [92] showed that proton transport across the membrane through the AM2 channel involves cycles of histidine protonation and deprotonation, and that the histidines serve as proton shuttling devices. Not all histidines can be protonated at the same time in the narrow channel, as protonation of one histidine would increase the energy barrier for the protonation of another histidine. Indeed, multiple pKa values (8.2, 6.3 and one below 5.0) have been detected in the AM2 [91, 93]. Therefore, our current understanding of the proton conduction mechanism is that the minimally required unit for pH-dependent proton conduction in the AM2 and BM2 is the His-Trp complex. It was proposed in ref. [93] that in the non-conductive state two pairs of histidines in the tetramer each share one proton, which explains the high pKa ~8.2. Lowering pH results in the protonation of the third histidine from the N-terminal side, which, in turn, disrupts the two histidine dimers and leads to the proton conductive state. It was also proposed that protonation of histidines leads to cation-\u03c0 interactions between the histidine and tryptophan [94, 95]. The remaining question to be addressed is how does the third protonation affect the tryptophan conformation, allowing proton to be relayed to the C-terminal side of the tryptophan gate [91].",

            "text": "The viroporin p7 encoded by the HCV genome is a 63-residue protein that oligomerizes in membrane to form cation-selective channels [15, 16], with higher selectivity for Ca2+ than K+/Na+ [96, 97]. The channel activity of p7 is important for the assembly and release of infectious viruses, although the molecular mechanism of this function remains unknown [27, 28]. As in the case of AM2, structural characterization of p7 was confronted with challenges of coping with the hydrophobic and dynamic nature of the protein. Earlier NMR studies of p7 under conditions that support the monomeric state of the protein showed that p7 has three TM helical segments: two in the N-terminal half of the sequence and one near the C-terminus [97, 98]. Although the monomeric state should not conduct ions, it could be involved in interacting with the NS2 protein during virus assembly [33, 34]. The oligomeric form of p7 was first examined using single-particle EM, which showed that p7 from HCV genotype 2a (JFH-1 strain) assembles into hexamers in 1,2-diheptanoyl-snglycero-3-phosphocholine (DH7PC) micelles and the complex adopts a flower-like shape that does not resemble any of the known ion channel structures in the database [99]. Later, a more detailed structure of the p7 hexamer was determined by solution NMR using p7 from genotype 5a (EUH1480 strain) reconstituted in dodecylphosphocholine (DPC) micelles [60]. Consistent with the flower-shaped EM images, the NMR structure shows a funnel-like architecture with six minimalist chains, each containing three helical segments: H1, H2, and H3. The H1 and H2 form the narrow and wide regions of the funnel-shaped cavity, respectively, and the H3 helices wrap the channel peripheral by interacting with H1 and H2 (Fig. 6.5a). The assembly strategy adopted by p7 differs significantly from those known channels from bacteria and eukaryotes.",

The channel interior of p7 has a number of strongly conserved residues that are likely candidates to serve the above functions. One suspect is Asn9, which forms a ring of carboxamide near the narrow end of the channel (Fig. 6.5b). Residue 9 is asparagine in all strains except being substituted with histidine in genotype 2 viruses. Formation of a ring of carboxylates or carboxamides has been a recurring theme in prokaryotic and eukaryotic channels that have selectivity for divalent cations. For examples, the CorA Mg2+ channel has a pentameric ring of asparagines [102], and the calcium release-activated calcium (CRAC) channel Orai has a hexameric ring of aspartic acids [103]. These channels all have strong selectivity for divalent cations, although they can also conduct monovalent cations such as Na+ and K+. In addition to the Asn9 ring, residues near the hinge between H1 and H2 (Ser12, Asn16, Trp21) are in an arrangement that may also bind cations (Fig. 6.5b), although these residues have not yet been tested in functional assays.",

Placement of a positively charged ring at the entrance was anticipated because it may repel cations. But an earlier study reported that a designed TM barrel with internal arginine-histidine dyads forms efficient cation selective channels [104] because the immobile arginines can recruit mobile anions, which in turn facilitate cations to diffuse through the pore. It is interesting to note that a highly basic region containing Arg155, Lys159 and Lys163 in the pore was also found in the CRAC Orai structure [103]. One possible role of these basic residues in cation selective channels is binding and obstructing anions while allowing cations to diffuse into the pore. This mechanism would be consistent with the observation that replacing Arg35 with negatively charged aspartic acid largely abrogated conductance [60].",

Or was p7 developed as a general, unspecific cation channel for the purpose of dissipating membrane potential? For example, another recently study reported p7 activity in dissipating proton gradients within cell membrane compartments [105]. It is unclear what ion flux mediated by p7 plays a dominant role in the HCV life cycle. From a structural perspective, the funnel-like architecture is formed with multiple helical segments connected by hinges and short loops and we believe this flexibility can afford the dynamic opening and closing of the tip of the channel.",

Amantadine (Symadine) or rimantadine (Flumadine) was the first licensed drug for treating influenza infections [106]. In fact, the compound also played critical roles in the early days of functional characterization of the AM2 channel [107\u2013109]. The BM2 channel is a functional and structural homolog of AM2 but is not sensitive to the adamantane family of drugs [11]. Remarkably, the HCV p7 channel structure is completely different but showed detectable, though not strong, sensitivity to rimantadine [15, 110]. The mechanism of how amantadine/rimantadine inhibit the AM2 channel has been elusive for quite some time. Previous confusion came mainly from the multiple binding sites that have been observed experimentally. In a crystallographic study of the AM2 TMD (residues 24\u201346) in the presence of amantadine, the drug density was found inside the channel near residue Ser31, but at structural resolution of 3.5 \u00c5, it was difficult to confirm the position of amantadine binding [56]. At the same time, however, a solution NMR study of a longer version of AM2 (residues 18\u201360) showed that rimantadine binds to an external, lipid-facing pocket around residue Asp44 between adjacent TM helices [62].",

One is the drug directly blocking the channel passage, and the other is the drug binding to the external site allosterically favors the closed state of the channel. Subsequent solid-state NMR measurements of the AM2 in lipid bilayer showed that both sites exist, with higher affinity for the internal site [87]. The strongest evidence that the internal site is the primary site of drug action came from functional studies using an AM2-BM2 chimera protein [111, 112]. In this study, the authors constructed a chimera of M2 variants from influenza A and B viruses that contains only internal site showed that the chimera channel is still amantadine sensitive, indicating that the internal site is the primary site of drug inhibition. Later, the complex structure of the TMD of the chimera with rimantadine was determined by solution NMR, providing a detailed view of the drug binding inside the channel pore [70]. The drug binding site consists of eight methyl groups of the M2 tetramer (two from each subunit: Val27 C\u03b31H3 and Ala30 C\u03b2H3) that form a deep internal hydrophobic pocket surrounding the adamantane cage of the drug (Fig. 6.6a). The structure also shows that the nitrogen of the rimantadine amino group may form a hydrogen bond with the backbone carbonyl oxygen of Ala30 of one of the four subunits. The terminal methyl group of the rimantadine is in the middle of the pore, facing the open space in the channel around the Gly34 position. The structure also shows that rimantadine binding is slightly tilted: its vertical axis is on average ~20\u00b0 from the C4 symmetry axis of the channel. The tilt angle is consistent with the amantadine tilt in the M2 channel observed with solid-state NMR spectroscopy [87].",

            "text": "In addition to blocking the AM2 channel, the amantadine and its derivatives have also been shown to pose some inhibitory effects on the p7 channel conductance [15, 113]. The physical binding sites of amantadine and rimantadine have been identified in p7 of genotype 5a using intermolecular NOE experiments [60]. The NOE data revealed that amantadine or rimantadine binds to six equivalent hydrophobic pockets (due to the six-fold symmetry of the p7 channel) between the pore-forming and peripheral helices (Fig. 6.6b). In each site, Leu52, Leu53, and Leu56 from H3 and Val25, Val26, and Phe20 from H2 appear to form a hydrophobic pocket that wraps around the adamantane cage of the drug. The amino group of amantadine or rimantadine is facing the largely hydrophilic channel lumen. An important property of the drug binding site is that it consists of elements from different helical segments and from different monomers. As rationalized above, permeation of cations through the p7 channel may depend on opening the narrow end of the funnel, which in turn depends on the reorientation of the helical segments. The binding of adamantane derivatives to the pocket may inhibit channel activity allosterically by causing the channel to close. Indeed, an NMR relaxation dispersion study showed that residues at the H1-H2 hinge (Phe19) and the narrow end of the cavity (Val7, Leu8) experienced substantial chemical exchanges (kex~1000 \u00b1 79 s\u22121 and ~10% excited state). This data is consistent with movements of the H1 helices that cause the tip of the funnel to open and close. More importantly, addition of rimantadine slowed down motion at the tip of the channel, as relaxation dispersion curve for Val7, which has significant chemical exchange in the apo state, is completely flat in the drug-bound state [114]. The dispersion curve of Phe19 is also significantly flatter, and individual curve fit yielded kex value of 67 \u00b1 182 s\u22121. Clearly, rimantadine binding makes the channel less dynamic. Therefore, the rimantadine may thus act as a \u201cmolecular wedge\u201d that prevents the dynamic \u201cbreathing\u201d of the channel required for ion conduction.",

In the case of AM2, one drug binds to one channel. Drug binding inhibits proton transport by directly blocking the channel passage; it also prevents channel from opening. In the case of p7, amantadine and rimantadine are clearly too small to block the channel. They instead bind to six equivalent sites outside of the channel cavity, which can afford up to six drugs per channel. If rimantadine binding to this site is relevant to inhibition, as crudely suggested by previous functional mutagenesis, drug binding to these sites inhibits cation conduction with an allosteric mechanism, possibly by stabilizing the closed state of the channel.",

In the case of the AM2 tetramer, the drug adamantane cage fits snuggly in a hydrophobic pocket formed by eight methyl groups from Val27 and Ala30 (two from each subunit), while the drug amino group forms polar contact with the backbone oxygen of Ala30 and points to the polar region of the channel cavity. For the p7 channel, the adamantane cage is in contact with ten methyl groups and an aromatic group from the protein. These hydrophobic groups form a deep hydrophobic pocket that also matches closely the size of the adamantane cage. The amino group of amantadine or rimantadine points to the channel lumen; it is in position to form polar contacts with the electronegative groups such as backbone carbonyl of residues 15\u201317. Hence, having a greasy pocket for the adamantane cage and a nearby electronegative group to interact with the amino group may be a general requirement for amantadine or rimantadine binding.",

The gp120 and gp41 are the receptor recognition and membrane fusion proteins, respectively. Conformational changes in gp120 when triggered by binding to receptor (CD4) and co-receptor (e.g., CCR5 or CXCR4) lead to a cascade of refolding events in gp41 (similar to those illustrated in Fig. 6.2a), and ultimately to membrane fusion [39, 124\u2013126]. The mature and functional Env spikes, (gp120/gp41)3, are the sole antigens on the virion surface and thus important candidates for vaccine development [127, 128]. The native prefusion conformation of HIV-1 Env is recognized by most broadly neutralizing antibodies (bnAbs) [129\u2013131] and it is generally believed to have the potential to induce such antibody responses. Thus, the native conformation of Env spikes on the surface of virions is extremely important to immunogen design in B-cell based vaccine development.",

It has been shown that truncations in the cytoplasmic tail (CT) of gp41 could alter the antigenic surface of the Env ECD on the opposite side of the membrane [129], suggesting that the ECD, the TMD, and the membrane proximal regions are conformationally coupled, and thus the conformational stability of the TMD is an important consideration for immunogen design in B-cell based HIV-1 vaccine development. Recently, the NMR structure of the gp41 TMD has been solved in bicelles (made of DMPC lipid and DHPC detergent; q = 0.5) [68] using a gp41 fragment (residues 677\u2013716) from a clade D HIV-1 isolate 92UG024.2, designated gp41HIV1D(677\u2013716).

The GxxxG is a well-known motif that drives TMH dimerization [58, 140, 141]. In the classic example of the glycophorin A TMD dimer structure, the two glycines of one TMH allow close packing with the GxxxG face of another TMH, resulting in a very strong TMH dimeric complex [58, 140]. There has been no previous report, however, of the GxxxG involvement in TMH trimerization. In the coiled-coil region of the HIV-1 Env TMD, only G690 is involved in the trimer assembly, i.e., its small sidechain allows a close VDW contact with V689 of the adjacent TMH. The other glycine, G694, is on the periphery of the trimer facing outwards and its mutation to alanine or valine has essentially no effect on TMD trimerization, as well as Env functions [68]. Therefore, the key difference in the structural role of the GxxxG motif between the glycophorin A TMD dimer and HIV-1 Env TMD trimer is that both the glycines are required for forming inter-monomer contacts in the dimer, while only one glycine is important for the trimeric assembly.",

No high-resolution structure of any TMD oligomer from other viral fusion proteins has been reported, due to technical challenges for structural studies of such constructs in the context of lipid bilayer.

The available structures also suggest that viroporins generally adopt minimalist architecture and can possess structural features compatible with selective ion transport. The viral channels, however, may not be as functionally robust or specifically regulated as some of their counterparts in prokayrotes and eukaryotes, because viruses often do not need intricate regulation of channel activities during their infection cycles. Having minimalist structure also makes viroporins fragile and sensitive to the membrane environment. This is reflected by the conformational variations observed for the AM2 channel in different reconstitution media. Therefore, it remains important to examine these viroporins in more native environments, e.g., lipid bilayer and full-length proteins. As solid-state NMR continues to improve spectral resolution [87, 89], obtaining detailed structures of viroporins in liposomes should in principle be feasible in the near future. Alternatively, the ideal bicelle system can be explored with solution NMR to revisit some of the viroporin structures determined previously in detergent micelles. Future establishment of the NMR systems for viroporins under more native conditions would certainly provide versatile and effective platforms for investigating inhibitor binding.",

The NMR structural study of the HIV-1 gp41 TMD in bicelles with q = 0.5 [68] demonstrates that the structures of most of the viral fusion protein TMDs can in principle be determined in essentially lipid bilayer environment using modern NMR techniques. Moreover, the combined use of ideal bicelles (q \u2265 0.5) and solvent paramagnetic relaxation enhancement measurements can be used to determine the membrane partition of the TMDs in the bilayer region of the bicelles [63]. We believe the next major challenge lies in understanding the roles of the fusion protein TMDs in the fusion mechanism. In the cases of the flu HA and HIV gp41, for example, new experiments need to be designed to address questions such as, \u201cDoes the TMD interact with the fusion domain in the hemifusion stage in which the two domains are presumably in close proximity?\u201d and \u201cDoes the TMD play a role in facilitating the conversion from the hemifusion to the pore formation?\u201d",

The continuous structure from the N- to C- terminal ends of the Env TMD, as observed by NMR, suggests that the Env ECD can be structurally coupled via the TMD. Indeed, it has also been shown that the Env TMD can also modulate the antigenic structure of the ECD in a cell-cell fusion assay and a pseudovirus-based neutralization assay [68]. The results show direct correlation that more disrupted TMD trimer led to less inhibition or neutralization by the trimer-specific bnAbs that target only the ECD.

The MPER sequence is extremely conserved with five absolutely conserved tryptophans, suggesting that the MPER probably also has interesting structural features. The conformation of the MPER attached to the TMD trimer in a lipid bilayer environment is still unknown (Fig. 6.7d). Previous NMR studies of an isolated MPER peptide in detergent micelle suggested that the MPER is monomeric and folds into a kinked helix with many hydrophobic residues embedded in the micelles [151, 152]. This of course would have a rather negative implication for the MPER as a vaccine epitope because antibodies that bind to the MPER must dig it out of the lipids, which could be accompanied with polyreactivities.

Virion attaches directly host cell receptors on the membrane (2). and subsequently enters the cell by receptor-mediated endocytosis (3). Acidification of the endosomal vesicles triggers conformational changes in the virion, resulting in fusion between the viral and the endosomal membranes, allowing the release of the nucleocapsid into the cytoplasm. The viral RNA is then released into the cytoplasm and presented to the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) (4). At the ER, viral RNA is translated into protein that is processed by viral and host proteases (5). After the viral replication complex is synthesized, RNA synthesis begins by the transcription of an antisense viral RNA followed by the amplification of viral RNA (6). The newly synthesized RNA is subsequently packaged by capsid protein, forming a nucleocapsid (7). Virus assembly occurs on the surface of the ER when the nucleocapsid buds into the ER lumen, then transported through the Golgi, where acidification induces virus maturation (8). Mature viral particles are released in the neutral pH of the extracellular millieu (A) viral entry, which acidifies the virion interior immediately after endocytosis and facilitates RNA release (B) Dissipation of the proton gradient in the Golgi and the trans-Golgi network. The viroporins influenza A virus (IAV) matrix protein 2 (M2) and hepatitis C virus (HCV) p7 equilibrate the proton concentration with the cytosol to reduce the acidification of vesicular acidic compartments (C) viroporins play an essential role in assembly, budding and release of the viral particles (D) Alteration of cellular Ca2+ homeostasis.
