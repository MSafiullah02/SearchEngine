            "text": "Zoonoses are classically, though not without controversy, defined as infections or diseases naturally transmitted between humans and vertebrate animals. There are approximately 1400 human pathogens, of which about 800 species are zoonotic. Of the approximate 180 emerging or reemerging pathogens in the past 3 decades, 130 are known to be zoonotic, with a disproportionate number of the new zoonoses being caused by RNA viruses. As a recent editorial states, this is a microbial world that humans are barely allowed to live in, and nothing microbes do or become should surprise us. We have little ability to predict how an emerging zoonotic pathogen will act. Most zoonotic pathogens, like rabies, enter a human and cause disease, but in these cases, humans are dead-end hosts and are unlikely to transmit the disease to others. Less commonly, pathogens such as human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) or recombinant swine H1N1 enter the human population with great difficulty but are then successfully transmitted to cause global epidemics solely from human-to-human transfer. The recent emphasis on emerging infections, which are predominantly zoonoses, and the potential for new pandemics markedly enhance the need for human medicine to be integrated with veterinary medicine and veterinary research.",

Ticks are the more common villain, and Lyme disease is the most common arthropod-transmitted infectious disease in the United States. Not all arthropod-transmitted diseases are zoonotic. For instance, arthropod-transmitted infections such as West Nile fever, Schistosoma japonicum, and Trypanosoma rhodesiense are zoonoses, whereas Schistosoma mansoni, Trypanosoma gambiense, Wuchereria bancrofti, Onchocerca volvulus, and vivax malaria are not; these non-zoonoses cause more than a billion infections per year, are transferred from human to human, and do not depend on vertebrate reservoirs.

Raw shellfish, which are the \u201cgarbage filters\u201d of the ocean, can transmit at least 25 different infectious or toxic diseases to humans, but shellfish are invertebrates, and such diseases are not zoonoses. Ticks can introduce more than one pathogen while feeding; Lyme disease, ehrlichiosis, and babesiosis can all be transmitted by a single tick bite. Threats from mosquito bites include St. Louis encephalitis and West Nile virus. Patrons of petting zoos, pet owners, farmers, hunters, laboratory researchers, cave explorers, hikers, and veterinarians, among others, are at higher risk for a zoonosis than is the general population. Infectious agents transmitted by these routes from animal sources essentially include members of all microbial classes: viruses and prions, bacteria and rickettsia, fungi, helminths, and protozoa. Immunocompromised hosts, such as splenectomized patients, transplant recipients, patients with acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS), and pregnant women and their fetuses, are at higher risk for clinical disease when exposed to these various infectious agents. Chagas\u2019 disease, a protozoal infection, is a zoonosis in South America but is not endemic to the United States; however, immigration from Latin America has led to an estimated 300,000 persons with Trypanosoma cruzi infection, usually subclinical, in the United States and the potential for transmission of the infection through blood or organ donations. Leishmania donovani is almost always a small-animal reservoir zoonosis, but in India, it has set up shop with just human-to-human insect transfer.",

Viral incubation of the three influenza species in the pig, with a reassortment of antigens and subsequent spread of virulent \u201cnew\u201d influenza strains to humans, can lead to massive influenza pandemics that in sheer numbers (billions) surpass any past epidemics of smallpox or plague. Initially, HIV-1 and HIV-2 were transmitted as simian immunodeficiency viruses from chimpanzees and mangabey primates, respectively, to humans. As with influenza, the subsequent 33 million (and counting) cases of HIV no longer require an animal reservoir for continuing transmission. Because these pandemics of AIDS and influenza now spread human to human without the help of the initiating animal host, the World Health Organization no longer considers them zoonoses.",
