As a result of high-throughput sequencing, the research community now appreciates that the breadth of microbial diversity within BEs are several orders of magnitude higher than previously reported using culture-dependent methods.1 In addition, while earlier phylogenetic marker gene-based targeted sequencing studies have identified the microbial community members within BEs, studies using shotgun metagenomics sequencing have further surveyed the functional potentials of a microbial community, thus enabling one to gain new insights into metabolic, virulence, and resistance potentials of the air microbiome.2, 3More recent efforts have also linked microbial communities and chemical compositions detected in various indoor environments, in attempts to detect relationships between microbiome and potential microbial metabolites and other chemicals present in BEs.3\n",

This will be followed by a brief historical account of BE microbiology, describing the earliest works looking at microorganisms in indoor settings. A description of some of the common contemporary methods applied to study the indoor microbiome, from sampling to data analysis, will also be provided. Different compartments of the indoor microbiome, such as air-, surface-, and dust-associated microbial communities, as well as building designs and other factors that may be important in driving differences in the BE microbiome will be summarized. While most of the current BE microbiome works using high-throughput sequencing pertain to bacteria and fungi, studies involving other members of microbial life will also be briefly discussed. The subsequent description of the transmission of microbiomes within the BE, including the risk of pathogens and their spread within BEs, will underscore the importance of understanding the BE microbiome. Finally, future outlooks in BE microbiome research will be presented.",

These building properties can shape distinct microbiomes in similar BEs. The core BE microbiome in general consisted of microorganisms with outdoor environmental origins, as well as contributions coming from indoor occupants such as humans and pets. Moreover, activities of occupants may also play major roles in shaping the BE microbiome.4, 6, 7 In addition, depending on the operational function and purpose of the BE (from single-family residential buildings to commercial buildings), building characteristics and indoor environmental factors including temperature, humidity, and airflow rates (as controlled, for example by a heating, ventilation, and air conditioning (HVAC) system) are adjusted to maximize occupant comfort. These factors are associated with changes in indoor microbial communities, but their roles may be modest compared to that of BE design, occupancy, and outdoor influences, depending on the BE (see Section 6.08.6).",

Multiple studies have demonstrated that cohabitation affects the composition and structure of skin-associated microbial communities, and that residential cohabitants share more similar skin microbiomes suggesting that the BEs at least have an indirect effect on an individual's microbiome.6 The rapid spread of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) virus within a residential complex in Hong Kong in 2003 (see Section 6.08.8) is a clear example for the need to understand the roles of different BEs, environmental and occupancy factors in transmitting pathogens, so that such transmissions can be prevented in the future.",

Microbiologists typically were able to cultivate common occupant-associated bacteria including species of Staphylococcus as well as environmental members including Bacillus.8 However, culture-dependent methods inherently present numerous limitations in BE microbiome research. Firstly, only a small fraction of naturally occurring microorganisms can be cultivated in laboratory growth conditions. Hence, the microbial diversity obtained from culture-dependent methods has been greatly underrepresented. Indeed, studies that include both culture-dependent and culture-independent works unanimously highlight the extended microbial diversity detected via culture-independent methods, including the identification of potentially pathogenic species, which were otherwise undetected using culture-dependent methods.8, 9 Lee et al.8 also uncovered a much wider range of bacterial diversity in a daycare facility using 16S rRNA gene clone libraries, and most of these bacterial species were not detected when the same samples were cultivated. Notably, through 16S clone sequencing, the authors have established that pseudomonads were considered to be a core group of microorganisms in the childcare facility, even when members of this group were only sporadically detected on agar plates.",

While Sanger sequencing has granted building scientists with an expanded view of the breadth of microbial diversity present in BEs, Sanger sequencing has been superseded by the pyrosequencing method, developed by 454 Life Sciences (Roche, Branford, USA), due to the reduced labor time, cost, and increased sequencing depth. With the advent of pyrosequencing, an increased number of BE microbiome studies had been conducted, and these previous works gave scientists early insights into the effects of building design, occupants and their activities, geography, climate, and time on indoor bacterial and fungal communities.1, 4 While pyrosequencing was the preferred sequencing method of choice for a period of time since its introduction, pyrosequencing has lost its competitiveness to Illumina sequencing (because of its increased sequencing depth and hence reduced cost per nucleotide), which is currently the most commonly used sequencing platform for microbiome analysis. Illumina sequencing is the current sequencing platform of choice for analyzing the BE microbiome, especially when shotgun metagenomics sequencing is employed.2, 3, 4 More recently, third-generation high-throughput sequencing platforms, such as the Pacific Biosciences and the Oxford Nanopore technologies, allow for longer read length (comparable to those offered by Sanger sequencing, making full-length 16S rRNA gene sequencing possible, see Section 6.08.4.3), thereby potentially enabling more accurate and specific identification and community analyses of BE microorganisms.",

The load of bacteria and viruses on contaminated surfaces was significantly reduced through a single wipe with a wet fabric, and the treatment with disinfectant resulted in additional reduction of all pathogens probably by the means of inactivation. However, a recent study by Kwan and colleagues21 demonstrated that skin-associated microorganisms can return and re-establish onto surfaces in schools within days following routine cleaning, and suggested that schools may require more frequent cleaning to reduce the transmission of potential pathogens between occupants.",

Hence, it is expected that the indoor dust microbial community is largely shaped by outdoor environmental conditions when a large geographic scale is considered. Consistent with this expectation, a global survey of household dust reported that phylogenetically distinct fungal communities were identified for each region, and the fungal communities in temperate zones were more diverse than those in the tropics.22 Within a smaller geographic scale, the seasonality pattern may be reflected in the dynamics of indoor dust microbial community when a long time scale is considered.",

Consistent with this, airborne bacterial communities in naturally ventilated rooms resembled adjacent outdoor air, while distinct microbial community was found in rooms with mechanical ventilation. In addition, mechanically ventilated rooms harbored less diverse microbial communities than naturally ventilated rooms.6 Similar to indoor air, the type of ventilation was also shown to affect the structure of indoor dust microbiome.

Following reports of respiratory conditions of lifeguards around a hospital pool area, Angenant et al.9 were able to detect Mycobacterium sequences, among other potential respiratory pathogens, in the air directly above the indoor warm-water therapy pool, thereby providing possible mechanism of spread of mycobacterial pathogens from the pool to the lifeguards. More recently, using a fluorescence-based and particle-counting bioaerosol sensor, a hospital-based study demonstrated the potential for dispersion of particle-associated microorganisms from various textiles used in patient rooms across the hospital.29 The authors reported that bacteria (some of which may be pathogens) presumably associated with hospital patients and personnel can be spread across multiple floors and be detected in textile holding rooms with minimal occupancy, suggesting that the spread of pathogens into a BE may not need to directly involve occupants. These studies also highlight the need for potential changes in building operation to prevent transmission of pathogens within BEs, such as increase of air circulation in the therapy pool environment9 or additional personal protective equipment when handling hospital gowns and linens.29\n",

In the study of Marks et al.,\n30 they inoculated and compared the viability of streptococci on plastic and hand surfaces following planktonic or biofilm growth in the laboratory. Biofilm cells remained viable on surfaces for extended periods of time compared to their planktonic counterparts, and biofilm cells were able to colonize the upper respiratory tracts of mice even after a month of being inoculated onto BE surfaces.

Recent advances in molecular microbiology technologies now enable us to obtain high-depth-resolution profiling of microbial communities in terms of composition, structure and function. For example, while previous clone library-based analyses provide functional potential profiles of the microbial community in and around BEs at limited depths, recent metagenomics analyses allow BE scientists to directly answer questions related to microbial virulence and resistance potentials within BEs, species- and strain-level classification of BE microorganisms and their potential sources, and various aspects of BE that may affect microbial functional profiles.2, 3Metagenomic sequencing also allows in-depth analysis of the microbiome consisting of organisms other than bacteria or fungi, such as the BE viral community. In addition, advances of sequencing technology platforms have pushed the development of new and improved bioinformatic tools that may allow for more meaningful analyses of the BE microbiome. For instance, the inherent low-biomass nature associated with some BEs have been met with benchmarking works4, 17 in order to maximize the biomass yield, while minimizing erroneous and contaminating sequences that may otherwise take up a large proportion of sequencing data.",

Adopting an optimized protocol for RNA isolation and preservation, the authors revealed that the viable components of the residential microbiome differ greatly from the total genetic pool of the same BE, and a sizable portion of the BE microbiome as determined by DNA methods may not represent viable organisms.

Given our understanding of how building designs may affect the indoor microbiome, it is unclear whether the use of these energy-efficient BE designs may also affect the microbial communities of these buildings.

Although several studies reported similar relationships between occupant, environment, and BE regardless of green building certification, it is unknown whether these studies are representative of BEs around the world, as each BE is dependent on social, cultural, regulatory, and climatic considerations that are specific to the location of the BE.16 Therefore, additional focus is required to gain insights into microbial exposures of occupants in energy-efficient buildings to provide a more comprehensive view of the energy-efficient building microbiome.",
