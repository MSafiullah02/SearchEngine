The taxonomic distribution of the gene, \"percomORF\", indicates insertion into the ancestral lineage >110 Ma, making it the oldest known conserved gene of viral origin in a vertebrate genome. Underscoring its ancient provenence, percomORF exists as an isolated ORF within the intron of a widely conserved host gene, with no discernible proviral sequence nearby. Despite its remarkable age, percomORF retains canonical features of a retroviral glycoprotein, and tests for selection strongly suggest cooption for a host function. Retroviral envelope genes have been coopted for a role in placentogenesis by numerous lineages of mammals, including eutherians and marsupials, representing a variety of placental structures. Therefore percomORF's presence within the group Percomorpha-unique among spiny-finned fishes in having evolved placentation and live birth-is especially intriguing.",

Most of these endogenous retrovirus (ERV) sequences are overwritten by mutations over time, but occasionally an ERV gene is coopted for a function that benefits the host, and becomes fixed in the population. While investigating the origins of a sequence that had been published as potentially representing a remnant of a filovirus in the genome of the stickleback (Gasterosteus aculeatus) (Belyi et al. 2010) , we found that the sequence is actually part of an ORF encoding a complete and intact retroviral envelope glycoprotein.

We were able to trace the DNAJC6 coding region across 18 exons in Xiphophorus maculatus, and percomORF lies within the last intron, between exons 17 and 18, in opposite orientation to DNAJC6 ( fig. 1 ). This distinctive location allowed us to establish that percomORF is in a syntenic position in all 20 species and thus arose from a single event in a common ancestor. We also examined the corresponding regions in other teleost lineages to generate a presence/absence profile ( fig. 2 ). Its presence in multiple lineages of Percomorphaceae indicates that percomORF originated no more recently than 109-140 Ma, the estimated range for the Percomorphaceae divergence Betancur-R et al. 2013) .",

For example, the maintenance of receptor-binding function is suggested by 14 cysteines positionally conserved in the region corresponding to the surface (SU) subunit ( fig. 1 ). Cysteines in SU typically help the protein fold into a globular conformation that functions in receptor binding (Chiou et al. 1992 ; van Anken et al. 2008) . Likewise, percomORF retains motifs associated with membrane fusion such as: (1) a run of basic residues typical of a canonical furin cleavage site by which SU and the fusion subunit (TM) are cleaved to generate a fusion-ready trimer of heterodimers and (2) a stretch of hydrophobic residues at the N-terminus of TM, consistent with the fusion peptide. The CX 6 CC motif in the region coding for TM is typical of retroviruses whose subunits are joined by a covalent disulfide LETTER \u00df The Author 2016.

Interestingly, percomORF encodes three such motifs ( fig. 1 ). In addition to the conservation of motifs associated with function, exaptation is further supported by dN/dS analysis (sup plementary table S2, Supplementary Material online). Under various evolutionary models, we found that between 189 and 232 of the 422 codons analyzed have dN/dS values that are consistent with a regime of strong purifying selection (average dN/dS: 0.25), while only a handful of positions (0-5) have dN/ dS ratios suggesting positive selection.",

However, although filovirus glycoproteins are known to share structural features with retroviral glycoproteins (Gallaher 1996; Weissenhorn et al. 1998; Jeffers et al. 2002) , several motifs encoded by percomORF are specific to retroviruses. These are (1) isomerase motifs in SU, which are common in retroviruses with covalently-bonded subunits (Pinter et al. 1997; Wallin et al. 2004 ; Henzy and Coffin 2013) but have not been found in filoviruses; (2) a fusion peptide that is N-terminal, whereas filoviral fusion peptides are internal and flanked by cysteines and (3) a motif (QNRAALD) in the immunosuppressive domain (ISD) that is typical of nonmammalian retroviruses rather than filoviruses (Henzy and Johnson 2013) .

Indeed, all of the percomORF loci we identified contained no discernible retroviral genes within a 10-kb flanking window, consistent with previous findings (Belyi et al. 2010) . Whereas retroviruses insert a DNA copy of the entire viral genome (known as a \"provirus\") into host DNA as a normal part of replication, other endogenous virus sequences are thought to arise through the interaction of viral mRNA with a retrotransposon such as a LINE-1 element (Horie et al. 2010; Katzourakis and Gifford 2010; Taylor et al. 2010) , and thus exist as isolated genes. However, at a different locus we found a bona fide retroviral provirus in the Japanese eel (GenBank: KI305800.1) with a predicted Env protein that has 50% amino acid identity with the original partial sequence (compared with only 32% identity seen with Reston ebolavirus), serving as additional evidence for the retroviral origin of percomORF.

An analysis of Fv-1 orthologous sites suggests that the locus has undergone multiple insertions, deletions, and rearrangements in various lineages, which may have caused the loss of proviral sequence in mice while the gene itself was maintained under selection (GR Young and JP Stoye, personal communication). The location of percomORF within the intron of DNAJC6 allowed us to compare the flanking sequence among the 20 orthologs. Similar to Fv-1, the regions flanking percomORF are very poorly conserved both in sequence and in length ( fig. 1) , consistent with loss of proviral sequence due to degeneration of neutral sites over a long period of evolution. By the same reasoning, it is likely that any markings of noncanonical integration, such as the inverted repeats that accompany LINE-1-mediated insertion, would be erased by mutations. Notably, the much \"younger\" ERVWE1 locus-a co-opted env gene originating from a retroviral insertion in the genome of a hominoid ancestor 25-40 Ma-is part of a provirus in which the gag and pol genes have acquired multiple inactivating mutations (Mallet et al., 2004) .",

Fv-4, for example, is a partial retroviral glycoprotein sequence in mice that expresses a defective envelope protein (Ikeda and Sugimura 1989 ) that binds to its cognate receptor, downregulating or blocking its expression (Kai et al. 1986 ) and thereby protecting the host from infection by related retroviruses (Limjoco et al. 1993) . Other examples exploit the fusogenicity of the glycoprotein. Mammalian \"syncytins\", for example, are maintained in various lineages for their ability to fuse syncytiotrophoblast cells during formation of the placenta (Lavialle et al. 2013) , and appear to contribute to myoblast fusion in mice (Redelsperger et al. 2016) . Syncytin-mediated cell-cell fusion is mechanistically analogous to membrane fusion during entry of the virus into the target cell. Thus, syncytins must maintain the fusion-mediating domains of retroviral Env proteins in addition to receptor-binding regions. The maintenance of fusionrelated motifs in percomORF suggests that it could provide a fusogenic function. Moreover, the predicted cytoplasmic tail (CT) of percomORF is unusually short (supplementary fig. S1 , Supplementary Material online) compared with that of related retroviral glycoproteins. The C-terminal 16 amino acids of the CT of murine leukemia viruses (MLVs) is cleaved by a viral protease to activate fusion (Yang and Compans 1997) , and in HIV-1, truncation of the CT has been shown to increase cell-cell fusion in vitro (Kolchinsky et al. 2001 ). Therefore, a truncated CT in percomORF could represent selection for fusogenicity.",

The maintenance of an intact ORF and canonical functional motifs, its expression in stickleback embryos, together with dN/dS analyses strongly suggest that percomORF has been coopted by the host species. The role of similar retroviral env genes in chorionic structures and placenta formation in mammals, combined with percomORF's association with the only group of fish in which placentation evolved leads naturally to speculation on a syncytin-like role for percomORF. However, follow-up studies involving a wider range of taxa and morphological data; expression profiles in a variety of tissue types and developmental stages; and assays for fusogenicity of the protein, are needed to assess its role in the evolution of ray-finned fishes.",
