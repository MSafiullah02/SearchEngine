            "text": "Post-transcriptional regulation of gene expression and viral functions, i.e. regulation on the level of gene-specific RNAs usually involve structural and functional domains of cellular mRNAs or viral transcripts. For example, the TAR element of the human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1), a sequence stretch of approximately 60 nucleotides within the 5\u2032-region of genomic HIV-1 RNA as well as the 5\u2032-portion of viral mRNAs, adopts a thermodynamically stable stem/loop structure that is functionally involved in the regulation of elongation of transcription [1]. Further, internal ribosomal entry sites, mostly found in viral sequences, form defined structural elements that are necessary for translation of protein-coding transcripts (for review see. [2,3]. On the level of cellular genes, an extra-stable local folding unit of the 5\u2032-untranslated region of the murine p53 mRNA seems to be involved in post-transcriptional control of its level of protein translation [4]. In summary, structural and functional RNA modules, often located upstream of the translational initiation site or overlapping with it, are known to be involved in the regulation of protein biosynthesis. Such regulatory local RNA folding units may interact with modulators such as complementary RNA sequences in case of microRNA or antisense RNA-mediated control of gene expression (for review see: [5]), RNA-binding proteins (for review see: [6]), or low-molecular metabolites like in case of ribo-switches [7]. In most cases regulatory RNA units are composed of consecutively neighbouring sequence segments and only in rare cases long-range interactions seem to be involved in the formation of regulatory local structures like in IRES elements (e.g. [8,9]) or certain classes of catalytic RNA (e.g. [10]). Particularly simple regulatory modules of limited length such as the TAR element, the RRE element, or packaging signals of the human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) often adopt structural domains that coincide with local minimal energy states [11,12]. Studies on the biological role of Argonaute (Ago) genes in human cells indicate a potential post-transcriptional control step involved in regulating endogenous levels of the family member Ago2 [13]. Further, preliminary experimental studies in our laboratory indicate specific binding of RNA sequences surrounding the AUG start codon of the Ago2 mRNA with proteins involved in RNA interference (Sczakiel, unpublished data). This attracted us to study the 5\u2032-UTR of mRNAAgo2 with regard to potential RNA cis-elements. Initial computational RNA folding studies indicated the existence of two helices formed by consecutive GC base pairs within the 5\u2032-UTR and upstream coding sequences which seemed to represent a rare case. Here we studied whether the occurrence of GC-rich helices could be biologically relevant. Systematic computational and phylogenetic studies as well as experimental evidence in a mammalian cell system support the view that GC-rich duplex motifs formed by distant RNA segments, unlike typical hairpin elements, could bear biological functions.",

Hence we first defined two prerequisites, a minimal distance of 40 nt between two helix strands and a minimal number of 16 bp within this inter-segment region to differentiate helices from hairpin elements as it requires RNA structure at a position where a loop is found in hairpin elements. First screens indicated that these conditions result in a very small number of predicted long-range duplexes at a duplex length of greater than or equal to 8 bp. It should be noted that the software tool created in this study also accepts any other kind of duplex settings including (i) the base composition, (ii) different characteristics of the inter-segment sequence which may be longer, shorter or adopt other structures, (iii) and the number of consecutive base pairs included in the duplex of interest.

Thereby, we assume, false GC-helix predictions can be minimised which may increase the significance of predicted helices compared to merely location of reverse complementary GC sub-sequences. The software tool described and applied here is written in Python version 2.6.1 and, additionally, integrates the pyExcelerator library (http://pyexcelerator.sourceforge.net). The source code and a sample data set are available for academic users on request. In this study, Mfold version 2.3 was used for mRNA secondary structure prediction, additionally we used Mfold 3.4 (http://mfold.rna.albany.edu) and Sfold 2.2 (http://sfold.wadsworth.org) [14-17]. However, generally most other RNA secondary structure prediction software can be used with our tool as well. Mfold 2.3 was chosen because we found the best match for the structure-function relationship of antisense oligonucleotides (asON) and siRNA, respectively by Mfold version 2.3 versus a number of six alternative folding software tools [18]. When considering that mRNAs (polII transcripts) usually serve as target RNA for asON and siRNA one might conclude that this Mfold version predicts local structures of mRNA in a reliable fashion [19].",

Predicted local structural elements that occur at high frequency in a large number of folded relevant windows, regardless of neighbouring sequences, turn out to have a greater chance of being meaningfully related to the biology of corresponding RNA elements. This approach of analysing RNA secondary computationally turned out to produce clearly more reliable results compared with a single fold of the complete long-chain RNA sequence of interest. Further, in terms of calculation time this concept seems to provide advantages (see paragraph 3.5).",

The generated sequence pool contains mRNA species of interest for which secondary structures are predicted in a systematic fashion that has been described in detail recently [20]. Briefly, a long-chain sequence is sub-divided into overlapping sequence segments (windows) starting at position #1 and sliding along the complete sequence. Secondary structures are predicted and, depending on the step width of the shifting window and its length, a large number of differing structure predictions can be produced. This output of secondary structures is parsed for user-defined duplex motifs and is used for identification of species with specific characteristics such as GC-rich helices formed by distant sequence segments in a non-hairpin like fashion. The user is able to filter hits by setting parameters such as the base composition of the duplex, the range of distance between strands, and the range of duplex length.",

The GC-helix frequency in the shuffled mRNAs was 0.002 and thus lower by a factor of 5 compared to the human mRNA population.

The nucleotide composition of these domains of the human mRNA sequences studied here is summarised in Figure 1C. Systematic computational analyses of the human mRNA sequences and their predicted structures show that GC-helices predominantly occur within the 5\u2032-region of mRNAs (0.084 per 100 nt versus 0.006 in the rCDS and 0.002 in the 3\u2032-UTR, respectively) while AU-helix frequency is much lower and AU-helices predominantly occur within the 3\u2032-UTR (Figure 1D and E). The distribution of predicted duplex elements within mRNAs can be found in Additional file 2 and a detailed listing of all predicted GC-helices in relation to the start codon is provided in Additional file 3. In contrast, the occurrence of duplex elements with mixed base compositions seems to be more balanced between the three regions (1.738, 1.915 and 1.565 per 100 nt for 5\u2032-region, rCDS, and 3\u2032-UTR, respectively; Figure 1F). Replacing the 5\u2032-region by 5\u2032-UTR and hence rCDS by CDS (i.e. the complete coding region) does not alter these figures substantially. Likewise, the distribution of GC-rich helices is similar to that of classical GC-rich stem loops (data not shown). The uneven distribution of GC- and AU-helices between the three defined regions might be related to a certain extent to the base composition of these regions (Figure 1C) but it seems to be unlikely that this fully explains the sharp differences of their local occurrence. To test this, we searched for GC- and AU-duplex motifs in randomly shuffled RNA sequences. Here, GC-duplex frequencies are lower than found in the mRNA population and their location within the three sequence domains is balanced in the pool of shuffled mRNA. The preferred occurrence of GC duplexes in the 5\u2032-region of mRNAs was not be observed in case of shuffled mRNAs (Additional file 1: Table S4). Also AU-duplexes occur in a balanced fashion within the three sequence domains in contrast to the mRNA sequences, where AU-duplexes are preferably located in the 3\u2032-UTR. It should be mentioned that the position of GC-rich helices does not coincide with CpG islands on the level of chromosomal DNA. In the following we focused on double helices predominantly or exclusively composed of GC base pairs.",

Out of 49 orthologous Argonaute sequences, 10 were GC-helix positive. The ten hits share two criteria: they are of vertebrate origin and their gene class is AGO-like Argonautes: Bos taurus Ago1 and Ago2 (two variants), Mus musculus Ago2 (two variants) and Ago4, Rattus norvegicus Ago4, Pan troglodytes two Ago-like (Transcriptome Shotgun Assembly), as well as, Gallus gallus Ago4.

Further, basal expression levels of the 5\u2032-UTRAgo2-luciferase fusion seem to be higher than the levels of controls (Figure 2D, open bars) which is consistent, to a certain extent, with the assumption that endogenous Ago2 increases its expression via the 5\u2032-UTRAgo2.",
