            "text": "COVID 19 is caused by the SARS CoV-2 Virus. Typical presentation includes upper respiratory symptoms including cough, rhinorrhea, dyspnea which can progress to respiratory failure requiring intubation(1). Elevation of CRP, LDH, and lymphopenia are typically observed [1]. However, the SARS COV-2 virus can result in a wide variety of neurological presentations including seizures that have only been recently documented [2]. There are multiple proposed mechanisms of CNS involvement including retrograde movement from the olfactory nerve, entry into CNS via circulating lymphocytes or entry via permeable blood brain barrier [2,3]. In addition to use of anti-epileptics therapy with mannitol has been documented in decreasing cerebral edema [3]. Future therapies including the role of direct antiviral agents lopinavir/ritonavir, immunomodulators tocilizumab in combating the cytokine storm and treating/preventing encephalopathy in COVID-19 patients should be investigated further.",

Initially admitted to the medical floor the patient shortly developed worsening respiratory status with increased work of breathing and altered mental status requiring intubation and transfer to the intensive care unit. Initial ABG showed a pH of 7.13, PaO2 of 68 mmHg and PCO2 of 78 mmHg. BNP was elevated at 541 pg/mL. Troponin was elevated at 0.11 ng/mL and peaked at 0.35 ng/mL. Suspicion for COVID 19 was raised after finding abnormal labs typically seen in COVID 19 patients(1): elevated CRP at 61 mg/L, LDH of 230 U/L, lymphopenia noticed at 0.5 k/cmm with leukopenia at 4000k/cmm. A chest x-ray on admission was negative. Patient was started on oseltamivir however was discontinued when Influenza tested negative Two sets of blood cultures were negative for bacterial growth.",

On day 3 of admission, patient was noted to have multiple episodes of tonic colonic movements of his upper and lower extremities that lasted for many minutes before abating with versed 4 mg IV push. Versed drip was started. A loading dose of levetiracetam was given followed by maintenance dose dosed renally. 24 h EEG showed six left temporal seizures and left temporal sharp waves which were epileptogenic. For the next 2 days patient was observed having tonic movements of his upper extremities 2-3 times daily. Valproate was added to the antiseizure regimen.

Blood glucose levels recorded before and after the seizure episodes did not show hypoglycemia. Additionally, the patient was off his home oral sulfonylureas for multiple days and underwent dialysis sessions making it less likely that the continued effects of oral hypoglycemic agents was the cause of his seizures. The patient was persistently febrile throughout admission possibly related to the cytokine storm so frequently seen in COVID 19. Lumbar puncture would have been a useful diagnostic tool, unfortunately however the patient died before lumbar puncture could be arranged. Additionally the amount of viral particles in CSF may be insufficient for detection [3]\u00b7 Herpes encephalitis appeared less likely as there were no findings on CT head suggestive of such. The findings of lateral ventriculitis in the hippocampus documented by Takseshi and Colleagues (2020) was not seen in this patient [2]. MRI brain was not completed due the patient being too unstable for transport.",
