            "text": "Quantifying the types of childcare arrangements and the number of children participating in each is challenging because of different ascertainment methods used in several data sources. The U.S. Census Bureau conducts the Survey of Income and Program participation (SIPP), which collects information about childcare arrangements for children <15 years of age. A primary care arrangement is defined as the arrangement used the most hours per week. In 2006, 47% of children <15 years of age were cared for by a relative; 24% attended an organized care facility including group childcare, nursery or preschool or Head Start; 16% were in non-relative provided care, the majority of which was outside the child's primary residence; 11% were in an unspecified arrangement; and 2% were not enrolled in a regular arrangement14 (www.census.gov/population/www/socdemo/2006_detailedtables.html). Types of facilities can be classified by size of enrollment, age of enrollees, and environmental characteristics of the facility. Grouping of children by age varies by setting but in organized care facilities children usually are separated into: infants (6 weeks through 12 months), toddlers (13 through 35 months), preschool (36 months through 59 months), and school-aged children (5 through 12 years), which has relevance to infectious disease epidemiology with regard to regulation and monitoring. Most non-relative care provided in an organized care facility is subject to state licensing and regulation, whereas care by a relative in a child's or provider's home may not be subject to state regulations and monitoring.",

Outbreaks in childcare centers generally are not recognized until illness becomes apparent in older children or adults.55 Prior to routine use of hepatitis A vaccine in children in the U.S., approximately 15% of episodes of HAV infection were estimated to be associated with childcare centers. HAV infections are transmitted in the childcare setting by the fecal-oral route and occur more frequently in settings that include diapered children. Large size and long hours of operation also are risk factors for outbreaks of HAV infection.56\n",

Universal administration of hepatitis A vaccine to toddlers in Israel in 1999 resulted in a notable absence of outbreaks of HAV in childcare and elementary school settings from 2000 through 2006.57 Universal administration of 2 doses of hepatitis A vaccine to all children, beginning at 1 year (12 through 23 months) of age, with the 2 doses administered at least 6 months apart is recommended in the U.S.58 Administration of hepatitis A vaccine or immune globulin to unimmunized, immunocompetent people 12 months through 40 years of age for postexposure prophylaxis also is recommended.59, 60 A case-control study to evaluate the effectiveness of an HAV vaccination program targeted at childcare attendees between 2 and 5 years of age found that people with direct contact with a childcare center were protected against disease. Furthermore, the 6-fold greater risk of HAV infection that occurred in people who had contact with a childcare center prior to implementation of the hepatitis A immunization program in Maricopa County, Arizona was not found in the post-vaccination case-control study.61 Enhanced population-based surveillance conducted by health departments among six U.S. sites from 2005 to 2007 was notable for 1156 cases among 29.8 million people. Being an employee or child in a childcare center accounted for 8% of cases, while international travel and contact with a case were more frequent risk factors associated with 46% and 15% of hepatitis A cases. Despite the decline in the incidence of HAV, continued education, training, and monitoring of staff regarding appropriate hygienic practices are essential components of any preventive plan.",

In an outbreak during which more than 571 school and childcare personnel were tested serologically, the overall attack rate among susceptible individuals was 19%, with the highest rate (31%) occurring in childcare personnel.179 A cross-sectional study of 477 childcare staff revealed a seroprevalence for parvovirus B19 IgG antibodies of 70%. Seropositivity was associated with age, and among staff less than 40 years of age, with length of group childcare contact.181 The greatest concern is that an infected pregnant woman could transmit the virus transplacentally, leading to fetal hydrops; neonatal illness and congenital malformations have not been linked to prenatal parvovirus B19 infection. Estimates of the risk of fetal loss when a pregnant woman of unknown antibody status is exposed are 3% for fetal death after household exposure and 2% after occupational exposure in a school.182\n",

The most common and efficient routes of transmission are percutaneous blood exposure, sexual exposure, and, perinatally, from mothers to offspring at the time of delivery. Other recognized but less efficient modes of transmission include bites and mucous membrane exposure to blood or other body fluids.155, 156 Two case reports and a larger study have demonstrated possible transmission of HBV among children in the childcare setting.156, 157, 158 Investigators in Denmark and the Netherlands demonstrated high levels of HBV DNA in saliva of 46 HBeAg-positive children, suggesting that exposure to saliva could be a means of horizontal transmission of hepatitis B infection.159 Other investigators have failed to demonstrate transmission in childcare, despite long-term exposure to children positive for hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg).160 Because of the small number of studies, the risk of HBV transmission in childcare cannot be quantified precisely. With implementation of universal immunization of infants with HBV vaccine beginning in 1991, the potential for horizontal HBV transmission in the childcare setting has been reduced to negligible. If a known HBsAg carrier bites and breaks the skin of an unimmunized child, hepatitis B immune globulin and the HBV vaccine series should be administered.152 The transmission risk of HCV infection in childcare settings is unknown. The general risk of HCV infection from percutaneous exposure to infected blood is estimated to be 10 times greater than HIV but less than HBV.",

Universal immunization with varicella vaccine has reduced cases of chickenpox among children in group childcare.58, 167 However, several outbreaks of varicella have been reported among childcare attendees in the post-licensure era.89, 168, 169 A varicella outbreak occurring among elementary school attendees in Maine in December to January 2003 was due to failure to vaccinate. The vaccination rates were notable for a decrease from 90% of kindergarten attendees to 60% of third-grade enrollees. Vaccine effectiveness in this cohort of 296 students was 89% against all varicella disease and 96% against moderate to severe disease. This outbreak illustrates the importance of vaccination of susceptible older children and adolescents to decrease the incidence of severe disease in unvaccinated children.167 In June 2005 and June 2006, ACIP recommended the implementation of a routine 2-dose varicella vaccination program for children, with the first dose administered at 12 through 15 months and the second dose at 4 through 6 years of age.167 An outbreak among elementary school student recipients of 1-dose and 2-dose varicella immunizations with a pre-outbreak coverage rate of 97% resulted in 84 reported infections (most cases with <50 lesions). Of these, 25 (30%) of children had received 2 doses and 53 (63%) had received one dose of varicella vaccine. The severity of disease and vaccine effectiveness of 1 and 2 doses were comparable.170 An outbreak in an elementary school in Philadelphia in 2006 demonstrated that second-dose varicella vaccination for outbreak control was an effective intervention to reduce varicella incidence among classroom contacts of a case.171, 172, 173 This strategy may be employed as a control measure among age-eligible childcare attendees who have not received the 2-dose varicella series in an outbreak setting.",

A molecular epidemiologic study of MRSA prevalence among 104 children, 32 employees, and 17 household contacts of attendees affiliated with a university medical center childcare facility in Texas noted an overall 7% colonization rate with MRSA. MRSA was isolated from one employee (3%), 6 (35%) family members and 4 (2%) environmental samples. Molecular typing revealed closely related, mostly community-associated isolates.

Animal interaction can occur in locations where childcare is provided, with a resident pet or visiting animal display, or in public venues where children visit, including petting zoos, aquariums, county fairs, parks, carnivals, circuses, or farms. Guidelines to reduce opportunities for transmission and infection have been developed to prevent disease transmission in many of these settings.185, 186 Inadequate hand hygiene, suboptimal supervision of children's activities following animal contact, and hand-to-mouth activities following animal contact are risk factors for infection. Infections that have been associated with close contact with animals include those caused by Escherichia coli O157:H7, Salmonella enterica serotype Typhimurium, Cryptosporidium parvum, Campylobacter jejuni, Shiga toxin-producing E. coli (STEC), and Giardia intestinalis.\n187, 188, 189, 190 In addition to enteric infections, animal exposure can result in transmission of ecto- and endoparasites, Mycobacterium tuberculosis in certain settings, and local or systemic infections as a consequence of bites, scratches, stings, and other injuries.",

Similar prevalence rates of pneumococcal colonization (5% among adult employees of childcare centers with child contact and 5% among nonclinical employees at a tertiary care center) were noted in a study performed in 2003 in Galveston, Texas; these data suggest that childcare providers are not at an increased risk for pneumococcal colonization in the universal pneumococcal conjugate vaccine era.204 Compared with nonproviders childcare providers have a significantly higher annual risk of at least one infectious disease and loss of work days due to infectious diseases.205 Childcare providers should receive all immunizations routinely recommended for adults, as shown on the adult immunization schedule (see Table 3-3) (www.cdc.gov/vaccines).",

A prospective evaluation of 208 families with at least one childcare enrollee, conducted from November 2000 to May 2001 in the Boston area, documented 2072 viral illnesses over 105,352 person-days. Among the 834 subjects, 1683 URTIs and 389 gastrointestinal tract (GI) illnesses were reported during the study period, with a total mean cost of $49 per URTI and $56 per GI episode. Decreased parental productivity during missed days of work to care for a child who had to be withdrawn from childcare accounted for a significant proportion of the nonmedical cost.206\n",

In addition to traditional handwashing, the use of alcohol-based hand-sanitizing products in healthcare and other settings is an efficacious means of achieving hand hygiene.212 Ethanol hand sanitizers are more effective than handwashing with soap and water in removing detectable rhinovirus from hands of adult volunteers. An additional evaluation of the effectiveness of adding organic acids to hand sanitizers was notable for residual rhinovirus virucidal activity of up to 4 hours.213 In support of this preventive strategy, a cluster-randomized, controlled trial was conducted in the homes of 292 families with children who were enrolled in out-of-home childcare centers. A multifactorial intervention emphasizing alcohol-based hand sanitizer use in the home reduced transmission of GI illnesses within families. The effect on reduction of respiratory tract illness transmission in this evaluation was less pronounced and may relate to use of hand-sanitizing gel following toilet use but not following sneezing, coughing, or blowing/wiping of nasal secretions.214 A follow-up study that added surface disinfection to a hand sanitizer intervention in a school-based cluster-randomized controlled trial demonstrated a greater decrease in adjusted absenteeism rates due to GI compared with respiratory tract illness. Norovirus was the only virus isolated more frequently from classroom surfaces in the control group.215 A comparative evaluation of antibacterial liquid soap and alcohol-based hand sanitizer for inactivation of norovirus on human finger pads demonstrated a greater virucidal effectiveness with the antibacterial soap compared to the ethanol-based hand sanitizer. Despite utility of alcohol-based sanitizers for control of enteric and respiratory tract pathogen transmission, they may be relatively ineffective against norovirus.216 Molecular techniques, including DNA probes, could be used as surrogate markers to study transmission of enteric pathogens in childcare centers and from centers to children's homes.217 Further evaluations of molecular techniques during outbreak investigations, hand hygiene strategies, and educational interventions could assist with allocation of resources to the most effective prevention regimens.",
