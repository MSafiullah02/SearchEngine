            "text": "\nMany intra-abdominal and extra-abdominal diseases are responsible for abdominal pain.Nature of abdominal pain can be divided into three categories based on neurological pathways:Somatic (parietal) pain:It results from irritation of parietal peritoneum caused by inflammation, infection or chemical reaction. It is supplied by myelinated nerve fibres. It is localised and constant. As the disease process evolves and irritates parietal peritoneum, we can elicit tenderness, guarding and rigidity. The patient prefers to lie immobile.Visceral pain:It is caused by stretching of walls of hollow viscera, innervated by unmyelinated fibres. It is diffuse and intermittent, dull aching and colicky in nature. Patients keep tossing on the bed. It is felt in the abdominal region which correlates to the somatic segment of embryonic region. Foregut, midgut and hindgut structures (Table 26.1) relate to upper, middle and lower abdomen, respectively. Visceral pain can be perceived away from actual disease process, i.e. pain of acute appendicitis is felt around umbilicus initially as it corresponds to T10 somatic distribution.\nReferred pain:It is defined as a pain that is felt away from the site of origin. Common anatomical origin or same nerve root innervations are primary reasons for such pain (Fig. 26.1).\n\n\n",

            "text": "\nHistory:Age and gender are important history points. Elderly patients with nonspecific complaints may have serious pathology. In females, obstetrics and gynaecological causes should be considered.Pain can be described as (SCRIPT FADO):\nSite\nCharacter\nRadiation\nIntensity\nPrecipitating/relieving factors\nTime duration\nFrequency\nAssociated features\nDiurnal variation\nOnset\n\nGastrointestinal complaints (anorexia, nausea, vomiting, altered bowel habits, haematemesis, haematochezia, abdominal distension, back pain), genitourinary problems (urinary complains, foul discharge), thoracic complaints (chest pain, breathlessness, palpitation) and constitutional symptoms (fever, weight loss)\nPast history: Regarding previous similar episodes, admissions, investigations and treatment\nPre-existing medical illness: Diabetes, hypertension, heart diseases, liver/renal diseases, HIV, STD and tuberculosis\nMedication history: Antibiotics, antiplatelets/anticoagulants, steroids, beta-blockers/calcium channel blockers, NSAIDs, chemotherapeutic agents, etc.\nSurgical history: Laparotomy, caesarean sections, etc.\nObstetric history: Last menstrual period, previous pregnancies/deliveries, abortions, ectopic, IVF, IUCDs and other contraceptive measuresAllergies, social history (alcohol/drug addiction), history of last meal and history of trauma\n\nPhysical examination:Despite the development of newer imaging modalities, i.e. ultrasound, CT scan and MRI, physical examination holds a key role in patient evaluation. Some specific signs are summarised in Table 26.2.\n\nGeneral examination and vital signs: Appearance, temperature, pulse, blood pressure, respiratory rate, oxygen saturation, GCS, blood glucose measurement and pain score.\nInspection: With consent, inspect abdominal skin for scars (adhesions), dilated tortuous vein (spider angiomata, caput medusa), skin eruptions (herpes zoster), haemorrhage or signs of trauma (ecchymosis), foreign body and entry/exit wounds. Distension of abdomen (ascites, intestinal obstruction, ileus) and obvious masses (tumour, hernia, pregnancy, distended bladder, aneurysm) should be examined. Hernia orifices and external genitalia should not be forgotten.\nPalpation: Focus on locating the site of tenderness, signs of peritonism and palpation of masses. Abdomen is divided into right upper, right lower, left upper and left lower quadrants. Localisation of tenderness guides physician to generate differential diagnosis pertaining to that area. However, one can have diffuse abdominal pain spreading to more than one quadrant, i.e. pain of renal calculus extends from lumbar region to the iliac fossa and groin.Patients with peritoneal irritation show tenderness, guarding/rigidity and pain with coughing. Guarding could be voluntary or involuntary. Due to lax abdominal wall musculature, guarding and rigidity may be absent in the elderly. Typical rebound tenderness is no longer considered an important examination tool due to painful procedure [1].Abdominal aorta, liver and spleen sizes can be evaluated by palpation. Elderly patients with history of recent abdominal/flank/low back pain, known hypertension, pulsatile abdominal mass and feeble/absent distal pulses are suggestive of abdominal aortic aneurysm/dissection. Bedside ultrasound facilitates visualisation of increased abdominal aortic diameter and determines further surgical/medical management.\nPercussion: Helpful to assess free air intraperitoneum, degree of ascites, gas-filled bowel loops and peritonitis. It is not very useful in noisy ED.\nAuscultation: It gives information regarding bowel and vascular status. Absent or diminished bowel sound indicates ileus, mesenteric ischaemia, narcotic use or peritonitis. Hyperactive bowel sounds suggest small bowel obstruction, enteritis or early ischaemic intestine. High pitched tinkling sound reflects mechanical obstruction.\nDigital rectal examination: Useful for detection of perianal and rectal pathologies (haemorrhoids, fissure and fistula), intraluminal intestinal haemorrhage (dark maroon/red stool), proctitis and constipation (faecal impaction and intestinal obstruction). It is no more useful in diagnosing acute appendicitis [2].Emergency physicians should be vigilant and think of serious pathology in presence of any of the following clinical features:Abdominal pain prior to vomitingHaematemesis/haematocheziaConfusionToxic appearanceSigns of shock/dehydrationLocalised/generalised tendernessGuarding/rigidityAbsent bowel sound\n\n\n",
