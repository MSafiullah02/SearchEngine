Nucleoside HCV polymerase inhibitors act as premature chain terminators following conversion to their 5\u2032-triphosphate metabolite and incorporation in the viral genome. 2\u2032-C-Methylcytidine (2\u2032-C-MeCyt) [11] was the first nucleoside HCV inhibitor to enter clinical studies. Development of this compound has been discontinued in the light of modest antiviral efficacy along with significant gastrointestinal side effects [12]. The efficacy of R1626, a prodrug of 4\u2032-azidocytidine, is currently being evaluated in combination with standard therapy [13]. \u03b2-d-2\u2032-Deoxy-2\u2032-fluoro-2\u2032-C-methylcytidine (prodrug R7128) has demonstrated promising efficacy in phase I studies in chronically infected patients [14]. Various non-nucleoside inhibitor classes of the HCV RdRp, including benzimidazoles [15], [16], [17], indoles [18], [19], [20], [21], thiophene-based carboxylic acids [22], [23], phenylalanines [24], [25], dihydropyranones [26], [27], pyranoindoles [28], [29], [30], proline sulfonamides [31], benzothiadiazines [32], [33], [34], [35], [36], benzylidene derivatives [37] and acrylic acids [38], [39] have been reported, but optimization was not further pursued or clinical development has been stopped because of serious adverse effects. Efficacy of the benzofuran non-nucleoside RdRp inhibitor (HCV-796) was demonstrated in infected patients [40], [41] but clinical development was stopped because of potential hepatotoxicity. VCH-759, a new non-nucleoside thiophene-2-carboxylic acid inhibitor of RdRp causes a 2.5 log10 decrease in HCV RNA after 10 days of treatment in HCV-infected patients and was generally well-tolerated in early clinical studies [42].",

            "text": "We recently reported the identification of a novel class of 2,5-disubstituted imidazo[4,5-c]pyridines as potent inhibitors of in vitro pestivirus replication [67]. Introduction of a fluorine at position 2 of the phenyl of the lead anti-pestivirus compound 5-[4-bromophenyl)methyl]-2-phenyl-5H-imidazo[4,5-c]pyridine (BPIP) resulted in a molecule that not only exhibited anti-BVDV but also anti-HCV activity (compound 1; EC50 HCV = 3.0 \u03bcM; CC50\n = 136 \u03bcM) (Fig. 1\n) [43]. Introduction of two fluorines on the 2-phenyl ring (2,3-difluoro analogue; compound 2) resulted in a molecule that proved 5-fold more potent against HCV than compound 1 and that retained the anti-BVDV activity. In an attempt to further optimize the anti-HCV activity of this class of compounds, a set of analogues with modifications to the 4-bromo substituent on the 5-benzyl residue (for example the introduction of a trifluoromethyl; compounds 3 and 4) was synthesized [44], resulting in compounds with a 15- to 30-fold increased anti-HCV activity as compared to compound 1. Interestingly, whereas these modifications resulted in an increased anti-HCV activity, there was relatively little effect on BVDV activity. Subsequently, a set of analogues with more extensive modifications at the 5-benzyl position was synthesized (data not shown). This resulted in the identification of a series of analogues with highly potent low nM range anti-HCV activity. One of these, i.e. GS-327073 or 5-[[3-(4-chlorophenyl)-5-isoxazolyl]methyl]-2-(2,3-difluorophenyl)-5H-imidazo[4,5-c]pyridine, was selected for further characterization of the in vitro anti-HCV activity. The compound inhibited HCV (genotype 1) subgenomic replicon replication with mean EC50 values ranging between 2 and 50 nM in a dose-dependent manner (Table 1\n, Fig. 2\n). GS-327073 proved markedly more potent than the protease inhibitors BILN-2061, VX-950 and SCH 503034, the nucleoside polymerase inhibitors 2\u2032-C-MeCyt and 4\u2032-azidocytidine and the non-nucleoside polymerase inhibitor GSK-4. GS-327073 inhibited the replication of cell culture\u2013grown chimeric HCV (HCVcc, genotype 2a) designated J6/JFH-Rluc-FLAG in a dose-dependent manner, although less efficiently than the replication of genotype 1b replicon. The antiviral activity of GS-327073 against the J6/JFH-Rluc-FLAG virus was however comparable to the activity of the reference protease or polymerase inhibitors studied.",

GS-327073 or VX-950, when used at concentrations of five times their EC50, resulted in a rapid and profound drop in replicon level but did not achieve complete clearance of Huh 9-13 cells from their replicon following 3 passages in the presence of either drug (Fig. 4\nC). In contrast, the combination GS-327073 (5 \u00d7 EC50) and VX-950 (5 \u00d7 EC50) resulted in clearance of Huh 9-13 cells from their replicon following one passage, (Fig. 4A).

            "text": "A series of broader modifications to the 5-benzyl group of the substituted 5-benzyl-2-phenyl-5H-imidazo[4,5-c]pyridines was performed. This resulted in a series of molecules with highly potent anti-HCV activity. Within this series, GS-327073 [5-[[3-(4-chlorophenyl)-5-isoxazolyl]methyl]-2-(2,3-difluorophenyl)-5H-imidazo[4,5-c]pyridine], was selected for further characterization. GS-327073 proved particularly effective against genotype 1b replicons (the system used to optimize for antiviral potency) with EC50 values in the low nanomolar range. GS-327073 also inhibited the replication of a genotype 2a cell culture infectious HCVcc (J6/JFH-Rluc-FLAG), but did so less efficiently than for the genotype 1b replicon. The anti-HCV activity of GS-327073 was compared to that of other HCV inhibitors, including ribavirin, the NS3 protease inhibitors BILN-2061, VX-950 and SCH 503034, the nucleoside NS5B polymerase inhibitors 2\u2032-C-MeCyt and 4\u2032-azidocytidine and the non-nucleoside NS5B polymerase benzothiadiazine inhibitor GSK-4. The anti-HCV activity of GS-327073 was superior to that of any of these compounds. GS-327073 retained wild-type antiviral activity against a panel of replicons resistant to various HCV inhibitors, including protease, nucleoside and non-nucleoside polymerase inhibitors. Remarkably, GS-327073 retained a significant antiviral activity against the pestivirus BVDV. GS-327073 proved also cross-resistant in anti-BVDV assay with BPIP, one of the parent compounds in this class of compounds with potent anti-pestivirus activity but no anti-HCV activity. BPIP was shown to target the fingertip of the pestivirus RNA dependent RNA polymerase [45]. It is remarkable that a given non-nucleoside analogue (such as GS-327073) is able to inhibit both pestiviruses and HCV. Representatives of the imidazopyridines are, to the best of our knowledge, the first class of non-nucleoside molecules that are able to inhibit the replication of both pesti- and hepaciviruses, albeit potentially different mechanisms of action may be involved. Detailed studies on the molecular mechanism of action of the imidazopyridines will be reported elsewhere. Replicons resistant to GS-327073 were generated following several months of selective in vitro pressure (data not shown). In comparison to several other STAT-C inhibitors, the genetic barrier to achieve high levels of resistance of GS-327073 is relatively high. This might be explained by the fact that three mutations are required in the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase gene to achieve 50-fold or more resistance.",

            "text": "It is likely that specifically targeted antiviral therapy compounds (STAT-C), in the initial years after they become available for the treatment of HCV infected patients, will be combined with the current standard therapy [68]. At a later stage, two or more potent STAT-C inhibitors with different resistance profiles, may hopefully be combined without further need for interferon and/or ribavirin. It is hence important to obtain information about the antiviral efficacy of particular combinations. For this reason we studied the antiviral activity of GS-327073 when combined with other classes of HCV inhibitors. To this end, two different assay systems were employed. In a first assay, the combined antiviral activity was evaluated in regular antiviral assays, i.e. with a read-out after 3 days of incubation of the replicon containing cells with the antiviral drug(s). All combinations studied resulted in an overall additive antiviral activity, which was in line with our expectation that compounds that do (likely) not interfere with each others\u2019 metabolism or mechanism of action should result in an additive antiviral effect. Combinations of compounds that interfere with each others\u2019 biological activity may either result in a synergistic or antagonistic antiviral activity. For example, the IMP-dehydrogenase inhibitor ribavirin is able to potentiate the antiherpes and anti-HBV activity of purine based deoxynucleoside analogues on one hand, but results in an antagonistic effect on HIV and HCV replication when combined with pyrimidine ribonucleoside analogues [69], [70], [71], [72], [73]. Particular interference of ribavirin with the purine and pyrimidine metabolism is an explanation for these observations. No such antagonistic or synergistic activities were noted when GS-327073 was combined with other selective inhibitors of HCV replication. However, a short antiviral assay may not necessarily predict the antiviral effect of either single compounds or combinations thereof. We, therefore, studied the anti-HCV activity of GS-327073 alone or in combination with either interferon \u03b1, a protease or a polymerase HCV inhibitor in \u201cclearance rebound\u201d assays. Replicon containing cells were cultured for one or more passages in the presence of the antiviral drug(s) and in the absence of the selection marker geneticin. Neither drug, at concentrations that were 5- to 20-fold higher than their EC50 values, was able to achieve clearance (except for 3 passages in the presence of 100 IU of interferon \u03b1). Surprisingly, and despite the fact that no synergistic activity was noted in a regular 3 day antiviral assay, all GS-327073 containing combinations (5\u00d7, 10\u00d7 and 20 \u00d7 EC50) efficiently cleared cells from their replicon. Clearance-rebound experiments may possibly have predictive value for estimating the potential of drugs (or combinations thereof) to clear liver cells from replicating virus. Combinations of imidazopyridines with various STAT-C inhibitors (or interferon) may have the potential to achieve rapid viral clearance. Our data also indicate that regular short term antiviral combination assays (in replicon based systems) may not necessarily predict synergistic antiviral effects following long-term culture.",
