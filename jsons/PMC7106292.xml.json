            "text": "The number of emergent or re-emergent infectious viral diseases that are linked to cross-species transmission from reservoirs to naive hosts is increasing in both animals and humans (Woolhouse, 2008). Notable examples include emergence of avian and swine influenza viruses, henipaviruses, and the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus. The mechanisms in viral emergence are complex and include ecological, immunological, and genetic features of both virus and host (Lloyd-Smith et al., 2009, Parrish et al., 2008). Although the dispersal of viruses in humans following zoonotic transmission can be documented by integrating epidemiological data with virus sequence data, the events that precede productive viral infection in a new host are more difficult to untangle (Lloyd-Smith et al., 2009). Similarly, cross-species transmissions among animal species leading to successful strain emergence are poorly understood. With the increased availability of genetic data and associated temporal and geographic information from improved surveillance effort, it is now possible to obtain insights of inter-species transmission dynamics that give rise to new viral strains, which pose health risks in animals.",

            "text": "Avian paramyxovirus serotype 1 (PMV1) is a negative-sense single stranded RNA virus in the family Paramyxoviridae. It is best known for causing outbreaks of Newcastle disease (ND), a source of significant economic loss to the poultry industry worldwide. In the 1950s, 30 years after the first reported PMV1 outbreak, modified live vaccines derived from the dominant circulating strain were deployed to prevent and control the disease (Alexander, 1988a). Subsequently, a series of new strains have emerged from unknown sources that contribute to the ND global burden. There are now at least ten reported genotypes of PMV1 contributing to the extensive genetic diversity in avian populations worldwide (Aldous et al., 2004, Barbezange and Jestin, 2003, Barbezange and Jestin, 2005, Diel et al., 2012, Kim et al., 2008, Kommers et al., 2001, Liu et al., 2006, Mase et al., 2009, Meulemans et al., 2002, Panshin et al., 1999, Servan de Almeida et al., 2009, Sleeman, 2010, Tsai et al., 2004, Ujvari et al., 2003, Zhu et al., 2010, http://www.worldpoulty.net/). Understanding the mechanism of successful strain emergence in PMV1 can inform efforts to control ND and other viral diseases with similar evolutionary dynamics that threaten domestic and wild birds.",

The new virus, called pigeon-associated PMV1 (PPMV1), was initially presumed to be of chicken origin and to infect pigeons only as a result of sporadic spill over events. However, in 1984, multiple ND outbreaks in Great Britain were initiated by PPMV1 and spread from pigeons to chickens (Alexander et al., 1985b). Subsequently, PPMV1 has been responsible for other chicken ND outbreaks worldwide (Aldous et al., 2004, Capua et al., 2002, Kommers et al., 2001, Liu et al., 2006, OIE, 2011a, OIE, 2011b, Toro et al., 2005, Werner et al., 1999) and has caused extensive panzootic infections in racing pigeons in European countries despite vaccination efforts (Alexander et al., 1997, Kommers et al., 2001, Meulemans et al., 2002, Werner et al., 1999, Zanetti et al., 2001). Genetic analysis of PPMV1 demonstrated that this strain, named genotype VI-PMV1 (GVI-PMV1) (Aldous et al., 2004), constituted a distinct monophyletic lineage with considerable genetic heterogeneity.",

To better understand the viral spread in North America, we sequenced the F genes of 74 PMV1 isolates collected in northeastern United States (US) from 2001 to 2009.

Briefly, O was divided by E, which was generated by randomly shuffling the taxa locality in a pair-wise manner, to accommodate unequal sampling frequencies in different geographic states. In our case, only viruses isolated within one-year prior or after their isolation were shuffled to generate E values, to avoid generating excessive E that is unlikely to occur in panmixis due to the time\u2013space difference between samples. To investigate the effect by excessive numbers of European sequences in our data set, random sub-samplings (n = 10) of European sequences were performed to create smaller data sets in which the number of European sequences at most equals the largest number of samples from other localities in each year. The analysis of gene flow frequency was applied similarly in these randomly sub-sampled data sets. Furthermore, a Bayes factor test was performed to identify statistically supported gene flows from a Bayesian stochastic search variable selection (BSSVS) procedure in the BMCMC phylogeographic analysis (Lemey et al., 2009).",

The GVIa sub-lineage is comprised of a GVIai subgroup, which appeared around 1965 (HPD = 1960\u20131968; Node 2 in Fig 1B) in Eastern Asia, with local spread evidenced by a cluster of isolates from Korea (Green block; PP = 1.00). A European subgroup diverged from the Eastern Asian clusters around 1971 (HPD = 1968\u20131973; Node 21 in Fig. 1B; Table S4), and caused sporadic ND in chickens in Western Europe and Bulgaria in the mid-1990s [designated as \u2018GVIc\u2019 by Czegledi et al., 2002, Ujvari et al., 2003]. A number of sparsely distributed non-chicken isolates (color coded branches indicating different bird orders in Fig. 1B) is observed in the GVIai subgroup, suggestive of sporadic but unsustained cross-species transmissions from chickens.

We applied the parsimony rule to determine the scenario with the least number of possible viral cross-species transmission steps to account for the successful viral introductions from Galliformes (i.e. chicken) to Columbiformes. Two equally plausible scenarios (red dashed box in Fig. 1B and in Fig. 1D) exist. In one scenario (Fig. 1B), the first successful transmission from Galliformes to Columbiformes is estimated to have occurred around 1967 (HPD = 1962\u20131970, at the branch from node 4 to node 5). This scenario presupposes backward transmission events from Columbiformes to Galliformes, the first around 1971\u20131973 (see node 20 in Fig. 1B; Table S4) is characterized by two isolates from Bulgaria in 1974\u20131982 and the second in Sudan, Kenya and Tanzania in 1969\u20131971 (between nodes 6 and 23 in Fig. 1B; Table S4); these strains persisted until the 1990s. An equally parsimonious scenario (Fig. 1D) suggests that the major event of Galliformes-to-Columbiformes transmission that gave rise to the current GVIb sublineage occurred around 1970 (HPD = 1965\u20131974; between node 6 and 7) and requires two additional transmissions from Galliformes to Columbiformes in Turkey in 1995 and in a geographically confined lineage of viruses found in Central/Eastern Europe from 1995\u20132010 (node 20 in Fig. 1D; Table S4). The result of the Bayesian discrete trait analysis supports this second parsimony scenario \u2013 i.e. the major cross-species event occurred between node 6 and 7 (Table 1).",

Based on BMCMC estimation of geographic regions as discrete states, the posterior probabilities that Middle East, Europe, or South Africa were estimated in node 4 are 0.002, 0.993 and <0.001, respectively; 0.003, 0.997, and <0.001, respectively for node 5; <0.001, 0.963, and 0.017, respectively for node 6; and 0.02, 0.979, and 0.001, respectively for node 7. To increase the precision of geographical information used for analyses, we employed a recently developed Bayesian continuous diffusion model (Lemey et al., 2010) where the latitudes and longitudes of sequence isolations were used as inputs to estimate the location coordinates of ancestral nodes, by assuming variable spatial diffusion rates among branches. The relaxed random walk (RRW) model with gamma distributed rate variation was the best-fit model according to Bayes Factor tests (lnBF > 3), in which nodes 4\u20137 were estimated to Southeastern Europe (Table S5) with posterior probabilities of 0.994, 1, 0.99, and 0.864, respectively. This result is consistent with the detection of the earliest pigeon isolate of GVI-PMV1 in Iraq. Notably, the latitude and longitude estimates for these nodes were patchy at the country level. Therefore, the estimates were grouped into larger geographic regions (e.g. Southeastern Europe), to avoid potentially biased conclusions.",

The Bayesian phylogeographic analysis result also identifies gene flows from Europe as topologically significant by Bayes factor tests (lnBF > 3; Table S3). There was a weak signature of isolation-by-distance. For example, gene flow between North America and Europe and Asia was higher than gene flow between North America and Middle East and South Africa (Table S3). Furthermore, GVI-PMV1 gene flow between North America and other regions was less frequent than that among countries in the Eurasian-African continent (on average 0.039; Fig. 2; Table S3).

The population size remained constant or grew slowly for the following 15 years, with a number of small fluctuations. From the 1990s onwards, the global GVI-PMV1 population size has a declining trend.

Once GVIb became established in Columbiformes, spillovers of GVIb-PMV1 to non-Columbiformes bird species were detected along terminal branches; these included multiple transmissions to Galliformes and Psittaciformes and infrequent spillovers to Anseriformes and Passeriformes. This latter spill over is consistent with the presumed route by which pathogenic viruses including H5N1 influenza and other PMV1 genotypes that circulate in wild birds have been introduced to domestic chickens (Kim et al., 2009, Miller et al., 2010). However, our data demonstrate that viral strains circulating in wild birds can be derived from domestic poultry, evolve in the new host, and be reintroduced to poultry, providing an additional model to explain epizootic viral emergence in commercial flocks. These data suggest that detection of endemic poultry virus strains in wild and peri-domestic species could presage a virus emergence event.",

With range expansion, we would expect to observe similarly high associations of contemporary GVIb isolates with both pigeons and chickens. However, both epidemiological reports (Abolnik et al., 2008, Hassan et al., 2010, Pedersen et al., 2004) and our phylogenetic data support that such adaptation is unidirectional host switch and not a range expansion. The observed back transmission from pigeons to chicken may reflect the tight ecological interface between their populations, and possibly a relative lower species barrier. Experimental studies confirm that pigeon derived GVIb strains do not readily infect chickens but, significantly, their ability to infect and cause disease in chickens requires only a few serial passages in chickens (Alexander and Parsons, 1984, Collins et al., 1996, Kommers et al., 2003). Reverse genetics studies and complete sequence analysis further confirmed that three substitutions in the P and L proteins are sufficient to increase replication efficiency in chickens (Dortmans et al., 2011). Notably, the number of reports of GVIb-PMV1 in poultry farms is increasing recently (Abolnik et al., 2008, Hassan et al., 2010, Pedersen et al., 2004). Therefore, it is important to determine whether the natural evolutionary trajectory of GVIb isolates in different regions will result in increased risk of backward transmission into chicken populations.",

International and local transportation of birds may have played an important role in spreading the new virus (Alexander et al., 1985a, Kaleta et al., 1985, Stewart, 1971). Rapid early dispersal could account for the lineage radiation that took place within the first decade after emergence. The two founding Columbiformes lineages, GVIbi and GVIbii, that branched in the early 1980s, have diversified into several sub-lineages, some of which are still circulating. GVIbii viruses expanded into 28 countries involving Africa, Asia, Europe North America and Oceania continents, whereas GVIbi viruses have been recorded in 20 countries of the same continents except Oceania. The extensive diversity that has occurred in GVIb has confounded nomenclature, and we reconcile our data with that found in the literature (Fig. 1) (Aldous et al., 2004, Czegledi et al., 2002, Kwon et al., 2003, Ujvari et al., 2003).",

The first introduction event of GVIbi-a either failed to sustain in North America, or that the strain was missed by sampling efforts. The identification of GVIbii-d and g clades indicates that there were at least two additional introduction events. Given the extensive dispersal of PMV1 from Europe to other countries, GVIb could have been brought into North America through legal or illegal transport of infected birds. It is noteworthy that GVIbii-g strains have been isolated from the Eurasian collared dove. This invasive species was first identified in Florida in the mid-1980s, likely from escaped captive birds brought into the Bahamas for the pet bird trade in the 1970s (Smith, 1987). Our phylogenetic data and molecular dating analyses estimate that the North American GVI-PMV1bii-g was introduced in the mid-1990. We cannot confirm whether the Eurasian collared dove was the source of the introduced North American GVIbii-g lineage because there are no samples from the late 1980s from this species. However, the close affiliation of GVIbii-g strains isolated from domestic pigeons, Eurasian collared doves, and mourning doves indicates that collared doves are competent hosts and that their rapid range expansion, which now extends to southern Alaska, could facilitate dispersal of the virus throughout North America.",

The two genotypes responsible for most of the recent ND outbreaks in poultry and wild birds, GVI- and GVII-PMV1, diverged from a MRCA in the mid-1960s (Fig. 1A), approximately a decade after vaccination was implemented. The rapid global dispersal of new genotypes as they emerge implicate human involvement in establishing new viral genotypes, although we cannot rule out the bird migration could contribute in some areas. It is likely that the number of molecular changes that occurred to allow GVIaii viruses to successfully establish in pigeons is small given that only a few changes are needed for GVIb viruses to replicate in chickens. Our data demonstrate that PMV1 has a rapid evolutionary rate and that one of the extant sub-lineages introduced into North America is currently undergoing a population expansion. This suggests that the mixing of Columbiformes species with domestic chickens could facilitate the adaptation of potentially virulent viruses to chickens.",
