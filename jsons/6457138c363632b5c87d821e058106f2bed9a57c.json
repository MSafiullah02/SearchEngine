            "text": "As can be seen from the response of leaders to the current COVID-19 crisis, there is a strong desire to do something, anything to help the patient. Doing something makes not only the patient feel better, but also the doctor (or the leader). This has led to advocation of treatments based on data which are open to significant bias (Bik, 2020; Gautret et al., 2020) . Furthermore, much data are generated in ways which are not replicable or easily understandable, which limits their usefulness (Chalmers and Glasziou, 2009) . Worse still, some data are used intentionally to obfuscate (Ioannidis, 2016; Launer, 2020) . Obvious examples include \"nudging\" and marketing -especially when done in the guise of \"educational meetings\", or worse still, in the form of pseudo journal articles. On the other hand, researchers and clinicians need to engage with society to make sure that their work is relevant to current day problems, including those elements that make decisions, or fund research in a way that is transparent and minimizes the risk of bias . Doctors care about their patients and want reasonable certainty that their treatments benefit the patient. Doctors, like all human beings, are susceptible to influences that bias their judgment (Fenton and Khan, 2011) . As Cochrane himself noted, we remember our successes more than our failures. Against this background, doctors are surrounded by \"evidence\", some good, some not so good (Moynihan et al., 2019) . Evidence based medicine requires that three elements be taken into account when caring for a patient; the evidence, the patient perspective and the doctor's experience (Sackett, 1997) . All have to be considered, and all have to be aligned. Understanding the patient perspective requires an appreciation of the outcome that is important to the patient, as opposed to a pandering to whatever the patient articulates. This means applying the best evidence available to achieve that which is important, in partnership with the patient. Likewise, \"the doctor's experience\" is often misused to justify whatever care the doctor intuitively feels to be right, independent of the evidence. The use of high-quality evidence is therefore critical to prevent yielding to a patient's unjustified wants, or a doctor's biased inclinations. Understanding data is not intuitive and requires training in evidence and critical appraisal, which can go some way to mitigating this bias (Kulier et al., 2012) . The doctor has to work through all of these influences to provide real care to patients, and will end up providing care in line with his or her own \"understanding of the evidence\", which necessarily will have some bias. The problem arises when doctors either succumb to commercial influences, or become wrongly convinced that they are right. The good doctor therefore requires, in addition to empathizing with the patient, an understanding of the evidence, a posture of humility, and unshakable integrity (Mcintyre, 2019) .",

This is the case when the treatment (the signal) indicates an enormous improvement as compared to the natural course of the disease (the noise) (Glasziou et al., 2007) : for example when Lesley Brown conceived after IVF and gave birth to Louise, this proved the treatment to be effective, as Mrs. Brown had had a double-sided tubectomy several months earlier (Steptoe and Edwards, 1992) . Effectiveness was confirmed, based on an 'all-ornothing' rule, when more women without any natural conception chances had a baby after IVF. In reality however, such large signal-to-noise ratios are rare. The large majority of medical treatments generate, if effective, much smaller treatment benefits, and the success rates in the control groups are usually not zero. We then need additional tools to know the truth, including RCTs and large cohort studies (of which RCT is subtype establishing a cohort for follow up by randomisation at inception). Below, we discuss the arguments for both RCTs and big data.",

            "text": "First, Macklon et al. argue that RCTs take a long time, and technology and patient needs have evolved by the time the results of RCT become available . While that may be true, it need not necessarily be so. The reason that RCTs take a long time and are expensive can be found in human failure. Recent RCTs in reproductive medicine from China and Vietnam (Chen et al., 2016; Shi et al., 2018; Vuong et al., 2018) have been executed in short time periods, thus proving that the long time and high costs are not intrinsic to RCTs and are caused by external factors. Second, Macklon et al. argue that RCTs primarily serve to remove treatment options from the clinician and their patient . This of course is not true. The fact that many RCTs report negative findings is not the fault of the RCTs, but it is because the therapies they test apparently do not work. This is to be expected, as treatment effects, as argued above, are overestimated (Fenton and Khan, 2011) . In any event, knowing that an intervention does not work is just as important. Giving a treatment that does not work to a patient is harmful, either because it prevents an effective treatment being given, or it causes actual physical or financial harm. Another criticism of RCTs is that the patient population is so tightly defined that the results are often not applicable to the patient in the clinic, and that we need to consider not only the \"evidence\", but the specific circumstances or \"context\" of the patient (Macklon and Fauser, 2020) . This is of course true, and as stated, the doctor's judgment in applying the evidence is a necessary pre-requisite for the practice of evidence-based medicine. The issue though is how to change uncertainty to certainty. This is best done through RCTs. A good example is that, despite extensive data gathering over decades as to whether progesterone treatment reduces the rate of miscarriage in patients with threatened miscarriage, uncertainty continued. It was only when a well-conceived and well-conducted RCT was carried out, with pre-specified sub-groups across a whole range of patient characteristics, that the answer was reached (A. Arri Coomarasamy et al., 2019) . Aside from the excessive regulation around RCTs, the most significant obstacle to carrying out RCTs is the doctor. It seems that doctors, either consciously or subconsciously, do not want to contribute to trials. RCTs provide a clear view on truth; which, for a variety reasons, may be uncomfortable (Nietzsche, 2015) . This comes down to culture. Pediatric oncology culture has long had a culture of embracing uncertainty and entering patients into well run randomized controlled studies to bring about certainty (De Vries et al., 2011) . This is likely to have contributed to the remarkable improvement in survival of childhood cancer, something that unfortunately cannot be said for IVF success rates which have not improved over the past 5 years. Doing an RCT is like doing the dishes: if everyone does their small part, it is quickly done.",

There are ongoing governance issues which need to be addressed, such as where the data is stored, how to keep it safe, who owns the data and who is allowed to access the data. These problems are solvable but, in practice, are open to vested interests. The emphasis is usually on the \"big\" rather than the \"data\". Accuracy of data input is variable, depending on the setting and the particular variable in question, consequently interpreting the data and therefore any putative associations must be treated with caution. We have a problem with getting accurate \"small data\", let alone big data. Because the sample size with big data is large, it runs the risk of presenting a finding which is precise, but incorrect. This \"precision\" can be manipulated to obfuscate reality, and subsequently exploited by commercial interests. The cornerstone of interventional clinical trials is to have two equal groups of patients and then apply an intervention to one group and not to the other, without letting the patient switch to the other group. One problem with retrospective analysis such as big data, is that it is not known if the two groups are equal. Another problem is that it often does not determine the point at which a patient started a treatment, i.e. IUI and IVF might be started after different periods of infertility, which hampers comparison. Big data is of course useful to detect associations which can then be tested. There are many existing quality control databases which have validated and well-defined datasets which could be useful for generating hypotheses. Furthermore, when there is a change in policy, such as moving to single embryo transfer, then the effect can be easily and quickly seen through registries.",

The former tends to produce publications but usually has little or no translational value. The latter is the only type of research that from the outset aims to produce translational value. The challenge is to change the use of big data from a) to b). If big data is used only to solve problems of precision, then let's not get fooled -when small effects are immaterial clinically, big data (by producing statistical significance) is the enemy, not a friend. However, when we are able to let the research question determine what to do, for example in cluster RCTs, then big data could be of large value.",

It can, in some cases of large treatment effect, provide compelling evidence. However, big data also runs the significant risk of obfuscating the truth. RCTs on the other hand reduce uncertainty to levels that justify the use of treatments in clinical practice. To date, reproductive medicine and its add-ons have largely developed independent from RCTs (Farquhar, 2019) . The logistics of carrying out RCTs need not be prohibitive, and rather than discard them, the solution is to make them more part of everyday medical care. In our opinion, clinicians working in reproductive medicine have been too ready to embrace the latest innovations without properly testing them. Consequently, we continue to have uncertainty, we have fewer patients available for clinical studies, and less time as clinicians to participate in them. That is the fundamental problem.",
