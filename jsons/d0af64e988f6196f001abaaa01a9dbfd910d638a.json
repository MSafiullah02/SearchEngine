Perhaps as a consequence of these efforts, and in part due to social anxiety regarding infection and contact with healthcare providers, 3 there are likely to be a number of unforeseeable epidemiologic aftereffects. As people accommodate to social distancing recommendations by public health and government officials, avoid healthcare institutions and clinics-or resort to (sometimes limited) telemedical evaluations, we will likely observe a shift in the epidemiology of stroke and other medical conditions. 4 Milder symptoms of an acute cerebrovascular event-which could have historically prompted patients to seek medical attention, receive acute treatment and aggressive secondary stroke prevention-may now be minimized to the point that these patients will not present to the emergency room or notify their primary care physician. Because of this psychosocial consequence of a pandemic, it is possible that the reported incidence rate of acute ischemic stroke may decline during the COVID-19 pandemic, while the reported incidence rate of more severe cerebrovascular events (e.g., strokes due to large vessel occlusion) will remain stable, as these severe symptoms cannot be ignored by patients or family members.",

CUH is a 574-bed, tertiary care, Comprehensive Stroke Center in southern New Jersey that serves as a referral base for 5 Primary Stroke Centers in the region, for whom CUH offers formal telestroke services. Acute ischemic stroke was diagnosed clinically by a vascular neurologist as long as symptom onset occurred in the preceding two weeks (or onset was unknown), or if there was radiographic evidence of acute infarction on unenhanced computed tomography (CT) or diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging (DWI-MRI). Patients were compared between two treatment periods: (1) pre-COVID-19, which included patients admitted on dates between October 1, 2019 to February 29, 2020; and (2) COVID-19, which included patients admitted on dates between March 1, 2020 to April 15, 2020. March 1, 2020 was selected as the start date of the COVID-19 period as it was the date of the first New Jersey resident to develop COVID-19 symptoms, with serologic confirmation of SARS-CoV-2. (By March 20, 2020, the state of New Jersey was placed into lockdown by government authorities, however social distancing had become encouraged long before this.) To be included in this observational cohort, all patients underwent a non-contrast head CT to evaluate for intracranial hemorrhage or other structural brain lesions that could explain the patient's neurological symptoms. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) was not required.",

Linear regression was used to estimate the association between the COVID-19 period and length of hospital stay, while logistic regression was used to estimate the association between the COVID-19 period and categorical outcome variables. These models were adjusted for age, baseline NIHSS, and presence of LVO. An adjusted logistic regression model was also used to estimate the odds of LVO during the COVID-19 period, adjusting for age and NIHSS.

While there was no statistically significant difference in NIHSS between patients evaluated during the two periods, the NIHSS is a limited research instrument that does not perfectly capture stroke severity, 8 neurologic improvement, 9 or final infarct volume. 10 Patients with a severe aphasia, vision loss, or dominant hand weakness may have significant disability as a consequence of their stroke, but have relatively low NIHSS. 11 These cortical signs correlate with acute LVO-the natural history of which is almost always poorer than non-LVO strokes. 12 Furthermore, the median baseline NIHSS, the prevalence of LVO, and the adoption of comfort measures were all higher during the COVID-19 period. The high in-hospital mortality rate among patients evaluated during the COVID-19 period also speaks to the severity of the illness experienced by patients during this period. The observed in-hospital mortality rate of 21% after a median length of stay of only 2.5 days would be higher than what is predicted from the 14-25% 90-day mortality rates observed in the thrombectomy arms from the DAWN 13 and DEFUSE-3 14 clinical trials, and certainly higher than the 14-15% 90-day mortality rate observed from multicenter observational data including patients treated in randomized trials 15 and in routine clinical practice. 16 For these reasons, we believe stroke severity was greater during the COVID-Siegler et al 12 19 period than the months preceding it. At this point, we do not have 90-day mortality or functional outcome data on patients treated during the COVID-19 period, but we will be exploring this in future investigations and as part of an ongoing multicenter effort.",

However, for patients with normal CT imaging for whom CUH providers have a reasonable suspicion of stroke, our team will frequently repeat a head CT after 12-24 hours if MRI is not readily available (or when MRI use becomes restricted in order to prevent contamination). Therefore, at least for clinically-relevant infarcts (e.g., non-silent infarcts), we do not believe the lower use of MRI significantly contributes to the fall in new strokes.",

While we hope to maintain this degree of workflow efficacy, it is possible that patients with stroke may present later in the course of their illness, and may experience longer delays from arrival to imaging or treatment. These results warrant validation in larger, multicenter studies, and should encourage centers to emphasize safe and effective throughput of patients with critical conditions, including stroke.",

The small sample size raises the possibility of type I error. It is possible that more severe neurologic deficits, as captured by the NIHSS, may be more common among patients with stroke in the era of COVID-19. However, our single-center experience and preliminary results may be underpowered to detect these and other significant differences. It would have been more appropriate to compare identical periods in 2019 (e.g., 3/1/2019 -4/15/2019) to the COVID-19 period in 2020, however we chose the immediately preceding months as the \u2017control' period due to a more than doubled staffing of vascular neurologists and growing telestroke referral base by mid-2019. By the fall of 2019, we had already witnessed an increase in our center's acute stroke volume, therefore comparing identical weeks in 2019 and 2020 may have falsely underestimated the anticipated stroke rate from 3/1/2020 -4/15/2020. Selecting March 1, 2020 as the start date of the COVID-19 period was also somewhat arbitrary. However, it was selected based on emerging public health data that month, and allowed for data to be analyzed by month as well as by day. A post hoc analysis of data stratified by March 20, 2020 was also performed with similar results as shown in Tables 1 and 2 , with notable exceptions being a loss of significance in the difference of new stroke diagnoses between periods. That said, higher NIHSS and the presence of LVO remained more common among patients admitted after 3/20/2020 (median NIHSS 9 vs. 5, p=0.06; 46% LVO vs. 22%, p<0.01). Due to the early release of these results, we also lack long-term outcome data regarding functional disability and readmission rates-which may be higher during the COVID-19 period due to a higher proportion of discharges to home. These results should be interpreted with caution until they are validated by larger scale, multiinstitutional studies, which are ongoing.",

In this prospective observational cohort, we observed a significant decline in the number of new acute stroke diagnoses at our tertiary care, Comprehensive Stroke Center in southern New Jersey. New Jersey is second only to New York as the state with the highest number of confirmed COVID-19 cases 31 -with more than 85,000 cases as of April 20, 2020-therefore our results may not be presently generalizable to institutions where SARS-CoV-2 is ubiquitous. However, these findings may be quickly observed at other institutions as more and more cases of COVID-19 are diagnosed and patients learn to avoid hospital systems. Unsurprisingly, the number of patients with LVO did not appreciably change during the COVID-19 period when compared to the pre-COVID-19 period. This supports our hypothesis that patients with milder symptoms may be intentionally avoidant of seeking treatment at healthcare facilities. This effect may manifest both in the number of calls to emergency medical services, and in the number of patients who present to the ED via private vehicles. To the authors' knowledge, this study is the first to confirm Siegler et al 17 anecdotal reports 7 that stroke admission rates may decline because of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic. Additionally, with the focus of our healthcare system shifted towards identifying patients with SARS-CoV-2 and preserving healthcare resources, patients with mild stroke symptoms will possibly be discharged prematurely without a complete stroke evaluation or a secondary stroke prevention strategy. Furthermore, the utilization of DWI-MRI is decreasing, therefore patients have to have more severe focal neurological deficits to be diagnosed with an acute ischemic stroke, when head CT is the sole imaging modality being used. Consequently, this has the potential to impact estimates of stroke-related disability. Larger studies representing multiple populations are underway and may better elucidate the clinical implications of missed stroke diagnoses and other social consequences of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic.",

There was no change in the monthly number of patients harboring an acute LVO, although the proportion of patients with an LVO was significantly greater during the COVID-19 period. We do not believe the local incidence rate of acute stroke is falling. This perceived fall in new stroke diagnoses may be related to several social and healthcare factors and parallels other observations in the vascular literature 4 and the media.7",

There was also a 59% decrease in the mean number of daily transfers from outside hospitals (p<0.01) and a non-significant 25% decrease in the mean number of daily telestroke consultation requests (p=0.08). Among patients who were admitted directly through our emergency department, there was a significant 55% decrement in the number of patients presenting via private vehicle (p<0.01). and a non-significant 29% decrement in the number of patients presenting via emergency medical services (p=0.09; Table 1). While patients evaluated during the COVID-19 period were at a greater odds of presenting with cortical signs (OR 1.89, 95%CI 1.02-3.54, p=0.04), this was driven by the higher odds of these patients harboring a LVO (OR 2.22, 95%CI 1.19-4.15, p=0.01). The higher odds of LVO during the COVID-19 period remained significant after adjustment for age and stroke severity (aOR 2.06, 95%CI 1.02-4.16, p=0.04). There was no appreciable difference in the number of total monthly LVO cases (mean 0.39/day pre-COVID-19 vs. 0.43/day, p=0.61) although the proportion of patients with LVO grew (Table 1). There was also no significant difference in the distribution of stroke etiologies between the two periods (p=0.98; Table 2). Irrespective of the final diagnosis, fewer brain MRIs were performed during the COVID-19 period when compared to pre-COVID-19 (mean 148/mo. vs. 349/mo., p<0.01), and non-significantly fewer stroke protocol MRIs performed every month (26 vs. 56, p=0.08). Among patients with a final diagnosis of stroke, MRI was also utilized less frequently during the COVID-19 period versus pre-COVID-19 (55% vs. 88%, p<0.01). There was no significant delay from the time patients were last known well to ED arrival, arrival to computed tomography scan or to thrombolysis. Patients treated during COVID-19 had a shorter hospital length of stay when compared to patients admitted during the pre-COVID-19 period (\u03b2=-2.91, 95%CI -5.83 -0.02, p=0.05), and this remained significant after adjustment for age, NIHSS, and presence of LVO (adjusted \u03b2=-3.39, 95%CI -6.10 --0.68, p=0.01). Patients admitted during the COVID-19 period were at a greater odds of dying during their hospitalization in unadjusted regression (OR 3.65, 95%CI 1.52-8.72, p<0.01), however this effect became non-significant after adjustment for age, NIHSS, and LVO (aOR 2.16, 95%CI 0.80-5.86, p=0.13). Only 9 patients had available polymerase chain reaction test results for the SARS-CoV-2 virus during the COVID-19 period, and 1 tested positive (who expired during their hospitalization).",
