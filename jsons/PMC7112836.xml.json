Turkey coronaviral enteritis is characterized by anorexia, watery droppings, marked dehydration, and decreased body weight gain (Gonder et al., 1976). Repeated outbreaks of TCoV-associated acute enteritis in young turkey poults occurred in Indiana, North Carolina, and other states for the last decade. This disease contributed to significant economic losses and remains as a serious threat to the turkey producers. The coronaviral enteritis in areas with high concentrations of turkeys on a year-round basis is not easily eliminated and is encountered frequently in turkey poults (Nagaraja and Pomeroy, 1997). Treatments of the disease are often not successful and there are currently no effective vaccine or medication to prevent viral infection. Correct and easy method for diagnosis of TCoV would pave a way for more effective control of this disease.",

The major structural proteins of coronavirus include phosphorylated nucleocapsid (N) protein, peplomeric glycoprotein (spike protein, S), and transmembrane glycoprotein (membrane protein, M). The spike protein contributes to the distinctive peplomers on the viral surface and contains neutralizing and group-specific epitopes. The spike protein is highly variable among different coronaviruses while M and N proteins are more conserved among coronaviruses between different antigenic groups (Saif, 1993).",

In contrast, it was demonstrated that bovine coronavirus (BCoV) caused experimental enteric infection in turkey (Ismail et al., 2001). Along with this result, close relationship between TCoV and BCoV were previously reported and TCoV was placed in antigenic group II as BCoV (Dea et al., 1990, Verbeek and Tijssen, 1991). These cumulative results incur a postulated complicate nature of causative factors of turkey coronaviral enteritis. Further investigations of interactions among TCoV, IBV, and BCoV in the turkey flocks and in the field is crucial for developments of effective strategies to prevent and control this disease. Development of easy and simple diagnostic methods for detection and differentiation of TCoV, IBV, and BCoV in turkey intestines is necessary for studies on the contributions of theses different agents to the disease.",

These methods need multiple steps to differentiate TCoV, IBV, and BCoV. Detection of TCoV infection by antibody-capture ELISA was demonstrated using IBV as coating antigen (Loa et al., 2000). This method cannot differentiate TCoV from IBV due to the cross reactivity of antibodies. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assay is a new approach for detecting many veterinary important microorganisms with the distinct advantages of high sensitivity and specificity. Multiplex PCR assay for simultaneous detection and differentiation of bacterial and viral pathogens has been described. For example, IBV strains Mass and Ark could be differentially identified in a multiplex PCR assay (Wang and Khan, 1999).",

The prototype isolate of TCoV was obtained from the American Type Culture Collection (ATCC, Rockville, MD). The viruses were propagated in 22-day-old embryonated turkey eggs as previously described (Loa et al., 2001). The presence of TCoV in the intestines of embryos was confirmed by TCoV-specific IFA and electron microscopy at the Indiana State Animal Disease Diagnostic Laboratory in West Lafayette, Indiana. Intestines of turkey embryos infected with TCoV were cut into pieces and homogenized with five-fold volume of phosphate buffered saline (PBS) solution. These homogenates were clarified by centrifugation at 1500 \u00d7 \ng for 10 min. The supernatants containing TCoV were used as virus source for preparation of RNA templates for reverse transcription (RT)-PCR reaction. For examination of sensitivity of RT-PCR reaction for TCoV RNA, the supernatants from centrifugation of the intestinal homogenate at 1500 \u00d7 \ng was ultracentrifuged at 100,000 \u00d7 \ng for 3 h with a 2 ml cushion of 60% (w/v) sucrose solution. The opalescent band on top of the 60% sucrose solution was collected and layered onto a 40\u201360% sucrose gradient and ultracentrifuged at 100,000 \u00d7 \ng for 20 h. Fractions were collected from the bottom of the tubes. The virus purified by sucrose gradient was used as source for preparation of RNA templates to determine the sensitivity of RT-PCR reaction.",
