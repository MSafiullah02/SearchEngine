            "text": "The freshwater Chinese mitten crab, Eriocheir sinensis Milne Edwards, is an economically important species cultured in China during the last 10 years. Culture areas have increased rapidly in inland provinces of China. However, with the development of intensive culture, various diseases have appeared and severely affected crab production. Among these, \u2018black gill syndrome\u2019 (BGS) has caused important economic losses since 1996, particularly in the main culture provinces in China such as Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Anhui and Shanghai. Another major sign of the disease resembles a respiratory problem. Thus, the disease is often called \u2018sighs disease\u2019 (SD) by farmers, because sounds reminiscent of sighs can be clearly heard from affected crabs, caused by slow extrusion of bubbles at night. Sluggishness and anorexia are other non\u2010specific signs. During investigations on this disease we found a virus developing in connective tissue cells showing the general properties of the Roniviridae and designated it EsRNV for \u2018E. sinensis ronivirus\u2019. We report here histological investigations, viral ultrastructure and some genomic features of this new crab virus.",

However, the rhabdo\u2010like virus A (RhVA or EGV\u20102) of Callinectes sapidus (Yudin & Clark 1978, 1979) resembles a ronivirus rather than a rhabovirus on the basis of its size, shape and general structure.",

Naturally infected animals do not all exhibit BGS, and EsRNV was not the only pathogen found in diseased animals. In another farm, a DNA virus in the R\u2010cells of the HP and a proteo\u2010like bacterium were isolated in crabs exhibiting BGS, but were present in only 10% of sampled animals (data not shown).
