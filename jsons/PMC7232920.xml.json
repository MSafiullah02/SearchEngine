Ironically, hyperinduction of proinflammatory cytokine production (cytokine storm syndrome) can put a patient at risk for complications associated with COVID-19. Early recognition of this possibility is required to inform management and treatment decisions. This is important as potential treatments with existing approved therapies with proven safety profiles such as tocilizumab (an IL-6 receptor blocker) and Janus kinase (JAK) inhibitors have been mooted to address the rising mortality in patients with COVID-19 pneumonia and elevated IL-6 [3]. Identifying patients to direct these specific treatments is aided by measuring C-reactive protein (CRP), interleukin 6 (IL-6), ferritin and procalcitonin. IL-6 drives CRP and is an earlier marker of the status of a patients\u2019 inflammatory status. Elevated IL-6 concentrations together with the velocity of an increasing result portend an impending deterioration in clinical status.",

SARS-CoV-2 has a predilection for type II epithelial cells of the alveoli, with the lower airways being the dominant site of injury in COVID-19 [12].

While increased concentrations of bilirubin, prothrombin (a vitamin K-dependent coagulation factor) and fibrinogen (a 340-kDa glycoprotein) synthesised in the liver are indicative of liver dysfunction. Prothrombin is proteolytically cleaved to form thrombin which converts fibrinogen to fibrin and then to a fibrin-based blood clot to occlude blood vessels and arrest bleeding. A D-dimer is a fibrin degradation product present in the blood after a blood clot is degraded by fibrinolysis. In acute sepsis, the coagulation system becomes diffusely activated with consumption of multiple clotting factors resulting in disseminated intravascular coagulopathy (DIC) [16]. Pathogenesis is driven by an upregulation of procoagulant mechanisms and simultaneous downregulation of natural anticoagulants. The prevention of DIC in COVID-19 patients is critical to prevent multiorgan failure and efforts should centre on stratifying patients at high risk for DIC. The prothrombin test (PT) (which measures the time it takes blood to clot (Normally: 11\u201312.5 s)), fibrinogen, D-dimers and the platelet count are significant predictors of disease severity as test abnormalities herald the onset of DIC. Klok et al. report a 31% incidence of thrombotic complications in ICU patients with COVID-19 and reinforce the recommendation for strict adherence to thrombosis prophylaxis [17].",

The speculated mechanism is that severe systemic inflammation leads to atherosclerotic plaque instability and rupture. Elevated high-sensitivity cardiac troponin concentrations are indicative of myocardial injury. Shi et al. reported that greater proportions of COVID-19 patients with cardiac injury required non-invasive mechanical ventilation (38 of 82 [46.3%] vs 13 of 334 [3.9%]; P < 0.001) or invasive mechanical ventilation (18 of 82 [22.0%] vs 14 of 334 [4.2%]; P < 0.001) when compared to those without cardiac injury [21]. Further, that in this cohort, higher concentrations of high-sensitivity cardiac troponin were associated with higher mortality [21]. Ruan et al. also reported that patients with CVD infected with SARS-CoV-2 had a significantly increased risk of death [4]. These authors determined that some of their patients with SARS-CoV-2 died of fulminant myocarditis. Direct viral infection of the vascular epithelium and myocardium has been promulgated based on the unique affinity of SARS-CoV-2 for the host ACE2 receptor [22]. Hence, raising the possibility of myocarditis occurring in some COVID-19 patients irrespective of existing or pre-existing CVD [20, 21, 23].",

Of note, DPP-4/CD26 receptor expression has been shown to be significantly reduced in vivo on correction of vitamin D deficiency [28]. Vitamin D has also been shown to reduce IL-6 production in monocytes [29]. This evidence provides a rationale for supplementing COVID-19-positive patients with vitamin D [30].",
