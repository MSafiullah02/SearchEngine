It is possible that the high mortality rate in our study can be explained by more severe underlying diseases in our patient population. Another possible explanation is the association with pneumonia as the source of infection, which was two to four times more frequent in A. baumannii compared with other Gram-negative nosocomial pathogens. We did not assess the appropriateness of empirical antibiotic treatment, clonality or virulence.",
