The proportion of legionellosis among pneumonia cases reported in the literature can vary substantially [56] [57] [58] , and because pneumonia occurs frequently in the population, the proportion assumed can have a significant effect on the estimated incidence of legionellosis.

Second, the Dutch surveillance system is considered to be of high quality [60, 61] . The number of reported cases of legionellosis in the Netherlands is relatively high compared with other countries [62] , suggesting that under-reporting should be relatively low, partly because routine use of the Legionella pneumophila urinary antigen test has become standard of care in patients with severe community-acquired pneumonia in many Dutch hospitals [63] .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 430, "end": 434, "text": "[55]", "ref_id": "BIBREF57"}, {"start": 770, "end": 774, "text": "[56]", "ref_id": "BIBREF58"}, {"start": 923, "end": 927, "text": "[56]", "ref_id": "BIBREF58"}, {"start": 928, "end": 932, "text": "[57]", "ref_id": "BIBREF59"}, {"start": 933, "end": 937, "text": "[58]", "ref_id": "BIBREF60"}, {"start": 1187, "end": 1191, "text": "[59]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1328, "end": 1332, "text": "[60,", "ref_id": "BIBREF63"}, {"start": 1333, "end": 1336, "text": "61]", "ref_id": "BIBREF64"}, {"start": 1453, "end": 1457, "text": "[62]", "ref_id": "BIBREF65"}, {"start": 1701, "end": 1705, "text": "[63]", "ref_id": "BIBREF66"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Respiratory diseases"}, {"text": "Third, in the period 2007-2011, 40% of the reported legionellosis cases (range 32% in 2010 to 46% in 2007) were travel-related and thus were likely to have been acquired abroad and cannot be prevented through the implementation of national control measures.
