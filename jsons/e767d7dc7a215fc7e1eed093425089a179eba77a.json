The response is quickly evolving, making it difficult to understand how decision makers have influenced each other, and whom among the decision makers have emerged as leaders on different topics. To overcome this difficulty, we analyze the Twitter narrative of various decision makers through dynamic topic modeling. Specifically, we analyze a dataset of all COVID-19 related tweets by U.S. Governors, the President, and his cabinet members between January 1st 2020 and April 7th 2020. We use a Hawkes binomial topic model (HBTM) (Mohler et al. 2016) to track evolving sub-topics around risk, testing and vaccination/treatment. The model also allows for estimation of Granger causality (Xu, Farajtabar, and Zha 2016) that we use to construct influence networks amongst government officials.",

For a review of point process modeling of social media data see (Kim, Paini, and Jurdak 2020) . Compared to standard LDA-type Hawkes processes, the HBTM has the advantage that it jointly estimates a network that can be used to measure influence; additionally, HBTM automatically detects the number of clusters. The temporal aspect of HBTM-like dynamic topic models tend to improve topic coherence in relation to LDA (see Figure 2 ). ",

We then performed a keyword expansion (Buntain, McGrath, and Behlendorf 2018; Mohler et al. 2016) to extract a list of keywords related to COVID-19. This method iteratively adds keywords to a query list whose frequencies in the set of matching tweets are significantly higher than in the general sample. We then scanned the corpus with the expanded keyword list, obtaining a set of 7881 COVID-19 related tweets by these politicians. These tweets were further sorted in time-ascending order and converted to a bagof-word representation. The vocabulary was then restricted to the top 425 words according to frequency. ",

We first apply HBTM to tweets containing the word \"risk\". A sequence of clusters are illustrated in the top row of Fig. 6 . The emergence of this sub-category coincides with the start of the second phase of the general timeline, and it appears that the CDC was among the first to mention how serious the risk was and asked for immediate actions. However, the subsequent clusters in early March indicate that both state and federal governments (Republicans and Democrats) were telling the public that the risk remains low. Also in this period, we observe calls for washing hands to reduce risk, and that seniors were identified to be the most vulnerable. After March 15, the narrative changes and the high risk to the general population is acknowledged. Keywords like age and adult indicate the high risk across age groups, even for young adults. The word high frequently co-occurs with test and quarantine; due to the high risk of transmission, state governments increased testing and enforced quarantine(s). Overall, from left to right, the sequence of clusters show a clear trend in the narrative from low risk in late February to high risk in April. Next, we apply HBTM to tweets containing the words \"vaccine\" and \"treatment\". The resulting clusters are illustrated in the middle row of Fig. 6 . In mid-March, keywords launch, trial, clinicaltrial, phase, and candidate indicate that vaccine candidates were identified and entered the clinical trial phase. We can also see the National Institute of Health (NIH) partner with the pharmaceutical industry in developing the vaccine. Later in March, we start to see clusters where state governors (mainly Democrats) commented on the lack of resources, equipment, ventilators, and hospital beds. We also see cabinet members (specifically Sec. of Health @SecAzar) giving updates about vaccine development (genetic sequence and clinical trial). Another narrative is around an agreement (agree) with insurance companies to ease the burden of the pandemic on their customers. Additionally, we see the request to create global researcher team in developing a vaccine. In general, the clusters here suggest that the search for a vaccine has been a collective effort that crosses political parties and national boundaries.",

Con- cern about the capacity of testing facilities and hospitals is also discussed in early March. In mid-March, testing is expanded to the community, followed by requests for expanding facility capacity and increasing laboratories. During this period, state governors (especially Democrats, the two highest green markers in Fig. 6 ) start updating test results (in particular number of positive cases) and providing stats in their press conferences. The HBTM model identifies a cluster in which drive thru site is suggested as a way to expand testing capacity. In early April, we observe that the narrative has shifted away from a lack of testing resources; keywords indicate that screen tools, test kits, and test sites are available, and the testing capacity has increased.",

We also constructed influence networks amongst government officials using Granger causality inferred from the network Hawkes process. President Trump stands out for spontaneity, yet appears to have little influence with respect to network cross-excitation.
