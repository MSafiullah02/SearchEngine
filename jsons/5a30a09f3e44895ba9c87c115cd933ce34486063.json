Proteins denature with increasing temperature, chemical denaturant concentration or pressure, among which pressure unfolding is the mildest, most reversible method. The protein's global size and shape changes during unfolding can be monitored by Small Angle X-ray Scattering (SAXS) in solution. As SAXS data acquisition requires high protein concentration hence small sample volume, a new microvolume high pressure cell has been designed for synchrotron SAXS analysis. The sample is enclosed in a greaseplugged 20\u00b5l plastic cell with kapton windows, which isolates the sample from the pressure medium while transmitting pressure to the sample without a change in sample pathlength. The inner cell is then placed in water between 2 diamond windows in the pressure cell for pressurization. The pressure range is 0 to 3.5kbar. As a rst test, we studied the behaviour of bovine beta-lactoglobulin (bLG) and horse skeletal muscle holomyoglobin (HMB) under pressure. bLG unfolding was partially reversible under pressure. HMB at pH 9 proved to be sensitive to radiation damage, but radiation effects could be distinguished from pressure effects. HMB denaturation under pressure was mostly irreversible.",

The dynamical connectivity between the basins of attraction of different energy minima is accessed by the identi cation of the rst order saddles dividing them. A statistical analysis of the con gurational distance between connected minima shows that the motion on the energy landscape consists in a series of many short activated jumps, long jumps being relatively rare. In this respect the steepness of the energy funnel shows not to be the only factor that drives folding. Though good and moderate folders may show very similar funnels, in sequences characterized by a good folding propensity the probability of long con gurational jumps shows to be higher than in other cases. The analysis is complemented by the evaluation of geometric quantities related to the landscape curvature.",

It mainly consists of a beta-turn (residues 2-5) and of an alpha-helix (residues 9-18). The beta-turn is stabilized both by the classical i, i+3 hydrogen bond and by an additional one involving the N2 side chain and K4 amide proton. In order to assess the role of N2 in the oxidative folding, it was replaced by the isosteric but hydrophobic Abu residue. In contrast to apamin, that quantitatively yields the native disul de pattern, the [Abu2]-apamin analogue yielded not only the apamin-type disulde pattern (60%) but also the endothelin (C1-C15, C3-C11) pattern (40%). NMR structural studies of these two isomers revealed that the A5-P6 amide bond mainly adopts a cis conformation. Our results support the essential role of the N2 hydrogen bond, both in the yield of the native pattern and in the conformation of the A5-P6 amide bond of apamin.",

The geometrical mosaic objects, the physical events of phase separation and the linear heterogeneous biopolymers forming clusters seem to be the examples. A fractal appears to be a good model to be used in such studies. During the fractal construction, a part of the original geometrical space is removed. The removed part comprises the fractal complement. We compare Monte-Carlo simulations of a two-dimensional Sierpinski gasket and one-dimensional Cantor set to see if the fractal correlation dimension might be different for a fractal and the complement fractal. Computations of the fractal correlation dimension of the Cantor set d F , and that of the fractal complement, d C , show a nite gap of dimensionality d = d C -d F 0.3. In the simulation of the Sierpinski gasket, which is a 2D analogue of the Cantor set, the gap tends to zero with the number of generations increase. We invoke the Landau theorem about impossibility of the equilibrium coexistence of macroscopic physical phases in linear physical systems to propose that the difference fractal correlation dimension may be the geometrical implication of that condition. We are referring to several linear biological objects exhibiting higher dimension mosaic structure, to discuss a possible application of the fractal correlation dimensionality in structural genomics.",

Insights into the three-dimensional properties of HCA clusters have been gained through Vorono\u00ef tessellations, which we have developed for protein 3D structure analysis. As HCA clusters mainly correspond to the internal faces of regular secondary structures, we wished to further analyse their 3D environments. In this context, protein folded core can be described as a compact assembly of these HCA clusters. With the Vorono\u00ef cells characteristics associated with each hydrophobic amino acid of HCA clusters, like their number of edges per face, their number of faces and their surfaces, it is possible to analyse the interactions between hydrophobic clusters. We have highlighted some geometric and assembly characteristics for a lot of cluster types, within a dictionary of 105 clusters preferentially associated with one of the two regular secondary structures. The link between sequence information and characteristics of the 3D neighbourhood of clusters in their major regular secondary structure states open new perspectives for protein fold prediction from the sequence information alone.",

The T4 bacteriophage life cycle is modulated by RegB which mediate speci c mRNA degradations. RegB cleaved the mRNA at the middle of the translation initiation region (Shine-Dalgarno SD). Studies had shown that RegB activity is enhanced with addition of S1 which is normaly required for the translation of mRNA in case of unusual SD regions. S1 is considered as a key factor of translation's inititiation. Composed of six similar domains (F1-F6), it interacts with the ribosome by his F1-F2 domains and with the mRNA by F3-F6. We had shown that the F345 fragments got the same properties than the whole protein. Many global architectures had been published (linear or globular conformation). Then we try to understand what is the catalysis way of S1 in the RegB activation and in RNA recognition. We study the global conformation of F345 fragment. For that, we use NMR to determinate the domains interfaces. At rst we made the NMR backbone assignement of 15N/13C/2H labeled fragments (F34-F45). Then we analysed HSQC overlapping of each fragments in order to identify interfaces residues. The residues identi cation on S1 homologous model allowed us to determinate interaction region between domains.

Related peptides have previously been shown to exhibit antibiotic and DNA transfection activities. The 26-residue LAH 4 X 4 and LAH 4 X 6 peptides were designed in such a manner to form amphipathic helical structures in membrane environments. Four histidines and four/six variable amino acids X constitute one face of the helix whereas leucines and alanines characterize the opposite hydrophobic surface. The dichroic ratio of ATR-FTIR spectra, or the orientation-dependent 15 N solid-state NMR chemical shift have been used to follow the pH-dependent transition from in-plane to transmembrane alignments upon increase in pH. A theoretical model of the topological modulations is presented and the experimental transition curves analysed in order to reveal the Gibbs free energy of transition. The novel concept provides access to the free energy changes associated with the amino acids X incorporated into an extended -helix and in the context of phospholipid bilayers. For the peptides of the LAH 4 X 4 series the Gibbs free energies associated with the transition from the membrane interface to the bilayer interior follow the sequence of amino acids: L < A I < S F < T G < V W << Y. Here we present a novel solid-state NMR approach which allows for the accurate determination of the tilt and rotational pitch angles of peptides reconstituted into uniaxially oriented membranes. The method works with transmembrane or in-plane oriented peptides that have been labelled with 3,3,3-2 H 3 -alanine and 15 N-leucine at two selected sites. Proton-decoupled 15 N and 2 H solid-state NMR spectroscopy at sample orientations of the membrane normal parallel to the magnetic eld direction have been used to characterize the tilt and rotational pitch angle of these peptides in considerable detail. The same samples when inserted into the magnetic eld at 90 degrees tilted alignments provide valuable information on the rotational diffusion constants in membranes and thereby of the association and size of peptide complexes within the membrane environments. Whereas monomeric transmembrane peptides exhibit spectral averaging and well-de ned resonances, larger complexes are characterized by broad spectral line shapes. In particular the deuterium line shape is sensitive to association of a few transmembrane helices. In contrast, the formation of much larger complexes affects the 15 N chemical shift spectrum.

Chauhan, D. Sahal International Centre For Genetic Engineering & Biotechnology,new delhi 110067,india A 16 residues long, water soluble, monomeric -hairpin peptide \"trpzip\" [Cochran et al (2001) PNAS 98, 5578-5583], stabilized by tryptophan zipper has been linked via a tetraglycyl linker to a hydrophobic didehydrophenylalnine ( F) containing helical octapeptide. Circular dichroism studies of this 28 residues long peptide, \"trpzipalpha\" (Ac-GEWTWDDATKTWTWTE-GGGG-FAL FAL FA-NH 2 ) in water have revealed the presence of both the -hairpin and the helical conformations. This is the rst instance where a F containing peptide has been found to display a helical fold in water. The uorescence emission wavelengths of Tryptophan in Ac-G-W-G-NH 2 , trpzip and trpzipalpha were 341.5, 332.8 and 332.6 nm respectively. The uorescence quantum yield of trpzip was 2.6 fold higher than trpzipalpha suggesting that proximal interactions between the -hairpin and the helix caused the quenching of tryptophan uorescence in the former by the Fs in the latter. The molar ellipticity of the far UV couplet characteristic of trpzip was reduced in trpzipalpha and the CD based thermal melting temperatures at 228 nm were 62 C (trpzip) and 57 C (trpzipalpha). A concentration dependent variable temperature CD study in water showed that in trpzipalpha, increasing temperature is detrimental to the -hairpin, but it augments the helical motif by intermolecular oligomerization. Our results show that in water, trpzipalpha exhibits long-range interactions between two different secondary structures.",

A notable case in which natively unfolded state appears to have physiological signi cance is the E. coli YoeB-YefM toxin-antitoxin (TA) module. A crucial element in proper functioning of TA systems requires physiological instability of the antitoxin in contrast to the stable pro le of its toxin partner. We have shown that YefM antitoxin is a natively unfolded protein, lacking secondary structure even at low temperatures. In contrast, its toxin partner has a well-folded conformation at physiological temperatures. We suggest that the structural-based differential thermodynamic stability between the two components is the cause for their differential physiological stability, since structural instability of the antitoxin exposes it to cellular quality-control machinery. We further revealed that YefM and YoeB interact and form tight complex and determined it stoichiometry. A potential use of TA systems is as novel antibacterial targets. Indeed, we identi ed homologous yefM-yoeB systems in a large number of bacteria including major pathogens. We aim to design peptides capable of interfering with the YefM-YoeB interaction, thus releasing the toxin to execute its detrimental function. For this purpose, we identi ed a short linear determinant within YefM that is involved in YoeB interaction. This peptide motif will be optimized for development of antibacterial lead molecules.",

Here we report the unfolding characteristics of the monomeric DDLC1 at pH 3, due to urea and guanidine hydrochloride, by various biophysical techniques. It is observed that the unfolding pathways due to the two denaturants have many differences. Urea unfolding seems to be two state, while guanidine unfolding is more complex. The NMR experiments carried out at low denaturant concentrations have enabled detailed characterization of the structure and dynamics of the near native excited states of the protein. These are similar to the native state in structure, except for the small extensions of the helices in the Nterminal half of the protein. However, the local stabilities of the and -strands are perturbed and this occurs differently in the two denaturants. In the guanidine case the entire multi-stranded -sheet in the C-terminal half is destabilized. In either case the motional characteristics, seem to suggest the presence of a nite population of the dimer in the excited state ensemble. These states are suggested to be likely intermediates in the momoner-dimer transition, and their characterization here thus provides clues to the molecular mechanism of the transition.

The structures of complexes between vinculin and peptides corresponding to the VBSs show that the residues which interact with vinculin are buried in the hydrophobic core of the helical bundles of the talin domains. NMR studies of the interaction of one of these domains with vinculin shows that it involves a major structural change in the talin fragment, including unfolding of one of its four helices, to make the VBS accessible.

We found HFIP to have a very strong af nity for PC membranes and carried out a series of experiments to investigate this af nity. 1 Binding of HFIP to PC membranes was found to be reversible and we exploited this property in 2D crystal trials of our synthetic peptides. We over expressed the C-terminal domain of BrKA, a gram negative autotransporter protein, which forms a beta-barrel channel in the outer membrane (OMP), for comparison with our model peptides. We performed 2D crystal trials on the OMP and imaged the resulting protein arrays by STEM and AFM. A protein spontaneously folds into a unique native structure in physiological conditions. This process accompanies a huge loss of the conformational entropy (CE). Our major concern is to specify the factor that can compete with the CE loss. The previous discussions concerning protein folding have been focused on contributions to the free energy of folding from the interaction potentials in a system. A view lacking in earlier studies is that the folding is critically in uenced by the translational movement of water molecules. When solute particles contact each other in a solvent, the excluded volumes for the solvent molecules overlap, and the total volume available to their translational movement increases. This leads to a gain in the translational entropy (TE) of the solvent. This type of TE effect should be much stronger in protein folding where the tight packing of the side chains occurs. An elaborate statistical-mechanical theory is employed to analyze the TE of water in which a peptide or a protein molecule is immersed. It is shown that the TE gain upon folding is large enough to compete with the CE loss. When water is replaced by another solvent whose molecular size is larger, the TE gain decreases to a remarkable extent. We suggest that the entropic loss accompanying the self-assembly and the formation of ordered structures in a living system is compensated mostly by the TE gain of water, highlighting an aspect of the crucial importance of water in sustaining life.",

Jing Institute of Biophysics, Chinese Academy of Sciences, National Laboratory of Biomacromolecules, Beijing, China Ribosome recycling factor (RRF) consists of two domains and, in concert with elongation factor EF-G, triggers dissociation of the post-termination ribosomal complex. However, the exact function of the individual domains of RRF remains unclear. To clarify this, two RRF chimeras, EcoDI/TteDII and TteDI/EcoDII, were created by exchanging the RRF domains between the proteins from Escherichia coli and Thermoanaerobacter tengcongensis. The ribosome recycling activity of the RRF chimeras was compared with their wild-type RRFs by using in vivo and in vitro activity assays. The experiments show that like wild-type TteRRF, the EcoDI/TteDII chimera fails to complement the RRF ts phenotype of E.coli LJ14 (frr ts ) strain and has no polysome breakdown activity. However, under the same conditions, the TteDI/EcoDII chimera complements the RRF ts phenotype and has polysome breakdown activity equivalent to that of wild-type EcoRRF. The results indicate that domain II of RRF is the functional domain that is mainly responsible for the disassembly of the post-termination ribosomal complex, and the speci c interaction between RRF and EF-G on the ribosomes mainly depends on the interaction between domain II of RRF and EF-G; while domain I of RRF is the main contributor for binding ribosomes and maintaining the stability of the RRF molecule. This study provides direct genetic and biochemical evidence for the assignment of individual functions of RRF domains.",

Recently many experimental studies have shown variations of conformational propensity and exibility along the backbone chain of fully denatured proteins. It has been supposed that areas of residual structure may serve as initiation sites of protein folding. However, the physical origin of these variations is still unclear. We analyze the structure of fully urea-denatured ubiquitin. The experimental veri cation of conformational propensities of protein backbone is obtained through structurally dependent NMR parameters. Although the secondary structure of ubiquitin under strong denatured conditions is not detectable and no correlation with the native overall topology is found, the variations of NMR parameters along the backbone follow the secondary structure elements of its native state. We show that these variations are in accord with the recently developed electrostatic screening model of denatured proteins (1). In this model, the backbone conformations of residues in unfolded protein are determined by local backbone electrostatic interactions and their screening by backbone solvation. Many virulence factors from gram-negative bacteria are autotransporter proteins. The nal step of autotransporter secretion is C Nterminal threading through the outer membrane (OM), followed by folding. This process requires neither ATP hydrolysis nor a proton gradient. Pertactin, an autotransporter from Bordetella pertussis and the largest -helix structure solved to date, folds much more slowly than expected based on size and native state topology, yet folding intermediates are not aggregation-prone. Equilibrium denaturation results in the formation of a partially folded structure, a stable core comprising the C-terminal half of the protein. Examination of the pertactin crystal structure does not reveal the origin of the enhanced C-terminal stability. Yet sequence analysis reveals that, despite size and sequence diversity, all autotransporters are predicted to fold into parallel -helices, suggesting this structure may be important for secretion. For example, slow folding in vivo could prevent premature folding of in the periplasm prior to the assembly of the OM porin. Moreover, extra stability in the C-terminal rungs of the -helix may serve as a template for the formation of the native protein during secretion, and formation of the growing template may contribute to the energy-independent translocation mechanism. Coupled with the sequence analysis, these results suggest a general mechanism for autotransporter secretion.",

We've also investigated the interaction between T5, IRA phages and directly FhuA by means of viscometry. The calorimetric result of heat denaturation of membrane protein FhuA and next deconvolution of the recorded calorimetric curve with two transitions has shown that in a chosen conditions the structure of FhuA consists of 4 domains. Though both T5 and IRA phages grow on the common bacterial strain (E.coli K12 HO830), expressing FhuA the results of viscometric investigation show that under direct interaction of phages with FhuA the receptor activity of protein revealed only for T5 phage. Therefore, we conclude that other than FhuA protein serves as receptor for IRA phage. It should be mentioned that the phage DNA ejection process induced by receptor was observed for the rst time by us in an incessant regime. Electron spray ionization mass spectroscopy (ESI-MS) is a powerful tool for the investigation of the protein folding or proteins non-covalent interactions in solution since charge state distributions (CSDs) in ESI-MS are affected by the conformational state and mass relates on the association state. We used this tecnique to inquire at different pH and different conditions the dimerization process of the porcine and bovine -lactoglobulins that share a high sequences similarity and close 3D structures. Dimerization oflactoglobulins is reversible and involves both electrostatic and hydrophobic interactions. It was possible to detect simultaneously both the monomeric and dimeric form of the proteins in solution, pointing out the different dimerization behaviour of the two isoforms. We assessed the maximal stability of the dimeric structure at pH 4 for the porcine protein and pH 6 for the bovine one. Moreover we showed that bovine lactoglobulin has a stronger dissociation costant than the porcine protein.

The detailed characterization of conformational states of 1-79 and 1-110 residues SNase fragments (SNase79 and SNase110) and their V66W and G88W mutants can provide valuable information on the development of conformations in the folding of SNase fragments of increasing chain lengths in vitro.

The uctuating nascent helix-and \u00e2sheet-like structures, localized in regions of A58-A69 and T13-V39, respectively are transiently populated in SNase79. The native-like tertiary conformations are obtained for G88W110 and V66W110 and for SNase110 in the presence of 2.0 M TMAO. Analysis of the results of such studies indicate that folding of SNase fragments is dominated by developing the local and non-local nucleation sites from native-like secondary structures and by intensifying the longrange interactions of residues at nucleation sites with residues further removed in sequence.",

Geiger 2 1 International Max-Planck Research School in Chemical Biology, Otto-Hahn str. 11, D-44227, Germany, 2 Physical Chemistry, University of Dortmund, Otto-Hahn str. 6, D-44227, Germany Hydration water strongly in uences the structural and dynamical properties of biomolecules. The existence of a spanning hydrogenbonded network formed by the hydration water enables the function of biomolecules at low hydration levels. We can expect that the formation/disruption of the spanning network formed by the hydration water in solution also affects crucially the protein properties. We present the rst computer simulation study of the thermal disruption of a spanning network formed by the hydration water of a biomolecule (elastin-like peptide). This process obeys the laws of 2D percolation transition, similarly to the formation of a spanning water network with increasing hydration level [1]. The spanning water network transforms into an ensemble of small water clusters with increasing temperature: it is still permanent at 280 K and exists with probability 50% at 320 K. In the same temperature interval, the conformation of the peptide changes noticeably: its radius of gyration increases sharply (by 15%) at about 295 K. These two phenomena may be related to the \"inverse temperature transition\" at about 310 K, where an elastin solution separates into two phases. In our simulations, the displacement of hydration water by the addition of a denaturant (urea) or by other peptide molecules causes an even stronger increase of the radius of gyration (up to 25% Lipidic cubic phases formed by distinct water and lipid volumes provide bicontinuous 3D bilayer matrices that have speci c and controllable water channel sizes and large surface areas. These systems have proven to be also valuable as membrane mimetic structures, as promising matrices for controlled-release and delivery of proteins, vitamins and small drugs in pharmacological applications, and they offer a 3D lipid matrix for successful crystallization of membrane proteins which do not easily crystallize in bulk solution. The present study is directed towards a better understanding of the interplay between curved cubic lipid phases and the protein entrapped within their aqueous channel structures. As model systems, we have chosen a cubic Ia3d phase formed by an uncharged lipid, monoolein, and incorporated different proteins, such as cytochrome c, -chymotrypsin and insulin, in its narrow water channels. We show that the protein secondary structure and unfolding behaviour may be in uenced by the con nement and, vice versa, the topology of the lipid matrix may change as a function of protein size and concentration. In fact, even new cubic lipid structures may be formed that are not known in pure lipid systems. Furthermore, we compare the aggregation scenario of insulin in bulk solution and in the narrow water channels of the cubic lipid matrix and discuss the differences found in terms of the geometrical limitations imposed by the con nement. After endocytosis, i.e. at acidic pH, the T domain inserts in the membrane of the target cell and helps the translocation of the catalytic domain into the cytoplasm. Therefore, the T domain has a key role in the strategy of internalization of the toxin. The study of the interaction of the T domain with membranes and its pH dependence is important for a better understanding of the diphtheria toxin translocation mechanism. At least, two steps can be distinguished during the membrane insertion of the T domain. The rst step involves hydrophobic interactions with the membrane and is related to the pH-induced stabilization in a molten-globule state. In the second step, electrostatic interactions are preponderant and the pH-sensitivity comes from changes of the balance between repulsive and attractive electrostatic interactions. The role of the N-terminal part of the T domain in the second step has been investigated by studying peptides corresponding to the amphiphilic helices found in this part of the domain. The results are correlated with those obtained with a single Trp mutant probing the N-Terminal region of the whole domain. The translocation mechanism will be discussed in view of the physico-chemical properties of the peptides.",

To get better insight into the molecular mechanisms of PrPc/PrPsc conversion, we studied the kinetic pathway of heat induced amyloidogenesis of the full length recombinant ovine PrP (ARQ) at pH 4.0. According to the size exclusion chromatography experiments, three sets of oligomers were generated from the partial unfolding of the monomer. The effect of concentration on the oligomerization kinetics was different for the three species obsreved suggesting that they are generated from distinct kinetic pathways. Limited proteolysis and peptide analysis of the two best separated peaks showed a difference in the accessibility of the C-terminal domain of these two oligomers, and allowed the identi cation of regions undergoing a structural change during the conversion process. The analysis of correlations between oligomer populations as well as numerical kinetic modeling led us to propose a multi-step kinetic pathway describing the evolution of each species as a function of time.",

Studying the mechanism of retention of ovine prion protein in soils will tackle the environmental aspect of potential dissemination of scrapie infectious agent. The conformational transition from the monomeric cellular prion protein PrP C in -helical structure into the aggregated -sheet-rich multimer PrP SC is supposed to be responsible for the so-called prion diseases. It is commonly admitted that the recombinant PrP could serve as model of conversion of the normal prion protein PrP C . Fundamentally, the interaction of proteins with surfaces either uid or solid involves both protein binding and unfolding. Our goal in studying protein adsorption is to determine the nature and the amplitude of the structural changes occurring during non-speci c adsorption. The protein-clay interaction depends on several parameters such as protein hydration, net charge, charge distribution on the protein surface. FTIR spectroscopy is well-suited to probe structural changes of proteins at a molecular level at aqueous/solid interfaces. The conformational states of the full-length ovine PrP adsorbed on the electronegative clay surface are compared to its solvated state in deuterated buffer in the pD range 3.5-9, using FTIR spectroscopy. During the intoxication of a cell, the diphtheria toxin binds to a cell surface receptor, is internalized and reaches the endosome. The translocation (T) domain from the toxin interacts with the membrane of the endosome in response to the acidic pH found in this compartment. This process drives then the passage of the catalytic domain of the toxin through the membrane into the cytoplasm. The interaction of the T domain with the membrane involves at least two steps. In the rst step occurring at pH 6, T adopts a molten globule conformation, which is able to bind super cially to the membrane through hydrophobic interactions by the C-terminal region (helices TH8 and TH9). In a second step occurring between pH 6 and 4, penetration into the membrane involves electrostatic interactions. This step leads to a functional inserted state. Trp 281 was mutated to Phe in order to use Trp 206 located in helix TH1 as a probe of its behavior during the interaction with the membrane as a function of pH. We found that the second step is correlated with the reorganization of the N terminal region in the membrane and is controlled by electrostatic interactions.",

We have applied this method for peptide conformational search and as a complement for Comparative Modeling of proteins, searching the conformation for loops and mismatched sequence alignments.

Optical absorption spectra of HbGp 0.075 mg/ml as a function of CTAC concentration from 0 up to 10.5 mM evidentiate changes both in Soret band at 414 nm, and at 490 nm associated to light scattering which appears at low CTAC concentration.

Light scattering reaches a maximum value disappearing for higher CTAC concentrations. Fluorescence spectra show a signi cant increase in intensity (30fold) upon titration with CTAC.

In modern applications silk proteins are chosen because of their good tensile strength, their high biocompatibility as well as of the resorbability for the human body. However, the processing of silk by the silkworm is barely understood. The silk proteins are stored as a solution in the glands of the silkworm and processed during the spinning into a co-block polymer like ber. In a rst step the random coil silk proteins are transformed into molecules with beta-sheet subdomains, which provide a protein-protein interface for the ber assembly. This transformation can be mimicked by a rheometer applying a shear force to the silk protein solution. Applying combined small/wide angle X-ray scattering (SAXS/WAXS) transient formed silk nanoparticles upon increasing shear force were found. Further details of these macromolecules were derived by xing the transient state with chemicals such as polyethylene oxide (PEO). The resulting data can be analyzed in detail by SAXS data evaluation software and low resolution models of the found nanoparticles were derived.

Two subdomains are topologically noticeable, but it is unclear whether their folding occurs in a concerted fashion. Subdomain TRX1-73 has been extensively studied as a model of a partially folded, with no tertiary or persistent secondary structure. This work describes the expression and characterization -by circular dichroism (CD), uorescence emission, size exclusion chromatography, chemical cross-linking and light scattering-of a novel engineered fragment (TRX1-93) lacking the last stretch of 15 amino acids. After refolding from inclusion bodies, TRX1-93 shows a strong propensity to form soluble oligomers endowed with distinctive optical properties unlike those observed for the full protein. Although TRX1-93 also shows signi cant changes in secondary structure, Trp residues appear to occupy rigid and apolar environments. These ndings support the existence of an alternatively folded form for TRX1-93. In addition, the secondary structure content of chemically synthesized peptide TRX94-108 and its ability to complement fragment TRX 1-93 upon refolding were also evaluated by CD.

Denaturation was induced by guanidine hydrochloride, renaturation was initiated by dilution and followed by activity measurements and uorimetry. Reactivation is a complex process with an initial lag phase, indicating the presence of an inactive intermediate. The kinetics of the process is independent of protein concentration, suggesting that association of the two polypeptide chains takes place much faster than the rate limiting rst order isomerisation step(s). Restoration of protein uorescence during renaturation is also protein concentration independent, biphasic process, however the initial lag phase is replaced by an even faster burst increase of uorescence. The rst step leads to formation of an intermediate with a native-like uorescence spectrum. Based on our experiments the following mechanism is proposed for refolding of IPMDH: D+D I 2 I 2 N 2 , where D is denaturated monomer, I 2 and I 2 are inactive dimer intermediates, N 2 is native dimer, that means initial association of the polypeptide chains during refolding is a prerequisite for formation of the native 3 dimensional structure of IPMDH.

According to the thermodynamic hypothesis, the native conformation of a protein can be predicted as the global optimum of its free energy surface with stochastic optimization methods orders of magnitude faster than by direct simulation of the folding process. We have recently developed an all-atom free energy force eld (PFF01) which implements a minimal thermodynamic model based on physical interactions and an implict solvent model. We demonstrated that PFF01 stabilizes the native conformation of several helical proteins as the global optimum of its free energy surface. In addition we were able to reproducibly fold several helical proteins (the 20 amino acid (AA) trp-cage protein, the villin headpiece (36 AA), the conserved headpiece of the HIV accessory protein (40 AA), the headpiece of protein A (40 AA) and the 4-helix bacterial ribolsomal protein L20 (60 AA), as well as several beta-sheet peptides. We used several stochastic optimization methods: the stochastic tunneling method, an adapted version of parallel tempering, basin hopping techniques and distributed evolutionary optimization strategies. We discuss advantages and limitations of this approach to de-novo allatom protein structure prediction. The 9 independent thermal unfolding simulations of GB1 have been performed. 12 physical property parameters of protein structure were chosen to construct a 12-dimension physical property space. Then the 12-dimension property space was reduced to 3dimensions principle component property space. Under the property space, the unfolding pathway ensemble of GB1 was obtained. The pathway ensemble likes a funnel that was gradually emanative from the native state ensemble to the unfolded state ensemble. The unfolding trajectories have the similar variable trend during the native state and the transition state ensemble. During the unfolded state, the 9 unfolding trajectohries were divided into two types that one includes only one trajectory and the other include 8 trajectories. The rst type of unfolded state was a discontinuity step distribution model, which is not random distribution. The second type of unfolded state was a near ellipsoid distribution model and a near random. There were substantial overlaps of unfolded state, indicating that thermal unfolded state consists of a con ned set of property values that makes the number of unfolded state of protein to be much smaller than that was believed before.",

Its aim is to provide a resource for the biological and bioinformatics communities, by providing open access and archiving facilities for circular dichroism spectra. It is named by parallel with the Protein Data Bank (PDB), a long-existing valuable reference data bank for protein crystal structures. It will permits spectral deposition via userfriendly web forms and will include automatic reading of a range of data formats and data mining from le headers to facilitate the process. It will be linked, in the case of proteins whose crystal structures and sequences are known, to the appropriate PDB and sequence data band les, respectively. A series of validation tools that will provide reports on data quality are included (and are accessible as stand-alone software). It is anticipated that this data bank will provide readily-accessible biophysical catalogue of information on folded proteins that may be of value in structural genomics programs, for quality assurance and archiving in industrial and academic labs, as a resource for programs developing spectroscopic structural analysis methods, and in bioinformatics studies.",

Ferritin, the ubiquitous iron storage protein, represents a well known polymeric assembly that is highly resistant to chemical and physical denaturants. It is a cage-shaped protein which is composed of 24 subunits. Natural vertebrate ferritins are copolymers of two different subunits, L-and H-chains. In the recombinant H-chain apoferritin (rHF), the structural stability is decreased by deletion of the N-terminal residues. We studied the effect of N-terminal residues of recombinant L-chain apoferritin (rLF) on the acidic pH denaturation and re-assembly. We constructed rLF and mutant rLFs which are lack of 4 (Fer4) or 8 (Fer8) amino acid residues from the N-terminus and investigated their stability by CD spectra. Among three, Fer8 has the least endurance against pH decrease. In the case of Fer8, the re-assembly of subunits into apoferritin can be performed by increasing solution pH without causing the by-product while huge aggregations are caused in Fer0 and Fer4. The structural comparison of three mutants indicates that the hydrogen bonds of inter-and intra-subunits decrease by the loss of the N-terminal residues. Therefore, it is elucidated that the hydrogen bonds of inter-and intra-subunits from N-terminal residues affect the molecule stability and re-assembly of L-chain apoferritin.",

In PPC, the coef cient of thermal expansion of the partial speci c volume of the protein is deduced from the heat consumed or produced after small isothermal pressure jumps, which strongly depends on the interaction of the protein with the solvent or cosolvent at the protein-solvent interface. The effects of pH and various chaotropic and kosmotropic cosolvents (glycerol, sucrose, urea, GuHCl, salts, etc.) on the solvation and unfolding behavior of the proteins was also investigated, and the observed volume and expansivity changes are correlated with further thermodynamic and spectroscopic properties of the systems. Depending on the type of cosolvent and its concentration, speci c differences are found for the solvation properties of the proteins, and the volume change upon unfolding may even change sign. Taken together, the data obtained lead to a deeper understanding of the solvation process of proteins in different cosolvents in their native and unfolded states. In addition, the effects of con nement and crowding on the solvational properties of the proteins were studied.

It is proposed that substrates bind to it within the membrane and are exported from there out of the cell. P-gp substrates are generally hydrophobic and their binding to the transporter is governed by their ability to partition into the membrane. The intimate association of both P-gp and its substrates with the membrane suggests that P-gp function may be regulated by the composition of the lipid bilayer. As detergents in uence the membrane properties and have been shown to affect P-gp ATPase activity, we developed virtually detergent-free proteoliposomes to investigate the in uence of the membrane environment on the ATPase activity of P-gp. The basal and substrate induced ATPase activity was dependent on the cholesterol level of egg phosphatidylcholine (PC) membranes. The compound concentration at half maximal activation of P-gp (K M ) in proteoliposomes correlated with the af nity of the respective compound to liposomes consisting of the same lipids as the proteoliposomes tested.

We have synthesized a spin labeled unsymmetrical bolaamphiphile that selforganises in water solutions in multilamellar vesicles and shows slow ip-op phenomenon in comparison to conventional liposomes. Generally, the ip-op from the exovesicular to the endovesicular membrane surface is a relatively slow process, which is due to the high energy barrier in transferring the polar amphiphilic heads through the lipophilic membrane. It can be involved in membrane transport mechanisms and in facilitating the transport, cells have evolved to use various supramolecular strategies. The half-life of the ip-op is estimated to more than twelve hours.

It is known that CA can bind to several membrane transporters, forming a transport metabolon and thereby enhancing the transport activity of the protein. In this project we have studied the functional interaction of the enzyme with the monocarboxylate transporter 1 (MCT1), which transports lactate and other monocarboxylates together with protons and is believed to play a pivotal role in the metabolite shuttling between astrocytes and neurons. Therefore we expressed MCT1 and then injected CA into Xenopus oocytes. Our results indicate a direct binding of CA to the MCT1, leading to a CA-induced increase in acid/base ux mediated by the transporter. Interestingly, the effect was insensitive to the CA inhibitor ethoxyzolamide and to the nominal absence of CO 2 /HCO 3 , but disappeared when binding of CA to the MCT1 was hindered. It seems, that CA, bound to the MCT1, mediates local buffer capacity by removing protons transported into the cell via the MCT1. This helps to stabilise the proton gradient close to the cell membrane, and thereby enhances the transport activity of the MCT1. These ndings suggest that CA can enhance metabolite-acid/base transport, by forming a transport metabolon with the MCT1.

The SSM technique combines a rapid solution exchange with the high sensitivity of planar lipid membranes. It employs a solid supported membrane as a capacitive electrode and allows the time resolved investigation of charge translocation during the catalytic cycle of such transporters as Na /solute symporters. In order to obtain some more precise information about the function of Mel B symporter, starting from the C-less MelB, the mutant G117C was constructed and from electrical, spectro uorimetric and FRET measurements carried out on this mutant, in the absence and in the presence of speci c inhibitors, conclusions were drawn about the possible role of the helix IV in the function of the symporter.",

Defects in the regulation of Ca 2 -ATPase by PLB and SLN are central determinants in cardiac contractility and disease states such as cardiomyopathy. Given the signi cance of these proteins, the structural details of their regulatory mechanisms remain an important future goal for the clinical improvement of heart disease.

In addition, these same co-reconstituted proteoliposomes have been used for structural studies by electron cryo-microscopy. In an attempt to better de ne the structural interactions between PLB, SLN and Ca 2 -ATPase, we have sought methods for the production of large two-dimensional crystals suitable for high resolution electron crystallography.

We tested this hypothesis by heterologously coexpressing electrogenic NBCe1 from human kidney in oocytes of the frog Xenopus laevis with the electroneutral rat monocarboxylate transporter MCT1. The apparent intracellular buffer capacity was increased by NBCe1 expression and became voltage-dependent by 7 mM/10 mV membrane depolarisation. Lactate transport via the MCT1 not only became enhanced after co-expression with NBCe1, but also dependent upon membrane potential. Injection of carbonic anhydrase CAII from bovine erythrocytes into oocytes enhanced the ef cacy of NBCe1 activity, identifying an additional, CA-sensitive, membrane current via NBCe1. Our results show that NBCe1 adds voltage-dependent buffer capacity to the cytosol; this is suggested to be the prime cause for enhancing acid/base-coupled transport and conferring membrane potential dependence on transporters which are stoichiometrically electroneutral. These interactions may have functional consequences for cells and tissues, where electrogenic and electroneutral processes interact, such as in brain, heart and muscle. . By using carboxy-SNARF-1 as pH-sensitive uoroprobe and microspectro uorimetry, we now show that NHE1 activation is due to Jun kinase (JNK) activation, resulting from reactive oxygen species (ROS) produced during metabolism of B(a)P and might involve lipid raft. When analysing B(a)P-induced apoptosis, we have found that cariporide signi cantly reduces both nuclear fragmentation and caspase-3 like activity. We further show that NHE1 activation and/or alkalinization affects the mitochondrial ROS production detected during the apoptotic cascade, likely via an effect on the complex III of the electron transport chain. Altogether, our results suggest that apoptotic xenobiotics, such as benzo[a]pyrene, induce an early activation of NHE1 that might play a signi cant role in the subsequent mitochondria-dependent apoptosis.",

Their biomedical relevance is highlighted in examples such as multidrug resistance to antibacterial and anticancer agents, and cystic brosis. The availability of crystal structures of three complete bacterial ABC transporters provides an opportunity to study structurefunction relationships at the atomic level. In this work, we carry out multi-nanosecond Molecular Dynamics simulations of the Vitamin B 12 importer from E. coli (BtuCD), with both the complete multimeric transporter embedded in a phospholipid bilayer and the soluble subunits in a membrane-free environment, in an attempt to elucidate some of the conformational changes which arise during the transport event. ATP-bound and ATP-free structures are used to investigate the effect of nucleotide on the system. A range of analytical techniques have been applied to assess the dynamic behaviour of the protein during the simulations, which includes measurements of: conformational drift, residue exibility, transmembrane domain (TMD) movement, concerted protein motions, nucleotide-binding and translocation pathway changes. An in-vitro method was designed to measure transmembrane transport rates. Liposomes were prepared by extrusion with dipalmitoyl phosphatidylcholine (DPPC) and optionally cholesterol, and loaded with a peptide (zinc-insulin tagged with a uorescent group or BSA). After removal of the non-encapsulated peptide from the liposome solution by gel ltration, the release of the peptide from the liposomes was monitored by uorescence as a function of time at various temperatures. The transport was greatly accelerated by the presence of a speci c proprietary excipient molecule (cyclopentadecanolide -CPE215\u2122), which effectively triggered the release of the peptide. A mathematical model was developed to quantify these results. A semi-empirical nonlinear equation involving four parameters ts the protein release pro les. Then a neural network predictions model was used to correlate the different release condition parameters and the four semi-empirical tting parameters based on the experimental data sets. Most release data t well with the mathematical model, further supporting our theory of a two step release mechanism.",

This Ca 2 leak from the ER was not sensitive to Tg, heparin and ruthenium red and therefore appears to be independent of the SERCA, the InsP 3 receptor and the ryanodine receptors. However, treatment with puromycin (0.1-1 mM) to remove nascent polypeptides from ER-ribosome translocon pores increased Ca 2 leak from the ER by a mechanism independent of the SERCA, InsP 3 or ryanodine receptors.

The liposomes and polymersomes were formed, using elcetroformation method, from phospholipids and amphiphilic diblock copolymers, respectively. The polymer tubes were made extremely robust by cross-linking them using chemical reactions. We are currently studying the transport of molecules in the crosslinked nanotubes for use in nano uidic networks. P-glycoprotein (P-gp) is an active membrane transporter capable of expelling out of the cell a large number of potentially cytotoxic amphiphilic molecules with unrelated chemical structures. As a consequence, P-gp may be responsible for multidrug resistance of tumors against chemotherapy (MDR); it also plays a key role in absorption, biodisposition and elimination of many pharmaceuticals. To understand the molecular mechanisms of the transmembrane drug transport mediated by Pgp, it is highly desirable to design a convenient assay for measuring both P-gp ATPase activity and P-gp transport function. To do so, we used inside-out native membrane vesicles, prepared from MDR cells and containing high amounts of P-gp. We took advantage of the speci c property of a uorescent dye, the carbocyanin JC-1, known to be expelled out of MDR cells: above a critical concentration (the \"CJC\"), this dye forms J-aggregates which emit a uorescence at a wavelength very different from that emitted by the monomer. In the presence of MgATP, the P-gp-containing vesicles accumulated JC-1, which exceeded locally the CJC and thus formed intraluminal J-aggregates; these aggregates allowed accumulated JC-1 both to be sequestered inside the vesicles, by dramatically slowing down its passive backdiffusion, and to be speci cally detected. Kinetic characterization of this transport suggests that JC-1 is rst translocated to the exoplasmic lea et of the vesicle membrane before its internalization into the aqueous phase of the vesicle lumen.",

However, only a few data about the possible mechanisms of electrosensitivity of biological cells are available. Since electrostimulation always induces depolarization of biomembranes, an impact of the energy metabolism is obvious due to the regeneration of electrochemical gradients by the expenditure of cellular energy. Our aim is to investigate the interactions between externally applied electric elds and the aerobic/anaerobic energy metabolism of yeast cells. For this, we have constructed a new electrical interface for local stimulation of biological cells with variable duration and amplitude. When applying short lasting electrical pulses to yeast cells, we nd a direct response of the energy metabolism (measured by NADH-uorescence) to these pulses. A sudden and fast decrease in NADH is followed by a slower recovery of the uorescence signal. These NADH-signals are abolished in the presence of Antimycin A or KCN, demonstrating the importance of mitochondrial energy production for this phenomenon. We attribute these changes to the immediate break down of ATP as a consequence of the regeneration of the membrane potential (ATPases) and the slower regeneration of ATP by mitochondrial respiration.",

Flonta 1 1 Department of Animal Physiology and Biophysics, Faculty of Biology, University of Bucharest, 2 Department of Biochemistry, Faculty of Biology, University of Bucharest, Bucharest, Romania Hypericin (Hyp) is one of the active compounds from Hypericum perforatum (an herb usually prescribed as antidepressant). The bioavailability of this hydrophobic molecule is a very important issue for medical applications. The goal of our work was the study of Hyp blood transport mechanisms. Techniques of absorbtion spectroscopy, electrophoresis and uorescence microscopy were used in order to de ne the properties of Hyp-albumin and Hyp-lipoproteins complexes and to explain the action of Hyp at the plasma membrane level. Hyp bind to several electrophoretic (SDS-PAGE) bands evidenced by mice plasma migration. Both albumin and lipoproteins bind to Hyp, forming complexes, during the blood transport process. Different types of lipoproteins from males and females plasma mice were evidenced by gradient electrophoresis to bind Hyp. Hyp-albumin complex was also identi ed by absorbtion spectra, and the ratio A 594 /A 550 has a pH-dependence. Hyp interaction with plasma membranes was also examined on cell culture by uorescence microscopy, and Hyp plasma incorporation is a dose-and incubating time-dependent process. Our results partially elucidate the plasma fractions that bind Hyp, contributing to its blood transport. This study proposes a new mechanism of Hyp cellular insertion, discussing its plasmatic membrane penetration due to its high hydrophobicity. The overexpression of P-glyoprotein (P-gp) is one of the major causes of multidrug resistance (MDR) in cancer chemotherapies. Many P-gp inhibitors have been designed to reverse the MDR effect, but the structure-activity relationships of the P-gp inhibitors and substrates still remain largely unknown. Until now, it is still very challenging to obtain the high-resolution P-gp structures and currently only low-resolution electron microscopy structure is available. This has caused the structure-based design of \"P-gp-ignoring\" therapeutic agents a remote goal. However, the recent determination of X-ray crystal structures of bacterial lipid A transporter, MsbA, has provided eligible structure templates for homology modeling of P-gp. We have therefore conducted explicit solvent molecular dynamics simulations of the fulllength ef ux pump, human P-gp, in an excessively hydrated POPC bilayer to re ne the homology model. Both free and ATP-bound forms of P-gp have been simulated. The entire system consists of more than 365,000 atoms. Our molecular dynamics simulations have shown that the overall architecture of P-gp remained very stable for tens of nanoseconds, while the observed membrane undulation was rather large. The simulation results have allowed us to investigate the conformational changes of P-gp upon ATP binding in the ef ux process and to predict the possible binding site of various known substrates and inhibitors. The re ned structure models of P-gp by our simulations could be used as the basis for further drug design. Electroporation (EP) is a phenomenon where increased permeability of cells exposed to an external electric eld is observed. The induced transmembrane voltage presumably leads to the formation of aqueous pores in the phospholipid bilayer, which increases permeability of the membrane for molecules and ions. EP is currently used in many biomedical applications including transfer of genes and electrochemotherapy of tumors. Still, the molecular mechanisms of the process are not fully explained. Recently it was proposed that EP could be monitored in real-time by measuring electric conductivity of tissue. So far the studies focused mostly on a single pulse, however in biomedical applications usually several pulses are used. In our study we used a train of electric pulses to analyse the relationship between electric conductivity and cell permeabilization. Current-voltage measurements during and after pulse application were performed in dense suspension of cells. Conductivity changes were analysed numerically using nite elements method and compared with the percentage of permeabilized cells. We obtained a transient increase in conductivity above a certain voltage with complete relaxation in < 1s. Substantial changes in conductivity are also due to the diffusion of ions through membrane pores and osmotic swelling. We further show that relation between conductivity and permeabilization level is indirect.",

Electrophysiological techniques have proved to be extremely useful tools to investigate the mechanism of ion transfer across the membrane by ion-coupled transporters. Using a solid supported membrane (SSM) as a capacitive electrode a rapid solution exchange can be combined with the high sensitivity of planar lipid membranes and allows time resolved investigation of the charge translocation during the catalytic cycle of Na+/solute symporters. This technique has been combined with uorescence measurements, which report on structural changes during the substrate transport process of the carrier. We have used time resolved tryptophane uorescence, uorescence energy transfer with a uorescent sugar substrate and site speci c uorescence of a label attached to a cysteine residue on the protein. This allowed us to identify conformational transitions during the reaction cycle of the melibiose permease. We could assess their electrogenicity and determine rate constants. A kinetic model for Na+ and melibiose binding and transport is presented. Electrophysiological characterization of the vast number of annotated channel and transport proteins in the postgenomic era would be greatly facilitated by the introduction of rapid and robust methods for the functional incorporation of membrane proteins into dened lipid bilayers. We present an automated method for reconstitution of membrane proteins into lipid bilayer membranes, that substantially reduces both the reconstitution time and the amount of protein required. We have applied this well-de ned system to the characterization of a novel mitochondrial uncoupling protein, UCP2 and demonstrated that UCP2 exhibits protonophoric function exclusively in the presence of fatty acids, similar to that previously shown for its homologue UCP1. The membrane conductance was proportional to the concentration of the reconstituted UCP2 in presence of oleic acid or eicosatrienoic acid, and was inhibited by ATP. Amphipols are amphipathic polymers designed to replace or supplement detergents in membrane protein solution studies. For the study of the Ca 2 -ATPase from sarcoplasmic reticulum, previous experiments have revealed both advantages and disadvantages to the use of a polyacrylate-based amphipol, A8-35. These issues have been reinvestigated using four different amphipols. Size exclusion chromatography showed that, although A8-35 aggregates in the presence of millimolar concentrations of calcium -an effect that probably accounts for most of the aggregation of ATPase/A8-35 complexes observed in our previous work-, aggregation can be avoided by resorting to a sulfonated version of A8-35. We also found that all amphipols tested slowed down the rate of calcium dissociation from its binding sites and reduced ATPase activity, while protecting the solubilized protein against denaturation. This suggests that association with the polymer may damp the protein's dynamics, perhaps due to the multipoint attachment of the polymer to its hydrophobic transmembrane surface. Such a \"Gulliver\" effect could contribute both to the protection of membrane proteins against denaturation and to the reversible inhibition of SERCA1a. CLC proteins are found from prokaryotes to mammals. They function as plasma membrane chloride channels or provide neutralizing anion currents for V-type H -ATPases that acidify compartments of the endosomal/lysosomal pathway. Vesicular CLCs have been thought to be Cl -channels, in particular because ClC-4 and ClC-5 mediate plasma membrane Cl -currents upon heterologous expression. We have shown, however, that these two mainly endosomal CLC proteins rather function as electrogenic Cl /H exchangers, resembling the transport activity of the bacterial ClC-e1 that has been crystallized. Neutralization of a critical glutamate residue not only abolished the steep voltage-dependence of transport, but also eliminated the coupling of anion ux to proton counter-transport. ClC-4 and ClC-5 may still compensate the charge accumulation by endosomal proton pumps, but are expected to tightly couple vesicular pH-gradients to Cl -gradients.",

Individual compounds differed in the length of substituted alkyl chain. The primary goal was to nd if they can be used as effective antioxidants and, to what degree they modify used model (liposomes) and biological (erythrocytes, algae and cucumber) membranes. Various methods were used in order to do that. A mechanism of the interaction between NTA and membranes was studied by measuring their potency to hemolyse erythrocytes, to in uence a phase transition temperature in DPPC liposomes, to change a membrane potential of algae cells. The measure of the interaction of NTA with cucumber cells were potassium leakage, chlorophyll content and inhibition of growth of hypocotyls. Antioxidative abilities of NTA were determined by measuring their ef ciency to protect erythrocytes against membrane lipid oxidation induced by UV irradiation and by comparising their antioxidative ef ciencies with that of Trolox (vitamin E analogue) in chromogen experiments. The mostly widely employed mechanism of drug extrusion in bacteria is via membrane transport proteins called ef ux pumps. In Gram-negative bacteria, multidrug resistance is conferred by tripartite complexes, rather than by a single transport protein. Through these systems, a wide range of substrates is expelled from the cytoplasm, through the periplasmic region, to the exterior of the cell. Among these complexes, the AcrAB/TolC system in Escherichia coli is formed by an Inner Membrane ef ux pump, AcrB, an Outer Membrane protein, TolC, and a periplasmic protein known as an adaptor, AcrA. The components of this complex are studied, in order to provide insights into drug transport in bacteria. Here we present a dynamics study on MexA, homologue of AcrA from Pseudomonas aeruginosa. The protein has been studied by Molecular Dynamics simulations in bulk water. A structural adjustment by the periplasmic protein is required in order to engage both the bottom part of the OM protein and the top region of IM protein. The dynamics on MexA reveals a exible behaviour of the protein in water. The major concerted motions observed are the hinge-bending of the two domains, and the rotation of the -barrel domain. These can be related to the adaptation of MexA (and AcrA) to the OM and IM proteins during the process of assembly in forming the complex, and during the opening of the channels.",

Protochlorophyllide oxidoreductase (POR) catalyzes the reduction of protochlorophyllide (PChlide) into chlorophyllide (Chlide), a key step in chlorophyll biosynthesis. POR is one of the two enzymes known to require light for catalysis.

Upon warming, several uorescent intermediates develop, and at 290K Chlide is released. When illuminated at temperatures below 155K, POR behaves differently. If gentle light is used, the reaction can not start. Instead, if a blue laser source is used, the initial complex disappears, like at 165K. However, upon warming, a new intermediate develops that uoresces at 694nm and leads to a dead-end product. By using uorescence microspectrophotometry, we have measured the solvent glass transition temperature of the system to be 158K. The solvent glass transition, possibly controlling a POR dynamical transition, may be the determinant that switches the enzyme reaction pathway from a non productive to a productive one. The nonproductive pathway results from a two-photons absorption mechanism, whereas the productive pathway is a one-photon mechanism. Sensory rhodopsin II from N. pharaonis (NpSRII) forms a complex with its cognate transducer NpHtrII in a 2:2 stoichiometry 1 . Light activation of NpSRII leads to a movement of helix F which triggers a rotation of TM2 in NpHtrII 2 3 . The mechanism of signal transduction through the HAMP region to the cytoplasmic domain of the transducer is still unknown. Structural information exists for the transmembrane and cytoplasmic regions, however the HAMP domain is not yet characterized. In order to obtain structural information on this domain, twenty-four residues in the membrane adjacent region (78-101), and six residues in the following region were spin labeled and investigated by cw and pulsed X-band EPR. To analyze the overall architecture of the complex, doubly spin labeled variants between the transducer and the receptor were also engineered. Depending on their function, the absorption spectra of rhodopsins can be tuned by the protein over a wide range. A major determinant for spectral shifts between different rhodopsins are electrostatic interactions between the chromophore retinal and the protein. We compute and compare the classical electrostatic potential at the retinal of three archaeal rhodopsins: bacteriorhodopsin (BR), halorhodopsin (HR), and sensory rhodopsin II (SRII). These proteins are an excellent test case for understanding the spectral tuning of retinal. The absorption maxima of BR and HR are very similar, while the spectrum of SRII is considerably blue shifted. We nd that the electrostatic potential is similar in BR and HR, but differs signi cantly in SRII. A quantum mechanical model of a particle in a box with a step potential can qualitatively relate the differences between the electrostatic potentials of the proteins to the relative shifts of their absorption maxima. By decomposing the electrostatic potential into contributions of individual residues, we could identify six residues that are responsible for the differences in electrostatic potential between the proteins. Three of these residues are close to the retinal, while the other three residues are more then 8 Angstroem away from the retinal. The counterion of the Schiff base, which is frequently discussed to be involved in the spectral tuning, does not contribute to the dissimilarities between the electrostatic potentials.",

The membranes have different pigment composition, stoichiometry and organization of pigment-protein complexes. The aim of our work was to nd out whether UV-A induced damage is affected by the altered content and/or oligomerization of the main light-harvesting chlorophyllprotein complex (LHCII) in thylakoid membranes. The data for the effect of UV-A radiation on the oxygen evolution demonstrate that: (i) the inhibition of photosystem II (PSII)-mediated electron transport and ash-induced oxygen yields strongly depend on the amount of LHCII; (ii) the increase of the S o populations of PSII centers in darkness is more pronounced in thylakoid membranes with smaller amount of LHCII; (iii) the inhibition of the oxygen evolution is related to the reduced number of the functionally active PSII centres; (iv) the degree of impairing of active PSII centres depend on the amount and oligomerization of LHCII. The results also show that the altered content and organization of LHCII in uence the UV-A light-induced changes in the energy transfer between PSII and PSI and within the supramolecular LHCII-PSII complex. The effects of UV-A radiation on leaves and isolated thylakoid membranes are compared. Sudden polarisation -a large change in the electric dipole moment between the excited and the ground state -is a well-known phenomenon for retinal chromophore. Some early models of the energy transduction mechanism in bacteriorhodopsin (BR) even attribute a primary functional role of that. However, it was apparently unrecognized that the Maxwell theory intuitively predicts the appearance of an ultrafast transient electromagnetic radiation due to this dipole moment change. Here we show that the existence of this type of radiation can be derived from semiclassical quantum electrodynamics as a second order phenomenon. In optical terms it corresponds to the previously unstudied resonant case of optical recti cation. Recently we experimentally observed a major component in the fs coherent infrared emission of oriented purple membranes of BR corresponding well to this effect (Groma et. al, Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. 101, 7971, 2004). Our theory predicts that such a signal holds detailed information on the dynamics of excited state polarization, opening a new branch of impulsive spectroscopy on asymmetric systems. Beyond optical recti cation we found a complex phase a coherent oscillation living for a few ps, i.e. much longer than the excited state of BR. Fitting analysis resulted in at least seven vibrating modes in the 700-1500 cm 1 region, while windowed Fourier transform indicated time-dependent frequency distribution.",

Experimental studies with RC's reconstituted in lipid vesicles have shown different values of transmembrane voltage, depending on parameters like light intensity, RC concentration and membrane passive properties.

The three-dimensional distribution of the electrical potential near a single RC in the surface of a spherical vesicle was calculated.

The Xray diffraction measurement system, used in coupling with a pulsed YAG laser, enabled to record diffraction pattern from purple membrane lm at a time-resolution of 6 \u00b5sec over the time domain of 5 \u00b5sec to 500 msec. The low temperature (77K) chlorophyll uorescence, photochemical activity, oxygen ash yield and oxygen burst decay of thylakoid membranes with different organization of the light-harvesting chlorophyll a/b complex of photosystem II (LHCII) were investigated after freeze-thaw cycle in cryotoxic and cryoprotective medium. The increase of LHCII oligomerization, which is associate with signi cant reduction of the surface charge density of the thylakoid membrane, correlates with lower extent of freezing damage of the photosynthetic apparatus, when the procedure is carried out in a cryotoxic medium (NaCl). In the presence of a cryoprotective compound (sucrose) freezing damage is less pronounced and independent of the degree of the LHCII oligomerization. The mechanisms of damage and protection of photosynthetic apparatus during the freeze-thaw process are discussed. We have studied the effect of a cytokinin meta-topolin (MT, 10 4 M) on senescence-induced changes in the photosynthetic apparatus of detached primary leaves of wheat (Triticum aestivum L. cv. Hereward). The senescing leaves were kept under continuous light conditions. MT signi cantly slowed down the senescenceinduced decrease in chlorophyll content and markedly stimulated violaxanthin zeaxanthin (Z) conversion. The high Z content was maintained even after an hour in darkness. MT treatment caused also the appearance of an emission band F699 peaking at 698-700 nm. This emission band is attributed to aggregates of lightharvesting chlorophyll a/b-binding proteins (LHC), the production of which is associated with a higher Z content. The presence of LHC aggregates in MT treated leaves was documented also by electron microscopy imagines. Besides the LHC aggregation, MT induced also a decrease in photosystem I content which was documented by electrophoresis and 77K-uorescent spectra. Supported by grants FRVS 3190/2005 and MSM 6198959215. Recently high resolution images of bacterial photosynthetic membranes have revealed the organization of membrane proteins in these native membranes. The organization revealed is remarkable, and all the more so when we realize that these specialized, protein rich, membranes differentiate from the cytoplasmic membrane which has a more complex composition and is richer in lipids. Analysis of the protein organization in these specialized membranes from several different bacteria suggest that the organization results from a phase separation of several different contiguous phases. In order to better understand our observations we have undertaken an examination of the different phase behaviors that are possible for membrane proteins considered as a two dimensional colloid. Monte-Carlo modeling of the phase diagram of this system shows the importance of interaction distance in the determination of system behavior. Transcription of our observations on the model systems to the photosynthetic membranes suggests that electrostatic and elastic forces in the membrane are of particular importance in determining the high level order of membrane proteins. The recent crystal structure of photosystem I (PSI) from Synechococcus elongatus shows two quasi-symmetric branches of potential electron transfer cofactors including primary donor (dimer of chlorophylls P700), monomeric chlorophylls A and A 0 and quinone A 1 , bound to the PsaA/PsaB heterodimer. So far, it is not clear if both potential electron transfer pathways are active in this process or only one of them. To solve this issue, we studied a set of 6 mutants with methionine coordinating the primary electron acceptor, A 0 , replaced by histidine, leucine, or serine in either of two branches. Our results obtained with a technique of femtosecond transient absorption spectroscopy show that both branches are equally active in electron transfer. Mutation in either branch slows the forward electron transfer between A 0 and A 1 from 20 ps in wilde type PSI to 1-2 ns in all these mutants. This strong effect is explained by signi cant change in the redox midpoint potential and change in the position of A 0 by the mutations.",

Here we report a 2.66-\u00c5 crystal structure of cucumber homo-trimeric LHC-II, organized in a perfect virus-like icosahedral particle. The electron-density map shows the reasonable existence of a chlorophyll (Chl) a/b mixed binding site in the complex. The occurrence and locus of lactucaxanthin (Lac) was seen directly for the rst time. Based on the credible structure information, a mechanism of the energy transfer, regulation and excess excited energy dissipation under high light condition was proposed. Coherent anti-Stokes Raman scattering microscopy (CARS) is a new approach for chemical imaging of molecular systems within cells and tissues, with high sensitivity, high spatial resolution, and three dimensional sectioning capabilities, without using uorophores that are prone to photobleaching. This technique permits to map selectively molecular species, by using vibrational properties of their chemical bounds. The Epi detected (E-CARS) and forward detected (F-CARS) intensities depends on the shape, the size of the sample, as well as the index of the solvent. In this presentation, after introducing the CARS microscopy technique, we show the rst CARS studies of the refractive effect of the sample, comparing the E-CARS and F-CARS signals for different diameters of polystyrene beads, in different refractive index solvents. We present several simulations, comparing forward-detected and backward-detected signals in different sized polystyrene beads, embedded in different index solvents, and we show that, the backwardre ected F-CARS dominates the experimentally epi-detected signals. Furthermore, we demonstrate experimentally and theoretically that the maxima of forward and epi-detected signals are generated at different positions along the Z axis in the sample. We nally discuss how index mismatch in cells can alter CARS images. The effects of static magnetic elds on humans have been the subject of continuous investigations.

To enhance the image contrast, two methodologies have already been developed; i) scattering contrast for stained samples with small aperture diaphrams and ii) defocus contrast for unstained or stained samples with deep defocusing. The former prevails in histochemical sciences and the latter is popular in electron crystallography. Both methods, however, have a common drawback that the contrast is only improved by impairing the image quality. This drawback can be removed with use of the phase contrast method using phase plates, which has traditionally been used in visible light microscopy. Due to the severe obstacle of the charging of phase plates, however, the idea has not yet been materialized. We have solved the phase-plate charging problem. An experiment 300kV with TEM for a whole cell from cyanobacterium unstained and ice-embed ful lled the expectation. Only weak and vague contrast was obtained for the conventional image of the cell even with a very deep defocus.

As a result a massive reduction of the transistor signals was induced, whereas there was only little change of the amperometric records. We conclude that released protons are responsible for the detection of vesicles with transistors. The individual transistor records of vesicle exocytosis can be explained by combining the dynamics of the exocytotic event with the diffusion in the cell-chip junction. Transistor recording of exocytosis does not depend on the electrochemistry of transmitters. As many kinds of exocytotic vesicles contain a large amount of buffered protons it can be applied to numerous kinds of exocytotic events, independent on the nature of the transmitter. We tried various solvents for the solubility of the uorescent product, and found that the product was insoluble in water and most organic solvents. A quite bright uorescence emitted by the particles was observed by uorescent microscope when emitted by UV365 nm. SEM indicated that the size of the particles was 1\u00b5m 20\u00b5m, depending on the reaction time and phospholipid concentration in hexane solution. Endothelial cells from human vein grew better on the surface prepared from the particles than the culture plate, implies a possible application as a new type of biomaterial as a coating material for medical devices, and as a uorescent tracer for human bodies.",

In previous works we have described the phototaxis and the uorescence properties of a hypericin like endogenous pigment in an albino strain. We have recently obtained a heavily pigmented strain from the saline of Torre Colimena (Taranto, Italy). We have used confocal microscopy to characterize the uorescent properties of this strain and to compare them with those of the albino strain. The results obtained by one and two photon confocal microscopy show that, as in the albino strain, the uorescence intensity of the pigment is higher in dead cells than in the living cells. The excitation and emission spectra are quite similar in the two strains and this is also true for the uorescence lifetime, which is about 2 ns. All together, these measurements indicate that the pigment of the new strain belongs to the family of hypericin-like chromophores. The analysis of different confocal planes shows that the pigment is localized not only in granules under the somatic membrane in the cellular body, as currently thought, but also in the cilia. Some experiments of fotobleaching \"in situ\" con rm this result, that might have important implications in the understanding of the mechanisms of the photomotile responses of F. salina and probably of other heterotrich ciliates.

At Medical School in Zagreb, the course of Physics and Biophysics is positioned in rst and forth year of study. The students learn basic physics phenomena of structure of matter, mechanics, thermodynamics, electromagnetism, optics and acoustics applied on the human body. Additionally, the interactions of the body with the surrounding are thoroughly discussed as the basis for different diagnostic methods. The arguing at our School is still going on where to include the content of this course. Should it be the autonomous course or the part of physiology and radiology courses in the problem based learning approach?! So far at Zagreb Medical School the biophysical courses are autonomous structured according to the Biophysics programs at other European universities.

The achievement of biophysics is limited in area to provide essential tools for biological research and biophysics is far from to be the basic theory of biology. To resolve it requires the fundamental research about the logic features of biophysical processes of biology. We promoted system logic and then protein thermodynamics structure theory. Based upon it, the axiomatic theory of biophysics and biology could be developed. Our result shows that the real understanding of biology or biophysics must be constructed based upon new thinking methods. A successful ligand-receptor docking methodology depends strongly in the ef ciency of the global optimization algorithm used to explore the ligand conformational space. In this work we have implemented and analyzed the performance of a new exible ligand-receptor docking methodology. This methodology uses as optimization method a multisolution version of the generalized simulated annealing algorithm adapted to problems with box constraints. A grid-based methodology, considering the receptor rigid, and the GROMOS96 classical force eld are used to evaluate the ligand-receptor scoring function. The methodology was tested in redocking (ligand within it own protein conformation) and cross-docking (ligand within another protein conformation) experiments for ve HIV1 protease-ligand complexes with known threedimensional structures. All ligands tested are highly exible, having 12 to 20 conformational degrees of freedom. The implemented docking methodology was able to redock successfully all exible ligands with a success ratio 95% and a mean RMSD lower than 1.52 \u00c5 with respect to the corresponding experimental structures.",

In the present study to develop a platform for the molecular modeling to circumvent drug resistance associated with ABCG2, we have characterized a total of fourteen new SN-38 analogues by some typical properties, which were evaluated by molecular orbital (MO) calculations and neural network (NN) analysis. The NN was rst applied to estimate hydrophobic properties (LogP) of the analogues. Thereafter, the electrostatic potential (ESP) and the solvation free energy ( G) were evaluated by MO calculation. These indexes were found to be well correlated with the drug resistance ratio experimentally observed in ABCG2-overexpressing cells. It is suggested that hydrophilic analogues carrying OH-or NH 2 -groups are good substrates for ABCG2 and therefore exported from cancer cells. In contrast, SN-38 analogues with Cl or Br atom at those positions have similar LogP values and high af nities toward the putative active site of ABCG2, however they were not substrates of ABCG2. From these results, it is strongly suggested that hydrogen bond formation with OH-or NH 2 -groups are critically involved in the transport mechanism of ABCG2.",

The biologically active form of HIV RT is a heterodimer of two subunits, p51 and p66, each consisting of distinct subdomains: the ngers, the palm, the thumb, the connection and the RNase H subdomain, the latter only present in p66. We have demonstrated that formation of fully active RT is a two-step process involving rapid association of the two subunits (dimerization) followed by a conformational change (maturation). Thanks to the crystal structure of RT we have identi ed a new class of inhibitors based on short peptide motifs derived from the dimer interface. We rst identi ed a short 9mer peptide (Pep-7) derived from the tryptophanrich motif of the connection subdomain that blocks dimerization of RT and ef ciently abolishes HIV-1 replication. Pep-7 interacts preferentially in a pocket involving residues Trp 24 and Phe 61 on p51. We then designed 15mer peptides derived from the thumb domain which inhibit RT maturation as well as viral replication when delivered into cells. Taking into account these results we propose that dimerization of RT constitutes a potential target for the design of more speci c new antiviral drugs. . The success of gene therapy largely relies on the availability of vectors that would deliver the genetic material ef ciently to the target cells with a minimal toxicity. In this context, our purpose was to evaluate as possible vectors a series of newly synthesized low molecular weight (5 kDa) chitosan derivatives grafted with dodecenoyl (DDC) groups at different percentages (3, 9, 16 and 25 %). In the absence of DNA, the Critical Micellar Concentration (CMC) of these derivatives in 20 mM MES buffer pH 6.5 was found to be strongly dependent on the percentage of DDC but not on pH or salt concentrations. This indicates that the DDC groups confer to the chitosan derivatives the potency to self-assemble probably in micellar structures: a property that may dictate the formation and the structure of their complexes with DNA. Next, we investigated by quasielastic light scattering the size and the surface charge of complexes of plasmid DNA with these derivatives at different pH, salt concentrations and N/P ratios (expressed in charged units of chitosan amines to DNA phosphates). We found the smallest and more positively charged complexes were obtained at pH 5.8 and N/P=5 in the absence of salt: a condition where the chitosan derivatives were fully protonated and in excess over the DNA phosphate groups.",

These approaches are versatile and easily designed to incorporate a number of speci c attributes required for ef cient delivery of therapeutic and imaging agents. In particular, self-associating peptide domains can be utilized to construct stable and structurally well-de ned protein-like assemblies displaying a series of cell-routing functions.

The resulting peptide tetramer displays 8 termini within its structure that allows for the simultaneous presentation of distinct cell targeting signal or functional domains. The fusion of polycationic sequences to the hp53tet domain promotes the cellular import of the resulting constructs into eukaryotic cells. This internalization event was dramatically enhanced for such multivalent peptides in relation to their monomeric counterparts. Peptides containing a nuclear localization sequence along with a polycationic sequence were found to shuttle reporter plasmids ef ciently to the nucleus of cells.

From the conformational point of view, Pep-1 behaves differently from MPG. CD analysis revealed a transition from a non-structured to a helical conformation upon increase of the concentration while MPG remained nonstructured. Determination of the structure by NMR showed that in water, it's a-helical domain extends from residue 4 to 14. CD and FTIR indicated that Pep-1 adopts a helical conformation in the presence of phospholipids while MPG is in a -sheet form. Adsorption measurements performed at the air-water interface were consistent with the helical form. Pep-1 did not undergo conformational changes upon formation of a particle with a cargo peptide. In contrast, we observed a partial conformational transition when the complex encountered phospholipids.

Here we report that the 3CL pro containing N-and/or C-terminal additional in-frame sequences underwent autoactivation to cleave the tags and yielded the mature protease in vitro. The 3-D structure of the C145A mutant protease shows that the active site of one protomer of the dimeric protease is bound with the C-terminal six amino acids of the protomer in another asymmetric unit, suggesting a possible mechanism for maturation. The crystal structure of this product-bound form shows that the active site has a P1 pocket that binds the Gln side chain speci cally. In addition, the P2 and P4 sites are clustered together to accommodate large hydrophobic side chains. The tagged C145A mutant protein served as a substrate for the wildtype protease and the N-terminus was rst digested (55-fold faster) followed by the C-terminal cleavage as shown by the SDS-PAGE analysis. The analysis of t analytical ultracentrifuge experiments reveals the remarkably tighter dimer formation for the mature enzyme (K d = 0.35 nM) than for the mutant (C145A) containing the N-terminal (K d = 17.2 nM) or the C-terminal 10 extra amino acids (K d = 5.6 nM). Taken together, the study here provides insights to the design of our new structure-based inhibitors. Nevertheless, a signi cant proportion of patients do not respond to this therapy, and adverse effects are common. Here we report the delivery and expression of recombinant mycobacterial DNA vaccines in vivo and demonstrate the ability of multicomponent DNA vaccines to enhance Th1-polarized immune responses. Splenocytes from immunized groups of mice were re-stimulated in vitro and examined for cytotoxicity against bladder tumour cells. We used four combined recombinant BCG DNA vaccines (multi-rBCG) for electroporative immunotherapy in vivo, and found that tumour growth was signi cantly inhibited and mouse survival was prolonged. Increased immune cell in ltration and induction of apoptosis were noted after treatment with multi-rBCG alone, with the interleukin-23 (IL-23) vaccine alone, and-most signi cantly-with their combinations. Thus, electroporation immunogene therapy using multi-rBCG plus IL-23 may be an attractive regimen for the treatment of bladder cancer. This approach presents new possibilities for the treatment of bladder cancer using recombinant BCG DNA vaccines and IL-23 DNA vaccine. The cell-penetrating peptide (CPP) pep-1 is capable of introducing large proteins into different cell lines, maintaining their biological activity. Two mechanisms have been proposed to explain the entrance of other CPPs in cells, endosomal-dependent and independent. We evaluated the molecular mechanisms of pep-1mediated cellular uptake of -galactosidase ( -Gal) from E. Coli, in large unilamellar vesicles (LUV) and HeLa cells. Fluorescence spectroscopy and immuno uorescence microscopy were used to study the translocation. Internalization of -Gal into LUV and protein functionality in HeLa cells were detected by enzymatic activity. -Gal translocated into LUV in a transmembrane potentialdependent manner. Likewise, -Gal incorporation was extensively decreased in depolarized cells. Furthermore, -Gal uptake efciency and kinetics were temperature-independent and -Gal did not co-localize with endosomes, lysosomes or caveosomes. Therefore, -Gal translocation was not associated with the endosomal pathway moreover transmembrane pores were not detected. These results indicated that the protein uptake in vitro and in vivo was mainly, if not solely, dependent on a physical mechanism governed by electrostatic interactions between pep-1 (positively-charged) and membranes (negatively-charged).",

Both MPG and PEP carriers enter cells rapidly, in a process involving membrane disorganization, independently of the endosomal pathway. MPG ef ciently delivers short ODNs and siRNA into a wide variety of mammalian cell lines, without interfering with their biological function. PEP signi cantly improves delivery of PNA and peptides. Both carriers were used for the delivery of siRNA or antisense PNA targeting the cell cycle regulatory protein cyclin B1 in an animal model and were found to block tumor growth upon intravenous injection. We believe that MPG and PEPbased technologies will contribute signi cantly to the development of basic and therapeutic applications.",

Watts Department of Biochemistry, University of Oxford, South Parks Road, OXFORD, OX1 3QU, UK Acetylcholinesterases are the enzymes which preferentially hydrolyze acetyl esters (such as ACh or acetyl-\u00e2-methylcholine), containing 543 amino acid residues in the EeAChE form and arranged as a 12-stranded \u00e2-sheet surrounded by 14 \u00e1-helices. The protein is ellipsoidal in shape, with approximate dimensions of 45 \u00c5 by 60 \u00c5 by 65 \u00c5. Inhibitors of acetylcholinesterase are of commercial and medical interest as pesticides and as therapeutics in the treatment of Alzheimer's disease. An understanding of the conformation of inhibitors in the binding site enables the rational design of novel inhibitors with increased potency and speci city. Interaction between the ligand, amino-2-methyl-3-(3tri uoroacetylbenzyl-oxymethyl)quinoline (R414983), and AChE inhibitor has been studied by advanced solid-state NMR through double-quantum chemical shift and distance measurements. Combining solid-state NMR data and docking simulations, conformation of the AChE inhibitor at the active site has been predicted. In vivo, heat shock proteins (Hsps) being stress-inducible chaperones can attenuate detrimental consequences of ischemic insults, inammation, neurodegenerative diseases, etc. Also, intracellular accumulation and chaperone activities of some Hsps may contribute to improved cell survival following UV or ionizing radiation. In models of pathological states and their treatment, we used special virusbased vectors for overexpression of Hsp70 or Hsp27 in cell cultures to confer cytoprotection under simulated ischemia/reperfusion. In parallel, similar cytoprotection was achieved after pretreatments of the cells with a pharmacological Hsp inducer, Geranylgeranylacetone. The cytoprotective effects were manifested in the lesser extent of oxidative modi cation and aggregation of cellular proteins, better preservation of the cytoskeleton, faster restoration of energy metabolism and the improved post-stress cell survival. In the other model, we treated normal and tumor cells with an inhibitor of the chaperone activity of Hsp90, Geldanamycin. Only the drug-treated tumor cells became more sensitive to gamma-irradiation; such results characterize this drug as a potentially selective radiosensitizer of tumors. Taken together our data demonstrate promising approaches to clinically bene cial manipulating the levels of expression and/or chaperone activity of Hsp(s) by means of gene therapy or pharmacotherapy.",

Our aim was to search for non-lethal effects of various stress conditions on cultured hamster lung broblasts (DC3F cells) as well as to assess the recovery time after stress removal. DC3F cells were cultured in standard conditions and were submitted to stress, either by incubation with chemical substances (sodium arsenate, sodium nitroprusiate) and drugs (bleomicine and statins) either by irradiation (UV, He-Ne laser). The doses and exposure times were chosen as to avoid cell death. After stress removal, cells were allowed to recover and the recovery time period was measured. Structural and functional parameters were evaluated before and after stress, as well as during recovery. By now, experimental models for the in vitro study of non-lethal stress inducing factors have been set up. Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) is an emerging infectious disease caused by a novel human coronavirus. The viral maturation requires a main protease (3CL pro ) to cleave the virus-encoded polyproteins. We report here that the 3CL pro containing N-and/or C-terminal additional in-frame sequences underwent autoactivation to cleave the tags and yielded the mature protease in vitro. The 3-D structure of the C145A mutant protease shows that the active site of one protomer of the dimeric protease is bound with the Cterminal six amino acids of the protomer in another asymmetric unit, suggesting a possible mechanism for maturation. The tagged C145A mutant protein served as a substrate for the wild-type protease and the N-terminus was rst digested (55-fold faster) followed by the C-terminal cleavage as shown by the SDS-PAGE analysis. The analysis of the quaternary structures for the tagged and mature proteases by analytical ultracentrifuge experiments reveals the remarkably tighter dimer formation for the mature enzyme than for the mutant (C145A) containing the N-terminal or the C-terminal 10 extra amino acids. Taken together, the study here provides insights to the design of our new structure-based inhibitors.",

For this purpose, an aqueous pUC18 or pEGFP-N1 plasmid solution is emulsi ed in an organic solvent and stabilized by an amphiphilic diblock copolymer. The neutral block of the copolymer forms an interfacial brush, whereas the cationic block complexes with DNA. A subsequent change of the quality of the organic solvent results in a collapse of the brush and the formation of a capsule. The capsules are subsequently dispersed in aqueous medium to form vesicles and stabilized with an osmotic agent in the external phase. Inside the vesicles, the DNA is compacted in a liquid-crystalline fashion as shown by the appearance of birefringent textures under crossed polarisers and the increase in uorescence of labeled DNA. The compaction ef ciency and the size distribution of the vesicles were determined by light and electron microscopy, respectively, and the integrity of the DNA after encapsulation and subsequent release was con rmed by gel electrophoresis.

Compounds, such as AZT for the treatment of HIV infections, ACV and GCV used against Herpes virus, or the anticancer compounds AraC and gemcitabine, can enter cells only in the unphosphorylated state (prodrug) and need to be transformed by different kinases to their pharmacologically active triphosphate state that interferes with DNA replication. We have rst designed mutants of the human TMP kinase (hTMPK) that phosphorylate AZTMP up to 200-fold faster than wildtype. Expression of this enzyme in human cells leads to 10-fold higher intracellular concentrations of AZTTP and to enhanced HIV inhibition. Second, the prodrugs ACV and GCV are not phosphorylated by human kinases, but are converted to their monophosphate forms by HSV1-TK which is used in enzyme/prodrug-dependent cancer suicide gene therapy. We generated enzyme variants which show selective and ef cient phosphorylation of GCV. Third, an engineered human dCK variant catalyzes more ef ciently the activation of the prodrugs AraC and gemcitabine.

The peptide has a strong af nity for anionic lipids found in the outer membrane of bacterial membranes and has shown evidence of higher transfection activity against transformed over healthy tissue in culture. It has been proposed that anionic lipids can ip-op to reach the cytoplasmic monolayer. Here they neutralise the cationic transfection complexes thereby causing release of oligonucleotides into the cytoplasm. We were, therefore, particularly interested to test for the role of the acidic lipid phosphatidylserine (PS) in mediating LAH4-mediated delivery of DNA ef ciency. To understand the potential peptide-lipid interactions in more detail, solid-state NMR experiments on model membranes have been performed. 31 P MAS NMR on mixed phosphatidylcholine (PC)/PS and PC/phosphatidylglycerol (PG) membranes has been used to investigate speci c LAH4 interactions with anionic lipids. By using deuterated lipids and wide-line 2 H NMR when probing lipid chain order, it is demonstrated that LAH4 preferentially interacts with PS over PC. LAH4 thereby effectively disorders the anionic PS lipid fatty acyl chains. The lipid chain destabilising effect of LAH4 and also LAH4 analogues can then be compared with their transfection ef ciency for DNA or siRNA in cell culture to aid in rational peptide vector design. Virtual screening is now widely accepted as a basis for drug discovery thanks to signi cant improvement and good hit rates [1]. However, it is still highly CPU-consuming. At the same time, the number of protein-ligand complexes described at the atomic level is rising and the sequence similarity is used for structure and function predictions. New approaches are being developed to take advantage of the available structural data and the huge number of protein sequences in order to allow better tuned virtual screening. New web servers are being built to ease and to speed up the whole process (http://abcis.cbs.cnrs.fr/kindock/). Integrating these servers into a pipeline dedicated to molecular modelling (http://abcis.cbs.cnrs.fr/atome/) shall allow both the re ned validation of modelled active sites as well as the oriented screening for the primary caracterization of potential ligands. An ideal drug delivery system should own the following characteristics, the rst is the targeting of therapeutic agent to the speci c site of their action. The second is the controlled delivery of a therapeutic molecule or protein in a pulsatile or staggered fashion. The third is the achieving sustained zero-order release of a therapeutic agent over a prolonged period of time. In this study, a new drug delivery system combined these characteristics was provided, which contains azobenzene derivatives (AB lipid) as an on-off switch incorporated into liposomes. The drastic release of calcein was observed on the rst UV irradiation of AB lipid to the cis isomer, while a suppressed release was observed when irradiated with the rst visible light. After that, the slope of release pro le became coincident. Furthermore, calcein release was greatly increased after UV irradiation of AB lipid to the cis isomer and the drug release was greatly suppressed after Vis irradiation of AB lipid to the trans isomer. We can control the release rate of calcein from AB lipid/egg PC mixed liposomes by UV or Vis light irradiation. Tryptophanase (Trpase), a bacterial enzyme with no counterpart in eukaryotic cells, produces L-Trp pyruvate ammonia and indole. It was suggested that indole is essential for bacteria multiplication and bio lm formation. Bio lms destroy equipment and food and cause many illnesses. Most synthesized quasi-substrates inhibit Trpase at mM range. An optimal and speci c inhibitor of Trpase may eliminate indole production and prevent bio lm formation. X-ray crystallography of the holo-WT E. coli Trpase soaked with L-Trp and the known mechanism of Trpase activity should provide the information for the design and synthesis of active-sitespeci c quasi-analogs. Utilizing the chromogenic substrate S-(onitrophenyl)-L-cysteine, the following Michaelis-Menten kinetics analyses determined the mode of Trpase inhibition by Trp and quinone based quasi-analogues and the corresponding Ki values (in \u00b5M): dl-2-Alanyl-2,10 anthraquinone, noncompetitively, 110; Trypthophan ethylester, competitively, 24; acetyltryptophan, uncompetitively, 61.5; S-phenylbenzoquinone-L-tryptophan, uncompetitively, 92. PLP-L-Trp, inhibited irreversibly only the apo form of Trpase and may serve for structure-determination purposes. Further attempts are being made to synthesize improved Trpase inhibitors, i.e., in the nM range. Polyelectrolyte multilayer lms (PEM) adsorbed on biomaterial surfaces are a new way to create a controlled release system. Using biodegradable polymers, the lms can be degraded in vivo and release active molecules. In this work, we demonstrate the possibility of tuning the degradability of polysaccharide PEM in vitro and in vivo. Chitosan and hyaluronan PEM (CHI/HA) were either native or cross-linked (CL) using a water soluble carbodiimide (EDC) at various concentrations in combination with Nhydroxysulfosuccinimide. The in vitro degradation of the lms in contact with enzymes was followed by quartz crystal microbalance measurements and confocal laser scanning microscopy after lm labeling with CHI FITC . Whereas the native lms were subjected to degradation, the CL lms were more resistant to enzymatic degradation. Films made of chitosan of medium molecular weight were indeed more resistant than lms made of chitosan-oligosaccharides. In addition, macrophages could degrade all types of lms and internalize the chitosan in vitro. The native lms implanted in vivo in mouse peritoneal cavity for a week showed an almost complete degradation whereas the CL lms were only partially degraded. These results suggests that the polysaccharides PEM are of potential interest for in vivo applications as biodegradable coatings and that degradation can be tuned by controlling lm cross-linking.",

These processes highly correlated with toxicity of drugs and are actively studied in pharmacology. Two classes of proteins, the drug metabolizing enzymes such as cytochrome P450s (CYPs) and transporters, are the target of such ADME/Tox research. It was relatively recent that these two classes of proteins are synthesized by the genes that are the target genes of the nuclear receptors. Nuclear receptors are ligand-activated transcription factors that form a superfamily. In case of humans there are 48 nuclear receptors almost half of whose ligands are identied, leaving some as true orphans. Thus it was now recognized that these nuclear receptors play the role of sensors of drugs and other xenobiotic substances including environmental chemical pollutants and nutritional ingredients, while the drug metabolizing enzymes and the transporters are the processors which carry the actual cleaning jobs. We have started to elucidate the feedback loops that are formed by the xenobiotic ligands, nuclear receptors, their target genes, their product proteins, and their feedback actions on the ligands. The work is being carried out on our background database on the ligands and their receptors called KiBank, and search programs for target genes of nuclear receptors algorithmically. The most recent results will be presented at the presentation. The major route for drug entry into cells is permeation across lipid bilayers. Due to methodological limitations there are only few studies on permeation of drug-like molecules across lipid bilayers. An assay developed in our lab allows the direct measurement of lipid bilayer permeation of aromatic carboxylic acids (ACAs). Tb 3 , which forms a uorescent complex with ACAs, is entrapped in liposomes and ACA entry is determined from luminescence increase. Lipid bilayer permeation was pH-dependent, following a Henderson-Hasselbalch function with a plateau for the neutral and the anionic species, respectively. In contrast to the expectations of the pH-partition hypothesis, permeation of the anionic species was only 1 to 3 magnitudes lower than that of the neutral species, leading to anion-controlled permeation at pH 7.4, independently of bilayer state and lipid composition. Permeation across bilayers with a biologically relevant lipid composition was signi cantly slower than across egg-phosphatidylcholine membranes. The in uence of single lipids, such as cholesterol, was dependent on the structure and ionization state of the permeant. Permeation coef cients of the neutral species correlated better with the polar surface area (PSA) than logP oct , therefore PSA is a better predictor for bilayer permeation of the neutral species of small ACAs than logP oct .",

It plays important role in various physiologic processes, including brinolysis, cell adhesion, and signal transduction, and has been recognized as a target for intervention in tumor growth and tumor metastasis. We constructed an active site mutant of uPA protease domain (159-405) with three mutations (C279A, N302Q, and S356A) and expressed it as secreted protein in pichia pastoria with pPICZa vector. The secreted mutant was captured from culture medium by a cation exchange column and then further puri ed on a gel ltration column. The puri ed mutant was then crystallized by sitting drop vapor diffusion method with several precipitant conditions: (1) 1.5-2.1M ammonium sulphate, 5-8% PEG400, 50mM sodium citrate pH 4.6 or 50mM sodium phosphate pH 7.5, 0.05% sodium azide. (2) 1.8M ammonium sulphate, 0.14M Lithium sulphate, 50mM sodium acetate at pH 5.2, (3) 2.5-2.8M sodium formate, 50mM sodium acetate at pH 5.2.

Abstract In this work, the Linear Interaction energy (LIE) method was used to calculate the binding free energies of HIV-1 Integrase (IN) and a series of dicaffeoyl -or digalloyl pyrroliding and furan derivatives inhibitors. The model of binding free energy prediction for homogeneous inhibitors of HIV-1 IN has been obtained with a root-mean-square deviation (RMSD) of 1.39 kJ/mol and estimated to be a precise model with good prediction capability. In addition, the probable binding mode of this series of inhibitors with HIV-1 IN was proposed by using molecular docking and molecular dynamics (MD) simulation methods. Our results indicate that caffeoyl -or galloyl group of inhibitors have close interaction with a HIV-1 IN conservative DDE motif.",

Akyolcu 1 1 Istanbul University, Cerrahpasa Medical Faculty, Department of Biophysics, Turkey, 2 Istanbul University Cerrahpasa Medical Faculty, Department of Physiology, Turkey Cadmium as heavy metal is toxic and carcinogenic for organisms. Cadmium perform their effects on living organisms by accumulation in blood and various tissues. Due to their accumulation in various tissues and in blood, tissue antioxidant enzyme systems are affected. The present study was planned to determine the possible protective roles of selenium and catechin against the toxic effects of considered heavy metals. The study has been performed in Wistar Albino type rats which divided into four groups as control and cadmium, cadmium+selenium, cadmium+catechin received groups. Besides cadmium as heavy metal, selenium concentration determinations were performed in blood, liver and kidney tissues of each group of rats. In the same tissue samples besides lipid peroxidation measurements, glutathione, glutathione peroxidase and superokside dismutase enzyme activity determinations were also performed. The accumulation of heavy metals was determined in blood, liver and kidneys after cadmium administration during experimental period. In the tissue of experimental group animals there was an increased lipid peroxidation but decreased antioxidant enzyme activities were observed. While effects of selenium in decreased toxicity of cadmium have been detected, there was no statistically signicant effect of catechin observed. proposed that motors could dynamically cluster at the tip of tubes when they are individually attached to the membrane. We demonstrate, in a recently designed experimental system, the existence of an accumulation of motors allowing tube extraction. We determine the motor density along a tube by using uorescence intensity measurements. We also perform a theoretical analysis describing the dynamics of motors and tube growth. The only adjustable parameter is the motor binding rate onto microtubules, which we measure to be 4.7 +/-2.4 s 1 . In addition, we quantitatively determine, for a given membrane tension, the existence of a threshold in motor density on the vesicle above which nanotubes can be formed. We nd that the number of motors pulling a tube can range from four at threshold to a few tens away from it. The threshold in motor density (or in membrane tension at constant motor density) could be important for the understanding of membrane traf c regulation in cells.",

Molloy Division of Physical Biochemistry, MRC National Institute of Medical Research, The Ridgeway, Mill Hill NW7 1AA, London, UK In this work we describe the design and development of a biomolecular walker based on the motile system found in certain ciliated protists. The motile system is driven by the binding of Ca 2 ions and in contrast to other commonly studied motor proteins is independent of ATPase (Amos et al., 1975) . The motor protein is a 20kDa Ca-binding protein called spasmin (Maciejewski et al.,1999; Itabashi et al., 2003) which belongs to the EF-hand family of calcium binding proteins called calmodulins. Upon calcium binding, spasmin is thought to undergo a large conformational change as it binds its own target peptide and we wish to exploit this in order to create our own novel molecular walker.We have created a recombinant spasmin with sequence tags to enable speci c immobilization and various conjugate chemistries. Cystein mutants have been introduced at speci c points in the protein to enable attachment of other small molecules, for example uorophores. We are now optimising protein expression and puri cation to maximise the yield of active protein on which we can perform the conjugate chemistries. We will characterize the structural changes using biophysical methods such as circular dichroism, analytical ultracentrifugation, electron microscopy, AFM and total internal re ection uorescence spectroscopy on single molecules. The force generation in muscle arises from direct interaction of the two main protein components of the muscle, myosin and actin. The process is driven by the energy liberated from the hydrolysis of ATP by myosin. The interaction is performed by cyclic interaction of myosin with ATP and actin, and at least six intermediates are proposed for actomyosin ATPase in solution. The powerful DSC technique allows the derivation of heat capacity of proteins as a function of temperature. From the deconvolution of the thermal unfolding patterns it is possible to characterize the structural domains of the motor protein. In this work we tried to approach the temperature-induced unfolding processes in different intermediate state of ATP hydrolysis in striated muscle bres. We have extended the experiments to study the ber system prepared from psoas muscle of rabbit in rigor, strongly binding and weakly binding states of myosin to actin where the inorganic phosphate (P i ) was substituted by the phosphate analogue orthovanadate. The DSC transitions were analyzed in different buffer solutions (Tris and MOPS) to get information about the temperature dependence of pH on the conformational changes.",

Peterman Vrije Universiteit, de Boelelaan 1081, 1081 HV, Amsterdam, the Netherlands The dimeric motor protein kinesin steps by a hand-over-hand mechanism. This means that the centre of mass moves with 8 nm steps, while the two motor domains, the one after the other, move 16 nm to the next binding site on the microtubule. The molecular details of what happens during a step are not fully understood, partly because of lack of time resolution in wide-eld, single-molecule uorescence experiments. We set out to develop an approach to study the motility of kinesin with a time resolution below a millisecond (a single step takes on the order of 10 milliseconds). This approach allows us to look into the mechanochemistry and coupling of the two kinesin motor domains while they are stepping. Our method is based on confocal microscopy and we study the uorescent properties of single labeled motors while they walk through the confocal laser spot. We present the experimental details of our approach and show our results on human kinesin constructs that are speci cally labeled in the tail. We show that our approach enables us to study the mechanism of kinesin with a much higher time resolution than what was achieved before with single-molecule uorescence experiments.",

Our model consists of two Brownian motors (ratchets) separated by a xed distance r. The velocity and other quantities of the coupled motors are calculated by solving the Fokker-Planck equation with various choices of r and other parameters. Then, assuming a certain probability distribution of r associated with random attachment of kinesin heads on a bead in the experiment, the statistical properties of the motion of the coupled Brownian motors are analysed.

Tuma 2 1 Department of Physical Sciences, POBox 64, FIN-00014, University of Helsinki, Finland, 2 Institute of Biotechnology, University of Helsinki, Finland Molecular motors often consist of two or more subunits that cooperate to convert chemical energy into mechanical motion. Hexameric helicases and viral packaging ATPases constitute a special class of molecular motors that translocate along nucleic acids. Recent structural and spectroscopic characterization of these motors revealed that their enzymatic cooperativity does not result from cooperative binding [1-2]. In order to understand this new type of cooperativity we simulated the kinetics of a single hexameric motor by multiple coupled stochastic reactions using the Gillespie algorithm [3] . In contrast to analytical methods, our direct simulation allowed us to investigate the kinetics with an arbitrary model for cooperativity between the subunits. Simulations on the kinetics of the hexameric RNA packaging motor P4 from dsRNA bacteriophage [1] with different cooperativity mechanisms provided insight into the RNAmediated cooperativity and yielded a sound theoretical basis for the interpretation of experimental results [2]. The Viral Infectivity Factor (Vif) encoded by HIV-1 is a small basic protein that strongly modulates the viral replication and is required for pathogenicity. Vif is packaged into HIV-1 particles through a strong interaction with genomic RNA and is associated with viral nucleoprotein complexes. Moreover Vif acts during the early stages of the viral infection (capsid disassembly, reverse transcription) as well as during the late stages of virus replication (virus assembly and maturation of the virion). However the effect on early stages is probably a consequence of a defective assembly and / or virion maturation. Understanding the RNA-binding properties of Vif would contribute to elucidate the role played by Vif in the regulation of the genomic RNA traf cking in the cytoplasm to unable ef cient packaging, and the prevention of cellular inhibitors from altering HIV-1 RNA. In this context, we have characterised the interactions of recombinant Vif with HIV-1 genomic RNA by uorescence spectroscopy, and determined the af nity of the protein for synthetic RNAs corresponding to various regions of HIV-1 genome. Taken together our results demonstrate cooperative and speci c binding.",

Fluorescence studies with Molecular Beacons and crystallization experiments with 23-nucleotide DIS fragments showed that the ratio of hairpin to duplex formed after annealing in water essentially depends on RNA concentration, and not on cooling kinetics. With natural sequences able to form a loop-loop complex (or 'kissing complex'), concentrations as low as 3 \u00b5M in strands are necessary to obtain a majority of the hairpin form. On the contrary, when kissing-complex formation was made impossible by mutation in the loop, a majority of hairpins was obtained even at 80 \u00b5M in strands. This mutated sequence also showed that kissing-complex formation is not a prerequisite for an ef cient conversion to duplex in presence of salts. We proved that this happens through hairpins engaged in a cruciform intermediate, but not from free strands after hairpin melting. Supporting this view, the very rst step of formation of such a cruciform intermediate could be trapped in a crystal structure. Such a mechanism might be biologically signi cant beyond the strict eld of HIV-1 RNA dynamics. Generation of RNA dimeric form of the human immunode ciency virus type 1 (HIV-1) genome is important for the viral replication. The dimerization initiation site (DIS) has been identi ed as a short sequence that can form a stem-loop structure with a selfcomplementary sequence in the loop and a bulge in the stem. A 39mer DIS RNA fragment, DIS39, spontaneously formed \"loosedimer\" and was converted into \"tight-dimer\" by supplement of nucleocapsid protein NCp7. NMR chemical shift analysis for DIS39 in the kissing-loop and extended-duplex dimers revealed that three dimensional structures of the stem-bulge-stem region were similar between the two types of dimers. Therefore, we determined the solution structures of two shorter RNA molecules corresponding to the loop-stem region and the stem-bulge-stem region of DIS39, and the solution structures of DIS39 in the kissing-loop and extendedduplex dimers were determined by combining the parts of structures. The mechanism of conformational conversion will be discussed based on the solution structures and the molecular dynamics analysis.",

HIV-1 Dimerization Initiation Site (DIS) is a strongly conserved stem-loop in the 5' leader region of the genomic RNA. It was shown in vivo that alteration of the DIS dramatically reduces viral infectivity. We have previously solved crystal structures of the DIS kissing-loop complex. Analysis of these structures revealed an unexpected resemblance between the DIS kissing-loop and the 16 S ribosomal aminoacyl-tRNA site (A-site), which is the target of aminoglycoside antibiotics. We have shown that some aminoglycosides specifically bind to the DIS kissing-loop complex with an af nity and geometry similar to that observed in the A-site.",

These structures show that, as expected, two aminoglycosides are bound per kissing-loop complex. Importantly, the binding is observed not only in vitro on large HIV-1 genomic RNA fragments, but also on infected cells. Moreover, we showed that some of these aminoglycosides stabilize the kissingloop RNA dimer, which is consistent with the observation in crystal structures of numerous direct and water-mediated drug-RNA contacts. These structures are currently used as starting points for designing potential new drugs targeted against the viral RNA.",

We recently developed a new way to model the long range entropy in RNA and applied it to RNA secondary structure prediction. In some of instances, the new approach is able to achieve far better predictions than the state of the art secondary structure programs even given exactly the same parameters. Predictions using this method tend to show distributions that are funnel shaped. A new and important parameter in these calculations is the persistence length (a measure of the correlation and exibility of the RNA). (URL: http://www.rna.it-chiba.ac.jp/ vsfold/vsfold4/) This new approach has now been extended to prediction of pseudoknots. The method is a heuristic wherein the hierarchical folding hypothesis is used to nd the pseudoknots as the RNA secondary structure is folding, and corrections to that secondary structure are made to accommodate the pseudoknot. It is able to do these searches in roughly N^4 time. The model is consistent with the hierarchical hypothesis and it is possible to estimate RNA folding times that are of the correct order of magnitude using this model. With further adaptations to account for the size, shape and variablity of amino acid residues (hydrophobicity etc.), the model also appears to be transferable to protein folding problems.",

            "text": "A. V. Melkikh Ural State Technical University, Ekaterinburg, Russia A model of the genome as a gene network capable of receiving information about the environment and performing some operations on genes has been considered. The evolution rate of replicators for the mechanism of random mutations has been estimated. It was shown that the evolution rate under random actions is negligibly small for real dimensions of genomes of replicators [1]. It was inferred that only a deterministic mechanism of the evolution can explain the known evolution rate of replicators. A deterministic model of the evolution has been proposed. The basic principles of this model include: 1) Information about the replicators evolution is encoded in the conformational states of proteins; 2) The conformational language of proteins is translated into the language of nucleotide sequences during the evolution; 3) The structure of genes is controlled such that the transition to a nearest free ecological niche takes a minimum time (at a preset restriction on the control). Transfer RNAs are synthesized as part of longer primary transcripts that require processing of both their 3' and 5' extremities in every living organism known. The 5' side is matured by the quasiuniversally conserved endonucleolytic ribozyme, RNase P, while removal of the 3' tails can be either exonucleolytic or endonucleolytic. The endonucleolytic pathway is catalysed by an enzyme known as RNase Z. RNase Z cleaves precursor tRNAs immediately after the discriminator base in most cases, yielding a tRNA primed for addition of the CCA motif by nucleotidyl transferase. RNase Z is found in the vast majority eukaryotes and archaea and in about half of the sequenced bacteria. It is often essential for growth and mutations in one of the two genes encoding RNase Z (ELAC2) have been linked with prostate cancer in man. In this poster we present the crystal structure of Bacillus subtilis RNase Z at 2.1\u00c5 resolution (1) resolved by MAD method and propose a model for tRNA recognition and cleavage. The structure explains the allosteric properties of the enzyme and also sheds light on the mechanisms of inhibition.It also highlights the extraordinary adaptability of the metallohydrolase domain of the b-lactamase family for the hydrolysis of covalent bonds.",

            "text": "(1)I. Most RNAs undergo several steps of post-transcriptional modi cation before carrying out their assigned functions. One of the major modi cations is the splicing process, by which non-coding introns are removed from the coding exons. Splicing can be performed by autocatalytic, self-splicing introns (e.g. group II introns), i.e. catalytic RNA or ribozymes. Group II introns, which occur in bacterial genomes and in organellar genes of plants, funghi and lower eukaryotes, consist of a conserved set of six domains. Domain 1 recognizes the 5'-exon through a 10-15 base pairing interaction formed by two regions within the intron (exon binding sites, EBS1 and EBS2) and the last 10-15 nucleotides of the 5'-exon (intron binding sites, IBS1 and IBS2). As the correct recognition of IBS1 by EBS1 is crucial for a successful splicing event we are investigating the structural and metal ion requirements of this part by various spectroscopic techniques, e.g. NMR. Our data shows that the hairpin including EBS1 consists of a helical region followed by an unstructured single stranded part, which is ready for splice site recognition. The results of the structure analysis will be presented. Financial support by Boehringer Ingelheim Fonds (fellowship to D.

Modi ed nucleosides may facilitate or hinder across the loop interactions. Large substituents in 34 th and 37 th modi ed nucleosides if oriented suitably may also interact with each other. Across the loop interactions may lead to unconventional anticodon loop structures also affecting exibility of the anticodon loop. This may restrict or enlarge synonymous codon choice and decoding during protein biosynthesis. Except for tRNA Asn (with interacting Q 34 and t 6 A 37 ), our studies show conventional 'open' loop structure -free of across the loop interactions, for a number of interesting tRNA anticodon loops with diverse hyper modi ed nucleosides at both of these locations. Molecular dynamics simulations of hydrated anticodon arm of tRNA Asn show persisting interaction involving the diol group of Q 34 and carbonyl group of ureido linkage in t 6 A 37 . Additionally, the Hoogsteen edge of 37 th adenine base participates in hydrogen bonding with Watson -Crick edge of 33 rd base and thus contributes to unique loop structure of tRNA Asn . Resulting suboptimal Q:C base pairing leads to unbiased reading of U or C as the third codon letter.

Their unusual expansions cause genetic diseases such as type 1 myotonic dystrophy (DM1) and Huntington's disease (HD), the unit sequences being CTG and CAG, respectively. The numbers of repeats of the two complementary sequences change independently during DNA replication or repair. The direct origin of DM1 is, however, the transcribed RNA fragments with CUG repeats, which forms a speci c structure and inhibits other protein syntheses. In the present study, structural versatilities of such DNA and RNA fragments has been examined. Native PAGEs of (CUG) n show that the hairpin structure with even number is more stable than that with odd number. This difference might be ascribed to the structural difference at the hairpin head. The PAGEs also show that duplex formation is dependent on coexisting cationic species and their concentration. Crystal data of (CUG) 6 (a=b=39.6, c=141.0 \u00c5, and the space group R32) suggest that the asymmetric unit contains the RNA fragment. An approximate crystal structure solved by molecular replacement techniques at 1.95 \u00c5 resolution shows that the RNA fragments form a duplex similar to an A-form RNA.",

Grozdova Moscow State University, Chemistry Department Copolymers of ethylene oxide (EO) and propylene oxide (PO) of EO n 2 PO m EO n 2 type (Pluronics) are able to reverse multidrug resistance of tumor cells. Obviously, rst step of Pluronics action on cells is their interaction with cell plasma membranes. Previously we have shown that Pluronics bind to arti cial membranes and enhance accumulation of anti-tumor drug doxorubicin inside pH-gradient liposomes and ip-op of NBD-labeled phosphatidylethanolamine in liposomes composed from lecithin only. Taking into account different lipid composition of cell membranes it seemed relevant to evaluate its signi cance for membrane sensitivity to Pluronic. We made binary liposomes containing, besides the lecithin, different amounts of other lipids of natural origin (cholesterol, phosphatidylethanolamine, cardiolipin, ganglioside GM1, sphingomyelin, phosphatidic acid). A reverse dependence between the microviscosity of membranes and their sensitivity to Pluronic effects was demonstrated. These data may be important for the understanding of the mechanisms of Pluronic interaction with cells.P-891HYDROPHOBIC PHOTOLABELLING ANALYSIS OF LIPID-PROTEIN STOICHIOMETRYA. M. Villamil Giraldo, P. R. Castello, L. Gonz\u00e1lez Flecha, J. M. Del no, J. P. F. C. Rossi IQUIFIB, Facultad de farmacia y bioqu\u00edmica, Universidad de Buenos Aires, Argentina We have developed a method to assess the number of lipid association sites based on the use of a photoactivatable phosphatidylcholine (PC) analogue. [ 125 I]TID-PC/16. This reagent locates speci cally within the phospholipidic membrane and reacts indiscriminately upon photolysis. It is therefore possible to directly analyze the interaction between the protein and lipids belonging to its immediate environment. We have studied the composition of the lipid annulus of three different membrane proteins belonging to the P-type ATPase family: sarcoplasmic reticulum calcium pump (SERCA), sodium pump and plasma membrane calcium pump (PMCA). The proteins were photolabelled in mixed micelles containing detergent, [ 125 I] TID-PC/16 and different amounts of PC. The stoichiometry was estimated after the extent of the labeling reaction had been independently assessed. Our results are in good agreement with the values previously obtained by EPR for SERCA and sodium pump. Lipid-protein stoichiometry measured on PMCA rendered 17 2 PC molecules per protein monomer, a value which ts reasonably well with that predicted by geometrical considerations. This analytical development could nd general application to the study of lipidprotein interactions.

It is located in the quinone reducing pocket Q i , inserted between the putative quinone binding region and heme b i (presumably the high potential heme b H ). This was denoted heme c i(Stroebel et al., 2003)  or x(Kurisu et al., 2003). Previous in vivo spectroscopic data provided evidence for the existence, in thylakoid membranes, of such an electron carrier, then called \"G\", which can exchange electrons with b H in a membrane potentialdependent manner (Lavergne, 1983; Joliot and Joliot). This has been the only information on the presence of this redox center until the structure was solved. In the present work, redox-induced absorbance changes were monitored in puri ed cytochrome b 6 f complex from Chlamydomonas reinhardtii. Four spectral components with midpoint potentials at pH 7 of +340 mV (cyt f ), -30 mV (cyt b H ), -130 mV (cyt b L ), and +100 mV were found. The latter component, ascribed to heme c i , shows a broad absorption band around 427 nm and no signi cant change in the green region, in agreement with known spectra of c'-type cytochromes. These results are discussed in relation to structural and functional information on the cytochrome b 6 f complex.P-894Effect of pH on photosynthetyc redox-reactions around photosystem II of the thylakoids S. A. Aliyeva, R. A. Gasanov Institute of Botany, National Academy Sciences of Azerbaijan Patamdart shosse 40, Baku AZ1073, Azerbaijan, e-mail: r.gasanov@box.azThe ef ciency and rate of photosynthetic water-oxidation activity and photosynthetic electron transfer reactions are dependence on pH. Dependence oxygen evolution (OE) with PpBQ and ferricianide, the amplitude of the multiline EPR-signal at 6 K associated with S 2 -state and millisecond delayed light emission (ms-DLE) both for chloroplast thylakoid and oxygen evolving complex have shown that amplitude of OE from thylakoid and multiline EPR signal on pH in range of 4,0-9,0 decreased in alkaline and acetic pH and stable in range of 5,8-7,2. The loss of OE and S 2 -state correlated with the loss of the slow component of DLE of chlorophyll in thylakoid membranes is observed. At pH 4,5 remained about 10 % of amplitude of the multiline EPR signal and OE and at pH 8,5 remained about 35-40 % of amplitude of the multiline EPR signal and 18 % OE observed at pH 6,5. The intensities of the ms-DLE have maximum value at pH 7,5 whereas maximum EPR signal amplitude is observed at pH 6,5. Both alkaline and acidic pH inhibits photoreactions of PSII, which leads to the loss of light-induced amplitude of multilane EPR signal, OE ability and ms-DLE of chlorophyll in thylakoids, showing that intrathylakoid pH plays essential role in photosynthesis functioning and regulation. -Planck-Institute of Biophysics, Frankfurt/Main, Germany, 2 Dept. Biochemistry, University of Regensburg, Germany Photosensory responses of green algae are mediated by rhodopsins with microbial-type chromophores.The recently detected cDNA sequences from the green alga Chlamydomonas reinhardtii that encode microbial opsin-related proteins were termed Channelopsin-1 and 2 (Chop1/2) by us(Nagel et al., 2002; 2003)  and CSRA/B (Sineshchekov et al., 2002) or Acop1/2 (Suzuki et al., 2003) by others. The hydrophobic core region of the proteins shows homology to the light-activated proton pump bacteriorhodopsin. ChR-2 (ChR2 = Chop-2 + retinal) is a cation channel,which is directly switched by light, as shown by expression in Xenopus laevis oocytes (Nagel et al., 2003). The action spectrum of ChR2 has its maximum at 460 nm (Sineshchekov et al., 2002; Nagel et al., 2003). We show heterologous expression of ChR-2 in mammalian cells. Whole cell patch clamp studies demonstrate large light-gated ion currents and the capacity of ChR2 to depolarize the membrane by illumination. ChR-2 or truncated ChR-2 (ChR2-315), when expressed in mammalian cells, yields light-gated channel activity with no apparent difference from Xenopus laevis-expressed ChR2. A fusion protein of ChR2-315 with yellow uorescent protein (eYFP) induced strong uorescent labeling of the plasma membrane, indicating its preferential expression there. ChR2-315-eYFP showed the same light-induced activity as ChR2 itself.

Shuvalov Institute of Basic Biological Problems,Pushchino-city, Institutskaya str., 2, Russia,142290The photosynthetic reaction center (RC) of the purple bacterium Rb. sphaeroides is the membrane pigment -protein complex, where light -induced charge-separation occurs. The protein environment surrounding the cofactors of the primary electron transfer can affect the ef ciency of this process. Using method of site-directed mutagenesis we obtained the mutant RC of Rb. sphaeroides with substitution of Ile in L-177 position by His. The mutant strain forms stable photochemically active RC complexes. Spectral and photochemical properties of the mutant RC differ signi cantly in the absorption bands corresponding to the primary donor and the monomer BChl absorption. It was shown, that the pigment content in the mutant RC I(L177)H has changed. The mutant RC contains only three BChl molecules comparing to four BChl molecules in the wild type RC. EPR linewidth of the photoinduced signal of the primary donor P870 was different in the wild type and I(L177)H mutant chromatophore preparations (1.05 mT and 1.3 mT at T=10 K, respectively)",

In contrast, absorption measurement indicated the deprotonation of the Schiff base predominantly occurred at around 300 \u00b5sec after photostimuli. These results showed that the conformational changes characterizing structurally the M-intermediate predominantly occur at a later stage of the deprotonation of the Schiff base.

In parallel, functional relaxations and chemical kinetic mechanisms can be investigated. Experiments on three proteins are reported. In the L29W mutant of Myoglobin initial protein relaxations extend into the ns time-regime although the heme itself has completely relaxed even at the fastest times [Schmidt et al., 2005, PNAS, submitted]. Early relaxations are interpreted in the light of existing investigations on protein dynamics [Parak, 2003, Rep. Prog. Phys. 66 103]. From 1 ns to 1.3 ms the CO is uniformly absent from the heme iron and accumulates at the proximal Xe1 site. Final relaxation occurs in concert with the CO rebinding. The detailed analysis allows the determination of the structure of a short lived species. An almost complete description of the photocycle of the Photoactive Yellow Protein becomes possible by using timeresolved crystallography on the wild-type and mutant E46Q [Ihee et al., 2005, PNAS, in press; Rajagopal et al., 2005, Structure 13, 55]. Relaxations were analyzed by singular value decomposition. 4 relaxation times, each, were determined. By tting kinetic mechanisms the structures of photocycle intermediates were identi ed and re ned.

By neo-vascular targeting of paclitaxel-loaded cationic liposomes an improved retardation of tumor growth with respect to the conventional paclitaxel formulation was achieved [2]. We have studied the incorporation of the hydrophobic anti-cancer agent Paclitaxel (PXL) into a variety of lipid matrices by X-Ray and neutron difraction measurements. Liposome suspensions from cationic and zwitterionic lipids, comprising different molar fractions of Paclitaxel, were deposited on planar glass substrates. After drying at controlled humidity, well-ordered, oriented multilayer stacks were obtained, as proven by the presence of bilayer Bragg peaks to several orders in the re ectivity curves. The presence of the drug induced a decrease of the lipid bilayer spacing, and with an excess of drug, also Bragg peaks of drug crystals could be observed. From the results, insight into the solubility of Paclitaxel in the model membranes and an electron density prole were obtained.[1] Thurston G. et al. J Clin Invest 1998, 101.

Wintermeyer 1 1 University of Witten-Herdecke, Institute of Molecular Biology, 2 University of Witten-Herdecke, Institute of Physical Biochemistry, 3 Center of Fluorescence Spectroscopy, University of Maryland, Baltimore The signal recognition particle (SRP) initiates the co-translational targeting of proteins to the plasma membrane in bacteria by binding to the N-terminal signal sequence emerging from the translating ribosome. SRP in Escherichia coli is composed of a 48-kDa protein, called Ffh, and a 114-nucleotide RNA, called 4.5S RNA. The crystal structures of NG and M domains of Ffh and of the complex of the M domain with the RNA are known, wheras the domain arrangement in free and RNA-bound Ffh are not. We have probed the structure of E. coli Ffh and its complex with 4.5S RNA by uorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET), measuring distances between uorophores at different positions within Ffh and between Ffh and 4.5S RNA. According to the FRET distances, NG and M domains in free Ffh are closely aligned resembling the A/A arrangement in the crystal structure of Ffh from Thermus aquaticus. Upon Ffh binding to 4.5S RNA the G and M domains move apart to assume a more open con guration, as indicated by changes of FRET distances. In SRP, 4.5S RNA seems to be present in a bent, rather than extended, conformation. The domain arrangement in both free and RNA-bound Ffh differs from that in the crystal structure of the homologous Sulfolobus solfataricus SRP54 and its complex with a fragment of 4.5S RNA.

Ruysschaert Centre de Biologie Structurale et de Bioinformatique-Bruxelles-Belgium-jmruyss@ulb.ac.beMultidrug transporter proteins promote the active transmembrane ef ux of drugs thereby decreasing their accumulation in the intracellular medium. Crystallisation of these resistance proteins is a way to gain deeper insight into the resistance mechanism. To overcome dif culties related to crystallization of membrane proteins, new experimental approaches have been developed to gain information on the structural changes involved in drug transport. We examine here and illustrate with examples how infrared and uorescence spectroscopy can provide new insights into the structure and orientation of the membrane domains of transporters in particular and how ligand-protein interaction can affect the structure and orientation of transmembrane domains. We will also illustrate how such methods opens new possibilities for the detection of conformational changes that are transmitted from the cytosolic domains to the transmembrane domains and vice-versa. How lipid micro-domains modify the transmembrane structural parameters will be discussedthrough a few examples. Vigano,L, Manciu and J-M Ruysschaert Acc Chem Res. 2005 Feb;38(2):117-26.

Gu Institute of Biophysics, Chinese Academic Sciences, Beijing, China SiRNA/miRNA can ef ciently induce mRNA cleavage or translational repression at the posttranscriptional level in a sequencespeci c manner. Recently, it has been shown that these small RNAs guide genome modi cation in mammalian cells. However, their ability to direct cognate DNA methylation has been con rmed so far only in plants, and their biogenesis, functions, and modes of silencing genes are yet elusive. Here, we report that small RNAs derived from intron regions of some genes can target homologous DNA sequence in promoter, 5'UTR or 3'UTR regions of genes in different human tumor cells. Surprisingly, we also discovered that endogenous siRNAs from introns of genes possessed a large number of target mRNAs by using bioinformatics, and con rmed their existence in human cells with Northern blot analysis. Intronic small RNAs generated by sliceosomes can form mature miRNAs or siRNAs through the processing of Drosha and /or Dicer. RT-PCR analysis indicated that vector-based small RNA repressed expression of homologous genes at the transcriptional and/or translational levels. Western blotting demonstrated that the expression of some proteins was greatly reduced or completely inhibited owing to promoter methylation. These ndings reveal that the expression of some genes can incredibly control cell activities at both protein and RNA levels. Our results also suggest that these small RNAs may regulate gene expression in different modes of action.",

            "text": "Role of stacking in speci c recognition of capped RNA by the CBC protein The stacking interaction involving 7-methylguanine moiety of mRNA 5' terminal cap (m 7 G) and aromatic amino acid side chains is a common feature of all known cap-binding proteins. The crystal structures of the human Cap Binding Complex (CBC) showed its induced folding upon m 7 GpppG cap analogue binding. Stabilization of the CBC-m 7 GpppG complex by sandwich stacking of m 7 G in between Y20 and Y43 is additionally enhanced by stacking of the second base of capped mRNA with Y138. Gibbs free energy of the association of various CBC mutants with the synthetic cap analogues, m 7 GpppG, m 7 GpppU, and m 7 GTP, has been determined by uorimetric titration. Preference of the wild type (wt) CBC for the dinucleotide analogues is also observed for the Y43A mutant, with the energy loss of 0.8-1.5 kcal/mol. However, all proteins with the mutated second stacking partner Y20 prefer to bind m 7 GTP compared with m 7 GpppG. The binding of m 7 GTP to the Y20A mutant is only 0.3 kcal/mol less favourable compared with the wt CBC. These divergences may be ascribed to smaller entropic costs of conformational rearrangement of CBC in the case of a smaller ligand, which can nd more favourable contacts when its second part is not ef ciently 'constrained' by stacking with Y138. Supported by KBN 3 P04A 021 25 Annealing of the TAR DNA hairpin to a complementary TAR RNA hairpin, resulting in the formation of an extended duplex, is an essential step in the minus-strand transfer process of HIV-1 reverse transcription. In this work, we use gel-mobility-shift analysis to follow the kinetics of this reaction in the absence or presence of HIV-1 NC prepared by solid-phase peptide synthesis. To elucidate the reaction pathway, we use either the complete 59-nt TAR hairpins or truncated 27-to 32-nt minihelices (mini-TAR) derived from the top part (i.e. hairpin loop) of TAR. Assays were also carried out with mutant TAR constructs. The annealing kinetics were studied systematically as a function of DNA concentration and temperature. We show that the annealing initiates through a weak loop-loop kissing interaction, followed by a much slower conversion step, which results in formation of the extended duplex. NC facilitates both reaction steps, resulting in the overall 10 4 -fold and 10 6 -fold rate enhancement for mini-TAR and TAR annealing, respectively. We show that the kissing step is facilitated by the NC-induced nucleic acid aggregation, which is more pronounced for the longer TAR hairpins. At the same time, the conversion steps in TAR and mini-TAR appear to be very similar and are similarly facilitated by NC 10-100-fold. The later effect relays on the ability of NC to destabilize nucleic acid duplexes, and is equivalent to destabilization of a few base pairs required for the conversion initiation.",

Husimi Department of Functional Materials Science, Saitama University, Saitama, JapanIn evolutionary protein engineering, in vitro selection using a cellfree translation system has advantages of large library size and also of applicability to cytotoxic protein. Although many in vitro protein selection techniques such as in vitro virus, ribosome display are developed, most of these are the techniques that link the genotype molecule to the peptide at its Cterminus. We developed a method to link the genotype molecules to the Nterminus of its encoding peptide. The mRNA has DNA-linker hybridize region, translation enhancer, initiation codon, single codon, amber stop codon, N-terminus sequence in GFP gene, His-Tag and ochre stop codon. The mRNA is also linked at 5'-terminus to sup tRNA via spacer and the speci c amino acid. The mRNA is translated in the cell-free translation system. Thus, C-terminus of the protein becomes free. Moreover, in this system, the free protein of the full length is never generated. For this reason, the problem in the conventional technique, that is, the competition between the protein displayed on the genotype molecule and the free protein is eliminated. We succeeded to turn one round of the \" Life cycle \" of the in vitro virus, judged by His-Tag selection.",
