Proof of concept for targeting functional RNA by small molecule inhibitors has been demonstrated for multiple viruses with RNA genomes. Strategies to identify antiviral compounds as inhibitors of ncRNA are increasingly emphasizing consideration of drug-like properties of candidate molecules emerging from screening and ligand design. Recent efforts of antiviral lead discovery for RNA targets have provided drug-like small molecules that inhibit viral replication and include inhibitors of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), hepatitis C virus (HCV), severe respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS CoV), and influenza A virus. While target selectivity remains a challenge for the discovery of useful RNA-binding compounds, a better understanding is emerging of properties that define RNA targets amenable for inhibition by small molecule ligands. Insight from successful approaches of targeting viral ncRNA in HIV, HCV, SARS CoV, and influenza A will provide a basis for the future exploration of RNA targets for therapeutic intervention in other viral pathogens which create urgent, unmet medical needs.

Noncoding RNA (ncRNA) molecules are increasingly recognized as key regulatory players of biological processes 3, 4 in which they participate based on their three-dimensional structure rather than sequence. With their well-defined structure, ncRNA folds provide potentially unique interaction sites for selective small-molecule ligands that affect the RNAs' biological function. Outside the bacterial ribosome, untranslated RNA regions as drug targets have been pursued to discover therapeutics for viral infections including those caused by the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) 5 and hepatitis C virus (HCV). 6 These pathogens have single-stranded RNA genomes which include structured noncoding regions that play key roles in the viral infection cycle and harbor potential binding sites for small molecule inhibitors. The high conservation of untranslated regions in viral genomes along with the absence of homologous host cell RNAs render structured viral regulatory RNAs attractive targets for the development of novel antiinfective drugs. 7, 8 Unlike typical inhibitor binding pockets in proteins, sites for ligand recognition in RNA are often shallow, highly solvated, and conformationally flexible. Therefore, structural and physicochemical properties of small molecule ligands for RNA differ markedly from drugs targeting proteins. 9 Clinically used RNA-binding antibiotics are derived from natural products which, on average, are structurally more complex, more hydrophilic, and contain a larger number of hydrogen bond donors compared to druglike compounds. 10 These molecular properties create challenges in reconciling the design and optimization of RNA-binding ligands with drug-like features affecting absorption and distribution in vivo. Strategies for the design and discovery of RNA-binding ligands have been outlined long before the rise of ncRNA, [11] [12] [13] and comprehensive reviews on targeting RNA with small molecules have been published regularly over the last years.

Aminoglycosides and their semi-synthetic derivatives have been reported to promiscuously bind numerous ncRNA targets 9, 14, 15 including regulatory elements from HIV, which over two decades ago were the first viral RNAs to be investigated for small-molecule inhibition. [18] [19] [20] It has been suggested that aminoglycosides bind to RNA folds through structural electrostatic complementarity whereby positively charged ammonium groups of the ligand recognize metal-ionbinding pockets created by the RNA architecture. 21, 22 Similarly, promiscuous binding to structured RNA has been observed for intercalating compounds which contain flat aromatic scaffolds such as acridine, phenazine and phenothiazine derivatives. While early ligand-binding studies of ncRNA focused on proof of concept and often involved promiscuous binders including aminoglycosides and intercalators, more recently, considerations of compounds' drug-likeness have been prominently included in RNA targeting efforts.

The review of recently discovered ligands targeting viral RNA will include a discussion of compounds' physicochemical properties that affect drug-likeness. long been known to interfere with translation, 24 and these compounds provided powerful tools in the elucidation of ribosome function. 25 After decades of mounting evidence that ribosome-inhibiting antibiotics do so by targeting the RNA components (rRNA), 26 Moazed and Noller demonstrated in 1987 that several classes of antibiotics bind directly to 16S rRNA. These observations spurred efforts both in academia and pharmaceutical industry to discover small molecule ligands of other structured RNAs. The HIV transactivation response (TAR) and Rev response (RRE) RNA were the first viral regulatory elements shown to bind small molecule compounds that interfered with key steps of HIV infection. [18] [19] [20] [27] [28] [29] [30] The realization that the repertoire of therapeutic approaches to combat infections may be expanded to inhibitors targeting viral RNA components quickly gave birth to the notion of RNA as an emerging drug target. 11, 31 Since then, intervention by small molecules binding to ncRNA elements has been explored for several viruses (Table 1) . HIV remains the most intensely studied virus, for which multiple other functional RNA structures in the genome besides the TAR and RRE sites have been investigated as targets for small molecule ligands. These include the dimer initiation sequence (DIS), the packaging signal (\u03a8), and the Gag/Pol frameshifting signal. Previous reviews, including a comprehensive article by Le Grice, 5 cover the literature on efforts targeting HIV RNA up to the year 2014. [32] [33] [34] More recent studies on discovery of inhibitors targeting the TAR and RRE RNA by screening and scaffold-based design will be discussed in the following section ( Figure 3 and Table 2 ). Like HIV, HCV carries a (+) single-strand RNA genome, which is not reverse transcribed, but directly serves as a coding mRNA for viral proteins. Translation of the HCV genome is driven by a structured RNA element in the 5 0 untranslated region (UTR) which serves as an internal ribosome entry site (IRES). A subdomain of the HCV IRES functions as a conformational switch which has been identified as the target site for small molecule inhibitors capturing an extended conformation of the RNA and thereby blocking viral translation. 40 A previous review by Dibrov et al. describes the discovery of HCV IRESdirected inhibitors and structural as well as mechanism-of-action studies that established the conformational switch motif as a privileged target site for antiviral RNA-binders. 6 In this review, I will BOX 1", "cite_spans": [{"start": 605, "end": 607, "text": "24", "ref_id": "BIBREF23"}, {"start": 693, "end": 695, "text": "25", "ref_id": "BIBREF24"}, {"start": 814, "end": 816, "text": "26", "ref_id": "BIBREF25"}, {"start": 1255, "end": 1259, "text": "[18]", "ref_id": "BIBREF17"}, {"start": 1260, "end": 1264, "text": "[19]", "ref_id": "BIBREF18"}, {"start": 1265, "end": 1269, "text": "[20]", "ref_id": "BIBREF19"}, {"start": 1270, "end": 1274, "text": "[27]", "ref_id": "BIBREF26"}, {"start": 1275, "end": 1279, "text": "[28]", "ref_id": "BIBREF27"}, {"start": 1280, "end": 1284, "text": "[29]", "ref_id": "BIBREF28"}, {"start": 1285, "end": 1289, "text": "[30]", "ref_id": "BIBREF29"}, {"start": 1502, "end": 1505, "text": "11,", "ref_id": "BIBREF10"}, {"start": 1506, "end": 1508, "text": "31", "ref_id": "BIBREF30"}, {"start": 2085, "end": 2089, "text": "[32]", "ref_id": "BIBREF31"}, {"start": 2090, "end": 2094, "text": "[33]", "ref_id": "BIBREF32"}, {"start": 2095, "end": 2099, "text": "[34]", "ref_id": "BIBREF33"}, {"start": 2817, "end": 2819, "text": "40", "ref_id": "BIBREF39"}, {"start": 3068, "end": 3069, "text": "6", "ref_id": "BIBREF5"}], "ref_spans": [{"start": 1617, "end": 1626, "text": "(Table 1)", "ref_id": "TABREF1"}, {"start": 2261, "end": 2269, "text": "Figure 3", "ref_id": "FIGREF0"}, {"start": 2274, "end": 2281, "text": "Table 2", "ref_id": "TABREF2"}], "section": "INTRODUCTION"}, {"text": "ClogP, is the calculated logarithm of the partition coefficient between n-octanol and water as a measure of compound hydrophilicity.

These earlier efforts have been summarized in several excellent reviews. 5, 14, 15, 32, 34 More recently, Schneekloth and coworkers have applied small molecule microarray (SMM) screening of a fluorescently labeled TAR hairpin model oligonucleotide to identify selective binders. 36 A similar approach had been taken before by Disney and Seeberger to explore interactions of aminoglycosides with ribosomal A-site and group I intron ribozyme RNA. 51 In the recent study on HIV TAR, the microarray-immobilized screening library was composed of 20,000 drug-like small molecules that were not biased for chemotypes considered to promote RNA binding. A counter-screen was applied against an unrelated RNA hairpin to exclude promiscuous binders.

The unique role of the viral IRES and its high conservation in clinical isolates has led to recognition of this ncRNA as a potential drug target. 60, 61 High throughput screening of over 200,000 compounds for inhibition of IRES function in cell-based reporter translation assays led to the discovery of phenazine derivatives 62 and biaryl guanidines 63 which had moderate selectivity for the viral translation target. While the structures of compounds from these chemical series suggest that they may interact with the IRES RNA, target binding or antiviral activity were not reported in these early studies. An important breakthrough was achieved by Seth and colleagues who used mass spectrometry-based screening of 180,000 compounds to identify 2aminobenzimidazole derivatives as ligands binding the internal loop RNA of subdomain IIa in the HCV IRES (Figure 4(a) ). 41 Lead optimization driven by structure-activity relationship data furnished compound 6 ( Table 3) which had an affinity of 0.9 \u03bcM (K d ) for the IRES target (determined by mass spectrometry) and inhibited HCV in cell culture with an EC 50 value of 3.9 \u03bcM while showing no cytotoxicity up to 100 \u03bcM concentration. 41 Mechanism of action studies of 2-aminobenzimidazoles revealed that these compounds act as allosteric inhibitors of an RNA conformational switch in the IRES subdomain IIa. 40 In contrast to metabolite-sensing riboswitches, the HCV IRES subdomain IIa motif is representative of a new class of RNA conformational switches that are structurally well-defined in both ligand-free and bound states and may represent the simplest form of ligand-responsive, purely mechanical switches in nucleic acids. 64 The synthetic benzimidazoles are fortuitous ligands of a recognition site for guanosine, 65 and capture the subdomain IIa target in an extended conformation which blocks viral translation initiation by the IRES element. X-ray crystallography has provided structural insight into the conformational states of the subdomain IIa switch in the absence 66 and presence 42 of inhibitor ligand. In the extended conformation of the switch, the bound inhibitor is encapsulated by a deep solvent-excluded RNA pocket that resembles ligand interaction sites in aptamers and riboswitches (Figure 4(b) and (c)). Depth, structural complexity, and physicochemical properties of the ligand binding pocket distinguish the IRES IIa switch from other viral RNA targets and suggest that discovery of drug-like inhibitors is feasible. A FRET-based assay (Box 2) was developed to investigate ligand binding to subdomain IIa and screen for viral translation inhibitors that capture the RNA switch in an extended state. 40, 43 In a different assay, which monitors fluorescence changes of a nucleoside analog (Box 2) incorporated in the internal loop of subdomain IIa, diaminopiperidines such as compound 9 (Table 3) were found to bind the IRES target as well. 46 Unlike the 2-aminobenzimidazoles, the diaminopiperidine ligands lock the RNA conformational switch in a bent state and thereby inhibit viral translation initiation. A recent review summarizes comprehensively studies on 2-aminobenzimidazole and diaminopiperidine HCV translation inhibitors. 6 The diaminopiperidines are hydrophilic compounds which contain numerous hydrogen bond donors, which suggests that polar interactions play an important role for RNA target recognition. As a consequence, binding affinity of compounds such as 9 for the subdomain IIa RNA target decreases with ionic strength of the medium. 46 In contrast, 2aminobenzimidazoles such as inhibitor 6 have more drug-like properties, but contain basic amino groups that are positively charged under physiological conditions. Moreover, construction of the pyran ring in Opinion wires.wiley.com/rna 6 required a lengthy synthetic route that hampered a deep exploration of this chemical series. 41, 67 We have recently designed second generation ligands for the guanosine binding pocket in the HCV IRES subdomain IIa target which address the shortcomings of the original 2-aminobenzimidazole derivatives. In an approach to maintain the nonplanarity of benzimidazole ligands, which is introduced by the sp 3 carbon centers in the pyran ring of ligands such as 6, we have designed N1-coupled aryl derivatives represented by compound 7. Sterical hindrance of the N1 aryl substituent induces a twisted conformation with an overall nonplanar shape of the resulting compounds. 44 In another set of analogs, we have replaced the basic imidazole ring in the first generation ligands with the less basic oxazole system. 45 The resulting ligands, exemplified by compound 8, were accessible through straightforward synthetic routes and displayed good drug-like properties. However, none of the synthesized N1-coupled aryl benzimidazoles 44 68 However, synthesis or testing of the in silico designed compounds was not reported. The structural plasticity of the HCV IRES subdomain IIa illustrates the challenges facing computational approaches for RNA targets in general. Large conformational changes in the IIa RNA target upon ligand binding, accompanied by extensive rearrangement of base stacking, were unexpected and likely beyond the predictive ability of current computational approaches. The relative success of MD studies reproducing the conformational rearrangement and benzimidazole ligand binding of the IIa RNA 68,69 may be attributed to the fact that experimental waypoints in the form of high-resolution crystal structures were available to guide the calculations. Challenges of large conformational changes in RNA targets are compounded by the dominant electrostatic interactions in the anionic polymer and concurrent impact of counter-ion binding and hydration, 70 which are recognized as the Achilles' heel of computational approaches for RNA. 71 While this review focuses on small molecule ligands with a molecular weight <750 D, brief mention should be made of copper-binding metallopeptides that have been developed to target domains of the HCV IRES and damage the RNA through metal-catalyzed cleavage. [72] [73] [74] These peptides contain a conserved 3-amino acid motif of Gly-Gly-His which coordinates Cu, linked to a recognition sequence that confers RNA target binding specificity. Cumetallopeptides with 7-27 amino acids have been reported to bind IRES domains and inhibit HCV in cell culture with submicromolar affinity.

Translational frameshifting is triggered by the interplay of two RNA motifs which include a slippery sequence where the reading frame change occurs, followed by a structured region that stalls the ribosome. The structured frameshift motif in HIV consists of a long RNA hairpin with an internal loop, which has been explored in ligand targeting approaches that were aimed at stabilizing or disrupting the RNA fold. Earlier studies on the HIV target have been discussed in recent comprehensive reviews by Le Grice, Brakier-Gingras, and coworkers. 5, 33 In SARS CoV, translation of viral proteins required for replication including the RNAdependent RNA polymerase is initiated by a \u22121 programmed frameshift which is triggered by a threestemmed RNA PK ( Figure 5 ). 76, 77 Park and colleagues used an in silico screening approach to identify ligands of the SARS CoV PK. 47 Since the three-dimensional structure of the target has not been determined yet, docking of compounds was performed to a model of the RNA PK. Among hit compounds identified in the screen, the drug-like 1,4-diazepane derivative 10 ('MTDB', Table 4 ) was reported as an inhibitor of translational frameshifting both in vitro and in a cell-based assay (IC 50 = 0.45 \u03bcM). 47 Direct interaction of 10 with the SARS CoV PK was demonstrated recently by Ritchie and coworkers who measured ligand binding to the RNA target by surface plasmon resonance (SPR) and determined a K d of 210 \u03bcM. 50 They went on to perform single-molecule unfolding experiments with the PK in the absence and presence of 10, which led to the conclusion that ligand binding reduces the conformational plasticity of the RNA fold and thereby affects ribosomal frameshifting. Efficiency of frameshifting is not determined by thermodynamic stability of the PK or impact on ribosomal pausing but rather by the ability of the RNA fold to adopt alternate conformations and structures. 78 Therefore, ligand binding may affect translational frameshifting through a complex mechanism that only partially relies on stabilization of the PK RNA. For some of the previously identified inhibitors of HIV translational \u22121 frameshifting, it has been suggested that their promiscuous RNA-binding ability may affect ribosomal RNA rather than the viral genomic frameshifting signal. 33 Interaction with multiple targets may play a role for the inhibitory action of 10 as well, which may account for the over 450-fold higher potency of this compound as a frameshifting inhibitor in a cell-based assay 47 compared to its RNA binding affinity. 50", "cite_spans": [{"start": 185, "end": 187, "text": "75", "ref_id": "BIBREF74"}, {"start": 967, "end": 969, "text": "5,", "ref_id": "BIBREF4"}, {"start": 970, "end": 972, "text": "33", "ref_id": "BIBREF32"}, {"start": 1184, "end": 1187, "text": "76,", "ref_id": "BIBREF75"}, {"start": 1188, "end": 1190, "text": "77", "ref_id": "BIBREF76"}, {"start": 1288, "end": 1290, "text": "47", "ref_id": "BIBREF46"}, {"start": 1659, "end": 1661, "text": "47", "ref_id": "BIBREF46"}, {"start": 1872, "end": 1874, "text": "50", "ref_id": "BIBREF49"}, {"start": 2336, "end": 2338, "text": "78", "ref_id": "BIBREF77"}, {"start": 2721, "end": 2723, "text": "33", "ref_id": "BIBREF32"}], "ref_spans": [{"start": 1172, "end": 1180, "text": "Figure 5", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1530, "end": 1537, "text": "Table 4", "ref_id": "TABREF4"}], "section": "SARS CoV Frameshifting PK"}, {"text": "The influenza A orthomyxovirus harbors a singlestranded RNA genome that contains eight negativesense segments (vRNA) which encode the viral proteins and are used as templates for transcription to mRNA and replication into complementary strands (cRNA).

In this review, I have discussed recent progress in the discovery of small molecule-targeting approaches directed at structured RNA motifs in the genomes of HIV, HCV, SARS CoV, and influenza A, which represent a variety of virus families. Regulatory sequences in viral genomes and transcripts stand out for their conservation in clinical isolates which promise a high barrier to resistance development against inhibitors targeting these structured RNA elements. Nevertheless, criteria of drugability have to be thoughtfully applied to select RNA targets for small molecules in the development of novel antiviral therapies. Such considerations are more important than ever in light of an unprecedented surge of new ncRNA species emerging as key participants in biological processes. 4 Structurally well-defined, deep and solvent-excluded ligand binding pockets are rare in RNA folds but provide the most promising opportunities for discovery of drug-like inhibitors on par with drugs targeting viral proteins. Among the viral RNA motifs discussed here, the HCV IRES subdomain IIa perhaps best embodies such advantageous characteristics of a drug target, but is also unique with respect to its function as a conformational switch that harbors a proper ligand binding pocket. Similar RNA switch motifs have been discovered in over 10 other flaviand picornaviruses, 64 however, none of which rise to a level of threat as a human pathogen comparable to HCV.

A variety of potential drug targets in structured RNA elements is also found in filoviruses, which include the etiologic agents of Ebola and Marburg hemorrhagic fever. Replication of these negative-sense RNA viruses relies on a structured RNA promoter element that consists of a large hairpin involving nucleotides 1-55 in the 5 0 terminus of the viral genome whose secondary structure has been established by chemical probing. 98, 99 The 3 0 terminus of the filovirus genome does not interact with the 5 0 end, unlike in the RNA promoter of influenza A virus which also has a negative-sense ssRNA genome. Filovirus genomes consist of a nonsegmented RNA that encodes reading frames for seven structural proteins which are separated by long intergenic regions (IGR). The IGR between virus proteins VP30 and VP24 has been suggested to fold into a two-armed stem-loop structure that includes a complex RNA four-way junction. 101 Transcription of viral genes involves the VP30 nucleocapsid protein as an antitermination factor that binds to a hairpin loop at the transcription start site. 102 ,103 Viral transcripts have long 5 0 UTR elements that derive from the IGR and contain hairpin loop structures which may play a role in transcriptional regulation and translational control. 109 Examples of attractive RNA targets for ligand inhibition are also found in DNA viruses. Among them is the oncogenic Kaposi's sarcoma associated herpesvirus (KSHV) which is a common cause of malignancies in AIDS patients. Translation of the viral homolog of the FLICE inhibitory protein (vFLIP), a key player involved in KSHV-induced tumorigenesis, 110 is initiated at an IRES element that adopts a complex RNA secondary structure including a conserved segment of 252 nucleotides. 104, 111 Functional and chemical probing analysis of the vFLIP IRES revealed an independently folding RNA core domain linked to flexibly linked hairpin motifs which provide several structurally well-defined sites for ligand targeting. 106 KSHV also encodes a 1077 nucleotide polyadenylated nuclear (PAN) ncRNA, which is the most abundant transcript produced from the viral genome during lytic replication. 107 PAN RNA is essential for viral propagation, and its accumulation relies on posttranscriptional stabilization involving a cis-acting RNA motif which acts as an enhancer of nuclear retention element (ENE). 112 The ENE is a 79 nucleotide motif in the PAN 3 0 terminus which sequesters in cis the PAN poly(A) tail in a unique triple helix structure that protects the ncRNA from decay and leads to accumulation of PAN. 113 Both, the ENE hairpin structure, which contains a uridine-rich, large internal loop, and the ENE-poly(A) triple helix complex are potential targets for small molecule ligands that may interfere with KSHV replication. One final example for a tractable RNA target in a DNA virus is the pregenomic RNA (pgRNA) of Hepatitis B virus (HBV) which serves as an intermediate template in viral replication through reverse transcription. 114 Prior to reverse transcription, the HBV pgRNA is sequestered together with polymerase into subviral particles. Both encapsidation and initiation of reverse transcriptase require a conserved sequence in the 5 0 terminal region of the pgRNA which folds into a stem loop structure with a uridine-rich internal loop referred to as the epsilon encapsidation signal. 108, [115] [116] [117] While small molecule ligands of this RNA motif have not been reported yet, RNA decoys of the epsilon sequence have been developed that sequester reverse transcriptase, which provided proof-of-principle that disruption of the pgRNA-polymerase interaction suppresses HBV replication. 118 In conclusion, while preventive vaccines and drugs that target well-characterized viral proteins such as polymerases and proteases are proven routes to antiviral therapy, structured RNA motifs in viral genomes and transcripts provide new opportunities to expand the repertoire of targets for the development of antiinfective therapy. Selection of viral structured RNA elements for inhibitor discovery requires critical evaluation for properties that define targets for drug-like ligands. After all, just as some proteins that participate as key players in disease processes have been unyielding to the development of small molecule inhibitors, not all structured RNA elements are amenable to targeting with low molecular weight ligands. If the currently known target space for biologically active small molecules from natural product sources is of any guidance, RNA targets certainly do not appear among the low hanging fruits for drug discovery. Nevertheless, the area of antiinfective drugs provides a strong record for successful examples of RNA-directed inhibitors. The bacterial ribosome is the target for over half of all natural products that are known to exhibit antibiotic activity and the majority of these compounds interact predominantly with the rRNA components. While the bacterial ribosome looms large as a paradigm of structured RNA providing a valuable target for antiinfective drugs, recently, a bacterial riboswitch RNA", "cite_spans": [{"start": 842,
