It is undetermined how many of these patients would have abnormalities on computed tomography (CT) scans, because no randomized head-to-head comparisons have been published so far. In patients persistently febrile after >48 h of broad-spectrum antibacterial therapy, \u223c10% of chest radiographs are abnormal, whereas high-resolution CT scans at this time reveal pathological findings in \u223c50% of patients [5, 6]. Early detection of lesions indicating invasive mold infection or Pneumocystis pneumonia (PcP) is of utmost importance, facilitating targeted bronchoscopy and bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) and a prompt institution of pre-emptive antimicrobial treatment [7., 8., 9.], enabling better survival of these patients. CT findings such as consolidation, \u2018halo sign\u2019 and \u2018air-crescent sign\u2019, obtained by high-resolution or multislice CT scans, may be important signs of filamentous fungal disease [8, 10]. While the \u2018halo sign\u2019 has been described typically in neutropenic patients, other CT findings indicative of IPA are comparable in neutropenic and in non-neutropenic patients [11]. A \u2018reversed halo sign\u2019, showing a focal rounded area of ground-glass opacity surrounded by a crescent or complete ring of consolidation, has been reported as relatively specific for fungal pneumonia due to zygomycetes/mucorales [8]; however, it may represent a broad spectrum of other differential diagnoses including tuberculosis, sarcoidosis or cryptogenic organizing pneumonia [12].",

Diffuse bilateral perihilar infiltrates, patchy areas of ground-glass attenuation (peripheral sparing), cysts and septal thickening, consolidation and centrilobular nodules may indicate PcP [19., 20., 21.]. Nodular or cavitary lesions are suggestive of invasive filamentous fungal infection; however, differential diagnoses include pneumonia due to other microorganisms including mycobacteria [22] (which may be relevant in regions with high prevalence), Nocardia, Pneumocystis or Pseudomonas aeruginosa (P. aeruginosa) as well as lung involvement by underlying malignancies [23], so that comparison to previous CT scans in an individual patient is essential. Combination of CT scan with angiography has been found to increase the diagnostic specificity in some patients with pulmonary mold infections [24, 25]; however, this more labor intensive method has not yet become widely applied and is therefore not included into current clinical practice guidelines. In selected patients where pulmonary CT scan is not wanted or feasible, magnetic resonance tomography (MRI) is a valid alternative (B-II) [26, 27]. As yet, consensus definitions of invasive fungal diseases [10] have not included thoracic MRI findings. In selected patients with unexplained fever during neutropenia, [18F]2-fluoro-2-deoxy-D-glucose\u2013positron emission tomography combined with computed tomography (PET-CT) may be helpful, particularly to rule out undetected infection [28].",

Reduction of the \u2018halo\u2019 and the development of an \u2018air-crescent\u2019 sign, however, typically indicate favorable response [30].",

In microbiologically documented cases, pathogens typically are isolated from blood cultures, bronchial secretions or BAL fluid. It often means a challenge to assess the diagnostic relevance of culture results [31., 32., 33., 34.], because unselected bronchial samples from these patients grow colonizing and contaminating microorganisms with no etiological significance [35], or blood cultures may show isolates not etiologically related to pneumonias. At the same time, if autopsies show invasive fungal infections, 75% of them have not been detected ante mortem [36, 37]. Therefore, in contrast to the majority of other microbiological findings, isolation of Aspergillus spp. or other filamentous fungi from upper respiratory tract specimens of severely immunocompromised patients typically indicates a respiratory tract mycosis [38].",

The detection rate of potential pathogens from BAL samples has been described to be 25%\u201350% or even higher [11, 40., 41., 42.], depending on the risk profile of patients included. A retrospective analysis of microbiological findings from BAL samples in cancer patients with LI showed 34% bacteria, 22% cytomegalovirus (CMV), 15% Pneumocystis jirovecii (P. jirovecii) and 2% Aspergillus spp. [43], and another report of 246 bronchoscopies in 199 febrile patients with hematological malignancies described pathogens with possible etiological significance in 48% of samples, of which 70 samples grew only bacteria, 13 showed both fungi and bacteria, 15 samples Aspergillus spp., 16 samples Candida species and 2 samples both Aspergillus and Candida spp. [33]. Many LI in severely immunocompromised patients may also have polymicrobial etiology [34], with molds (predominantly Aspergillus spp.) plus bacteria in 12% and multiple fungal species in 22% of samples. Although the etiological relevance of BAL findings may be questionable in many cases, the results trigger the change of antimicrobial treatment in up to 50% of patients [33, 44, 45]. As a diagnostic \u2018gold standard\u2019 is lacking, the number of false-positive and false-negative findings are unknown, and the rates of success or failure of \u2018pathogen-directed\u2019 antimicrobial treatment therefore remain undetermined.

A meta-analysis showed a very high sensitivity of 99% and a specificity of 90% [69], so that a negative Pneumocystis-PCR from a BAL sample at the time of diagnosis allows to put aside anti-Pneumocystis therapy [70]. More recently developed quantitative PCR assays appear to increase the specificity [71, 72]. A report on 71 non-HIV patients with proven PcP showed a positive predictive value of 98% when >1450 pathogens per ml were detected in BAL samples [73].

A positive (i.e. >0.5 OD) GM test from blood or from BAL samples, where a cutoff of \u22651.0 might be more appropriate [82], has been accepted as a significant finding indicating a probable invasive fungal infection in severely immunocompromised patients [83, 84]. It is questionable if Aspergillus GM in blood will become positive earlier than a chest CT scan [85]. Notably, the GM test may give false-positive results in patients treated with semisynthetic \u03b2-lactam antibiotics such as amoxicillin\u2013clavulanate, piperacillin\u2013tazobactam, carbapenems, ceftriaxone or cefepime [86, 87] as well as in those given enteral nutrition [88], those with other fungal infections such as fusariosis [89] and in BAL samples obtained using specific lavage solutions such as Plasmalyte\u2122 [90]. False-positive Aspergillus antigenemia may also be due to blood product conditioning fluids [91]. A significant decline in the galactomannan Aspergillus antigen signal was described during storage of serum samples, in contrast to BAL samples, so that the time from taking a blood sample to testing should be minimized [92].",

PCR presumably will become part of a diagnostic program for LI, including thoracic CT scans, serology and conventional microbiology from blood and BAL samples [100].

Antipseudomonal \u03b2-lactams suitable for treatment of P. aeruginosa pneumonia are piperacillin (\u00b1tazobactam), ceftazidime, imipenem/cilastatin, meropenem and cefepime (A-I). Depending on their in vitro susceptibility pattern, multi-resistant Gram-negative aerobes such as extended-spectrum-\u03b2-lactamase-(ESBL-) producing E. coli, Enterobacter spp. or Klebsiella spp. as well as Acinetobacter spp. or P. aeruginosa require antimicrobial treatment selected appropriately according to this pattern (A-II). Pharmacokinetic aspects (penetration to lung tissue, possible inactivation by surfactant) must always be included in this selection (A-II). In individual patients with pneumonia caused by multi-resistant Gram-negative pathogens, aerosolized colistin has been successfully used as a part of the antimicrobial strategy [132]. Stenotrophomonas maltophilia (S. maltophilia) rarely causes pneumonia, while it is more frequently isolated from respiratory secretions representing selection of opportunistic microorganisms under broad-spectrum antibacterial treatment. In patients with suspected or documented S. maltophilia pneumonia, early antimicrobial intervention with high-dose TMP/SMX (15\u201320 mg/kg/day of trimethoprim) is recommended (B-II) [133, 134]. In individual patients, tigecycline-based treatment may be an appropriate alternative (C-II) [135]. It should be kept in mind that in vitro susceptibility may not predict clinical efficacy of antimicrobial agents in S. maltophilia infections [136].",

Intravenous voriconazole (6 mg/kg every 12 h day 1, 4 mg/kg every 12 h thereafter) (A-I) or liposomal amphotericin B (3 mg/kg/day) (A-II) are recommended first-line choices for treatment of IPA. For mucormycosis (zygomycosis), liposomal amphotericin B is preferred (A-II), the recommended dose is \u22655 mg/kg/day (A-II). In patients with worsening LI and gas exchange within the first week of treatment, failure of antifungal therapy should only be considered if new LI emerge on control CT scans (B-III). At the same time, other causes such as a second infection, immune reconstitution syndrome, infiltrates caused by the underlying malignancy, toxicity from cancer treatment or yet insufficient duration of antifungal treatment should be ruled out (B-III) [146, 147]. Combination antifungal first-line treatment in patients with invasive mold infections is controversial. A prospective clinical study comparing voriconazole alone with the combination of voriconazole with anidulafungin in patients with proven and probable aspergillosis has not yet been published in detail [148]. For treatment of mucormycosis, a combination of liposomal amphotericin B and an echinocandin may be promising [149, 150]; however, randomized studies on this subject have not been conducted. A combination of liposomal amphotericin B and the iron chelator deferasirox for the treatment of mucormycoses has shown inferior clinical results for the combination when compared with the antifungal agent alone [151].",

In mild-to-moderate cases (oxygen partial pressure pO2 \u226570 mmHg or alveolar-arterial oxygen difference AaDO2 <45 mmHg) an oral therapy can be discussed, otherwise it should be administered i.v. In patients with proven PcP, treatment with TMP/SMX should be continued for at least 2 weeks (A-II). Clinical improvement should develop within 8 days, otherwise a second infection should be considered and diagnostic procedures repeated. In individual patients with persistent PcP, mutations in the genes for dihydropteroate synthase or dihydrofolate reductase may be taken into consideration [154., 155., 156., 157.]. In case of treatment failure or TMP/SMX intolerance, atovaquone oral suspension (750 mg twice times daily with meal), i.v. pentamidine (4 mg/kg daily) or clindamycin (600 mg four times daily or 900 mg three times daily i.v.) plus primaquine (30 mg daily p.o.) may represent treatment alternatives [158], with clindamycin + primaquine presumably being the most effective option (C-III) [159]. Glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency must be excluded before administration of dapsone or primaquine (A-I). Subsequently, patients should be given secondary prophylaxis (A-II) using oral TMP/SMX at a daily dosage of 160/800 mg given on 3 days per week (B-II) or with monthly pentamidine inhalation at a dose of 300 mg (B-II) [160, 161]. In patients with respiratory failure due to PcP, systemic corticosteroids may be beneficial in AIDS patients, but data are conflicting in non-HIV patients [162, 163]. Recent studies could not show a clinical benefit [164] and were even associated with increased mortality [165].",

Neutropenic patients with respiratory failure due to LI may have a favorable outcome under appropriate intensive care including mechanical ventilation [169., 170., 171.]. Even if respiratory failure is due to IPA, survival can be achieved in around one third of patients [172]. It is therefore not justified to reject cancer patients from intensive care only because of their underlying malignancy [173]. Multidisciplinary care involving hematology-oncology professionals should be provided during intensive care treatment of these patients (A-II). Intensive care should unrestrictedly be provided to patients with respiratory failure (A-II), except from those whose prognosis is desperate due to other reasons or who have given a personal directive in order to abstain from it.",
