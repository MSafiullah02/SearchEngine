It has been demonstrated that melittin, which is discovered in honey bee venom, can inhibit tobacco mosaic virus (Marcos et al., 1995), herpes simplex virus (HSV; Baghian et al., 1997), and human immunodeficiency virus 1 (HIV-1; Wachinger et al., 1998) replication. Cecropins can contribute to an inhibition of HIV-1 (Wachinger et al., 1998). Some of the magainins also showed significant reduction of HSV plaque-forming units. Moreover, it was reported that dermaseptin S4, which was isolated from the skin of rhacophorus, can inhibit cell-free and cell-associated HIV-1 infection of P4-CCR5 indicator cells and human primary T lymphocytes (Lorin et al., 2005). Indolicidin, which was isolated from bovine neutrophil, was shown to reduce virus infectivity remarkably, including HSV-1, HSV-2, and Arenavirus Junin virus (Albiol Matanic and Castilla, 2004). Recently, some studies confirmed that human \u03b1-defensin 1, 2, and 3 can contribute to anti-HIV-1 activity after viral entry (Zhang et al., 2002; Chang et al., 2003). More recently, we isolated a swine intestine antimicrobial peptide (SIAMP) from the small intestines of pig and also we have evaluated its antibacterial activity (Wang et al., 2009).",

Its molecular weight is 3,339 Da and it is highly sensitive to Escherichia coli, Salmonella, Actinomycete, and pyesis Streptococcus (Lee et al., 1989). Subsequently, another antimicrobial peptide, PR-39, characterized a 31-residue antibacterial peptide with activity against E. coli K12 and several other gram-negative bacteria and was isolated from swine intestine (Agerberth et al., 1991). Recently, a 78-residue antimicrobial, NK-lysin, was purified from pig small intestine; NK-lysin showed high antibacterial activity against E. coli and Bacillus megaterium and moderate activity against Acinetobacter calcoaceticus and Streptococcus pyogenes (Andersson et al., 1995). More recently, we have isolated a novel SIAMP and demonstrated that the molecular weight of this peptide was 5,972 Da (Wang et al., 2009). To our knowledge, little work has been conducted on the antiviral activity of SIAMP. Thus, the present study was designed to investigate the effect of SIAMP on the anti-IBV infection of SPF chick embryos.",

Our results confirmed that 36 h postinoculation, the embryo began to die. The dead embryos were observed runting, curling, and misshaping, with compression of feet overhead. This is consistent with a previous report about the pathological changes caused by IBV (Escorcia et al., 2002). Interestingly, we found that the embryos in the SIAMP-treated group were normal, and no evident difference was present compared with the control. Furthermore, the mortality induced by IBV was reduced remarkably after embryos were pretreated with SIAMP. These findings suggested that when embryos were pretreated with SIAMP, the infectivity of IBV was reduced. This may be explained by the fact that preincubation with peptides may prevent viral fusion to target cells and reduce the IBV infectivity. However, the underlying mechanism of the antiviral activity of SIAMP remains unclear.",

The virus is primarily epitheliotropic and enters the epithelial cells by viropexis (Patterson and Bingham, 1976). The mechanism behind this may be that SIAMP can interact with IBV and block the binding of IBV to epithelial cells of embryos. Therefore, the virus cannot replicate in host cells. This may be the reason why there was no evident difference between the SIAMP-pretreated and the control group embryos. More interestingly, the embryo weight in the SIAMP-treated group was significantly higher than the IBV group or the control group. It is possible that SIAMP may contribute to the growth of the embryos as reported previously (Liu et al., 2008; Bao et al., 2009; Wang et al., 2009).",
