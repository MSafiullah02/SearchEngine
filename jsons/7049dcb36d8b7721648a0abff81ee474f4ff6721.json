They are a considerable burden in terms of both patient morbidity and public health interventions. Laboratory diagnosis of respiratory tract infections should provide guidance in therapy and prognosis, as well as useful epidemiological information reflecting trends in the community. Understanding and monitoring such trends facilitates early recognition of new infectious agents in a population. A summary of the common viruses and bacteria causing respiratory tract infections and their clinical relevance is given in Tables 41-1 and 41-2,  respectively. Even with a significant clinical effort and analysis of multiple specimens, current laboratory methods fail to diagnose approximately half of lower respiratory tract infections. In fact, laboratory diagnosis of communityacquired pneumonia (CAP) is so poor that current clinical practice guidelines do not recommend testing for all but the most severely affected patients and advise use of empiric therapy. 1 This pragmatic approach fails to address issues of antimicrobial overuse and resistance, public health surveillance, and advancement of medical knowledge.",

Despite vaccination policies, Bordetella pertussis infection remains relatively common in children and adults and is associated with chronic cough in adults. 2 Mycoplasma pneumoniae, Legionella pneumophila, and Chlamydophilia (previously Chlamydia) pneumoniae are all recognized causes of lower respiratory tract infections, but again, their impact has not been studied in detail. In addition, despite the well-recognized association of viral infections with upper and lower respiratory tract infections, the current diagnostic virology procedures do not provide an answer rapidly enough to with parainfluenza virus type 4, human coronaviruses, rhinoviruses, and some enteroviruses would not ordinarily be identified without RNA detection methods. The impact of such infections is only just being realized, and there is probably an underestimation of their clinical importance, particularly for immunocompromised individuals, the elderly, or those with underlying conditions such as asthma. 5, 6 Human metapneumovirus has been confirmed as an important cause of severe lower respiratory tract infection. The virus has been circulating for more than 50 years, and studies using molecular assays have confirmed its wide distribution, 7,8 but many laboratories have not been successful in isolating this virus. The recent identification of the agent causing severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), known as SARS-CoV, has illustrated the need for expansion of diagnostic testing to encompass new emerging viruses and the limitations of conventional virological laboratory approaches to respiratory pathogen diagnosis. 9, 10 Even if it is possible to culture viruses efficiently, isolation and confirmation of the cause of a cytopathic effect can take days to weeks, depending on the pathogen. Waiting for a culture-positive result can take many days, during which time the patient may be inappropriately treated and, if hospitalized, infection control measures may not be initiated. Also, the use of primary primate cells in culture (which gives the best yields of influenza and parainfluenza viruses) is unlikely to be sustainable in the long term.",

Utilization of rapid viral diagnostic procedures, such as may be provided by molecular amplification methods, could help to reduce the emergence of antibiotic-resistant bacteria. One study demonstrated that a 52% reduction in antibiotic use was possible using molecular methods for viral diagnosis. 15 Despite the obvious economic burden of CAP, we do not have accurate data on how many of these infections are viral in origin or caused by the atypical bacteria for which routine diagnostic testing is not readily available. The identification of emerging human viral infections (such as H5N1 influenza and SARS-CoV) has heightened awareness of the gaps in respiratory pathogen diagnosis. Nucleic acid detection assays are likely to be utilized more widely to identify novel emerging pathogens that could result in worldwide outbreaks. Molecular amplification assays are being used successfully for the identification of organisms associated with pneumonia. 16 The potential for nosocomial spread of respiratory pathogens is well recognized for patients admitted to the hospital with RSV, parainfluenza, or other infections, serving as a reservoir for transmission to vulnerable patients and leading to possible outbreaks. 17 Previously, available diagnostic methods were not sensitive enough to identify sources of outbreaks, but the advent of molecular amplification methods has allowed even environmental sampling to be helpful in confirming outbreak sources and linking clustered cases of infection. 18 ",

Published diagnostic methods for detection of respiratory pathogen DNA or RNA directly from clinical specimens utilize target amplification procedures such as polymerase chain reaction (PCR) or nucleic acid sequence-based amplification (NASBA).Although direct detection methods based on nucleic acid hybridization would be theoretically possible, the amount of target nucleic acid in specimens may be minimal and such methods would lack sensitivity compared to amplification methods, unless the organism was propagated before analysis.

The nucleic acid technologies utilized currently in the majority of diagnostic laboratories are real-time PCR single-target assays. In some cases, generic primers can be designed to pick up several related pathogens. Such generic primers may be based on conserved protein coding sequences (such as those essential for enzyme function) or noncoding regions for which variation is limited because of the need for maintenance of secondary structure. The use of primer sets to pick up genera or even families of organisms has shown promise in limited studies, including analysis of Legionella and Mycobacteria.

Identification of emerging viruses, which may have been recently introduced into the human population (e.g., SARS-CoV and influenza A H5N1 types), is critical to public health. Analysis of such novel viruses has relied heavily on sequencing of isolates or amplicons. 9, 10, 34 Human influenza A viruses are associated with enhanced morbidity and mortality compared with influenza B or influenza C viruses. Differences in pathogenicity for subtypes of influenza A also have been reported; for example, H3N2 is associated with more severe infection than H1N1. Such types and subtypes of influenza A can circulate independently, and their identification is important for assessment of current vaccine efficacy. Reassortment of the two predominant influenza subtypes infecting humans in recent times has been reported, and analysis of main hemagglutinin (HA) types has been undertaken by a range of molecular and nonmolecular methods. 35 (1997-1998 and 2003-2004 34,38 ) emphasize the need for detailed surveillance of influenza viruses and vigilance in identification of emerging viruses of importance to public health. Detailed analysis of avian H5N1 viruses that have infected humans to date have confirmed that all genes are of avian origin and are associated with minimal or very inefficient humanto-human spread. The potential for reassorted viruses that could more easily spread among humans is clear, and molecular methods are now an important part of influenza surveillance.",

Future directions will incorporate the use of microarray systems for respiratory pathogen detection and analysis to allow crossing of the barriers between conventional virology and bacteriology (and mycology/parasitology). Once microarray systems have been developed and validated, the costs of this enhanced technology may be reduced and justifiable.",
