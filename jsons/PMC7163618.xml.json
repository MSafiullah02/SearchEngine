Faecal samples (approximately 5 g) were collected from 88 Thoroughbred foals aged 2 days to 17 weeks born on 32 different studfarms in central Kentucky. Depending on the initial clinical presentation, 2 groups of foals were identified: GI\u2010diseased (n = 51 from 30 farms) and healthy foals (n = 37 from 5 farms). Gastrointestinal\u2010diseased animals were defined as having watery diarrhoea for greater than 24 h of duration, decreased milk consumption and/or ultrasonographic evidence of enterocolitis. Foals with ultrasonographic evidence of excessive fluid in the colon and/or small intestine and a history of fevers, colic or anorexia were classified as GI diseased. Foals were included in the healthy group if they had no clinical evidence of diarrhoea, fever or inappetence before, or at the time of, faecal collection. Five grams of fresh faecal material was stored in faecal containers, kept at 4\u00b0C and sent overnight to the diagnostic laboratory on blue ice. Faecal samples were processed immediately at the laboratory upon arrival. Total nucleic acid extractions and real\u2010time PCR was performed as a comprehensive equine diarrhoea panel at a commercial laboratory (Test code 2911: Equine diarrhea RealPCR panel \u2010 comprehensive)a.",

This study provides a prevalence overview of 9 infectious agents in foals in central Kentucky. The 9 infectious agents belong to 3 groups of infectious agents including viruses, bacteria and protozoa. Among the viruses, group A rotaviruses (GARVs) are thought to be the main cause of diarrhoea in foals up to 3 months of age. Equine GARVs have been identified in the faeces of foals with GI disease in the UK 14, the United States of America 15, 16, Australia 17, New Zealand 18, Ireland 19 and Japan 20. Serological data from several countries, indicate that equine GARVs are ubiquitous. Our ERV prevalence in Central Kentucky of 36% was comparable with a recent report of 20% prevalence in foals in Florida 18. Concurrent infections of rotavirus and Salmonella was described by Eugster et al. 21. This coinfection was also found in the current study (n = 1) but other coinfections were significantly more frequent: rotavirus was mostly associated with equine coronavirus (n = 7) and Cryptosporidium spp. (n = 6), which are unique combinations not previously reported in the equine literature. In young children with acute watery diarrhoea, coinfections of rotavirus with other viruses (noro\u2010, adeno and/or astrovirus) were present in 39% of the studied cases 22. Additionally, pre\u2010existing rotavirus infections increase the risk of bacteraemia in children with nontyphoid Salmonella gastroenteritis clearly indicating the type of detrimental interaction coinfecting agents may exert on the host 23. Cryptosporidium coinfections have not been reported in horses but have been described in other animal species or man 24, 25. Surprisingly little information is available regarding interaction of these infectious agents in horses.",

Although this study and those of others have identified coronaviruses in foals with enteric disease, the pathogenicity and its aetiological role in enteric disease have not been examined. The current prevalence study clearly shows that healthy foals without signs of GI disease are equally often infected with equine coronavirus as foals with GI disease and suggests low pathogenicity of ECoV in foals. However, when analysed as coinfecting agent, ECoV was significantly associated with diseased animals: all ECoV infections in the GI\u2010diseased group were associated with coinfections (15 of 15) while foals in the healthy group were mostly monoinfected (8 of 10). This could indicate that pre\u2010existing coronavirus infections facilitate opportunistic secondary infections through neutropenia and lymphopenia of the local immune environment as is known in other species 28, 29, 30 Secondary bacterial and parasitic infections from Gram\u2010negative and anaerobic microflora are described in other species and cause additional complications related to intestinal damage, bacteraemia, toxinaemia and altered mucosal functions 14, 30. Opportunistic infections can be of different origin, including bacterial or protozoal, as shown in this study. Coinfection studies in piglets indicate that coronavirus and bacterial coinfections have a significant effect on the magnitude of the inflammatory immune response and tissue damage compared with monoinfections 29. In young turkeys, coronavirus and enteropathogenic Escherichia coli (EPEC) interact synergistically with severe growth depression and high mortality when compared with monoinfected turkeys 30. Turkeys infected first with coronavirus and then with EPEC developed greater mortality and increased frequency of attaching and effacing lesions than that observed in turkeys inoculated with EPEC prior to turkey coronavirus or simultaneously inoculated with these agents; these observations, although in different species, could suggest an under\u2010recognised role for coronavirus infections in foals. Clearly, additional studies are needed to determine equine coronavirus virulence factors and the relative importance as a coinfecting agent contributing to GI disease in foals.",

The alpha toxin of C. perfringens causes necrotic enteritis in man and colitis in horses in a dose\u2010dependent manner 32. Nine of 17 bacterial infections in the GI\u2010diseased group were present as coinfections, most frequently with viruses (n = 8) or Cryptosporidium (n = 4). Salmonella real\u2010time PCR detected more positive samples than culture: only 57% of PCR positive samples were confirmed by culture. This difference was not statistically significant but confirms previous reports in the literature 33. Resequencing with outside primers confirmed the presence of S. typhimurium invasion A gene sequences in 2 of the 3 discrepant samples.

Secondly, the majority of the foals in the healthy group came from 2 farms. Therefore the healthy group of foals may not adequately represent the foal population in central Kentucky. Nevertheless, an important result of this study is that it documented a high prevalence of coinfections in foals with GI disease which may have been overlooked by practitioners previously. However, in our study population from central Kentucky, we identified that coinfections occur more frequently in foals with GI disease than in healthy foals and therefore should be considered as a diagnostic marker for infectious GI disease. As with any farm\u2010based study of foal diarrhoea the potential for misclassification of disease status exists but due to our comprehensive clinical criteria for classification, misclassification events in both groups are considered to be small in number.",
