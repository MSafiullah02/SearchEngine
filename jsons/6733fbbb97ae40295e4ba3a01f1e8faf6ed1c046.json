Since December, 2019 and as of 24 th April, 2020 approximately 2,719,897 COVID-19 patients have been reported including 187,705 deaths [1] . COVID-19 seems more contagious than its counterparts SARS (severe acute respiratory syndrome) and MARS (middle-east acute respiratory syndrome) and this highly infective disease may transmit from person to person contact via respiratory droplets [2] , fecal-oral transmission [3] , vertical transmission [4] . Majority of patients with this disease have experienced high fever with dry cough while others showed symptoms like shortness of breath, fatigue, muscle pain along with confusion, headache, sore throat, diarrhea, and vomiting [5] . On the contrary, up to 25% of COVID-19 patients remain asymptomatic and do not manifest any clear clinical symptoms are therefore remains unidentified but carry a high risk of transmitting the infection to their family members and society [6, 7] . So, it is difficult to identify and quarantine these patients on time. Moreover, patients in the recovering phase of COVID-19 are also potential sources of transmission. As a result, social and physical distancing has been suggested as an efficient tool to control the transmission of COVID-19 [8] . Frequent washing of hands using alcohol-based hand sanitizer or soap and water, use of face mask and covering mouth and nose with elbow or disposable tissues while coughing and sneezing are recommended measures to prevent the spread of COVID-19 [9] . [10] . Although people of all ages are generally susceptible to this infective disease but those who are in close contact with patients with COVID-19 including health care workers and patients in the hospital are at excessive risk of getting infected with this deadly virus.",
