Inoculation of mice with Ehrlich carcinoma cells resulted in a 5 to 10-fold increase in lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) levels in the serum in 4 days. Because this early rise in LDH levels was also observed in mice inoculated with cell-free extracts or sera from tumor-bearing mice, the presence of an infectious agent was suspected. LDV is now known to produce an asymptomatic, persistent infection in mice characterized by a lifelong viremia and elevation of the levels of at least seven serum enzymes in addition to LDH.",

The ORF 1b proteins are expressed only when a \u22121 frameshift occurs. The frameshift region is characterized by a slippery sequence upstream of a pseudoknot. Three different types of virion proteases are encoded in ORF 1a and these post-translationally cleave the ORF 1a and ORF 1a/1b polyproteins into 12 or more mature nonstructural proteins. There are six 3\u2032 ORFs in the genomes of EAV, PRRSV and LDV, whereas SHFV encodes nine 3\u2032 ORFs.

The remaining 3\u2032 ORFs each encode proteins of about 20 kDa in size that contain a number of putative N-linked glycosylation sites and may function as minor virion envelope glycoproteins.

Soon after infection, virus particles have been observed in small vesicles that appear to be clathrin-coated. Virus replication occurs in the perinuclear area of infected cells. Virions are observed to bud through endoplasmic reticular membranes into intracellular vesicles. Virions presumably move to the exterior of the cell via these vesicles. Assembled nucleocapsids have not been observed in the cytoplasm, except in association with budding virions. Infection of primary\nmacrophages with EAV, SHFV, PRRSV and, probably, also LDV is cytocidal. The formation of double-membrane cytoplasmic vesicles is a characteristic of virus-infected cells. Laboratory strains of EAV, SHFV, and PRRSV cause obvious cytopathology in the continuous cell cultures which they infect. Cells become rounded and are released from the tissue culture flask.

Thereafter, the number of infectible cells progressively declined, until by 7 days, the cultures were no longer infectible. However, incubation of fresh peritoneal macrophage cultures with colony-stimulating factor resulted in the continued differentiation of virus-susceptible cells from stem cells.

In the laboratory, LDV infection is rarely transmitted between mice housed in the same cage, even though infected mice excrete virus in their feces, urine, milk and saliva, unless the cage mates are fighting males. Since LDV in mice and SHFV in patas monkeys is produced throughout the lifetime of an infected animal, the transfer of fluids or tissues from an infected animal to an uninfected one results in the inadvertent transfer of infection. Historically, the most frequent mode of transmission of LDV among laboratory mice and of SHFV from patas monkeys to macaques has been through experimental procedures such as the use of the same needle for sequential inoculation of several animals. Currently, the most frequent sources of LDV contamination are pools of other infectious agents or tumor cell lines that have been repeatedly passaged in mice, especially those first isolated in the 1950s. Such materials should be checked for the presence of LDV and, if found to be contaminated, can be \u2018cured\u2019 of LDV by repeated passage in culture. It has been suggested, but not proven, that SHFV can be transmitted between macaques via the respiratory route.",

A permanent reduction in the population of Kupffer cells involved in receptor-mediated endocytosis of LDH has been shown to occur soon after infection of mice with LDV.\nA decrease in the humoral and cellular immune response to non-LDV antigens is observed during the first 2 weeks after LDV infection. Thereafter, the immune response to other antigens is normal. In immunosuppressed C58 and AKR mice, one isolate of LDV, LDV-C, can induce a sometimes fatal poliomyelitis. Immunosuppression is required to delay antibody production so that virus can reach the central neurons system (CNS) and infect the susceptible ventral motor neurons. LDV-infected neurons become the targets of an inflammatory response. In mice 6 months of age or older, paralysis of one or both hind limbs and sometimes a fore limb is observed.

Extensive capillary necrosis leads to a progressive increase in vascular permeability and volume, hemoconcentration and hypotension. During the terminal stages of the disease, lesions are also found in the adrenal cortex, and degenerative changes are observed in the bone marrow and liver.

The mechanism by which LDV infection activates B cells polyclonally is currently not known, but mice immunized with inactivated virus do not develop a polyclonal response. Autoantibodies to a variety of cellular components (autoimmune antibodies) have been detected in mice chronically infected with LDV.
