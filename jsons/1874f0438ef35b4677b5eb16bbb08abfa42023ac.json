The modified microscope slides were Bellco Glass, Inc., toxoplasmosis slides and the cell cultures used were early passage bovine embryonic lung cells and continuous cell lines of porcine and canine origins. The slide cell cultures were either uninfected or infected with selected viruses or the obligate intracellular protozoan Encephalitozoon caniculi for utilization in direct and indirect fluorescent antibody testing or in peroxidase antiperoxidase immunosorbant assays.",

CeU cultures for such purposes have been prepared in Leighton tubes, chamber slides, or microtiter plates; however, these systems require moderate to large quantities (0.2-2 ml) of reagents and are cumbersome to manipulate. Described herein is an inexpensive and simple micro cell culture technique that utilizes commercially available toxoplasmosis microscope slides; these slides have eight circumscribed areas (each six mm in diameter) which hold 0.025 ml of fluid. Additionally, these slides can be prepared en masse and easily stored for later use. The cell culture systems utilized in this study all grew satisfactorily on the toxoplasmosis slides. Continuous cell lines grew more efficiently than low passage cells. Users of this technique must utilize a humid chamber and either a CO2 incubator or HEPES buffer in the culture fluid to prohibit evaporation or pH change since each circumscribed area holds only 0.025 ml of fluid. The configuration of the toxoplasmosis slides permits the use of at least six wells for test purposes and one area each for positive and negative controls.",

Counterstaining with hematoxylin greatly facilitates reading EIA slides by providing a contrast between the nucleus and cytoplasm of the cells (Figs. 3, 4) .",
