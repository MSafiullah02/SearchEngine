            "text": "Dear Editor, Accurate diagnosis of the pulmonary manifestations of severe acute respiratory syndrome of novel coronavirus may be challenging, especially in patients with concomitant chest trauma. Several studies have evaluated the accuracy of imaging modalities in coronavirus disease of 2019 (COVID-19) and suggest a high sensitivity of computed tomography (CT) scan (97%\u00c098%) (1, 2) . However, imaging manifestations of COVID-19 reported in the literature are nonspecific (3) . In particular, pulmonary contusion, which is a common complication of blunt chest trauma, has a lot of similarities on CT with COVID-19, including peripheral subpleural consolidation and ground glass opacity. Therefore, the current diagnostic protocols are insufficient for differentiation of COVID-19 and pulmonary contusion.",

Therefore, in is not an unlikely clinical scenario to encounter asymptomatic patients with undiagnosed COVID-19 who attend the emergency room with non-COVID-19 related complaints such as trauma. Unfortunately, clinical diagnostic test for COVID-19, namely polymerase chain reaction assay performed on nasopharyngeal swabs, is time-consuming and yields about 25% to 41% false negative results (2, 5) . Consequently, a detailed evaluation of CT scan is necessary to differentiate pulmonary contusion from pulmonary involvement with COVID-19.",

Moreover, while cavitation is not seen with COVID-19 (10), pulmonary contusion is associated with laceration and gas accumulation in the lung parenchyma (11) . such as reverse halo sign, a central ground glass density with peripheral consolidation (6, 12) and thin (1\u00c03 mm) subpleural curvilinear line, lying within 1cm and parallel to the chest wall are described in COVID-19 (13) but not in pulmonary contusion. Although air-bronchograms are found in both COVID-19 and pulmonary contusion, accumulation of gelatinous mucous in COVID-19 may result in slight bronchiolar dilation and bronchiectasis (6) . Lastly, bronchial wall thickening is described in 10% to 20% of patients with COVID-19 (14) .",
