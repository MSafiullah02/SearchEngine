The most common errors regarding PPE misuse were the N95 respirator flexible bands were not fastened to the nose bridge (37.2%), gloves did not cover the wrists (26.9%), and N95 respirators did not cover the nose (20.4%). In addition, 26% of HCWs with long hair did not collect the hair while donning PPE, and 41.2% did not change gloves between patients. Moreover, doffing the PPE not according to CDC guidelines was observed in high rates with all PPE items (26.5%, 42.8%, 41%, and 35.5% for gloves, face shields, gowns, and N95 respirators, respectively). Fifty-five percent used designated placards while donning and 46% used designated placards while doffing. Using the placards improved donning and doffing sequences but did not influence the PPE scores. Hand hygiene and disinfection were observed in 164 out of 178 HCWs. Proper hand hygiene protocol was followed by 51.8% (disinfection and then drying of the hands), 16.5% disinfected the hands but did not properly dry them, and 31.7% did not follow the hand hygiene protocol at all. Proficiency scores were significantly higher for participants in the clinics group compared with the hospital group, as reflected by fewer mistakes observed in donning, doffing, and working under PPE scores (P \u2264 .001) (Table 2\n).",

PPE use was not influenced by subjective discomfort, age, gender, profession, or number of prior lectures. Placard use improved donning and doffing order, but was not followed by the correct use of PPE. Performance in PPE by primary-care HCWs was significantly better than that of tertiary-care staff. Hospital staff are more familiar with PPE, yet this may bring a sense of overconfidence while overlooking small but important details. For the community health clinic staff, this exercise dealt with a more unfamiliar scenario, and they probably paid more attention to details. The results suggest poor awareness to the possibility of PPE misuse, emphasizing the importance of a trained observer while working under PPE in the setting of a severe contagious outbreak.",

The N95 mask was rated as the most problematic item for trainees. It may result from the fact that it is not used in everyday work, and therefore proper use should be emphasized in future drills, and more comfortable alternatives should be sought by future research and development efforts. Trainees following the placard instructions kept the right order of donning and doffing, but still did not perform it well and PPE breaches were found. This may be the result of the way the placards are built. People usually read only the titles, and do not look thoroughly at the sentences that follow. Using larger fonts and simple illustrations may improve performance. Demonstrations are important, with emphasis on short videos using more accessible tools such as smartphones and social and organizational networks. HCWs should not rely on their self-perception, no matter how experienced they are. Simple measures, such as a mirror, can have an important influence on the way HCWs use PPE. Active observation by a designated staff member who comments on PPE use is imperative. It is important to use motivational factors, such as personal safety. Emphasizing personal and family members' safety would probably have a greater influence than emphasizing the importance of infection control and public health.",
