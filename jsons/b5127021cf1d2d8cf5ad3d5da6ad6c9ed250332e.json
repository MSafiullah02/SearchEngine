Reverse transcription followed by PCR reaction is used to amplify a portion of N or S gene of the corresponding coronaviruses. Two PCR products, a 356-bp band corresponding to N gene and a 727-bp band corresponding to S gene, are obtained for TCoV. In contrast, one PCR product of 356 bp corresponding to a fragment of N gene is obtained for IBV strains and one PCR product of 568 bp corresponding to a fragment of S gene is obtained for BCoV.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Abstract"}], "body_text": [{"text": "Turkey coronavirus (TCoV) contributed to signifi cant economic losses and remains as a serious threat to the turkey producers.

Spike protein contributes to the distinctive peplomers on the viral surface and contains neutralizing and group-specifi c epitopes.

Therefore, close relationship between TCoV and BCoV was previously reported and TCoV was placed in an antigenic group as BCoV [ 10 , 11 ] . Although the sequence data revealed divergence of S genes among TCoV, IBV, and BCoV [ 12 -14 ] , there is still a need to detect and differentiate them accurately and quickly.
