During the 2016-2017 influenza season, a Centers for Disease Control and Prevention-led study found that 53.6% of pregnant women had received a seasonal influenza vaccine [22] . Similarly, a 2015 national surveillance study reported maternal Tdap coverage to be 54% [23] . Many women in the study were not yet in the recommended time frame to receive Tdap.

When stratified with respect to a history of allergies, those with a history of allergies more frequently developed ALRTI, although the difference was not statistically significant. However, detection of respiratory pathogens was similar among cases with and those without a history of allergies. Among children, infection with HRV or RSV has been associated with the development of long-term wheeze and asthma [24, 25] .

Children with detectable HRV and a positive result of an immunoallergy assay are more likely to develop a subsequent wheeze [18, 27] .
