            "text": "Human adenoviruses (HAdVs) consist of seven different species (A to G) subdivided into 67 HAdV types [1], [2]. HAdV typing is performed by PCR amplification and sequencing of a hypervariable region of the hexon gene, coding for one of three HAdV capsid proteins. HAdV can cause a wide range of diseases, namely febrile respiratory tract infections, conjunctivitis, diarrhoea and more rarely haemorrhagic cystitis and meningitis. Recent studies identified HAdV among 6% to 20% of hospitalised or emergency room admitted children [3], [4], [5], [6] presenting with lower respiratory tract infections and 10% and 23% of children admitted with acute gastroenteritis [7], [8]. HAdV species have been associated with different clinical manifestations [9]: gastroenteritis with HAdV species F, keratoconjunctivitis with species D and respiratory disease with species C and E. Species A and B (type 1) have been associated with gastroenteritis, respiratory infections, and keratoconjunctivitis. In particular, HAdV-B7 has been associated with severe respiratory disease [5], [10].",

Non-symptomatic infected individuals can keep emitting viral particles in the environment for weeks through their feces, notably species B and C [11], [12], [13]. HAdVs are non-enveloped viruses, which make them more resistant to lipid disinfectants and provide them with a prolonged capacity to survive in the environment [14], [15]. All these factors contribute to the outbreak potential of HAdVs. The potential for outbreaks of respiratory disease has led to the development of a vaccine to be used among US military recruits [16], [17].",

The genotyping analysis of HAdV positive samples were used to: i) characterize which HAdV species and types circulated in Denmark in study period and ii) to investigate whether phylogenetic, geographical and temporal clusters occurred in the study period and whether the current methods for HAdV genotyping might be sufficient for outbreak investigations. Together, this knowledge was used as an evidence-based platform for an evaluation of the added value of a laboratory-based surveillance system for HAdV.",

For this analysis, we limited the sample set to the samples which were tested simultaneously in laboratory analysis packages including both HAdV and a defined set of respiratory and gastrointestinal viruses. This approach was taken in order to limit potential biases (overestimation of HAdV prevalence) in samples that would have been tested only for HAdV. The sample set comprised 5858 feces samples and 1784 respiratory samples. In respiratory specimens, the package consisted of Rhinovirus, Enterovirus, Influenza, Respiratory Syncytial Virus (RSV), Parainfluenza, Metapneumovirus, Coronavirus and Parechovirus. In the feces samples, viruses included in the laboratory analysis package were Norovirus GGI and GGII, Rotavirus, Sapovirus and Astrovirus. Overall the estimated prevalence of HAdV infections in the selected sample set was low at 0.9% (n = 54) and 3.5% (n = 62) among feces and respiratory specimens, respectively. Norovirus was the most frequently detected viral pathogen in feces specimens and Rhinovirus-Enterovirus in respiratory specimens (Table 3\na and b). In 16 feces samples (28%), HAdV was found together with one or more other virus (Norovirus, n = 6, Astrovirus, n = 5, Rotavirus, n = 3 and Sapovirus, n = 1), whereas samples containing HAdV alone accounted for 72%. In most HAdV positive respiratory samples (n = 38, 61%), a co-infection was found (Rhinovirus-Enterovirus, n = 27, RSV, n = 9, Coronavirus, n = 6, Parainfluenza virus, n = 3, Influenza, n = 2, Parechovirus, n = 1, Metapneumovirus, n = 1).",

The frequency of each type as well as sample types screened are indicated in Table 4\n. Isolates belonging to species B were observed in all regions from Denmark, however species B isolates belonging to the cluster of HAdV-B3 and B7 were mainly collected in 2013-14, and those belonging to the cluster of HAdV-B50 and B21 in 2015-16 (Fig. 2). Species C and E isolates were identified from the different Danish regions and across the study time period. All but two HAdV-F clustered with genotype 41 and were mainly isolated in 2011\u201312 (n = 18). Overall, most HAdV-F isolates originated from two regions (Zealand, n = 17 and Southern Denmark, n = 6). Since the short sequences did not provide enough discrimination power to distinguish most samples assigned to species D, these samples were further characterized by sequencing and phylogenetic typing analysis of a longer fragment of the hexon gene (Fig. 3\n). This improved the typing resolution and allowed classification of 47 of the 50 sequences into six genotypes. Type 56 and 37 were identified in samples from all regions (but Faroe Islands and Greenland), in the years spanning 2012\u20132016 and 2012\u20132015, respectively. Type 53 was only found in Faroe Islands and type 8 was mainly identified in samples from the region of Zealand, suggesting geographically restricted transmission. Clusters of two to three HAdV type 8 sequences (Fig. 3) were investigated for potential outbreaks as samples originated from the same location and were collected less than 30 days apart. However, phylogenetic analyses of the long hexon sequences from these samples did not permit for discrimination between them and other HAdV type 8 sequences with different temporal or geographical origins. Type 64 was found across multiple Danish regions and years, whereas type 42 was only found in a single sample from the region of Central Denmark.",

Eye swabs and feces samples were the most commonly available samples which resulted in the identification of a large number of HAdV species D and species F. Type 41 was the most common species F strain circulating in Denmark. Of the six types belonging to species D, five types were identified in Denmark, and one additional type was identified in samples from the Faroe Islands. Sequencing a longer fragment of the hexon gene improved the classification of HAdV D from to type level for a total of 142 of 152 (93%) samples. To perform typing of HAdV it would therefore be advisable to have species specific primers for typing of some HAdV species after an initial and broad screening is performed with the primers capable of detecting all species. We here provide such additional primers for HAdV D.",

Species D type 8, identified in this study, has previously been associated with outbreaks of keratoconjunctivitis [22], [23]. It was therefore investigated if possible outbreaks could be observed in the study period through a combined phylogenetic, geographical and temporal clustering. Although geographical and partial temporal clustering of type 8 was observed and indicated a possible outbreak on Zealand in 2013 the phylogenetic resolution, even with the larger hexon gene fragment, was not high enough for a clear distinction between sequences from Zealand in 2013 and other type 8 sequences with different geographical and temporal origins. Therefore larger parts or whole genome sequencing approaches might be required to differentiate between sequences originating from an outbreak and sporadic cases. Since HAdVs genome consists of dsDNA, it might also be far less variable than other (ssRNA) viruses, for instance norovirus, where molecular methods are commonly used to identify point-source outbreaks [24], [25]. Systematic surveillance and reporting of HAdV infections and virus genotyping would provide critical information on HAdV types commonly in circulation and their genetic diversity and also allow for the identification of clusters of infections likely to be outbreaks.",

As examples, in the Netherlands, virological sentinel surveillance collects weekly numbers of HAdV positive samples from laboratories serving primary care, hospitals and long-term care facilities. In Scotland, HAdV surveillance is done as part of a routine respiratory screen both from hospital samples all year-round and from general practitioner samples during the influenza season as part of the sentinel swabbing scheme for influenza-like illness. In Germany, the surveillance system only covers epidemic keratoconjunctivitis. These surveillance systems mainly rely on existing infrastructure but have enabled countries to monitor trends and also, in the example of Germany, to investigate outbreaks [26]. Denmark could also take advantage of existing surveillance systems such as the Influenza sentinel surveillance system and the enhanced enterovirus surveillance system [27], which focus on detection and typing of viral respiratory infections including adenoviruses.",
