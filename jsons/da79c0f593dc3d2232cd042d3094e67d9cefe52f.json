Therefore, new therapeutic strategies are needed to improve clinical outcomes, particularly in patients with severe disease. This case series explores the safety and effectiveness of intravenous allogeneic cardiosphere-derived cells (CDCs), formulated as CAP-1002, in critically ill patients with confirmed coronavirus disease 2019 . Adverse reactions to CAP-1002, clinical status on the World Health Organization (WHO) ordinal scale, and changes in pro-inflammatory biomarkers and leukocyte counts were analyzed. All patients (n = 6; age range 19-75 years, 1 female) required ventilatory support (invasive mechanical ventilation, n = 5) with PaO 2 /FiO 2 ranging from 69 to 198. No adverse events related to CAP-1002 administration were observed. Four patients (67%) were weaned from respiratory support and discharged from the hospital. One patient remains mechanically ventilated as of April 28th, 2020; all survive. A contemporaneous control group of critically ill COVID-19 patients (n = 34) at our institution showed 18% overall mortality at a similar stage of hospitalization. Ferritin was elevated in all patients at baseline (range of all patients 605.43-2991.52 ng/ml) and decreased in 5/6 patients (range of all patients 252.89-1029.90 ng/ml). Absolute lymphocyte counts were low in 5/6 patients at baseline (range 0.26-0.82 \u00d7 10 3 / \u00b5l) but had increased in three of these five patients at last follow-up (range 0.23-1.02 \u00d7 10 3 /\u00b5l). In this series of six critically ill COVID-19 patients, intravenous infusion of CAP-1002 was well tolerated and associated with resolution of critical illness in 4 patients. This series demonstrates the apparent safety of CAP-1002 in COVID-19. While this initial experience is promising, efficacy will need to be further assessed in a randomized controlled trial.",

Although most cases are mild to moderate in severity, about 15% develop severe pneumonia, and nearly 5% progress to acute respiratory distress syndrome and multiple organ failure [25, 49] . This worsening is predominantly driven by cytokine upregulation and an exaggerated yet maladaptive inflammatory response [35, 40, 47] . Direct viral infection and cytopathic effects may also play a role. In the sickest patients, a hyperimmune response characterized by cytokine storm leads to critical illness and end-organ dysfunction, with high mortality. Mortality rates increase with severity of illness, and rates > 50% have been described in critically ill patients [7, 18, 48] . No measures, other than supportive therapy, have been found to be effective in treating COVID-19, constituting a major unmet medical need.",

All treatments await validation in large-scale randomized controlled trials. Given their antiinflammatory and immune-modulating effects, various cell types have also emerged as therapeutic candidates. In 2013-2014, 17 patients with H7N9 influenza were treated with mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) and outcomes were compared to 44 controls. Higher survival rate was noted in the MSC group compared to controls (82.4% vs 45.5%, respectively) [12] . For COVID-19, MSCs were recently investigated in a small case series out of China, but only one patient was critically ill [26] .",

These cells are entirely distinct from c-kit + putative cardiac progenitors [13, 27] , which have been the subject of various retracted studies [23] . Since CDCs were first isolated from human endomyocardial biopsies in 2007, these cells have been tested in > 200 patients in clinical trials for myocardial infarction, heart failure with reduced and preserved ejection fraction, Duchenne muscular dystrophy, pulmonary arterial hypertension, and hypoplastic left heart syndrome [29, 30] . These trials, along with extensive preclinical investigation (~ 200 publications from > 55 independent laboratories worldwide), have demonstrated immunomodulatory and anti-inflammatory effects of CDCs ( Fig. 1 ) [30] . Head-tohead comparisons in preclinical models indicate that CDCs may be more effective than MSCs with regards to paracrine factor secretion and myocardial remodeling [27] . Given the safety record of CDCs in humans, and the substantial body of evidence confirming relevant disease-modifying bioactivity, applicability to COVID-19 seemed compelling, particularly in the hyperinflammatory stage of the illness. Due to the scope of the pandemic and unmet need for effective therapies, we evaluated safety and impact of administration of allogeneic CDCs, formulated for intravenous (IV) infusion as CAP-1002, in critically ill COVID-19 patients.",

Nevertheless, we sought some basis for comparison of outcomes and clinical characteristics between the 6 CAP-1002-treated subjects reported here, and other critically ill patients simultaneously hospitalized for COVID-19 at our institution, with similar baseline characteristics. We, therefore, retrospectively characterized a set of patients admitted to CSMC on or after 3/1/2020 with RT-PCR confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection, who required mechanical ventilation. To render the comparison as fair as possible, we quantified clinical status at 30.7 days of hospitalization (to match the average in the CAP-1002-treated subjects) and limited the analysis to patients who received anti-IL6 or anti-IL6 receptor agents during the hospitalization as standard-of-care therapy (as did all of the CAP-1002-treated subjects). Patients were excluded if they: (1) did not have at least 30.7 days of follow-up from admission to the terminal event (death or hospital discharge); (2) were enrolled in any clinical trial requiring informed consent; and (3) had a tracheostomy placed prior to the current admission.",

            "text": "CDCs are stromal progenitor cells isolated from human heart tissue through well-specified culture techniques and exert their effects in a paracrine manner by secreting exosomes (nanosized vesicles with bioactive payload) [16, 17, 31, 39] . CDCs target multiple cytokine pathways (e.g., TNF\u03b1, IFN-\u03b3, IL-1\u03b2, IL-6) that are associated with disease progression and poor outcomes in COVID-19 (Fig. 1) . For example, CDCs have the capacity to polarize macrophages toward an anti-inflammatory and healing phenotype [30] . Table 3 Outcomes and characteristics of CAP-1002-treated COVID-19 patients and a contemporaneous control group COPD chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, COVID-19 coronavirus disease 2019, HF heart failure, MI myocardial infarction a Population consists of patients admitted to CSMC and requiring mechanical ventilation on or after 3/1/2020 with confirmed COVID-19 infection. Patients were excluded if they: (1) did not have at least 30.7 days of follow-up from admission to the terminal event (death or hospital discharge), in order to match the follow-up duration in the CAP-1002 group; (2) were enrolled in a clinical trial requiring informed consent; (3) did not receive an IL-6 inhibitor; or (4) had a tracheostomy placed prior to the current admission. Due to small sample sizes, statistical tests for comparison were not performed. Categorical data presented as total count and percentage (%), and continuous data are presented as mean \u00b1 standard deviation (SD) These anti-inflammatory effects have been demonstrated in animal models of myocardial ischemia, myocarditis, muscular dystrophy, aging, heart failure with preserved ejection fraction, pulmonary arterial hypertension and dilated cardiomyopathy [3, 20, 21, 33, 34, 42] . Finally, based on preclinical work, a majority of IV CDCs are retained in the lungs [6] . Thus, there may be local benefits within the lung parenchyma, although this remains a conjecture. A number of as-yet-unaddressed issues pertinent to use of cell therapy in SARS-CoV-2 infection need to be highlighted. These include the optimal sources of cells and dosing strategies. With respect to safety, no serious adverse events have been noted with administration of CAP-1002 or MSCs from various sources in patients. Another issue related to safety is the potential secretion of IL-6 by CDCs [32] . This potential source of IL-6, however, appears to be negligible, as multiple preclinical models demonstrated the opposite effect following CDC administration: significantly decreased serum levels of IL-6 after CDC infusion [21, 24] . Thus, future studies should logically focus on recognized endpoints including overall mortality, survival to hospital discharge and beyond, length of hospital stay and ventilator-free days, with proper randomization and rigorous controls. A composite ordinal scale reflecting improvement in COVID-19 disease state may trenchantly capture the key clinical outcomes (as recommended by the WHO R&D Blueprint) [46] .",

The absence of a true, randomized control group and the small sample size prevent any meaningful inferences about cause-effect relationship between receipt of CAP-1002 and clinical improvement. As per the standard care protocols for critically ill COVID-19 patients at CSMC, the patients enrolled in the study were receiving concomitant anti-viral and anti-inflammatory therapies, which may have confounded the positive clinical outcomes and introduced heterogeneity into assessments of circulating biomarkers. Nevertheless, we are encouraged by the higher survival rates in the CAP-1002 group when compared against a contemporaneous cohort that similarly received anti-IL-6 therapy and hydroxychloroquine. Furthermore, two drugs that were administered in our cohort of 6 patients and could have a potential confounding effect (lopinavir/ritonavir and hydroxychloroquine) were recently demonstrated to have no efficacy in COVID-19 patients [8, 28] . Remdesivir was not used in any of the patients reported here. These observations, however, do not definitively eliminate potential confounding.",
