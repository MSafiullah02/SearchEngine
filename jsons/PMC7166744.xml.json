Every year, Americans experience an estimated 1 billion cases of the common cold, with the average person experiencing two to six colds per year (Gwaltney, 2002). The common cold is a frequent reason why people seek primary care, resulting in approximately 22 million clinician visits per year (Braun et al., 2000). The rhinovirus is the most prevalent causative agent for nasopharyngitis, followed by the coronavirus, respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), adenovirus, parainfluenza, and influenza (Prasad, Fitzgerald, Bao, Beck, & Chandrasekar, 2000); less than 5% of the cases stem from a bacterial etiology (Makela et al., 1998).",

It is associated with direct and indirect costs related to health care and loss of productive activity through missed work and school (Fendrick, Monto, Nightengale, & Sarnes, 2003). For example, a study of the effects of the common cold on 3249 U.S. college students found that between November and April most students had experienced 2 bedridden days, 1 1/2 days of missed school, and 1 missed day of work (Nichol, D\u2019Heilly, & Ehlinger, 2005). Furthermore, 22.2% had one or more health\u2010care visits, 27.8% performed poorly on a test, and 46.3% had performed poorly on a class assignment, all of which were attributed to the effects of the common cold (Nichol et al.). In addition, Fendrick et al. found that expenditures of approximately 40 billion dollars each year are directly or indirectly associated with non\u2010influenza\u2010related viral respiratory tract infections.",

Since then, Carlson and Krahn (2006) found that 19% of persons with physical disabilities used CAM, and Kim et al. (2005) found that 57% of emergency department patients reported CAM use in the past year. Wilson et al. (2006) reported that 79% of adolescents had used CAM in their lifetime and 29.1% in the past month. Such prevalent use of CAM is not limited to the United States. A study in England by Thomas, Nicholl, and Coleman (2001) discovered that one third of the population had used CAM in the past 12 months and one half of the population had used CAM in their lifetime. Because of the extensive use of CAM throughout western culture, it is crucial to establish the efficacy of such therapy in regard to its various uses, such as its use for the common cold.",

Additionally, Hemila (2004) conducted a systematic review of 12 studies regarding the efficacy of vitamin C as a prophylaxis for respiratory infections experienced by military personnel and those living under conditions that were comparable to military recruits. Seven studies of military personnel, three trials of students in crowded lodging, and two trials of marathon runners were evaluated. Five of the trials found a statistically significant reduction in the incidence of the common cold ranging from 45% to 91% in those supplementing with vitamin C, and the remaining seven found no difference in the incidence of colds experienced by the vitamin C and placebo groups.
