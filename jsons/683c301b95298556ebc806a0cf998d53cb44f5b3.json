The explosion of empirical results have rapidly generated massive sets of loosely structured data. The analytical methods from mathematics and statistics are required to synthesize the large data sets and extract insightful information from them. The emergence of models presents a great opportunity for the mathematics and the mathematical theories would find fruitful and important applications to biological systems. This trend continues to accelerate the development in mathematical biology. The study of mathematical biology usually includes two aspects. On the one hand, by introducing and analyzing mathematical models, researchers can elucidate and predict the basic mechanisms of underlying biological processes. On the other hand, deeper understanding of these mechanisms may drive the discovery of new mathematical problems, new analytical techniques, and even launch new research directions. Most, if not all, areas of mathematics have found application in mathematical biology.",

            "text": "As an important mathematical area, nonlinear partial differential equations have been one of the most active research fields in 21st century. It has also found new opportunities in mathematical biology in recent years. In [50] Dr. Avner Friedman discussed some challenging problems arising from mathematical biology, and one of the major mathematical tools he used is nonlinear partial differential equations. The subject of partial differential equations concerns the changes of quantities in space and time. For biology, the importance of space is hardly a question. With mathematics, we can endeavor to quantify the effect of space in different biological scenarios. In this survey, we consider some issues in spatial ecology via reactiondiffusion models, focusing upon the effect of movement of species on population dynamics in spatially heterogeneous environments. An important ongoing trend in population dynamics is the integration with other directions of biosciences, such as evolution, epidemiology, cell biology, cancer research, etc. Our main goal is showcase the role of reaction-diffusion models by integrating across different research directions in mathematical biology, including spatial ecology, evolution and disease transmissions. We will illustrate that the quantitative analysis of some important questions in biosciences does bring about interesting and novel mathematical problems, which in turn calls for the development of new mathematical tools. We will also formulate a number of potential research questions along the way. This paper is organized as follows. In Sect. 2 we discuss several single species models, for which the dynamics have important implications for the invasion of exotic species. Sect. 3 is devoted to the study of two-species competition models, with emphasis on the effects of dispersal and spatial heterogeneity on the outcome of competition for two similar species. In Sect. 4 we investigate the competition models with directed movement and show how different dispersal (either random or biased) can bring dramatic changes to population dynamics. Sect. 5 concerns the continuous trait models and evolution of dispersal. Finally in Sects. 6 and 7 we discuss some progress on dynamics of phytoplankton growth and disease transmissions, respectively.",

However, the characterization of the set E is a challenging problem.

Some recent progress is obtained in [97] , where the monotonicity was proved for several classes of function m. However, it remains open to show the monotonicity for general function m. In contrast, the minimum of the density, i.e. min x\u2208\u2126 u * (x, d), is not necessarily monotone increasing in d; see [61] .

Biologically, the conditions for species survival are that the river has a minimal length and the diffusion rate of the species lies within a certain range: when the diffusion rate is small, the drift is so dominant that the species is be washed downstream and cannot survive; when the diffusion rate is large, the species is exposed too much to the lethal condition at the downstream end and will also go to extinction. Therefore, it was conjectured in [89, 115] that there is an intermediate diffusion rate d * which is the \"best\" strategy, i.e. once the diffusion rate of a species is d * , no other species can replace it. This conjecture implies that if the majority of individuals in a population adopt the strategy d * , then any invasion fails so long as the invading species is adopting a strategy different from d * . In the evolutionary game theory, such d * is referred as an evolutionary stable strategy [119] . See Subsect. 3.2 and Conjecture 3 for further details.",

Under some other boundary conditions, this threshold value turns out to be a monotone decreasing function of the diffusion rate, while this is not the case for (4) . This leads to a natural evolutionary question: Is the fast diffusion or slow diffusion more beneficial to the species in streams? We will discuss this question in Subsect. 3.2. Some new persistence criteria has been found for general boundary conditions at the downstream in a most recent work [55] , where the critical river length can be either monotone decreasing in the diffusion rate d or it can first decrease and then increase as d increases, depending on the loss rate at the downstream. The diagram in Fig. 1 can be regarded as an extreme case of the new persistence criteria found in [55] .",

An exotic species can successfully invade often because it has some competitive advantage over the resident species. However, in the heterogeneous environment, with the help of diffusion alone, invasion is still possible even though the exotic species does not have any apparent competitive advantage.

More precisely, if we consider the slower diffuser as a mutant among the faster diffusing population, then mutations for slower diffusion rate is selected, i.e. the diffusion rate of the \"new resident\" is smaller than the \"previous resident\". Through constant mutation and competition, the diffusion of new species thus becomes slower and slower. This phenomenon was first discovered by Hastings [56] , and Theorem 3.3 was proved by Dockery et al. [37] .

It should be noted that there are still many questions which remain open even for two competing species. We refer the interested readers to [21, 58, 59, 92, 125] for some related discussions. For general resource distributions, it is challenging to fully determine the stability of the semi-trivial state of (7); see [12, 68, 106] for examples of multiple reversals of the competition outcomes for two-species Lotka-Volterra competition models. A remaining problem is to find some conditions on the resource distribution, so that the local stability of two semi-trivial steady states of (7) can be accurately characterized. The answer may depend upon how to give some sufficient conditions ensuring that the total biomass of a single species as a function of diffusion rate has a unique local maximum (and thus also a global maximum). Another interesting question is what happens if all the coefficients (7) are non-constant, and the weak competition condition (8) still holds for all x \u2208 \u2126.",

Therefore, the fast diffusing invader cannot invade successfully in this case as their available resources can be negative. Similar consideration is applicable for the predator-prey models. However, the study of predator-prey models turns out to be more complicated [112] : Understanding the relationship between the total biomass of species and the total amount of resources is far from being sufficient, and other issues are also involved, such as the dependence of the maximum density of species on the diffusion rate [97] .",

In particular, when m is positive somewhere, the species persists if the advection rate \u03b1 is large. The biological explanation is that the species can utilize the large advection to concentrate at places with locally most abundant resources. It is natural to enquire whether the advection along the resource gradient can confer competition advantage. To this end, Cantrell et al. [13] proposed the following model:",

            "text": "When m is non-constant and \u2126 m \u2265 0, (17) has two semi-trivial states, denoted by (u * , 0) and (0, v * ), for every d, D > 0 and \u03b1 \u2265 0 (see [28] ), where u * is the unique positive steady state of (16) . It is shown in [14] that if d = D and \u2126 is convex, then the semi-trivial state (u * , 0) is globally stable for small \u03b1 > 0. This implies that for two species which differ only in their dispersal mechanisms, the weak advection can confer some competition advantages, provided that the underlying habitat is convex. However, for some non-convex \u2126, it is also proved in [14] that the opposite case may happen for proper m(x): the weak advection can actually put the species at a disadvantage. Does the species have a competitive advantage if the advection is strong? The following result of [5] might seem surprising at the first look. It was first proved in [14] under the additional assumption that the set of critical points is of measure zero and has at least one strict local maximum point. Theorem 4.1 implies that the two competing species are able to coexist when the advection is strong, which is in stark contrast with the case of weak advection. What is preventing the species u to exclude species v by strong advection? A series of work suggests that as \u03b1 increases, species u resides only at the set M of local maximum points of m(x), and retreats from \u2126 \\ M. If m is positive, then that leaves ample room for species v to survive in \u2126 \\ M, i.e. places with less resources [14, 24, 83, 84, 91] . This is proved in Theorem 4.1. When m(x) changes sign, however, the overall leftover resources in \u2126 \\ M might be poor and u may competitively exclude v by strong advection. Theorem 4.1 also reveals that the two competitors modeled by (17) can achieve coexistence by different dispersal strategies including random diffusion and directed advection towards resources, which suggests a new mechanism for coexistence of two or more competing species. In [110] we apply the similar ideas to discuss the possibility of coexistence for three-species competition systems with the random diffusion and directed advection. The analysis of threespecies models turns out to be much more difficult. An obvious challenge is that systems of three competing species, unlike two-species competition model, are not monotone dynamical systems [137] . As mentioned earlier, if the advection rate \u03b1 is large, then the species u will concentrate near some local maximum points of m. Further studies [84, 91] showed that the concentration positions are precisely those local maximum points of m where the function m \u2212 v * is also strictly positive, by establishing the uniform L \u221e estimate and a new Liouville-type result. We note that m is the common resource for both species u and v, and m \u2212 v * is the resource available for species u when the species v reaches its equilibrium. It is observed in [91, Rmk. 1.4] that for some positive local maximum points of m, function m \u2212 v * can be negative, i.e. some apparently favorable places are actually dangerous ecological traps for the species u. This suggests that both distribution of resources and competitors should be taken into account when studying the directed movement of species along the resource gradient. 4.1. Global bifurcation diagrams. The above results show that when the advection is weak, the two species cannot coexist, and the advection confers some competitive advantage for species u; when the advection is strong, the two species coexist for any diffusion rates. What happens for general advection rates? For instance, assuming d > D, when we increase the advection from weak to strong, how does that affect the dynamics of (17)? If \u03b1 = 0, the result of Dockery et al. [37] says that the semi-trivial state (0, v * ) is globally stable; if \u03b1 is sufficiently large, Theorem 4.1 shows that both (u * , 0) and (0, v * ) are unstable and the coexistence happens. A possible conjecture is there exists some critical advection rate \u03b1 * > 0 such that for \u03b1 < \u03b1 * , (0, v * ) is globally stable, while for \u03b1 > \u03b1 * , (17) has a unique positive steady state which is globally stable. However this conjecture fails in general and a more complicated bifurcation diagram of positive steady states occurs. To be more precise, Averill et al. [5] showed that under some conditions on m(x), there exists a function f (x) : [0, \u221e) \u2192 [0, \u221e) satisfying f (0) = 0 and 0 < f (x) < x such that the d-D parameter space is divided into three regions R 1 , R 2 , R 3 , as shown in Fig. 2 . Using \u03b1 as a bifurcation parameter, we see that the following three situations occur:",

Of course, it remains challenging to completely characterize the global dynamics of (17), and many interesting mathematical questions, e.g. uniqueness and global stability, are left open [5] . One particular conjecture is that, for \u03b1 sufficiently large, the positive steady state of the competition system (17) is unique and thus globally asymptotically stable. One way of proving it is to determine the precise limiting profile and show that each positive steady state is linearly stable, if it exists. One can then conclude the uniqueness and global asymptotic stability by the theory of monotone dynamical system [62] . This was carried out for the case when all critical points of m are non-degenerate, and that the value of m is constant on the set of all local maximum points [82, Thm. 8.1]. The general case remains open.",

To further understand Theorem 5.3, we consider a special case of (13) where r(x) = be cx for some positive constants b and c. In this case, it is shown in [4] that the semi-trivial state (u * (x, \u03be 1 ), 0) is globally stable when \u03be 1 = c/\u03b1 and \u03be 2 = c/\u03b1, i.e. the intermediate trait\u03be = c/\u03b1 is an ESS. We can offer some intuitive reasoning for this result by employing the theory of ideal free distribution [49] : When r(x) = be cx , if \u03be 1 = c/\u03b1, it can be verified from (14) that u * (x, \u03be 1 ) \u2261 be cx \u2261 r(x), so that species u attains the ideal free distribution, and thus c/\u03b1 being an ESS is natural.

Since they transport significant amounts of atmospheric carbon dioxide into the deep oceans, they play a crucial role in climate dynamics and have been one of the central topics in marine ecology. Nutrients and light are the essential resources for the growth of phytoplankton. Since most phytoplankton are heavier than water, they will sink into the bottom of the lakes or oceans where the light intensity is too weak for their growth. So how do these phytoplankton persist in the water columns? Some biologists propose that biased movement, combining with water turbulence, can help phytoplankton diffuse to a position closer to the top of lakes or oceans, so that they can get access to sunlight. In this connection, a series of reaction-diffusion models including single and multiple phytoplankton species are introduced in [64, 65, 66] and the references therein to model the spatio-temporal dynamics of phytoplankton growth.",

One of the results is that the phytoplankton population persists if and only if the sinking velocity of phytoplankton is less than a critical value. There are many simplified assumptions in the model, e.g. the death rate is assumed to be a constant. An interesting issue is to consider the case when the death rate is non-constant in space and time. Some preliminary results show that this situation is quite different from that of constant death rate. For instance, under some conditions phytoplankton can persist if and only if the sinking velocity stays within an intermediate range, rather than below a single critical value.",

On the one hand, the coexistence of many species can often be observed in reality. On the other hand, the classical competition theory shows that only the most dominant phytoplankton persists. They seem to contradict each other. The reason is that the classical competition theory is generally established for ordinary differential equation models, i.e. it is assumed that the diffusion rates of phytoplankton are sufficiently large, so that only their average densities are considered; i.e. the water column is well mixed. A natural question is whether small diffusion can increase the possibility of coexistence.

We proved that R 0 is monotone decreasing with respect to the diffusion rate of the infected individuals. The basic reproduction number R 0 characterizes the infection risk of disease and serves as the threshold value for the extinction and persistence of disease: Namely, if R 0 < 1, the unique disease-free equilibrium is globally stable, and if R 0 > 1, the disease-free equilibrium is unstable and there is a unique endemic equilibrium.

For instance, to study the effect of the movement of exposed individuals on disease outbreaks, the following SEIRS (suspected-exposed-infectedrecovered-suspected) epidemic reaction-diffusion model was considered in [139] : Here we divide the individuals into four different compartments: susceptible (S), exposed (E), infectious (I), recovered (immune by vaccination, R). The susceptible individuals are infected by infectious individuals with a rate of \u03b2, and become exposed; exposed individuals become infectious with a rate \u03c3; infected individuals are recovered with a rate \u03b3; recovery individuals lose immunity and go back into the susceptible class with a rate of \u03b1. Here S(x, t), E(x, t), I(x, t) and R(x, t) denote the density of susceptible, exposed, infected and recovered individuals at location x and time t, and d S , d E , d I , d R represent the diffusion rates for susceptible, exposed, infected and recovered populations, respectively. We assume that the disease transmission rate \u03b2(x) and recovery rate \u03b3(x) are environmentally dependent and could be spatially heterogeneous. Our results in [139] reveal that the travel of exposed individuals could have an important impact on the persistence of disease and the movement of recovered individuals may enhance the endemic. Hence, further understanding of the behaviors of the exposed and recovered individuals could be important in designing effective disease control measures.",

Many diseases are presented as multiple phenotypes, e.g. the novel coronavirus has found three major strains which are prevalent in different continents. It is an important evolutionary problem to determine the environmental conditions under which the adaptability of a certain strain becomes dominant. Bremermann and Thieme [9] showed that for a SIR model with one host and multiple pathogens, different pathogens will die out eventually except those that optimize the basic reproduction number. Recent studies showed that for some nonautonomous multi-strain models, even if the transmission and recovery rates change timeperiodically, these strains cannot coexist; i.e. the temporal heterogeneity may not increase the chance of the coexistence for multiple pathogens. Tuncer and Martcheva [140] introduced the following two-strain SIS spatial model to address the question whether the presence of spatial structure would allow two strains to coexist, as the corresponding spatially homogeneous model generally leads to competitive exclusion:",
