During the pandemic, children were older in accordance with what has been presented from several other centers [12], [15], [20]. During the following seasons, however, the average age was actually somewhat lower than in children with other influenza A types.

We found influenza B especially during the second half of the study period. Previous epidemiologic studies used different methods for estimating the number of influenza cases, such as excess of cases with influenza-like illness during influenza seasons, virus isolation, and rapid methods like immunofluorescence and PCR [22]. At our laboratory immunofluorescence and viral isolation were replaced by the more sensitive PCR in October 2007. To what extent this has contributed to our observed increase of influenza B can be discussed. The initial PCR system had a higher sensitivity for influenza B compared to immunofluorescence and virus isolation, while the sensitivity for influenza A was lower. The influenza A PCR has since then been continually improved, and in a review by Mahoney et al. it is stipulated that well optimized RT-PCR assays have 5\u201310% higher sensitivity than virus isolation [23].",
