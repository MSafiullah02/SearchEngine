Pepscan was performed with a panel of thirty-four 12-mer synthetic peptides that mimicked the entire betanodavirus capsid protein. Sea bass serum samples reacted strongly with three regions of the capsid protein comprising amino acid residues 1-32, 91-162 and 181-212. The latter region was also recognized by neutralizing MAbs and coincided with a region of high antigenic propensity identified by an antigen prediction algorithm. These data suggest that a region of the betanodavirus capsid protein spanning amino acid residues 181-212 may represent a neutralization domain that could potentially be used to inform the development of nodavirus vaccines and immunodiagnostic reagents.",

Betanodaviruses are the aetiological agents of viral nervous necrosis (VNN), a disease characterized by vacuolation of the encephalon and retina and the presence of virus particles within infected neurones. VNN is associated with extensive mortalities that may approach 100% in severe cases. Betanodavirus infection has been reported in more than 35 fish species belonging to 10 different orders including Atlantic cod, Gadus morhua L., European sea bass, Dicentrarchus labrax (L.), amberjack, Seriola dumerili (Risso), groupers, Epinephelus spp. and barramundi, Lates calcarifer Bloch (Glazebrook, Heasman & Beer 1990; Mori, Nakai, Nagahara, Muroga, Mekuchi & Kanno 1991; Renault, Haffner, Baudin-Laurencin, Breuil & Bonami 1991; Nakai, Nguyen, Nishizawa, Muroga, Arimoto & Ootsuki 1994; Fukuda, Nguyen, Furuhashi & Nakai 1996; Chi, Lo, Kou, Chang, Peng & Chen 1997; Starkey, Ireland, Muir, Jenkins, Roy, Richards & Ferguson 2001; Johnson, Sperker, Leggiadro, Groman, Griffiths, Ritchie, Cook & Cusack 2002; Ucko, Colorni & Diamant 2004 ).

Fish serum samples were used at a dilution of 1:25 v/v in assay buffer. Peptide-binding antibodies were detected using 50 lL of reporter antibody (25 lg mL )1 in assay buffer). Goat anti-mouse IgG conjugated with phycoerythrin (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR, USA) was used as a reporter antibody and the incubation with the microsphere-antibody complex was performed at room temperature with gentle agitation for 30 min. For analysis of sea bass serum samples, 50 lL of mouse anti-sea bass IgM MAb (Aquatic Diagnostics Ltd) at a concentration of 20 lg mL )1 was used as a primary antibody. Microspheres were resuspended in 100 lL of assay buffer, and sample fluorescence values were measured on a Bio-Plex TM (Bio-Rad) instrument programmed to analyse a 50 lL sample volume and to read a minimum of 100 events per each sample analysed. Results are expressed as mean fluorescence intensity (MFI).",

Correlation between B-cell epitopes identified in antibody-based mapping studies, and epitopes predicted by the method of Kolaskar & Tongaonkar has also been noted for SARS coronavirus (He, Zhou, Wu, Kou, Liu & Jiang 2004) . The putative antigenic domain identified on the betanodavirus capsid protein by the method of Kolaskar & Tongaonkar spans residues 193-212 and comprises the amino acid sequence DVVNVSVLCRW-SVRLSVPSL. Interestingly, capsid protein residues 193-212 fall within the highly conserved region identified by Nishizawa, Mori, Furuhashi, Nakai, Furusawa & Muroga (1995) , and are conserved in 69 of 78 betanodavirus capsid protein sequences deposited on the UniProt database (http://www. ebi.uniprot.org/index.shtml). These include viruses isolated from more than 25 species of fish including halibut, Hippoglossus hippoglossus (L.), Atlantic cod, Japanese flounder, Paralichthys olivaceus (Temminck & Schlegel), sea bass, dragon grouper, Epinephelus lanceolatus (Bloch), barfin flounder, Verasper moseri Jordan & Gilbert, turbot, Psetta maxima (L.), guppy Poecilia reticulata Peters, tiger puffer, Takifugu rubripes (Temminck & Schlegel), haddock, Melanogrammus aeglefinus (L.), and flathead mullet, Mugil cephalus L. Five other betanodaviruses on the Uniprot database contain a single amino acid substitution within residues 181-212 where the class of substituted amino acid is conserved. Three further viruses isolated from striped jack and sea bass contain a lys-met substitution at residue 200, and one virus isolated from sea bass contains an ala-arg substitution at residue 196.

The region between amino acids 181 and 212 is highlighted in green. could function as immunological decoys, such as those identified on human immunodeficiency virus envelope glycoproteins gp120 and gp41 (Neurath, Strick & Lee 1990 ) and glycoprotein gp5 of porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (Fang, Jiang, Xiao, Niu, Zhang & Chen 2006) . Secondly, the short 12-mer peptides used for mapping mimic linear epitopes are formed by contiguous stretches of amino acids. Consequently, they cannot detect antibodies that recognize conformational epitopes formed by complex three-dimensional protein folding. Many neutralizing antibodies that recognize viral structural proteins are directed against conformational epitopes (Wolinsky, McCarthy, Allen-Cannady, Moore, Jin, Cao, Lovett & Simmons 1991) . However, linear epitopes identified in mapping studies have successfully been used to inform the design of viral vaccines and immunodiagnostic reagents (Langeveld, Casal, Osterhaus, Cortes, de Swart, Vela, Dalsgaard, Puijk, Schaaper & Meloen 1994; Wang, Chang, Walfield, Ye, Shen, Zhang, Lubroth, Chen, Li, Lin, Jong, Yang, Chyr, Kramer & Brown 2001) . Thus, the results of the present study highlight regions of the betanodavirus capsid protein that might serve as vaccine components with the objective of inducing protective immune responses.
