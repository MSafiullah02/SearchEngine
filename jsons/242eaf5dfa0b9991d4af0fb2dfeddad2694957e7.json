            "text": "This study evaluated the microbial contamination of health care workers' (HCWs) mobile phones. The study was conducted at a secondary referral hospital in July 2010. Samples were taken from all surfaces of the mobile phones using a sterile swab, and incubated on Brain Heart Infusion agar at 37.5 \u2022 C for 24 hr. Any isolated microorganisms were grown aerobically on 5% sheep blood agar and eosin methyleneblue agar medium at 37.5 \u2022 C for 24-48 hr. The Sceptor microdilution system was used to identify the microorganisms, together with conventional methods. The oxacillin disc diffusion test and double-disc synergy test were used to identify methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) and expanded-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL)-producing Gramnegative bacilli, respectively. The mobile phones were also categorized according to whether the HCWs used them in the intensive care unit (ICU). Overall, 183 mobile phones were screened: 94 (51.4%) from nurses, 32 (17.5%) from laboratory workers, and 57 (31.1%) from health care staff. In total, 179 (97.8%) culture-positive specimens were isolated from the 183 mobile phones, including 17 (9.5%) MRSA and 20 (11.2%) ESBL-producing Escherichia coli, which can cause nosocomial infections. No statistical difference was observed in the recovery of MRSA (p = 0.3) and ESBL-producing E. coli (p = 0.6) between the HCW groups. Forty-four (24.6%) of the 179 specimens were isolated from mobile phones of ICU workers, including two MRSA and nine ESBL-producing E. coli. A significant (p = 0.02) difference was detected in the isolation of ESBL-producing E. coli between ICU workers and non-ICU workers. HCWs' mobile phones are potential vectors for transferring nosocomial pathogens between HCWs, patients, and the community.",

            "text": "A lthough technical innovations have greatly improved people's lives, they may lead to various adverse effects on health. (1) (2) (3) (4) (5) Mobile phones are useful devices used by people worldwide, in both developed and developing countries. These devices have become almost indispensable elements in the fabric of social life. Health care workers (HCWs) use these devices extensively in daily life and at work. Mobile phones have increased the speed of communication and contact within health care institutions. (1, 2, (6) (7) (8) (9) Although extensive concerns have been raised about the possibility that exposure to the radio frequency fields from mobile phones or their base stations deleteriously affect people's health, (3, 4) microbial contamination of these devices, especially those used by HCWs, has not adequately raised concern. (2, 9) These devices, which HCWs might use while working, may be contaminated by nosocomial emerging pathogens, such as methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) and expanded-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL)-producing Gram-negative bacteria. (1, 2, (6) (7) (8) (9) (10) (11) Common nosocomial pathogens can survive on inanimate surfaces for weeks. (12) (13) (14) Therefore, mobile phones may cause microbial crosscontamination between workers, patients, and the community. Nosocomial pathogens can lead to severe infections, with high morbidity, mortality, and cost. (15) In recent years, community-acquired MRSA and ESBL-producing Enterobacteriaceae have become great threats to public health. (16) (17) (18) (19) (20) (21) (22) Several studies have examined the microbial contamination of mobile phones in developing countries. This study evaluated the microbial contamination of mobile phones used by HCWs in a secondary referral hospital in Eastern Turkey.",

Microbiological cultures were taken from mobile phones on Wednesday at about 15:00 hr by two physicians who were blind to the HCWs. Each HCW was asked two questions when the microbiological cultures were taken: (1) Do you ever clean your mobile phone with antiseptic wipes? (2) Do other individuals outside the hospital (e.g., family members such as children and the elderly) use your mobile phone? HCWs who did not want to participate in the study were excluded. The use of mobile phones by HCWs has not been limited or banned in our hospital.",

(3, 24, 25) We believe that the microbial contamination of HCWs' mobile phones in the hospital setting is as dangerous as interference with medical equipment. Devices contaminated by nosocomial pathogens may serve as vectors among HCWs, patients, and the community, as nosocomial pathogens can survive for weeks on inanimate surfaces. (12) (13) (14) Consequently, nosocomial pathogens may be transferred to other places via mobile phones, such as the workers' homes. We found a high microbial contamination rate (97.8%) of mobile phones, including 9.5% MRSA, 23.5% MRCNS spp., and 11.2% ESBL-positive E. coli. Previous studies done in Turkey found similar high microbial contamination rates on HCWs' mobile phones, including 94.5% by Ulger et al. (6) and 91.0% by Krabay et al. (7) The reason for these high contamination rates among HCWs is believed to be the unconscious handling of mobile phones while providing health care services. Also, there is a lack of awareness about nosocomial infections and the lack of awareness about the contamination of mobile phones by infectious microorganisms among HCWs. The high contamination rates may constitute an important threat to public health worldwide, especially in developing countries. Ulger et al. (6) also reported that the microorganisms isolated from HCWs' mobile phones were similar to those colonizing their hands. Although HCWs endeavor to comply with hand hygiene in hospitals, as we found in this study, many of them never clean their own mobile phones. Consequently, we believe that these devices may become vectors for nosocomial pathogens. Unfortunately, HCWs are not conscious of this potential threat, especially in developing countries. Goldblatt et al. (2) noted that cellular telephones can potentially act as \"Trojan horses,\" introducing community-acquired MRSA to areas previously free of MRSA.",
