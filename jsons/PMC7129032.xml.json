COVID-19 is classified as the seventh member of the subfamily Orthocoronavirinae under the family Coronaviridae. Most members of this family are zoonotic viruses transmitted to humans through contact with infected animals. Although bats and snakes are the natural reservoir of most coronaviruses, there is no evidence so far that COVID-19 originated in or was transmitted from a seafood market [1]. Comparison of the lipid rafts of coronaviruses has indicated that the new strain COVID-19 has 80% identity with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV). Lipid molecules such as caveolins, clathrins and dynamin have a fundamental role in the internalization of viruses. These molecules are involved in the entry of viruses into host cells, and targeting host lipids is being studied as an antiviral strategy and could have various applications [2]. COVID-19 seems to need to bind to the angiotensin-converting enzyme-2 receptor on the membrane host cell to enable it to infect the host cell upon coupled with a reliance of serine protease TMPRSS2. This intracellular protein seems to be a determinant of the virus ability to infect the cell [3].",

The WHO considers COVID-19 to be a more serious and widespread epidemic disease [4]. To date, it seems that the mortality rate of COVID-19 is lower than those of SARS or MERS. A significant increase in number of COVID-19 cases was observed as the result of the absence of emerging pathological symptoms in virus carriers. For this reason, it may lead to the collapse of local health-care systems [4]. Some countries face an outbreak crisis and are trying to prevent the spread of COVID-19 through preventing human gatherings, imposing a curfew in cities, preventing travel between countries and closing land borders, all of which may reduce the outbreaks.",

Structural analysis shows that COVID-19 probably derives from a bat SARS-like coronavirus, which has mutated in the spike glycoprotein (protein S) and nucleocapsid N protein The positive-sense RNA genomes of COVID-19 differ from SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, being approximately 29.9 kb, 27.9 kb and 30.1 kb, respectively [6]. The COVID-19 complete genome was annotated to possess 14 open reading frames (ORFs) encoding 27 proteins. Sequence analysis revealed that COVID-19 has > 80% identity with SARS-CoV and 50% with MERS-CoV, which originated in bats [7,8]. In addition, the spherical external spike protein displays a characteristic crown shape with electron microscopy [9]. In the current study, we have compared the novel COVID-19 complete genome with other related coronaviruses to identify mutations and gaps. We selected data from NCBI and we performed the FASTA and BLAST. The comparison between genomes with alignment used MAAFT-7 software. COVID-19 (GenBank MT188341.1) and COVID-19 (MT066175.1), bat-SL-CoVZC45 (MG772933.1) and SARS-CoV BJ182b (EU371561.1) showed alignment identities of 99%, 89% and 82%, respectively.

Supportive treatment is needed for those with severe COVID-19. Specific attention should be given to and more efforts made to reduce transmission to susceptible populations, including health-care providers, immunocompromised patients, children and the elderly [5]. Health-care systems around the world must operate with more than one maximum capacity. Cooperation between health-care systems and the WHO is required to reduce infection. International media, social media and societal culture should be used to maintain personal cleaning, minimize risk of exposure, avoid gatherings and prevent all phenomena that lead to contact between persons [12]. COVID-19 vaccines is under accelerated development.",
