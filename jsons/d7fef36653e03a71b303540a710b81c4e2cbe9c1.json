As of April 3, 2020, the total number of confirmed cases reached 1 026 688 in 199 countries and territories, which has resulted in 54 045 deaths. 2 There is no vaccine or specific drug combination available to control the effect of COVID-19. 3 Therefore, to control the loss of lives, governments of most of the countries are imposing several restrictions on their citizens. 4 The first confirmed case of COVID-19 in India was reported on January 30, 2020, and on April 3, 2020, a total of 2567 cases were confirmed. It took 15 days for the number of novel coronavirus cases in India to go from 100 to 1000, whereas, in Turkey, it took only 4 days. The Indian Government imposed a complete lockdown for 21 days, that started from March 25, 2020, to April 14, 2020, to control the outbreak. It is urgent to study the COVID-19 cases of China to prepare a situation report of India for the coming days so that the government, authorities, and citizens can take or implement the control measures proactively.",

A predictive model is built using WEKA to predict the day-wise number of confirmed cases, recovered cases, and death cases. 6 Time series forecasting is performed on the data collected, and a model is prepared. The daily numbers of confirmed cases and their corresponding days are given as input to obtain the relationship between both variables. The predictive models are derived from the data available from China on the assumption that the COVID-19 epidemic trend in India is similar to that in China with a time lag. This assumption is based on the high population density of both countries. Figure 1 shows the model overview. Each stage is detailed with the following information.",

This number may further increase after April 25, 2020. The overall mortality rate in India is expected to be lower as compared to the rest of the world. The demographic characteristics of India differ from other countries. In 2020, approximately 8.5% of the Indian population are age 60 years and older, whereas this number is more than 23% in Italy. [7] [8] COVID-19 is fatal in older patients, and therefore the fatality rate of India is lower as compared with that of other countries as of April 3, 2020. Along the same lines as above, the model is built for predicting the daily number of recovered cases of COVID-19 in India, as shown in Figure 4 . This number is expected to increase after April 25, 2020. As discussed previously, by the end of May 2020, India may have around 1 million confirmed cases, and there could be a severe shortage of hospital beds by June 2020.

As per the pattern of China, it may be understood that the effect of this disease in India will be at peak during the third and fourth weeks of April 2020. It is essential to discuss that these predictions are made on the basis of a comprehensive study of China.
