The hygiene hypothesis states that a reduced exposure to microbes increases the risk of developing allergies. This hypothesis was originally based on observations showing that children with many siblings, children attending early day care or children growing up in poverty are less prone to develop allergies [2]. It is, however, not yet clear which microbes that can and cannot affect allergy development.",

We have recently shown that infection with human herpes virus type 6 (HHV\u20106) is associated with reduced allergic sensitization in 18\u2010month\u2010old children [3]. We have confirmed this in an experimental animal model of allergic asthma, where mice that are exposed to HHV\u20106 are protected against allergic inflammation. Mice exposed to HHV\u20106 have significantly lower levels of allergen\u2010specific IgE, eosinophils and Th2 cytokines as compared to allergic control mice [4]. In addition, previous infection with EBV [5, 6] and Hepatitis A virus [7, 8] has been associated with a reduced incidence of allergic sensitization and allergic symptoms in human subjects. Infection with orofecal and foodborne bacteria, including Toxoplasma gondii and Helicobacter pylori, or exposure to bacterial components, such as endotoxin, have also been demonstrated to be inversely related to atopic allergy [8, 9, 10, 11]. Furthermore, the composition of the intestinal commensal flora has been suggested to affect the risk of developing allergic disease, where early colonization with bifidobacteria and lactobacilli is associated with a lower prevalence of allergy in young children (0\u20132 years of age) [12, 13, 14].",

            "text": "The allergic response is driven by Th2 cells, and their secretion of IL\u20104, IL\u20105 and IL\u201013. The initiation of the T cell response and the subsequent maturation of the T cells, including their differentiation into Th1 or Th2 cells, are regulated by dendritic cells (DC) [15]. These cells are generally divided into two major subsets; myeloid CD11c+CD123\u2212 DC (mDC) and plasmacytoid CD11c\u2212CD123+ DC (pDC). MDC are the main source of IL\u201012, which is pivotal in the differentiation of na\u00efve CD4+ T cells into the favoured Th1 phenotype [16, 17, 18]. PDC tend to be more prone to induce Th2 responses compared with mDC [15], by inducing IL\u20104, IL\u20105 and IL\u201013 in responding T cells [19]. However, the Th2\u2010skewing effect of pDC can be omitted by viral exposure or binding of CpG to TLR\u20109 [3, 19].",

            "text": "In contrast to the adult immune system, the immune system of newborns is immature, which include impairments in both innate and acquired immune responses. This is largely due to a poor DC function in the newborns [20], which is accompanied with a reduced capacity to produce the Th1\u2010polarizing cytokines IL\u201012 [21, 22], IFN\u2010\u03b1 [21, 23] and IFN\u2010\u03b3 [24]. Even though pDC from cord blood have impaired IFN\u2010\u03b1/\u03b2 production after TLR activation [23], cord pDC may secrete large amounts of IFN\u2010\u03b1 after viral exposure. We have recently shown that cord pDC exposed to HHV\u20106 produce large amounts of IFN\u2010\u03b1. This was correlated with a reduced capacity to induce IL\u20105 and IL\u201013 in responding T cells, which instead produced elevated levels of IFN\u2010\u03b3 [3]. Thus, repeated microbial stimuli of the innate immune system of neonates may accelerate the maturation process and enhance Th1 cell development. The amplified Th1 responses might then lead to reduced Th2 polarization and a reduced risk of developing allergic diseases, in line with the hygiene hypothesis [25]. In addition, the immune system of newborns is also characterized by less mature regulatory T cells [26] that have a reduced suppressive capacity [27]. Still, regulatory T cells of the neonatal immune system are functional and able to exert suppressive functions [28, 29], yet to a lesser extent than those in adults [27].",

For this purpose, five different bacteria and seven different viruses were used. Bacteria were chosen based on (i) being Gram\u2010negative or Gram\u2010positive bacteria and (ii) being part of the commensal intestinal flora and/or being the cause of infection in humans [30]. The viruses were chosen based on (i) being dsDNA, rsRNA or ssRNA viruses, (ii) being enveloped or non\u2010enveloped and (iii) causing either acute or chronic infection in humans. To study the effect of these microbes, we measured cytokine secretion in cord blood\u2010derived T cells that were cultured with allogenic pDC or mDC. We found that all enveloped virus tested, but none of the bacteria, could block IL\u201013 production in cord blood CD4+ T cells. This effect was not associated with enhanced Th1 responses. Our data suggest an important role for enveloped viruses in the early maturation of the immune system.",

As cord T cells have not yet met a specific antigen, it is not possible to measure recall T cell responses in these cells. Instead, we assessed the cytokine profiles in cord T cells in response to allogenic DC, that is in a mixed lymphocyte reaction (MLR). We, therefore, incubated purified cord blood CD4+ T cells with allogenic cord mDC or cord pDC and analysed the cytokine profile after 48 h of coculture. Similarly, adult CD4+ T cells were incubated with allogenic adult mDC or adult pDC, and the cytokine profile was assessed after 48 h of coculture. The cytokines analysed were the Th1\u2010specific cytokines IL\u20102 and IFN\u2010\u03b3 and the Th2 cytokines IL\u20105 and IL\u201013. We found that pDC from cord blood induced significantly higher levels of the Th2 cytokines IL\u20105 and IL\u201013 in responding CD4+ T cells compared with both pDC and mDC from adult blood and to mDC from cord blood (Fig. 2C,D). Cord pDC induced 8.5\u2010fold higher levels of IL\u201013 and 19\u2010fold higher levels of IL\u20105 compared with adult pDC, and five\u2010fold and 13\u2010fold higher levels of these cytokines compared with cord mDC.

All enveloped viruses tested (coronavirus, CMV, HSV\u20101, influenza virus and morbillivirus) downregulated the IL\u201013 responses in cord blood cocultures (Fig. 3E,F). The non\u2010enveloped viruses, adenovirus and poliovirus had no effect on the IL\u201013 production in cord MLR cultures using either pDC (Fig. 3F) or mDC (Fig. 3E) from cord blood as antigen presenting cells. Neither did any of the bacteria reduce the IL\u201013 responses. Instead, S. aureus stimulated pDC increased the IL\u201013 production in responding CD4+ cord T cells (Fig. 4F). We were not able to document any significant inhibitory effects on the IL\u20105 production by the virus, most likely due to the very low initial production of this cytokine (not shown).",

Yet, it is generally thought that the immune system of newborns is immature and differs from that in adults. The T cell polarization in newborns is correlated with impaired Th1 responses [38, 39]. However, individual Th1/Th2 balance in newborns varies depending on parental and environmental factors [40]. In this paper, we show that the baseline production of the Th2 cytokines IL\u20105 and IL\u201013 were elevated in cord CD4+ T cells compared with adult T cells. The Th2 cytokine induction observed in cord cells was not an intrinsic function of the neonatal T cells, but rather a Th2\u2010inducing effect of cord pDC. This is in line with previous findings where pDC was shown to promote Th2 responses in healthy and allergic subjects [15, 19]. This is, to our knowledge, the first study to show that the levels of Th2 cytokines obtained in vitro activated T cells differs between newborns and adults. We could not detect any significant differences in Th1 cytokine synthesis (IFN\u2010\u03b3 and IL\u20102) between T cells from adults and newborns, even though others have shown that cord blood DC is impaired in their capacity to induce both IFN\u2010\u03b3 and IL\u20102 in responding T cells [39].

This confirms previous findings from us and others, showing that the Th2 skewing effect of pDC in newborns and adults can be omitted by microbial stimuli [3, 19]. However, the diminished IL\u201013 production that was seen in virus stimulated cultures could not be correlated with Th1 polarization, that is IFN\u2010\u03b1, IFN\u2010\u03b3, IL\u20102 or IL\u201012 secretion.

Still, these findings emphasize the importance of early life microbial stimuli of the innate immune system for an accurate maturation of the immune system, that is to avoid unwanted Th2 responses. We propose that a crucial component of this maturation process is an appropriate activation of cord pDC.",

As we only measured IL\u201012 p40 and not the biologically active IL\u201012 p70, we cannot deduce from this study whether any of the tested bacteria did indeed induce IL\u201012 p70. However, Gram\u2010positive bacteria are known for their capacity to induce IL\u201012 p70 in both adults and newborns [41, 42]. Yet, others have shown that the synthesis of IL\u201012 p70 is impaired in newborns [21, 43] and that lymphocytes from cord blood lack IL\u201012 receptor \u03b21 expression [44], which may explain the absent correlation between IL\u201012 secretion and Th1 cytokine secretion. Furthermore, the use of UV\u2010inactivated bacteria could also explain the lack of IL\u201012 secretion in bacteria stimulated cultures.

Studies suggest that children that develop allergies later in life and/or with a family history of allergy are Th2 skewed at birth, even though conflicting data exists [38, 51, 52, 53, 54]. Elevated levels of IL\u201013 [55, 56, 57] and decreased levels of IFN\u2010\u03b3 [51, 58, 59] in cord T cells has been shown to be risk factors for developing allergic disease later in life, even though the role of IFN\u2010\u03b3 is less clear\u2010cut [55]. In this paper, we show that cord pDC drive the neonatal T cell response towards a Th2 bias and that viral stimuli can omit this Th2 skewed effect. This is in line with our previous findings where HHV\u20106 activated pDC block Th2 cytokine synthesis in responding cord T cells [3]. This fits well with our and others observations, showing that childhood infection with HHV\u20106 or EBV is inversely related to allergic sensitization and/or allergic symptoms [3, 5, 6]. Furthermore, the hygiene hypothesis postulates that the increase in allergic diseases during the last decades is caused by a decreased infectious burden [2], which in turn is owing to vaccination, antibiotics, improved hygiene and generally enhanced socioeconomic standard [1]. Given that many childhood viral diseases have a reduced incidence [1, 60, 61, 62], it is tempting to speculate that the large increase in allergic diseases could be related to a decreased exposure to viral infections. Taken into account that our studies were performed in vitro using inactivated microbes, we suggest that viral infections during infancy may play an important role in the development of the immune system, by driving the adaptive immunity away from Th2 biased immune responses, and thus, to prohibit the development of allergic diseases.",
