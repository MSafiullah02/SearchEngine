            "text": "A better physical understanding of the processes governing pathogen transport is needed to reduce the spread of deadly influenza strains such as H5N1 or H7N9 (CDC 2013; Bourouiba 2013). Infected patients can produce virus-bearing droplets by sneezing, coughing, or even breathing (e.g., Settles 2006). Observations indicate that coughs and sneezes produce ejecta that are well described as a multiphase, turbulent cloud comprising hot, moist air and suspended droplets (Bourouiba et al. 2012, 2014). A theoretical model describing the evolution of the cloud was developed by Bourouiba et al. (2014) and validated against experiments. The turbulent gas-phase dynamics were shown to be critical in enhancing the range of the smaller suspended droplets by delaying their exit from the cloud. This model can be used to assess contamination ranges in various environmental conditions. Inputs for this model include the volume fraction of liquid to gaseous phases and the droplet size distribution. The droplet size spans the micrometer and millimeter scales, but no consensus on the size distribution can be found in the literature. The techniques for measuring expiratory droplet size distributions have included enumeration on glass slides (Duguid 1946), optical counting (Papineni and Rosenthal 1997), aerodynamic droplet sizing (Johnson et al. 2011), interferometric Mie imaging (Morawska et al. 2009), scanning mobility droplet sizing (Yang et al. 2007), and laser diffraction (Zayas et al. 2012). Despite these efforts, discrepancies persist between the reported size spectra. The variability in the composition and physical properties of the ejected salivary mucus is also a major source of uncertainty for all inferences relying on optical characteristics and evaporation rates based on pure water.\n\n",

Such fluid fragmentation phenomena are found in industrial applications (Villermaux 2007). In such settings, while the precise form of fluid fragmentation generally depends on the details of the source conditions, it has been reported to involve a cascade to smaller scales, from a fluid volume to sheets, ligaments, and, finally, droplets (Eggers and Villermaux 2008). Relative to industrial flows, the fluid dynamics of violent expirations remains poorly understood. To gain insight into the physics selecting the dominant droplet sizes emitted, we directly image the emissions of droplets with high-speed videography. In Sect. 2, we discuss the possible physical mechanisms involved in the fluid fragmentation accompanying such violent expirations. The experimental setup and the results of our visualization of real human sneezes are presented in Sect. 3. In Sect. 4, we describe the anatomy of sneeze ejecta in more detail, with a focus on the type of fragmentation processes leading to droplets.",

            "text": "Sneezing and coughing are often caused by an irritation of the nose and then trachea, respectively; this leads to nerve stimulation and the resulting reflex action (James and Burgh 1969). It has been reported that the respiratory changes in a sneeze are analogous to those of a cough, except for the timing of the different phases (Widdicombe 1979). In particular, both a sneeze and a cough consist of an initial irritation, a closure of the glottis, and a rapid increase in intrathoracic pressure. Following the re-opening of the glottis, air is expelled at high flow rates (Banner 1986). For the sneeze, the pharynx also seems to be constricted (Widdicombe 1979); however, the subsequent dynamics remain poorly understood relative to those of the cough. Within the airway system, sneezes and coughs consist of fast airflows interacting with relatively slow moving, thin fluid layers. The majority of the studies of drop size measurement (e.g., Zayas et al. 2012; Yang et al. 2007; Morawska et al. 2009) focus on coughing, talking, or respiration. Turner et al. (1941) used single flash photographs to record sneezes using a dark field imaging setup and highlighted parts of the complex nature of such emissions. Duguid (1946) also studied sneezing; however, the sneeze dynamics examined were presumably altered by the subjects\u2019 ingestion of a dyed solution used for flow visualization.\n\n\n",

Such instabilities involve surface tension, viscous, and aerodynamic forces, the relative magnitudes of which determine the final size of the resulting pathogen-bearing droplets. Surface tension and fluid viscosity generally favor larger droplets, while higher air speeds tend to result in smaller droplets.

They remain coiled, and the solvent solution dominates the dynamics; hence, the thinning is dominated by viscous effects. In the subsequent phase, when the polymers become sufficiently stretched, they resist the surface-tension-driven breakup that would occur via the Rayleigh-Plateau instability in a Newtonian fluid. Instead, filament stretching can be accompanied by the beads-on-a-string structure, which arises when a balance of inertial, capillary, viscous, and elastic forces is achieved (Bhat et al. 2010). Beads on a string are a clear indicator of the influence of viscoelasticity and play a key role in selecting final sizes of the droplets. The Deborah number De quantifies the effect of viscoelasticity by prescribing the relative magnitude of the polymer relaxation time \\documentclass[12pt]{minimal}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsmath}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{wasysym} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsfonts} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amssymb} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsbsy}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{mathrsfs}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{upgreek}\n\t\t\t\t\\setlength{\\oddsidemargin}{-69pt}\n\t\t\t\t\\begin{document}$$\\lambda$$\\end{document}\u03bb and timescale of fragmentation \\documentclass[12pt]{minimal}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsmath}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{wasysym} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsfonts} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amssymb} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsbsy}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{mathrsfs}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{upgreek}\n\t\t\t\t\\setlength{\\oddsidemargin}{-69pt}\n\t\t\t\t\\begin{document}$$\\tau$$\\end{document}\u03c4, \\documentclass[12pt]{minimal}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsmath}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{wasysym} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsfonts} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amssymb} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsbsy}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{mathrsfs}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{upgreek}\n\t\t\t\t\\setlength{\\oddsidemargin}{-69pt}\n\t\t\t\t\\begin{document}$$De = \\lambda /\\tau$$\\end{document}De=\u03bb/\u03c4.

Villermaux and Bossa (2009) and Reyssat et al. (2007) provide a detailed analysis of the dynamics of fluid bags. Typically, a volume of liquid subjected to a net air flow in a particular direction is deformed by differential aerodynamic pressure that tends to flatten the volume into a sheet that expands as it is swept downstream (Fig. 1). The fluid is then transformed by the aerodynamic pressure into a bag structure that expands and thins until it becomes unstable and ruptures. The resulting holes expand at the Taylor\u2013Culick speed (Taylor 1959; Culick 1960). As the holes grow and the liquid shell destabilizes, ligaments form perpendicular to the bag rim surface due to the Rayleigh\u2013Taylor instability of the rim and are stretched (Lhuissier and Villermaux 2012; Scharfman et al. 2013). These ligaments then eventually break into droplets via Rayleigh-Plateau-type instabilities (see Fig. 1).",

Two monochrome cameras and various lighting configurations were used. First, the head of the subject was positioned in front of a black felt backdrop in order to create a dark field effect (Turner et al. 1941). This approach allows for the droplets to scatter the light toward the cameras (Figs. 3, 4), which enhances the contrast. The light sources surrounded the observation area, but were never directly oriented toward the cameras. This setup was found to be optimal for the visualization of the far-field dynamics of sneezes, including sneeze cloud dynamics. By contrast, droplets at close range could best be visualized by using backlighting through a white diffuser. The fragmentation was recorded using one or two cameras simultaneously. In the latter case, single cameras were positioned above and on the side of the desired imaging area.",

Despite recent efforts, no consensus on the size distributions of such droplets is reached in the literature. It is commonly assumed that the droplets are formed within the airway system, with the process of their formation being unreported. Here, we report the results of direct high-speed recordings of the droplets emitted at the exit of the mouth during violent exhalation events. Our study has revealed the rich physics accompanying the fragmentation induced by violent expirations. Our findings indicate the shortcoming of the common belief that the respiratory droplets are formed prior to ejection. Moreover, our findings show the limitations of using indirect measurement techniques tailored to estimate spherical droplet sizes only. In reality, ligaments are suspended in the turbulent cloud and continue to play an important role in shaping the final droplet sizes after ejection. In particular, we showed that violent respiratory exhalations including sneezes involve a sequence of fragmentation processes from mucosalivary fluid sheet formation and extension, to puncture and retraction, to ligament stretching, and, ultimately, to droplet formation. Moreover, we revealed that viscoelasticity plays an important role in retarding the ligament breakup process in time by up to a factor of 40. In addition, viscoelasticity appears to play a major role in the selection of the upper tail of the final size distribution, namely favoring larger drops than expected with a Newtonian fluid under the same fragmentation conditions. This appears to be due to the beads-on-string formation and repeated merger of droplets along the filaments prior to the final separation into isolated droplets. It remains to be clarified how this process influences the lower tail of the size distribution when compared to that of Newtonian fluid under the same fragmentation conditions in unsteady flows such as violent expirations. Namely, it remains unclear whether we would also detect smaller satellite drops created from very thin stretched viscoelastic mucosalivary filaments attached to the larger drops resulting from mergers.",

By revealing key fragmentation processes, such as bag burst and mergers of beads on string, that influence the final droplet size distribution, our study is the first step in that direction. A theoretical and analog experimental framework for rationalizing the effect of viscoelasticity on the fragmentation leading to the final sneeze drop size distribution is currently under development. A more detailed analysis of the role of each fragmentation process identified herein in setting the final droplet size distribution is also being investigated to refine our assessment of the risk of contamination by violent expirations.",
