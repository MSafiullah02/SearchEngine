Clinical signs of TCoV infection include watery diarrhea, depression, ruffled feathers, and decreased consumption of food and water. Distended intestines with gaseous and watery contents are the most striking gross lesions. The major histopathological changes are blunted villi, increased crypt depth, and increased width between villi (Guy, 2003, Gomaa et al., 2009). Currently, there are no effective vaccines available to control TCoV infection.",

Spike (S), envelope (E), membrane (M), and nucleocapsid (N) proteins are four major structure proteins of TCoV (Lin et al., 2002, Cao et al., 2008). The amino-terminal S1 subunit of S protein forms the globular head of the spike structure on the surface of coronaviruses and contains the receptor binding domain and neutralizing epitopes to determine host tropism and humoral immunity (Godet et al., 1994, Taguchi and Kubo, 1995, He et al., 2004, Ho et al., 2004, Lu et al., 2004, Zhou et al., 2004, Chen et al., 2011). The carboxyl-terminus S2 subunit of S protein constructs the stalk of the spike structure and consists of a transmembrane domain and fusion peptides to induce cell fusion and viral assembly (Spiga et al., 2003, Broer et al., 2006, Howard et al., 2008). Immunization by coronaviral S protein-based vaccines can produce protective neutralizing antibodies that prevent infection after challenge (Johnson et al., 2003, Zeng et al., 2004, Du et al., 2009, Shil et al., 2011).",

Several approaches have been also investigated to improve the low immunogenicity of DNA vaccine (Barouch, 2006), including co-administration of genes encoding the immunostimulatory molecules like IL-2 (Tang et al., 2008), cytosine-phosphate-guanine (CpG) motifs (Kinman et al., 2010), or granulocyte-macrophage stimulating factor (GM-CSF) (Tan et al., 2009) to enhance immune responses. Other approaches to improve immunogenicity of DNA vaccine included targeting DNA toward proper antigen presenting cells like dendritic cells (Kurzler and Weiner, 2004, Nchinda et al., 2008), applying prime-boost strategy by priming with DNA and boosting with a viral vector encoding the antigenic protein (Woo et al., 2005, Wang et al., 2008), and improving DNA delivery by electroporation or incorporation with nanoparticles to increase the amount and stability of DNA inside the transfected cells and thus enhance the protein expression level by transfected DNA (Otten et al., 2005, van Drunen Little-van den Hunk and Hannaman, 2010).",

Polyethyleneimine (PEI) is a widely used polymer and the size of the DNA\u2013PEI complex is suitable for endocytic uptake by non-phagocytic cells (Jeong et al., 2007). Once inside the cells, PEI absorbs proton ions during endosome acidification, leading to osmotic rupture of endosome and DNA release to enter the nucleus of the transfected cells (Boussif et al., 1995). The addition of polysaccharide-based polyanions, like hyaluronate (HA) improved the gene transfection efficiency of the DNA\u2013PEI complex by loosening up the complex to access the gene transcription machinery (Ito et al., 2006). Polycations with disulfide linkages, which could degrade in the reductive intracellular environment and release DNA more easily, achieved higher gene expression than their uncleavable counterparts (Neu et al., 2006). By applying the advantages exerted by HA and disulfide linkage, a ternary complex (DPH complex) consisting of DNA, a disulfide-crosslinked low molecular linear polyethyleneimine (CLPEI), and sodium hyaluronate was proved to enhance the transfection efficiency significantly (Xu et al., 2009).",

The full-length S protein of SARS-CoV has been shown to activate cell-mediated immune responses and induce antibody production to block viral binding, fusion, and infection (He et al., 2006, Kam et al., 2007). Most conformation-dependent neutralizing epitopes are located in the S1 subunit of IBV (Kant et al., 1992) but there are conformation-independent neutralizing epitopes found in 47 amino acids of S1 carboxyl-terminus and 20 amino acids of S2 amino-terminus (Kusters et al., 1989). Chickens inoculated with peptides with antigenic epitopes corresponding to amino acid residue 294\u2013314 (S1), 532\u2013537 (S1), or 566\u2013584 (S2) of IBV produced antibodies that provided more than 50% protection against IBV infection in kidney but no protection in trachea (Ignjatovic and Sapats, 2005). An exposed domain in the S1 subunit of SARS-CoV from amino acid residue 485\u2013625 induced antibody production to inhibit viral infection (Zhou et al., 2004). These studies suggested that the S fragment of coronavirus contains neutralizing epitopes and is capable of eliciting a protective antiviral antibody response.",

            "text": "DNA vaccination can generate both humoral and cellular immunity specific to protective antigens of various pathogens. After the delivery of DNA plasmids into cells, antigenic proteins are endogenously produced and presented by MHC class I, thus inducing CD8 cytotoxic T-cell responses. Therefore, DNA vaccines have the ability to mimic the effects of live attenuated vaccine without reversion to virulence due to recombination or mutations in live attenuated pathogens. Plasmids can be easily produced in bacteria without the risk of improper folding and instability to express recombinant proteins (Laddy and Weiner, 2006, Coban et al., 2008). Prime-boost strategy and the use of nanoparticles as aid in DNA delivery were undertaken to enhance the immunogenicity and protection efficacy of DNA vaccination in the present study. According to Woo's study (Woo et al., 2005), mice primed intramuscularly with S1 DNA vaccine and boosted with recombinant S1 protein produced by E. coli was shown to generate the highest neutralizing antibody titer against SARS-CoV infection compared to DNA vaccine or S1 protein alone. On the other hand, recombinant S1 protein expressed by E. coli induced high IgG levels but not high neutralizing antibody titer. This may be due to improper conformation and lack of glycosylation from the recombinant S1 protein expressed in a prokaryotic system. It appears that the conformation and post-translational modification of the S1 protein expressed in DNA-transfected cells is adequate to induce neutralizing antibodies. Thus, priming with DNA vaccine can overcome the issues related to conformation and glycosylation encountered in vaccination or immunization with recombinant S1 protein (Woo et al., 2005). In addition, the use of biodegradable polymeric nanoparticles is one of the potential means to deliver DNA. By combining the advantages of CLPEI and HA, the DNA-CLPEI-HA (DPH) system had a significantly higher (p\n < 0.05) transfection efficiency than the other polymer systems (Xu et al., 2009). The prime-boost regimen using 100 \u03bcg DNA in DPH complex as the first dose in the present study provided the same protection as the regimen using 750 \u03bcg DNA as the first dose at 3 and 10 dpi. The turkeys vaccinated with 100 \u03bcg DNA in DPH complex did not show any local tissue responses and lesions and had lower IFA scores and viral RNA loads in the ileum than the turkeys receiving 750 \u03bcg DNA as the first dose. However, the toxicity was revealed when the chickens received 300 \u03bcg DNA in DPH complex. Subcutaneous edema and hemorrhage in muscle and liver were observed in the inoculated chickens (unpublished data). Although the application of nanoparticles CLIPEI and HA can increase transfection efficiency of DNA vaccine and enhance protective immune responses triggered by DNA vaccine, but it is also critical to use the appropriate dose that does not cause any toxicity or tissue change.",

Such findings indicated that the frequency of DNA vaccination affected the kinetic and magnitude of the protective antibody response. From the study of infectious bursal disease virus (IBDV), chickens vaccinated with one dose of DNA vaccine showed no protection 10 days after viral challenge while chickens that received 2 or 3 doses of DNA vaccine showed 50\u2013100 or 80\u2013100% protection based on IBDV-induced bursal lesion scores (Chang et al., 2002). Additionally, DNA encoding hemagglutinin protein of influenza virus has been shown to increase hemagglutinin-specific antibody production in a dose-responsive manner with single or multiple injections of DNA (Deck et al., 1997, Robinson et al., 1997). Therefore, the protective antibody response against TCoV infection can be enhanced by increasing the dosage and/or frequency of the DNA vaccine.",

No significant up-regulated transcription of IFN\u03b3 was noted after vaccination in the present study, indicating that TCoV 4F/4R S fragment containing the neutralizing epitopes was not actively involved in activation or stimulation of cell-mediated immunity but primarily induced strong humoral immune response to TCoV. Down-regulated IFN\u03b3 level can result from the reduced number of natural killer cells, macrophages, activated Th1 CD4 T cells, and activated CD8 T cells (Franke et al., 2006) or the increased number of Th2 CD4 T cells (Zheng et al., 2011). Physical strained and intramuscular injections may result in stress leading to immunosuppression and inhibition of IFN\u03b3 production (Greenfeld et al., 2007). In addition, PEI may cause apoptosis and reduce the number of IFN\u03b3-producing cells even though PEI may affect all types of immune cells (Fischer et al., 1999). Therefore, reducing or eliminating stress-induced immunosuppression due to vaccination is an important factor to consider in induction of immunity to DNA vaccination.",

            "text": "Protection provided by vaccination against coronavirus infection involved both humoral and/or cellular immune responses (Seo et al., 2000, Marten et al., 2001, Yang et al., 2004, Thirion and Coutelier, 2009). Vaccinated mice protected from SARS-CoV infection produced high level of IgG and neutralizing antibodies with no significant Th1-biased immune responses (Yang et al., 2004, Woo et al., 2005). The protection was mediated by humoral but not a T-cell dependent immune mechanism because depletion of CD4 and CD8 T cells by using specific monoclonal antibodies did not affect vaccine-induced immunity. In addition, adoptive T-cell transfer showed that donor immune T cells were unable to reduce pulmonary viral replication in recipient animals while passive transfer of purified IgG from immunized mice provided immune protection (Yang et al., 2004). On the other hand, adoptive transfer of IBV primed \u03b1\u03b2T cells bearing CD8 antigens protected chicks from IBV infection and passive transfer convalescent IBV serum did not protect chickens against respiratory infection although the viral replication was delayed and kidney disease was prevented (Macdonald et al., 1981, Seo et al., 2000). From studies of mouse hepatitis virus (MHV), acute infection was primarily controlled by CD8 T cells but CD4 T cells, B cells, and NK cells contributed to reduce viral replication (Marten et al., 2001, Thirion and Coutelier, 2009). Thus, both humoral and cellular immunities provide optimal protection against coronaviral infection. DNA vaccination based on N and S1 gene provided more protection against TCoV infection in turkeys than DNA vaccination based on N gene alone in a previous study, suggesting that both humoral and cellular immunities are critical for protection against TCoV in turkeys since DNA vaccine encoding N protein of TCoV can induce cellular immune responses but not antibody responses (Ababneh, 2005). Therefore, future studies of DNA vaccination against TCoV infection will include DNA vaccine encoding neutralizing epitopes in S protein and T cells epitopes in N protein that should generate adequate humoral and cellular immune responses and offer optimal protection against TCoV infection. Because oral administration of vaccine is more suitable in field application and oral vaccination can stimulate protective mucosal immune responses, further investigation on oral delivery of TCoV DNA vaccine by fowl adenovirus (Johnson et al., 2003), attenuated Salmonella (Jiao et al., 2011, Woo et al., 2005), biodegradable nanoparticles (Plapied et al., 2010), or other methods is warranted.",
