Recently, the application of awake ECMO in patients with chronic end-stage respiratory diseases awaiting lung transplantation [9\u201312] and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease [13\u201315] has increased, but its use in severe ARDS patients is rare [16\u201318]. Several recent clinical physiological studies [19\u201321] have shown that, in severe ARDS cases, ECMO alone may be able to replace IMV for regulating spontaneous breathing effort and minute ventilation by ECMO gas flow. Therefore, awake ECMO may be a potential novel strategy to replace invasive mechanical ventilation for severe ARDS patients without multiple organ dysfunction [8, 16].",

From Extracorporeal Life Support Organization registry [24], a total of 4488 respiratory failure patients treated with ECMO from 1986 to 2013 were collected, 22% of whom needed ECMO support for more than 14 days (prolonged ECMO), especially since 2008, the number of prolonged ECMO increased markedly. It is still unclear how to wean reasonably from prolonged ECMO in ARDS patients. If ECMO alone can supply adequate gas exchange at this time [19\u201321], awake ECMO strategy with early extubation in prolonged ECMO patients may reduce the complications associated with invasive positive pressure ventilation, such as barotrauma and VAP, even may improve the prognosis [1]. However, the decision of when to implement awake ECMO is in doubt. Therefore, we first present our experience with 12 ARDS patients treated with awake ECMO to wait for native lung recovery during prolonged ECMO treatment.",

Recently, Rosenberg and colleagues reported that some severe ARDS patients may need more than 2\u20134 weeks before native lung recovery occurs [22], during which prolonged IMV will inevitably increase the risk of VAP. In our study, the incidence of VAP before awake ECMO was as high as 33%, similar to that reported by Grasselli [26]. Furthermore, 6 (50%) patients needed ECMO support for more than 4 weeks, and the longest duration of ECMO support was 121 days.

Reducing the occurrence of lung injury and promoting lung repair are the focus of ventilation management during the late stage of ARDS [29, 30]. Therefore, for late ARDS patients treated with ECMO, we speculate that when compared with the combination of ECMO and IMV, the early implementation of awake ECMO and extubation may further eliminate lung stress and strain of damaged lung tissue caused by invasive positive pressure ventilation (for example, 42% of awake ECMO patients appeared barotrauma before extubation). However, without invasive ventilatory support, the intensity of spontaneous breathing and transpulmonary pressure will increase, and lung injury in ARDS patients may be aggravated during awake ECMO [1, 8]. Recently, Mauri and colleagues showed that respiratory drive and spontaneous breathing effort during the late stage of ARDS could be adjusted precisely by ECMO gas flow [21]. Therefore, before extubation and awake ECMO, it should be carefully evaluated whether ECMO alone could easily regulate the intensity of spontaneous breathing, and then weigh the risks of high shear stress from increased spontaneous breathing effort [31] after extubation against the risks of ongoing sedative and invasive positive pressure ventilation.",

            "text": "Although awake ECMO has evident above-mentioned clinical benefits, the indications and optimal timing of awake ECMO for severe ARDS remain unclear. Hannover Medical Center first reported the successful use of awake ECMO in the early stage of severe ARDS to avoid intubation in strictly selected patients in case reports [16, 17]. In addition, Yeo and colleagues [18] used awake ECMO as a weaning strategy in 10 patients with severe postoperative ARDS and found that 70% of the patients were successfully weaned from IMV and ECMO, the mean ECMO duration was only 9.1 \u00b1 2.2 days. Be different from these researches, we tried to explore the clinical advantages of awake ECMO at the late stage of severe ARDS receiving prolonged ECMO treatment [median ECMO duration 26.0 (15.5, 64.8)]. In the early stage of the disease, to attenuate lung injury and reduce venous admixture, positive pressure ventilation is often required to open the alveoli and keep them open. Additionally, most severe ARDS patients need artificial airways for sputum drainage, airway protection and infection control. In fact, control ventilation mode in the early stage of severe ARDS may be more important than assisted ventilation mode to improve clinical outcomes [32]. Therefore, we think that awake ECMO could be considered as soon as possible if severe ARDS patients treated with prolonged ECMO meet the following indications, especially in the case of patients with a high risk of barotrauma and VAP: the recovery of pneumonia; consciousness and good airway protection capacity; a moderate respiratory support level with airway peak pressure < 20 cmH2O, PEEP< 10 cmH2O and FiO2 < 0.5; ECMO blood flow < 4 L/min; satisfactory gas exchange; and no serious ECMO-related complications. Regarding the type of oxygen therapy during the awake ECMO strategy, high-flow nasal cannula may be the best choice. A recent study confirmed that high-flow nasal cannula can effectively prevent respiratory failure and reintubation after extubation in acute respiratory failure patients [33]. In this study, 67% of the awake ECMO patients were supported by a combination of ECMO and high-flow nasal cannula.",

Chest x-ray shows progressive increase of right opacity and newly left pneumothorax. The left pneumothorax was improved with chest tube and lower mechanical ventilation support level due to ECMO. c: On ECMO 5 days. There is improved pulmonary infiltration and pneumothorax, the patient was extubated and underwent awake ECMO to avoid ventilator-associated pneumonia. d: On ECMO 30 days. The patient was weaned from ECMO after this chest x-ray. e: Fourteen days after weaning from ECMO and discharge. f: one month after discharge",
