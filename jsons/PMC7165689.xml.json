Wakita (National Institute of Infectious Diseases, Tokyo, Japan).19 Briefly, HCVcc was produced in Huh\u20107 cells electroporated with in vitro\u2013transcribed RNA of JFH\u20101 containing (JFH\u20101/Luc) or not, the Renilla luciferase reporter gene, and engineered to express A4 epitope20 and titer\u2010enhancing mutations.21 JFH\u20101 stocks were produced by further amplification in Huh\u20107 cells. In the JFH\u20101/Luc construct, the Renilla luciferase gene is fused with the viral open reading frame in a monocistronic configuration. With this virus, we verified that our luciferase data were in the linear range of the assay. The JFH\u20101/\u0394E1E2/Luc plasmid, containing an in\u2010frame deletion in the E1/E2 region, and the JFH\u20101/GND/Luc replication\u2010defective mutant have been described previously.20, 22 The inhibitory effect of the drugs was determined by quantifying infectivity by indirect immunofluorescence (IF) with the anti\u2010E1 mAb A416 or by measuring viral titers with the same Ab. For quantitative binding experiments, purified virus was obtained by precipitation of HCVcc\u2010infected Huh\u20107 cells supernatants with 8% polyethylene glycol 6000. Pelleted virus was then loaded onto a continuous 10%\u201040% iodixanol gradient. One\u2010milliter fractions were collected and the most infectious fractions were pooled.

To test the effect of FQ on the HCV life cycle, the compound was added to Huh\u20107 target cells before, as well as during, infection. FQ exhibited a dose\u2010dependent inhibition of HCV, indicating that FQ specifically affects the HCV life cycle with an estimated IC50 value of 0.8 \u03bcM (\u00b1 0.26) and an 90% inhibitory concentration (IC90) of 1.86 \u03bcM (\u00b1 0.08) (Fig. 1B,D). Similar results were obtained using the HepG2 cell line expressing CD81 (data not shown). The inhibitory effect was not the result of cytotoxicity, because parallel experiments did not show any toxic effect of the drug at the concentrations tested (Supporting Fig. 1). Furthermore, no cytotoxicity was observed in primary human hepatocytes at the concentrations used in our experiments (Supporting Fig. 1). FQ showed a 50% cytotoxic concentration (CC50) of 5.34 \u03bcM and a therapeutic index of 6.7. Similar inhibitory effects were observed with FQ\u2010treated cells infected with a chimeric virus containing the structural proteins of a genotype 3a isolate (Supporting Fig. 2), indicating that the antiviral effect is not specific to JFH\u20101 isolate. Parallel control experiments with well\u2010characterized HCV inhibitors are presented in Supporting Fig. 3. CQ was less effective against HCV (Fig. 1C,E). Indeed, IC50 and IC90 values for CQ were 3.93 (\u00b1 1.87) and 4.33 \u03bcM (\u00b1 0.53), respectively. Furthermore, CQ had a CC50 of 19.58 \u03bcM and a therapeutic index of 5. To determine whether HCV is the only member of the Flaviviridae family to be affected by FQ, we tested this compound on two other members of this viral family (BVDV and YFV). BVDV and YFV infections were performed on MDBK and Huh\u20107 cells, respectively. FQ showed some antiviral effect on these two viruses, albeit at a much higher concentration. Indeed, IC50 values were 6.74 (\u00b1 0.48) and 3.63 \u03bcM (\u00b1 0.64) for BVDV and YFV, respectively. Altogether, these results indicate that FQ has a potent antiviral activity against HCV.",

The highest decrease in HCVcc infection was observed when FQ was present during viral infection, and only a weak antiviral effect was detected when FQ was added postinfection (Fig. 2A,B). Similar results were obtained with CQ (Fig. 2C,D), and parallel control experiments with well\u2010characterized HCV inhibitors are presented in Supporting Figs. 4 and 5. These results suggest that FQ inhibits an early step of the HCV life cycle, which is most likely the entry step. To investigate the effect of FQ on HCV entry, we used the HCVpp system. These are retroviral cores carrying HCV glycoproteins in their envelope. In this context, only the early steps of the viral life cycle (i.e., virus interaction with receptors, uptake, and fusion) are HCV specific, whereas all later steps are dependent on retroviral nucleocapsid elements. Using this approach, FQ inhibited HCVpp entry in a dose\u2010dependent manner (Fig. 2F). Furthermore, this effect was specific of HCV envelope glycoproteins because FQ did not affect the entry of control pseudoparticles containing the envelope glycoprotein of the feline endogenous retrovirus, RD114. Together, these data indicate that FQ is an inhibitor of HCV entry.",

(A) To determine the effect of FQ on HCV binding, Huh\u20107 cells were inoculated for 1hour at 4\u00b0C with purified HCVcc at a MOI of 10 in the presence of solvent (DMSO), FQ, or 500 \u03bcg/mL of heparin. Cells were washed thrice with ice\u2010cold phosphate\u2010buffered saline, and total RNA was extracted. Bound HCV virions were detected by quantification of HCV gRNA by qRT\u2010PCR. Mean values \u00b1 standard deviation (error bars) of three different experiments are presented. Turkey's multiple comparison test was used for statistical analysis. No significant (ns) difference was observed between treated and untreated cells. Receptors expression was assessed in Huh\u20107 cells, exposed (FQ), or not (Ctrl) for 48 hours to 1 \u03bcM of FQ, by flow cytometry for CD81 and SRB1 (B), and by western blotting for CD81, SRB1, CLDN1, and OCLN (C). (D) To determine the effect of FQ on HCV internalization, purified HCV particles were bound to Huh\u20107 cells, as described in (A), followed by 30\u2010minute incubation at 37\u00b0C. Cells were then chilled on ice, and noninternalized virions were removed by trypsinization for 1 hour at 4\u00b0C, and internalized viral particles were determined by quantification of HCV gRNA by qRT\u2010PCR. To verify efficacy of trypsin treatment, virus was bound to cells at 4\u00b0C and then removed by trypsinization (data not shown). (E) Effect of FQ on fusion function of HCV envelope glycoproteins. 293T \u201cdonor\u201d cells coexpressing the HCV E1E2 or Chikungunya envelope glycoproteins and a luciferase marker gene under the control of the HIV\u20101 promoter were cocultured with Huh\u20107\u2010Tat \u201cindicator\u201d cells expressing the HIV\u20101 Tat protein. After 24 hours, cells incubated for 1 hour in the presence or absence of FQ were treated (at pH 5) for 3 minutes, and luciferase activity induced by fusion between donor and indicator cells was measured 72 hours later. Fusion in the absence of drug was taken as 100%. Graphs represent the averages of three independent experiments (**P < 0.01). A control experiment with pseudoparticles containing the envelope glycoproteins of Chikungunya confirmed that this virus is not sensitive to FQ treatment (data not shown).
