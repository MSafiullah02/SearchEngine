The RNA encodes six viral proteins (VP) that make up the viral capsid, and six non-structural proteins (NSP). The core is surrounded by an inner capsid, composed mostly of VP6, the primary group antigen,1, 8 and includes the epitope detected by most common diagnostic assays. Other structural proteins also seem to confer some degree of group specificity.9 The outer capsid is primarily composed of VP4 and VP7.10 VP4 contributes the spoke-like projections to the wheel-shaped appearance of rotavirus. This VP is cleaved by trypsin in vitro to yield VP5* and VP8*, which appear to play an important part in cellular attachment.9 The inner and outer capsids give the viral particle the double-layered icosahedral structure visualised on negative-stain electron microscopy.10\n",

In a normal host, rotaviral antigens are transported to Peyer's patches, undergo processing by B cells, macrophages, or dendritic cells and are presented to helper T cells. This cascade culminates in stimulation of rotavirus-specific B cell and cytotoxic T-lymphocyte-precursor expansion.29 Bernstein and colleagues30 noted that stool rotavirus IgA concentrations peaked 14\u201317 days after infection and persisted for longer than 1 year, but at declining concentrations. The researchers suggested that serum rotavirus IgA is a more consistent marker of rotavirus immunity than other antibody measurements.30 However, rotavirus-specific IgA is frequently undetectable in duodenal fluid or faeces in the first week of infection, although symptoms might resolve within that time.29 This pattern suggests a mechanism independent of humoral immunity. Offit29 notes that infected mature villous epithelial cells are steadily replaced by less-mature enterocytes, which may be less susceptible to rotavirus invasion. Increased peristalsis improves clearance of viral particles and the non-specific activity of interferons can prevent VP translation.29 De Bouissieu31 has reported that interferon \u03b1 concentrations correlate with a trend towards shorter duration of diarrhoea among patients who have rotavirus infection.",

In a prospective study of 200 Mexican infants followed up from birth, Valazquez and colleagues33 noted that by age 2 years 96% of infants had experienced a primary rotavirus infection. During the same period, nearly 70% of the infants experienced a second infection. More than 10% of the children studied had five or more rotavirus infections during the first 2 years of life. Yolken and colleagues34 had previously noted that by age 2 years, more than 85% of children had antibodies to two different rotavirus serotypes.

Primary infection with rotavirus typically occurs in infants between ages 6 months and 2 years, although infection in neonatal intensive-care units and severe infection in infants younger than 6 months are well documented.51, 52 In all age-groups, the classic presentation of rotaviral infection is fever and vomiting for 2\u20133 days, followed by non-bloody diarrhoea.53 The diarrhoea may be profuse, and 10\u201320 bowel movements per day are common. When examined, the stool from affected patients is generally devoid of faecal leucocytes. Especially when associated with vomiting, the diarrhoea of rotavirus infection can precipitate severe and even life-threatening dehydration. Infants with repeat rotavirus infections are generally less-severely affected than those with primary disease.33\n",

Data from several such trials are summarised in the table\n.35, 46, 47, 48, 54 For these volunteers, illness most frequently began 2\u20136 days after ingestion and continued for 1\u20134 days. About two-thirds of study participants had an antibody response, with more than half of all participants eventually shedding rotavirus. Symptoms were less common than evidence of infection, but most frequently included diarrhoea, fever, headache, malaise, nausea, or cramping. One participant passed 11 stools in 1 day.35 Among the volunteers, rotavirus particles were detectable in the stool",

            "text": "Although rotavirus can be linked to adult gastroenteritis in each of the other settings, adults who are in contact with children are at particularly high risk of infection. Transmission of rotavirus within families from children to parents seems to be a common event. Wenman and colleagues55 showed prospectively that rotavirus infection occurred in 36 of 102 adults caring for children with rotavirus infection. By contrast, only four of 86 adults whose children had no documented rotavirus infection became infected.55 Grimwood and colleagues57 confirmed this finding in a report that a third of adult family members in New Zealand developed evidence of rotavirus infection. The same phenomenon has been seen among parents of more severely ill children. Kim and colleagues104 found evidence of rotavirus infection in 55% of adult contacts of children who were admitted to hospital with rotavirus, compared with 17% of adult contacts whose children were not infected. More casual contact might also be sufficient to facilitate rotavirus transmission from children to adults. Rodriguez and colleagues105 reported that nine of 12 adults experienced illness after exposure to children infected with rotavirus in a playgroup. Although substantial evidence is lacking, child-to-adult transmission of rotavirus is accepted to occur with some frequency on paediatric wards. Many paediatric nurses, medical students, and house officers experience symptoms of gastroenteritis during the winter months when most paediatric rotavirus infections are encountered. Von Bonsdorff and colleagues106 described paediatric nurses at several different locations with acute gastroenteritis caused by rotavirus. Among seven hospital staff that developed diarrhoea after direct contact with children with diarrhoea staying in hospital, a rise in antibody titres was detected in three.104 Interestingly, in the same study, six of 45 medical students reported gastroenteritis. Three of the students had rotavirus particles present on electron microscopy and were noted to be more ill than the parents of the children who were infected. All had diarrhoea for 3\u20136 days and two of the three had low-grade fever and vomiting. Another case report supports transmission of rotavirus from children to hospital caretakers.107\n",

Rotavirus infection can occur in a similar number of patients to some bacterial pathogens. Sending a sample of rotavirus antigen for testing by ELISA or EIA could potentially cut costs if by doing so either hospital stay or procedures could be avoided. Such a cost-benefit analysis in adult patients has not been published. One limitation is that adults might shed less rotavirus in faeces than do children, further hampering diagnosis.100 We suggest that obtaining rotavirus antigen testing for patients admitted to hospital with risk factors for rotavirus infection will be cost effective if additional inpatient studies can be avoided. Determination of rotavirus infection may also be beneficial if infectious patients can be isolated to prevent nosocomial spread. A positive rotavirus antigen test might also allow physicians to avoid prescribing antibiotics for travel-related rotavirus infections.",

Several groups report oral administration of human serum immunoglobulins possessing antirotavirus activity to bind free rotavirus antigen. Guarino and colleagues116 noted a mean duration of diarrhoea of 76 h in children who received one oral dose of 300 mg/kg human serum immunoglobulin, compared with 131 h in children who did not. In a study involving three immunocompromised children with chronic rotavirus diarrhoea, oral administration of human serum immunoglobulins (IgG 150 mg/kg) cleared rotavirus antigen in all three, but rotavirus antigen recurred in two.117 Among adults, oral immunoglobulin administration of 5\u20136 g daily for 5 days to bone-marrow-transplant recipients has been successful.118\n",

Two sharply differing perspectives on the risk and benefits of the RRV-TV vaccine and the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices' confirmation of its decision to withdraw its recommendation for the vaccine have been put forward.126, 127 Other vaccines are under development.",
