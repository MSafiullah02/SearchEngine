            "text": "Maternal T cells from fetal or perinatal transplacental passage have been identified in up to 40% of patients with severe combined immunodeficiency (SCID), genetically heterogeneous immune disorders characterized by a dramatic reduction of number and function of T lymphocytes, as well as functional or quantitative defects of B lymphocytes and natural killer (NK) cells [1], [2], [3]. While immunocompetent newborns, who have effective T-cell immunity, can rapidly reject the histocompatibility leukocyte antigen (HLA) mismatched maternal lymphocytes, that bidirectionally pass between mother and foetus through the human placenta [4], SCID newborns fail to reject circulating maternal T cells. The maternally derived engrafted T cells, whose number ranges in the blood from 10 to several thousand/ml, are functionally incompetent and show limited or no proliferative response to mitogens. They also usually express a restricted T-cell receptor repertoire [5], a finding suggestive of transplacental passage of a very small number of T cells that successively expand in the host. In the majority of cases, SCID patients with maternal T-cell engraftment are asymptomatic, but approximately 30\u201340% of them have mild symptoms and signs such as eosinophilia, elevated liver enzymes with periportal T-cell infiltration, and erythema with skin T-cell infiltration. These hepatic and cutaneous manifestations are similar to those observed during the graft versus host disease (GvHD) developing after hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) [2]. Maternal T-cell engraftment was not previously described in the best known form of SCID resulting from mutations in the gene encoding for adenosine deaminase (ADA). In ADA-SCID patients, maternal T cells could probably be killed by the raised levels of deoxyadenosine (dAdo), the toxic metabolic substrate accumulated because of the deficient or impaired ADA activity [6]. Affected children usually present with typical clinical and immunological manifestations of SCID patients, together with peculiar features.",

Maternal engraftment is a common feature in SCID patients; engrafted T lymphocytes contain a high fraction of functional regulatory T cells, conferring a high-tolerance capacity that appears to represent a toleration advantage beside the severe immunodeficiency.

In rare cases, engrafted maternal T cell might persist for long time leading to partial reconstitution of immune function and delayed clinical presentation of SCID [10]. In our contest maternal engraftment test and enzymatic ADA assay were performed, to better define the disease. The presence of maternal engrafted T cells and residual ADA activity enzyme of our patient could have delayed the identification of ADA-SCID. The laboratory tests showed low number of CD3 + cells but toxic ADA metabolites suggested the diagnosis of ADA-SCID. The molecular analysis of ADA gene allowed the conclusive diagnosis.",
