In a study conducted by the National Neonatal Perinatal Database from 2002 to 2003, neonatal sepsis occurred in 3 of every 100 live births in India.2 Sepsis can be caused by bacteria or other sources and includes illnesses such as meningitis, pneumonia, and septicemia.3 Hepatic (liver) failure is another major cause of sepsis, and hemoperfusion\u2014a process in which the blood is filtered by passage through a cartridge containing adsorbent particles such as activated charcoal\u2014is a standard way to remove toxins from the blood of patients suffering from this condition.4\n",

However, they all face challenges in their application. Bioceramic implants typically exhibit poor resistance against fatigue failure and low fracture toughness, which poses a problem for bone-repairing purposes. Due to their elasticity mismatch with bone, metallic materials will lead to stress-shielding and bone resorption.

In addition, across the bamboo stem (for the bamboo Phyllostachys bambusoides), the average modulus elasticity is 18 GPa, which is the same as the value for human cortical bone. Bamboo also has fairly high longitudinal tensile, bending, and compressive strengths, all of which are necessary for a good biomaterial meant to repair or replace a load-bearing bone.10 The fact that bamboo also possesses silicon on the inner and outer surfaces of its stem means that it may have an easier time conducting bone mineralization.11 Plus, studies have shown that the porous nature of bamboo can help with the ingrowth and anchorage of bone.12\n",

This is a particularly significant development because many scientists believe that the formation of such an apatite layer is necessary for a biomaterial to properly bond to bone. After chemically removing surface fatty substances, the researchers grafted the bamboo with a polyethylene glycol-based polymer that can facilitate calcification because its polyether soft segment polymer can cause metal-ion chelation. The grafted bamboo samples were then soaked in one of two calcification solutions: accelerated calcification solution (ACS) or simulated body fluid (SBF). The bamboo then formed continuous layers of calcium phosphate, a major component of human bone. Although the bamboo did possess some cytotoxic leachable components that could pose a threat to patients, they could be largely removed by ethanol, methanol, and toluene.13\n",

A relatively recent development in the effort to combat such diseases is the strategy of attenuating the transduction of apoptotic signals in order to prevent neuronal cell death.16 Studies have shown that one way to go about doing this is to use lignin, a durable network polymer that accounts for 20\u201330 % of global plant biomass, making it the second most abundant organic plant substance.17 Scientists have devised a system to convert lignin into derivatives including lignophenols, which are very active, stable, and phenolic. These lignophenols demonstrated impressive neuro-protective abilities against oxidative stress-induced apoptosis. In one study, lig-8\u2014a lignocresol derived from bamboo\u2014derived the strongest neuro-protective activity against hydrogen peroxide-induced apoptosis in human neuroblastoma cells. Lig-8 also showed an anti-apoptotic effect by impeding the dissipation of the mitochondrial membrane permeability transition. In addition, flow cytometry revealed that lig-8 exhibited antioxidant properties in the cells exposed to hydrogen peroxide. Therefore, bamboo-derived lig-8 has the potential to be an effective neuro-protector, altering the signaling pathway of neuronal cell death and slowing the progress of neurodegenerative diseases.18\n",

The study examined the activity of lig-8 in two scenarios of oxygen-glucose deprivation (OGD) stress-induced neurotoxicity, which may be related to endoplasmic reticulum stress. The first was in the common neuronal differentiation model of pheochromocytoma (PC12) cells while the second was in vivo against retinal damage-induced mice. The tunicamycin\u2014a glycosylation inhibitor that is cytotoxic to many cells19\u2014induces cell death in PC12 cells. The proteasome inhibitor (PSI) also induces cell death, but in human neuroblastoma cells. Lig-8 demonstrated impressive neuro-protective effects in each case. OGD-induced cell damage displayed an inverse relationship to the concentration of lig-8 applied, with lig-8 at a 30 \u03bcM concentration demonstrating the same level of cell viability as the control PC12 cells. Lig-8 also inhibited tunicamycin-induced cell death in PC12 cultures, with the greatest neuro-protective effect occurring at a concentration of approximately 3 \u03bcM. Lig-8 treatment also substantially decreased PSI-induced apoptotic cell death in SH-SY5Y cells.",

Lectins\u2014proteins that can recognize and bind carbohydrates without altering them\u2014are able to inhibit the HIV-1 entry step by binding to the viral envelope\u2019s carbohydrate structures.34 One HIV-1 envelope protein, called gp120, is an attractive target because it contains multiple sites for glycosylation, a process crucial to the viral life cycle. Studies have shown that banana lectin (BanLec) is able to bind to high mannose structures on gp120 to prevent the cellular attachment and entry of HIV. Cells treated with BanLec demonstrated lower levels of strong-stop DNA, an early HIV reverse transcription product that can often be detected between when the virus enters the cell and when the virus is uncoated. In addition, although most of banana lectin\u2019s HIV inhibitory activity derives from its ability to block viral attachment, some HIV inhibition was still observed when BanLec was added after attachment.35 Therefore, BanLec could also be useful in preventing HIV transmission through post-attachment steps including virus fusion to the cell.",

Administering a combination of different lectins would further reduce the chances that a lectin-based anti-viral therapy would fail due to resistance. Even if the virus developed a resistance to BanLec and other lectins, it is possible that this would increase its vulnerability to the normal human immune response. This is because the changes in glycosylation that allow the virus to develop resistance to lectins also increase its susceptibility to neutralizing antibody responses.36\n",

Iron-deficiency anemia is a particularly significant problem for women in developing countries like India, where it is a common cause of maternal morbidity and mortality, pregnancy and delivery complications, and child-development problems.47 In 1990, the Government of India claimed that nearly 1 in every 5 maternal deaths in the country was related to anemia, and 2 years later the World Health Organization estimated that a staggering 88 % of pregnant Indian women were anemic.48 What is perhaps even more troubling is that despite widespread efforts and programs to lower the levels of anemia in India, the prevalence of anemia in pregnant mothers actually increased from 49.7 % in 1999 to 58.7 % in 2006.49 This indicates a need for a new approach to anemia treatment.",

This is likely due to the fact that at increased temperatures, the drugs moved faster, the boundary layer on the surface of the SP fibers thinned, and there were smaller aggregates of drugs, all of which enabled quicker, easier movement of drugs into the SP fibers. Higher temperatures can also increase drug sorption by breaking strong interactions between SP molecular chains, allowing drug molecules to enter. In addition, the study found that 5-Fu and Metformin had higher drug sorption rates than Diclofenac, likely due to their smaller size. This is because smaller drugs have an easier time maneuvering through the openings in SP fibers, so they also experience faster drug sorption at a given temperature.195\n",

Currently, TSP is used in the food industry as a thickening, stabilizing, and gelling agent.198 Modifying TSP to become carboxymethyl tamarind kernel polysaccharide (CMTKP) has high potential for pharmaceutical nanotechnology applications due to its greater stability and solubility in cold water.
