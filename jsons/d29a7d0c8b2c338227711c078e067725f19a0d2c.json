These were subsequently identified as 2019-novel coronary virus infection (COVID-19) [1, 2] . The total number of diagnosed patients reached 75,465 in China by Feb. 20th, 2020 [3] . Most of the early cases stated that they had previously visited Huanan Seafood Wholesale Market in Wuhan, but initially no direct evidence was found that the virus could be transmitted from person to person. As the cases accumulated, it was discovered that more and more clustered and sporadic patients had never visited the Huanan Seafood Wholesale market, but the evidence of human-to-human transmission had not yet surfaced when medical staff were repeatedly diagnosed with COVID-19 [4] . According to a recent release, more than 3,000 medical staff in China were diagnosed with COVID-19, among whom 6 died. Here we report two separate nosocomial outbreaks of SARS-CoV-2 involving 20 medical staff in a hospital within one week. To our knowledge, these two nosocomial outbreaks of COVID-19 were the earliest cases of patient to medical staff transmission.",

There were a total of 14 medical staff and three inpatients diagnosed with COVID-19 during theoutbreak. On Jan. 10 th , 2020, a 66-year old woman was admitted into the section because of fever and right sided abdominal pain. She was diagnosed with cholecystolithiasis complicated with infection. Chest computed tomographic (CT) scan revealed multiple lesions with pure ground-glass opacity (GGO) in both lungs. On Jan. 15 th , she was confirmed with a diagnosis of COVID-19 using the qRT-PCR assay for SARS-CoV-2. The patient was then transferred to Intensive Care Unit (ICU), after developing shortness of breath and high fever. Meanwhile, three patients within the same ward were diagnosed COVID-19 after developing similar symptoms (data of these three patients are not presented). On Jan. 13 th and Jan. 14 th , two doctors working in the same section, who had contact with the patient, presented with fever and cough. Without complete knowledge of the contagious nature of the disease, they joined in a multidisciplinary teamwork meeting (MDT) with 40 participants held by the department. The meeting lasted for several hours. 3e5 days after the meeting, 10 colleagues participating in the meeting (who had never made direct contact with the patient) presented with similar symptoms and were subsequently diagnosed with COVID-19. Moreover, 9 out of the 10 persons were seated near to the two doctors who had early symptoms at the meeting, suggesting that airborne transmission could be an important factor ( Figure 1 ). Additionally, two medical staff (case 3 and case 4 in Figure 2 ), who were not present in the meeting, had fever and onset of symptoms on the day of the meeting and the following day. The infection time might be earlier for these two cases.",

Based on our understanding, more than half of patients do not have respiratory symptoms and may exhibit atypical clinical phenotypes early during the illness [7, 8] . Some patients complained of indigestion, nausea, vomiting, and/or diarrhea. Others just stated an exacerbation of their usual symptoms, such as abdominal pain. These patients were thus likely misdiagnosed and admitted to a different department (from Department of Infectious Disease).

These results suggest that violation of standard infection control precautions will expose doctors to higher risk of infection. The lesson we learnt from these two nosocomial outbreaks is that medical staff are at high risk of infection from COVID-19. Particularly:",
