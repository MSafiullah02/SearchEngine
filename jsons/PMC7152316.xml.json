These initial phases of development occur in both genders (Table 5\u20131\n). Further development in the male apparently is limited, however, by androgenic or other male-associated substances [6,7]. Castration in male rat embryos early in gestation leads to female breast development, whereas ovariectomy in female rat embryos does not alter the course of development of the mammary anlage. Toward the end of pregnancy, initial phases of fetal mammary differentiation seem to occur under the influence of placental and transplacentally acquired maternal hormones, with transient development of the excretory and lactiferous ductular systems. Such growth, differentiation, and secretory activities are transient and regress soon after birth [7,8].",

Intense neural input in virgin and parturient, but not in currently pregnant, mammals has been shown to result in lactation. Lactation in goats can be induced by milking maneuvers. Adoptive breast-feeding also is well documented in primitive human societies. Sudden and permanent cessation of suckling can result in the termination of milk secretion and involution of the breast to the prepregnant state as the concentrations of prolactin decline. Estrogen and progesterone also may amplify the direct effects of prolactin or may induce additional receptors for this peptide hormone on appropriate target tissues in the breast.",

Increased estrogen and progesterone levels during pregnancy stimulate secretion of prolactin from the pituitary, whereas placental lactogen seems to inhibit the release of a prolactin-inhibiting factor from the hypothalamus. Prolactin, lactogen, estrogen, and progesterone all aid in preparing the mammary gland for lactation. Initially in gestation, an increased growth of ductule and alveolobular tissue occurs in response to estrogen and progesterone. In the beginning of the second trimester, secretory material begins to appear in the luminal cells. By the middle of the second trimester, mammary development has proceeded sufficiently to permit lactation to occur should parturition take place.",

Loss of placental hormone secretion results in an endocrine hypothalamic stimulation of prolactin release from the anterior pituitary gland and neural stimulation of oxytocin from the posterior pituitary. The stimulation of the nipple by suckling activates a neural pathway that results in release of prolactin and oxytocin. Prolactin is responsible for stimulating milk production, whereas oxytocin stimulates milk ejection (the combination is known as the let-down reflex). Oxytocin also stimulates uterine contractions, which the mother may feel while she is breast-feeding; this response helps to restore the uterus to prepregnancy tone. Milk production and ejection depend on the complex interaction of stimulation by the infant's suckling, neural reflex of the hypothalamus to such stimulation, release of hormones from the anterior and posterior pituitary, and response of the mammary gland to these hormones to complete the cycle.",

Lactose is secreted into the milk in a similar manner, whereas many monovalent ions, such as sodium, potassium, and chloride, depend on active transport systems based on sodium-potassium adenosine triphosphatases (Na+,K+-ATPases). In some situations, the mammary epithelium, which may behave as a \u201cmammary barrier\u201d between interstitial fluid derived from blood and the milk because of the lack of space between these cells, may \u201cleak,\u201d permitting direct diffusion of components into the milk.

The relative amounts of these components change during the course of lactation, generally with less fat and more protein in early lactation than in late lactation.

Lactose (a disaccharide of glucose and galactose) also may be important to the neonate as a carrier of galactose, which may be more readily incorporated into gangliosides in the central nervous system than galactose derived from glucose in the neonate [35]. Also, glycogen may be synthesized more efficiently from galactose than from glucose in the neonate because of the relatively low activity of glucokinase in early development [36]. Human milk also contains other sugars, including glucose and galactose and more than 100 different oligosaccharides [37]. These oligosaccharides may have protective functions for the infant, especially with respect to their ability to bind to gastrointestinal pathogens [38].",

They are structural components of brain and retinal membranes and may be important for cognitive and visual development. In addition, they may have a role in preventing atopy [43]. Numerous studies have found that infants fed formula without docosahexaenoic acid or arachidonic acid have reduced red blood cell amounts of these fatty acids [[44], [45], [46]]; however, findings in visual and cognitive functional studies in term infants have been inconsistent [47,48]. These studies have been complicated by the finding of slower growth in some preterm infants fed formulas supplemented with long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acids [45,46]. The inconsistent findings in infants fed supplemented formula may reflect the difficulty in determining the optimal amounts of docosahexaenoic acid and arachidonic acid and their precursors linoleic and linolenic acids in such supplemented formulas.

On the basis of available information, most IgA-producing cells observed in milk have their origin in the precursor immunocompetent cells in the gut-associated lymphoid tissue (GALT) and bronchus-associated lymphoid tissue (BALT). Exposure of IgA precursor B lymphocytes in GALT or BALT to microbial and dietary antigens in the mucosal lumen is an important prerequisite for their initial activation and proliferation. Such antigen-sensitized cells eventually are transported through the systemic circulation to other mucosal surfaces, including the mammary glands, and, as plasma cells, initiate the synthesis of immunoglobulin against specific antigens previously experienced in the mucosa of the respiratory or alimentary tract [87]. It has been proposed that T cells observed in the milk also may be derived from GALT and BALT in a manner similar to that of IgA-producing cells. Little or no information is available regarding the site of origin of other cellular or soluble immunologic components normally present in human milk. Specific antibody and cellular immune reactivity against many respiratory and enteric bacterial and viral pathogens and ingested food proteins also is present in human breast milk (Table 5\u20135\n).",

The IgA dimers produced by plasma cells at the basal surface of the mammary epithelium are bound by the polymeric immunoglobulin receptor on the basolateral surface of mammary epithelial cells, which transports them through these cells, where they are released into the alveolar spaces as an 11S IgA dimer associated with a portion of the polymeric immunoglobulin receptor referred to as the secretory component [90].",

Synthesis of IgA seemed to be slightly increased in the parous women. IgA was found in the mammary tissues during the proliferative stage of the menstrual cycle in the nulliparous women and during the luteal phase in the parous women.

In limited observations, combinations of prolactin with estrogen and progesterone (in concentrations observed normally at the beginning of parturition) seemed to have an amplifying effect on the synthesis and secretion of IgA from peripheral blood lymphocytes [99]. This observation raises the possibility that the high levels of sIgA observed in colostrum and milk may be partly the result of selective, hormonally mediated proliferation of antigen-sensitized IgA cells in the peripheral blood. The immunoglobulin could acquire a secretory component during its passage through the mammary epithelium and eventually appear in the colostrum or milk as mature sIgA. Although the appearance of sIgA antibody in milk characteristically follows antigenic exposure in GALT or BALT, the precise nature of the IgA content in milk seems to be determined by various other factors operating in the mucosal lymphoid tissue. These factors include the dendritic cell and regulatory T-cell network in GALT and possibly in BALT [100,101], the nature of antigens (soluble proteins versus particulate microbial agents) [102], and the route of primary versus secondary antigenic exposure [103].",

The estimates of lactational immunoglobulin delivered to the breast-fed infant at different periods of lactation are presented in Table 5\u20136. Most ingested IgA is eliminated in the feces, although 10% may be absorbed from the intestine into the circulation within the first 18 to 24 hours after birth [106]. Feces of breast-fed infants contain functional antibodies present in the ingested milk [107]. Other studies support the finding of prolonged survival of milk IgA in the gastrointestinal tract. Infants fed human milk have shown the presence of all immunoglobulin classes in the feces. Fecal IgA content was three to four times greater than that of IgM after human milk feeding. Comparative studies on survival of human milk IgA and bovine IgG in the neonatal intestinal tract have suggested that the fecal content of IgA may be 14 to 20 times greater after human milk feeding than that of bovine IgG after feeding of bovine immunoglobulin [108].",

Colostrum and milk can inhibit the activity of E. coli and Vibrio cholerae enterotoxins in experimental settings [112]. The antitoxic activity of human milk seems to correlate well with its IgA content, but not with its IgM and IgG content. Precoating of V. cholerae with specific sIgA protects infant mice from disease [113]. Similar results have been obtained by using specific purified milk sIgA in preventing E. coli\u2013induced and Shigella dysenteriae\u2013induced disease in rabbits [114]. Less definite, but suggestive, is a study conducted with human milk feeding relative to the intestinal replication of orally administered live poliovirus vaccine [115]. This study found that breast-feeding may reduce the degree of seroconversion for poliovirus antibody in the vaccinated infants. Because antipolio IgA is present in human milk and colostrum, the investigators concluded that specific IgA may bind poliovirus and influence viral replication in the intestinal mucosa. Extensive experience with oral polio immunization worldwide has not found a convincing association, however, between breast-feeding and live vaccine failures. Other studies have shown that the magnitude of poliovirus replication in the intestine is determined by the presence and level of preexisting sIgA antibody. With high levels of intestinal IgA antibody, little or no replication of vaccine virus was observed in the gut. With lower levels, varying degrees of viral replication could be shown [116].",

Colostral cells also elicit antibody-dependent and lectin-dependent cellular cytotoxic responses. The NK and the antibody-dependent and lectin-dependent responses in colostral cells have been observed to be significantly lower than those of autologous peripheral blood cells. Reduced cellular cytotoxicity of colostral cells also has been observed against virus-infected targets and certain bacteria. With several specific virus-infected targets, colostrum and milk cells conspicuously lack cellular cytotoxicity compared with autologous peripheral blood cells. There is also an apparent exclusion of cytolytic T cells in the milk that are specific for certain human leukocyte antigens (HLA) [138,139].",

The CD4+/CD8+ ratio in milk is significantly lower than the ratio observed in peripheral blood and is not due to an increase of CD8+ cells in the peripheral blood of women during the postpartum period. Colostral and milk T lymphocytes manifest in vitro proliferative responses on stimulation with numerous mitogens and antigens. Several studies have shown a selectivity in lymphocyte stimulation responses in colostral and milk lymphocytes to various antigens compared with peripheral blood lymphocyte responses [140,141]. Antigens such as rubella virus stimulate T lymphocytes in secretory sites and milk and in systemic sites [140]. By contrast, E. coli K1 antigen, whose exposure is limited to mucosal sites, produces stimulation of lymphoproliferative responses only in milk lymphocytes. These findings support the concept of select T-cell populations in the mammary gland.",

The decreased reactivity of milk lymphocytes to phytohemagglutinin may be partly the result of a relative deficiency of certain populations of T cells in milk. Macrophage\u2013T cell interactions also have been postulated to be responsible for this relative hyporesponsiveness [140], although it is unknown whether the effects are the result of decreased helper or increased regulatory function. Studies have shown that milk lymphocytes exhibit reduced responses to allogeneic cells, but display good ability to stimulate alloreactivity [138]. Generally, the T-cell proliferative responses to phytohemagglutinin and tetanus toxoid in breast-fed infants seem to be significantly higher than the responses in bottle-fed infants, possibly secondary to the presence of maternally derived cell growth factors and other lymphokines in human milk [136,142].",

In addition, the proportion of T cells that display other phenotypic markers of activation, including CD25 (IL-2R) and HLA-DR, is much greater than that in blood [123,144]. Consistent with their memory phenotype, T cells in human milk produce IFN-\u03b3 [143]. A significantly greater number of CD4+ T cells in colostrum express the CD40 ligand (CD40L), which helps these cells provide help for B-cell antibody production and macrophage activation (see Chapter 4 for more details) compared with autologous or heterologous blood T cells [145]. The function of these memory T cells in the recipient human infant is currently unknown, however. Mucous membrane sites in the alimentary or respiratory tract, or both, of the recipient infant would seem to be potential entry sites for human milk leukocytes. Very few memory T cells are detected in blood in infancy [146]. It is possible that maternal memory T cells in milk may help compensate for the developmental delay in their production in the infant.",

Although the neutrophils are phagocytic and produce toxic oxygen radicals, they do not respond well to chemoattractants by increasing their adherence, polarity, or directed migration in in vitro systems [156]. This diminished response was found to be due to prior activation in that the neutrophils in milk displayed a phenotypic pattern that is typical of activated neutrophils.

It is unknown, however, whether the characteristic proportions of macrophages, T lymphocytes, other cytotoxic cells, or epithelial cells are designed for any specific functions localized to the mammary gland in the lactating mother or to epithelium or lumen of the intestinal or respiratory mucosa of the breast-feeding infant, or both.",

The paucity of NK and other cytotoxic cells in the colostrum may have a role for the breast-feeding neonate, especially in influencing the antigen processing and uptake of replicating microorganisms and their immune response at systemic or mucosal levels or both. Although further elucidation of the functions of these cellular elements in the mammary glands and the suckling neonate is needed, it is likely that their presence in the milk represents a highly selective phenomenon and not a mere contamination with peripheral blood cells.",

More than 90% of the lactoferrin in human milk is in the form of apolactoferrin (i.e., it does not contain ferric iron) [187], which competes with siderophilic bacteria and fungi for ferric iron [[188], [189], [190], [191], [192]] and disrupts the proliferation of these microbial pathogens. The epithelial growth-promoting activities of lactoferrin in human milk also may aid in the defense of the recipient infant [193]. The mean concentration of lactoferrin in human colostrum is 5 to 6 mg/mL [194]. As the volume of milk production increases, the concentration decreases to about 1 mg/mL at 2 to 3 months of lactation [194,195].",

The mean intake of milk lactoferrin per day in healthy breast-fed, full-term infants is about 260 mg/kg at 1 month of lactation and 125 mg/kg by 4 months [199]. The quantity of lactoferrin excreted in the stools of low-birth-weight infants fed human milk is approximately 185 times that excreted in stools of infants fed a cow's milk formula [202]. That estimate may be too high, however, because of the presence of immunoreactive fragments of lactoferrin in the stools of infants fed human milk [203].

By contrast, human milk contains a host of anti-inflammatory agents [214], including a heterogeneous group of growth factors with cytoprotective and trophic activity for the mucosal epithelium, antioxidants, antiproteases, cytokines and cytokine receptors and antagonists, and other bioactive agents that inhibit inflammatory mediators or block the selected activation of leukocytes.

These and a host of hormones [221], including insulin-like growth factor, vascular endothelial growth factor, growth hormone\u2013releasing factor, hepatocyte growth factor, prolactin, leptin, and cortisol [222], may affect the growth and maturation of epithelial barriers, limit the penetration of pathogenic microorganisms and free antigens, and prevent allergic sensitization. Corticosterone, a glucocorticoid that is present in high concentrations in rat milk, speeds gut closure in the neonatal rat [223]. Although macromolecular absorption does not seem to be as marked in the human neonate [[224], [225], [226]], the function of the mucosal barrier system in early infancy is important to host defense, and this system may be affected by factors in human milk. In this regard, the maturation of the intestinal tract as measured by mucosal mass, DNA, and protein content of the small intestinal tract seems to be influenced by milk, particularly early milk secretions [227].",

IL-10 is present not only in the aqueous phase of the milk, but also in the lipid layer. Its bioactive properties were confirmed by the finding that human milk samples inhibited blood lymphocyte proliferation and that this property was greatly reduced by treatment with anti\u2013IL-10 antibody. Mice with a targeted disruption in the IL-10 gene, when raised under conventional housing conditions, spontaneously develop a generalized enterocolitis that becomes apparent at the age of 4 to 8 weeks (time of weaning) [232]. These observations suggest that IL-10 in rat milk, and perhaps in human milk, may play a crucial role in the homeostasis of the immature intestinal barrier by regulating aberrant immune responses to foreign antigens.",

In this study, anti\u2013IL-6\u2013neutralizing antibodies inhibited IgA production by colostrum mononuclear cells, suggesting that IL-6 may be involved in the production of IgA in the mammary gland. The presence of IL-6 in milk also has been shown by immunoassays [269,271,273,274]. Similarly, IL-6 is localized in high-molecular-weight fractions of human milk [273]. The association of IL-6 with its own receptor has not been studied in milk, although the expression of IL-6 receptor by the mammary epithelium [271] and in secreted form in the milk [233] may explain the high molecular weight of this cytokine in human milk. The expression of IL-6 messenger ribonucleic acid (mRNA) and protein in milk cells and in the mammary gland epithelium suggests that milk mononuclear cells and the mammary gland are likely major sources of this cytokine [270,271,275].",

As described previously, the mammary secretions of the nonlactating breast contain sIgA, although the amount seems to be much lower than in the lactating breast [285]. Mammary secretions of patients with galactorrhea seem to contain sIgA in concentrations similar to those of normal postpartum colostrum [286]. Although malnutrition has been associated with reduced secretory antibody response in other external secretions, maternal malnutrition does not seem to affect the total sIgA concentration or antimicrobial-specific antibody activity in the milk [287].

Comparative studies conducted during the first 12 weeks of lactation suggest that the mean concentrations of lactoferrin and lysozyme are higher in preterm than in term milk. sIgA is the predominant immunoglobulin in preterm and in term milk, although the sIgA concentration seems to be significantly higher in preterm milk collected during the first 8 to 12 weeks of lactation. sIgA antibody activity against certain organisms (E. coli somatic antigen) in the preterm milk was observed to be less than, or at best similar to, that found in term milk. In addition, the number of lymphocytes and macrophages in milk seems to be lower at 2 weeks, but significantly higher at 12 weeks in milk from mothers with preterm (born at 34 to 38 weeks of gestational age) infants than in milk from mothers with full-term infants [288]. The authors of these investigations have proposed that some of the observed changes may reflect the lower volume of milk produced by mothers delivered of preterm infants. The possibility remains that changes in the immunologic profile of preterm milk may be a consequence of inadequate stimulation by the preterm infant, alterations in the maternal hormonal milieu, or other factors underlying premature delivery itself.",

Large milk protein peptides and bovine serum albumin have been shown to enter the circulation and to induce a circulating antibody response.

A preventive and therapeutic role for breast-feeding also has been suggested in nursery outbreaks of diarrheal disease caused by enteropathogenic strains of E. coli [290] and rotavirus [291]. Breast-feeding plays an inhibitory role in the appearance of E. coli O83 agglutinins found in the feces of colonized infants. In addition, the diverse serotypes of aerobic, gram-negative bacilli present in the oropharynx and the gastrointestinal tract of the neonate may serve as a source of antigen to boost the presensitized mammary glands, leading to a further modulation of specific bacterial growth in the mucosa [292]. The precise role of antibody that blocks adherence of these pathogens to the gut and the effects of other factors, such as lactoperoxidase, lactoferrin, lysozyme, and the commensal flora, in those situations are uncertain.",

Ample experimental animal data on the value of specific colostral antibody in preventing diarrheal illness are available from studies of colostral deprivation. These include colibacteriosis associated with E. coli K88 in swine; rotaviral gastroenteritis in cattle, swine, and sheep; and diarrheal illness associated with transmissible gastroenteritis of swine [294]. In humans, cholera is rare in infancy, especially in endemic areas where the prevalence of breast-feeding is high. The experience with an outbreak of cholera in the Persian Gulf lends support to the possibility that the absence of breast-feeding is an important variable in increasing the risk of cholera in infancy.",

Studies done in Japan have noted a fivefold decrease in incidence of rotaviral infection among breast-fed infants younger than 6 months. Most rotavirus infections in neonates are asymptomatic, regardless of breast-feeding or bottle-feeding [[295], [296], [297]].

Longitudinal follow-up of a large cohort of infants during a community outbreak of rotavirus has shown that attack rates of rotavirus infection were similar in breast-fed and in bottle-fed infants. The frequency of clinical disease with diarrhea seemed to be significantly lower in breast-fed infants, however. The protection observed in these patients was more a reflection of altered microbial flora from breast-feeding than of specific immunologic protection against rotavirus. Breast milk contains sIgA directed against rotavirus, with the greatest concentrations in colostrum and lower amounts in mature milk; neutralization of rotavirus by breast milk correlates imperfectly with antibody concentrations measured by enzyme immunoassay, suggesting that other factors present in milk contribute to rotavirus neutralization [301]. It seems that breast-feeding provides significant protection against diarrheal disease, although the mechanisms of such protection remain to be more fully defined [299,300].",

Some pediatric centers have claimed virtual absence of necrotizing enterocolitis in breast-fed infants; however, many instances of the failure of milk feeding to prevent human necrotizing enterocolitis also have been reported [307]. Outbreaks of necrotizing enterocolitis related to Klebsiella and Salmonella species secondary to banked human milk feedings have been documented [124,308,309]. In an asphyxiated neonatal rat model of necrotizing enterocolitis, the entire syndrome could be prevented with feeding of maternal milk. The crucial factor in the milk seemed to be the cells, probably the macrophages [124]. It also is possible that antibody and nonspecific factors play a role, as does establishment of a gut flora. Prophylactic oral administration of immunoglobulin has been found to have a profound influence on the outcome of necrotizing enterocolitis in well-controlled studies [309]. Penetration of the gut by pathogens and antigens is increased with ischemic damage, and noncellular elements of milk may aid in blockage of this transit [310].",

Since the first report in 1936 [322], numerous published studies have addressed the effect of infant feeding on the development of atopic disease and asthma. Beneficial results of breast-feeding as prophylaxis against atopy have been observed in most of the studies; however, in others, beneficial effects were reported only in infants with a genetically determined risk for atopic disease.

Several serious methodologic drawbacks have been noted in this analysis, however.

The differences in the prevalence of atopy persisted when the groups were divided according to positive or negative atopic heredity. The atopy manifestations in the different infant feeding groups did not remain constant with age.

These mucosal immunologic events have been the basis for the concept of immune exclusion. Immune exclusion is not absolute, however, because uptake of some antigens across the gut may be enhanced rather than blocked by interaction with antibody at the mucosal surface. Beginning with the observations of IgA-deficient patients, it has become clear that the absence of the IgA barrier in the gut is associated with an increased incidence of circulating antibodies directed against many food antigens and an increased occurrence of atopic-allergic diseases [325]. Some studies have noted complement activation in serum after feeding of bovine milk to children with cow's milk allergy. The neonate is similar in some respects to the IgA-deficient patient [327], and increased transintestinal uptake of food antigen with consequent circulating antibody formation in the premature infant has been reported [328]. Other studies have suggested that early breast-feeding, even of short duration, is associated with a decreased serum antibody response to cow's milk proteins [226]. Prolonged breast-feeding not only may partially exclude foreign antigens through immune exclusion, but may also, because the mother's milk is the infant's sole food, prevent their ingestion [329]. Intact bovine milk proteins and other food antigens and antibodies have been observed, however, in samples of colostrum and milk [8].",

Adoptive experiments in suckling ferrets have shown that protection of the young against respiratory syncytial virus can be transferred in colostrum containing specific antibody. The neonatal ferret gut is quite permeable, however, to macromolecules and permits passage of large quantities of virus-specific IgG. In the absence of either documented antibody or cellular transfer in the human neonate across the mucosa, any mechanisms of protection against respiratory syncytial virus and other respiratory pathogens remain obscure.",

In each of these instances, several case reports have appeared warning against deficiencies that have resulted in clinical consequences to the neonate. Hemorrhagic disease reported in a few breast-fed infants was successfully treated with vitamin K [345]. These infants did not receive vitamin K at birth. Mothers who practice unusual dietary habits, such as strict vegetarianism, may have reduced levels of vitamin B12 and folic acid in their milk, and deficiencies in breast-fed infants of such mothers have been reported [346,347]. Cases of rickets in breast-fed infants have been reported, particularly during winter among infants not exposed to the sun [34,348]. Deficiency of carnitine, a nutrient responsible for modulating fat absorption, also has been reported to result in clinical symptoms in breast-fed infants in mothers ingesting unusual diets [61,349]. These concerns can best be addressed in almost all cases by counseling mothers regarding nutritional practices and by the provision of supplemental vitamins and other micronutrients when appropriate; this is the case in the developed world and even more so in the developing world where the untoward consequences of not breast-feeding are particularly great [293].",

In areas of the world where infectious diseases and malnutrition are important causes of death early in life, the beneficial effects of breast-feeding often outweigh the potential risk of HIV transmission through breast-feeding. Studies in such settings have shown that HIV-free survival at 7 months of age is similar in exposed infants that were breast-fed or formula-fed from birth [[360], [361], [362]]. Studies in Africa show that mothers who exclusively breast-feed in the first 6 months of life have reduced risk of HIV transmission compared with mothers who supplement breast-feeding with other foods and milk sources [360,361,363]. In areas of the world where the burden of infectious diseases and malnutrition is high and where alternatives to breast milk that provide adequate nutrition are unacceptable, affordable, feasible, and safe, exclusive breast-feeding is recommended by the WHO and other authorities for women whose HIV status is unknown and for women known to be HIV-infected [293,344,358,364]. The WHO policy also stresses the need for continued support for breast-feeding by mothers who are HIV-negative, improved access to HIV counseling and testing, and government efforts to ensure uninterrupted access to nutritionally adequate human milk substitutes [344].",

African American and Hispanic mothers, mothers of lower socioeconomic status who are participants in the Women, Infants, and Children (WIC) program of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, and mothers who live in the southern regions of the United States are much less likely to breast-feed. The low rate of breast-feeding for mothers enrolled in WIC is of particular concern because that agency has a specific policy to encourage breast-feeding. Many states now depend on formula manufacturer rebates to fund part of their WIC programs, however, creating a conflict of interest. The disturbing part of the demographic pattern of breast-feeding in the United States is that the infants of lower socioeconomic status mothers, who would accrue the greatest health and economic benefits from breast-feeding, are those least likely to be breast-fed.",

One of the more complete models designed to explain breast-feeding behavior includes components that address maternal attitudes and family, societal, cultural, and environmental variables [366]. Individual studies have shown that the maternal decision-making process is closely related to the social support and influence that come from the family members surrounding the mother [367]. The husband in particular seems to have a strong positive influence, whereas the mother's mother may have a negative influence on the breast-feeding decision. Social support seems to be different among ethnic groups, as are maternal attitudes; such differences may provide one explanation for differences in breast-feeding behavior among ethnic groups [368,369]. Higher rates of exclusive breast-feeding have been observed for infants born in U.S. hospitals who follow the practices recommended by the WHO/United Nations Children's Fund Baby-friendly Hospital Initiative, which emphasizes 10 steps that promote successful breast-feeding [370].",

Milk IgA antibodies generally induce antimicrobial protection in the absence of any inflammation.

For millions of years, maternal products of lactation delivered through the process of breast-feeding have been the sole source of nutrition and immunity during the neonatal period and early infancy for all mammals, including the human infant. During the past 150 to 300 years, human societies have undergone remarkable changes, which have had a major impact on the basic mechanisms of maternal-neonatal interaction, breast-feeding, and the environment. Such changes include introduction of sanitation and nonhuman milk and formula feeds for neonatal nutrition, use of antimicrobial agents, introduction of processed foods, and exposure to newer environmental macromolecules and dietary antigens. The introduction of such human-made changes in the neonatal environment has had a profound impact on human homeostatic mechanisms, while allowing new insights into the role of breast-feeding in the developing human neonate.",

This information has been reviewed by Hanson in an elegant monograph [372] and by others [86]. Despite the overwhelmingly protective role attributed to natural breast-feeding and the evolutionary advantages related to the development of lactation, several infectious agents have acquired, during the course of evolution, the ability to evade immunologic factors in milk and to use milk as the vehicle for maternal-to-infant transmission. The potential for the acquisition of infections, including HIV, HTLV, CMV, and possibly other pathogens, highlights potential hazards of breast-feeding in some clinical situations. It is reasonable to conclude that the development of lactation, the hallmark of mammalian evolution, is designed to enhance the survival of the neonate of the species and that breast-feeding may have a remarkable spectrum of immediate and long-term protective functions.",
