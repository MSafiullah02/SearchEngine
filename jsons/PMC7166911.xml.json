In a recent review for radiologic imaging of viral agents that may cause pneumonia, the general radiologic findings of hMPV infections were followed as bilateral centrilobular nodules, GGO, and multilobar infiltrations; however, there was no information about nodular consolidation. In addition, they noted that the radiologic findings of hMPV infections were most commonly reported in patients with hematologic malignancy, but there were limited data on immunocompetent patients.9 Similar radiologic findings in hMPV infection among immunocompromised patients have been reported in different studies.15, 16, 17 Karimata et al18 recently reported 105 nonimmunocompromised cases of hMPV infection in their study and bronchial wall thickenings were the most commonly seen radiologic findings in both CR and CT. Multilobar distribution was seen in all cases and lobular opacity was one of the leading findings in CT in the same study.Our populations were mostly composed of immunocompetent patients and nodular consolidation, which is generally seen in bacterial infection and was seen in 29% of CT.
