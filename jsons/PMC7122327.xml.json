            "text": "Porcine epidemic diarrhea (PED) first appeared in England and Belgium in the 1970s. The etiological agent of the disease is porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV), which belongs to the order Nidovirales, genus Alphacoronavirus, and family Coronaviridae (EN 1977; Bridgen et al. 1993; Duarte et al. 1993). It consists of a single-stranded positive-sense RNA genome of approximately 28 kb in size with gene order 5\u2032-replicase (1a/1b)-S-ORF3-E-M-N-3\u2032. The viral genome encodes three nonstructural protein, Pol 1a/1b and ORF3, and four major structural proteins, the spike (S) glycoprotein, nucleocapsid (N) protein, membrane (M) glycoprotein, and envelope (E) protein. The S protein of PEDV is a type 1 transmembrane envelope protein and consists of the S1 and S2 domains. The S protein is responsible for the viral entry via specific binding of the S1 domain with the cellular receptor, fusion and interaction of the S2 domain with host cellular membrane, and for induction of neutralizing antibodies in the host (Bosch et al. 2003). The M and E proteins are associated with virus assembly via interacting with S and N proteins (Klumperman et al. 1994). The primary role of N protein is to pack the viral genomic RNA into viral particles (Spaan et al. 1983).",

Possibly due to the fast turnover time (2\u20133 days) of enterocytes from crypt stem cells in postweaning pigs as well as the low virulence of traditional PEDV strains, the affected piglets usually show transient diarrhea with low or without mortalities.",

Factors underlying the potential pathogenesis of the PEDV outbreaks and the high mortality in piglets include the mutation of the virus (Chiou et al. 2015; Pasick et al. 2014), the lacking of maternal antibodies for protection of the piglets, and the slower turnover rate of enterocytes (5\u20137 days) of the neonatal piglets as compared to postweaning pigs (2\u20133 days) (Jung and Saif 2015a; Straw et al. 2006).",

The CV777-based vaccine is frequently used in the field. Since late 2010, PEDV-infected piglets, regardless of vaccination or immune status, showed large-scale outbreaks of PED. These variants caused severe watery diarrhea in pigs of all ages and high death rate in neonatal and suckling piglets. Based on the phylogenetic analysis of full-length sequences of the S gene of PEDVs isolated in China, both G1 and G2 strains are concurrently isolated. While China G2 PEDV strains share 96\u201399 % homologies to the CV777-based vaccine strain, the China G1 PEDV strains only share 93\u201395 % similarity to the CV777-based vaccine strain as well as China historic PEDV strains. These China G1 PEDV strains present several nucleotides insertions and deletions in the S gene (Li et al. 2012). Comparing the G1 PEDV strains with the CV777-based vaccine strain, there are two to three amino acid mutations in the neutralizing epitope SS6 and one to eight amino acid differences in the CO-26 K equivalent epitope (COE) domain (499-638 aa) in the S protein. These mutations have been speculated to represent the viral evolution through escaping from the antibodies derived from the CV777-based vaccine or the historic PEDV strains in several studies (Chen et al. 2013; Hao et al. 2014).",

PEDV vaccines, such as the CV777-based or DR13-based vaccines, are not routinely used in Taiwan. Nearly at the same time as in North America, new variants of PEDV infection leading to dramatic outbreaks and losses of suckling piglets reemerged in late 2013 in Taiwan. Phylogenetic analysis of the S gene showed that new variants of Taiwan PEDV strains belong to G1 and are closely related to other G1 strains from the USA, Canada, and China. These new Taiwan PEDV strains share 99.2 to 99.3 % nucleotide sequence identity to China CH/ZMDZY/11 and 94.1 to 94.2 % homologies to historical Taiwan PEDV strains. Similar to other new global variants of PEDV G1 strains, three serine amino acid substitutions (A522S, A554S, and G599S) in the COE and two serine amino acid substitutions (L769S and D771S) in SS6 are also observed in the reemerging Taiwan PEDVs as compared with the CV777-based vaccine strain (Chiou et al. 2015).",

After the first outbreak, PEDV quickly spread throughout the USA, then to nearby countries, including Canada (Song et al. 2015; Pasick et al. 2014). The US PEDV strains distributed both in G1 and G2 groups. The strains causing severe outbreaks exhibit high similarity to G1 PEDVs and are designed as S non-INDEL strains. The S non-INDEL PEDV strains were most closely related to China PEDV strains of CH/ZMZDY/11 and AH2012 in G1 group. Later after the outbreak, variants of US PEDV strains are isolated and are clustered in G2 in the phylogenetic analysis. As compared with the original US G1 PEDV strains, the US G2 PEDV strains contain insertions and deletions in S protein and are designed as S INDEL strains. Based on the full-length S gene analysis of PEDVs, the US S non-INDEL strains in G1 shared 99.8\u2013100 % homology to each other and shared 96.6\u201397.1 % homologies to other PEDV G2 strains from North America.
