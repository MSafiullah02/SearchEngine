In contrast to misfolding, aggregation is a highly cooperative inter-molecular process that strongly depends on the concentration of misfolded monomers. Aggregates may be composed of different oligomers over a wide distribution of sizes. The presence of these aggregates is common in a number of disease processes, including neurodegenerative disorders such as Alzheimer's, Parkinson's, and Huntington's diseases. The exposure of hydrophobic protein domains to unaffected proteins or membranes may disrupt normal activity. For example, association of the hydrophobic region of a damaged protein with a neuronal cell membrane may change ion flux and alter function. HSP70 may prevent this and this may be a key mechanism by which HSPs limit or prevent intra-cellular pathological processes. This underscores the fundamental importance of the HSPs to normal living cells [11] .",

These are organized by their molecular size: HSP100, HSP90, HSP60, HSP40 (J-domain proteins) and small HSP families, such as HSP22/27 [12, 13] . Most HSPs are constitutively and ubiquitously expressed molecular chaperones that guide the normal folding, intracellular disposition, and proteolytic turnover of many of the key regulators of cell growth and survival [14] . Thus, the protective process involves the interaction of many different HSPs. For example, HSP90, which comprises 1-2% of total cellular protein in non-stress conditions [15] , supports meta-stable protein conformations and expresses a high affinity binding state to hormone receptors. This involves both HSP70, which participates in assembly of multiprotein complexes, and HSP40, a co-chaperone that stimulates HSP70 ATPase activity [14] .",

Thus, altering HSP70 expression might be of importance in modulating highly lethal inflammatory diseases. ARDS is characterized by an increased inflammatory process in the lungs.

Using this model, we found impaired hepatic expression of several essential liverspecific genes, including those encoding proteins that catalyze gluconeogenesis, \u03b2-oxidation of fatty acids, ureagenesis, and bile acid transport [39] [40] [41] . Further, we have demonstrated inappropriate downregulation of the expression of several key genes within the lung. These include surfactant proteins (SP)-A and (SP)-B and, most importantly, HSP70 [27, 42, 43] . We found that HSP70 mRNA increased after a sham operation but failed to increase after CLP [27] . HSP70 protein levels were unchanged after either CLP or sham operation. Therefore, HSP70 mRNA fails to increase after CLP despite significant damage to alveolar cells. This lack of increase in HSP70 implies profound pulmonary epithelial dysfunction, similar to our findings in the liver, and is supported by several other studies indicating that sepsis and endotoxemia impair HSP70 expression [23, 27, 32, 44] . These experiments led us to investigate in depth the role of HSP70 in ARDS and inflammation, by using an adenovirus (AdHSP) to enhance HSP70 expression [38] .",

AdHSP, when compared to phosphate buffer saline (PBS) or a virus expressing a marker protein (AdGFP), attenuated CLP-induced neutrophil accumulation, septal thickening, interstitial fluid accumulation, and alveolar protein exudation [38]. More importantly, AdHSP treatment significantly decreased mortality in rats subjected to CLP [38] . In contrast to studies that provoked the entire heat shock response [31, 45, 46] , our investigations present a unique approach to explore the effects of HSP70 on a single tissue, the lung [32]. We previously documented that AdHSP preferentially increases HSP70 expression in pulmonary epithelial cells [38] . An interesting finding was that 48 hours following CLP, virus uptake occurred primarily in pulmonary epithelial cells, especially type II pneumocytes [32].",

This important acute inflammatory pathway is modulated by HSP70. NF-\u03baB is a dimeric protein, most often consisting of two subunits, p50 and p65 (Rel A). Normally, this dimer is retained in the cytoplasm by an inhibitory molecule, I\u03baB\u03b1 [62] . An essential step in NF-\u03baB activation is I\u03baB\u03b1 degradation. This permits the migration of NF-\u03baB into the nucleus where it can initiate transcription [61, 62] . Degradation of I\u03baB\u03b1 involves three sequential biochemical reactions. The first is phosphorylation of I\u03baB\u03b1 by I\u03baB kinase (IKK). IKK is a complex molecule that contains two catalytic subunits, IKK\u03b1 and IKK\u03b2, an essential regulatory subunit IKK\u03b3galso called NF-\u03baB essential modulator (or NEMO) [63] , and a recently identified co-modulator, the 105 kDa protein, ELKS [64] [65] [66] . The dominant catalytic subunit in inflammation is IKK\u03b2 [61] . Phosphorylation of I\u03baB\u03b1 is followed by poly-ubiquitination by SCF \u03b2-TrCP ubiquitin ligase and, finally, proteolysis by the 26S proteasome [67] [68] [69] [70] .",

            "text": "Several in vitro models have proven that heat shock or elevated levels of HSP70 suppresses NF-\u03baB activity and that this inhibition of NF-\u03baB results in a general reduction in the inflammatory response [44, 46, 71, 73] . However, the exact molecular mechanism of the HSP70-NF-\u03baB interaction is still unknown. Ran et al. [74] demonstrated that HSP70 promotes rather than inhibits TNF-mediated cell death, by binding to IKK\u03b3. This resulted in inhibition of IKK activity and consequently inhibited NF-\u03baB-dependent antiapoptotic gene induction [74] . Earlier, Yoo et al. demonstrated that HSP70 prevented phosphorylation of I\u03baB\u03b1 by IKK\u03b2 [71] .",

            "text": "Both activation and modulation of inflammation require coupling of extracellular signals with intra-cellular events, processes involving a number of specific biochemical pathways. We investigated the hypothesis that AdHSP limits sepsisinduced acute inflammation within alveolar epithelial cells in part by suppressing NF-\u03baB activation. In contrast to the observations of others [71, 74] , we found that HSP70 reduced, but did not abolish, IKK\u03b2 activity. More importantly, we have uncovered a novel mechanism of I\u03baB\u03b1 stabilization that results from an association with HSP70 [75] . HSP70 binds to an incomplete protein degradative complex composed of phosphorylated-ubiquitinated I\u03baB\u03b1sgF-\u03baB, and partial IKK complexes that contain ELKS, IKK\u03b2s and/or IKK\u03b3g(NEMO). The association of HSP70 leads to stabilization of these intermediate complexes in a way that prevents proteasomal degradation of I\u03baB\u03b1. Consequently, NF-\u03baB is retained in the cytoplasm and is unable to induce inflammatory responses.",
