            "text": "Over the last decade, there has been a rapid increase in the incidence of emerging infectious diseases (EIDs) among humans, posing a serious threat to public health (Jones et al., 2008). Many of these EIDs, particularly respiratory viruses, have been found to be zoonotic in their origin (Morens, Folkers, & Fauci, 2004) and are often only identified in humans after a spillover from the animal reservoir has occurred. Such examples include avian influenza viruses, swine influenza viruses, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS\u2010CoV), Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS\u2010CoV) and Ebola virus (Wang & Crameri, 2014). Given that zoonotic viruses have repeatedly caused serious disease outbreaks throughout the world, they are considered to be the most likely aetiological agents for the next pandemic (Morse et al., 2012). Hence, understanding the epidemiology of viral zoonotic diseases, especially in environments where humans and animals have close contact, is important for prevention efforts.",

More recently, there has been an outbreak of swine influenza variant (H3N2v) virus transmitted from pigs to humans at agricultural fairs in the Midwest, resulting in a total of 376 human cases as of 2 August 2017 (Centres for Disease, 2017). There has also been evidence to suggest an earlier peak in influenza virus transmission among populations residing in geographical areas with a higher density of swine farms (Lantos, Hoffman, Hohle, Anderson, & Gray, 2016). However, even with this knowledge of potential viral exchange, the human\u2013livestock interface is seldom studied, and often only when an outbreak has already occurred. One barrier to implementing routine surveillance at the human\u2013livestock interface is the concern that identifying a novel agent might have a negative economic impact on production.",

While we did attempt to run conventional RT\u2010PCR assays to isolate influenza A gene segments for sequencing on samples that were positive by the real\u2010time assay, the RT\u2010PCR assays were not successful likely because the CT Values of the real\u2010time positive samples were all >37, suggesting low concentrations of viral RNA.",
