They report an alarmingly high number of thrombotic complications (combination venous and arterial thromboembolism) in critically ill patients with COVID 19. They note an overall incidence of 31% composite outcome, much higher than the rate of thrombotic complications in prior series of critically ill patients prior to the COVID-19 pandemic [2].",

While still elevated, this is somewhat nearer to the upper end of rate of VTE in prior studies [2].",

Given that the authors are experienced in the diagnosis of VTE and encountered a disease that presents with marked hypoxia, I wonder if they had a lower threshold to obtain a contrast-enhanced scan, resulting in a higher than usual number of CTPA performed than would be typical in the critical care setting. It is quite possible that were as many CT angiograms performed on general critically ill patients that a similar proportion would be found to have pulmonary embolism, as was found by Minet et al. when all thoracic CTs obtained were performed with contrast enhancement \u2013 19% in their series [3].",
