Attempts to develop a vaccine have focused on the viral major envelope glycoprotein 350/220 (gp350), because it represents a principal target of neutralizing antibodies in naturally infected individuals (Hoffman et al., 1980, Thorley-Lawson and Geilinger, 1980, Thorley-Lawson and Poodry, 1982). Prototype gp350-based vaccines have induced protective immunity against EBV-mediated lymphomas in a cottontop tamarin challenge model of disease (Epstein et al., 1985) and more recently reduced infection in a rhesus macaque model in which both immunization and challenge were performed using rhesus macaque lymphocryptovirus, a homolog of EBV (Sashihara et al., 2011). Selected candidate prophylactic EBV vaccines have been evaluated in humans (Elliott et al., 2008, Gu et al., 1995, Moutschen et al., 2007, Sokal et al., 2007). The only phase II trial of an EBV prophylactic vaccine used recombinant soluble gp350 with an AS04 adjuvant. That vaccine demonstrated a 78% reduction in the rate of IM in EBV-seronegative vaccine, but it did not protect against acquisition of primary infection (Sokal et al., 2007), limiting enthusiasm for its further development.",

            "text": "EBV infects B cells by engaging viral gp350 to its primary receptor, complement receptor 2 (CR2/CD21) (Fingeroth et al., 1984), or alternatively CR1 (CD35) (Ogembo et al., 2013). The heterotrimeric viral glycoprotein complex, gH/gL/gp42, binds to HLA class II molecules as a co-receptor on B cells, while heterodimeric gH/gL and BMRF2 engage integrins as primary receptors to infect epithelial cells (Connolly et al., 2011, Hutt-Fletcher, 2007, Tugizov et al., 2003). Although inhibition of any of these viral glycoproteins by antibody or gene disruption prevents or severely impairs viral infection of cells, the degree of virus neutralization varies by antibody specificity and the target cell type. A murine monoclonal antibody (mAb) 72A1 potently neutralizes EBV infection of B cells (Hoffman et al., 1980), and its predicted epitope on gp350 largely overlaps the inferred binding site of CR2, suggesting a mechanism of neutralization mediated by this antibody (Tanner et al., 1988). The mAb 72A1 also blocks the interaction of gp350 with CR1 (Ogembo et al., 2013), further indicating that this epitope is functionally important and hence an attractive vaccine target to prevent viral infection of B cells, a principal target cell type of EBV. Here, we aimed to elicit potent neutralizing antibodies to this epitope by immunizing with a vaccine designed based on a rational understanding of structural biology and nanotechnology to optimize presentation and recognition of this site of vulnerability.",

            "text": "To display monomeric antigens on the surface of self-assembling nanoparticles, we identified two potential platforms, ferritin (Cho et al., 2009) and encapsulin (Sutter et al., 2008). Ferritins form an octahedral cage consisting of 24 subunits, while encapsulin forms an icosahedron made of 60 identical subunits (T = 1). Ferritins have been engineered for multiple purposes (Huard et al., 2013, J\u00e4\u00e4skel\u00e4inen et al., 2007, Li et al., 2006, Meldrum et al., 1992). Among these innovations, we have recently developed a platform to mount a viral trimeric glycoprotein at ferritin\u2019s 3-fold axes, providing a basis for structure-based nanoparticulate immunogens (Kanekiyo et al., 2013). Comparison of ferritin structures revealed that certain ferritins, including human light chain (Wang et al., 2006) (PDB: 2FFX) and bullfrog lower subunit (Trikha et al., 1995) (PDB: 1RCC), contained an NH2-terminal extension that was not present in ferritin from Helicobacter pylori (Cho et al., 2009) (PDB: 3EGM). This NH2-terminal extension makes the NH2-terminal residue project radially from the nanoparticle core, and the termini are evenly spaced on the surface. Due to relatively high sequence homology between bullfrog and human ferritins (62%), we were concerned that use of either as a vaccine platform could induce an autoimmune reaction.",

To avoid the potential for vaccine-induced autoimmunity, we therefore fused the amino terminal extension of bullfrog ferritin to H. pylori ferritin to build a hybrid that has the antigen-attachment sites distributed evenly on the surface (Figure 1A, left). Although encapsulin has not been studied as a scaffold to present heterologous proteins on its surface, we found that the COOH-terminal of encapsulin subunits project outward from the particle core and are located proximal to the 5-fold symmetry axis (Figure 1A, right). This allowed us to create COOH-terminal fusion proteins to present foreign antigen on the nanoparticle surface.",

We analyzed different gp350 truncation variants for their ability to form nanoparticles and found that the smallest gp350 variant (D12) failed to express on both ferritin and encapsulin platforms, suggesting instability of this variant. The largest variant (ectodomain) with ferritin was expressed; however, a mixture of assembled and misassembled/disassembled species was observed that excluded further use of this construct (Figure S1B). Two truncation variants, termed D2H6O and D123, expressed stably on the ferritin and encapsulin without disturbing self-assembly of the nanoparticles. Although gp350 is extensively posttranslationally modified by both N- and O-linked glycosylations (Machiels et al., 2011, Serafini-Cessi et al., 1989), the shorter D123 truncation eliminates most of the \u201cmucin-like\u201d domain, which may prevent recognition of gp350 by the immune system (Figure S1C), and hence D123 was selected for further studies. The purified soluble gp350 proteins and D123 nanoparticles were homogenous, as shown by size exclusion chromatography (Figure 2\nA).",

Both D123-ferritin and D123-encapsulin were immunoprecipitated equivalently by 72A1 and 2L10, but not by an irrelevant mAb C179 (Okuno et al., 1993) (Figure 2B). Analogous to soluble gp350 ectodomain, the D123 nanoparticles bound to 72A1 and 2L10; however, soluble D123 showed reduced reactivity to both mAbs by ELISA (Figure 2C), suggesting that the conformation of D123 was preserved on the nanoparticles while that of soluble D123 was altered. This indicated that the soluble form of D123 differed biochemically from either gp350 ectodomain or D123 nanoparticles, although the overall thermostability of these proteins was similar, as measured by differential scanning calorimetry (Figure S2\nA). To assess whether the D123 nanoparticles could bind to their cognate ligand, we tested their binding to CR2 on human B cells by flow cytometry. As expected, both soluble gp350 and D123 nanoparticles bound to CR2hi B cells, and the binding was dependent on CR2 expression, as the CR2lo B cells and T cells (CR2\u2212) showed weaker and no binding, respectively (Figure S2B). Preincubation of anti-CR2 antibody diminished the binding of gp350 to CR2, indicating that the interaction was mediated by CR2 (Figure S2B).",

The location of the gp350 protrusions on the ferritin nanoparticles correlated with the 2-fold symmetry and formed a dimer; however, the monomeric gp350 protrusions in the encapsulin nanoparticles are well separated (Figure 3A). Although gp350 D123 is predicted to be highly glycosylated, the dimer interface observed in ferritin cryo-EM contains hydrophobic patches that might be favored to form a dimer.

After the first dose, antibody binding to gp350 was detected in mice immunized with D123-ferritin and D123-encapsulin (ELISA endpoint titers of 104.6 \u00b1 0.1 and 104.4 \u00b1 0.4, respectively). These titers were >100-fold higher than those found in mice immunized with gp350 ectodomain (Figure 4\nA). Antibodies to gp350 were also measured in a luciferase immunoprecipitation system (LIPS) assay, which has been shown to correlate well with EBV neutralization activity, and in a virus neutralization assay using a GFP-reporter virus (Sashihara et al., 2009) (Figure 4A). The second dose of D123-ferritin or D123-encapsulin substantially increased gp350 antibody titers. The binding dissociation rate of anti-gp350 antibodies in sera was also improved by 3- to 5-fold after the second dose, as measured using biolayer interferometry (Figure S4\nA), indicating that anti-gp350 antibodies showed greater affinity maturation and bound more tightly to gp350 than antibodies elicited after the first dose, as observed with other vaccines (Bachmann et al., 1997, Khurana et al., 2011, Lee et al., 2012). After the second injection, gp350 ectodomain elicited anti-gp350 antibody titers only \u223c2-fold lower than those in mice immunized with D123-ferritin or D123-encapsulin; but the neutralization activity of the sera from mice immunized with gp350 ectodomain was \u223c1,000-fold lower than that of sera from D123-ferritin or D123-encapsulin immunization groups (Figure 4A). This discrepancy was also observed in the LIPS assay (Figure 4A). Immunization with soluble D123 elicited a negligible antibody response by ELISA, LIPS, and virus neutralization assays, indicating that the monomeric form of this protein is much less immunogenic. No virus-neutralizing antibody was induced by ferritin alone or ferritin mixed with either soluble gp350 ectodomain or D123 in contrast to immunization with D123-ferritin (Figure 4B). These data document that a physical linkage of antigen to nanoparticle is required for antigen-specific immune induction and show that ferritin does not stimulate a non-specific adjuvant response. Immunization with a 10-fold lower dose (0.5 \u03bcg) of D123-ferritin and D123-encapsulin induced virtually the same gp350 ELISA, LIPS, and neutralizing antibody titers in mice (Figure S4B).",

Two months after the second dose of vaccine (week 11), the neutralizing antibody titers in mice receiving D123-ferritin and D123-encapsulin declined about 10-fold from the peak titers but then remained stable until 3 months after the second dose without further immunization (Figure 4C). Neutralizing antibody titers in mice immunized with gp350 ectodomain were slightly increased over time but still remained at a low level (101.3 \u00b1 0.5) (Figure 4C). Mice were then immunized with a third dose at week 16. The titers were increased by 33- and 26-fold in D123-ferritin and D123-encapsulin, respectively (IC50 titers of 104.3 \u00b1 0.2 and 103.7 \u00b1 0.2, respectively) after boosting, and those titers did not wane as rapidly as after a second dose and remained high even after 3 months (IC50 titers of 103.7 \u00b1 0.3 and 103.6 \u00b1 0.2, respectively) (Figure 4C). The soluble gp350 ectodomain did not substantially enhance the neutralizing antibody titers after three immunizations (Figure 4C). We again observed similar titers and kinetics of neutralizing antibody in the lower-dose (0.5 \u03bcg) groups immunized with D123-ferritin or D123-encapsulin (Figure S4C). Importantly, no cross-reactive antibodies to autologous (i.e., murine) ferritin were observed even after three immunizations with D123-ferritin in mice, consistent with previous findings that tolerance to homologous ferritin is preserved (Kanekiyo et al., 2013) (Figure S4D).",

Because these monkeys are naturally infected with a lymphocryptovirus that shares homology with EBV, cross-neutralizing EBV antibody was found in all monkeys prior to immunization (IC50 titers from 101.1 to 102.0) (Figure 5\nA). Nevertheless, the neutralizing antibody titers increased after two doses (week 6) with either D123 nanoparticle, and these titers were further enhanced by 119- and 25-fold from the baseline after a third dose (week 14) of D123-ferritin and D123-encapsulin, respectively (Figure 5A). Neutralization titers in gp350 ectodomain-immunized animals were \u223c0.5 to 1.0 log lower, although the overall antibody binding titers were similar to that of D123-ferritin and D123-encapsulin-immunized animals (Figures 5A and 5B). The data confirm the immunogenicity of gp350-based nanoparticles in a second species and indicate that antibody production can be enhanced in the presence of pre-existing immunity.",

            "text": "To test the efficacy of vaccine-induced immunity in a mouse challenge model, we employed a recombinant virus challenge using a vaccinia virus that expressed EBV gp350 (rVV-gp350). We constructed and characterized rVV-gp350 and titrated the dose of virus in mice to establish a model in which weight loss was observed as a result of the infection (Figure S5\n), as has been reported with parental vaccinia virus (Chen et al., 2007). When mice were challenged 2 months after the third immunization, all mice immunized with gp350 ectodomain and control mice, with one exception, lost \u226530% of their weight within 8 days and required euthanization; however, four out of five of the D123-ferritin-immunized mice were protected, showing milder weight loss followed by rapid recovery (Figure 6\nA, p = 0.0027 for mice immunized with D123-ferritin versus gp350 ectodomain). We observed similar findings in mice that were challenged even 10 months after the third immunization (Figure 6B, p = 0.0210 for mice immunized with D123-ferritin versus gp350 ectodomain). Protection was not observed in mice immunized with D123-encapsulin in both experiments (Figures 6A and 6B). We note that the majority of the vaccinia virions would not be enveloped by the plasma membrane where the gp350 would be expressed but instead envelope would be derived from the endoplasmic reticulum. Hence, anti-gp350 antibody would likely not completely neutralize the incoming vaccinia virus particles and allow the incoming virus to infect cells for at least one round of replication. In contrast, it is more likely that vaccinia virus-infected cells that express gp350 on the surface are prone to be killed by antibody-dependent cell cytotoxicity, complement-dependent cytotoxicity, or cytotoxic T cells. We think that one or more of these mechanisms mediate viral clearance in the vaccinia challenge model. We observed slightly higher neutralizing activity and increased binding affinity of anti-gp350 antibody in D123-ferritin-immunized groups than in D123-encapsulin groups (Figures 4C, S4A, and S4B), but the difference was not statistically significant, suggesting that other mechanisms may contribute to protection.",

Strikingly, more than half of the total anti-gp350 antibodies in the sera elicited by either D123-ferritin or D123-encapsulin was competed by CR2BS-directed mAb 72A1 when it was used as a competitor (52% \u00b1 11% or 60% \u00b1 12%, respectively), whereas only 5% \u00b1 4% of antibodies in immune sera from gp350 ectodomain-immunized animals was blocked by this mAb (Figures 7A and 7B). This competition demonstrated that the CR2BS on both D123 nanoparticles was the predominant target of recognition; however, the same site on the gp350 ectodomain was not the major target. In addition, these differences were not due to total levels of gp350 antibody since the ELISA endpoint titers differ only \u223c2-fold between the three immunization groups after the second dose (Figure 4A). Interestingly, only a negligible fraction of anti-gp350 antibodies in the same immune sera was competed by non-neutralizing, non-CR2BS-directed mAb 2L10 (6% \u00b1 5%, 5% \u00b1 4%, and 12% \u00b1 16% with gp350 ectodomain, D123-ferritin, and D123-encapsulin, respectively), although 72A1 and 2L10 epitopes were equally available and accessible for immune recognition (Figures 2B, 2C, 7A, and 7B).",

One mutant had an extra N-linked glycosylation site at residue 162 (glyc162), and another mutant had two extra glycans at residues 162 and 208 (glyc162/208), as both 162 and 208 have been reported as critical residues for CR2 and 72A1 binding (Szakonyi et al., 2006, Young et al., 2008). Expectedly, the glycan mutation at 162 reduced binding to mAb 72A1, and the 162/208 glycans completely diminished 72A1 recognition, whereas binding of mAb 2L10 to gp350 wild-type (WT), glyc162, and glyc162/208 remained constant (Figure 7C). When sera from mice immunized with D123-ferrtin or D123-encapsulin were pre-incubated with gp350 WT to assess virus neutralization, most of neutralizing activity was depleted, as all gp350-specific antibodies in sera were absorbed by excess amount of gp350 WT. In contrast, the 162/208 glycan mutant absorbed only a small fraction of the neutralization activity, indicating that the majority of neutralization activity was targeting the site blocked by this mutant (Figure 7D). These results document the importance of CR2BS-directed antibodies in virus neutralization. Further, we found increased serum antibody binding to the CR2BS relative to full-length gp350 ectodomain after immunization with D123 nanoparticles compared to immunization with gp350 ectodomain (Figure 7E), although the overall antibody binding titers were similar in these immunization groups (Figures 4A and 5B), thus documenting preferential elicitation of CR2BS-directed antibodies in both immunized mice and monkeys.",

            "text": "Natural infection with EBV induces a neutralizing antibody response in the majority of individuals, although the titers are generally modest (IC50 \u2248101.5) (Sashihara et al., 2009). The quality of the immune response is often a key determinant of vaccine-induced immunity independent of its magnitude. It is noteworthy that the soluble gp350 ectodomain and D123 do not effectively induce neutralizing antibodies in mice, unlike the D123 nanoparticles, despite the fact that both soluble and nanoparticle forms of gp350 have similar antigenic profiles. This observation highlights the importance of antigen presentation, specifically the conformational authenticity of functional domains, in determining the quality of the immune response (McLellan, 2013). Immune focusing through nanoparticle presentation of selective domains of gp350 enabled elicitation of antibody predominantly to CR2BS, providing a mechanism of potent neutralization in sera. The mode of neutralization targeting the receptor-binding site (RBS) has been described in other viruses. The VRC01-class of antibodies that bind the CD4-binding site of the envelope of human immunodeficiency virus 1 (HIV-1) potently neutralize >90% of circulating viral strains regardless of their sequence variability (Wu et al., 2010, Zhou et al., 2010). MAbs CH65 (Whittle et al., 2011), C05 (Ekiert et al., 2012), and some others neutralize influenza A viruses through the conserved sialic acid-binding site on a viral hemagglutinin. Certain mAbs to hepatitis C virus (Krey et al., 2013), poliovirus (Chen et al., 2011, Chen et al., 2013), herpes simplex virus (Lee et al., 2013), and severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) coronavirus (van den Brink et al., 2005) also use a similar mechanism to neutralize viruses. Since the RBS must be functionally conserved to engage its host cell receptor, it is one of the most vulnerable targets of the virus. However, isolated RBS-containing domains (or RBDs) are often weakly immunogenic due to steric hindrance from surrounding glycans, hypervariability near the RBS that impairs targeting by the immune system, or altered conformation (Georgiev et al., 2013, Joyce et al., 2013, Julien et al., 2012).",

One of the principles of recombinant vaccine design is to improve immunogenicity of the native protein by modifying and/or altering its function/configuration, otherwise impossible to apply to certain other vaccine platforms (e.g., killed or attenuated virus). Truncation of the COOH-terminal \u223c480 residues of gp350 to make the D123 variant almost completely removed the \u201cmucin-like\u201d O-linked glycan-rich domain from the protein; however, this truncation led to protein mis-folding and/or destabilization in a soluble form. Improvement of immunogenicity was observed only when gp350 D123 was displayed on ferritin or encapsulin nanoparticles, suggesting that the D123 was conformationally stabilized on the nanoparticles without the remainder of the gp350 domain(s).",

One potential explanation for the difference in immunogenicity is the orientation of gp350 RBS relative to the surface of the particle and the packing density. These parameters would be quite different between ferritin and encapsulin and could affect the accessibility and angle of approach by immune receptors. On ferritin, the RBS is presented upright and spaced within 50\u2013100 \u00c5. This distance would allow crosslinking of B cell receptors (BCR) and would enhance signal transduction through downstream molecules to stimulate B cell activation (Bachmann and Zinkernagel, 1997). It also remains possible that the dimerization of D123 seen in ferritin effectively limits the solvent-exposed surface of non-RBS sites and focuses the immune response to the RBS more efficiently. Recent advances in nanoparticle technology further accentuate the benefits of symmetrically arrayed antigens to activate B cells through low-affinity BCRs (Jardine et al., 2013, Lingwood et al., 2012) and improve vaccine-induced immunity (Kanekiyo et al., 2013). These technologies allowed us to design immunogens that elicit immune response to targets otherwise difficult to be induced by native protein such as the CR2BS on gp350.",
