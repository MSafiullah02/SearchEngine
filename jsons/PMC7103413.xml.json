            "text": "Apolipoprotein B mRNA-editing enzyme-catalytic polypeptide-like 3G (APOBEC3G) is a member of the APOBEC3 family of cytidine deaminases (Cullen, 2006). Human APOBEC3G (hA3G) can be packaged into HIV-1 virions to mediate C-to-U editing on nascent proviral minus strands during reverse transcription, resulting in the inhibition of viral replication (Harris et al., 2003, Mangeat et al., 2003, Yu et al., 2004, Zhang et al., 2003). Accordingly, hA3G as an anti-viral factor confers innate immunity to HIV-1. However, HIV-1 encodes Vif, which counteracts hA3G by inducing hA3G degradation via the ubiquitin\u2013proteasome pathway, thereby blocking its incorporation into budding virions (Mehle et al., 2004, Yu et al., 2003). The ability of Vif to negate hA3G function is both dependent on physical association and partly species-specific\u2014in other words, Vif cannot counteract a form of A3G from a different species. This inefficient Vif\u2013hA3G interaction means that HIV-1 Vif is capable of counteracting human and chimpanzee A3G, but not mouse A3G (mA3G) or African green monkey A3G (Mariani et al., 2003). Other researchers have shown that hA3G or other APOBEC family members can confer innate immunity to a wide range of retroviruses as well as HBV (which is similar to retroviruses in that it also goes through a reverse transcription step during genomic replication) (Cullen, 2006).",

            "text": "The incorporation of A3G into HIV-1 virions is mediated by the Gag nucleocapsid (NC) domain (Alce and Popik, 2004, Cen et al., 2004, Khan et al., 2005, Luo et al., 2004, Schafer et al., 2004, Zennou et al., 2004). In addition to playing a key role in viral RNA packaging (Berkowitz et al., 1993\nBerkowitz et al., 1995, Poon et al., 1996, Zhang and Barklis, 1997), NC contains an I domain that is responsible for Gag\u2013Gag interactions (Bennett et al., 1993, Bowzard et al., 1998). Heterologous polypeptides capable of self-association have been shown to confer the ability to efficiently produce chimeric VLPs when substituted for HIV-1 NC (Accola et al., 2000, Burniston et al., 1999, Johnson et al., 2002, Zhang et al., 1998). However, replacing NC with a leucine-zipper motif that does not encapsidate RNA abolishes hA3G packaging without significantly affecting HIV-1 virion production (Zennou et al., 2004), suggesting RNA involvement in hA3G incorporation. This is consistent with the proposal that RNA is required for either hA3G viral incorporation or Gag\u2013hA3G interaction (Khan et al., 2005, Schafer et al., 2004, Svarovskaia et al., 2004, Zennou et al., 2004). We previously demonstrated that HIV-1 Gag mutants containing severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus nucleocapsid (SARS-CoV N) coding sequences as NC substitutes can effectively assemble VLPs (Wang et al., 2008). While completely unrelated, the SARS-CoV N protein is similar to HIV-1 NC in that it contains putative protein\u2013protein interaction domains (He et al., 2004, Narayanan et al., 2003, Surjit et al., 2004, Yu et al., 2005) and plays a role in viral RNA packaging (Hsieh et al., 2005, Huang et al., 2004a).",

Here we demonstrate that the carboxyl-terminal half of the SARS-CoV or human coronavirus 229E (HCoV-229E) N protein not only enables efficient VLP production, but also confers the ability to efficiently package human APOBEC3G (hA3G) when substituted for HIV-1 NC. Direct evidence comes in the form of hA3G being efficiently packaged into SARS-CoV VLPs. The interaction between coronavirus N and hA3G is also RNA-dependent. This implies that in addition to retroviruses, SARS-CoV and other RNA viruses may be capable of packaging hA3G via nucleocapsid domains.",

This raises the question of whether the inserted SARS-CoV N sequence confers the chimeric ability to package hA3G. We therefore co-expressed assembly-competent NC(N2) and NC(N4) with hA3G in 293T cells and used Western immunoblotting to detect VLP-associated hA3G. Our controls were the HIV-1 NC-deleted mutants \u0394NC, \u0394PC, and delNC, all with different numbers of deleted NC codons (Fig. 1). Our results show that NC(N2) and NC(N4) were capable of packaging hA3G at the same efficiency level as the wild-type (Fig. 2\nA, lanes 6 and 7 vs. lane 2). Low but detectable VLP-associated hA3G was observed in the NC-deletion mutants (lanes 4 and 5). Since HIV-1 Vif inhibits hA3G virion incorporation by triggering hA3G degradation (Conticello et al., 2003, Kao et al., 2003, Liu et al., 2004, Mariani et al., 2003, Marin et al., 2003, Mehle et al., 2004, Sheehy et al., 2003, Stopak et al., 2003, Yu et al., 2003), the hA3G expression level or the presence of Vif may affect the level of virus-associated hA3G. To test whether Vif or hA3G expression level affects hA3G packaging into chimeric VLPs, we introduced mutation-blocking Vif expression into wt and NC(N2) and co-transfected each Vif-deficient (\u0394Vif) result with different amounts of the hA3G-coding plasmid. In the absence of Vif, we observed a relatively higher steady-state hA3G expression level accompanied by an increased level of VLP-associated hA3G (Fig. 2B, right top panel). Members of the \u0394Vif group occasionally expressed higher VLP levels than their Vif-intact counterparts (Fig. 2B, lanes 6\u20139 vs. 2\u20135). However, we also repeatedly observed \u0394Vif group members producing higher levels of VLP-associated hA3G. In the presence or absence of Vif, NC(N2) displayed a level of VLP-associated hA3G comparable to that displayed by wt. These results suggest that the SARS-CoV N carboxyl-terminal region can be substituted for HIV-1 NC without affecting VLP assembly or hA3G packaging functions.",

As illustrated in Fig. 1, full-length SARS-CoV N sequences were inserted into the \u0394NC (\u0394NC[CoN]) and delNC (NC[CoN]) constructs. NC(N1), NC(N3), NC(N5), NC(N6), and NC(N7) respectively contain N codons 2\u2013213, 215\u2013359, 302\u2013421, 2\u2013168, and 2\u201386 in the deleted NC region. We again found that both NC(N2) and NC(N4) were capable of efficiently packaging hA3G at VLP-associated hA3G levels comparable to or higher than those of wt (Fig. 2C, lanes 5 and 7). Even though \u0394NC(CoN) and NC(CoN) were found to be defective in VLP production, they incorporated hA3G at an efficiency level comparable to that of wt (lanes 2 and 3). Further, despite producing substantial amounts of VLPs, the NC(N1) was incapable of packaging hA3G as efficiently as wt (i.e., it produced a VLP-associated hA3G level approximately 60% that of wt) (lane 4). The barely detectable level of VLP-associated hA3G found in NC(N6) may be due to lower levels of VLPs in the blot and/or lower levels of hA3G expression (Fig. 2C). However, in a separate blot containing higher VLP and hA3G expression levels, VLP-associated hA3G in NC(N6) was approximately 50% that measured in wt (data not shown).",

We tested whether the association between SARS-CoV N and hA3G has the same requirement by fusing the SARS-CoV N amino-terminal (N1, N6, and N7) or carboxyl-terminal sequence (N2, and N5) to the carboxyl terminus of GST and co-expressing each GST fusion construct with hA3G. Cell lysates containing hA3G and GST fusions were treated with RNase prior to performing a GST pull-down assay. Results indicate that GST-CoN, GST-N1, GST-N2, and GST-N6 were capable of pulling down hA3G, whereas the amount of hA3G associated with GST fusion was markedly reduced following RNase treatment (Fig. 3\n). Neither GST-N5 nor GST-N7 was capable of pulling down hA3G, regardless of whether or not they were treated with RNase (Fig. 3, lanes 7, 9, 16 and 18). These results suggest that (a) the hA3G-binding domain of SARS-CoV N is largely contained within the sequence between residues 86 and 302, and (b) efficient N\u2013hA3G interactions occur in a RNA-dependent manner.",

Similar to APOBEC1, APOBEC3G contains two zinc-coordinating motifs, with the carboxyl-terminal zinc-coordinating motif possessing catalytic cytidine deaminase activity. To identify hA3G regions responsible for hA3G incorporation into SARS-CoV VLPs, we co-transfected 293T cells with M and N expression vectors and a plasmid encoding wt or a hA3G mutant containing various carboxyl- or amino-terminus deletions (Fig. 5\nA). The results indicate that hA3G mutants lacking residues 1\u2013104, 157\u2013384, or 246\u2013384 were capable of being incorporated into VLPs, and that hA3G mutants lacking residues 1\u2013156 or 309\u2013384 were undetectable in the medium samples (Fig. 5B, lanes 4 and 7). In the cases of \u0394246\u2013384 and \u0394309\u2013384, poor particle incorporation may be due in part to low expression levels. In particular, \u0394309\u2013384 was barely detectable in repeat experiments. Low steady-state expression levels of the carboxyl-terminal truncated hA3G mutant have been reported previously (Cen et al., 2004). In comparison, the \u0394157\u2013384 mutant expressed greater steady-state stability and a higher level of VLP-associated hA3G (lanes 5 and 12). To test whether the mutations had similar effects on hA3G packaging into chimeric VLPs, wt or each hA3G mutant was individually co-expressed with NC(NC2) (which contains the carboxyl-terminal half of the N coding sequence and is known to efficiently produce VLPs and package hA3G) (Fig. 1, Fig. 2). Our results indicate that the hA3G mutations exerted similar effects on hA3G packaging into NC(N2) VLPs with no detectable VLP-associated \u03941\u2013156 or \u0394309\u2013384 (Fig. 5C).",

In agreement with previous reports (Cen et al., 2004, Luo et al., 2004), the \u03941\u2013156 mutation (with a deletion involving the first linker region) blocked hA3G incorporation (Fig. 5D, lane 4).

To perform this test, we constructed NC(229EN2) (an NC[N2] counterpart) by inserting the HCoV-229E carboxyl-terminal half nucleocapsid coding sequence into the deleted HIV-1 NC region. The resulting construct was transiently co-expressed with hA3G in 293T cells. The results indicate that NC(229EN2) can also package hA3G to a degree comparable to that of wt when released VLPs are at a similar level (data not shown). To mitigate the impact of overexpressed hA3G on this conclusion, we repeated the experiment by co-expressing hA3G with wt or the chimeric construct in 293 cells. As the results in Fig. 6B indicate, the carboxyl-terminal half of HCoV-229E N (which also contains a putative self-association domain) (Tswen-Kei Tang, 2005) was capable of replacing the HIV-1 NC function with respect to VLP assembly and hA3G packaging\u2014that is, substantial amounts of VLPs and hA3G were detected in NC(229EN2) transfectant supernatant (lane 4). To determine whether the interaction between hA3G and HCoV-229E N also requires RNA, we performed a GST pull-down assay in the presence or absence of RNase. As expected, the GST fusions containing the full-length (GST-229EN), amino-terminal half (GST-229EN1), or carboxyl-terminal half (GST-229EN2) of the HCoV-229E N sequence were capable of efficient hA3G pull-down, which is also dependent on the presence of RNA (Fig. 7\n). These data suggest that HCoV-229E N and SARS-CoV N may share a propensity for hA3G-association.",

Moreover, assembly-competent chimeras with various SARS-CoV N protein sequences inserted into the deleted HIV-1 NC did not have equal hA3G packaging capabilities: NC(N2) and NC(N4) exhibited a higher level of VLP-associated hA3G than NC(N1). Results from a GST pull-down assay suggest that the SARS-CoV N domain associated with hA3G is largely contained within the central N region between residues 86 and 302 (Fig. 3). Although GST-N1 and GST-N6 can pull down hA3G, we found that NC(N1) and NC(N6) are incapable of packaging hA3G as efficiently as wt or NC(N2).

Given the number of studies demonstrating that viral genomic RNA is dispensable for efficient A3G packaging (Alce and Popik, 2004, Cen et al., 2004, Khan et al., 2005, Luo et al., 2004, Navarro et al., 2005, Schafer et al., 2004, Svarovskaia et al., 2004, Zennou et al., 2004), any genomic RNA packaging defect that does exist should not exert a significant impact on the hA3G package. The finding that efficient SARS-CoV N association with hA3G is RNA-dependent (Fig. 3) agrees with the proposal that RNA (viral or nonspecific) is required for mediating hA3G\u2013Gag association and hA3G incorporation into virions (Svarovskaia et al., 2004, Zennou et al., 2004). We assumed that the chimeras considered competent in hA3G packaging are capable of packaging considerable amounts of RNA, since the SARS-CoV N (Hsieh et al., 2005, Luo et al., 2006) and HIV-1 MA domains (Burniston et al., 1999, Ott et al., 2005) both possess nucleic acid binding properties that may confer RNA packaging ability. Using a RNA quantification assay as described by Chang et al. (2008), we found that NC(N2) VLPs contain RNA at approximately 80% of the level measured in HIV-1 Gag VLPs (data not shown).",

Accordingly, 7SL RNA apparently plays a key role in determining hA3G packaging into HIV-1 virions. Additional experiments are required to determine whether SARS-CoV or NC(N2) are as capable as HIV-1 in terms of packaging 7SL RNA. To date, one in vitro study has demonstrated that A3G binds to RNA prior to HIV-1 NC association (Bogerd and Cullen, 2008). Accordingly, it may be that the interactions required for A3G/RNA/NC ternary complex formation involve specific contacts between NC and both A3G and A3G-bound RNA. SARS-CoV N association with hA3G may in large part depend on N binding to hA3G-bound RNA, since the SARS-CoV N contains clusters of basic residues in the amino- and carboxyl-terminal regions that may confer RNA-binding ability (Hsieh et al., 2005). Extensive genetic analyses indicate that SARS-CoV N RNA-binding domains are largely located between amino acid residues 45\u2013181 (Huang et al., 2004a), 248\u2013280 (Chen et al., 2007a, Luo et al., 2006), and 363\u2013382 (Luo et al., 2006), all of which contain large quantities of basic residues. It is conceivable that basic residue clusters within SARS-CoV N make a significant contribution to hA3G\u2013N association by enhancing N binding to hA3G-associated RNA. Compatible with this hypothesis, we found that the GST fusions GST-CoN, GST-N1, GST-N2 and GST-N6, all of which contain most of the residues involved in RNA-binding, are competent in their associations with hA3G (Fig. 3). The exception to this rule is GST-N5, which is unable to pull down hA3G despite bearing a putative RNA-binding domain (residues 363\u2013382). Our finding that the essential region for hA3G packaging into HIV-1 or SARS-CoV VLPs resides between codons 104 and 156 is compatible with a genetic analysis demonstrating that residues 124 to 127 are responsible for hA3G viral incorporation (Huthoff and Malim, 2007).",

Combined, the ability of NC(229EN2) to package hA3G and the RNA-dependent association of HCoV-229E N with hA3G (Fig. 7) imply that in addition to SARS-CoV N, coronaviral N products may associate with hA3G via binding with RNA. However, human T-cell leukemia virus type 1 (HTLV-1) has been found to prevent hA3G packaging through Gag NC domain action (Derse et al., 2007), suggesting that some RNA viruses are incapable of packaging A3G. Our results indicate that the presence of the hA3G first linker region is required for hA3G to be packaged into either HIV-1 Gag or SARS-CoV VLPs. It is possible that an RNA/hA3G complex, either alone or in combination with other cellular factors, is an acceptable structure for an association between HIV-1 NC and SARS-CoV N.",

It remains to be determined whether chimeric NC(N2) or SARS-CoV can package endogenous A3G as efficiently as HIV-1. The biological significance of a SARS-CoV N association with hA3G also requires further exploration. According to one report, hA3G is capable of editing virus-associated HIV-1 RNA (Bishop et al., 2004); the hA3G-mediated inhibition of viral replication may be independent of its cytidine deaminase activity (R\u00f6sler et al., 2005, Turelli et al., 2004). Since humans are not natural hosts for SARS-CoV (Li et al., 2005), human susceptibility implies that cells infected by SARS-CoV may not express A3G, or SARS-CoV may have evolved to counteract A3G anti-viral activity. Further studies are required to address this issue.",
