Covid-19 patients with cardiovascular disease are at increased risk of death. They are very often treated with drugs targeting the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system, where angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) is of particularly importance. Angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEI) and angiotensin II receptor blockers (ARBs) are standard therapies for high blood pressure and heart failure (HF) and currently prescribed to more than 25 Mio people in Germany alone (approx. 30% of the general population).",

ACE2 has been identified as the receptor for SARS corona virus [2] and is also considered the main receptor for SARS-CoV-2 [3]. ACE2 expression is particularly high in lung epithelial cells, but also present in cardiac myocytes and endothelial cells [1,4,5]. Levels of ACE2 in human plasma are very low/undetectable in healthy humans, but upregulated in patients with heart failure [1,6].",

Similar actions have been shown for ARBs [7], but their action differs from that of ACEI in as much as they specifically block the AT1 receptor and indirectly increase angiotensin II levels. The increase in angiotensin II could have additional effects by stimulating a second receptor, AT2, insensitive to ARB. The AT2 receptor has been suggested to participate in beneficial effects of ARB and this may also involve ACE2 [8]. However, the role of the AT2/ACE2/angiotensin 1\u20137 axis is not fully resolved, particularly not if the net effect on ACE2 differs from that of ACEI in humans, where evidence for superior therapeutic efficacy of ARB vs. ACEI is lacking.",

Whether patients who are treated with an ACEI or ARB should be advised to switch to other therapeutic options is unclear and further evidence is required. The question is complex because the prevailing evidence suggests a beneficial role of high ACE2 and angiotensin 1\u20137 levels on cardiovascular and pulmonary diseases, arguing for this pathway to participate in the overall benefit of therapy with ACEI. It is also possible that the cardiovascular and pulmonary benefit of ACEI or ARBs in humans already infected with Covid-19 outweighs the possible negative impact of increased spreading.",
