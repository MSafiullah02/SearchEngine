We are concerned with endemic equilibrium and disease-free fixed points and numerical solutions of these models with different type of numerical techniques. We also consider additive fractional white noise representation of the SIRS model and obtain numerical and exact solutions of these models. In the modeling of epidemic diseases via compartmental type mathematical models, there exists not any study considering fractional white noise, Wick product and fractional-order operators all together. Our driving motivation in this paper is to investigate the applicability of these significant and powerful techniques to the modeling of epidemic diseases. Our contributions in this paper may be listed as: i) Generating a new SIRS model. ii.) Considering this system in terms of stochastic equations and fractional white noise. iii) Studying chaos at disease-free and endemic steady state points. iv) Solving perturbed systems (perturbed from deterministic to fractional-stochastic) both numerically and explicitly (exactly). We provided Figures illustrating the behavior of compartments in different environments. From this listed contributions, we can say that the present paper is totally a new contribution to mathematical biologists studying compartment models by fractional and stochastic differential equations. We believe that researchers in this area will employ the present paper and extend it to different models.",

Each of these models explains the advantages of employed differential equation in their system. Fractional-order models indicates that these types of models takes into account past effects of the system, stochastic models [27], [28], [29], [52] emphasis on probabilistic transmissions of the diseases among the individuals in the population and so on. To the best of our knowledge, there exists not any mathematical model for a epidemic disease which considers both fractional-order operators and white noise together. Now, we perturb the fractional-order system (3) into a new system (mostly known as fractional-stochastic system) by an additive white noise to the-rightmost side of each equation in the system. Our major aim in the section is to illustrate the use of both fractional-order operators and white noise together and test the effectiveness of resulting new model. It is possible to generate some other fractional-order stochastic SIRS models simply by a new type of fractional order operator or the changing the way of adding the noise to the system. We consider the perturbed fractional-order stochastic SIRS model:(6)Dt\u03b1S(t)=N\u2212aS(t)I(t)+kR(t)S(t)\u2212\u03beS(t)\u2212c1S(t)I(t)dW1(t),Dt\u03b1I(t)=aS(t)I(t)\u2212cI(t)\u2212c2S(t)I(t)dW2(t),Dt\u03b1R(t)=dI(t)R(t)\u2212eR(t)\u2212c3R(t)I(t)dW3(t),where dWi is a Wiener process for each i=1,2,3. Disease-free point, obtained when I(t) \u2261 0, is the same point with the deterministic system (3). Stability of the system (6) may be investigated by Lyapunov stability method [25] which is applied to the system (6):(7)S(t)Dt\u03b1S(t)+I(t)Dt\u03b1I(t)+R(t)Dt\u03b1R(t)=S2(t)+S(t)I(t)+S(t)R(t)\u2212aS2(t)I(t)+kR(t)S2(t)\u2212\u03beS2(t)+c1S2(t)I(t)dW1(t)+aS(t)I2(t)\u2212cI2(t)+c2S(t)I2(t)dW2(t)+dI(t)R2(t)\u2212eR2(t)+c3I(t)R2(t)dW3(t)=S2(t)(1\u2212aI(t)\u2212\u03be\u2212c1I(t)dW1(t)+I(t)+R(t))+I2(t)(aS(t)\u2212c\u2212c2S(t)dW2(t))+R2(t)(dI(t)\u2212e\u2212c3I(t)dW3(t))\u22640.\n",

It is a paired (binary) type operation, typically denoted with a symbol \u22c4, and it is employed in famous Wiener-Ito-Chaos decomposition of function in L2\u2212measurable space. Wick product is a significant phenomena in stochastic and fractional stochastic calculus, mostly applied in the solutions of nonlinear differential equations in financial mathematics and fluid mechanics. A detailed treatment to Wick product and its applications can be seen in ([34], [35], [36], [37], [38], [39], [49]). In this paper, we employ the Wick product in the fractional Brownian motion settings to represent fractional white noise.
