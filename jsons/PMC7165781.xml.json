Non\u2010hospitalized cases (diagnosed in private clinics or at a doctor's office) notified to the region's public health department were reported to the research team.

Jones et al. (2008) identified only 55 human cases of Choleraesuis serotype during the 1996\u20132006 time frame in the United States (about five cases/year). One study suggested that groundwater consumption could be an independent risk factor of Salmonella choleraesuis infection in Taiwan (Li et al., 2009). The origin of these infections may be the environmental impact of swine herds (three of six cases infected with this serotype lived in areas with a swine density \u22650.78 AU); however, it could result from food or direct contact with animals. In our study, there was an association of children having a bacterial gastroenteritis resulting from contact with animals; however, most of the contacts (97%) were related to domestic animals, and when contact with animals was not considered in the model, the association was not significantly modified.

It has been shown that human and animal strains of rotavirus may share a high degree of genetic similarities.

In Qu\u00e9bec, an ecological study found an increasing risk of children's hospitalization associated with higher animal farming activities, especially poultry (Febriani et al., 2009). Studying the notified cases of gastroenteritis in Qu\u00e9bec's children 0\u20134 years of age living in small municipalities, Kabor\u00e9 et al. (2010) found an association with cattle density, but no association with poultry or swine density.

The evaluation of bacteria, viruses and parasites at the same time for most of the cases should be underlined, as well as the important characterization of the quality of the water serving the participants' residences.

We nevertheless acknowledge that community cases were only a selection of incident cases (that consulted a physician and had faecal sample). Our measure of animal farming intensity was quite crude, which may reduce our ability to detect an association with animal farming activity. Finally, this study was conducted only in rural areas, which have precluded a formal evaluation between rural and urban settings.
