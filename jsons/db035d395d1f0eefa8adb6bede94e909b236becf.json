BPD, as defined by the need for supplemental oxygen at 36 weeks' postmenstrual age [1] [2] [3] , is the most frequent pulmonary morbidity among survivors of prematurity-a chronic lung condition that affects more than 10,000 premature infants in the United States alone each year [4, 5] . Before the surfactant era, BPD was primarily a structural injury of the preterm lung characterized by decreased alveolarization and surface area, alternating atelectasis with hyperinflation, pulmonary lesions, and fibrosis [6] . Today, BPD represents a developmental arrest of the preterm lung with interruption of the pulmonary septation, alveolarization, and vascularization during the saccular and alveolar stages of lung development [7] .The result is a lung with fewer, larger alveoli and a corresponding decrease in surface area available for gas exchange.",

Any or all of these factors, possibly in concert with genetic predisposition or epigenetic factors, could contribute to its occurrence, even though recent genome-wide association studies (GWAS) failed to identify any specific loci associated with moderate to severe BPD [8, 9] .

The so-called histological chorioamnionitis can be acute or chronic based on neutrophilic or lymphocytic infiltration of the fetal membranes, respectively. Both neutrophils and lymphocytes may be of either maternal or fetal origins [12] . Unlike acute cases, chronic chorioamnionitis has both cellular (innate) and humoral (adaptive) immune responses, which could indicate maternal antibody-mediated antifetal rejection that has been associated with preterm birth [13] . The suggestion by Goldenberg et al. [14] that intrauterine infection and/or inflammation accounts for up to 90 % of preterm births before 28 weeks' gestation lends credence to the theory that predisposition of preterm infants to BPD may occur in utero.",

However, the major virulence factor that has been identified experimentally is the Ureaplasma multiple banded antigen (MBA), a surface-exposed lipoprotein [22] . Ureaplasma spp. have been shown to evade the host immune response by varying the size of MBA and mba gene [22, 24] .

Intra-amniotic inflammation also can cause dysregulation of critical growth factors necessary for lung development. Fibroblast growth factor (FGF)-10 expression is inhibited by nuclear factor kappa-light-chain-enhancer of activated B cells (NF-\u03baB), the major proinflammatory signaling pathway stimulated by IL-1 and TNF-\u03b1 [36, 37] . FGF-10 plays a key role in lung branching morphogenesis, remodeling, repair, and regeneration [12, 38] .

Since TLRs are major activators of the immune system, cross-tolerance of toll-like agonists may enhance immune suppression in the preterm infant and increase the vulnerability to a \"second hit\"-sepsis, ventilator-mediated injury, or hyperoxia [12, 55] . On the other hand, Kramer and Jobe [56] hypothesized that this immunosuppressive fetal response may be an advantageous adaptation to chronic exposure to chorioamnionitis that prevents more serious inflammation-mediated lung injury. Indeed, Kallapur et al. [58] lent weight to this theory when they showed that chronic exposure to intra-amniotic endotoxin did not lead to progressive lung injury and extensive structural abnormalities in fetal sheep, but only to mild, persistent inflammation. However, chorioamnionitis leading to prolonged immune dysfunction may subsequently increase susceptibility to postnatal infections.",

Of these 1104 infected infants, 909 (82 %) had Gram-positive and 195 (18 %) had Gram-negative infections. As compared with no infection, the odds ratio (OR) of mortality/BPD was higher in infants who had Gram-negative (OR, 2.79; 95 % confidence interval [CI], 1.96-3.97) and Gram-positive (OR, 1.44; 95 % CI, 1.21-1.71) sepsis. Infants with Gramnegative sepsis were significantly more likely to have been born to mothers with chorioamnionitis than uninfected infants (p = 0.004) or those with Gram-positive infections (p = 0.04). This study supports the contention that the proinflammatory cascade that occurs with LOS can exacerbate preexisting inflammatory conditions associated with chorioamnionitis exposure or initiate an inflammatory and fibrotic response that results in BPD [45, 59, 61, 62] . Prevention of postnatal sepsis must remain a high priority for prevention of BPD.",

Transmission of CMV by blood transfusion to preterm infants has been virtually eliminated by the use of CMV antibodynegative donors, freezing red blood cells in glycerol before administration, or leukoreduction. Ingestion of human milk now is the primary means by which preterm infants acquire CMV postnatally [74] . While pasteurization of human milk inactivates CMV, it also may reduce its known cognitive, immunological, and nutritional benefits. Freezing milk at \u221220 \u00b0C decreases CMV viral titers, but does prevent transmission [75, 76] .",

Fifty preterm infants <33 weeks' gestation who were in the NICU since birth underwent nasopharyngeal swab testing for In a single-site prospective study performed in a German NICU from 8/2010-3/2014, Kidszun et al. [78] performed respiratory viral multiplex PCR testing on 88 infants (median gestational age, 27 weeks; median birth weight, 852 g) who underwent 137 evaluations for late-onset sepsis. A respiratory virus was detected in the nasopharynx of six (7 %) infants (2, RSV; 4, picornavirus). Similarly, Ronchi et al. [79] conducted a 1-year study (1/15/12-1/31/13) for the detection of respiratory viruses by multiplex PCR testing in infants evaluated for possible sepsis and in whom intravenous antibiotic therapy was initiated. During the 13-month study, 100 infants (mean gestational age, 31 weeks; mean birth weight, 1698 g) had 135 sepsis evaluations, and 8 infants (8 %), or 6 % (n = 8) of sepsis evaluations, had a respiratory virus detected from nasopharyngeal swabs. These included hRV(n = 4), coronaviruses (1, HKU-1; 1, OC43), and PIV-3 (n = 2). These studies suggest that respiratory viral infections are under-recognized in premature infants in the NICU; yet, they are associated with acute morbidity. Their contribution to long-term respiratory and neurodevelopmental outcomes, however, remains unknown.",

Longitudinal studies of mice who received supplemental oxygen have found a lifelong increased susceptibility to infection with respiratory viruses, and in particular, influenza A virus, compared to preterm controls exposed only to room air [80] [81] [82] . Higher oxygen concentrations led to a dose-dependent inflammatory response to influenza A exposure [45, 52, 83] , with enhanced recruitment of macrophages, neutrophils, and lymphocytes, as well as increased alveolar fibrosis, increased monocyte chemoattractant protein (MCP-1), and greater mortality [80] . O'Reilly et al. [80] demonstrated that alveolar type II cells that are responsible for surfactant production can express viral receptors on their surface, with surfactant protein-deficient mice having decreased viral clearance. Pulmonary outcomes of preterm infants infected with a respiratory virus early in life-and especially with RSV, hRV, PIV, and hMPV-bear striking resemblance to outcomes of very premature infants with BPD [84, 85] . Both BPD and early respiratory infection with RSV have been associated with recurrent wheeze and lung function abnormalities that persist to school age [64, 86] . In addition, viral lower respiratory tract infections (LRTIs) may be a marker for preexisting abnormal lung function in neonates [64, 87] . Infants with BPD have substantially more rehospitalizations due to RSV and hRV infection than age-matched controls without BPD [88, 89] .",

Its impact on human health has received less attention than that of the bacterial microbiome, even though it is likely to be equally important in homeostasis and disease. The potential importance of the human virome in the development of BPD is not known, and our current lack of understanding of its ontogeny in preterm infants constitutes a major knowledge gap in our continuing efforts to decrease the incidence of BPD and its consequences.",

Analysis of the infant's transcriptome also could be used to support the clinical significance of detecting bacterial or viral sequences in clinical specimens by detecting expression of immune/inflammatory genes that may contribute to the development of BPD [105] . Importantly, such technology could aid in the identification and subsequent validation of candidate biosignatures and biomarkers for BPD in preterm infants with bacterial and respiratory viral infections.",

Fifty two percent (26/50) of infants tested positive for a respiratory virus at least once during the NICU stay. Of 708 specimens obtained, the following viruses were detected: PIV-3, 13; hMPV, 9; RSV-B, 8; RSV-A, 7; PIV-2, 7; hRV, 7; and influenza B, 4. Of note, 18 samples (28 % of the positive swabs) included more than one virus, similar to studies performed in older infants with bronchiolitis where viral codetection is relatively common. Fourteen infants had sequentially positive specimens for the same virus over 3 to 13 days, suggesting that these were true positive results. Compared to infants who did not have a respiratory viral pathogen detected, virus-positive infants had significantly longer length of stay (70 d vs. 35 d, p = 0.002), need for intubation (65 % vs. 29 %, p = 0.01), duration of intubation (19 vs. 5 d, p = 0.03), duration of oxygen requirement (51 vs. 13 d,",
