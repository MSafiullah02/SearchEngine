A virally encoded accessory protein, Vpr, is a major player in the induction of G2 arrest and apoptosis in CD4+ T cells.5., 6., 7., 8. However, in the central nervous system (CNS), HIV-1 triggers the apoptosis of neurons via a different mechanism. Neurons undergo apoptosis as a result of exposure to extracellular viral proteins such as Tat and gp120, and this neurodegeneration can lead to HIV-1 associated dementia (HAD).9., 10., 11. These neurotoxic viral proteins12., 13., 14., 15. are believed to be secreted from HIV-1 infected microglia, the macrophage of the CNS.",

These two terminally differentiated cell types are infected by macrophage (M)-tropic/R5 viruses at the early stages of viral infection.18., 19., 20., 21. Since macrophage and microglia are non-dividing cells, the cell cycle arrest effect of virus-encoded Vpr, which is mechanistically linked to cell death, has been thought to be insignificant in these HIV-1 target cells. This is because Vpr cannot activate the pro-apoptotic pathway that it activates in T cells, since ATR, Rad17 and Chk1 are not expressed in macrophage.22 Interestingly, a recent study reported that HIV-1 infected microglia may have a survival advantage, as compared with uninfected microglia in the same patients.23 Since the phenotypic outcomes of HIV-1 infection in CD4+ T cells (apoptosis) and microglia (pro-survival) are opposite, it is of considerable interest to better understand how HIV-1 interacts with microglia. This may lead to insight into how HIV-1 infected microglia are able to contribute to the persistent production of HIV-1 within the central nervous system.17., 24., 25., 26.\n",

            "text": "Many cellular proteins and signaling pathways have been implicated in the regulation of cell fate. One of the most important, and best studied, is Akt.27 Upon cellular stimulation, PI-3-K recruits protein kinase B/Akt to the membrane through generation of PIP3 from PIP2, where it is catalyzed via specific phosphorylation. Once activated, Akt leaves the membrane to modulate the activity of its numerous targets, including GSK3\u03b2, p21, Mdm2 and Bad.28., 29., 30., 31. The overall outcome of these events is the induction of cellular proliferation and survival. In order to prevent excess cellular proliferation and survival, especially following damage and stress, this pathway must be regulated. One of the well-studied negative regulators, phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN), converts PIP3 to PIP2, inhibiting recruitment of Akt to the membrane and therefore preventing further activation of the PI-3-K pathway.32 PTEN also can modulate proliferation and survival through reciprocal positive regulation of p53. PTEN binds to the C-terminal end of p53, thereby stabilizing p53 while p53 transcriptionally induces PTEN.33 Both PTEN and p53 are often found mutated or deleted in cancers, alleviating the restraint on cellular survival pathways and allowing for long term survival and the subsequent establishment of a transformed phenotype.32\n",

However, as expected, the CHME5 cells could not support the replication of a T-tropic HIV-1 strain, NL4-3, which is known to replicate in CD4+ T cells but not in macrophages and microglia. Indeed, the data shown in Figure 1 validate CHME5 cells as an M-tropic HIV-1 target cell.",

In order to visualize the infected CHME5 cells, we initially employed an HIV-1 pseudotyped vector expressing green fluorescent protein (GFP) as well as all HIV-1 proteins except Env and Nef.38 For a control, we used an HIV-1 transfer plasmid, pHR'-GFP, expressing eGFP under the control of the cytomegalovirus (CMV) promoter. Unlike the HIV-1 vector system, this plasmid does not express any HIV-1 proteins, since it contains only the viral LTR and packaging site.39 CHME5 cells were either transfected with the plasmid pHR'-GFP or transduced with the eGFP expressing HIV-1 vector (HIV-GFP) at a multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 1. Then 48 h later, cells were treated with lipopolysaccharide (LPS) to induce cell death. Since it has been reported that LPS-induced cell death in macrophage and microglia requires blockade of protein synthesis,40 the cells were also treated with cycloheximide (CHX;10 \u03bcg/ml). Cells were then analyzed by the cytotoxicity/viability assay, which uses a combination of intracellular esterase activity (a characteristic of live cells, green) and binding of the ethidium homodimer to DNA (a marker for dead cells, red). Following HIV-1 vector transduction or lipofectamine-mediated plasmid transfection (for pHR'GFP), approximately 75% of the cells expressed GFP (green). As shown in Figure 2(a), CHME5 cells that were either transfected with the GFP expressing plasmid (pHR'-GFP) or transduced with the HIV-1 GFP vector (HIV-GFP), did not undergo cell death in the absence of LPS/CHX (as shown by the lack of red or yellow cells in the merged fields). However, when cells transfected with pHR'GFP were treated with LPS/CHX, extensive cell death was induced (as shown by the red/yellow staining in the merged fields). In contrast, CHME5 cells transduced with pseudotyped HIV-1 (HIV-GFP) remained viable (no yellow staining in merged field) following treatment with LPS/CHX. Under these conditions, only the adjacent, untransduced cells lacking HIV-GFP expression underwent cell death (Figure 2(a)). These data demonstrate that the HIV-1 vector transduced CHME5 cells, which express HIV-1 Gag, Pol, Tat, Rev, Vpr and Vif, have an extended survival phenotype.",

Although the HIV-1 vector used in Figure 1, Figure 2 expresses multiple viral proteins, we reasoned that the expressed viral accessory proteins (Tat, Vpr, Vif or Vpu) might contribute to microglial protection. In particular, we sought to determine whether the expression of Tat protein, the HIV-1 transcriptional activator, plays a role in the survival of microglia. To test this, we developed stable sublines of the human microglial cell line CHME5 containing either an empty vector (pCDNA3.1-hygromycin; control) or a vector encoding the 101 amino acid long full-length Tat (pTat101) previously cloned from the M-tropic YU-2 HIV-1 strain. The clonally selected sublines were analyzed for the presence of the Tat gene by performing PCR amplification of genomic DNA and functionally for the activation of the HIV LTR using the Magi assay (data not shown). In order to induce cell death in the CHME5 sublines, the cells were exposed to two different concentrations of LPS (10 \u03bcg and 100 \u03bcg/ml) and CHX (10 \u03bcg/ml) for 6 h and analyzed for viability as described above. As shown in Figure 3(a), the treatment of LPS at 10 \u03bcg and 100 \u03bcg/ml, together with CHX, induced 20% and 34.5% cell death, respectively, in the control CHME5 subline (pCDNA3.1), as determined by the trypan blue exclusion assay. In contrast, CHME5 cells expressing Tat displayed only 2\u20133% cell death at both concentrations of LPS (Figure 3(a)). In these assays, CHX treatment alone failed to induce cell death in the CHME5 sublines. Next, cellular viability was examined by performing the cytotoxicity assay (Figure 3(b)). The results confirmed the viable cell counts and revealed that cells expressing either Tat (pTat101) or the control plasmid (pCDNA3.1) remained viable (green) in the absence of LPS/CHX treatment. However, upon treatment, control cells (but not Tat-expressing cells) underwent extensive cell death (as shown by extensive red staining) and loss of viability (as reflected by the loss of the green esterase staining). Importantly, we tested a total of three independent clonal Tat expressing CHME5 sublines, and we observed that these three CHME5 sublines displayed similar elevated survival comparable to the subline data presented in Figure 3. Together, these results indicate that the intracellular expression of Tat may promote the survival of CHME5 microglial cells upon apoptotic challenge.",

To achieve this, we expressed a dominant negative mutant form of Akt in the CHME5 cells. This mutant molecule (Akt K179A, referred to as dn-Akt) contains a substitution of lysine residue 179 with alanine, and functions as a dominant negative inhibitor of signal-mediated Akt activation.41 In these experiments, CHME5 sublines (containing pTat101 or pCDNA3.1) were transiently transfected with an empty vector (representing endogenous Akt) or a vector encoding dn-Akt 24 h prior to treatment. Cells were then exposed to LPS and CHX (100 and 10 \u03bcg/ml, respectively) for 24 h and cellular viability was analyzed. As expected, we found that transfection of K179A resulted in an increase in the amount of cell death induced following LPS/CHX treatment (Figure 5\n). Transient transfection of the Akt mutant did not seem to influence the survival of untreated cells. This suggests that expression of dn-Akt was able to reverse the cytoprotective effect of Tat in CHME5 cells. The extent of susceptibility restored in the Tat-expressing cells reflects the transfection efficiency of the dominant negative Akt mutant (\u223c75% efficiency). Based on the results from the pharmacological (Figure 4) and genetic (Figure 5) interferences of the PI-3-K/Akt pathway, we concluded that the activation of the PI-3-K/Akt pathway by intracellular Tat might be required for Tat to promote microglial survival.",

More specifically, p53 upregulates the transcription of PTEN, and PTEN stabilizes p53 by directly binding to the C-T end of p53.33 Importantly, it has been demonstrated that HIV-1 Tat also directly interacts with the C-T region of p53.42 Therefore, we tested whether intracellular Tat may compete with PTEN for p53 binding, which may induce the destabilization of p53 and decrease of PTEN levels, ultimately facilitating activation of the PI-3-K/Akt survival pathway. To test this possibility, we examined the PTEN level of CHME5 cells in the presence and absence of intracellular Tat expression as well as HIV-1 transduction. As shown in Figure 6(a), the PTEN level significantly decreased upon transduction with the HIV-GFP vector. More interestingly, the expression of HIV-1 Tat in CHME5 microglial cells also led to a drastic decrease in PTEN levels. This suggests that the down-regulation of PTEN by intracellular Tat and HIV-1 infection may be a potential mechanism for stimulation of the PI-3-K/Akt survival pathway.",

For this test, we transfected CHME5 cells with a p53-regulated luciferase reporter plasmid together with pcDNA-lacZ and pTat101 or pCDNA3.1. CHME5 cells were derived from human fetal microglia following transformation with the simian virus 40 (SV40) large T antigen. This molecule is known to directly interact with p53 and inhibit its activity.49 However, as shown in Figure 6(b), we observed that CHME5 cells exhibited a basal activity of p53 which was still detectable. This basal activity was comparable with the basal activity of p53 in other cell types that contain SV40 large T antigen.50 Importantly, as predicted, p53 activity was further drastically decreased (5.3% of control) following expression of Tat in CHME5 cells (Figure 6(b)). As an additional control, the cells were transfected with a control p53- luciferase plasmid that lacks functional p53 binding elements (p53 mt promoter) and the luciferase expression from this control mutant construct remained low following expression of HIV-1 Tat in CHME5 cells. These data suggest that expression of Tat in the microglial cell line system induces the inhibition of the transcription activator function of p53, which is consistent with the decrease of PTEN in the CHME5 Tat expression model system.",

One of the key molecular events involved in the promotion of cell proliferation is the activation of the E2F transcription factor which is responsible for the expression of a number of genes essential for the cell cycle exit from G1 and entry into S phase.45 Therefore, we examined E2F activity in CHME5 cells expressing HIV-1 Tat. CHME5 cells were transiently transfected with an E2F-driven luciferase reporter plasmid together with either an empty expression vector (pCDNA3.1) or pTat101. As a positive control, cells were transfected with an expression plasmid (E6/E7) that contains the human papilloma virus type 16 (HPV-16)-encoded E6/E7 proteins, which are known to increase E2F activity.47 In all cases, pCDNA3.1-LacZ was also included as an internal control for normalization of luciferase assay results. After transfection, cells were incubated for 72 h in media containing either 5%, 0.1% or 0% fetal bovine serum (FBS) and luciferase activity was measured. As expected, high luciferase activity was observed following co-expression of the E6/E7 proteins, presumably due to the activation of E2F by E6/E7 (Figure 6(c)).48 Similarly, Tat-expressing cells also displayed significantly higher luciferase activity as compared to the control cells even following the stress of serum starvation. These data imply that the intracellular expression of Tat contributes to the activation of E2F in the microglial cell line. We also found that expression of Tat in our system stimulated enhanced proliferative activity and DNA synthesis capability compared with control cells (data not shown).",

Macrophages were infected with M-tropic HIV-1 Bal (1.1 \u00d7 107 pg, equivalent to vector MOI 40) and treated with LPS (15 \u03bcg/ml) and CHX (10 \u03bcg/ml) at 48 h post-infection. The live (green) and dead (red) cells were monitored at 24 h post-treatment. As shown in Figure 7(a), macrophage infected with HIV-1 Bal displayed a decreased number of dead cells (red), as compared to uninfected macrophage (incubated with heat-inactivated virus). This suggests that infection with HIV-1 Bal induces a protective effect in primary human macrophage following cytotoxic challenge. Next, we employed an HIV-1 vector pseudotyped with the VSV-G envelope protein. This HIV-1 vector system expresses eGFP and all HIV-1 viral proteins except the Env and Nef proteins.39 Following transduction with the pseudotyped HIV-1 vector (HIV-GFP), macrophages were treated with LPS (25 \u03bcg/ml) and CHX (10 \u03bcg/ml), and cell viability was examined. In this assay, we used only the cell death specific ethidium homodimer to detect dead cells (red). As shown in Figure 7(b), human macrophage transduced by the HIV-1 vector system (green) exhibited greatly diminished levels of cell death (red) than the control macrophage (incubated with heat-inactivated vector). It is important to point out that none of the transduced cells (green) showed characteristics of cell death (as shown by distinct red or green staining in the merged field). These data demonstrate that HIV-1 infection induces a cytoprotective effect in human monocyte-derived macrophage. Interestingly, the data with the HIV-1 vector system also suggest that Env and Nef, which are deleted in the pseudotyped vector, are not involved in this HIV-1 induced cell survival effect.",

One of the known ways to induce microglial apoptosis is through increased nitric oxide (NO) production.44 In fact, HIV-1 infection is known to activate microglia, which leads to the production of nitric oxide.45 Another source of NO during HIV-1 infection is through the secretion of gp120, the viral envelope glycoprotein, which can induce production from bystander CNS cell types.46 This additive effect on NO production by HIV-1 infection induces apoptosis in neighboring cells such as neurons. Normally, the overactivation of microglia sensitizes them to undergo apoptosis through a feedback mechanism.47 However, despite the large amounts of NO produced during HIV-1 infection, microglia still exhibit an extended survival phenotype. Therefore, we next tested whether primary human macrophages infected with HIV-1 exhibited this cytoprotective effect following exposure to sodium nitroprusside, an NO donor.48 As shown in Figure 7(c), macrophage exposed to heat-inactivated virus exhibited significant cell death (red cells) upon exposure to sodium nitroprusside (SNP). However, macrophage infected with HIV-1 BAL did not display any significant induction in cell death even under the conditions of increased NO production. Consistent with this, primary macrophage transduced using our pseudotyped vector system (green cells) also exhibited a survival effect following SNP treatment (Figure 7(d)), whereas macrophages incubated with heat-inactivated vector displayed significant cell death upon SNP treatment. It is also important to emphasize that although SNP treatment resulted in a greater stress than LPS, inducing higher amounts of cell death, HIV-1 infected macrophages still exhibited a potent cytoprotective effect (the absence of red cells in Figure 7(c) and (d)).",

Importantly, we demonstrated that the intracellular expression of the HIV-1 Tat protein was able to induce a strong cytoprotective effect in CHME5 cells. The possibility that secreted Tat protein from the CHME5 cells expressing Tat may also induce the same effect was eliminated when we observed that CHME5 cells treated with recombinant Tat protein (0.2 \u03bcM) did not show increased cell survival (data not shown). Furthermore, we later confirmed that primary human monocyte-derived macrophages infected with HIV-1 also exhibited prolonged survival upon cytotoxic challenges, further validating the CHME5 microglial cells as a model system to study the molecular mechanisms involved with the cytoprotective effect.",

We therefore tested the possible involvement of the PI-3-K/Akt pathway using Wortmannin and LY294002, two unrelated inhibitors specific for PI-3-K. Both of these inhibitors reversed the survival effect induced by the expression of Tat, suggesting that the PI-3-K pathway is indeed involved in the pro-survival effect of Tat in CHME5 cells. This interpretation was confirmed using an independent genetic test in which cells were transfected with a dominant negative (kinase inactive) Akt mutant;41 this led to the restoration of cell death in Tat-expressing cells. This mutant, however, did not affect the sensitivity of the control cells to cell death in response to LPS and CHX. These data strongly suggest that Tat promotes survival in microglia via activation of the PI-3-K/Akt pathway.",

We therefore modeled the mechanism of intracellular HIV-1 Tat and HIV-1 infection-induced cell survival in the CHME5 human microglia system (Figure 9\n). It is known that both Tat and PTEN bind to the C-terminal region of p53, and therefore these two proteins may compete with each other for p53. Importantly, PTEN binding to p53 stabilizes p53, and p53 upregulates PTEN expression transcriptionally.43 Therefore, expression of Tat and HIV-1 infection possibly induce the destabilization of p53 by competing with PTEN, and this ultimately leads to the decrease of PTEN levels, which we observed in Figure 6(a). The decreased PTEN level is known to facilitate the activation of the PI-3-K/Akt pathway, which directly promotes cell proliferation and cell survival (pathway A in Figure 9). In addition, the decrease of p53 function by HIV-1 Tat expression may also lead to the activation of cell proliferation signals such as the E2F transcription factor, following release from Rb (pathway B in Figure 9). The free E2F can then up-regulate a number of genes essential for G1/S transition and cell proliferation, which is a key mechanism in cellular survival. E2F also transcriptionally induces expression of an adaptor protein involved in the activation of the Akt pathway, an upstream mechanism of regulating this survival pathway.52 Future studies on downstream cellular factors involved in Akt cellular survival (i.e. GSK3\u03b2, Bad) and cell cycle control pathways (p53, MDM2, p21Cip1, CyclinD and Rb) may reveal more precisely the point at which Tat influences cell signaling cascades in microglia, in order to elicit its protective effect.29., 30., 53., 54., 55.\n",

Interestingly, we have also observed that primary human macrophages infected with HIV-1 display a strong cytoprotective effect upon treatment with SNP, an NO donor (Figure 7(c) and (d); Figure 8). Another well characterized cytotoxic extracellular protein secreted from HIV-1 infected macrophages is TRAIL (TNF related apoptosis inducing ligand), which can directly induce cell death in not only neighboring neuron cells but also the infected microglia in CNS.78., 79., 80. It has been demonstrated that HIV-1 infected macrophages become sensitive to TRAIL, whereas uninfected macrophages are resistant to TRAIL.79 In addition, it was reported that the TRAIL levels in HIV-1 infected patients are elevated, compared to uninfected healthy individuals.79 Indeed, this finding led to the testing of TRAIL as an agent to specifically kill infected macrophages. Unexpectedly, however, the treatment with recombinant TRAIL did not reduce viral production and cell death.80 One possible explanation for this failure was that the local concentration of TRAIL near infected microglia may not reach a high enough concentration to induce the apoptosis of infected macrophage and microglia.80., 81. Alternatively, HIV-1 might have already evolved to escape efficiently from the cytotoxic effect of TRAIL in microglia and macrophages as implied by the observation of persistent HIV-1 infection in the CNS.",

This may have important implications for the pathogenesis of HIV-associated dementia, since virally infected microglia represent an important source of soluble effector molecules that can lead to the dysfunction and death of neurons. Finally, our studies show that Tat manipulates Akt signaling and cell cycle regulatory pathways in such a way as to extend cell survival. This in turn may lead to the establishment of long-lived cellular reservoirs of HIV-1 infection in the CNS. Furthermore, our cell line model can serve as a useful tool for elucidating the molecular, cellular and virological elements that contribute to persistent HIV-1 infection in the CNS.",

HIV-1 infection or expression of intracellular HIV-1 Tat results in decreased PTEN expression which alleviates the restraint on activation of the PI-3-K/Akt pathway. The increased activation of PI-3-K and Akt leads to long-term cellular survival.85 Intracellular Tat can also decrease activity of p53, which in turn leads to progression through the cell cycle, activating the E2F transcription factor and proliferation-specific signals.86 E2F also regulates survival by transcriptionally activating an upstream adaptor protein involved in the activation of the PI-3-K/Akt pathway.52 The combined modulation of PTEN and p53 by expression of Tat leads to the increased activation of proliferation and long-term cellular survival exhibited in microglia during HIV-1 infection: dotted lines, negative regulation; thick arrows, positive regulation; thin arrows, effects of intracellular Tat expression and HIV-1 infection.",
