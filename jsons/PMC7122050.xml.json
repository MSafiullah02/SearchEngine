            "text": "Pulmonary hypoplasia in the neonate is an abnormal reduction in mass or volume of the lungs with a normal pattern of lobation. Depending on the extent of hypoplasia and the morphological stage of bronchiolar and alveolar maturation, severe \u00adhypoplasia is often incompatible with postnatal life. Multiple developmental and structural anomalies of the thoracic cavity and lungs are associated with pulmonary hypoplasia and neonatal death (Table 3.1) [1]. Co-existing systemic developmental abnormalities may occur with pulmonary hypoplasia. Examples include small or malformed thoracic cavities, hydrops fetalis, oligohydramnios sequence with \u00adassociated genitourinary disorders, premature rupture of fetal membranes, large intrapulmonary or abdominal mass lesions, diaphragmatic malformations (Fig. 3.1), central nervous system disorders associated with impaired breathing and cardiovascular disorders associated with reduced pulmonary blood flow. In particular, the oligohydramnios or Potter\u2019s Sequence highlights the central role of the genitourinary system and its associated production of urine in the staged development of the lung parenchyma. Examples of conditions associated with deficient amniotic fluid production or premature loss include renal agenesis, cystic renal dysplasia, \u00adpolycystic kidney disease, cloacal agenesis, urethral atresia, posterior urethral valves as well as chronic leakage of amniotic fluid [1].\n\n",

In addition, examination of the lungs in situ, prior to evisceration and disruption of the thoracic cavity is suggested to properly assess the underlying anatomy and associated pathology. Unfortunately, the degree of pulmonary hypoplasia necessary to cause clinically significant morbidity or mortality is not precisely defined by the available literature. Thus, correlation of the gross and histological findings with the clinical history is important for correct interpretation of the postmortem findings and evaluating their potential contribution to the ultimate cause of death.",

            "text": "Acute lung injury may occur as a consequence of numerous insults such as \u00adinfection, shock, drug effects, or assisted ventilation. In the setting of significant prematurity, surfactant deficiency may cause acute lung injury with the development of hyaline membranes. Depending on the degree of prematurity and the duration of the insult, a spectrum of acute and chronic phases of diffuse alveolar damage (DAD) can be identified, which may ultimately lead to remodeling of the underlying lung architecture and reduced respiratory reserve. In the context of the appropriate clinical \u00adhistory, respiratory distress syndrome (RDS) or surfactant deficiency syndrome is the clinical correlate for hyaline membrane disease identified in the premature infant at autopsy. The histological changes identified in premature infants are mirrored in studies of surfactant-deficient mice (surfactant protein A: SP-A \u2212/\u2212 mice) [2]. The microscopic features can include collapsed distal airspaces with hyaline \u00admembranes, fibrinous intra-alveolar exudates, pneumocyte hyperplasia, leakage of erythrocytes, acute and chronic alveolar, and interstitial inflammation, as well as collections of siderophages and foamy macrophages. With time organizing pneumonia, granulation tissue plugs within respiratory bronchioles and architectural remodeling of the interstitium may be observed. Neonates born with surfactant \u00addeficiency during the late saccular and early alveolar stages (32\u201336 weeks) usually do not die as a consequence of their prematurity-associated lung disease. However, neonates with extreme prematurity (<28 weeks) in the canalicular stage of lung development (16\u201328 weeks) or those under 1,000 g are most at risk for RDS and bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) [3].",

In addition, medial hypertrophy of pulmonary arteries and arterioles may also be noted in regions of significant parenchymal remodeling (microscopic honeycomb change). Importantly, marked lung injury in infants born before 28 weeks gestation may cause arrest of alveolar development and subsequent deficiency of gas exchange [3].

The histological changes induced by chronic positive pressure ventilation frequently overlap with those of the underlying\u00ad disease and include acute phase diffuse alveolar damage, interstitial edema, and inflammation. Mechanistically, ventilator-induced lung injury is thought to contribute to alveolar damage by multiple mechanisms. These include (1) barotrauma with elevated shear stress on the alveolar lining; (2) volutrauma with large tidal volumes that can disrupt the epithelial\u2013capillary interface; (3) \u00adatelectrauma caused by mechanical ventilation-associated stress fracture of the epithelial\u2013\u00adcapillary interface following repetitive opening and closing of alveoli; and finally, (4) biotrauma, which follows the influx of neutrophils and inflammatory mediators in response to lung injury [1].

Pulmonary interstitial emphysema can potentially extend into adjacent hilar soft tissues, leading to the development of pneumomediastinum, pnueumopericardium, pneumothorax, or rarely air embolism, which has been associated with sudden death. These ventilation-associated injuries may be appreciated radiologically as meandering cystic and tubular lucencies that fail to conform to the predicted pattern of air bronchograms; thin-walled cysts (pneumatoceles) may also be identified [2]. When prominent and unilateral, pulmonary interstitial emphysema, pneumatoceles, and pneumothoracies can rarely cause shift of the mediastinal structures under tension and promote cardiovascular collapse and death.",

            "text": "Determination of whether a fetus was born alive or was stillborn, not having had a separate living existence from its mother, is a frequent question posed to forensic pathologists. Under the best of circumstances, this determination is difficult. Classically, the flotation or hydrostatic test is utilized, which is based on the premise that en bloc lungs or an individual lung placed in water will float if aerated, \u00adsuggesting that the neonate had at some point breathed or sink if nonaerated, \u00adsignifying that the fetus was stillborn [4]. Interpretation of the results of this is fraught with difficulty in and it is not recommended to be used in isolation to make a determination of live birth. Potential causes for false-positive results could include air trapping due to attempted resuscitation or the production of postmortem gases by bacteria during putrefactive decomposition. Gas-producing bacteria may be introduced into the airways, for example, through postdelivery contamination when delivered into a toilet or as a consequence of choramnionitis. Furthermore, we have encountered the circumstance where lungs were examined separately and revealed that one lung sank and the other floated. Moreover, interpreting an increase in the lung\u2019s mass as evidence of perimortem breathing, thought to be due to expansion and vascular perfusion of the parenchyma, is also a poor indicator of live birth [4]. Histological sections of the lung may show evidence of alveoli expanded by air following a live birth. However, the results must be tempered by the postmortem interval and the possibility of postmortem gas production by microorganisms. In addition, the presence of diffuse alveolar damage or pneumonia would strongly suggest that the infant was live born.",

It is important to consider undertaking a complete autopsy with sampling of body fluids and tissues examined when investigating an unknown infectious pathogen. This serves two purposes; first, it allows one to confirm that the cause of death was as a result of primary pulmonary disease caused by a putative pathogen, and second, permits procurement of varied tissues for analysis as it is not always clear prior to the autopsy that an unknown pathogen associated with respiratory failure is best isolated from lung tissue. Moreover, if pneumonia is identified, a complete autopsy may permit one to assess if that infection is primary or perhaps secondary to some other pathologic process, such as bronchial obstruction due to occult carcinoma. Anecdotally, during the SARS (severe acute respiratory syndrome) and Legionella pneumonia outbreaks in Toronto, a number of deaths that were clinically suspected to be due to the infectious agent in question were ultimately determined to be the result of other pathologies.

In the absence of evidence of a significant host response such as an acute inflammatory infiltrate, it is very difficult to substantiate a diagnosis of perimortem aspiration. Migration of gastric contents into the airways may also occur during attempted resuscitation of the decedent. In addition, even if early acute inflammatory infiltrates are identified in association with foodstuffs in the airway, aspiration of gastric contents can commonly occur in extremis. Consequently, these findings should not necessarily be interpreted to mean that airway occlusion by aspirated gastric contents contributed to the death of the individual being autopsied.

It is important to recognize that some forms of primary pulmonary hypertension can be inherited and that one should consider communicating this within the autopsy report; however, \u00adsecondary causes for pulmonary hypertension are far more frequently detected at autopsy. The morphological changes associated with pulmonary hypertension may be subtle when examining the heart and lungs macroscopically at autopsy. Associated morphological lesions may include \u201ccirrhosis\u201d (cardiac sclerosis), right ventricular hypertrophy, thickening and myxomatous degeneration of the tricuspid and less commonly the pulmonary valves, ectasia of the pulmonary arterial vasculature with or without atherosclerosis, intravascular thrombi, pulmonary infarcts, and nonspecific interstitial fibrous tissue deposition. Microscopically, the lesions may be plexogenic or nonplexogenic in nature and depending on the nature of the underlying cause for hypertension, may involve both arterial and venous vessels. Complications of chronic pulmonary hypertension can include cor pulmonale, dissection of the pulmonary arteries [24] and massive intrapulmonary hemorrhage [25].\n",
