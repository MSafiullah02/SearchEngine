Xue et al. [28] showed that additional residues at the N-terminus, but not at the C-terminus, of the main protease are detrimental to enzyme activity. However, Bacha et al. [15] showed that the N-terminal His-tag affected the K\nd. The N-His6- and C-His6-cleaved WT had K\nd of 0.35 and 5.6 \u03bcM, respectively [8], whereas the uncleaved N-His6- and C-His6-WT had K\nd of 0.19 \u03bcM [10] and 0.08 \u03bcM, respectively. As shown in Fig. 1A, His6 tag at the C-terminus is pointed away from the dimer interfacial region. It is reasonable to assume that it will not affect the quaternary structure of the C-terminal truncation mutants; but for those mutations at the inner site, it might create problems. However, with proper WT control, these mutants may still provide useful information about the critical amino acids. Considering these caveats, an attempt has been made to interpret the biological implications of the results obtained in this study.",

In the alanine-substituted mutants, the quaternary structures of R298A and Q299A were found to exist in a mixture of monomeric and dimeric forms (Fig. 3B and C). These data were complementary to the earlier-mentioned truncated proteases data. Yet, we found the double mutant, R298A/Q299A, was present almost exclusively in the monomeric form (Fig. 3D). This finding indicated that both residues were crucial to dimerization. Arg-298 that was changed to leucine also destroyed 85% of the enzyme activity (k\ncat) (Table 3), whereas Arg-298 that was changed to lysine had no significant difference to WT in k\ncat. Gln-299 that changed to glutamate, lysine, or asparagine also ruined more than 90% of the enzyme activity (Table 3).",

Increased hydrophobic interactions between the subunits of the double mutants might be accounted for these seem odd results. We have no further structural evidence to prove this speculation yet.

Although K\nd increased as the K\nm/k\ncat and k\ncat decreased, K\nm did not. This data suggested that K\nd was related to the catalysis but not to the apparent binding ability between substrate and proteases. Similar observations were found for the relationship between K\nm/k\ncat, K\nm, k\ncat, and k\noff. The k\noff also affected only the catalytic rate but not the substrate binding ability. The increase of K\nd and k\noff correlated with the increase of monomeric form protease, which also correlated directly with the decrease of enzyme activity. All these results indicated that the monomeric SARS-CoV main protease was enzymatically inactive and this enzyme provides an ideal model system to study an enzyme activity regulated through quaternary structure.",
