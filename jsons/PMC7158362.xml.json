The risk of transmission of infection depends on the type of device. For example, in case of blood pressure\u2013measuring cuff, the device that comes in contact with the skin carries least risk of transmission of disease. On the other hand, devices that come in contact with the neural tissue of a patient suffering from Creutzfeldt\u2013Jakob disease (CJD) have high risk of transmission of infection.9, 10, 11 To reduce the potential risks of transmission of infection through different devices, Earle H. Spaulding in 1968 proposed a classification to define the desired level of antimicrobial killing for different devices.12 He categorized the devices into three categories depending on the potential risk of transmission of infectious agents: critical, semicritical, and noncritical (Table 59.1\n).",

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) in 1991 proposed an additional category to Spaulding\u2019s classification as \u201cenvironmental surfaces\u201d to represent the surfaces that usually do not come in contact with patient.13 Environmental surfaces can be further subgrouped as clinical contact surfaces (medical equipment or high-touch surfaces) and housekeeping surfaces. CDC defines clinical contact surfaces as the areas that act like reservoirs of microorganisms, e.g., hands of health care workers. High-touch surfaces such as telephone, light switch board, bedrails, computer, door handle, and medical equipment like ventilator, X-ray machines, and hemodialysis machines are the contacting equipment that subsequently contact the patient. CDC had issued guidelines for hand washing and hospital environmental control. Different LLDs and ILDs that can be used to disinfect the clinical contact surfaces were approved by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). The housekeeping surfaces such as walls, floor, and sinks carry very low risk of transmission of infection. So, disinfection of such surfaces is less frequent in comparison to the previous one.",

About 40\u201360% of relative humidity should be maintained inside the ORs for the comfort of the staff. Ventilation causes exchange of air, and thereby removes all the bacteria released from the patient during the operative procedure and dilutes the anesthetic gases from the ORs. The direction of air flow should remain from the ORs to the main corridor. It has been observed that turbulent air flow exchanges the air more efficiently than low-velocity unidirectional flow. The anesthetic gases should be removed other than the main exhaust. Filters with an efficiency of 20\u201340% are adequate at the entry side. HEPA filters, which can remove particles of size >0.3 \u03bcm with efficiency of >99.97% are used as the second-line filters near the ORs, ICUs, burn wards etc. Air from the HEPA filters flow unidirectionally (vertically or horizontally) causing few airborne bacteria at the operation site. Exponential laminar air flow has been designed to overcome the limitation. The recommended air change rates (ACHs) in ORs and recovery room are 20 ACH/h and 12\u201315 ACH/h, respectively. In ultraclean ventilated theaters, the minimum ACH should be 37 ACH/h.",

The rate of microbial contamination in a well-designed, properly filtered, ventilated, and disinfected OT is much less. In conventionally ventilated theaters, microbiological sampling is done in the following way. Close all the doors of the ORs and keep empty for 1 h. Using an air sampler, >250 L [recommended amount is 1 m3 air (100 L)] air should be exposed to the no-selective culture medias. At least two samples should be taken per OR. The colony count should not exceed 50\u2013150 CFU/m3. As per the UK guidelines, with a 5-min exposure, the standard bacterial count should not exceed 35 bacterial and/or fungal particles per cubic metre of ventilating air. Similarly, the Geneva guidelines takes the standard of 25 CFU/m3 for an empty OR and 180 CFU/m3 for 5-min exposure. The working condition of HEPA filters should be checked first. In properly functioning HEPA filters, the amount of airborne microbial contamination is very low. In unidirectional air flow zone, microbiological sampling is done from the four corners of the perimeter zone, one from the center and four from the inner corners of the inner zone. This zone should not contain more than 0.5 CFU/m3.\n",

The patients in the ICUs are observed to be more ill, receiving multiple high antibiotics, on multiple devices, and exposed to multiple antibiotic-resistant colonizers. The incidence of HAIs is found to be five to six times higher in the ICUs than in the general wards. The overall rate of ICU infection varies from 5% to 35% of which approximately 25% are hospital-acquired infections. The most common infections observed in the ICU setup are ventilator-associated infection (VAP), CR-BSI, CA-UTI, SSI, C. difficile-associated diarrheas, etc. Among these infections device-related infection (VAP, CA-BSI, CA-UTI) constitute 80%. Various risk factors for the development of infections are divided into host-related and hospital-related factors. The host-related factors include severity of diseases, extreme of ages, immunocompromised conditions (malignancy/transplant/organ failure/HIV infection), burn injury, trauma, and extensive surgeries. The factors related to the hospital or treatment are device related, treatment on immunosuppressive drugs, multiple blood transfusion, hemodialysis, parenteral nutrition, prolong immobilization, etc. Since most of the infections are caused by the colonizers, the common pathogens isolated in these infections are MRSA, VRE, ESBL-producing gram-negative bacteria, Stenotrophomonas maltophilia, fluconazole-resistant Candida spp., etc.",

Various recommendations for the prevention of VAP include (1) appropriate cleaning, disinfection, and sterilization of ventilator equipment, (2) maintenance of ventilator circuits, and (3) routine care of patients requiring ventilation.14 The cleaning, disinfection, and sterilization of the equipment have been discussed earlier in the chapter. The preventive measures taken for the patients to reduce the rate of VAP are use of orotracheal intubation, noninvasive ventilation, minimization of the duration of ventilation. The patient should be maintained in semirecumbent position (30\u201345 degrees elevation of head of the bed). Regular oral care should be performed. CA-UTI is another common cause of infection in the ICUs14. Staff must be trained enough to differentiate asymptomatic bacteriuria from infection due to catheterization. Regular education regarding repeated hand washing before and after catheterization, maintenance of a closed system, maintaining free urine flow, and securing the catheter position correctly should be given to the health care workers for the prevention of these infections. SSI is a very common and life-threatening infection during ICU stays.14 There are various evidence-based guidelines recommended by the CDC. Preoperative patient preparation, management of the colonizers, correct surgical technique, adequate antimicrobial prophylaxis, adequate sterilization and disinfection of the environmental surfaces, proper aseptic techniques, as well as washing surgical hands before and after the operative procedure are various preventive measures that can be taken to reduce the incidence of SSIs.",
