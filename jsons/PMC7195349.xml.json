Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 or SARS-CoV-2, more commonly and simply known as coronavirus and the cause of COVID-19, first emerged at the close of 2019 in Wuhan, a city in Central China.1 Sufferers may be asymptomatic or suffer mild to life-threatening respiratory symptoms. In mid-March 2020, the disease's spread across the globe was such that the World Health Organization (WHO) officially labelled the COVID-19 outbreak a pandemic.2 To control the spread of the virus, it is essential to implement strict preventative measures, including repeated hand-washing with water and soap.",

The popularity of alcohol-based sanitizers in healthcare and community settings coupled with the risk of methanol poisoning and ineffective hand antisepsis posed by falsified sanitizers demands a response. It is recommended that regulatory and public health bodies take an active role in ensuring the safety and quality of antimicrobial products such as alcohol-based hand sanitizers at every stage of the products\u2019 lifecycle, including distribution, manufacture and import. Specifically, the following recommendations are made:1The introduction of regulatory and monitoring mechanisms throughout the manufacturing process to verify the purity of alcohol-based hand sanitizers.2The use of good manufacturing practice (GMP), research, reporting (of usage and any adverse effects), education and regulatory control to increase inspection and oversight of alcohol-based hand sanitizers' quality and safety.\n",
