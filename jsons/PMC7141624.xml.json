The diagnosis and clinical management of patients with COVID-19 were conducted in accordance with the practice guidelines issued by The Chinese National Health Commission.4 COVID-19 was confirmed by the detection of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) sequences in the throat swab by reverse transcription PCR. Liver injury was defined as hepatocellular if the alanine aminotransferase (ALT) level was >30 IU/L for males and >19 IU/L for females5; ductular if alkaline phosphatase (ALP) was >the upper limit of normal (ULN) accompanied by gamma-glutamyltransferase (GGT) >ULN; mixed if both hepatocellular and ductular enzymes were raised >ULN. NAFLD was identified as hepatic steatosis index (HSI = 8 \u00d7 [ALT/AST] + BMI [+ 2 if type 2 diabetes yes, + 2 if female]) >36 points and/or by abdominal ultrasound examination.6 The ALT/AST value used for HSI was taken either at complete recovery on discharge or from records of the patients before and within 12 months of the diagnosis of COVID-19. The patients were followed till discharged with recovery or disease progression. The study was approved by the Ethics Committees of FYSPH (20200303006) and the Fifth Medical Center of PLAGH (2020005D).",

This is of interest as it had been shown that biliary cells have high expression of angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE2) receptor with a high affinity for the spike protein of SARS-CoV-2.7 In other respiratory viral infection, hepatitis has been related to the collateral damage mediated by virus-specific effector cells generated in response to the pulmonary infection.8 The postmortem liver biopsy in one of our patients showed only microvesicular steatosis, accompanied by overactivation of T cells, suggesting that liver injury in COVID-19 is likely immune mediated rather than being the result of direct cytopathic damage, as described for other viral respiratory diseases.9 The majority of patients in our series with persistent liver injury had NAFLD and high BMI. Patients with NAFLD also had a higher risk of progression to severe COVID-19 and longer viral shedding time. With increasing global prevalence of NAFLD, this may suggest a large proportion of our population could be at risk of severe COVID-19.",

In particular, there are abundant ACE2 receptors in the small intestine and clinically, patients complain of abdominal pain and diarrhea. Circulation of the virus via the hepatic reticular system is expected, given the rich supply of blood to the liver from the small bowel. The liver contains the largest number of macrophages (Kupffer cells) in the body and is a potent cytokine producer. Impaired hepatic innate immune status might play a critical role in COVID-19 outcome. We postulate that in patients with NAFLD, the polarization status of hepatic macrophages might be skewed from inflammation-promoting M1 macrophages to inflammation-suppressing M2 macrophages, leading to progression of COVID-19.10 However, a better understanding of the role of NAFLD in COVID-19 may have therapeutic implications.",
