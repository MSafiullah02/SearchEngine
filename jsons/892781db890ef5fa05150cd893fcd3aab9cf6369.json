Second, and as a part of their leadership traits, the authorities must possess the ability to adapt their remedy procedures to the dynamics of the epidemical crisis, potentially providing effective improvisations aimed at handling secondary disastrous events that evolve from the main disaster.

But experience show that these attempts are not likely to be fruitful: citizens of these countries can still find numerous ways to spread the information through social networks. Hence, data mining in electronic versions of newspapers and related media as well as in social networks is an important cyber warfare ammunition. In addition, it is well known (but not published) that many national security agencies are digitizing \"hard forms\" of publicly available information of other countries such as newspapers. These might be related to official, semi-official, or private media-outlets. This media, however, is easier to control by a country that is trying to conceal an epidemical outbreak. One interesting pattern in this situation is the appearance of a few news reports at the beginning of the outbreak, followed by acceleration in reports, followed by a complete seizure of these reports due to a discovery of the news by the country's leaders, followed by a complete ban on this news.",

Our work in this area assists the development of the related field of personalized medicine by correlating clinical, genetic, environmental, demographic, and other background geospatial data. Our TerraFly GeoCloud [18] system combines several diverse technologies and components in order to analyze and visualize geospatial data. In this system, a user can upload a spatial dataset and display it using the TerraFly Map API [26] . Datasets can be subsequently analyzed using various functions, such as Kriging, a geo-statistical estimator for unobserved locations, and Spatial Clustering, which involves the grouping of closely related spatial objects. Various analysis functions related to spatial epidemiology have been integrated into TerraFly GeoCloud. Analysis functions can be used by selecting the appropriate dataset and function in the interface menu, along with the variables to be analyzed. TerraFly GeoCloud then processes the data and returns a result that can be visualized on the TerraFly Map or on a chart. Results displayed on the map include a legend, which identifies certain range values by color. Certain visualizations are interactive, allowing additional information to be displayed.",

Perhaps the major reason for the ineffectiveness of classical techniques in dealing with a static hazard and obtaining a logical explanation of the existence of a static hazard lies in their failure to come to grips with the issue of fuzziness. This is due to the fact that the hazardous variable implies imprecision in the binary system, which does not stem from randomness but from the lack of a sharp transition between members in the class of input states. Intuitively, fuzziness is a type of imprecision that stems from a grouping of elements into classes that do not have sharply defined boundaries-that is, where there is no sharp transition from membership to non-membership. Thus, the transition of a state has a fuzzy behavior during the transition time.",

At the same time, classes of objects that do not have clear boundaries appear in the problems; the imprecision of such classes is expressed in the possibility that an element not only belongs or does not belong to a certain class, but that intermediate grades of membership are also possible. The membership grade is subjective; although it is natural to assign a lower membership grade to an event that have a lower probability of occurrence. The fact that the assignment of a membership function of a fuzzy set is \"non-statistical\" does not mean that we cannot use probability distribution functions in assigning membership functions.

Furthermore, incremental learning techniques can enable observing outliers and the Fuzzy inference can allow these outliers to coexist (with low degrees of membership) with \"main-stream\" data.

This degree of membership can be considered as degree of membership of order 2 and the class defined can be considered as a pure fuzzy class of order 1. Additionally, one can consider the definition of a fuzzy set (a class of order 0) as a mapping into a one-dimensional space and the definition of a pure fuzzy class (a class of order 1) as a mapping into a two-dimensional space. Hence, it is possible to consider a degree of membership of order N as well as a mapping into an N -dimensional space. The following is a recursive definition of a fuzzy class of order.

The main initial symptoms of the pandemic disease are: (1) \"high\" fever, (2) \"severe\" headaches. Many of the affected people are starting to post status and queries to a social network. While they do not clearly disclose infection, their status/queries might be indicative of a pandemic outbreak. Furthermore, assume that Bob, who is 27 years old and lives \"close\" to the north pole of Jupiter, sends a \"Twitter \" type of message to Alice, who is 57 years old and lives in the same area. The message reads \"Staying home today.\" Alice responds with \"What's wrong?\" Bob response is \"I have a headache and a bit of fever\". Figure 1 depicts some of this information in a complex fuzzy graph. In this graph the vertex 'B' represents Bob along with its degree of membership in a complex fuzzy class. The vertex 'A' represents the same for Alice and the directed edge from Bob to Alice represents the part of the communication between Bob and Alice where Bob reveals his membership in yet another complex fuzzy class. This type of graphs can be used to represent information, actions, and inference.",

Other terms related to complex fuzzy graphs are complete graphs, planner graphs and simple graphs, sub graphs, spanning sub-graphs, cliques, paths, cycles, tours, Euler tours, Euler cycles, Hamiltonian tours, Hamiltonian cycles, forests, and trees. The fundamental algorithms applied to complex fuzzy graphs are: (1) finding the shortest path between vertices, (2) finding the minimum spanning tree, (3) identifying maximal cliques, (4) finding the minimal Euler tour/cycle, and (5) finding the minimal Hamiltonian tour/cycle. In this context, short, max and min, might relate to the number of vertices/edges or the sum of weights of the relevant vertices/edges. These terms and algorithms are derived from their definitions in the context of non-fuzzy graphs [2] and fuzzy graphs [22] . We are currently working on the extension of these algorithms to complex fuzzy graphs. One interesting and relevant example is finding the maximal complex fuzzy clique in a complex fuzzy graph. In this example, we expand the work reported in [22] and use a neuro-fuzzy system as a \"tool\" for addressing the problem.",

            "text": "Clustering is a widely used mechanism for pattern recognition and classification. Fuzzy clustering (e.g., the Fuzzy C-means) enables patterns to become members of more than one cluster. Additionally, it enables maintaining clusters that represent outliers through low degree of membership. These clusters would be discarded in clustering of hard (vs. Fuzzy) data. Incremental and dynamic clustering (e.g., the incremental Fuzzy ISODATA) enable the clusters' structures to change as information is accumulated. Again, this is a strong mechanism for enabling identification of unlikely events without premature discarding of these events. The clustering can be performed in a traditional feature space composed of numerical measurements of feature values. Alternatively, the clustering can be performed in a multidimensional Fuzzy logic space where the features represent values of linguistic variables The combination of powerful classification capability, adaptive and dynamic mechanisms, as well as the capability to consider uncertain data, maintain data with low likelihood of occurrence, and use a combination of numerical and linguistic values makes this tool, one of the most promising tools for predicting epidemical crisis outbreaks. We currently conduct research on dynamic and incremental fuzzy clustering and it is evident that the methodology can serve as a highly efficient tool for identifying outliers. We plan to report on this research in the near future.",
