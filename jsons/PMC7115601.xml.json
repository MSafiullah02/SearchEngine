Currently, three different antigenic variants are known, namely CPV-2a, CPV-2b and CPV-2c, which are variously distributed worldwide [4], [5], [6], [7], [8]. The original type CPV-2, albeit no longer circulating in the field, is still contained in most CPV vaccines, whereas few commercially-available vaccines are prepared with CPV-2b [3]. Although CPV-2c is becoming the predominant strain in several countries [4], [5], [6], [7], [8], to date there are no licensed vaccines that contain the newest variant. Both CPV-2 and CPV-2b vaccinal strains cause viremia and are shed with the feces of immunized dogs, as also shown by their detection in specimens from dogs displaying acute gastroenteritis shortly after vaccination, alone or in addition to CPV field strains or other pathogens [9]. However, nothing is known about the real duration and extent of viremia and shedding of vaccinal CPVs.",

MLV CPV strains are able to replicate in the bloodstream and intestinal mucosa of vaccinated dogs, despite the unnatural route of administration (intramuscular or subcutaneous instead of oronasal), causing viremia and fecal shedding [19], [20]. In such a circumstance, the detection of CPV or its nucleic acid in the feces of vaccinated dogs could provide false-positive results, leading to a misdiagnosis of the disease probably caused by other enteric pathogens of dogs, i.e., canine coronavirus, canine distemper virus, reoviruses, rotaviruses, Salmonella spp., protozoa, parasites, etc. Moreover, there is the need to rule out vaccine-induced disease due to regaining of virulence of the vaccine virus. In a recent study [9], molecular testing of 29 fecal samples collected from dogs with diarrhea following CPV vaccination showed that in most cases those animals were infected by CPV field strains or other canine pathogens. However, 11 dogs were found to shed CPV vaccine strains in combination with field strains or other agents, whereas three samples tested positive for the vaccine strain without evidence of canine pathogens. To date, there are no molecular studies investigating the persistence of CPV vaccinal strains in the canine organism.",

By using real-time PCR, vaccine-induced viremia and fecal shedding occurred at higher titers for CPV-2b than for CPV-2. Interestingly, while viremia was observed for more days for CPV-2b (22 against 19 means days), the old-type vaccine strain was shed in the feces for a longer period (19 mean days) than the CPV-2b virus (12 mean days). Viral DNA loads detected by real-time PCR in the blood and feces of immunized dogs were generally much lower than those observed at least for the CPV variants causing natural or experimental infections [10], [21], [22]. In the feces, the field viruses can reach loads above 1012 DNA copies 10 \u03bcl\u22121 of template, while vaccinal strains were shed at maximal titers of 105\u2013106 DNA copies 10 \u03bcl\u22121 of template (mean values). As for the duration of the fecal shedding, it was surprising that CPV-2b, albeit shed at higher titers, was detected in the feces for a shorter period in comparison to the CPV-2 vaccinal strain. As expected, none vaccinated dogs displayed any clinical signs after vaccination. Moreover, the impact of concurrent infections on the MLV persistence was not investigated, thus requiring further studies.",

In-clinic testing and HA were proved to be poorly sensitive compared with nucleic acid-based assays, mainly due to sequestration of viral particles by gut antibodies especially during late infection [12], [23], [11]. In the present study, the maximal CPV DNA titers (more than 105 and 106 mean DNA copies 10 \u03bcl\u22121 of template for CPV-2 and CPV-2b viruses) were detected as early as one week post-vaccination when serum HI antibody titers were still absent or very low (Fig. 1C). However, the kinetic of the mucosal antibody response was not investigated in vaccinated animals, so that the presence of high titers of gut antibodies, likely mucosal IgAs, could not be ruled out. Our findings are in contrast with those of a recent study aiming to evaluate the feline panleukopenia virus (FPLV) vaccine-induced interference with fecal parvovirus diagnostic testing in cats [24]. This study showed that some cats had in-clinic assay positive results after FPLV vaccination although all kits employed contained CPV antibodies.",
