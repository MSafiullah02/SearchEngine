            "text": "Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) is a common disorder in the intensive care unit (ICU) and is associated with high mortality and morbidity [1]. The common causes includes sepsis, pneumonia, aspiration, etc. Tuberculosis (TB) remains a major public health problem in most of the developing world, and the epidemic of acquired immunodeficiency syndrome has resulted in a resurgence of TB the world over. Tuberculosis is a disease of protean manifestations with lungs being the most commonly involved site. Untreated pulmonary TB carries a mortality of 50% with the most common cause of death being extensive fibrocavitary disease and respiratory failure [2]. Tuberculosis can cause ARDS, and this usually occurs in the setting of disseminated disease such as miliary TB. There have been case reports and small case series describing association of ARDS and pulmonary TB [3, 4, 5, 6, 7]; however, TB is rarely recognized as a cause of ARDS. In fact, in none of the recent reviews does TB figure in the list of ARDS [1, 8]. Despite being a public health problem of significant magnitude in India [2], the largest series of TB and ARDS reported from India included only six cases of TB and ARDS over a 12-year period [4]. Although TB is a treatable illness, there has been a persistently high mortality (69\u201380%) in patients with severe pulmonary TB and acute respiratory failure [3, 6]. This is probably due to delayed recognition of the fact that TB can cause ARDS and acute respiratory failure [5]. Herein, we describe our experience with \u201ctuberculous ARDS\u201d, and alert the clinicians that tuberculosis can cause ARDS and must figure in the differential diagnosis of \u201ccryptic\u201d ARDS.",

Patients of ARDS, where the underlying cause was diagnosed as tuberculosis, were selected. The original case records of the patients were then retrieved from the central registration department. Demographic information, such as age and gender, underlying and/or concomitant diseases, and clinical status at admission to ICU, including the details of organ failure, were recorded. Details of the clinical manifestations and investigations, such as liver and renal function tests, arterial blood gases, HIV serology, complete blood count, and coagulation profile, were recorded. Details of their stay in RICU and ventilator strategy, APACHE II scores, treatment, and outcome were noted. At admission to the RICU, diagnosis of ARDS was established on the basis of acute onset respiratory distress, bilateral infiltrates on chest radiograph, PaO/FiO2 ratio <200, and no clinical or radiological evidence of left atrial hypertension [9]. All patients were mechanically ventilated (Puritan Bennett 7200 ae, Hamilton Amadeus). An informed consent was taken from all patients or their relatives as per protocol. Activity and outcome parameters are presented in a descriptive fashion (mean\u00b1SD or median with range).",

Infectious causes constituted the majority of cases of ARDS (78.6%). Nine of 187 (4.8%) patients (five males, four females) were finally diagnosed to have tuberculosis (TB) and ARDS. The mean age of these patients was 44.9 years (SD 12.6 years, range 28\u201362 years). The underlying comorbidities were post-renal transplant, alcoholism and diabetes mellitus in one patient each; one patient developed ARDS during pregnancy. Serology performed for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) was non-reactive in all the patients. The baseline characteristics, clinical presentations, radiological and laboratory parameters, investigations and the outcome of the patients are shown in Table 2. The median acute physiology and chronic health evaluation II (APACHE II) scores were 23 (range 16\u201331) and 19 (range 16\u201340) for the tuberculous and non-tuberculous ARDS, respectively. Although patients had fever, anorexia, weight loss and cough for a median duration of 45 days (range 15\u2013120 days), all had history of acute onset dyspnoea (duration <5 days). None of the patient had history of hemoptysis. Physical examination of the respiratory system was non-contributory; five patients had firm hepatosplenomegaly, two had cervical lymphadenopathy, three had clinical signs of meningitis and one patient had monoarticular arthritis. At admission, all patients had anaemia and hypoalbuminaemia; two patients had thrombocytopaenia, one leucopaenia, whereas none had coagulopathy. Three patients had hyponatraemia, one had conjugated hyperbilirubinaemia and five had raised serum alkaline phosphatase. The mean PaO2/FiO2 ratio was 148 (SD 43.1, range 80\u2013190). All patients were started empirically on four drug [Daily doses: isoniazid 5 mg/kg (maximum 300 mg); rifampicin 10 mg/kg (maximum 600 mg); pyrazinamide 25 mg/kg (maximum 2 gm); and ethambutol 15 mg/kg (maximum 1.2 gm)] anti-tubercular therapy (given through nasogastric tube) based on clinical suspicion and diagnostic procedures were attempted as clinically feasible. The median time to initiation of anti-tubercular therapy was 3 days (range 2\u20138 days). None of the patients received glucocorticoids.",

Fiberoptic bronchoscopy and transbronchial lung biopsy (TBB) was performed in 7 patients only once they were extubated, and was the most common method used for diagnosis. (The diagnosis in the remaining two patients was made on lymph node biopsy and joint aspirate; Table 2). The diagnosis was established with histopathological evidence of epithelioid granuloma and positive acid-fast bacilli on Ziehl-Neelsen stain. The overall mortality in patients with tuberculous ARDS was 22.2%. Multi-organ dysfunction syndrome (MODS) without evidence of any bacterial infection was seen in 3 patients.

Three of our patients had MODS without any evidence of bacterial infection, although all of them were also given empiric antibiotics to cover for bacterial infection. The clinical clues, which pointed towards the diagnosis of tuberculosis, were the presence of longer history, lymphadenopathy, firm hepatosplenomegaly, miliary shadows on chest radiograph and raised alkaline phosphatase (suggesting granulomatous hepatitis). An elevated alkaline phosphatase is a useful clue and has been reported in up to 83% of patients with miliary TB [13].

The overall high mortality in this study for ARDS is because of obvious differences in case mix, delays in transfer of critically ill patients from emergency room to ICU because of limited availability of beds, possible selection bias as sickest patients with multiple organ failure are admitted in the ICU and other logistic reasons [15]. The probable reason for better outcome of tuberculous ARDS in this study could be that the diagnosis was suspected clinically, and anti-tubercular therapy was instituted empirically (median time to initiation being 3 days) based on clinical diagnosis. This can also account for the shorter duration of mechanical ventilation in our patients. Also delayed treatment is known to contribute to mortality in ICU patients with pulmonary TB and acute respiratory failure [5]. However, this conclusion has limitations in that we cannot exclude the possibility that the decreased mortality is due to a selection bias. Also the retrospective design of the study and small numbers makes it difficult to draw any firm conclusion. But our study does suggest that early clinical diagnosis and empiric therapy can improve the outcome of an uncommon but treatable cause of ARDS. In contrast to reports of patients with miliary TB being treated with antituberculous drugs and glucocorticoids, none of our patients received steroids.",
