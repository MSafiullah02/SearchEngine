In China, influenza surveillance protocols and technical guidance have been updated in line with new emerging virus subtypes and new detection methods. The major revision in 2009 and 2010 was to include influenza A (H1N1)pdm09 virus infection in the case definition, and updating in 2017 focused on the use of fast detection methods. Our study showed that the new update of the influenza surveillance protocol in 2017 was related to a 65.6% increase in the influenza incidence risk (95% CI = 1.097\u20132.496) compared to the protocol used in 2005 to 2008. Moreover, the number of sentinel hospitals for ILI reporting increased from 193 in 2005 to 554 in all provinces in 200933,34,41. As CNIDRS includes all sentinel hospitals, sentinel hospitals are likely to report more cases of influenza to CNIDRS. In addition, more hospitals have used electronic health information systems, which may improve both the quantity and quality of data collection and exchange from hospitals to CNIDRS46\u201349.",

Different patterns of influenza between the north and south in China were well reported3,16,20,34,41,59. In China, the line following the Qinling Mountain range in the west and the Huaihe River in the east is often used to split the mainland into the north and the south34. In this study, we observed clustering in both the north and the south in the middle part of China. The unique structured spatial patterns may be attributed to the shared risk factors among the neighbouring areas. This may be associated with similarities in the climatic zone, the predominant subtype of the virus at the time of epidemics, socioeconomic background or lifestyles. The last important factor should not be ignored. Some studies reported that clustering of diseases may be a consequence of spatial heterogeneity in surveillance efforts60,61.",

Correspondently, we found more areas with high relative risk in these 4 years in the space-time term. This implies that the more sporadic the activities are, the larger the variations in the spatiotemporal distribution of the risk of influenza. In contrast, the large outbreaks account for most ILI activities in the years 2009, 2010, 2017 and 2018. Few prefectures were observed to have a relative risk greater than 2 or 3 during that period.

Then, this study also provided a baseline model that can be extended to include social, economic, ecological, and environmental factors, as well as intervention measures to explore their associations with influenza.

We observed an increased incidence trend of influenza from 2005 to 2018 that was fairly steady in the first 4 years and increased rapidly in the last 3 years. Clusters of prefectures with high relative risk values concerning influenza incidence were identified in the central part of China. The identification of high-risk areas is especially a priority in China because the limited resources available for disease control need to be focused on the places most in need. We hypothesize that the insufficient flu vaccine supplements, low vaccine uptake, the newly emerging influenza A (H1N1)pdm09 and expansion of influenza surveillance efforts might be the major causes of the dramatic changes in outbreak and spatiotemporal epidemic patterns. Future research with more risk factors at the national and local levels is necessary to explain the changing spatiotemporal patterns of influenza in China.",
