The lung's initial response to injury, referred to as the exudative/initial phase of ARDS, is characterized by increased permeability, rapid interstitial and alveolar edema, alveolar flooding by a protein\u2010rich fluid, and gradual refractory hypoxemia. Type II cells of the alveolar epithelium are also injured, which eventually leads to disruption of epithelium integrity, attenuation of surfactant production, and inhibition of the epithelial repair process. Moreover, neutrophils activation and microthrombi formation in the lung potentiate the inflammatory response. A fibroproliferative phase, driven by the proinflammatory cytokine, is characterized by more refractory hypoxemia and architectural changes. In this phase, alveolar edema subsides, alveolar spaces are filled with neutrophils and macrophages, and the alveolar epithelium is repopulated by type II cells. Finally, chronic inflammation, neovascularization, and a fibroproliferative process take place, as acknowledged by the deposition of extracellular matrix.9 The repair processes initiated during the fibroproliferative phase of ARDS are essential for host survival. Once epithelial integrity has been reestablished, reabsorption of alveolar edema and the provisional matrix restores alveolar architecture and function. Neutrophil\u2010mediated inflammation is also reversed, most probably due to apoptosis. The final or fibrotic phase of ARDS does not occur in all patients but has been linked to prolonged mechanical ventilation and increased mortality.",

First, young and healthy animals are mainly used in preclinical studies, while the majority of ARDS patients are of old age. The severity and character of ARDS in mice are age\u2010dependent. In old\u2010age mice, the inflammatory response is impaired, with decreased adaptive immunity that further leads to worsening of ARDS.43 Therefore, using aged animals rather than young could improve the clinical significance of animal models of ARDS. Second, rodents, particularly mice, are chronically cold\u2010stressed when housed in a laboratory/animal center at 20\u201322\u00b0C, suggesting that appropriate physiological conditions for housing laboratory mice might help to get better preclinical findings.44 Third, compounds are mainly administered prior to the onset of ARDS in the experimental setup, while clinical diagnosis and treatments are delayed in the case of ARDS patients. Thereby, for proper justification of outcomes, the compound should be tested prior as well as after the onset of ARDS. Fourth, animals, such as rats, mice, and baboons, are surprisingly less sensitive to the toxic effects of LPS than humans.45 This obvious inconsistency in LPS sensitivity seems to be one of the key factors that may lead to inappropriate and inconsistent outcomes. Fifth, fundamental differences are exhibited in the physiology, anatomy, size, and species of the animals (both rodents and primates) and humans. Primates and pigs are more closely related to human as compared to mice because many aspects of immunological function in humans and pigs are alike. For instance, circulating white blood cells in humans and pigs are primarily polymorphonuclear leukocytes, but not in mice, and interleukin (IL)\u20108 has a direct ortholog in pigs but not in mice. Moreover, large quantities of NO\u00b7 is produced by murine macrophages after LPS stimulation, whereas neither porcine nor human macrophages counter the LPS in such a way.46\n",
