It can be obtained from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) at 1-404-639-2889. Dose and frequency of antitoxin administration depends on the clinical presentation. The American Academy of Pediatrics has suggested 20,000\u201340,000 units for pharyngeal or laryngeal disease <48 h duration, 40,000\u201360,000 units for nasopharyngeal disease, and 80,000 to 120,000 units for diffuse neck swelling or extensive disease of \u22653 days duration [23]. Antibiotics stop toxin production, eradicates the infection, and reduces transmission. Recommended antibiotics include erythromycin (oral or intravenous) or penicillin G (intravenous or intramuscular) for 14 days. Repeat cultures should be obtained at 24 h intervals after completing antibiotics to confirm elimination of the organism from two consecutive negative cultures.
