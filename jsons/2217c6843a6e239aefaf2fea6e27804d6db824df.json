We have visited about 50 treatment centers and agree (see photos of the art studio, If leaders of substance use treatment programs that work with at-risk children and families have often seen themselves at cross-purposes with child welfare and criminal justice agencies, there is growing evidence of greater cooperation.

Finally, the government covers the FQHC in the Tort Claims Act. \"We don't have to buy malpractice insurance for our providers,\" said Grisafi, noting that this cost is very high for OB-GYN.
