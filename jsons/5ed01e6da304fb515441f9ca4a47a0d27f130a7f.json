The etiological agent causing the outbreaks was found to be a new virus, named Ebola virus. The Ebola virus, together with Marburg virus, a virus of African geographic origin which had been recognized less than 10 years earlier (Martini and Siegert 1971) , were subsequently defined as the prototype viruses of a new taxonomic family, Filoviridae (Kiley et al. 1982) . This name reflects the very unusual morphology of virions observed by electron microscopy, that of a thread or filament (Latin: filum ; thread). The Filoviridae virus family belongs to the order of Mononegavirales characterized by genetic material carried by only one thread of RNA with negative polarity.",

This included the search and identification of possible hosts, their characterization as intermediate, incidental and/or amplifying hosts or reservoirs, and finally the search for one or more potential vectors (Monath 1999; Feldmann et al. 2004 ). This chapter describes the elements of the viral transmission chain, which was described recently after an absence of epidemic activity of Ebola fever for more than 20 years in the specific locales studied. The findings implicate several animal species as playing a central role in the natural maintenance cycle of Ebola virus and in the pathway leading to viral emergence among humans. This pathway involves viral propagation and amplification within the reservoir host and subsequent transmission to intermediate or incidental host(s) capable of sustaining a high incidence of infection accompanied by a high viremia.",

            "text": "Although a few animal species in Central Africa have been identified with low titers of antibody reactive with Ebola virus antigens, it is only recently that conclusive evidence of active infection with Ebola virus in any wildlife species has been obtained (Table 1 ) . Technological advances in viral diagnostic methods (ELISA, antigen captures, PCR, immunohistochemical labeling of Ebola virus antigens in specific tissues) have made it possible for recent surveys to employ highly sensitive and specific tools to screen for potential reservoir species for zoonotic viruses in ways unavailable to prior investigators (see the chapter by Daniels et al., this volume) . Molecular biological methods also permit phylogenetic reconstruction of ancestral viral lineages using sequence data obtained from multiple viral strains isolated at different times; investigators can characterize viruses without isolating each strain and produce models of potential transmission pathways and direction (see the chapter by Holmes and Drummond, this volume). Additionally, prior surveys were conducted during interepidemic phases when there was little or no evidence of Ebola virus activity. During the epidemic outbreaks of Ebola virus occurring between 2001 and 2004 in Gabon and the Republic of Congo, many dead animals were found in the tropical forest areas affected by the epidemic (Leroy et al. 2004 ). During the 2001-2004 epidemic, 44 carcasses of wild animals were discovered, permitting necropsies to be performed and tissue samples to be collected; samples were transported and analyzed at the high-security laboratory of the Medical Research Centre of Franceville (CIRMF), in Gabon. Sixteen animals (12 gorillas, three chimpanzees, and a Leroy, personal communication) , demonstrating natural infection and mortality caused by Ebola virus among three species of wildlife. Calculations of relative population size, based on indices of animal presence and abundance in specific locales (excrement, tracks, broken vegetation, nests, etc.) , revealed a significant rise in mortality (decline in population size) among certain animal species immediately before and during epidemics of human disease. The populations of gorillas and duikers fell by half between 2002 and 2003 in the Lossi sanctuary (320 km 2 ), Republic of Congo, and the estimated population size of chimpanzees fell by 88%. Even if these results are approximations (since it is known, for example, that the disappearance of a dominating adult male gorilla causes the break-up of the group and that the dispersed individuals are then difficult to count), they suggested that localized epidemics of Ebola virus can cause significant mortality among certain wildlife species in a very short period of time (Fig. 1 ) . These results complement observations obtained from other studies indicating that significant reductions in populations of gorillas and chimpanzees in the areas of Gabon occur coincidentally with Ebola epidemics affecting humans Walsh et al. 2003) . A previous study conducted in the Ta\u00ef forest of the Ivory Coast indicated that 11 members of a group of 43 chimpanzees disappeared (a reduction of 26% of the group) during November 1994 when Ebola virus was affecting humans (Formenty et al. 1999) .",

The results suggested that chimpanzees are in regular contact with the Ebola virus reservoir(s) or infectious virus released into their environment and that some individuals experience nonlethal infections. Furthermore, these data indicate that infection by Ebola virus is ongoing among wildlife during quiescent phases of epidemic disease A B C D Fig. 1 Victims of the Ebola virus. Carcasses of nonhuman primates infected by Ebola virus discovered in the forest of Gabon and the Republic of Congo. Genetic sequences of the virus were detected in bone tissues (a cranium of chimpanzee found approximately 3 weeks after its death), in the skin or the muscle (b hand of gorilla found 2 weeks after death of the animal), and in the liver and the spleen (corpse of dead chimpanzee 3-4 days before harvest) in humans; Ebola virus may have been enzootic in the forested regions of central Africa for an extended period of time. The presence of anti-Ebola-specific antibodies in other primate species, including five drills ( Papio leucophaeus ), a Western baboon ( Papio papio ), a mandrill ( Papio sphinx ), and a Cercopithecus sp., suggests that the circulation of the virus could be much more complex than the simple passage from reservoir to gorillas and chimpanzees. It has been hypothesized that several reservoir species for Ebola virus may exist and epidemiological and virological findings indicate that direct contact with incidentally infected intermediate hosts, such as gorillas and chimpanzees, can lead to sporadic cases and outbreaks of Ebola fever among humans. Additionally, molecular biological data indicate that genetically diverse strains of Ebola virus circulate in nature and can cause fatal disease among wildlife and humans; the potential existence of Ebola virus variants of reduced virulence offers an attractive hypothesis to explain the existence of anti-Ebola specific antibodies among primates.",

Although the dogs failed to develop any visible clinical signs of disease (Allela et al. 2005 ), a study undertaken in Gabon after the 2001-2002 epidemics identified anti-Ebola IgG antibodies among dogs; the prevalence of antibodies increased significantly with the proximity of the sample site to the epidemic focus . The prevalence of antibodies to Ebola virus in dogs ranged from 9% in the two largest cities in Gabon, to 15% in the largest town of the epidemic zone, to 25% in rural villages without identifiable human cases, and reached 32% in villages with human Ebola cases directly linked to contact with an infected animal source (Allela et al. 2005) .

Clarifying the individual contribution of incidental hosts in a transmission chain leading to human disease or to a maintenance cycle of different virus variants remains an important, but challenging, endeavor (Fig. 2 ).",

However, analyses carried out on specimens taken from 242 mammals (24 bats, 163 rodents, and 56 insectivorous shrews) captured in the Central African Republic (RCA) in 1998 identified partial Ebola virus genetic sequences in six mice ( Mus setulosus and Praomys sp.) and a shrew ( Sylvisorex ollula ) (Morvan et al. 1999) . The absence of a specific serological response, together with the absence of amplifiable total viral sequences, the failure to isolate virus, the nonreproducibility of the results, and the absence of epidemiologic indices favoring the potential role of these animals in Ebola virus epidemics, meant that it was not possible to confirm that these animals were reservoirs of Ebola virus.",

Additionally, previous studies have documented that a transitory viremia occurs in certain bat species following experimental infection with the Ebola virus Bergman 1999; Swanepoel et al. 1996) .

Photographs of the three species of bats that are potential hosts of Ebola virus: Hypsignathus monstrosus (hammer-headed fruit bat), Epomops franqueti (singing fruit bat), and Myonycteris torquata (little collared fruit bat). These bats are found in the forested areas of central Africa. They have been recorded from Senegal to northern Angola and prefer riverine forests, swamps, mangroves, and palm forests. They play an important role as pollinators of flowers and in dispersing seeds. Their diet consists of fruits, leaves, flowers, nectar, and pollen. H. montrosus is the largest bat found in Africa, with males, whose heads are greatly enlarged, significantly larger than females. These three species are nocturnal, roosting during the day in groups of five to 20 A C B It is interesting to note that megachiropteran fruit bats are also reservoirs of Hendra (Halpin et al. 2000) and Nipah (Yob et al. 2001 ) viruses of the Paramyxoviridae family, and Microchiroptera bats are the probable ancestors of all rabies virus variants, serotype 1/genotype 1 of the genus Lyssavirus in the family Rhabdoviridae, now infecting terrestrial mammals (Badrane and Tordo 2001; Amengal et al. 1997) .

This photograph illustrates the large number of contacts that can occur between the large primates and the bats gathered around the same tree to consume the fruits to a limited number of fruit-bearing trees can lead to spatiotemporal clustering of diverse species of frugivorous animals, such as bats, nonhuman primates, and terrestrial species foraging on fallen or partially eaten fruits or spats. These dense aggregates of different species would increase the probability of contact between infected and susceptible individuals of both reservoir and secondary host species, and promote virus transmission (see the chapter by Real and Biek, this volume). The dry season aggregation of reservoir host species involved in natural maintenance cycles, augmented by incidentally infected secondary hosts serving as sources for intra-and interspecific transmission chains independent of repeated spillover from the reservoir host (see the chapter by Childs et al., this volume), provides an ecological setting for amplifying enzootic transmission of Ebola virus in a manner analogous to draught-induced amplification of enzootic Saint Louis encephalitis virus (SLEV), whereby arthropod vectors and vertebrate hosts are concentrated around a diminished number of water sources (Shaman et al. 2002) .",

Various Pteropus spp. have been shown to be the reservoir hosts of Hendra and Nipah viruses, two novel viruses comprising the newly defined Henipavirus genus in the family Paramyxoviridae , which have caused severe disease among humans. Initially, Hendra and Nipah virus spillover was from the bat reservoir host to domestic livestock, horses and pigs, respectively, which served as the first secondary host in the transmission chain leading to human infection and disease (see the chapters by Childs et al. and Field et al., this volume) . It was only after virus amplification and excretion via the respiratory route from infected livestock that human cases developed (see the chapter by Daniels et al., this volume), although Nipah virus transmission in Bangladesh appears to involve direct human infection from the bat reservoir host or from fruit contaminated by virus followed by human-to-human transmission (see the chapter by Field et al., this volume). In 2005, microchiropteran bats were identified as a reservoir host of the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) coronavirus in Asia (Li et al. 2005) . Of special note is the consistent association of bats with viruses containing negative-sense single-stranded RNA and belonging to the order Mononegavirales, lyssaviruses in the family Rhabdoviridae , henipaviruses viruses in the family Paramyxoviridae , and Ebola virus subtype Zaire in the family Filoviridae.",

Of particular note is why it has taken more than 20 years to begin to understand the natural transmission cycles of Ebola virus, and why more than 30 years after the first epidemic of Marburg fever in Germany and Yugoslavia, does the animal reservoir for Marburg virus remain unknown? Several factors have hindered the pursuit of the elusive reservoir host for the filoviruses. Epidemics or sporadic cases of filovirus disease have most often occurred in remote locations in countries experiencing varying levels of social upheaval resulting from ongoing armed conflicts or the transient chaos that accompanies disease outbreaks of high mortality linked to hospital-associated transmission. Even at the best of times, the medical and public health infrastructure within central African nations is limited. Animal surveys initiated as a result of investigations into human epidemics have been opportunistic and have not been undertaken at the optimum place or time. Often the identification of a filovirus as the cause of a specific disease outbreak is delayed. Delay results in uncertainty when identifying the index case and, at best, complicates collection of a verbal patient history from surviving relatives or associates. Most animal surveys have biased collection over-representing terrestrial mammals as these species are accessible to trapping and can be purchased as bushmeat. Adequate sampling of bat species has mostly been limited to insectivorous microchiropterans (Liers et al. 1999) , as obtaining bats feeding on fruits in the high canopy of trees within dense rainforests is difficult. Animal surveys conducted over short intervals during a single season will most often fail to sample species during critical time periods, such as at the end of the dry season, or when species may be physiologically and immunologically prone to virus infection or excretion, such as during mating and parturition. Finally, as previously mentioned, many surveys relied on technology for viral detection that was vastly inferior to the methods currently available, raising concerns about the reliability of diagnostic procedures of drastically reduced sensitivity.",

Megachiropteran fruit bats can interact and expose other species to excreted Ebola virus through direct contact, such as inoculating virus present in saliva through bites, or indirect routes, as when discarding partially eaten fruit or spats contaminated with infectious virus. However, once spillover of Ebola virus has been achieved in an initial secondary host species, the emergence of human disease and an epidemic of Ebola hemorrhagic fever may require additional mediating events. If the initial secondary host is human, then a single spillover event may be sufficient to cause human disease, if the Ebola strain is virulent in that host, and the single diseased human may be sufficient to initiate an epidemic, if that individual is treated at a hospital and infects health providers. However, if the initial secondary case is a nonhuman primate or a duiker, then further multiplication of virus, either through repetitive spillover events or sustained transmission within the secondary host population (see the chapter by Childs et al., this volume), may be necessary to amplify the number of infected individuals within that host population such that a susceptible human contacts an infectious primate.
