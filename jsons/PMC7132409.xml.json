Although the Dutch inventor of the microscope, Antoni van Leeuwenhoek, had discovered microbes around 1675, and the visionary scholar Girolamo Frascoro had postulated seminaria (small seeds or \u201cgerms\u201d) as causes of communicable diseases already in 1546, the microbial discoveries of Pasteur and Koch were needed to establish the microbial pathogenesis of infectious diseases. Dutch scientists, especially those of the \u201cDelft school\u201d (Beijerinck, Kluyver, Van Niel), delivered important contributions in the early days of microbiology, i.e. during the end of the 19th century and the first decades of the 20th century [1]. In fact, it was Martinus Beijerinck who introduced the term \u201cvirus\u201d in 1898, for the filterable agent infecting tobacco plants, which he called \u2018contagium vivum fluidum\u2019 and which is now is known as tobacco mosaic virus [2].",

Although separating this area of immunological research from other areas is artificial, we had to be rather strict in our selection, i.e., to be included in this overview, research had to deal with both host and pathogen for a paper to be included. To develop the lists of major contributions to immunological progress (depicted in Table 1, Table 2, Table 3, Table 4\n), we had several brainstorms, interviews, and performed searches in PubMed. This led to a long list of Dutch scientists that were felt to have significantly contributed to the understanding of the immunology of infection, thereby focussing on research that was also performed in The Netherlands. Our next step was to contact these people and ask them to provide us with no more than 3 of their most contributory publications. With this information, using the premises formulated above, we were able to construct the tables below. We chose not to go for a bibliometric approach for a number of reasons. First of all, the bibliometrics in this field appears to be flawed by rather arbitrary listing in one of the following fields: immunology, microbiology, infectious diseases, public health, and medicine. Secondly, the real impact of articles is often difficult to assess. A certain idea or concept may not be readily taken up, or even may be captured by others. Also the publication habits have profoundly changed over the past decades.",

They facilitated the work of Goudsmit, Miedema, Lange and Schuitemaker, as described in Table 1. The effects of antigenic variation, the non-protective antibody responses and the dynamics of the T cell compartment were described by these investigators [4], [5], [6], [7], [8], [9], [10], [11], [12]. Other important contributions have been made at the level of receptors that mediate HIV transmission to either dendritic cells (DCs) or T cells [13], [14], [15].",

This work ranges from the cellular and molecular mechanisms that drive protective anti-viral immunity [16], [17], [18], [19], [20], [21], to the development of human antibodies with broadly neutralizing capacity against the virus [22], [23]. Investigation into the cellular anti-viral response encompassed the polyclonality of the responding T cell pool, the role of T cell co-stimulation and the formation of memory T cells, but also the involvement of innate immune cells their contribution to pathology [16], [18], [19], [20], [24]. Moreover, it has been shown that the inhibitory receptor CD200R plays an important role in diminishing immune pathology during influenza [25], [26]. Many approaches to study the immune response to influenza relied on the mouse as experimental model [16], [19], [21], [24], [25], [26], but several groups have also been able to perform their analysis on human cells and tissues [17], [18], [27].",

Identification of several specific strategies of EBV has provided insight into the molecular details on how this virus is able to evade the immune system and establish latency [32], [33], [34], [35]. Moreover, important contributions have also been made at the level of persistent infection with human papillomavirus (HPV), which is key for the development of cervical cancer: human T cell epitopes from HPV have been identified and shown to be effective in peptide vaccination to HPV [36], [37], [38], which can subsequently induce remission of HPV-induced cervical lesions in patients [39], [40]. This has resulted in the decision of the Dutch government in 2010 to add HPV-vaccination for 12-year-old girls to the existing national immunization program.",

The elucidation of the defect in these patients, specifically with the autosomal dominant form, would take until 2011, with the discovery that mutations of the STAT1 gene are responsible for a large proportion of these patients [103]. The defective subsequent production of interferons, IL-17, IL-23, leading to insufficient neutrophil activation and defensin production are considered to lead to the susceptibility to the fungal pathogens. In depth analysis of the fungicidal capacity of human neutrophils revealed that these cells can use two distinct and independent phagolysosomal mechanisms to kill C. albicans, being either reactive oxygen species-dependent when mediated by Fc\u03b3 receptors or reactive-oxygen species independent when mediated through complement receptor 3 and CARD-9 [104]. A thoroughly studied topic is that of recognition of Candida species by host cells. A series of molecular patterns on the surface of the fungus was identified as ligands for an array of pattern-recognition receptors [105], [106]. On the other hand, the tetraspanin CD37 was found to inhibit IgA responses to Candida and thereby able to regulate the anti-fungal immune response [107]. In 2012, a new paradigm, \u2018trained immunity\u2019 was put forward by Netea's group, based on the observation that beta-glucan derived from Candida (and muramyl dipeptide from BCG) is able to enhance the innate immune effector function through epigenetic reprogramming of monocytes and macrophages [108].",

Other Dutch research on malaria dealt with the technology to genetically modify and attenuate malaria parasites, in order to use these for immunization [115], [116], [117]. Another major advance in malaria research was obtained in the experimental malaria studies in human volunteers. Using this set up, pre-erythrocytic immunity was obtained by inoculating the volunteers with live P. falciparum sporozoites under chloroquine treatment, and the investigators were able to demonstrate long-lasting protection against a malaria challenge [118], [119].",
