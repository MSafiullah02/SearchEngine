The present study was designed to be highly discriminating. We used 364 male rats of the (E3 \u00d7 DA)DA backcross and analyzed arthritis onset and severity as well as antibody levels, RF production, and acute\u2010phase response. Since this has also been done in E3 \u00d7 DA crosses after injection with pristane (10, 16, 17, 18), a careful comparison between these arthritis models could be made. In the CIA linkage experiment, we were able to identify all published PIA loci except for those related strictly to female inheritance (Pia2 and Pia8) and to chronicity (Pia5 and Pia6), since the analysis was performed on male rats during the acute phase of arthritis. However, the relative contribution of the various loci to the traits we examined differed, and we found additional loci associated with arthritis and anti\u2010CII antibody production, reflecting the divergent pathogeneses of these diseases.",

Therefore, the major difference between PIA and CIA is the use of CII in the immunization emulsion in CIA. CIA and PIA are clinically very similar, aside from the fact that CIA affects the phalangeal joints more profoundly than does PIA and that relapses are more prominent during chronic disease in PIA. PIA is a T cell\u2013dependent disease, although the specificity of the autoimmune reaction is unknown (10). CIA is more complex, having the added influence of B cells due to the in vivo affinity of CII\u2010specific antibodies for cartilage (34). Since CIA shares T cell dependence with PIA but has the additional antibody\u2010dependent mechanism, it is expected that CIA would share some genetic linkages with PIA as well as demonstrate some specific genetic regulation. Loci identified in both CIA and PIA may therefore reflect genes involved in regulating the T cell response caused by the injection of adjuvant, while the CIA\u2010specific QTLs may be involved in the more antigen\u2010specific response directed against CII.",

These findings suggest that these loci harbor genes that control the general inflammatory response elicited by the adjuvant. The antibody QTLs in CIA found on chromosomes 20 and 14 are equivalent to Ciaa1/Pia1 and Ciaa7/Pia6, respectively. Both Pia1 and Pia6 are loci that regulate chronic arthritis. Hence, the identification of these loci with the use of anti\u2010CII antibodies or RFs in CIA possibly reflects an antibody\u2010regulated phase, which is observed in the chronic phase of PIA. In CIA, an immune response to joint\u2010specific antigen (CII) is triggered soon after immunization, which possibly accounts for the involvement of these loci in acute disease. However, in PIA, where both Pia1 and Pia6 play a role strictly during the chronic phase of disease, these loci may be triggered only after exposure of cartilage protein to the immune system and breakage of immune tolerance due to the ongoing joint erosion and inflammation.",

This locus also showed a strong effect on disease, since the E3 allele of this locus conferred 90% protection against arthritis severity in PIA (Figure 3). Recently, the Cia12/Pia4 QTL was found to confer structural polymorphism in the Ncf1 gene (35). The effect of this genetic variation resulted in differential production of free radicals by the NADPH oxidase complex (36). We hypothesized that the production of oxygen radicals by the antigen\u2010presenting cells reduces the priming of autoreactive T cells. We found that in CIA, the effect of the Cia12/Pia4 locus was less potent, while Cia13/Pia7 had the greatest effect on clinical arthritis. The different effects of these 2 loci were clarified in isolated congenic strains of both DA and E3 backgrounds (Figures 4 and 5), where it was clear that the Cia13/Pia7 locus was of greatest importance in the regulation of CIA. This result is highly significant, since it suggests that the Cia13/Pia7 locus on chromosome 4 represents genes that are involved in the processing/presentation of, and response to, joint antigens. Furthermore, we showed the usefulness of different disease\u2010reflecting phenotypes, such as COMP and \u03b11\u2010acid glycoprotein, in characterizing and evaluating the impact of QTLs, both in linkage studies and in studies of congenic strains.",

For example, both oil\u2010induced arthritis and squalene\u2010induced arthritis are regulated by a QTL on rat chromosome 10, which was successfully isolated in a congenic strain (37). Interestingly, Oia2, the locus corresponding to Cia13/Pia7, was also recently isolated and characterized in a congenic strain in which the disease\u2010protective chromosome 4 allele from PVG rats was transferred to the DA background. This congenic strain also showed significant protection against PIA, CIA, squalene\u2010induced arthritis, and adjuvant\u2010induced arthritis (38). Thus, it is plausible that the Cia13, Oia2, and Pia7 loci share a gene in E3 and PVG rats that also confers disease protection in the DA strain. Moreover, Mycobacterium\nbutyricum adjuvant\u2013induced arthritis has been found to be regulated by previously identified and isolated CIA loci, such as Cia5 (Aia5) (39). These findings stress the importance of using several models to study the regulation of arthritis by the QTLs of interest, since information concerning the function of the underlying genes may be identified. This would be especially important in studies of arthritis in rats, in which both antigen\u2010induced and adjuvant\u2010induced disease (PIA or oil\u2010induced arthritis) can be investigated (40).",

The majority are involved in T cell regulation induced by the adjuvant, with or without the addition of cartilage\u2010specific proteins; however, loci that regulate the B cell response (observed as antibody production) are also involved. Thus, it is possible that our results can be extended to all rat models of arthritis. It is therefore important that the arthritis\u2010regulating genes be identified and evaluated in as many rat models of arthritis as possible. The information gathered from such genetic analyses in rats will eventually help unravel the pathways involved in human RA and may provide novel therapeutic targets for the treatment of autoimmune disease.",
