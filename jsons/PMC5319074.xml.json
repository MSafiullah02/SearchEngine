The interview guide included collection of background information on the eligible study\u2019s design and methodology, followed by a detailed exploration of domains of inquiry related to retention strategies. Interviews were conducted in-person or by phone by two research assistants (MA, MC), who received training on the interview guide and data collection practices prior to initiation of the study. Interview questions were provided, upon request, via an online survey before the interviews to help the interviewee gather necessary information. Two study coordinators initially responded via the online survey (Active Surveillance of Prostate Cancer, and the Longitudinal Study of Alzheimer's Disease and Other Memory Disorders), then completed the remainder of interview by phone. Prior to the interviews, the research assistants performed an online search for any study-related publications and websites that provided information on the study aims, longitudinal research visits, retention strategies and retention rates to help focus the interview. In addition, study teams were asked to provide any additional study publications or written protocols that specifically outlined retention strategies. The team of investigators reviewed the data from each interview to explore emerging common findings. According to established qualitative research methods [10], the interview guide was iteratively refined and adapted to ask subsequent study participants about additional strategies that emerged in initial interviews. Then, the data was reviewed and independently coded by four investigators (MAA, MC, MNE, CDH), using a priori themes established in prior systematic reviews (Table 1) [4, 5]. After 19 interviews, data saturation was reached. A final review of the data was performed to synthesize overarching findings from the interviews.\n",

Two of these studies employed a full-time staff member dedicated to implementing retention strategies and focused on optimizing participant follow up. Five of 11 studies allocated a specific number of participants to one team member who served as the study\u2019s primary point of contact for that group of participants. This person was given strategic support at team meetings, which included adapting or developing new approaches to overcome retention barriers when standard methods of contacting a participant had been exhausted. Other features of these successful teams included selecting appropriate individuals with responsibility for participant contact and providing intensive training and support on study protocols, including retention techniques. In recruiting research staff for cohort retention activities, study teams often screened applicants for experience, communication skills, cultural-competence and specialized knowledge of the population (e.g. Spanish-speaking, domestic violence advocate). One research team provided training focused on providing staff with a common understanding of empathy and sensitivity, including mock interviews to prepare new staff prior to contacting participants on their own [13, 17\u201319].",

Detailed records were kept for the participant and at least one additional contact person. These records were updated at every participant contact. Study staff used phone numbers, email, texting, social media (e.g., Facebook) and internet searches to locate participants. Studies visited participants\u2019 homes, used personal delivery of reminders and searched obituaries, court documents and incarceration records to locate participants.

Recognizing this pattern after the initial interviews, we added interview questions to explore the lack of written protocols to delineate retention strategies. Interviews revealed that existing study protocols were not detailed regarding techniques to locate and retain participants or were out of date. Since strategies were frequently adapted to reflect new or revised retention strategies tailored to individual participant\u2019s circumstances, with many of the changes verbally discussed during team meetings, revised retention strategies were noted but not updated in the actual protocol. Notably, principal investigators (PIs) and study coordinators agreed that IRB review and approval is an important process and that they developed study protocols recognizing IRB and ethical issues. In some studies, retention protocols submitted to the IRB included general principles for follow-up, rather than a detailed protocol, due to concern that a detailed protocol would require frequent IRB submissions with amendments and not be practicable to implement. Moreover, there were conflicting perceptions regarding whether or not the IRB would be supportive of cohort retention approaches that include internet or social media searches and persistence when trying to locate hard-to-find participants.",

This heterogeneity allowed for exploration of a variety of approaches to cohort retention strategies and confirmed the 12 categories of retention strategies previously established. However, this study does provide further insight through the thematic analysis of in-depth interviews. These studies had research staff members who are specialized, persistent and collaborate well to accomplish their retention goals teams. They utilized personalized approaches and tailored retention strategies specific to participants in the study cohorts. This tailoring of strategies that are not formally documented in written form is an iterative process based largely on the experience and persistence of study coordinators. Cultural acceptability and feasibility of study and retention practices was evaluated by the expertise and experience of the study staff. This tailoring was facilitated by an understanding of social, cultural and environmental norms particular to the population studied.",

            "text": "Previous systematic reviews identified over 900 retention strategies across 88 studies, with higher retention attained in studies using more retention strategies [4, 5]. The present study suggests the importance of having a well-functioning research team that is organized, persistent, adaptable, and innovative. Prior studies focused on financial incentives to recruit and retain participants, finding a positive correlation between magnitude of incentive and retention rates [4, 5]. In our study, the use of financial incentives varied, yet all studies had high rates of retention, suggesting that participants also respond to additional strategies, such as facilitating visits and emphasizing other potential benefits of participating in the study. The in-depth interviews from this study confirm prior empirical analyses that demonstrated that achieving high retention rates requires use of multiple retention strategies and often many contact attempts by highly skilled staff [4, 22]. However, it is not clear which strategies are the most effective for study teams with limited budgets to implement. Though budget allocation for retention-specific activities was not assessed, most of these high retention studies were federally funded and adequately resourced; 15 of 19 studies had personnel that were trained and specialized, contributing to the high retention. Future studies should conduct comparative effectiveness evaluations regarding different budget allocations for retention to inform financial budget planning and prioritization among potential retention strategies.",

Moreover, the most successful study teams iteratively refined their retention processes in practice without updating protocols, and individualized them to specific participants. Maintaining updated retention protocols may be valuable for staff training and for maintaining high retention rates throughout the study, especially in the event of staff turnover. In addition, social media is in constant evolution and investigators should consider using technologies available to provide high quality longitudinal data. A recent article examined feasibility of using websites and social media for recruitment and demonstrated that a young female urban population is more likely to respond to these methods than traditional methods such as flyers and health fairs [23]. These recruitment strategies also use a small amount of study team resources, however it is unclear if this would be true for the purposes of retention.",

The question of appropriate methods and frequency for contact attempts is an important area for further exploration and may have variation in acceptability depending on the population.

In addition, ethical regulation and oversight of studies has great variation within large academic centers, between institutions, and globally. In addition, IRB policies continue to evolve, particularly in response to new strategies such as digital and social media-based approaches for participant contact.

This study\u2019s strength is the novelty of using in-depth interviews to obtain unpublished data from research teams to explore successful retention strategies for following large cohorts for at least one year. Moreover, a heterogeneous mix of high retention studies were included, with varying cohort sizes (205\u20132528 participants) and types of study population, including a national cohort study (ARDS Network Long Term Outcome Study \u2013 ALTOS) that enrolled over 900 acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) survivors from more than 40 sites [17, 19]. However, this study also has potential limitations. First, only studies with \u2265200 participants and retention rates \u226580% were considered; thereby, potentially limiting the comprehensiveness and generalizability of the data collected. However, all retention strategies from a prior systematic review [4] were exemplified through the interviews, offering some replication of findings. Future studies may examine how studies with low retention have used retention strategies and if practical resources can support study teams to improve retention rates. Also, in this study a convenience sample of studies were screened for eligibility from only one institution; hence additional retention strategies may be uncovered if conducted with a larger number of studies from other research centers. Social, cultural and regulatory body acceptance of the retention strategies described may vary by institution and internationally. As these retention strategies are used outside of the US, additional cultural tailoring of retention strategies may be required and should be studied empirically. Finally, the design of our study allowed us to identify strategies that were used together with a high degree of success. However, since these research teams applied multiple strategies we were not able to identify which individual strategies were superior. Given our insights regarding the need to tailor strategies to the context of the target population and other study factors, it is possible that each strategy identified could be implemented and yet retention goals still may not be met in a given study. To move the science of cohort retention forward, studies that compare retention strategies to identify best practices are needed.",
