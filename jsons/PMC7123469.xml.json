            "text": "Teschovirus is also known by several other names including Teschen disease, Talfan disease, poliomyelitis suum, benign enzootic paresis, Klobauk disease and contagious porcine paralysis. Teschovirus-induced encephalitis in pigs was first narrated as Teschen disease, a virulent extremely lethal polioencephalomyelitis with high mortality, in the township of Teschen in the Czech Republic over 90 years ago, in 1929 (Trefny 1930). Porcine Teschovirus (PTV) is detected ubiquitously in the pig population worldwide (Knowles 2015). While the majority of infections are subclinical, there are several clinical conditions which affect different body systems, including nervous (polioencephalomyelitis), reproductive, enteric, respiratory and integumentary. From 1929 to 1950s, severe PTV outbreaks have been reported in European and neighbouring countries (Knowles 2015). Afterwards, the disease became very rare and disappeared from Western Europe. Lately, two fresh PTV outbreaks occurred in 2009 in Haiti and subsequently in 2011 in Canada (Deng et al. 2012; Salles et al. 2011). To date, 13 different types of PTV are noted, and additional types of PTV-14\u201322 proposed, circulating throughout the world (Knowles 2015). Different PTV types are associated with a variety of clinical symptoms in their natural hosts (pig and wild boar). PTV-1 is considered as one of the most virulent viruses responsible for fatal outbreaks in pigs of all age groups. Nowadays, less pathogenic strains are commonly found in most swine populations causing asymptomatic infections in young animals.",

PEVs are classified into three genetic groups: (1) PEV types 1\u20137 and 11\u201313, (2) PEV type 8 and (3) PEV types 9 and 10. Before reclassification, the original 11 PEV serotypes were divided into three subgroups (I, II and III) based on physicochemical properties, serological assays, types of cytopathic effect (CPE) produced in the porcine kidney (PK) cells and diverse cell culture host ranges (Knowles et al. 1979). In 1999, more recently complete genome analysis of available PEV group I (former PEV1\u20137 and PEV11\u201313) sequences revealed that they were different from other Enteroviruses. Based on the genetic differences they were classified as a new genus, Teschovirus containing a single species PTV (the name was derived from Teschen disease) of multiple serotypes (Kaku et al. 2001; Zell et al. 2001). The species name is also renamed to Teschovirus A to remove the ambiguity reference to natural host, but the virus name remains PTV. Lately, nine additional genetic types in PTVs (PTV-14\u2013PTV-22) from China are proposed (Yang et al. 2018). Most severe clinical disease (teschovirus encephalomyelitis) relates to PTV-1, whereas other types are associated with a milder form of the disease (Talfan disease).",

PTV serotypes 1\u201310 were previously known as porcine enterovirus group I. Former PEV-1\u20137 have been renamed PTV-1\u20137, and PEV-11\u201313 were designated as PTV-8\u201310 (Kaku et al. 2001). In 2011, PTV-12 was identified for the first time in Spanish pig population, which is presumed to be the result of VP1 gene mutation (Cano-Gomez et al. 2011). Likewise, PTV-13 was for the first time detected in faeces of wild boar in Hungary (Boros et al. 2012). Very recently, nine more genotypes (PTV-14\u201322) of PTV have been proposed from a study in China in 2018. However, these strains remain unverified by serological methods (Yang et al. 2018). Negative selection and homologous recombination are two significant causes of genetic diversity in structural and non-structural genes served as the major driving mechanisms of PTV evolution (Lin et al. 2012). Two-step evolution is observed in PTVs (Zell et al. 2001). The first step led to the generation of three groups that have undergone further diversification and emergence of 13 distinct serotypes (Fig. 6.2). Another feature regarding evolutionary changes of PTVs is the gradual changes in their virulence, generating less pathogenic variants.",

As early as 2\u20133 dpi, caudal ataxia is seen to be leading which progresses to paresis or paralysis. Commonly, 3\u20134 days after the onset of clinical symptoms, death occurs (Yamada et al. 2014). Polioencephalomyelitis rarely progresses to complete paralysis. SMEDI syndrome (stillbirth [S], mummified foetus [M], embryonic death [ED], infertility [I]) is associated with reproductive disorders (Dunne et al. 1965). Similar reproductive syndromes are also associated with parvovirus infection, which occurs more commonly than PTV. The infection causes embryonic death and mummification in early to mid-gestation (40\u201370 days) but at later stages it may result in stillbirth (Lin et al. 2012). Experimental and field infection also reported the link with abortion (Kirkbride and McAdaragh 1978). Though isolation of virus is done from the male reproductive tract, experimental intrauterine inoculation of sperm containing virus did not infect embryos or prevent conception. However, virus isolation was reported both from healthy and diarrhoeic pigs, but experimentally PTVs can induce diarrhoea in a host (free from other pathogens). There are not many reports available on respiratory infections caused by PTVs. Recently a congenital microphthalmic syndrome in a pig with typical non-suppurative myelitis in the lumbar spinal cord from the Czech Republic has been reported (Andrysikova et al. 2018). Table 6.1 shows the association of some serotypes with specific disease conditions but many serotypes are not related to any clinical signs.",

IgA antibodies generated within the intestinal tract have shown to be protective when the virus enters orally. Persistent virus infection may develop in the intestinal tract due to failure of antibody production. Maternal antibodies are effective to prevent viremia and transplacental spread of PTV. PTVs spread slowly through intrauterine causing foetal deaths at different developmental stages (Wang and Pensaert 1989). Foetal anti-PTV antibodies are mainly IgM type followed by IgG, which starts developing by 70 days and matures by 90 days (Wang et al. 1973). These antibodies can protect the foetus from infection during this stage. Maternal antibody acquired from colostrum can protect after weaning (Wang and Pensaert 1989).",

As the disease is caused by several PTV serotypes, developing a vaccine from multiple serotypes is quite challenging. Vaccination may be economical to control the virulent form of Teschen disease and to protect valuable breeder stocks, sows or pigs.Restrictions in imports from PTV-affected countries could help in limiting the spread of the virulent PTV-1 strain. Quarantine and slaughter would likely be effective control measures.Introduce new breeding stock into the unit more than 1 month before breeding to expose them to enzootic or endemic PTV strains and allow the development of immunity.Closed-herd system reduces the risk of introducing extraneous viruses, but it is not possible to eliminate this risk since the relatively resistant PTVs transmit by a variety of fomites.",
