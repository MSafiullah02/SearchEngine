It was after that declared as a pandemic two months later by the World Health Organization (WHO) (Bogoch et al., 2020; World Health Organization, 2020a, 2020b, 2020c). Pneumonia associated with SARS-CoV-2, termed COVID-19, is suspected to be due to the first animal to human transmission in a seafood market in Wuhan city in November 2019 (Hui et al., 2020; Parr, 2020 ). On 20 January 2020, Chinese authorities confirmed the human-to-human route for virus transmission (Hui et al., 2020). Today, more than 154,000 reported deaths, from the 2.3 million confirmed infections worldwide, are mainly due to lung failure as a result of SARS-CoV-2 disease. The viral protein responsible for host-cell recognition is the spike protein ( ~1300 amino acids), found in homotrimeric state over the virion particle and characterize coronaviruses (Khan et al., 2020). Different host cell receptors are recognized by different coronaviruses such as Heparan Sulfate Proteoglycans, Angiotensin-Converting Enzyme 2 (ACE2), Aminopeptidase N, Heat Shock Protein A5 (HSPA5), furin, and O-Acetylated Sialic Acid (Belouzard et al., 2012; Hasan et al., 2020; Hofmann et al., 2005; Huang et al., 2015; Ibrahim et al., 2020; Raj et al., 2013).",

            "text": "The bioactive component of olive leaf extract, hydroxytyrosol, (bink column) shows moderate average binding affinity (\u22125.20 \u00b1 0.35 kcal/mol) to HSPA5 SBD\u03b2. Hydroxytyrosol succeeded in a previous study as a prophylactic agent against myocardial infarction-mediated apoptosis (Wu et al., 2018). For the caffeic and p-Coumaric acids (light blue columns), that are found in grape skin, the average binding affinities to HSPA5 SBD\u03b2 are \u22126.3 \u00b1 0.60 and \u22125.63 \u00b1 0.57 kcal/mol, respectively. These values are slightly less than Pep42 (\u22126.73 \u00b1 1.13 kcal/mol), but the differences are not significant. Caffeic and p-Coumaric acids may bind to cell-surface HSPA5 competing for its recognition by viral spike protein and contradict the attachment. The same effect can be concluded from the caffeic acid phenethyl ester (CAPE) (dark blue column) that can be found in honeybee hive propolis (average binding affinity to HSPA5 SBD\u03b2 is -7.13 \u00b1 0.95 kcal/mol). This average binding energy value is better than the highly selective cyclic peptide, Pep42, which indicates the potential of CAPE as an HSPA5 SBD\u03b2 binder. Additionally, CAPE was reported to induce ER stress in an autophagy-dependent manner in human SH\u2010SY5Y neuroblastoma (Tanida et al., 2008; Tomiyama et al., 2018). Cinnamaldehyde (cyan column) and thymoquinone (violet column) show \u22126.25 \u00b1 1.10 and \u22125.520 \u00b1 0.12 kcal/mol average binding energies to HSPA5 SBD\u03b2. These binding energies are comparable to the Pep42 cyclic peptide (\u22126.73 \u00b1 1.13 kcal/mol) and hence the active components of cinnamon and the seeds of Nigella sativa may tightly bind to cell-surface HSPA5 and could be successful in contradicting SARS-CoV-2 spike recognition and attachment.",

Figure 3B shows the average binding affinities for the binding of estrogens (estriol and estradiol), cholesterol, progesterone, testosterone, and hydrocortisone (cortisol) to HSPA5 SBD\u03b2. As implicated from the binding energy values, all the physiological compounds can tightly bond the HSPA5 SBD\u03b2 with values ranges from -7.20 \u00b1 0.58 kcal/mol (Hydrocortisone) up to -8.40 \u00b1 0.98 kcal/mol (estradiol). These values are lower (better) than that of the Pep42 cyclic peptide, which reported to target cell-surface HSPA5 (GRP78) in vivo selectively. It is important here to point out that HSPA5 SBD\u03b2 may act as a receptor for such hormones. The binding energies indicate that cell-surface HSPA5 may be critical for these hormones recognition and hence internalization which not only may downregulate the concentration of cell-surface HSPA5, and its associated chemotherapeutic resistance, but also may play an essential role in hormone internalization for cell-signaling (Niu et al., 2015; Zhang et al., 2015). As a consequence, these hormones may also be used as protective molecules during chemotherapy to revert the chemoresistance of the HSPA5 presenting cancer cells.",

Two types of interactions are dominant, the H-bonding and the hydrophobic interactions. Additionally, \u03c0-stacking (residues in bold in the tables) is reported between the residue F451 and the estrogens (estriol and estradiol), phytoestrogens (daidzein, genistein, and formononetin), caffeic acid phenethyl ester (CAPE), and cis-p-Coumaric acid. Also, salt bridges (underlined residues in Table 1) are formed between the residue K460 and both linolenic acid and cis-p-Coumaric acid. Hydrophobic interactions are more dominant compared to the H-bonding, as can be seen from almost all the natural and physiological compounds. This is in good agreement with previous reports defining the function of HSPA5 SBD\u03b2 in the lumen of ER as to recognize unfolded proteins in the lumen of the ER mediating its degradation or refolding using cellular machinery (Ibrahim et al., 2019; Pfaffenbach & Lee, 2011; Roller & Maddalo, 2013). On the other hand, hydrocortisone and chlorogenic acid have more H-bonds than hydrophobic interactions (5:3 and 7:5 for hydrocortisone and chlorogenic acid, respectively). Additionally, caffeic acid forms four H-bonds and four hydrophobic contacts with the HSPA5 SDB\u03b2.",

Additionally, I tried to dock the small molecules-HSPA5 complexes to the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein model, but the spike doesn\u2019t fit the HSPA5 binding site; this may be due to the presence of the small molecules in the SBD\u03b2 of HSPA5.
