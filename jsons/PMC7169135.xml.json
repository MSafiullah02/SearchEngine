Instead of focusing on final outcomes such as accumulated wealth, people focus on changes around a reference point\u2014gains and losses from their personal status quo point or other aspiration level. Furthermore, low probability outcomes are overweighted and moderate to high ones are underweighted, although certainty is overweighted compared to near\u2010certainty. Prospect theory has been featured primarily in the economics literature, and indeed Kahneman and Tversky's 1979 paper is the most cited paper in Econometrica.(\n\n19\n\n)\n",

While prospect theory may be better than traditional (e.g., Bernoulli's) utility theory in describing how people actually make choices, individuals and organizations should be urged to evaluate outcomes carefully in terms of long\u2010term rather than short\u2010term goals.

Cutter et al.(\n\n37\n\n) used the Toxic Release Inventory and other data to examine the distribution of polluting industrial facilities in South Carolina, and did not observe a disproportionate burden on racial minorities and the poor. Burger et al.(\n\n38\n\n) argue that all populations should have access to the decision\u2010making process and provide suggestions for ecological information. Greenberg(\n\n39\n\n) argued and demonstrated that markedly different results could be produced by manipulating the geographical scale of the data, time period, definitions of populations, and statistics used to measure inequity. Nevertheless, the explication of the theory in the context of civil rights has been a powerful device to challenge policies about transportation, energy, and cleanup priorities after environmental disasters (e.g., Katrina). EJ theory may be the most important theoretical addition to environmental policy over the last two decades because it forces decisionmakers to consider distributive impacts and nonquantifiable costs and benefits.(\n\n40\n, \n41\n, \n42\n\n)\n",

Monte Carlo simulation has become a widely used practice for calculating a probability distribution on model output from the set of probability distributions on model inputs. Decision trees and influence diagrams (or Bayesian networks(\n\n46\n\n)) are also used for such calculations, and have the advantage that the conditional structure is made explicit. These types of formal uncertainty analyses have become widely used for understanding plausible risks and identifying critical uncertainties associated with them for U.S. federal agencies, and in the European Union and Japan, among other nations.(\n\n46\n, \n47\n, \n48\n, \n49\n, \n50\n, \n51\n\n) Some subnational government agencies now mandate the use of probabilistic risk assessment (PRA) and provide guidance on its use.",

            "text": "Traditionally, certain kinds of risks have been very difficult to quantify due to a lack of adequate scientific understanding and valid modeling methods. For example, risks of exposure\u2010related cancers used to be based largely on default assumptions (e.g., that cancer risk is proportional to exposure) and safety factors of uncertain and questionable validity for specific agents. Microbial and antimicrobial hazards used to be assessed using simplistic models and factors that did not adequately distinguish between individual dose\u2010response probabilities and population distributions of individual dose\u2010response functions. This situation has improved greatly over the past 30 years. For cancer risk assessment, the introduction of the two\u2010stage stochastic clonal expansion (TSCE) model by Moolgavkar et al., in a series of Risk Analysis articles and related papers that began in the early 1980s, opened the door to a variety of \u201cbiologically\u2010based\u201d risk models that were simultaneously biologically plausible and practical to estimate from experimental and epidemiological data.(\n\n89\n, \n90\n, \n91\n, \n92\n, \n93\n\n) Applications to radiation\u2010related risks (e.g., from uranium mines), chemical carcinogens and leukemogens (such as benzene), interactions between smoking and occupational exposures, and a host of other practical applications swiftly followed, but these applications were not confined to cancer risk and included, for example, contamination of drinking water supplies by viruses.(\n\n94\n\n)\n",

While the PRA model is still applied, it has limitations for some applications and hence other tools from operations research are also being applied to this important policy area, including multilevel optimization (e.g., finding a defender's best decision, anticipating both the attacker's best response to it, and the defender's own best response to the attacker's response), multicriteria optimization, value modeling (for attackers and defenders), decision analytic techniques (such as influence diagrams, decision trees, and game trees), game theory, and empirically and psychologically motivated risk models.
