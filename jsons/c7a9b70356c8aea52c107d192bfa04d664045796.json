Noroviruses for instance, the leading cause for acute gastroenteritis, require the expression of blood group antigens on gut epithelial surfaces for successful infection [5, 6] , the hepatitis B virus seems to have a preference for blood group A [7] , the tastes of the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) are still under debate [8] , and an extremely detailed list of pathogens and their blood type connection can be found in a review by Laura Cooling [1] . It is noteworthy that this connection exceeds often the stage of simple binding between host and pathogen: some microorganisms have learnt to stimulate antibodies against blood group antigens, in order to manipulate the immune system, while blood group antigens can function as decoy receptors, as to prevent the pathogen from accessing its target tissue [1] .",

            "text": "In terms of infection rates and disease severity however, the best-studied cases are naturally intra-erythrocytic pathogens, first and foremost malaria 7 . At this point, it is important to point out that, although the disease is usually associated with the parasite Plasmodium falciparum as the automatic culprit, the P. vivax variant is geographically more wide-spread and responsible for almost threequarters of malaria cases in the Americas [9, 10] . There are significant differences in regard to disease pathogenesis, elicited immune response, and life cycle of the two species. Notably, P. falciparum merozoites are mainly found in mature RBCs, while P. vivax prefers their immature precursors, reticulocytes. Fittingly, another crucial difference is the requirement of the Duffy antigen specifically for P. vivax infection [9, 11] . To date, most studies, including on ABO groups, have focused on P. falciparum, considered for a long time the more virulent of the two species, and causing most malaria cases on the African continent [9] . A recent meta-analysis by Degarege et al. concluded that non-O blood groups had a higher risk of severe P. falciparum infection, with no further differences between A, B and AB types [12] . One possible molecular mechanism seems to be the process of \"rosetting\", the adhesion of infected RBCs to uninfected erythrocytes, which is strongly correlated to severe malaria through complications such as microvascular congestion and the ensuing tissue damage and organ failure. Evidence points towards the blood group A trisaccharides and P. falciparum RIFIN molecules as binding partners, with more candidates on the cell surfaces and in the host serum awaiting further investigation for potential therapeutic applications [13] . A few studies also point towards a P. vivax -ABO system connection: one of them found for example that the proportion of blood group O individuals was three times higher in P. vivax compared to P. falciparum infections [14] . \u00c9rika M Braga's team addresses in this issue of Microbes & Infection not only the relation of P. vivax with ABO blood groups, confirming the increased susceptibility of group O individuals, but in addition tackles an important yet often neglected complication of malaria infection, which is anaemia [15] . Direct destruction of RBCs upon the release of parasites and perturbed erythropoiesis would be obvious explanations for anaemia, if it weren't for the fact that much more uninfected than infected RBCs are actually removed -in P. vivax infection, the ratio is of 34 [16] . Oxidative stress and lipoperoxidation, leading to 4-hydroxynonenal production, have been invoked as a potential mechanism [17] , but Braga's group speculated already in a concise review from 2014 that host immune mechanisms, and an excessive immune response might play a part in malaria associated anaemia pathogenesis, especially upon P. vivax infection, which elicits strong inflammation. The authors pointed out that complement activation is systematically increased in malaria, and an insufficient upregulation of regulatory elements could lead to autologous complement-mediated lysis. Moreover, autoantibodies can emerge from cross-reactive antigenicity between host and parasite, or molecular mimicry by the pathogen [16] . Before long, Braga's group provided experimental evidence for the presence of high levels of auto-antibodies against RBCs in P. vivax patients with severe anaemia. In addition, they showed that opsonisation with IgG antibodies from anaemic patients of healthy erythrocytes increased their phagocytosis and decreased their membrane flexibility [18] . The study in question did not address yet an additional difference between blood groups regarding the risk to develop anaemic and the involvement of auto-antibodies, as hinted soon by another investigation revealing that P. vivax infected individuals of blood type O showed lower levels of haemoglobin and haematocrit compared to type O patients [19] . Here, Mour\u00e3o et al. combine all three elements, confirm previous findings, and add a layer of molecular mechanisms to the process. They demonstrate that the IgG antibody response of P. vivax patients in general is greater against type O than type A erythrocytes, and that anaemic patients in particular exhibit more IgM antibodies against type O. Furthermore, IgG antibodies from anaemic individuals also lead to a greater increase in RBC membrane rigidity, and to more phagocytosis especially of type O erythrocytes [15] . This raises a plethora of new intriguing questions: what boosts the auto-immune response specifically against blood group O RBCs, and if it is potentially triggered by P. vivax, and if there is a connection with the patient's blood type, to cite a few.",

However, this protective effect of blood group O observed in falciparum malaria has never been demonstrated in malaria caused by Plasmodium vivax. Since immune response, life cycle and disease pathogenesis are different for both P. vivax and P. falciparum, we postulated that ABO blood groups influence clinical outcomes of Plasmodium infection in different manners. Because anaemia is one of the major complications of P. vivax infection, which is thought to arise from the destruction of both infected and non-infected red blood cells (RBCs), we decided to test in vitro mechanistic evidence in favour of higher susceptibility to healthy RBCs destruction by autoantibodies from P. vivax-infected patients from blood group O compared to patients of the blood group A.",
