In order to administer drugs by inhalation, it is necessary to generate aerosols (suspensions of particles in a gas) with a well-defined composition, particle size and shape. They must be delivered to the respiratory tract of laboratory animals in a way that parallels the likely human exposure. This should avoid non-respiratory pathways through the skin and food.",

Site of deposition depends primarily on particle size, but variability in the sites of deposition occurs among different laboratory animal species and humans by virtue of the differences in the size and shape of the respiratory passages as well as breathing patterns.21 In addition, there are different types of inhalers used in human therapy to consider: nebulizers, propellant-driven metered dose inhalers and dry powder inhalers.22 The need to phase out ozone-depleting chlorofluorocarbons as propellants has also generated a need to assess new propellants and their impact on drug delivery.7\n",

            "text": "The subsequent fate of inhaled particles depends not only on their size but also on their shape, chemical nature, and solubility in body fluids. Soluble substances are absorbed into the bloodstream and are removed by the pulmonary circulation. They may also undergo metabolism by enzymes present in the cell populations of the respiratory tract and reactive metabolites may cause local pulmonary damage. Insoluble, inert particles are removed primarily by the mucociliary transport system of the trachea and bronchi or through phagocytosis by macrophages. Overload of the lung by relatively inert, non-fibrous particles such as titanium dioxide or carbon black may impair alveolar macrophage-mediated particle clearance.23 This may lead in turn to accumulation of dusts over time with eventual fibrotic and tumorigenic responses.24 This has led to concerns that newer materials such as engineered long carbon nanotubes may accumulate in the lung and pleural cavity and induce inflammation and neoplasia.25., 26. Unlike larger particles, it has been shown that nanosized particles are less easily phagocytized by macrophages and are less readily cleared from alveoli.27 Nevertheless like larger particles effects of nanoparticles appear also to relate to levels of exposure, their chemistry, size, shape, state of agglomeration and electromagnetic properties.2\n",

Standardized histological sections, careful recording of lesions with the use of diagrams of the rodent nasal cavity are useful in the assessment of lesions in the nasal cavity found in inhalation studies.57 In dogs and primates sectioning and blocking are more complex. Although dissection is required, a similar procedure following decalcification can be adopted. High-resolution three-dimensional magnetic resonance imaging has also been used to characterize the dimensions of the nasal cavities of cynomolgus monkeys and map the distribution of lesions induced by inhaled xenobiotics.58., 59.\n",

While therapeutic agents administered by the inhalation route do not usually produce a severe degenerative or inflammatory response in the nasal mucosa, at least at therapeutic doses, the simple categories proposed by Hardisty and colleagues in recording of degenerative and reactive lesions following exposure to volatile chemicals are useful.57 Categories suggested are: inflammation, degeneration, regeneration, atrophy (post-degenerative), respiratory metaplasia and basal cell hyperplasia.

Although the degree of histological changes varied with different agents, the changes were broadly similar in type and distribution.69 Most agents examined produced little or no alteration in the squamous mucosa lining the anterior part of the nose apart from some mild increase in thickness of the squamous layers. Principal sites of damage were shown to be the anterior respiratory epithelium adjacent to the vestibule and the olfactory epithelium of the dorsal meatus. There was a distinct decrease in severity in posterior regions. Histologically, the lesions in respiratory epithelium ranged from mild loss of cilia and small areas of epithelial exfoliation to frank erosion, ulceration and necrosis of the epithelium and underlying tissues including bone. Variable polymorphonuclear cell infiltration was also found. In some cases, early squamous metaplasia developed on the free margins or the naso-maxillo-turbinates. Changes to the olfactory epithelium varied from focal to extensive loss of sensory cells associated with damage to sustentacular cells. In severe cases, complete loss of olfactory epithelium occurred. Although the degree of histological change was shown to vary with different agents, lesions induced by the more water-soluble chemicals tended to remain localized in the anterior part of the nasal cavity whereas agents with relatively low water solubility produced lung lesions in addition. It was suggested that these findings demonstrated the powerful \u2018scrubbing\u2019 action of the nasal cavity for water soluble, airborne xenobiotics.70\n",

There was also damage to Bowman\u2019s glands. The development of proliferative lesions and ultimately tumors of principally neuroectodermal origin followed chronic treatment. As RP73401 was highly metabolized and the nasal lesions could be inhibited by treatment of rats with metyrapone, a non-specific inhibitor of cytochromes P450, it was postulated that the changes were the result of P450-mediated activation in the olfactory tissues, not linked to its pharmacological phosphodiesterase activity.72\n",

These features resemble those that can be seen in other proliferating tissues after single doses of antimitotic drugs. Rats and marmosets have been shown to be less sensitive to these effects of vincristine, probably as a consequence of drug disposition differences.79 The risk of damage to human olfactory cells from agents with these effects in rat nasal mucosa often remains uncertain because of a lack of understanding of relative exposure and metabolism in different species and the metabolic potential of human olfactory mucosa.",

The stomata on the parietal pleural are 2 to over 10 \u00b5m in diameter and are found in association with accumulations of leukocytes, termed milky spots on the pleura. It appears that some inhaled particles reach the pleural fluid and drain into these stomata to eventually reach the hilar and other lymph nodes. It has been argued that long thin and durable fibers such as asbestos become impeded at these stomata thereby inducing localized inflammatory reactions, fibrosis and eventually neoplasia at these sites in the pleural cavity (see below).25\n",

In the Lewis strain this was characterized after 28 days by a variable acute inflammatory exudate in bronchi and bronchioles with focal bronchiectasis, inflammation and hyperplasia of the epithelium with a predominantly macrophage infiltration of the alveoli and alveolar walls.65., 143. These changes were associated with marked hyperplasia of the bronchus-associated lymphoid tissue (BALT), which extended down the airways and blood vessels towards the periphery of the lungs. Although the lymphoid hyperplasia was also found in inoculated Fischer 344 rats, it was less marked and accompanied by little or no mucopurulent exudate or active inflammation of the bronchial walls. This disparity in response suggested that differences were related to the degree of lymphocyte activation in the two strains, an imbalance in regulation of lymphocyte proliferation in Lewis rats, or both.143\n",

Sequential studies showed that the initial damage to bronchial and bronchiolar epithelium is associated with polymorphonuclear and lymphocytic inflammation (bronchiolitis). Immunocytochemical and ultrastructural studies revealed the presence of viral antigen in the mucosa.141 Hyperplastic and multinucleated syncytial epithelial cells develop in the hyperplastic terminal bronchiolar epithelium and the inflammatory process extended to involve peribronchial or peribronchiolar parenchyma with infiltration of alveolar walls by mononuclear cells, macrophages and neutrophils. A similar cell population accompanied by cell debris and edema fluid develops in air spaces. Pulmonary arteries show only minor involvement with inflammatory cells and focal reactive hyperplasia of the endothelium. Immunocytochemistry and ultrastructural examination suggested that virus replication takes place in alveolar type I and type II epithelial cells and macrophages but not in endothelial or interstitial cells of the alveolar septae.144 It was shown that when repair occurs there may be residual distortion of bronchiolar and alveolar walls by collagen and hyperplastic cuboidal epithelium may line the thickened alveolar septa. Air spaces may also contain enlarged macrophages with pale vacuolated cytoplasm.145 Strain differences in susceptibility have also been demonstrated to this virus. There is differential pulmonary interleukin 12 (IL-12) gene expression between virus-susceptible Brown Norway rats and resistant Fischer 344 rats, and IL-12 treatment provides protection from virus-induced chronic airway inflammation and remodeling. Moreover increased tumor necrosis factor \u03b1 (TNF\u03b1) expression has been shown to be an important regulatory factor in the development of Sendai virus-induced bronchiolar fibrosis in infected rats.146 Virus-inoculated Brown Norway rats had increased TNF\u03b1 pulmonary mRNA levels and increased numbers of bronchiolar macrophages and fibroblasts expressing TNF\u03b1 protein compared with virus-inoculated Fischer 344 rats.147\n",

However, high doses have been associated with a number of adverse effects, notably the vascular leak syndrome, characterized clinically by pulmonary edema, pleural effusions and ascites.157\n",

Pulmonary venules and arterioles showed the presence of lymphocytes attached to or lying beneath the endothelium, infiltrating vessel walls or in a perivascular location where they were accompanied by edema fluid or red blood cells. Similar, but less severe changes have been demonstrated in rats given IL-2.158 In addition, treated rats showed an infiltration of pulmonary vasculature with eosinophils probably secondary to an eosinopoietic cytokine produced by IL-2-stimulated lymphocytes. Immunocytochemical evaluation of the lymphoid infiltrate in mice showed that most of the cells were Thy 1.2-positive (CD90) lymphocytes. Furthermore, co-administration of asialo GM1 (ganglio-n-tetrosyl-ceremide) with IL-2 not only abrogated the clinical signs but also reduced the number of asialo GM1-positive lymphocytes in the tissue sections.",

In florid cases there may be caseation surrounded by epithelioid and multinucleated giant cells and variable numbers of lymphocytes, plasma cells and fibroblasts.

Granulomatous pneumonitis is also produced in laboratory animals by the intravenous injection of bacille Calmette-Gu\u00e9rin (BCG). Twenty-eight days following intravenous injection of BCG, the lungs of C57B1/6 mice contained numerous granulomas composed of histiocytes and round cells which were surrounded by alveoli with thickened walls and associated with mild interstitial pneumonitis.166 These histological changes were associated with an increase in the number of Thy 1.2-positive (CD90) cells, especially Lyt-1 (CD5) positive lymphocytes.

After about a week, interstitial infiltrates also comprise fibroblasts with early collagen deposition, associated with proliferation of macrophages and type II pneumocytes.189., 190. Subsequently, the amount of interstitial collagen increases, with eventual scarring and collapse of lung tissue in proportion to the cumulative dose given.191 Immunohistochemical and ultrastructural study of rats and mice treated with bleomycin shows a large accumulation of immune-reactive laminin and reduplication of the basement lamina within the thickened alveolar walls.192 In bleomycin-treated rats three-dimensional scanning electron microscopy shows drug-induced capillary remodeling comprising irregular alveolar and pleural capillaries with increased diameter and decreased branching.193 Certain strains of mice have been shown to possess greater sensitivity to bleomycin fibrogenesis.

However, these inclusions are not prominent and do not appear to be closely associated with cell damage. Moreover, although pulmonary interstitial fibrosis occurs in association with phospholipidosis in patients, amiodarone-induced phospholipidosis in rodents is not associated with pulmonary fibrosis or significant functional alterations. Several theories have been proposed for the pulmonary alveolitis and interstitial fibrosis in humans.234 The weight of evidence suggests that the accumulation of lipid-laden histiocytes is not causally related to the alveolitis or pulmonary fibrosis.235 Cytotoxicity, possibly through the metabolite desethylamiodarone or an immune-mediated mechanism, has been postulated, possibly favored by the binding of drug to components of pulmonary tissue.233 Free radical formation or indirect influences on inflammatory mechanisms may also be involved.236 It is also possible that pulmonary disease results from an interaction of several mechanisms and metabolic factors unique to particular patients.",

The degree of goblet cell hyperplasia is dictated by the severity and duration of the irritation or inflammatory process. Florid cases of goblet cell hyperplasia are characterized by thickening and pseudostratification of the tracheal or bronchial mucosa by a population of tall, mucus secreting cells with abundant pale cytoplasm. In addition, goblet cells extend further down the airways than in normal animals and mucus may fill or distend the airways or impact in the alveoli. In less florid cases, a simple increase in the number of goblet cells may be found without other structural change.93 Goblet cell hyperplasia of the lining epithelium may be accompanied by an increase in size of the underlying submucosal glands. This has clearly been demonstrated in patients with chronic bronchitis and in rats where submucosal glands are normally quite prominent.246., 248. Species differences may exist because the airways of laboratory animals are variably endowed with goblet cells and submucosal mucous glands. The normal rat has more goblet cells lining the airways than either mouse or hamster.246\n",

This was associated with an increase in length, width and depth of submucosal glands.250 Similar changes were produced by pilocarpine. Both alcian blue and PAS positive cells were increased in number following administration of this agent, suggesting that pilocarpine induced both acid and neutral glycoprotein secretion. Comparison of the distribution of these changes in the rat following isoprenaline, with those of salbutamol, pilocarpine and tobacco smoke, showed that there were regional differences in the distribution of these changes in the airways.251 Isoprenaline produced a greater increase in secretory cells in peripheral airways than tobacco smoke which itself produces a greater increase in mitotic activity. Isoprenaline and pilocarpine produced a more diffuse change than the more selective \u03b2 agonist, salbutamol. The changes induced by these therapeutic agents are presumably the result of their pharmacological activity.251 Sturgess and Reid showed that the changes in the rat were accompanied by hypertrophy of the pancreas, submaxillary and parotid salivary glands.250 (See Digestive System, Chapter 8.)",

There is considerable risk in overinterpretation of such group differences in conventional mouse bioassays. In the analysis of group differences, consideration needs to be given to tissue sampling procedure, age standardization, historical control incidence, effects on food intake as well as the results of mutagenicity studies and carcinogenicity bioassays in other rodent species. Indeed, a considerable number of widely employed therapeutic agents of different classes have produced an increase in benign or malignant pulmonary tumors in carcinogenicity studies performed in mice without this proving of any significance to humans. Davies and Monro counted at least 17 drugs in the 1994 Physicians\u2019 Desk Reference of the United States.288 In the two-year rodent carcinogenicity studies conducted in the National Toxicology Progam, the lung is second to the liver as the most common site of neoplasia in male and female mice and common in female rats.270\n",

Administration of this compound led to an increased incidence of pulmonary adenomas and carcinomas in three separate mouse carcinogenicity bioassays.290., 291. The analysis of these findings was somewhat complicated by evidence that metronidazole shows mutagenic activity in bacterial assays using some strains of Salmonella typhimurium. It was argued that the risk to human patients was slight because the increase in prevalence in pulmonary tumors was likely to be a result of changes in nutritional status of the mice through the effect of metronidazole on gut flora, as similar differences could occur between ad libitum-fed mice and those fed the same but restricted diet.291 It was also postulated that the positive findings in bacterial mutagenesis assays were an inherent part of the antibacterial activity of metronidazole as a result of nitroreduction that does not occur in normal mammalian tissues. This conclusion was supported by negative effects in hamster carcinogenicity bioassays as well as lack of excess cancer risk in women followed up for 10 years or more.291\n",
