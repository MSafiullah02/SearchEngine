The collection of nasopharyngeal aspirate, combined (nasal and oral) swab samples, or samples of lower respiratory tract secretions (sputum, tracheal lavage fluid, or bronchoalveolar lavage fluid) is recommended. To confirm the disease, it is necessary to perform molecular biology tests that detect viral RNA. Severe cases should be transferred to a referral hospital for isolation and treatment. Individuals with mild symptoms should be followed at the primary health care level and should be advised to selfisolate at home (1) .",

The authors hypothesized that the frequency of certain CT findings would increase in parallel with an increase in the time elapsed since infection. Only the initial chest CT scans were evaluated. In 27 (22%) of the 121 patients, CT showed no changes. The remaining 94 (78%) patients had ground-glass opacities, areas of consolidation, or both. Of the 121 patients, 73 (60%) had bilateral lung disease. None of the 121 patients had thoracic lymph node disease, pulmonary cavitation, or pulmonary nodules, and only 1 patient (1%) had pleural effusion. The time from the onset of symptoms to the first CT scan was classified as early (0-2 days; 36 patients), intermediate (3-5 days ; 33 patients), or late (6-12 days; 25 patients). The frequency of ground-glass opacities and areas of consolidation was considerably lower in the early-CT group than in the intermediate-CT group and late-CT group. Pulmonary opacities were seen in only 16 (44%) of the 36 early-CT group patients, compared with 30 (91%) of the 33 intermediate-CT group patients and 24 (96%) of the 25 late-CT group patients. Bilateral pulmonary involvement was observed in 10 (28%) of the early-CT group patients, in 25 (76%) of the intermediate-CT group patients, and in 22 (88%) of the late-CT group patients. Linear opacities, a crazy-paving pattern, and the inverted halo sign were absent in the early-CT group but were present in the late-CT group in 5 (20%), 5 (20%), and 1 (4%) of patients, respectively. In terms of disease distribution in the axial plane, peripheral distribution was observed in 8 (22%) of the early-CT group patients, in 21 (64%) of the intermediate-CT group patients, and in 18 (72%) of the late-CT group patients.",
