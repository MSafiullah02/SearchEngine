The baseplate coordinates the movement of the six long tail fibers that initially sense the presence of the host, the short tail fibers that unfold from underneath the baseplate to firmly anchor on the E. coli surface, and the tail sheath surrounding the tail tube that contracts, thereby ejecting DNA into the host. The numbers identify the gene products of the various proteins that are in the assembled virion.

Where particles have symmetry, it is critical to impose the correct point group, for otherwise the result will be blurred.
