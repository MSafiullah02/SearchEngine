Although the fatality rate of COVID-19 is about 2\u20135%, which is not very high, the fatality rate among the geriatric population aged over 60 years is greater than 10%. The fatality rate is even higher for individuals in their 70s and 80s [1].",

For the geriatric population, telemedicine consultations can also help with overcoming isolation and loneliness due to disconnection with the external world. Moreover, by reducing the number of hospital visits for periodical consultations and prescriptions among the geriatric population with mental illnesses, telemedicine may potentially reduce the number of secondary or tertiary infections that could occur on route to the hospital or while waiting for care. Furthermore, telemedicine may also reduce the loss to follow up among psychiatric patients. Through telemedicine, doctors are able to continuously identify and manage each patient\u2019s condition, which may prevent patients from not receiving appropriate treatment if their psychiatric symptoms worsen.",

There is also an increased probability of social withdrawal and isolation among the geriatric population in this situation, and as direct visits to hospitals are difficult, there are greater concerns about their mental health. It is expected that telemedicine will play a useful role in protecting the mental health of the geriatric population during the COVID-19 pandemic and in other future situations associated with outbreaks of infectious diseases.
