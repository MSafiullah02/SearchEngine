The authors highlighted the need for both mental health services, particularly for vulnerable populations, and the strengthening of social capital to reduce the adverse psychological impact of the outbreak. Another, from Japan (Shigemura et al., 2020) , emphasised the economic impact of COVID-19 and its effects on well-being, as well as the likely high levels of fear and panic behaviour, such as hoarding and stockpiling of resources, in the general population. This paper also identified populations at higher risk of adverse mental health outcomes, including patients with COVID-19 and their families, individuals with existing physical or psychiatric morbidity, and healthcare workers.",

            "text": "Observational studies of mental health concerns related to COVID-19. Cross-sectional, self-rated questionnaire Self-Rating Anxiety Scale (SAS); General Self-Efficiency Scale Of the remaining papers, one pointed out that the wide scope and spread of COVID-19 could lead to a true mental health crisis, especially in countries with high case loads (Dong and Bouey, 2020) which would require both large-scale psychosocial crisis interventions, and the incorporation of mental health care in disaster management plans in the future. In a related report (Duan and Zhu, 2020) it was pointed out that while Western countries have incorporated psychological interventions into their protocols for disease outbreaks, this has not yet happened in countries such as China, leading to the emergence and persistence of stress-related disorders in affected persons. This paper also offered suggestions for the development of intervention strategies, which will be summarized in section 3.5 below. In contrast, Bao et al. (2020) highlighted the services that were already being provided in China, and also provided a list of strategies for the general public to minimize outbreak-related stress: (1) assessment of the accuracy of information, (2) enhancing social support, (3) reducing the stigma associated with the disease, (4) maintaining as normal a life as feasible while adhering to safety measures, (5) use of available psychosocial services, particularly online services, when needed. Such methods, in their opinion, would empower society to handle the COVID-19 outbreak in an adaptive manner. Similar strategies were reiterated in a paper from Singapore which also discussed the role of improved screening for mental disorders, improving links between community and hospital services, and providing accurate information to the general public in order to minimize maladaptive responses such as \"panic\" and paranoia regarding the disease and its transmission. Finally, a brief review paper (Lima et al., 2020) highlighted the role of anxiety as the dominant emotional response to an outbreak, and the need for adequate training of healthcare personnel and the optimal use of technological advances to deliver mental health care.",

Health anxiety, which arises from the misinterpretation of perceived bodily sensations and changes, can be protective in everyday life. However, during an outbreak of infectious disease, particularly in the presence of inaccurate or exaggerated information from the media, health anxiety can become excessive. At an individual level, this can manifest as maladaptive behaviours (repeated medical consultations, avoiding health care even if genuinely ill, hoarding particular items); at a broader societal level, it can lead to mistrust of public authorities and scapegoating of particular populations or groups. The authors underline the need for evidence-based research into health anxiety and its determinants, so that valid individual-and population-level strategies can be developed to minimize it in the face of the COVID-19 pandemic and future outbreaks of a similar nature.",

One of these vividly illustrates the gap between planned services at a given hospital and the actual needs of healthcare workers . This centre had developed a three-pronged approach to address the mental health of their staff: development of an intervention team which would design online materials, implementation of a psychological assistance hotline, and group activities for stress reduction. However, this programme met with reluctance from the healthcare workers themselves. After direct interaction with the workers, this programme was redesigned to include the provision of a rest area, care for basic physical needs such as food, training on the care of COVID-19 patients, information on protective measures, leisure activities, and periodic visits to the rest area by a counsellor. This resulted in greater satisfaction among healthcare workers, and highlights the need for ongoing feedback and modification of such programmes if they are not acceptable to the workers themselves. Liu et al. (2020b) pointed out that mental health professionals may need to work especially closely with those working in critical care units, to minimize stress levels and reduce the risk of depression, while Kang et al.

To date, a single outbreak of COVID-19, affecting around 50 patients and 30 staff, has been reported in a psychiatric hospital, and this was contained by strict quarantine. Reasons for this may have included overcrowding, lack of general medical facilities in psychiatric hospitals, lack of knowledge among mental health professionals, and difficulty in obtaining the cooperation of patients for preventive measures, especially those suffering from psychotic disorders . Conversely, patients with pre-existing mental disorders may be at higher risk of relapse or new episodes of their disorder due to the stress associted with the COVID-19 outbreak (Yao et al., 2020a) . During this period, it is crucial that psychiatrists familiarize themselves with screening and triage procedures, and work closely with physicians and public health specialists to minimize the risks that their patients face .",

This paper identified six important roles for the psychiatrist: a) education of the public about the common psychological effects of a pandemic, b) motivating the public to adopt strategies for disease prevention and health promotion, c) integrating their services with available health care, d) teaching problem-solving strategies to cope with the current crisis, e) empowering patients with COVID-19 and their caregivers, and f) provision of mental health care to healthcare workers (Banerjee, 2020) .",

Such strategies offer the hope of providing mental health services in an easily accessible manner without any increase in infection risk. However, they depend crucially on the availability of trained manpower and infrastructure, and it is not known to what extent these approaches will be accepted by the general public. Moreover, they have not yet been tested or validated in the respective target populations.",

Though the quality of evidence in the available literature is relatively low, it still contains numerous valuable observations and suggestions for all professionals working in this field, whether they are associated with psychiatric or general hospitals or working in the community. As the number of patients affected by this pandemic continues to increase, the psychiatric professionparticularly in Asian countriesfaces both a challenge and an opportunity; the challenge of addressing the numerous barriers and limitations identified in the above literature, but also the opportunity to implement those suggestions or recommendations which are feasible at a local or regional level. The long-term mental health impact of COVID-19 may take weeks or months to become fully apparent, and managing this impact requires concerted effort not just from psychiatrists but from the health care system at large (Maunder, 2009 ). There is a need for further research, even in the form of preliminary or pilot studies, to assess the scope of this pandemic in other countries, particularly in those where mental health infrastructure is less developed and the impact is likely to be more severe (Duan and Zhu, 2020) . Researchers should also attempt to assess the impact of COVID-19 on other vulnerable populations, such as children and adolescents, those in remote or rural areas who face barriers in accessing health care, and those belonging to lower socio-economic strate. Further, there is a need to develop mental health interventions which are time-limited, culturally sensitive, and can be taught to healthcare workers and volunteers. Once developed, such interventions should be tested, so that information regarding effective therapeutic strategies can be widely disseminated among those working in this field.",
