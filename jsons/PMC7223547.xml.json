            "text": "Cancer vaccines aim at inducing T-cell responses against particular antigens which segregate tumor cells from non-malignant cells within an organism. Candidate antigens for such a delicate distinction are either derived from non-synonymous mutations in tumor proteins (e.g. neo-antigenic peptides) or tumor-associated antigens (i.e. non-mutated proteins expressed exclusively or aberrantly in tumor cells). Vaccines can contain antigen as tumor lysate, proteins, DNA/RNA, or long peptides. These formats offer the advantage of presentation on both HLA class I and II molecules after intracellular processing to promote simultaneous CD4+ and CD8+ T-cell responses [1]. Other groups favor mixes of short HLA class I peptides, which bind to membrane-bound HLA class I molecules, do not require processing, and can be synthesized custom tailored for each patient [2]. An inherent problem with cancer antigens is that TCRs with a specificity for tumor-associated peptides have at least one log lower affinity for their target peptide-MHC complex than TCRs with viral specificity [3]. To compensate for this and yet allow appropriate sensing of the applied antigen by the immune system, an optimal presentation of cancer vaccine antigens is mandatory. Chemical adjuvants commonly used in vaccination trials such as alum salts, Montanide, or GM-CSF suffer from substantial shortcomings such as promoting Th2 responses, inducing dysfunctional T-cells or myeloid-derived suppressor cells [2, 4, 5], making the search for better adjuvants a major goal in cancer vaccine development.",

            "text": "Naturally occurring professional antigen-presenting cells such as DCs potentially might overcome many of the drawbacks of synthetic adjuvants. DCs actively exert important vaccine promoting functions in vivo, such as antigen transport via targeted migration into secondary lymphoid organs, longevity, and phenotype stability for at least 3\u20134 days, cross-presentation of ingested antigen to CD8+ T-cells, and secretion of appropriate cytokines at the DC:T synapse, ultimately leading to successful priming of na\u00efve T-cells and memory formation. However, as DCs are a highly versatile cell population, there is no consensus on how to prepare DC precursors for their role in a cancer vaccine. Historically, conventional dendritic cells (CDCs) have been generated from monocyte precursors by inducing differentiation towards an immature DC state with IL-4 and GM-CSF and after antigen loading in the phagocytic stage, maturation with a cytokine-based cocktail containing TNF\u03b1, IL-1\u00df, IL-6 and prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) [6]. However, evidence emerged that some essential functions (e.g. migratory and cytokine secretion capabilities) might be mutually exclusive in monocyte-derived DCs and that PGE2 is a decisive switch in that process [7]. Production of IL-12p70, an important cytokine influencing the properties of CD8+ T- and NK-cells, was found to be impaired by PGE2 [8] and presence of PGE2 during iDC maturation resulted in an IL-10 dependent abrogation of antigen-specific T-cell proliferation [9]. Furthermore, PGE2 can trigger a COX-2-driven positive feedback loop in monocytes and redirect their differentiation into MDSCs [10]. Altogether, these data led to removal of PGE2 from DC maturation cocktails by several groups [11]. In our own brain tumor vaccination program, we have used TNF\u03b1 and IL-1\u00df as maturing agents so far and validated this combination as the standard for generation of clinical-grade DCs under GMP [12, 13].",

            "text": "TLRs are innate receptors on antigen-presenting cells sensing pathogen-associated molecular patterns in antimicrobial defense. Their triggering induces potent activation of DCs, harnessing them with competence for optimal antigen transport and T-cell activation. Combinatorial triggering of the TLR3/4 and TLR7/8/9 subgroups was shown to synergistically activate a type-1 polarizing program for T helper cells together with high IL-12/-23 production and a specific transcriptome in DCs [14] through MyD88-dependent and -independent pathways [15]. TLR-matured DCs exclusively activated CD8+ T-cells with granzyme B/chemokine receptor (CCR-)5 expression and CTL activity [16]. These findings were rapidly translated into DC manufacturing protocols in the cancer vaccine setting. PolyI:C, a TLR3 agonist which mimics viral double stranded RNA (dsRNA), was added to a cytokine-based DC maturation cocktail, resulting in increased IL-12p70 production by DCs and a superior induction of melanoma-specific CTL responses [17]. Enhanced stimulation of tumor-specific T-cells was achieved when polyI:C and R848 (Resiquimod, a synthetic low-molecular-weight agonist of TLR7/8) were combined with LPS, the classical TLR4-ligand [18]. Furthermore, researchers were interested to analyze whether the combined use of TLR-agonists and PGE2 was able to generate DCs with both cytokine-secreting and migratory capabilities. Boullard et al. investigated the effect of adding PGE2 to polyI:C and R848 on DC phenotype, migratory capacity, IL-12p70 production, and T-cell cytokine secretion. They concluded that the combination of TLR3&7/8 agonists with PGE2 (TLR-P) results in DCs with improved migratory capacity and maintained IL-12p70 production [19]. However, important DC functions such as DC:T interactions were not assessed in that report. Here, we compare our extensively validated TNF\u03b1/IL-1\u00df cytokine combination, already used in clinical trials, with the proposed polyI:C/R848/PGE2 cocktail with a special focus on the interaction of resulting DCs with CD8+ T-cells. We confirm previous data that TLR-P matured DCs exhibit a mature phenotype and robust migratory and cytokine-secreting abilities. Furthermore, CDCs and TLR-P DCs are equally able to successfully prime antigen-specific CD8+ T-cell responses against tumor-associated antigens. However, we show for the first time that PGE2 might impair cross-presentation of protein antigens to CD8+ T cells in human DCs in a dose-dependent fashion. Our data have implications for choosing the optimal DC maturation cocktail, which should be adapted to the type of antigen used in a cancer vaccine.",

DCs were generated as previously described [12]: monocytes were purified by CD14-MACS as recommended by the manufacturer (Miltenyi Biotec, Germany). Sorted cells were resuspended in CellGro DC medium (CellGenix, Freiburg, Germany) containing 1vol% HSA at a concentration of 1.5 \u00d7 106 cells/ml and plated on tissue culture flask (Nunclon\u2122 Delta, Thermo Fisher Scientific). For differentiation of monocytes into immature DCs (iDCs) IL-4 (1000 U/ml) and GM-CSF (1000 U/ml) were used for 5 days (both from CellGenix). Fresh medium and cytokines were added on days 2 and 4. On day 5, DC maturation was induced by addition of either TNF\u03b1 (1000 U/ml) and IL-1\u00df (2000 U/ml) (cocktail 1) or R848 (3 \u03bcg/ml, Invivogen), Poly I:C (20 \u03bcg/ml. Sigma-Aldrich), and PGE2 (10 \u00b5g/ml, Sigma-Aldrich) (cocktail 2). The main objective of this study was to compare the impact of these two protocols on DC maturation. In some selected experiments, PGE2 was omitted or dose-modified to highlight the role of this substance in the TLR-cocktail. After 16\u201348 h maturation, viable mature DCs (mDCs) were harvested by putting on ice for 20 min, repeatedly rinsed with cold PBS) pooled if DCs from the same donor and condition were cultured in separate wells, counted, and analyzed for further assays (see below). General yield of mature DCs from the starting monocyte population in this assay was 51.4% (35.2\u201380.6) (median and range, data not shown). DCs for experiments on phenotype, migration, and cytokine secretion were matured for 48 h as in the index publication [19]. For T-cell experiments, a 16 h DC maturation period was strongly recommended in the original publications [20, 21], and backed by our own data. Thus, for T-cell priming and cross-presentation experiments, a 16 h maturation period was chosen. Furthermore, to investigate the longevity and phenotype stability of matured DCs, we extended the culture period in some experiments for another 6 days. During this extended culture, DCs were washed and received only low-dose IL-4 and GM-CSF (250 U/ml) to avoid DC starvation but no further maturing agents.",

            "text": "Many cancer patients do not harbor pre-existing T-cell responses against tumor-associated antigens. Thus, de novo T-cell priming is of pivotal importance for functionality of cancer vaccines. To test the differential ability of our DCs to prime T-cells, we established an in vitro priming assay, in which highly purified na\u00efve CD8+ T-cells are primed against peptide-loaded autologous DCs and subsequently expanded. As described in the original publication, LPS/IFN\u03b3-matured DCs served as a positive control and all assays included the heteroclitic Melan-A26-35L peptide, which usually gives high-frequency responses [20]. To represent also antigens with lower precursor frequencies, we chose the previously described, glioma-associated NLGN4X131-139 and PTP1347-1355 peptides [23]. As shown in Fig. 3a (left graph), all three types of DCs induced high-frequency Melan-A26-35L responses, whereas the two glioma peptides resulted in substantially lower, but detectable CD8+ T-cell responses. No significant differences in terms of primed MHC-multimer+ T-cells between differently matured DC populations could be detected. Likewise, TLR-P DCs tended to induce greater proliferation of T cells compared to CDCs (Fig. 3a right graph). In line with the known high precursor frequency of Melan-A26-35L reactive T-cells in the na\u00efve compartment (approximately 0.1%, i.e. 1/103), all wells contained Melan-A26-35L specific T-cells, whereas for NLGN4X131-139 and PTP1347-1355 only a fraction of 10\u201346% of wells contained positive cells (Fig. 3b), resulting in a minimal na\u00efve precursor T-cell frequency of at least 1/1.2 \u00d7 106 for NLGN4X131-139 and 1/2.04 \u00d7 106 for PTP1347-1355. Due to limiting cells numbers, TCR avidity of induced T-cells could only be assayed for Melan-A-specific T-cells. To test this, harvested T-cells from day 10 were restimulated with autologous monocytes pulsed with titrated peptide dosages from \u00b5g- to pg-ranges. We found no difference in the TNF\u03b1- or IFN\u03b3-cytokine responsiveness of T-cells primed by differently matured DC subgroups (Fig. 3c). The phenotype of the whole expanded T-cell pool on day 10 showed a trend for more effector T-cells with the TLR-matured DCs: starting from a homogenous na\u00efve T-cell population, CD62L and CD45RA were subsequently downregulated and most T-cells were in na\u00efve-memory transition after 10 days of expansion under these conditions (Fig. 3d). Gating on the primed MHC-multimer+ T-cells, we found that the expression of the CD49d/CD29 heterodimer (VLA-4), which represents a key homing receptor for CNS tissues significantly differed between T-cells induced by differently matured DCs. VLA-4 expression was more abundant on MHC-multimer+ than on MHC-multimer\u2212 T-cells and was higher after T-cell stimulation with TLR-matured DCs (Fig. 3e). In conclusion, all three DC populations were able to prime antigen-specific CD8+ T-cells from antigens with low and intermediate precursor frequency. We were not able to detect significant differences regarding frequency and TCR avidity of T-cells resulting from priming with the three DC subpopulations, however, on the phenotype level, TLR-matured DCs tended to induce more effector T-cells with higher VLA-4 expression.",

            "text": "Finally, we wanted to investigate whether the different DC maturation cocktails affect the ability of DCs to cross-present phagocytosed material to CD8+ T-cells. To this end, we incubated iDCs in the phagocytic stage with the full length CMVpp65 protein, and matured them afterwards using the different cocktails. The ability of these differentially matured DCs to stimulate CMVpp65-specific polyfunctional (TNF\u03b1+IFN\u03b3+) CD8+ T-cell responses was tested by co-incubating them with three different responder T-cell populations: either two CMVpp65-specific T-cell lines generated in our own lab or a CMVpp65 clone (kindly provided by F. Falkenburg and I. Jedema, Leiden). HLA-A*02+ donors with a clearly detectable CD8+CMV-MHC-multimer+ population were used to generate two T-cell lines with a final CMV specificity of > 75% (Fig. 4a). CD141+ (BDCA-3) DCs isolated from peripheral blood of HLA-A*02:01 donors were chosen as a positive control, as these DCs are considered to be the human APC population with most potent cross-presenting and T-cell stimulating function [24]. Further positive controls included peptide loaded DCs and PMA/Ionomycin stimulated T-cells (not shown), negative controls unloaded DCs, unstimulated T cells as well as CD8+ responder T-cells from CMV-seronegative donors (Fig. 4c). Unloaded DCs did not stimulate CMV-specific responses, ruling out endogenous expression of CMVpp65 antigen by our DCs. As illustrated in Fig. 4b+c, CD141+ DCs most effectively cross-presented the CMVpp65 protein, yielding the highest frequency of CD8+IFN\u03b3+TNF\u03b1+ T-cells (these values were subsequently defined as 100%). As expected, peptide-loaded DCs tended to result in slightly higher cytokine production, cross-presenting CDCs also gave non-inferior results. In contrast, TLR-P DCs showed significantly lower frequencies of CD8+IFN\u03b3+TNF\u03b1+ T-cells compared both to their CDC counterparts as well as their internal peptide controls (Fig. 4b+c). This effect was reproducible in all three T-cell responder populations. To pinpoint the effect of PGE2 in that assay, we excluded PGE2 from the TLR-P-cocktail. Omission of PGE2 restored cross-presenting function of TLR-matured DCs back to normal levels. Furthermore, titration of PGE2 in the maturation cocktail from 10 ng/ml to 10 \u00b5g/ml demonstrated that this effect of PGE2 was dose-dependent (Fig. 4d). These data indicate that PGE2 specifically inhibits cross-presentation of protein antigen to CD8+ T-cells in human TLR-matured DCs.",

            "text": "Manufacturing of DCs under GMP conditions for use as a clinical-grade cancer vaccine aims at generating a homogenous cell population fulfilling predefined specifications with a Th1-promoting profile. In vitro conditions shield the cells from potentially harmful factors in a cancer-bearing host, and the manufacturing process should be adapted to the type of antigen used in the vaccine, e.g. RNA-transfected DCs should not be matured with polyI:C as this might hinder protein translation [25]. TNF\u03b1 and IL-1\u00df are frequently used as the basic cytokine combination to induce pathway committed DCs, which are pro-inflammatory and migratory but still have capacity to mature further in vivo [12], e.g. by preparation of the injection site with proinflammatory substances such as imiquimod [11]. Our phenotypic data, showing that TLR-P DCs exhibit significantly higher maturation marker expression such as CD80 and CD83 than CDCs are in line with this and confirm previous reports that TLR-agonists induce full maturation in myeloid DCs [18, 26]. This fully mature phenotype was associated with a faster decline of DC numbers after prolonged in vitro culture, which can be explained with the higher amount of IL-10 produced by TLR-P DCs. Endogenous IL-10 production in TLR-matured myeloid DCs was demonstrated to inhibit accumulation of anti-apoptotic Bcl-2, which limits DC longevity [27]. Although the phenotype of DCs seemed to be rather stable over time, we cannot exclude a possible dedifferentiation of DCs e.g. into macrophages especially under the influence of IL-10. Notably, with the exception of MCP-1, all analyzed cytokine levels were higher after TLR-P maturation, which reached significance for IL-6, IL-8, IL-10, and IL-12p35/40, however, the IL-12p35/40/IL-10 ratio remained always positive. As expected, IL-12p70 production was greatly enhanced after TLR-P maturation [15, 28, 29], whereas in CDCs and iDCs, IL-12p70 remained below the detection limit. Although PGE2 is known to reduce IL-12p70 production in DCs via a cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP-)dependent inhibition of the IL-12p40 subunit [30, 31], our TLR-P DCs still produced substantial amounts of IL-12p70, suggesting that the TLR-stimulus sufficiently compensates for the inhibitory PGE2 effect. Furthermore, considering migration times of 24 h from skin to the draining lymph node [32] and a relatively preserved IL12p70 production after 48 h, we postulate that TLR-P DCs injected after 16 h maturation will still be able to secrete active IL-12p70 at the DC:CD8+ interface in the lymph node.",

The assay worked for tumor-associated peptides with an intermediate (Melan-A) and low (NLGNX and PTP) T-cell precursor frequency within the na\u00efve T-cell repertoire, although the excellent MHC-binding affinity of the two latter glioma peptides (200\u2013300 fold higher than for Melan-A26-35L, according to the NetMHC4.0 algorithm) might also have contributed to optimal T-cell priming. Although the presence of IL-12 (which was secreted by our TLR-matured DCs) during priming can result in high avidity T cells [33], we could not observe differences in T-cell avidity after our priming assay with the caveat that this was an in vitro system only. An in vivo animal model has demonstrated that IL-12 deficient mice can mount protective CTL responses, when DCs were licensed by CD4 T-cell help, suggesting that DCs are able to use IL-12-independent pathways to prime na\u00efve T cells [34]. Overall, methodologies which have demonstrated a benefit for T-cell function after contact with TLR-matured DCs varied substantially, ranging from increased allospecific proliferation of splenocytes [15, 35] to augmented IFN\u03b3-production of TCR-transduced T-cells after cognate antigen contact [18], making a clear conclusion difficult. Watchmaker et al. reported that all DCs subtypes in their study were able to expand CD8+ T cells, but only type-1 polarized DCs induced Granzyme B and the peripheral tissue chemokines CCR7 and CCL5 on CD8+ T-cells. These findings are consistent with our data, showing similar frequencies of MHC-multimer+ CD8+ T cells but subtle differences in phenotype (effector T-cells) and integrin (VLA-4) expression. Therefore, we hypothesize that TLR-P DCs might confer the functional advantage of higher VLA-4 expression, which represents an important CNS-homing receptor, to primed CD8+ T-cells. Notably, in vivo administration of the TLR3-agonist, poly-ICLC also promoted VLA-expression on vaccine reactive CTLs [36].",

            "text": "A central finding of our study is that cross-presentation of protein antigens to CD8+ T-cell lines was diminished in TLR-P DCs, a process that was dose-dependent and required the presence of PGE2 during maturation. Ahmadi et al. had reported that in murine DCs the presence of PGE2 during differentiation and maturation resulted in a defective DC phenotype ultimately leading to abortive CD8+ activation. PGE2 is a member of a group of eicosanoids with pleiotropic effects on immune cells which are both context and dose-dependent [37]. In immune cells, PGE2 acts predominantly via the high-affinity EP2- and the low-affinity EP4-receptor [38]. In accordance with our data, triggering of the EP4-receptor at concentrations > 50 nM usually results in IL-12 and IL-23 reduction [39]. To the best of our knowledge, the biochemical pathways of PGE2 to interfere with antigen cross-presentation have not been described yet and require further mechanistic studies. It should be noted however, that we tested only soluble proteins for cross-presentation. Larger, particulate antigen, e.g. bigger fragments of tumor lysate might be handled differently, as uptake and allocation to intracellular compartments of antigens of distinct size and consistency follows different pathways [40].",

            "text": "In contrast to these latter findings, the pivotal role of PGE2 in augmenting DC migratory capabilities, mediated through activation of the CCR7 promotor via the p38/MAPK pathway, is well documented [7, 41, 42]. Although we and others have shown that PGE2 strongly enhances the CCR7-dependent in vitro migratory capacity in a dose-dependent way, in vivo this effect might be rapidly counteracted by CCR7-downregulation in CCL19-rich environments [43]. Indeed, imaging studies failed to demonstrate a benefit for accumulation of PGE2-matured DCs in secondary lymphoid organs [43, 44], making it uncertain whether this in vitro effect will translate into a clinical benefit. One limitation of our study is that all our readout assays were separate in vitro experiments. With these alone, the resulting net effect in vivo is difficult to predict. Therefore, further preclinical in vivo models are needed to assess the effects of PGE2 on migration, CTL priming, and cross-presentation of a DC-based cancer vaccine.",

            "text": "Sustained CD8+ effector T-cell responses, the aim of each cancer vaccine, require CD4+ T-cell help [45, 46], ideally from the same epitope, which can only be achieved when the antigen (synthetic long peptides or proteins) is processed intracellularly by DCs and the resulting peptide fragments are presented on both MHC class I and II molecules [47]. In contrast, for short peptides, loading on pre-activated DCs was the best way to induce protective antitumor CTL responses [48]. Therefore, as one possible conclusion from our study, for DCs intended to be loaded exogenously with short peptides the TLR-P combination might be the right choice for maturation as suggested by Boullard et al. and others [19, 25], since TLR-P DCs are fully mature, produce IL-12p70, successfully prime CD8+VLA-4+ T cells, and show superior migratory capabilities. More caution is warranted when the vaccine antigen requires intracellular processing before presentation. In these cases, CDCs might be the better choice, as cross-presenting functions are preserved and yet these DCs express costimulatory markers, exhibit targeted migration, and successfully prime na\u00efve CD8+ T cells as well. Alternatively, PGE2 in nanomolar concentrations could improve migratory functions while leaving no significant impact on cross-presentation. Thus, our data highlight an important new aspect of how different agents during maturation can impact DC functionality.",
