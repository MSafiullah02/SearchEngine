However, regular laboratory tests and radiographic results have poor ability to differentiate viral pneumonia patients with or without bacterial coinfections [6\u20138]. Thus, identifying biology markers to early and effectively discriminate these two circumstances is necessary for deciding whether antibiotics should be used or not. To date, some inflammatory biomarkers such as interleukin- (IL-) 6, high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hs-CRP), and more recently, procalcitonin (PCT) are widely mentioned as potential mediators for diagnosing inflammatory illnesses [9, 10, 20]. PCT has been used in several guidelines to manage antibiotic use in children with respiratory diseases [11, 12] because a high level of serum PCT concentration frequently occurs in those with bacterial or parasitic infections [13].",

These two methods were performed according to the principle of light intensity reduction: the optical system used visible light to directly monitor the growth of microorganisms through the measurement of the intensity of the blocked light (or attenuation of light intensity) when light passes through a well.

            "text": "In literature, serum PCT, hs-CRP, and IL-6 concentration have been used widely to differentiate patients suffering viral respiratory diseases alone and those with bacterial coinfections [9, 10, 20]. Most of the studies found that PCT was dominant in differentiating viral and bacterial infections compared to hs-CRP and IL-6 [9, 10, 19, 20]. Our finding in this study was in line with these previous works when we found that the accuracy rate of PCT was higher than that of IL-6 and hs-CRP. In addition, clinical symptoms and other laboratory test measures were not sufficient for diagnosing bacterial coinfections, which aligned with previous findings [6\u20138]. Serum PCT concentration above 2.25 ng/ml could detect bacterial coinfections more effectively, which can be applied in emergency cases. However, Laham et al. [20] and Baer et al. [21] found that some infants with pneumonia did not detect bacterial coinfections even when they had the highest value of PCT. This result was similar to another study in severe acute respiratory syndrome caused by SARS-CoV-2 virus [22] which suggested that antibiotic use might not be necessary for patients with high PCT. Therefore, in order to use antibiotic appropriately, further tests to confirm the existence of bacterial coinfection should be performed. Nonetheless, although PCT alone cannot be used to decide which antibiotics should be utilized, this is a vital marker that clinicians should require when making a decision rather than based on radiographic or blood cell count findings. Therefore, developing a rapid bedside PCT test is crucial in managing children experiencing severe RSV pneumonia.",
