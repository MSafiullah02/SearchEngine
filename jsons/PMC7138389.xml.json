Le Goff [1] described Chemical Engineering (ChE) as an ensemble of separation and reaction processes to transform raw materials into useful products (Fig. 1\n). At that time we were living with the Second Paradigm of ChE \u2013 the Engineering Science movement represented by the book of Bird, Stewart and Lightfoot, \u201cTransport Phenomena\u201d published in 1960 [2]. The First Paradigm was around the concept of Unit Operation, a term coined by Arthur D. Little in 1915 [3]. It is interesting to note that in this \u201cold\u201d vision of ChE, Le Goff already emphasized the connections with Environment (waste generation and management), Energy and Market (Economy).",

Everyone knows that a good adsorbent should have good adsorption capacity, fast adsorption kinetics, good selectivity, and good thermal, mechanical and chemical stability. However translating these properties in numbers is trickier. Metrics based on Working Capacity (WC), Adsorbent Figure of Merit (AFM), Capture Figure of Merit (CFM) etc. have been presented but in my opinion the metrics only make sense for a defined process in which the material will be used [[18], [19], [20]]. A good summary of adsorbent metrics can be found in reference [19]. The selectivity requirement for an adsorbent for Pressure Swing Adsorption (PSA) is not the same as that needed for use with Simulated Moving Bed (SMB) technology [21].

Later I moved to capture of CO2 from flue gases using various adsorbents such as 13X zeolites, carbon materials, binderless zeolites in different shapes (monoliths, beads, extrudates) using cyclic adsorption technologies as Pressure Swing Adsorption (PSA), Vacuum Swing Adsorption (VSA), Temperature Swing adsorption (TSA), Electric Swing Adsorption (ESA).

One may need to increase the capacity of the plant and be limited by the boiler capacity; in such case a fraction of the black liquor can be taken to produce chemicals such as vanillin or syringaldehyde depending on the wood source. In our lab, we developed an integrated process shown in Fig. 10\n[40] involving first lignin oxidation followed by membrane separation of low molecular weight compounds from the degraded lignin, which can be sent to the boiler or used to make polyurethane foams. The permeate stream is sent to adsorption columns were a clear separation by families: acids, aldehydes, ketones is achieved (Fig. 11\n) [41]. Proper elution allows enriched fractions of the compounds of interest and finally extraction/crystallization processes lead to the final product (vanillin or syringaldehyde) [42].
