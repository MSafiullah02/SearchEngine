It has since been detected worldwide (2) (3) (4) (5) (6) (7) , including the People's Republic of China (8) , but whether it is a causative respiratory pathogen remains speculative. To investigate the potential role of WUPyV in respiratory diseases and its prevalence in Tianjin, China, we examined samples obtained from children with upper respiratory tract infections (UR-TIs) and lower respiratory tract infections (LRTIs) by using PCR for the VP2 and LTAg genes, as described previously (1) . As a control, we also tested samples from patients who did not have respiratory diseases.",

Although we showed a co-infection rate of 71.4%, there were 8 (28.6%) of 28 patients with respiratory illness in whose specimens we detected only 1 virus, WUPyV. No WUPyV was detected in samples from 43 control patients, whereas in patients with LRTIs and URTIs, infection rates were 16.1% and 4.4%, respectively. These fi ndings suggest WUPyV may be a potential pathogenic agent in children with acute respiratory tract infections. More comprehensive case-control investigations are needed to determine the association of WUPyV infections with respiratory diseases.
