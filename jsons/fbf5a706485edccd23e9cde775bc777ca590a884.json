The ongoing outbreaks of Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) infection and epidemic waves of avian influenza A(H7N9) since their emergence in 2012 and 2013, respectively, have raised global concern in recent years. The huge clinical burden of common respiratory viruses, such as respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) and seasonal influenza, on healthcare resources and utilization highlights the importance for developing more effective treatment modalities in order to reduce morbidity and mortality. In this contemporary concise review, articles related to these common respiratory infections and TB published recently in Respirology and selected articles published in other journals that highlight advances in knowledge are summarized.",

Brealey et al. 1 identified an association between co-detection of RSV and Streptococcus pneumoniae and more severe disease in a Brisbane-based cohort of young children aged under 2 years with acute RTI, suggesting the bacteria may play a pathogenic role in these young children. Their findings may potentially have major implications for the management of young children with acute RTI in determining whether hospitalization is required and in directing the appropriate use of antibiotics, in addition to understanding factors involved in the development of asthma and new pathways of immunomodulation. 2 ",

            "text": "The complex interaction of climate change, socioeconomic factors and human migration patterns has led to changing patterns of respiratory infections in tropical climate but also increasingly in temperate countries. Tropical and poorer countries, especially South East Asia, account for almost one-third of the global burden of TB pandemic. In addition to TB, Lim and Siow 3 have emphasized that in tropical countries, the spectrum of pathogens with pneumonia includes diseases such as melioidosis, scrub typhus, leptospirosis, hanta virus, chikungunya, dengue and parasitic pneumonias. Clinicians must be aware of the possible aetiology of pneumonia in the locality of practice and not solely dependent on published treatment guidelines. 4 Up to 30% of patients hospitalized for CAP develop cardiovascular complications (such as new onset or worsening cardiac failure or arrhythmias, myocardial infarctions and cerebrovascular accidents) in the acute phase and even up to 10 years thereafter. Cardiac complications result from complex interactions between co-morbid conditions, upregulation of the sympathetic system, relative ischaemia, systemic inflammation and direct pathogen-mediated damage to the cardiovascular system. These mechanisms could provide the target of future therapeutic intervention to reduce incidence of cardiovascular complications and improve outcomes in patients with CAP. 5 A significant increase in human blood VEGF-A is associated with early resolution of VAP; VEGF-A was an independent predictor of resolution despite disease severity. Experimental chronic pulmonary infection by Pseudomonas aeruginosa in the mice model led to increased VEGF-A concentrations in the lungs and yet a reciprocal reduction of pro-inflammatory cytokines and myeloperoxidase activity. Further clinical and mechanistic studies are required to define the role of VEGF-A as a marker of resolution of lung inflammation in VAP. 6 The standardized approach to treatment makes CAP a target for comparative performance and outcome measures. Hadfield and Bennet 7 discussed clinical-and patient-reported outcomes, including endpoints such as the time to clinical stability and patient satisfaction, and strategies to improve these outcomes including use of a risk stratification tool, local antimicrobial guidelines with antibiotic stewardship and care bundles to include early administration of antibiotics and early mobilization. Interestingly, the provision of procalcitonin assay results to emergency department and hospital-based clinicians did not result in less use of antibiotics than did usual care among patients with suspected lower RTI in a randomized controlled trial (RCT) involving 14 hospital sites in the USA. 8 There are limited published data evaluating the effects of antibiotic in CAP according to the DRP risk. In a post hoc analysis of a prospective multicentre cohort of patients with CAP, Okumura et al. 9 have shown that \u03b2-lactam and macrolide in combination reduced the 30-day mortality (adjusted odds ratio: 0.28, 95% CI: 0.09-0.87) compared with \u03b2-lactam alone. In addition, among patients at low risk for CAP-DRP, independent host factors associated with mortality included high arterial carbon dioxide (PaCO 2 ) level, non-ambulatory status, leucopenia, low haematocrit, older age, tachypnoea, low serum albumin level and low body temperature. These factors should be evaluated in future clinical trials in patients with low CAP-DRP risk for stratification to assess antibiotic effects. In an accompanying editorial, Waterer 10 emphasized the importance of starting a macrolide early followed a short time later by a third-generation cephalosporin, preferably all within 2 h of presentation to hospital.",

            "text": "It is difficult to forecast the timing, size and severity of influenza seasons despite advances in surveillance system. 16 NAI has been the mainstay of treatment for seasonal and avian influenza but its effectiveness is limited by delay of patient presentation for management. 17 Early treatment of patients with avian influenza A(H7N9) in Zhejiang, China, within 2-5 days from illness onset with an NAI can reduce mortality. 18 Of the 20 patients, 3 (15%) patients who had received NAI within 2 days died versus 12 of 52 (23.1%) patients who received treatment within 2-5 days versus 33 of 88 (37.5%) patients who were treated after 5 days (P < 0.05). The median durations of viral shedding from NAI therapy initiation was 4.5 days (interquartile range (IQR): 3-9 days) for patients who took NAI within 2 days, which was significantly shorter than that for those who took NAI within 2-5 days (7.5 days (IQR: 4.25-12.75 days)) or after 5 days (7 days (IQR: 5-10 days)) (P < 0.05). 18 Introduction of a bivalent H7/H5 vaccination of poultry in mainland China in October 2017 has resulted in better control of A(H7N9) outbreaks, with detection of only three human cases from October 2017 to September 2018, and a corresponding reduction of A(H7N9) viruses detected in poultry and environmental samples of A(H7N9) in China. 19 Baloxavir marboxil is a selective inhibitor of influenza virus cap-dependent endonuclease, with therapeutic activity in preclinical models of influenza A and B virus infections, including strains resistant to current antiviral agents. Early treatment with a single-dose baloxavir was superior to placebo in alleviating influenza symptoms (in patients 20-64 years of age (median difference: 25.6 h) and among those 12-19 years of age (median difference: 38.6 h)). In addition, baloxavir was superior to both oseltamivir and placebo in reducing the viral load 1 day after initiation of treatment in patients aged 12-64 years with uncomplicated influenza, although there was no significant difference in the median time to alleviation of symptoms between baloxavir and oseltamivir recipients. However, there was emergence of mutant viruses with the development of decreased susceptibility to baloxavir after treatment in a small percentage of cases. 20 The therapeutic role of baloxavir in older or immunocompromised patients with severe seasonal or avian A(H7N9) influenza especially with some time delay in administration of the drug later in the clinical course of the infection or in combination with an NAI requires investigation. 21 Lee et al. 22 have found significant anti-inflammatory effects with adjunctive macrolide treatment in adults with severe influenza infections, although virus RNA decline was unaffected. The role of adjunctive immunomodulating agents for patients with severe influenza deserves further investigation. 23 ",

            "text": "Bacillary resistance to TB drugs continues to emerge. About 3.5% of new TB cases and 18% of previously treated cases in 2017 were MDR-/RR-TB, while 8.5% of MDR-TB cases were extensively drug-resistant (XDR-)TB. 24 Standardized treatment regimens, while having facilitated programmatic implementation, could have inadvertently accelerated the development of MDR-TB and XDR-TB through progressive selection of resistant mutants. 33, 35 The standardized 9-to 12-month shorter MDR-TB regimen showed marginally less favourable outcome (78% vs 81%) than the conventional 18-to 24-month regimen in the preliminary results of the STREAM Stage 1 Trial. 36 In some MDR-TB hotspots such as Eastern Europe, South East Asia, Pakistan and Brazil, the high prevalence of resistance to one or more of the drugs used in the shorter regimen may render 50-96% of MDR-TB patients ineligible for the regimen by the strict drug susceptibility criteria. 33 Partly based on an updated meta-analysis of observational data in the treatment of MDR-TB, 37 the World Health Organization proposed reclassification of TB drugs used in the longer conventional regimen for MDR-TB into three different categories in August 2018. 38 Group A drugs, including levofloxacin/moxifloxacin, bedaquiline and linezolid, are to be prioritized. Group B drugs, including clofazimine and cycloserine/terizidone, are to be added next. Group C drugs (ethambutol, delamanid, pyrazinamide, imipenemcilastatin, meropenem, amikacin/streptomycin, ethionamide/prothionamide and p-aminosalicylic acid) are included when drugs from Groups A and B cannot be used. With the favourable outcomes achievable by the optimized background regimens in the treatment of MDR-TB in both the STREAM Stage 1 Trial (81%) 36 and Delamanid Trial 213 (78%), 39 the need for the relatively toxic drug, linezolid, and the expensive new drug, bedaquiline, with very short and incompletely established safety record, remains to be established, at least for fluoroquinolone-susceptible MDR-TB. 27 Ageing and co-morbidities Yew et al., in their review of the epidemiological, clinical and mechanistic perspectives of TB in older people, highlighted the increasing clinical and public health challenge posed by TB in the ageing population in many Asian countries. 40 The complex interactions among oxidative stress, mitochondrial dysfunction and immunological dysfunction may contribute to the development of TB in the geriatric population and worsen the disease outcomes, especially in presence of co-morbid conditions such as smoking and diabetes mellitus. In a 1:1 propensity score-matched analysis of data from a longitudinal health insurance database in Taiwan, Lin et al. showed 76% reduction in TB risk among 5026 diabetic patients put on metformin as compared with 5026 non-metformin users, after adjusting for co-morbidities, diabetic complications, anti-diabetic therapy type and statin use. 41 In another longitudinal study from the same locality, 42 metformin users were associated with 44% reduction in mortality during TB treatment despite their higher haemoglobin A1c level. The protective effect of metformin therefore appears independent of diabetic control. While the sizeable protective effects of metformin in the abovementioned studies suggest a potential role of the drug as host-directed therapy in the treatment of latent TB infection and active TB, randomized trials are need to delineate its exact role(s) before introduction into clinical practices. 43 Park et al. retrospectively reviewed the data of 1784 patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) in the Korean COPD Subtype Study cohort. 44 The COPD assessment test (CAT) scores, total St George's Respiratory Questionnaire for COPD (SGRQc) scores and exacerbation prevalence were significantly higher, and lung function was significantly poorer in COPD patients with prior TB than those without, both at the baseline and on follow-up over 3 years. Poorer lung function was observed among patients with prior TB, irrespective of whether they had visible lung lesions on chest radiographs.",

However, the risks of other adverse effects (e.g. systemic or hypersensitivity reactions to rifamycins) [47] [48] [49] remain considerable relative to the number of TB cases averted. A targeted approach is therefore necessary to optimize the benefit versus risk ratio at the expense of reduced population coverage. 27 Despite the higher risk of TB infection among household contacts, household transmission accounts only for a small portion of the overall transmission in the ongoing TB epidemic. 50 The safety of rifapentine in pregnancy remains to be established even though no excess risks of foetal loss or congenital anomalies were observed among pregnant women inadvertently exposed to either isoniazid or isoniazid plus rifapentine in two clinical trials. 51",

The S glycoprotein is the critical component for binding the host-cell receptor, dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP-4), in order to initiate infection. (Reproduced from Zumla et al, 54 with permission)",
