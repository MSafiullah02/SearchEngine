            "text": "Religious events and festivals are types of mass gathering that draw large numbers of pilgrims from a large geographical region and people around the globe [1,2]. The annual Hajj pilgrimage to Makkah in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia (KSA) attracts more than 2 million pilgrims from 184 countries around the world [1]. The climatic conditions and the inevitable overcrowding of pilgrims in Makkah and surrounding holy sites during the Hajj rituals create a situation that may promote the occurrence and spread of communicable diseases and possibly the spread of multi-drug resistance (MDR) bacteria [1,[3], [4], [5], [6], [7], [8], [9]]. Thus, the spread of respiratory illnesses during the Hajj is a major public health concerns with the potential of dissemination of these infectious diseases beyond the Hajj itself [[10], [11], [12]]. Risk factors for such an event to occur include close proximity between pilgrims, crowded accommodation, and congregation [1,6]. Studies had shown that respiratory tract infections occur commonly among the majority of pilgrims [10,13]. Also, it is estimated that more than 90% of pilgrims develop what is known as the \u201cHajj cough\u201d during their stay in KSA [[14], [15], [16]]. Many studies showed that a variety of upper and lower respiratory tract infections due to viral and bacterial infections can cause infections among pilgrims [[3], [4], [5],10,[17], [18], [19], [20], [21]]. A range of respiratory viruses were recovered from pilgrims, with influenza and rhinovirus the most common [10]. In this review, we summarize the available data about emerging respiratory viruses, including Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus (MERS-CoV), Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS), and other respiratory viruses such as influenza. We also discuss here the possible role of Streptococcus pneumoniae coinfection.",

In total, six studies investigated the prevalence of H1N1 virus among pilgrims [27,[32], [33], [34], [36],36] and one study was conducted among healthcare workers at the pilgrimage sites [57] (Table 4\n). During the 2009 Hajj season, the prevalence of H1N1 virus among 275 symptomatic Iranian pilgrims was 1.8% [27]. However, none of the 184 screened healthcare workers was infected [57]. A large cross sectional study of 2699 departing pilgrims showed that 0.1% of them were positive for H1N1 virus [34]. Two other studies have also founded prevalence of 1.6% [33] and 1.8% [27], but none of the 551 Egyptian pilgrims survived in another study were positive for H1N1 virus [32].",

In addition, the acquisition of MERS-CoV remains very limited and systematic screening of pilgrims showed no infections. MERS-CoV is absent in all Hajj pilgrims tested so far. Different methods were used for the diagnosis of respiratory pathogens and included: PCR, culture methods and ELISA. The ease and rapidity of PCR method make this method an attractive method for further use in subsequent studies to detect respiratory viruses. Interestingly, it appears that some viruses are more prone to transmission during Hajj (influenza and Rhinoviruses). The difference in the transmission could be related to a predominant aerial transmission for Influenza and Rhinoviruses whereas other (less prevalent) could rely on direct contact (hands carry-over). Camels were not allowed in the Hajj areas due to the risk of MERS-CoV transmission and this strategy may further decrease the risk of MERS-CoV transmission. Different respiratory viruses might be acquired during the Hajj and these viruses might be introduced into pilgrims' home countries upon their return, thus contributing to the potential for international spread of these viruses.",

Vaccination is not so easy due to regulation on seasonal vaccine availability [65]. In addition, non-pharmacological preventive measures are needed for the prevention of respiratory infections during the Hajj: maintaining good infection control practice among healthcare workers, the use of face masks or respirators, and hand hygiene [66,67]. The majority of viral respiratory infections acquired during pilgrimage are due to influenza viruses, and rhinoviruses [64]. The diagnosis of seasonal influenza during the hajj was a major focus of most studies addressing the prevalence of respiratory viruses among pilgrims [23,25,[32], [33], [34], [36], [39], [40], [43], [56], [68], [69], [70], [71], [72], [73], [74], [75], [76], [77], [78], [79], [80],36,39,40,43,56,[68], [69], [70], [71], [72], [73], [74], [75], [76], [77], [78], [79], [80]]. In these studies, different methods were used to detect respiratory viruses, with PCR being the most common used method. There are multiple contributing factors for the transmission and acquisition of respiratory viruses during the Hajj and include the crowdedness, close proximity, and indoor or outdoor venue [80].",

However, different studies showed very low rate of acquisition of this virus during the 2009 Hajj. Also, the emergence of SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV was of major concerns for mass gatherings such as the Hajj [2,5]. However, to date neither SARS-CoV nor MERS-CoV was found to be transmitted among pilgrims. Systematic screening for MERS-COV among returning or departing pilgrims showed no positive cases [5,14,15,[29], [30], [31], [35], [37], [38], [39], [60], [61], [63],35,[37], [38], [39], [60], [61], [63],60,61,63]. However, four cases were linked to Umrah (also known as the lesser pilgrimage) [69,[83], [84], [85], [86]]. It was estimated that the risk MERS-CoV transmission among pilgrims could be 1\u20137 cases per Hajj season and 3\u201310 per Umrah per year [87].",

Despite extensive systematic screening, MERS-CoV had not been isolated from pilgrims. Continued surveillance for MERS-CoV is needed to ensure timely detection of any possible imported MERS cases [8,9,64]. Differential transmission of different viruses may play a role in the observed frequencies. Understanding these factors facilitate the development of preventive measures. Further paired prospective studies using a systematic evaluation of pilgrims for these viruses are needed in order to estimate the total burden of viral respiratory diseases during the Hajj. International collaboration would foster evidence-based practices and guidelines for implementation during mass gathering events [10].",
