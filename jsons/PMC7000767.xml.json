            "text": "One of the reasons that made it possible for researchers to associate the microcephaly epidemic in the Northeast (NE) region of Brazil with the Zika virus (ZIKV) was the high rate of dispersion of the virus and the large number of babies born with similar characteristics in the same maternity wards, in the same week, and sometimes even in the same day. This repeatedly happened in different cities of the region in a short time1. Despite all the research done on the first epidemics of ZIKV in Yap Islands and later in French Polynesia2\u20134, it was only after the Brazilian epidemic that Congenital Zika Syndrome (CZS) was described5. This could be due to the small population in the previously affected areas and to the large number of births concentrated in the same hospitals of the Brazilian Unified Health System (SUS). Even so, a robust analysis using secondary databases estimated a peak of 49.9 microcephaly cases per 10,000 live births in the NE region, whereas for the other regions the peak did not surpass 10 cases per 10,000 live births6. So far, microcephaly ratios as high as in the Brazilian NE region have not been described in any other region in the world that had undergone a Zika epidemic7\u20139. Several reasons for this discrepancy were suggested \u2013 poor data quality10\u201312, the unreliability of secondary data sources13,14, virus genetic variation15, socioeconomic factors16, dengue immunity profile of the population17, and women postponing pregnancy or having abortions18\u201320.",

In vitro studies have shown that anti-DENV antibodies can both enhance and neutralize ZIKV infection22\u201326. In animal models, mice that received plasma with a low level of anti-DENV antibodies had a higher mortality rate after ZIKV infection than mice that received plasma without antibodies. However, all mice that received plasma with a high level of anti-DENV antibodies survived after ZIKV challenge and presented milder symptoms22. Human plasma collected \u2264100 days after PCR-confirmed DENV infection binds and cross-neutralizes ZIKV in vitro. On the other hand, late-convalescent-phase plasma does not harbour durable, high levels of cross-neutralizing antibodies against ZIKV27. However, the understanding of cross-neutralizing antibody responses among individuals with prior DENV exposure, particularly how these responses evolve over time and in various transmission contexts in flavivirus-endemic countries is quite unknown28.",

Therefore, we could not control for Zika incidence in the models. It is possible that the differences in microcephaly rates were a consequence of different ZIKV attack rates across the regions, as suggested in a recent paper37. In this study, after testing for other concurrent factors, ZIKV was assumed to be the only cause of the microcephaly epidemic, with no unmeasured confounders or effect modifiers. However, if Zika incidence alone explains the excess microcephaly rates, then microcephaly would simply be a proxy for Zika, and it remains unclear as to why the NE region would have presented with a Zika incidence more than ten times larger than anywhere else in Brazil37.",

This hypothesis is based on what is described for sequential heterotypic DENV infections (there are four DENV serotypes). It has been established that a narrow range of pre-existing anti-DENV antibody titres is associated with the risk of severe dengue disease, while high titres protect against clinical illness29,38. As the antibody titres decay over time, there is a window of cross-protection between the DENV serotypes. A previous study found that a shorter interval between first and second infections was associated with protection from clinical illness39. Additionally to antibodies, DENV-specific CD8+ T cells from previous exposure also seems to play a role against ZIKV. Mice primed with DENV and 30 days later challenged with ZIKV during pregnancy presented reduced burden in maternal and fetal tissues, and increased fetal viability compared to non-immune mice. DENV-immune CD8+ T cells were required for this cross-protection. However, mice challenged 80 days after DENV priming were not protected, indicating the transient nature of cross-protection again40.",

However, the reduction in the incidence of Zika after the last epidemic in Brazil in 2016 limits the ability to use prospective studies43\u201345. Some cohorts previously designed to study dengue and that have been adapted to also study Zika are of great value. For example, a recent study in the Pau da Lima cohort in Salvador, a large city of the NE region, Brazil, found that the titres of DENV-antibodies measured before the Zika epidemic were inversely associated with the risk of ZIKV infection46. In a paediatric cohort in Nicaragua, prior DENV infection was inversely associated with the risk of symptomatic ZIKV infection47.",

Our findings indicate that a previous dengue fever epidemic may be related to microcephaly incidence and reinforce the idea of a window of cross-protection and a window of increased risk. Our window of protection is wider than detected in a longitudinal analysis of human immune sera, which showed a cross-neutralizing antibody response to ZIKV on DENV-immune subjects 1\u20133 years after DENV infection28. The larger window at the ecological level is possibly an effect of herd immunity and of multiple exposures to DENV that would boost immunity.

The more strict head circumference measurements counterbalanced the usual under-reporting11,50. It should be noted that the main surveillance system for neonatal congenital malformation (Latin American Collaborative Study of Congenital Malformations \u2013 ECLAMC) did not detect the microcephaly epidemic in the early stages14, possibly due to the geographical constraints of the sentinel hospitals. The use of a secondary database such as SINASC, despite its accuracy limitations, together with the more specialized ECLAMC could reinforce a surveillance system for neonatal malformation clustered in space and time.",
