However, the role of replicative senescence as an explanation of organismal aging remains the subject of vigorous debate. The controversy relates, in part, to the fact that certain organisms (eg, Drosophila species and Caenorhabditis elegans) undergo an aging process, yet all of their adult cells are postreplicative.",

Thus cells held in a quiescent state for months, when allowed back into a proliferative environment, will continue approximately the same number of divisions as those that were allowed to proliferate without a quiescent period.19\n",

On the basis of data derived from large cohorts of elderly patients, Fried et al23 have offered an operational definition of frailty incorporating an assessment of 5 specific characteristics to ascribe a frailty index. On this 5-point scale, a score of 3 or more has been shown to be independently predictive of a range of adverse clinical outcomes, including acute illness, falls, hospitalization, nursing home placement, and early mortality.23, 24, 25 Furthermore, simple performance measures, such as the assessment of walking speed, are predictive of important outcomes, including survival.26\n",

Among species, larger animals generally live longer than smaller animals, but within species, smaller animals are likely to live longer. It is clear that aging is not entirely explained by DNA sequence. For example, mice and bats have only 0.25% difference in their primary DNA sequence, but bats live for 25 years, 10 times longer than mice.

Probable asthma was defined as a history of wheezing in the past year associated with chest tightness or breathlessness. Excluding smokers and those with a diagnosis of congestive heart failure, 4% of subjects had definite asthma, and 4% had probable asthma. Among those who smoked, 11% had definite asthma, and 14% had probable asthma. Among nonsmokers, 185 subjects were identified who had definite or probable asthma; 76% were women, and 20% were older than 80 years. The age of asthma onset was spread approximately evenly among decades. Twenty-seven percent had late onset of disease after age 60 years, and 25% had onset of disease before age 20 years. As expected, respiratory symptoms in the older asthmatic subjects were more prevalent, with a 2- to 5-fold increase in cough, phlegm, wheezing, and dyspnea. Dyspnea on exertion was 1.6-fold more likely to be present in asthmatic patients than in those without the diagnosis. Lung function was reduced in those with a diagnosis of asthma. Mean FEV1 was 77% of predicted value in those with definite asthma and 89% of predicted value in those with probable asthma compared with 96% in those who did not have asthma. Forty-one percent of those with a diagnosis of asthma had airflow obstruction below the fifth percentile for the age group, and peak flow lability was increased. Elderly asthmatic patients reported the most common trigger was a viral infection in 58% compared with animal allergies in 30%. Two thirds reported seasonal worsening. Asthma had a significant effect on quality of life, with 35% of patients with definite or probable asthma reporting a fair or poor health status compared with 17% of elderly patients without asthma. Sixty percent of patients with definite asthma reported seasonal allergic rhinitis compared with only 30% in the nonasthma group. Despite the high prevalence and morbidity of asthma in this population, inadequate treatment was common. Only 40% of those with definite asthma had a rescue albuterol inhaler, and only 30% had inhaled corticosteroid use.5, 49, 51, 52\n",

Genes function in a milieu determined by the developmental and environmental history of the cell, which constitutes the epigenotype.53, 54 Epigenetic changes or marks can play a major role in human disease.55, 56 The most common examples of epigenetic marks are DNA methylation of CpG islands by DNA methyltransferases and chromatin modification of histone proteins, particularly acetylation by histone acetyltransferases and histone deacetylases.57, 58 The function of epigenetic changes is to regulate gene expression. Epigenetic changes are known to contribute to cancer and autoimmune disease and are thought to contribute to common diseases, including cardiovascular disease, diabetes, and the loss of response to stress caused by aging.59\n",

Moreover, characteristics and asthma drug response in the elderly asthmatic patient differ from those seen in childhood asthma. Compared with younger cohorts, elderly asthmatic patients have a higher prevalence, higher rates of bronchial hyperreactivity, more severe asthma, and a lower prevalence of atopy. The symptoms of elderly asthmatic patients are more difficult to control with drug therapy, and these patients have steroid resistance and might respond better to leukotriene receptor antagonists compared with inhaled corticosteroids.62, 63, 64, 65, 66, 67, 68, 69, 70, 71 The contribution of epigenetics to differences observed between elderly asthmatic patients and younger cohorts is unknown.

Thus the effect of aging on T-cell function in the context of allergen stimulation might be different than the effects of aging on T-cell function in the context of viral infection. Given that asthma is an inflammatory disorder of the airway, it is of interest to determine whether asthmatic airway inflammation of the elderly might differ from that of younger asthmatic patients and thus represent a distinct phenotype of asthma.

It is not known whether immunosenescence affects the production of these mediators in elderly asthmatic patients, either at baseline or during an exacerbation of symptoms. Furthermore, it is not known whether age-related changes in their production would have any implication for the clinical presentation or management of asthma in the elderly. Peripheral blood eosinophils were isolated from younger (20-40 years old) and older (55-80 years old) subjects for in vitro functional assays. The eosinophil effector functions of degranulation and superoxide production were diminished in the older compared with the younger asthmatic patients.78 In another study examining the expression of neutrophil mediators in younger and older asthmatic patients, there was decreased baseline expression of leukotriene B4 in the sputum of older asthmatic patients despite greater numbers of neutrophils.80 Whether these findings have implications during an asthma exacerbation has yet to be determined. Nevertheless, the results demonstrate age-related changes in the function of an inflammatory cell considered pathognomonic for allergic asthma and raise the question of whether additional effects of immunosenescence are relevant to airway inflammation in asthmatic patients.",

A number of investigators have explored the incidence of viral infection in adult asthmatic patients.91, 108, 109 Older studies using viral culture and serology for diagnosis demonstrated infection rates of 10% to 29%.109 In contrast, more recent studies, which include RT-PCR, have shown significantly higher infection rates of 44% to 55%.91, 108 Similar to results found in children, rhinoviruses are the most frequently detected pathogen. Few older persons were included in these studies, in which the mean ages of subjects were 30 to 39 years.",

Although studies to date have largely focused on the role of viruses in COPD exacerbations, it is reasonable to extrapolate infection rates and specific pathogens from these studies to older adults with asthma. Johnston,115 in Ontario, Canada, found a seasonal peak in emergency department visits for all acute respiratory tract infections, as well as exacerbations of both COPD and asthma, for persons younger and older than 50 years. All the common respiratory tract viruses have been associated with COPD exacerbations, and depending on the methodology and season of study, the specific rates of influenza, RSV, parainfluenza viruses, coronaviruses, hMPV, and rhinoviruses vary.116, 117 Wheezing appears to be a common symptom in older adults infected with any of the respiratory tract viruses, particularly RSV and hMPV, and 7% of adults hospitalized with RSV will have a discharge diagnosis of asthma.114, 118\n",

Asthmatic symptoms can also be triggered by medications, such as aspirin, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory agents, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, or \u03b2-blockers, which are commonly used by this patient population.

One reason, as shown in large community studies, is that most patients first have asthma in childhood or adolescence, and many physicians have had the misconception that asthma is a childhood disease. Another important reason is that the symptoms of asthma are more commonly associated with other diseases seen in this age group. The symptoms of asthma in the elderly are therefore nonspecific and might be caused by conditions that mimic asthma. The differential diagnosis of asthma in the elderly is greater than seen in younger asthmatic patients and includes congestive heart failure, emphysema and chronic bronchitis (COPD), chronic aspiration, gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD), and tracheobronchial tumors. Comorbid illnesses and the psychosocial effects of aging might also profoundly affect the diagnosis, clinical presentation, and care of asthma in the elderly. One particular diagnosis that is often difficult to detect and frequently overlooked by the patient and physician until the condition is advanced is upper airway obstruction, including the extrathoracic and intrathoracic central airways. Common causes of upper airway obstruction include malignancy, infection, inflammatory disorders, trauma, and extrinsic compression related to enlargement of adjacent structures (eg, an enlarged thyroid gland). It appears that malignancy and benign strictures related to airway instrumentation (eg, endotracheal intubation and tracheostomy) are becoming increasingly more prevalent in the older age group.",

Shortness of breath at rest is not typical of heart disease or lung diseases, such as COPD or interstitial lung disease, except in advanced stages. When present, it should prompt an investigation for asthma because sudden bronchospasm can cause respiratory distress at rest or exercise. Paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, which is typical of congestive heart failure, is found in a smaller number of elderly patients with asthma. Many elderly patients limit their activity to avoid experiencing dyspnea, and others assume that their dyspnea results from their aging process and thus avoid seeking medical attention early in their disease process. However, aging per se does not cause dyspnea, and a cause needs to be always pursued in assessing an elderly patient who complains of breathlessness.",

Although complete reversibility of airflow obstruction is frequently seen with young asthmatic patients, most elderly asthmatic patients show incomplete reversibility despite continuous intense therapy, and many show fixed airflow obstruction as if they have COPD. However, objective measures of lung function, such as spirometric and peak flow measurements, are generally underused in elderly patients, and this also contributes to the delay or absence of diagnosis.134, 135 Lung function testing is especially important in this age group because of the age-related reduction in the perception of dyspnea seen in the elderly.127 Spirometry is easily performed to determine that FEV1 and FEV1/FVC ratio are demonstrated with the timed vital capacity maneuver. The flow-volume loop, which also measures inspiratory flow, is especially useful when the cause of respiratory tract symptoms is not known and an upper airway obstruction is in the differential diagnosis. Although it might be difficult to perform spirometry in the elderly in some situations because of physical and poor cognitive impairment, studies have demonstrated that between 82% and 93% of elderly patients are able to perform the test properly.131, 132, 133, 134, 135 On the other hand, it might be more difficult to define the lower limits of predicted normal values in this age group. Traditionally, an FEV1/FVC ratio of less than 70% increases the probability of asthma in an elderly patient with asthma symptoms, but this ratio normally decreases with age because of a decrease in elastic recoil, and a ratio lower that 70% might be a normal finding.136\n",

Although high levels of NO are found in nasally expired air, studies in pulmonary inflammation have avoided this by redirecting airflow through the oral airway. It has been found that exhaled NO reflects airways inflammation and particularly eosinophilic inflammation. Exhaled NO levels are increased during the allergy season in atopic subjects. Inhaled glucocorticoids promptly suppress exhaled NO and do so in conjunction with suppression of eosinophilic inflammatory infiltrates. Studies have demonstrated that monitoring exhaled NO might permit better regulation of asthmatic symptoms, exacerbations, and total steroid use than treatments based on guidelines or symptoms. Furthermore, increases in exhaled NO levels might predict asthma exacerbations.154 It is of interest that NO levels in expired air decrease after bronchoconstrictive stimulation of asthmatic airways.",

The first question that needs to be addressed is why we need to make such a diagnosis rather than just treat the symptoms. There are reasons that physicians must strive to assign a diagnosis to a patient with a symptom complex. The patient is given relief by letting him or her know what is wrong by giving the illness a name, which implies a cause, establishes a prognosis, and initiates a treatment plan. Moreover, advancement of the understanding of epidemiology, natural history, pathobiology, and treatment require a definable disease entity. Whether the threshold for diagnostic criteria is set at a high level of sensitivity, a high level of specificity, or a high level of accuracy depends entirely on the costs and benefits of an incorrect diagnosis versus a missed diagnosis. For example, enumeration of a disease might require a high level of accuracy, whereas diagnosis of an uncommon and difficult-to-treat disease (eg, metastatic cancer) ought to be highly specific. The diagnosis of a common and easily treatable disease (eg, vitamin deficiency) ought to be highly sensitive, even if there is a risk of overdiagnosis. Asthma tends to be one of those disorders that is relatively easy (although not inexpensive) to treat and has morbid consequences if left untreated, suggesting that the diagnostic criteria ought to be highly sensitive.",

In addition, many elderly patients unconsciously accommodate to their symptoms or assume that the symptoms are a function of the aging process itself. Because the number of unscheduled ambulatory visits, emergency department visits, and hospitalizations are high in elderly asthmatic patients,164, 165 and quality-of-life scores are low in elderly patients with persistent asthma when compared with those with mild asthma or no asthma at all,5 careful assessment of asthma control is essential in this age group. Despite severe symptoms and physiologic impairment, most elderly patients with asthma can lead active productive lives if their asthma is appropriately managed. In fact, when elderly patients with severe or difficult-to-treat asthma have been identified by a physician\u2019s assessment, they appear to do better than younger patients. In the TENOR study, despite lower lung function, older asthmatic patients (mean age, 72 years) had lower rates of unscheduled office visits, emergency department visits, and corticosteroid bursts.81 Patients reported in the TENOR study received more aggressive care than younger adults, including higher use of inhaled and oral corticosteroids, and this undoubtedly had an effect on outcomes.",

Oral corticosteroids should be avoided if possible because they place the patient at risk for bone fracture and increased likelihood of cataracts, muscle weakness, back pain, bruising, and oral candidiasis.202 Many studies have shown that inhaled corticosteroids are safe and effective treatment for persistent asthma, but none have specifically targeted the elderly population. Long-term use of inhaled corticosteroids has been associated with a good safety profile, but higher doses of inhaled steroids (eg, >1000 \u03bcg/d) are capable of causing hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis suppression. Local adverse effects, such as hoarseness, dysphonia, cough, and oral candidiasis, do occur but can usually be avoided by the use of a spacer or holding chamber with the metered-dose inhaler and by rinsing the mouth after each use. Despite the pivotal role of inhaled corticosteroids in asthma, many elderly patients are undertreated with this group of medications.5, 203\n",

Tremor can also occur and is especially troublesome in the geriatric patient. Tremor is thought to be caused by stimulation of \u03b22-receptors in skeletal muscle. In general, they have been proven to be safe and effective in all age groups.205 However, \u03b2-agonists can cause (1) a dose-dependent decrease in serum potassium levels and (2) a dose-dependent increase in the QT interval on electrocardiography. Because sudden death from ventricular arrhythmia can be caused by both of these mechanisms, as well as being a complication of ischemic heart disease, the use of \u03b2-agonists in the elderly should be closely monitored. Short-acting \u03b22-agonists should be used for rescue of symptoms, whereas long-acting agents should be used as maintenance medications only as an add-on to inhaled corticosteroids and never as stand-alone therapy.",

This could be an overarching explanation for many findings in the elderly asthmatic patient, including less IgE (IL-4 and IL-13 are needed for opening switch regions for IgE production); IL-4 and IL-13 are highly associated with airway hyperreactivity, and IL-5 is associated with eosinophil activation, survival, and, to a lesser extent, trafficking.",

Much of this research has focused on TH2 lymphocyte\u2013driven processes underlying allergic asthma and its characteristic eosinophilic airway inflammation. Abundant information supporting this research has been derived from bronchial biopsy and bronchoalveolar lavage studies largely carried out in a young adult population. It is recognized, however, that the role of allergy and allergic triggers in asthma diminishes with age.69, 234 In addition, LOA is often less reversible, more severe, and frequently occurs in response to a viral respiratory tract infection.153 A distinct asthma phenotype characterized by normal airway eosinophil numbers has been described.235 Moreover, normal airway eosinophilia might also be associated with abnormal sputum neutrophilia.236, 237 Recent studies have shown that neutrophilic asthma might be associated with activation of innate immune pathways in contrast to the adaptive immune response associated with TH2-mediated allergic asthma.238 Thus alternative immune pathways involving natural killer T or TH17 lymphocyte subtypes have been hypothesized as being potentially important in the pathogenesis of asthma, particularly in adult-onset asthma.239, 240 Just as the discovery of TH2-related pathways has led to important leads in drug discovery for allergic asthma, further clinical research into these alternative pathways should be carried out with the goal of identifying new and exciting targets for future drug discovery. This research should focus not only on the discovery of new molecular targets but also on the identification of noninvasive biomarkers that will help predict the success of any new therapy in an individual patient.",
