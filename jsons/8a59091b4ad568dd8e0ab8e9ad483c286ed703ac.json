            "text": "Power line interference (\"hum noise\") is a common source of noise in recorded biological data. It has a highly constant frequency with harmonics and little variation in amplitude and wave shape. In contrast to stochastic noise it is phasic, i.e., the phase relation remains constant across long intervals. In digital recordings, the measurement frequency is typically very close to a 5 multiple of the hum frequency (50 or 60 Hz). Common filters introduce various kinds of distortions and errors. The here proposed subtraction method makes use of the specific properties of power line hum. For this, it computes a moving estimate of the hum noise by taking the periodic median of the high-pass filtered signal. The resulting periodic median subtraction (PMS) filter reliably 10 removes hum of any harmonic composition, even if the ground frequency is lacking. The filter is completely free of border artifacts. It does not introduce distortions, even if around sharp transients such as in force plate recordings of jumping. The filter is validated on recorded and artificial data. The errors are quantified. The results also show that the errors of hum filters generally 15 increase with the high-frequency content of the data. Thus, the removal of hum from a force plate recording generally gives better results than from an EMG recoding. Compared to other filters, the errors of the PMS filter are generally lower than the best hum filters currently known.",

            "text": "Digital data recordings, such as EEG, EMG, EKG, kinetics (force plates) etc., are all prone to power line noise. Power line noise is a common and old problem and various filters have been made designed for such noise. Even though power 25 line noise is mostly highly regular in frequency, amplitude and wave form, it has proven notoriously difficult to design a filter that is free of artifacts and deformations, which leaves the original signal intact. Moreover many filters focus on a single narrow frequency band, but power line noise typically has strong harmonic frequencies as well. 30 Hum problems can be solved by avoiding them. If they cannot be avoided, analog or digital filters can be applied. Thanks to modern computational power and digital storage capacity analog filters are not common anymore. There are two dominant approaches to design computational filters, i.e., spectral filters in the frequency domain and subtraction filters in the time domain (for reviews 35 see Baratta et al., 1998; Daniel and Neagu, 2018; Thalkar and Upasani, 2013; BLRI, 2016) .",

Gibb's rippling is especially problematic in the vicinity of transients in the signal, which are especially prominent in force plate measurements (kinetics). Many filters perform badly at the beginning and end of the signal (edge effects), and are thus not well suited for relatively short recordings. 45 Frequency-based methods involve moving averages technique and IIR notch (kaur Aneja and Singh, 2009) , spectrum interpolation (Leske and Dalal, 2019), multi-taper decomposition (Mitra and Bokil, 2007 , for multichannel techniques such as EEG) and Fourier decomposition (Singh et al., 2019) .",

For the new PMS filter, the relative error was indeed relatively constant 0.22 / 0.21 (mean / median). This is not as good as for the simulated signal (cf.
