Prior to the COVID-19 pandemic all patients referred to the trauma service, apart from open lower limb trauma, were reviewed in person within the trauma clinic. If surgery was required, it was usual for patients to return on a separate day for their operation and in most instances this was carried out under general anaesthetic in the main operating theatres. After discharge, patients were referred to the hand therapy and plastics dressing services and returned in person for all follow-up visits including dressing changes and therapy. Patients with lower limb injuries from the MTC were transferred from Southampton General Hospital as inpatients to SDH for all complex reconstruction including free tissue transfer.",

Now, when patients are referred to our hand trauma service from peripheral hospitals, the initial patient consultations are carried out remotely using the \u2018attend anywhere\u2019 video platform. We are following the BSSH Covid-19 Hand trauma guidelines2 for patient management. All patient decisions are discussed with the trauma consultant of the day. We are managing a greater number of patients conservatively and to aid this we have designed comprehensive patient information leaflets that enable our patients to increase understanding of their own management.",

We have transformed our minor operating theatres, located adjacent to our clinic, into fully functional theatres equipped with a mini C-arm and all instruments for trauma operating. This reduces the need for our patients to be taken into the main hospital theatre suite. Operations are carried out either under local anaesthetic, WALANT or regional block depending on complexity. All theatre staff wear level 3 PPE and staffing is kept to a minimum. All wounds are closed with dissolvable sutures. Immediately post operation, our on-site hand therapists review patients. Splints are made on the same day and patients are educated about their post-operative management at this time. All follow-up is subsequently carried out virtually by the hand therapy team using \u2018attend anywhere\u2019.",

This is in line with reports from other UK units. This has given us time to refine our protocols for an expected upsurge of patients as the lockdown is lifted. Furthermore, during this period where we have had extra capacity, our registrars have been trained to carry out new techniques. They now undertake insertion of both mid-lines and PICC lines for medical inpatients under ultrasound guidance to support and reduce the burden placed on our anaesthetic and critical care colleagues who previously would have placed these.",
