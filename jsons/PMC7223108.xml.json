            "text": "\u201cThe concept \u2018care\u2019 is commonplace in lay and sociological discourses but is hardly uniformly defined\u201d (Thomas 1993, p. 649). Examination of the concept of care results in the identification of an overlapping set of perspectives (Morse et al. 1990). Nevertheless, most authors agree on the nature of care as either a feeling state (emotion, affection, love), caring about someone, or an activity state (work, tasks, labors), caring for someone (Morse et al. 1990). As such, care can be construed as both an attitude and an action. Held (2006) puts this as follows: \u201cAll care involves attentiveness, sensitivity and respond to needs\u201d (p. 39). And Gastmans (2006) confirms: \u201cGood care demands more than just good intention; good care ... is a practice of combining activities, attitudes, and knowledge of the situation\u201d (p.137). Care, therefore, can also be approached as a competency since it combines knowledge, skills, attitudes and behavior, making an individual able to perform a certain task at a given level (Bl\u00f6meke et al. 2015). As such, care can be structured following its cognitive, affective and behavioral competency facets: (1) being aware of and apprehending an individual\u2019s current situation or needs (cognitive); (2) responding sympathetically and empathetically to those needs (affective); and (3) acting to meet the needs of an individual (behavioral).",

            "text": "Next to being multi-faceted, care is also a multi-dimensional concept. Looking at the actor-dimension, care rather can be characterized as an aspect of social relations than as an individual\u2019s trait or behavior (Held 2006). This explains why Noddings (1984) stresses that \u2013 in a reciprocal relationship between two human beings \u2013 care implies both a person one-caring and a person cared-for. Care cannot be sustained if a caring person fails being attentive and/or refuses to respond, or if the person being cared-for is unable or unwilling to receive the care of others (Noddings 1984). This multi-dimensional nature helps enriching the concept of care with a receiving care and extending care dimension. Next, besides receiving care and extending care, also self-care is getting accepted as an indispensable dimension. Self-care implies monitoring of one\u2019s own well-being, growth, and competencies in order to competently and successfully engage in a caring relationship (Hamington and Sander-Staudt 2011). It is essential to reflect on our own needs and ensure that oneself is not subsumed in a caring relationship (Tronto 1993).",

            "text": "Taken together, the MLI (Mind and Life Institue 2014) reflects the relational nature of care through a framework of three interdependent dimensions of care: receiving care, self-care and extending care. Building on the multifaceted conception of care, \u2018receiving care\u2019 can be seen as the competencies to be aware of and receptive to (1) others\u2019 noticing to your own situation/needs (cognitive); (2) others\u2019 empathetic feelings to your own situation/needs (affective); (3) others\u2019 actions to meet your own needs (behavioral). \u2018Self-care\u2019 is regarded as the competencies to (1) notice and understand the needs of yourself (cognitive); (2) empathetically react to and accept your own situation/needs (affective); (3) act to meet you own needs (behavioral). \u2018Extending care\u2019 can be described as the competencies to (1) notice and understand others\u2019 situation/needs (cognitive); (2) empathetically react to and accept others \u2018situation/needs (affective); (3) act to meet others\u2019 needs (behavioral). From this perspective, empathy \u2013 the capacity to place oneself in another\u2019s position (Bellet and Maloney 1991) \u2013 can be seen as part of the cognitive and affective facets of extending care. Mindfulness can be regarded as a cognitive and affective practice of self\u2013care by which an individual becomes aware of and accepts painful experiences in a balanced and non-judgmental way (Brown and Ryan 2003). Especially, compassion, the desire and will to care for and to help alleviate one\u2019s suffering (Gilbert et al. 2017), can be regarded as one typical, critical manifestation of extending care. In general, the above working definitions suggest that care is connected to other constructs such as social support, empathy, altruism, prosocial behavior, mindfulness and compassion (Nguyen et al. 2019).",

            "text": "Despite the available body of research, there is no consensus on the definition of well-being. Two approaches can be adopted in defining this concept: hedonism versus eudaimonism. The hedonic approach is based on the notion that increased pleasure and a decrease in pain lead to higher well-being (Ryan and Deci 2001). Accordingly, subjective well-being is defined as \u201cthe pursuit of happiness and a pleasant life\u201d (Chen et al. 2012; p.1034) or the total of positive affect, negative affect and life satisfaction (Grenville-Cleave 2012). Alternatively, the eudaimonic approach is based on the premise that people attain a higher well-being when they experience the meaningfulness of life, challenges, and personal growth (Ryan and Deci 2001). Well-being within this approach is defined as psychological well-being (Chen et al. 2012). Burn (2016) stated that \u201cpsychological well-being refers to inter- and intra-individual levels of positive functioning that can include one\u2019s relatedness with others and self-referent attitudes that include one\u2019s sense of mastery and personal growth\u201d (p.1). Taken together, well-being is about: (1) the presence of positive emotions and moods (e.g., contentment, happiness); (2) the absence of negative emotions (e.g., stress, depression, anxiety); and (3) satisfaction with life, fulfillment and positive functioning. Based on this comprehensive perspective, though correlated, well-being is not direct opposites of ill-being, which is related to pervasive negative affects and functioning (Ryff et al. 2006). Specifically, those with low level of well-being would not be expected to show high level of ill-being.",

With respect to the self-care dimension, studies by Bluth and Blanton (2015) and Neff and McGehee (2010) showed that mindfulness and self-compassion were significantly related to all measured dimensions of well-being (reduced negative affect, perceived stress, anxiety and depression; increased positive affect and life satisfaction).

Each subscale was composed of 12 items with 6 positively worded statements and 6 negatively worded statements, tapping into the three facets of care (cognitive, affective and behavioral facets). The use of an equal number of negative and positive worded items is recommended by several researchers to make measures more valid (e.g., Baumgartner and Steenkamp 2001; Podsakoff et al. 2003). Sample items are presented in Table 3. Respondents scored each item on a Likert scale from 1 totally untrue about me to 6 totally true of me.

First, the self-rated version of the Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire (SDQ- Goodman 1997) was used to assess emotional and behavioral disorders of adolescents. The SDQ is predictive of psychiatric diagnoses in many developed and developing countries, including Vietnam (Tran 2006). It is composed of 25 items, of which 20 items were used in this study, covering four areas of adolescents\u2019 difficulties: Emotional symptoms (5 items. e.g., Often unhappy, depressed or tearful), conduct problems (5 items; e.g., Often fights with other children), hyperactivity/inattention (5 items; e.g. Thinks things out before acting), and peer problems (5 items; e.g., Gets along better with adults). These items were rated on a 3-point Likert scale (0 = not true; 1 = somewhat true; 2 = certainly true). In line with the manual, a total difficulty score was calculated based on all 20 items (Goodman and Goodman 2012). Cronbach\u2019s alpha in our data was .72. Second, the Perceived Stress Scale (PSS; Cohen and Williamson 1988) was used to measure adolescents\u2019 general level of stress during the past month (e.g., In the past month, how often have you been upset because of something that happened unexpectedly?). Answers were rated on a Likert-scale ranging from 0 never to 4 very often. In Vietnam, this scale was underscored by Nguyen and Nguyen (2012) with satisfactory reliability (alpha = .71). In the present study, to obtain acceptable Cronbach\u2019s alpha, we had to leave out four positive items with low item-total correlations. Finally, six negative worded items were retained with a Cronbach\u2019s alpha of .64. Third, the Satisfaction with Life Scale (SWLS, Diener et al. 1985) was used to assess overall life satisfaction of adolescents. The five scale items are phrased positively (e.g., In most ways my life is close to ideal) and were answered using a 7-point Likert-rating (1 strongly disagree to 7 strongly agree). In Vietnam, this scale was validated in medical university students by Nguyen and Nguyen (2012) who reported satisfactory reliability (alpha = .75). In the present study, Cronbach\u2019s alpha was found to be acceptable (.66).",

Analysis of eigenvalues, scree plot and interpretability of the factors suggested a two-factor solution for each of the three care competencies. After rotation, all the positively-worded items loaded on the first factor and all the negatively-worded items on the second factor, identifying two latent constructs underlying each dimension of care: care competencies and care failures. The two retained factors explained 36.6% of the variance of receiving care items, 31.8% of the variance of self-care items and 33.8% of the variance of extending care items.",

However, for receiving care and extending care scale, the model still did not fit the data adequately. Based on modification indices, the fit of these models was improved by allowing error correlations between items 3 and 8 (r = .38) and 5 and 9 (r = .23) of receiving care and items 25 and 26 of extending care (r = .48), resulting in good fit for the models for receiving care: normed \u03c72 = 2.97, CFI = .93; RMSEA = .05; SRMR = .05, and extending care: normed \u03c72 = 2.03; CFI = .95; RMSEA = .04; SRMR = .04.

As indicated in the top row of Table 2, this 6-factor model demonstrated good fit. Noticeably, as mentioned above, we decided to retain item 15 and 20 (< .30) to guarantee the measurement of the behavioral facet of self-care.",

Second, based on the EFA-results showing a clear 2-factor structure (care competencies and care failures) in all three dimensions of care, a global two-factor model was estimated. However, as reflected in Table 2, compared to the 6-factor model, the model also did not fit the data sufficiently well, \u0394\u03c72 = 272.72, p < .001; \u0394CFI = .13. Third, another global model with three factors based on the variables rooted in the Mind and Life Institue (2014) framework of the care concept (receiving care, self-care and extending care) was tested. Similarly, this model did not fit the data adequately, \u0394\u03c72 = 347.73, p < .001; \u0394CFI = .15. In sum, comparison of all tested CFA models results in the conclusion that distinguishing between six factors within the CCQA best represents the data structure.

Instead, the positively and negatively worded items fell apart in two factors underlying each dimension: care competencies and care failures. According to Neff (2003), it is not uncommon for negative and positive items in self-report measures to load on separate factors. Neff (2003) had the same experience when developing and validating The Self-Compassion Scale. Recently, the studies by Brenner et al. (2018) and Van der Gucht et al. (2017) confirm that the positive (i.e., self-kindness, common humanity, and mindfulness) and negative (i.e., self-judgment, isolation, and over-identification) components of self-compassion reflect two distinct constructs (self-kindness and self-coldness). Gibert\u2019s Social Mentality Theory (Gilbert 2005) also points out that compassionate ways of responding to suffering tap into parasympathetic nervous system activity, and uncompassionate ways of responding tap into the sympathetic nervous system, suggesting that care competencies and care failures should not be measured as a single factor. Care failures, therefore, may not be simply the absence of care competencies. Feeling competent in care and failing in care are two different experiences. For example, a person who does not feel happy when noticing others are happy (low extending care competency), does not necessarily feel envious when others get happiness in their life (high extending care failure); or a person who does not tend to easily change his personal plans because of others\u2019 plans (low self-care failure) does not necessarily make time for his hobbies (high self-care competency). Besides, an individual can exhibit both care competencies and care failures. For example, a person could be touched when seeing miserable and starving people but also sometimes could feel envious when others get achievements and happiness in their life.",

Model comparisons further confirmed both the differentiation of receiving care, extending care and self-care, as well as competencies and failures in each of these dimensions. Reliability of each of these factors based on Cronbach\u2019s alpha in some cases was unsatisfactory, but average inter-item correlations were all within the expected range, confirming different items within each subscale measured the same construct but were not redundant (Clark and Watson 1995). The six separate but correlated factors assessed distinct but related components of care. The relationships between the six factors were quite logic and as such confirmed convergent validity of the new instrument as well as the interdependence of the three care dimensions as defined by Mind and Life Institue (2014). The ability to receive care empowers and is empowered by extending care to others; extending care flows naturally out of the feeling of being worthy (self-care) and being cared for by others (receiving care); and self-care is cultivated in the other two dimensions: receiving care and extending care (Mind and Life Institue 2014). However, unexpectedly, there was a moderate positive relationship between self-care competencies and self-care failures. As mentioned above, self-care competencies and self-care failures are two distinct systems; adolescents can both feel competent in self-care and experience failure in self-care. This paradoxical finding, in fact, seems to reveal an ambivalent struggle inside some adolescents between self-coldness and self-kindness. Some adolescents seem to try to practice self-kindness at moments they tend to criticize and disappoint themselves (Brenner et al. 2018).",

            "text": "Out of eight sociodemographic characteristics, only gender and academic achievement were related to dimensions of care competencies and failures. As reported, girls possess higher levels of receiving care, self-care and extending care competencies and lower extending care failures, compared to boys. These results are consistent with previous findings indicating women have higher levels of care-seeking and care-giving than men (Hermanto and Zuroff 2016; L\u00f3pez et al. 2018). Differences in extending care, self-care and receiving care between boys and girls are probably in large part due to different socialization processes, even nowadays and sure in Vietnam (Nguyen 2000), the country in which this study took place. For example, girls are handed dolls and baby carriages to play with (suggesting nurturing and caring behaviors) and boys are handed superheroes and toy soldiers (suggesting fighting, and protecting behaviors). As empathy is seen as a more \u201cfeminine\u201d trait that is more acceptable for women, women may have learned to both communicate and recognize it more easily (Hertenstein and Keltner 2011). Noticeably, female adolescents also scored significantly higher in both self-competencies and self-care failures. Gender differences in self-care are not consistent in previous studies. Meta-analytic research suggests that women have slightly lower levels of self-compassion (Yarnell et al. 2015). However, Ayala et al. (2018) found out that men were more likely to report poorer self-care but women still experienced significantly more stress than men. On the one hand, these findings confirm again that self-care competencies and care failures are two different experiences. On the other hand, it seems to imply that female adolescents find self-care more challenging, compared to man. Females also reflect more self-blame and self-criticism when coping with stressful events compared to men (Kelly et al. 2008). However, ironically, the fear that self-compassion is a weakness prevents men from getting benefit from developing this skill (Yarnell et al. 2015).",

The findings show a basic contribution of care competencies to well-being and a potential prediction of care failures to ill-being. All three dimensions of care failures were moderately or strongly associated with the three well-being indicators. In addition, noticeably, self-care failures are the strongest unique predictor of perceived stress and social-emotional difficulties. In contrast, the predictive power of care competencies in this present study was weak. Only receiving care competencies significantly predicted less emotional and behavioral problems. At first hand, the unexpected positive relationship between self-care and extending care competencies and perceived stress seems to imply that high level of these two competencies is somewhat stressful. However, these relationships were very weak and did not stay when controlling for care failures in the regressions. Therefore, these findings do not support the paradox of giving care (Lu and Argyle 1992) and unexpected side-effects of mindful self-awareness (Shapiro 1992).",

Showing kindness, support and empathy for others helps them to strengthen their relationships with others and build new ones. Overall, both receiving care and extending care competencies can satisfy the need for relatedness by boosting social connection. In turn, a feeling of social connection to others might boost their sense of well-being. Research has shown that people who feel more connected to others reflect lower anxiety and depression rates (Seppala et al. 2013). Moreover, both receiving care and extending care competencies might also satisfy the need for competence of adolescents. Appropriate care from others can increase self- efficacy - an assurance that a person can achieve his desired goal (Akbarbegloo et al. 2015; Wang et al. 2015). Similarly, helping others will improve how adolescents see themselves and value their contribution to the lives of others. In other words, extending care may give adolescents a sense of purpose in life and a feeling of self-worth. Self-care may enhance adolescents\u2019 well-being because it also helps the need for competence to be fulfilled. By truly accepting themselves, being kind to themselves and by stopping criticizing themselves, adolescents tend to value themselves, which increases their self-efficacy.",

Similarly, self-criticism and maladaptive perfectionism may put adolescents under pressure, which in turn leads to lower self-worth. These failures in receiving care, extending care and self-care, therefore, affect their well-being. Noticeably, self-care failures are the most important predictor of stress in adolescents.

Only three interactions underscored the assumption that well-being depends on the ability to balance the different competencies of care.

Adolescents with high extending care competencies but low receiving care competencies experienced most perceived stress; in contrast, adolescents with high receiving care competencies experience lower stress, regardless of their competency to extend care.

The former implies that our study contributes in a theoretical way to the literature by developing an integrated conceptualization of care and by putting forward empirical evidence. Also, our empirical results underpin the reliability and validity of an instrument in line with this new conceptualization. Our findings contribute to our understanding of the influences of care competences in adolescents; e.g., that overcoming care failures seems more important than building care competencies in adolescents. Lastly, we could demonstrate the interdependence of the three care dimensions and how they interact with well-being.
