            "text": "Appropriate management of CAP requires identification of the potential etiologic agents. Antigen detection by immunofluorescent assays (IFA) are routinely used for detecting respiratory viruses in children with good performance (95%) [Loeffelholz and Chonmaitree, 2010] ; however, highly sensitive techniques must be used in adults due to the low viral shedding [Casiano-Colon et al., 2003; Fox, 2007; Loeffelholz and Chonmaitree, 2010] . Real time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (rtRT-PCR) is a nucleic acid amplification method used in diagnostic, which has enhanced the viral detection. The high sensitivity of new methodologies such as Luminex 1 system has increased the diagnostic capacity allowing the detection of many viruses at the same time [Fox, 2007; Krunic et al., 2007; Loeffelholz and Chonmaitree, 2010] ; furthermore, commercial kits are now available (xTAG 1 RVP assay). This method has displayed 98.0% sensitivity over IFA/viral culture and 78.8% sensitivity and 99.6% specificity over RT-PCR [Gadsby et al., 2010] ; however, in a recent study [Choudhary et al., 2016] , sensitivity of xTAG 1 RVP in a pediatric population was only 68.3%, whereas the sensitivity of in-house conventional RT-PCR and real time RT-PCR were 96.9% and 87.9%, respectively. In adults, xTAG 1 RVP has been scantily studied, and in these studies, patients with diverse respiratory illness have been included [She et al., 2010; Costa et al., 2015] ; therefore, its performance in adult CAP is unknown. Since xTAG 1 RVP performance may differ in different populations and CAP is a public health problem, it is necessary to establish its performance in pneumonia to optimize diagnosis, and therefore the medical management of these patients.",

Exclusion criteria included immunocompromising conditions (i.e., human immunodeficiency virus infection, active treatment for cancer, organ transplant, immunosuppressive therapy) and hospitalizations within 30 days preceding enrolment. Information on age, gender, prior antibiotic treatment, and co-morbidities (diabetes mellitus, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, asthma, cardiac failure, liver damage, renal, or neurologic disease) were recorded for all patients in standard files. Chest radiographic patterns were described by independent radiologists as alveolar, interstitial, or mixed infiltrates. Patient severity was assessed during the first 48 hr after enrolment by the pneumonia severity index (PSI) described by [Fine et al., 1997 ], that evaluates gender; age; neoplasic, cardiac, respiratory, and renal illness; clinical parameters (respiratory rate, pulse, etc.); X-ray and laboratory parameters (hematocrit, partial pressure of oxygen, pleural effusion, etc).

Rhinovirus was the agent most commonly detected by both (Table I) . Performance of the xTAG 1 RVP Fast is showed in Table II . Although detection rate for each virus by rtRT-PCR and by Luminex 1 were similar in NPS (P > 0.2), 10 viruses were additionally positive by rtRT-PCR (eight RV, one AdV, and one PIV) and 15 by xTAG 1 RVP Fast (eleven RV-EV, two Flu A,one hMPV, and one PIV-4) ( Table SII) , totalizing 24 patients with discordant viral detection. In all positive cases by rtRT-PCR and negative by Luminex 1 , the Ct was !27 and in the opposite situation, MIF was !307 (Table SII) . IFA detected Flu and RSV in one case of each one of the 61 NPS tested, being its rate of detection of 3.3%.",

Discrepant results might also be explained through a better primer targeting of RT-PCR and because rtRT-PCR was performed immediately after collection, while all extracts used by xTAG 1 RVP were frozen at \u00c080\u02daC, in order to have enough number of samples to reduce costs. Thus, 17/19 samples with low viral loads, according to high Ct (!27), could have lost some RNA because of thawing, resulting negative by Luminex 1 ; however, this fact does not explain the discrepancy of two cases showing Ct < 26 and detected only by rtRT-PCR or Ct ! 30 in nine RV detected by both methods.",
