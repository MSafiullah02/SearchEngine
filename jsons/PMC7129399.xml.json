Continuous variables were also categorised into quintiles in the univariable analysis. The fit of the categorical variables in the model was compared to the fit in the continuous variables by assessing the change in deviance. The statistical package Egret (Cytel Software Corporation, USA) was used for data analysis. Variables with a univariable P\n < 0.3 were considered for inclusion in a multivariable model, which was built using the technique of backward elimination.

Excluding cats testing positive for FIV or FeLV, only 9.4% (24/255) of the case cats died as a result of infectious disease (Table 2). This figure suggests that effective disease control procedures were employed by the adoption centres, as infectious disease (excluding those caused by retroviroses) was reported to be the cause of death of 6.2% (16/259) cats registered with 15 French veterinary practices (Lacheretz et al 2002). The figures are, therefore, encouraging as the potential for infectious disease spread will have been much greater for the adoption centre cats in our study than for the population of domestic cats in Lacheretz et al's study. However, it is possible that a higher mortality rate might have been reported if the study had included a 12-month data collection period rather than a 6-month period (January\u2013June), as more kittens with an associated increased risk of mortality, would have been likely to have been included in the dataset.",

In contrast, cats between 8 weeks and 1 year of age were nearly seven times less likely to die and cats aged more than 1 year and less than or equal to 3 years old were nearly four times less likely to die than cats aged 0\u20137 weeks of age. These findings were as anticipated, as they reflect the increased risks associated with old age and previously identified risks associated with birth and the neonatal period (Scott and Peltz, 1978, Lawler and Monti, 1984, Sparkes et al., 2006). Excluding kittens that died before reaching 6 weeks of age, the approximate median age of cats that died naturally was 3 years and 3 months compared with a median age of 8 years and 1 month for cats that had been euthanased. These figures are likely to reflect veterinarians being more likely to recommend euthanasia for older cats in poor health compared with younger cats in poor health. Indeed, further examination of the data revealed that the median age of cats that were euthanased following admission to the adoption centres in poor heath was 8 years compared to a median of 1 year for cats that were not euthanased following their admission in poor health.",

The multivariable model (Table 3) included the variable of age at admission; therefore, the risk associated with the neutered status of the cat is independent of the age of the cat. Although a link between neutered status and FIV is well recognised, cats that had tested positive for FIV had been removed from the dataset. Euthanasia of FIV-positive cats thus does not explain the association between neutered status and mortality observed in this dataset (based on cats that had either tested negative for FIV or had not been tested for FIV). The reason for the association between neutered status and the risk of mortality is thus unclear; however, a link between neutered status and other infectious diseases may exist. Further examination of the data provided some support for this hypothesis as the neutered status of the cat was significantly (P\n < 0.001) associated with the cause of death (infectious disease excluding FIV/non-infectious disease), with unneutered cats accounting for 86.1% (31/36) and 54.2% (110/203) of cats that had been reported to have died as a result of infectious diseases (other than FIV) and non-infectious diseases, respectively (data not shown). Unneutered cats may also be more likely than neutered cats to roam and thus be at an increased risk from poisoning or trauma-related injuries resulting from road traffic accidents; however, no cases of poisoning and few trauma-related (n\n = 8) deaths were recorded in this study. In contrast, road accidents and poisoning were reported by Moreau et al (2002) to be the most common causes of accidental deaths in cats, accounting for 41% and 40% of cases, respectively.",

The highest risk of mortality was associated with cats that had been housed by CP for 3 days or less. However, the association between time at the adoption centre and the risk of mortality was independent of variables included in the multivariable model, including the age of the cat, the birth location (at CP or elsewhere) and the health of the cat at the time of admission. In addition, FIV-positive and FeLV-positive cats that were euthanased during the first few days following admission to an adoption centre were removed from the dataset prior to multivariable analysis, thus not explaining the observed association between time spent at CP and the risk of mortality. Therefore, other factors not examined in this study may explain this association. It is possible that although the poor health of some cats might not have been apparent at the time of relinquishment, the initial veterinary examination would have revealed the need for euthanasia. However, it is also possible that some owners might take cats in need of euthanasia to CP rather than to their veterinary surgeon, in an attempt to reduce the cost and emotional distress associated with euthanasia. This hypothesis is supported by the finding that 27% of cats that died or were euthanased within the first 3 days of admission to the centre (excluding kittens that were born at CP), were relinquished by owners rather than admitted as stray or feral cats. It is also possible that some of the stray/feral cats were also \u2018owned\u2019 cats, but whose owners would not admit to ownership at the time of relinquishment, in an attempt to reduce any guilt associated with passing on the responsibility of euthanasia to an adoption centre. Further investigation of cats requiring euthanasia within the first few days since admission to an adoption centre might thus be warranted by rescue charities.",

Except for one cat that was blind and died of \u2018old age\u2019, the other case cats reported to have a disability were all euthanased on veterinary advice related to other health problems. Thus, it is anticipated that the association between the risk of mortality and the presence of disabilities was related to the presence or absence of a disability acting as an additional factor that contributed to the euthanasia decision.",
