Although some in-vitro evidence supports the antiviral activity of hydroxychloroquine and its precursor chloroquine, there is no peer-reviewed publication that evaluates either drug for exposure prophylaxis of SARS-CoV-2 infection. Even for treatment of diagnosed cases, only one small study reported faster nasopharyngeal viral clearance, with no data for clinical improvement.3 This evidence, or the lack thereof, hardly justifies state-endorsed, widespread use of hydroxychloroquine for prophylaxis.",

Moreover, mathematical models estimate a worst-case scenario of 10 million cases of COVID-19 in New Delhi, India, alone in the coming weeks.5 In these chaotic times, no health-care system can screen such a large number of healthy contacts for concomitant QTc prolonging medicines, long QT syndromes, or glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency. Even a 0\u00b71% proportion of serious complications would amount to more than 10 000 severe adverse events in New Delhi alone, a number an already overwhelmed health-care system would not be able to cope with. The drug is untested, the benefits unknown, and the risks not negligible, especially at this scale of use. Moreover, the safety of these immunomodulators in people at risk of a severe viral illness has never been evaluated.",

However, all scientific reasoning cannot be abandoned citing desperate times. A blanket recommendation for chemoprophylaxis in the absence of credible evidence might be contentious to say the least. If hydroxychloroquine is to be used, a clear informed choice needs to be offered to every contact, explaining the scarcity of evidence for its efficacy and its potential risks. Additionally, all outcome events should be recorded. If this is not done, the risk\u2013benefit assessment would be skewed, adverse events accepted as collateral damage, and a drug accepted provisionally in a time of crisis could become commonplace as standard of care for a long time to come.",
