            "text": "Infectious diseases are transmitted through social contacts between individuals. The modeling of epidemic spreading among human beings has been extensively studied in mathematical epidemiology and network science. The developments of transportation system have enabled people to travel more globally. Consequently, epidemics starting from a local patch can spread to the entire network in a very short time. Recently, the metapopulation modeling approach has been broadly applied to study infectious disease spreading among the spatial structure of populations with well-defined social units (Colizza et al., 2007, Colizza and Vespignani, 2007, Balcan et al., 2010). Then the metapopulation network model has been greatly developed by considering a number of factors such as the network structure (Watts et al., 2005, Cao et al., 2011, Wang et al., 2014), human mobility patterns (Belik et al., 2011a, Belik et al., 2011b, Balcan and Vespignani, 2011, Balcan and Vespignani, 2012, Poletto et al., 2012), human behavior (Meloni et al., 2011, Wang et al., 2012), and human contact patterns (Wang et al., 2013, Yang et al., 2011, Iribarren, 2009). It has been shown that the substrate network structure (Watts et al., 2005, Cao et al., 2011, Wang et al., 2014) plays an essential role in the spatial spread of epidemics. In real-world networks, human mobility patterns vary in a very complicated way, e.g., recurrent visits of patches (Belik et al., 2011a, Belik et al., 2011b, Balcan and Vespignani, 2011, Balcan and Vespignani, 2012), diverse staying period in patches (Poletto et al., 2012), etc. Human behavioral responses to the epidemics have also been found to be able to delay the epidemic spread (Meloni et al., 2011, Wang et al., 2012). With regard to human contact patterns, location-specific contact patterns have been investigated (Wang et al., 2013). Recently, since human contact patterns are temporal, the nature of burstiness and heterogeneity in human activities has been found in empirical studies, and it has striking effects on the speed of spreading (Yang et al., 2011, Iribarren, 2009, Masuda and Holme, 2013). For instance, heterogeneity of human activity is responsible for the slow dynamics of information propagation (Iribarren, 2009).",

With the progression of the outbreak, messages on the epidemics, such as fears of the disease and self-initiated awareness, may be passed from one individual to another (Epstein et al., 2008, Perra et al., 2011). Following the seminal work in Ref. (Funk et al., 2009), the source of information (e.g., local or global awareness) and the pattern of information dissemination have been widely studied (Funk et al., 2010, Wu et al., 2012, Granell et al., 2013, Sahneh et al., 2013, Yuan et al., 2013, Zhang et al., 2014). Depending on the path of information propagation, there are several types of information. For instance, people obtain information from broadcasting and the Internet, which could be taken as a kind of global information. People can also exchange information by face-to-face contacts, which is a kind of contact-based information (Funk et al., 2009). So far, the study of the impacts of information propagation on the epidemic spread has been restricted to individual-based networks, where one node corresponds to one individual (Zhang et al., 2014).",

This has been observed in real-world situations, where people are usually reluctant to visit infected areas (Bajardi et al., 2011, Camitz and Liljeros, 2006). The diameter of human mobility during the H1N1 epidemic has been found to reduce significantly with the progression of alert campaign, which verifies the fact that human beings indeed alter their movements when being exposed to the presence of the information during the outbreak of epidemics (Bajardi et al., 2011).",

With a mean-field approximation of the metapopulation model, we find that both the information efficiency and the mobility patterns jointly affect the epidemic spread in terms of both the outbreak size and the epidemic threshold. When the information efficiency is low, mobility to the patch with more healthy individuals facilitates the epidemic spread with an increased outbreak size and an decreased epidemic threshold, even though more individuals get informed; on the contrary, when the information efficiency is high enough to cause people's attention, mobility to the patch with more healthy individuals, suppresses the epidemic outbreak by informing more individuals. In order to highlight the role of mobility, we apply a simplistic model of information dynamics to that of the disease dynamics; the incorporation of passing messages among mobile individuals in the metapopulation model gives us a new perspective on the countermeasure of epidemics, which is different from the previous studies on the contact-based networks. It suggests a possible way to suppress the epidemic spread by guiding individual mobility patterns in accordance with the evaluation of the risk perception and the information efficiency as well.",

Thus, we focus on the interplay between mobility patterns and information propagation. The role of information in reducing the infection risk is described by the information efficiency, which is classified into two major types: (i) the information that is highly efficient to warn people to take measures in the face of a fatal flu, such as severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS); (ii) the information that cannot cause people's sufficient attention to take measures in the face of an infectious disease, such as seasonal influenza. As a result, the exchange of information on the risk perception may potentially alter human behavior, e.g., contact structures or travel patterns, which in turn influences the spreading process.",

            "text": "The metapopulation approach describes the spatially structured interacting patches, which are connected by the movement of individuals. Inside each patch, individuals are divided into classes that represent their states according to the infection dynamics. To demonstrate the role of information propagation in the epidemic dynamics, we couple a mathematical model similar to the susceptible-infectious-susceptible (SIS) model for the epidemic dynamics with a model for the information propagation. Due to the information propagation, susceptible individuals are further classified into two types: Uninformed susceptible (S) and informed susceptible (A) individuals. Uninformed susceptible individuals are those who have not yet received the information on the epidemic and may get infected by contacting with infectious individuals at transmission rate \u03b2, while informed susceptible individuals (A) may get infected with a reduced transmission rate \u03b2\nA with \u03b2A<\u03b2. This is supported by the fact that people may reduce the number of contacts as a defensive response (Poletti et al., 2009) and they also may get infected with a reduced infection transmission rate by self-awareness, such as wearing face-masks or washing hands frequently (Can et al., 2015, Zhang et al., 2015, Zhang et al., 2016). For convenience, we represent the reduced transmission rate as \u03b2A=(1\u2212\u03b1)\u03b2, where \u03b1 denotes the information efficiency for reduction of infection risk. Infectious individuals may get recovered at rate \u03bc. Here, we assume the nonlimited transmission, where the infection rate is not divided by the total population in the patch. The propagation of information is analogous to that of an infectious disease, often called \u201cinformation contagion\u201d: information is passed from information carriers to uninformed individuals through contact at rate \u03c3, and information carriers may lose the information at rate r as time goes by. We assume that information is passed by contact instead of self-awareness, and for simplicity, we also assume that infectious individuals are ignorant to the information. In fact, it is more realistic to assume that infectious individuals know the infectious status and they may reduce their contact number by being detected or quarantined, however, it is out of the range of this paper and may be investigated in the future. Fig. 1\nillustrates the interplay between the information propagation and the disease spread on metapopulation networks.",

Next, let us consider the diffusion process (Colizza and Vespignani, 2008, Salda\u00f1a, 2008, Juher et al., 2009). Parallel to the contagion process, simultaneously all the individuals move from one patch to another at rate D. In more details, uninformed, informed, and infectious individuals leave the patch at rates D\nS, D\nA, and D\nI, respectively. Considering the heterogeneity in the real-world networks, individuals in state \u03b8 (\u03b8=S,A,I) at patch k\u2032 (patch with degree k\u2032 is briefly denoted by patch k\u2032) move to the neighboring patch k with probability d\u03b8,k\u2032k. Human mobility shows diverse patterns depending on individual's gender, age, and native or non-native (Salon and Gulyani, 2010, Yan et al., 2013, Yang et al., 2017). An explicit expression of d\u03b8,k\u2032k relies on the knowledge of the empirical data on traveling patterns of human beings (Brockmann et al., 2006, Brockmann and Theis, 2008, Gonz\u00e1lez et al., 2008, Song et al., 2010a, Song et al., 2010b).

            "text": "Since the information propagation affects the epidemic spread by informing more individuals of the disease and thereby reducing their risk of infection, mobility patterns of the informed susceptible individuals play a fundamental role in the effectiveness of the information propagation, and thus, affect the epidemic spread. To understand the role of mobility patterns in both the dynamics of epidemic spread and that of the information propagation, we investigate the mobility probability from patch k\u2032 to patch k by assuming the detailed functional form of d\u03b8,k\u2032k for \u03b8=S,A,I. Intuitively, the more healthy individuals a patch contains, the safer the patch is, and individuals usually prefer to move to safer patches, or in other words, in order to prevent infection they attempt to avoid visiting infected patches. To reflect this effect, following Ref. (Wang et al., 2012), we assume that all the individuals move in accordance with the safety level at the destination, which is mathematically expressed by(2)d\u03b8,kk\u2032=(\u03c1S,k\u2032)\u03b3\u03b8k\u2211k\u2033P(k\u2033|k)(\u03c1S,k\u2033)\u03b3\u03b8for\u03b8=S,A,I,for kmin\u2264k,k\u2032\u2264kmax, where the parameter \u03b3\u03b8 controls the dependency on the safety level at the patch. By tuning \u03b3\u03b8, diverse mobility patterns can be observed. For instance, if \u03b3\u03b8>0, the safer the patch is, the more likely it is that individuals move to the patch; this is consistent with the phenomenon that people attempt to bypass infected areas; in order to deploy a systematic study, we also consider the opposite case with \u03b3\u03b8<0, which means that the safer the patch is, the less likely it is that people travel to the patch. This may correspond to the situation that people receive incorrect information. If \u03b3\u03b8=0, the model is reduced to the case of random mobility and Eq. (2) is simplified as follows:(3)d\u03c1S,kdt=\u2212\u03b2\u03c1S,k\u03c1I,k\u2212\u03c3\u03c1S,k\u03c1A,k+\u03bc\u03c1I,k+r\u03c1A,k\u2212DS\u03c1S,k+DSk\u3008k\u3009\u03c1S,d\u03c1A,kdt=\u03c3\u03c1S,k\u03c1A,k\u2212\u03b2A\u03c1A,k\u03c1I,k\u2212r\u03c1A,k\u2212DA\u03c1A,k+DAk\u3008k\u3009\u03c1A,d\u03c1I,kdt=\u03b2\u03c1S,k\u03c1I,k+\u03b2A\u03c1A,k\u03c1I,k\u2212\u03bc\u03c1I,k\u2212DI\u03c1I,k+DIk\u3008k\u3009\u03c1I,for kmin\u2264k\u2264kmax.

The mobility pattern is mainly driven by the risk perception expressed by the safety level at the destination patch. The more healthy individuals a patch contains, the safer it is. Although the model we have proposed is simplistic and more realistic scenarios with detailed mobility patterns are determined by the availability of data, our model captures basic characteristics of the dynamics of information propagation and that of epidemic spread. We find that appropriately incorporating the knowledge of the information efficiency with the guidance of human mobility may effectively mitigate the epidemic outbreak by decreasing the outbreak size and increasing the epidemic threshold.
