Endogenous immunity in cancer patients, such as circulating anticancer antibodies or tumor-reactive B cells, has been historically yet incompletely described. Here, we demonstrate that tumor-draining (sentinel) lymph node (SN) is a rich source for tumor-reactive B cells that give rise to systemic IgG anticancer antibodies circulating in the bloodstream of breast cancer patients. Using a synergistic combination of high-throughput B-cell sequencing and quantitative immunoproteomics, we describe the prospective identification of tumor-reactive SN B cells (based on clonal frequency) and also demonstrate an unequivocal link between affinity-matured expanded B-cell clones in the SN and antitumor IgG in the blood. This technology could facilitate the discovery of antitumor antibody therapeutics and conceivably identify novel tumor antigens. Lastly, these findings highlight the unique and specialized niche the SN can fill in the advancement of cancer immunotherapy.",

            "text": "The recent success with cancer immunotherapy has sparked a renewal of interest in harnessing the immune system for tumor eradication and for the identification of novel tumor antigens in cancer patients. Underlying most approaches to cancer immunotherapy is a pivotal reliance on a complex and enigmatic repertoire of tumor-reactive adaptive immune cells that have been exposed to tumor antigens. The advent of next-generation sequencing and advanced proteomics technologies may allow a comprehensive characterization of the localized repertoire of tumor-reactive lymphocytes found in the tumor or lymph node as well as identification of systemic B-cell-derived circulating antibodies (IgG and IgA). This represents a unique opportunity to discover patient-specific, tumor-reactive cell repertoires, to study their temporal dynamics and antitumor function, and to potentially reveal the tumor antigens they target in vivo. At present, however, there is limited knowledge of tumor-reactive immune repertoires in cancer patients, and it is generally not known to what extent an adaptive immune response is activated in any individual cancer patient when treated with cancer immunotherapy such as immune checkpoint blockade. Given the complexity of the relationship between cancer and the immune system, a better understanding of the parameters of human adaptive immunity and its potential role in the eradication of solid tumors can ultimately be expected to lead to the design of better, personalized therapies.",

The prognosis of breast cancer patients can be significantly correlated with the density and composition of the immune infiltrate at diagnosis, especially in the triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) subtype. The most recent clinical trial data for TNBC-long considered to be an improbable candidate for immunotherapy-confirms that TNBC is immunogenic and responsive to PD-1 checkpoint immune modulation (3, 4) . The anatomic distribution of lymph nodes in breast cancer patients offers a unique glimpse into the dynamics between the tumor and the adaptive immune response as breast cancer lymph, rich in tumor antigens, typically drains directly to a small cluster of interconnected lymph nodes aptly termed tumor-draining lymph nodes or sentinel nodes (SNs) (5, 6) . Recently, there has been significant interest in mining the B cell receptor sequences from SNs, as the presence of tumor antigens is likely to drive affinity maturation of anticancer antibodies (7, 8) .",

Figure 1D illustrates vast differences in the degree of clonal expansion between each of the patients and isotypes. We observed that the class switched IgG and IgA isotypes displayed fewer lineages than the respective IgM compartments. Following 100 repetitions of the random sampling and lineage enumeration used for Figure 1D , the number of IgG and IgA lineages relative to IgM averaged 77% and 83% for BC1, respectively, and 27% and 15% for BC2. This polarization, which was most pronounced in BC2, suggests that the class-switched B cells from the SN are less diverse because they are experiencing antigen-driven clonal expansion.

To elucidate the identity of circulating antibodies from patient BC2, we performed bottom-up proteomics on plasma IgG using a process termed Ig-Seq (20) (21) (22) . Following plasma IgG enrichment and proteolytic cleavage of the hinge region, NY-ESO-1-specific F(ab')2 was isolated with affinity chromatography, digested with trypsin and subjected to LC-MS/MS. The resulting spectra were identified using the donor specific B-cell receptor sequence database generated from the SN ( Figure 1A) . In this experiment, the abundance of each lineage was measured by the intensity of the CDR-H3-J region peptide. Using this approach, we confirmed the presence of BC2-3G and BC2-4G lineages in the plasma. The relative abundances of the plasma response to NY-ESO-1 indicated the presence of all 4 distinct sub-lineages of the BC2-3G lineage (shown in Figure 2A ) and both sub-lineages of BC2-4G. Figure 2F illustrates the observed peptide coverage for BC2-3G lineage 1. Whereas the CDR-H3 peptide is unique to the BC2-3G lineage (indicated by a red underline), many other peptides were observed across multiple lineages due to their low mutation rate (indicated by black underlines). However, it should be noted that due to current limitations in mass spectrometry protein identification, only lineages present in the SN at the time of resection could be identified. Using an in-house spectral classifier, we estimate that this analysis identified ~33% of the CDR-H3-J region peptide spectra observed through LC-MS/MS.",

            "text": "Using NY-ESO-1 tumor antigen as a paradigm, we have comprehensively assayed the humoral immune response to breast cancer by analyzing the B-cell repertoire expanded in the SN and the antigen-specific Ig repertoire in blood plasma using next-generation sequencing and proteomics ( Figure 1A) . We determined the molecular composition of polyclonal immunoglobulins binding NY-ESO-1 and identified B-cell clonal lineages in the SN responsible for the production of these anticancer antibodies. Circulating anticancer IgG antibodies were then quantitated (at monoclonal resolution) and linked conclusively to radically expanded, affinity matured clones residing among total SN B cells. The expansion of SN B cell clones could be represented graphically using mosaic plots, which enabled the prospective identification of tumor-reactive B cells based solely on clonal frequency; these were subsequently confirmed to be specific for NY-ESO-1 when expressed and tested as high-affinity recombinant monoclonal antibodies (mAbs). (8, 23, 24) , here we used next-generation sequencing to provide a comprehensive high-throughput survey of SN B cells; moreover, we obtained natively paired VH and VL sequences at high throughput from SN B cells and validated their tumor specificity and high-affinity binding. This distinction is vital as it provides a depth of coverage that allows us to observe the clonality and phylogeny of the resident B cells, and to infer tumor specificity based upon the extent of clonal expansion. Importantly, because our technology can identify antitumor IgG circulating in plasma that is clonally related to expanded SN B-cell lineages, we can infer which SN B cells give rise to antibody-secreting plasma cells. Our results suggest there is systemic coordination of antitumor immunity and immune activation between a tumor-reactive lymph node and the periphery, in agreement with a recent precedent established for mouse models of tumor immunity (25) . We conclude that chronic exposure to tumor antigens drives clonal expansion and affinity maturation of B cells localized within SNs, which give rise to plasma cells and systemic antitumor IgG. The ability to identify these trained B cell receptors could potentially lead to prognostic indicators and therapeutic antibodies against cancer.",

We identified prospective B-cell lineages to be clonally expanded as evidenced by the sheer number of cognate VH and VL transcripts outputted by the next-generation sequencing reaction. Furthermore, each of the top B-cell lineages examined could be categorized into multiple VH sub-lineages differentiated solely by sequence variability in a key peptide interval, the CDR-H3 region, long regarded as an identifying \"fingerprint\" of B-cell progenitors and their progeny; CDR-H3 lies at the center of the antibody binding site, is known to be a mutation hotspot for affinity maturation, and is a primary determinant of antibody specificity (26, 27) . Third, we observed a higher frequency of mutations focused on all of the CDR regions when compared to the framework regions, and also a high rate of mutations shared between the VH and VL sub-lineages ( Figure 2C-D) , indicating that these mutations could not result from randomly distributed PCR or sequencing errors. It should be noted that our analysis did not exclude any B cell phenotype; the process was performed on the mixture of total B cells, whether antibody-secreting plasmablasts, memory B cells, or na\u00efve B cells present in the SN. PCR bias did not influence the number of reads per lineage, for we observed a strong correlation between the frequency of V-gene usage in the top 1000 and bottom 1000 lineages ranked by read count (Spearman \u03c1=0.95).",

            "text": "In addition to these sequence and phylogenetic analyses, we also demonstrated empirically that the B cells in an expanded lineage had experienced affinity-based maturation and selection. We expressed four mAbs representative of each VH sub-lineage and characterized their affinity to the tumor antigen NY-ESO-1. We observed a clear stepwise correlation between affinity for the antigen and the number of VH and VL somatic mutations. Thus, screening for expanded and branched B cell phylogenies isolated from a SN may prove a useful approach to discover affinity-matured antibodies even with no a priori knowledge of antigen-specificity. While the strategy presented in this paper highlights antibody lineages that recognize the NY-ESO-1 tumor antigen, it follows that a target-agnostic approach of mining the SN for autoantibodies could be applied to other known tumor antigens as well as those yet to be discovered. Although SNs are not present in every form of cancer, we believe that this technique can be applied to a variety of relevant B cell populations, including those isolated from ectopic germinal centers and tumor tissue. Slight modifications to the VH:VL BCR-Seq technology have also allowed us to analyze the natively paired T cell receptor (TCR)\u03b2:TCR\u03b1 repertoire at high throughput (manuscript in preparation), suggesting that we may soon be able to determine the cognate BCR and TCR antitumor repertoire from SNs. Similar to our observations with B cells, we anticipate discovery of NY-ESO-1specific T cells identifiable by clonal expansion in the SN (28, 29) . This may prove a significant step forward in the development of patient-specific combination adoptive cell therapies. NY-ESO-1 is an attractive candidate for immunotherapy in TNBC (30) and early-phase clinical trials of NY-ESO-1 TCR immunotherapy have shown remarkable 55%-80% objective clinical response rates for melanoma, synovial sarcoma, and multiple myeloma (31, 32) .",

Whereas our approach was sufficient to demonstrate that highly expanded B cell lineages are clonally related to antitumor IgG circulating in the blood, a complete accounting of the tumor-specific serological repertoire would likely require a comprehensive database assembled from multiple tissues in addition to the SN-including primary tumor, bone marrow, and peripheral blood, which will be the focus of future studies. As a diagnostics tool, we envision that Ig-Seq humoral monitoring may be predictive of clinical outcomes, such as the prediction of partial versus complete responses (versus stable disease) for patients treated with immune checkpoint blockade. As a discovery platform, Ig-Seq could facilitate the discovery of antitumor antibody therapeutics, innately endowed with optimized drug-like properties. The platform could also conceivably identify novel tumor antigens, including tumor mutations, using the patientspecific affinity-selected antitumor antibodies as bait; this approach holds promise to address the current deficit of targets delimiting the field of immuno-oncology.",

Sublineages were defined on the basis of the CDR-H3 amino acid sequence.",

Total IgG (7.5 mg) was isolated from 1 mL plasma using Protein G Plus agarose (Thermo Fisher Scientific) affinity chromatography and cleaved into F(ab')2 fragments using IgeS (FabRICATOR; Genovis). NY-ESO-1 specific F(ab')2 was isolated by affinity chromatography using recombinant NY-ESO-1 coupled to NHS-activated agarose resin (Thermo Fisher Scientific). F(ab')2 was applied to the column in gravity mode with the flow-through collected. Following elution with 100 mM glycine-HCl pH 2.7 and neutralization, the protein-containing fractions were pooled and prepared for LC-MS/MS as described previously (9) . Briefly, the antigen-specific elution and the non-specific flow-through were separately concentrated, denatured in 50% (v/v) TFE and 10 mM PBS, reduced with 2.5 mM DTT, and incubated at 55\u02daC for 45 min. The samples were then alkylated with 15 mM iodoacetamide (Sigma) for 30 min at RT in the dark. Each sample was diluted 10x with 40 mM Tris-HCl pH 8.0 and digested with trypsin (1:50 trypsin/protein) for 4 hrs at 37\u02daC. Formic acid (1% v/v) was used to quench the digestion. The peptides were then concentrated under vacuum, resuspended in 5% acetonitrile and 0.1% formic acid, and washed on C18-SpinTips (Thermo Fisher Scientific) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Finally, the peptides were analyzed by liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) using a Dionex UltiMate 3000 RSLCnano reverse phase chromatography system (Dionex Acclaim PepMapRSLC C18 column; Thermo Scientific) coupled to an Orbitrap Velos Pro mass spectrometer (Thermo Scientific). Parent ion MS1 scans were collected in the Orbitrap at 60,000 resolution. Ions with >+1 charge were fragmented by collision-induced dissociation (NCE 35), with a maximum of 20 MS2 spectra collected per MS1. Ions selected twice in a 30-second window were dynamically excluded for 45 seconds. Both the elution and the flow through were run three times.",

High confidence peptide spectrum matches (PSMs) were filtered with Percolator (Proteome Discoverer1.4) at a false discovery rate of <1%, and only peptides with an average mass deviation <1.5 ppm were retained for downstream analysis. The full-length VH IgG sequences were organized into protein groups using a single-linkage hierarchical clustering algorithm requiring \u226590% amino acid identity in the CDR-H3 as measured by edit distance (41) ; peptides mapping to only a single protein group were considered informative.

(i) BCR-Seq utilizes patient-specific B cells to (ii) build a patient-specific next-generation VH:VL paired sequencing database. The database is then used to (iii) identify highly expanded lineages by mosaic profiling and (iv) construct phylogenetic trees to describe clonal relationships. (v) The Ig-Seq pipeline isolates (vi) total IgG from plasma and (vii) uses affinity chromatography to enrich the sample for antibodies against a specific antigen. (viii) The IgG molecules are cleaved into peptides, run on LC-MS/MS, and (ix) identified by mapping the MS spectra to the sequencing database. (B) An ELISA was used to identify NY-ESO-1 sero-positive patients by screening blood plasma. BC1 and BC2 were selected for further characterization due to the presence of anti-NY-ESO-1 antibodies. The antigen panel included: HER2, NY-ESO-1, MUC-1, p53, and Hemagglutinin Flu b (HA) protein as a positive control. Values represent mean \u00b1 SD (n=2). (C) NY-ESO-1 expression was detected in the tumor tissue of breast cancer patients BC1 and BC2. Representative fluorescent images of tumor tissue stained with anti-NY-ESO-1 followed by Alexa fluor 555 conjugated goat anti-mouse-IgG (H+L) secondary (top images) or secondary antibody only (bottom images). (D) Mosaic profiles of expanded B cell clones in the SN. The size of each square is relative to the frequency of NGS reads assigned to each lineage following downsampling to normalize the number of reads across patients and isotypes.
