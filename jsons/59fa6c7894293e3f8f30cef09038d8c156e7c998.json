            "text": "Sialic acids (Sia) are a family of nine-carbon a-keto acids ( Fig. 1) found predominantly at the non-reducing end of oligosaccharide chains on glycoproteins and glycolipids. Sia can occur free in nature, but are generally found glycosidically linked to either the 3-or 6-hydroxyl group of galactose (Gal) residues or to the 6-hydroxyl group of Nacetylglucosamine (GlcNAc) or N-acetylgalactosamine (GalNAc) residues. Sia can also exist as a2,8-linked homopolymers known as polysialic acid (Fig. 1) . The expression of Sia was previously thought to be unique to deuterostomes and pathogenic bacteria infecting these animals; however, more recent findings suggest that they may be more widely distributed and possibly quite ancient in their origin [1, 2] . Sia show remarkable structural diversity, with the family currently comprising over 50 naturally occurring members [1, 2] . The largest structural variations of naturally occurring Sia are at carbon 5, which can be substituted with either an acetamido, hydroxyacetamido or hydroxyl moiety to form 5-N-acetylneuraminic acid (Neu5Ac), 5-N-glycolylneuraminic acid (Neu5Gc) or deaminoneuraminic acids (KDN), respectively ( Fig. 1) [1]. Further structural diversity is generated primarily by a combination of the above-mentioned variations at C-5, with modifications of any of the hydroxyl groups located at C-4, C-7, C-8 and C-9. The diversity of Sia structure is reflected by its involvement in a variety of biological functions, many stemming from its unique physical and chemical properties, such as charge and size. For those interested in this aspect of Sia biology we recommend several excellent reviews [1-3]. Beside the more general functions attributed to its unique physiochemical properties, Sia can also mediate a variety of specific recognition processes [3] . For instance, as the terminal residues on many glycoconjugates, Sia can mask underlying structures, as observed for erythrocytes and other blood cells, as well as serum glycoproteins, where the In contrast to masking, Sia can also directly participate in a variety of recognition events (Fig. 2) , with this probably being its most important role. First noted in microorganisms, Sia are now recognized as being the most common ligand (or receptor) for pathogenic and non-pathogenic viruses, bacteria and protozoa. Obviously, if Sia only served as recognition sites for pathogens, the biosynthesis of such a complex monosaccharide would have been eliminated during evolution in higher animals. However, due to their exposed position on cell surfaces, Sia have evolved not only to shield cells from the environment, but also as recognition markers in multicellular organisms. Sugar-binding proteins (excluding antibodies and enzymes) are collectively called lectins, and there are numerous Sia-specific lectins in nature. This review will present a detailed overview of the occurrence, specificity and function of Sia-specific lectins, particular in viruses, bacteria and non-vertebrate eukaryotes. In all cases, where the crystal structures of Sia-specific lectins have been elucidated, these are cited within the Tables.",

Attachment strategies employed by viruses involve multiple interactions between several viral and cellular molecules. Many viruses employ an adhesion-strengthening attachment strategy in which primary virus-cell interactions involve low-affinity adhesion of the virus to common cell surface molecules that are often carbohydrates in nature. This initial phase of attachment is then followed by higher-affinity interactions between the virus and a secondary receptor on permissive cells, an event that often triggers virus entry. Members of at least eight different virus families exploit sialoglycoconjugates for attachment. Some viruses bind preferentially to Sia attached via a particular glycosidic linkage, and this specificity may contribute to virus host range, tissue tropism and pathogenesis. In this section, we will discuss the role of viral Sia-specific lectins in host cell infection and pathogenesis, specifically Sia-lectins from influenza virus, paramyxovirus, reovirus and picornavirus. A comprehensive list of viral Sia-specific lectins thus far identified is presented in Table 1 .",

The avian influenza virus exclusively binds Siaa2,3Gal, thus limiting the host range to those species possessing these receptor structures (e.g. birds, horses and pigs). Recently, however, ciliated cells of the human trachea were found to contain a2,3-linked Neu5Ac and were able to replicate some avian influenza variants [6] . This finding provides a plausible mechanism accounting for the recent infections and fatalities associated with the H5N1 strain that were acquired only through direct contact with infected birds. The mechanism of H7N7 transmission discovered in the Netherlands is unknown. On the other hand, the H9N2 strain has acquired a preference for a2,6-linked Neu5Ac, therefore potentially being transmissible from human to human [7] . However, H9N2 has only caused mild symptoms in infected individuals, and no cases of human-to-human transmission have been reported. This indicates that an avian influenza virus with HA specificity similar to human strains, therefore allowing humanto-human transmission, is plausible.",

The most probable mechanism involves the participation of an intermediate host that can replicate both avian and human viruses, thus acting as a mixing vessel. Pigs represent one such adaptive host, since they possess both a2,3and a2,6-linkages and have been shown to bind avian and human influenza A viruses [8] . Interestingly, the HA specificity of the Spanish flu, a strain that resulted in 20 million deaths in 1918/19, possesses the binding site specificity of an avian HA [9, 10], but preferentially binds Neu5Aca2,6Gal [11] . The available crystal structure [9, 10], as well as recent binding studies [12] , strongly suggests that the exchange of Glu190 in the avian HA with Asp190 in Spanish flu HA leads to a subtle increase in binding pocket size that is then able to accommodate the binding of Neu5Aca2,6Gal structures.

These viruses also express a spike protein (S) on their surface that has greater HA than HE activity and also binds Neu5,9Ac 2 [22] . This suggests that after initiating the infection by attachment to host cell surface Neu5,9Ac 2 , a secondary interaction of the S protein with a specific protein receptor is necessary for activation of the fusion process [23] . Interestingly, analysis of the murine hepatitis virus MHV-S and MHV-JHM strains with free Sia derivatives show that their HE specifically recognizes 4-O-acetyl Sia (Neu4,5Ac 2 ) and not Neu5,9Ac 2 . Since Neu4,5Ac 2 has not been found in mice, the nature of the substrates and/or secondary receptors for MHV-S in the natural host remains to be determined [24] . In contrast, avian infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) and the transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV) do not possess genes encoding HE, and instead bind non-acetylated a2,3-linked Sia [25, 26] . This interaction is not only important for enhancing cell attachment and entry, but also increases the stability of the virus against detergent-like bile salts encountered in the gastrointestinal tract [27] . Furthermore, a role in overcoming the mucus barrier and intestinal peristalsis by binding of virions to Sia of mucin-type glycoproteins has been postulated [28] .",

            "text": "Reoviruses belong to the family Reoviridae, which includes the orthoreoviruses, rotaviruses, Colorado tick fever and Bluetongue virus. Within the orthoreoviruses, most serotype 3 viruses bind cell surface Sia. Infections are initiated by the binding of the viral attachment protein, s1, to receptors on the host cell surface. The s1 protein consists of two distinct receptor-binding regions, a Sia-binding fibrous tail lectin domain and a junctional adhesion molecule-1 (JAM1)-binding globular head domain [29, 30] . The ability of the s1 lectin domain to utilize Sia as a viral coreceptor is dictated by a single amino acid, with the exchange of Leu204 to Pro204 converting a Sia negative binding (Sia -) phenotype to a Sia-positive binding (Sia + ) phenotype [30] . In the case of Sia + reovirus strains, initial binding is likely to be via multivalent virion-Sia interactions. By virtue of its rapid association rate, this interaction attaches the virion to the cell surface, enabling it to diffuse laterally until it interacts with the s1 head receptor molecule. This secondary interaction with JAM1 seems to be the only binding event available to Siastrains and may be necessary and sufficient for virus endocytosis [31] . Although serotype 1 reoviruses were initially thought not to bind Sia, recent studies have now shown that a2,3-linked Neu5Ac is involved in reovirus T1L binding to rabbit M cells and polarized Caco-2 BBe cells [32] . Rotaviruses, the leading cause of gastroenteritis in humans, possess an outermost layer composed of two proteins, VP4 and VP7. Treatment of the virus with trypsin results in the specific cleavage of VP4 into the polypeptides denoted as VP8* and VP5*. It is generally accepted that Neu5Ac is required by several animal rotavirus strains to attach to the cell surface. The infectivity of some of these strains is greatly diminished by the treatment of cells with sialidase; consequently, these strains are termed sialidase-sensitive. By contrast, many animal strains and most strains isolated from humans are sialidase-resistant [33] . This is believed to be due to the ability of these strains to bind gangliosides that possess internal Sia that are resistant to sialidase treatment [34] .",

A recently proposed model suggests that the initial contact of a sialidase-sensitive virus strain with the cell surface is through the binding of the VP8* domain of VP4 to a ganglioside receptor which induces a conformational change in VP4, thus allowing the virus to interact with integrin a2b1 through VP5*. Following this second interaction, one to three additional interactions take place involving VP5* and VP7, integrins avb3 and axb2, and probably other proteins [36] .",

Moreover, the hepatitis A Cell. Mol. Life Sci. Vol. 63, 2006 Review Article 1337 virus (HAV) has recently been found to bind human red blood cells through an interaction with sialoglycoproteins [42] . Among the enteroviruses (EV), EV70 is the only human EV requiring cell surface Sia for attachment, with a strong preference for O-linked glycans containing terminal Siaa2,3-linked to galactose [43] . TMEV is unique among picornaviruses because of the existence of two naturally occurring neurovirulence groups with distinct disease phenotypes and highly similar amino acid sequences (>90%) and capsid structures [44] . While it is possible that members of the two TMEV neurovirulence groups use the same receptor protein, the attachment factors (co-receptors) clearly differ. While highneurovirulence strains bind the proteoglycan heparan sulfate, low-neurovirulence strains bind a2,3-linked Sia moieties on N-linked oligosaccharides [44] . Site-specific mutations together with crystallographic studies revealed four tightly clustered virus capsid amino acids, all within a positively charged area on the viral surface, with Sia contact through non-covalent hydrogen bonds being important for low-neurovirulence strain central nervous system persistence [45] .",

Bacterial surface components that mediate adherence are collectively called adhesins. Because cell surfaces are decorated with glycoconjugates, it is not surprising that an increasing number of carbohydratespecific bacterial adhesins have been discovered. Several Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacteria have been reported to use Sia-containing glycoconjugates on host cells as ligands (see Table 2 for full listing), although the identity of the specific bacterial lectin (or adhesin) remains uncertain in many cases. Often, these lectins are associated with multi-subunit fimbriae or pili, with the expression of specific lectins being responsible for the tissue tropism of infections.",

Pathogenic E. coli express several classes of fimbriae-associated lectins that mediate attachment through specific binding to different glycoconjugate receptors on a variety of human cells [46] . Strains shown to use sialoglycoconjugates as attachment sites express either S-fimbriae, K99-fimbriae, the F41 adhesin or one of the colonization factor antigens (CFA) [47] . S-fimbriae were found to preferentially bind to gangliosides carrying Neu5Gca2,3Gal and Neu5Aca2,8Neu5Ac structures, with the C-8 and C-9 hydroxyl groups on Sia being required for recognition [48] . The adhesion protein, SFaS, a minor component of the multi-subunit S-fimbriae, has been cloned and characterized [47] . Mutagenesis studies suggest that the amino acids Lys116 and Arg118 influence SfaS binding to Sia [49] . Notably, these amino acids are part of a stretch of conserved amino acids which are also found in other bacterial Sia-binding lectins such as CFAI and K99 adhesins of E. coli and the Vibrio cholerae toxin B subunit, as well as the E. coli toxin LTI-B [49] . The K99 fimbrial antigen is often found in enterotoxigenic E. coli isolated from calves, piglets and lambs suffering from diarrhoea. In contrast to S-fimbriae, where the adhesin SfaS is only a minor component, in K99fimbriae the Sia binding site is found in the major subunit. The presence of a hydrophobic region close to the binding site seems to enhance Sia binding affinity [50, 51] , which favours Neu5Gc over Neu5Ac. The specific recognition of Neu5GcLacCer by K99-fimbriated E. coli might contribute to host specificity, since humans and animals that lack Neu5Gc cannot be infected [52] . Often expressed simultaneously with K99 is F41, which binds glycophorin A with a clear selectivity for the M blood type [53] . Although the binding of F41 to glycophorin is clearly Sia-dependent, the polypeptide must also be involved since the M and N blood type determinant resides in the amino acid composition.",

A prominent feature of H. pylori-induced gastritis is infiltration of neutrophils into the gastric epithelium, leading to phagocytosis and an oxidative burst with production of reactive oxygen metabolites, which may provide the nutritional source for the bacterium [65] . Thus, initial attachment of H. pylori may be achieved through binding to receptors present in the normal gastric epithelium (e.g. Le b antigen and lactotetraosylceramide), whereas the Sia binding capacity of H. pylori mediates adhesion through lectins such as SabA to the epithelium in the already diseased stomach [64] .",

The HMW1 and HMW2 proteins from H. influenzae are high-molecularweight adhesins that mediate binding to cultured epithelial cells. HMW1-mediated adherence studies revealed the involvement of a surface glycoprotein containing Nlinked oligosaccharide chains with terminal a2,3-linked Sia [70] . HMW1 binding to oropharyngeal epithelial cells and human erythrocytes was also inhibited by the gangliosides GM1, GM2 and GDla [71] . However, because GM1, GM2 and GDla are not involved in HMW1 attachment, a distinct receptor for HMW1 with a complementary function in the process of colonization has been suggested [70] . In addition, proteins P5 and P2, the most abundant major outer membrane proteins of H. influenzae, appear capable of interacting with mucin via Sia-containing oligosaccharides. Although this property may not impart long-term advantage on H. influenzae, in a normal host with intact mucociliary function it may facilitate the establishment of infection in conditions associated with an abnormality in mucus clearance, such as chronic bronchitis and cystic fibrosis [68] .",

These toxins classically bind to oligosaccharide receptors on host cell surfaces, and many of them show high specificity toward Sia, generally located on gangliosides [80] . Many belong to the AB 5 family of toxins with an A-subunit carrying the catalytic domain of the toxin, while the B-subunit is responsible for binding the holotoxin to a receptor on the surface of the target cell, an obligatory step for the uptake of the enzymatic A-subunit. One of the best examples of a Sia-binding soluble lectin belonging to the AB 5 family is cholera toxin, produced by V. cholerae. The B-subunit exhibits specific binding to ganglioside GM1, delivering the A-subunit to the cytosol.

Initial studies showed that an enzymatically inactive recombinant TS, which was able to agglutinate desialylated erythrocytes, possessed b-Gal binding activity [84] . More recent studies have shown that the inactive TS can also act as a Sia-recognizing lectin capable of stimulating CD4 + T cell activation in vitro and in vivo.

Plasmodium species are the causative agents of malaria, a disease that afflicts millions Review Article 1341 worldwide, with P. falciparum responsible for the most severe form of human malaria. Parasite invasion is composed of an initial phase of random cell-cell contact, followed by reorientation and specific receptor-ligand interactions and subsequent entry into host erythrocytes [87] . Parasite proteins, which mediate interaction with erythrocyte receptors, whether Sia-dependent or -independent, belong to a family of erythrocyte-binding proteins (EBP). The erythrocyte-binding antigen-175 (EBA-175) [88, 89] and its paralogue, EBA-140 [90, 91] and EBA-181 [92] , are EBP of P. falciparum that belong to the Duffy binding-like protein family and require Sia on host receptors for binding and invasion. P. falciparum utilizes a number of receptors on the erythrocyte surface for merozoite invasion. The glycophorins (A, B and C), sialoglycoproteins present on the erythrocyte surface, serve as the major receptors for Sia-dependent invasion of erythrocytes [93] . Glycophorin A has been identified as the binding partner of EBA-175 [89] , whereas EBA-140 binds glycophorin C. Glycophorin B and the so-called receptor E can also bind P. falciparum in a sialidase-sensitive manner; however, the parasitic lectin responsible for binding in both cases remains to be identified [94] . The Sia-containing receptor for EBA-181 remains unidentified; however, it has been shown that it differs from the EBA-175 and EBA-140 receptors [92] . These studies and others [95, 96] , which specifically investigated EBA-175 binding to glycophorin A, show that the binding specificity of each parasitic binding protein is defined not only by the presence of Sia but also by the protein backbone. The recently published crystal structure of the erythrocyte binding domain of EBA-175, RII, complexed with a2,3-sialyllactose was found to be dimeric, displaying two prominent channels that contain four of the six observed glycan binding sites. Each monomer consists of two Duffy binding-like domains (F1 and F2), with F2 more prominently lining the channels and making the majority of the glycan contacts. Based on this structure a model, where RII dimerizes upon binding to glycophorin A on the erythrocyte surface during the invasion process, has been proposed [97] .",

This indicates that those species that are primarily parasitic may express more Sia-specific lectin than those that normally inhabit the soil.

In all cases infection begins with the inhalation of conidia, which adhere and germinate in the lung. The involvement of Sia in fungal biology has been most extensively studied in A. fumigatus, with several groups having investigated the Sia-dependent adhesion of A. fumigatus conidia to purified extracellular matrix protein (ECM) proteins [105, 106] . The participation of Sia in conidia-ECM adhesion was first proposed following the observation that conidial binding to laminin, fibrinogen and fibronectin could be inhibited by Neu5Ac and sialyllactose [107] . This led the authors to hypothesize the presence of a specific lectin on the conidial wall that binds Sia expressed on ECM proteins, a proposition later substantiated with the purification of a Sia-specific lectin from A. fumigatus [108] . To our knowledge this is the only Sia-specific lectin from a human pathogenic fungal species to be purified, thus providing an opportunity for the identification of similar lectins from other species, as well as providing the first clues as to the role of Sia in fungal pathogenicity. The ability of the purified A. fumigatus Sia-lectin to agglutinate erythrocytes was affected only by Neu5Ac and Sia-containing glycoproteins, including bovine mucin and fetuin, whereas Sia-containing colominic acid and human orosomucoid (a 1 -acid glycoprotein) were unable to inhibit haemagglutination activity. The major oligosaccharides present on human a 1 -acid glycoprotein are tri-and tetra-antennary N-glycans with terminal Neu5Aca2,3/ 6Galb1,4GlcNAc structures [109] . On the other hand, bovine mucin and fetuin contain a significant number of O-glycans with GlcNAcb1,3(Neu5Aca2,6)GalNAc-Ser/ Thr [110] and Neu5Aca2,3Galb1,3(Neu5Aca2,6)GalNA c-Ser/Thr [111] structures, respectively. Therefore, it appears that the Sia-specific lectin from A. fumigatus may recognize Neu5Aca2,6GalNAc structures preferentially over other Sia linkages.",

            "text": "Even though only a handful of Sia-specific lectins have been identified and isolated from plants (see Table 5 and references therein), their historical importance in investigating the expression and biology of Sia is unquestioned. The occurrence, specificity and application of Sia-specific plant lectins has been reviewed elsewhere [112] ; therefore, we will concentrate on the possible significance and function of these lectins in plant biology. A popular theory used to account for the presence of Siaspecific lectins in plants concerns their involvement in plant defence [113] . Some arguments in favour of this role include the fact that these lectins specifically bind Sia [114, 115] , a carbohydrate that plants themselves do not express. This may provide plants with a means of recognizing and combating sialylated pathogens. Further, the digestive tracts of animals capable of feeding on plants are covered with highly sialylated mucins, providing numerous ligands for Sia-specific lectins. Presumably, it is this binding of Sia-specific lectins from elderberry (Sambucus nigra) bark and wheat germ agglutinin that initiates the severe toxicity symptoms observed upon ingestion of plant lectins in higher organisms. The consequence of this is that elderberry, for example, is virtually never attacked in the wild [113] . Moreover, Sia-specific plant lectins, like other plant lectins, are predominantly localized in regions of the plant that are most susceptible to attack, and thus require an adequate protection strategy. For instance, the lectin from elderberry and the leguminous plant Maackia amurensis are found in the bark and seed, respectively [114, 115] . Peumans and van Damme have Cell. Mol. Life Sci. Vol. 63, 2006 Review Article 1343 suggested that this aspect of plant physiology has a direct influence on viability, arguing that 'a growing plant that is half eaten... may [still] survive and even produce viable offspring' [113] . All of the above hypotheses are based on the assertion that a family of plant lectins actually exists that specifically binds Sia. However, this view is not universally shared. The presence of Sia, is thought by some, to only provide an acidic group that enhances the interaction [116] . That is, the interaction with Sia-containing glycoconjugates is believed to be a purely coincidental one. Evidence supporting this assertion includes the observation that free Sia does not interact with 'putative' Sia-specific plant lectins, with Gal or lactose being the real binding partner [117] . The crystal structure of M. amurensis lectin complexed with sialoglycoconjugates shows that a Gal residue occupies the primary binding site [118] . A sulfate group at C3 of Gal instead of Sia was found to bind M. amurensis lectin, indicating that only a charged group is required rather than a complete Sia molecule [119] . However, this would mean that the presence of a Sia molecule, regardless of linkage, would elicit the same effect. This is clearly not the case (see Table 5 ). Finally, Sia-specific lectins appear not to be as widespread in plants as would be expected given their proposed importance in plant defence. In spite of these arguments it is nevertheless difficult to reconcile this view with the fact that these lectins show exquisite specificity for what in essence are the natural sialoglycoconjugates that they would encounter in nature. It is therefore reasonable to suggest that due to evolutionary pressure placed on these plants by sialylated pathogens and/or predators, they have developed extremely specific defence mechanisms.",

Even though for many individual lectins a function is unknown, for the majority their principal role seems to relate to the proper function of the immune system. There are a variety of lectins reported to bind Sia with high specificity in different animal phyla. This strict specificity is of obvious importance, ensuring proper function and regulation of these lectins. However, animals must also cope with numerous pathogens that, as we have already discussed, bind to their hosts via Sia. Since many pathogens have evolved lectins that are highly specific for Sia type and linkage, their hosts have needed to counter with various modifications to avert pathogenic entry, all the while ensuring that the proper ligands for their endogenous lectins are preserved. This 'arms-race', a term used by Angata and Varki [2] , between host and pathogen not only explains the unusual structural complexity of Sia, but also the rapid evolution of some Sia-recognizing lectins, as is the case for the CD33-related siglecs [120] . This section will summarize the numerous Sia-binding proteins identified from invertebrate and vertebrate animals, their function and significance in animal biology.",

Even though some of these lectins have served as useful tools for the analysis of Sia-containing glycoconjugates, their natural function, in many cases, is unclear. In a similar way to that postulated in plants, it has been assumed that most of these lectins play some role in the defence mechanism against bacterial infections [121] . Invertebrates, without the benefit of an adaptive immune system, possess an immensely strong innate immune response to counteract the continuous challenge of infection. Innate immunity is mainly targeted toward antigens such as lipopolysaccharides commonly present on the In addition to their role in the immune system, invertebrate lectins have been reported to play an important role in sperm-egg binding, as shown for the species-specific Sia-binding protein [350-kDa sperm-binding protein (SBP)] found in sea urchins [123] .",

The first vertebrate Sia-binding protein reported was Complement Factor H, a soluble serum fac-tor that is part of the alternative pathway of complement, one of the earliest response components of the innate immune system [124] . Another important group of vertebrate Sia-binding proteins are the selectins, a family of C-type lectins that recognize sialyl Lewis x (sLe x ) and sialyl Lewis a (sLe a ) [125] . Together with other cell adhesion molecules, selectins mediate the adhesion and extravasation of leukocytes from the vascular bed into the surrounding tissue [126] . Furthermore, P-selectin has also been shown to be involved in tumour metastasis [127] . Siglecs are the largest family of sialic acid-recognizing lectins identified thus far with 11 members identified in the human genome. Each siglec has a distinct preference for specific Sia type and linkage (see Table 7 ). Apart from Siglec-4, all siglecs are expressed by cells of the immune system. However, the function/s of most members of the siglec family are only poorly understood, though their cell-type-specific expression suggests involvement in discrete cellular events. For further information we recommend that interested readers see recent comprehensive reviews from Varki and Angata [120] and Crocker [128] .",

This is particularly the case in the microbial world, where it seems probable that a vast array of Siaspecific lectins with unique specificities and functions exist that may not only prove useful tools for studying the biology of Sia, but may even represent novel targets for drug discovery. The biological roles of many of the Sia-specific lectins described still remain unknown; therefore, detailed investigations are necessary to further analyse the interaction of Sia-binding proteins with their counter-receptors, as well as to elucidate the resulting signals controlling their function. This will not only broaden our understanding of the role of Sia in biological systems but also its relevance in biomedical research. Of particular importance is the need for sialobiologists to better understand how Sia and Sia-specific lectins drive the constantly evolving 'armsrace' being waged between pathogenic microorganisms and their hosts.",

For a recent review describing the role of sialidase in influenza virus infection see [5 and references therein]. Work performed by Suzuki et al. has demonstrated that the host range variation in influenza virus A is due in part to the type of Sia linkage present on the host cell receptor (reviewed in [5]). Therefore, we will only briefly describe the relevance of the Sia linkage specificity of influenza virus A HA, predominantly as it relates to the H5N1, H9N2 and H7N7 strains of avian influenza virus.
