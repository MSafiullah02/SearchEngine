The CT imaging showed bilateral pneumonia in all five patients with characteristic flake-like or regional ground-glass opacity in segments or lobes ( Figure S1 ; Table S1 ). The opacity was often associated with peripheral lung with no clear subpleural sparing. The CT findings were consistent with early reports. [5, 6] We recorded and analyzed the treatment of five patients (see also supplementary results and discussions; Table S2 ). Notably, Patients 1-5 gave birth to five neonates with the weight ranging from 2.45-3.76 kg ( Table 2) . None of neonates display respiratory infection-related symptoms, including fever, cough, polypnea, dyspnea, cyanosis of lips, and tri-retraction sign at birth. The Apgar scores ranged 7-8 for 1 min, 8-9 for 5 min, and 10 for 10 min (Table 2 ). Once they were born, the neonates were separated from their mothers without breast feeding. The neonate of Patient 1 but not the other neonates had scattered skin rashes in face and body, which was reduced in the next day and gradually disappeared within 7 days. The throat swab specimens from all five neonates were collected at 8, 1, 8, 1, 0 days after birth, respectively, and were all SARS-CoV-2 PCR tested negative (Table 2 ). According to our observation, as of Feb 24, none of these neonates developed any respiratory or systemic symptoms (10-33 days after birth), which were much longer than the currently reported SARS-CoV-2 incubation time (4.1 to 7.0 days, 95% confidence interval). [7] SARS-CoV-2, a new member of the coronavirus family, is a single stranded RNA virus that was first identified in Wuhan, China on Jan 7. Similar to SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, it can cause severe respiratory illness in infected humans. [8] [9] [10] Early studies revealed that female patients accounted for 32-44% of COVID-19-infected population. [5, 7] Although our pregnant COVID-19 patients (average 29 years, Table 1 ) were younger than affected general adults (average 56 years), [4] they were vulnerable given their immune tolerant conditions during pregnancy. [11] [12] [13] Given that Wuhan has an estimated 120 thousands pregnant women annually, [14] approximately 20,000 of them were currently under COVID-19 infection threat. Given the estimated size doubling-time 7.4 days [7] and the nationwide confirmed over 77,000 cases (as of Feb 24), more pregnant women are expected to be diagnosed. To provide more information on the management of pregnant COVID-19 patients and the vertical transmission of SARS-CoV-2, in this study, we retrospectively analyzed the clinical features of pregnant women with SARS-CoV-2-infected pneumonia and health conditions of their neonates.",

[19, 20] In a 12-case study, [21] the 2003 SAS-CoV reportedly caused the death of three women, miscarriage (57%, 4 of 7 first-trimester patients), fetal growth restriction (40%, 2 of 5 second/ third trimester patients), and premature birth (80%, 4 of 5 patients). As for MERS-CoV, it caused even more detrimental outcomes with 91% women (10 of 11 patients) having poor outcomes and 82% neonates having critical conditions and even death. [22] In this study, all the COVID-19 infected patients gave safe birth. The neonates were immediately separated from their mothers once they were born. The skin rashes were observed in one (20%) of the five neonates (Patient 1) (Table 1 and 2). From the birth of these neonates until now, none of these babies developed any respiratory systems or pneumonia-associated symptoms. They seemed not to be locally or systemically impacted by COVID-19 infection in their mothers. This was similarly observed for other coronaviruses, such as SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV-infected mothers and their infants. [21, 23, 24] All neonates' throat swabs were PCR tested negative (Table 2) . Thus, collectively, our observations did not support vertical virus transmission between these five infected mothers and their babies, consistent with a recent study. [1] Meanwhile, to protect neonates from SARS-CoV-2 infections after birth, we recommend prevention measures as follows: the neonates should be immediately isolated for a 14-day medical observation; breast feeding should be avoided; a 14-day isolation is also required for their mothers after discharge.",
