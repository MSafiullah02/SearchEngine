Another study from China reported that increased expression of interleukin (IL)-2R and IL-6 in serum appears to predict the severity and prognosis of patients with COVID-19 [2]. Additionally, pathological examination of a biopsy sample from a patient who died from COVID-19 revealed interstitial mononuclear inflammatory infiltrates in both lungs, dominated by lymphocytes [3]. Furthermore, peripheral blood flow cytometric analysis showed that overactivation of T cells accounted, in part, for the severe immune injury in this patient [3]. Thus, cytokine storms should not be neglected in the treatment of COVID-19.",

A new treatment strategy, in addition to antiviral therapy alone, is likely to be required to have a significant impact on clinical outcome. Immunomodulatory therapy to down-regulate the cytokine storm may provide insights into the treatment of COVID-19. Combined use of an immunomodulatory agent \u2013 to reduce the cytokine storm \u2013 with an antiviral agent may give physicians more time to provide supportive treatment for patients with COVID-19.",

However, the use of corticosteroids in the treatment of COVID-19 can cause host immune suppression and delay viral clearance. Recent study results have provided information to help handle this dilemma. A study at Xi'an Jiaotong-Liverpool University found that the use of corticosteroids did not influence viral clearance time, length of hospital stay or duration of symptoms in patients with mild COVID-19 [5]. This study, which included 201 patients with COVID-19, found that treatment with methylprednisolone decreased the risk of death (hazard ratio 0.38, 95% confidence interval 0.20\u20130.72) among patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). Based on these findings, the use of corticosteroids is considered beneficial in severe cases of COVID-19 (especially in partients with ARDS), but not in mild cases [6]. According to treatment experiences in China, cautious use of corticosteroids is only recommended in certain critically ill patients (e.g. those with hypoxaemia) at low-to-moderate doses (no more than 1\u20132 mg/kg/day methylprednisolone or equivalent) for a short duration (3\u20135 days), as stated in the Diagnosis and Treatment Protocol for Novel Coronavirus Pneumonia (Trial Version 7). issued by the National Health Commission of China [7].",

In February 2020, results from more than 100 Chinese patients with COVID-19 showed that chloroquine phosphate had good efficacy [8]. French doctors conducted an open-label non-randomized clinical trial, and 20 patients with COVID-19 who received hydroxychloroquine treatment showed good efficacy [9]. Both chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine are weak bases and are able to accumulate in acidic organelles (e.g. lysosomes); as such, they can increase endosomal/lysosomal pH and inhibit viral replication [10]. In addition to their antimalarial and antiviral effects, their anti-inflammatory properties have been demonstrated in the treatment of autoimmune diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis and lupus erythematosus. Chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine can inhibit major histocompatibility complex class II expression, antigen presentation and immune activation (reducing CD154 expression by T cells) via Toll-like receptor signalling and cGAS stimulation of interferon genes [11]. Thus, chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine can reduce the production of various pro-inflammatory cytokines, such as IL-1, IL-6, interferon-\u03b1 and tumour necrosis factor, which are involved in the cytokine storm [11]. These immunomodulatory effects synergize their antiviral effects in the treatment of COVID-19.",

Tocilizumab, a specific monoclonal antibody that blocks IL-6, has been recommended for use in severe or critically ill patients with extensive lesions in bilateral lungs and a confirmed elevated level of IL-6 in the Diagnosis and Treatment Protocol for Novel Coronavirus Pneumonia (Trial Version 7) issued by the National Health Commission of China [7].

Tocilizumab can bind specifically to sIL-6R and mIL-6R, and block signal transduction [15]. Tocilizumab is a good therapeutic option for cytokine release syndrome in chimeric antigen receptor T-cell immunotherapy. However, clinical experience with tocilizumab in viral disease is very limited. In a retrospective study on patients with juvenile idiopathic arthritis infected with influenza A, reduced fever and a reduced level of C-reactive protein were observed in patients who received tocilizumab compared with patients who did not receive tocilizumab [16]. Meanwhile, IL-6 inhibition by tocilizumab did not exacerbate or increase susceptibility to influenza virus infection [16]. However, there are well documented warnings on increased risk of opportunistic infections (including tuberculosis, fungal or other viral infections) caused by anti-IL-6 monoclonal antibodies during the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis [17]. High costs and safety risks may be a barrier for the wide use of tocilizumab in the treatment of COVID-19.",
