            "text": "Reversible protein tyrosine phosphorylation provides a potent and versatile mechanism for regulating various physiological processes in eukaryotic cells. Protein tyrosine kinases (PTKs), which catalyze the transfer of phosphoryl group to tyrosine residues, and protein tyrosine phosphatases (PTPs), which remove phosphate moiety from phosphotyrosine residues, work together to modulate signaling pathways. In some cases, PTPs play a dominate role in shaping the spatio-temporal dynamics of protein tyrosine phosphorylation network, making it a pivotal target for functional manipulation (Mustelin et al., 2005). Although the study of PTPs lagged behind of PTKs for historical reasons and technical difficulties, a large number of PTPs have been discovered in recent years, paralleling PTKs in sequence diversity and functional complexity (Alonso et al., 2004). Despite a minority reported to be Asp-based PTPs, all others possess at least one signature motif, [I/V]HCX5R[S/T] and share a Cys-based catalytic mechanism. Some PTPs serve as pTyr-specific enzymes, others can also dephosphorylate Ser/Thr residues, thus they are operationally defined as dual specificity phosphatase (DUSP). And the ability of removing phosphate group from phospholipid or RNA is also reported in some DUSPs (Tonks, 2013).",

Mounting a potent immune response to invading virus relies on proper phosphorylation or dephosphorylation of signaling molecules in host cells. Reciprocally, virus develops strategies to utilize or disrupt this regulatory mechanism for survival and transmission. For instance, in vitro studies using mammalian cell lines demonstrated that DUSP1, which dephosphorylates MAPKs, facilitates the infection of hepatitis C virus (HCV) and coronavirus infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) (Choi et al., 2015, Liao et al., 2011). And congenital human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) can take advantage of CDC25, a cell cycle regulator to promote viral replication (Fu et al., 2015). However, due to the lack of systematic analysis of insect PTPs and distinct antiviral mechanism that insect may take, few surveys reported the relevance of insect PTPs to antiviral immune response.",

The best-known example in insect is the expression of several bracovirus-encoded PTPs in lepidopteran hosts promoted the apoptosis of granulocytes and inhibited spreading and phagocytosis of plasmatocytes, therefore facilitating parasitoid development (Ibrahim et al., 2007, Ibrahim and Kim, 2008, Pruijssers and Strand, 2007). Interestingly, phylogenic analysis showed that those PTP genes were acquired from braconid genome and experienced complex evolutionary change (Espagne et al., 2004, Serbielle et al., 2012). Recent studies on another subset of insect virus identified a nucleopolyhedrovirus (NPV)-encoded PTP, which was presumably acquired from a lepidopteran host by horizontal gene transfer (HGT) as an essential factor to induce an enhanced locomotory activity (ELA) in host caterpillars (Kamita et al., 2005, van Houte et al., 2012). And NPV ptp deletion mutant lost its ability to manipulate its host behavior. Surprisingly, later study found BmNPV PTP functions as a virus-associated structural protein rather than as an enzyme in regard to the induction of ELA, although it still maintains the catalytic activity (Katsuma et al., 2012). Moreover, BmNPV ptp deletion mutant had reduced progeny production in silkworm larvae and showed a delay in late gene expression in cell lines. An earlier study identified a BmNPV ptp homolog encoded by Autographa californica multicapsid NPV (AcMNPV) as a dual phosphatase containing RNA 5\u2019-triphosphatase activity which is implicated in processing of viral late mRNAs (Takagi et al., 1998). In contrast to BmNPV ptp mutant, AcMNPV ptp mutant seems to have no defect in replication in insect larvae, but partially defect in occluded virus production in a cell-specific manner (Li and Miller, 1995).",

All of them have full-length cDNA or matching EST sequence which indicates that they are not pseudogenes, except three genes (NCBI Gene ID: 101747207, 101735618, 101737822) which were predicted based on genome information. These tyrosine phosphatases were classified into four subfamilies based on their phosphatase catalytic domain sequences, including classical pTyr-specific PTPs, VH1-like dual-specific PTPs (DUSPs), low molecular weight PTP (LMWP) and CDC25. The classical PTPs were then divided in two subgroups, receptor- or non-receptor type PTPs based on whether they contained transmembrane domain or not. And DUSPs were annotated as MKPs (mitogen-activated protein kinases phosphatase), PTEN (phosphatase and tensin homologue deleted on chromosome 10), PRL (phosphatase of regenerating liver), CDC14, Myotubularins and atypical DUSPs based on their human and fruitfly orthologs, respectively. There are 14 classical pTyr-specific PTPs, 20 DUSPs, 1 LMWP and 1 CDC25 (and 1 Asp-dependent tyrosine phosphatase, EYA, NCBI GI: 827538455). Compared with the 43 Cys-dependent tyrosine phosphatases identified in Drosophila melanogaster, silkworm PTP gene set is smaller. Particularly, silkworm has less members in receptor-type, Myotubularin and LMWP subfamilies. Although no clear orthology relationship can be ascribed to some silkworm atypical DUSPs, they bear considerable similarity to human and Drosophila DUSPs, especially in PTP domains. Most of silkworm tyrosine phosphatases contain the conserved signature motif sequence [I/V]HCX5R[S/T], a few display variations at the first two amino acid residues and one has Gln instead of Ser/Thr at last position which is predicted to be catalytic inactive. Whereas 79 out of the 107 human PTPs are multidomain proteins, less than a half of silkworm PTPs harbor at least one characteristic domain, which may contribute to the specific interaction with regulatory or targeting molecules.",

For that reason, we injected NPV virions into I5D3 larvae and investigated the expression profile of Bmptp-h during infection. Although the expression level of Bmptp-h changed over time during the progression, viral infection induced higher level of Bmptp-h transcription compared to the uninfected larvae at the same time point (Fig. 2\nA). The expression level of Bmptp-h in uninfected I5D7 larvae (96 h) was lower than that at I5D3 (0 h), which is in accordance with the result shown in Fig. 1A. However, in viral-infected larvae Bmptp-h transcript level was much higher at 96 h. We also found expression of Bmptp-h was potently induced by BmNPV infection in BmE cells after 48 h compared with uninfected cells and increased sharply afterwards (Fig. 2B).",

To investigate whether BmPTP-h is involved in anti-viral response, we performed dsRNA-mediated RNAi to deplete the expression of Bmptp-h in BmE cells (Fig. 4\nA). About 80% decrease in transcript level was obtained by dsBmPTP-h compared with dsRFP. 48 h after dsRNA transfection, we challenged cells with BmNPV or BmNPV-GFP, and analyzed the viral abundance by qPCR or fluorescence microscopy (Fig. 4B and C). Replication of viral DNA or the amount of GFP-positive cells was remarkably reduced when Bmptp-h was depleted. We then over-expressed Bmptp-h in BmE cells and measured the susceptibility of these cells to BmNPV or BmNPV-GFP infection (Fig. 5\n). Viral replication or GFP-positive cells significantly increased in BmPTP-h-overexpressing cells than in control. These results suggest that BmPTP-h promotes viral productive infection in cells.",

Partial depletion of Bmptp-h by dsRNA inhibited BmNPV replication, and over-expression of Bmptp-h resulted in enhanced viral replication. The results suggest that BmPTP-h might be one of the host factors that are beneficial to the replication of BmNPV. Although RNA interference is considered to be the major antiviral mechanism in insect, induction of immune signaling pathways, including Toll, IMD and JAK-STAT pathways have been observed upon viral infection (Merkling and van Rij, 2013, Sabin et al., 2010, Zambon et al., 2005). Since the signal transduction largely relies on protein phosphorylation, as a dual-specific phosphatase, BmPTP might be exploited by virus to disrupt the signaling cascades through targeting the phosphorylated molecules, resulting in immunosuppression. Furthermore, since double mutation of NPV lef-4 and NPV ptp, which are the only two viral genes encoding proteins with RNA triphosphatase activity did not alter viral RNA processing, it was proposed that host mRNA-capping enzymes might be involved in viral RNA maturation (Li and Guarino, 2008). Considering the RNA triphosphatase activity that BmPTP-h possibly possesses, it could also be hijacked by virus for efficient viral RNA synthesis.",

However, the mechanism on how virus induces the expression of those \u201cbenefit\u201d factors in host is unclear. One hypothesis is that production of viral proteins down-regulates the repressors of those factors in host, such as microRNA, resulting in increased expression of molecules favoring viral replication (Fu et al., 2015).

            "text": "It is interesting to note that besides BmNPV ptp, several other baculoviral auxiliary genes are also acquired from host insect genome via horizontal gene transfer (HGT), such as ecdysteroid UDP-glucosyltransferase (egt) and fibroblast growth factor (vfgf) (Katsuma et al., 2008). Although they are dispensable for virus production in cell line, they are reported to be involved in controlling host physiology. No direct evidence is available showing that BmPTP-h is also playing roles in regulating silkworm wandering behavior, however our study demonstrated that it promotes viral replication, facilitating rapid spread throughout the whole body of the silkworm to overwhelm the immune system. In contrast to this \u201ccollaboration\u201d strategy employed by baculovirus in the case of BmPTP-h, HGT of host genes usually allows pathogen to compete with hosts for the molecules necessary to maintain physiological integrity or dampen host response by acting as dysfunctional mimics (Liu et al., 1997, Zhao et al., 2014). Kamita et al. showed inserting Bmptp-h into the BmNPV ptp-deleted virus rescued the inability to induce ELA, but to a much lesser extent than WT virus, suggesting that the modification on BmNVP ptp sequence during evolution may have provided selective advantages and drive their fixation in the viral genome to counteract the host defense.",
