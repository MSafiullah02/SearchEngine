We tried to visualize virus-like particles (VLPs) in plasma samples from hepatitis B surface antigen-and antibody to hepatitis C virus (HCV)-negative blood donors with elevated alanine aminotransferase (ALT), and examined the association of the virus-like particles and the genomes of parenterally transmissible GBV-C/HGV. Twenty-three plasma samples, 13 with elevated ALT levels and 10 with normal ALT values, from blood donors without infections of hepatitis B virus (HBV) and HCV, were subjected to a 20%-60% sucrose density gradient centrifugation, and virus-like particles were observed by electron microscopy. GBV-C/ HGV RNAs in the plasmas were tested. Virus-like particles were found in the fractions with densities of 1.15-1.16 g/ml from 12 of 13 (92.3%) plasmas with elevated ALT levels and 1 of 10 (10%) normal controls. The ultrastructural morphology of visualized VLPs was pleomorphic in size and appearance; the majority of the VLPs were 50-to 80-nm spherical particles with a 35-to 45-nm inner core and 9-to 12-nm-long surface spikelike projections. Rodlike VLPs 50-70 nm in diameter with a length of 110-160 nm were also observed in the same samples. The incidence of detection of the circulating VLPs was signifi cantly (P < 0.001) related to elevated ALT levels, but GBV-C/HGV RNAs were detected in none of the plasmas containing the virus-like particles. Spherical VLPs are detected in HBV-and HCV-negative plasmas signifi cantly correlated with the elevation of ALT, suggesting that they are implicated in non-B, non-C hepatitis.",

[1] [2] [3] The causative role of HCV in bloodborne acute and chronic hepatitis has been well established. Although GBV-C/HGV can be transmitted parenterally, most of their infections are not associated with acute and chronic non-B, non-C hepatitis, and there is some doubt whether GBV-C/HGV replicates in the liver and causes hepatitis. 4, 5 During immunogold electron microscopy [6] [7] [8] [9] of HBV and HCV particles, we have noticed that some plasma samples from blood donors with elevated alanine aminotransferase (ALT) levels contained virus-like particles (VLPs) that did not react positively with antibodies specifi c to the HCV envelope protein. The VLPs, thus immunologically distinguished from HCV virion, were also different in morphology from the latter, and their etiological implications were not clear. In this article, we have tried to visualize VLPs in hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg)-and anti-HCV-negative plasmas and evaluated whether the circulating VLPs were detected with or without a relationship to elevated plasma ALT levels or to GBV-C/HGV RNAs.",

A suspension of the pellet in TEN was centrifuged again at 150 000 g for 2.5 h at 4\u00b0C.

After measurement of the sucrose concentration of every fraction, each sucrose fraction was diluted in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS, pH 7.4) and then centrifuged at 150 000 g for 2.5 h at 4\u00b0C.

The incidence of detection of the virus-like particles was signifi cantly (P < 0.001) related to the elevation of plasma ALT levels (see Table 1 ). Most the visualized VLPs were spherical particles 50-80 nm in diameter with 9-to 12-nm-long surface spikelike projections (Fig. 1a,b) . Some VLPs have a large diameter, more than 100 nm (Fig. 1a) . In some specimens were detected more than a moderate number of VLPs, and rodlike VLPs 50-60 nm in diameter with a length of 110-160 nm were also detected that had surface projections similar to those of the 50-to 80-nm spherical particles (Fig. 2) . The diameter of the rodlike VLPs was 50-70 nm and their length was 110-160 nm. In addition, a 35-to 45-nm corelike structure containing the electron-dense material within a spherical VLP (Fig. 3a,b) and two inner cores of a rodlike VLP (Fig. 3c) were visualized by positive staining with uranyl acetate. These VLPs were found to be constantly banded in a sucrose density gradient at around 1.15-1.16 g/ml (range, 1.12-1.18 g/ml). GBV-C/HGV RNAs were not detected in any of the plasma samples (see Table 1 ).",

The majority were 50-to 80-nm spherical particles with 9-to 12-nm-long surface projections (see Fig. 1 ), and were, if anything, morphologically resembling togaviruses or coronaviruses. Positive staining revealed that the electron-dense material combined with uranium existed in a 35-to 45-nm internal core structure of the spherical virus-like particle, and indicated that the spherical particles had the nucleic acid therein (see Fig.  3 ). In addition, rodlike VLPs (Fig. 2) were observed concomitantly in the specimens containing many spherical VLPs, and the surface spikelike projections of rodlike forms looked similar to those of the spherical particles. Interestingly, two internal cores (Fig. 3c) were detected in a rodlike form, suggesting that this form could be a diploid particle of the virus. Thus, we might consider that both the spherical and the rodlike virus-like particles belong to the same virus species.",

Circulating VLPs, as presented here, were highly prevalent (92.3%) in ALT-elevated plasma samples, and were relatively easy to visualize by conventional electron microscopy, whereas in only one of ten normal controls were a few spherical VLPs barely detectable despite careful observation. Thus, although the presence of the virus-like particles in the blood was signifi cantly (P < 0.001) associated with the elevation of plasma ALT levels, indicating that these viruslike particles do cause liver cell necrosis, the nucleic acids of parenterally transmissible known hepatitis viruses were not detected in any tested plasma samples.",
