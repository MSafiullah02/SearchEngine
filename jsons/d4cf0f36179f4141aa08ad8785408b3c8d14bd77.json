[33] , who suggest converting a QAC log to an abstracted format (an abstract QAC log) that records only the length of each partial query and the lengths of words used, minimizing privacy concerns but removing the possibility of performing evaluations on actual strings. Synthetic QAC log generation seeks to produce a list of plausible synthetic partial query sequences by mapping the word lengths from the abstract QAC log to strings from a publicly available dataset. An example of the proposed process is shown in Fig. 1 . On the left are partial queries typed by a user. The abstracting process converts these to the digit sequences shown in the middle column, describing the strings but not their characters; and then the corresponding synthesized strings are shown at the right. Note that it is neither necessary nor sufficient for the synthetic log to contain semantically valid phrases. Comparison 1 . A sample QAC log entry, the corresponding abstract QAC log entry, and a synthetic QAC log entry generated from the string \"john of gaunt\".",

            "text": "A QAC system retrieves a candidate set matching the partial query P, drawing from a target string collection, with strings in the target collection having an associated score. Query Auto Completion systems typically match P against past queries from a log; or, in the absence of logs, they can also be synthesized [14, 40] . Methods of ranking the candidates include static popularity [9] , search context [9, 29] , forecast popularity [15] , personalized ranking parameters [15, 29, 42] , and diversity [16] . It is also possible to choose an initial candidate set based on popularity and then apply a second ranking criteria to obtain the final strings [15, 16] . QAC implementation strategies vary based on how the partial query P is matched against the target strings [32] . A common approach is to use a trie [3, 4, 25, 27] to retrieve candidates that have P as a prefix; or inverted index-based approaches [10, 11, 23] that offer completions independent of the ordering of the words in the partial query. The functionality of a QAC system can be extended beyond character level matches by including contextual cues [11] or synonyms [12, 28] . Error-tolerant QAC approaches [17, 28, 36, 47] allow up to a fixed number of character mismatches to account for possible typing errors. User interactions are a key factor in implementation and evaluation of QAC systems [26, 33, 38] and have been captured using a wide range of models [31] [32] [33] 37, 38, 43, 44] . In particular, users are not limited to entering single characters, and can alter the partial query by selecting a completion or deleting characters already entered. Until now, the test collections used to evaluate traditional search systems have been anonymized commercial logs [1, 19, 34, 48] or synthesized logs [5, 30, 45, 49] . QAC system evaluations have typically been performed over large publicly available string collections [10, 14, 23] , with strings taken sequentially from left-to-right to generate partial query sequences [10] . However this approach does not account for the full range of possible interactions [32, 33] . In this work, we explore an approach to generation of synthetic partial query sequences that addresses this gap. ",

The set of target candidates is maintained in lexicographically sorted order, so that the exact-match signatures for a given seedsig can be found via two binary searches, establishing a range [r beg , r end ). A similar process can be used to find the prefix-match range, which is a larger contiguous block in the lexicographically sorted array of target candidates. If a target signature S t matches with seedsig using MbD, any targsig having S t as a prefix will also have an MbD match with seedsig. For example, under MbD the seedsig 3, 5 matches 3, 2, 5 . Then signatures 3, 2, 5, 4 and 3, 2, 5, 9, 16 will also be a match because they have 3, 2, 5 as a prefix. Using this property, once a matching signature S t for MbD is found, we can add the prefix match range for S t to the MbD range for the current seedsig.

To include deletions, we assume that something different was initially typed (the replacement word) and was converted to the word from the target string after the deletions. In particular, suppose that the current conversation contains the deletion of a word w k starting from the ith interaction and ending with the jth interaction. Then, for every interaction preceding the jth interaction, w k is substituted by a replacement word constructed via a set of deletion heuristics. If character sequences are deleted and re-entered several times during the conversation, several replacement words will be required. The last replacement word should be close to the original word, and the penultimate replacement prior to it should similarly be a modification of the last replacement word. Table 1 gives an example of the partial query sequence generated by rewriting target strings when the conversation contains multiple deletions. Users delete characters either due to typing errors [6, 20] made within that word, or to switch to an entirely different word. Among various typing errors that can occur in any character level entry systems [22] , the following error categories that are predominantly discussed in past research [6, 20, 21, 46] are included in the generation process.",

Deletion errors are more frequent at character repetitions, and occur more commonly at the beginning of a word [6] . To simulate a deletion error, if there is a deletion sequence from ith interaction to the jth interaction in which more than two characters of w k are removed, then w k from the j + 1th interaction (after the deletions) is examined to see if the last two characters in w k are repeating. The error is then simulated by deleting one of the repeating characters of w k in the interactions prior to j + 1. Insertion. These arise when an extra letter is initially typed, for example, the correction \"sherriff\" \u2192 \"sheriff\". Our experimental results show that only a low fraction of insertion errors are observed in a QAC log and for that reason, they are not included in the synthetic QAC log generation process. Substitution. These arise when the user enters one of the neighboring keys instead of the intended key, for example, the correction \"disturv\" \u2192 \"disturb\". Single character deletions are assumed to be substitution errors. The substituted character is found via a probability distribution for mistyped keys around the current key. Transposition. This is when the user swaps two characters in a word either not knowing the correct spelling or because of mis-ordered keystrokes, for example, the correction \"wierd\" \u2192 \"weird\". Deletions of length two are considered to be transposition errors and the last two characters of the word are swapped to get the replacement word.",

Sometimes users replace certain parts of a well-formed partial query, for instance to get a different set of completions.

To allow for such cases, the deleted part of the word is replaced with another string starting with the word's remaining prefix, but differing in the next character. For example, consider the word \"hawk\" in Table 1 . A deletion chain removed all of the characters except the \"h\"; and hence (working backwards), \"hawk\" was replaced by an alternate word that starts with \"h\" but not \"ha\", such as \"hole\".",

Heap's law gives an estimate of the number of unique terms V in a collection as a function of the number of terms N . The relationship is given by V = kN \u03b2 and the typical values of the parameters are 30 \u2264 k \u2264 100, with \u03b2 \u2248 0.50 for English text [39] and \u03b2 \u2248 0.60 for web documents [7] .

The difference in growth rate can be explained by the nature of the logs. The growth rate of V is expected to be higher in a collection containing numbers and spelling errors [39] . probability of higher frequency partial query strings. The goodness of power-law fit against exponential and log-normal fits is compared using likelihood ratio R [2, 18] along with the significance level p, as reported in Table 3 . Except for the frequency distribution of FinalP from Bing-QAC-2018, which is better explained with a log-normal distribution (R = \u22122.42, 0.04), the other three distributions suit a power-law distribution, perhaps as a result of the sampling process followed.

Similarities in typing patterns between the synthetic QAC log and the original QAC log are verified by analyzing the typing errors present in both logs. Typing errors are identified by extracting and comparing a set of pre-correction and post-correction strings from the conversations, extending the method proposed by Baba and Suzuki [6] . When the kth word w k in P gets deleted from the ith interaction, w k from the i\u22121th interaction is taken as the pre-correction string. To find the post-correction string, the edit distance between the pre-correction string and the words w k from the interactions after the end of current deletion sequence are calculated until |w k | from interaction j is less than that from interaction j + 1. From this list, the word having minimum edit distance with the pre-correction string is taken as the post correction string. Table 5 gives an example for how pre-correction and post-correction strings are calculated from a deletion sequence. The edit distance between two strings is calculated as a Damerau-Levenshtein distance, so transposition of two characters is given a cost of 1. The pre-correction and post-correction pairs are then compared to classify the possible typing errors as one of the types discussed above. The results obtained by analyzing the typing errors from Bing-QAC-2018 and the synthetic QAC log are in Fig. 5 . The fraction of transposition errors was found to be higher in Wiki-Synth compared to Bing-QAC-2018 while the latter contains more deletion errors than Wiki-Synth. As a result of the method of simulating substitution errors, they tend to occur more towards the end of words in Wiki-Synth. The remainder of the error categories are distributed across similar word positions in both the logs, suggesting similarities in typing patterns.",

            "text": "We have explored a method for generating a synthetic QAC log from an abstract QAC log, by mapping the word lengths of the abstract QAC log to those of a publicly available string collection, and applying a range of corrective techniques. Synthetic QAC formation can also be posed as a language generation problem relying on various models of QAC systems [31, 33] . We have demonstrated that the synthetic log generated from a pre-existing string collection encompasses many of the properties found in the original QAC log from which the abstract QAC log was derived. In particular, an analysis of typing errors found in actual QAC logs is reported, along with a description of how they were introduced into the synthetic log. As a result, there is a close correspondence between the real QAC log and the synthetic QAC log across a range of properties, each of which might influence the computational cost of providing the completion strings. That is, experiments using the synthetic QAC log can be expected to provide close approximations to behaviors that would be observed on a real QAC log. A particular example is efficiency, which we plan to examine in future work, comparing the performance of a range of QAC implementations using both synthetic and real QAC logs.",
