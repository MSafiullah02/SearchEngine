Annual economic losses due to death, decreased feed efficiency, and treatment costs associated with BRDC are estimated at US$800 to $900 million (Chirase et al., 2001) and BRDC accounts for approximately 75% of feedlot morbidity and from 50 to 80% of mortality (Edwards, 1996; Chirase et al., 2001). Typically, BRDC involves a combination of a viral and bacterial coinfection. Adding to the complexity, not all animals exposed to these pathogens exhibit clinical signs. The disease process can develop sepsis; however, physiological traits for increased susceptibility or increased severity of BRDC remain unclear.",

            "text": "Recently, in humans and mice, extracellular histones have been shown to be involved in death associated with a variety of pathologies including acute sepsis and injury (Xu et al., 2009, 2011). Moreover, histones are lethal when injected into mice (Xu et al., 2011), and serum appears to protect against histone cytotoxicity (Wang et al., 1999). Several serum proteins have demonstrated the ability to bind to histones, and work by Abrams et al. (2013) demonstrated that C-reactive protein (CRP) binds to and neutralizes histone toxicity. Therefore, we hypothesize that histone cytotoxicity contributes to the severity of BRDC and that cattle exhibit varying degrees of protective capacity against the cytotoxic effects of histones. The objectives of the current study were to establish an in vitro assay to test protective capacity of serum collected from feedlot cattle against cytotoxic effects of histones and to determine if protective capacity in cattle varies in relation to the degree of severity of naturally acquired BRDC.",

Upon arrival, calves were visually inspected for abnormalities or illness and subsequently uniquely identified and placed in pens with ad libitum access to hay and water. Calves were allowed to rest 24 to 48 h before initial processing. Initial processing included vaccination against infectious bovine rhinotracheitis virus, bovine viral diarrhea virus types 1 and 2, parainfluenza 3 virus, and bovine respiratory syncytial virus (BRD Shield; Novartis, Greensboro, NC); Clostridium chauvoei, Clostridium septicum, Clostridium novyi, Clostridium sordellii, and Clostridium perfringens Types C and D (Caliber 7; Boehringer-Ingelheim, St. Joseph, MO); and treatment for the control of internal and external parasites (Ivomec Plus; Merial, Duluth, GA).

(2008). The subjective criteria used for pulling calves consisted of depression, abnormal appetite, and respiratory signs. The evaluators assigned a calf a severity score from 0 to 4 based on the clinical signs and the severity of those signs. A score of 0 was assigned for a clinically normal appearing calf. A score of 1 was assigned for mild clinical signs, 2 for moderate clinical signs, 3 for severe clinical signs, and 4 for a moribund animal. The objective criteria used to determine if antimicrobial treatment was necessary was rectal temperature. All calves assigned a severity score of 1 to 4 were taken to the processing chute for rectal temperature measurement (GL M-500 thermometer; GLA Agricultural Electronics, San Luis Obispo, CA). Any animal that was pulled with a severity score of 1 or 2 and had a rectal temperature of 40\u00b0C or greater received an antimicrobial treatment according to label instructions. Any animal with severe clinical signs (severity score = 3 or 4) received an antimicrobial according to label instructions regardless of rectal temperature. For the first antimicrobial treatment, gamithromycin 150 mg/mL (Zactran; Merial) was administered at 1 mL/24.9 kg of BW. After 240 h for calves with a severity score of 1 or 2 and 96 h for calves with a severity score of 3 or 4, florfenicol 300 mg/mL (Nuflor; Intervet/Schering-Plough, Desoto, KS) was administered at the rate of 1 mL/7.56 kg of BW. After 96 h after the florfenicol treatment, calves displaying severity scores of 1 or greater were administered ceftiofur crystalline free acid 200 mg/mL (Excede; Pfizer, New York, NY) at 1 mL/30.2 kg of BW. A 168 h moratorium was observed before administering a fourth antimicrobial treatment (ceftiofur; same dose as described above) as necessary. Postmortem necropsy was also performed on 3 random calves that died on different days within 2 wk after arrival. This included nasal passage swabs and lung tissue sampling. Samples were evaluated by Oklahoma Animal Disease Diagnostic Lab Center for Veterinary Health Sciences at Oklahoma State University (Stillwater, OK).",

Initial doses were selected based on previous work demonstrating histone cytotoxicity and serum histone levels in disease (Xu et al., 2009; Abrams et al., 2013). The MDBK cells were treated with a concentration of 0 (control), 25, 50, 100, and 200 \u03bcg/mL of total calf thymus histones (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Dallas, TX) in serum-free media. Cytotoxicity was determined via visual appraisal and resazurin assay as an indicator of cell health (alamarBlue; Life Technologies). The 50 \u03bcg/mL of histones resulted in substantial cell death and was selected for subsequent studies (see results). The MDBK cells were then treated with 50 \u03bcg/mL of calf thymus histones and serum-free media supplemented with serum from calves not displaying symptoms of BRDC. Serum concentrations of 0, 1, 3, and 5% were tested with serum from 2 separate control animals (cattle with known background that never displayed clinical symptoms of injury or illness and exhibited protective capacity in preliminary experiments). Cell viability was estimated using alamarBlue (Life Technologies) according to manufacturer's recommendations and fluorescence was detected using a Molecular Devices M3 (Molecular Devices, Sunnyvale, CA) plate reader. Cells were incubated with treatment for 18 h and exposed to resazurin for 6 h before reading. Finally, a serum concentration \u00d7 histone dose response was evaluated using 0.5 and 1% serum and 50 and 100 \u03bcg/mL total histones. A serum concentration of 1% and histone concentration of 50 \u03bcg/mL was used for subsequent testing. This level of histones was chosen because higher concentrations could have cytotoxic effects despite serum. Likewise, 1% serum was used because the lowest concentration that conferred protection would also be more susceptible to histone cytotoxicity if animal variation in protective capacity existed.",

Without serum, 50 \u03bcg/mL histones caused a reduction in cell viability, but addition of the nominal 1% serum restored viability to levels near the histone-free control (Fig. 1). To further refine the serum protective capacity assay, a serum by dose-response experiment was conducted. Healthy calf serum concentrations of 0, 0.5, and 1% were tested against 0, 25, 50, and 100 \u03bcg/mL of histones (Fig. 1). The 0% serum concentration showed a response similar to previous optimization steps where 50 and 100 \u03bcg/mL histones were extremely toxic to cells. However, no difference was observed between 50 and 100 \u03bcg/mL histones. Although 0.5% serum did decrease histone cytotoxicity relative to nonserum samples, this percent was not able to fully protect against histone cytotoxicity. However, 1% serum restored fluorescent values in 50 and 100 \u03bcg/mL of histones to near control (histone-free serum) levels.

Despite much research effort, BRDC cases have been relatively constant over the past 30 yr (reviewed by Gifford et al., 2012) and contribute to decreased economic returns due to treatment costs, decreased carcass quality, depressed growth, and death loss. Bovine respiratory disease complex is a multifaceted disease and the etiological agents are typically viral and bacterial or mycoplasmal. The most common viral agents observed are bovine herpesvirus 1, bovine parainfluenza virus 3, bovine viral diarrhea virus 1 and 2, bovine coronavirus, and bovine adenovirus; typical bacterial agents are Mannheimia haemolytica, Pasteurella multocida, and Histophilus somni (reviewed by Griffin et al., 2010). Mycoplasma species can also be pathogens in BRDC outbreaks (reviewed by Griffin et al., 2010). Although pathogens can vary in cases of BRDC, a hallmark of the disease is respiratory tract infections resulting in pneumonia and bronchiolar lesions (Fulton et al., 2009). In the current study, postmortem necropsy of 3 calves identified several pathogens including Mannheimia haemolytica, Mycoplasma bovis, bovine viral diarrhea virus, Bovine coronavirus, and Pasteurella multocida and calves exhibited greater than 85% lung damage. Additionally, the severity of the disease varied both in length (calves requiring only 1 antimicrobial treatment up to 4 treatments) of clinical signs and varied times to death (calves that died after 1 treatment, 2 treatments, 3 treatments, or 4 treatments). The varied severity of disease likely stems from variation of individual resistance (Snowder et al., 2006) and the multiple pathogens involved (Fulton et al., 2009; Kirchhoff et al., 2014). However, for all groups in the current study, the average time to first treatment was 6 \u00b1 1.5 d, indicating that all animals suffered similar exposure on arrival. Ultimately, the resulting experimental group had calves that exhibited varied severity of BRDC ranging from acute to chronic.",

            "text": "Pathologies that induce necrosis (either acute or chronic) or, in some cases, apoptosis cause release of histones into the extracellular spaces (Xu et al., 2009). Histone proteins (H1, H2A, H2B, H3, H4, and H5) help maintain the highly organized structure of DNA in chromatin format within the nucleus of eukaryotic cells. A nucleosome consists of 1 H3/H4 tetramer and 2 H2A/H2B dimers; this histone octomer coils 147 bp of DNA. Together with the linker histones, H1 and H5, nucleosomes form higher order chromatin structures (Felsenfeld and Groudine, 2003). In human patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome and in mice with experimentally induced acute lung injury, extracellular histones are detected in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (Ward and Grailer, 2014). Likewise, Wen et al. (2013) demonstrated increased circulating histones in a mouse model for acute liver failure and sourced the histones to apoptotic hepatocytes and infiltrating neutrophils. Additionally, there are numerous other diseases and injuries that can cause a rise in circulating histone levels of humans, mice, and baboons (reviewed by Allam et al., 2014), but studies in cattle experiencing BRDC are lacking. Typically, lung damage occurs during episodes of BRDC and other species that suffer acute respiratory damage from disease or injury exhibit a rise in extracellular histones; it is reasonable to speculate that histones are released during BRDC as well. In the current experiment, serum samples were harvested and stored according to normal laboratory procedures. However, nucleosomes in serum are degraded relatively quickly and require stabilization with EDTA to reliably quantify nucleosomes/histones after freezing samples (Holdenrieder et al., 2001). Moreover, samples must be harvested and processed in a similar manner, preferably in under 2 h (Holdenrieder et al., 2001). The samples collected for these data were allowed to clot overnight at 4\u00b0C and were not stabilized with EDTA; therefore, it seemed unlikely that circulating histones could be accurately quantified in these samples. If there were increased serum histones in some samples at arrival, it would seem likely those serum samples would be cytotoxic to MDBK cells. There were no detectable differences in cytotoxicity of serum samples from any of the groups at initial processing, indicating that histones or other factors in the samples were not contributing to the observed cytotoxicity.",

(2009), in which an inflammatory challenge led to a rise in extracellular histones and resulted in organ failure and ultimately death during sepsis. Exogenous histones administered intravenously to mice also elicit a hyperinflammatory response leading to cell damage and animal death (Xu et al., 2009). Intratracheal administration of histones greatly induces inflammation leading to epithelial damage, lung consolidation, and death in some cases (Ward and Grailer, 2014). In the absence of serum, we also observed complete cell death in MDBK cells treated with histones. However, histones not only directly induce cell death but can also hyperstimulate the proinflammatory response during a variety of conditions including acute liver failure (Wen et al., 2013). During systemic inflammatory responses from disease or injury, it appears that histones bind toll-like receptors (TLR). Using a subfatal dose of histones administered to mice, Xu et al. (2011) found evidence of TLR2 and TLR4 signaling. Furthermore, when injected with exogenous histones, TLR4 knockout mice did not show massive proinflammatory cytokine production. This evidence, in addition to an in vitro model showing direct activation of TLR by exogenous histone treatment, strongly implicates the importance of TLR in histone-induced cytokine production and direct cell or organ damage (Xu et al., 2011).",

Results indicated that serum samples from calves collected at initial processing had varied protective capacities against histone cytotoxicity, and calves that ultimately required 3 or more treatments for BRDC were the least protective. Interestingly, the decreased capacity was observed from serum samples collected at initial processing and before clinical symptoms of BRDC. Certainly, larger studies are necessary, but these data could suggest that histone toxicity protective capacity might be of use to predict which calves will exhibit longer durations of clinical disease and require multiple treatments. Because chronically infected calves experience the most detriment to carcass traits (Holland et al., 2010), perhaps these animals could be managed differently if identified early to minimize economic losses. Ideally, the mechanism or mechanisms for histone protective capacity will be found, leading to new treatments or genetic screening of susceptible individuals.",

Although not significant, a trend could be emerging from the current data in which animals that recover from BRDC display increasing protective capacity whereas those that die show decreased protective capacity over time. Results from the current study do not statistically support differences in protective capacity based on mortality, but the concept should be revisited with larger sample sizes or assays that directly measure the protective mechanism or mechanisms against histone cytotoxicity. Additionally, serum histone levels could be quantified in properly handled serum samples. Certainly, other components of BRDC are likely contributors to death and histone cytotoxicity is not the sole contributor to clinical BRDC symptoms. It is also possible that calves that die have a massive rise in extracellular histones overriding any protective capacity; therefore, histone levels as well as protective capacity can be contributors to death in BRDC. Larger studies with appropriately processed serum are necessary to describe histone release during BRDC.",
