There is first evidence that viral infections in term and preterm neonates during birth hospitalization have a significant impact on short-and long-term morbidity.

This is of particular importance since modern, family-centered neonatal care that includes kangaroo care and units that are always open to parents and siblings bears an increased risk of virus transmission. In our study, viral infections always presented with respiratory symptoms, albeit their clinical characteristics were highly heterogeneous. When compared with bacterial infections, nosocomial viral infections occurred rather late during birth hospitalization. It is unclear whether this is due to physiological factors, such as decreasing maternal passive immunity or simply due to long-term hospitalization. Affected infants were either extremely premature infants or term infants with a pulmonary or thoracic disease that presented with respiratory distress. These might be the patients at high risk in whom viral testing should definitely be considered in cases of suspected late-onset sepsis.",

A comparable incidence of 6% of viral respiratory infections in cases of sepsis evaluation in the NICU was observed. Likewise, rhinovirus, which is a member of the picornavirus family, was the dominating pathogen. Bennett et al performed a surveillance study of viral respiratory infections in two NICUs. All infants of a gestational age < 33 weeks were tested twice a week using multiplex RT-PCR ELISA. The authors found that 52% of all tested infants had a positive virus screen at least once during their birth hospitalization. In contrast to our study, they identified infants with a positive virus screen who had no or only minimal clinical symptoms. 17 Another study by Gonzalez-Carrasco et al used a mixed design of weekly surveillance and additional tests in the event of respiratory symptoms. 19 In that study, 9.3% of all samples were positive.

It remains unclear how these results should be applied to preterm infants during birth hospitalization.",

To allow for discrimination of harmless colonization and true infection, a future study would ideally consist of three cohorts: (1) asymptomatic virus negative, (2) asymptomatic virus positive, and (3) symptomatic virus positive. The additional implementation of host-based RT-PCR gene expression assays into clinical practice might offer a significantly improved tool to diagnose viral infections. 25 Furthermore, the range of viruses, which can be screened for, should be expanded. Quite recently, a study with a comparable design investigated human parechovirus in blood samples of all cases of suspected late-onset sepsis in the NICU and found a high infection rate of 13%. 26 Further research should also focus on modes of virus transmission, patients at risk, and the impact of preventive measures and long-term outcomes of viral infections during birth hospitalization.",
