Within each of the two influenza A subtypes (H3N2 and H1N1) co-circulating prior to 2009, continual evolution selecting for antigenic novelty was seen [8]. The dynamics of intra-subtype evolution is characterized by relatively stable strains periodically replaced by antigenically distinct types in punctuated evolution events [8\u201310]. In addition, there is evidence of immune-mediated competition between subtypes [10]. These mechanisms combine to generate complex seasonal behaviour, featuring a range of annual attack rates (AARs) and epidemic durations and alternating sequences of dominant annual subtypes and strains [11]. Detailed and computationally intensive simulations are required to fully integrate the epidemiological and genetic aspects of long-term behaviour [10,12]. However, strain-specific data with sufficient temporal resolution to fit such a model are not available. We therefore adopt a simplified description here and model two weakly interacting subtypes, with evolution within each subtype being represented by a gradual loss of immunity of the previously exposed host population, a so-called SIRS (susceptible\u2013infected\u2013recovered\u2013susceptible) model. While use of SIRS models to represent intra-subtype evolution is not uncommon [13\u201315], previous models of influenza time series have not accounted for dynamics generated by multiple interacting subtypes.",

Use of summary statistics (rather than attempting to directly fit models to time-series data) adds robustness to variations in reporting (much ILI is not even caused by influenza) and short-term fluctuation in the incidence data. Our aim is not to precisely match the incidence time series, but to find broad regions of parameter space which are consistent with the characteristics of seasonal flu epidemics and hence identify which epidemiological mechanisms are essential and acceptable ranges for their parameters. For this purpose, an elaborate model and detailed data are not necessary.",

            "text": "We use the following features of the time series to characterize seasonal influenza incidence in temperate countries of the Northern Hemisphere:\n\u2014 Epidemic duration. The vast majority of seasonal influenza outbreaks are observed between the extremes of mid-November and the end of April [11]. Since a background rate of ILI incidence is present throughout the year, duration is difficult to define precisely. The range of values quoted for the duration of an annual epidemic (described with the acronym ADE in this paper) is typically between three and 16 weeks [1,16].\u2014 Attack rate. The proportion of the population infected in a year, which we term the AAR, is very difficult to determine, as a significant proportion of infections are asymptomatic and only a proportion of symptomatic cases seek healthcare. Hence sentinel data on ILI can only give relative information, such as the fractional variation in incidence over time. In addition, measures such as ILI are non-specific for influenza and can be caused by a variety of respiratory pathogens. That said, ILI data from France and the UK indicate a standard deviation for AAR across successive years of approximately 40 per cent of the mean attack rate [17,18]. Results from serological and virus isolation data from closely monitored populations indicate an AAR range of approximately 10\u201320% for seasonal influenza, rising to 30 per cent or more for influenza pandemics [1,17]. Information on consultation rates for known cases also suggests a mean AAR of around 15 per cent [13,18,19].\u2014 Periodic behaviour. Seasonal influenza is characterized by annual outbreaks in temperate countries in the sense that there is almost invariably a marked seasonal increase in case rate during the winter months. However, it cannot be said to be periodic in the sense that successive outbreaks are comparable in magnitude and form with each other. In this sense, seasonal influenza has no clear periodicity (annual, biennial and triennial) and contrasts with the behaviour of diseases such as measles, which has a pronounced biennial structure in the pre-immunization period [5]. The metrics that we use to compare model and time-series behaviour are able to pick up this characteristic aperiodicity.\u2014 Strain variation. Virus isolation studies show that individual seasonal epidemics are usually dominated by a single type and/or subtype, although others may be present at low levels [13]. Successive seasons are usually dominated by different types and subtypes, although often the same strain is present for several seasons (figure 1).\n",

The sinusoidal form is a good match for variation in infectiousness as a function of absolute humidity in temperate regions [14], but we also examine the effect of using school terms as a seasonal driver using step-function forcing (see the electronic supplementary material). In determining feasible ranges for these parameters, we reviewed the range of estimates that exist for R0. The majority of these are calculated for the major global epidemics (1918, 1957, 1968), since the antigenic novelty of pandemic viruses means an assumption of a serologically naive population can be made, making analysis simpler. For seasonal influenza, knowledge of population susceptibility is necessary to estimate R0 (as opposed to the effective reproduction number, R). Estimated values for the 1918 pandemic range from 1.3 to 2.8 [20]. Similar values are found for the 1957 and 1968 epidemics [21]. These values also correspond well with those from studies of seasonal influenza, giving winter R0 of 1.7 and school holiday R0 of 1.4 [16].",

The region of best fits is located in a narrow diagonal band spanning 1.6 < Rp < 2.5 and 3 < D < 8 (figure 3d). Along this band, increasing reproduction number is compensated for by a longer period of effective immunity that decreases the susceptible proportion of the population, giving a constant mean attack rate. The acceptable region is bounded in part by the duration of the model epidemics. The lowest and highest values of Rp generate epidemics that are too broad and too narrow, compared with the target distribution. The fit of the model is strongly constrained by the dynamics of the model, which exhibits a wide range of periodic behaviour across quite small changes in parameter values (figure 3a). While AAR changes smoothly with the parameters, abrupt changes in periodicity lead to qualitative changes in the distributions of AAR and epidemic duration and hence the KL distance. Best-fit behaviour is associated with long-period behaviour of the model (4+ years). Here, the model generates a range of AARs clustered around the mean and matching the target distribution. The qualitatively different forms of behaviour are well characterized by the total KL distance measure (figure 4). KL distances less than 200 correspond to realistic behaviour with appropriate mean attack rate distributions (figure 4a). KL distance between 200 and 300 match either with realistic behaviour interspersed with large-scale epidemic episodes or with realistic behaviour but with a mean attack rate displaced from the target value (figure 4b). Larger values represent dynamics and mean attack rates greatly different from the observed time series (figure 4c).\n\n",

The choice of Rp and D lies in the well-fitting band in figure 3d. It is clear that a wide range of values for these parameters allow the model to fit the behaviour of the time series quite well. The model's qualitative behaviour (in terms of its periodicity) is more stable with respect to these mechanisms and variation within the closest fit region mainly affects the mean attack rate. There is a broadly inverse relationship between the well-fitting values of the parameters \u03b8 and \u03d5. Increasing the assortativity of mixing concentrates infections more strongly in age groups, decreasing the available susceptibles and hence the attack rate. Increasing cross-immunity has an equivalent effect by increasing the effective loss of susceptibles caused by any single infection event and hence reducing the attack rate. As can be seen from figure 7a, values of the cross-immunity parameter \u03d5 outside the range 0.3\u20130.6 drive the model into unfavourable periodicities, giving very poor fits. This suggests that a model with two strains interacting via cross-immunity is necessary to reproduce the dynamics seen in influenza time series and that it is insufficient to have two independent strains (\u03d5 = 0) or two antigenically identical strains (i.e. \u03d5 = 1\u2212equivalent to a single strain model). Similarly, extreme values of \u03b8 also lead to poorly fitting model behaviour, suggesting that a uniformly mixing population (\u03b8 = 0) would also not generate matching behaviour.\n",

We find that an age-structured population and multiple strains with cross-immunity are necessary to recreate the distributions of AAR and epidemic duration seen in time-series data. Nonlinear models of this type with temporal forcing are well known for having complex bifurcation structures affecting their periodic behaviour. On the timescale of a single disease season or single epidemic, these would have little effect on parameter estimation. Over many seasons, however, the periodicity of the underlying model is crucially important. We would argue that capturing the long-term trends in behaviour is at least as important as the detail of individual seasonal outbreaks and our fitting approach focuses on these aspects.",

This makes finding a unique set of parameters giving an overall minimum distance impossible. Although mean attack rate and duration generally vary smoothly, the period of the model solution changes discontinuously (inevitably, as it only takes values that are multiples of the annual forcing period). Solutions with longer periods generate a wider range of AAR and epidemic durations over an extended period of time and are therefore capable of fitting the target data distributions better. As a result, the best fits are strongly associated with longer periods in model solutions and the quality of fit of the model can change abruptly over small changes in parameter values.",

The narrowness of the well-fitting parameter region is a result of the sudden changes of behaviour generated by changes in these parameters. Figure 5 also illustrates this feature. The closest fitting region is found for \u03b4 between 0.15 and 0.3, but patches of well-fitting solutions are scattered a range of values of Rp and \u03b4 owing to the sensitivity to the system to temporal forcing. We note that a change in the mode of forcing from sinusoidal to school-term leads to generally broader ranges of acceptable parameter values (see the electronic supplementary material), perhaps indicating that the presence of this mechanism is a strong contributor to the variable annual behaviour observed in the ILI dataset.",

As discussed in \u00a73, this strongly suggests that an age-structured population and, in particular, a pathogen population with more than one strain and cross-immunity, are necessary to reproduce the patterns of behaviour found in the ILI time series.

We note that both the form of this term and the non-exponentially distributed duration of immunity in that study affect epidemic attack rates as a function of transmissibility and the periodicity of epidemics, and hence may play an equivalent role to age structure and the incorporation of two subtypes in our model in allowing a good fit to the data.",

[14] use a similar SIRS model to investigate the possibility that seasonal changes in absolute humidity can generate recorded patterns in pneumonia and influenza mortality data. The model was stochastic, has no age structure, and effectively uses only one strain. Best-fit parameter values are similar to those found in this work, although the relative amplitude of variation in R0 is in the range 0.4\u20130.5, significantly higher than our findings. Best-fit parameter sets showed considerable lack of correlation with each other, which the authors attribute to the stochastic nature of their model. Our work suggests that this scatter may be the result of the complex bifurcational structure of such models. As already discussed, our results indicate that a two strain model without cross-immunity or age structure is unlikely to fit patterns of seasonal influenza from a temperate region. However, there are several significant differences between the two systems. Shaman et al. employ a significantly higher background force of infection than ours (approx. 7.3 \u00d7 10\u22124 yr\u20131), which would place our model in a strongly annual or biennial regime.
