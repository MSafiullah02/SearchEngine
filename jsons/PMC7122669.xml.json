Maassab in 1959 [3] describes the preparation of Chicken Kidney monolayer cultures from 4- to 5-day-old chicks, the cultures being used for studies with some human viruses and Churchill [4] reports the use of chicken kidney tissue cultures derived from 3 to 8 week old chickens in the study of avian viruses including Infectious Bronchitis Virus (IBV). The technique for the production of kidney cell monolayer cultures from young birds, as described here, is adapted from those published by Dulbecco and Vogt [1], and Youngner [2] for monkey kidney cells.",

Following adaptation in embryonated eggs, the Beaudette strain of IBV produced characteristic cytopathic effects (CPE) on first passage in CK cells, whilst the Massachusetts strain produced CPE in the second CK passage [4]. CPE consists of syncytia formation which occurs at 6 h post inoculation with the Beaudette strain [7]. The syncytia may contain as many as 20\u201340 or more nuclei and they quickly round up and detach from the culture surface. Growth curves of IBV in CK cells show a lag phase of 2\u20134 h and maximum virus yield in 18\u201320 h [5].",

Move the intestines, which should have remained attached to this retracted section, to reveal the kidneys.Remove the kidneys using a small pair of scissors and forceps and place in a 250 ml beaker of PBSa.Repeat steps 4\u20138 for every bird.When all the kidneys required have been removed from the birds, agitate them in the beaker and discard the PBSa. Repeat this process until the wash PBSa looks clear (see\nNote\n6).Tip the drained kidneys into a large glass petri dish and using two scalpels shred and mince the kidneys into very small pieces removing as much clotted blood, connective tissue, and kidney core as possible.Transfer the minced tissue into a tightly capped bottle (for example a 150 ml medical flat) and wash with approximately 80 ml of PBSa until the supernatant runs clear, allowing the tissue fragments to settle for 1 min in between the washes and discarding the PBSa washes (see\nNote\n6).Add 50\u201380 ml Trypsin/EDTA to drained tissue and shake moderately hard for 2 min. Allow the tissue to settle and discard the supernatant (see\nNote\n6).Add another volume of Trypsin/EDTA and shake for 4 min. Allow the tissue to settle and this time pour the supernatant into the conical flask containing NBBS. Gently swirl the flask to distribute the isolated cells in the NBBS.Repeat step 14 until no more tissue remains (see\nNote\n7).Filter the cell suspension/NBBS mix collected in Step 14 through the metal gauze filter supported in a funnel placed in a fresh conical flask (see\nNote\n8).

Filter holders and mesh discs can be reused after disassembling and washing.The volume of NBBS, which is used to inactivate the Trypsin/EDTA, will depend on the number of birds. Use at least 50 ml for up to 6 birds and increase the volume by 10 ml for each extra bird. The flask volume should be at least 500 ml.Whilst some kidney cells may be lost in this process, it is an effective way of removing many of the red blood cells that are still present at this stage of the preparation.This may require 6\u20138 repeats.This process helps to remove some of the larger aggregates of cells that remain in the preparation at this stage. Removing the aggregates makes the cell counting process more accurate and the resultant monolayers more evenly dispersed.There will still be a number of red blood cells at this stage. These should be excluded from the cell count. The red blood cells can be distinguished from other kidney cells by their size and shape.For plaque assays and viral growth seed flasks at approximately 0.3 \u00d7 106/cm2 and incubate for 72 h prior to virus introduction.\n",
