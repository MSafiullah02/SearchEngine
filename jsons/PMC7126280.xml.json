            "text": "To achieve expression of viral proteins during infection, viruses exploit many aspects of the host biology, such as transcription (McKnight and Tjian, 1986), RNA export (Harris and Hope, 2000), capping and methylation (Cougot et al., 2004), as well as translation (Sonenberg and Dever, 2003). Viruses also use specific strategies, such as RNA editing (Turelli and Trono, 2005) and splicing (Pongoski et al., 2002), to enrich the diversity of viral proteins produced from the usually rather small viral genome. A particularly bizarre phenomenon, especially in RNA viruses, is the use of multiple start codons within a gene which gives rise to different protein products (Samuel, 1989). The presence of these so-called alternative open reading frames (ORFs) and their translation has been shown to occur by several mechanisms (reviewed in Jackson, 1996): leaky scanning, where the usual start codon of a gene is in an unfavorable sequence context, so that a fraction of ribosomal scanning complexes fail to initiate and continue scanning to the next start codon; internal ribosome entry sites; ribosomal shunting (where, during scanning, ribosomal complexes translocate to a remote position on the mRNA and initiate translation there); and translational reinitiation after termination.",

So far, most of the research on alternative ORFs has focused on the mechanisms for initiation of translation, while the molecular structures and functions of the corresponding proteins have received little attention. This is somewhat surprising, given that the special nature of such proteins (each arising from a \u201cgene inside another gene\u201d) is likely to give new insights into protein structure and evolution.",

            "text": "Recently, a coronavirus was identified as the causative agent of an emerging disease, severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) (Ksiazek et al., 2003). During its first outbreak in 2003, SARS led to at least 8000 infections and over 750 fatalities (Donnelly et al., 2003). The SARS coronavirus (SARS-CoV) genome consists of approximately 29,700 nucleotides encoding a predicted 28 proteins (Marra et al., 2003, Rota et al., 2003), including several alternative ORFs. These occur in the 3\u2032 region of the genome, which encodes structural and accessory proteins that are involved in the assembly of the virus particle (see\nFigure 1). Although the precise details of coronavirus assembly are not well understood, the consensus model is that the RNA genome is packaged in the cell cytoplasm by multiple copies of the relatively well conserved (Stadler et al., 2003) N-protein to form the nucleocapsid. The nucleocapsid then associates with the viral membrane proteins M, S, and E in the ER-to-Golgi intermediate compartment, where virus particles assemble and bud into the Golgi. In SARS-CoV, as in other group 2 coronaviruses, an additional protein is synthesized (called ORF-9b in SARS-CoV and internal or I-protein otherwise) from an alternative reading frame of the N-gene. In BCV, the I-protein is produced in an exact molar ratio with the N-protein (Senanayake and Brian, 1997) and in MHV it is present in the assembled virion, suggesting that it acts as an accessory structural protein in viral assembly (Fischer et al., 1997). The MHV I-protein is not essential for the production of viable virus; however, it does confer a selective advantage for virus growth (Fischer et al., 1997). Although little is known about the equivalent protein in SARS Co-V, antibodies against ORF-9b have been found in patients, demonstrating that it is produced during infection (Qiu et al., 2005).",

This is entirely consistent with the open architecture of the hydrophobic pocket of ORF-9b, which would allow such large hydrophobic molecules to be accommodated, with atoms hanging from the end(s) of the tunnel (invisible in our crystallographic analysis due to flexibility). The mass analysis is incompatible with the ligand being derived from the detergent present during cell lysis. This suggests that the ligand was picked up from the bacterial expression host and is tightly bound so that it remains associated with the ORF-9b protein during purification. In order to establish whether this was an artifact of the expression system used, refolding experiments (see Experimental Procedures) were performed, which demonstrated that\u2014in the absence of lipid\u2014the protein folds into molecules with hydrodynamic properties identical to those of the lipid-bound structure.

In this regard the higher order assembly of ORF-9b in the crystal, as interconnected twisted ropes (see Figure 2D), may be partially recapitulated at the membrane surface, imparting some torque on the membrane.

As discussed above, several other, mainly group 2, coronaviruses (e.g., MHV and BCV) also have an alternative ORF in their nucleocapsid gene. There is good sequence conservation of the alternative ORF in these group 2 coronaviruses, but rather little similarity with SARS-CoV ORF-9b (see Figure 2E). This intermediate relationship reflects the evolution of SARS-CoV, which has been suggested to be an early split-off from the group 2 coronavirus subfamily (see\nFigure 5A) (Snijder et al., 2003). Functionally, the ORF-9b homolog of MHV acts as an accessory structural protein that is not essential for viral infection but confers a small growth advantage (Fischer et al., 1997), presumably explaining why non-group 2 coronaviruses can function without the protein. Taken together, these observations argue that the internal ORF of the N-gene of group 2 coronaviruses evolved after the N-protein (which, in contrast, is present and reasonably conserved in all coronaviruses; Stadler et al., 2003). The most likely mechanism by which such an alternative ORF could arise would be as an \u201caccidental\u201d mistranslation of the N-gene that subsequently evolved into a structured and functional protein (Figure 5B). This hypothesis is consistent with the crystal structure presented here, as, to our knowledge, there is no evidence that it resembles any other known protein fold.",

The result will be a \u201cconstrained evolution,\u201d an idea which has been demonstrated for regions of viral genes which (partially) overlap (Mizokami et al., 1997). Because ORF-9b is entirely contained within its corresponding conventional gene, the constraint applies to the entire protein. The properties of coupled gene products are likely to be suboptimal compared to proteins that can evolve independently. In the early stages of the evolution of the alternative reading frame, this protein might be expected to be rather poorly folded, whereas eventually there would presumably be a balance, struck by selection, with both protein products being somewhat compromised. Thus, the structural disorder observed in ORF-9b (evinced in the considerable divergence of the eight noncrystallographically related molecules; see Table 1) may reflect its relatively recent invention and the hindrance to its rapid evolution imposed by the coupling to the essential N-gene.",

Similar to ORF-9b, vpu encodes a small accessory protein which is present only in a subfamily of lentiviruses (namely, human immunodeficiency virus type 1, HIV-1). Although various molecular functions have been described for the protein, its precise role in HIV-1 pathogenesis remains unclear (Hout et al., 2004). In the vpu gene, the region which overlaps with the neighboring env gene encodes its cytoplasmic domain, whose structure has been determined by NMR (Willbold et al., 1997). This small domain shows two well-defined helical regions and, like ORF-9b, a considerable amount of poorly defined structure (Figure 5C).",

These unusual structural and functional properties are probably a reflection of the distinct evolutionary trajectory of alternative open reading frames. Indeed, we propose that the constraints under which alternative open reading frames evolve give rise to characteristic structural features, most importantly the potential for novel folds and structural disorder. While further studies and structures will be required to test this hypothesis, alternative open reading frames provide powerful model systems to test ideas about protein folding and evolution.",

The forward primer encodes a start codon and hexahistidine tag N-terminal to the gene and both forward and reverse primers contain the attB site of the Gateway cloning system (Invitrogen). The PCR fragments were subcloned into the pDEST14 plasmid (Invitrogen). For expression of the selenomethionine-labeled protein, the pDEST14 plasmid was transformed into E. coli strain Rosetta pLysS (Novagen). Cultures were grown in selenomethionine media (Molecular Dimensions) spiked with 1% glucose as well as lysine, threonine, and phenylalanine (100 \u03bcg/ml each) and leucine, isoleucine, valine, and selenomethionine (50 \u03bcg/ml each). Cells were grown at 310 K until an OD595 nm of 0.6 was reached, and then cooled to 293 K for 30 min.

This gives rise to an assembly reminiscent of a twisted rope. (E) Sequence alignment of SARS coronavirus ORF-9b and its homologs in mouse hepatitis virus (MHV) and bovine coronavirus (BCV). The alignment was performed using MultAlin (Corpet, 1988) and due to the very low level of sequence similarity should be regarded as provisional, pending a proper structure-based analysis. Residue numbering refers to the ORF-9b protein from SARS-CoV. Protein secondary structure is represented as yellow arrows (\u03b2 strands), solid lines (random coil conformation), and dotted lines (disordered regions).

The crystallographically resolved portion of the ligand is shown in yellow; the experimentally phased electron density (contoured at 1\u03c3) is shown in green. The 2-fold symmetry axis lies in the plane of the paper, as indicated. (B) Cartoon of the residues lining the lipid binding pocket. The lipid is shown in ball-and-stick representation and the residues contributed by the two subunits are distinguished by the color of their contact symbols. (C) Mass spectrum of the extracted ligand molecule (designated M). Its molecular weight is 414 Da. In the mass spectrum, three significant peaks are observed, suggestive of proton (+1 Da), sodium (+23 Da), and potassium (+39 Da) adducts of a fatty acid molecule. The observed mass is consistent with a saturated long-chain hydroxy fatty acid C25H50O4 (mass 413 Da), such as dihydroxy-pentacosanoate, or a nonhydroxy fatty acid ester C25H50O4 (mass 413 Da) (Christie, 1982). (D) ThermoFluor assay result for natively purified (lipid-containing) and refolded (lipid-free) ORF-9b. In both cases, there is a strong fluorescence peak at 65\u00b0C\u201370\u00b0C, which presumably represents the collapse of the dimeric ORF-9b structure. Refolded ORF-9b peaks at 66\u00b0C, whereas natively purified ORF-9b has a peak at 69\u00b0C, demonstrating that lipid-containing ORF-9b is slightly more stable than ORF-9b without lipid, suggesting that the lipid has a thermodynamically stabilizing effect on the protein. (E) Proposed mode of ORF-9b membrane interaction (protein structure represented as in Figure 2B, but rotated by 90\u00b0 around the vertical 2-fold symmetry axis). The positively charged side of the protein (shown in blue) could interact with the negatively charged lipid head groups, while the hydrophobic pocket (indicated by dashed lines) binds one or more lipid tails.",

(C) Cartoon representation of the intracellular localization of ORF-9b (red dots) and its possible function in the assembly of the SARS coronavirus.

Based on their genome sequence, coronaviruses fall into three main groups. SARS-CoV is thought to be an early split-off from the group 2 lineage (indicated by a dashed circle). Alternative open reading frames of the nucleocapsid gene are found only in group 2 viruses, such as MHV and BCV (Senanayake and Brian, 1997), as well as group 2-related viruses, including SARS-CoV. BCV, bovine coronavirus; HCoV-229E, human coronavirus 229E; IBV, infectious bronchitis virus; MHV, murine hepatitis virus; PDEV, porcine epidemic diarrhea virus; SARS-CoV, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus; TGEV, transmissible gastroenteritis virus. (B) A model for the structural evolution of ORF-9b within the SARS-CoV N-gene. Starting from an N-gene without an alternative ORF, the protein first arises as an \u201caccidental\u201d translation product, which is mostly unstructured. By gradual constrained evolution, it becomes increasingly structured, eventually attaining its present fold. In this scheme, disordered regions (colored in red) are a relict of the evolutionary trajectory of the protein. The N-protein is represented as a composite of two NMR structures of its well-conserved N- and C-terminal domains (Chang et al., 2005a, Huang et al., 2004), which are thought to be surrounded by flexible linkers (Chang et al., 2005b) (colored in red). The region of the N-terminal domain which overlaps with ORF-9b is shown in green. (C) For comparison, an illustration of the HIV1 vpu and env genes, which partially overlap. The NMR structure of the overlapping portion of VPU (Willbold et al., 1997) (PDB code: 1VPU) is shown. This protein is relatively poorly ordered (rmsd = 1.6 \u00c5 between multiple determinations of the fold, for all C\u03b1 atoms). The least ordered regions (rmsd > 2 \u00c5) are highlighted in red.",
