That timeframe differs depending on the nature and seriousness of the infectious process, but for purposes of this discussion, a maximum of 4 h may be a reasonable upper limit from sample collection to results delivery within the scope of a POC test. In some clinical situations, this will be too long, and clinical decisions must be made without test results for guidance. POCT is also used (especially in resource-limited settings) to provide laboratory results unavailable in any other way. This may be provided by simple test systems that use stable reagents and provide rapid results. Novel systems for remote testing (e.g., viewing of malaria smears via mobile phones) are also coming into use which might fit an operational definition of POCT [1].",

            "text": "There are several reasons to develop a POC test for an infectious disease. These include:\nThe need to quickly provide highly targeted therapy. Current algorithms for seriously ill patients depend on empiric treatment based on the most likely pathogens for a given clinical presentation; however, this method involves broad-spectrum therapy to cover the likely contingencies. Knowing the exact identification of the pathogen will allow more focused therapeutic decisions. If a molecular method also detects important resistance factors in the pathogen, then a therapeutic decision can be made specifically to both treat the pathogen and limit development of resistant organisms.POCT infectious disease molecular assays may be developed to detect specific infections for which a rapid response is desirable. Examples include common outpatient infections such as group A streptococcal pharyngitis where immediate diagnosis saves follow-up effort; or Chlamydia and gonorrhea, where rapid results may allow immediate treatment of patients who might otherwise be lost to follow-up. There is the potential for both clinical and public health benefits from this class of test.Another potential objective of a POCT is to recognize quickly which patients require infection control precautions as they are admitted to the healthcare institution to prevent the spread of the agent to other patients or to caregivers. Some POC assays are meant for surveillance only and in such cases, interventions are taken to break transmission routes and prevent the development of infections. Increasingly, healthcare institutions are being asked to become more cost-effective, and rapid applications of infection control activities have been shown to be most effective. The potential for POCT to impact on infection-control is particularly significant for long-term care facilities and other health care settings without on-site laboratories.\n",

            "text": "The most widely used molecular test at patient POC sites is the real-time PCR (RT-PCR) assay for detection of nasal colonization of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) [2]. Colonized patients can be placed into contact isolation, decolonization protocols can be initiated, and appropriate surgical prophylaxis can be used [3]. The use of this assay within the United States Veterans\u2019 Administration hospitals is one factor credited with lowering healthcare-associated MRSA infections 59 % since universal screening and additional infection control interventions were implemented. Selected nosocomial infections due to Clostridium difficile and vancomycin-resistant enterococci (VRE) also decreased [4]. Two further reports on the use of surveillance for MRSA illustrate the effectiveness of this intervention. With rapid results available within hours of patient admission, the Northshore Hospital System showed 69.6 % decrease in hospital-associated MRSA disease over the study period [5]. In contrast, another healthcare institution used a slower method for MRSA nasal surveillance with results available more than a day later and results were disappointing [6]. Molecular POC tools are virtually the only method possible to achieve the most effective infection control. Additional assays that detect both MRSA and methicillin-susceptible staphylococci in patients\u2019 skin and soft tissue wound sites and in nares are also available [7].",

            "text": "Several attractive targets for POC infectious disease diagnostics exist. These include:\nDiagnosis of bacteremia and fungemia. Current culture-based technology requires incubation for at least 8 hours before the first indication of a positive result, after which some organisms can be rapidly identified using molecular methods [26]. However, appropriate therapy within the first few hours often makes the difference between severe morbidity or death and recovery [27]. Because the numbers of circulating bacteria or yeast in the bloodstream of septicemic patients can be low, the volume of blood necessary to detect small numbers of organisms has limited the application of molecular methods. Once an effective front-end concentration system is developed, the diagnosis of these extremely severe infections can be approached as a POC test.Meningitis and encephalitis are potentially severe infections that benefit from early diagnosis so that patients can be appropriately managed. The limited number of common pathogens associated with CNS infections makes development of such tests feasible. Additional agents for which rapid, simple molecular tests are needed include Neisseria meningitidis, Streptococcus pneumoniae, GBS, Listeria, Haemophilus influenzae, herpes simplex and varicella zoster virus.Tests for diagnosis and management of diseases seen in outpatients, particularly those in hard-to-manage populations. POC tests for STDs, for respiratory viruses and group A streptococci, and for HIV and HCV viral load can potentially streamline care for these conditions, allowing same-visit management and decreasing both the effort of follow-up and the potential public health impact of patients who cannot be contacted to deliver their results.Many clinicians and infection preventionists are concerned about the rising incidence of multidrug-resistant gram-negative rods. Metallo-beta-lactamases, carbapenemases, cephalosporinases, etc., pose risks to patients and problems for infection control. A rapid molecular test to detect major determinants of resistance, regardless of the organism carrying them, would be a desirable rapid or POC test.\n",
