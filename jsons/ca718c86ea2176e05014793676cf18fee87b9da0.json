            "text": "Acute respiratory tract infections frequently occur in children and represent one of the leading causes of morbidity and mortality worldwide. Quick and accurate pathogen detection can lead to a more appropriate use of antimicrobial treatment as well as timely implementation of isolation precautions. In the last decade, several commercial assays have been developed for the simultaneous diagnosis of respiratory pathogens, which substantially vary in formulation and performance characteristics. The aim of this study was to compare the performance of the \"Allplex TM Respiratory Panel Assays\" (Seegene) with that of the automated \"Fast Track Diagnostics Respiratory pathogens 21\" assay (Siemens) for the diagnosis of pediatric respiratory viral infections. One hundred forty-five nasopharyngeal wash samples, collected at the Bambino Ges\u00f9 Pediatric Hospital in Rome during the fall-winter 2017-2018 season, were processed and analyzed with both workflows. Our results suggest a high concordance between the two methods for positive and negative samples. Sensitivity and specificity were calculated with both tests as a reference method. For the Allplex TM Respiratory Panel Assays, they were 98% and 100%, respectively, and for the Fast Track Diagnostics Respiratory pathogens 21 assay, they were both 100%. This comparative study allowed us to highlight the characteristics of the two assays to evaluate the best solution, on the basis of diagnostic routine and laboratory workflows, keeping in mind local epidemiology.",

Residual washes were stored at -80\u00b0 C.

One hundred samples with negative results for influenza virus and 45 samples from influenza-virus-positive washes were chosen randomly. The FTD21 assay was performed at the University Hospital of Campus Bio-Medico of Rome within one month of collection.

High concordance between the two assays was also observed. Discordance between platforms was mainly detected with samples containing multiple pathogens, some of which were present in low amounts. This was primarily associated with the detection of metapneumovirus, as previously reported by other authors [20] . Though the main pathogens were always correctly identified by both assays, the Siemens workflow performed better in detecting low viral loads than the Seegene workflow. However, the low levels of respiratory viruses detected, especially in the presence of pathogens with a low Ct value (high DNA/RNA load), are likely to be related to underlying or residual infection. Thus the clinical meaning of these results is still open to discussion.",

The panel is made up of three mixes that allow the identification of 16 different viruses: influenza A virus (H1 and H3), distinguishing 3 subtypes (H1N1, H1N1-pdm09 and H3N2), influenza B virus, respiratory syncytial viruses A and B (RSV A/B), adenovirus (ADV), enterovirus (EV), parainfluenza viruses 1-4 (PIV1-4), metapneumovirus (MPV), bocavirus (BocV), rhinovirus (RV) and three coronaviruses (CoV NL63/229E/OC43). For each reaction, 8 \u00b5l of the extracted DNA/RNA, in a final volume of 25 \u00b5l, was used. The results were analyzed automatically using Seegene software (Seegene Viewer V2.0), and the whole process took 210 minutes.",
