Readers are referred to these for a comprehensive overview of the field. In this paper, the state-of-the-art is divided into several discussion points, i.e., the heating method, the temperature control method, and the substrate material and fabrication technique.

            "text": "With respect to heat supply, different methods have been employed. Almassian et al. give a comprehensive overview of different possible heating methods in their review paper [12]. Not all of the mentioned methods are easy to implement in low-cost and portable lab-on-a-chip devices due to their bulkiness or implementation costs. Examples of these rather difficult methods are using heating via induction, infrared, or microwave radiation. Others are not useful due ot their challenging temperature control, like with heating up the system using exothermic reactions. Within the field of DNA amplification, different mechanisms of amplification exist. Some are based on thermo cycling processes, e.g., PCR, whereas others are isothermal. The use of an isothermal amplification technique puts less requirements on the heaters. Isothermal processes are either truly isothermal or consisting of three different temperatures, as they have a thermal denaturation step before and a termination step after the elongation step. The switching between these temperature steps does not have to be as fast as with thermal cycling steps in, for example, PCR amplification reactions. The use of less temperature variations makes it easier to maintain the set temperature as there is less heating an cooling involved. Furthermore, it eliminates the use of a continuous flow approach in systems with low thermal conductivities, e.g., polymers. Therefore, it is easier to implement within lab-on-a-chip devices [17,21]. Isothermal DNA amplification reactions can already be performed by putting the chip on a commercially available hotplate [22,23] or Peltier elements [24,25]. However, these heating systems are bulky and power-consuming. Therefore, they are not useful for portable equipment or operation at remote locations. Miniaturizing heaters lowers the bulkiness and power consumption. Miniaturized heaters can be integrated as integrated resistive heaters, e.g., as deposited thin-film metal [26,27,28,29] or as laminated Cu foil [30], or as micro-Peltier elements [31,32]. These miniaturized heaters can be implemented directly onto the microfluidic chip [28] or on a different substrate and leter incorporated onto the microfluidic chip [33,34,35,36]. The geometry of such a heater contributes significantly to the uniformity of the heat distribution within the chip [26,37]. One method to accurately control the temperature is the use of a proportional-integral-derivative (PID) controlled thermostat. These PID controllers are coupled to the electrical heaters and use a thermocouple as feedback-loop to the controller [22,23,24,25].",

            "text": "There are various materials that can be used to fabricate lab-on-a-chip devices for DNA or RNA amplification. In the past 15 years, more than ten polymers, ceramic materials, and metals have successfully been used to fabricate such devices [15]. The major property playing a role here is the biocompatibility of the material. The surface of the microfluidic structure should not inhibit the amplification reaction. This biocompatibility can be an intrinsic property of the material or the surface can be modified or coated to achieve this [12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20]. One often used material is polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) [22,23,31,32,34,35,38], which can be processed using soft lithography [39]. However, this is a fabrication technology used in academia and is not suitable for upscaling to mass production [40]. Fabrication methods suitable for mass production are thermoforming/embossing or injection molding [41]. One of the materials which is biocompatible and suitable for both industrial scale fabrication technologies is cyclic olefin copolymer (COC) [42], which is one of the materials used in the past as well [28,36,43,44,45]. Guckenberger et al. estimates the costs of injection molding of only 50 simple microfluidic devices on $47, but this becomes cheaper when the mass production stage is reached [41]. Another benefit of COC is the possibility to shape it using micromilling. This technique is a rapid prototyping technology and therefore very useful within proof-of-concept projects [41].",

Some papers describe the use of a surface modification step done before metal deposition in order to enhance adhesion between the COC and the metal layer, like a pretreatment with plasma [46] or an organic solvent [47]. Other papers describe the direct deposition of metal onto the COC surface [28,48]. Chung et al. specifically, fabricated an amplification chip in COC with integrated Au heaters [28]. However, their system required heating from both sides as the used grade of COC has a glass transition temperature (Tg) of 130 \u00b0C. This COC could not withstand the required heater temperatures to have enough heat flux into the system. They had to heat up the heater to temperatures above 130 \u00b0C, which caused cracking of the heater tracks due to deformation of the COC. With their double-sided heating they ensured that the reaction mixture had the desired PCR temperatures. However, double-sided heating doubles the amount of metal required, increases the amount of fabrication steps, and therefore increases the price per chip.",

Devices which are ASSURED are (A) affordable, (S) sensitive, (S) specific, (U) user-friendly, (R) robust and rapid, (E) equipment-free, and (D) deliverable to those who need them [20,49]. The first step towards such a device is the development of the chip itself. This paper focuses on the choice of substrate material, metal deposition method, and type of metal. Although, it is mentioned above that PCR and HDA are sequence specific, the reaction chosen is the isothermal multiple displacement amplification (MDA) [50]. This reaction is more straightforward [51], as it amplifies any present DNA, and is therefore better suitable as a proof-of-principle amplification reaction to show the functioning of the integrated heater and the biocompatibility of the substrate after the fabrication process. The use of an isothermal amplification technique also simplifies the final device and lowers its footprint, as there are no pumps required. In this research, external analysis methods are used which do not contribute to the WHO-SDI ASSURED criteria due to their bulkiness, costs, and difficulty. However, suggestions and comments on the integration of low-cost detection methods, which are ASSURED, are given in Section 5.",

            "text": "The proof-of-principle amplification of choice is a MDA reaction, which is a non-specific isothermal method of amplification performed around 30 \u00b0C [50]. MDA is a method of whole genome amplification (WGA), as it amplifies all present DNA [52]. It is commonly used when the initial amount of DNA sample is very low. After the WGA is performed, a sequence specific amplification can be done since the quality the amplified DNA by MDA is very high [53]. The amplification reaction is illustrated below in Figure 1 (the contour of the amplified sequence is highlighted in black for clarity). Starting with a double stranded DNA (dsDNA) molecule, a denaturation step at 95 \u00b0C is required, giving the random hexamer-primers and the \u03d529 DNA polymerase access to the bases of single stranded DNA (ssDNA) strands. The hexamers anneal themself to aleatory parts of the ssDNA sequence. These hexamers work as initiation sites for the \u03d529 DNA polymerases. After denaturation at 95 \u00b0C, the mixture is cooled down to ice temperature and the rest of the reagents are added. The mixture is heated up to ~30 \u00b0C so the polymerase starts to complete the complementary ssDNA sequence, creating again a dsDNA strand, eventually it encounters a hexamer from another annealing site. Once this happens the polymerase will lift up that hexamer and starts to separate the amplified sequence formed from that annealing site. As the polymerase displaces the formed strand ahead of it, it continues to complete the sequence. The displaced strand becomes a new ssDNA strand and therefore, it gives new sites for more primers to attach and initiation sites for the polymerase, continuing the amplification, and thus creating a web of DNA strands. Finally, the inactivation of the polymerase is done by heating up the system to 65 \u00b0C.",

After the amplification reaction, the polymerase has to be inactivated at 65 \u00b0C. However, this does not require fast temperature changes, as would be the case with, for example, the temperature cycling in PCR amplifications.

            "text": "The microfluidic structure consists of two chambers, i.e., a reaction chamber and a temperature monitor chamber. In Figure 2, a close-up of the final chip is shown. For clarity reasons, the two microfluidic structures are colored with food coloring dye. The reaction chamber is based on the work of Bruijns et al. [36] and its dimensions are chosen in such way that the internal volume of the reaction chamber is the same as the reaction volume of the used Illustra GenomiPhi V2 DNA amplification kit (GE Healthcare Life Sciences, Eindhoven, The Netherlands) together with the EvaGreen dye solution (Biotium, Fremont, CA, USA), while maintaining an as low as possible surface-area-to-volume ratio [44]. Using SolidWorks 2018 computer-aided design (CAD) software (Dassault Systemes, V\u00e9lizy-Villacoublay, France), the 3D image of the chip is drawn and with the use of the AutoDesk HSMWorks computer-aided manufacturing (CAM) plug-in (Autodesk Inc., San Rafael, CA, USA), this image is transferred into a computer numerical control (CNC) milling code. The total chip size is 3 cm by 3 cm and contains an inlet and outlet of 1.5 mm diameter. The inlet and outlet are of such size that the reaction chamber can be filled using pipette tips. In between the inlet and outlet, a rectangular reaction chamber of 10 mm by 3 mm is located. Two trapezoid structures are placed in the tapered channels between the inlet/outlet and the chamber. The function of these trapezoids is twofold: First, they minimize the dead volume between the inlet/outlet and the reaction chamber, locating as much as possible of the reaction mixture inside the chamber. Second, they provide support for the chamber closure. A stadium-shaped channel of 1.5 mm wide and 1.0 mm deep is located next to the reaction chamber, in such way that this channel is also covered by the heater. This channel serves as temperature monitor chamber. A thermocouple is inserted in this channel for real-time monitoring of the temperature inside the chip. This way, a more accurate temperature of the reaction mixture inside the chip can be obtained. Via a feedback loop, the input potential can be changed when required. In Figure 3, the SolidWorks design of the chamber-based chip with both chambers is shown. In Figure A1, in Appendix A, the technical drawing of the chip can be found.",

(95 \u00b0C, 54 \u00b0C, and 72 \u00b0C) [28]. However, most amplification methods require a DNA denaturation step at 95 \u00b0C.

Values for \u03bai can be found in Appendix B. From Equation (3), the product Rth\u00d7A can be defined as the sum of 1/h and li/\u03bai. Based on this summation, one can conclude that the convective heat transfer to the air is the most present heat transfer mechanism within the system (begin almost a factor 100 higher than the heat lost in the COC and H2O). This is also evident from solving Equation (2) for every individual temperature differences within the system and also including convective heat transfer directly from the heater into the air. If a heated area of 7.7 mm by 10.1 mm is assumed, which covers both the reaction chamber and the temperature monitor chamber, and a system consisting of 1 mm COC\u20130.5 mm H2O\u20130.1 mm COC is assumed, than the heater temperatures and powers in Table 1 are required. These are all in the workable range when a COC of a proper grade is chosen (e.g., TOPAS 6017 has a Tg of 170 \u00b0C). The only side note here is that at higher temperatures, the temperature gradient through the system also becomes larger. This can be eliminated by using double-sided heating, like Chung et al. [28].",

The model is designed such that it consists of two parallel rectangles of COC (in the real device, the upper plate is an adhesive PCR foil) with H2O in between. The meandering heater are assumed to be lines at the bottom side of the layer stack. This reduces the required complexity of the mesh tremendously, as the heater in the real device will be approximately 100 nm in thickness. The heater temperature is set at a constant temperature of 303.15 K. This makes the heater material independent and the model purely focused on the heat transfer inside the COC\u2013H2O\u2013COC stack. All used values and equations are given in Appendix B. The layer stack is meshed with an extremely fine mapped mesh consisting of 280.650 elements with average quality of 0.9966. A parametric sweep from 0.3 mm to 2.0 mm, in steps of 0.1 mm, is done for both the heater width (wheater) and the heater spacing (sheater), giving 324 combinations. The simulations are solved by using the fully coupled, direct Pardiso solver on a custom-build and 40% CPU overclocked simulation computer, containing the equipment listed in Table 2.",

This copolymer consists of two monomers, an apolar bridged cyclic hydrocarbon (norbornene) monomer and a linear, lesser apolar, linear ethene monomers. Injection molded COC plates (10 cm by 10 cm and 1.5 mm thickness) of the grade TOPAS 6017 (see Figure 4a) are obtained via Kunststoff-Zentrum Leipzig (Kunststoff-Zentrum gGmbH, Leipzig, Germany). This grade is chosen because of its high norbornene content, giving it a relatively high Tg of 170 \u00b0C. This minimizes the chance of melting during the milling process and decreases the chance of heater failure due to a deforming substrate during operation of the heater [28]. The microfluidic structure explained in Section 2.1 is CNC-milled using a Mikron WF 21C milling machine (Mikron SA Agno, Agno, Switzerland), as can be seen in Figure 4b. Milling is a very fast prototyping technique and chosen because of its flexibility [41]. The milling creates a surface roughness, which increases the surface-area-to-volume ratio. This roughness increases the chance of inhibition during the amplification due to the interaction of the used chemicals with the surface [44]. It also causes a considerable loss of optical transparency, which could obstruct the potential use of in situ fluorescence detection in future devices. Therefore, a chemical post-treatment with cyclohexane vapor is done (see Figure 4c). Such treatment dissolves a thin outer layer of the COC substrate and causes reflowing of the surface roughness due to the surface tension of the material, restoring the optical transparency and reducing the surface roughness [59].",

Mo has a smaller coefficient of thermal expansion than stainless steel, and therefore gives less deformation during the deposition. Metals of interest are Au or Pt, which are commonly used metals to function as resistive heaters [54]. The deposition methods studied are DC magnetron sputtering using a custom-build machine (Techno Centrum voor Onderwijs en Onderzoek, University of Twente, Enschede, The Netherlands) and e-beam physical vapor deposition (evaporation) using a Balzers BAK 600 CE (Oerlikon Balzers limited, Balzers, Principality of Liechtenstein). Both deposition methods are capable of large-scale production, which will lower the production costs in the large-volume production stage. The metal and deposition method will be chosen based on the metal adhesion performances on the COC substrate, which is studied using the Scotch tape test [60,61], and the resistance versus temperature behavior in the range 20 \u00b0C to 100 \u00b0C, which is measured in a Heraeus T5025 oven (Heraeus Holding GmbH, Hanau, Germany), customized with electrical readout and connected to a custom-build National Instruments LabVIEW program (Austin, TX, USA).",

The temperature is real-time monitored by inserting a 162 series RS Technics thermocouple K (RS Components B.V., Haarlem, The Netherlands) in the temperature monitor chamber. The thermocouple is read out with a Tenma 72-7715 Thermometer (Premier Farnell Ltd., Leeds, UK).

In Figure 6a\u2013d, tables with the results of the full parametric sweep for different heater widths and heater spacings are shown. Figure 6a shows the temperature deviation between the highest and lowest temperature at the top of the chamber, i.e., the second H2O and COC interface (\u0394Ttopofchamber=Ttop,max\u2212Ttop,min). Figure 6b shows the deviation between the highest and lowest temperature inside the chamber, i.e., between the two COC and H2O interfaces (\u0394Tacrosschamber=Tbottom,max\u2212Ttop,min). Figure 6c shows the temperature deviation between the highest and lowest temperature at the bottom of the chamber, i.e., the first COC and H2O interface (\u0394Tbottomofchamber=Tbot,max\u2212Tbot,min).

As can be seen from the results in Figure 6, a combination of small heater widths and heater spacings will result in smaller temperature differences inside the reaction mixture. This is evident as smaller heater spacings will result in a better coverage of the heated area by heater material. The smaller heater widths will result in a smaller heater cross-sectional area, and thus can be operated at lower powers, as is evident from Equation (1). Resulting in the fact that a densely packed meander structure with small heater widths and small heater spacings can dissipate more heat into the system.",

A side note on the chosen heater width and heater spacing is that according to the simulations, the temperature differences within the chamber are less than \u00b10.3 \u00b0C for the most unfavorable dimensions. This temperature difference is still well-accepted in the temperature window in which the MDA reaction takes place (25 \u00b0C to 35 \u00b0C). However, as pointed out, a smaller cross-sectional area will result in a lower power consumption and therefore these dimensions are chosen. It is known that a meandering heater structure does not give the optimal temperature distribution over the device [26]. Therefore, the heater lines are longer than the width of the reaction chamber, and thus also covering the bulk material outside the chamber in order to improve the temperature uniformity inside the reaction mixture.",

Inhibition of the amplification can be caused by large surface areas as the used chemicals have more surface to have interaction with [44]. The created surface roughness is visualized using a FEI Sirion high resolution scanning electron microscope (HR-SEM) (FEI Company, Hillsboro, OR, USA) and measured using a Bruker Icon Dimension AFM in tapping mode with Bruker Tespa-V2 cantilevers (Bruker Nano Surfaces, Santa Barbara, CA, USA) and Gwyddion 2.52 open source freeware [62]. The results are shown in Figure 8. The surface roughness of pristine COC had a RRMS of 3.5 nm. This increased two orders of magnitude after milling (RRMS of 310.1 nm). With the reported surface treatment [44,59] we were capable of decreasing the surface roughness to a value even lower than that of pristine COC and the lowest reported in literature (RRMS of 0.9 nm). For this grade of COC (TOPAS 6017) it worked the best to do four short exposures of 5 s, with N2 blow drying after each exposure, instead of one longer exposure, as is more common in other grades of COC [44,59]. The difference in duration for the cyclohexane vapor post-treatment can be explained by the different ratios of the copolymers present in each grade. As the grade number increase, the ratio changes towards more norbornene monomers and less linear ethene monomers. The norbornene is more apolar due to the bridged cyclic hydrocarbon present in its molecular structure and therefore, will dissolve faster in non-polar solvents, like cyclohexane (vapor).",

The thin-film TCR values have to be measured as they differ from the bulk TCR values due to its dependency on layer purity, grain size, and deposition method [65,66]. Belser and Hicklin also lists other attributes, such as surface roughness, porosity, and adsorbed materials present in or on the substrate which could influence the TCR value [64].

The first temperature cycle can be seen as a kind of thermal annealing, and therefore gives an hysteresis in the graphs, as can be seen in Figure A2 in Appendix C.1. After this first cycle, the values more or less show the linear behavior. The resulting TCR of this linear part is in agreement with the TCR ranges of Belser and Hicklin [64] and is given in Table 4. Belser and Hicklin used for their experiments substrates with coefficients of linear thermal expansion lower than 1.2 \u00d7 10\u22125 \u00b0C\u22121 [64]. The coefficient of linear thermal expansion for Au and Pt are 1.42 \u00d7 10\u22125 K\u22121 and 0.88 \u00d7 10\u22125 K\u22121, respectively [68]. COC of the grade TOPAS 6017 has a coefficient of linear thermal expansion of 6.0 \u00d7 10\u22125 K\u22121 [42]. This mismatch in coefficients of linear thermal expansion can give strain in the metal layers. Both Au [69,70,71] and Pt [72,73,74] are used as strain-sensitive gauges, and thus are sensitive to strain-induced geometry changes due to thermal expansion.",

Au reflects the infrared radiation of the environment directly, therefore an image with the resistor facing the camera would give a heat map of the surrounding and not of the real temperature of the heater. These measurements also gives a better insight of the heat distribution inside the reaction chamber. The images are processed using the FLIR postprocessing freeware. Results of these measurements are shown in Figure 11a,b. The results are in good agreement with the estimations in Table 1. The slight deviation between the values can be explained by the fact that the heated area in the calculations had an assumed value, the thermal camera measurements used 1.5 mm thick COC substrates without a water-filled chamber, the actual resistors have small parts wich have a double thickness due to the two used shadow masks, and rounding of the values used in the calculations.",

Fluorescence measurements are done in a Horiba Scientific FluoroMax+ spectrofluorometer to verify each amplification. The mixture is excitated at a wavelength of 500 nm and the emission spectrum is measured at wavelengths from 510 nm to 550 nm (bounded EvaGreen dye has a peak at 525 nm [63]). The measured spectra are normalized by subtracting the background signal of a mixture containing only the reaction buffer, the sample buffer, EvaGreen, and DNA. No Enzyme was added to this mixture, therefore no amplification could take place. See Figure 15 for the results obtained in the Eppendorf tube and chips. Figure A4 in Appendix E shows the background signal which is subtracted from all measurements.",

EvaGreen is a bis-intercalating cyanine fluorescence dye consisting of two monomeric DNA-binding dyes which are linked by a flexible spacer. These two DNA-binding dyes bind each in between two base pairs, which make them simple and fast, but also nonuniform and non-specific [44,63]. However, with this dye, a simple yes-or-no answer can be obtained if the amplification took place, as can be seen in Figure 15.",

A distinct peak is visible in the reaction mixtures which is absent in the NTC mixtures. The operating temperature for MDA reactions is around 30 \u00b0C, which is comparable with a nice summer day. Using amplification reactions which such low reaction temperatures could encounter problems at warmer locations. However, as MDA is not sequence specific, this reaction will not be integrated in the final protocols. MDA was only used as proof-of-principle reaction to show the biocompatibility of the device and functioning of the integrated heater.

HDA utilizes DNA helicase (an enzyme also used in vitro during DNA replication) to separate the dsDNA instead of thermal denaturation. After separation, ssDNA binding proteins hybridize on the ssDNA strands for stabilization, ensuring that the next primer will have time to bind to the ssDNA stripe and a DNA polymerase will extend the primers with the complementary bases. This method is a truly isothermal technique in which the separation of the dsDNA can be performed at the same temperature as the amplification reaction, i.e., 64 \u00b0C [9]. LAMP is more similar to MDA in the way it also uses heat to denature the dsDNA. After denaturation, a set of four primers (six can be used as well to achieve better selectivity) and a DNA polymerase is used at isothermal conditions (65 \u00b0C) to amplify the DNA [11]. When used in combination with reverse transcriptase, LAMP becomes a RNA amplification method, which could be used for RNA-containing viruses [11], like virus-based zoonoses diseases as the corona viruses [22]. Despite not being a truly isothermal technique, LAMP offers the possibility to use turbidity as detection method [76]. Such a detection method would simplify the required equipment even further as a decrease in transmitted light through the chip can be used as detection method.",

This can be disadvantageous for amplification reactions, as optimal denaturation temperatures are in the range 92 \u00b0C to 94 \u00b0C [77]. The denaturation in this research was done in a separate water bath, so this temperature gradient was circumvented. However, when on-chip denaturation and/or another amplification technique will be used, a second step will be the optimization of the heater in order to create better temperature uniformity within the system. This can be done by using different heater geometries [26,37] or using double-sided heating [28].",
