In adults, severe falciparum malaria is more commonly seen in populations vulnerable because of war or famine, during pregnancy, and in nonimmune travellers to malarial endemic areas. In the United Kingdom, severe malaria is most often seen in travellers who have not taken chemoprophylaxis, those who present late, and those with underlying medical conditions.

Release of cytokines, such as tumor necrosis factor (TNF), also have a role in the pathogenesis of cerebral malaria.
