In general, marine algal lectins are monomeric, low molecular weight proteins, exhibiting high content of acidic amino acids, with isoelectric point (pI) in the range of 4-6, do not require metal ions for their biological activities and most of them show specificity for glycoproteins than monosaccharides Rogers & Hori, 1993; Shiomi et al., 1981) . Based on the binding properties to glycoproteins, algal lectins are categorized into three major categories, complex type N-glycan specific lectins, high mannose (HM) type N-glycan specific lectins and lectins with specificity to both the above types of N-glycans . Mannose binding lectins are considered essential as they interplay with cell-surface glycoconjugates. Due to their small size and presence of disulphide linkages, algal lectins are antigenic and highly stable. Furthermore, the peculiar small structure of algal lectins makes them more expedient for use as specific molecular diagnostic probes against the cell surface carbohydrates and in drug targeting (Nascimento et al., 2006) .
