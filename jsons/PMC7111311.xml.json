Due to high mutation and recombination rates in coronaviruses frequent host-shifting events from animal-to-animal and animal-to-human have occurred (Chinese, 2004, Guan et al., 2003, Lau et al., 2005, Woo et al., 2009). Bats were identified as a natural reservoir during the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) outbreak in China in the year 2002\u20132003 (Ge et al., 2013, Li et al., 2005). Similarly, a strain closely related to human CoV 229E was found in bats in Ghana (Corman et al., 2015, Pfefferle et al., 2009). Thus, it is speculated that several human and animal CoVs originated from bats (Liu et al., 2015, Shi and Hu, 2008, Woo et al., 2009).",

The S protein contains a large ectodomain, a transmembrane domain, and a C-terminal cytoplasmic tail. The cytoplasmic domain consists of a cysteine-rich and a charge-rich region and mediates S incorporation into virions resulting in infectious virus particles (Bosch et al., 2005, Godeke et al., 2000). Some CoVs like the transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV), as well as the HCoVs NL63 and 229E contain a tyrosine-based sorting signal within their charge-rich region which \u2013 in the case of the TGEV S protein \u2013 was shown to be important for intracellular retention (Schwegmann-Wessels et al., 2004).",

            "text": "Free movement of virus particles through the host cell cytoplasm is restricted. The cytosol is highly viscous and contains structural barriers like organelles as well as cytoskeletal elements (Leopold and Pfister, 2006, Luby-Phelps, 2000, Verkman, 2002). Therefore, diffusion of virus-sized particles is very unlikely and the arrival at specific cellular regions or compartments is nearly impossible (Sodeik, 2000). Consequently, many viruses use the cytoskeleton network of the host cell as a transport system to reach the compartment where replication processes take place or to find their way out of the cell (Leopold and Pfister, 2006, Ploubidou and Way, 2001, Radtke et al., 2006). Furthermore, it is known that the cytoskeleton plays a crucial role during virus attachment, internalization, endocytosis, transcription, replication, assembly, exocytosis as well as cell-to-cell spread. For this purpose viruses rearrange cellular filaments and use them as tracks (Radtke et al., 2006). Regarding TGEV, the actin-binding protein filamin A is a putative interaction partner of the TGEV S protein (Trincone and Schwegmann-Wessels, 2015) and in the case of TGEV-infected IPEC-J2 cells actin filaments were shown to be important for viral replication and release (Zhao et al., 2014). Additionally, an interaction of TGEV nucleocapsid protein with the type 3 intermediate filament vimentin was shown to be required for viral replication as well (Zhang et al., 2015). Another major component of the dynamic cytoskeletal matrix is represented by microtubules. Those polarized structures are built of \u03b1/\u03b2-tubulin heterodimers and are important for cell shape, transport, motility, and cell division (Heald and Nogales, 2002, Nogales, 2000). Several viruses are known to interact with tubulin or their molecular motors like kinesin or dynein (Biswas and Das Sarma, 2014, Han et al., 2012, Hara et al., 2009, Henry Sum, 2015, Hsieh et al., 2010, Hyde et al., 2012). CoVs like a demyelinating strain of mouse hepatitis virus (MHV) use microtubules for neuronal spread and the feline infectious peritonitis virus (FIPV) is transported via microtubules towards the microtubule organizing center (Biswas and Das Sarma, 2014, Dewerchin et al., 2014). For TGEV an up-regulation of microtubule-associated \u03b1- and \u03b2-tubulin was detected in swine testis (ST) cells after infection (Zhang et al., 2013). In the study presented here, we analyzed the interaction of tubulin with the last 39 amino acid stretches of the S protein cytoplasmic tail of Alphacoronaviruses like TGEV, HCoV NL63, and HCoV 229E. Our results show that tubulins interact with the cytoplasmic domain of \u03b1-CoVs spike proteins. Reduced release of infectious virus particles as well as differentially distributed S proteins was observed after drug-induced tubulin depolymerization. Therefore, tubulin may help the S protein to be properly transported, localized, and assembled into virions.",

            "text": "As a next step, a filament depolymerizing drug named Nocodazole (NOC) was used for functional analysis of the S-tubulin-interaction. ST cells were transfected either with full length TGEV Swt or TGEV S Y/A mutant both fused to GFP or with the last 39aa stretches of the S cytoplasmic domain of TGEV, SARS-CoV, 229E or NL63 fused to GFP as well. As negative control cells were transfected with the full length TGEV N or the empty GFP plasmid. The TGEV S Y/A mutant abolishes the retention signal due to mutation of tyrosine into an alanine. This leads to surface expression in single transfected cells while TGEV Swt protein is intracellularly retained (Schwegmann-Wessels et al., 2004). By using the mutant S Y/A protein the importance of the tyrosine-based motif within the cytoplasmic domain of the Alphacoronavirus S proteins of interest was examined. Additionally, a representative of the genus Betacoronavirus (SARS-CoV S), which contains no tyrosine motif was included. Cells were mock-treated or treated with NOC at 3 hpt. To analyze CoV S protein localization during early assembly events, cells were fixed 7 hpt (Risco et al., 1998, Vogels et al., 2011). Next, authentic \u03b2-tubulins were stained by using specific antibodies (\nFig. 3a). Cells treated with DMSO showed typically long and filamentous tubulin structures. In NOC treated cells no characteristic filamentous structures of \u03b2-tubulin were detected. Here, \u03b2-tubulins looked like patches or a camouflage net but not like filaments anymore. Differences in the S protein expression pattern could be observed as well. In DMSO treated cells the S protein accumulated near the nucleus and was less distributed in the cytosol. In contrast, the S protein expression in NOC treated cells was scattered throughout the cytoplasm and looked like vesicles. This phenomenon of differentially distributed S proteins due to NOC treatment was observed for all tested S constructs as well as for the different NOC concentrations of 10 \u00b5g/ml and 50 \u00b5g/ml. Although, the S cytoplasmic tail fusion protein of TGEV, SARS-CoV and NL63 showed additional GFP expression within the nucleus, the accumulation of S itself was clearly visible as well as the altered localization of the proteins after NOC treatment. Cells expressing GFP alone or the TGEV N protein showed no differences in their expression pattern in DMSO and NOC treated cells (Fig. 3d). Thus, irrespective of the presence or absence of a hydrophobic membrane anchor sequence or of a tyrosine-based signal the proteins associated with \u03b2-tubulins. The charge-rich region present in all tested coronavirus S proteins may be important for this interaction. The equal distribution of single GFP as well as TGEV N protein used as control proteins demonstrates that proteins missing a charge-rich region do not interact with tubulin.",

Nevertheless, more detailed knowledge on virus-host interaction would lead to therapeutic tools for infection control. CoVs use the host secretory pathway during their replication cycle. The vesicular transport on secretory pathways is mostly mediated by microtubules and the corresponding motor proteins (Fokin et al., 2014). In case of MHV it was shown that the early secretory pathway is important during the formation of the replication complex (Knoops et al., 2010, Oostra et al., 2007, Verheije et al., 2008).

Adenovirus type 2 and 5 particles as well as reovirus particles interact with microtubules (Babiss et al., 1979, Luftig and Weihing, 1975, Miles et al., 1980). Poliovirus and newly synthesized viral RNA of Simian virus 40 are associated with actin filaments and intermediate filaments (Ben-Ze\u2019ev et al., 1981, Lenk and Penman, 1979). An interaction is likely necessary for initial infection, transport of viral components as well as for the assembly of new viral particles (Hsieh et al., 2010). Moreover, tubulin was already found packaged into virions of Epstein-Barr virus, human cytomegalovirus, and murine leukemia virus (Johannsen et al., 2004, Varnum et al., 2004, Wang et al., 2003). For several viruses like adenovirus, African swine fever virus, canine parvovirus, herpes simplex virus as well as lyssavirus and rabies virus an interaction either of the whole virus capsid or of single viral proteins with cytoplasmic dynein was examined (Alonso et al., 2001, Douglas et al., 2004, Jacob et al., 2000, Kelkar et al., 2004, Raux et al., 2000, Suikkanen et al., 2003, Ye et al., 2000). Viruses may have evolved microtubule-binding motifs or similar amino acid sequences complementary to motifs in dynein for successful interaction (Leopold and Pfister, 2006, Pasick et al., 1994). An indirect interaction of S proteins with tubulin via motor proteins like dynein or kinesin may be a possible scenario for coronaviruses as well.",

            "text": "In transfected as well as in infected cells coronavirus S protein was scattered throughout the cell after NOC treatment. The same was shown for expression of TGEV M protein. The difference in localization of S and M protein after NOC treatment indicate a difference in interaction with tubulin. It is possible that one or both viral proteins interact in an indirect way with tubulin via other cellular proteins. The redistribution of the compartment markers for ERGIC and Golgi shows a dependence of these two marker proteins on tubulin as well in a direct or indirect manner. This phenomenon demonstrates that it is not possible to exclude that the viral S and/or the M protein interact with cellular proteins that themselves are dependent on tubulin. Nevertheless, our experiments visualize that S and M use different modes of interaction and that this leads to a regular incorporation of M protein into viral particles even under NOC treatment but to a strong reduction of S protein incorporation into viral particles. A redistribution in NOC treated cells was already shown for different viral proteins, like Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever virus nucleocapsid protein (Simon et al., 2009) or herpes simplex virus 1 capsids (Sodeik et al., 1997). In the two tested chiropteran cell lines (HypNi/1.1 and PipNi/1) similar results as for S-transfected or TGEV-infected ST cells were obtained. Also here, a redistribution of the S proteins only in NOC treated cells as well as less released infectious virus particles compared to DMSO treated cells were noticed, suggesting a conserved viral strategy to use the host for its own advantage during replication. Due to the assumption that many human and animal CoVs originated from bats and that most eukaryotic cells contain microtubules, a conserved microtubule-dependent CoV replication strategy is likely.",

            "text": "Furthermore, we demonstrated that NOC leads to a reduced amount of released infectious virus particles. Less virus yield after cytoskeleton disruption was already shown for moloney murine leukemia virus and vaccinia virus (Payne and Kristensson, 1982, Satake and Luftig, 1982). To find out which step during the TGEV replication cycle is mostly influenced by the interaction of S with tubulin, cells were drug-treated at different time points (before, while, or after infection). A significantly lower virus titer in the cell culture supernatant of NOC treated cells compared to untreated cells was detected, whereas no differences in viral titers concerning the various time points could be observed. CoVs uses the host secretory pathway to be transported from ER-to-Golgi apparatus as well as during virus assembly (Knoops et al., 2010, Oostra et al., 2007, Verheije et al., 2008, Vogels et al., 2011). An impaired transport of viral components and an affected assembly of S protein into newly generated virus particles may explain the decrease in virus yield. For MHV, microtubules are important for neuronal transport, replication and viral spread (Biswas and Das Sarma, 2014). Also here, a reduced efficiency of viral infection was observed by using microtubule disrupting drugs (Biswas and Das Sarma, 2014). TGEV was able to enter the cells in the absence or presence of NOC, it was able to replicate and to egress but the infection was less efficient regarding the amount of newly formed infectious virions. Due to the fact that depolymerized microtubules did not inhibit TGEV infection completely, virus components have to use other pathways for trafficking beside tubulin filaments to finish their replication cycle. An actin-dependent strategy for virus movement could be possible (Cudmore et al., 1997, Lanier and Volkman, 1998, Sanlioglu et al., 2000). However, lower virus titers may correlate with the differentially distributed S protein in NOC treated cells, too. Actually, S accumulates near the ERGIC where it interacts with the M protein to be incorporated into newly assembled virions (Nguyen and Hogue, 1997, Opstelten et al., 1995). When microtubules are depolymerized S proteins as well as the ERGIC and Golgi compartment are scattered throughout the cell. Due to the diffuse distribution of S and the two compartments which are important for successful TGEV assembly less interaction of viral proteins during assembly may be possible. An impaired transport of virus particles from the Golgi compartment to the plasma membrane due to NOC treatment may also be a reason for lower viral titers. Concerning this matter, a less organized cytoplasm with dispersed Golgi stacks in NOC treated ST cells was already shown by Risco et al. 1998. TGEV virions were seen in these disrupted Golgi stacks whereas only a few were detected on extracellular surfaces (Risco et al., 1998). A reason may be a microtubule-dependent transport of vesicles between the Golgi compartment and the plasma membrane (Risco et al., 1998). To find out if S incorporation into virions is influenced by NOC treatment, virus particles were concentrated out of the supernatant of NOC-treated infected cells and compared to mock-treated cells. In this case, the amount of S protein was similar in DMSO and NOC treated cell lysates, whereas S protein quantity was strongly reduced in pelleted virus particles when infected cells were treated with NOC. This fact fits to the calculated smaller amount of released infectious virus particles measured in drug treated cells. The minimal requirements for assembly of virus like particles is the expression of TGEV M and E structural proteins (Vennema et al., 1996). The amount of M and N protein in released virus particles presented in Fig. 6 revealed nearly no variation after NOC treatment. This demonstrates that coronavirus assembly in general is not disturbed by depolymerization of microtubules. Thus, the reduction in virus titer is mainly caused by the fact that less S protein is present at the assembly site (due to impaired S protein transport) and/or that the incorporation process of S itself into virions is tubulin-dependent.",

Thus, an interaction of S with tubulin supports an efficient generation of infectious virus progeny.",
