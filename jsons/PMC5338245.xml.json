In bacteria, ADP\u2010ribosyltransferases (ARTs) are the primary family of proteins responsible for ADP\u2010ribosylation of target proteins.1, 2 Sirtuin proteins also have established functions in diverse cellular processes such as aging, metabolic regulation and gene silencing.3 While they typically catalyze protein deacetylation reactions, members of the Sirtuin family including the macrodomain\u2010linked sirtuins (SirTMs) have been shown to exhibit ADP\u2010ribosylating activity.3, 4, 5 Both ARTs and SirTMs utilize a bound nicotamide adenosine dinucleotide (NAD+) cofactor, and in their reactions release nicotamide while covalently linking ADPr to a substrate.1, 2, 3, 4, 5 Substrates may be either a specific amino acid (usually a glutamate/aspartate or lysine) on the target protein, or in the case of some eukaryotic ARTs, another ADPr though a glycosidic ribose\u2013ribose bond forming linear and branched polymers. Structurally conserved in all domains of life, ARTs are an ancient protein class with diverse modifying abilities and target proteins. Bacterial ARTs act as toxins, modifying host cell signaling proteins, resulting in cell death and disease.6, 7, 8, 9, 10 ARTs primarily transfer a single ADPr, a reaction referred to as mono\u2010ADPribosylation (MARylation). In eukaryotes, ARTs have evolved into two distinct classes, those that resemble bacterial, MARylating ARTs and those capable of labeling target proteins with structurally and functionally diverse ADPr polymeric chains.11, 12 The latter enzymes are often referred to as poly\u2010ADPr polymerases (PARPs), and control diverse cellular processes including transcription and DNA repair through poly\u2010ADPribosylation (PARlyation).11, 12, 13, 14\n",

Possessing a central six or seven stranded mixed \u03b2\u2010sheet sandwiched by four to five \u03b1\u2010helices, the macrodomain presents an L\u2010shaped cleft that envelops the ADPr moiety largely through conserved protein backbone interactions, as well as aspartate\u2010N6 adenosine and asparagine\u2010O2\u2032 ribose interactions. Macrodomain proteins also function as O\u2010acetyl\u2010ADPr deacetylases, removing the acetyl moiety from the common reaction product of sirtuins.20 The macrodomain\u2010containing family includes the Poly\u2010ADPr glycohydrolases (PARGs).20, 21, 22 The catalytic functions of two additional human macrodomain proteins capable of reversing the glutamate\u2010linked mono\u2010ADPr, MacroD2,23,\n24 and TARG1 (Terminal ADP\u2010Ribose Glycohydrolase 1),25 have also been reported.

At the center of this regulation is a MARylation/deMARylation cycle, where a novel class of macrodomain\u2010linked sirtuins (SirTM) catalyzes the NAD+\u2010dependent transfer of a mono\u2010ADPr to GcvH\u2010L, while a macrodomain protein removes the moiety [Fig. 1(A)]. Rack et al. showed that only a lipoylated GcvH\u2010L could be MARylated by SirTM. Lipoylated GcvH\u2010L is also efficiently deMARylated by the macrodomain (SauMacro for S. aureus and SpyMacro for S. pyogenes). Altogether, the study points to the modification of a shuttle protein (GcvH\u2010L) with a redox\u2010active molecule (lipoate) under reversible control of a sirtuin/macrodomain\u2010catalyzed negative feedback mechanism, where MARlyated GcvH\u2010L represses and deMARlyated GcvH\u2010L activates pathogen redox defense.5 While the molecular basis of SirTM function has been established,5 the structure and function of the SauMacro protein remains less well defined. Here, we report the crystal structure of SauMacro (a.k.a. Sav0325) to 1.75\u2010\u00c5 resolution. Through sequence and structural analysis, we demonstrate that the SirTM\u2010linked macrodomain protein family consists of a core macrodmain fold decorated by an N\u2010terminal 3\u2010helix bundle which scaffolds a novel Zn2+ coordination loop proximal to the ADPr binding site. SauMacro is further characterized by a conspicuous hydrophobic protein core cavity that is suitable for engagement of the lipoylated target substrate.",

Overall, the macrodomain core of SauMacro resembles other macrodomain structures, and is most closely related to MacroD2 (RMSD of 1.6 \u00c5) [Fig. 1(C), Table 2]. Three important differences distinguish SauMacro from other previously determined macrodomain structures. First, SauMacro contains an amino\u2010terminal extension comprised of an antiparallel 3\u2010helix bundle (\u03b11\u2032 \u2010\u03b13\u2032, residues 1\u201366), which is structurally distinct from the two amino\u2010terminal helices found in MacroD2 and MacroD1 [Fig. 1(C), PDB: 2X47].20 Other macrodomain structures, including human TARG1 (PDB: 4J5S)25 and AF1521,16, 18 also lack these amino\u2010terminal helices. Secondly, we identify a Zn2+\u2010binding site, with Zn2+ coordination mediated by an insertion loop between \u03b22 and \u03b11. This Zn\u2010binding motif scaffolds the Zn2+ ion proximal to the presumed ADPr binding site.

Conservation of the N\u2010terminal extension correlates with the conservation of the Zn2+ motif. A BLAST search of SauMacro related proteins (Table 2) reveals a distinct cutoff for conservation of the CxxxxHxC Zn2+\u2010binding motif, whereas the identity coverage drops below \u223c70%, corresponding to a loss in the conservation of \u223c80 amino\u2010terminal residues [Fig. 2(D), Table 2]. Notably, in the absence of \u223c80 amino\u2010terminal sequence, proteins with high sequence homology to SauMacro also lack the Zn2+ binding motif.

The conserved residues C113, H118, and C120 mediate Zn2+\u2010coordination [Fig. 2(A)]. To validate the identity of the metal, we conducted X\u2010ray fluorescence measurements on purified SAV0325 protein [Fig. 2(C)]. This analysis indicates that Zn is abundant in our protein purifications, consistent with Zn2+ modeled in the crystal structure. We also note that binding site geometry is consistent with a Zn2+ binding as confirmed by the \u201ccheckmymetal\u201d (CMM) binding site validation server27 (http://csgid.org/csgid/metal_sites/). The loop containing the 113\u2010CxxxxHxC\u2010120 Zn2+ binding motif appears to be an insertion relative to other known macrodomain structures, all of which replace this Zn2+\u2010binding sequence with a poly\u2010glycine linker. An inspection of the surface of SauMacro relative to other macrodomains containing ADPr reveals that the Zn2+\u2010binding motif does not occlude the canonical ADPr substrate\u2010binding cleft. Interestingly, Asp55 of a symmetry related SauMacro molecule completes the tetrahedral coordination shell of the bound Zn2+ [Fig. 2(B)]. In the case of SpyGcvH\u2010L, the MARlyated residue is expected to be either and Asp or Glu,5 so the observed Asp55\u2010Zn2+ interaction might reflect a possible substrate\u2010binding mode of the ADP\u2010ribosylated target.

The CASTp server identifies a large contiguous solvent\u2010accessible surface pocket in proximity to the Zn2+ site [Fig. 3(A\u2013D)]. This pocket comprises over 1400 \u00c52 of surface area, and can be divided into two main sections connected via a narrow tunnel: one adjacent to the Zn2+ and the others containing the conserved acidic residue D93. Mapping the ADPr from the MacroD2 structure (PDB: 4IQY) onto this surface places the terminal ribose (ribose\") in the Zn2+ \u2010adjacent pocket and the adenosine near D93. Electrostatic surface analysis implicates the surface around the Zn2+ pocket as electropositive, while the surface that would presumably contact the adenosine as electronegative [Fig. 3(B)].

At the bottom of the pocket are two cysteines on the same face of helix \u03b13, C190, and C194, which would lie within disulfide bonding distance to the two thiolates of the lipoate. Finally, the carboxyl face of the molecule, which would be covalently attached via an amide bond to a lysine of the target protein, extrudes out from the hydrophobic pocket, in potentially close contact to the conserved residue Q173.",

MacroD2 (PDB: 4IQY) and MacroD1 (PDB: 2X47), which are both ADPr\u2010binding proteins, have very similar overall folds (RMSD of 0.85 \u00c5 over 210 C\u03b1's), and this loop represents the most significant structural deviation between the two structures. Additionally, MacroD2 was determined in complex with ADPr, while MacroD1 is a ligand\u2010free structure. Jankevicius et al. noted that an apparent 13 \u00c5 shift (5.3 \u00c5 for C\u03b1 positions) would be required to bring F272 in MacroD1 from an \u201copen\u201d conformation to the closed conformation occupied by Y190, the structurally homologous residue in MacroD2, stacks against the distal ribose of ADPr.23 In SauMacro, the corresponding residue is likely F216, and its loop adopts an intermediate position, \u223c10 \u00c5 (3.4 \u00c5 for C\u03b1 atoms) away from Y190 in MacroD2 [Fig. 4(B)]. SauMacro F216 is less likely to adopt the same closed conformation as Y190, as this position might occlude binding to the lipoate.",

As a recently discovered class of oxidative\u2010stress response regulators in pathogenic bacteria, the biochemical and biomedical relevance of these molecules are only beginning to be understood. Our structure suggests that SauMacro is a unique macrodomain protein with a novel Zn2+ binding insertion loop relative to other macrodomains. A three\u2010helix bundle provides the structural scaffolding for this site, and sequence homology implies that this amino\u2010terminal structure may be conserved for related macrodomains in bacteria and fungi. Through structural homology and analysis, we propose potential binding sites for ADPr and lipoate on SauMacro. Future co\u2010crystal structures of SauMacro in complex with these substrates, or with the GcvH\u2010L target protein, and in concert with biochemical analysis, will provide the foundation for potential novel antimicrobials targeting this stress response pathway.",
