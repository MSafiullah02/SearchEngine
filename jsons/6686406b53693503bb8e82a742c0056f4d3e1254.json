This technique has also frequently been referred to by various other names, including gel-permeation, gel-exclusion, size-exclusion, and molecular-sieve chromatography. The basic principle of gelfiltration is relatively simple. Molecules are partitioned between a mobile phase and a stationary phase comprising a porous matrix (of defined porosity) as a function of their relative sizes. A column constructed of such a matrix, typically in bead form, will have two measurable liquid volumes: the external volume, consisting of the liquid between the beads, and the internal volume, consisting of the liquid within the beads. The external volume is usually referred to as the void volume (V 0 ), while the sum of the external and internal volumes is the total volume (V t ). Following sample application, molecules larger than the pores of the stationary phase matrix will be excluded from the internal volume within the beads. They will, therefore, migrate quite rapidly through the",

This is defined as the diameter of the spherical volume (hydrodynamic volume) created by a molecule as it rapidly tumbles in solution. When performing gel-filtration chromatography, one generally assumes that all the molecules within a mixture have the same symmetrical shape, so that the order of elution will be one of decreasing molecular weight. Although this is an acceptable assumption in most cases, one must bear in mind that the operative molecule dimension during gel-filtration is the hydrodynamic volume and, as such, an asymmetrical molecule will appear to elute with an abnormally high molecular weight compared with a symmetrical molecule of similar molecular weight. When separating out proteins, for example, the usual assumption is that all the proteins in the mixture are globular proteins. Asymmetrical proteins (fibrous proteins and certain glycoproteins), however, will appear to elute with an abnormally high molecular weight compared with globular proteins of similar molecular weight.",

Absence of a molecule-matrix binding step also prevents unnecessary damage to fragile molecules, ensuring that gel-filtration separations generally give high recoveries of activity. This separation technique, however, is not without its disadvantages. When separating proteins by gel-filtration chromatography, proteolysis, for example, becomes an increasing problem: the target protein frequently becomes an abundant substrate for proteases that may also be present in the mixture, leading to reduced recovery of activity. Because of the large size of gel-filtration columns, large volumes of eluent are usually required for their operation, often creating excessive running costs. Gelfiltration also has an inherent low resolution compared with other chromatographic techniques, because none of the molecules are retained by the column and non-ideal flow occurs around the beads. In addition, this technique has a low sample-handling capacity dictated by the need to optimise resolution. Despite these disadvantages, gel-filtration chromatography still occupies a key position in the field of biomolecule separation because of its simplicity, reliability, versatility, and ease of scale-up.",

Group separation can be used, for example, to effect buffer exchanges within samples, for desalting of labile samples prior to concentration and lyophilisation, to remove phenol from nucleic acid preparations, and to remove inhibitors from enzymes (e.g. see (19) ).",

One can prepare a calibration curve for a given column by individually applying and eluting at least five suitable standard proteins (in the correct fractionation range for the matrix) over the column, determining the elution volume for each protein standard, and plotting the logarithm of molecular weight versus V e /V 0 . When a protein of unknown molecular weight is applied to the same column and eluted under the same conditions, one can use the elution volume of the protein to determine its molecular weight from the calibration curve.",

Size-exclusion reaction chromatography (SERC) permits one to control the extent of a reaction (such as PEGylation) that alters molecular size and to separate reactants and products. In SERC, injection of reactants onto a size-exclusion chromatography column forms a moving reaction zone. Reactants and products partition differently within the mobile phase, leading to different flow rates through the column. Thus, products are removed selectively from the reaction zone, shortening their residence time in the reaction zone and separating them into the downstream section of the column. In PEGylation, addition of PEG groups to the protein significantly increases molecular size, allowing the use of SERC to obtain a dominant final PEGylated protein size in high yield. The principle was successfully demonstrated using two model proteins, alpha-lactalbumin and betalactoglobulin (21).",
