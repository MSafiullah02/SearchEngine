            "text": "\n\nDirect examination: The skin scrapings, hair including the hair bulb, nail fragments can be observed under microscope by wet mount with 10 % KOH preparation. The digestion of keratin with the KOH can be speed up with heat. An alternative preparation is 20 % KOH with 36 % DMSO that provides rapid diagnosis without heating and the specimens can be preserved for long time. The hyphae are observed under the microscope invading the hair and producing arthrospores. There are two types of hair invasion by the dermatophytes, known as ectothrix and endothrix invasion. In ectothrix invasion, the arthrospores are observed on the surface of the hair, whereas in endothrix invasion, the spores are found within the hair. There are some Trichophyton species also which cannot attack the hair. The different Trichophyton species associated with hair invasion are enlisted in Table 4.5.\nThe specimens can be stained with chlorazol black or Parkers blue ink. Chlorazol helps in identification of hyphae by staining the carbohydrate rich cell wall without staining the contaminants such as cotton or elastic fibres. The fine needle aspirates can be stained with the May\u2013Grunwald\u2013Giemsa method.Majority of Trichophyton species (except T. schoenleinii) do not produce fluorescence under Wood\u2019s lamp. However, fluorescence microscopy (UVA, 365 nm) produces better resolution than wet mount with KOH. The fluorescent substance (calcofluor, acridinium orange or Blankophor) is added to the KOH. It binds fungal cell wall and increases the visibility of fungal hyphae and spores.\nIsolation and identification: Media and incubation condition as described earlier will serve the purpose.\nHistopathology: The histopathological slides are prepared with periodic acid\u2013Schiff (PAS), Grocott methenamine silver and calcofluor white (CFW) stains. The histopathological section shows the dead and degenerating mycelium with cellular debris at the centre of the lesion with well preserved hyphae at the periphery of the lesion. In T. schoenleinii infection, the \u2018scutulum\u2019 (concave, cup-shaped yellow crust) is observed on the atrophic epidermis. Inflammation with round-cell infiltrate is seen in the adjacent dermis. In comparison to direct microscopy histopathological investigation is much reliable, although it cannot detect the species of dermatophyte. The diagnostic sensitivity can be increased with biopsy which is not always possible to conduct especially in human patients suffering with diabetes.\nMolecular biology: The conventional PCR have developed for identification of different Trichophyton species using nuclear ribosomal DNA (rDNA), mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA), chitin synthase 1 (chs1), topoisomerase II (TOP2) genes, small (18S rRNA) and large subunit (28S rRNA) of ribosomal RNA as major target genes. Further, randomly amplified polymorphic DNA (RAPD), PCR fingerprinting, amplified fragment length polymorphism (AFLP) and sequencing of microsatellite markers, have been successfully applied to species identification in dermatophytes but were mostly unable to discriminate between the strains. The sequencing of the internal-transcribed spacer (ITS) region is commonly used for phylogenetic analysis and identification of dermatophyte species. Although, the ITS region shows high sequence similarities between the species of Trichophyton (90\u2013100 %), the discriminating polymorphisms (barcode sequence) exists in ITS1 and ITS2 region of the members of T. tonsurans and T. equinum. In addition, non-transcribed spacer (NTS) region of the rRNA genes is also considered suitable for strain typing of some Trichophyton species, such as T. rubrum, T. interdigitale and T. tonsurans.Recent progress includes the use of PCR-ELISA which can specifically identify the PCR amplified product with the help of enzyme labelled probe producing colour reaction in positive cases. The uniplex-PCR-ELISA can identify T. rubrum, T. interdigitale, T. tonsurans and T. violaceum individually. The matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionisation time-of-flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF-MS) can identify the species of Trichophyton from the grown cultures which is very fast and specific method and the result shows 98\u201399 % similarity with PCR.\n",

After penetration through the skin trauma, the Microsporum spores germinate in the stratum corneum. The hyphae grow along the hair shaft to the follicles where they produce spores. The spores remain attached by forming a thick layer around the hair shaft.

The cell wall is composed of galactomannan, chitin and \u03b2-glucan which act as ligand for the soluble and cell-associated pattern recognition receptors (PRR). The soluble receptors are a family of C-type lectins including lung surfactant proteins A and D and mannan-binding lectin (MBL).

The germination involves conidial swelling (isotropic growth) followed by protrusion of germ tube (polar growth). The polar growth occurs along with mitotic nuclear division followed by a septum formation at the base of the germ tube. Several such septi are formed after completion of each mitotic cycle to create elongating hyphae which can invade the tissues. This germination depends on nutrient sensing, acquisition and biosynthetic pathways for obtaining the nutrients from the host. Under the nutrient-limited condition and other stress factors, the protein-folding capacity of the fungal endoplasmic reticulum reaches its maximum limit and the unfolded protein response (UPR) initiates. The enzymes such as elastase, aspartic proteinase, serine protease and metalloprotease produced by Aspergillus help in the breakdown of host tissue for nutrient acquisition and invasion. For survival and virulence of the fungi in vivo, there is a requirement for biosynthesis of uracil/uridine, folate and lysine. Aspergilli can also utilise a wide range of nitrogen sources in which environmental nitrate is taken and converted into ammonium and subsequently glutamine and glutamate. They degrade the host proteins to obtain amino acids and other nutrients or they can synthesise the amino acids from carbon- and nitrogen-containing precursors. This synthesis is regulated by cross pathway control (cpcA) locus. A. fumigatus can also uptake the iron with the help of siderophores or through the reductive iron assimilation. Besides nutritional requirements, A. fumigatus also adapts with the in vivo environment by the expression of different factors such as pH regulator (PacC) for adaptation in alkaline pH, sterol-regulatory element-binding protein (SrbA) for adaptation in hypoxic condition, etc. Production of different toxins such as gliotoxin, ribotoxins and haemolysin also help in the establishment of infection by preventing cellular effector function and causing cellular apoptosis.",

The adaptive response is initiated with the dendritic cells which can engulf the conidia or hyphae to carry them into the draining lymph nodes. The conidial engulfment occurs through the \u2018coiling phagocytosis\u2019 in which the dendritic pseudopods rotate around the conidia to form a layer following the binding of the mannose receptor DC-SIGN and complement receptor 3 (CR3). Whereas the hyphal engulfment occurs through \u2018zipper phagocytosis\u2019 after the binding of Fc receptor (as ligand) and complement receptor 3 (CR3), this kind of phagocytosis occurs following the contour of the fungi which further activates the IL4-producing CD4 T cells in the spleen and mediastinal lymph nodes. The dendritic cells can also recognise the damage-associated molecular pattern (DAMP) of the fungi through the receptor for advanced glycation end products (RAGE) to activate the T cells. The epithelial cells in addition express the pattern recognition receptors for fungal recognition and as a consequence induce the T cell tolerance.",

Whereas activation of Th2 cells causes the secretion of IL4, IL5 is responsible for fungal allergy in the host and it prevents the clearance. Th17 cell activation correlates with Aspergillus infection during immunodeficiencies. The Th17 cells secrete IL17 and IL22 which recruits neutrophils. Further, fungal growth, inflammatory immunity and tolerance to Aspergillus are controlled by the activation of natural (n) Treg cells. This kind of Treg cells can suppress the neutrophils through the combined actions of IL10 and CTLA4 acting on dendritic cells to produce indoleamine 2, 3-dioxygenase (IDO). This enzyme helps in controlling inflammation, infection and allergy. Thus, protective immunity to Aspergillus is dependent on balanced act of Treg cells over effector Th1 and Th17 cells, with the contribution of IDO.",

Histopathological staining can be performed with periodic acid\u2013Schiff (PAS), Grocott\u2019s silver or methenamine silver stain for detection of tissue invasion. In the tissue section, Aspergillus hyphae are narrow and septate which are not easily distinguishable from other fungi.Different species of Aspergillus has characteristic fruiting body structures through which they can be identified by an experienced person. A. fumigatus conidiophores have a foot cell at their bases. The dome-shaped vesicles contain phialides in their upper portion. From the phialides, long chain of conidia is borne which may sweep inwards, whereas in case of A. flavus, the vesicles are round in shape with the phialides containing spores present on the entire surface (Fig. 4.8).\nIn A. niger, vesicles are spherical which bear large metulae supporting small phialides. The conidia are black in colour.\nIsolation and identification: Media and incubation condition as described earlier will serve the purpose. However, it is the most common fungal contaminant in the laboratory and it is routinely isolated from respiratory tract of healthy animals. So repeated isolation from the clinical specimen is required, along with correlation with the history, clinical signs and histopathological observations for proper diagnosis of clinical aspergillosis.\nDetection of antigen:Galactomannan (GM) is the predominant antigen released by A. fumigatus in the circulation during angioinvasion which can be detected by latex agglutination test, sandwich ELISA in serum or urine samples. The detection limit of both the tests is 15 ng/mL and 1 ng/mL, respectively. However, the GM detection assay is not specific for Aspergillus as it is cross-reacting with other fungi such as Penicillium, Fusarium, Alternaria and Histoplasma. Further, recent investigations revealed the presence of GM in tazobactam antibiotic preparations, nutritional supplements and electrolyte solutions which may produce false-positive reaction especially in human.Similarly, 1, 3 \u03b2 D glucan (BDG) can be detected for identification of Aspergillus. However, it is produced by a lot of other fungi such as Candida, Fusarium, Pneumocystis, etc. So the test can predict the general fungal infection rather than specifically aspergillosis. There are several BDG assay kits available for use in human such as Fungitell kit using amoebocyte lysates from Limulus polyphemus and Fungitec-G kit using reagents from Tachypleus tridentatus.\nMolecular biology: Confirmation of A. fumigatus isolates by PCR-RFLP can be performed using BccI, MspI and Sau3AI restriction enzymes.\n",

            "text": "\n\nDirect examination: The smear prepared from the clinical specimens can be observed under microscope by 10 % KOH preparation for demonstration of yeast. The KOH dissolves the tissue and cell debris present in the clinical specimens especially in the saliva and skin scrapings to clear the visibility. The yeast cells with the broad-based bud are the diagnostic character. The KOH can be used along with calcofluor white, a fluorochrome compound that binds to chitin in the walls of fungal cells and make them visible under fluorescence microscope. Currently the yeast cells are also demonstrated by the negative staining with the Diff-Quik (DQ) stain which demonstrates the unstained yeast cells present in the stained background. Since they are not commensal and colonisation does not occur so their detection in direct smear establishes the diagnosis, and it is considered as most rapid diagnostic technique for blastomycosis. However, negative finding is inconclusive as 37\u201346 % of human blastomycosis patients reveal the presence of Blastomyces in direct smear.\nIsolation and identification: Media and incubation condition as described earlier will serve the purpose. It is the most sensitive and gold standard method for diagnosis of blastomycosis. However, the mycelial form is highly infectious, and the caution should be taken in handling of the culture in the laboratory and it is a time-consuming process causing delay in diagnosis. The confirmation of culture can be done by conversion of yeast phase into the mould phase, PCR and commercially available DNA probe.\nHistopathology: In the clinical specimens such as saliva or sputum, fine needle aspirates and formalin-fixed tissues, the classical look of the Blastomyces yeasts such as round to oval multinucleate cells with a single broad-based bud located intra or extracellularly helps in diagnosis. The tissue sections are stained with haematoxylin and eosin, periodic acid\u2013Schiff stain (PAS), PAS with haematoxylin counter stain and Grocott methenamine silver (GMS). If the classical look is not detected, then the diagnosis becomes difficult as it produces confusion with other yeasts. In such cases, the mucicarmine stain can differentiate the Cryptococcus neoformans and Blastomyces as it can specifically stain the capsule present surrounding the Cryptococcus cells. Melanin stain can also differentiate Blastomyces from other yeasts. The Alcian blue or acid-fast stain can be used for differentiation between Blastomyces and Coccidioides immitis. Blastomyces is weakly positive, whereas Coccidioides immitis is negative. In situ hybridisation with specific probe can diagnose Blastomyces within the tissues.\nDetection of antigen: In human, the ELISA-based kits are available to detect the Blastomyces antigen (A-antigen) in urine, cerebrospinal fluid and bronchoalveolar lavage fluid. Sometimes it produces cross-reaction with Histoplasma capsulatum var. capsulatum due to the presence of shared carbohydrate fraction of A-antigen. Currently BAD1 is the antigenic target having no cross-reaction with Histoplasma as it does not contain carbohydrate. Detection of \u03b2-d-glucan (BDG) is not so effective in blastomycosis.\nSerological tests:Complement fixation test (CFT) can be performed with the yeast phase antigen for detection of anti-Blastomyces antibodies. However, the sensitivity and specificity is low (57 and 30 %, respectively).Immunodiffusion using purified B. dermatitidis A-antigen is more specific and sensitive (65\u201380 %).Enzyme-linked immunossorbent assay (ELISA) and radio immune assay (RIA)-based techniques are currently most sensitive techniques for the detection of Blastomyces antibodies. The sandwich and competitive-binding inhibition ELISA are used for detection of antibodies.\n\nSkin test (delayed type of hypersensitivity): The crude fungal extract (blastomycin) can be inoculated into the susceptible animal for detection of hypersensitivity (like tuberculin test). However, the test is neither sensitive nor specific. The swelling rapidly diminishes and the test is negative during repeat testing.\nMolecular biology: PCR-based technique such as nested PCR can be used for detection of Blastomyces.\n",

            "text": "\n\nDirect examination: The wet mounts with 10 % KOH are employed on the clinical specimen for detection of the spherule with endospores which is diagnostic of coccidioidomycosis. The presence of immature spherule or endospores without spherule may be confused with other fungal infection. The calcofluor white (CFW) fluorescent stain offers best detection of the fungi by binding the chitin and cellulose of the cell wall. However, it can also nonspecifically stain the plant and fatty substances.\nIsolation and identification: Media and incubation condition as described earlier will serve the purpose. However, Coccidioides is extremely hazardous to handle, and several cases of infection from the laboratories are documented through inhalation of arthroconidia. It is also considered as a \u2018select agent\u2019 of bioterrorism. So, Coccidioides-specific laboratory should have biosafety level 3 containment maintained with negative air pressure. Further, expertise is needed in handling of the colonies because the arthroconidia are easily generated. However, the routine laboratory where suspected culture of Coccidioides is handled should have minimum biosafety level 2 facilities. All the cultures are handled under class II biological safety cabinet containing vertical laminar airflow with HEPA (high efficiency particulate air) filter and exhaust air. The lid of the Petri dishes along with suspected culture should be taped, if preserved for 5\u20137 days. After identification, the routine laboratory should destroy the culture properly. The culture should not be transferred without prior permission from the authority.\nHistopathology: The histopathological examination can be performed on the biopsy materials collected from the skin, bone, lung, brain, etc., to confirm whether the infection is disseminated into different organs. In the tissues, endosporulating spherules, empty ruptured spherules and immature non-endosporulating spherules can be detected by staining. Sometimes, mycelia are observed in the tissues which are indistinguishable from other common fungi. The Grocott methenamine silver stain is the best stain for detection of Coccidioides in histopathological sections. However, Grocott methenamine silver can also stain the tissue elements such as mucus, glycogen granules and some bacteria. It causes overstaining of the fungi which can mask the endospores within the spherule. Other histological stains, such as periodic acid\u2013Schiff (PAS), haematoxylin-eosin, Giemsa, papanicolaou and mucicarmine, can also be used as a substitute.\nDetection of antigen: Detection of antigen is useful in the very early stage of coccidioidomycosis when antibody is not developed (within 1 week) and in the patients suffering from hypogammaglobulinaemia or other immunodeficiency who are unable to produce the antibody. The tests such as radioimmunoassay (RIA) and inhibition ELISA were developed to detect the protein\u2013carbohydrate conjugate antigen of the fungi.\nSerological tests: The serological tests are not only diagnostic but also indicative about the prognosis of the infection. Detection of anti-Coccidioides IgM (within 1\u20133 weeks of infection) can be done by tube precipitin (TP) and immunodiffusion (ID) tests. The TP is based on heat-stable 120 kDa \u03b2 glucosidase antigen, whereas detection of IgG (after third week\u2013several months) can be done by complement fixation test (CFT) which is based on heat-labile chitinase antigen. However, canine serum contains anti-complementary substances; so CFT cannot be performed in the dogs. Serological IgG titre can indicate about the severity of the infection in human. For example, increasing IgG titre such as 1:32 or more indicates about the disseminated infection in human, whereas IgG titre between 1:2 and 1:16 is considered as positive for infected dogs.Sometimes, false-positive band is produced in ID test due to reaction between coccidioidal antigen and C-reactive substances present in the serum. This false band can be dissolved with 1.5 % aqueous solution of sodium EDTA, whereas the authentic band will remain as such even after washing.The cross-reaction is observed with other systemic fungi. The sera from mild and primary cases of coccidioidomycosis produce higher IgG titres with Histoplasma and Blastomyces antigens than with Coccidioides antigen.Currently ELISA-based tests are also developed for detection of anti-Coccidioides antibodies.\nSkin test for detection of delayed-type hypersensitivity (DTH): The antigen used in classical skin test is known as \u2018coccidioidin\u2019. Primarily it was prepared as a soluble broth culture filtrate of mycelial cells grown for 2 months in a synthetic asparagine\u2013glycerol\u2013salt medium. Later, an aqueous lysate of spherules was prepared from Coccidioides strain (Silveira) that had been grown in Converse medium and then incubated in distilled water for up to 40 days at 34 \u00b0C. The soluble aqueous lysate is designated as \u2018spherulin\u2019 which can also be used as antigen in skin test. The skin test can be performed in human, dogs, horses, llamas and nonhuman primates. Reversion of positive result into the negative indicates grave prognosis. However, negative result cannot rule out the infection.\nMolecular biology: Primarily a polymerase chain reaction (PCR) was developed using the primers of 18S rDNA of Coccidioides. Further, a real-time PCR is developed with primers amplifying a 170 base-pair part in the ITS2 (internal-transcribed spacer 2) region of the rDNA genome. Several studies also successfully validated about using PCR to detect the unique coccidioidal gene [antigen-2/proline rich antigen (Ag2/PRA)].\n",

The glucose (Glc), mannose (Man) and galactose (Gal) are the most abundant monosaccharide in the cell wall of Histoplasma capsulatum. The glucan (Glc) and N-acetylglucosamine persists as a polymer (\u03b2-1,4 linkage) known as \u2018chitin\u2019. Two different glycosidic linkages (\u03b1 and \u03b2) are present in the glucan structure of both yeast and mycelium. An \u03b1-glucan contains \u03b1-(1, 3)-glucosyl linear residues, while \u03b2-glucan consists of a linear \u03b2-(1, 3)-glucosyl-linked backbone with \u03b2-(1, 6)-glucosyl-linked side chains that vary in length and distribution. Especially in the yeast cells of Histoplasma, the chitin forms the inner layer with an outer fibrous covering made of \u03b1-glucan, whereas the mycelial form is predominantly made of \u03b2-glucan. Based on this chitin and \u03b1-glucan concentration, H. capsulatum is classified as chemotype I and II. The chemotype II strains consist of less chitin and more glucan than chemotype I. Further, concentration of \u03b1-glucan is associated with virulence of the strains. The virulent H. capsulatum strains may possess 1,000-fold more \u03b1-glucan than nonpathogenic strains. Sometimes H. capsulatum produces nonpathogenic strains lacking the \u03b1-glucan in their cell wall. They may produce an unusual morphology and can persist within the macrophages for prolonged period, observed in chronic animal and human infections. The \u03b1-glucan is found to be associated with multiplication of yeast cells within the macrophages, maintenance of yeast cells within phago-lysosome and blocking of innate immune recognition of H. capsulatum by a particular receptor.",

In addition, changes in chemical composition of the cell wall are also noted. In yeast phase, the \u03b1-glucan content of the cell wall is increased than the mycelial phase as discussed earlier and also the changes occurred in lipid composition of the membrane due to adaptation in higher temperature (37 \u00b0C). Some phase-specific virulence factors are expressed by H. capsulatum yeast cells such as CBP1, Yps 3 and Yps 21:E9. The sulphur metabolism can influence the morphotype in H. capsulatum. Addition of sulfhydryl-reducing agent (dithiothreitol) fixes cells in the yeast phase independent of temperature, whereas the addition of sulfhydryl-oxidising agents (p-chloromercuriphenylsulfonic acid, PCMS) fixes cells in the mycelial phase independent of temperature. The enzyme hybrid histidine kinase (DRK1) regulates this phenotypic switch in H. capsulatum. It acts as a sensor in the change of environmental temperature and regulates the expression of the genes for yeast phase-specific virulence factors like CBP1, AGS1 and Yps-3.

The galactomannan complexes may also protect the organism against its own serine-thiol protease, an enzyme associated with pathogen dissemination through the extracellular matrix. In addition, heat shock protein (HSP60) of H. capsulatum var. capsulatum is considered as an immunodominant antigen; vaccination of mice with this protein protected them from lethal and sublethal histoplasmosis due to its stimulatory nature of CD4+ T cells. The M antigen (catalase B) is a major diagnostic antigen as it can induce both the cellular and humoral immune responses.",

They are intracellular within macrophages or neutrophils or occasionally they are extracellular. Budding may be visible from the pointed end of the yeast cells. The electron microscopy can be applied for detection of H. capsulatum var. farciminosum with minute cellular details in the skin biopsy samples.Direct examination provides best result for detection of H. capsulatum var. capsulatum in pulmonary histoplasmosis patients. In South America, Tzanck cytodiagnosis technique provides a useful and rapid diagnosis method for AIDS-associated histoplasmosis, due to the high frequency of mucocutaneous lesions in these patients.\nIsolation and identification: Isolation of H. capsulatum var. capsulatum from bone marrow aspirates and blood samples suffering from disseminated histoplasmosis is an important diagnostic tool. In blood culture, the lysis-centrifugation technique should be employed, since it is sevenfolds more sensitive than the conventional techniques used for clinical sample preparation. Media and incubation condition as described earlier will serve the purpose.\nAnimal inoculation test: Laboratory animals such as mice, guinea pig and rabbits are used for experimental inoculation of H. capsulatum var. farciminosum. Impression smear of the liver and spleen from the inoculated animals should show the yeast cells 2\u20134 weeks post inoculation in positive cases.\nDetection of antigen: ELISA and fluorescent antibody technique (FAT) are successfully used for the detection of H/M antigen of H. capsulatum var. farciminosum from cultured mycelium. Enzyme immunoassays are also used for the detection of H. capsulatum var. capsulatum circulating polysaccharide antigens in the immunocompromised human patients with a disseminated form.\nSerological tests:Passive haemagglutination, immunodiffusion, complement fixation test (CFT), radioimmunoassay (RIA) and ELISA were developed to detect H. capsulatum var. capsulatum antibodies from human and animal clinical samples.Immunodiffusion test detects the presence of two types of precipitin bands, i.e. M and H bands. The M band develops in both acute and chronic infection and may be detected for years even after recovery, whereas the H band is rare and, if found, is associated with chronic or severe acute infection. The assay is 80 % sensitive but more specific than CFT. It gives positive results in the majority of progressive pulmonary and disseminated forms, and its titres are related to the fungal burden, so they decrease with the successful treatment. Immunodiffusion is not very useful in HIV-positive patients with histoplasmosis, since it gives positive results in only 35 % of mycologically proved cases of histoplasmosis.The CFT uses two types of antigens, i.e. yeast and mycelial (histoplasmin). The diagnosis is based on fourfold rise in CF antibody titre; a single titre of \u22651:32 is suggestive but not diagnostic. The CF antibody persists for more than 1 year. The test is cross-reactive with other fungal infection and granulomatous diseases such as tuberculosis and sarcoidosis.\nHistoplasma antibody was detected in the urine of 89 % of human patients with disseminated form of histoplasmosis and 37 % of human patients with other forms of histoplasmosis by RIA and ELISA methods. The specificity was noted as 99 %. However, false-positive result was noted in transplant patients receiving rabbit antithymocyte globulin. The serological response is strongly detectable in pulmonary histoplasmosis than disseminated and asymptomatic forms due to lower intensity of exposure resulting in reduced fungal burden and antigenic simulation or due to immunosuppression.Skin hypersensitivity test (histofarcin test)The mycelial form of H. capsulatum var. farciminosum is grown on polystyrene discs floating PPLO media containing 2 % glucose and 2.5 % glycerine at 23\u201325 \u00b0C for 4 months. The fungus-free culture filtrate is mixed with acetone (2:1) and held at 4 \u00b0C for 48 h. The supernatant is decanted and the acetone is allowed to evaporate. The precipitate is suspended to 1/10 original volume in distilled water. The animals are inoculated intradermally with 0.1 ml of antigen in the neck. The inoculation site is examined for the presence of swelling at 24, 48 and 72 h postinjection. In positive case, an indurated and elevated area at the injection site will be observed.\n\nMolecular biology: A PCR assay was developed for detection of H. capsulatum var. capsulatum from both the clinical samples and culture using the primers for the gene encoding M antigen. This assay had a sensitivity and specificity of 100 %.Real-time PCR showed promising result by detection of H. capsulatum var. capsulatum from tissue biopsies and bronchoalveolar lavage fluid from human patients who had documented histoplasmosis.\n",

The cytoplasm also contains endoplasmic reticulum, lipid-rich globules and vacuoles. The cell wall is unilamellar in nature with a fibrillar capsule of electron-dense material. This juvenile sporangium undergoes the sequential morphological changes to produce immature, intermediate, early mature and mature sporangia. The intermediate sporangia (70\u2013150 \u03bcm) contain thickened bilamellar cell wall made of chitin (thinner electron-dense outer wall and thicker translucent inner wall), several nuclei, several flat cristae mitochondria and an early pore. The cytoplasm condenses around each of the nucleus to develop endospores (4\u201310 \u03bcm in diameter), and the sporangium with such endospores is known as early mature sporangia. The mature sporangium is a large (up to 400 \u03bcm) spherical body containing hundreds of mature and immature endospores and a pore or operculum. It is enclosed within a thin cell wall with three prominent inner layers.

The capsule can be best observed in fresh preparations by staining with diluted India ink or phase contrast microscopy. Giemsa can also partially stain the capsule. In tissue section, it can be viewed with mucicarmine or Alcian blue stain. The capsule of Cryptococcus neoformans consists primarily of two polysaccharides, glucuronoxylomannan (GXM) and glucuronoxylomannogalactan (GXMGal), along with smaller amounts of mannoproteins. In addition to being associated with the cell, these molecules are also shed as an exopolysaccharide. It is noticed that the Ca++ acts as the bridge between the negatively charged glucuronic acid residues of neighbouring GXM fibres, mediating capsule assembly through GXM-GXM aggregation. So in absence of Ca++, there is increased GXM shedding, and in the presence of EDTA the capsule size is decreased. The assembly of capsule is also influenced by the cell wall composition present beneath it. The cells without \u03b1 (1, 3)-glucan in their cell walls do not display the surface capsule, whereas the cells lacking cell wall \u03b2 (1, 3) glucan form larger capsules than those of wild-type cells. Two major transcription factors, namely, cryptococcal Nrg1 and Cir1, play central role in regulation of the capsule formation. Recently seven more transcriptional regulators that affect capsule size are also elucidated (Gat201, Tup1, Gcn5, Rim101, Hap3, Hap5 and Ada2). The capsule size is increased with iron deprivation, increased CO2 concentration and the presence of serum in vitro and increased age of the organism or duration of infection in vivo.\n",

A total of 6572 protein-encoding genes were identified, which contain an average of 6.3 exons of 255 bp and 5.3 introns of 67 bp. There was no evidence of whole genome duplication. Overall 65 % of the genes of C. neoformans are conserved, 10 % of the genes are unique to C. neoformans and the remaining 25 % have non-fungal sequences. There are total 11 gene families, among them 2 are exclusive for C. neoformans, one encodes protein required for capsule formation and the other encodes nucleotide sugar epimerases associated with cell wall formation. Approximately 5 % of the genome is constituted with transposons clustered in single blocks (40\u2013100Kb) that may represent sequence-independent regional centromeres. Each block contains Tcn5 and Tcn6 transposons. The transposons are also clustered adjacent to the rDNA repeats and within the mating-type (MAT) locus.

In birdseed agar, the colonies appear as brown coloured in the centre of the plate due to the production of melanin. The optimum capsule production is detected in chocolate agar after incubation at 37 \u00b0C with 5 % CO2 tension.

It is a reversible process and occurs only in a small fraction of the pathogenic population both in vitro and in vivo especially during chronic infection. It is detected in Cryptococcus neoformans serotype A, D and in C. neoformans var. gattii. The switching results the change of the smooth colonies into mucoid colony type. The smooth colonies are round with smooth-domed surface and smooth edges, whereas the mucoid colonies have a shiny mucoid surface due to excess production of viscous polysaccharide. These mucoid varieties show slower growth rate and produce the larger capsule. The major constituent of the capsule (GXM) is more viscous, can accumulate in the meninges and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and is more resistant to phagocytosis by the macrophages which enhance the virulence of the mucoid varieties. Further, the mucoid varieties can increase the intracranial pressure in chronic experimental cryptococcosis as observed in rat model.",

The dormancy of the yeast cells is associated with several adaptive and immune evasion mechanisms. Calcineurin, produced by C. neoformans dephosphorylates a group of proteins that allow for their growth at physiological body temperature (37 \u00b0C), elevated CO2 and alkaline pH. It also induces metabolic and oxidative stress genes required for their survival within the host tissues. The capsule of the fungi helps in evasion of immune system and survival within the host. The capsule is constituted with mannan (polysaccharide) which is highly hydrophilic. It makes a gelatinous zone surrounding the yeasts that conceals the pattern recognition receptors (PRR) from the immune system. Further, the mannan component can induce the production of IL10 (anti-inflammatory) and reduces the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines from the antigen-presenting cells and T lymphocytes. It also reduces the surface expression of activation markers and thus downregulates the macrophages, dendritic cells and neutrophils. The capsule also prevents antibody binding with the yeasts. Other capsular characteristics such as antiphagocytic property, shedding of l-selectin from the neutrophil surface associated with reduced adhesion and chemotaxis of neutrophils into the inflammatory site and altered phagocytosis (binding of capsular GXM with FcR\u03b3IIB of host cells produces IL10 which decreases the immune response) also help in immune evasion. However, persistence within the host for the longer period depends on survival of the yeasts within the macrophages and endothelial cells. The survival strategy includes increased capsule synthesis, enzyme production (laccase, phospholipaseB1), production of melanin, Ssa1 (heat shock protein homolog), intervention with lipid metabolism, antioxidant system (superoxide dismutase, glutathione peroxidase), interference with nitric oxide synthase (NOS) induction leading to inhibition of nitric oxide production and capability to exit the cells (expulsion or phagosome extrusion). Further, Cryptococcus can modulate the adaptive immune response by several ways such as inhibition of T cell activation and induction of T cell apoptosis, induction of nonprotective Th2 response, interference with dendritic cell maturation and interference with antibody function that also helps in dormancy of the yeasts.",

After close attachment with the host endothelial cells, the activation of host protein kinase C \u03b1-isoform occurs followed by cytoskeleton rearrangement that contributes to the intracellular transport. Within the cell cytoplasm, they are present in a membrane-bound vacuole, and they can exit from the cells with minimal damage. Thus, the endothelial cells are used as a vehicle by the yeasts to penetrate the barrier (transcytosis).

The dendritic cells (DC), natural killer cells (NK) and neutrophils can also be lethal for the nonpathogenic Cryptococcus. The capsule can activate the alternative complement pathway and the binding of C3 with the yeasts. This C3-mediated binding is absent in CNS explaining another reason for their CNS affinity. Most pathogenic strains produce different virulence factors (Table 4.28) which can evade the innante response. The innate response helps to develop the adaptive immune response. The protective anti-Cryptococcal immunity is T cell-mediated (CD4+ Th1 and Th17).

The tissue biopsies can be stained with periodic acid\u2013Schiff base (PAS) \u2013 haematoxylin stain \u2013 which will outline the yeast cell and the capsule will appear as clear zone surrounding the cell. In Mayer\u2019s mucicarmine stain, the capsule and cell wall appears as red.Another characteristic feature of Cryptococcus is narrow base budding (Fig. 4.25) in comparison to other yeasts (Blastomyces) having broad base budding (Fig. 4.10). Sometimes false-positive results are produced due to confusion with globules of myelin, lysed cells, lymphocytes and dead yeasts after successful treatment.\nIsolation and identification: The centrifuged urine precipitate produces better isolation of the yeasts than the other clinical samples as most of the animals suffer from renal impairment. Media and incubation condition as described earlier will serve the purpose.\nAnimal inoculation test: Mice are inoculated intracerebrally or intraperitoneally or into the tail vein, and after 2 weeks they are sacrificed following the standard animal ethics protocol. In positive cases, gelatinous lesions are observed in the abdominal cavity and lungs. Cryptococcus neoformans var. neoformans is the only pathogenic species in mice. Rabbits are naturally resistant to cryptococcosis. This test is not considered as a standard practice nowadays.\nDetection of antigen: Detection of Cryptococcal antigen in the CSF (antigenaemia titre) can be performed by latex particles coated with polyclonal serum and ELISA. Both of the tests are specific and sensitive. The detection of antigen is possible from both the live and dead organisms. During initial phase of therapy, disintegration of the yeast cells releases the capsule which produces high titre (>1: 60,000). So, the tests should not be done within 6\u20138 weeks after initiation of the therapy. The titre can be observed even after successful treatment as the dead organisms also have the intact capsule. However, negative titre is inconclusive because the relapse of the infection may occur if the organism persists in the nasal cavity. So, nasal culture should be done as a supplementary test for confirmation.\nSerological tests: The serological tests for detection of Cryptococcal antibodies in serum are not very useful because the healthy animals also produce antibody titre due to carriage or persistent infection. Latex particle coated with monoclonal rabbit anticapsular antigen and indirect fluorescence antibody test (FAT) can be used for the detection of serum antibody. The false-positive reaction may occur in the patients infected with Trichosporon, Mucor, Penicillium and Histoplasma.\nMolecular biology: Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) is developed to detect Cryptococcal CAP 59 gene in biopsy samples collected from suspected animals.\n",

Several external (environmental cues) and internal factors regulate the morphological switch of Candida. The environmental cues include presence of serum, temperature (37 \u00b0C), low levels of oxygen, high levels of CO2 and poor nutrition. Bacterial peptidoglycan present in serum, N-acetylglucosamine found in mucus of gastrointestinal tract, 5 % CO2 as a product of host cellular respiration and poor nutrition can induce the filamentous growth through the activation of cAMP/PKA pathway (regulated by Candida Ras protein). The pH change response is mediated through Candida Rim101 pathway. The contact-dependent response and osmotic sensing are regulated by Mkc1 and Hog1 MAPK pathway, respectively. The internal factors include the filament-induced gene (HGC1) which encodes a cyclin-related protein required for septin phosphorylation and inhibition of cell separation. Several members of secreted aspartyl proteinase (SAP) gene family (SAP4, SAP5, SAP6) are also expressed during morphological switch required for invasion of host tissues. The transition from yeast to hyphal phase in Candida is regulated by the activation of mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinase and cAMP-protein kinase A (PKA) signal transduction pathways which can also coordinately regulate the virulence gene expression associated with this transition. Three sensor histidine kinases (Sln1, Chk1, Nik1) also regulate the phase conversion and mutants are unable to produce hyphae. Quorum-sensing (microbial communication) molecules such as farnesol, tyrosol and dodecanol are also associated with the transition.",

In the laboratory, this switching is rare (1 in every 104 cell division) and it is regulated by host environmental factors. These morphological types are genetically stable, i.e. white or opaque cells always produce white or opaque type of progeny, respectively. The \u2018white\u2019 cells are relatively round and form smooth colonies on solid media, while \u2018opaque\u2019 cells are large and elongated and form flat and grey or opaque colonies. Certain phenotype-specific genes (WH11, EFG1) are expressed by white cells, while OP4 and SAP4 are expressed by opaque cells. White cells are more virulent and can easily colonise the host internal organs, whereas the opaque cells are associated with cutaneous infection probably due to expression of SAP4 gene. The stable opaque type and either a or \u03b1-mating-type cell can undergo efficient sexual mating. Master regulator of this complex switching system is WOR1 which can convert the white cells into opaque cells. This WOR1 expression produces a direct positive feedback loop by binding its own promoter and turning \u2018on\u2019 its own expression. The a/\u03b1-heterodimer cells (mating type) cannot switch from white to opaque because they directly repress the WOR1 promoter. The host environmental factors regulating white\u2013opaque transition are CO2 and N-acetyl glucosamine (present in commensal bacterial cell wall and gastrointestinal tract mucus) which can produce stable opaque phenotype. Other factors, such as oxidative stress, UV light and adenine, also regulate white\u2013opaque transition.",

These tetraploid cells can undergo mitosis several times. In Candida, meiotic division is not observed to reduce the ploidy (formation of diploid from tetraploid cells).

This is a characteristic of C. albicans and C. tropicalis (after prolonged incubation for 3 h).\nDemonstration of chlamydospore production: For demonstration of chlamydospore, single isolated Candidal colony can be inoculated into the cornmeal tween 80 agar or chlamydospore agar by making the parallel cuts in the media. Sometimes below the surface inoculation is preferred for better chlamydospore production in low-oxygen tension. The plates are incubated at 30 \u00b0C for 2\u20134 days. A coverslip is placed over the surface, and the plate is observed under the high dry objective for the detection of thick-walled chlamydospores (8\u201312 \u03bcm) at the tips of pseudohyphae.\nHistopathology: The presence of blastospores and pseudohyphae in the histochemically stained smear can be identified. A monoclonal antibody (3H8) is developed against C. albicans cell wall mannoprotein which can specifically recognise C. albicans in culture and in paraffin-embedded tissue sections using immunofluorescent and immunohistochemical staining. This antibody specifically detects the mycelial forms and to a lesser extent blastospores of C. albicans and does not react with any other Candida spp. Fluorescent in situ hybridisation (FISH) using oligonucleotide probes directed against 18S rRNA has been used to differentiate C. albicans from C. parapsilosis in tissues.\nImmunological assays: The ELISA-based tests are developed to detect the Candidal antigens such as secreted aspartyl proteinase, mannan and \u03b2-D glucan. Dissociation of antigen\u2013antibody complexes is necessary for the optimal detection of mannan in the circulation. This antigen is heat stable and resists boiling, proteinase treatment and acidic pH. So antigen\u2013antibody complexes are routinely dissociated by boiling with EDTA or by enzymatic treatment. The sensitivity and specificity of the mannan-based test is 58 and 93 %, respectively, whereas the sensitivity and specificity of \u03b2-D glucan (BDG) detection test is 77 and 85 %, respectively. These immunological assays are useful in diagnosis of Candida in immunocompromised patients who produce negligible or undetectable amount of antibodies.\nSerological tests: The ELISA-based serological tests are developed for detection of antibodies against Candidal aminopeptidase, mannan and secreted aspartyl proteinase in the suspected serum. Indirect immunofluorescence assay is also developed for the detection of anti-Candidal antibody (IgG). However, serological tests for detection of Candida are not so much reliable. The false-positive reaction occurs due to superficial colonisation, and false-negative reaction occurs in immunocompromised patients producing low or undetectable level of antibodies.\nMolecular biology: Several types of PCR such as semi-nested and nested PCR, multiplex PCR followed by DNA sequencing or pyrosequencing are developed for detection of Candidal DNA. The target DNA includes rRNA (5.8S, 18S, 28S) gene, internal-transcribed spacer (ITS) and intergenic spacer (IGS) region. However, liberation of DNA from the cell is challenging due to the presence of a highly rigid cell wall which often produces false-negative result. The false-positive result is produced when highly conserved rRNA (5.8S, 18S, 28S) or other genes are targeted and airborne fungal contamination occurs. Confirmation of PCR amplicon by enzyme immune assay (EIA) using colorimetric substrate is considered as an easy and cheapest method.Real-time PCR method is also developed using Taqman probe or light cycler system for the identification of Candida. They also lack the post amplification detection costs; however, the initial cost for setup of the laboratory and instruments is high.\n",

            "text": "\n\nDirect examination: The wet mounts with 10 % KOH are employed on the clinical specimen for detection of the yeast cells which is diagnostic of sporotrichosis. However, detection of yeasts depends on the fungal burden in the body. So detection is easier in cat specimens than human clinical samples due to high fungal burden in cats. Staining can be performed with Gram stain or Giemsa stain (for diluted pus sample). They are not so much confirmatory because \u2018cigar-shaped buds\u2019 are present only in 1\u20132 % cases. Instead, fluorescent staining offers confirmatory diagnosis of the yeasts.\nIsolation and identification: Media and incubation condition as described earlier will serve the purpose.\nHistopathology: The yeast cells of S. schenckii can be demonstrated in the tissues with haematoxylin and eosin (H&E), Gomori methenamine silver (GMS) or periodic acid\u2013Schiff (PAS) stain. The cells appear as spherical with PAS-positive capsule.The granuloma produced by the fungi consists of three zones. The central or chronic zone contains neutrophils, histiocyte and lymphocytes along with \u2018asteroid bodies\u2019. Surrounding the central zone, there is a second zone which contains epithelioid cells and giant cells (strange body and Langerhans type). The third and outer zone is composed of lymphocytes, plasmocytes and fibroblasts. However, the zones are not a constant diagnostic feature and the cells can mingle with each other. In dogs, the granuloma is characterised by increased neutrophil infiltration and absence of lymphocytes and macrophages which can differentiate it with the leishmaniasis lesion.The \u2018asteroid bodies\u2019 or \u2018asteroid corpuscles\u2019 (found in 20\u201366 % cases) originate from the Splendore\u2013Hoeppli reaction in sporotrichosis. The Splendore\u2013Hoeppli reaction is a localised immunological response in fungal, bacterial or parasitic infection, and it is characterised by the formation of radiating homogenous, refractile, eosinophilic club-like material surrounding a central eosinophilic focus (Fig. 4.32). The asteroid bodies in Sporotrichosis consists the viable yeast cells in the centre along with the host IgG and IgM on the spikes of the radiated crown. Thus, the asteroid bodies use the host immune molecules to provide a safe shelter to the yeasts.\n\nSerological tests: The serological tests such as agarose gel precipitation test (AGPT), tube agglutination (96 % sensitivity), latex agglutination (94 % sensitivity) and immunoelectrophoresis can be employed for detection of antibodies against S. schenckii. The AGPT does not cross-react with the sera from leishmaniasis. However, these tests are not so much sensitive for the diagnosis of cutaneous form of the infection. Enzymatic immune assay such as ELISA is a preferred choice of serodiagnosis. The test was initially developed against the S. schenckii conA-binding fraction (SsCBF) antigen. However, in serodiagnosis of cutaneous form, this antigen-based ELISA produces cross-reaction with other infection such as paracoccidioidomycosis. Later, the exoantigens produced by a mycelial phase of S. schenckii strain, isolated from Brazil, were used in ELISA which produced no cross-reaction with antigens and serum samples from patients with coccidioidomycosis, histoplasmosis or paracoccidioidomycosis.\nSkin test for detection of delayed-type hypersensitivity (DTH): The \u2018sporotrichin test\u2019 is a tuberculin-like skin test for the detection of DTH against sporotrichosis. The antigen used for the test varies with the country and accordingly the result also varies. The 5 McFarland standard suspension of heat-killed yeast cells, extracted mycelial antigens at 1:2,000 dilution (approximately 5 \u00d7 107 cells/mL) or diluted yeast phase antigens at 1:4,000 were used as antigen in Brazil and Mexico, respectively. The antigen is inoculated at 0.1 mL into the forearm or back of the suspected patient. A positive result involves an indurated, erythematous and painful area of more than 5 mm in diameter at the site of the injection 48 h after inoculation. The test is sensitive for detection of lymphocutaneous and fixed cutaneous forms. Rarely, the false-negative reaction is produced in anergic or immunosuppressed patients and false-positive reaction is produced in healthy patients previously suffered from the infection. Experimentally the sporotrichin test with SsCBF antigen in guinea pig was found reactive. In Brazil, the sporotrichin test was carried out among the captive mammals present in a zoo for epidemiological investigation.\nMolecular biology: The chitin synthase gene (ChS1)-based PCR was first developed which can detect up to 10 picogram of genomic S. schenckii DNA. Further PCR-based assays are also developed, detecting DNA topoisomerase II and internal transcriber space in the rRNA gene of S. schenckii.\n",

The slide can be stained with modified acid-fast staining to detect the bacterial etiological agent, if any. For the detection of fungal aetiology, the slides are immersed in 20 % KOH followed by fluorescence microscopy using the Uvitec, Blankophor or calcofluor white. However, the fluorescence microscopy cannot differentiate between the fungal genera.\nIsolation and identification: Media and incubation condition as described earlier will serve the purpose.\nHistopathology: The grains can be identified in haematoxylin and eosin (H&E)-stained tissue sections. Gram\u2013Weigert stain can be used to detect bacterial mycetoma and periodic acid\u2013Schiff (PAS) and Gomori methenamine silver, and Gridley stains are used to detect hyphae and fungal spores in eumycetoma. The grains have differentiating characteristics in the tissue section which creates an idea regarding the aetiology. For example, the black grains of Trematosphaeria grisea (M. grisea) have a non-pigmented centre and dark-coloured periphery with brown cementing substances. Further, the tissue reaction is also suggestive for the fungal aetiology. The grains are surrounded by neutrophils in M. mycetomatis infections and by eosinophils in P. boydii infections. However, most of the fungi-causing eumycetoma cannot be differentiated by histopathology. For example, the fungal species such as Scedosporium, Aspergillus and Fusarium produce hyaline hyphae with septation at regular intervals and dichotomous branching. Sometimes Scedosporium produce terminal or intercalary chlamydospores which are confused with the yeasts.\nSerological tests: Indirect haemagglutination assay (IHA) and immunodiffusion test (ID) are developed for the detection of Pseudallescheria boydii. For the detection of M. mycetomatis antibodies in human, immunodiffusion and counter immune electrophoresis (CIE) are widely used. Sometimes, ID tests produce false-negative reaction especially during the early phase of the infection and when the treatment is ongoing. The CIE is found to be superior than ID for better sensitivity. ELISA is also used for the detection of antibodies. Previously the ultrasonicated mycelial extract (cytoplasmic protein) was used as antigen in serological tests which produce variable results and cross-reaction with other fungi. The use of recombinant antigens [fructose-bisphosphate aldolase (FBA) and pyruvate kinase (PK)] in ELISA produces promising result for detection of M. mycetomatis antibodies.\nMolecular biology: The PCR is developed for the detection of M. mycetomatis and Pseudallescheria boydii using the primer for internal-transcribed spacer (ITS) located between 18S and 28S genes and beta-tubulin (BT2) genes, respectively. Rolling circle amplification (RCA) technique is used to detect P. boydii which is based on the amplification of the ITS region with pan-fungal primers. The loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP) method is also developed for the confirmation of P. boydii which do not require sophisticated instruments and is suitable for endemic zones of developing countries.\n",

The ideal clinical specimens for culture are kunkers, tissue biopsies. The samples are washed thrice with the sterile saline solution before culture and are cut into 5\u201310 mm blocks. The tissue blocks are impregnated directly into the agar plates.\nHistopathology: The histological sections are stained with H&E, Gomori methenamine sliver (GMS) and periodic acid\u2013Schiff (PAS). However, the hyphae are clearly visible only with GMS stain. Affected tissues contain multiple foci of necrosis surrounded by neutrophils, eosinophils and macrophages. The granulomas are composed of macrophages, plasma cells, multinucleate giant cells and fewer neutrophils and eosinophils. The fungi are found within necrotic area or at the centre of granulomas.\nSerological tests: In the laboratory, different serological tests such as immunodiffusion, ELISA, immunochromatographic assay and Western blot are developed for the detection of anti-P. insidiosum antibodies. Immunodiffusion test is however unable to detect the antibodies in dogs, whereas ELISA shows potential in early detection of postoperative recurrence. A simple and reliable haemagglutination test is also developed in which agglutination of sheep red blood cells coated with a P. insidiosum extract is possible using the serum samples of the patients.The immunohistochemical techniques include immunofluorescence and immunoperoxidase staining which can be used in paraffin-embedded fixed tissues.\nMolecular biology: The P. insidiosum-specific PCR is developed using the internal-transcribed spacer (ITS) of rRNA gene as a target. The PCR is successfully applicable for the confirmation of DNA extracted from the culture, fixed tissues and clinical specimens if preserved properly either at \u221270 \u00b0C or at ambient temperature with 95 % ethanol. Recently a nested PCR is also successfully employed for the detection of P. insidiosum from paraffin-embedded tissues.\n",

Naturally occurring P. carinii infection is also reported from piglets, goats, dogs, cats and nonhuman primates. In goats, P. carinii infection was associated with Mycobacterium avium subsp. paratuberculosis.",

The natural antibodies help in recognition of fungi by dendritic cells and enhance dendritic cell maturation and migration into the draining lymph nodes. The natural antibodies also help in the development of anti-Pneumocystis-adaptive immunity containing both humoural and cellular responses. The anti-Pneumocystis humoural immunity plays a major role in protection. The passive transfer of hyperimmune antiserum or monoclonal antibodies conferred protection in experimentally infected mice. As a component of cellular immunity, optimum level of CD4+ T cells (Th1, Th2, Th17) along with functional co-stimulatory molecules (CD2, CD28) is associated with the control of Pneumocystis infection. The level of Th2 was detected to be maximum during experimental infection. The natural IgM is required for the development of Th2 response, Th17 cell differentiation and immunoglobulin class switching, whereas CD8+ T cells offer a partial protection only.

The sequencing of L. loboi gp43 revealed its higher degree of nucleotide similarity (85 %) with P. brasiliensis gp43 and comparatively lower similarity (75 %) in amino acid level. Probably the high degree of nucleotide similarity occurs due to lack of known sexual reproduction and contact with its natural habitat for prolonged period (40\u201350 years) which helps to retain the original nucleotide motif in L. loboi genome. Further genomic study revealed about the loss of certain nucleotides (reductive evolution) which was earlier observed in other uncultivated, host-restricted pathogens such as Mycobacterium leprae, Rickettsia prowazekii and Buchnera.
