            "text": "That the weather impacts on our daily lives is a known fact. Rainy and inclement days increase the likelihoods of traffic incidents and delays (Karlaftis and Yannis 2010). Extreme hot and cold weather not only incur more energy needs (Wang et al. 2010) but also induce acute health situations (Leung et al. 2008; Kjellstrom et al. 2010). Severe weather events such as hurricanes, tornadoes, and tropical cyclones often demand special rescue and emergency operations (Williamson et al. 2002). Weather forecast data have been used effectively in decision-making to plan road maintenance works, prepare for road clearing on snowy days, and estimate resources required to respond to power outages in bad weather conditions. It has been claimed that \u201cat a cost of US $4 billion annually in the United States, weather is responsible for about two-thirds of aviation delays\u2014$1.7 billion of which would be avoidable with better observations and forecasts\u201d (NOAA 2005). Because the accuracy of weather forecasting has improved with better tools (Shukla et al. 2010), the value of integrating weather information and systems into weather responsive transport management and emergency operations is irrefutable (Cluett et al. 2011; Williamson et al. 2002).",

Keatinge (2002) reported that cardiovascular (such as ischemic heart and cerebrovascular) diseases and respiratory illnesses gave rise to disproportionately higher mortality in winter. Rooney et al. (1998) and Liang et al. (2009) also found that extreme temperatures could exacerbate chronic illnesses. Locally in Hong Kong, Yan\u2019s (2000) study recorded a significant negative relationship between minimum temperature and mortality for the age group 65 years and above, as well as a significant positive association between cloud cover and mortality. Wong and Lai (2012) also confirmed the negative relationship between daily ambulance demand and daily average temperature up to 28 \u00b0C. Recently, the Hong Kong Observatory (HKO) cooperated with the Senior Citizen\u2019s Home Safety Association to explore the effects of air temperature on the usage of the Personal Emergency Link Service and those requiring subsequent hospitalization (Hong Kong Observatory 2007). Their initial findings suggested that the number of hospitalized users was inversely proportional to temperatures below 23 \u00b0C and 10 % higher at 12 \u00b0C compared to that at 23 \u00b0C. The above discussions clearly imply an association between weather conditions and ambulance demand, with the association being more pronounced among the elderly.",

            "text": "The Fire Services Department (FSD) manages emergency ambulance services in Hong Kong while the Hospital Authority and some voluntary organizations shoulder non-emergency ambulance calls. A steady increase in the number of ambulance calls (both emergency and non-emergency) has been observed since 1998 (Table 1). The FSD reportedly handled more than 687,133 ambulance calls in 2010, which reflected a 17.5 % increase from 2005 and a 48 % increase from 1998 (Fire Services Department 2011). During the same period, the total population increased by 4.1 % and 8 %, respectively, in 2005 and 2010 compared with that of 1998. The corresponding increases in the elderly (65+) population were 20.8 % in 2005 and 31.5 % in 2010. The FSD practices a logistic assignment of emergency vehicles that dispatches ambulances on the basis of \u201cnext-in-queue\u201d by assigning the nearest available ambulance to the scene regardless of which district the ambulance belongs to. It also implements staggered shifts and a move-up system to further improve service and response times by deploying ambulances from nearby clusters to stand by in a cluster whose ambulance resources have been fully utilized. A yearly rate of 8\u201311 % emergency move-ups of ambulances in 2006\u20132009 was needed to provide an adequate operational coverage (Fire Services Department 2011; Hong Kong Legislative Council 2005). In view of the rising demand for emergency ambulance services and limited resources, early knowledge of expected demand is instrumental in the strategic mobilization and deployment of ambulances.\n",

            "text": "The development of forecasting models for ambulance demand and health incidence made notable progress (Setzler et al. 2009) in the late 1990s. Baker and Fitzpatrick (1986) attempted separate forecasts on daily emergency and non-emergency ambulance demand using an exponential smoothing model developed originally by Winters (Saydam et al. 1986) and then combined the two into a single forecast through goal programming. Four months of data on daily ambulance demand from September to December 1982 were used to forecast daily demand in January and February of 1983. When comparing the mean square errors, the technique of goal programming seemed to outperform multiple linear regression models. Tandberg et al. (1998) employed different time series methods (based on moving averages, means with moving average smoothing, and autoregressive integrated moving averages) to estimate the hourly volumes of ambulance runs. Hourly ambulance statistics in 1994 were used to develop forecast models, and similar statistics in 1995 were used to test and validate the models. The results indicated that time series by \u201cmeans with moving average smoothing\u201d yielded the best performance, with 54.3 % of the variance explained. Liao et al. (2002) considered weather factors with the back-propagation neural network to predict daily ambulance runs. They employed daily ambulance records from 1996 to 1997 in model development and 1998 records in model validation. Their models based on time-series data were able to predict ambulance runs to within 6 % error on average. Channouf et al. (2007) compared the forecast accuracy of two time series models: (1) an autoregressive model based on ambulance data with trend effects of seasonality and special-day removed; and (2) a doubly seasonal ARIMA model with special-day effects included. Their models were derived using 36 months of data and validated based on data in the subsequent 14 months. The results suggested that the first model was better, with a smaller root mean square error (RMSE) at 13.91 and an insignificant average absolute percentage error (AAPE) of 5.72 %. A comprehensive review on ambulance demand forecasts can be found in Wargon (2009).",

Indeed, the general utility of time-series modeling by adequately trained non-specialists has contributed to its popularity (Allard 1998). In this paper, we have employed a series of linear time-series forecasting models that allow for the inclusion of predictor variables in estimating daily ambulance calls of Hong Kong. The predictive powers of various models are compared using the measure of root mean square error (RMSE). Here, the effectiveness of using HKO\u2019s 7-day weather forecast data to predict ambulance demand for the coming days is compared against that using retrospective and actual weather data. Because only forecast data are available before an event day, the practical utility of forecast meteorological data, which are not error-free, in predicting daily ambulance demand for the next few days can be evaluated.",

This 3-year period was chosen because there was neither infectious disease outbreak (e.g., SARS or H1N1 influenza) nor policy changes in emergency medical services (e.g., introduction of ambulance user-fee policy) to cause confounding biases in the study. Each anonymized record contains an arbitrary record number, date and ambulance brought-in indicators to yield essential daily statistics for the study. Having excluded walk-in patients by referencing against the ambulance brought-in indicator, 22 % of records (or over 1.3 million) remained in the model. Figure 1 shows a time-series plot of the daily ambulance cases (with 3-day smoothing) that reveals a pattern of random fluctuation with some periodicity showing comparatively more cases in the summer/hotter and winter/cooler months. We also took note of extreme values or outlier data (such as those on the first day of Chinese New Year when it is considered inappropriate to have hospital visits) that could not be explained by forecasting models. This special day with anomalous ambulance demand is excluded from our prediction model. In addition, a 0.7 % increase in the population from mid-2006 to mid-2009 and the change of age structure (Census and Statistics 2012) were considered negligible. We preferred not to make further artificial adjustment (e.g., normalization) on the data series to prevent undesirable artifacts, although the series had an increasing trend.\n",

The HKO produces weather forecast data by employing numerical weather prediction models based upon outputs from the combined Japan Meteorological Agency and European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts global models (Lam et al. 2005). Our study averaged the forecast maximum and minimum daily readings to represent the 7-day forecast values of daily average temperature and humidity. Only temperature and relative humidity were considered in our study, not only because their corresponding 7-day weather forecasts were available from the HKO through the Internet but also because these two variables have been shown to have a direct relationship with ambulance demand (Wong and Lai 2012; Yan 2000). The presence of confounders such as air pollutants was not considered due to unavailability of their corresponding forecast values.",

Besides, the modeling parameters (i.e., the values of p, d, and q) appear reliable as they fall within one order of magnitude.\n",

Our empirical findings showed that the benchmark ARIMA model a was outperformed by two ARIMA models b and b\u2019 making use of average temperature as a predictor. Firstly, the inclusion of actual average temperature as a predictor yielded the best results to inform the significance of this weather variable in enhancing forecasting accuracy. Secondly, substituting actual by forecast average temperature produced encouraging results because the latter was a credible reflection of the former. Finally, the combined use of both average temperature and average relative humidity in model c did not improve model performance further.",

We suspect that a straightforward addition of average relative humidity into the forecasting model was not able to expound the remaining variance in ambulance demand. To further explore the potential role of relative humidity in prediction, it may be necessary to consider an alternative and well-defined weather index such as the net effective temperature (NET) (Hentschel 1987). A weather index, along with more precise weather forecast data, could perhaps capture the underlying and intricate relationships between weather factors and ambulance demand.",

These demands for ambulance services are important in terms of resource implications. In principle, more inclusive data could be derived from call records of the FSD\u2014the managing authority of ambulance services. Another deficiency concerns the representativeness of average values of weather variables (i.e., temperature and relative humidity) computed from their corresponding maximum and minimum readings. It would be more ideal if official average readings of weather variables could be obtained from the HKO. Finally, although the ambulance demand forecast was improved by incorporating the temperature factor, we took note that not all ambulance demand was weather related. The model could be strengthened if different types of ambulance demand could be identified. Through differentiating ambulance demand by its different nature, specific models could be developed for various types of ambulance demand to derive more accurate overall forecasts. However, this suggestion was not tested in the study because essential identifiers were not available.",

Weather forecast data could be incorporated into the FGMS without additional cost by linking directly to the HKO website. The incorporation of weather forecast data is worthwhile because its inclusion will improve forecast accuracy to better gauge resource management and deployment of ambulance attendants. For example, if the HKO 7-day weather forecasts warned of declining average temperatures in the next week and the ambulance demand forecast system predicted an increasing demand for ambulance services, such information would alert the need for advanced planning and estimation of a sufficient number of ambulance attendants required for the occasion. Such forward planning would enhance employee communication and reduce the need for compensation payment due to cancellation of previously approved leaves.",

Medical care of na on-recurrent nature due to extreme weather conditions must not be neglected. In an emergency situation when lives are endangered, a 12-hour difference is important 1 day out but becomes less important the farther out the forecast is. Given that the present day FSD does not provide forecasts of daily ambulance demand, our forecasting model b\u2019 is helpful for the agency or the managing authority to know beforehand and be better prepared for the expected rise in the demand for emergency ambulances arising from changing weather conditions. Prior knowledge of service demand can facilitate vehicle logistics to assure that the needy can receive timely services.",
