Therefore, EDs need to prepare fast and effectively to address the challenge of walk-in patients who might transmit the virus SARS-CoV-2 without displaying severe symptoms themselves, to protect personnel and vulnerable patient groups who are typically present in the ED at any time like patients with immunosuppression, chronic disease and older age.",

If feasible, patients approaching the ED should be guided with signs to a separate room even before triage in order to prevent contact with other patients waiting for triage. (3) A set of measures and information needs to be prepared and made available for all potential patients. The recommendations for risk stratification of the diagnostic measures are very dynamic and change daily. Thus, flowcharts should be accessed online when needed rather than printed to avoid the circulation of outdated information. Initially, COVID-19 was considered similar to SARS with pathology mainly confined to the lower respiratory tract. This was supported by the first case series of n = 41 from China [1] . On 21 January 2020, the first case was identified in Germany. The first patient and other patients were infected by a Chinese colleague during a business contact 7 days before. The disease was benign and similar to common flu, including fever >39\u00b0C, respiratory symptoms and fatigue. At the time of presentation and positive testing using the RT-PCR method developed at Charit\u00e9 -University Medicine Berlin [2] , the patient had already recovered with no symptoms. This case and the small series detected later brought the cognition that COVID-19 may have a mild cause in the majority of cases and therefore challenges the protection as cases may be very similar to common flu and other mild upper respiratory tract infections. As of 2 March 2020, the source of the Italian outbreak could not be identified and therefore control was much more difficult. As Italian authorities were unable to track all contact persons, the consequence for Germany was, to declare geographic areas in Italy with substantial local transmission as areas of risk (Fig. 1) .",

The first case in our institution was detected in the routine testing of influenza negative swaps. Criteria for both groups and handling are summarized in the figure. The decision on admission or outpatient management is based on the clinical situation (severity of symptoms) and the surrounding (situation at home, compliance with hygiene advice). Hygiene measures basically include isolation [separate room for group 1, surgical face-mask for all (groups 1 and 2)] and protection of personnel [use of gloves, protective gown, goggles and class 2 or 3 filtering face-piece (FFP) respirators (FFP2 assessing a suspected case; FFP3 when performing aerosol-generating procedures] [3]. Currently, there is no consensus whether surgical face-masks are sufficient protection for none high risk patient assessment. For disinfection, normal standard liquids that are effective against viruses can be used.",
