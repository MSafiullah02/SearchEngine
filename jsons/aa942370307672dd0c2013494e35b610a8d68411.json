Discussion 112 In the work we identified a strong synergistic effect of the combination of 113 hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin. Hydroxychloroquine has been demonstrated in vitro to 114 inhibit replication of SARS-CoVs 1 and 2 (17;19). Concentrations of drugs for our study were 115 based on the known cytotoxicity of the drugs (50% of cytotoxicity, CC 50) and their effect on 116 microorganisms (50% inhibitory concentration, IC50). With Zika virus, azithromycin showed 117 activity with an IC 50 range from 2.1 to 5.1 \u03bcM depending on MOI (28) without notable 118 effect on EC 50 at high concentration (29). The observation of efficacy of azithromycin on 119 RNA viruses is probably shared by some other macrolides. Clarithromycin or the non 120 antibiotic macrolide EM900 were observed as effective on rhinovirus in vitro (35;36). In vivo 121 sulfate of hydroxychloroquine could be imply in the modulation of the immune 122 response by reducing pro-inflammatory cytokines and by modification of the lysosome 123 acidification procedure (37). Those aspects may play a keystone role in severe cases of 124 SARS-coronaviruses. Indeed, in mouse models from SARS-CoV pneumonia and lung 125 affections was associated with cytokines storm (38). In parallel azithromycin was known as 126 inhibit the viral replication of Zika virus in vitro (29). And in enlarge viral infection context, 127 azithromycin was associated to up-regulate interferons I and III (30). Concerning the respiratory syncytial virus, it was also shown that Macrolides reduce the acidity of the 129 lysosome and by the down-regulation of the ICAM-1 protein (36). So, in the SARS-E6 it was shown that for hydroxychloroquine, CC 50 is close to 250 \u03bcM 133 (249.50 \u03bcM), which is significantly above the concentrations we tested herein (19). Against 134 SARS-CoV 2, the IC 50 of hydroxychloroquine was determined to be 4.51, 4.06, 17.31, and 135 12.96 \u03bcM with various MOI of 0.01, 0.02, 0.2, and 0.8, respectively. 136 One of the main criticisms of previously published data was that drug concentrations for viral 137 inhibition used in vitro are difficult to translate clinically due to side effects that would occur 138 at those concentrations. The synergy between hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin that we 139 observed herein is at concentrations achieved in vivo and detected in serum (35) and 140 pulmonary tissues (36-37) respectively. Our data are thus in agreement with the clinical 141 efficacy of the combination of hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin observed by Gautret et 142 al. (33). They support the clinical use of this drug combination, especially at the early stage of 143 the COVID-19 infection before the patients develop respiratory distress syndrome with 144 associated cytokine storm and become less treatable by any antiviral treatment.
