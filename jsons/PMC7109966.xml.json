            "text": "In April 2009, influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 virus (pH1N1v) emerged in North and South America as human infections (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 2009) before it became established in pig populations worldwide, including in Norway (Hofshagen et al., 2009; Torremorell et al., 2012; Van Reeth et al., 2012). It was Norway's first influenza A virus infection in its pig population since the active national serosurveillance started in 1997 (Lium et al., 2014). A case control study (Grontvedt et al., 2013) revealed that the outbreak in pigs was likely caused by cross-species transmission from human to pigs. Although pH1N1v appeared highly contagious in na\u00efve pigs like other swine influenza viruses (SIV; Brookes et al., 2010; Er et al., 2014), the virus appeared to be of low virulence since infection manifested itself mostly in the subclinical form in na\u00efve Norwegian pig herds (Grontvedt et al., 2011; Lium et al., 2014). Despite the subclinical state, a longitudinal study at the Norwegian boar testing station (Er et al., 2014) showed that infected growing pigs had reduced feed efficiency because of a poorer feed conversion ratio. Consequently, infected pigs required additional feed and protracted production time compared to their uninfected counterparts. These findings, when considered at the batch level, are useful for economic analysis of a farm's profitability and for decision making with regard to disease control and biosecurity measures. However, to consider the sum total effects at the batch level, an understanding of factors that will vary the outcome is important for realistic estimations. It is therefore the aim of this paper to present a stochastic model for assessment of the production impact of pH1N1v infection in Norwegian pigs at the batch level. The stochastic model, based on a field observational study, will account for the variabilities and uncertainties that influence the individual impact of each pig for the summation at the batch level.",

The boar testing station (Wetten et al., 2012) had a capacity of testing 1,152 pigs in 16 separate rooms at the same time. Each room housed a cohort of 72 pigs grouped by breed (Landrace or Duroc) into 6 pens (14 m2 in size) of 12 pigs each. Weekly, the station received 72 growing pigs (12 to 14 wk old with a mean BW of 33 kg) from 46 breeding herds in Norway to monitor their growth performances until they reached a BW of 100 kg. Electronic feeding stations in all pig pens used FIRE (Feed Intake Recording Equipment, Osbourne Ltd., Newcastle, UK) to record daily feed intake and daily weight gain for each pig individually. Pigs fed 1 at a time ad libitum from 1 electronic feed dispenser in each pen on conventional concentrate containing 161 and 136 g digestible protein, 9.68 and 9.50 MJ net energy/kg, before and after 50-kg live weight, respectively, with 1 mo of mixing of the 2 feeds to facilitate the feed change. Blood samples for pH1N1v antibodies testing were routinely taken from pigs at the end of their stay at the boar testing station. Most of these pigs were at least 100 kg BW or more.",

Our observational data based on serology and PCR testing of nasal swabs taken from 375 pigs over a period of 4 mo revealed a steep spike in the epidemic curve near the beginning of the outbreak of pH1N1v infection, indicating a very contagious infection with a very short incubation period. This result was consistent with influenza A virus infections in a batch of immunologically naive pigs (Rose et al., 2013). One hundred and twenty-two pigs, or 63% of our 193 virus-positive pigs belonged to VIR 1. The remaining virus-positive pigs belonged to VIR 2 (n = 34, or 18%) and VIR 3 (n = 37, or 19%). Reflecting these 3 proportions of each of the pig infection points, ModelRisk fitted a discrete probability distribution for the pig's infection point to be ZTPoly(41563.8, 0.000027). This discrete probability distribution was input into our stochastic model to describe the infection dynamics of an infection such that when a virus enters a batch of susceptible pigs, the bulk (63%) of the pigs would infected within a short time (<d).",

Keeping pigs longer than necessary also requires additional costs for fuel, electricity, labor, etc., and can affect the number of fattening rounds in a year. Although many papers have stated that respiratory disease infection in pigs can reduce feed efficiency and lead to lower growth rates and hence delays in the pigs getting to market weight (Kothalawala et al., 2006; Van Alstine, 2012; Van Reeth et al., 2012), the negative impacts on growth performance have not been properly quantified and published. Conversely, by using stochastic models in our study, we have quantitatively estimated the impact of the newly emerged influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 virus infection on growth performance in pigs in terms of increased feed and protracted production time. The models accounted for the heterogeneities between pigs and between batches to predict the likely variation between herds in Norway. The production impact of a subclinical disease like influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 virus for a batch of 150 na\u00efve Norwegian pigs growing from 33 to 100 kg can be as much as 1.5 t of extra feed and 420 pig days of longer production time if most of the pigs are infected as older pigs during GF 3. This would occur if the batch transmission point was at GF 3, which explains why sensitivity analysis in Figs. 3 and 4 identified batch transmission point as an influential uncertainty. Overall, the upshot of protracted production time of infected pigs means that the number of possible cycles of fattening pigs would be reduced if farmers choose to keep their pigs until they reach the desired market weight. However, in all-in\u2013all-out operations like fattening pig herds, farmers do not have the option to keep pigs longer than the designated market day and must sell their pigs at lighter BW than desired to clear the farm for the next batch.",

It is highly possible that all pigs within a batch could eventually be infected in the worst-case scenario. This is also true for other SIV (H1N1, H1N2, and H3N2) currently circulating in most pig-producing countries, where all susceptible pigs in a herd are likely able to become infected and transmit the virus (Tellier, 2006, 2009; Torremorell et al., 2012). The sensitivity analysis of our stochastic models showed that reducing the final prevalence and keeping the proportion of pigs infected during GF 3 the smallest (or avoiding batch transmission point at GF 3) would have the greatest impact in reducing the negative effects of the infection.",

Although such environmental conditions may not vary much for fattening herds in Norway given that most, if not all, pigs are kept indoors under the Nordic conditions, they could be different in other pig production countries. Hence, it would be interesting for further studies to correlate the effect of housing and husbandry conditions on the final prevalence of this disease within a batch of pigs. Such studies could elucidate nonvaccine types of interventions such as altering the pig's environment with the aim of reducing the final prevalence of the infection or helping older pigs avoid infection. The ultimate goal is clearly to reduce the negative impact of the virus infection on production without resorting to vaccination.",

Norway is a rare exception in that it has ongoing active national serological surveillance for influenza A virus infection in its population of unvaccinated pigs. In the last 5 yr from 2010 to 2014, Norway's herd prevalence for influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 virus infection has stabilized in the range of 41% to 50%, thus indicating that the infection has established itself in the pig population. Even though infection would confer long-term active immunity to a pig that recovered from infection, the quick turnover of fattening pigs whose lifespan is less than 7 mo ensures that large populations of immunologically na\u00efve pigs are constantly produced, making the continuous propagation of influenza infection possible (Van Reeth et al., 2012). In addition, any maternal antibodies a fattening pig may have would decrease by the time the pig reaches 12 to 14 wk, or about 33 kg in BW (Loeffen et al., 2003), making them susceptible to infection. Hence, fattening pig herds in Norway constantly present themselves as susceptible for influenza virus infection and reduced growth performance from lower feed efficiency.",
