What we have seen in the last decade is the elevation of BEVS from research tool to an established manufacturing platform for production of novel biologic products.",

In nature, there are more than 500 different types of baculoviruses, all of which have a host range restricted to invertebrates [9]. In the laboratory and for manufacturing purposes, the most commonly used baculovirus is Autographa californica multiple\u2010capsid nuclear polyhedrosis virus (AcMNPV), a virus with a double\u2010stranded DNA genome of approximately 134 kb [10].

            "text": "To begin the BEVS process, a recombinant baculovirus is constructed comprising the desired gene(s) of interest (GOI) (Fig. 1). First, the GOI is cloned into a transfer plasmid, typically behind the strong polyhedrin or p10 promoter that can drive protein expression to high levels in insect cells [11, 12]; notably, these promoters are not very active in E. coli and, therefore, can be stable expression cassettes. The GOI is flanked by AcMNPV DNA, e.g. the polyhedrin promoter on one side and a portion of the essential gene ORF1629 on the other. Insect cells are then co\u2010transfected with a mixture of the transfer plasmid and parental AcMNPV DNA that has been linearized such that the parental polyhedrin gene and portion of ORF1629 are missing, rendering it non\u2010infectious [13]. The plasmid and parental DNA undergo homologous recombination to generate de novo recombinant baculoviruses. These baculoviruses are plated and individual plaques purified to isolate a single, pure plaque of recombinant baculovirus. This plaque is subsequently passaged through multiple rounds of insect cell infection to generate a high\u2010titer stock and establish a working virus bank (WVB) that can be utilized for protein production.",

            "text": "BEVS employs recombinant technology, giving researchers and product developers a level of control over the production process that is not possible with other techniques. A good example is found with vaccine manufacturing. Traditionally, vaccines are made by cultivating large volumes of the pathogen against which protection is desired to generate the \u201craw materials\u201d required for the product. This can be accomplished by infecting substrates such as embryonated chicken eggs or mammalian cells, both of which are used to manufacture the majority of the vaccines recommended for routine immunization [1, 17]. The pathogen is either weakened and administered live as a live attenuated vaccine, or is killed or inactivated with reagents such as formalin or heat prior to being formulated into vaccine. These methods yield safe and effective vaccines; however, important shortcomings have been observed. The first concerns specificity. For example, traditional influenza vaccine production involves virus propagation in eggs. As influenza viruses are RNA viruses, they have a tendency to mutate to optimize their growth [18]. Generally, the changes introduced into the virus sequence have little impact on vaccine efficacy. However, since the virus receptors for birds and mammals differ, these changes can be meaningful, and it has been documented that in some cases the changes have rendered egg\u2010based influenza vaccines ineffective [19]. The BEVS process does not involve pathogen growth and, therefore, avoids this complication. Rather than cultivate a pathogen to collect \u201craw materials\u201d, a recombinant baculovirus is constructed that codes for the antigen required for protection. Since accommodations for growth do not need to be made, the antigen can be an exact sequence match to the human pathogen. This has the potential to solve the ineffectiveness observed for some egg\u2010adapted vaccines as was described by Skowronski et al. (2014) [19]. Moreover, specific point mutations can be introduced to enhance features such as stability. For example, it has recently been reported that purified hemagglutinin protein, the protective antigen in influenza vaccines, appears unstable in the SRID potency assay due to cross\u2010linking of specific cysteine residues in the protein [20]. By mutating these cysteine residues to non\u2010thiol residues, it was possible to prevent cross\u2010linking and enhance stability [21].",

            "text": "A second shortcoming with traditional vaccine manufacturing is process length. Again, influenza serves as a good example. Influenza epidemics occur every year and annual influenza vaccination is recommended by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention [22]. In addition, pandemic outbreaks occur occasionally, the most recent of which was the 2009 H1N1 swine flu (A/California/07/2009) [23, 24]. Timeliness of vaccine manufacture is critical to ensure that adequate vaccine supply is available. Egg\u2010based influenza vaccine manufacturing takes on average about six months, as the process of creating a high\u2010producing, egg\u2010adapted seed virus is slow [17]. This means that manufacturing of seasonal influenza vaccines must begin the winter prior to an epidemic, before that season's strain prevalence is definitively known, to guarantee adequate supply, and this has resulted in seasons where the available influenza vaccines have not matched the circulating influenza strains [25, 26]. Moreover, the President's Council of Advisors on Science and Technology (PCAST) reported that pandemic influenza vaccine in 2009 was not readily available until after the pandemic peaked, a major concern for public health and safety (www.whitehouse.gov/sites/default/files/microsites/ostp/PCAST\u2010Influenza\u2010Vaccinology\u2010Report.pdf). PCAST identified recombinant technology and freedom from virus growth and egg adaptation as the solution to this problem. BEVS\u2010derived influenza vaccines do not require seed viruses and can be produced in as little as 45 days [5].",

            "text": "In addition to specificity and speed, recombinant technology offers advantages with respect to purity and product design. With respect to purity, recombinant products are free of pathogens, eggs and many chemicals (such as formalin and antibiotics) that can be undesirable or allergenic [27]. For product design, recombinant techniques make it possible to engineer proteins with desired features, such as fusion proteins that increase immunogenicity or include multiple antigens and truncated proteins with deleted domains to improve yields and ease purification [28, 29, 30, 31, 32]. One example of this application is the antigen used in Provenge immunotherapy. The antigen is a fusion glycoprotein consisting of prostatic acid phosphatase (PAP) linked to granulocyte\u2010macrophage colony\u2010stimulating factor (GM\u2010CSF) and is used to stimulate autologous antigen presenting cells [33]. The GM\u2010CSF activates the antigen presenting cells and enhances cell viability while the PAP serves as the target antigen. Another example is the Cervarix\u00ae vaccine manufactured by GlaxoSmithKline. The vaccine is a bivalent virus\u2010like particle (VLP) comprised of the human papillomavirus L1 proteins (strains 16 and 18). By expressing C\u2010terminally truncated L1 proteins, the manufacturers are able to prevent intracellular VLP self\u2010assembly, which would complicate purification. Instead, the L1 subunit proteins are purified to a high degree and VLP assembly is achieved in vitro [28].",

Baculoviruses have a narrow host range restricted to specific insects and are considered safe to use as biological pesticides with no negative impact on plants, mammals, birds, fish or non\u2010target insects [9]. People are exposed to baculoviruses daily by consuming fresh vegetables. For instance, a serving of coleslaw may contain hundreds of millions of baculoviruses [34]. Baculovirus vectors have also been explored as gene therapy vectors. These studies have demonstrated that baculoviruses cannot replicate in mammalian cells and cannot express a gene cassette unless it is driven by a mammalian promoter [9, 35, 36, 37, 38].",

            "text": "A major consideration for regulatory agencies when evaluating a novel cell substrate is the potential to harbor adventitious agents that could threaten patient safety. There are very few adventitious agents that can replicate in both insect and mammalian cells. A notable exception is arboviruses that can be transmitted to humans via insect bites and can cause complications such as encephalitis and hemorrhagic fever [39]. To mitigate this risk, cells from non\u2010biting insects such as the fall armyworm and cabbage looper have been used with BEVS as noted above. Nonetheless, adventitious agents have been detected in some insect cell lines. For instance, the Trichoplusia ni High Five cell line, BTI\u2010TN\u20105B1\u20104, used to make Cervarix\u00ae, was found to be latently infected with an Alphanodavirus that was induced by recombinant baculovirus infection [40]. In addition, other insect cell lines, such as those generated from Drosophila melanogaster, have been shown to harbor innate retroelements derived from retroviruses that could potentially be infectious [41]. More recently, a possible insect\u2010specific virus Sf\u2010rhabdovirus was identified in Spodoptera frugiperda cells [42]. Although studies showed that this virus could not enter or replicate in human cell lines and, therefore, is unlikely to be a risk, novel cell lines will most likely need to be characterized and monitored for the presence of this virus as they are for nodaviruses, retroviruses and others. In general, because adventitious agents are a potential threat, cell substrates of all origins (including insect and others) must be thoroughly tested for the presence and infectivity of such agents before they are allowed by regulatory agencies for manufacturing use.",

The first is that BEVS is a transient protein expression system; the recombinant baculoviruses used vary based on their foreign gene cassettes but a single cell line can be used for the expression of all proteins (Fig. 1). Qualifying a cell line is no small feat. It can take years of work to adequately ensure purity and safety in addition to high productivity. Stable cell lines have to be independently qualified each time their genetic composition changes [43]. In contrast, cell lines used with BEVS and other transient expression systems remain constant and, consequently, need to be qualified just once.",

Insect cells are grown in suspension, so if the cells and baculoviruses have been optimized for large scale and multiple passages, the culture size is only limited by the size of the bioreactor. For example, expresSF+ cells have been used to produce recombinant proteins at scales ranging from two to 21000 L [44]. The cost of goods for BEVS production is largely dependent on capital costs and yields. As discussed by Cox (2012), vast global bioreactor capacity (\u223c500000 L) already exists and presents the opportunity to minimize the investment needed to establish BEVS manufacturing facilities [1]. Moreover, opportunities for yield improvements are abundant and include genetic and fermentation\u2010based approaches; these are described elsewhere [1]. Unlike some other production facilities, BEVS facilities can be multi\u2010purpose and used to produce a variety of BEVS\u2010derived products, especially when disposable or single\u2010use technology is employed [45]. This is because a single cell line can be used for production of different products. This feature is especially meaningful for regions of the world where limited manufacturing capacity exists. A single BEVS facility could, for example, be used to produce vaccines for diseases endemic to a region and quickly be converted to produce pandemic influenza vaccine in an emergency. Finally, because the BEVS platform does not require the handling of live, potentially dangerous pathogens, requirements for biocontainment that can be very costly are reduced.",

For instance, small proteins that do not require post\u2010translational modifications are best made in E. coli that can quickly generate high yields at low cost [4]. Yeasts such as S. cerevisiae can also produce high yields of protein at low cost and are capable of some post\u2010translational modifications [4]. Insect cells are capable of many post\u2010translational modifications but proteins that require complex post\u2010translational modifications and folding may best be made in mammalian expression systems. For example, the glycosylation patterns produced by insect and mammalian cells are related, and glycoproteins produced in insect cells are often correctly folded, biologically active and immunogenic [46]. However, insect cells generate less complex N\u2010glycans than mammalian cells and this can negatively impact biological function [46, 47]. Some developments have been made to address this limitation, including engineering transgenic insect cell lines that stably express mammalian glycosylation enzymes or co\u2010expressing such enzymes with the gene of interest in a single baculovirus [48, 49, 50, 51]. Whether this is required must be assessed on a protein by protein basis.",

Treatments are actively being investigated in a diverse array of therapeutic areas and dozens of product candidates are in clinical development (summarized in Table 2). Hemophilia is one area where progress has been made (reviewed in [69]). There are four ongoing human clinical trials involving rAAV serotypes 8 or 2, all designed to express factor IX for the treatment of hemophilia B (Table 2). Factor VIII rAAV\u2010based therapy is a target for the treatment of hemophilia A, the most common severe inherited bleeding disorder, and only a modest increase in plasma factor VIII levels is expected to be required to be clinically relevant [69]. rAAV\u2010based treatments for retinal degeneration, including macular degeneration and Leber's congenital amaurosis type 2, are another area of intense investigation [70, 71]. Retinal treatments are ideal because of cell accessibility through intravitreal and subretinal injections and the ability to assess structure and function noninvasively. Serotype 2 is most commonly used for these therapies but types 2, 5, and 7\u20139 are all capable of infecting photoreceptors, the most prominent cell type for retinal degenerations [70]. Diseases of the central nervous system (CNS), such as Parkinson's and Alzheimer's diseases, are also actively being tested with rAAV\u2010based therapies that are promising. AAVs exhibit a strong preference for neuronal transduction, making them a popular gene delivery vehicle for CNS therapies but vector improvements are still needed to optimize treatments (discussed in [72]). Finally, Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) is a therapeutic target where progress is being made. Although the single gene affected in DMD (dystrophin) has long been known, its large size has made gene therapy a challenge. Recent treatment approaches to overcome this include exon\u2010skipping, trans\u2010splicing and micro\u2010and mini\u2010dystrophin delivery strategies [53, 73].",

Influenza vaccines are standardized to contain a specific amount of HA, the major surface glycoprotein on the influenza virus [17]. BEVS\u2010derived recombinant HA forms trimers that in turn oligomerize into immunogenic rosettes [75]. These proteins can be purified to high levels resulting in a vaccine that has been shown to be safe and effective in clinical studies [5, 76, 77, 78, 79].",

A monovalent variation of the Flublok\u00ae vaccine called Panblok\u00ae has been developed. In a Phase II study of H5 Panblok\u00ae (A/Indonesia/5/05), a two\u2010dose schedule of vaccine at doses of 3.8\u201345 \u03bcg HA formulated with the adjuvant glucopyranosyl lipid A/stable emulsion (GLA/SE) had an acceptable safety and reactogenicity profile and elicited serologic responses meeting seroconversion criteria in adults 18\u201349 years old [82]. Moreover, an earlier study showed that people administered H5 Panblok\u00ae (A/Hong Kong/156/1997) in 1998 were primed for an enhanced immune response following administration of an antigenically variant vaccine strain in 2006 [83]. Liu et al. (2013) evaluated a different BEVS\u2010derived H5 subunit vaccine candidate (A/goose/Guangdong/1/96) and showed that it protected against a lethal challenge in BALB/c mice and in specific pathogen\u2010free and commercial chickens, suggesting it could be useful as both a human and animal vaccine [84].",

Evaluation of an H5N1 (A/Indonesia/5/05) VLP vaccine in a Phase I/II study of adults 18\u201340 years old showed that two doses of unadjuvanted vaccine at 15, 45 or 90 \u03bcg HA/dose were generally well\u2010tolerated and resulted in seroconversion [85]. Similarly, a Phase II study of an H1N1 (A/California/04/2009) VLP vaccine in adults 18\u201364 years old showed it was safe at doses of 5, 15 or 45 \u03bcg HA/dose and elicited high rates of seroprotection (82\u201392%) [86]. More recently, an H7N9 VLP vaccine was developed that was comprised of HA and NA proteins matched to A/Anhui/1/2013 (H7N9) and M1 protein matched to A/Indonesia/05/2005 (H5N1) [87]. This vaccine candidate was tested with or without saponin\u2010based ISCOMATRIX adjuvant in BALB/c mice and was shown to protect against a lethal challenge. Antibodies against both HA and NA were elicited, with 3\u2010 to 4\u2010fold higher responses in the ISCOMATRIX groups. Although the data are promising, a challenge for the development of multi\u2010component VLP vaccines will be standardizing the vaccines for each of their components (e.g., quantity of HA vs. NA vs. M1).",

Besides inclusion in VLPs, recombinant NA can be individually produced via BEVS and may serve as a potentially efficacy\u2010enhancing additive to influenza vaccines [89].

Success with this approach has been demonstrated for influenza and can be applied to broader areas. For example, coronaviruses have been plaguing both people and animals especially in the last decade with lethal outbreaks of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) in 2003, Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) in late 2012, and porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV) in 2013 [93, 94, 95]. All coronaviruses share a similar structure that includes the presence of the spike glycoprotein on the viral envelope that is the dominant immunogen [96, 97, 98]. Multiple coronavirus BEVS\u2010derived vaccine candidates have been developed that include recombinant spike protein either alone as a subunit vaccine or together with recombinant envelope and membrane proteins as VLPs and have demonstrated efficacy in animal models [29, 99, 100, 101, 102, 103, 104, 105, 106, 107]. The spike protein has been shown to be immunogenic both as full length protein and as a truncated protein containing only the extracellular domain [29, 100], and multiple routes of vaccine administration have been examined [104].",
