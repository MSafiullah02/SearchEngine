All three are examined cross-nationally and across states of the USA. Also collectivism\u2013individualism and philopatry are investigated across indigenous societies in the ethnographic record. Then we deal with the topic of family organization across species in relation to parasite stress. We discuss also reciprocal altruism of people and human-specific cognitive ability in relation to the parasite-stress theory. In this chapter, too, we address the ecological fallacy as well as some misconceptions about the scientific validity of the comparative method.",

Given that many specific customs and norms\u2014such as those pertaining to food preparation (Sherman and Billing 1999) and hygiene\u2014can serve as defenses against pathogen transmission, deviation from the customary status quo may pose a contagion risk to self and others, whereas conformity helps to maintain the integrity and effectiveness of these defenses against infectious disease. In sum, the behaviors arising from collectivist values (compared with the behaviors of individualism) are more likely to provide defenses against infectious diseases.",

For instance, consider the individualistic values of independent self, intellectual autonomy, and openness to new social contacts and new experiences in general discussed in the previous chapter. Both the discovery and the spread of beneficial new ideas and technologies will occur more frequently when individuals are encouraged to think independently, deviate from existing traditions, and engage in interactions with out-group people. In geographical regions characterized by relatively low parasite stress, the benefits of collectivism (in terms of antiparasite defense) will be minimal, compared with the benefits associated with individualism. Under these ecological circumstances, individualistic values are more optimal or socially effective. However, within geographical regions characterized by a greater prevalence of parasites, the benefits of collectivism to individuals also will be greater, and outweigh benefits conferred by individualistic values. Under these circumstances, collectivistic values are likely to have more utility in terms of individual\u2019s inclusive fitness.",

Specifically, our colleagues and we hypothesized that countries with low parasite stress will be individualistic, and that countries with high parasite stress will be collectivistic. Prior to our study, it had been shown that equatorial countries are more collectivistic than societies at higher latitudes (Hofstede 2001). This was consistent with our hypothesis because infectious diseases are more prevalent in equatorial regions (e.g., Guernier et al. 2004). Our hypothesis was tested directly first in the paper by Fincher et al. (2008). We discuss that study next.",

Kashima and Kashima (1998) studied the phenomenon of pronoun-drop across nations (71 countries and 39 languages). Pronoun-drop was defined as the acceptable dropping of first- and second-person pronouns from the dominant language. They demonstrated that pronoun-drop was found primarily in collectivist cultures, while the persistent use of the pronouns was found in individualist cultures. The correlation between first-person pronoun use and Hofstede Individualism across cultures was 0.75 (p < 0.01). Kashima and Kashima (1998) argued that the dropping of first-person pronouns is predominant in collectivist cultures, because in such cultures the individual is de-emphasized (e.g., the de-emphasis of \u201cI\u201d) to such an extent that the personal self is unimportant relative to the in-group or collective (see also Chap. 10.1007/978-3-319-08040-6_4). Pronoun-drop, then, provides an independent measure of collectivism\u2013individualism among cultures, and one based on linguistic norms. We recoded their data such that pronoun-drop cultures scored a 1; those that used first-person pronouns were scored a 0. We refer to this scale as Kashima Collectivism.",

(Murray and Schaller later updated this measure to include more of the world\u2019s countries (Murray and Schaller 2010). Throughout the book, when we analyze Historical Parasite Severity, we are referring to our earlier measure based on 93 countries.) The severity of the nine parasites was estimated on the basis of old atlases of infectious diseases and other historical epidemiological information dating back to the early 1900s. The severity estimates (coded on either three- or four-point scales) were standardized (transformed into z-scores), and the mean of these nine standardized scores served as the estimate of the historical severity of pathogens in each country (for details, see Fincher et al. 2008). The validity of this measure is shown for example by its very high correlation with an index of similar parasites used by Gangestad and Buss (1993) to assess historical parasite severity within a small sample of countries (see Fincher et al. 2008). Their index was based on one derived independently by Low (1990, 1994) from historical records of parasite severity from disease atlases extending back to the early 1900s.",

First, it is highly correlated with an index mentioned earlier of similar parasites used by Gangestad and Buss (1993) to assess historical parasite severity within a sample of countries. Second, our index also shows a high correlation with a separate measure of contemporary parasite severity known as DALY (Disability Adjusted Life Years). DALY is a measure of morbidity and mortality across the globe from many sources, as reported by the World Health Organization (WHO). We used the DALY for infectious diseases per 100,000 population, as reported by WHO for the year 2002 (WHO 2004). This DALY combines into one measure the time lived with disability and the time lost due to premature mortality; one DALY equals one lost year of healthy life and the associated burden of infectious disease. It is a measurement of the gap between current health status and an ideal situation where everyone lives into old age free of infectious disease and disability from contagious agents (www.who.int). For the 192 countries for which we had data on both this DALY corrected for population size (ln transformed due to skew) and our contemporary parasite-severity index, the correlation is high: r = 0.74, p < 0.0001. Hence, our contemporary parasite severity index correlates highly with historical and contemporary parasite stress as measured by others. Infectious Disease DALY is our label throughout the book for the DALY for infectious diseases corrected for population size and log transformed.",

(2008), we assessed the relation between Historical Parasite Severity and collectivism\u2013individualism while statistically controlling for other variables that earlier published research mentioned as possible causes of collectivism\u2013individualism. Four additional variables were assessed: Gross Domestic Product (GDP) per capita (a measure of wealth of the average person in a country), Gini (the wealth disparity among the people of a country), population density, and residual life expectancy. High values of GDP per capita and of Gini mean high average wealth per person and high wealth disparity among people, respectively. Residual life expectancy means the deviations from the general statistically fitted regression line when life expectancy of both sexes combined is regressed on Historical Parasite Severity. This residual is the variation in life expectancy not accounted for by Historical Parasite Severity. Of the four additional variables, only GDP per capita and Gini were correlated reliably with collectivism\u2013individualism. Residual life expectancy correlated significantly with only one of the four collectivism\u2013individualism measures, and population density failed to correlate significantly with any of the four measures. By contrast, GDP per capita and Gini were substantially and significantly correlated with all four individualism\u2013collectivism measures (all p\u2019s < 0.05). Consequently, we conducted four multiple regression analyses, in which Historical Parasite Severity, GDP per capita and Gini were entered simultaneously as predictors of each of the four individualism\u2013collectivism measures. An identical pattern of results emerged across all four analyses. There were no unique effects of Gini (all p\u2019s > 0.05). By contrast, GDP per capita did exert unique predictive effects (all p\u2019s < 0.05); greater GDP per capita was associated with greater individualism and less collectivism. Of primary interest, parasite severity also uniquely predicted all four measures of individualism\u2013collectivism (all p\u2019s < 0.05). Thus, while other variables (like economic development) also may predict cultural differences in collectivism\u2013individualism, these other variables cannot account for the predictive effects of pathogen severity (also see Chap. 10.1007/978-3-319-08040-6_11 on economics and parasite adversity).",

Regardless of whether the world is divided up according to Murdock\u2019s (1949) six world regions, or Gupta and Hanges\u2019 (2004) ten cultural regions of the world, composite scores on pathogen severity correlated negatively with composite scores on individualism, and positively with composite scores on collectivism. These correlations were very strong in some cases. For example, when Murdock\u2019s six world regions were used in analysis, the correlation between Historical Parasite Severity and the Gelfand et al. collectivism measure was 0.93 (p = 0.004, n = 6); and when Gupta and Hanges\u2019 (2004) ten cultural regions were used in analysis, the correlation was 0.80 (p = 0.003, n = 10). Hence, the variation in the two key variables of parasite stress and collectivism within world or cultural regions is consistent with the same pattern worldwide.

The size of this effect was substantial and remained significant even when controlling statistically for potential confounding variables. The effect also remained strong when broader cultural regions (rather than individual countries) were used in analysis. These findings are consistent with the hypothesis that individualism confers benefits upon individuals, but the behaviors that define individualism also enhance the likelihood of pathogen transmission, and thus are maladaptive under ecological conditions in which pathogens are highly prevalent. In contrast, the behaviors of collectivism function in antipathogen defense, and thus are adaptive under conditions of high pathogen prevalence.",

Even the apparently unique effect of GDP per capita may indirectly reflect some causal role of pathogens, given that infectious diseases are potent inhibitors of economic development (Chap. 10.1007/978-3-319-08040-6_11).

This classification has 154 diseases as zoonotic (e.g., rabies, hantavirus), 40 diseases as multihost (e.g., leishmaniasis, Chagas disease, Dengue fever), and 117 diseases as human-specific (e.g., measles, cholera, filariasis). For each country, we computed separately the sums of all zoonotic diseases, multihost diseases, and human-specific diseases that GIDEON listed as having a presence within that country. These three sums represented three distinct indices of Disease Richness. Across all countries combined, the mean parasite richness scores were as follows: zoonotic: mean (M) \u00b1 standard deviation = 53.92 \u00b1 10.40 (range = 38\u201387); multihost: M \u00b1 SD = 23.59 \u00b1 2.81 (range = 20\u201332); human-specific: M \u00b1 SD = 102.33 \u00b1 2.96 (range = 98\u2013110). In Thornhill et al. (2010) we did not publish the data for the numbers of the three disease categories per country; these are given in this chapter\u2019s Appendix 1, and the methods used in distinguishing the three disease categories are described in Thornhill et al. (2010).",

To address these limitations, Thornhill et al. (2010) used data bearing on more than 300 different human infectious diseases, computed separate indices assessing the prevalence of three functionally distinct categories of these diseases (human-specific, multihost, zoonotic), and examined the extent to which each index uniquely predicted cross-national differences in societal values.

These findings conform to the functional logic of the parasite-stress model, because collectivism\u2013individualism has consequences for a broad range of behaviors, including behaviors with implications for interpersonal contact (e.g., approach versus avoidance of unfamiliar peoples), as well as behaviors with implications for interspecies transmission of pathogens (e.g., violation versus conformity to cultural norms pertaining to hygiene).",

Compared to the effects of nonzoonotic parasite richness, any effects associated with zoonotic parasite richness were negligible. Before conclusively ruling out an important contribution of zoonotic parasites to these worldwide values, it is critical to consider an alternative explanation, based on differential measurement error. It is possible that epidemiologists and health agencies are especially attentive to diseases that are transmitted from human to human, whereas the presence of human zoonotic parasites may be relatively poorly recorded. If so, then simply for reasons of differential measurement error, zoonotic parasite richness would be expected to correlate less strongly than nonzoonotics with any outcome variable. The plausibility of this alternative explanation is undermined by evidence that many zoonotic diseases are monitored by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and other relevant agencies worldwide as zoonotics are thought to be an important source of emerging human infectious diseases (Greger 2007; Jones et al. 2008). Some zoonotics, however, may escape surveillance by these agencies (e.g., Maudlin, Eisler and Welburn 2009). One way to address this alternative explanation empirically is to show that the zoonotic parasite-richness index is measured with sufficient fidelity to predict additional outcome variables to which it is conceptually related\u2014such as the presence of livestock within a country. Many zoonotic diseases are contracted from livestock, and so we should observe an especially strong relationship between livestock and zoonotic parasite richness\u2014but only if the index of zoonotic parasite richness is measured with a high degree of validity.",

(Also see Thornhill and Palmer (2000) for a related response to certain secularist critics of evolutionary theory as applied to human behavior.) So, to say that correlational data do not count or are less convincing than data generated from experimentation is to misunderstand fundamentally scientific methodology and evidence; the findings from experiments are just as correlational as those from statistical analysis called correlational or regression analysis. In all cases, the scientific value of a finding\u2014its ability to address causation\u2014depends solely upon the control of confounders, not the type of method itself.

The researcher grows hibiscus under three different levels of potassium supplementation to the soil. The same basic soil is used in each of three treatments of ten plants per treatment, and all plants have the same watering schedule and genetic background. The researcher\u2019s hypothesis will be supported if the data show that the average hibiscus growth across treatments corresponds positively to the amount of experimentally added potassium; that is, by data of a positive correlation between the level of potassium and hibiscus growth. In this case, the actual analysis used to see if the correlation is present is not a statistical correlation analysis per se, but the test is indeed for a corelationship between variables. Note that if the experimenter uses only two treatments and tests the hypothesis with a t-test for a difference in average growth between treatments, the procedure is still directed at establishing whether the predicted corelationship exists between the two variables, potassium level and plant growth. Statistics, whether t-statistics, correlation coefficients, or other statistics are interchangeable because they are all for determining if there is a correlation between variables. Note, too, that this experiment is based on comparative data, comparing plant growth under different levels of a nutrient. All scientific results are fundamentally both correlational and comparative.",

Critics would point to the potential confounds unaddressed; they cannot accept the results as proof of causation, because another factor (potential confound) may be responsible for the correlation of the two variables. For example, it may be that a fungal parasite of hibiscus was present in part of the greenhouse, but not in other parts. Presumably, hibiscus has hundreds of types of parasites, so there is much room for potential confounds, just in the domain of parasites alone. Or perhaps there was a slight, but significant lighting or temperature or humidity variation across parts of the greenhouse, and so on. This example illustrates the general rule in interpreting scientific results, all of which are correlational: the confidence one can have in a study\u2019s finding depends entirely upon the ability of the procedure used to control potential confounds. Hence, this confidence is independent entirely of what kind of test method is conducted (experimentation, observations, or a study employing the comparative method).",

Of course, this is a correct point. As discussed earlier in this chapter, it is the reason we used control procedures in our cross-national analysis, which allowed us to conclude that parasite stress significantly and positively predicts collectivism when various potential confounds are controlled (Fincher et al. 2008, and see earlier). And this is why we also draw on many lines of evidence to evaluate hypotheses. For example, our predictions about collectivism and parasite stress at the cultural level are bolstered by findings of studies of individuals and their xenophobic attitudes in relation to pathogen sensitivity (Faulkner et al. 2004).",

This is used commonly also, for example, in field experimentation in biological research to randomize the locations of treatment replicates in order to control site effects.

In comparative studies, the kind and diversity of comparison groups allow randomization of the influence of many potential confounders on an effect of interest (Alexander 1978). The parasite-stress theory of values predicts a positive correlation between the degree of collectivism and the degree of parasite stress. In our cross-national analyses, parasite stress corresponds to the \u201ctreatment\u201d variable. Consider nations with high parasite stress: They vary in many ways such as language, religion, cooking and clothing styles, diet, subsistence type, social and other ecological features, and so on. The same can be said for nations with low parasite stress. Indeed, at any point across the treatment variable there is much variation in many cultural traits. Thus, across the comparisons of values systems in different countries, many potential confounds are randomized with regard to the treatment variable of degree of parasite adversity.",

Say the researcher obtains data that show that, within a uniform geographical region, high-potassium-soil locations contain hibiscus plants that grow faster than those in low-potassium-soil locations, which provides evidence that the lab results have meaning in nature. Relevant here, also, would be a field experiment in which potassium levels are manipulated by the researcher in a more natural ecological setting than the lab. It is nature, after all, that science is charged with discovering; unnatural or laboratory results are supportive of a hypothesis about nature only when they are shown to address the natural environment.

Also, a range of studies has documented the association between individual-level values and individual-level strength of the behavioral immune response. Clay et al.

Inbar et al. (2012) and Terrizzi et al. (2013) reported this same association, but with conservatism rather than collectivism. This association is an assumption in the cross-cultural research that shows the positive relationship between collectivism and parasite stress. Hence, evidence indicates that it is actually the case that individuals with high pathogen-related disgust and cognitions of contagion concern are more collectivist/conservative, whereas people with low disgust and contagion concern are more individualistic/liberal.

Our new data came from the 1981\u20132007 pooled dataset of the World Values Survey (www.worldvaluessurvey.org) for the following five items: (1) how important is family in your life? (We used the proportion of those who chose \u201cvery important.\u201d); (2) the respondent had to endorse one of two statements: (a) regardless of what the qualities and faults of one\u2019s parents are, one must always love and respect them, (b) one does not have the duty to respect and love parents who have not earned it [we used the proportion of those who chose \u201ca\u201d]; (3) the respondent was asked to endorse one of two statements: (a) it is the parents\u2019 duty to do their best for their children, even at the expense of their own well-being, (b) parents have a life of their own and should not be asked to sacrifice their own well-being for the sake of their children [we used the proportion of participants that chose \u201ca\u201d]; (4) respondents were asked whether they lived with their parents [we used the proportion who indicated they did live with their parents]; (5) respondents were asked about their goals in life [we used the proportion of respondents who said one of their goals in life was to make their parents proud]. All proportions were arcsine-square-root transformed and then standardized prior to analysis. All five items were highly interrelated (Cronbach\u2019s \u03b1 = 0.86, n = 72 countries). All five components were summed to become our measure, Strength of Family Ties. Larger values indicate stronger family ties, while smaller values indicate weaker family ties.

As explained earlier, an important element of the parasite-stress theory is the costs associated with acquiring diseases from out-group humans. Thus, infectious diseases that are transmissible between humans are predicted to be more important in evoking collectivism than human infectious diseases that are not transmitted between humans. We summed the number of cases of human-specific and multihost infectious diseases per country (called nonzoonotic) and the number of cases of zoonotic diseases, based on data from GIDEON for each disease\u2019s severity in each country (see Sect. 5.4). This provided measures of parasite severity for the two disease categories. Nonzoonotic disease was correlated positively with zoonotic disease (r = 0.61, p < 0.0001, n = 226). Nonzoonotic disease was correlated positively with Infectious Disease DALY (r = 0.76, p < 0.0001, n = 192).

It combines GDP per capita, percentages of university students and literates, the degree to which land ownership is widespread, and the degree of decentralization of nonagricultural economic resources in a single value. We called this variable Resource Distribution. Too, we examined the effects of human freedom (e.g., the freedoms of expression and belief) using the average of cross-national scores of civil liberties from Freedom House for the years 1972\u20132008 (www.freedomhouse.org). This became our variable Civil Liberty. In our regression analyses, we used two model specifications. The most general model contained Combined Parasite Stress, Civil Liberty, and Resource Distribution as the predictor variables of Strength of Family Ties. Resource Distribution includes GDP per capita; however, because of the large amount of cross-cultural research that focuses on GDP per capita, we tested a second model that used GDP per capita and Combined Parasite Stress as the predictor variables.

Then, we conducted correlations using the mean values for each of the variables for each world region. This six-world-region approach allowed us to characterize a region comprised of multiple countries into a single value (thus deflating sample size). The small sample size of six makes the p-values unreliable, but it does allow us to test whether the correlations remain in the predicted direction after reducing the sample size. We also conducted a nested-effect linear regression model that accounts for the nested design of our analysis. In the cross-national case, Combined Parasite Stress was nested within each world region as the independent variable and used to predict the Strength of Family Ties. Our findings are repeated in the world regions. At the world region level, Combined Parasite Stress and Strength of Family Ties correlated highly and positively, and thus in the predicted direction (r = 0.94, n = 6). Also, the Strength of Family Ties was predicted significantly by Combined Parasite Stress when nested within world region (r\n2 = 0.47, p < 0.0001, n = 69).

For each year, we adjusted the number of cases of all infectious diseases tracked by the CDC for that year by the CDC-reported population size for each state. We only included infectious diseases that the CDC had information on from each state. Thus, some diseases that were unreported in some states (meaning that, for some states, there was no information on the disease\u2019s presence or absence, not just that there were zero cases reported) were not included in the index. For each state, we determined the average z-score of this population adjusted disease incidence score for all years. This approach was necessary because the infectious diseases tracked by the CDC can vary between years, though there was often great similarity between years. The standardization allowed us to pinpoint a state\u2019s position along a parasite gradient relative to the other states. This index of parasite severity, Parasite Stress USA, is ecologically validated by the fact that it shows a negative correlation with latitude (\u22120.45, n = 50, p = 0.001; or after removing the latitudinal outliers Alaska and Hawaii, \u22120.71, n = 48, p < 0.0001), as do global measures of parasite stress (Cashdan 2001a; Guernier et al. 2004). Further ecological validation is demonstrated by the negative correlation of Parasite Stress USA with the average lifespan expectancy at birth for both sexes in the year 2000 (data collected from www.census.gov): r = \u22120.67, p < 0.0001, n = 50). (A similar pattern between infectious disease stress and lifespan expectancy is found in cross-national analyses; see Chap. 10.1007/978-3-319-08040-6_8). The list of diseases across years that comprise Parasite Stress USA as well as the actual values of the variable for each state is in the supplementary materials published with Fincher and Thornhill (2012).",

GDP per capita is an average of the values for years 1999\u20132007 obtained from the Bureau of Economic Analysis (http://www.bea.gov). Gini was measured at the family level for 1999, the last year available at the time for the variable at the US Census Bureau (http://www.census.gov). Of the two potentially confounding variables, only Gini correlated significantly with Collectivism and Strength of Family Ties USA. Given these significant zero-order correlations, the effect of Gini was partialled from the correlations between Parasite Stress USA and Collectivism and between Parasite Stress USA and Strength of Family Ties USA. After statistically controlling the effect of Gini, Parasite Stress USA remained positively correlated with Collectivism (r = 0.46, p = 0.0009, n = 50) and Strength of Family Ties USA (r = 0.35, p = 0.014, n = 50).

The classification scheme was based on Smith et al. 2007 and Fincher and Thornhill 2012, or on our additional research when a disease was not listed in either of those sources. Appendix 3 contains the severity scores for each USA state. Nonzoonotic infectious diseases were correlated positively with Collectivism (r = 0.53, p < 0.0001, n = 50), and so were zoonotic infectious diseases, but much less and with marginal significance (r = 0.32, p = 0.03, n = 50). Nonzoonotic infectious diseases were correlated positively with the Strength of Family Ties USA (r = 0.47, p = 0.0005, n = 50), and so were zoonotic infectious diseases, but much less so and not significantly (r = 0.23, p = 0.11, n = 50). Additional regression analyses showed that nonzoonotic diseases were strongly predictive of Collectivism and Strength of Family Ties USA in comparison to zoonotic diseases: when predicting Collectivism (nonzoonotic std. \u03b2 = 0.50, p = 0.0001; zoonotic std. \u03b2 = 0.24, p = 0.05), when predicting Strength of Family Ties USA (nonzoonotic std. \u03b2 = 0.45, p = 0.0009; zoonotic std. \u03b2 = 0.16, p = 0.21).

He offered it as a new collectivism\u2013individualism variable to be added to three traditional measures we discussed at the beginning of this chapter (Hofstede Individualism, Suh Individualism, Gelfand In-group Collectivism). Exclusionism is characterized by strong social ties of relatives between generations and within groups of relatives, as well as a low value placed on the interests and well-being of strangers. In contrast, universalism is weak ties of relatives between generations and within groups of relatives, as well as a high degree of interest in the needs and welfare of strangers. Given the composition of Minkov\u2019s variable, it is a standard collectivism\u2013individualism metric. Indeed, it is highly correlated with the three traditional measures mentioned from an r of \u22120.71 with Hofstede\u2019s Individualism to an r of 0.81 with Gelfand In-group Collectivism. Importantly, exclusionism\u2013universalism correlates strongly with Combined Parasite Stress (r = 0.72, p < 0.0001, n = 86 countries).",

(2000), Sugiyama and Sugiyama (2003), Sugiyama (2004), and Hill and Hurtado (2009). However, whenever parasite stress is extremely high, collectivistic, including nepotistic, investment may not be optimal because the extreme parasite stress yields extrinsic mortality (Quinlan 2007 and references therein). In the area of evolutionary theory dealing with life history patterns, extrinsic mortality is mortality independent of individuals\u2019 efforts to combat it. Because extrinsic mortality, by definition, cannot be reduced by collectivist social investment, comparatively low levels of investment are expected from life history theory when extrinsic mortality is high. Therefore, we expect reduced collectivist investment in offspring, other kin, and the in-group in general in the face of extremely high parasite stress. In this setting, as in other contexts of high extrinsic mortality, early reproduction with minimum nepotistic investment per family member (e.g., offspring) is expected from life history theory (Charnov 1993; Kaplan and Gangestad 2005). Consistent with this thinking, Quinlan (2007) found in a sample of traditional societies that maternal investment in the form of nursing duration increased along with pathogen stress, but then began to decrease after pathogen stress became extreme. We reasoned that this same pattern would be seen in human value systems as well.",

In-group Assortativeness is a combination variable that we have constructed and explored cross-nationally in Fincher and Thornhill (2012). It combines strength of family ties and religiosity and is a validated measure of embeddedness in the in-group and in-group favoritism. We will discuss this variable further when we treat the relationship between religiosity and parasite stress (Chap. 10.1007/978-3-319-08040-6_9). The exceptional case of Africa mentioned might be explained by the fact that parasite stress is exceptionally high in Africa\u2014and therefore generally yields extrinsic mortality\u2014as compared to the five other world regions. (A post-hoc Tukey HSD means test showed Africa to be distinctly high in parasite stress: Africa, mean (M) = 3.36, A (world areas not followed by the same letter are significantly different); South America, M = 0.85, B; East Eurasia, M = 0.53, BC; North America, M = \u22120.51, BC; Insular Pacific, M = \u22120.65, C; West Eurasia, M = \u22122.28, D.)

As we discuss more fully in Chap. 10.1007/978-3-319-08040-6_10, we have argued that the reduction in parasite stress, beginning in the early to mid-1900s (depending on the particular health intervention), accounts for the cultural revolution in the huge increase in liberalization of values in the 1960s and 1970s in the West\u2014the sexual revolution, antiauthoritarianism, women\u2019s rights, gay rights, changes in divorce law, civil rights, and so on (Thornhill et al. 2009). Although these health improvements had the overall effect of reducing parasitic infections across the USA (and the West in general) and associated morbidity and mortality, the degree of their effect remains variable across the USA, as seen in the data we presented earlier on the power of parasite-stress variation for predicting variation in values across the states of the USA.",

For example, Japan\u2019s northern island of Hokkaido rivals the high individualism in the United States (Kitayama et al. 2006); likely, Hokkaido has a much lower level of parasite stress than does southern Japan, given the negative covariation of parasite stress and latitude (Guernier et al. 2004). Also, in China, historically, much of China\u2019s innovation came from the northern side, which was much lower in parasite adversity than the southern portion below the Yellow River (McNeill 1998). Innovation\u2014both its generation and the willingness of people to adopt it\u2014corresponds to individualistic values (Thornhill et al. 2009, Chap. 10.1007/978-3-319-08040-6_11). The regional development of innovation in China and elsewhere could be studied more thoroughly in its relation to pathogen stress and associated evoked value systems. In the USA, we found significant regional variation in values in spite of generally low parasite adversity in the country. We expect this pattern to be repeated within nations across the world in cases in which a nation contains a parasite gradient.",

We agree, but offer a reinterpretation of the meaning of the demographic transition. Based on our studies on collectivism and family ties discussed earlier, it is reasonable to assume that this increase in the non-kin-to-kin ratio is related to a decrease in parasite stress over time and corresponding increase in individualism and associated nuclear family focus. Moreover, as predicted by the parasite-stress theory of values, those countries where the demographic transition has occurred are the same ones that have experienced a relatively recent emancipation from infectious disease (Thornhill et al. 2009).",

In order to further test this proposition\u2019s application to human movement, we examined the relationship between Binford\u2019s (2001) measure of societal range size, reflecting the aggregate use of space by individuals within a society, for his large sample of 339 traditional societies across the globe, and an estimate of pathogen stress for each of these societies (Fincher and Thornhill 2008b). Binford\u2019s measures are based on his estimates taken from ethnographic sources. We estimated pathogen stress by first establishing the linear equation that best predicted parasite severity (the number of parasitic disease cases), as measured by Low (1994), for the 186 societies in the Standard Cross-Cultural Sample (SCCS, Murdock and White 1969). We examined absolute latitude, mean annual temperature, and mean yearly rainfall as predictor variables from data provided by Binford (2001) for each of the 339 societies in his sample. The data for the SCCS were collected from the World Cultures journal website (www.worldcultures.org). The best single predictor of parasite severity was absolute latitude (r = \u22120.51, p < 0.0001). Both temperature and rainfall significantly predicted parasite severity, but to lower degrees than absolute latitude; therefore, we generated a linear equation to predict parasite severity based on absolute latitude. Then, we used this equation to estimate parasite severity for each of the 339 societies from data on the latitudinal location of each society in Binford (2001).",

We have hypothesized that this pattern of short, but frequent movement of peoples in high parasite areas is also an aspect of evolved antipathogen behavior (Fincher and Thornhill 2008b). Individuals within these societies may move strategically often within a restricted territory to optimally distance themselves from parasites, especially intestinal parasites, that persist in the soil (McNeill 1981; Loehle 1995).

We tested this prediction in a study first reported here. We collected migration data from the Census Bureau for the year 2005 (source: http://www.census.gov/hhes/migration/data/acs/state-to-state.html). We chose 2005 as a point prior to the economic upheaval in 2008. Our measure is the number of people leaving a given state (emigrants) within the year 2005 to establish residence in any other state within the USA. Because of outlying data in the samples, we used Spearman\u2019s correlations to examine the relationships between variables. Unsurprisingly, the number of emigrants was correlated positively with the state\u2019s population size for year 2005 (\u03c1 = 0.97, p < 0.0001, n = 50) (source for population size: http://www.census.gov/popest/data/historical/2000s/vintage_2005/index.html). Therefore, we calculated an Emigration variable for each state that is the number of emigrants from the state divided by the state\u2019s population size. As predicted, the correlation between Parasite Stress USA (introduced in Sect. 5.9.1) and Emigration was significantly negative (\u03c1= \u22120.31, p = 0.03, n = 50 states). This means that there were relatively fewer residential emigration events from states that have high parasite stress; conversely, there were more emigrations from states that have lower parasite stress. There are other potential explanations of emigration rate. One particularly cognizant one is the average wealth within a state. We collected data on GDP per capita for the year 2005 from the Bureau of Economic Analysis (source: www.bea.gov). State-level GDP per capita was unimportant for explaining Emigration (\u03c1 = \u22120.01, p = 0.95, n = 50). Thus, we have here concordant evidence across USA states that philopatry is more prevalent in areas with high parasite adversity than in areas of low parasite adversity. We add, however, that the relationship between Vandello and Cohen\u2019s (1999) measure of collectivism and Emigration is in the predicted direction, but statistically insignificant (\u03c1 = \u22120.19, p = 0.18).",

Various lines of evidence support this hypothesis. Across nations, collectivist people are more philopatric than individualists, and correspondingly collectivists more often live in areas of higher parasite severity than do individualists. Across indigenous societies, range size is related negatively to parasite stress. People in indigenous societies move a lot under high parasite stress, but not very far. Furthermore, interstate movement of residence by people in the USA is reduced in states with high parasite adversity compared to states with low parasite adversity. A similar pattern is seen in the small-scale societies in the Standard Cross-Cultural sample, but involved reduced intercommunity residential movement under high parasite stress. A pattern mentioned in Chap. 10.1007/978-3-319-08040-6_4 is also relevant to the difference in philopatry of collectivists versus individualists. Liberals are more interested in and engage in more travel from their home region. This is seen from scores of degree of conservatism/liberalism of individuals (Carney et al. 2008). Finally, the parasite-stress theory of movement gives new meaning to an important general rule of ecological science, Rapoport\u2019s rule.",

The study of family life first became fully encompassed by evolutionary biology with Hamilton\u2019s realization that an individual\u2019s fitness is more than its phenotypic design for production of descendant relatives\u2014that is, more than the individual\u2019s classical or Darwinian fitness (Chap. 10.1007/978-3-319-08040-6_2). Indeed, one\u2019s inclusive fitness is the classical component plus design for assisting nondescendant kin by nepotism and thereby promoting one\u2019s reproduction. However, current inclusive fitness theory, the fundamental component of modern evolutionary social theory, does not account for why nepotism is variable across social systems. Why is nepotism limited to the nuclear family in many systems, but extended beyond the nuclear family in others to entail varying degrees of cooperative breeding? In this chapter, we provide considerable evidence that parasite stress explains this variation across human social systems. Family ties, or collectivism, measures the investment in the extended family and hence measures cooperative breeding. We proposed in Fincher and Thornhill (2012) that a general theory of family life across taxa is accomplished by coupling the parasite-stress theory of sociality with Hamilton\u2019s theory.",

            "text": "The social organization of animal species varies along a cooperative breeding continuum, or said differently, a continuum of eusociality (Andersson 1984; Sherman et al. 1995). A mother alone investing in her offspring or, much less commonly across species, a father alone investing in offspring, is on the highest asociality end of the continuum. Species in which both mother and father nepotistically assist the offspring (so-called biparental species) are more social in degree on the continuum. This is followed by varying degrees of nepotism extended outside parental care (i.e., extra-parental nepotism). Sterility, shown by adult members of the group who serve as helpers and thereby assist relatives of varying degrees or in some cases nonrelatives instead of producing their own offspring, occurs in certain taxa of vertebrates, including the human species, and certain taxa of invertebrates. Depending on the species, this sterility ranges from temporary to permanent. The temporary case is delayed striving to produce descendent kin while, instead, engaging in extra-parental nepotism and other in-group altruism (e.g., certain human groups (Hill and Hurtado 2009) and certain species of wasps, birds, and carnivores). The permanent case is lifelong exclusive extra-parental nepotism (as is characteristic of worker and soldier castes in ants and termites). Both temporary and permanent cases are cooperative breeding, a feature of in-group assortative sociality. Also, the relatively eusocial species on the continuum\u2014i.e., the more cooperative in terms of group breeding\u2014exhibit, in general, strong sedentism, delayed or no dispersal from the natal location, and territory defense by the family group or in some cases by the larger in-group (e.g., Arnold and Owens 1998). According to the parasite-stress theory, the sedentism and limited dispersal are analogs (similarity resulting from independent evolution by selection, i.e., convergent evolution) or in some cases homologs (similarity resulting from common ancestry) of human philopatry. The territoriality is the analog or homolog, depending on the comparison, of human xenophobia.",

The incidence of cooperative breeding in birds has been shown to correlate positively with temporal variation in certain climatic factors, especially rainfall (Jetz and Rubenstein 2011). It is not known, however, whether parasite stress in birds also corresponds to temporal variation in the factors Jetz and Rubenstein studied, but it is established that climatic factors correlate strongly with human infectious disease adversity (e.g., Dunn et al. 2010). Data that would allow a comparison of parasite stress in cooperative and noncooperative breeding nonhuman vertebrates are unavailable. A test of our hypothesis that cooperative breeding is favored by selection under high parasite adversity would include measures of allocation to the immune system between the two types of social systems. M\u00f8ller (1998) reported that tropical bird species show greater immune-system allocation than do temperate bird species, which is expected on the basis of greater parasite adversity in the tropics. The prediction that cooperative breeders will invest more in immune defense than closely related species that breed in pairs (noncooperative breeders) was supported by a study of 66 species of African birds, of which 18 were cooperative breeders (Spottiswoode 2008). Similar comparisons could be conducted on cooperative-breeding species versus non-cooperative-breeding species in other taxa containing cooperative breeders.",

As degree of collectivism increases across human cultural groups, so do each of these features of in-group assortative sociality. The ethnocentrism component of in-group assortative sociality involves more than just investment in the nuclear and extended family. It extends to nonrelated others with like values and hence, in human evolutionary history, to other in-group people with similar immunity. As explained in Chap. 10.1007/978-3-319-08040-6_3\u2019s discussion of the basic components of the parasite-stress theory of values, the ethnocentrism functionally is for both avoidance and management of infectious diseases. The management part of ethnocentrism is designed to produce and maintain socially supportive networks, based on nepotism and pure reciprocity (reciprocity without a kinship component), with other people of similar values and norms, which are therefore safe for social interaction from the standpoint of reduced risk of infection by a novel parasite. This network was the only insurance against the morbidity and mortality resulting from infectious disease in evolutionary ancestral times of the hominin lineage. Hence, the quality and reliability of this support network affected differential inclusive reproductive success of individuals. Those individuals with high quality and reliable networks out-reproduced those without such networks, and hence became modern human\u2019s evolutionary ancestors.",

In addition, a minority of the group members comes from the outside through marriage, capture, or other sources of immigration (e.g., Van den Berghe 1981; Low 2000). Although the composition of the group in human evolutionary history included very distant relatives and some nonrelatives, giving context for natural selection favoring reciprocity in the broader social network, we propose that an important context for the evolution of reciprocity was in gaining benefits from out-group interactions during periods of relatively low disease threat. Thus, the parasite-stress theory of values offers a novel perspective to explain the evolution of human reciprocal altruism. Accordingly, natural selection is expected to have designed our reciprocity activities to be conditionally sensitive to the variable risk of contagion in the local ecological setting. Under low such risk, reciprocity is more beneficial than under high risk.",

A version of this idea applied to the cognitive abilities of humans was discussed by Alexander (1987, 1990) and Flinn et al. (2005). Alexander argued that, as we became ecologically dominant during human evolution as a result of the evolved psychological capacity for inventing weapons and other technology, the most important selective agents were not \u201c\u2026 climate, weather, food shortages, or parasites\u2014not even predators\u201d (Alexander 1990, p. 4). Rather, he proposed that, as we gained relative freedom (compared to other species) from these forms of mortality, other humans became the greatest force of Darwinian selection. This led to runaway social selection in the human lineage, generating many aspects of human mental uniqueness, such as consciousness, theory of mind, creativity, exquisite linguistic and deceptive abilities, reputation building, and many others (Flinn et al. 2005).",

We suggest a different scenario: as our physical environmental problems and predators became less important as mortality agents, parasites became more important as agents of selection. Indeed, only since the inventions of vaccines, antibiotics and modern sanitation have humans achieved any significant dominance over parasites. Also, such dominance is seen primarily only in the West. As discussed in Chap. 10.1007/978-3-319-08040-6_3, in many geographic areas infectious disease appears to be the leading factor bringing about natural selection on contemporary humans, and infectious disease is likely the leading cause of juvenile mortality in indigenous peoples in the ethnographic record. Even now in the USA, a relatively low parasite-stress country, much of the variation in human lifespan may result from parasitic disease (see above and Chap. 10.1007/978-3-319-08040-6_8).

If we are correct about collectivism\u2013individualism and related values being causally related to pathogen stress, then human ecological dominance (relative freedom from predators and the physical environment, but of increased importance of parasites) would lead to the same social features considered important in Alexander\u2019s (1990) hypothesis: intensive and extensive nepotism, male kin and nonkin coalitions, male philopatry, pervasive intergroup and intragroup conflict, raiding, war, complex reciprocity, and the like. Thus, much of human uniqueness may arise from our ecological dominance generating runaway social selection in concert with the avoidance and management of parasites. Flinn et al. (2005) provided evidence that the parts of the brain evolutionarily enlarged in humans, and which account for the brain-size differences between chimpanzees and humans, function in human social life. We agree with Flinn et al.\u2019s (2005) emphasis on coevolutionary, antagonistic social races in the human lineage. We add that these races were fueled by variable parasite stresses that gave rise to adaptive variation through time and space in the use of collectivist and individualist tactics in defining and delimiting social networks and in-group and out-group interactions. It is the variation in parasite stress in a locale that gives rise to the social complexity and difficulty involved in adaptive use of these tactics in social interactions. In essence, the unique cognitive abilities of Homo sapiens may reflect, in large part, mental and associated behavioral adaptations that evolved in the context of the relatively greater selection from pathogen stresses in humans compared to other species, and it was these abilities, we argue, that provided adaptive solutions to the complex and contingently optimal social decisions arising from variable pathogen stresses.",

Parasite-stress variation, however, is central to adopting adaptive behavioral contingencies for social behavior. We propose that the context of spatially and temporally variable parasite stress and associated in-group and out-group behavioral solutions to the variation was a chief adaptive problem that ultimately created human abilities in intensive and extensive nepotism, complex reciprocity involving distant relatives and unrelated others, and the psychology involved in intergroup interactions, antagonisms, and alliances.",

After summarizing numerous research findings that predators differentially kill and eat parasitized prey, compared to their depredation of healthy prey items, he proposed that as predator abundance declines, parasites evolve higher virulence (pathogenicity) (M\u00f8ller 2008). M\u00f8ller\u2019s reasoning was that, under elevated natural selection on a host species from predators, the greater predation on parasitized prey would select for reduced pathogenicity in the parasites. This is because parasites with reduced virulence would be less likely to die before transmission to a new host as a result of their host being depredated. If this is correct, then the relative emancipation of human evolutionary ancestors from predators resulting from their weaponry and other technology contributed to the relatively greater impact of parasite adversity in human evolution through increased parasite virulence (A. M\u00f8ller, personal communication, August 5, 2010).",

These costs, we have argued, result in a negative ontogenetic interaction between cognitive ability and classical immunity. Parasitic infections result in a greater allocation to the classical immune system, and hence limit the energy available for cognitive development. These infections also reduce energy availability more directly. In research with Chris Eppig, we have shown that, both cross-nationally and across the states of the USA, parasite stress is strongly, negatively related to cognitive ability (IQ) (Eppig et al. 2010, 2011; Chap. 10.1007/978-3-319-08040-6_11). This, we argue, helps to explain why conservatives have lower cognitive ability than liberals and why collectivist cultures, relative to individualist ones, are more economically depressed (see Chaps. 10.1007/978-3-319-08040-6_4 and 10.1007/978-3-319-08040-6_11).

Cashdan (2001b) demonstrated that ethnocentrism was high in traditional societies that experienced catastrophic food shortage, while xenophobia was high where the threat of intergroup violence was great. Further extension of the parasite-stress model of sociality can provide a basis for making more refined predictions about the patterns of xenophobia and ethnocentrism. For example, in a given area, zoonotic diseases may generate high morbidity and mortality, but nonzoonotics low morbidity and mortality; in this setting, ethnocentrism is predicted to be high, but xenophobia low, because zoonotic infections are not transmitted between human hosts.

Where a person stands in terms of moral foundations is measured by questionnaires. We mentioned in the previous chapter that liberals moralize in relation to an \u201cindividualizing\u201d moral foundation that prioritizes individual autonomy and success, whereas conservatives moralize more from a \u201cbinding\u201d foundation of morals that prioritizes the well-being, loyalty, and integrity of the collective. There, too, we tied these two factors of moral foundations theory to individualism and collectivism. Van Leeuwen et al. (2012) have connected aspects of moral foundations theory to the parasite-stress theory in showing across a large sample of nations that parasite stress is related positively and significantly to the three subfactors of the binding moral foundation (specifically, endorsement of in-group loyalty, respect of authority, and purity and holiness). This is as expected by the parasite-stress theory, because collectivism includes high value given to in-group embeddedness and loyalty, authoritarianism, and religiosity. No significant relationship was found by Van Leeuwen et al. (2012) between parasite stress and either of the two individualizing subfactors: harm or care, fairness/reciprocity. These two subfactors address how people ought (morally) to treat other people. We suggest that there is a methodological problem with the measures of both of the individualizing subfactors. From the parasite-stress-theory perspective, it is essential to distinguish between in-group and out-group harm or care or fairness/reciprocity. Hence, the binded people (collectivists) primarily care for in-group members, whereas individualists show more care toward a broad network of people. If the distinction between in-group and out-group altruism were included in a future questionnaire, we predict that high parasite stress would be associated primarily with in-group care, fairness and reciprocity, and low parasite stress predominantly with out-group care, fairness, and reciprocity.",

This value dimension has been studied in some detail and measured in multiple highly correlated ways. Fincher et al.

Individualism confers benefits upon individuals such as independent thinking, openness to new and nontraditional ideas and ways, and willingness to interact with a diversity of people. These same traits, however, have the cost of an enhanced likelihood of contracting infectious disease. Thus, the lower the parasite stress, the greater the benefits of individualism relative to its costs. In contrast, the behaviors that define collectivism, such as ethnocentrism, xenophobia, and adherence to traditional ideas and ways, function in antipathogen defense, and thus are optimal under conditions of high parasite stress.",

The parasite-stress theory of values proposes that infectious disease transmissible among humans (human-specific and multihost parasites) will be more important in predicting collectivism\u2013individualism than those that humans can contract only from nonhuman animals (zoonotics). As predicted, both human-specific and multihost parasite richness predicted uniquely cross-national differences in collectivist\u2013individualist values. Zoonotic parasite richness contributed little, if at all, to cross-national relationships between parasite adversity and these values. Thus, worldwide variation in these values predicted by parasite adversity appears to be attributable almost entirely to the prevalence of nonzoonotic diseases.",
