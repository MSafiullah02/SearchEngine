The tracheostomy cuff is inflated and the circuit is connected. The capnography CO2 trace is confirmed. We do not scope the tracheostomy, unless there is an absolute need. The ET tube is simultaneously clamped while the tracheostomy is being placed. This is a critical step. It is important to remember that the patient has technically been extubated and for this reason 20 minutes needs to pass to allow re circulation before doffing. The anaesthetic nurse documents this time. The tracheostomy tube is secured with sutures. A closed suctioning is attached to the tracheostomy tube and suctioning can then be performed.",

This has reinforced the need for us to be adaptable and reflective practitioners. The need for surgical tracheostomies will increase over the next weeks and months; for this reason we have to approach them in a robust, repeatable and safe manner. Our experience has allowed us to identify some critical steps that we have introduced to make this procedure safer for all involved. We have also framed the process in 5 distinct domains. It has to be recognised that these procedures are time consuming given all the steps involved and good communication can minimise unnecessary time stoppages and improve human factors. We have also recognised that due to staff self-isolating, regular head and neck scrub staff may not be available. This can also add challenges and reinforces the need for good communication and reproducible steps. We believe that our approach is safe and easily reproducible and we welcome comments towards improvement.",
