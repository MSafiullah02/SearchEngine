Multidisciplinary clinics, with surgeons, oncologists and support staff, usually have an agreed treatment policy and offer the best outcomes. However, mortality rates for oral cancer have substantially increased in many countries. Although the efficacy of screening for oral cancer to increase survival and reduce mortality remains unproven, it is believed that Cuba's ongoing oral cancer screening programme has resulted in a higher proportion of cancers being localized at diagnosis and a comparatively high survival rate.22 The WHO has published guidelines on prevention,23 and studies have shown reduction or reversal in pre-cancerous lesions by primary prevention or abstinence from tobacco. There is a considerable body of evidence indicating a protective effect on oral cancer and pre-cancer, of diets rich in fresh fruits and vegetables and of vitamin A in particular. The prognosis is very site-dependent. For intra-oral carcinoma, 5-year survival may be as low as 30% for posterior lesions presenting late, as they often do, while for lip carcinoma, there is often more than a 70% 5-year survival.",

Most noma sufferers are under 6 years of age and it has been estimated that the case-fatality rate is probably between 70% and 90%. It is estimated that 100 000 African children under the age of 6 years contract noma every year.62 Factors which predispose to the development of gangrenous stomatitis include protein\u2013energy malnutrition and deficiencies of vitamins A, B, C, iron or magnesium. Therefore, poor living environment, exposure to debilitating childhood diseases, poor oral hygiene and malnutrition all appear to put children at risk for noma. In the developed world, gangrenous stomatitis is rare, and typically seen in immunocompromised persons such as those with HIV infection, leukaemia and diabetes.63 The condition is seen especially in sub-Saharan Africa. Nigeria probably has the highest incidence, although The Gambia, Algeria, Uganda, Senegal, Madagascar, South Africa, Sudan and Egypt are also areas of high prevalence, as are Afghanistan, India, the Philippines, China, Vietnam, Papua New Guinea and South America.",

It causes a chancre (primary, hard or Hunterian chancre) which begins as a small, firm, pink macule, changes to a papule and then ulcerates to form a painless round ulcer with a raised margin and indurated base (Figure 73.5\n). About 60% of oral cases affect the lip or may present at the angles of the mouth.64 Other oral sites affected may include the tongue and to a lesser extent the gingivae and fauces. Lymph nodes in the submaxillary, submental and cervical regions are usually enlarged. Chancres heal spontaneously within 3\u20138 weeks. Secondary syphilis follows the primary stage after 6\u20138 weeks but a healing chancre may still be present. As in the primary stage, the mucosal lesions are highly infectious. The typical signs and symptoms are fever, headache, malaise, a rash (characteristically symmetrically distributed coppery maculopapules or lesions on the palms) and generalized painless lymph node enlargement. It is this stage that classically causes oral lesions. Painless oral ulcers (mucous patches and snail-track ulcers) are the typical lesions and are slightly raised, greyish white, glistening patches seen on the fauces, soft palate, tongue, buccal mucosa and, rarely, gingivae. Cervical nodes are enlarged and \u2018rubbery\u2019 in consistency. Latent syphilis follows secondary syphilis and persists until late syphilis (tertiary syphilis) develops. The characteristic lesion of tertiary syphilis is a localized midline granuloma (\u2018gumma\u2019) varying in size from millimetres to several centimetres, which breaks down to form a deep punched-out painless ulcer. The most common oral site for a gumma is the hard palate although the soft palate, lips or tongue are commonly involved. The gumma starts as a small, pale, raised area which ulcerates and rapidly progresses to a large zone of necrosis with denudation of bone and, in the case of a palatal gumma, may eventually perforate into the nasal cavity.65\n",

Primary tuberculosis of the mouth is more common in children and adolescents than adults. It usually presents as a single painless indolent ulcer commonly on the gingiva with enlarged cervical lymph nodes, or the gingivae, tooth extraction sockets and the buccal folds. Occasional cases of primary jaw tuberculosis have been reported, usually resulting from extension of a gingival lesion, from an infected post-extraction socket, from an extension from a tuberculous granuloma at the apex of the tooth or haematogenous spread. Tuberculous osteomyelitis may involve the maxilla particularly, or the mandible. The same general pattern as seen in other affected bones is common, with a slow rarefying osteitis resulting in sequestration of bone. Pain is not a prominent early feature but is seen later. Secondary infection may lead to difficulty in making a diagnosis. Tuberculous involvement of the mandible causes symptoms of pain, swelling, difficulty in eating, trismus, paraesthesia of the lower lip and enlargement of the regional lymph nodes. The infection may spread throughout the jaw, producing multiple sinuses, which drain intra- or extra-orally. The posterior mandible and ascending ramus are typically affected, and radiographical appearances include irregular linear calcifications along the lower border and irregular radiolucencies within the jawbone. In the maxilla the infra-orbital region, particularly in the young, is the usual site affected. Typically, a cold abscess develops and may eventually drain through fistulae but occasionally a firm intra-bony lesion may be present. TB in AIDS may affect the salivary glands.69, 70, 71\n",

            "text": "Pseudomembranous candidosis or thrush may be seen in neonates and among terminally ill patients, particularly in asso\u00adciation with immunocompromising conditions (Figure 73.6\n).75 Thrush is characterized by white patches on the surface of the oral mucosa, tongue, gingivae and elsewhere. The lesions form confluent plaques that resemble milk curds and can be wiped off the mucosa with gauze. Oral candidosis in the form of thrush is classically an acute infection, but it may recur for many months or even years in patients using corticosteroids topically or by aerosol, in HIV-infected individuals and in other immunocompromised patients. The term chronic pseudomembranous candidosis has been used for chronic recurrence. Erythematous or atrophic candidosis is an uncommon and poorly understood condition. It may arise as a consequence of persistent acute pseudomembranous candidosis, when the pseudomembranes are shed, or in HIV infection may precede pseudomembranous candidosis. Erythematous areas are seen mainly on the dorsum of the tongue, palate, gingivae or buccal mucosa. Lesions on the dorsum of the tongue present as de\u00adpapillated areas. Midline or median rhomboid glossitis, or glossal central papillary atrophy, is characterized by an area of papillary atrophy that is rhomboid in shape, symmetrically placed centrally at the midline of the tongue, anterior to the circumvallate papillae. Red areas are often seen in the palate in HIV disease. Hyperplastic candidosis (Candida leukoplakia) is typified by chronic, discrete raised lesions that are typically found at the commissures, rarely on the gingivae. Angular stomatitis (perl\u00e8che, angular cheilitis) is a clinical diagnosis of lesions that affect, and are restricted to, the angles of the mouth, characterized by soreness, erythema and fissuring, and is commonly associated with denture-induced stomatitis. Both yeasts and bacteria are involved, as interacting, predisposing factors. It is occasionally an isolated initial sign of anaemia or vitamin deficiency, and resolves when the underlying disease has been treated. Angular stomatitis may also be seen in HIV disease and Crohn's disease.",
