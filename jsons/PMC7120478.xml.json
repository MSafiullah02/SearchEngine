These viral antigens generated in transgenic plants are effective in inducing mucosal and serum immune responses in animals.",

Further added advantages include the easy storage, transport, and administration by direct ingestion of these oral vaccines. Represented in the form of plant organs (fruits, leaves, tubers, seeds, stems, or roots), these vaccines can be easily grown and distributed, omitting the need for refrigeration in delivery or the requirement for injection by trained health personnel, thereby reducing the costs of immunization programs in developing countries.",

            "text": "We describe here several techniques that utilize Agrobacterium tumefaciens for the introduction of foreign DNA into plant cells. In nature, Agrobacterium tumefaciens is a Gram-negative soil bacterium that transfers and incorporates its transfer-DNA (T-DNA) into the plant nuclear genome. This results in an expression of genes on the T-DNA that will cause crown gall in the infected plant (5). It has been demonstrated in Agrobacterium-mediated transformation that following co-cultivation of tobacco BY-2 cells with an Agrobacterium harboring a GFP fusion construct, the rate of fusion protein synthesis markedly increased between 24 and 36 h, after which rapid decrease occurred (6). Agroinfiltration is a more recent technique that can be applied to investigate transient expression in plant cells by which an Agrobacterium liquid culture is infiltrated into intact plant leaves (7). The feasibility of rapid analyses of foreign protein expression in transiently expressed leaves following agroinfiltration presents a major advantage in its use. The transiently expressed foreign protein is probably derived from transiently synthesized T-DNA containing the construct that had been mobilized from Agrobacterium cells to the tobacco nuclei but has yet to be integrated into the tobacco nuclear genome (8).",

This approach by using GFP as an autoflourescent tag can further determine the subcellular localization of recombinant-tagged protein expressed in plant cells, thus providing information for optimal subcellular targeting of such recombinant proteins produced in plant bioreactors.",

Images of transient expression of S1:GFP antigen in the cytosol of agroinfiltrated tobacco leaves are shown in Fig. 2. Expression of the construct with GFP alone was not confined to the cytosol. Nuclear expression is seen because of the accumulation of passive diffusion of GFP into the nucleus (13). The S1:GFP fusion was localized to the cytosol, and also to the periphery of the nucleus as well, implicating that S1:GFP was secreted through the endoplasmic reticulum network. Depending on total experimental conditions, the expression of the target gene at the infiltrated area can vary. Under optimal conditions, almost all cells at the infiltrated area show expression, like in Fig. 2. Generally, it should not be difficult to get expression in more than 50% of plant cells at the infiltrated area.\n\n",

Total proteins were extracted from tobacco leaves infiltrated with plasmid pGDG expressing GFP alone or plasmid pCV12 expressing the S1:GFP fusion.\nHarvest plant tissues and immediately freeze in liquid nitrogen. Grind using a mortar and pestle in protein homogenizing buffer. Use about 10 mL of ice-cold homogenizing buffer per 1 g of tissue.Boil ground tissue at 100 \u00b0C for 10 min, centrifuge at 14,000 rpm for 5 min, and transfer the supernatant into a new Eppendorf and store at \u201320 \u00b0C. Determine the protein content.Denature the protein samples in 1\u00d7 SDS sample loading buffer by heating at 95 \u00b0C for 5 min before loading onto the gel. Separate protein samples (20 \u03bcg) by SDS-PAGE using a 10% gel using a Mini-PROTEAN II slab gel unit or comparable apparatus.Use RainbowTM colored protein molecular weight markers in gels destined for transfer to Hybond-C membrane.Electrophoretically transfer proteins to Hybond-C membrane from SDS-PAGE gel using a Trans-Blot cell at 50 V for 1.5 h in cold transfer buffer. A piece of Hybond-C membrane, cut to the size of the gel and wetted with distilled water, was placed on top of the gel without inclusion of any air bubbles. The gel and the membrane were then sandwiched between two pieces of Whatman No. 3 paper that were also cut to the size of the gel and were presoaked in transfer buffer (see\nNote\n5).For detection using anti-GFP antibodies in western blot analysis, incubate the blot for 1 h at room temperature (RT) in blocking solution with gently shaking.After washing the blots twice for 10 min in TTBS, then incubated for 2 h at room temperature in monoclonal anti-GFP antibodies diluted 1:5,000 in TTBS with gentle agitation.Wash the blot twice for 10 min with TTBS, followed by incubation in anti-mouse IgG alkaline phosphatase diluted 1:30,000 in TTBS for 1 h at room temperature with gentle shaking.Wash in TTBS four times for 10 min, and stain the blot in freshly prepared color development solution at room temperature until the reacting protein bands are visible.Stop the reaction by washing the membrane twice for 5 min in water. Results of western blot analysis using antibodies against GFP of total plant proteins extracted from tobacco leaves infiltrated with plasmid pCV12 (expressing the S1:GFP fusion) are shown in Fig. 2e (lane 2 shows an expected band of calculated size 99.1 kDa, demonstrating that the S1:GFP fusion protein was successfully expressed).\n",

            "text": "\nThe technique is suitable for leaves or petals. Agrobacterium has to be introduced into the leaves through the stomata or via wounding. In transient gene expression, the levels in expression may be age dependent and may differ in leaf tissues at varying stages of development. Generally, the highest level of transient expression is observed in tissues that contain recently expanded leaf cells.Agroinfiltration can also be used in conjunction with vacuum infiltration on either detached or attached plant leaves. With the use of detached leaves, the leaves should be best incubated on wet filter paper rather than on solidified MS medium following agroinfiltration since incubation on MS often gave lower expression levels (8).The pH of the Agrobacterium resuspension can be within a range of pH 5.0\u20135.8. We usually use pH 5.5. The concentration of Agrobacterium cells is important for infiltration. The optimal concentration of the Agrobacterium suspension is OD600 = 0.4\u20130.6. The Agrobacterium culture is grown to log phase and then resuspended to OD600 = 0.4\u20130.6 for better expression. If the bacterial cells are out of log phase, the efficiency could be much decreased.Acetosyringone is usually added in the agroinfiltration medium to increase the efficiency. It has been demonstrated in Chinese Cabbage that agroinfiltration can be improved by adding hydrogen peroxide (14). Since the plasmid vector for agroinfiltration does not necessarily carry an antibiotic-resistance selectable marker gene, a smaller vector can be considered for use to enhance T-DNA transfer in plant cells by agroinfiltration.Make sure there are no air bubbles between nitrocellulose membrane and gel or else certain regions will not be transferred to the membrane. Alternatively, the blot can be assembled under transfer buffer to avoid trapping bubbles.\n",
