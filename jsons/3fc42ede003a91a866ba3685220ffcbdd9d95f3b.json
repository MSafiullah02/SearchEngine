When issues are identified, the IP&C team intervenes to ensure that safe quality care is provided. Yet, IP&C strategies, for the most part, specifically target adult healthcare institutions [11] . Therefore, specialized programs need to be developed and tailored to meet the needs of the pediatric population, taking into account age-related factors that prevent the child from adhering to IP&C standards, as well as taking into account the impact that caregivers have on prevention and transmission. Without these specialized IP&C programs, there is a higher risk for developing HAIs due to developmental stages, social dependencies, differing diagnostic strategies, and immature immune systems [10, 12, 13] .",

Although monitoring compliance is a well-known concept in relation to HAIs (outcome indicators) [5] , no specific key performance indicator(s) (KPI) for IP&C practices (process indicators) have been established and approved internationally [20, 21] . The authors believe that to ensure compliance with basic IP&C principles (target processes such as hand hygiene, standard precautions and transmission-based precautions), robust KPIs need to be monitored, focusing on targeted processes.

This includes staffing numbers and levels of experience, early detection and intervention in outbreak situations [7] , environmental controls, adequate supplies, and programs for education. The lack of a functional surveillance program may ultimately result in missed trends and underdetermine the magnitude of HAIs and risks associated with healthcare procedures [22] . It is vital that each healthcare facility determines the type and frequency of surveillance required for their patient population(s). This can be achieved by undertaking an IP&C risk assessment [1, 9, 14] . Surveillance, whether it is targeted, total-house, or a combination of the two, is of paramount importance for identifying institutional problems, including outbreaks, as well as for directing initiatives [22] . Outbreaks of infectious pathogens can result in patient morbidity/mortality, environmental contamination, and/or HCW absenteeism. Implementation of appropriate measures to minimize or prevent transmission is of paramount importance. It is well documented that pediatric and the immunocompromised shed viruses for longer periods of time [23e27]. This alters and increases the potential duration of the preventative measures required and risks involved. Cohorting can be an effective preventative strategy in selected circumstances. It may be required during outbreaks when there is limited resources and increased occupancy. Consultation with experts in the IP&C and Infectious Disease fields is vital to ensure appropriate utilization of resources in decision-making and promoting adherence with standard and transmission-based precautions (contact, droplet or airborne) [7, 11, 28] .",

As discussed in this paper, there is a comprehensive need for a proactive approach by all caregivers, oversight by an IP&C team, and strong support from management and other key stakeholders.",
