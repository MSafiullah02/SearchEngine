The scientific-clinical picture is further complicated by the fact that, while human SARS CoVs presents heavy pathogenicity leading to death, other human CoVs, such as HCoV-OC43 and HCoV-229E, are less pathogenic and cause common colds and mild lower respiratory tract infections [2] .",

Excessively high values of surface tension would lead to alveolar collapse thus making ventilation and gas exchange impossible. Surfactant is produced by alveolar type II cells, secreted into the alveolar space, and it consists of lipids and proteins. The phospholipid component (dipalmitoylphosphatidylcholine, DPPC) reduces the surface tension, and the protein component -surfactant protein A (SP-A), surfactant protein B (SP-B), and surfactant protein C (SP-C) -together with a network of additional proteins regulate surfactant homeostasis and metabolism and, importantly, contribute to maintain immunological homeostasis in the lung, attenuating both infection and inflammation [4] .",

Peptide sharing between spike glycoproteins and human surfactantrelated proteins was analyzed as extensively described in previous publications [3 and refs. therein] . In brief. Spike glycoprotein primary sequences were dissected into pentapeptides offset by one residue and each viral pentapeptide was analyzed for matches within human proteins that had been retrieved from UniProtKB database (http://www. uniprot.org/) [6] using 'surfactant' as keyword. Next, the shared pentaptides were analyzed for presence in spike glycoproteins-derived immunoreactive epitopes by using the IEDB Immune Epitope DataBase (IEDB) [7] to analyze the immunological potential of the peptide sharing. The final results are reported in Table 1 and Table S1 and show that.",

This letter addresses the issue of why SARS-CoV-2 attacks the respiratory system and reports on a vast peptide sharing between SARS-CoV-2 spike glycoprotein and surfactant-related proteins. Analyses using the Immune Epitope DataBase (IEDB) resource also show that many of the shared peptides are endowed with immunological potential. Given the caveat that the positive correlation of the pentapeptide sharing shown in Table 1 needs to be controlled by serologic validation, results suggest that immune responses following SARS-CoV-2 infection might lead to crossreactions with pulmonary surfactant and related proteins, and might contribute to the SARS-CoV-2-associated lung diseases. The data warn against using vaccines based on entire SARS-CoV-2 antigens to fight SARS-CoV infections, and highlight peptide uniqueness as a molecular concept for effective anti-CoV immunotherapy [3] .
