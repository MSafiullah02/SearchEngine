Many models are explicitly \"mechanistic\" and represent epidemics as processes that result in transition of individuals in the population between health states (e.g., susceptible, infectious, and immune) 13\n,\n14 . However, construction of such models requires fairly detailed information on incidence, immune status in the population, and contact patterns for correct parameterization. We have recently described a very simple mathematical model (the Incidence Decay with Exponential Adjustment, or \"IDEA\", model) that can be used as a descriptive and prognostic tool for epidemic processes when only limited data (e.g., cumulative incidence curves) are available 1 . Here we apply this model to this epidemic; our objectives are to reproduce, mathematically, observed patterns of epidemic growth, and to gain insights into the degree to which current control efforts are likely to impact epidemic size and duration.",

These data are derived from official case counts from the World Health Organization, but have been aggregated and organized, making them an efficient resource for model fitting. Total case counts from this source do not distinguish between suspect, probable and confirmed case counts, and consequently cumulative incidence may decrease between measurements reflecting suspect cases who have been excluded through testing or other means. As only a fraction of cases are subject to virological confirmation, we also obtained virologically-confirmed case counts, by date, from the Virology Down Under blog, maintained by Dr. Ian Mackay (http://virologydownunder.blogspot.com.au/). These estimates are, again, derived from World Health Organization reports.

This model describes epidemic processes both in terms of exponential growth (a function of the basic reproductive number, R0) and in terms of simultaneous decay, brought about by behavioral change, public health interventions, increased immunity in the population, or any other dynamic change that slows disease transmission; the model is descriptive and cannot distinguish between putative controlling mechanisms, but has the advantage of allowing epidemic growth to slow even before the critical fraction of susceptibles in the population is exhausted 1\n,\n 13 . We have previously shown excellent agreement between the IDEA model and a discrete-time susceptible-infectious-removed (SIR) compartmental model, when R0 is low or moderate 1 . The IDEA model has several attractive properties: it can be readily parameterized by fitting to either incidence or cumulative incidence data, requires no assumptions regarding immune status in the population, and appears to provide reasonably accurate projections about epidemic size and duration (in the absence of change in control efforts) based on pre-peak epidemic data when R0 is low or moderate. Furthermore, comparison with simulations suggests that the model can identify multi-wave epidemics or abrupt changes in control based on sudden changes in the value of the control parameter d (as described below) from generation to generation1.",

In Liberia, a low R0 with no control (d ~ 0) contrasted with a high R0 and high control (d = 0.22) in Sierra Leone.

Based on models fit to available cumulative incidence data from August 2014, we project that in the absence of more effective control interventions, this epidemic will increase to affect tens, and possibly hundreds, of thousands of individuals. Given the high case fatality ratio associated with Ebola virus infection, such an occurrence would be nothing short of catastrophic. Based on data currently available to us, it appears that this threat is currently centered on the Liberian component of the epidemic, which can be characterized as a simple exponential growth process, with little evidence for slowing of transmission. This contrasts with outbreaks in Guinea and Sierra Leone.",

Nonetheless, this parameter describes the observed tendency of epidemics and outbreaks to end before the critical density of susceptibles is exhausted 1. In our published 1 , and as yet unpublished applications of this modeling approach to influenza and MERS coronavirus epidemics and outbreaks, negligible values for d, as observed in Liberia, have been distinctly unusual. However, uninterrupted exponential growth of an epidemic, as we observe in Liberia, is consistent with media reports and communication from colleagues in the field. We project that even small, incremental near-term increases in control (as defined by d) would result in thousands or tens of thousands of infections prevented. The value of 0.005 used in our analysis is arbitrary; unfortunately, the novelty of the IDEA approach means that we have very limited understanding of the empiric size of real-world control factors that would translate to a given change in d. However, our experiment confers a control factor on Liberia less than that that appears to be operative in Guinea, so we believe this is likely to represent an attainable increase in control.",

We performed numerous sensitivity analyses, and found that use of deaths or virologically confirmed case numbers, variation in plausible starting date or generation time, and varying assumptions about (constant) under-reporting resulted in very little change in best-fit model parameters.
