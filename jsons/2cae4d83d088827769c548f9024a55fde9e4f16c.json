Data from published clinical studies indicate that the infectivity of influenza A virus is probably very high, so that transmission of infection may involve low doses of virus. At low doses, the relation between dose and the probability of infection is approximately linear, so that the reduction in infection risk is proportional to the reduction in exposure due to particle retention of the mask. A population transmission model was set up to explore the impact of population-wide mask use, allowing estimation of the effects of mask efficacy and coverage (fraction of the population wearing masks) on the basic reproduction number and the infection attack rate. We conclude that population-wide use of face masks could make an important contribution in delaying an influenza pandemic. Mask use also reduces the reproduction number, possibly even to levels sufficient for containing an influenza outbreak.",

Droplets are particles large enough to settle quickly, while aerosols are small enough to remain suspended in air for an indefinite period. (10) Fabian et al. showed that regular exhalation mainly results in aerosol production (>99% of exhaled particles <5 \u03bcm), with most people exhaling more than 500 particles per liter of air and influenza virus RNA being detected in the exhaled breath of 33% of influenza patients. (21) Droplets smaller in diameter than a few micrometers are believed to evaporate to about half their initial size. These small liquid particles are usually referred to as \"droplet nuclei.\" (22) Many guidelines and review articles state that droplet transmission may be the main mode of influenza transmission. However, compelling scientific evidence supports the occurrence and significance of aerosol transmission (21, 23) and suggests that it plays an important role in the spread of influenza (24) or may even be the dominant way of transmission. (25) Certainly, the different features of droplets and aerosols may affect these types of transmission, thus influencing also the expected mask efficiency in either case.

For example, the volume of a particle with diameter 5 \u03bcm is 1,000 times smaller than the volume of a droplet of 50 \u03bcm, and thus likely contains a proportionally smaller number of virus particles.
