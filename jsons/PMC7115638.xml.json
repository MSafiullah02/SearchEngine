            "text": "West Nile Virus (WNV) is a mosquito-borne, neurotropic member of the genus flavivirus, family Flaviviridae, and has been identified in Africa, Europe, the middle East, south and central Asia, Oceania (subtype Kunjin), and most recently North America (reviewed in [1]). In the U.S. WNV activity in human, bird, companion animals or mosquito has been reported since 1999 to the Centers for Disease Control (CDC) from almost all states. Besides WNV, the genus flavivirus comprises a number of medically important pathogens including Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV), yellow fever virus (YFV), tick borne encephalitis virus (TBEV) and the four serotypes of dengue virus (DENV) [2]. The flavivirus genome is a positive-polarity, single-stranded RNA molecule of about 11,000 nucleotides (nt), which functions as mRNA for translation of the viral proteins. Genomic RNA is infectious when introduced into susceptible cells by transfection [3]. For replication and pathogenesis studies, reverse genetic systems have been established for several members of the genus [4], [5], [6], [7], [8], [9], [10], [11], [12], [13], [14], [15], [16], [17], [18], [19], [20]. These systems comprise one or two plasmids encoding cDNA of viral genomic sequence under control of bacteriophage promoters allowing transcription of full-length infectious RNA in vitro. For YFV [4], DEN-1 [17], DEN-2 [6], [8], [10], DEN-4 [11], TBEV [13], [15], KUN [9], MVE [7] and WNV lineage I [19] and II [21], cDNA comprising the full genome was stably cloned into bacterial expression plasmids, whereas in other reports [5], [8], [13], [18], [20] cDNA was split in two fragments, each integrated in individual plasmids, from which cDNA can be fused together before RNA transcription. An alternative approach was applied to construct a JEV infectious clone, in which the viral coding sequence was put under the control of a eukaryotic promoter and split by introns to circumvent instability during propagation in bacteria [22].",

These approaches are sometimes hampered by low fidelity of reverse transcriptase or sequence variations in the starting isolate, which may lead to undesired alterations of the genomic sequence. As a consequence, in most reports in which the viral cDNA clones or generated viruses were analyzed by sequence analysis, nucleotide variations were detected compared to the published sequence of the parent virus [6], [7], [9], [13], [14], [16], [19].",

The viral cDNA encoding the 7.5 kb genome was assembled from overlapping oligonucleotides and yielded infectious virus after transcription of genomic RNA and inoculation into cell lysates [23]. Taking advantage of the rapid progression of gene synthesis technology (for review [24]), we intended to adopt such a synthetic approach to produce a flavivirus cDNA system for the generation of a synthetic WNV seed virus for use in vaccine development. In this study we report the generation of a fully functional WNV virus from a completely synthetic source. The whole 11,029-nucleotide WNV genomic sequence was generated by gene synthesis without using natural viral templates. The production and characterization of the resulting West Nile Virus, which fully matched the sequence of the in silico designed viral genome, confirms the feasibility and accuracy of the synthetic flavivirus reverse genetic system.",

The six synthetically generated WNV subfragments were ligated stepwise, resulting in two plasmids with corresponding parts of the complete genomic WNV sequence. For this purpose, either unique restriction sites in the WNV sequence were used, or \u2013 where appropriate \u2013 asymmetric restriction sites were generated in the plasmid vector backbone adjacent to the WNV fragments. Cleavage of these asymmetric sites created overhangs in the WNV sequence by which corresponding fragments could be fused together.

Viral protein expression was monitored with a specific polyclonal mouse anti-WNV antibody and a FITC-conjugated second antibody (see Section 2). Cells infected with MOI 0.0001 of WNVwt and were used as staining control. WNVsyn-transfected and WNVwt-infected Vero cells exhibited WNV protein expression in approximately 20% of all cells. As expected, viral antigen staining is mainly confined to perinuclear regions of the cells (Fig. 2).

This virus is plaque-purified, viral RNA is isolated, transcribed into cDNA which is amplified by PCR and in turn gets assembled into a DNA copy of the viral genome. These approaches bear the risk of introducing mutations selected via plaque purification steps. To minimize this type of mutations we chose to generate a reverse genetics system using a different approach, independent of preformed viral RNA components and animal sources. The feasibility of generating such systems by chemical synthesis of DNA was proven previously, for instance, by the generation of poliovirus [29], bacteriophage \u03d5X174 [30] or H1N1 Spanish influenza virus [31], and SARS-like coronavirus [32]. On the basis of these studies, we report for the first time the generation of an 11,000 nucleotide long synthetic genome of a member of the family Flaviviridae.

Dark gray boxes represent the viral structural and light gray boxes the nonstructural part of the coding sequence. The 5\u2032 and 3\u2032 noncoding regions (NCR) are indicated as thin lines. (a) Six WNV sequence segments were generated by gene synthesis (vector backbones are not shown). The 5\u2032TL AB segment is corresponding to WNV genomic sequence nt 1\u20131792, 5\u2032TL CD to nt 1789\u20133632, segment 3\u2032TL AB to nt 3622\u20135801, 3\u2032TL CD to nt 5792\u20138028, 3\u2032TL EF to nt 8022\u201310,025 and 3\u2032TL GH to nt 10,022\u201311,029. (b) Fragments 5\u2032TL AB and 5\u2032TL CD were ligated yielding the final 5\u2032 partial clone insert (5\u2032TL) and two 3\u2032 part fragments were generated by fusing fragments 3\u2032TL AB with 3\u2032TL CD and 3\u2032TL EF with 3\u2032TL GH. (c) Final partial clones, integrated in pBR322, are indicated. The 3\u2032 partial clone was generated by ligation of the 3\u2032TL ABCD with the 3\u2032TL EFGH insert, taking advantage of the unique SpeI restriction site.",
