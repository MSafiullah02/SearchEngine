Informed written consents to participate were collected during the hospital stay from caregivers for most of the children and from children aged \u226512 years. Some children with RTI were enrolled after hospital discharge after passive consent; caregivers received written information, and children were included if the caregivers did not resist enrollment by contacting the hospital within 2 weeks. In addition, we enrolled some children with acute HMPV infection, who were available for analyses of HMPV shedding time. These children were sampled during the hospitalization period and regularly after discharge during home or outpatient visits, and until the HMPV test results turned negative. We systematically collected baseline characteristics from a questionnaire filled out by caregivers. Clinical information was abstracted from medical records, and Regional Committees for Medical and Health Research Ethics, Central Norway, approved the study.",

In all, 222 HMPV-positive specimens (83%) were genotyped using real-time PCR and DNA sequencing by primers targeting the F gene of HMPV [18], as described elsewhere [4]. Some NPA samples were not typeable owing to low viral loads, and others were not available. Phylogenetic comparisons were performed of F gene sequences of 169 isolates from patients and 36 GenBank sequences representing each of the 5 described HMPV subtypes (A1, A2a, A2b, B1, and B2). Multiple sequences were aligned using MUSCLE (version 1) and Clustal W (version 1.2.2) software (available for free from http://www.ebi.ac.uk/).

            "text": "On average, HMPV was detected in 7.3% of all children admitted with RTI during the whole period, but it varied considerably from only 2.6% to 12.4% per season. Most previous studies from countries in the Northern hemisphere measured the occurrence over shorter periods but found relative similar figures and seasonal variations [1, 3, 8, 13\u201315]. HMPV appeared mostly from January to April and regularly caused outbreaks lasting a median of 5 months, peaking in the winter months. Smaller outbreaks with a median duration of 2.5 months occurred during the spring and early summer months and coincided with a reduction in the total number of children admitted with RTIs. In addition, the occurrence of HMPV from January to March was quite similar in both odd and even years, in contrast to observations from southern Europe, with alternating epidemics in winter and spring-summer every other year [15, 34]. We speculate as to whether this difference may reflect the colder climate in our country compared with southern Europe [35]. RSV outbreaks occurred in every season, lasted an average of 5 months, and most often peaked in January to March. As reported elsewhere, HMPV outbreaks appeared before, overlapping with, or after RSV outbreaks [5].",

Children in the youngest age groups had higher rates. We used a strict definition of severe HMPV infection, including only children with a hospital stay \u226524 hours and LRTI, which might explain why our estimates differ from those 3 US studies including a broader spectrum of respiratory infections, which reported estimated hospitalization rates of 1.0\u20131.2 per 1000 children <5 years old [1, 20, 21]. Two European studies reported HMPV-related hospitalization rates comparable to ours. A study from Spain [23], based on 3 seasons, reported that 2.6/1000 children <3 years old were hospitalized, and in a single-season study from the United Kingdom [22] the reported hospitalization rate was 1.3/1000 children <6 years old. Our finding of a higher hospitalization rate in children 12\u201323 months old differ with the findings in all previous studies [1, 20\u201323] and may also relate to our strict inclusion criteria. The hospitalization rates of children with RSV-related LRTI in our study were in line with findings from previous Norwegian [36], European [37, 38] and American studies [39, 40], thereby confirming that HMPV causes hospitalization less often than RSV in Europe and the United States.",

A few percent had a positive PCR test with high Ct levels, thus corresponding to low viral loads, but all were virus negative by culture. We also studied a group of children with HMPV infection with repeated specimens sampled, who had low Ct values (high viral loads) and a high rate of positive cultures initially. During the progress of the disease, these children improved clinically, viral loads gradually decreased and all became virus negative by culture after 13 days. Despite these changes, half of the children were still virus positive by PCR test after 13 days and all were virus negative only after 28 days. Taken together, our observations and those of others [1, 30, 31, 41, 42], suggest that a positive PCR test for HMPV in healthy children is unlikely to indicate an asymptomatic infection, and we speculate whether it instead indicates the presence of small amounts of viral nucleic acids after a previous HMPV infection. Others [41, 43] have demonstrated a 2\u20133-week-long shedding time in children with RSV infection, which, in a similar way may explain the low detection rate of RSV at low viral levels in the present study\u2019s controls.",

Previous research has shown that most children become seropositive during the first 5 years of life [44], and data from experimental studies suggest that certain HMPV subtypes may not stimulate an adequate immune response in all cell types [45]. However, our clinical data indicate that healthy children usually develop a robust immunity against most HMPV subtypes during childhood. On the other hand, outside a hospital setting, others have shown that HMPV may still cause recurrent mild RTI in children [46] and adults [47].

All known HMPV subtypes circulate in Norway, except A1. Children are rarely hospitalized twice with HMPV infection. Children have a short HMPV shedding time and may not be infectious after 13 days, and the short shedding time may also explain the low HMPV detection rate among asymptomatic children.",
