            "text": "Programmed ribosomal frameshifting (PRF) is a recoding event that leads to a change of the translational reading frame and allows the translation of messenger RNAs (mRNAs) with overlapping open reading frames, often yielding two protein products from one mRNA. PRF is particularly frequent in the decoding of mRNAs from viral and mobile genes but is found also in some cellular genes in all domains of life. During PRF, the reading frame may shift in +1, \u20131, or even \u20132 direction. The mechanisms of +1 and \u20131PRF appear to be quite different and require a different set of stimulatory elements. The classic example of \u22121PRF is slippage triggered by two elements in the mRNA, a \u201cslippery sequence\u201d (Jacks et al., 1988) and a downstream secondary structure element (Brierley et al., 1989). The slippery site is made up by sequences such as X XXY YYZ, where XXY and YYZ are codons in the original frame (0 frame) that presumably favor tRNA sliding on the mRNA and anticodon misalignment, changing the codons to XXX and YYY in the \u20131 frame. The stimulatory secondary structure elements of the mRNA, which usually consist of a stem loop or a pseudoknot located at a particular distance downstream of the slippery sequence, may enhance \u20131PRF by inducing pausing of the ribosome or by perturbing normal decoding. In some cases, \u20131PRF is additionally stimulated by a Shine-Dalgarno (SD)-like sequence in the mRNA located at a particular distance upstream of the slippery sequence (Larsen et al., 1994). Sequence comparison and molecular genetic analysis of a variety of frameshifting sequences identified canonical structures that can cause \u20131PRF in both bacterial and eukaryotic systems, although details of how the pro- and eukaryotic ribosomes respond to frameshifting signals may be different (Brierley et al., 2010, Dinman, 2012, Farabaugh, 1997, Fayet and Pr\u00e8re, 2010, Gesteland and Atkins, 1996).",

            "text": "The mechanism of \u20131PRF is not clear, and there are at least four groups of models as to when and why it occurs (Figure 1\nA). The slippage can take place during translocation as the ribosome enters the slippery site, when deacylated tRNA is bound at the codon (nnX) preceding the slippery sequence and peptidyl-tRNA at the XXY codon (pept-tRNAXXY) (Bekaert and Rousset, 2005, L\u00e9ger et al., 2007) (Figure 1A, pathway I). Alternatively, the shift may occur during the accommodation of aminoacyl-tRNAYYZ on the ribosome after reading the second slippery codon YYZ by tRNAYYZ and/or following peptidyl transfer with two tRNAs at the slippery site (Harger et al., 2002, Jacks et al., 1988, Plant et al., 2003) (pathway II). Several models propose cotranslocational shifting of pept-tRNAYYZ with or without concomitant slippage of deacylated tRNAXXY as the ribosome exits the slippery site (Farabaugh, 1996, Horsfield et al., 1995, Namy et al., 2006, Weiss et al., 1989, Yelverton et al., 1994)\u2014i.e., when the XXY YYZ mRNA sequence moves from the P and A to the E and P sites, respectively (pathway III). Finally, it has been suggested that frameshifting might occur during the accommodation of tRNA after the slippery sequence or as a result of competition between the tRNAs decoding the 0 and \u20131 frame codons (L\u00e9ger et al., 2004, Yelverton et al., 1994) (pathway IV). Although there is evidence for and against each of these models, recent kinetic models predicted that \u20131PRF is simultaneously accessible through several pathways governed by the kinetic parameters of aa-tRNA binding, peptide bond formation, and translocation (Liao et al., 2011). However, these kinetic constants are not known for any \u20131PRF system. This prompted us to establish a fully reconstituted in vitro translation system to study real-time kinetics of \u20131PRF and to identify the steps that control frameshifting. Here, we report the results of the analysis, which include the kinetics of stepwise translation of the slippery sequence, the kinetics of amino acid incorporation into 0 and \u20131 frame translation products, and the detailed kinetics of the translocation reactions that govern \u20131PRF.",

The construct used for in vitro translation contained codons for fMet and Tyr followed by the slippery site and a pseudoknot (Figure 1B). The native IBV 1a/1b slippery sequence, U UUA AAC, was replaced with U UUA AAG, which results in a higher \u20131PRF efficiency in E. coli (Brierley et al., 1997, Napthine et al., 2003). This slippery sequence is decoded by tRNALeu (anticodon 3\n\u2032AAU5\u2032) and tRNALys (anticodon 3\n\u2032UUU5\u2032), resulting in the synthesis of fMetTyrLeuLysPhe (MYLKF) in the 0 frame and fMetTyrLeuLysVal (MYLKV) in the \u20131 frame. In addition to the frameshifting mRNA construct that contained both slippery sequence and pseudoknot (designated as +/+), a set of model mRNAs was generated that had different combinations of stimulatory elements\u2014i.e., had only the slippery sequence but lacked the pseudoknot (+/\u2212), no slippery sequence but the pseudoknot (\u2013/+), or lacked both stimulatory elements (\u2013/\u2013). To disrupt the slippery sequence, the UUA codon was replaced with UUG, which is decoded by the same tRNALeu (3\n\u2032AAU5\u2032). Additional mRNA constructs used as controls are described in Extended Experimental Procedures.",

Translation of consecutive codons was measured after mixing 70S initiation complexes programmed with one of the model mRNAs and containing f[3H]Met-tRNAfMet in the P site with excess of ternary complexes, EF-Tu\u2013GTP\u2013aa-tRNA, formed with purified individual Tyr-, Leu-, [14C]Lys-, Phe-, and Val-tRNA, and EF-G\u2013GTP (Figure 1C). The formation of translation products in 0 frame or \u20131 frame was monitored using the quench-flow technique. After the desired incubation time, the reaction was quenched, and the products were analyzed by high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) (Figure S1\nA available online). Concentrations of aa-tRNAs and Elongation Factor G (EF-G) were optimized to achieve the maximum translation rate (Figures S1B\u2013S1H). With the control \u2013/\u2013 mRNA, which lacked slippery sequence and pseudoknot, the major end product was MYLKF, which is consistent with the fifth codon of the 0 frame specifying Phe (Figure 1D). Likewise, when the fifth codon in the 0 frame specified Val, mostly MYLKV peptide was formed (Figure 1E). In contrast, with mRNA constructs containing only the slippery sequence (+/\u2212), only the pseudoknot (\u2013/+), or both elements together (+/+), both 0-frame (MYLKF) and \u20131 frame (MYLKV) peptides were produced (Figures 1F\u20131H), with \u20131PRF taking place on up to about 75% of ribosomes on +/+ mRNA (Table 1\n).",

The efficiency of \u20131PRF was calculated as the ratio of relative Rluc/Fluc synthesis in \u20131 and 0 frames. The Rluc/Fluc ratio for \u20131 frame translation in the absence of the two \u20131PRF stimulatory elements was considered as background and subtracted from all other \u20131 frame values obtained in the presence of stimulatory elements; thus, by definition, the efficiency of \u20131PRF in the \u2013/\u2013 construct is set to 0, and the reported values for the +/+, +/\u2212, and \u2013/+ constructs represent lower-limit estimates for \u20131PRF. When both slippery sequence and pseudoknot were present, the relative efficiency of Rluc synthesis in the \u20131-frame was 78% (Table 1). This value is somewhat higher than the previously reported frameshifting efficiency of 40% on a similar mRNA construct (Brierley et al., 1997) but is consistent with our results obtained in vitro. For \u20131PRF in E. coli, the requirement for a pseudoknot structure in IBV 1a/1b is not strict (Brierley et al., 1997). In our construct, the removal of either the pseudoknot or the slippery sequence reduced \u20131PRF to 23% and 36%, respectively, which is in reasonable agreement with the in vitro results (Table 1).",

The initial simplest kinetic model included individual sequential steps for the incorporation of Tyr, Leu, and Lys and a branch allowing for the alternative incorporation of Phe (0 frame) or Val (\u20131 frame) (Extended Experimental Procedures). The MY peptide was formed rapidly in a one-step fashion at a rate of about 10 s\u22121 (Table 2\n). Fitting the time courses of MYL formation to a simple model with only two steps (for the incorporation of Tyr and Leu, respectively) did not yield a satisfactory solution and required including a delay between the formation of the MY and the MYL peptides (Figures 1D\u20131H and S1G). This additional step presumably reflects the first translocation event, which displaces tRNAfMet from the P site and moves MY-tRNATyr from the A to the P site; the rate of that translocation event was around 2 s\u22121 independent of the mRNA construct (Table 2), which is consistent with earlier reports on the rate of translocation involving initiator tRNAfMet (Dorner et al., 2006). We expect that, after the first round of translocation, the SD-aSD interaction is weakened or resolved, as it is destabilized after the formation of the first peptide bond (Uemura et al., 2007). The subsequent incorporation of Leu was rapid, about 15 s\u22121. The next step, incorporation of Lys, followed a one-step mechanism MYL\u2192MYLK with a rate of around 5 s\u22121.",

Similarly, if pathway II were operational, then frameshifting signals would change the kinetic characteristics of tRNALys accommodation, resulting in altered rates of Lys incorporation. The kinetic analysis shows that the rates of Tyr, Leu, or Lys incorporation and the rate of the first translocation were independent of the presence of \u20131PRF-stimulatory elements in the mRNA (Table 2). Thus, it is unlikely that \u20131PRF takes place through pathways I and II. In contrast, the incorporation of Phe (0 frame) and Val (\u20131 frame) was strongly affected by the presence of the slippery sequence and the pseudoknot (Table 2), which is predicted by the pathway III scenario in which slippage occurs during translocation over the XXY YYZ sequence. In the absence of \u20131PRF stimulatory elements (\u2013/\u2013 mRNA), the rate of Phe or Val incorporation in the 0 frame was 4\u20135 s\u22121, compared to 0.2 s\u22121 (Val) or 0.09 s\u22121 (Phe in the \u20131 frame), i.e., translation in 0 frame was strongly favored kinetically. The pseudoknot inhibited translation in both \u20131 and 0 frames, whereas the slippery sequence dramatically increased the rate of Val incorporation in the \u20131 frame. Together, the two stimulatory elements led to a faster incorporation of Val in the \u20131 frame than of Phe in 0 frame (Table 2). These results suggest that \u20131PRF is kinetically governed by the reactions that follow Lys incorporation into the nascent peptide but precede the incorporation of Val or Phe.",

Accommodation of BOP-Lys-tRNALys was observed as a fluorescence decrease with a rate of about 2 s\u22121, independent of the frameshifting signals (Figure S3).

If slippage occurred at that step, the presence and relative concentrations of Val-tRNAVal and Phe-tRNAPhe should influence the efficiency of \u20131PRF. This was tested by adding Val-tRNAVal and Phe-tRNAPhe in different ratios (4:1 or 1:4) or omitting one of the two during the translation of +/+ mRNA (Table S1). The data indicate that the efficiency of amino acid incorporation in the 0 or \u20131 frames was not affected by the presence or absence of the aa-tRNA decoding the alternative reading frame. This suggests that, at the time of Phe or Val decoding, the fraction of ribosomes that have switched to the \u20131 frame was already fixed. The slippage must have occurred after decoding the Lys codon in the 0 frame but before the Phe or Val codons are read. The most likely explanation for this observation is that \u20131PRF occurs during the translocation of tRNALeu and MYLK-tRNALys which are both bound to their codons in the slippery sequence, i.e., through pathway III.",

            "text": "One potential reason for inaccurate translocation during \u20131PRF may be an altered interaction of EF-G with the ribosome, which could lead to prolonged pausing at the pseudoknot. To examine this possibility, we measured the rate of EF-G binding to and dissociation from the ribosome using a fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) reporter assay with a FRET donor (Alexa 488, Alx) placed on ribosomal protein L12, which is known to recruit translation factors to the ribosome, and a nonfluorescent FRET acceptor (QSY9) in the G domain of EF-G (Figure 2\nA). The fluorescence labels did not affect the translation rates or the efficiency of \u20131PRF (Table S2). To study specifically the translocation of tRNAs bound to the slippery sequence, we prepared L12-labeled ribosome complexes with MYL-tRNALeu in the P site. The reaction was initiated by adding EF-Tu\u2013GTP\u2013Lys-tRNALys and QSY-labeled EF-G\u2013GTP in a stopped-flow apparatus, and the recruitment of EF-G(QSY) was monitored by a decrease of L12(Alx) fluorescence due to quenching upon complex formation. The interaction is maintained until the end of translocation when EF-G is released, which leads to fluorescence recovery (Figure 2B). The rate constants of EF-G binding and dissociation estimated by numerical integration, which took into account the Lys incorporation step preceding translocation (Table S2), suggested that EF-G binding to the ribosomes in the absence of the pseudoknot (\u2013/\u2013 and +/\u2212 mRNA constructs) was rapid (>10 s\u22121) and limited by the preceding Lys decoding step; from experiments with simplified model systems, the rate of EF-G binding is expected to be about 60 s\u22121 (C. da Cunha, A. Lehwess-Litzmann, F.P., and M.V.R., unpublished data). In the presence of the pseudoknot, EF-G binding was somewhat slower, 4.8 s\u22121, regardless of the presence of the slippery sequence but clearly not rate limiting for the following translocation steps. In contrast, EF-G dissociation was much slower when the pseudoknot was present (Figure 2C); the dissociation rate (3 s\u22121 from ribosomes translating \u2013/\u2013 or +/\u2212 mRNAs) was reduced >15-fold to 0.2 s\u22121 when both \u20131PRF stimulatory elements were present (Table S3). Furthermore, the latter rate was very similar to the rate of Val incorporation in the \u20131 frame (0.3 s\u22121), suggesting that decoding of the next codon in the \u20131 frame is rate limited by EF-G dissociation. Dissociation of EF-G from ribosomes translating the \u2013/+ mRNA was even slower (<0.1 s\u22121; Figure 2C) and comparable to slow decoding of the next codon both in \u20131 and 0 frames (Table 2). These data indicate that (1) the pseudoknot causes delayed EF-G release and (2) \u20131PRF is induced while EF-G is still bound to the ribosome. In comparison, EF-G binding and dissociation upon translocation of tRNATyr and MYL-tRNALeu were very similar on \u2013/\u2013 and +/\u2212 mRNAs (Figure 2B) and too fast to be resolved kinetically.",

            "text": "Translocation is a dynamic process that entails movements of two tRNAs together with the mRNA from the A to P to E site coupled to the rotation of the 30S and 50S ribosomal subunits relative to one another and to a movement of the 30S head. To understand when exactly the change in the reading frame takes place, we measured the rates of several individual motions of tRNAs during translocation. We first examined whether MYLK-tRNALys moved from the pretranslocation state (PRE) to the posttranslocation state (POST) using a time-resolved puromycin (Pmn) assay. High Pmn reactivity is indicative of the positioning of pept-tRNA in the POST state on the 50S subunit, as, in comparison, the Pmn reactivity of pept-tRNA in both classical or hybrid PRE states is very low (Semenkov et al., 1992, Sharma et al., 2004). Translation was initiated in the quench-flow apparatus as described above (Figure 3\nA). After different incubation periods, Pmn was added in saturating concentration, and the reaction was quenched after 0.5 s. This fixed time is sufficient for the completion of the Pmn reaction of pept-tRNA in the POST state; therefore, the increase of the Pmn reactivity over time reflects the movement of MYLK-tRNALys from the PRE to the POST state on the 50S subunit. The apparent reaction rate, as estimated by numerical integration, was about 7 s\u22121, independent of \u20131PRF elements (Figure 3B), suggesting that the movement of the pept-tRNA from the A to P site on the 50S subunit is not altered by frameshifting, and therefore, the slippage is likely to occur later than the movement of MYLK-tRNALys into the Pmn-reactive state. The value of 7 s\u22121 is the lower limit for the rate constant of A to P site translocation because the rate of the Pmn reaction itself contributed to the observed rate.",

            "text": "Movement of MYLK-tRNALys to the POST state on the 50S subunit implied that tRNALeu should have vacated the P site on the 50S subunit and moved toward the E site. To test this directly, we prepared ribosome complexes containing MYL-tRNALeu labeled with fluorescein (Flu) at position 8 (Figure 4\nA). Introducing the fluorescence label did not affect the rates of translation (Table S2). By adding EF-Tu\u2013GTP\u2013Lys-tRNALys and EF-G\u2013GTP, one round of Lys incorporation and translocation was induced, which resulted in the displacement of tRNALeu(Flu) from the P site, as manifested in a decrease of fluorescence (Figure 4B). After the completion of this step, tRNALeu(Flu) may reside in the E site or dissociate into solution (Chen et al., 2013, Uemura et al., 2010). In comparison, when Val-tRNAVal and Phe-tRNAPhe were added together with Lys-tRNALys, decoding of two consecutive codons (regardless in which frame) and two translocation events should completely displace tRNALeu from the ribosome, thereby providing a measure for the maximum fluorescence change associated with tRNALeu(Flu) movement from the P site to the solution. The apparent rates of elemental reactions were estimated by numerical integration, taking into account the rates of Lys incorporation (Table S2) and EF-G binding steps (Figure 2 and Table S3), which as such do not lead to fluorescence changes of tRNALeu(Flu). In the absence of \u20131PRF stimulatory elements, the fluorescence of tRNALeu(Flu) changed rapidly, with a predominant rate of about 9 s\u22121 (Figures 4B, 4D, and 4H and Table S3), reflecting rapid tRNA movement toward the POST state. The additional step, at 3 s\u22121, contributed relatively little to the fluorescence change (Figure 4H) but was required to obtain satisfactory fits. The dissociation of tRNALeu(Flu) from ribosomes translating \u2013/\u2013 mRNA was not monitored as a separate step, as the fluorescence changes observed after one or two translocation rounds were not significantly different (Figures 4B and 4H).",

The rapid step likely reflects the movement of tRNALeu(Flu) concomitantly with the movement of MYLK-tRNALys into the Pmn-reactive POST state on the 50S subunit, which, in the following, we refer to as POST1. The step with the rate of 0.9 s\u22121 was significantly slower than the lower limit for the rate of movement into the Pmn-reactive POST1 step (7 s\u22121) and therefore constitutes a separate, second step during which tRNALeu moves further to a POST2 state and the tRNALeu(Flu) fluorescence decreases. The rate of tRNALeu dissociation from the ribosome was about 0.2 s\u22121, as estimated from the kinetic differences between one and two rounds of translocation (Figures 4C, 4D, and 4I; see also below).",

The FRET assay measures the timing of tRNALeu release from its P site position on the 30S subunit. Introducing the quencher did not affect the kinetics of translation (Table S2). As in the experiments described above, we prepared ribosome complexes carrying S13(AttoQ) (Cunha et al., 2013) and MYL-tRNALeu(Flu) in the P site and mixed them with Lys-, Val-, and Phe-tRNA bound to EF-Tu\u2013GTP and EF-G\u2013GTP (Figure 4A). Translocation on the \u2013/\u2013 mRNA resulted in a fluorescence increase (reduced FRET) due to the movement of tRNALeu away from S13 (Figure 4E). After Lys-tRNALys and EF-G recruitment, there was a rapid small FRET change, taking place at a rate of about 9 s\u22121, which coincided with the rate of the transition reported by tRNALeu(Flu), and a major FRET change that took place at 3 s\u22121, concomitantly with EF-G dissociation (Figure 4H and Table S3). This suggests the following mechanism of translocation when there is no \u20131PRF: following EF-G binding to the PRE complex, tRNALeu and MYLK-tRNALys moved at a rate of 9 s\u22121 through POST1 to POST2 states; those two states cannot be distinguished in the experiments with \u2013/\u2013 mRNA. The extent of FRET between tRNALeu(Flu) and S13(AttoQ) did not change at this stage, suggesting that the head of the subunit moved together with the tRNA. The interaction between tRNALeu and the 30S head was released at a later step, which proceeded at a rate of 3 s\u22121 and likely represented the backward rotation of the 30S head. This movement coincided with the dissociation of EF-G (Table S3) and resulted in the formation of the POST3 state (Figure 5\nA).",

            "text": "Taken together, the kinetic data lead us to the following model of \u20131PRF (Figure 5B). The ribosomes are committed to either 0 or \u20131 frame during translocation of the two tRNAs bound to the slippery sequence. Based on the assignment of the kinetic steps (Figures 3 and 4), we assume the existence of the following different intermediate positions of tRNALeu: POST1, which forms by the movement of MYLK-tRNALys from PRE to POST on the 50S subunit (Pmn reaction); POST2, which leads to the major change in tRNALeu(Flu) fluorescence; and POST3 corresponding to the movement of protein S13 away from tRNALeu. Formation of POST1 is rapid and takes place independent of frameshifting signals (Figure 3). The rates of the following reactions are different on the \u2013/\u2013 and +/+ mRNAs, suggesting that partitioning between the reading frames is likely to happen at this step, with 75% of ribosomes continuing translation in the \u20131 frame (Table 1). For the partitioning model, the observed value of 0.9 s\u22121 obtained by model-free fitting of individual time courses (Table S3) represents the sum of the rate constants of ribosomes moving in the 0 and \u20131 frames, whereas the ratio between these two rate constants defines the efficiency of \u20131PRF. This yields a rate constant of 0.7 s\u22121 for the ribosomes, which shifted into the \u20131 frame, compared to 0.2 s\u22121 for those that remained in the 0 frame (Figure 5B). The following movement of the 30S head away from tRNALeu (transition from POST2 to POST3) was also slow, 0.2\u20130.3 s\u22121 in the \u20131 frame. This transition coincided with the release of EF-G (0.2 s\u22121) (Table S3) and limited the rate of Val-tRNAVal incorporation (0.3 s\u22121, cf. Table 2). The rate of the POST2 to POST3 transition in the 0 frame could not be measured directly because the fraction of ribosomes remaining in the 0 frame was too small. However, assuming that also Phe-tRNAPhe incorporation was limited by the transition from POST2 to POST3, the rate of that transition should be about 0.1 s\u22121 (cf. Table 2). To validate the rates of each elemental step and to ensure that all data collectively are consistent with the model, we combined the time courses reflecting the kinetics of EF-G binding and dissociation (Figure 2 and Table S3), as well as tRNALeu movement (Figure 4 and Table S3) with the kinetics of Lys, Val, and Phe incorporation, and performed global fitting of the data on the basis of the model depicted in Figure 5B using a unifying set of rate constants. The results of global fitting yielded a solution that was in perfect agreement with all measured kinetic data (Figure 4J) and provided the values for the rate constants that determine the efficiency of \u20131PRF (Figure 5B).",

            "text": "The present kinetic analysis of \u20131PRF indicates that the \u20131 slippage occurs at a late step of tRNA translocation when two tRNAs are still bound to the slippery sequence of the mRNA (Figure 5). EF-G binding to the PRE complex with tRNALeu and MYLK-tRNALys drives a rapid movement of both tRNAs into a POST state on the 50S subunit, rendering MYLK-tRNALys reactive with Pmn. This notion is consistent with the results of recent single-molecule fluorescence studies that suggest that the translocation of the A site tRNA, as monitored by FRET to ribosomal protein L11, is not affected by the presence of a downstream pseudoknot (Chen et al., 2013). Our data further suggest that the head of the 30S subunit moves together with the tRNAs because the distance between FRET labels in tRNALeu and protein S13 does not change at this stage. Thus, the conformation of the ribosome in the state where \u20131PRF occurs may resemble a chimeric state with tRNAs in pe/E and ap/P states (Ramrath et al., 2013), although the degree of intersubunit rotation and 30S head swiveling/tilting may be different. A recent single-molecule study suggested that, in the presence of the frameshift-inducing dnaX hairpin, the ribosomal subunits are driven into a hyperrotated state with the L1 stalk in a predominantly open conformation (Qin et al., 2014). In our system, EF-G remains bound to the ribosome, engaged in an attempt to complete translocation; however, the backward rotation of the 30S head is inhibited by the pseudoknot, which could also explain why the E site tRNA is not released (this paper and Chen et al. [2013]). The action of EF-G and possibly the chimeric state of the ribosome appear to destabilize codon-anticodon interactions (Fredrick and Noller, 2002), which can then repair in either 0 or \u20131 frame. Apparently, slippage to the \u20131 frame is favorable, as those ribosomes that switched to the \u20131 frame can complete translocation and release EF-G about three times faster than those remaining in the 0 frame, which determines partitioning between the \u20131 and 0 frames and efficiency of \u20131PRF (Figure 5).",

However, in contrast to the original simultaneous-slippage model, which proposed that \u20131PRF occurs prior to peptide bond formation, our data suggest that the slippage takes place during translocation, as originally suggested by Atkins and Gesteland (Weiss et al., 1989), with EF-G bound to the ribosome during pausing at the pseudoknot (Namy et al., 2006). We note that, although simultaneous slippage during translocation appears to be predominant in our model system, other \u20131PRF pathways may be favored depending on the length of the slippery sequence and the structure of the mRNA secondary structure element. Furthermore, mutations of the ribosome, translation factors, or tRNAs that alter the kinetics of translation reactions or impairing ribosome functions with antibiotics may also alter the rate-determining step of frameshifting, thereby introducing alternative routes for \u20131PRF (for reviews see Brierley et al., 2010, Dinman, 2012, Farabaugh, 1997, Fayet and Pr\u00e8re, 2010, Gesteland and Atkins, 1996). Further kinetic analysis will be necessary to show which pathway for \u20131PRF is predominant in other systems, such as dnaX, HIV-1, or SARS-CoV.",

This provides a biochemical interpretation for the cryo-EM reconstruction of the eukaryotic frameshifting complex stalled at the pseudoknot in the absence of the slippery sequence. In that complex, a single tRNA apparently occupied the P site (a chimeric position of the small ribosomal subunit head could not be seen due to insufficient resolution), the tRNA appeared to be deformed, and the translocase (eEF2, the eukaryotic homolog of EF-G) interacted with the tRNA (Namy et al., 2006). In contrast to that structure, we find that the E site tRNA remains bound to the ribosome during \u20131PRF, which is consistent with the recent single-molecule (Chen et al., 2013) and previous biochemical studies (Horsfield et al., 1995). In the POST2 state, the codon-anticodon interaction in the E site may be weakened or dissolved (Lill and Wintermeyer, 1987), which may contribute to the high efficiency of \u20131PRF and explain why the E site tRNA appears to be bound to a near-cognate codon after shifting into the \u20131 frame (this paper and Brierley et al. [1997]) and dissociate upon sample dilution in cryo-EM experiments (Namy et al., 2006). Our data also predict that mutations of the E site should affect \u20131PRF (Devaraj et al., 2009, L\u00e9ger et al., 2007, McGarry et al., 2005, Sergiev et al., 2005) by altering the kinetic parameters of slippage, e.g., by changing the stability of pe/E site tRNA binding or affecting the dynamics of the ribosome subunits in the chimeric state.",

EF-G binding and the resulting destabilization of codon-anticodon interactions may allow a portion of the ribosomes to re-pair in the alternative frame within the short EF-G residence time on the ribosome, thus resulting in a rapid translation in either 0 or \u20131 frame. In the presence of the pseudoknot, the slippery sequence specifically enhances the \u20131 frame translation due to faster (about 5-fold) completion of the translocation step as monitored by EF-G release.

            "text": "With both stimulatory elements present, the slippery sequence provides the necessary freedom for the ribosome to change its position with respect to the pseudoknot, allowing for the completion of translocation and continuation of translation in the new frame. The position of the pseudoknot relative to the slippery sequence appears to play a central role in \u20131PRF (Lin et al., 2012). We note that realignment of the ribosome in the \u20131 reading frame would place the pseudoknot at the ribosomal helicase active site formed by ribosomal proteins S3, S4, and S5 at position +11 of an mRNA bound to the ribosome (counting from the first nucleotide of the P site codon) (Takyar et al., 2005). One attractive hypothesis is that the precise ribosome positioning allows the helicase to act on the mRNA roadblock. This mechanism may work in both pro- and eukaryotic systems, as helicase residues in S3 and S5 are evolutionary conserved. In line with this hypothesis, frameshift efficiency is primarily determined by the stability of base pairs positioned at the mRNA entrance channel of the ribosome (Mouzakis et al., 2013). Our experiments suggest that \u20131 slippage allows for a 3-fold faster movement of the ribosome through the pseudoknot base. This suggests that the exact position of the secondary structure element relative to the translocating ribosome has a kinetic effect on unwinding, underscoring the important role of an active helicase mechanism in mRNA unwinding (Qu et al., 2011).",

            "text": "Translocation is a highly dynamic process that entails movements of tRNAs, mRNA, and EF-G, rotation of the ribosomal subunits relative to one another, 30S head swiveling and tilting, and motions of ribosomal elements, such as proteins L1 and L12. The present results provide insights into the nature of the rate-limiting steps that govern the stepwise motion of the tRNA-mRNA complex through the ribosome (Figure 5). In the PRE state, the anticodons of the two tRNAs occupy the P and A sites of the 30S subunit, whereas the tRNA 3\u2032 ends on the 50S subunit are dynamic, allowing for different tRNA positions in classical, hybrid, or intermediate states. Binding of EF-G accelerates the rate-limiting ribosome unlocking step, which is followed by rapid translocation both on the 50S and 30S subunit to a state that is a Pmn-reactive POST state with respect to pept-tRNA (analogous to POST2 in Figure 5) (Cunha et al., 2013, Holtkamp et al., 2014, Savelsbergh et al., 2003). The next kinetically distinct step of translocation is the backward movement of the 30S head (Cunha et al., 2013, Guo and Noller, 2012), which takes place concomitantly with the dissociation of EF-G and the E site tRNA and results in the movement of mRNA by one codon. mRNA secondary structures are usually resolved by the unwinding activity of the ribosome (Takyar et al., 2005, Wen et al., 2008). If the ribosome mechanically pulls apart the mRNA strands of the closed junction (Qu et al., 2011), it is likely to do so at a late state of translocation when the 30S subunit head rotates backward.",

Fluorescein-labeled tRNALeu was prepared according to published protocols (Milon et al., 2007, Wintermeyer et al., 1979). tRNATyr, tRNALeu (reading the UUA/UUG codon), tRNALys, and tRNAVal were prepared from bulk E. coli tRNA by consecutive column chromatographies on Sepharose 4B (GE Healthcare), Phenyl Sepharose (GE Healthcare), and DEAE Toyopearl (Tosoh Bioscience) (Holmes et al., 1975). Aminoacylation of purified tRNAs with 14C-labeled and unlabeled amino acids was performed as described (Kothe et al., 2006), and aa-tRNAs were purified by reversed-phase HPLC on a WP 300 RP-18 HPLC column (250 mm x 10.5 mm, Merck) equilibrated with buffer (20 mM ammonium acetate, pH 5.0, 10 mM magnesium acetate, 400 mM NaCl) using a gradient of 0%\u201315% ethanol.

BOF-Lys-tRNALys was prepared as described (Mittelstaet et al., 2013). Expression, purification, and refolding of S13 were carried out as described (Hickerson et al., 2005). Labeling of S13 with Atto540Q and reconstitution of 30S subunits were performed according to published protocols (Cunha et al., 2013). The 30S subunits were labeled to more than 90%, as determined photometrically. 70S ribosomes carrying L12 labeled at position 118 with Alx488 were prepared as described (Mohr et al., 2000, Savelsbergh et al., 2005). Labeling of EF-G with QSY9 was performed by incubating EF-G containing a His6-tag and a single engineered Cys at position 209 (Wilson and Noller, 1998) with a five-fold excess of QSY9-maleimide in labeling buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 70 mM NH4Cl, 30 mM KCl, 7 mM MgCl2, 300 mM NaCl) in the dark at 4\u00b0C overnight. Affinity purification of labeled EF-G by the C-terminal His-tag was carried out using a Protino gravity-flow column (Macherey-Nagel) (Cunha et al., 2013). The protein was concentrated and stored in buffer A with 50% glycerol. The concentration of EF-G(QSY9) was calculated from the absorbance at 280 nm.Rapid KineticsQuench-flow experiments were performed in buffer A at 37\u00b0C using a KinTek RQF3 apparatus. Translation experiments were performed by rapidly mixing initiation complexes (0.2 \u03bcM after mixing) with the respective ternary complexes as indicated (1.5 \u03bcM) and EF-G (2 \u03bcM). Reactions were quenched by the addition of KOH (0.5 M), and peptides were released by hydrolysis for 30 min at 37\u00b0C. After neutralization with acetic acid, samples were analyzed by HPLC (LiChroSpher100 RP-8 HPLC column, Merck) using an adapted gradient of acetonitrile in 0.1% TFA. The elution positions of the reaction products were determined using a set of peptides synthesized in vitro (f[3H]Met[14C]Tyr, f[3H]MetTyr[14C]Leu, f[3H]MetTyrLeu[14C]Lys, f[3H]MetTyrLeuLys[14C]Phe, or f[3H]MetTyrLeuLys[14C]Val). The extent of product formation was determined from the ratio of f[3H]Met in the respective peaks to the total 3H-radioactivity in the eluate.Time courses were evaluated by numerical integration using the Micromath Scientist software according to the following model:A\u2192kTyrB\u2192kTlMYC\u2192kLeuD\u2192kLysEkPheG\u2197\u2198kValHWhere k\nTyr, k\nLeu, k\nLys, k\nPhe and k\nVal are rate constants of incorporation of the respective amino acids into the peptide and k\nTl MY is the rate of the 1st translocation event. The fraction of ribosomes that did not react was taken into account by the respective concentration correction parameters. Standard deviations of the values determined by global fitting are indicated in Tables 2, S1, S2, and S3.The Pmn assay was carried out in buffer A at 37\u00b0C. Initiation complexes (0.2 \u03bcM after mixing) were first incubated with ternary complexes as indicated (1.5 \u03bcM; with 14C-labeled Lys) and EF-G (2 \u03bcM) for different times and then rapidly mixed with Pmn (1 mM), incubated for another 0.5 s, and finally quenched with KOH (0.5 M) in the collection tube. After hydrolysis and neutralization, samples were analyzed by HPLC.Fluorescence experiments were carried out in buffer A at 37\u00b0C using a stopped-flow apparatus (SX-20MV; Applied Photophysics). Labeled ribosomes, tRNAs, and EF-G were used as indicated. Alx488 and Flu fluorescence was excited at 470 nm and detected after passing a KV500 cut-off filter (Schott). Equal volumes of post-translocation complexes carrying MYL-tRNALeu in the P site were rapidly mixed with ternary complexes as indicated (0.25 \u03bcM) and EF-G (1 \u03bcM). At least seven individual traces were averaged and evaluated by numerical integration using the Micromath Scientist software. Evaluation of individual time courses was carried out by numerical integration as indicated in the caption of Table S3. Because such fitting requires that some values are fixed during fitting (see caption of Table S3), we also performed global fitting of all time courses together, which does not require that any particular value is fixed and validates the overall consistency of the calculated values. For the global fitting of translocation, the following time courses were combined: FRET change upon interaction of EF-G(QSY9) with L12(Alx488) (Figure 2C); fluorescence intensity change upon translocation of tRNALeu(Flu) (Figure 4C); and FRET change upon movement of tRNALeu(Flu) relative to S13(AttoQ) upon addition of Lys-tRNALys alone or together with Phe-tRNAPhe and Val-tRNAVal (Figure 4E). The following kinetic model was used:POSTLeu\u2192kLysPRELys\u2192kEFGPREEFG\u2192kTl1POST1kTl2PhePOST2(0)\u2192kTl3PhePOST3(0)\u2192kPhePREPhe\u2197\u2198kTl2ValPOST2(\u22121)\u2192kTl3ValPOST3(\u22121)\u2192kValPREValwhere k\nLys, k\nPhe, and k\nVal are the incorporation rates of the respective amino acid; k\nEFG is the rate of EF-G binding; k\nTl1 is the rate of movement into the chimeric state where MYLK-tRNALys becomes Pmn-reactive; k\nTl2 for Phe and Val are the rates of rearrangements reported by the label in tRNALeu; k\nTl3 for Phe and Val are the rates leading to completion of translocation; PRE and POST states refer to the respective pept-tRNA in the A site (PRE) or P site (POST) (Table S4).

In the absence of \u20131PRF stimulatory elements (\u2013/\u2013 mRNA), EF-G binds rapidly to the PRE complex (step 1). Subsequently, the tRNAs move into a chimeric state in which both deacylated tRNA and pept-tRNA move relative to the 50S subunit into a Pmn-reactive state (POST1/2), whereas their contacts with the 30S subunit are not disrupted (step 2). In step 3, tRNALeu detaches from the 30S head, probably during the backward 30S head rotation, and EF-G is released (POST3). Step 4, EF-Tu\u2013GTP\u2013Phe-tRNAPhe binds to the A site, and Phe is incorporated into the peptide. (B) Kinetic partitioning during \u20131PRF. The slippage occurs during translocation of the two tRNAs bound to the slippery sequence (tRNALeu and MYLK-tRNALys). Recruitment of EF-G (step 1) to the PRE complex facilitates rapid tRNA movement (step 2) into a chimeric state (POST1); however, the following steps are inhibited by the presence of the pseudoknot. Further movement of tRNALeu proceeds in two steps. First, tRNALeu moves on the 50S subunit into a POST2 state while the distance to the 30S subunit is not changed (steps 3 and 6 in 0 frame and \u20131 frame, respectively). Second, tRNALeu and the 30S subunit move apart (steps 4 and 7) into a POST3 state. Steps 3 and 4 are particularly slow for the tRNA that remains in 0 frame, which limits the rate of the following Phe-tRNAPhe binding (step 5). In contrast, tRNALeu movement on those ribosomes which switched to the \u20131 frame, is faster (step 6), followed by dissociation of tRNALeu from the 30S subunit, 30S head rotation, and dissociation of EF-G (step 7) and binding of Val-tRNAVal (step 8).",
