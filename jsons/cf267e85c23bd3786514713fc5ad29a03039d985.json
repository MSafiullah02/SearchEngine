SARS-CoV-2 was detected in multiple nasopharyngeal, blood, and pleural samples, despite antiviral and immunomodulator treatment. Clinical evolution in the blood was marked by an increase (2-3 fold) in differentiated effector T cells expressing exhaustion (PD-1) and senescence (CD57) markers, an expansion of antibody-secreting cells, a 15-fold increase in \u03b3\u03b4 T-cell and proliferating NK-cell populations, and the total disappearance of monocytes, suggesting lung trafficking. In the serum, waves of a proinflammatory cytokine storm, Th1 and Th2 activation, and markers of T-cell exhaustion, apoptosis, cell cytotoxicity, and endothelial activation were observed until the fatal outcome. This case underscores the need for well-designed studies to investigate complementary approaches to control viral replication, the source of the hyperinflammatory status, and immunomodulation to target the pathophysiological response.",

Such a severe clinical condition displayed by certain patients affected with COVID-19 pneumonia are strongly reminiscent of previous and recent epidemic cases of respiratory failure associated with related coronaviruses, such as MERS-CoV and SARS- CoV 3 In more severe cases, infection can cause pneumonia, severe acute respiratory syndrome, kidney failure, and even death 3 . Death results from hypoxemic respiratory failure in patients developing severe acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and is associated, in a substantial portion of patients, with an inflammatory syndrome and cytokine storm 4 that may originate from immune cells 5 . Severe and critical COVID-19 pneumonia shares features with \"cytokine storms\", such as those seen in severe cytokine-release syndrome, which is characterized by fever, hypotension, and respiratory insufficiency associated with elevated serum cytokine levels, including those of IL-1 and IL-6, mostly produced by myeloid cells 6 .",

However, experimental drugs and drug combinations, such as Hydroxychloroquine, Remdesivir, Lopinavir-Ritonavir, or a combination of Lopinavir-Ritonavir and interferon-\u03b2 -1b, are under investigation and may be considered for compassionate use for severely ill patients. Given the severity of the case, we tried various approaches, including an antiviral therapy and an immune therapy. Remdesivir did not accelerate the clearance of the virus from our patient. Coronaviruses are able to inhibit the interferon signaling pathways, which are, like those of T cell-mediated immunity, required for viral clearance 27 . Animal models and case reports suggest that the type-1 interferon-mediated response triggered by MERS-CoV may limit the viral disease to the lung and prevent systemic dissemination and viremia 28, 29 . It is impossible to draw any conclusion on the effect of IFN-\u03b2 in our case. Of note, we observed a dramatic decrease of IL-1RA from day 15 to day 22, contrasting with the persistence of high IL-1\u03b1 and \u03b2 expression. This discordant expression profile contrasts with preliminary observations in less critically ill patients (personal data). Although these All rights reserved. No reuse allowed without permission.",

Nevertheless, we believe that this case report supports the worldwide effort to repurpose several marketed drugs and immunomodulators to reduce the inflammatory reaction and pathophysiology caused by the virus 30 . First, it clearly shows that the immune alterations are dynamic. In the first phase, the innate immune system, driven by monocytes, macrophages, and T\u03b3\u03b4 lymphocytes, is activated and leads to T-lymphocyte exhaustion. The activation of B lymphocytes then contributes to a substantial humoral response. Finally, we observed endothelial activation. Overall, this individual case also underscores the need to combine two complementary approaches to limit the severity of the disease: to control viral replication with an antiviral, with the aim to limit the source of hyperinflammation, and to potentiate this effect using a specific immune modulator that targets the cytokine storm as a trigger of the pathophysiological response. These interventions should be evaluated in welldesigned studies. This longitudinal analysis may help to determine the timing of such interventions and provide tools for the clinical follow-up of patients.",

The lack of knowledge of the pathophysiology of this new infection, the severity of the cases, and the absence of confirmed therapies have been critical challenges for all physicians and intensivists since the beginning of this year. In an epidemic context, it is crucial to rapidly improve our understanding of the disease to better manage patients and to share knowledge on the most severe cases and learn from them. From a clinical prospective, the presentation of a COVID-19 infection resembles a typical community-acquired severe respiratory infection that occurs one week after the onset of nonspecific flu-like symptoms, but exhibiting a wider range of severity than MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV-1 infections 11,12 . The reason for such marked heterogeneity in individual sensitivity to COVID-19 and the potential roles of ageing and comorbidities, beyond their association with clinical worsening, are poorly understood. The patient described in this report exhibited a rapid and fatal evolution towards multiorgan failure, with long and sustained persistence of SARS-CoV-2 nasopharyngeal shedding associated with viral RNA detection in multiple blood and pleural effusion samples.

An in-depth longitudinal analysis of the immune profiles of our case showed dramatic alterations in the homeostasis of all blood cell populations, reflecting severe disturbances in innate and adaptive immunity. Some are highly compatible with an uncontrolled viral infection, as exemplified by an increase (2-3-fold) of most differentiated effector memory CD4 + and CD8 + T cells.

This observation is compatible with previous reports in convalescent health workers infected with SARS-CoV-1, who exhibited an expansion of V\u03b39V\u03b42 T cells able to inhibit SARS-CoV replication and kill SARS-CoV-infected target cells20 . In our patient, the \u03b3\u03b4 T cells expressed activation markers (CD16) but only low levels of the inhibitory receptor NKG2A, suggesting that they may have exhibited a killing capacity. Analyses of the T-cell repertoire and functional profile of these cells need to be performed in a larger cohort of patients.Along with these T cell populations, NK cells and monocyte/macrophages in the lung are at the first line of defense against pathogens. These cells produce a large array of proinflammatory cytokines. The high level of NK-cell proliferation and their disappearance from the blood suggest trafficking to the lung, which may contribute to lung-cell cytotoxicity. Three populations of monocytes, CD14 + CD16 -, CD14 + CD16 + , and CD14 -CD16 + , were at low or undetectable levels, also suggesting trafficking to the lung 21 . CD14 + (CD16 + /CD16 -) cells have been shown to be capable of producing IL-8, IL-6, TNF-\u03b1, and IL-1 after activation, whereas CD14 dim CD16 + cells represent a monocyte subset that patrols blood vessels and selectively detects virally infected and damaged cells to produce proinflammatorycytokines 22 . Wei et al. recently reported the presence of inflammatory CD14 + CD16 + monocytes, suggesting an excessive activated immune response caused by pathogenic GM-CSF + Th1 cells, possibly linking them to the pulmonary immunopathology that leads to deleterious clinical manifestations after COVID-19 infections 23 .",

For example, elevated levels of IL-2, IL-7, IL-10, G-CSF, IP-10, MCP-1, MIP1-\u03b1, and TNF-\u03b1 have been reported in SARS-CoV-2 patients in intensive care 3 . Increased Th17, cytotoxic markers 24 , IL-6 25 , IP-10, MCP-3, and IL-1RA 26 also appear to be associated with disease severity and fatal outcome in SARS-CoV-2-infected patients. Our data significantly extend these observations by the longitudinal survey of these changes. The various waves of markers suggest different stages, from a proinflammatory cytokine storm and Th1 and Th2 activation to T cell exhaustion, apoptosis, and cell cytotoxicity. It is difficult to correlate these features with clinical worsening from a single case, but a careful follow-up of these profiles in patients in ICUs may help to identify new prognostic markers or those of COVID-19 severity.",
