Signs and symptoms may include tachypnea, cough, dyspnea, retractions, grunting, hypoxemia, abdominal pain, or lethargy, and physical examination findings of decreased breath sounds, crackles, rales, or wheezing on auscultation of lung fields. Many of these findings overlap with other acute lower respiratory tract diseases (eg, asthma and viral bronchiolitis), and identifying children with pneumonia based only on clinical signs and symptoms is sometimes difficult. As a result, chest radiographs are commonly used to confirm the diagnosis. Even when a chest radiograph reveals an infiltrate, however, it is sometimes difficult to differentiate between consolidation representing pneumonia and atelectasis commonly seen in children with asthma or bronchiolitis. As a result, variation in chest radiograph interpretation is common and may contribute to antibiotic overuse.7, 8 For this reason, the guideline developed by the Pediatric Infectious Diseases Society (PIDS) and Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA) discourages use of chest radiographs in children with suspected uncomplicated pneumonia in an outpatient setting.7 Chest radiographs are recommended in children who are hospitalized with hypoxemia or respiratory distress and in those with suspected complications, such as parapneumonic effusions, necrotizing pneumonia, or pneumothorax (Fig. 1\n).",

Bronchoalveolar lavage is rarely indicated in CAP, except in instances of lack of response to therapy, very severe pneumonia, or immunocompromised hosts in whom opportunistic pathogens are suspected.41 Sputum cultures are of low diagnostic yield in children, due to the inability of most young children with pneumonia to produce an adequate sputum sample. Pretreatment with antibiotics further hinders diagnostic yield. Induced sputum has been explored as an opportunity to collect sputum samples in young children, although utility is limited by frequent detection of upper respiratory tract bacteria and similar rates of recovery of pathogens in pneumonia cases compared with children without pneumonia.42, 43\n",

            "text": "Up to two-thirds of children younger than 5 years are colonized in the upper respiratory tract with common bacterial pathogens known to cause pneumonia,51 and PCR from the upper respiratory tract is not a reliable method for ascertaining bacterial etiologies of pneumonia. A possible exception is M pneumoniae, which has not previously been considered a frequent colonizer of the upper respiratory tract. Consistent with this theory, the CDC EPIC study demonstrated that although M pneumoniae was detected in 8% of children with pneumonia, fewer than 1% of controls had evidence of M pneumoniae.4 In contrast, a cross-sectional, observational study in the Netherlands of asymptomatic children and children with symptoms of upper and lower respiratory tract infection detected M pneumoniae DNA not only in 16% of symptomatic children but also in 21% of asymptomatic children.52 Given the conflicting results of these 2 studies and the increasing commercial availability of M pneumoniae PCR tests, caution is warranted when interpreting test results in the clinical setting.",

            "text": "In contrast to bacteria, PCR testing for viruses from upper respiratory samples has largely replaced culture and serology-based methods to investigate pneumonia etiology, owing to superior sensitivity, rapid turnaround time, and ability to identify viruses that are difficult to grow in culture. A major concern, however, is whether lower respiratory tract disease can be attributed to a viral pathogen detected in the upper airway. The scope of the problem is well illustrated in a study conducted by Self and colleagues53 that compared PCR detections of 13 viruses from the upper respiratory tract among 1024 children with CAP and 759 healthy, asymptomatic children enrolled in the CDC EPIC study. Overall, approximately 25% of asymptomatic children had 1 or more viruses detected compared with approximately 65% of children with CAP. Detection of most viruses was higher among children with CAP compared with asymptomatic controls, including influenza (3% vs 0%), RSV (27% vs 2%), and human metapneumovirus (15% vs 2%), with attributable fractions greater than 90% for all. Conversely, rhinovirus was detected at a similar frequency in both children with CAP and asymptomatic children (22% vs 17%; attributable fraction 12%; 95% CI, 18% to 34%). Attributable fractions for other viruses studied ranged from 44% to 68%. Thus, although some viruses detected in the upper airway likely reflect lower airway disease (eg, RSV, influenza, and human metapneumovirus), detection of other viruses must be interpreted with caution. As proposed for adults, investigating viral loads may further help to differentiate disease versus asymptomatic colonization.54\n",

Vaccination against Haemophilus influenzae type b and Streptococcus pneumoniae has greatly reduced invasive disease rates caused by these pathogens, and the introduction of molecular diagnostics has highlighted the important role that respiratory viruses play in disease pathogenesis while also introducing new challenges. This updated understanding brings into question whether all children with CAP would benefit from antibiotic therapy, and if so, which therapies might be most effective. Limitations of current diagnostics, however, impede advances toward addressing these important questions. Biomarkers and host responses to infection are current areas of intense study that may facilitate a deeper understanding of pneumonia etiology and disease outcomes. As this important work progresses, future epidemiologic studies using state-of-the-art diagnostics will continue to serve an important role in informing understanding of the changing epidemiology of CAP.",
