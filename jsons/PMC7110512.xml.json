Outside breeding and farrowing periods, the females and young were kept in one or sometimes two separate areas. Adult boars were most commonly held in a separate, smaller enclosure. During the breeding season in late autumn/early winter, selected boars were housed with the adult sows. There was some variation in sow management during the farrowing season. The majority of farms divided late-gestation sows into smaller groups of animals familiar to each other. However, this approach was not practiced particularly in Southern Finland where animal numbers were larger. Piglets/young animals were generally housed initially with their dam, and then with other adult sows and their offspring until time of slaughter. Two farms in Eastern Finland specialised in growing/finishing animals (slaughter type farm). Vaccination was not practiced on any of the farms.",

There was no evidence of exposure to a wide range of pathogens suggesting farmed European wild boar do not pose a significant risk of transmitting disease to domestic pigs. Our seroprevalence data for PPV and PCV2 are at the higher end of previously reported results for these pathogens. Vicente et al. (2004) compared PCV2 antibody prevalences among free-living, fenced, and intensively managed wild pigs and found an increasing seroprevalence with intensification. The fact that the boars in the current study were intensively managed may explain the higher prevalence of antibodies in this study compared to serological surveys of feral pigs.",

Evidence of exposure to L. intracellularis was higher than that previously reported and may be due to differences in the methods of diagnosis: surveys reporting prevalences up to 19% used PCR analysis on tissue or faecal samples (Jacobson et al., 2005, Dezorzova-Tomanova et al., 2006, Phillips et al., 2009) and these were from free-living rather than farmed boars.",

Following statistical modelling, animal density was not found to be a significant variable in the exposure of boar to either PPV or L. intracellularis, indicating that the effect of farm size is not mediated through animal density.

Since the seroprevalence to SIV was low in domestic pigs and wild boars sampled prior to 2009, it was not surprising that we did not find antibodies to this virus.
