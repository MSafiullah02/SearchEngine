For example, corn zein, wheat gluten and sorghum (Sorghum bicolor) kafirin are soluble only in aqueous ethanol. Soy, peanut, common bean, cottonseed and rice bran proteins are soluble in water and alkaline water. Like all other physical and chemical properties, the solubilities of native proteins also depend on their constituent amino acid residues. Krochta (2002) Plant proteins, such as soybean protein and corn zein, need a small quantity of plasticizer to weaken the intra-and inter-peptide cross-linking and attractive forces and to reduce the brittleness and stiffness in the films and coatings. Plasticizers are low molecular weight and low volatility substances that work as spacers to reduce the strength of intermolecular attractive forces and lower the glass transition temperature of amorphous or partially crystalline protein films. Generally, plasticizers increase the molecular flexibility and extensibility but decrease elasticity, mechanical resistance and barrier properties of protein films and coatings (Gounga et al. 2007) . Water is the most effective plasticizer in biopolymer materials, enabling them to undergo glass transition at a lower temperature as well as facilitating deformation and processability of the biopolymer matrix (Hernandez-Izquirdo and Krochta 2008) . Besides water, common plasticizers for films include monosaccharides, oligosaccharides (sucrose), polyols (glycerol, sorbitol, propylene glycol and polyethylene glycol or polyethylene oxide), lipids (stearic acid) and their derivatives (Table 9 .2) (Sothornvit and Krochta 2005) .

These measurements are made by clamping the film between the jaws of a tensometer and applying a strain at a fixed linear rate to the sample and measuring the stress. The resulting stress-strain curves can be used to calculate the tensile strength (TS), elastic modulus (EM), yield point and break point of the film ( Fig. 9 .1). Tensile strength and EM are usually expressed in pascals (Pa); one pascal is equal to one newton (1 N) of force applied over one metre squared (1 m 2 ). Strain, which is the geometrical measure of deformation, is expressed in percent elongation (E) and represents the relative displacement between particles in the material body (Jacob 2008) . The EM measures the stiffness of the film (Banker 1966). It is calculated by drawing a tangent to the initial linear portion of the stress-strain curve ( Fig. 9 .1), selecting any point on the tangent curve and dividing the tensile stress by the corresponding strain. Yield strength is the amount of stress at which the film starts to plastically deform. Prior to the yield point, the film deforms elastically and will return to its original shape and size when the stress is released (Dieter et al. 2003) . Tensile strength at break point is the amount of force per unit of the original cross-sectional area to pull the film to point where it breaks (Banker 1966) .

The tensile properties of films are affected by protein composition (Table 9 .3), protein concentration, amount of plasticizer, pH, ionic strength and heating temperature (Sze et al. 2007) . Attractive forces between proteins in the protein film matrix, including hydrogen bonds between backbone amino and carbonyl groups to stabilize \u03b1-helix and \u03b2-sheet secondary structures within the proteins and to form links between protein molecules, or with the plasticizer (Choi et al. 2003) , van der Waals forces or electrostatic forces among polymer chains (Takashi et al. 2007) , ionic interactions or salt linkages or bridges between oppositely charged functional groups of amino acids in protein side chains and disulphide (S -S) bonds within and between different protein chains (Subirade 1998; Sang et al. 2000) , allow the development of a film matrix from denatured protein. During the film drying period, water is progressively eliminated, and protein conformations change, including the degree of protein unfolding, which determines the types and numbers of bonds that establish interactions between proteins (Denavi et al. 2009; Mauri and Anon 2006) .

High levels of plasticizer weaken the attractive forces in film networks and dramatically reduce film stiffness but elevate elongation properties (Tables 9.6 and 9.7). Different types and amounts of plasticizers interact differently even within a single polypeptide chain. For example, studies of soy protein films plasticized with glycerol revealed that there were two glass transition temperatures, indicating that the films contained two microdomains that interacted differently with glycerol (Chen and Zhang 2005) . The presence of these domains suggests that protein and glycerol are not uniformly compatible across the polymer chains, but there is a preferential linking between protein polymer regions and glycerol molecules. Usually, higher Sze et al. (2007) quantities of plasticizers reduce mechanical and barrier properties (Cuq et al. 1997) . Extensive research efforts have been focused on modifying the properties of proteinbased films to improve their mechanical and barrier properties for industrial applications (Rhim 2004; Rhim et al. 1999 Rhim et al. , 1998 Micard et al. 2000; Gennadios et al. 1993 Gennadios et al. , 1998 Ghorpade et al. 1995; Park et al. 1993 ). Film age also affects its properties. Over a period of time, protein films can change chemically and/or physically. Chemical changes such as oxidation degrade the protein chains, while glycerol plasticizer has the tendency to migrate to the film surface (Anker et al. 2001) with the passage of time and water in the film also evaporates. These changes reduce the intermolecular spaces between proteins, which facilitate attractive forces to increase cross-linking and make the film harder and also more brittle (Kim et al. 2002) .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 571, "end": 592, "text": "(Chen and Zhang 2005)", "ref_id": "BIBREF11"}, {"start": 824, "end": 841, "text": "Sze et al.

The physical and chemical properties of the adhesive, the type of adherents and the nature of the surface pretreatments are important factors in glue performance, in the short and long terms. To make initial molecular contact, adhesives have the ability to wet and spread evenly on the surfaces of the materials one wishes to joint. Once that is achieved, intrinsic attractive forces are generated across interfaces through a number of mechanisms including adsorption (occurs when adhesive molecules are attracted to a specific site on a solid surface through weak van der Waals forces or chemisorption through covalent bonding), mechanical interlocking (occurs when the adhesive flows into pores or solidifies around the projections), interdiffusion (occurs when the adhesive dissolves and diffuses into the substrate material) and electrostatic attractions (occur when electrons are transferred across the interface, thus creating positive and negative charges that attract one another).

Protein adhesives are used in antique furniture and old religious texts. These adhesives have excellent flexibility and nonwarp characteristics, as well as permanent and tenacious adhesion. They are watersoluble, easy to clean up, nontoxic, eco-friendly, biodegradable, recyclable and repulpable. Protein adhesives have some limitations, however, such as a lack of specific adhesion on coatings and nonporous surfaces and sensitivity to temperature and humidity changes. The use of plant proteins as adhesives is more recent with soy protein-based adhesives widely used between 1930 and 1960. However, they were completely replaced thereafter by cheaper and stronger synthetic adhesives. Today, soy protein alone, or in combination with animal proteins such as casein, gelatin and blood proteins, is used to produce adhesives that are widely used as glues in paper, book binding, packaging, furniture and wood industries (Frihart 2009; Lambuth 2003) . Generally, protein adhesives have sufficient strength in dry conditions but are susceptible to moisture and mould (Lambuth 2003) . The nature of the protein determines the formulation, mixing and application of the adhesive. The manufacturing steps, however, are common and include grinding dry protein extracts to glue particle sizes (typically with surface areas between 3000 and 6000 cm 2 per gram), sufficiently dispersing the ground proteins in alkaline water for maximum binding efficiency and addition of fungicide (such as sodium orthophenylphenate, sodium pentachlorophenate, copper-8-quinolinate or copper naphthenate) to prevent mould.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 111, "end": 125, "text": "(Lambuth 2003;", "ref_id": "BIBREF53"}, {"start": 126, "end": 143, "text": "Imam et al. 2013)", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1208, "end": 1222, "text": "(Frihart 2009;", "ref_id": "BIBREF23"}, {"start": 1223, "end": 1236, "text": "Lambuth 2003)", "ref_id": "BIBREF53"}, {"start": 1353, "end": 1367, "text": "(Lambuth 2003)", "ref_id": "BIBREF53"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Protein Adhesives"}, {"text": "Adhesive durability has been a problem for protein glues. Several protein modifications including physical, chemical and enzymatic treatment are used to enhance the functional properties of protein adhesives such as bonding strengths and environmental and moisture resistance. Treatment of proteins with organic or inorganic alkali, such as sodium hydroxide or trisodium phosphate, breaks the internal hydrogen bonds of protein molecules, unfolds the protein structure and exposes the polar functional groups of the amino acid residues for adhesion to binding surfaces such as wood (Brother et al. 1940; Lambuth 2003) . The combination of alkali treatment and mild heating of the protein in deionized water breaks the inter-and intramolecular protein hydrogen and disulphide bonds and unfolds the protein structure to improve the adhesive and viscosity and hydrophobic properties of the glues (Graham and Krinski 1983) . For example, soy protein heated at 50 \u00b0C and a pH of 10.0 improved adhesive strength by 118% and the hydrophobic properties of soy protein glues by 92% . The amount of alkali in the protein adhesives depends on the usage in the final product. For example, high-alkali (Table 9 .10) soy protein adhesives prevent glue swelling, maintain glue viscosity and improve moisture resistance by forming insoluble proteinates (Laucks and Davidson 1928). However, it also burns wood cellulose and causes reddish-brown stains on wood surfaces (Truax 1929). On the other hand, low-alkali soy protein adhesives are less dispersive and have lower bonding strengths. This makes them good for paper and softboard lamination, but not for structural usage such as sheathing plywood (Sheeran 1957; Lambuth 2003) . Furthermore, salt treatment of disulphide bondcontaining proteins, such as soy protein, results in cleavage of the disulphide bonds and unfolded protein structures, which improves the viscosity of glues without reducing adhesive strengths and water resistance at certain concentrations.

These networks improve the adhesive and moisture resistance properties of proteinbased glues. For example, soy protein modified with urea and guanidine hydrochloride increases the average shear strengths in walnut (Juglans spp.), cherry (Prunus spp.) and pine plywoods by 34 and 37%, respectively. In addition, both urea and guanidine hydrochloride-modified soy protein exhibited 100% moisture resistance.

The global industrial enzyme market will be as high as $7 billion by 2015 (http://www.prweb.com/releases/industrial_enzymes/proteases_carbohydrases/prweb8121185.htm), according to Global Industry Analysts (Hood and Requesens 2012) . These commercial enzymes, including proteases, amylases, cellulases, xylanases, lipases and reduction/oxidation enzymes are utilized by many industries, such as the manufactures of detergent, pulp and paper, textile, chemical, feed, food, biofuels and bio-based products (Hood and Requesens 2012) . Currently, the largest markets for technical enzymes are the pulp and paper, food and beverage and animal feed industries (https://www.freedoniagroup.com/World-Enzymes. html). These may be replaced, however, by the lignocellulosic-supported biofuel and bio-based product industry market in the near future since large quantities of enzymes, including cellulases, hemicellulases and ligninases, will be required to deconstruct feedstock materials (Hood and Requesens 2012) .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 519, "end": 541, "text": "(Nykiforuk et al. 2006", "ref_id": "BIBREF72"}, {"start": 1154, "end": 1179, "text": "(Hood and Requesens 2012)", "ref_id": "BIBREF38"}, {"start": 1453, "end": 1478, "text": "(Hood and Requesens 2012)", "ref_id": "BIBREF38"}, {"start": 1927, "end": 1952, "text": "(Hood and Requesens 2012)", "ref_id": "BIBREF38"}], "ref_spans": [{"start": 290, "end": 298, "text": "(Table 9", "ref_id": "TABREF0"}], "section": "Plant Crops as Platforms for Speciality Protein Products"}, {"text": "In 2011, the US Department of Agriculture approved the first commercial-scale production of Enogen, a transgenic corn plant developed by Syngenta US to express \u03b1-amylase. Enogen eliminates the need to use liquid \u03b1 -amylase in dry-grind ethanol production (Table 9 .13). Another industrial enzyme, bovine trypsin (a protease) is widely used for commercial purposes to digest other pharmaceutical proteins. This enzyme can be expressed in the corn grain (Woodard et al. 2003 ) and has been marketed by Sigma Chemicals, USA, with the trade name TrypZean. TrypZean produced in plant-based systems could replace other production systems such as animal cell cultures to eliminate the chances of human pathogen contamination of the enzyme preparation. Several plant crops (Table 9 .13) including tobacco, Arabidopsis, potato, rice, alfalfa, canola, pea, barley, soybean, wheat and corn are being investigated to produce commercial enzymes such as amylase, glucanase, xylanase, phyrase and chymosin (Hood and Requesens 2012; Biesgen et al. 2002) . Besides enzyme purity, the commercial viability of these products depends on several factors including the cost and demand for the product. Like any other system, plant platforms also display certain challenges, such as low accumulation of some proteins, difficult purification, biological equivalence, regulatory status and consumer acceptance. Other possible challenges are the potential for horizontal dissemination of transgene(s) to other plants through pollen grains, especially for open-pollinated crops, such as corn, and the contamination of plant tissues and protein products with pesticides, herbicides and toxic plant metabolites (Fitzgerald 2003) .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 452, "end": 472, "text": "(Woodard et al. 2003", "ref_id": "BIBREF120"}, {"start": 991, "end": 1016, "text": "(Hood and Requesens 2012;", "ref_id": "BIBREF38"}, {"start": 1017, "end": 1037, "text": "Biesgen et al. 2002)", "ref_id": "BIBREF7"}, {"start": 1682, "end": 1699, "text": "(Fitzgerald 2003)", "ref_id": null}], "ref_spans": [{"start": 255, "end": 263, "text": "(Table 9", "ref_id": "TABREF0"}, {"start": 765, "end": 773, "text": "(Table 9", "ref_id": "TABREF0"}], "section": "Plant Crops as Platforms for Speciality Protein Products"}, {"text": "Plant-based systems require methods of purification that are different from other systems, such as mammalian cells. Protein fusion technology is being tested to overcome two significant challenges of plant-based systems, namely, low accumulation of the protein and difficulty in terms of purification. In this approach, the DNA encoding the target protein is fused with DNA sequences encoding targeting peptides, stabilizing sequences, elastin-like proteins, hydrophobins and prolamine seed storage proteins (\u03b3-zein), amino acid affinity tags or oil bodies (Conley et al. 2011) . Both SemBioSys (no longer trading) and Plant Farm Corp. have developed technologies that combine the high-capacity, low-cost production of therapeutic proteins in seeds with a novel technology that simplifies downstream purification. In this instance, the genes encoding the target proteins are fused with a sequence encoding a small protein called oleosin. The resulting fusion protein accumulates on oil bodies within the seed. These oil bodies and the oleosin/protein fusion are then simply purified from other components in ground seeds by centrifugation because they float. The protein is released from the oil bodies into an aqueous extraction solution by enzymatic digestion of the oleosin/protein linker, and initial purification is accomplished without expensive chromatography. Research in the last decade has overcome many of the technical challenges that have delayed the application of molecular pharming. Good manufacturing practices for plant-derived proteins are in place, with an emphasis on the containment of therapeutic protein in a particular tissue/organ of the plant such as seed, sustainability in production and similarity to mammalian cell-derived therapeutic protein.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 557, "end": 577, "text": "(Conley et al. 2011)", "ref_id": "BIBREF15"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Plant Crops as Platforms for Speciality Protein Products"}, {"text": "Indeed, some plant-derived therapeutic proteins are already on their way to commercialization as described in the Table 9 .14.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [{"start": 114, "end": 121, "text": "Table 9", "ref_id": "TABREF0"}], "section": "Plant Crops as Platforms for Speciality Protein Products"}, {"text": "Environmental concerns and consumer awareness have been driving forces for the reintroduction of protein-based bioproducts to the market.
