Current evidence suggests that closely related species are more susceptible to infection by a given virus or strain than more distantly related hosts (Read & Taylor 2001; Faria et al. 2013; Longdon et al. 2014), because they provide a similar cellular environment to which the pathogen is adapted. However, there are viruses where this does not apply (e.g. Greenwood et al. 2012; Shi et al. 2014). Adaptation of virus attachment proteins to the cell receptor used by viruses to gain entry to host cells can alter virus spread across host species and has resulted in epidemics in novel hosts (Moya et al. 2004; Allison et al. 2014; Shi et al. 2014).",

            "text": "Canine distemper virus (CDV) belongs to the genus Morbillivirus (family Paramyxoviridae). CDV has a nonsegmented, single\u2010stranded, negative\u2010sense RNA genome with six genes that produce six structural proteins. The nucleocapsid protein (CDV\u2010N) encapsidates the viral RNA, and the phosphoprotein (CDV\u2010P) together with the large protein (CDV\u2010L) form the transcriptase/replicase complex. The CDV\u2010P gene also expresses two nonstructural proteins, the CDV\u2010C and CDV\u2010V proteins. One function of the CDV\u2010V protein is to suppress the innate immune response of hosts (von Messling et al. 2006; R\u00f6thlisberger et al. 2010). The haemagglutinin protein (CDV\u2010H) and the fusion protein (CDV\u2010F) facilitate virus entry and the matrix protein (CDV\u2010M) is important for the budding of virus particles (Lamb & Kolakofsky 2001). As the CDV\u2010H gene is the most diverse gene in the Morbillivirus genus (Pomeroy et al. 2008), it is used to segregate strains into lineages (Bolt et al.1997; Martella et al. 2006), whereas the CDV\u2010L and CDV\u2010M genes are more conserved than other genes in the Paramyxoviridae (McCarthy & Goodman 2010). The long untranslated region (UTR) between the CDV\u2010M and F genes (M\u2010F UTR) modulates virulence through transcriptional control of CDV\u2010F gene expression (Anderson & von Messling 2008).",

            "text": "CDV causes a highly contagious disease in domestic dogs (Canis lupus familiaris, family Canidae) worldwide and infects a taxonomically broad range of carnivores (Appel & Summers 1995; Pomeroy et al. 2008), including endangered species (e.g. Williams et al. 1988; Goller et al. 2010; Meli et al. 2010; Seimon et al. 2014). The outcome of CDV infection ranges from subclinical to lethal; survival of infection provides lifelong immunity (Appel & Summers 1995). Clinical disease and virus shedding occurs once CDV has completed two stages of infection (Sawatsky et al. 2012). During the first stage, CDV targets the signalling lymphocytic activation molecule (SLAM, CD150) receptors expressed on the surface of T and B lymphocytes, macrophages and dendritic cells (Tatsuo et al. 2001; von Messling et al. 2006). Virus entry occurs when the CDV\u2010H protein attaches to SLAM receptors and together with the CDV\u2010F protein accomplishes fusion with host cell membranes (von Messling et al. 2001; Tatsuo et al. 2001). Virus amplification in lymphatic tissues and circulating lymphocytes induces immunosuppression and the spread of CDV through the bloodstream (Lamb & Kolakofsky 2001). In the second stage of infection, CDV enters epithelial cells using the nectin\u20104 receptor (Noyce et al. 2013), leading to the manifestation of disease and virus shedding (Sawatsky et al. 2012).",

            "text": "The mammalian order Carnivora contains two suborders, the Caniformia and Feliformia (Flynn et al. 2005). Carnivore SLAM proteins reflect this ancient bifurcation (Nikolin et al. 2012b), as SLAM proteins from caniform species within family Canidae have high amino acid sequence identity and a far lower identity to those in feliform species in families Felidae and Hyaenidae. McCarthy et al. (2007) proposed that efficient virus binding to SLAM receptors in carnivores other than the domestic dog (hereafter termed dog) requires adaptations in the SLAM\u2010binding region of the CDV\u2010H protein. They identified that sites 530 and 549 in this region were under positive selection and that most CDV\u2010H proteins from dog strains encode tyrosine (Y) at site 549 whereas those in strains from other carnivores mostly specified histidine (H). This finding is supported by several empirical studies (Monne et al. 2011; Kameo et al. 2012; Nikolin et al. 2012a; Origgi et al. 2012) and the occurrence of the Y549H substitution during experimental adaptation of a dog CDV strain to ferrets (Mustela putorius furo, family Mustelidae) (von Messling et al. 2003). A quantitative assessment of the functional importance of the residue at site 549 revealed that CDV\u2010H proteins encoding 549Y performed significantly better in cells expressing dog SLAM receptors than those encoding 549H, whereas proteins encoding 549H performed better in cells expressing lion (Panthera leo, family Felidae) SLAM than those specifying 549Y, thereby indicating antagonistic pleiotropic effects of the residue at site 549 on CDV\u2010H\u2010mediated attachment to SLAM receptors in distantly related carnivore species (Nikolin et al. 2012b). Even so, variants specifying 549Y can cause clinical disease in noncanids (e.g. Meli et al. 2010; Keller et al. 2012; Nagao et al. 2012; Seimon et al. 2014) and those encoding 549H can cause disease in dogs (e.g. Fischer et al. 2016).",

            "text": "The worldwide spread of CDV from the USA reached South Africa in the 1920s (Panzera et al. 2015), but it is unclear when it arrived in East Africa. A CDV epidemic emerged in the Serengeti National Park (NP) in northeast Tanzania in November 1993 (Haas et al. 1996) and then spread through the Serengeti ecosystem (Roelke\u2010Parker et al. 1996), including the Maasai Mara National Reserve (NR) in Kenya (Harrison et al. 2004). Unexpectedly, it caused high morbidity and mortality in juvenile and adult lions (Roelke\u2010Parker et al. 1996; Munson et al. 2008) and predominantly juvenile (<12 months of age) spotted hyaenas (Crocuta crocuta, family Hyaenidae, hereafter termed hyaena) (Haas et al. 1996). In canids, infection was confirmed in two bat\u2010eared foxes (Otocyon megalotis), and neurological signs were observed in two silver\u2010backed jackals (Canis mesomelas) and one golden jackal (Canis aureus) (Roelke\u2010Parker et al. 1996). Since this epidemic, CDV has not caused clinical disease in either the lion (Munson et al. 2008) or hyaena populations (M. L. East and H. Hofer unpublished data) in the Serengeti NP, despite serological data revealing three periods of increased CDV seroprevalence (1999\u20132001, 2006/2007 and 2010/2011) in lions in the Serengeti NP (Munson et al. 2008; Viana et al. 2015), and hyaenas in the Maasai Mara NR in 2000 (Harrison et al. 2004).",

To explain high CDV\u2010mediated mortality in lions during the 1993/1994 epidemic, Roelke\u2010Parker et al. (1996) proposed that a virulent CDV \u2018biotype\u2019 spread from dogs outside the Serengeti NP to wild carnivores inside the park. More recently, a stochastic model (Guiserix et al. 2007) suggested that low herd immunity among lions, rather than CDV virulence, better explained the epidemic. Neither a stochastic model (Craft et al. 2008) or network model (Craft et al. 2009) could explain the observed spread of CDV in prides during the epidemic purely by lion\u2010to\u2010lion transmission, and hence, both posited that a single variant circulating in dogs and wild carnivores was repeatedly introduced by jackals and hyaenas to prides.",

            "text": "Our study examines the distribution and outcome of CDV infection in carnivores in the Serengeti ecosystem to identify the strain(s) associated with: (i) mortality among lions and hyaenas in 1993/1994, (ii) high levels of benign exposure in these noncanids since the epidemic, despite (iii) ongoing lethal disease in canids. If CDV in 1993/1994 spread from dogs to lions and hyaenas, as proposed by Roelke\u2010Parker et al. (1996), we expect genetic sequence data to reveal a close relationship between strains from dog and noncanid hosts during this epidemic. The theory of virus\u2013host adaptation suggests that virus transmission chains within one host species could lead to beneficial adaptations to this host which might be detrimental to the virus in distantly related hosts. We therefore predicted that (1) CDV strains adapted to dogs should outcompete non\u2010canid\u2010adapted strains in dogs and cause clinical disease in closely related wild canids but not in noncanids; (2) if several strains circulate, then those adapted to noncanids should outcompete canid\u2010adapted strains in noncanids, but not in canids; and (3) strains causing clinical disease in wild canids are less likely to do so in noncanids. We tested these ideas by examining the relationship between strains from different carnivores and the infection outcome from 1993 to 2011. We also assess the functional importance of the amino acid combination at two sites under positive selection in the CDV\u2010H SLAM\u2010binding region in cellular environments expressing SLAM receptors from canids or noncanids.",

One variant from an African wild dog (Lycaon pictus, family Canidae) came from a pack that died of CDV in 2007 (Goller et al. 2010) and another from a golden jackal was obtained from bloody faeces from a pup that succumbed to canine distemper in 2011.

Baits were generated from PCR products covering the complete genome of variant SE/1994/domestic dog. Libraries were indexed by sample and were built as previously described (Meyer & Kircher 2010). Baits and cDNA libraries were constructed in separate laboratories to avoid contamination. Enriched libraries from the hybrid capture were deep\u2010sequenced on the Illumina MiSeq\u2122 platform (Illumina Inc., San Diego, CA, USA). Sequence quality was assessed as previously described (Olarte\u2010Castillo et al. 2015). Trimmed reads from each sample were assembled against reference strain 171391\u2013513 (Accession no. KJ123771), using the medium sensitivity method with up to 10 iterations in geneious 9.0.2 (Biomatters Ltd, Auckland, New Zealand). Genome organization and predicted gene products of the sequenced \u2018Serengeti\u2019 variants (Table S2, Supporting information) were identical to those of other canine distemper viruses. The genomes were 15 690 nucleotides long and contained six open reading frames (ORF) coding for six structural proteins (N, P, M, F, H and L). Within the CDV\u2010P gene sequence was an additional ORF coding for the nonstructural C protein. Reverse transcription\u2013PCR (RT\u2013PCR) was performed to amplify the complete CDV\u2010H gene (1824 nucleotides, position within viral genome: 7079\u20138902) and the complete P gene (1524 nucleotides, position within the viral genome: 1801\u20133324). When we could not obtain the entire CDV\u2010H gene, we amplified a 514\u2010nucleotide segment of the 3\u2032\u2010end of this gene (position within viral genome: 8479\u20138993) which included the SLAM\u2010binding region. PCR products were cloned into the PCR 2.1 TOPO vector and sequenced. Nucleic acid sequences were edited and aligned using the multiple alignment method (ClustalW) incorporated within the computer program mega 6.0 (http://www.megasoftware.net) (Tamura et al. 2013).

These models allow the ratio (\u03c9) between nonsynonymous substitutions (dN) and synonymous substitutions (dS) to vary from site to site. Three pairs of nested models compared the results of null models (M0, M1a and M7, respectively) in which no sites were permitted to evolve (\u03c9 \u2264 1), with those from models (M3, M2a and M8, respectively) that allowed positive selection of some site (\u03c9 > 1, see Table S3, Supporting information for details). Likelihood ratio tests (LRTs) were used to assess which of the two nested models best fitted the data set. When results of the LRTs significantly supported the existence of positive selection pressure, the na\u03cave empirical Bayes (NEB) (Nielsen & Yang 1998; Yang et al. 2000) and the Bayes empirical Bayes (BEB) (Yang et al. 2005) approaches were used to identify the sites evolving under positive selection.",

Mixed\u2010effects models of evolution (MEME) permit the identification of pervasive positive selection and episodic positive selection that affects specific sites along particular lineages by allowing the distribution of \u03c9 to vary between sites and between branches at a site (Murrell et al. 2012).

The proficiency of syncytium formation is chiefly determined by the CDV\u2010H protein (von Messling et al. 2001). The assay quantified the mean number of nuclei (MNN) per syncytium as a measure of the performance of CDV\u2010H proteins at cell entry in Vero cell lines that stably expressed SLAM from two known CDV hosts (dog and lion) and one species, the domestic cat (Felis catus, family Felidae), in which CDV replicates in lymphatic tissues and induces seroconversion but does not induce clinical disease (Appel et al. 1974; Ikeda et al. 2001). The assay methods are detailed in full by Nikolin et al. (2012b). Briefly, Vero cell lines that stably expressed dog SLAM, lion SLAM or domestic cat SLAM were seeded in 12\u2010well plates and cotransfected using 1 \u03bcL of Fugene transfection reagent (Roche, Germany) with 0.10 \u03bcg of each CDV\u2010H and CDV\u2010F expression plasmids in six different combinations (1) pCG\u2010domestic dog94SE\u2010CDV\u2010H + pCG\u2010African lion94SNP\u2010CDV\u2010F (domestic dog94SE), (2) pCG\u2010Lion94SNP\u2010CDV\u2010H + pCG\u2010African lion94SNP\u2010CDV\u2010F (African lion94SNP), (3) pCG\u2010A75/17\u2010CDV\u2010H + pCG\u2010A75/17\u2010CDV\u2010F (A75/17), (4) pCG\u2010A75/17\u2010519I\u2010CDV\u2010H + pCG\u2010A75/17\u2010CDV\u2010F (the experimentally mutated A75/17\u2010519I), (5) pCG\u2010A75/17\u2010549H\u2010CDV\u2010H + pCG\u2010A75/17\u2010CDV\u2010F (the experimentally mutated A75/17\u2010549H) and (6) pCG\u2010A75/17\u2010519I/549H\u2010CDV\u2010H + pCG\u2010A75/17\u2010CDV\u2010F (the experimentally double mutated A75/17\u2010519I/549H). Twelve hours after transfection, cells were fixed with 2% paraformaldehyde in PBS and permeabilized with 0.2% Tween 20 in PBS, and nuclei were visualized with Hoechst 33342 trihydrochloride, trihydrate (Invitrogen, USA). Pictures were taken using the Zeiss AxioVert S100 microscope (Carl\u2010Zeiss, Germany) and recorded with a CCD camera (Axiocam, Germany). For each cell line, six independent transfection repeats were performed. For each experiment, five random images were taken of each well, syncytia were marked and nuclei were counted in a blinded fashion. A total of 60 syncytia for each cell type and plasmid combination were counted from which we calculated an MNN per syncytium per experiment.",

The large noncanid node was separated from the hypothetical node by a single nucleotide substitution at site 134 in both the CDV\u2010P and CDV\u2010V proteins which resulted in a nonsynonymous amino acid substitution. All \u2018Serengeti\u2019 canid variants (Fig. 5b) encoded glycine (G) and all noncanid variants from 1993/1994 encoded serine (S). BlastX searches revealed that only noncanid \u2018Serengeti\u2019 variants encode S, whereas CDV variants worldwide encode G, regardless of host species (Fig. 5b). In the CDV\u2010C protein, this nucleotide difference is a synonymous substitution (glutamine at site 126 in both canid and noncanid strains).",

We only retrieved strains encoding CDV\u2010H 519R/549Y or 519R/549H from canid species (Fig. 4a) with fatal disease (Table S5, Supporting information) and from asymptomatic hyaenas (Table S5, Supporting information).

In contrast, CDV\u2010H proteins encoding 519I/549H performed relatively well in cells expressing lion SLAM receptors, cat SLAM receptors and dog SLAM receptors, but the performance of this combination in cells expressing dog SLAM was significantly below that of proteins specifying 519R/549Y, 519R/549H or 519I/549Y. These findings suggest that CDV\u2010H proteins encoding 519I/549H exhibited the strongest \u2018generalist\u2019 traits, those specifying 519R/549Y displayed traits indicative of a dog \u2018specialist\u2019 strain (sensu Nikolin et al. 2012b) and those encoding 519R/549H or 519I/549Y showed traits between these two extremes. During the first infection stage, dogs would therefore be particularly prone to strains encoding 519R/549Y, whereas lions would be particularly prone to infection by those encoding 519I/549H and far less so to infection with strains encoding 519R/549Y (Fig. 6). Hence, our results indicate that strain type 519R/549Y would outcompete 519I/549H when infecting domestic dog immune cells and strain type 519I/549H would outcompete both 519R/549Y and 519R/549H when infecting lion immune cells.",

Adult hyaenas were asymptomatic when infected with variants encoding 519I/549H that were fatal to juvenile hyaenas (Haas et al. 1996). Asymptomatic infection most likely represents a \u2018dead end\u2019 for CDV because virus shedding probably does not occur (Sawatsky et al. 2012). This suggests that most adult hyaenas in the Serengeti ecosystem are \u2018dead\u2010end\u2019 hosts for CDV, regardless of strain type, although lions might be infected if they killed an asymptomatic hyaena and hence contacted strain type 519I/549H from its blood. Juvenile hyaenas developed clinical disease during the 1993/1994 epidemic and were presumably the main shedders and transmitters of CDV within hyaena clans. By contrast, lions regardless of age developed clinical signs during this epidemic, hence shed and transmitted strain type 519I/549H within prides. We have no evidence that strain types 519R/549Y or 519R/549H in the East African lineage caused clinical disease in either lions or hyaenas thus suspect that these noncanids are \u2018dead\u2010end\u2019 hosts for them (Table S5, Supporting information). Our results and those from the America II lineage indicate that strain type 519I/549H does not cause clinical CDV in canids.

Our results suggest that lions and hyaenas typically clear canid\u2010adapted CDV strains before clinical sign and virus shedding occurs and that outbreaks of canid\u2010adapted strains in wild canid populations cause asymptomatic exposure in noncanids. These benign outcomes most likely explain \u2018silent\u2019 outbreaks in lions and hyaenas. Fatal CDV in an African wild dog pack in 2007 (Goller et al. 2010) and a golden jackal pup in 2011 is consistent with this idea, as both occurred when serological data from lions indicated elevated asymptomatic exposure (Viana et al. 2015).

Exposure of carnivores to other morbilliviruses such as rinderpest in the past (Dehay et al. 1965) and currently to peste des petits ruminants (PPR) (Swai et al. 2009) through the consumption of infected ungulates is also thought to induce antibody protection against CDV, and could be mistakenly interpreted as evidence of CDV exposure.",

Our results question this assumption by revealing genetically distinct strains in canids and noncanids during the epidemic (Figs 2, 3, 4, 5) and by experimentally showing that canids would be unlikely to propagate the CDV\u2010H 519I/549H CDV\u2010V 134S strain type during the 1993/1994 epidemic in lions (Fig. 6). In the hyaena population, virus shedders of strain type CDV\u2010H 519I/549H CDV\u2010V 134S during the disease epidemic were predominantly juveniles based at clan communal dens. In fission\u2013fusion hyaena clans, communal dens are important social centres (Hofer & East 1995) that can facilitate pathogen transmission within clans (East et al. 2013). For this reason, exposure of adult clan members to virus shedding juveniles should relatively swiftly elevate herd immunity to CDV in clans and result in rapid \u2018burn\u2010out\u2019 of na\u00efve juveniles at communal dens. We consider that juvenile hyaenas with clinical CDV at communal dens would rarely propagate the epidemic in lion prides.
