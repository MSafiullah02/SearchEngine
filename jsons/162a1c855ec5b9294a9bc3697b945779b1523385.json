Although the risk of SARS-CoV transmission within aircraft cabins has been addressed by several studies, the magnitude of the risk remains unclear. Methods. We attempted to contact all persons with working US telephone numbers aboard seven US-bound fl ights carrying SARS patients. Consenting participants responded to a questionnaire, and a serum sample was collected at least 38 days after the fl ight and tested for SARS-CoV-associated antibodies. Participants reporting an illness compatible with SARS, with onset during the 2-to 10-day incubation period, were considered suspect cases; positive serology was required for confi rmed cases. Results. Among 1,766 passengers and crew, 339 (19%) persons were contacted. Of these, 312 (92%) completed questionnaires, and blood was collected from 127 (37%).

Moreover, most cases of presumed secondary transmission occurred among persons who had visited SARS-affected regions within the incubation period, leaving open the possibility that transmission could have occurred before boarding the fl ight. For example, Olsen 10 and colleagues reported that 22 of 119 passengers and crew were potentially infected during a fl ight from Hong Kong to Beijing. Although transmission seems likely to have occurred, the index patient was not laboratory confi rmed and the fl ight originated in a SARS-affected area.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 116, "end": 121, "text": "8 -11", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 578, "end": 580, "text": "10", "ref_id": "BIBREF9"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Discussion"}, {"text": "Our fi nding that no confi rmed cases of in-fl ight transmission were identifi ed aboard any of the seven aircraft included in the investigation suggests that the risk of SARS-CoV transmission is not high aboard aircraft. However, other explanations for this fi nding are possible. For example, the fi ve index patients, all of whom were well enough to travel, may not have been infectious during the fl ight, despite the presence of symptoms. Only one fl ight carried an index patient (patient A) who fl ew approximately 1 week after symptom onset when viral loads are peaking and risk of transmission is likely increased. 16 -18 Even though most of the passengers and crew we were able to contact were willing to participate, the major weakness of our investigation was its limited sample size. The large proportion of passengers and crew living outside the United States restricted the number of eligible participants. Contact information from the airlines was of variable quality and incomplete since airlines typically purge reservations data 48 hours after landing. 19 Customs declarations, available only for international fl ights, are handwritten, diffi cult to read, and often do not include adequate contact information. The process of locating airline passengers for public health purposes could be signifi cantly improved if data such as telephone numbers and addresses were provided from the airlines to public health agencies rapidly and in an electronic format. Another potential weakness involves the possibility that SARS symptoms might have been inaccurately recalled by participants, especially if interviews took place well after the fl ight occurred. However, because SARS symptoms are generally quite severe, we feel that inaccurate recall is unlikely to have caused us to miss a case. SARS-CoV could potentially be transmitted anywhere people are gathered, including aircraft cabins. However, the relevant question is whether the aircraft cabin environment leads to a higher risk of transmission. Although our sample size was limited, our fi ndings suggest that risk of SARS-CoV transmission is not high aboard aircraft, even among passengers seated near the index patient on long fl ights. The probability of transmission is more likely to be determined by the infectiousness of the index patient rather than the physical setting (eg, aircraft, classroom, or hospital). Thus, prevention efforts for air travel should continue to focus on reducing infectious particles on aircraft by discouraging persons who are acutely ill from traveling and reminding passengers to wash their hands frequently and cover their noses and mouths when coughing or sneezing.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 624, "end": 630, "text": "16 -18", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1072, "end": 1074, "text": "19", "ref_id": "BIBREF18"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Discussion"}], "bib_entries": {"BIBREF0": {"ref_id": "b0", "title": "Identifi cation of a novel coronavirus in patients with severe acute respiratory syndrome", "authors": [{"first": "C", "middle": [], "last": "Drosten", "suffix": ""}, {"first": "S", "middle": [], "last": "Gunther", "suffix": ""}, {"first": "W", "middle": [], "last": "Preiser", "suffix": ""}], "year": 2003, "venue": "N Engl J Med", "volume": "348", "issn": "", "pages": "1967--1976", "other_ids": {}}, "BIBREF1": {"ref_id": "b1", "title": "A novel coronavirus associated with severe acute respiratory syndrome", "authors": [{"first": "T", "middle": ["G"], "last": "Ksiazek", "suffix": ""}, {"first": "D", "middle": [], "last": "Erdman", "suffix": ""}, {"first": "C", "middle": ["S"], "last": "Goldsmith", "suffix": ""}], "year": 2003, "venue": "N Engl J Med", "volume": "348", "issn": "", "pages": "1953--1966", "other_ids": {}}, "BIBREF2": {"ref_id": "b2", "title": "Outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome -worldwide", "authors": [], "year": 2003, "venue": "Centers for Disease Control", "volume": "52", "issn": "", "pages": "226--228", "other_ids": {}}, "BIBREF3": {"ref_id": "b3", "title": "World Health Organization.
