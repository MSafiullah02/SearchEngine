Five years after the Paris terrorist attack in 2015, the Parisian health care system is again facing an unprecedented challenge. But this time we are urging for intensive care unit (ICU) beds, ventilators and personal protective equipment rather than operating rooms (OR). Our ICU capacities have been doubled by transforming any available space with ventilators into ICUs: recovery rooms, outpatient surgical unit, even ORs. As to spare most of in-hospital resources, all non-emergent surgical procedures have been cancelled. ORs are used to manage emergencies only. According to the French Society for Vascular Surgery\u2019s recommendations based on the 3Ss principle (save Staff, Space and Stuff), our surgical activity is now limited to the following emergencies: acute aortic syndromes, critical and acute limb ischemia, symptomatic carotid stenosis, mesenteric ischemia and vascular access for hemodialysis, with endovascular favored over open repair whenever possible to shorten hospital and ICU stay.",

To coordinate and optimize acute patient referrals, we created secured social network groups including all vascular surgery consultants from both public and private hospitals in Paris area. These groups allowed to share clinical experience and set-up clinical studies. ICUs have been divided into Covid-19-positive and Covid-19-negative units. Therefore, systematic preoperative screening for Covid-19 should be recommended. Suspected cases might be considered positive. No Covid-19-negative center could have been preserved due to the magnitude of the pandemic.",

The assumption of a Covid-19 related hypercoagulability is supported by high reported rates of deep venous and pulmonary thromboembolism and the identification of a disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) in Covid-19 ICU patients. 2 Our group is conducting a clinical study regarding vascular events in Covid-19 patients.",
