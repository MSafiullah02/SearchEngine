In the end of 2019, a novel coronavirus, now known as SARS-CoV-2 (2019), suddenly emerged in Wuhan, China. The World Health Organization declared that the epidemic is a public health emergency of international concern on January 31, 2020. As of April 16, 2020, the emerging coronavirus infection, COVID-19, has been spreading worldwide, causing over 2 million cases and over 137 thousand of death.",

Even if gastrointestinal involvement or digested sputum was the origin of virus existence in the stool, this fact gives another reason to emphasize good personal hygiene.
