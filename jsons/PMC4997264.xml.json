The flatmount image showed 3 weeks after the injection, the fluorescence was strongly expressed, especially around the site where the vector was injected, which was in consistent with previous studies31. Previous studies demonstrated that AAV8-Y733F vector mediated gene delivery would result in gene expression mainly in the RPE layer and photoreceptor layer3132, which was in parallel with our findings as shown in Fig. 1b. The cross section showed that the eGFP was mainly transducted at the RPE and the photoreceptor level of the retina. Three weeks after subretinal injection of AAV8-ACE2 vector, the expression of the target gene ACE2 was increased at both mRNA level and protein level (Fig. 1c) (*p < 0.05).",

Histological examination showed a severe intraocular inflammation as evidenced by massive infiltration of inflammatory cells, folds of retina, and photoreceptor damage in the AAV8-eGFP + EAU mice and EAU mice. Whereas, only very few scattered inflammatory cells and minor retinal folds were observed in the AAV8-ACE2 treated EAU mice (Fig. 2b).

Thus, to investigate whether ACE2 would regulate the polarization of the macrophage subtype locally and systemically, typical surface markers of M1 (iNOS) and M2 (Arginase-1) macrophages were detected by real-time PCR. In the retina, the mRNA level of iNOS was increased in the AAV8-eGFP+EAU group, whereas, the level of Arginase-1 (Arg-1) was decreased compared with the ACE2 over-expression EAU eyes (p < 0.05). The M1/M2 ratio was higher (2.08 \u00b1 0.84) in the AAV8-eGFP+EAU mice than in the AAV8-ACE2 + EAU mice (0.53 \u00b1 0.50) (Fig. 5d). Nevertheless, there was no statistical difference in iNOS or Arg-1 level between the AAV8-ACE2 + EAU and the AAV8-eGFP + EAU groups in the spleen (Fig. 5e) and DLN (Fig. 5f).

To confirm that the protective effects of ACE2 over-expression in EAU eyes is mediated by Ang-(1\u20137)/Mas signaling, we used the Ang-(1\u20137) antagonist A-779. Co-administration of A-779 via mini-pump reversed the protective effects of ACE2 on the inflammatory signs and the production of inflammatory cytokines as well as the regulation of the local immune responses. As shown in Fig. 6a, the severity of inflammatory signs in AAV8-ACE2 treated EAU eyes were milder than AAV8-eGFP+EAU group. However, A-779 abrogated this protective effect of ACE2, as evidenced by more severe inflammation and higher clinical scores of AAV8-ACE2+A-779+EAU group (Fig. 6a,b). The mRNA expressions of IL-6, IL-1\u03b2, TNF-\u03b1 and MCP-1 were remarkably decreased and the level of IL-10 was increased in the AAV8-ACE2+EAU group. However, with the co-administration of A-779, the reduction of these pro-inflammatory cytokines and the increase of the anti-inflammatory cytokine was reversed (p < 0.05, p < 0.01), indicating decreased pro-inflammatory cytokine production and increased anti-inflammatory cytokine by ACE2 over-expression was mediated through Ang-(1\u20137)/Mas (Fig. 6c). Subretinal administration with AAV8-ACE2 also inhibited the Th1/Th17 responses as evidenced by a significant decrease of IFN-\u03b3 and IL-17. However, A-779 abrogated the reduction of IFN-\u03b3 and IL-17 (p < 0.05, p < 0.01) (Fig. 6d). Moreover, A-779 abolished the effects of ACE2 over-expression on shifting the polarization of M1/M2 macrophages, as demonstrated by negating the expression of iNOS and Arg-1. (Fig. 6e).

The anti-inflammatory effect of ACE2 appeared to result in reducing the expression of inflammatory cytokines and influence the ocular immune responses. The antagonist of Ang-(1\u20137) A-779 abolished these beneficial effects, suggesting that these protective effects are mediated by activating the ACE2/Ang-(1\u20137)/Mas axis.

Although there was a evidence that NK and NKT cells may be attribute to in part the production of IFN-\u03b3 in EAU, it was just during the innate response phase, thus to shape the effector T cells51. In addition, by using immunohistochemical staining and in situ hybridization, a previous study demonstrated that the presence of IFN-\u03b3 was only localized to the T lymphocytes infiltrated in the retina and uveal tract in the EAU model. Notably, when the inflammatory cells infiltrated in the posterior chamber, no IFN-\u03b3 has been detected52. Similarly, despite NKT cells can produce IL-17, it is also happens in the innate response which differs significantly from adaptive IL-17 produced by Th17 effector cells. Moreover, it is produced only by a relatively small NK1.1-negative fraction. As a consequence, its amount is very low and can hardly be detected53. Therefore, we strongly believe the expression of IFN-\u03b3 and IL-17 in the retina can serve as indicators of Th1 and Th17 response in EAU model. Nevertheless, further study are necessary for investigating the possible role of these two signature cytokines in different immune cells and different stages of EAU.

Macrophages are considered to be potent antigen presenting cells (APCs) in inflammatory autoimmune disease and are responsible for the production of inflammatory and immunomodulatory cytokines35. They also play an essential role in tissue damage during the process of autoimmune diseases, including arthritis, nephritis and experimental allergic encephalomyelitis (EAE)5556. It has been reported that macrophages are important at different stages of EAU34. In particular, they are the major effectors of tissue damage during EAU34. Macrophages affect the T cell responses depending on different levels of cytokines and chemokines in the microenvironment57. The heterogeneity of macrophage has been well established58. They are engaged in versatile activities in parallel with the Th1 and Th2 types of immune responses, which have been termed type 1 (M1) and type 2 (M2) macrophages58. M1 macrophages are classically activated macrophages, which develop in response to inflammatory stimuli of Th1 cytokine, such as IFN-\u03b3. Activated M1 macrophages produce large amounts of proinflammatory cytokines such as TNF-\u03b1, IL-1\u03b2 and IL-6. Whereas M2 macrophages are alternatively activated macrophages and are considered to be anti-inflammatory macrophages59. A shift of macrophages from the M1 to M2 phenotype reduces the experimental inflammatory colitis60. Downregulating the M1/M2 ratio of macrophage has been shown to attenuate the Beh\u00e7et\u2019s disease (BD)-like symptoms in a herpes simplex virus (HSV)-induced inflammatory mouse model36. Further, IL-33 increases the frequency of M2 macrophages in the lymphoid organs confers a protective effect in EAU37.",

Meanwhile, the mRNA expression of the M1 marker iNOS was significantly decreased. On the contrary, the M2 markers increased in the AAV8-ACE2 treated EAU eyes compared with the AAV8-eGFP treated EAU eyes. Furthermore, we found a down-regulated M1/M2 ratio with the treatment of AAV8-ACE2 in the EAU retinas. However, subretinal injection with AAV8-ACE2 or AAV8-eGFP did not influence the polarization of macrophages in spleens or DLNs. These result revealed that activating the local protective ACE2/Ang-(1\u20137)/Mas axis may be capable to regulate the polarization of classically activated M1 macrophage and the alternatively activated M2 macrophage in the eyes of EAU mice. Shifting of the phenotype of macrophages may have an impact on ocular inflammation in EAU. However, more in-depth researches to verify this possibility need to be done in the future works.",

It has been suggested that these signaling pathways were involved in the ACE2/Ang-(1\u20137)/Mas axis mediated protection. Indeed, by modulating Ang-(1\u20137) and Mas receptor, an ACE inhibitor olmesartan exerts cardioprotective and anti-inflammatory effects in the experimental autoimmune myocarditis model through decreasing the phosphorylation of p38MAPK, extracellular signalregulated kinase (ERK) and jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) pathways63. In addition, in an allergic asthma mouse model, Ang-(1\u20137) ameliorated inflammation which was attributed to one of the MAPK family members, the ERK and NF-\u03baB signaling pathway64. Most recently, it was shown DIZE, an activator of endogenous ACE2, remarkably suppressed LPS induced production of proinflammatory cytokines. DIZE downregulated the phosphorylation of key signaling molecules and transcription factors including MAPKs, STATs, and NF-\u03baB p65 subunit, which are involved in the production of proinflammatory cytokines29.",

After the conventional medications, patients still suffer from recurrent inflammation, suggesting that the treatments can not completely eliminate the pathogenic factors. We found that activating the ACE2/Ang-(1\u20137)/Mas axis effectively suppressed the Th1/Th17 responses which not only contribute to the primary inflammation process of uveitis, but also may play an important role in the recurrent inflammation in autoimmune uveitis11. Therefore, it is practical to provide a long-lasting strategy to enhance the protective axis of the RAS in these uveitis patients. Moreover, long-term application of the conventional treatments, such as corticosteroids and immunosuppressants, may cause various systemic and local unwanted side effects. Thus topical administration has an advantage of less risk of potential off-target side effects. AAV vector mediated gene therapy for ocular diseases has been successfully applied in human and animal for more than a decade65. In view of recent clinical trials66, the safety of AAV mediated gene therapy of ocular diseases has been warranted. Furthermore, AAV-associated gene therapies were shown to be highly effective. Existing evidences showed that AAV-mediated ACE2 gene delivery ameliorated the inflammatory responses in diabetic retinopathy2267. Moreover, oral delivery of ACE2 or Ang-(1\u20137) vector resulted in down-regulation of inflammatory cytokines in EIU and EAU models26. Meanwhile a single AAV vector injection yields a long-term target gene expression which is ideal for treating the chronic and recurrent uveitis. Therefore, AAV mediated ACE2 delivery may be a promising novel intervention for uveitis, as well as other chronic ocular inflammatory conditions.",

Hence, a long-term safety study of local ACE2 over-expression should be carried out. Second, to ensure the transferred gene to be functional, we delivered the vectors three weeks before inducing the EAU. Thus enhanced ACE2 occurred before the on-set of inflammation and our study described a prophylactic effect of enhancing ACE2 in the inflammatory process. Nevertheless, in most cases, since it takes a few weeks for the transferred gene to be functional and since it is impossible to treat the patients preventively, we can\u2019t modify the ACE2/Ang-(1\u20137)/Mas axis for the initial uveitis patients by gene therapy in a timely manner.

The successful delivery of vector was confirmed by viewing fluorescein-positive subretinal blebs demarcating the retinal detachment in the injected retinal area. Such detachments usually can be resolved spontaneously within 1 to 2 days. The damages occasionally induced by ocular injection included temporal corneal edema, iris hemorrhage or cataract formation. The animals with any of these complications were excluded from further study. All animals received antibiotic ointment to the cornea and were observed daily after operation. The vectors were injected subretinally into the right eyes of the mice, the lateral eyes were not injected and served as a control.",
