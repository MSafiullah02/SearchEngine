Highly infectious, COVID-19 has numerous transmission channels and humans are highly susceptible to infection. The main clinical symptoms of COVID-19 are fever, fatigue, and a dry cough. Laboratory examination in the early stage of the disease shows a normal or decreased white blood cell count, and a decreased lymphocyte count. While CT examination serves as the screening and diagnostic basis for COVID-19, its accuracy is limited. The nucleic acid testing is the gold standard for the diagnosis of COVID-19, but has a low sensitivity is low. There is clearly a divide between the two means of examination. This paper reviews the published literature, guidelines and consensus, and summarizes the clinical and imaging characteristics of COVID-19, in order to provide a reliable basis for early diagnosis and treatment.",

As the disease has spread, cases of COVID-19 have also been found across the whole of China and overseas. Nucleic acid detection of a patient's respiratory secretions identified the source of infection to be a new type of coronavirus, which was been defined as 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) [1] . On 11 February 2020, the WHO officially named the disease caused by the novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) as Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) [2] . On February 22, 2020, China's National Health Commission announced the designation of the new coronavirus pneumonia as Coronavirus disease. The disease is a new type B infectious disease (in accordance with the class A management, Infectious Disease Prevention and Control Law). Although there is considerable overlap between imaging manifestations of different viral pneumonia, comprehensive analysis of clinical features, epidemiology and laboratory examination results are of significance in improving the diagnosis of COVID-19.",

The surface of virus particles is covered in many spines, and the virus particles as a whole resemble a crown, which is the origin of the name \"coronavirus\". Six subtypes have been found; of these, four are less pathogenic and generally lead to mild symptoms after infection; two subtypes can cause severe infections. The novel coronavirus is a new-type coronavirus that has not been previously been found in humans being. It is now considered to be a seventh subtype, but its genes have more than 85% homology with a SARS-like virus in bats. It has been speculated that the pathogenic mechanism of the virus may be that because the 2019-nCoV receptor and SARS-CoV receptor binding region (RBD) structure domain between the amino acid sequence and the prediction of protein structure are highly similar, 2019-nCoV can effectively use angiotensinconverting enzyme 2(ACE2) on alveolar type II epithelial cells as the receptor to invade cells, thus entering the bronchial epithelial cells to replicate and cause disease [3, 4] .",

The main source of infection is patients infected with the novel coronavirus infection. Patients with asymptomatic infection (incubation period) can also be a source of infection. Infection is mainly spread by respiratory droplets and contact. Exposed mucus membranes and unprotected eyes increase the risk of infection, and the detection of the virus in stool and urine samples from patients also suggests the possibility of fecal-oral transmission. There is a possibility of aerosol transmission under the condition of prolonged exposure to high concentrations of aerosols in a relatively closed environment [5e7]. At present, there are no reports of vertical transmission from mother to child.",

The main clinical manifestations of the disease are fever, fatigue, and a dry cough, and in severe cases, multiple organ failure [7e9]. Its atypical symptoms may include myalgia and diarrhea. Laboratory tests have shown that the total number of white blood cells in early peripheral blood is normal or has decreased, and the lymphocyte count has progressively decreased; C-reactive protein and serum sedimentation rates were increased in most patients [7e9]. COVID-19 was confirmed by viral nucleic acid detection with strong specificity and poor sensitivity [10] . In order to improve the rate of positive nucleic acid detection, it is recommended to retain sputum and lower respiratory secretions as far as possible and promptly submit them for examination [7] . CT examination serves as the screening and diagnostic basis for COVID-19: chest imaging in the early stage shows multiple plaque shadows and interstitial changes, mostly seen in the peripheral lung and subpleural, and then developed into multiple ground glass shadows and infiltration shadows in both lungs. In severe cases, lung consolidation can occur, presenting as \"white lung\", with rare pleural effusion and mediastinal lymph node enlargement [6, 7] .",

Pulmonary imaging is mainly performed by chest CT (particularly HRCT), supplemented by X-ray chest radiographs [10, 11] . CT examination is the main screening and diagnosis basis for COVID-19. The image changes basically reflect the inflammatory pathological process of lung tissue-exudation, proliferation, and metamorphism [12] . GGO is a slightly higher density blurred image in the lungs, where the pulmonary blood vessels are visible. The pathological change of GGO is that the virus invades the bronchioles and alveolar epithelium, and replicates in the epithelial cells, causing the alveolar cavity to leak, and the alveolar wall or the alveolar space to become inflamed or thickened, with a distribution mainly around the lung and under the pleura [13, 14] .",

Among the close-contact cases diagnosed through screening as having COVID-19, most patients had no obvious clinical symptoms at the initial diagnosis, and the corresponding clinical symptoms appeared after a period of time; a few patients showed no obvious clinical symptoms for a long period, with the infection becoming \"invisible \". However, the images of the above cases did show pneumonia at the time of screening, the signs of which were mainly ground glass and patchy shadows under the pleura or outside the lungs [17, 18] . \u2461 The clinical manifestations of some cases are typical, and no obvious manifestations of pneumonia were found on imaging examination (Fig. 2) . This may relate to the virus being mainly located in the upper respiratory tract and not causing exudative lesions in the lung. Such patients should be diagnosed, isolated, and treated early to prevent transmission of the virus. \u2462 In some cases, the clinical symptoms are relieved, and the imaging manifestations have progressed (Fig. 3 ) [19] .

It is common in clinical work to find that clinical and imaging findings support the diagnosis of COVID-19 while multiple consecutive nucleic acid tests are negative (Fig. 4) . It has been reported that up to eight nucleic acid tests have been negative in infected patients before COVID-19 was finally diagnosed. Over-reliance on nucleic acid tests may lead to the misdiagnosis of patients who do in fact have COVID-19. This is not conducive to the control of the epidemic. Preliminary data from a designated virus hospital in Wuhan showed that the CT positive rate of clinically highly suspected cases was 90%, while the positive rate of nucleic acid tests was about 40%. This is due to the many factors which affect the nucleic acid test such as the course of infection, viral load, sampling method, detection reagents, and interpretation standards. Reagents in particular greatly affect the detection effect [21] . Therefore, nucleic acid test cannot be a factor in restricting the accurate diagnosis and treatment of diseases. The director of the radiology department of a hospital in Wuhan strongly recommends CT scan as the main diagnostic and screening basis for COVID-19. The \"Diagnosis and Treatment Scheme for Coronavirus Disease (Trial Version 5)\" [6] specifically formulated clinical diagnosis standards for patients in Hubei Province, and defined suspected cases with pneumonia imaging manifestations as \"clinical diagnostic cases\", which reduced the risk of further spread.",

As mentioned above, the CT scan occupies an important position in the diagnosis of COVID-19; in clinical work, however, we must perform CT examinations without affecting the premise of diagnosis, and we must not over-examine. Therefore, based on the observation of existing cases and combined with clinical experience, we recommend the following CT examination time window: \u2460 Newly diagnosed patients with typical clinical manifestations and positive nucleic acid tests, with a negative chest CT scan at the initial diagnosis, and a review of chest CT scan within 3e5 days; \u2461 Clinical diagnosis cases with atypical clinical manifestations and viral pneumonia characteristics.
