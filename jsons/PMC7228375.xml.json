During the 2014\u20132015 Ebola crisis in West Africa, the health care systems of Liberia, Sierra Leone, and Guinea resulted in a reduction in the ability to provide routine care for HIV/AIDS, malaria, and tuberculosis.\n7\n One author estimated this reduction in services cost >10,600 additional lives, rivaling the total death toll due to Ebola of the 3 countries combined.\n8\n, \n9\n Although some of this increased mortality is likely due to the limitations of health care in that region, an issue not shared by China, developed nations are also at risk for indirect increases in mortality. During the 2009 H1N1 influenza pandemic, US\u2010based emergency departments saw surges in visits. Despite a lack of increased admissions, study hospitals still experienced statistically a higher number of inpatient deaths attributable to stroke and myocardial infarction.\n10\n\n",

Additional personnel hours are needed to isolate infectious cases and implement effective case tracing. Bedside care of these cases expends disposable medical dollars (medications, single\u2010use personal protective equipment and care delivery items). Yet these direct costs pale in comparison to indirect economic expenditures. In 2015, the World Bank estimated that the 3 Ebola epicenter countries experienced a loss of >US$1.6 billion which reflected 12% of their gross domestic product (GDP). Low\u2010 and middle\u2010income countries (LMIC) have decreased ability to maintain tax revenue streams during stalled economic activity and government implemented curfews and quarantines, although it is yet unclear if this will apply to a high\u2010income country like China.\n9\n Neighboring LMICs to an epidemic will likely experience economic stunting. Despite not having a single confirmed case of Ebola, The Gambia reported a 65% reduction in hotel bookings and a cancelation of 50% of inbound planes.\n11\n However, high income countries are not totally immune to fiscal shocks during outbreaks. Despite hospitalizing only 186 people, the Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) coronavirus cost the Republic of Korea >US$2.6 billion in lost tourism wages.\n12\n Economic fallout will likely be tangible worldwide, as 2018 data indicates China has the world's second largest economy, with a GDP of >US$13.6 trillion, 16% of the global economy.\n13\n\n",

The situation is dynamic with cases identified nearly hourly. The stakes are high, as the CFR and morbidity of the virus appears to be higher than influenza. The extent of media coverage regarding this outbreak means that the management of any cases identified outside of China will be heavily scrutinized both regarding disease\u2010related outcomes and the adherence to public health guidelines for protection of the larger population. It is imperative that providers are familiar with the public health considerations of encountering a person under investigation or confirmed case. To this end, providers should take care to consume accurate and timely information to inform their respective institution's triage and treatment practices. For links to updated guidelines please see Appendix A. While progression to a pandemic may not be inevitable, emergency and other front\u2010line medical providers have an obligation to stand in readiness.",
