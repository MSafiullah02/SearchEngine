To face the new scenario all the hospitals have been re-organised in order to reduce all the outpatient services and to devote almost all their personnel and resources to the management of Covid-19 patients. As a matter of fact, all the services have undergone a deep re-organization guided by: the necessity to reduce exams, to create an environment that helps reduce the virus spread, and to preserve the medical personnel from infection. In these days a re-organization of the endoscopic unit, sited in a high-incidence area, has been adopted, with changes to logistics, work organization and patients selection. With the present manuscript, we want to support gastroenterologists and endoscopists in the organization of a \"new\" endoscopy unit that responds to the \"new\" scenario, while remaining fully aware that resources availability and local circumstances may extremely vary from unit to unit.",

This recommendation does not count when there are more than one high-risk patients. In this case, outerlayer clothing should be changed after each procedure but can be kept on if there is only one highrisk patient and changed later after Covid-19 positive patients. Of course, the outer pair of gloves should be dismissed after each procedure. While treating Covid-19 patients, the inner pair of gloves must not be changed between procedures but rather cleaned with hand wash or alcoholic solutions.",

Low-risk subjects should be placed in the oral-route room when performing both upper and lower endoscopy in the same session. Performing both upper and lower endoscopy in the same session is discouraged; however, if necessary, they should be placed in the oral-route room. Whenever there is not enough space to set different rooms for the anal and oral procedures, the careful management of endoscopy times can overcome the risk of spreading the infection.
