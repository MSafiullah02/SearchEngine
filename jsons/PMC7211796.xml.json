While these interventions proved to be effective in Wuhan (China), it is not clear whether these results are directly applicable to other countries.1 We conducted a first evaluation of the effectiveness of such measures in a small Italian area, taking advantage of the fact these mitigation measures were introduced 2 wk ahead the rest of the country. Following the detection of the first cases of COVID-19 in Lombardy, the Italian Government enforced different policies to contain the local outbreaks. On February 23rd, a total lockdown was issued for 10 municipalities in the Lodi Province (Lombardy Region), and the measures included: (a) strict home confinement to the entire population; (b) closure of all the nonessential commercial activities; and (c) mobility restrictions related to the involved municipalities.2 These policies were later extended to the whole of Lombardy (March 8th) and to the entire Country (March 9th).",

Specifically, we investigated changes in the time-varying reproductive number, Rt, namely the estimate of the average number of secondary cases that each infected individual would infect if the conditions remained as they were at time, t.3 A decrease of Rt over time provides insights to the effectiveness of the interventions, given that the goal of control efforts is to reduce it below the threshold value of 1. Data on incident cases of COVID-19 recorded between February 28th and March 27th were obtained from the website of the Italian Civil Protection.4 As data at the municipality level are not available, we used data from the whole Lodi province and 2 neighboring provinces to indirectly estimate the daily number of cases in the red zone. Observed rates in the whole Lodi province are, indeed, a weighted mean between the rates in the red zone (accounting for 22% of the population of the Province) and the rates in the other municipalities (the remaining 78% of the provincial population).",

Applying incidence rates of Milan and Pavia provinces to the 78% of Lodi Province population, we could calculate the expected number of new cases occurring in the red zone. We then estimated the time-varying reproductive number, using the R package EpiEstim for the red zone.5\nFigure 1 shows that incidence in the red zone increased until March 5th, when a steady reduction started.6 Coherently, there was a drop in the values of R\nt, which decreased from 2 to 0.9 and remained stable afterward. As the incidence rates in the provinces of Milan and Pavia, which we used to approximate the rates in the municipalities of the Lodi province out of the red zone, are among the lowest in the Lombardy Region, our results should be regarded as conservative. Had we applied the rates of other provinces, the estimated reduction in Rt would have been even larger.",

These results offer the hope that mitigation measures similar to those issued by the Italian Government can influence the progression of local transmission of COVID-19.
