Previous outbreaks of coronaviruses include the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) in 2002 and the Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) in 2012. The most recent pandemic of coronavirus infection is coronavirus disease (COVID-19) that is caused by SARS-CoV2; it is the causative agent of a potentially fatal disease 1. The symptoms of COVID-19 infection appear after an incubation period of about five days. The most common symptoms at the onset of COVID-19 illness are fever, cough, and fatigue; other symptoms include sputum production, headache, hemoptysis, diarrhea, and dyspnea. In severe cases, patients may develop severe pneumonia, acute respiratory distress syndrome, organ failure, and acute cardiac injury 1. The first cases were reported in December 2019 1; however, when the MEDLINE (accessed from PubMed) was searched, from inception to May 3, 2020, with the key word \u201cCOVID 19\u201d, surprisingly 8,767 articles were yielded. This shows that COVID-19 pandemic is of great global public health concern.",

Most coronaviruses share a similar viral structure and infection pathway; therefore, the infection mechanisms previously found for other coronaviruses may also be applicable for SARS\u2010CoV2. A growing body of evidence shows that neurotropism is one common feature of coronaviruses 2\n,\n11. One study, specifically investigated the neurological manifestations of COVID-19 and could document CNS manifestations in 25% of the patients [headache (13%), dizziness (17%), impaired consciousness (8%), acute cerebrovascular problems (3%), ataxia (0.5), and seizures (0.5%)] 12. There is also a report of meningitis/encephalitis associated with SARS-CoV2 accompanied by seizures (SARS-CoV2 RNA was detected in the CSF) 13. Another report describes a patient affected by COVID-19 whose primary presentation was a focal status epilepticus 14. Therefore, it is reasonable to expect that some patients with COVID-19 develop seizures as a consequence of hypoxia, metabolic derangements, organ failure, or even cerebral damage that may happen in people with COVID-19 (Fig. 1\n).",

Since these patients are critically ill, a drug with intravenous (IV) formulation is preferable. However, because these patients suffer from severe respiratory and/or cardiac problems, drugs with significant respiratory/cardiac adverse effects (e.g., Phenytoin, Phenobarbital, etc.) should be prescribed cautiously, with clinical monitoring as appropriate. In addition, drugs with significant drug interactions (e.g., Carbamazepine, Phenytoin, Phenobarbital, and Valproic acid) should be prescribed cautiously 20. Furthermore, extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO), which may become necessary in the management of patients with COVID-19 and severe pneumonia 21, can impact the pharmacokinetics of highly protein-bound drugs (e.g., Phenytoin and Valproic acid) 20. Lacosamide should be used with caution in patients with cardiac conduction problems (e.g., marked first-degree AV block, second-degree or higher AV block), on concomitant medications that prolong PR interval, or with severe cardiac disease such as myocardial ischemia or heart failure 22. Lacosamide use is not recommended in patients with severe hepatic impairment. However, if cardiac impairment or severe hepatic impairment does not exist in a patient with COVID-19, it is a reasonable ASM 23. Brivaracetam is a safe treatment option in these patients. Dosage adjustment is recommended for all stages of hepatic impairment 24. Similarly, levetiracetam is an optimal ASM in critically ill patients with a reasonable adverse effect profile and minimal interactions with other drugs. Dosage adjustment is necessary in patients with renal impairment 23.",

Furthermore, cardiac, hepatic or renal impairments, which may happen in patients with severe COVID-19, may require adjustment to ASMs. Finally, adverse effects of both groups of therapies (ASMs and anti-COVID therapies) should be considered. For example, lacosamide prolongs the PR interval and hydroxychloroquine (a drug that is suggested to be helpful in treating COVID-19) prolongs the QT interval in electrocardiogram (ECG) 28. Therefore, administering hydroxychloroquine to a patient with epilepsy, who is already taking lacosamide, may carry an added risk and should be done with precaution and ECG monitoring. Also, QT prolongations may occur with azithromycin and chloroquine and some ASMs (e.g., carbamazepine, lacosamide, phenytoin, and rufinamide) may cause cardiac conduction abnormalities. Co-administration of these two groups of drugs should be done cautiously, with ECG monitoring as appropriate 29\n,\n30.",

One should be prepared to treat seizures appropriately, if they happen in a patient who is already in a critical medical condition.
