Subsequent research revealed exogenous horizontal FeLV infection as responsible for a broad spectrum of neoplastic and non-neoplastic diseases (Cotter, 1998, Hardy et al., 1976, Cotter et al., 1975). Until nowadays, the mechanisms of this disease are not completely understood. The envelope protein p15E has been shown to have immunosuppressive effects (Lafrado et al., 1987, Mathes et al., 1978). Insertional mutagenesis induced by integration of the provirus into the cell genome seems to be associated with tumor development (Levy et al., 1997, Tsatsanis et al., 1994, Levy and Lobelle-Rich, 1992, Levy et al., 1984, Neil et al., 1984).",

            "text": "The classical fatal outcome of FeLV infection is persistent viremia after horizontal transmission resulting in a permanent infection of, among others, bone marrow cells. However, most cats are able to terminate productive FeLV infection after an initial replicative phase in the bone marrow (Hoover and Mullins, 1991, Rojko et al., 1979). Latent FeLV infection is defined by the presence of provirus in the genome without virus protein production (Post and Warren, 1980, Rojko et al., 1982, Pacitti and Jarrett, 1985). Systemic latent infections were first described by Post and Warren (1980). Virus production was reactivated after corticosteroid treatment of previously virus-negative cats. It was shown by different authors that a high percentage of cats initially harboured reactivatible provirus after transient viremia which decreased permanently over time (Pacitti and Jarrett, 1985, Pedersen et al., 1984, Madewell and Jarrett, 1983). Some authors claimed latent FeLV infection as the cause for the presence of antibodies against feline oncornavirus-associated cell membrane antigen (FOCMA) in cats (Swenson et al., 1990, Rojko et al., 1982, Rice and Olsen, 1981). Myelomonocytic bone marrow cells, T-lymphocytes and macrophages were identified as target cells for latent infections (Rojko and Olsen, 1984). For detection of non-productive infection with molecular techniques, exogenously acquired provirus must be demonstrated in the host genome in the absence of viral protein production. U3 sequences, located in the long terminal repeat, are the only parts of the proviral genome showing major differences to endogenous FeLV-related sequences. These endogenous multiple integrated parts of the feline genome are highly homologous but replication deficient DNA sequences and represent phylogenetic remnants of former retroviral infections, which are passed on via the germ cell line (Kumar et al., 1989, Berry et al., 1988, Casey et al., 1981).",

In 16 of the 26 productively infected cats an infection with FeLV subtype A and/or C could be demonstrated by PCR. An additional infection with FeLV subtype B cannot be ruled out in these cases because the applied gp70-PCR did not differentiate between endogenous and B-specific FeLV sequences. Conversely, the absence of the FeLV-A/C-specific band in the remaining 10 productively and in all non-productively infected cats is not indicative of FeLV-B infection. The presence of multiple copies of endogenous FeLV sequences in the genome of the cat may have competitively inhibited sufficient amplification of few or single FeLV-A/C-specific gp70 sequences.",

A possible cause for this decrease may be an increase in vaccination and control measures on the basis of FeLV in loco tests. FeLV vaccination was shown to reduce the rate of productive infections but not to prevent latent FeLV infection (Hofmann-Lehmann et al., 2006). With this background, the high prevalence of 50% non-productively infected cats is not unexpected in spite of the decrease of productive infection. A recent survey revealed a 10% prevalence of latently infected cats in a group of mostly healthy cats in Switzerland (Hofmann-Lehmann et al., 2001). Similar results were obtained by Arjona et al. (2006) in cats from Madrid, Spain, and by Pinches et al. (2006) in blood samples sent to the University of Bristol, UK. Diverging results could be explained epidemiologically: the prevalence of productive FeLV infection varies widely between different geographical regions and origins (Bandecchi et al., 2006, Dorny et al., 2002, Muirden, 2002, Arjona et al., 2000, Knotek et al., 1999, Malik et al., 1997). Furthermore, most cats in the mentioned studies were healthy, whereas in the present study cats died from different disease conditions, and often originated from animal shelters (36%). Differences may also be due to the applied methods of testing. Most studies did not use bone marrow DNA, but DNA from blood or lesional tissue as substrate for PCR reaction. After experimental infection, bone marrow myelomonocytic precursor cells and stromal bone marrow fibroblasts were shown to be able to harbour latent FeLV infection (Linenberger and Abkowitz, 1992, Rojko and Olsen, 1984). In the only other study that used bone marrow as test material, latent FeLV infection was not detected in cats with classical FeLV-associated conditions (Herring et al., 2001). This may be due to the likely lower sensitivity of the detection system in comparison to the highly sensitive semi-nested PCR applied in the present study.",

They demonstrated integrated provirus without detectable virus protein production after experimental infection of vaccinated cats. Furthermore, the recent results indicate that non-productive infection, as common outcome of prolonged exogenous FeLV exposure, has a relatively mild impact on the health status of immunocompetent animals. The latter interpretation is supported by the fact that 30% of the trauma cats were non-productively infected but did not show any other pathological changes. Host immune response could trigger evolution of low-replicative or non-replicative viral mutants during infection (Merezak et al., 2001, Linenberger and Abkowitz, 1992). New results indicate that the majority of circulating viral DNA is transcriptionally active even in the absence of antigenemia shortly after experimental infection (Torres et al., 2008). Replication-defective proviruses could occur for example after provirus silencing through methylation or loss of essential viral sequences by recombination or other molecular mechanisms (Svoboda et al., 1977, Svoboda et al., 2000).",

            "text": "For the first time statistically significant associations between non-productive FeLV infection and different disease conditions could be demonstrated. Interestingly, not only classical FeLV-associated conditions like anemia or suppurative inflammatory processes, but also conditions not yet FeLV-associated, especially panleukopenia and cardiomyopathies, were significantly associated. For panleukopenia, an age-related statistical side effect is not relevant because panleukopenia is a disease of primarily young cats. The same holds true for the non-productively infected cats from animal shelters, which were younger than the non-productively infected cats from private households. Undoubtedly, cats in animal shelters are more often young and therefore their immune response might sometimes not yet be fully developed or can be impaired by stress, etc. The phenomenon of high prevalence of non-productive infection in this subpopulation could be explained by the high risk of getting into close contact with virus shedding cats in crowded facilities (high virus load in combination with a high population density). In contrast, association of epithelial tumors with non-productive FeLV infection could be biased by age. Previous studies have revealed possible pathogenetic mechanisms of latent FeLV infection. Depression of the specific and unspecific cellular immune response has been shown (Lafrado et al., 1989, Olsen et al., 1987). True latent infections are characterized by the possibility to reactivate virus replication. They must be differentiated from infections resulting in proviral DNA that is replication-defective or silently sequestered by host defense mechanisms (Torres et al., 2005). With the PCR method applied in our study, reactivatibility of virus production to define true latent FeLV infection was not proven. The U3 part of the proviral long terminal repeat region (LTR) which is unique for exogenous FeLV infection was identified in the host genome. The LTRs are flanking the viral structural protein genes as 450 bp long DNA regions at both ends of the provirus genome. Formed during reverse transcription, the LTRs have a typical U3-R-U5 sequence structure containing non-coding regulatory sequences important for provirus integration as well as for transcription and replication of virus genes (Goff, 2001, Coffin, 1979). However, the LTR promoter and enhancer regions can also influence transcriptional activity of cell genes without virus protein production (Ghosh et al., 2000). Moreover, the integration of provirus or even proviral parts should be regarded as an infectious mutation that can change genome structure and function (Fujino et al., 2008, Jun et al., 2000). Definite pathomechanisms cannot be deduced from the presented results, as statistical associations are not to be interpreted as a causative linkage between the respective diagnosis and non-productive FeLV infection. The results, however, indicate that the presence of translationally silent proviral sequences can have a negative impact on the health status of affected cats.",
