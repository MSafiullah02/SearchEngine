In fact, although proteome complexity prevents the quantitative profiling of all proteins expressed in a cell or tissue at a given time, higher sensitivity, accuracy, and resolution of new MS instruments allow routine analysis, reaching limit of detection of attomole and dynamic range of 1e6 (Yates et al. 2009).",

In particular, we have explored methods, algorithms, and procedures used for biomarker discovery, by means of label and label-free methods. In this context, we then introduce the main advances of the targeted proteomics (Lange et al. 2008) by investigating the bioinformatics aspects concerning the identification of proteotypic peptides (Craig et al. 2005; Kuster et al. 2005). In the second part of the chapter, we discuss recent advances regarding clinical proteomics application for discriminating sample, such as diseased and healthy. Finally, since most known mechanisms leading to disease involve multiple molecules, we conclude with a discussion of the integration of proteomic data with network datasets, as a promising framework for identifying subnetwork that underlines the emergence of specific phenotypes.\n",

Accordingly, quantification is achieved by measuring the ratio of the signal intensities between the unlabeled peptide and its identical counterpart enriched with isotopes (further details on stable isotope-labeling methods are reported in Supplemental Information). Absolute measurements of protein concentration may be achieved with spiked synthetic peptides, as in QconCAT (Mirzaei et al. 2008), AQUA (Gerber et al. 2003), SISCAPA (Anderson et al. 2004), VICAT (Lu et al. 2007), and PC-IDMS (Barnidge et al. 2004). Quantification is obtained by adding into the sample a known amount of an isotopically labeled peptide. In this way, the level of the endogenous form of peptide can be calculated. Of course, the identity of the peptide must be known prior to analysis by MS. Sometimes, if the m/z ratio of the spiked standard is the same of other peptides, it may lead to an inaccurate quantification. In this case, the ambiguity of the results may be minimized combining these approaches with the selected reaction monitoring (SRM) (Lange et al. 2008).",

They are basically based on counting of peptides identified by means of tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS) or by evaluating the signal intensity of peptides.

One of the most diffused approaches uses the spectral count (SpC) value (Liu et al. 2004) and is based on the empirical observation that more is the quantity of a protein in a sample and more tandem MS spectra may be collected for its peptides. In this context, the normalized spectral abundance factor (NSAF), or its natural log transformation, has been used for the quantitative evaluation with t-test analysis (Zybailov et al. 2006). Other authors have used the protein abundance index (PAI or emPAI) that is calculated by dividing, for each protein, the number of observed peptides by the number of all possible detectable tryptic peptides (Ishihama et al. 2005), while Zhang and colleagues processed SpC values by means of the statistical G-test as previously described (Zhang et al. 2006).",

Census (Park et al. 2008) and MSQuant (Mortensen et al. 2010) software allows protein quantification by processing MS and MS/MS spectra and they are compatible with label and label-free analysis as well as with high- and low-resolution MS data. In addition, Protein-Quant Suite (Mann et al. 2008) and ProtQuant (Bridges et al. 2007) software are attractive because they allow processing of data in different file formats, therefore collected by different types of mass spectrometers. This aspect focuses attention on the standardization of mass spectrometric data for their sharing and dissemination. In fact, over the years, MS instrument manufacturers have developed proprietary data formats, making it difficult. However, to address this limitation, several tools, such as Trans-Proteomic Pipeline (Deutsch et al. 2010), allow the conversion of MS data in standard format, like mzData, mzXML, or mzML (Orchard et al. 2010).",

For this purpose, the STEPP software contains an implementation of a trained support vector machine (SVM) (Cristianini and Shawe-Taylor 2000; Vapnik 1999) that uses a simple descriptor space, based on 35 properties of amino acid, to compute a score representing how proteotypic a peptide is by LC-MS (Webb-Robertson 2009). Similarly to STEPP, a predictor was developed, called Peptide Sieve (Mallick et al. 2007), by studying physicochemical properties of more than 600,000 peptides identified by four different proteomic platforms. This predictor has the ability to accurately identify proteotypic peptides from any protein sequence and offer starting points for generating a physical model describing the factors that govern elements of proteomic workflows such as digestion, chromatography, ionization, and fragmentation. Other authors, like Tang et al., used neural networks (Riedmiller and Braun 1993) to develop the DetectabilityPredictor software that uses 175 amino acid properties (Tang et al. 2006). In the same way, artificial neural networks were used to predict peptides potentially observable for a given set of experimental, instrumental, and analytical conditions concerning multidimensional protein identification technology datasets (Sanders et al. 2007). Finally, random forest (Breiman 2001) was used to develop enhanced signature peptide (ESP) predictor. It was specifically designed for facilitating the development of targeted MS-based assays for biomarker verification or any application where protein levels need to be measured (Fusaro et al. 2009).",

Thus, with the purpose of testing the adequacy/inadequacy of a classifier, after learning is completed, its performances are evaluated through validation set, previously unseen. For this purpose, various methods, such as k-fold cross-validation, bootstrapping, and holdout methods, have been used (Ressom et al. 2008). The most common performance measures to evaluate the performances of classifiers are a confusion matrix and a receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve. The first one shows information about actual and predicted classifications of a classifier and assesses its performances using standard indices, such as sensitivity, specificity, PPV, NPV, and accuracy values (see Supplemental Information). On the other hand, ROC is a plot of the sensitivity of a classifier against 1-specificity for multiple decision thresholds.",

From a standpoint of the data visualization, the possibility to map protein expression onto pathway or network reveals how they are modulated under different conditions, such as healthy and disease states (Gstaiger and Aebersold 2009; Sodek et al. 2008). About that, an unbiased procedure to identify subnetworks which change consistently between different states involves three key steps:\nThe execution of high-throughput proteomic experimentsThe identification of candidate biomarkers by label or label-free methodsThe integration of data into network model to identify clusters of proteins with under, over, and normal expression\n",

For this purpose, systems biology approaches provide a powerful strategy for linking biomarker expression with biological processes that can be segmented and linked to disease presentation. Mass spectrometry-based proteomics is emerging also as a powerful approach suitable to face clinical questions. Even if it is an area of still unrealized potential, clinical proteomics offers the promise of diagnosis, prognosis, and therapeutic follow-up of human diseases.

In this context, several topics concerning data storage, their processing, their visualization, and their interpretation have been faced. However, the need of standards is considered fundamental, and some projects for sharing experimental data between research groups have been launched (e.g., MIAPE, CDISC, and HL7). These should increase meta-analysis, by using raw data from different centers, for helping the development that was grossly underestimated in the initial studies. In addition, as a proteomics community, we believe proteomics methodologies mature for tackling future challenges in clinical proteomics.
