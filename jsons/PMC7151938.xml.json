Given slow progress to date of health education efforts, commitment to and acceptance of recommended prophylactic interventions (vaccines, chemoprophylaxis, personal protection equipment, etc.) and adoption of positive behavior changes by international travelers, the burden of detection for imported infectious diseases among returning travelers will fall on individual healthcare providers and the public health officials to whom they report.",

Two transmission patterns have been described for transmission of pathogens from wild animals to humans by Bengis et al. (2004). One pattern consists of rare events when direct animal-to-human transmission of an animal pathogen occurs, but then direct human-to-human transmission maintains the infection in the human population for a limited time or permanently. Examples of diseases with this transmission pattern are human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), influenza A, Ebola virus, and severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS). The second pattern of transmission is where human infections with animal pathogens result from repeated episodes of direct animal-to-human transmission, or of repeated vector-mediated animal-to-human transmission, and the infections are not usually propagated by human-to-human transmission. Examples of diseases with this transmission pattern are rabies and other lyssa viruses, Nipah virus, West Nile virus, Hantavirus, and the agents of Lyme borreliosis, plague, tularemia, leptospirosis and ehrlichiosis.",

The virus is transmitted to humans by the bite of infected Aedes and Culex mosquitos, including the daytime-biting Aedes aeypti and Ae. albopictus species. Circulation of this virus has been documented in Madagascar, India, and Sri Lanka, where CHIKV is spreading rapidly. The disease has been reported among travelers returning from endemic areas as a cause of acute illness characterized by sudden onset of fever, chills, headache, nausea, vomiting, joint pain with or without swelling, low back pain and rash, similar to the symptoms of dengue fever (Chapter 20). In some patients, residual joint pain and impairment persisted for months after the acute illness.",

Experimental studies show that infected Anopheline mosquitoes can survive in the wheel wells of commercial aircraft, and the putative mode of transmission is that after landing, the mosquitoes are able to fly several kilometers and infect individuals who live near the airports. It is well to remember that many competent anopheline vectors are already present in the USA, and that as recently as the 1930s, malaria was endemic in the Tennessee River Valley. In 19th century summers, malaria was present as far north as upstate New York and Oregon. The prevention and treatment of malaria is discussed in Chapters 6 and 19.",

Chloroquine-resistant P. falciparum (CRPF) strains emerged in Thailand and the Amazon region of South America, but the spread of CRPF to sub-Saharan Africa, where 90% of the malaria cases now occur, has had the biggest impact on morbidity and mortality. Effective vaccines against CRPF malaria are still under development, so prophylaxis with antimalarial drugs such as atovaquone/proguanil, mefloquine, and doxycycline, and personal insect precautions will remain the mainstay of malaria prevention in the traveler.",

Nations can improve the safety of their food and water supplies by adopting integrated approaches to food safety and designating a responsible authority to assure compliance. The Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO)/World Health Organization (WHO) have recently established a new framework of microbiologic risk assessment to guide efforts of member countries in reducing pathogen contamination at relevant points in food production chains. International efforts to implement this approach are necessary to reduce risks to human health in the global food market that prevails at this time.\n",
