This lake is highly eutrophic, containing rich concentrations of nutrients, but the temporal distribution of phytoplankton was generally related to the variations of light and temperature. The effects of light and temperature are perhaps modified by nutrients, particularly when nitrogen and phosphorus are present in surprisingly low concentrations. The effect of mechanical disturbances in the artificial lake also has a significant effect on the growth of phytoplankton and indirectly on consumers, especially fishes.",

This artificial lake is supplied by a canal, \"Kalri Baghar Feeder,\" from the River Indus, arid the water from the lake is pumped to Karachi, a city of four million people, for daily use. It is thus important as the only soiirce of water created artificially to supply this large city. This study was undertaken not only to determine the quality of the water, but also to develop this lake for fishing.",

In tropical regions, the water temperature remains high and uniform throughout most of the year, and day lerigth is also uniform. Vertical sunlight provides maximum penetration cf light into the water. High tcnipr:ttures and strong radiations are thus the principal factors in the tropical areas which are rasponsible for the abundance of phytoplankton (FISH 1956) . It is also obvious that the phytoplankton of tropical lakes tolerates high temperatures (RICKER 1937 , LUND 1949 , SPENCER 1950 , MCCOMBIE 1953 , GEORGE 1962 . Climatic conditions in tropical lakes are therefore unlikely to inipost? limits on production (FISH 1956) , in contrast to temperate lakes where law temperature and light in winter are frequently liniiting factors (RUTTNER 1963) .",

Thus, it seems safe to suggest that the nitrate level is controlled by the bacterial activities and by nitrogen-fixing Cyanophyta, and the irregularities recorded throughout the year may also be attributed to variations induced by these factors. The iiiaxiinuni concentration of nitrate was found in June, which was also the blooniing period of phytoplankton species, especially Microcystis aeruginosa (NAZNEEN 1974) . This shows that, in spite of the nitrate being continuously used up by the algae, there was still an excess aniount left in the water. This niay be due to the regeneration of nitrate in water by bacterial species, such as Achromobacter spp. and Azobacter sp., considerable concentrations of which were observed during this period (NAZNEBN & SIDDIQUI 1976 ) and by nitrogen-fixing Cyanophyta. It has been found that Kinjhar Lake is siiiiilar in some respects to Roshanara Tank, where GEORGE (1962) observed the continuous presence of nitrate in considerable aniounts. GANAPATI (1940) , during his investigations on a fish tank a t Delhi, which contained a permanent bloom of Microcystis aeruginosa, noticed that amnionical nitrogen is a limiting factor for the species in the absence of nitrate. This does not seem to be the case in Kinjhar Lake, as both nitrate and aninionia-nitrogen concentrations were low at the surface in December. The overall abundance of the phytoplankton was, however, lower in May than in Deceiiiber, although the level of aniiiionical nitrogen was high in May conipared to December.",

In Kinjhar Lake, the level of total iron usually did not rise above I nigll. I t has been reported that the iron concentration in water is controlled by p H values, and that it never rises above 1 ppm in alkaline waters, pH 7.2-8.6 (VANKATESWARLU 1969). The results of this study also suggest that the iron concentration is very sensitive to pH, which usually remained within the alkaline range. Besides pH, bacterial activities may also affect the iron concentration (SMITH et al. 1957 , LAMANNA et al. 1973 ) and niay account for some irregulariti-s obssrved during the period of study. A significant amount of manganese was found in Kinjhar Lake. This lake consists chiefly of river water, and it is known that such waters contain relatively large quantities of manganese (TWENHOFEL 1938) . HARVEY (1949) has suggested that nianganese content doer not affcct thz productivity. Moreover, no direct effect of inanganesa on growth of phytoplankton was observed in Kinjhar Lake.",

GEORGE (1962) has suggested that high temperature acts as a principal factor causing blooms of h3yxophyceae. The pattern of phytoplankton distribution reported by GANAPATI (1910), however, is distrupted (Fig. 5 ) in Kinjhar Lake by certain mechanical disturbances during the annual repairing and cleaning periods (generally April or May) ; by the presence of an inlet and an outlet, which iiiainly affect the chemical conditions of the water; and finally by the growth of produoers. The decrease in the phytoplankton population in Kinjhar Lake, caused by certain mechanical disturbances during April or May, was followed by a stidden rise in later months, due to favourable temperatures. The decrease in growth during November was not followed by a sudden inc.reasa because of urifavourable temperatures in the following winter months. It thus appeared that the growth of phytoplankton was more rapid during the high te~l~perature period in the summer months. MCCOMRIE (1953) argued that the water temperature may be a controlling factor for the growth of phytoplankton. These species possess certain temperature tolerance ranges. Between their upper and lower tolerance limits, the species are able to develop sudden pulses of reproductive activity when other factors, such as nutrient availability, are also favourable.",

The abundance of phytoplankton, especially Microcystis aeruginosa, generally followed the seasonal changes in light and temperature. During this study, it was noted that in this tropical environitlent, the seasonal distribution of individual species cannot be described in terms of the four seasons. This i s due to gradual changa in the interaction of light and tenrperature. Kinjhar Lake is highly eutrophic. In spite of their continuous utilization by phytoplankton and other plants, the nutrients were generally found to 702 present in excessive anroiints throughout mast of the year. Phosphorus and nitrogen, however, become limiting factors for phytoplankton during very short periods, when they are present in abnormally low concentrations. The supply of oxygen and varbon dioxide in the lake water was uninterrupted and adequate due to continuous niovermnt of water by the wind action throughout most of the year. &sides t h e hydrological factors, iriechanical disturbances also have an effect on the distribution pattern of the phytoplankton.",
