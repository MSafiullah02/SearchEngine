They provided suggestions for a logical approach to quickly adjust our services to mitigate risk to both medical staff and patients during the pandemic, while social distancing is being encouraged. In this context, there is an ongoing worldwide debate regarding the use of angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors and ibuprofen in patients with COVID-19. The concern is that these drugs could worsen the prognosis of patients with the infection.2\n",

Myocardial injury, indicated by increased serum levels of troponin T, and cardiovascular disease had a significant association with fatal outcomes of COVID-19.6 Moreover, withdrawal of ACE inhibitors could aggravate an underlying disease and make patients more unstable to overcome a coronavirus infection.",

After SARS-CoV-2 binding to ACE2, the viral complex undergo endocytosis and surface ACE2 is downregulated (Figure 1\n). ACE also degrades bradykinin and drugs that inhibit this enzyme lead to an increase in tissue bradykinin and may even trigger cough and angioedema in hypersensitive individuals. We speculate whether the excess of bradykinin in patients taking ACE inhibitors could complicate coronavirus infection, because of its effects of vasodilation, increase in vascular permeability, and cough reflex exacerbation.7 However, no study has been done investigating this hypothesis and current data do not justify the discontinuation of ACE inhibitors in patients at risk or with COVID-19.",

A recent publication stated that ibuprofen also increases ACE2 expression, but the authors did not provide the reference that supports this statement.2 Ibuprofen use could be a marker of disease severity and not necessarily the cause of a worse prognosis. Patients more toxemic and symptomatic, having fever, asthenia, and myalgia, are more prone to use nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs). If ibuprofen is indeed associated with worse COVID-19 outcomes, whether or not a possible association would relate to the specific agent ibuprofen or the larger group of NSAIDs would require further investigation. The European Medicines Agency concluded that there is currently no scientific evidence establishing a link between ibuprofen or NSAIDs and worsening of COVID-19.8\n",
