However, even under conditions of resource scarcity, priority setting processes should not compromise the basic human rights to health and wellbeing of any stratum of the population, especially that of older people and other vulnerable groups. Yet, there is a real risk that the immense pressure on resources exerted by the COVID-19 pandemic may result in the prioritisation of key services across different age groups based on actual or future contribution to society, or on other utilitarian criteria.",

On the contrary, we want to emphasise that resource scarcity and utilitarian calculus should not undermine older people\u2019s rights to receive high-quality healthcare: societies have a moral imperative to protect and respect the dignity and autonomy of older people [2].

Thus, we wish to show how these discriminatory phenomena can cause severe negative outcomes not only from the moral standpoint of respect for dignity and autonomy of older people, but also from the utilitarian perspective of achieving the greatest good for the greatest amount of people.",

Before the emergence of COVID-19, an American oncologist and bioethicist, E. Emanuel, sparked some controversy [6] after writing about his plan to self-impose a cut-off of 75 years for access to any \u2018curative\u2019 treatment and accepting only \u2018palliative\u2019 treatment.6 Such proposals echoed the previous 65 year cut-off advocated by D.

Moreover, not all (older) individuals have the same clinical, psychosocial and other contextual features and expectations. That is, what could be good for Emanuel, Callahan, Patrick and Berardelli may not be good for others. A 70-year-old patient may have a better chance of survival and benefit more from intensive or other forms of medical treatment than a 30-year-old one. Notably there are studies showing how the so called \u201coldest old\u201d \u2013 i.e. patients 90 years old or older \u2013 with early stage lung cancer can benefit from surgery [10].
