A large database study of 72,314 affected Chinese nationals has given a preliminary case-fatality rate of 2.3% with 81% experiencing mild flu symptoms, while rest of the 14% having severe symptoms and 5% being critically ill; death rate increasing exponentially with severity.[1] Although the fatality has till now been reported lower than previous outbreaks of Ebola, SARSandMERSit is expected to rise if IPC (Infection Prevention and Control) policies are not laid down and followed religiously. An estimated Maximum Likelihood (ML) of reproductive number of Covid-19 infection was calculated to be 2.28 with a serial interval of 7 days which can only be curtailed by strict quarantine measures.[2] As anaesthesiologists and intensivists, our prime involvement in resuscitation, airway management, peri-surgical as well as critical care of such cases cannot be undermined. The need of the hour therefore is to update ourselves with clinicopathological spectrum of the deadly disease and provide evidence based medical services to all hospitalized cases with suspected Covid-19 infection. All the recommendations below have been influenced by the past experiences of corona virus outbreaks and desire improved measures for personal protection of health care workers and consequent prevention of nosocomial transmission of infection.",

They were successfully isolated in Kerala and declared negative. Till date,4 deaths have been reported from our country as a result of this deadly virus with old age (more than 60 years), hypertension and male gender being stated as independent risk factors.[4] The real number of patients carrying the virus is very difficult to establish as many people are avoiding the tests and many are not disclosing at all. The real danger to us as intensivists and anaesthesiologists is from these patients who have not been tested despite being potentially positive for harboring the virus. In this scenario, it is prudent to follow the national and international guidelines and treat any suspected patient as positive and to take necessary precautions during anaesthesia and critical care of such patients.",

The negative pressure can be created by reducing the amount of air volume entering the inlet duct, while maintaining the air volume exiting through the other duct. Two adjacent ORs with one being utilized for the procedure and other as anteroom for the staff and doctors to wear and dispose of all PPEs is ideal. The biggest challenge comes from the diversity of operation theater infrastructure set ups in our country which makes it difficultfor the implementation of universal guidelines meant for such outbreaks. Therefore, such surgeries should be undertaken only in select centers with all the facilities. The policies for such clinical interventions have to be formulated by the appropriate health authorities at central governmentlevelwhich can be implemented uniformly across the nation.

The timing of delivery is entirely dependent on the condition of the mother and the fetus, wherein stable cases can be delivered at term vaginally, while critically ill mothers delivered earliest possible. As no shedding of virus has been found in the amniotic fluid, vaginal delivery can be performed but for early cord clamping and maternal separation for 2 weeks postnatally to prevent direct contact transmission.[16] Till date, no guidelines have been issued regarding the anesthetic management of infected pregnant patients for caesarean section. However, spinal anaesthesia have been reported to be safe in one patient undergoing emergency C-section in Wuhan.[17] There is no advisory issued against breastfeeding, but direct suckling from mother's breast is not advocated.
