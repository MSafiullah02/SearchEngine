Fortunately, the 80 ABOS has swiftly and appropriately responded in these unprecedented times by increasing the 81 \"time away\" from residency training activities from 4 to 6 weeks per academic year to provide 82 flexibility, which can further be averaged over the five years of orthopaedic instruction [15].

Residents are, thus, wholly available to participate in the clinical duties required by 100 their program or hospital to prioritize patient care.101With most residencies moving to rotating schedules to protect the resident workforce and 102 balancing the various stages of the pandemic crisis, there is an opportunity to fill that time for the 103 off-duty resident with educational content. Because of social distancing policies, many programs 104 have quickly implemented a virtual curriculum to discuss various orthopaedic subjects in a more 105 intimate, relaxed manner than typical weekly didactic conferences. In addition to online106 meetings, supplemental educational content incorporating computer-based journal clubs and 107 modules from online surgical video databases, such as the Orthopaedic Video Theater (OVT) 108 and Orthopaedic Video Theater plus (OVT plus) through the AAOS, can enhance the digital 109 educational experience. Similar online offerings are also being offered through various 110 subspecialty societies and industry. 111 Because of the overall decreased number of elective orthopaedic surgeries being 112 performed, there is an impetus to provide alternative technical tools for residents. Surgical 113 simulations have been deployed in certain programs and are well studied for select procedures, 114 namely arthroscopy [18,19]. Technologies surrounding simulation are currently being advanced 115 and validated for arthroplasty-related surgical training to expand upon the baseline required 116 arthroplasty modules that are presently only mandated for the PGY-1 year by the ABOS [20]. 117 There are additional options for increasing access to cadaver and bone-substitute simulations 118 (Sawbones, Vashon, WA) as well. 119 The Fellowship Experience 120 After the recommendation by the American College of Surgeons that elective surgery is 121 halted for the foreseeable future on March 13 th , surgeons responsible for arthroplasty fellowships 122 across the nation immediately saw a need for alternative methods to educate fellows [21]. 123 Without the ability to perform hands-on surgical training and implementation of social distancing 124 measures with several \"shelter in place\" orders enacted limiting the ability to meet in group 125 settings, educators' focus shifted to didactics and virtual case presentations. This change 126 happened organically and quickly at the program level with regularly scheduled presentations 127 conducted virtually as well as supplemental didactics. Soon, regional and national collaborations 128 occurred among adult reconstruction fellowship programs to enhance educational opportunities. 129 The American Association of Hip and Knee Surgeons (AAHKS) Board of Directors met 130 on March 18 th , 2020, and by this time, many programs had already begun virtual didactic 131 sessions for fellows. During this board meeting, Dr. William Hamilton, MD of The Anderson 132 Orthopaedic Clinic in Alexandria VA, suggested to the board that AAHKS play a role in 133 amplifying virtual lectures already happening to make them available to every arthroplasty 134 fellow nationwide. \"It was certainly not a novel idea,\" explains Dr. Hamilton, \" as many 135 fellowships in the New York City area were already doing regional meetings, while other large 136 fellowships had transitioned to virtual conferences as well.\" AAHKS leadership agreed to put 137 forth resources to meet the educational needs of fellows by establishing the Fellows Online 138 COVID-19 AAHKS Learning (FOCAL) initiative. 139 The FOCAL program was designed, in part, with information gleaned from a recent 140 survey sent by AAHKS to fellow members. Logistical considerations included opting to present 141 lectures at a time amenable to most time-zones, understanding that clinical responsibilities were 142 limited so early start times were not needed and that the lectures be recorded for streaming on 143 demand. FOCAL content aimed to supplement fellowship curricula with topics on primary and 144 revision arthroplasty including infection, periprosthetic fracture, the hip-spine relationship, and 145 other high yield topics for those soon going into practice. 146 Through gracious volunteering of time and expertise by more than 20 programs, sixteen 147 conferences were scheduled and organized by AAHKS staff through March and April. Each 148 lecture was a one-hour live video-based conference, including didactics, interactive learning, and 149 questions from participants. On average, 120 participants logged into each lecture, the majority 150 of which were fellows and senior residents. Feedback from participants was resoundingly 151 positive. Highlights include the interesting regional differences in managing common 152 complications, interactions with other fellows in an educational setting, and multiple presenters 153 per conference so audience submitted questions could be answered in real-time while the 154 presentation continues.", "latex": null, "type": "figure"}, "FIGREF7": {"text": "156way to supplement learning during the COVID-19 cancellation of elective surgery, virtual can add value to arthroplasty fellowship curricula in the future.

Around the world 164 across all businesses, COVID-19 is forcing us to reevaluate how existing organizations and 165 systems carry out business, to which medicine and education are not immune. It has been said 166 by Dalai Lama, \"It is natural that we face obstacles in pursuit of our goals. But if we remain 167 passive, making no effort to solve the problems we meet, conflicts will arise and hindrances will 168 grow. Transforming these obstacles into opportunities is a challenge to our human 169 ingenuity\"[23]. The manner in which we pass on the orthopedic knowledge of today now faces 170 new obstacles that must be overcome. Proximity and efficiency in relaying this information have 171 been challenged. 172 Large national and regional orthopedic meetings, once a staple of educational solidarity 173 in the past, may feel pressure to move to more virtual platforms. Annual AAOS and AAHKS 174 meetings may become separate dedicated weeks or days in which surgeons spend time viewing 175 advanced pre-recorded lectures with integrated live surgeries and live question and answer 176 sessions via chat rooms. Many of these developing platforms have interactive features such as 177 chat and messaging where listeners can actively interact with the presenters, no different than178", "latex": null, "type": "figure"}, "FIGREF8": {"text": "179presentations in the available lecture space at annual meetings. Now with a virtual 3D 180 environment, this challenge might go away and lower our costs. Listening to two different 181 papers given 5 minutes apart in different locations in the convention center, once physically 182 impossible, is now potentially as easy as a click of the mouse.183 Massive industry sponsored technology halls could now be toured virtually with 184 interactive face-to-face discussions experienced with industry representatives via virtual booths 185 and endless possibilities for product demonstrations. Web-based meetings [24] have become 186 increasingly common, as in-person meetings can be very time-intensive and costly. Virtual 187 meeting platforms have revolutionized the way we can conduct business while decreasing time 188 away from your home institution [25]. There exist tremendous financial savings including 189 decreased travel, hotel rooms, convention hall space, meals, planning and setup. Newer 190 platforms are now being investigated that incorporate artificial intelligence to facilitate pre-and 191 post-meeting tasks and may also help facilitate live meetings [26]. These platforms allow 192 participants to share documents, photos, and videos to enhance learning. Of course the question 193 begs, at what cost. Medicine is a field dependent on human interactions. As a profession, we 194 must critically evaluate whether virtual meetings are the best way to learn and whether or not 195 these methods of learning are a detriment to surgical training? Human networking is a key 196 component of these meetings and would certainly suffer in a virtual world if not implemented 197 with this in mind.", "latex": null, "type": "figure"}, "FIGREF9": {"text": "200 particularly in regards to education.

But,216    orthopaedic surgery remains a skills-oriented profession requiring expanded knowledge 217 acquisition to be effectively complemented with technical skill development. The latter process 218 requires repetition of movement in an environment that replicates similar conditions experienced 219 during both primary and revision total joint arthroplasty. The coming years will likely see a 220 maturation of several virtual learning technologies that will enhance the preparation of younger221 surgeons entering practice and the maturation of more experienced surgeons refining specific 222 surgical techniques.223 Surgical simulators and virtual reality (VR) platforms have been developed for total hip 224 and total knee arthroplasty surgery [27,28,29,30]. VR creates immersive, realistic, three-dimensional environments that involve visual feedback from body movement [31]. Although 226 primarily an entertainment tool at present, it is slowly making its way into training and education 227 as well as surgical skills. VR can either provide augmented or mixed reality [32] and has the 228 potential to increase participant enthusiasm in the educational activity. These platforms provide 229 the opportunity for basic skill development and demonstrate substantial promise for the 230 education of medical students and surgical residents. However, at present, most surgical 231 simulators lack the definition and tactile feedback that are necessary for advanced skill 232 development. While these technologies may help learners to acquire the basic motions for 233 surgical performance, they lack the tactile feedback necessary to reproduce safe and effective 234 surgery and have not been confirmed in the application of advanced techniques used in revision 235 arthroplasty surgery. The post-COVID-19 environment will likely stimulate an emphasis for 236 virtual technology development that, over time, will eventually provide both the visual and 237 tactile feedback necessary to recreate joint replacement surgical reality. Initial applications will 238 likely occur in the areas of primary joint replacement surgery. Effective partnerships between 239 skilled surgeons, educators, and software developers will be necessary to ensure that future 240 platforms address surgeon needs for both basic primary joint replacement and advanced 241 reconstruction techniques. 242 Cadaveric training has been used during the acquisition of new techniques for many 243 surgeons for many years. This provides a safe environment for surgeons to learn and to apply 244 novel techniques for their practice. Surgical procedures carry risks and have been associated 245 with measurable learning curves. Until VR platforms have matured to a point where they 246 replicate both visual and tactile experience, cadaveric training will remain a valuable tool for 247 surgeons refining arthroplasty surgery techniques before their first patient engagements. 248 Because cadaveric training can be accomplished on either an individual basis or in small groups, 249 these remain an attractive kinesthetic laboratory. 250 Visiting surgeon experiences have also been used for both novice and experienced 251 surgeons to refine their surgical expertise. A major detractor for utilization of this experience has 252 centered on travel-related opportunity costs. Contemporary digital platforms allow for these 253 experiences to be brought closer to home. These can allow surgeons to have the \"visiting\" 254 experience with a much smaller time footprint away from their patients, practice, and family. 255 Surgeons can acquire the surgical observation experience at a much lower opportunity cost. 256 When coordinated with other surgical skill development tools, video surgeon visiting 257 experiences may help to complete a remote/isolated surgeon training experience. 258 Surgeons desire and benefit from interpersonal connection and mentoring. Digital 259 platforms and virtual experiences can provide some of the basic pathways to becoming a better 260 surgeon. Ultimately, these technologies will still need to be complemented by face-to-face 261 interaction and fostering relationships, even if it occurs with more limited direct contact in the 262 months and years that follow the current pandemic response. Virtual and digital platforms are 263here to stay and will require a learning curve inherent with all new technology. As noted by a 264 fellow surgeon, Dr. Atul Gawande, \"Better is possible. It does not take genius. It takes diligence.265It takes moral clarity. It takes ingenuity. And above all, it takes a willingness to try\" [33].
