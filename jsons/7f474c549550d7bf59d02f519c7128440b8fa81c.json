Despite of their paramount importance, the transmission routes of SARS-Cov-2 still remain debated among various sectors. Evidences compiled here strongly suggest that the COVID-19 could be transmitted via air in inadequately ventilated environments that are housing the infected by SARS-Cov-2. Existing experimental data showed that coronavirus survival was negatively impacted by ozone, high temperature and low humidity. Here, regression analysis showed that the spread of SARS-Cov-2 was reduced by increasing ambient ozone concentration level (48.83-94.67 \u00b5g/m 3 ) (p-value=0.039) and decreasing relative humidity (23.33-82.67%) (p-value=0.002) and temperature (-13.17-19 o C) (p-value=0.003) observed for Chinese cities during Jan-March, 2020. Besides using these environmental implications, social distancing and wearing a mask are strongly encouraged to maximize the fight against the COVID-19 transmission. At no other time than now are the scientists in various disciplines around the world badly needed by the society to collectively confront this disastrous pandemic.",

In other studies, it was shown that the expiratory droplet size distribution had a peak size at 1.5 \u00b5m (Xu et al., 2017) , and the exhaled droplet nuclei can be transmitted between occupants via airborne route (Ai et al., 2019) .

            "text": "As of this writing, evidences are still accumulating for possible airborne transmission of SARS-Cov-2. Santarpia et al. (2020) recently showed that 66.7% of their air samples collected from negative pressure equipped medical rooms housing 13 confirmed patients appeared to be positive with SARS-Cov-2, and 100% of the personal air samples collected were positive with SARS-Cov-2. In their study, the SARS-Cov-2 concentration levels were shown to reach 8688 copies/m 3 for air sample and 67164 copies/m 3 for personal air samples (Santarpia et al., 2020) . However, J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f droplet PCR. Additionally, they have found floor samples collected from the hospital were positive with the SARS- Cov-2 (Liu et al., 2020) . In contrast, another study conducted by scientists from Singapore showed the air sample collected was found to be negative with the virus, but for the surface sample collected from the ICU ventilation fan the virus was detected (Ong et al., 2020) . This could be due to the deposition of airborne SARS-Cov-2 on the fan surface as a result from the ventilation process. Some of these studies indicated that SARS-Cov-2 was present with a high level up to 67164 copies/m 3 in the air of hospital environments that were housing COVID-19 patients. Nonetheless, no evidence yet up to now was found for the presence of viable SARS-Cov-2, partially because the SARS-Cov-2 culturability was not investigated for many existing studies. However, one study from US NIH showed that the aerosolized SAR-Cov-2 from a liquid can survive at least 3 hours in the air, and the SARS-Cov-2 was shown to have an equal half-life with the SARS in the air (van Doremalen et al., 2020) . In another work, it was shown that SARS-Cov-2 can survive for many days on various surfaces, e.g., for up to 7 days on the outer surface of surgical mask (Chin et al., 2020) . Belonging to the same virus family, the MERS was shown to be able to survive up to 1 hour in the air at a relative humidity of 79% and a temperature of 25 o C (Pyankov et al., 2018) . However, it started to decay rapidly at a lower humidity level (24%) and higher temperature (38 o C) (Pyankov et al., 2018) . It is known that aerosolization process caused significant damages to microbes (Zhen et al., 2013) , and using the same aerosolization process the NIH study still detected viable SARS-Cov-2 in the air even after 3 hours (van Doremalen et al., 2020) , which implies the SAR-Cov-2 had a strong survival ability in the air.",

            "text": "Compared to the man-made aerosolization process, breathing, coughing or sneezing could have lower damaging effects since the virus residing lung environments are more favorable than the aerosolization liquid and the mechanical stress imparted on. For example, it was shown that exhaled influenza viruses retained their immuno-integrity as they could bind to the corresponding antibodies linked to the nanowire sensor . Similarly, aerosolized influenza viruses were also J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f 6 shown to retain their immuno-integrity (Shen et al., 2011) . Previously, it was shown that some fraction of aerosolized MS2 virus, often used as a human model virus, could still survive even with microwave radiation and atmospheric cold plasma treatment, and about 20-90% of the treated MS2 were able to infect the host cell Escherichia coli under specific treatment conditions (Wu and Yao, 2014; Wu et al., 2015) . Recently, National Research Council (2020) also stated that currently available research supports the possibility that SARS-CoV-2 could be spread via bioaerosols generated directly by patients' exhalation. The airborne transmission of COVID-19 could have been already happening in our daily life, e.g., the reported Washington State choir incident (three weeks later, 45 became ill out 60 attendants), and recently in a poorly ventilated restaurant (Li et al., 2020). Speaking itself was recently shown to emit a large amount of droplets, and different loudness resulted in different quantities (Anfinrud et al., 2020) . In addition, the COVID-19 transmission by an asymptomatic patient was also found (Hoelscher et al., 2020). These undocumented or asymptomatic patient transmission add additionally to the mystery of SARS-Cov-2 transmission route, which however can be well explained by an airborne route. In previous studies, for both controlled and natural indoor environments (classroom and subway), fine aerosol particles (around 1 \u00b5m) emitted by humans were shown to substantially predominate over coarse ones (Fan et al., 2017; Xu et al., 2017) .

            "text": "As discussed above, experimental evidences showed that the survival of aerosolized MERS in the air depends on the relative humidity and temperature, and the virus decay was much stronger for hot and dry air scenario with only 4.7% survival over 60 min period (Pyankov et al., 2018) . In another work, it was demonstrated that when ambient ozone concentration level increased the transmission ability of influenza viruses (H1N1, H3N2, and Influenza B) decreased substantially (Ali et al., 2018) . During a typical day in Beijing, it was also shown that when the ambient ozone concentration increased from late morning to early afternoon, the viability of biological particles decreased substantially (Wei et al., 2016) . In considering existing evidences with respect to coronavirus, we performed Spearman's rank correlation analysis (data not normally distributed) using SPSS22.0 (IBM Corporation) and results as shown in Fig 1 revealed that there was a statistically significant negative association between ambient average ozone levels (48.83-94.67 \u00b5g/m 3 ) during Jan-March\uff0c2020 and confirmed COVID-19 cases (log scale) for Chinese major cities(Supporting Information File S1 and Fig S1) (p-value=0.039). In a previous work, it was shown that ozone water (4.86 mg/L) can completely inactivate SARS within 4 minutes (Zhang et al., 2004) . On the other hand, ozone therapy was also used to treat many diseases (Elvis and Ekta, 2011) as it was described that an administrated dose of 30 and 55 \u03bcg/cc could induce greatest increase in the production of interferon as well as tumor necrosis factor and interleukin-2, triggering an entire cascade of subsequent immunological reactions (Elvis and Ekta, 2011). It seems that ozone has double effects with respect to virus transmission and infection control. In contrast, we have detected a statistically significant positive association between ambient average relative humidity (RH) levels (23.33-82.67%) and the confirmed COVID-19 cases (log scale) (p-value=0.002) for the Chinese cities studied J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f 8 as shown in Fig 2. Here, we also detected a possible association between the confirmed COVID-19 cases and the temperature (from -13 o C to 19 o C) (p-value=0.003). The SARS-Cov-2 survival might have an optimal temperature, as some studies showed that above 56 o C would be lethal to the SARS-Cov-2 (Chin et al., 2020). In general, higher ozone level (>73 \u00b5g/m 3 ) and lower RH level (<49%) as observed in Fig S1 would Information File S1). Spearman's rank correlation coefficient (data not normally distributed) was performed using SPSS22.0(IBM Corporation 2013).",

            "text": "Viral infection requires sufficient viral dose and viability as well as the immunity status of the exposed individual. For personal protection both for the medical professional and the public, wearing a mask is important and necessary to effectively minimize the exposure dose especially when entering or staying in a closed or semi-closed environments with patients inside or their past occupancy where the SARS-Cov-2 aerosol could accumulate over the time. However, different masks have different protection efficiencies and different breathability as studied by Zou and Yao (2015) . Typically, N95, or surgical mask had higher overall protection efficiencies of more than 90% against particles of 0.3-4.5 \u00b5m, and reached about 100% for particles of larger than 4.5 \u00b5m (Zou and Yao, 2015) . Therefore, these masks are sufficient for J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f 12 respiratory droplet transmission prevention. For example, a recent work showed that wearing a surgical face mask could prevent transmission of human coronaviruses and influenza viruses from symptomatic individuals (Leung et al., 2020) . For doctor mask, it had a good breathability, but its practical protection efficiencies were lower than those of N95 types (Zou and Yao, 2015) . On the other hand, different face masks have different degree of fitness. For example, because of its rigidity of N95 mask, it was found that nurses wearing a N95 mask still had an infection rate of 22.9% in a clinical setting (Loeb et al., 2009) . Another study also found that wearing a doctor mask can help reduce more the emission of biological agents into the air than wearing a N95 type mask (Xu et al., 2017) , as the doctor mask has better fitness thus preventing exhaled bio-particles from releasing into the air. Accordingly, for healthy individual protection in risky environments it is encouraged to wear a N95 type mask or surgical mask or similar types that are available; and for protecting the environments it is advised for the patients to wear a doctor mask as it would less contaminate the environment by exhaled air (Xu et al., 2017) . As the pandemic is getting worse, many sectors are of shortage of face masks which are in high demand. Accordingly, re-generation of used mask is becoming necessary especially during an urgent need for the public and sometimes even for the medical professionals. Previously, it was shown that microwave irradiation can effectively kill airborne MS2 viruses (more than 90% for 1.7 min exposure at a power level of 700 W) (Wu and Yao, 2014) , and also several log reductions for H1N1 viruses deposited on face mask were achieved (Heimbuch et al., 2011) . And it was indicated that the A protein gene of MS2 was completely damaged upon the microwave exposure, thus losing the viral cell entry ability (Wu and Yao, 2014) . The killing of virus using microwave exposure was due to the adsorption of microwave energy by the polar groups of the virus (Wu and Yao, J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f",

These environmental parameters could not only influence the ambient air, but also indirectly affect those indoors via atmospheric dispersion and penetration. Thus, the survival and infectivity ability of SARS-Cov-2 emitted by COVID-19 patients into the air and onto various surfaces in indoor environments could be affected by these environmental factors. Nonetheless, the detected effects of ambient ozone, humidity and temperature on the COVID-19 could be modified or cofounded by social distancing and wearing a face mask as implemented during the epidemic period. Additionally, air toxicity was shown to vary from city to city on a global scale by using both chemical assay and animal model(Chen et al., 2018; Li et al., 2019). The differences in air toxicities among cities might also affect the viability of SARS-Cov-2, thus on its transmission ability in the air as both outdoor and indoor environments are closely connected via moving air. These data along with the literature evidences collectively support our hypothesis that environmental factors such as temperature, humidity as well as pollutants such as ozone would have impacts on the transmission ability of SARS-Cov-2 for different cities. Accordingly, different cities might have inherently different vulnerability to the SARS-Cov-2 spread in terms with environmental factors.
