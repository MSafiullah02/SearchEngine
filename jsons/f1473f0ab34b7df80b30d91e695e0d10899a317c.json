A variety of different virus families such as rhinovirus, influenza virus, parainfluenza virus, respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), coronaviruses and adenovirus are responsible for more than 95% of all human respiratory infections. The remaining 5% are due to bacterial infections. Typical symptoms of respiratory infections develop one to two days after viral inoculation and include nasal discharge, sneezing, sore throat, cough, headache and general weakness. In severity, the symptoms may vary from a mild \"common cold\" to a severe influenza virus infection, but they still make some 60 million people seek medical advice every year in the United States alone (Bertino 2002) . The National Centre for Health Statistics estimated that in 1996 about 62 million cases of viral respiratory tract infections (VRTI) required medical attention or resulted in restricted activity in the United States. Roughly one in six respiratory infections leads to a doctor's office visit and up to 50% of these visits result in an antibiotic prescription, which mainly treats secondary infections but fails to tackle the respiratory tract infections is illustrated by the fact that in 1998 more antibiotic prescriptions were written for presumed VRTIs than for bacterial",

The relative proportions of these viruses vary and depend on several factors such as season, age but also viral sampling and detection technique. About 30-50% of all infections -generally termed as \"common cold\" -are caused by rhinoviruses of the picornavirus group. This makes common cold the most widespread acute disease in individuals viral respiratory infections are caused by influenza virus, which makes them more severe and sometimes lethal. Most people recover from the illness; however, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) estimates that in the United States an average of 36,000 persons die from influenza and its complications every year, most of them elderly people. Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) is the main cause of infant bronchiolitis and pneumonia. The virus is ubiquitous, highly infectious and reaches epidemic proportions every year during the winter months. In the total population, primary viral infection (Bertino, 2002) .

Approximately 5-15% of all approximately 5% of all VRTI cases are caused by RSV. Parainfluenza virus can cause upper and lower respiratory tract infections in both adults and children (3%). Coronaviruses are found in 7-18% of all adults suffering from that human coronaviruses account for up to 35% of cases of upper respiratory illness. While it is clear that human coronavirus can play an important role in respiratory outbreaks a much lower frequency is found in families, i.e. adenovirus and enterovirus, account for minor shares of respiratory infections. The fact that up to 30% of VRTIs are not assigned to a certain virus species is probably due to suboptimal sampling and detection An analysis of available epidemiology data has shown a distinct and consistent seasonal pattern in the occurrence of respiratory viruses (Monto 2002a) . In temperate regions of the northern hemisphere, rhinoviruses account for up to 80% of all viruses circulating in early autumn (Arruda spring is an even more dangerous time for rhinovirus transmission. Although overall rates of respiratory diseases are lower in summer, rhinoviruses are the type of virus that is most frequently isolated at that time of the year. In winter, other viral agents, among them influenza viruses, parainfluenza virus and respiratory syncytial virus, predominate in the northern hemisphere (Monto 2002b) . methods in some cases (Heikkinen et al. , 2003) . and Gwaltney et al. , 1966) .",

Temperatures above 37.8\u00b0C in the initial stage of the disease indicate influenza rather than other virus infections. Early identification of respiratory viruses is essential for effective diagnosis and patient management, as only for influenza virus causative treatment is available. Methods for identifying viruses include viral culture, antigen detection and highly sensitive molecular biology techniques based on polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Isolating viruses in cell culture is considered the gold standard but of limited relevance in clinical practice because it is too slow. Several antigen detection tests are available for diagnosing influenza A and 2002). Due to the high number of human rhinovirus (HRV) serotypes, detecting these viruses by immunological methods is not easy although PCR methods are available.

Targeting specific proteins of viruses basically has the advantage of being less toxic for cells with a narrow antiviral spectrum, while targeting cellular molecules might yield compounds with a broader antiviral activity. In the first case, the likelihood of generating druginsensitive mutants is high, while this risk is unlikely in the latter case. The concept was proved for both strategies, e.g. in infections with human rhinoviruses. One example is the successful use of inhibitors targeting the viral proteinase 3C in HRV. A cellular approach was taken by the use of interferon to stimulate cellular defense against rhinovirus.

Infection begins with the deposition of viral particles in the anterior nasal mucosa or in the eye, from where the virus can be transported to the nose via the lacrimal duct. At the mucosal surface, virions attach themselves to cellular receptors. Based on receptor specificity, rhinoviruses can be divided into two groups: the viruses belonging to the \"major group\" attach themselves to the cellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1), whereas \"minor group\" viruses bind to the LDL receptor or LDL-related proteins internalization and uncoating, the viral plus-strand RNA is translated into one large polyprotein, which is proteolytically processed by two viral proteases -2A and 3C -into the individual viral proteins. Replication is mediated via a minus-strand RNA intermediate and catalyzed by the viral 3D polymerase. Resulting RNA molecules can then be used for translating viral proteins or are packaged into viral particles in a late phase of the infection. Viral proteinases specifically cleaving factors such as the eukaryotic initiation factor 4G required for cellular cap-dependent translation turn the host cell into a virus producing machine (host cell shutoff) (Etchison et al. involving direct binding of ribosomal subunits to internal ribosomal entry sites, which facilitates virus production. In addition, this host cell shutoff limits the defense response to the viral infection e.g., the interferon response, mediated via destruction of the host cell. Surprisingly and differently to patients infected with influenza virus, individuals infected with rhinoviruses show no major tissue destruction in nasal biopsies. This observation suggests that the clinical symptoms of rhinovirus infection might not be due to cell bind to heparan sulfate proteoglycan (Vlasak et al. , 2005) . Following as cellular translation is inhibited (Weber et al. , 2004) . Viral release is , 1987).

The serotype HRV 89 is reported to destruction mediated by virus replication (cytopathic effect) but are primarily caused by the immune response of the host. Several inflammatory mediators can be found in the nasal secretion of patients with common cold, e.g. interleukin 1, 6 and 8, histamines, leukotriens and kinins. Interleukin 6 and 8 levels correlate with the severity of symptoms. In contrast to the proinflammatory reaction, rhinovirus can even down-modulate an appropriate immune responses by inducing immunosuppressive cytokine interleukin immunological host response to rhinovirus infection is far from being fully explored. On average, colds take one week, although 25% of all cases last longer. Viral shedding can be observed up to three weeks, though the risk of",

The best studied interferon induced antiviral proteins are the 2'5' oligo adenylate synthetase, protein kinase R and the MX GTPases. From experiments in knock-out mice it became importance of the interferon response to viral infections is clear, their mode broad induction of a cellular antiviral response inter-feron were used as \"general\" antiviral medication.

However, in clinical trials, pirodavir was efficient from a promight be attributed to poor pharmacokinetics. Currently new molecules the capsid-binding substance that has been tested most extensively. It is effective against a variety of rhino-and enteroviruses, orally bioavailable and was studied in more than 5,000 patients in clinical trials. If pleconaril treatment is started early, it reduces the duration and severity of the disease Drug Administration did not approve pleconaril (Picovir\u2122) in May 2002, mainly because of the observed induction of cytochrome P450 3A enzymes, which metabolize a variety of drugs, e.g. oral contraceptives. A new intranasal formulation of pleconaril is currently developed by Schering-Plough. Intranasal application should enable a more efficient delivery of the drug to the site of infection than the oral formulation, while limiting its systemic exposure and thereby minimizing the risk of drug interactions. Such other capsid-binding substances as BTA 798 are in the stage of early preclinical development.",

Mutations in the active sites of these proteinases lead to total inhibition of virus multiplication. Structurally, both proteases are related to trypsin-like serine proteases. Functionally, however, the active site amino acid is replaced by a cystein residue. Sequence comparisons among several HRV serotypes have demonstrated a high degree of homology among amino acid residues involved in the active site of the such other cellular cysteine proteases as caspases, they are an attractive Determination of the three-dimensional structure of the 3C protease and subsequent modeling led to the identification and development of specific activity against several HRV serotypes, HRV clinical isolates and related 2005). Importantly, AG-7088 is also effective when added in cell culture post infection, which might be an advantage compared to capsid-binding substances. Data from in vitro and phase I and II studies suggest that AG-(rupintrivir) significantly reduced total cold symptoms and was well tolerated. Prophylaxis lowered the share of subjects with positive viral cultures and viral titers. Surprisingly, it did not reduce the frequency of colds, nor did early treatment decrease the frequency of the disease though it lowered the severity of daily symptoms.

In addition, an orally bioavailable inhibitor of HRV 3C protease was identified. A Phase I trial showed bioavailability and inhibitor for clinical use is not continued. It should be noted that 3C proteinase inhibitors are effective against a variety of HRV serotypes, as most of the amino acids critical for binding the protease inhibitor are In principle, the 2A protease of HRV is also an attractive target for therapeutic intervention. The protease activity is essential for virus multiplication; it is highly specific to its cognate cleavage site. In the life cycle, the protease is directly involved in cleaving the translation factor eIF4G, which shuts off host cell translation. So far, no specific inhibitors for the HRV 2 protease are available. Recently, we could show that the methylated form of a commonly used caspase inhibitor, zVAD.fmk, inhibits HRV2 2A protease in vitro and in cell culture, leading to an inhibition undesired side effect discovered in experiments aimed at specific inhibition caspases are usually employed as methyl-esters to facilitate cell permeation. Inside the cell endogenous esterases cause the demethylation of the inhibitors. We could show that the methylated form specifically inhibits 2A activity, whereas the de-methylated form does not. This is in good agreement care must be taken when a \"specific\" inhibitor is used and exemplify, that inhibition of 2A protease does indeed lead to the block of HRV multiplication.",

In the United States, rimantidine is frequently used because of its lesser side effects. In clinical trials, amantidine reduced the duration of the disease, though side effects and the frequent emergence of resistant Based on the crystal structure of the influenza virus neuraminidase, zanamivir was developed as a specific inhibitor of this enzyme. Zanamivir is applied as inhalation and has been shown to be efficient and safe for treating influenza virus. Moreover, it is licensed for clinical use.

When treatment is initiated within 48 h after infection, the duration of the disease is reduced by 1 to 2 days. Since these drugs target influenza virus only, they do not protect patients against infections caused by other viruses involved in viral respiratory infections. This means, within this limited time frame, influenza has to be correctly diagnosed versus rhinovirus and other viral respiratory infections.

We have shown so far that PDTC does not affect early steps in HRV infection such as virus attachment, internalization and uncoating. However, polyprotein processing and What is the mechanistic basis of this inhibition? PDTC is widely used as a specific inhibitor of the transcription factor NF-\u03baB in eukaryotic cells. The molecular mechanism by which PDTC inhibits NF-\u03baB is not yet elucidated and results obtained by different groups are contradictory. Depending on which cellular system is used, both antioxidative properties and prooxidative effects of PDTC have been described. Furthermore, inhibition of the ubiquitin-ligase system was discussed as being involved in the inhibition of NF-\u03baB. An important question is whether the NF-\u03baB inhibitory property of PDTC is related to its antiviral effect. Regarding this aspect, we believe that the inhibition of NF-\u03baB is not important during rhinoviral infection. The transcription factor NF-\u03baB is activated during picornaviral infection. However, as the viral proteinase 2A leads to a fast shut off of host cell transcription during infection, it seems unlikely that NF-\u03baB -mediated genes have a major effect on the replication of HRVs, because the corresponding mRNAs cannot be translated. Certain NF-\u03baB-induced genes may translate via a capindependent mechanism, though experimental evidence for this theory is lacking. We have also shown that replication of HRV in cells, in which NF-\u03baB is constitutively inactivated by overexpression of the cellular inhibitor I\u03baB, cannot be distinguished from controls with functional NF-\u03baB pathways. Other inhibitors such as aspirin also fail to exert an antiviral effect against HRV. From these data we conclude that the widely known NF-\u03baB inhibitory .",

These approaches might lead to a more sustainable inhibition of viral replication as the emergence of resistant viruses is very unlikely.",

The diverse nature of the viruses involved is one reason for the problematic situation. Viruses have developed a number of strategies to evade common inhibition approaches. However, we believe that aiming at cellular rather than viral targets might improve the accessibility of viral diseases. It remains to be shown in further clinical trials whether new molecules are suitable for viral inhibition. New technologies such as siRNA techniques have yielded surprising results in the first years of development and offer a significant potential for treating viruses that have bothered people for many centuries.",
