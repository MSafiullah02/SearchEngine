It bridges the time between infection and the delayed activation of the adaptive immune response ( Fig. 1A and B) . Moreover, cells of the innate immune response, such as monocytes, dendritic cells and NK-cells assist in the proper activation of the adaptive immune response. In order to activate the immune system, recognition of pathogens is required, followed by the secretion of cytokines that induce an antiviral state in the area and recruit innate immune cells. Some of the most critical cytokines that control viral infections are type I and type III interferons, both of which signal through different receptors, yet activate the same downstream signaling partners. Type I interferon can be produced by most cell types, whereas type III interferon production is predominantly restricted to epithelial cells in the intestine [1] . The importance of interferons is underpinned by the numerous studies demonstrating that animals lacking the receptors for these cytokines are hypersusceptible to infection with numerous different microbes and succumb to infection before mounting an effective adaptive response [2] .",

These sensors, through various signaling cascades, activate the pro-inflammatory transcription factors AP-1, NF-kB and/or one or more members of the interferon-regulatory factor (IRF) family. This ultimately results in the release of pro-inflammatory cytokines and interferons (IFNs). These signaling cascades are divergent and intertwine at several steps. Regulation of innate immune signaling relies on posttranslational modifications such as conjugation of ubiquitin and UBLs. This topic has recently been reviewed in [3] [4] [5] , however the focus of this review will be on how innate immune signaling is more a dynamic response instead of a sequential signaling pathway and that signaling through the innate immune pathways requires an equilibrium of ubiquitin and UBL conjugation and deconjugation.",

For example, substrates modified with a chain of at least four K48-linked ubiquitin units are selectively degraded by the 26S proteasome, which is an integral part of protein turnover and cellular homeostasis [8, 9] . Although most chain types have since been implicated in proteasomal and/ or lysosomal degradation to some extent, K48 linkages are believed to be the predominant proteasomal degradation signal in the cell [10, 11] . In contrast, K63-and linear chains are often implicated in the regulation of signaling pathways and in the activation of signaling kinases (Fig. 1C) [12, 13] . Keywords: Ubiquitin E3 ligase Innate immunity DUB Infection A B S T R A C T Detection of invading pathogens by pattern recognition receptors (PRRs) is crucial for the activation of the innate immune response. These sensors signal through intertwining signaling cascades which result in the expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines and type I interferons. Conjugation, or binding, of ubiquitin and ubiquitin-like modifiers (UBLs) to a plethora of immune signaling molecules forms a common theme in innate immune regulation. Numerous E3 ligases and deubiquitylating enzymes (DUBs) actively modify signaling components in order to achieve a balanced activation of the innate immune system. This review will discuss how this balance is achieved and which questions remain regarding innate immune regulation by ubiquitin and UBLs.",

There is an astounding degree of diversity in ubiquitylation enzymes, and mammalian genomes have been estimated to contain 10 E1 enzymes, 100 E2 enzymes and 1000 different E3 ligases (Fig. 1D ) [28] . Not only conjugation of ubiquitin and UBLs regulates innate immune responses, deconjugation is also a critical component of the system. Approximately 100 ubiquitin and UBL deconjugating enzymes (DUBs) have been identified in the human genome [29] . DUBs are required for generating the mature forms of ubiquitin and UBLs by cleavage of precursor proteins, thereby exposing the C-terminal glycine residue required for conjugation. Additionally, DUBs function in the reversion of regulatory ubiquitin and UBL conjugation (Fig. 1C) . They are often specific for a certain UBL, the ubiquitin chain topology and the substrate [29] . DUBs are therefore an integral part of the regulation of the signaling cascades in which ubiquitin conjugation plays a role, which includes several innate immune response pathways. Several classes of DUBs have been recognized [30] , and in the case of innate immune regulation, the ovarian tumor domain-containing (OTU) DUBs seem to play a major role. Among them are DUBA, OTUB1, OTUB2 and A20 [31] [32] [33] . Another DUB that is critical in the regulation of the innate immune response is CYLD, which belongs to the USP DUB class [34] . Since so many enzymes are involved in the conjugation and deconjugation, post-translational modification by ubiquitin and UBLs allows for precise and dynamic adjustment of signaling pathways and their ultimate effect in the (infected) organism.",

            "text": "Although the ability to effectively mount an immune response during infection is critical for survival, prolonged or excessive-activation of the innate immune system can have detrimental effects. For example, highly pathogenic influenza virus strains, such as the 1918 H1N1 'Spanish flu' virus and several highly pathogenic H5N1 viruses, are potent activators of pro-inflammatory genes. The resulting 'cytokine storm' during infection is thought to contribute to the high mortality associated with these viruses [52] . In addition, regulation of the innate immune system is important to prevent the development of auto-immunity. Several immune disorders, such as Systemic Lupus Erythematosus (SLE), Crohn's Disease, Blau syndrome, type I diabetes, multiple sclerosis and rheumatoid arthritis, have been linked to dysregulation of the innate immune system [53, 54] . Only for a few of these diseases some aspects of the underlying immune dysregulation have been identified. For example, a link between mutations in the cytosolic NOD2 sensor and susceptibility for developing Crohn's disease and Blau syndrome has been found [53, 55] . Also, increased levels of IFN-a have been detected in SLE patients, which correlated with severity of the disease [56] . Onset of type I diabetes could be delayed in non-obese diabetic (NOD) mice, which spontaneously develop type I diabetes, by blocking the IFNAR, suggesting that IFN signaling plays a role in determining type I diabetes onset and progression [57] . In these mice, plasmacytoid dendritic cells in the pancreatic draining lymph nodes produced higher levels of IFN-a compared to control mice, which led to activation of CD4 T Cells and subsequent development of disease [57] . Determining what activates the type I interferon system and why it has adverse effects involved in these diseases will help in the development of new, more specific treatments with less side-effects than current immunosuppressive drugs used to treat some of these diseases. To facilitate mounting of an effective immune response during infection, but also subsequent restoration to a resting state once the infection is cleared, the type I IFN system should be dynamically regulated. This dynamic nature ensures a balance between the extremes of insufficient activation (resulting in death or persistent infection by the pathogen), on the one hand, and overactivation, resulting in hyper-inflammation and tissue damage on the other hand (Fig. 1A) .",

One possibility to explain this apparent discrepancy could be that ubiquitin chains covalently attached to K172 facilitate the binding or synthesis of unanchored ubiquitin chains, and therefore both observations may not be necessarily mutually exclusive to describe the mechanism of RIG-I regulation by ubiquitin. Mutation of K172 decreased RIG-I ubiquitylation [60] , which is seemingly more consistent with a model of covalent ubiquitin conjugation to this lysine in RIG-I. Apart from the suggested role of TRIM25 in the ubiquitin conjugation to K172 [60] however, also Riplet was reported to conjugate K63-chains to K154, K164 and K172 in the CARD domains of RIG-I, which was required for downstream signaling [64] , and which could therefore also explain the loss of ubiquitylation after K172 mutation. The exact role of Riplet-mediated modification of the CARD domains remains uncertain, because it was not required for the in vitro RIG-I activation [61] . One possibility is that, due to the nature of in vitro experiments, not all factors are present and Riplet-mediated conjugation might serve to alleviate inhibition by (non ubiquitin-mediated) negative regulators such as NLRX1 and gC1qR [65, 66] . Moreover, knockout mouse models have shown that both TRIM25 and Riplet are both pivotal in the innate immune defense against RNA viruses and loss of either of these E3 ligases abolishes IFN production after viral infection [60, 67] .",

Since free chains do not ''encode'' any other signal than the linkage specificity, the question arises: what makes chains from TRIM25 activate RIG-I and chains from TRIM5a activate the TAK1 complex? One possibility is that these free chains are very volatile signals that can rapidly activate a signaling complex and are subsequently degraded by the DUBs present in the cytosol. Since in vitro most DUBs can efficiently break down purified free ubiquitin chains (depending on chain topology in some cases) it is likely that free K63 chains are degraded rapidly after synthesis and present a very dynamic mechanism for signaling complex activation [84] . Since DUBs have been reported as integral components of large ubiquitylation complexes, it is also not unconceivable that ubiquitin chains function within the complexes they were synthesized in and do not 'float' around free in the cytosol where they could engage unintended targets. Along those lines, one would predict that the number and activity of the conjugating and de-conjugating enzymes within those complexes establish an equilibrium between continuous synthesis and degradation of ubiquitin chains. Such an equilibrium could be very transiently and rapidly shifted 'left' or 'right' by modifying the number and the activity of the different enzymes in the protein complex or disengaging the intended target of the ubiquitin chains.",

Since IKK is activated by phosphorylation of the IKKa/b subunits and TAK1 is capable of phosphorylating those subunits in vitro (a catalytic mutant was unable to do so), a model was proposed in which TAK1 phosphorylates IKKb [71] . In contrast, activation and auto-phosphorylation of the IKK complex by binding of free ubiquitin chains to NEMO has been proposed based on in vitro studies [13] . Contrary to the requirement of K63 chains for TAK1 activation, the activation of IKK was independent of K48 or K63 linked ubiquitin. Moreover, the E2-enzyme involved was identified as UbcH5 (instead of Uev1A-Ubc13), which forms chains of various linkages. This suggested that distinct ubiquitin chain types could be involved. Moreover, due to the ability of NEMO to both bind and be modified by linear ubiquitin chains, it is possible that chains bound to one NEMO subunit are recognized by another and then oligomerize due to this interaction. This could then lead to auto-phosphorylation of the bound IKKa/b subunits similarly to how TAK1 can activate itself in vitro [13] . In conclusion, the function of the linear ubiquitin chains in the classical IKK complex activation has not been fully clarified yet.",

Most knowledge about the activation of the IKK complex is inferred from the canonical pathway, yet the exact functions of NEMO in each different pathway remain unclear. It is not unlikely that as a results of multiple signaling cascades culminating in the activation of the IKK complex (TNFa, TLR signaling, CD40, IL-1, etc.), each pathway differs slightly in its method for activating the IKK complex.

For example, results from IKKe knock-out mice have suggested a predominant role in the activation of STAT1 following IFNAR signaling [94] . While TBK1 has been linked to selective autophagy of intracellular pathogens such as Salmonella [95] . How the functions of IKKe and TBK1 relate to each other and how their respective functions fit together remains to be elucidated. For downstream signaling, TBK1 also requires K63-ubiquitylation by mind bomb proteins after dsRNA signaling and by Nrdp1 after LPS signaling [96, 97] ; yet the major activator for IKKe is still unknown (Fig. 3C ).

Taken together, LUBAC has so far been found to positively regulate NF-kB signaling (Fig. 2) , but negatively regulate antiviral signaling ( Fig. 3A and C) . These findings indicate that LUBAC is involved in directing the innate immune response to a more pro-inflammatory instead of antiviral response. An E3 ligase that has the opposite effect is Nrdp1, which activates TBK1, but targets TLRs for degradation by K48-linked ubiquitylation [96] .

IRF3 is ubiquitously expressed in most cell types whereas IRF7 is an ISG and is only expressed by leukocytes in the absence of infection [50] . Phosphorylated IRF3 and IRF7 can form homo-or heterodimers, each of which has different promoter specificity. IRF3 homodimers are created when there is a low supply of IRF7 (so in the absence of ISG expression) and initiate production of chemokines such as CXCL10 to attract innate immune cells. Conversely, IRF3/IRF7 dimers potently activate type I interferon production, but this can only occur in innate immune cells or cells already stimulated with type I interferon [50] . IRF7 dimers regulate the expression of a subset of ISGs as well as type I IFN by binding to specific ISREs to ensure proper induction of the antiviral state in the absence of IFNAR signaling [103] . TRIM21 has been found to regulate both IRF3 and IRF7. Binding of TRIM21 to IRF3 stabilized IRF3, whereas it targets IRF7 for proteasomal degradation by K48 ubiquitylation [104, 105] . Studies using TRIM21 knockout mice found that loss of TRIM21 increases NF-kB dependent cytokine expression in embryonic fibroblasts, yet no effects were observed in vivo [106] . The net result of TRIM21 activity is therefore still uncertain, and variations in cell types used or different isoforms of TRIM21 might explain its different functions. However, there are only very few examples of transcription factors being regulated by ubiquitylation like this. Another far more common mechanism affecting transcription factors, including the ones involved in innate immune signaling, is SUMOylation.",

TRIM28 was identified as the E3-ligase for IRF7 SUMOylation, yet a SUMO E3 ligase for IRF3 has hitherto not been identified [108] .

Members of the PIAS protein family are SUMO E3-ligases and are involved in the regulation of a variety of innate immunity transcription factors [110] . The PIAS proteins were identified as inhibitors of STAT proteins, possibly by prohibiting interaction of STAT with DNA or other co-factors through protein-protein interactions. However, the biological relevance of the SUMO E3ligase function of the PIAS proteins remains unclear.

They are often capable of deconjugating different ubiquitin chain linkages as well as ISG15, whereas mammalian OTU domaincontaining DUBs are ubiquitin chain specific [113] . Ectopic expression of these viral DUBs increases global ubiquitin and ISG15 deconjugation, however, it remains to be determined how the promiscuous activity of these enzymes is regulated during infection. Viral proteases of arteriviruses are able to inhibit RIG-I activation by deconjugating the K63 chains required for RIG-I activation [116] , and more targets within the innate immune response cascades are likely to exist. Other examples of viral proteins interfering with the function of E3-ligases exist, such as Influenza A Virus NS1, which specifically binds TRIM25 thereby inhibiting RIG-I activation [117] . Some large DNA viruses, such as herpes-and poxviruses even encode their own E3 ligases. Herpesviral E3s target the cellular E3 ligases RNF8 and RNF168 for degradation, which has been proposed to facilitate reactivation from latency [118, 119] . Given that viral enzymes are often hard to recognize purely based on their sequence, more viral E3 ligases and DUBs likely still remain undiscovered.",

In order to achieve that balance, numerous E3-ligases and DUBs actively regulate the outcome of the innate immune response. The basic components and signals of the signaling pathways are well characterized, but how the different components interact is less clearly understood. Often signaling molecules are assembled into large complexes. However, the stoichiometry and localization of the different molecules in these complexes in time have remained relatively poorly studied thus far.

It seems logical that the interpretation of a ubiquitin signal by UBDs, of which over 150 types divided over $20 classes have been discovered, would also be very specific [122] . However, the affinity of UBDs for ubiquitin chains is often relatively low, which raises the question how signaling complexes are assembled by ubiquitylated proteins. Either multivalent interactions of multiple UBDs with multiple conjugated ubiquitin molecules or enhancement of a weak existing interaction between two proteins can be considered. Alternatively, the ubiquitin-UBD interactions could be less specific and/or very transient in dynamic molecular structures where a relatively high local ubiquitin (-chain) concentration can be maintained. Under such circumstances, target specificity could be achieved by target availability in the complex, or by e.g. specific interactions between the target and one or more UBLs that would bring it close to the regulating ubiquitin groups.",

Insufficient activation leads to uncontrolled infection, but hyper-immunity is detrimental to the host. A balanced activation of the innate immune signaling, at least partly regulated by UBLs, is required for pathogen clearance and host survival. (B) The innate immune response is a swift response, which is required for control of the initial infection and activation of the adaptive immune response. (C and D) Conjugation of UBLs involves sequential activity of three classes of enzymes, E1-activating enzymes, E2-conjugases and E3-ligases. DUBs remove conjugated UBLs from substrates. The functions of different ubiquitin chain linkages are listed with corresponding references, as well as the general functions of the other UBLs.",

Activation of RIG-I signaling is regulated by several distinct ubiquitylation mechanisms. (B) The TAK1 complex can be activated by K63 chains (bound or free) from a variety of inputs as listed. Once the TAB2 and TAB3 subunits bind K63 chains, TAK1 auto-phosphorylates and initiates downstream signaling.
