This study investigates the frequency of viral persistence after acute asthma, assesses viral infectivity and determines the host inflammatory responses to viral persistence. Methods: Adults and children presenting to hospital with acute asthma and a confirmed respiratory virus infection were studied acutely and at recovery 4-6 weeks later by clinical evaluation and induced sputum for viral and inflammatory mediator detection.",

The following viruses were detected at recovery: human rhinovirus: 16; respiratory syncytial virus: 2; influenza: 2. In subjects with viral persistence, eight isolates were different to the virus detected at Visit 1. Forty-four per cent of the human rhinovirus isolates were infective at recovery. Asthma and infection severity were similar in the viral clearance and viral persistence groups.Viral persistence was associated with elevated IL-10 mRNA and inducible protein-10 gene expression. Conclusions: Respiratory viral detection after acute asthma is common, and most often persistence is with non-infective human rhinovirus. There is a host inflammatory response with an altered cytokine environment, and the viral RNA can be source of persistent infection. These effects may have longer-term consequences in asthma.",

Respiratory viral infections, in particular human rhinovirus (HRV) infection, represent the main causal factor. 1 An innate immune defect in asthmatic epithelium 2 can result in enhanced virus replication in virally induced asthma. 3, 4 HRV, an RNA virus, is readily degraded by RNase activity and, consequently, shedding of HRV is typically expected to occur only briefly during a viral infection. The impaired interferon response in asthmatic epithelium that has been observed in vitro could result in delayed viral clearance, 2 and several reports have documented persistence of HRV nucleic acid in 44-50% of children, at 6 weeks after presentation to the emergency department with acute asthma 5 or wheezing. 6 Several studies have also reported detection of HRV nucleic acid in up to 35% of asymptomatic subjects. [7] [8] [9] The unexpected persistence of viral RNA in the upper respiratory tract of asthmatic children indicates a possible connection between viral infection and recurrent asthma. The clinical implications of these findings are unknown; however, airway hyperresponsiveness persists after virus infection in asthmatic children.",

The viral RNA observed most frequently to persist was HRV; however, persistence of the same infectious HRV was uncommon. When infectious virus was detected at recovery, it was often a different virus. The consequences of persistence of viral RNA were examined by assessing several disease domains. The clinical severity of the exacerbation and its recovery were similar whether there was clearance or persistence of viral RNA. In addition, the extent of cellular airway inflammation was similar between groups. However, viral persistence was associated with altered cytokine production, with elevated IL-10 and IP-10 gene expression. These results suggest that the cellular inflammation that results from viral replication is responsible for the clinical manifestations of a viral infection in asthma, rather than viral replication itself. The period between infection by HRV and elimination of the virus with a negative PCR assay is not well described; however, HRV persistence has been seen in other circumstances. In vitro RV culture has been shown to decline rapidly (over less than 2 days). In most experimental infections, RV shedding detected by virus culture reaches a peak around 48 h after viral challenge, then rapidly declines, remaining positive for up to 3 weeks. 19 Gern et al. 20 found that experimental RV infection cleared by 14 days in 50% of adults. In clinical samples, HRV RNA positivity has remained detectable longer than culture positivity. Among young adults with a common cold, PCR was positive after 7 days in 45% of cases. 21 Enteroviruses may be shed for up to 2 weeks from the nasopharynx and several months in faeces. 22 Asymptomatic carriage of HRV has been identified in 5-35% of Results are median (IQR), Wilcoxon rank sum test.

In asymptomatic children with no past (4 weeks) or future (2 weeks) respiratory symptoms indicating a clinical infection, the viral detection rate was as low as 5%. 9 Persistence of RNA viral infection has been previously reported. Measles virus persistence has been associated with subacute sclerosing panencephalitis (SSPE). 24, 25 More recently persistent hepatitis C virus infection has been identified. 25 It has been suggested that several conditions must be met for viral persistence to occur. First, the virus should infect the cell without being cytopathic. The most common persistent virus in this study was HRV. HRV typically infects a host cell without causing cell death, and in asthma, apoptosis is suppressed after HRV infection. 2, 4 Second, the viral genome must be maintained. For those RNA viruses that do not integrate into the host genome, such as HRV, continued replication at a low level is required to maintain infection. This has been shown to occur with RSV where gene transcription continues after the acute infection. 26 Third, the virus must avoid immune detection and elimination. Although specific antibodies to HRV develop after infection, their ability to protect against infection can be limited. After RSV infection, viral persistence can occur despite the presence of virus-specific IgG. 26 Effective T-cell responses are critical to eradicate acute viral infections and prevent viral persistence. It has recently been shown that virus-specific CD4 T cells can be functionally inactivated early during the transition into viral persistence and fail to produce effector cytokines, thereby compromising an efficient and effective antiviral immune response. 27 If these mechanisms were to occur after HRV infection, this could lead to viral persistence.",

Subjects with viral persistence experienced a recovery of clinical features and improvement in inflammatory cell counts, even in subjects with persistent infective virus. This observation is interesting, as it implies that there are host defence mechanisms controlling the response to virus that are adequate to inhibit viral-induced airway inflammation and clinical disease. Future identification of these responses could be very important. Viral persistence was associated with altered cytokine responses, with an ongoing elevation of IL-10 and IP-10 gene expression. A similar observation has been made with RSV persistence, where RSV-RNA could be detected in lungs of infected mice for up to 150 days after the initial infection, 26 associated with persistent chemokine gene transcription. 13 The longer-term consequences of viral persistence and this modified host response warrant further study. In addition, validation of these gene expression findings with protein measurements is an important area for further research.",

Hence, it is possible that the three HRV species, HRV-A, HRV-B and HRV-C are represented among the samples with a generic HRV result. Indeed, a recent report of virus infection in children with acute asthma found that HRV was almost universally present and identified 52 HRV strains, including 16 HRV-C strains. 33 Differences in the persistence of different strains and serotypes of HRV are not well understood. This highlights the need for further typing of HRV species in future work.",
