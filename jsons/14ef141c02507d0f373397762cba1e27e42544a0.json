Mortality rates have been disproportionately high among Hispanic and African American individuals. In NYC, death rates for these groups are nearly double those in Caucasians or Asians, but the factors contributing to this racial disparity remain unclear 2 . Furthermore, reducing mortality among all critically ill individuals is the highest priority, although some clinical risk factors have been noted in recent publications 3, 4 , there remains much to learn about which patients are at highest risk, what factors are most indicative of disease progression and prognosis, and which interventions may be effective.",

To assess the effects of individual covariates on clinical outcomes over time, we estimated the cumulative incidence functions (CIFs) for in-hospital death and discharge using a univariate competing risks survival analysis. In our full cohort, we estimated that by 10 days postdiagnosis, patients have a 51.1% chance of being recovered and being discharged from the hospital and a 21.7% chance of death (Fig S2) . By grouping our cohort using different demographic and hospitalization factors, we found the differences in time-adjusted mortality among different racial groups (p=0.003, Gray's test) is more enriched in Caucasian due to its older age group (Fig. S1B ), but no differences in the CIFs of the recovered patients (p=0.408) ( Fig. 2A) . We also found females have better outcomes compared to males; they have trend with lower mortality rates (p=0.064) and significantly higher discharge rates (p=2.36e-4) over time ( Fig. 2B) , which translates to shorter in-hospital stays. Hospitalized patient outcomes also differed by hospital and care area types within hospitals, including ICUs, medical and surgical units, and other specialties (Fig. 2C-D) . We found that patients admitted to hospitals in Brooklyn and Queens experienced significantly worse outcomes (Gray's T=248.9; p<2e-16) compared to three hospitals based in Manhattan (Fig. 2C ). This can be attributed at least partly due to the relatively older COVID-19 cohorts in Brooklyn and Queens compared with the Manhattan hospitals (Table S2) . As expected, we also observed drastically worse outcomes for all patients admitted to ICU care areas compared to other care areas (Fig. 2D ).",

While we did observe higher rates of COVID-19 diagnosis among African American and Hispanic individuals, we did not observe any impact of race on mortality among inpatients. Consistent with previous reports 3,4 , we found that older individuals and men were at higher risk for mortality, as were critically ill patients cared for in the ICU. We also found that mortality varied by hospital. We identified many clinical features significantly associated with morality that may be important factors to monitor during hospital admission including respiration, temperature, heart rate, white blood cell count, creatinine, and ALT. We also estimated hazard ratios for survival, identifying oxygen saturation, ICU care, elevated creatinine and ALT as strong predictors of mortality. Finally, we developed a prognostic model to forecast risk for mortality using only baseline features, which we hope will help clinicians and hospitals identify individuals at highest risk earlier on in disease progression.",

These areas are also more densely populated (e.g., persons per household is higher relative to Manhattan), making viral isolation more challenging 16 . It is also consistent with racial differences in occupation -African American and Hispanic residents are less likely than residents of any other race to be able to work from home, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics 17 . This puts these groups at increased risk of infection through elevated exposure. Positive case rate differences may also in part be due to limitations on number of available tests in high case density places. According to testing rates made available by NY State (https://github.com/nychealth/coronavirus-data) combined with population estimates 15 , 3.5 residents in Brooklyn and 2.7 residents in Queens per 100 have been tested, while 4.2 per 100 have been tested in Staten Island, for example. Test availability may have resulted in biasing testing among those residents to individuals more likely to be positive, thus artificially raising the positive rate by testing fewer individuals seen as less likely to be positive (e.g., asymptomatic individuals). Fewer tests also reduce the ability to track and contain the virus, so this may contribute to higher case rates, as well. While we are encouraged to report no in-hospital differences in mortality by race, the burden of mortality will remain disproportionately held by African American and Hispanic individuals until rates of infection can be targeted and reduced.",

We found that average age in patients admitted in Brooklyn or Mount Sinai Queens was higher and oxygen saturation is lower than those in Manhattan (Table S2 ). Rates of comorbidities were also higher in Queens, as well (56% with any comorbidity versus 36-47% at other hospitals). Another contributing factor may be case prevalence differences by borough.

They also reported many significant differences in lab values, including C-reactive protein, d-dimer, ferritin, and procalcitonin. These lab tests were not routinely collected on all of our patients, however, among patients with available measures, we were able to corroborate their evidence that higher baseline measures of all aforementioned labs were associated with mortality (Table S3 ).

However, given the urgent need for prognostic indictors amidst the ongoing pandemic, we believe this report, the largest and more diverse population to date, provides an important initial summary of clinical features associated with mortality and can facilitate risk assessment and care. While further studies are imperative, our ability to use modeling techniques to assimilate and analyze large data sets quickly and efficiently provide a complimentary approach as we await vital data from clinical trials.
