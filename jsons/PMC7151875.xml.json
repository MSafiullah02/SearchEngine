            "text": "The cell wall of bacteria is unique. It consists of a backbone of N-acetyl-glucosamine and N-acetyl-muramic acid residues linked to polypeptides, polysaccharides and lipids, called \u2018peptidoglycan\u2019. Peptidoglycan is responsible for the rigidity of the cell wall, and maintenance of the characteristic shape of an organism. Gram's stain differentiates bacteria into those that take up and retain a complex of crystal violet and iodine, and those that do not. This ability is a function of the cell wall. Gram-positive organisms (stained blue/black) have a cell wall consisting largely of peptidoglycan linked to teichoic acids. In contrast, the cell wall of Gram-negative organisms (usually counterstained pink) is far more complex with an outer membrane of lipoprotein and lipopolysaccharide (also unique to bacteria), separated from the peptidoglycan layer by the periplasmic space. This arrangement has important consequences for the ability of Gram-negative bacteria to neutralize the activity of certain antimicrobial agents such as the cell wall active \u03b2-lactams (penicillins and cephalosporins). Peptidoglycan is synthesized with the assistance of transpeptidases, also known as penicillin-binding proteins (PBPs), which are a target for \u03b2-lactams. This group of antibacterial agents is thus acting against a metabolic pathway unique to bacteria, with consequent low toxicity to eukaryotic cells. The presence of \u03b2-lactamases in the periplasmic space may result in the bacteria being resistant to these agents. Mycoplasmas are unique among bacteria in not having a rigid cell wall, while the chlamydiae lack peptidoglycan. Not surprisingly, these bacteria are essentially resistant to \u03b2-lactams.",

Resistance to lysis by serum is a feature of the Enterobacteriaceae, associated with the presence of lipopolysaccharide at the cell surface. Initial contact with the host may be facilitated by a variety of adhesions. Once attached, the next obstacle will be the host's immune system. The presence of a capsule, with or without antigenic similarity to the host, or the production of a protective biofilm may protect the organism. More sophisticated evasive mechanisms include the production of proteases that cleave IgA, a feature of pathogens invading via mucosal surfaces such as Neisseria spp., or coating with host proteins, such as fibronectin as found in T. pallidum. Chlamydia trachomatis is able to prevent the fusion of lysosomes to the intracellular phagosome containing the infectious elementary body; thus the host protects the invading organism from destruction.",

Because organisms will continue to divide at ambient temperature, specimens should be kept at +4\u00b0C and transported to the laboratory as soon as feasible. Some organisms, for example chlamydiae and viruses, survive better at \u221270\u00b0C. The use of a conventional deep freeze at \u221220\u00b0C is satisfactory for preserving bacteria and storing serum samples, but is lethal to chlamydiae.

This is because a false-positive diagnosis is more likely to mislead than a false-negative one. In the latter situation clinical impression will override the negative report from the laboratory. Non-culture detection tests provide two useful functions. First, they may be used in situations where rapid diagnosis has important therapeutic and public health consequences, e.g. in meningitis. Second, the tests are useful to diagnose pathogens that are difficult or slow to isolate in the laboratory. The best example of this group is in the diagnosis of chlamydial infection. Because of the need for cell culture to isolate the organism, the development of non-culture detection tests has served to highlight the prevalence and importance of the organism, and also to make diagnostic facilities more widely available. The disadvantage is that the tests are of variable sensitivity, and in some hands specificity is less than optimal. Direct immunofluorescence tests are of good sensitivity, but are subjective; in contrast enzyme-immunoassay systems are of high specificity, but generally of lower sensitivity. The importance of this discussion is that, in low prevalence populations, a low sensitivity (around 90%) may lead to a positive predictive value of under 50%.

Bowel organisms are capable of synthesizing vitamins. The interactions of the various species of organism found on the skin are important for maintaining a healthy integument by production of fatty acids and other substances that inhibit the growth of potential pathogens. Disruption of this delicate balance will result in symptoms; for example antibiotics that affect the normal gut flora will result in a change in the proportion of different bacterial species, with overgrowth of some at the expense of others. This imbalance is manifest by diarrhoea.

The downward displacement autoclave relies on the incoming steam to displace air from the load. Any combination of air and steam will result in sterilizing conditions not being achieved. Therefore a downward displacement autoclave using the UK cycle cannot be used to sterilize wrapped loads or loads with narrow lumens, such as liposuction cannulae. To achieve reliable air removal and steam penetration, a vacuum autoclave is required, which draws a high pre-vacuum before steam is introduced to the autoclave chamber. It is important that the instruments placed in a downward displacement autoclave are packed loosely, not placed within impervious containers. In contrast a high vacuum autoclave is packed tightly to physically remove the bulk of air in the chamber. Recently, benchtop vacuum autoclaves have been developed. These allow small wrapped loads or a few items with lumens to be processed away from sterile service departments. These machines must not be overloaded.

The asexual phase of the organism (bradyzoite) is able to develop in the tissues of a wide variety of vertebrate hosts, including humans. The definitive host is the cat, both domestic and wild cats, in which the sexual cycle occurs in the intestine. Human infection rates may be as high as 90% in some populations. Infection is most often acquired by ingesting bradyzoites in undercooked meat. It may also follow ingestion of oocysts containing tachyzoites resulting from the sexual cycle in the intestine of a cat, which are then excreted in its faeces. Cat litter trays and garden soil contaminated with cat faeces are a likely source to be avoided in pregnancy. After ingestion, the tachyzoites are distributed to many organs and tissues via the bloodstream and invade nucleated cells in all parts of the body and fetus. They multiply within the host cells, disrupting them by producing tissue cysts containing large numbers of slowly metabolizing bradyzoites. Focal areas of necrosis occur in many organs, particularly the muscles, brain and eye. Human infection is usually subclinical but may produce a glandular fever-like syndrome or choroidoretinitis. Transplacental infection may occur during an acute infection in the mother, which may not be diagnosed but may result in serious disease in the fetus. Infection early in pregnancy may result in a stillbirth, or the birth of a live baby with disseminated infection. Features include: choroidoretinitis, microcephaly or hydrocephalus, intracranial calcification, hepatosplenomegaly and thrombocytopenia. Maternal infection during the third trimester can also be transmitted to the fetus, but at this stage of development it usually causes no damage. Controversy surrounds the benefits of antenatal screening. Maternal infection may go undetected unless serological screening is carried out, but a single estimation of antibody may give rise to unnecessary anxiety because of infection before pregnancy began, which carries no risk to the fetus. A rise in the mother's toxoplasma antibody titre during pregnancy or the finding that she has IgM antibodies, indicating recent infection, raises the question of whether to treat the infection, given that treatment does not guarantee the infant will be unaffected, or to terminate the pregnancy even though it is not certain that the fetus has been damaged.

Single-stranded RNA viruses are classified as positive or negative strand according to the way in which coding information is stored in the viral genome. With positive-strand RNA viruses, the viral genome is of the same polarity as messenger RNA, and may itself act as messenger RNA, being translated into code for virus-specific proteins. With negative-strand viruses, a complementary RNA copy of the viral genome, or part of it, acts as messenger RNA. One further group of RNA viruses known as reversi viruses replicates by reverse transcription of viral genomic RNA to form a DNA intermediate, from which both messenger RNA and progeny viral genomes are transcribed.

Cubic symmetry is more complex and describes a group of regular units which have symmetry properties in common with a cube.

Combination antiretroviral therapy has reduced the HIV transmission rate, and studies suggest that chemotherapy together with delivery by caesarean section further reduces the risk of transmission to 1\u20132%. Infection may be transmitted in utero but occurs more frequently during delivery, or when breastfeeding. In contrast to HIV-1, HIV-2 is transmitted in only about 1% of cases, and this is almost certainly a manifestation of the much lower maternal viral load present. If HIV infection occurs in utero, it is usually possible to establish a diagnosis during the first few weeks of life. If infection occurs during delivery or via breastfeeding, or in infants born to mothers on antiretroviral treatment, it may take considerably longer to establish a diagnosis of HIV infection in infancy. Diagnosis of HIV infection in infancy is usually made by detecting the virus by molecular techniques; serological techniques are of limited value since maternal antibody may persist for up to 18 months.",

Although it is recommended that women with evidence of a recurrent lesion at delivery should deliver by caesarean section, transmission is rare; studies from the Netherlands have shown that the risks of acquiring neonatal HSV following caesarean section and vaginal delivery are not significantly different. Testing mothers with a history of recurrent herpes, or whose partners give a history, is no longer recommended, since virus shedding in late pregnancy does not correlate with transmission to the neonate.
