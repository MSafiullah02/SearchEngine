Both opportunistic and traditional organisms are important causes of infection. The risk for specific infections varies with timing posttransplant, exposures, and the degree of immunosuppression. Because the array of pathogens is diverse, the risk factors not necessarily modifiable, and the causative exposures not consistently anticipated, prevention of infection is a complicated and imperfect process. Moreover, the clinical presentation of infection may be atypical in the setting of immunosuppression, making diagnosis more difficult. Concurrent coinfections with multiple organisms can occur, and in some cases, it is difficult to differentiate infectious from noninfectious causes of patient presentations. Because transplant recipients are chronically maintained on immunosuppression, they are at especial risk for more severe presentations of infection, even with organisms traditionally associated with more benign courses. Prompt and accurate diagnosis is imperative to ensure optimal outcomes.",

The choice of immunosuppression plays an important role in specific infection risks. For example, T-cell depleting therapies, including antithymocyte globulin, increase the risk for opportunistic infection, and mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) inhibitors have been associated with skin and soft tissue infections (Table 40.1\n).2 The risk for infection also reflects a recipient\u2019s exposures. This includes pretransplant infections that have the potential for latency (e.g., herpesvirus infections, tuberculosis [TB]) as well as infections associated with the transplant including donor-derived and hospital-acquired infections. In the posttransplant setting, new exposures related to environmental and community interactions need to be considered. In some cases, these exposures can be anticipated based on predictive risk periods posttransplant and appropriate prophylaxis can be administered during the highest risk period to reduce the risk for infection; antivirals directed against cytomegalovirus (CMV) are an example of risk mitigation. A thorough evaluation of all potential recipients and donors is critical to manage infection risks.",

            "text": "All potential transplant candidates should undergo screening to identify both active infections that may have an effect on transplant eligibility and latent infections that may reactivate after transplant and affect patient outcomes (Table 40.2\n).3 The screening process should include a thorough history of prior infections, environmental exposures associated with infection risks (including current and prior locations of residence, occupations, hobbies, and pets), and close contacts with communicable diseases such as TB. A careful physical examination should be performed. Laboratory testing should include serological testing for herpesviruses (CMV, herpes simplex virus, varicella zoster virus, and Epstein-Barr virus [EBV]), human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), hepatitis B virus (HBV), hepatitis C virus (HCV), syphilis, and Toxoplasma gondii. In situations where window period infections for HIV, HBV, or HCV may be suspected or if there is concern regarding underlying immunodeficiency that may reduce the sensitivity of serological testing, nucleic acid antibody testing should be obtained. Tuberculin testing is especially important; either interferon gamma release assays (IGRAs) or intradermal tuberculin purified protein derivative (PPD) placement can be performed. Since both tests have reduced sensitivity in patients with end-stage renal disease, a detailed history focusing on common risk factors and radiography are important components of this evaluation.4 For patients with a history of birth or prolonged residency in places where there are increased risks for geographically associated infections (e.g., strongyloidiasis, Chagas disease, coccidioidomycosis, and histoplasmosis), additional serological testing for the specific organism should be considered.3 During the pretransplant evaluation, immunization histories should be reviewed and vaccines updated as appropriate (see immunization section; Table 40.3\n).",

Whether this impacts on the quality of donor information is unknown. In both cases, laboratory testing should mirror that of the transplant candidate with specific attention to active infections at the time of deceased donation and infections that may reactivate in an immunosuppressed transplant recipient (including herpesviruses, endemic mycoses, and parasitical infections) in both living and deceased donors (see Table 40.2). Live donors may be evaluated for latent TB using either intradermal tuberculin PPD testing or IGRA.8 Given the limitations of TB testing in the setting of deceased donor evaluation, it is especially important to obtain historical information and radiography to assess the potential for deceased donor latent infection.8 The presence of potentially transmissible donor infections may not exclude a donor from transplantation. Donors with bacteremia, meningitis, or other bacterial infections that do not involve the kidney have been successfully used and may be considered, assuming that the donor has been appropriately treated for 24 to 48 hours and there are acceptable antimicrobial treatment options. 6, 9, 10, 11 Latent infections in the donor including TB and endemic mycoses may be treated with appropriate antimicrobials after transplantation. Donors who are actively infected with organisms that do not have effective treatment options should be excluded. Special attention should be paid to deceased donors with undiagnosed central nervous system (CNS) processes as these donors have been implicated in severe and fatal donor-derived infections, including West Nile Virus, rabies, and Cryptococcus; consequently the risks associated with using these donors must be balanced with the need for transplantation.12\n",

The Public Health Service (PHS) increased risk donor (IRD) criteria attempt to identify donors at risk for window period infections and disease transmission. The absolute risk for disease transmission overall is quite small, but varies based on the risk behavior, the infection in question, and the testing methodology; for example the risk for HIV transmission from a donor who was incarcerated with negative nucleic acid testing (NAT) and antibody testing is 0.9 per 10,000 but the risk for HCV infection from a donor with active intravenous (IV) drug abuse and antibody testing alone is 300 per 10,000.14, 15, 16 The prevalence of PHS IRDs is increasing and IV drug users represent the largest proportion of this group of donors.17, 18, 19 Compared with deceased donors overall, PHS IRDs are more likely to be young and male and less likely to meet expanded donor criteria20; despite the better organ quality afforded by these donors, these organs are more likely to be discarded (odds ratio [OR], 0.67; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.61 to 0.74).20 However, for recipients who accept these organs, outcomes are equivalent to those observed with non-PHS IRDs.18, 20\n",

Primary infection occurs frequently when a CMV-seronegative recipient receives a CMV-seropositive donor kidney with clinically apparent infection in approximately 45% of recipients in the absence of prophylaxis.52 Infrequently, primary infection is the result of blood transfusion or close/intimate contact with an individual shedding CMV in their secretions (community acquired). Recipients with primary infection due to organ transplantation are more likely to experience CMV shortly after cessation of prophylaxis. When recognized early, these infections may have limited symptoms with viremia as the most common manifestation. Community-acquired CMV may occur at any time after transplant and because it often is unanticipated, may be more severe. Since the majority of adults are CMV seropositive at the time of transplant, this mode of acquisition is more common in pediatric settings. Reactivation of latent- recipient CMV is less common with rates varying based on the choice of immunosuppression; induction with antilymphocyte therapies is associated with a higher incidence of CMV. There are multiple genotypes of CMV; gB 1 is most common.54 Superinfection typically occurs when both donor and recipient are CMV positive. Because CMV genotyping is not typically performed, the true incidence of CMV superinfection is not known. However, as CMV occurs more commonly in D+/R+ recipients than in D\u2013/R+ recipients, it is likely that the donor strain is the causative agent of the majority of these infections.55\n",

            "text": "MHC-restricted, virus-specific, cytotoxic T lymphocytes play a major role in the control of CMV; consequently immunosuppressive agents that interfere with this host response increase the risk for CMV.56 Specifically, the use of antilymphocyte antibodies (a frequent component of induction therapy) that ablate lymphocyte function for prolonged periods and prompt the elaboration of proinflammatory cytokines is associated with CMV, as they both allow for reactivation of latent virus and enhance viral replication. Viral reactivation may be promoted by azathioprine, mycophenolate, and cyclophosphamide. Although calcineurin inhibitors (CNIs) are not drivers of reactivation, they do allow for amplification of reactivated virus; tacrolimus is more potent than cyclosporine.57 The use of mTOR inhibitors may reduce the risk for reactivation.58 In addition to the net state of immunosuppression as defined by the choice of immunosuppression, risk factors for the development of CMV include CMV-seropositive donor, especially if the recipient is CMV seronegative, allograft rejection, coinfections with other viruses (HHV 6), host factors (including genetic factors), and severe hypogammaglobulinemia.44, 59 Recently, assays designed to assess the cell-mediated immune (CMI) response have been used to assess the risk for CMV. One example of this is the QuantiFERON-CMV assay, which assesses cell-mediated immunity by measuring interferon (IFN)-gamma levels produced by CD8-positive T cells following in vitro stimulation with CMV antigens.60 Individuals with reduced responses to CMV stimulation were at greater risk for CMV; those who failed to respond to any stimulation were at the highest risk. Allograft rejection and CMV have a uniquely bidirectional interaction, whereby the proinflammatory environment created by rejection and the additional treatment with immunosuppressive agents prompt the reactivation and amplification of CMV and CMV upregulates antigens that promote alloreactivity leading to acute and chronic rejection syndromes.40, 48, 61\n",

This requires initial consideration based on the clinical presentation and risk assessment. Recipients presenting with unexplained cytopenias, GI complaints, or both should be assessed for CMV, especially if they have risk factors and have recently suspended prophylaxis. Currently, assays targeted at detection of viremia are most commonly used for diagnosis.62 In particular, NAT uses polymerase chain reaction (PCR) technology to measure CMV DNA in plasma to rapidly and accurately determine the presence of CMV in the blood. This assay is quantifiable and higher values typically correlate with more severe disease. It also can be used to follow the course of treatment as effective treatment is accompanied by resolution of viremia. NAT has been notable for interlaboratory variability but the development of an international standard has reduced this variability; regardless comparison of values between different laboratories can still be confusing.63, 64 Antigenemia testing (a semiquantitative fluorescent assay that stains circulating neutrophils for CMV early antigen [pp65]) can be used to assess viremia. Similar to NAT, this assay can be used to follow the response to treatment. Both assays may be negative in the presence of active infection, especially GI, neurological, and retinal CMV.62 Consequently, histopathological diagnosis remains the gold standard for CMV diagnosis and patients with consistent clinical syndromes and negative tests for viremia should undergo tissue biopsy.40, 62 Because of the delay in diagnosis and lower sensitivity, neither culture nor serological testing is routinely used for CMV diagnosis.",

Universal prophylaxis involves administration of an antiviral during a risk period typically defined by the recipient and donor\u2019s CMV serostatus. The preemptive approach uses quantitative assays to monitor for CMV reactivation/infection at specified time points posttransplant. Patients with evidence of CMV are then treated with antivirals. There are advantages and disadvantages to both strategies.62 Prophylaxis may reduce the indirect effects of allograft rejection and opportunistic infection and decrease the risk for infection with other herpesviruses; the cost and toxicity of prolonged antivirals may be impediments to this approach. The preemptive strategy may reduce the cost of medications and the medication-related adverse events and it also may allow for more effective recovery of the host immune response.

Cytopenias may occur and involvement of the allograft, GI tract, lungs, liver, and CNS have all been described; extranodal disease is especially common with late PTLD. Constitutional B symptoms are sometimes present. Quantitative NAT of whole blood, peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs), plasma, or serum is often used as the first step for the diagnosis of acute EBV and PTLD, but there are a number of issues that limit the utility of this assay for diagnostic purposes.73, 76 It is important to recognize that specimen selection has a major effect on viral load measurements, since higher viral loads will be seen with whole blood cells or PBMCs. Furthermore, there is still some interlaboratory variability related to the absence of an international reference standard, making it difficult to compare results obtained from different laboratories. Finally, it is important to recognize that PTLD can occur in the absence of viremia and in the presence of viremia may occur in the absence of PTLD. Histopathological diagnosis is ultimately required to make the diagnosis. The World Health Organization has devised criteria for staging PTLD based on the clinical presentation, with early (stage I) disease defined as benign polyclonal proliferation, stage II polymorphic disease, stage III monomorphic B- or T-cell lymphoma/neoplasms, and stage IV disease defined as classical Hodgkin lymphoma.79\n",

In vitro data suggest that sirolimus and cyclosporine may have inhibitory effects on BK viral replication, whereas tacrolimus is permissive, suggesting that reduction of tacrolimus may be most beneficial in eradicating BK infection.105 Both short- and longer-term data suggest that immunosuppression reduction results in BK viral clearance in the majority of patients and does not have a negative effect on allograft or patient survival.104, 106, 107 At our center, we discontinue the antimetabolite and monitor BK viral loads every 2 to 4 weeks thereafter; if the viral load does not respond, we then decrease the CNI, aiming for a 25% reduction in the trough level. Anecdotally, we have had success in clearing BK infection in patients with persistent viremia despite tacrolimus trough levels in the 4 to 5 ng/mL range by switching them to cyclosporine and aiming for a trough level of 50 to 75 mg/dL. Serum creatinine must be monitored closely during this period of reduced immunosuppression.",

The growing opioid abuse epidemic has increased HCV infection rates in certain regions of the United States, leading to an increase in both overdose deaths and donors with HCV infection. Historically, the use of HCV-positive organs has been restricted to recipients with genotype 1 infection. Because donor HCV genotyping is not available before transplantation, clinicians assume HCV-positive deceased donors have genotype 1 infection, since this the most prevalent genotype in the United States. However, superinfection with other HCV genotypes is possible.

A recent propensity score matched analysis performed using United Network for Organ Sharing (UNOS) data to address this question found that transplantation with a HCV-positive donor was associated with an increased risk for death (HR, 1.43; 95% CI, 1.18 to 1.76; P < 0.001) and graft loss (HR, 1.39; 95% CI, 1.16 to 1.67; P < 0.001) among HCV-positive recipients, an effect that was not explained by differences in acute rejection (OR, 1.16; 95% CI, 0.84 to 1.61; P = 0.35).129 Given the time frame of the study, it is unknown if DAA eradication of HCV would have changed the outcome. The use of HCV-positive donors for HCV-positive individuals is associated with shorter wait times to transplantation (\u223c1 year less on average) but recipients should be counseled about the risks and benefits associated with the use of these donors.130 Whether HCV-positive donors may be safely used for HCV-negative recipients is currently an area of study now that the potential treatment options for HCV have expanded.131 Presumably, donors who are not viremic are much less likely to transmit HCV via transplantation; consequently there has been increasing interest in using these donors.

Currently, the greatest number of therapeutic options exist for patients with genotype 1 infection, but this area is rapidly changing (the American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases [AASLD]/Infectious Diseases Society of America [IDSA] guidelines provide the most current treatment recommendations and are continuously updated as new information becomes available).133 Kidney function and DAA-immunosuppression drug\u2013drug interactions must be taken into account when a DAA regimen is being selected. Sofosbuvir-containing regimens are not approved for use in patients with a glomerular filtration rate less than 30 mL/min. Regimens that contain simeprevir can increase cyclosporine levels and elbasvir/grazeprovir, when coadministered with cyclosporine increases grazeprovir levels. In addition, regimens that require ritonavir boosting (such as dasabuvir/ombitasvir/paritaprevir) will result in major increases in CNI blood levels and require significant CNI dose adjustment; these regimens are generally avoided in the posttransplant setting. CNI levels have been shown to fluctuate even after DAA treatment is completed, highlighting the need for careful monitoring of kidney function and drug levels both during and after therapy. Prescribers also need to be aware of issues of viral resistance, with appropriate testing for NS5a resistance mutations of genotype 1a patients depending on the regimen selected, as well as reports of hepatitis B reactivation while on HCV therapy. Treatment of HCV in kidney transplant recipients should be managed carefully with combined efforts by hepatologists, infectious disease specialists, and transplant nephrologists.",

Protease inhibitors (PIs), historically a main component of ARV regimens, are potent inhibitors of the cytochrome P450 (CYP)3A enzyme system, which is the main metabolic pathway for CNIs. When PIs and CNIs are coadministered, the result is higher CNI levels, necessitating CNI dose reductions. For patients on a PI and cyclosporine this means a four- to fivefold lower cyclosporine dose with a 50% increase in the dosing interval, whereas patients on tacrolimus and a PI require an 80% dose decrease and a sevenfold increase in the dosing interval.155 Non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NNRTI) generally induce CYP3A enzyme activity and cause subtherapeutic levels, but individual effects can vary by NNRTI; this can be more easily overcome by increasing the CNI dose to achieve the desired trough level. In light of these complex interactions, many transplant professionals prefer the use of PI-free regimens whenever possible, favoring regimens based on integrase inhibitors, which permit more \u201ctraditional\u201d CNI dosing and have been shown to be both safe and effective in the transplant setting.156 Alternatively, one could consider using belatacept in EBV seropositive recipients to avoid CNI\u2013PI interactions, which has been described in several case reports.157\n",

Extrapulmonary sites often require tissue biopsy for pathology and culture. Galactomannan obtained from serum or bronchoalveolar lavage can be a useful adjunct to diagnosis but a negative serum galactomannan does not exclude the diagnosis.172 The treatment of choice has been voriconazole, although there are significant drug interactions that must be managed, especially with CNIs and mTOR inhibitors.172 In addition, the IV formulation of voriconazole includes a cyclodextran base that can cause hyperviscosity when administered to individuals with CKD.

Although relatively uncommon, mortality can be quite high. Increased immunosuppression, especially with agents that reduce the absolute CD4 count, high doses of corticosteroids, CMV, rejection, and proximity to other patients with P. jirovecii pneumonia (PJP) are all recognized risk factors for PJP.173 Radiographic findings are variable and diagnosis of PJP requires sampling of respiratory secretions, typically via bronchoscopy; cytology and PCR often will provide the diagnosis. Because the burden of organisms is lower than seen with patients with HIV infection, biopsy may be required to exclude the diagnosis.173 Serum beta d-glucan is often very elevated and this may be a clue to the diagnosis. The treatment of choice is high-dose trimethoprim sulfamethoxazole coupled with a tapering course of higher-dose corticosteroids.173 Given the potentially poor outcomes in patients with PJP, it is important to provide prophylaxis to at-risk individuals. Commonly 6 to 12 months of trimethoprim sulfamethoxazole is recommended after transplant but longer courses should be considered for patients requiring higher doses of immunosuppression, including for the treatment of rejection. Individuals with CMV are also at increased risk for PJP, so some centers reinstitute PJP prophylaxis for patients who develop CMV infection. Alternative regimens, including atovaquone and dapsone (for patients with normal G6PD levels), can be considered for patients who are allergic to trimethoprim sulfamethoxazole.173\n",

Regardless, these infections have been associated with increased mortality and at least acute impairment of kidney function and possibly long-term allograft damage.34, 175 Risk factors for UTI vary with timing after transplant and include female sex, diabetes mellitus, ureteral stents, urinary tract catheterization, urinary tract abnormalities (including reflux), immunosuppression (antithymocyte globulin, mycophenolate), reduced allograft function, en bloc double kidney transplants, deceased donors, and acute rejection.34, 176\n",

Shorter durations (i.e., 5 to 7 days) are recommended for lower tract infection; pyelonephritis should be treated with 14 days of antibacterials, and relapsed/recurrent infection with the same organism warrants prolonged treatment (>4 weeks).34 The choice of antimicrobial should consider the potential for resistance, the severity of illness, and drug interactions, especially with immunosuppressive agents; IV therapy should be initiated for more severe infections. Patients with frequent or persistent UTIs should be assessed for structural abnormalities and surgical interventions considered as appropriate. A significant area of controversy has been the management of asymptomatic bacteriuria. A recent prospective trial of treatment of asymptomatic bacteriuria commencing 2 months posttransplant failed to show a benefit from treating asymptomatic bacteriuria and current guidelines do not recommend treating these patients, especially given the potential risk for adverse events including increased antibacterial resistance and C. difficile.34, 179 The optimal management of patients with recurrent infections is unknown. Correction of structural and functional abnormalities should be performed. Postmenopausal women may benefit from vaginal estrogen and urinary acidification also has been employed. Chronic or prolonged antimicrobials should be reserved for recipients who have had more complicated courses since there is a significant potential for adverse effects from antibiotics.34\n",

Recommended vaccines are included in Table 40.3. Hepatitis B vaccine is especially important for patients who are listed for transplantation since there is an increased risk for transmission in dialysis centers and patients who are immune may be more safely transplanted with kidneys from donors with a history of hepatitis B or those at increased risk for new hepatitis B infections. Patients with CKD should receive a double dose of the recombinant vaccine and hepatitis B surface antibody levels should be measured following completion of the vaccine series.182 Historically, there have been some concerns regarding an increased risk for rejection after influenza vaccine due to the development of low level de novo anti-HLA antibodies after immunization.183 However, the linkage of vaccination to rejection has not been demonstrated and a study examining Medicare claims data in the first year after kidney transplant demonstrated that influenza vaccination was associated with reduced allograft loss and death.184 Ideally, all vaccines should be updated before transplantation; however, nonlive virus vaccines may be safely administered after transplant.181 If possible, it may be advisable to delay posttransplant immunization for 6 months to improve vaccine response; if a patient is transplanted immediately before influenza season, vaccines may be given sooner after transplant. Because transplant recipients may have suboptimal vaccine responses, it is important to vaccinate household contacts as well. CKD and transplantation have both been associated with reduced vaccine responsiveness; these individuals should receive conjugate pneumococcal vaccine followed by the pneumococcal polysaccharide capsule vaccine to maximize vaccine response.185 Vaccine schedules are updated annually; it is important to review to ensure appropriate immunizations are administered.186\n",
