Patients on ACE inhibitors have greater expression of ACE 2 receptors which have been shown to be the entry point into human cells for COVID-19 virus. This leads to the corollary that any drug or vaccine which has the potential to increase the level of ACE may help down regulate the expression of ACE 2 receptors, thereby having some beneficial effect on the host immune system against COVID-19. Earlier animal studies have shown that ACE-like activity increased with inflammation induced by BCG suppressed the induction of the inflammatory response in both lungs and spleen [4].",

Other options such as Gemcitabine, Epirubicin, Docetaxel, Valrubicin or sequential Gemcitabine/Docetaxel or Gemcitabine/Mitomycin may also be considered with an induction and possible maintenance regimen.VIII.Patients with high-risk features (i.e., high-grade T1 with additional risk factors such as concomitant carcinoma in situ, lymphovascular invasion, prostatic urethral involvement or variant histology) who are not willing to take any potential oncologic risks with alternative intravesical agents, should be offered initial radical cystectomy, if they are surgical candidates.",
