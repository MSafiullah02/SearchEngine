            "text": "Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is a novel enveloped RNA betacoronavirus that emerged in December 2019 in Wuhan, China, and is the cause of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). The most frequent clinical presentation of severe COVID-19 is pneumonia with fever, cough and dyspnoea. The Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention reported that of 44,500 confirmed infections the majority of infected patients (80%) experienced mild disease (with either no or only mild pneumonia), 14% developed severe disease (with dyspnoea, hypoxia or greater than 50% lung involvement on imaging tests) and 5% developed critical disease (characterized by respiratory failure, systemic shock or multi-organ failure)1. Approximately 20\u201330% of patients who have been hospitalized with COVID-19-associated pneumonia have required intensive care for respiratory support2,3. Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) is a common complication of severe viral pneumonia, including pneumonia caused by highly pathogenic coronaviruses such as SARS-CoV and Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV)4. In a group of 1,099 patients hospitalized with COVID-19, ARDS was reported to occur in 15.6% of patients with severe pneumonia5. A recent study from the New York area, which has emerged as the epicentre of the pandemic in the United States, reported that of 2,634 patients who were hospitalized with confirmed COVID-19 between 1 March and 4 April 2020, 14.2% of patients were treated in intensive care units (ICUs), 12.2% of patients required invasive mechanical ventilation and 21% of patients died. Mortality for those requiring mechanical ventilation was 88.1%6.",

Dozens of immunomodulatory agents are rapidly going into clinical trials as well as already being used routinely in the clinic in an off-label manner. Without a thorough understanding of which particular inflammatory pathways and cell types represent the best targets, some of these strategies could have detrimental effects in certain patients and/or at different stages of COVID-19 disease. In this Progress article, we discuss the nature of the inflammatory responses that have been detected so far in patients with COVID-19; in particular, we highlight the emerging roles of monocytes and macrophages in the pathology of COVID-19.",

Although observational studies reported older age and the presence of comorbidities as risk factors for increased disease severity in patients with COVID-19, it rapidly became clear that severe disease can also occur in younger patients with no pre-existing medical conditions. Higher levels of inflammatory markers in blood (including C-reactive protein, ferritin, and D-dimers), an increased neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio1,12,13 and increased serum levels of several inflammatory cytokines and chemokines3,14\u201317 have been associated with disease severity and death. The systemic cytokine profiles observed in patients with severe COVID-19 show similarities to those observed in cytokine release syndromes, such as macrophage activation syndrome, with increased production of cytokines such as IL-6, IL-7 and tumour necrosis factor (TNF) and also of inflammatory chemokines including CC-chemokine ligand 2 (CCL2), CCL3 and CXC-chemokine ligand 10 (CXCL10), as well as of the soluble form of the \u03b1-chain of the IL-2 receptor. This has led to the hypothesis that dysregulated activation of the mononuclear phagocyte (MNP) compartment contributes to COVID-19-associated hyperinflammation8,18. Levels of IL-6 are often increased in the sera of patients with severe disease, but most studies (including unpublished observations from our own laboratories; M.M and J.C.M.) have not seen increased serum IL-1\u03b2 levels in patients with COVID-19, including in patients with severe disease. Whether the discrepancy between IL-6 and IL-1\u03b2 levels seen in patients with COVID-19 reflects technical limitations or localized tissue production of cytokines or indicates the absence of inflammasome activation requires further clarification. Measurement of systemic IL-18 as well as local measurement of IL-1\u03b2 and IL-18 should better assess the role of inflammasome activation in COVID-19 pathophysiology",

            "text": "As is seen in infections with other highly pathogenic human coronaviruses, a common feature in many patients with COVID-19 is the presence of a global T cell lymphopenia, which is more pronounced in the CD8+ T cell compartment and is particularly prominent in patients with severe disease. Although it is possible that the reduced levels of circulating T cells in patients may reflect their massive recruitment to inflamed tissues or the use of steroid treatment to mitigate inflammation, some studies have reported significant T cell depletion from the secondary lymphoid organs of patients infected with SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 (refs10,19). The potential mechanisms responsible for T cell depletion are still poorly understood but are not likely to be related to direct infection of T cells by the virus, at least in the case of patients with COVID-19 for which no evidence supports possible T cell infection by SARS-CoV-2 (ref.10). Serum levels of TNF, IL-6 and IL-10 negatively correlated with T cell numbers20. In situ terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase dUTP nick end labeling (TUNEL) staining revealed high levels of lymphocyte apoptosis in the spleens and lymph nodes of patients who had died from COVID-19, and this was associated with increased expression of the death receptor FAS, suggesting that activation-induced cell death (AICD) may cause T cell lymphopenia10. Because T cells exert major functions in viral containment and clearance, further exploration to clarify whether T cell AICD is antigen-induced and/or increased by macrophage-derived cytokines such as IL-6 will be important.",

A study from China reported a clear benefit in 15 of 20 (75%) patients treated with IL-6 blockade, leading to FDA approval of IL-6 blockade in patients with COVID-19 (ref.21). A more recent study from Italy reported a benefit in only 7 of 21 (33%) patients22. Neither of these studies had control arms and very few data are available on the exact clinical and inflammatory status of patients who responded versus those who did not. Several groups across the world have now initiated clinical trials combining IL-6 receptor and IL-1\u03b2 blockade in patients with COVID-19. Hopefully, careful immune monitoring of responders and non-responders will reveal immune correlates of response or resistance to cytokine blockade and shed light on the pathophysiology of the COVID-19-associated inflammatory response. Measuring the prevalence and severity of disease seen in patients with COVID-19 who are on immunomodulatory biologics for other comorbidities will also help us to understand whether blockade of particular immune pathways can modulate COVID-19 disease outcomes; examples include patients on anti-TNF, anti-IL-4 receptor, anti-IL-12/23, anti-IL-17A and Janus kinase (JAK) inhibitors, as well as those receiving drugs that interfere with leukocyte migration (for example, \u03b14\u03b21 integrin, \u03b14\u03b27 integrin and S1PR inhibitors) and T cell co-stimulation.

Accordingly, single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) analysis of BALF collected from patients with severe or mild COVID-19 revealed increased proportions of MNPs, with these cells accounting for as much as 80% of total BALF cells in patients with severe COVID-19 compared with only approximately 60% and 40%, respectively, of total BALF cells in patients with mild disease or healthy controls24. MNP composition was further characterized by a depletion of tissue-resident alveolar macrophages and an abundance of inflammatory monocyte-derived macrophages in patients with severe disease24. Inflammatory programmes seen in these macrophages24 were consistent with findings from bulk RNA-seq analysis of BALF23 from patients with severe COVID-19, and notably both studies identified a strong interferon gene signature. In addition, a subset of macrophages has been described in patients with COVID-19 that is enriched in genes associated with tissue repair and promotes fibrosis generation, such as is seen in liver cirrhosis25. This suggests that the pathogenicity of infiltrating macrophages could extend beyond the promotion of acute inflammation and is also in line with the fibrotic complications observed in patients under mechanical ventilation26.",

These results could suggest that pre-existing populations of tissue-resident memory T cells with potential cross-reactivity against SARS-CoV-2 enable rapid control of the virus and protect against disease progression by limiting epithelial damage, local inflammation and accumulation of pathological macrophage populations. While this hypothesis remains to be addressed, epidemiological studies have reported that prior Bacillus Calmette\u2013Gu\u00e9rin vaccination may protect from COVID-19, leading several countries to launch clinical trials testing the protective benefit of intracutaneous administration of Bacillus Calmette\u2013Gu\u00e9rin vaccine in health-care workers (ClincialTrials.gov identifiers NCT04328441 and NCT04327206).",

This finding is surprising given that scRNA-seq analysis of human tissues failed to identify ACE2 expression on most tissue-resident macrophages, including on secondary lymphoid tissue-resident macrophages (M.M., E. Kenigsberg and A. Leader, unpublished observations). However, it is possible that ACE2 expression on macrophages can be triggered by inflammatory signals such as type I interferon30. It is also possible that additional receptors such as CD147 (ref.31) are involved in virus entry. Although SARS-CoV-2 NP was detected in secondary lymphoid tissue macrophages10, it is still unclear whether the virus productively infected these cells or whether the NP positivity reflected macrophage uptake of other infected cells. Macrophages that contained SARS-CoV-2 viral particles were found to express IL-6, and the presence of IL-6+ macrophages was associated with severe depletion of lymphocytes from the spleen and lymph nodes7. CD68+NP+ macrophages were also observed in the kidneys of patients with COVID-19, and acute kidney tubular damage was associated with marked accumulation of monocytes and macrophages8. These preliminary findings in patients with COVID-19 are in line with the pathology observed in post-mortem tissues obtained from patients infected with SARS-CoV. The disease pathology seen in these patients is also characterized by damage to the lungs consistent with ARDS, focal necrosis and lymphocytic and monocytic infiltration into the lungs, heart, kidney, liver and muscles, as well as massive necrosis of the spleen and focal necrosis of lymph nodes32.",

Potential mechanisms include high rates of viral replication, which could be responsible for enhanced host cell cytolysis and the strong production of inflammatory cytokines and chemokines by infected epithelial cells; delayed induction of antiviral interferon responses owing to virus escape mechanisms, such as production of interferon inhibitory proteins, which perpetuates virual damage, leading to excessive accumulation of monocytes, macrophages and neutrophils in the lungs4; or modulation of the ACE2-mediated epithelial protective pathway upon virus binding to its receptor34. Although viruses have evolved many mechanisms to block type I interferon production in infected cells35, it is surprising that reduced interferon activity can persist in patients with COVID-19 who show massive inflammatory responses7; this suggests that additional pathways, such as inflammasome activation, could contribute to the persistent low level of type I interferon induction, as was recently shown36. Identifying the exact mechanisms that contribute to reduced type I interferon activity will be critical for the development of targeted immunomodulatory strategies in patients with COVID-19.",

            "text": "The initiation of inflammation-induced coagulation leading to an increased coagulation state is almost always mediated by the expression of the tissue factor (TF; also called CD142 or coagulation factor III) pathway49,50. TF is expressed on mononuclear cells in response to pro-inflammatory cytokines (mainly IL-6), but TF is also expressed on vascular endothelial cells and is known to promote the transformation of prothrombin into thrombin, which in turn converts circulating fibrinogen into fibrin leading to fibrin-based blood clots51. In addition, major natural anticoagulant pathways, such as antithrombin or TF pathway inhibitor, are almost always impaired during inflammation, contributing further to the propagation of coagulation. In the absence of vascular injury, the initiation of coagulation is completely dependent on the recruitment of TF-expressing inflammatory monocytes by activated endothelial cells52 (Fig. 2). It is also possible that oxidized phospholipids (OxPLs) \u2014 which have been detected in the lungs of patients infected with SARS-CoV38 \u2014 contribute to the process53. OxPLs are produced following oxidative stress; they promote the induction of TF expression and inflammatory programmes in monocytes and activate endothelial cells to recruit and bind to monocytes53,54. In experimental ALI, OxPLs trigger macrophage activation through the TLR4\u2013TRIF\u2013TRAF6\u2013NF-\u03baB pathway38. Interfering with monocyte and/or endothelial cell activation in response to OxPLs could help prevent thrombotic complications, especially in patients with COVID-19 who have pre-existing cardiovascular and metabolic comorbidities13. However, it is important to note that the SARS-CoV-2 entry receptor ACE2 is expressed on arterial and venous endothelial cells55,56, where it plays an anti-inflammatory protective effect. Whether the increased coagulopathy observed in patients with COVID-19 is also partly due to direct vascular damage induced by SARS-CoV-2 infection or ACE2 inhibition remains to be determined.",

Trials examining the blockade of additional myeloid-derived inflammatory cytokines, such as TNF57 and granulocyte\u2013macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM\u2013CSF) (NCT04341116), have also been considered and/or initiated. Strategies aimed at broadly interfering with cytokine signalling could also significantly reduce hyperinflammation in patients with severe COVID-19, and several trials testing the use of JAK inhibitors are ongoing. Alternatively, strategies upstream of the production of individual cytokines could represent a broader and possibly more effective way to dampen the occurrence of cytokine release syndromes. Current evidence suggests that pathological macrophages mostly derive from circulating monocytes that massively infiltrate the lungs and other organs rather than from tissue-resident macrophage populations. Circulating CD14+ monocytes require the chemokine receptor CCR2 to exit the bone marrow and to accumulate in inflamed tissues58,59. CCR2 blockade could potentially help to reduce the accumulation of pathological monocytes in inflamed tissues, although it is likely that redundant mechanisms independent of CCR2 may also contribute to monocyte accumulation in tissues during severe inflammation. Trials targeting CCR5, another chemokine receptor that regulates monocyte and T cell migration, have been initiated in patients with COVID-19 who show mild-to-moderate symptoms of respiratory illness (NCT04343651). Although the antiviral activity of hydroxychloroquine remains uncertain, its immunomodulatory activity in chronic inflammatory diseases is well established60 and this could have contributed to the reported (although still controversial) clinical benefits of this drug in patients with COVID-19.",

By contrast, type III interferon (also known as IFN\u03bb) mainly targets epithelial cells as well as a restricted pool of immune cells, and could therefore promote a potent antiviral effect without enhancing pathological tissue inflammation62. As discussed above, inflammatory macrophages from the lungs of patients with severe COVID-19 exhibit a strong interferon signature and it is possible that, while interferon may be protective during the early stages of the disease, persistent IFN\u03b3 production could ultimately drive macrophage hyperactivation as is seen in macrophage activation syndrome.

In the second stage, a delayed interferon response may lead to progressive tissue damage. This may ultimately lead to the third stage, a deleterious hyperinflammation characterized by the excessive macrophage activation and coagulation that is seen in patients with severe disease, possibly followed by dysregulation of tissue repair mechanisms and fibrosis63. The exact drivers of pathological inflammation in COVID-19 remain to be identified, but it is crucial that we establish the pathways involved in the different stages of the inflammatory response to SARS-CoV-2 and determine the contribution of these pathways to ultimate disease outcome.

It is critical to start measuring longitudinally and with as much granularity as possible the systemic and potentially local inflammatory responses induced by SARS-CoV-2 and how these pathways are modulated by the different therapies currently used as standard of care or in clinical trials.

Delayed production of type I interferon leading to enhanced cytopathic effects and increased sensing of microbial threats promotes the enhanced release of monocyte chemoattractants by alveolar epithelial cells (and likely also by macrophages and stromal cells), leading to sustained recruitment of blood monocytes into the lungs. Monocytes differentiate into pro-inflammatory macrophages though activation of Janus kinase (JAK)\u2013signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT) pathways. Activated natural killer (NK) cells and T cells further promote the recruitment and activation of monocyte-derived macrophages through the production of granulocyte\u2013macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF), tumour necrosis factor (TNF) and interferon-\u03b3 (IFN\u03b3). Oxidized phospholipids (OxPLs) accumulate in infected lungs and activate monocyte-derived macrophages through the Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4)\u2013TRAF6\u2013NF-\u03baB pathway. Virus sensing can trigger TLR7 activation through viral single-stranded RNA recognition. It is possible that type I interferons induce the expression of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) entry receptors, enabling the virus to gain access to the cytoplasm of macrophages and to activate the NLRP3 inflammasome, leading to the secretion of mature IL-1\u03b2 and/or IL-18. IL-1\u03b2 can amplify activation of monocyte-derived macrophages in an autocrine or paracrine way, but it can also reduce type I interferon production in infected lungs. The engagement of Fc\u03b3 receptors (Fc\u03b3Rs) by anti-spike protein IgG immune complexes can contribute to increased inflammatory activation of monocyte-derived macrophages. Activated monocyte-derived macrophages contribute to the COVID-19 cytokine storm by releasing massive amounts of pro-inflammatory cytokines.
