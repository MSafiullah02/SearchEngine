Here we aim to briefly describe the modifications and safety measures taken in our Radiology Department in order to face this sanitary emergency, ranging from optimal vetting, and setup of dedicated spaces, to optimization of the workflow and staff management. In our Institution, during the last 14 days, the number of hospitalized Covid-19 patients increased from 133 (18 of which in the intensive care units-ICUs) to 269 (41 of which in the ICUs), and every day a mean of 30 patients are diagnosed as positive for COVID-19 in our Emergency Department (ED).",

In order to prevent the spreading of the disease within the hospital, separate ED, wards, and intensive care units (ICUs) were created for COVID-19 positive (or suspected positive) and non-COVID-19 patients, with dedicated medical and paramedical staff. The CT machine located within the original ED was dedicated exclusively to COVID-19 patients. Portable X-rays and ultrasound scanners were provided in each COVID-19 ICU and ward and were dedicated exclusively to these patients. The non-COVID-19 patients admitted in the ED, including acute stroke patients, had a separate pathway, and were studied with \"clean\" X-ray and CT scanners within the Radiology Department, previously dedicated to inpatients and outpatients. This helped to reduce the risk of in-hospital transmission and allowed to avoid time-and resource-consuming room decontamination procedures.",

Systematic checks of temperatures were taken using hospital-issued digital thermometers. History of fever, cough, and contact with COVID-19 positive subjects was also evaluated. 4. Surgical masks were provided for all patients and staff at the entrance of the hospital and had to be worn for all the time. 5. Despite this double-triage procedure, a mean of 2.2 outpatients presenting lung CT findings typical for COVID-19 pneumonia was found every day in the non-COVID pathway during the last 2 weeks. These were nonfebrile patients without previous history of contact with infected subjects, who underwent CT either for cough (typically lasting more than 2 weeks) or for cancer staging. For this reason, an accelerated protocol for room decontamination was set up, allowing the employment of the imaging room after just 30 min from positive case presence. 6. The number of outpatient radiological exams was drastically reduced to free resources for the COVID-19 patients and to allow enough distance among patients in the waiting rooms. 7. The participation to medical congresses and all inhospital meetings were banned. Participation to multidisciplinary boards was allowed for a single professional only for each discipline; a web-based videoconference service was established to allow participation of the whole board.",

All the healthcare professionals in the Radiology Department received specific training regarding safety measures through both an Institutional e-learning platform and dedicated training sessions in small groups. Counseling and psychological services were also established by the Hospital to assist staff exposed to risk of infection. 9. All the personal protective equipment (PPE) was available when facing a suspicious or confirmed COVID-19 patient. In case of interventional radiological or neuroradiological procedures, the following PPEs are always available: double sterile gloves, Ffp2/3 masks, nonsterile waterproof gown, and sterile surgical gown, adhering mask for eye protection. 10. For radiological intervention, two pathways were organized. First, an operating room equipped with C-arm, with a negative pressure environment, was set up in an isolated COVID-19 area to perform surgical, interventional radiology and hemodynamics procedures in COVID-19 patients. Second, non-COVID patients underwent interventional radiological procedures, in the \"clean\" angiographic suite in the Radiology Department. For urgent endovascular thrombectomy in either COVID-19 patients or suspected COVID-19 patients presenting acute stroke, the dedicated biplane neuro-angiographic suite was employed and decontaminated immediately after each procedure. 11. No observers or students were allowed to enter the Department. In addition to the checkpoints at the entrances of the hospital and of the Radiology Department, where dedicated personnel avoided the entrance of non-authorized people, signs were hung on the doors to remember the mandatory use of surgical masks and to prevent unauthorized staff from gaining access to the area. Residents' working schedule was temporarily halved.",

Radiology must be ready to play an active role in the COVID-19 pandemic outbreak. This outbreak is both a sanitary emergency and an economic challenge for the whole healthcare system and also for Radiology Departments, facing a dramatic increase in the expenses and decrease in the revenue. However, it is our duty and mission to harmonize the services of the Radiology Departments with the compelling needs of the hospitals, and to contribute in the successful management of COVID-19 patients. We really hope that the dramatic situation that this part of Italy is now experiencing might not be faced in other countries.",
