It now functions as an approved site of the BMC Department of Pathology & Laboratory Medicine, as an extension of their Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments (CLIA) and College of American Pathologists (CAP) accredited space. Subsequently, we implemented a quantitative, real-time reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR)-based assay to detect viral SARS-CoV-2 RNA from nasopharyngeal swabs, based on guidelines from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and the FDA for use with in-house testing of BMC patient samples ( Figure 1 ) (CDC, 2020; Wang et al., 2020a). RNA extraction from patient swabs was performed via the QIAGEN\u00ae RNeasy Minikit (Cat #74106), to its relative abundance in the context of a limited supply of similar reagents. cDNA was prepared from patient sample RNA, followed by qRT-PCR to interrogate expression of the SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid protein RNA (N1, N2) as well as human Ribonuclease P (RNase P, internal housekeeping control) (IDT Cat #10006606).

All team members completed expedited BMC onboarding, including training protected health information (PHI) training. This automated pipeline subsequently interfaces with our institution's laboratory information system (SunQuest), allowing for direct upload into BMC's electronic medical record (Epic), further reducing overall turnaround time from sample intake to result reporting.

Notably, our ability to extend CLIA certification from a BMC Pathology clinical facility to include basic research laboratory space was unprecedented and instrumental in our ability to test patient samples in an expedient manner, particularly at a point during the pandemic when commercial laboratory TAT for samples sent from our hospital ranged from 5-10 days. Although our hospital does possess a high throughput Roche Cobas\u00ae system for molecular testing, a nationwide shortage in the supply and distribution of SARS-CoV-2-specific kits led us to adapt and implement an in-house, qRT-PCR-based, FDA EUA diagnostic using readily sourced reagents. Our test offers a more rapid TAT in comparison to currently available commercial or state laboratory facilities, and enables clinicians and patients to make more informed decisions with significant personal and public health ramifications.",

Notably, we have the ability to run a one-step PCR reaction (omitting a separate RT cDNA step), to multiplex samples using multiple fluorophores, and to also validate multiple swab methodologies to overcome potential bottlenecks in the supply chain. Our ability to perform several variations of our core assay ensures that if any single element of our supply chain becomes unstable, we can seamlessly pivot to an alternate approved strategy under our EUA. Furthermore, in contrast to commercial automated sample-to-answer platforms, the inherent granularity of our system is also amenable to experimental validation studies and COVID-19 related scientific inquiry.",

            "text": "Our 44.1% rate of positivity is higher than the overall state average of 18.1%, a potential indicator that we are sampling from a higher risk population. Given that our hospital takes care of a large portion of Boston's homeless and housing unstable patients, rapid testing is vital in order to mitigate community spread in an already vulnerable population living in low resource settings in which social distancing is not possible. Based on publicly available data, 46% (roughly 4 in 10 patients) of BMC's inpatient census on April 6-7 th , 2020 (approaching the peak of the pandemic in Massachusetts) was comprised of COVID-19 patients (Wen, 2020) . This point is further highlighted by our urban location as zip codes in socioeconomically disadvantaged neighborhoods in Boston have higher than average levels of COVID-19 when compared to city-wide data (BPHC, 2020). Taken together, this data reflects emerging preliminary numbers of COVID-19 outcomes from several states and cities across the country that suggest that ethnic minorities and the underserved face higher risks of significant novel coronavirusrelated disease. Finally, we have been able to implement comprehensive testing before larger, more well-resourced institutions in our community, suggesting that the template and protocol that we have generated and validated could be useful for other smaller community hospitals lacking capital intensive automated clinical laboratory machinery to run molecular biology assays.",

The plate was then sealed, centrifuged briefly, and loaded into the QuantStudio 6 Flex Real Time PCR System. The PCR reaction was carried out with the following incubation times: Preamplification (UNG Inactivation), 1x, 120 seconds 25\u00baC; Preamplification (Polymerase Activation), 1x 120 seconds 95\u00baC; Amplification, 45x 3 seconds 95\u00baC and 30 seconds 55\u00baC. Full instrument settings and parameters can be found in the Additional Resources Section. Data was analyzed using an automated script described above. Individual plates were checked for adequate amplification of the control standard curve, and samples were called positive or negative based on the following guidelines from the CDC (Note: C T values above 40 were considered negative): N1+, N2+, RP\u00b1 indicates positive for SARS-CoV-2, either N1 or N2+, RP\u00b1 indicates an inconclusive result, N1-, N2-, RP+ indicates negative for SARS-CoV-2, and N1-, N2-, RP-indicates an invalid result.",
