Millions of people got sick with COVID-19. In this letter to the editor, I suggest that the COVID-19 survivors especially individuals who had severe COVID-19 are at increased suicide risk. Suicidality among individuals who had COVID-19 may be related to both psychological and neurobiological factors.",

Realising that they have COVID-19 may be very stressful, especially for low-resilient individuals. Symptoms of the disease, especially severe symptoms, as well as social isolation and fear of infecting other people may lead to a serious psychological trauma. Individuals who needed an admission to an intensive care unit (ICU) are at especially high risk of developing post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), depression, anxiety, sleep abnormalities, and cognitive impairments (McGiffin et al., 2016). Ventilation adjustments, gaps in anaesthesia and/or analgesia, long sedation, restraint use, and other ICU-related factors contribute to a profound psychological effect of ICU hospitalisations. A recent study in China indicated that 96.2% of recovering COVID-19 patients had significant post-traumatic stress symptoms (Bo et al., 2020).",

Sleep abnormalities are a stand-alone risk factor for suicidal behaviour. Cognitive impairments are also associated with suicidality (Sher, 2019). Many recovering COVID-19 patients have physical symptoms for a long time and experience psychosocial difficulties such as loss of employment and financial issues. Both physical symptoms and psychosocial stressors contribute to suicidal behaviour (Sher, 2019).",

Recovered COVID-19 patients need to be screened for depression and suicidality. Many coronavirus disease survivors will need long-term psychological interventions. There should be specific strategies to enhance the psychological condition of COVID-19 survivors and reduce suicidality in this population. We need to examine what kind of early interventions in coronavirus disease survivors may decrease psychiatric morbidity and suicidality in the future.",
