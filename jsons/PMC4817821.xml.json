            "text": "Dendritic cells (DCs), body's most professional antigen-presenting cells, possess the unique ability of capturing and processing pathogenic antigens in the peripheral blood and tissues. The antigen-loaded DCs migrate through afferent lymphatics to the nearby draining lymph nodes where they present the processed antigen fragments in complexation with both classical major histocompatibility complexes (MHC class I and II) and nonclassical (CD1 family) antigen-presenting molecules to the resting T lymphocytes.1,2,3 Because of such distinguishing antigen-presenting ability of the DCs, DCs pulsed/transduced with tumor-associated or viral antigens are finding increasing applications as vaccines for cancer and infectious diseases. DCs are often ex vivo transfected with tumor/viral antigens-encoded DNA vaccines.4,5,6,7,8,9 Such ex vivo DC transfection-based genetic immunization protocols, although highly efficient in combating cancer, are labor-intensive, time-consuming, and expensive. Autologous DC precursors are painstakingly isolated, the isolated autologous DC precursors are then ex vivo transfected with DNA vaccines, and the ex vivo transfected DCs finally need to be reimplanted in recipient's body for mounting immune response. To this end, both viral and nonviral vectors are now being used for direct in vivo targeting of DNA vaccines to DCs.10,11,12,13,14,15,16 However, achieving long-lasting immunity through use of simple and cost-effective in vivo DC-targeting system remains a formidable challenge.",

We envisaged that the DC transfection efficiency of this new class of mannose receptor selective lipids containing mannose-mimicking shikimoyl- and quinoyl- head-groups need to be further enhanced for making their liposomes effective in targeting DNA vaccines to DCs under in vivo settings. With such rationale in mind, in the present study, we chemically transformed the lysine side chain amino group into the transfection enhancing guanidine group. Herein, we show that liposomes of the cationic amphiphile containing a mannose-mimicking shikimoyl head-group and two n-hexadecyl hydrophobic tails can target DNA vaccines to DCs under in vivo settings when the side chain amino group of the lysine spacer is guanidinylated (lipid 1, Figure 1). We show that direct in vivo immunization (s.c.) of mice with electrostatic complex of the liposome of lipid 1 and melanoma antigen-encoded DNA vaccine (p-CMV-MART1) induces long-lasting antimelanoma immune response (100 days post melanoma tumor challenge) with remarkable memory response (more than 6 months after the second tumor challenge). With the availability of the presently described cationic lipid 1, overcoming the formidable challenge of inducing long-lasting immune response through direct in vivo targeting of tumor antigen-encoded DNA vaccines to DCs will now become feasible. The presently described direct in vivo DC-targeting liposomal DNA vaccine carriers are thus expected to find future applications in effective vaccine developments for various infectious diseases and cancers.",

First, we evaluated DC transfection properties of the liposomes of lipids 1\u20133 by flow cytometry using a GFP plasmid (as a model DNA vaccine). First we transfected mbmDCs with GFP plasmid complexed with liposomes of lipids 1\u20133 and equimolar 1,2-dioleyol-sn-glycero-3-phosphoethanolamine (DOPE; as co-lipid) at cationic lipid:DNA charge ratio of 4:1 (initial transfection experiments across a range of lipid:DNA charge ratios revealed 4:1 to be the most optimal lipid:DNA charge ratio, data not shown). Transfected cells were visualized by fluorescence microscopy (Figure 2a) and the relative transfection efficiencies of lipids 1\u20133 were measured by flow cytometry (Figure 2c). In such flow cytometric measurements of transfection efficiency, the autofluorescence intensities of the untreated control cells are subtracted from the fluorescence intensities of the treated cells. The lipoplexes of lipid 1 with mannose-mimicking shikimoyl head-group was found to be the most efficient with ~20% DC transfection efficiency, followed by liposomes of lipids 2 and 3 with ~12% and ~5% DC transfection efficiencies, respectively (Figure 2c). Commercially available LipofectAmine 2000 was found to be very poor in transfecting mbmDCs (Figure 2a,c). Mannose receptor selective DC transfection properties of lipids 1\u20133 were significantly affected when mbmDCs were preincubated with 1 mg/ml mannan, a natural ligand for mannose receptor (Figure 2b,d), which supports the notion that the DC transfection by lipids 1\u20133 are mediated via mannose receptor. Furthermore, toward addressing concentration-dependent inhibition by mannan, we evaluated the DC transfection efficiencies of lipids 1\u20133 using DCs preincubated with increasing mannan concentrations across the 0.25\u20131.0 mg/ml. The DC transfection efficiencies were adversely affected with increasing concentrations of mannan (Supplementary Figure S13a). Importantly, the DC transfection properties of lipids 1\u20133 were not significantly affected when DCs were preincubated with laminarin, a commercially available polysaccharide of glucose (Supplementary Figure S13b). Thus, the findings summarized in Figure 2 and the Supplementary Figure S13a,b convincingly demonstrated mannose receptor-mediated DC transfection efficacies of cationic amphiphiles with mannose-mimicking shikimoyl and quinoyl- head-groups.",

The lipoplexes (liposome:DNA complexes) of lipids 1\u20133 were injected s.c. into C57BL/6J mice. Twenty-four hours after injection, the percentages of GFP-positive cells in the CD11c+ cells were isolated from the lymph nodes by using anti-CD11c antibody-labeled magnetic beads as described previously.18 Mice injected with only vehicles (5% glucose solution) were used as control. The findings in the flow cytometric study revealed a significantly higher number of GFP-positive cells (~15%) in the draining lymph nodes (CD11c+ cells) of mice injected with lipoplexes of lipid 1 when compared to the corresponding numbers observed in mice injected with lipoplexes of lipids 2 (~6%) and 3 (~3%) (Figure 3a,b).

The findings summarized in Supplementary Figure S14 clearly showed liposomes of lipid 1 to be the most efficient among lipids 1\u20133 for targeting DNA vaccines to DCs under in vivo conditions.",

C57BL/6J mice were s.c. immunized with p-CMV-\u03b2-gal complexed with liposomes of lipid 1\u20133 and equimolar DOPE. Two weeks post third immunization, splenocytes and sera were collected and IFN-\u03b3 (signature cytokine for cellular immune response) and anti-\u03b2-Gal antibodies (humoral immune response) were measured by using anti-IFN-\u03b3-coated and \u03b2-Galactosidase-coated ELISA plates, respectively. Mice immunized with only vehicles (5% glucose) were used as control. Importantly, the amount of IFN-\u03b3 measured from splenocytes and the amount of anti-\u03b2-Gal antibodies measured in sera for the mice group immunized with lipoplexes of lipid 1 were found to be significantly higher than those for the control mice group as well as for the mice groups immunized with lipoplexes of lipids 2 and 3 (Supplementary Figure S15a,b). These initial findings prompted us to conduct in vivo DC-targeted genetic immunization experiment using lipoplexes of lipid 1 (containing shikimoyl- head-group) and p-CMV-MART1 DNA vaccine encoding human MelanA/MART1 which shares 68.6% amino acid sequence identity with its murine counterpart.19 First mice (n = 5) were immunized with the lipoplexes of lipid 1 and p-CMV-MART1 and were subsequently challenged with lethal dose (~1 \u2212 105 cells/mice) of aggressive melanoma tumor. Since the tumor sizes for the control mice group immunized with only vehicle (5% aqueous glucose) became too large on day 30 post tumor challenge and had to be sacrificed, tumor growth was monitored for 30 days. Importantly, all the five mice s.c. immunized with lipoplexes of lipid 1 and p-CMV-MART1 were completely tumor free while tumor sizes in all the five mice s.c. immunized with irrelevant control lipoplexes of lipid 1 and p-CMV-\u03b2-gal kept on increasing with time and died within 29 days post tumor challenge (Figure 5a). In sharp contrast, long-lasting (100 days post tumor challenge) antimelanoma protective immunity was observed in mice immunized with lipoplexes of lipid 1 and p-CMV-MART1. All the five immunized mice lived completely tumor-free life for 100 days post tumor challenge (Figure 5b). Collectively, the findings summarized in Figure 5a,b demonstrate that the long-lasting antitumor immune response inducing potential of the in vivo DC-targeting lipoplexes of lipid 1 and p-CMV-MART1. Furthermore, with a view to evaluate memory response, all the five immunized mice which survived 100 days after the first B16F10 challenge were challenged a second time with ~1 \u00d7 105 B16F10 cells. Four out of five mice (80%) second time challenged with tumor lived once again completely tumor-free lives for 6 months after the second tumor challenge (Figure 5c,d). We also evaluated the in vivo DC-targeted immunization efficacy of lipoplexes of lipid 2 and p-CMV-MART1 and lipoplexes of lipid 3 and p-CMV-MART1. Importantly, 60% of mice immunized with the lipoplexes of lipid 2 and p-CMV-MART1 lived tumor-free life, whereas only 20% of mice immunized with the lipoplexes of lipid 3 and p-CMV-MART1 lived tumor-free life during the observed time period of 70 days post tumor challenge (Supplementary Figure S16a,b). Stated differently, the findings summarized in Figure 5c,d convincingly demonstrated the efficiency of the presently described in vivo DC-targeting liposomal DNA vaccine carrier of lipid 1 in inducing dramatic memory response in cancer immunotherapy.",

Lysis of the target melanoma cells by the primed splenocytes was studied across the Effector:Target cell ratio of 10:1\u2013100:1. Importantly, while the effector splenocytes isolated from mice immunized with lipoplexes of lipid 1 and p-CMV-MART1 lysed ~60% target melanoma cells, significantly reduced target cell lysis (~20%) could be effected by splenocytes isolated from mice immunized with lipoplexes of lipid 1 and a control irrelevant p-CMV-\u03b2-gal plasmid (Figure 7a). This showed that the mice group immunized with in vivo DC-targeting lipoplexes of lipid 1 and p-CMV-MART1 was more efficient in inducing CTL response against target cell (B16F10). Consistent with such target cell selective lytic activity of the effector splenocytes, results in the cytokine secretion assays also revealed remarkably higher amounts of IFN-\u03b3 (compared to secreted IL-4) secreted by the activated T cells (Figure 7b,c). IFN-\u03b3 being a distinguishing marker of cellular immune response, the results shown in Figure 7b,c are consistent with the supposition that cell-mediated immunity plays a crucial role behind the presently observed remarkable antitumor immune response.",

They are easy to design and construct and their large-scale production is cost-effective. In contrast to attenuated viral vaccines whose storage and global delivery are complicated by the need of keeping the vaccines cold, plasmid DNAs are fairly stable at room temperature.25 Since the antigens encoded in the DNA vaccines are expressed in situ, their posttranslational modifications happen in similar way as in the case of infection with cognate pathogens. Another distinguishing feature of DNA vaccines is that the immune response induced by such genetic immunization are often primarily cellular in nature which is believed to play crucial roles for effective vaccination against pathogens (e.g., viruses) and cancers.26,27 Despite all these distinguishing advantages, the low in vivo cell transfection efficiencies of naked plasmid DNA, difficulty in preferentially targeting of DNA vaccines to professional antigen-presenting cells (DCs), and the modest intrinsic adjuvant activity of DNA vaccines are impeding their clinical success. To this end, immunization with autologous DCs ex vivo transfected with antigen-encoded DNA vaccines have shown promise in the past.1,4,5,6,7,8,9,28,29 Such ex vivo DC transfection-based immunization protocols are labor-intensive, time-consuming, expensive, and not patient-friendly.",

            "text": "It is important to emphasize that our previously reported liposomes of cationic lipids containing the mannose-mimicking shikimoyl- and quinoyl- head-groups with pure lysine spacer (i.e., without the lysine side chain amine group being guanidinylated as is the case for the presently described lipids 1\u20133, Figure 1) were capable of mounting long-lasting immune response only under ex vivo DC transfection-based DNA vaccination.9 DCs are hard-to-transfect. Although the DC transfection efficacies of these previously reported lipids containing pure lysine spacer between the mannose-mimicking head-group and hydrophobic tails9 were ~12%, the lipids failed in mounting long-lasting immune response against melanoma challenge when used on the direct in vivo immunization mode (Supplementary Figure S17). Since prior studies demonstrated efficient gene transfer properties of guanidinylated cationic amphiphiles,36,37 we decided to convert the amine group in the lysine side chain of our previously reported lipids9 with guanidine group using conventional guanidinylation reagent HgCl2/N,N-di-Boc-thiourea. A number of distinguishing chemical characteristics contribute to the enhanced gene transfer efficiencies of guanidinylated cationic amphiphiles. The guanidinium groups, because of their high pKa values (~12\u201313), remain protonated across a much wider range of pH compared to other basic groups and thereby exhibit strong electrostatic binding properties with the phosphates group of the macromolecular DNA molecules under the physiological pH. In addition, they form characteristic parallel zwitterionic N-H+\u2026O\u2212 hydrogen bonds with the phosphate ions of the DNA molecules and form hydrogen bonds with nucleic acid bases.37\nIn vitro and in vivo DC transfection studies clearly demonstrated that lipid 1 was most efficient compared to lipids 2 and 3. Hydrodynamic diameters of the liposomes of lipids 1\u20133 were found to be within the range 134\u2013154 nm (Supplementary Figure S10) and the corresponding ranges for the lipoplexes of lipids 1\u20133 were within 278\u2013292 nm (Supplementary Figure S11). Such similar hydrodynamic diameters of the lipoplexes of lipids 1\u20133 are consistent with the supposition that the sizes of lipoplexes are unlikely to play major role in modulating the DC transfection efficiencies of lipids 1\u20133. We do not understand why increase in ex vivo DC transfection efficiency from ~12% (as was the case for our previous reported lipid9) to just ~20% (through conversion of the lysine amino side chain to guanidine in the present study) imparts in vivo DC-targeting ability to the lipid. Perhaps the minimum (threshold) ex vivo DC transfection efficiency for imparting in vivo DC-targeting ability to cationic lipid lies near 20%. However, deciphering such threshold ex vivo DC transfection of cationic lipids, if any, would be impossible to find out without in-depth future structure\u2013activity studies using more number of structural analogs such as use of multiple shikimoyl- and quinoyl- head-groups, use of multiple guanidine groups in the head-group regions, etc.",

Although in the present study we have demonstrated the in vivo DC-targeting ability of the mannose receptor-specific lipoplex of lipid 1, the present findings do not preclude the possibility of macrophage and possibly other myeloid cells (many of which express mannose receptors on their cell surface) being transfected by the lipoplexes of lipid 1. Since DCs are the most potent antigen-presenting cells in mounting adaptive immune response, herein our primary focus is on the in vivo DC-transfecting ability of the presently described lipids. We have no clue yet as to the origin of more DC-targeting efficacy of lipoplex of lipid 1 compared to the lipoplexes of lipids 2 and 3. The issue remains elusive at this stage of investigation. Clearly further mechanistic studies such as binding studies using purified mannose receptor need to be undertaken in future toward gaining insights into the relative in vivo DC-targeting efficacies of the lipoplexes of lipids 1\u20133.",

            "text": "Despite significant recent progresses in the emerging field of in vivo DC-targeted genetic immunization, the challenge of designing a simple, safe, and effective system for in vivo targeting of DNA vaccines to DCs remains formidable. To this end, using a syngeneic mouse melanoma model, we have shown that immunization with tumor antigen (MART1)-encoded DNA vaccines in complexation with the presently described next-generation liposomal DNA vaccine carrier is capable of mounting long-lasting immune response against lethal dose of melanoma tumor challenge (all five immunized mice lived completely tumor-free lives during 100 days post first tumor challenge). p-CMV-MART1 DNA vaccine encodes 18 kDa Human MelanA/MART1 antigen which shares 68.6% amino acid sequence identity with its murine counterpart.19 MelanA/MART1 is a human melanocyte lineage-specific antigen expressed by majority of human malignant melanoma. Effective antigen-specific immunity ensues when DCs present the processed antigen fragments of the MART1 to both CD4+ and CD8+ T cells. DCs present processed antigen fragments to CD4+ cells in complexation with MHC II molecules which causes differentiation of CD4+ T cells into T-helper 1 (Th1) and T-helper 2 (Th2) cells (inducers of cellular and humoral immune responses, respectively). When DCs present the processed MART1 protein fragments to CD8+ T cells in complexation with MHC I molecules, the activated CD8+ T cells differentiate into CTLs (the effector T cells) which kill the affected cells with help from CD4+ T cells.38 Importantly, in the present study, 80% of mice (which lived completely tumor-free lives for 100 days after the first tumor challenge) lived again completely tumor-free lives for 200 days post second tumor challenge. Precise mechanism as to how such long-lasting immune responses against melanoma antigen is induced by the presently described in vivo DC-targeting lipoplex of lipid 1 remains an open question at this stage of investigation. CD4 Th1 cells secret IFN-\u03b3 which induces further proliferation of CTLs. Presumably, effective in vivo DC-targeting of the p-CMV-MART1 DNA vaccine in complexation with the liposomes of lipid 1 ensures secretion of large quantity of IFN-\u03b3 (as was observed in the present case) by CD4 Th1 cells which in turn leads to proliferation of CTLs including strong induction of memory T cells (Supplementary Figure S18a,b). Another important issue deserves mention at this point. Prior studies showed that lipoplexes, in general, are effective in blocking tumor growth in mice due to their capabilities in inducing acute immune responses.39 Findings in the CTL assay summarized in Figure 7a clearly show that target cell (B16F10) lysis happens only to the extent of ~20% by splenocytes (at E:T ratio of 100:1) of mice immunized with control lipoplex of lipid 1 and p-CMV-\u03b2-Gal plasmid (control DNA vaccine with no encoded tumor antigen). Contrastingly, the degree of target cell lysis by splenocytes of mice immunized with lipoplexes of lipid 1 and p-CMV-MART1 DNA vaccine was found to be ~60% as shown in Figure 7a. Consistent with these findings in the CTL assay, both the amounts of secreted IFN-\u03b3 (markers of cellular immune response) and IL-4 (markers of humoral immune response) for mice immunized with lipid 1:p-CMV MART1 lipoplexes were found to be about seven times higher than the amounts of secreted IFN-\u03b3 and IL-4 for mice immunized with control lipoplex of lipid 1 and p-CMV-\u03b2-Gal plasmid (Figure 7b,c based on assay performed 4 weeks after immunization). Thus, nonspecific immune response inducing properties of lipoplexes are unlikely to play major role in the presently described long-lasting immune response. Furthermore, the findings in the newly conducted experiments using CD8+ depleted mice (Figure 8) clearly support the notion that CD8+ T cells play an important in mounting long-lasting immune response described herein. Stated differently, the results summarized in Supplementary Figure S13a,b and Figure 7a\u2013c convincingly demonstrated that heightened cellular immune responses play crucial roles behind the remarkably sustained protective immunity against melanoma tumor described herein.",

With the availability of the presently described simple liposomal in vivo DC-targeting system, avoiding potentially unsafe viral vectors for targeting DCs under in vivo settings in genetic immunization will now be feasible. The dramatically long-lasting primary immune responses against melanoma in all immunized mice and the remarkable memory responses delineated herein support the future systemic promises of the presently described direct in vivo DC-targeting liposomal DNA vaccine carrier in combating cancer and potentially many other challenging infectious diseases with known pathogenic antigens through direct DNA vaccination in animal and human body.",
