If true, the COVID-19 pandemic might increase cardiovascular death in multiple ways, weakening patients with pre-existing cardiovascular conditions, generating inflammatory myocarditis and reducing our ability to quickly evaluate patients with acute cardiovascular disease who are not infected with COVID-19 (or concomitantly those who are infected with COVID-19) [1].",

About one-third of the university centres answered, and extensively documented the numbers of patients admitted to ICCUs in March 2020, to enable us to follow the effect of this present unprecedented situation. The mean number of admissions by centre was computed each day. These means were compared before and under containment, using a Wilcoxon-Mann-Whitney test.",

This is only a rapid, short survey, but we assume that a global trend could be confirmed on a large scale; we plan to confirm these results by analysing national databases that contain far more information.

If true, many patients might die, in numbers that are much more difficult to quantify. The consequences could be serious, potentially resulting in an increase in the number of ambulatory myocardial infarctions, leading to an increase in the number of cardiac arrests, unexplained deaths and heart failure. For example, a recent paper found an significant increase in the time component of patients with STEMI in Hong Kong [4].
