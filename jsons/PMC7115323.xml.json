All measurements were performed when the rooms were unoccupied. Background concentrations of CO2 were monitored with a Sable Systems CA-10 CO2 analyzer (Las Vegas, NV) for at least 20 minutes. High-purity (99.9%) CO2 was then released and vigorously mixed with room air by 2 fans until concentrations stabilized. The approximate homogeneity of concentration was confirmed by measurements at a minimum of 3 points within each room before the cessation of CO2 release. A single sampling point was then sited at a central location. The decay of CO2 was recorded every second until background concentrations were reached. Three repeat measurements were conducted in each room, and for each door position in the outpatient consulting rooms. A total of 18 air-exchange measurements were obtained.",

We also modeled a third, more complex, situation: the risk of infection for a susceptible individual occupying an outpatient consulting room for up to 120 minutes after previous occupation by an infectious individual for each of 15, 60, and 120 minutes, which spans the range of consultation times for brief to complex multidisciplinary consultations. To mimic typical practice, a 5-minute period during which the door was open was incorporated into each scenario (ie, between the departure of the infectious person and arrival of the susceptible individual). To best assess the capability of the outpatient consulting room's ventilation system at preventing airborne transmission, we investigated the most infectious pathogen (influenza) in that room.",

The ventilation rate in the ED isolation room afforded substantial protection from the 3 pathogens modeled and was approximately twice that recommended by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention for airborne infection isolation rooms.25 Although the real-world bases of prescribed ventilation guidelines are limited, in these 2 scenarios, modeling demonstrated that measured air exchange limited the infection risk to relatively low levels.

Airborne transmission is widely acknowledged as the mechanism of spread of tuberculosis, although its role in influenza and rhinovirus transmission is less well established.16 Nonetheless, there is evidence to support increased airborne transmission of the latter 2 diseases under low outdoor air exchange conditions.7, 15 Our results suggest that the risk of influenza infection for susceptible individuals entering outpatient consulting room A, although relatively low, are not negligible despite the fact that the total and outdoor air change rates meet guidelines recommended for patient examination rooms and general wards.10 This further emphasizes the need to develop a rigorous scientific basis for prescribing minimum ventilation rates within a diverse range of hospital environments.9 It is also noteworthy that natural ventilation can reduce airborne infection risk and energy consumption compared with mechanical ventilation,26, 27 although this requires a climate amenable to this practice and appropriate planning of the hospital environment.",

Although not modeled, the risks to a susceptible individual entering room B thus would be greater than those shown in Figure 2B. Such room-specific idiosyncrasies underscore the potential pitfalls of generalizing results, even between 2 proximate and similar rooms. Notwithstanding this, the infection risk in both rooms could be further reduced by allowing their doors to remain open for longer periods after occupation by a potentially infectious individual. However, reducing the risk in one room occupied by a handful of individuals at the expense of increased risk in more densely occupied adjacent areas (eg, waiting room) would represent a false economy. The infectiousness of the pathogen, the air volume into which it would be mixed, and the number of susceptible persons located nearby would need to be carefully considered and balanced against existing risks before opening doors could be recommended as a general control strategy. Further research addressing this issue is needed.",
