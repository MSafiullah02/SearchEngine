Although nature has been responsible for these problems, of equally great concern is the possibility that infectious agents will be introduced into our environment by a deliberate act of bioterrorism or biowarfare.",

However, with ready access to modern molecular biology and microbiological procedures, it is relatively easy for a person to obtain, grow, and disperse a biowarfare agent for the express purpose of causing morbidity and mortality in a target population. While chemicals and toxins are bona fide threats, infectious pathogens represent the biggest problem for several reasons. First, there is a wide diversity of pathogenic agents (bacteria, viruses, fungi, etc.) that are capable of causing a variety of diseases. Second, unlike chemicals or toxins, microorganisms have the ability to replicate and survive in the environment. And third, in some cases microorganisms have the ability to spread from individual to individual. Once a weapon like this is deployed, it cannot be recalled or controlled, nor can it distinguish between friend and foe.",

Those pathogens in Category B are second in priority for their moderate ease of dissemination and their moderate morbidity and low mortality rates. In addition, CDC's diagnostic capacity and disease surveillance capability for these agents is currently inadequate and would require vast improvements.

Their widespread implementation has greatly reduced the disease burden from once common diseases such as pertussis and measles, and in the case of smallpox, completely eliminated the disease from the human population. Historically, there have been four generations of vaccines. For example, with regard to viral vaccines, the first generation is represented by live viruses, such as vaccinia virus or rabies virus, that were grown in animals, harvested, and then chemically inactivated (in the case of rabies virus). The second generation of vaccines was grown on embryonated chicken eggs, as typified by the traditional influenza vaccine. The advent of cell culture technology heralded the third generation of vaccines, such as measles or mumps that were grown in tissue culture cells. The fourth generation of vaccines is currently the state-of-the-art, as typified by the Hepatitis B vaccine, in which a component of a virus is cloned, over-expressed, and purified from a recombinant microorganism and then delivered as a subunit vaccine in combination with an adjuvant.",

On one hand, the diseases in question have high associated morbidity and mortality, yet on the other hand, the likelihood of encountering these pathogens is extremely low. Since all vaccines have some side effects associated with them, one needs to carefully consider the risk-to-benefit ratio for these types of products. In order for a vaccine against a biowarfare agent to be widely implemented, it will have to be shown to be effective in an animal model and extremely safe. It is unlikely that traditional vaccine approaches will meet these requirements. Therefore, fifth generation vaccine delivery technologies will need to be employed. While there are a number of new vaccine delivery technologies in development that show promise, including DNA vaccines [2], [3], transdermal patches [4], [5], and recombinant plants [6], the use of commensal bacteria as an antigen delivery platform holds particular promise for this utility.",

These bacteria reside mainly within mucosal sites such as the mouth, the nose, the lungs, and the gastrointestinal and urogenital tracts. Although normally tolerant of commensal organisms, mucosal surfaces present physical barriers to invading pathogens. They also provide a primary line of defense because they possess specific local immune systems that provide an important component of protective immunity [7]. Antigen delivery directly to mucosal sites via non-pathogenic commensal bacterial vectors could provide a significant advantage over some of the more traditional vaccines in that live bacteria are capable of stimulating sustained systemic as well as local immune responses [8]. In addition, commensal bacteria are able to colonize the niche invaded by the pathogen and stimulate an immune response at their portal of entry to prevent infection. This ability, combined with the facts that bacteria are easily administered (i.e. topically), are cost efficient, and are well-tolerated [9], makes live commensal bacteria attractive vehicles for subunit vaccine delivery. One such promising commensal bacterium is Streptococcus gordonii, a normal inhabitant of the human oral cavity.",

These systems use the conserved pathway that all Gram-positive bacteria utilize to export and anchor proteins on the cell surface [10]. The foreign proteins are directed to the cell surface of the Gram-positive host by using portions of the M protein, a surface protein of S. pyogenes, as a fusion partner. The C-terminal end of the M protein consists of a conserved immunogenic C-repeat region (CRR), a hydrophilic region, the highly conserved enzymatic cleavage site (Pro/Gly), and hydrophobic amino acids that act to anchor the M protein to the cell surface (Fig. 3A). If secreted proteins are needed a stop codon is introduced at the carboxy terminus of the foreign protein. Without the membrane-anchoring regions to retain the protein on the surface of S. gordonii, the fusion protein is translocated through the cell membrane of the Gram-positive host cell, and secreted directly into the culture medium (Fig. 3B). This is called the SPEX vector system (for secreted protein expression).",

Because this plasmid cannot replicate in the Gram-positive host, it must integrate into the chromosome of the naturally competent S. gordonii in order to impart erythromycin resistance. Integration into the correct chromosomal location is confirmed by PCR, and expression of the encoded antigen is tested by Western blot using the appropriate antisera. Because the encoded antigen exists as an M-protein fusion, if no specific antiserum is available for the antigen, expression of the heterologous protein can be tested by reactivity with an anti-M protein monoclonal antibody [11].",

Most importantly, the potential for recombinant S. gordonii to be developed as a safe vaccine vector was supported by the finding that immunization of mice with S. gordonii expressing tetanus toxin fragment C (TTFC) induced protection from a lethal challenge with 50 LD50 of tetanus toxin [26]. Moreover, S. gordonii recombinants expressing FimA, the major subunit protein of P. gingivalis fimbriae, induced strong serum IgG and salivary IgA antibody responses, and protected against subsequent P. gingivalis-induced alveolar bone loss in germ free rats [27].",

In the 20th century alone, more than 300 million people succumbed to the disease. Variola virus, the causative agent of smallpox, is extremely infectious. It is usually acquired by inhalation of aerosol droplets spread by infected individuals. Variola major, a highly virulent form of smallpox, can cause death rates as high as 30%. The disease has a number of features that make it an \u201cideal\u201d agent of bioterrorism (Table 3\n). Although smallpox is of paramount concern, one should not neglect other potential orthopoxvirus pathogens. For example, there have been several recent incursions of monkeypox virus into the human population. Such an event transpired in the Midwest in the summer of 2003 when prairie dogs sold as pets became infected with the monkeypox virus through contact with Gambian giant rats and other rodents. Over 70 people became ill during this outbreak [28]. Another more chilling scenario is the possibility that a laboratory strain of vaccinia virus or cowpox virus could be genetically engineered to produce a toxin to convert it into a potent pathogen [29]. Fortunately, orthopoxviruses are highly related at the DNA level (e.g. 90% between variola and vaccinia) making it likely that any vaccine developed would stimulate immunity to this entire group of viruses [30].",

It should be noted that although the MVA genome has deletions in many of the known poxvirus immunomodulatory genes, it still retains the ability to express a large number of viral gene products of unknown biological activity. Furthermore, MVA recombinants are being widely developed as therapeutic vaccines against cancers. Widespread vaccination of the populace could induce immunity against the MVA virus itself and thus limit its usability as an anti-cancer vector. Therefore, these attenuated vaccinia strains may not be as useful as hoped as a smallpox vaccine for the general population.",

The molecular details of poxvirus assembly and differentiation are thought to be as follows: After (or concurrent with) viral DNA replication, progeny DNA molecules, viral enzymes, and structural proteins coalesce to form pre-virion particles [38]. These particles acquire two membranes by budding through the intermediate compartment (between the endoplasmic reticulum and the Golgi) to become infectious intracellular mature virus (IMV). A portion of the IMV subsequently becomes enveloped by two additional membranes as it passes through the trans-Golgi network. This form of virus is called the intracellular enveloped virus (IEV). Following migration to the cell surface, the outermost IEV membrane fuses with the plasma membrane to give rise to enveloped virus (EV) [39]. The EV can either remain associated with the cell as a cell-associated enveloped virus, (CEV) or can be released into the external medium as extracellular enveloped virus (EEV) [40].",

The EEV form of the virus is important for the long range dissemination of the virus within the host while the IMV form is thought to be important for transmitting infection between hosts [40], [41]. Thus, a suitable smallpox vaccine must be effective against both forms of this virus. For this reason, several VV proteins that were chosen as BCV vaccine candidate proteins are associated with the IMV form of the virus while others are associated only with the EEV forms. Other criteria required for the candidate subunit VV proteins were one or more of the following: (1) Does the candidate elicit humoral or cell-mediated immune responses? (2) Have the antibodies specific for the proteins been shown to be protective in animal models? (3) Can the parenterally delivered purified VV protein elicit protection? and (4) Does the induction of a cell-mediated response by delivery of these genes in a DNA vaccine confer at least partial protection? Based on these criteria several vaccinia proteins were chosen as promising candidates for the commensal smallpox vaccine. Some of these proteins and their characteristics are listed in Table 4\n.",

However, because of the high degree of homology among the orthopoxvirus, several additional animal models using other orthopoxvirus can also provide important information. Smallpox is a respiratory pathogen acquired by aerosolized virus. Cowpox virus can efficiently infect BALB/c mice by aerosol administration and, as such, can be used to evaluate the efficacy of smallpox vaccines in preventing lethal respiratory infections. Perhaps the most rigorous model for testing candidate smallpox vaccines is the monkeypox model used in Rhesus macaques. Monkeypox is an orthopoxvirus that infects monkeys and sometimes humans and is over 85% homologous to the variola major genome [42]. This model has also been used to evaluate the efficacy of vaccines against smallpox.",

First there will be the need to access sufficient federal funding to support the work. Given the political nature of the funding process, it is not known how long, or to what level funding will be available. Second, there is the difficulty of obtaining the pathogens themselves, given the recent legislation regulating their use. Third, there is the paucity of BSL-3 and BSL-4 laboratories available to use for the animal challenge experiments, as well as the experts to conduct the experiments. Fourth, there are the unanswered regulatory questions of what will be required in order to license a vaccine for human use. And finally, the potential market for a developed product must be considered. Who will be the consumer and how will they pay for the costs of the vaccine and its development? Regardless of the challenges, these are important goals in our defensive armature and it is hoped that the scientific, governmental and regulatory agencies will be able to effectively work together to make them a reality.",
