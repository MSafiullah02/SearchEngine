            "text": "Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) continues to cause zoonotic infections 17 and serious disease, primarily in the Arabian Peninsula, due to repeated spill-over from dromedary 18 camels and subsequent nosocomial transmission. Approved MERS vaccines for use in animals or 19 humans are not currently available. MERS-CoV replication requires the virus-encoded papain-like 20 protease (PL pro ) to cleave multiple sites in the viral replicase polyproteins, thereby releasing 21 functional non-structural proteins. Additionally, PL pro is a deubiquitinating enzyme (DUB) that can 22 remove ubiquitin(-like) moieties from substrates, presumably to counteract host antiviral responses. 23 In previous work, we determined the crystal structure of MERS-CoV PL pro in complex with ubiquitin, 24 facilitating the design of PL pro mutations that impair DUB activity without affecting viral polyprotein 25 cleavage. Here, we introduced these DUB-inactivating mutations into the viral genome and 26 examined their impact on MERS-CoV infection both in cell culture and in a lethal mouse model. 27 Although overall replication of DUB-negative and wild-type (wt) recombinant MERS-CoV was 28 comparable in multiple cell lines, infection with DUB-negative virus markedly increased mRNA levels 29 for interferon (IFN)-\u03b2 and IFN-stimulated genes. Moreover, compared to a wt virus infection, the 30 survival rate was significantly increased when DUB-negative MERS-CoV was used to infect transgenic 31 mice expressing a human MERS-CoV receptor. Interestingly, DUB-negative and wt MERS-CoV 32 replicated to the same titers in lungs of infected mice, but the DUB-negative virus was cleared faster, 33 likely due to the observed accelerated and better-regulated innate immune responses, in contrast to 34 delayed and subsequently excessive responses in wt virus-infected mice. This study provides the first 35 direct evidence that the DUB activity of a coronaviral protease contributes to innate immune evasion 36 and can profoundly enhance virulence in an animal model. Thus, reduction or removal of the innate 37 immune-suppressive DUB activity of PL pro s is a promising strategy for coronavirus attenuation in the 38 context of rational vaccine development. 3 39 Author Summary 40 Although zoonotic coronaviruses such as Middle East respiratory coronavirus (MERS-CoV) have 41 pandemic potential, therapeutics and vaccines that counteract this public health threat are not 42 currently available. Coronaviruses typically employ multiple strategies to evade the host's innate 43 immune response, which may enhance clinical disease and/or reduce the efficacy of modified live 44 vaccines. The MERS-CoV-encoded papain-like protease (PL pro ) is not only crucial for the expression of 45 functional replicase proteins, but has also been postulated to antagonize ubiquitination-dependent 46 steps during the activation of the innate immune response. Here, we report the generation of 47 engineered MERS-CoVs mutants in which PL pro 's deubiquitinating (DUB) activity was specifically 48 disrupted without affecting virus viability. In this manner, we could demonstrate that the DUB 49 activity of PL pro suppresses the interferon response in MERS-CoV-infected cells. Strikingly, in the 50 lungs of mice infected with DUB-negative MERS-CoV, innate immune responses were induced at an 51 earlier stage of infection than in wt virus-infected mice. This group also showed a clearly increased 52 survival, indicating that the DUB activity is an important MERS-CoV virulence factor. This proof-of-53",

To this end, mice were infected intranasally with 1x10 5 PFU of either wt or DUB-negative rMERS-CoV, whereas a third group of mice 415 was mock-infected. Each group contained a total of 16 mice of which 12 animals per group were 416 euthanized at early time points. The remaining four animals from each of these three groups were 417 monitored for a period of 14 days to assess their survival and measure their body weight on a daily 418 basis. All four mice infected with wt rMERS-CoV died or had to be euthanized after reaching a 419 humane endpoint by day 7 or 8 p.i. (Fig 4A) . In contrast, only one of the four mice infected with 420 DUB-negative rMERS-CoV died at day 8 p.i., while the other three mice survived for the full 14-day 421 period (Fig 4A) . Even with the small number of animals used for this experiment, this difference in 422 survival between mice infected with wt or DUB-negative rMERS-CoV is statistically significant (log-423 rank test p value = 0.028). Both wt and DUB-negative rMERS-CoV-infected mice lost weight over the 424 course of infection (Fig 4B) , but in all three surviving mice infected with DUB-negative rMERS-CoV 425 this weight loss was reversed from day 10 p.i. forward (Fig 4C) . The results clearly suggested that the 426 virulence of the DUB-negative virus was reduced compared to wt virus. progeny titers were approximately 1x10 6 PFU per g of lung tissue during the first four days after 433 infection (Fig 5) . The DUB-negative virus reached similar virus titers as the wt control during the first 434 two days p.i., indicating that this virus also replicates well in mice. Unexpectedly, however, it proved 435 impossible to recover virus from the lungs of three of the mice infected with DUB-negative rMERS-436 CoV (twice in the day 1 p.i. group, and once in the day 2 p.i. group; Fig 5) . Consequently, it remains 437 unclear whether these three animals had been successfully inoculated. All DUB-negative rMERS-CoV-438 infected mice that were euthanized at day 4 p.i. were virus-positive, and their lung titers were 439 significantly lower than in wt virus-infected mice at that time point (Fig 5) , suggesting that the DUB-negative virus is cleared faster from the lungs than wt rMERS-CoV. Virus titers were also determined 441 in mice that died from the infection at day 7-8 p.i. and in survivors of the infection at day 14. By day 442 7-8 p.i., the rMERS-CoV wt titers were around 1x10 4 PFU per g of lung tissue, signifying that virus 443 titers decreased over time (Fig 5) . The virus titer of the single mouse that died of the DUB-negative 444 virus infection was 2x10 3 PFU per g of lung tissue (Fig 5) . Virus could not be recovered from the lungs 445 of any of the mice that had survived the infection with DUB-negative rMERS-CoV after 14 days (Fig   446  5) .",

Although this is lower 589 than the previously reported peak titer at 2 days p.i. of 6x10 7 PFU per g of lung tissue (73) infection was lethal also in our hands, and all mice died at 7-8 days after infection (Fig 4A) . Likely, 597 the mice that succumbed to the infection also had MERS-CoV infection of the brain, however, the 598 experimental circumstances did not allow us to take samples to support this assumption. Strikingly, 599 infection with the DUB-negative virus resulted in a significantly increased survival compared to the 600 animals infected with the wt virus (Fig 4A) . The DUB-negative virus reached the same titers in the 601 lungs as the wt virus by 2 days p.i., but these had dropped significantly by 4 days p.i. while they 602 stayed high in the wt virus-infected mice (Fig 5) . In future research, it will be interesting to 603 determine whether histopathology is reduced in mice infected with DUB-negative rMERS-CoV to 604 confirm that earlier virus clearance and reduced tissue damage correlates with increased survival, 605 relative to in wt virus-infected mice.",

(Fig 6) . Although there was no statistically significant difference compared to wt 609 virus-infected mice, the trend of faster upregulation of these mRNAs was quite clear. Moreover, the 27 610 fact that the levels for all these transcripts increased simultaneously strengthens the conclusion that 611 the DUB-negative rMERS-CoV induced an accelerated innate immune response compared to the wt 612 virus, again confirming the role of the PL pro DUB activity in suppression of innate immune responses, 613 now also in the context of a mouse model. The transcript levels of IFNs and cytokines slightly 614 decreased in DUB-negative rMERS-CoV-infected mice at 4 days p.i., but in wt rMERS-CoV-infected 615 mice the mRNA levels were extremely upregulated (Fig 6) . We therefore hypothesize that the 616 difference in survival rate is likely due to an accelerated, and after induction properly down-617 regulated, innate immune response in DUB-negative virus-infected mice, which is likely more 618 effectively clearing the virus and preventing tissue damage, protecting these mice from lethality 619 (Figs 4-6) . In contrast, the response in wt virus-infected mice is first suppressed and then at later 620 time points it is extremely upregulated (Fig 6) . ",

            "text": "162 DUB-inactivating substitutions was characterized in cell culture-based experiments in which mutant 163 PL pro domains were overexpressed and, in accordance with the results of others, were found to have 164 lost the ability to suppress activation of the IFN-\u03b2/NF-\u03baB promoter (65-67). Here we describe the 165 generation of recombinant (r) DUB-negative MERS-CoVs with amino acid substitutions in PL pro , to 166 analyse for the first time, the impact of the DUB function on infection. These mutant viruses had 167 similar growth kinetics as wt rMERS-CoV, however mRNA levels for IFN-\u03b2 and ISGs were significantly 168 higher in cells infected with DUB-negative rMERS-CoV. In a lethal MERS-CoV infection model in mice, 169 the DUB-negative virus was found to be strongly attenuated as the survival rate of mice infected 170 with this mutant was significantly higher than for wt virus-infected mice. Furthermore, DUB-negative 171 virus was cleared faster from the lungs and mRNA levels of IFNs, ISGs, and cytokines were 172 upregulated earlier relative to those in control mice infected with wt rMERS-CoV. Collectively, this 173 demonstrates that CoV PL pro 's DUB activity enhances virulence in an animal model and that selective 174 removal of this activity could be a basis for the design of MLV vaccines. Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM; Lonza) with 8% fetal calf serum (FCS; 179 Bodinco BV), 100 units/ml penicillin (Lonza), 100 units/ml streptomycin (Lonza), 2 mM L-glutamine 180 and non-essential amino acids (both PAA). MRC5 cells (ATCC CCL-171) were cultured in Eagle's 181 minimum essential medium (EMEM; Lonza) with the same supplements as used in the medium for 182 HuH7 cells. BHK-21 cells (ATCC CCL-10) were grown in Glasgow minimum essential medium (Gibco) 183 supplemented with 8% FCS, 100 units/ml penicillin, 100 units/ml streptomycin, 10% tryptose 184 phosphate broth (Gibco), and 10 mM Hepes (pH 7.4; Lonza). 185 186 Construction and launch of recombinant mutant MERS-CoV 187 A full-length MERS-CoV cDNA in a bacterial artificial chromosome (BAC) vector (68) was previously 188 equipped with a T7 RNA polymerase promoter and a unique 3'-terminal NotI site for run-off 189 transcription (43). After passaging of the MERS-CoV EMC/2012 isolate in Vero cells, a premature 190 stop codon in ORF5 was observed in the minority of sequence reads, but this substitution became 191 fixed upon additional virus passaging (4, 39). To limit the development of genetic variation in ORF5 192 upon passaging of rMERS-CoV in cells, we decided to introduce this premature stop codon at ORF5 193 codon 108 in the MERS-CoV full-length clone (further explanation on the use of this adaptation is 194 provided in the Results section). This clone, pBAC-MERS-CoV-ORF5stop, was generated by two-step 195 en-passant in vivo recombineering reactions in E. coli (69). Subsequently, substitutions in the PL pro -196 coding sequence were introduced in this clone using the same procedure. Primer sequences to 197 introduce substitutions in pBAC-MERS-CoV are available upon request. Bacmids were isolated from 198 bacteria and sequenced to verify the presence of the introduced substitution(s). pBAC-MERS-CoV-199 ORF5stop and derivatives thereof were linearized with NotI and they were purified by phenol-200 chloroform extraction and ethanol precipitation. Approximately 1 \u00b5g DNA was used as a template 10 201 for in vitro transcription using the mMESSAGE mMACHINE T7 transcription kit (Thermo Fisher 202 Scientific). BHK-21 cells (5x10 6 ) were electroporated with 5 \u00b5g of this in vitro transcribed RNA using 203 the Nucleofector 2b device (Lonza; program T-020) with Cell Line Nucleofector Kit T (Lonza).",

This prompted us to evaluate this DUB-negative virus in a lethal mouse model for MERS-CoV 407 infection, which relies on transgenic mice expressing the human DPP4 (hDPP4) receptor under the 408 control of the K18 promoter (73). Intranasal inoculation of these mice leads to MERS-CoV replication 409in the lungs and production of interferons, cytokines, and chemokines. Ultimately, the animals 410 develop pathological changes in their lungs but also in their brain, and most likely the mice die of 411 neurological disease due to MERS-CoV infection in the brain (73).",

Coronaviral PL pro s constitute a striking example of this kind of dual functionality, 537 as they not only cleave multiple sites in the replicase polyproteins of which they are part, but can 538 also deconjugate Ub, and Ub-like modifiers such as ISG15, presumably to suppress innate immune 539 responses (55).

The decrease in MERS-CoV genome RNA levels was not observed in single-cycle infections 564 in cell culture, highlighting that primary replication of the mutant viruses is not affected by the 565 substitution in PL pro . In summary, by specifically disrupting the PL pro interaction surface that binds 566 Ub, we have demonstrated that the DUB activity of PL pro indeed contributes to innate immune 567 evasion in the context of the MERS-CoV-infected cell. 568 The importance of vDUB activity in the context of infection has thus far been tested for only 569 a few viruses. Previously, the vDUB activity of equine arteritis virus (EAV), belonging to the order 570 Nidovirales like CoVs, and Crimean-Congo haemorrhagic fever virus (CCHFV), a nairovirus in the 571 order Bunyavirales, were specifically eliminated by mutagenesis (78, 79). These vDUBs are members 572 of the ovarian tumor domain-containing family of DUBs and are structurally different from CoV 573 PL pro s, which belong to the ubiquitin-specific protease DUB family. The replication of CCHFV was 574 attenuated in IFN-competent cells upon DUB inactivation, due to the induction of a more robust 575 immune response (78). DUB-negative EAV replicated like wt virus in equine lung fibroblasts, but did 576 elicit enhanced innate immune responses (79). Nevertheless, in vivo the mutant virus provided an 577 equal level of protection as the parental (attenuated) virus (80). Recently, the structural equivalent 578 of the MERS-CoV V1691R substitution was introduced into SARS-CoV PL pro , yielding mutant SARS-579",

            "text": "These results resemble the late and excessive IFN and 621 pro-inflammatory cytokine response that likely contributes to lung immunopathology as observed 622 for SARS-CoV infection in mice (38, 76). Recently, it was also demonstrated that the timing of the 623 type I IFN response was crucial in the outcome of a MERS-CoV infection in mice (82). In line with our 624 results, early administration of type I IFN was protective (comparable to responses induced by DUB-625 negative rMERS-CoV) whereas late administration promoted lethality (like in wt rMERS-CoV-infected 626 mice) (82). Together, these observations support a concept in which delayed and aberrantly 627 regulated innate immune response as a result of viral innate immune evasion importantly 628 contributes to pathogenesis during infection. Notably, it is possible that other cellular processes 629 besides innate immunity are influenced by PL pro s DUB activity, which might also affect mice survival. 630 Therefore, it remains important to make a full inventory of cellular protein targets that are 631 deubiquitinated by PL pro , and to assess how such targets affect host responses and survival by 632 influencing the innate immune system and other cellular processes. Thus, the DUB-negative rMERS-633 CoV can be an important tool to further explore CoV-host interactions. 634 In two of the mice that survived the DUB-negative rMERS-CoV infection, we could measure 635 neutralizing antibodies against MERS-CoV. The third surviving mouse did, at this relatively early time point of 14 days p.i., not have a detectable neutralizing antibody titer. The observed variation might 637 be related to the course of infection, as the weight loss of this third mouse was the smallest of the 638 three mice that survived the infection (Fig 4C, mouse 1), suggesting that MERS-CoV infection was 639 milder than in the other two animals. It will be interesting to measure the acquired protection in the 640 DUB-negative MERS-CoV infected mice by challenging them with (lethal) MERS-CoV. Although more 641 in-depth characterization is necessary, the DUB-negative MERS-CoV may be a MLV vaccine candidate 642 that can induce antibody responses as well as T-cell responses, which both are important for 643 providing long-term effective protection against CoV infections (83-85). Interestingly, for MERS-CoV, 644 vaccines are currently being designed for use in humans as well as dromedary camels, the latter 645 aiming to reduce virus circulation and transmission to humans (84-86). 646 In summary, our results demonstrate, for the first time, that the presence of PL pro 's DUB 647 activity causes a delay in the innate immune response, which has a major impact on pathogenesis in 648 the mouse model used. Pathogenesis and lethality can thus be reduced by removal of the DUB 649 activity, resulting in earlier, better-regulated and therefore likely more effective innate immune 650 response that helps to clear the virus and decreases pathogenicity, despite the initial viral replication 651 being similar to that seen in wt virus infections. Our study has thus also provided the proof-of-652 concept for the in vivo attenuation of MERS-CoV, which provides a basis to advance the analysis of 653 the innate response as well as antibody and T-cell-mediated responses triggered by infection with 654 DUB-negative MERS-CoV. It creates the opportunity to apply this strategy to develop MLV vaccines 655 against MERS-CoV as well as other CoVs of societal or economic importance, such as porcine 656 epidemic diarrhoea virus, feline CoV, avian infectious bronchitis virus, and bovine CoV. Also in the 657 CoV field, the \"attenuation-by-design\" approach to eliminate one or more innate immune evasive 658 functions may offer a general and effective strategy for MLV development.
