According to epidemiologic modeling conducted by Ferguson et al [1], both the United States and the United Kingdom face a dilemma in terms of choosing a public health response. On one hand, the models predict severe consequences, including high death rates, if the virus is permitted to run its course without any intervention or response. However, the authors conclude that an optimal outcome following a strategy of disease suppression would likely require dramatic alterations to daily life, including social distancing for the entire population until a vaccine is available. Such an intervention may result in significant economic loss. Ferguson and colleagues [1] noted that technological solutions such as a contact tracing smartphone app may provide alternatives to the drastic measures they proposed.",

Existing contact tracing apps typically rely on the collection of personal data such as timestamped locations to determine exposure risk [3]. Location data are highly personal, and the privacy concerns detailed above are especially salient for location data [7]. Furthermore, location is only a proxy for contact, and inferences about exposure based on location may not always be accurate due to noise in the data [8].",

The transmission graph, then, is a network of interactions between individuals. In this graph, each node (contact point) represents a physical interaction between two or more individuals at a specific time and place, during which microbial agents could potentially be transmitted from one individual to others. Of note, there are no entities in the graph that represent an individual, and location information is never encoded in this data structure.

Such a model, while not intended to describe real-world trajectories, allows for the demonstration of the feasibility of our proposal and provides a rudimentary mechanism to compare various scenarios and app parameters, such as the adoption rate, the diagnosis delay estimated by the app, and the safety period used by the app. The model was written in the R (R Foundation for Statistical Computing) programming language, and the source code is publicly accessible on GitHub [9].

Authorized users could be health care or laboratory workers who process test results or deliver such results to patients.

The app allows users to opt for reporting a confirmed diagnosis, in which case the user is prompted to scan their printed QR code.

Specifically with this app, users will be expected to create contact points by scanning QR codes whenever gathering with other people. This would ideally include not only private gatherings, but also public outings at places such as local businesses. To facilitate contact points for larger numbers of people, local businesses could allow customers to join a contact point by scanning a QR code upon entry. However, users may become fatigued from such behavior over time and choose to discontinue or may be dissuaded from participating at the onset.

Additionally, microbes may linger on surfaces and thus be transferred between individuals who are at the same location at different times. Measures can be taken to mitigate these transmission routes. First, objects and surfaces can be disinfected between interactions to limit transfer beyond the interaction. Second, contact points can be left open for longer periods of time to more accurately capture the possible transmission routes. For example, a grocery store may host a contact point by allowing customers to scan a QR code upon entry. This contact point could be left open from the opening time to the closing time so that all customers shopping that day would be registered into a single contact point, reflecting the fact that an infected shopper in the morning could transfer microbes across surfaces to a shopper that was present in the afternoon. To limit transmission of microbes from one day to the next, stores could thoroughly disinfect surfaces between closing time one day and opening time the next day.",
