The kind of inference tasks undertaken include computing, for planning purposes, the posterior distribution over putatively controllable, via direct policy-making choices, simulation model parameters that give rise to acceptable disease progression outcomes. Neither the full capabilities of such inference automation software tools nor their utility for planning is widely disseminated at the current time. Timely gains in understanding about these tools and how they can be used may lead to more fine-grained and less economically damaging policy prescriptions, particularly during the current COVID-19 pandemic.",

These software tools can be used to quickly identify the range of values controllable variables should be driven to by law, social pressure, or public messaging so as to limit the spread and impact of an infectious disease such as COVID- 19. In this work, we review a simple form of planning as inference and show how to use existing software tools to perform the computations necessary to perform this inference task in pre-existing stochastic epidemiological models. As but one example, if our policy aim is to produce infectious population totals that remain below some threshold at all times in the future, we can condition on this putative future holding and examine the allowable posterior distribution of controllable behavioural variables at the level of agents or of the aggregate population. As we already know, to control the spread of COVID-19 and its impact on society, policies must be enacted that reduce disease transmission probability or lower the frequency and size of social interactions. This is because we might like to, for instance, not have the number of infected persons requiring hospitalization exceed the number of available hospital beds.",

In the former, the controls available to policy-makers are blunt -\"reduce social interactions by some fractional amount\" -but how best to achieve this is left as an exercise for policy-makers. In the latter, variables like \"probability of individuals adhering to self-isolation\" and \"how long should schools be closed if at all\" can be considered and evaluated in combination and comparison to others as potential fine-grained controls that could achieve the same policy objective more efficiently.",

            "text": "When governments impose any such controls, both citizens and financial markets want to know how draconian these measures must be and for how long they have to be in effect. Policy analysis based on models that reflect variability in resources such as healthcare facilities in different jurisdictions could hopefully make the answers to these questions more precise and the controls imposed more optimal in the utility maximizing sense. The same holds for the difference between models that can or cannot reflect variations in population mixing between rural and urban geographic areas. A person living in a farming county in central Illinois might reasonably wonder if it is as necessary to shelter in place there as it is in Chicago. Current approaches to model-based policy-making are likely to be blunt. Simple models, for example compartmental models, are rapid to fit to new diseases and easy to compute, but lack the necessary expressivity to consider and evaluate fine-grained policy options, for instance regional policy-making. The net effect of being able to only consider blunt controls arguably has led to a collective dragging of feet, even in the face of the current COVID-19 pandemic. This delayed reaction combined with late, brute application of control, has led to devastating socioeconomic impact, with many sectors such as education, investment markets, and small-medium enterprises being directly impacted. We can and should be able to do better. We believe, and hope to demonstrate, that models and software automation focused on planning as inference for policy analysis and recommendation is one path forward that can help us better react to this and future pandemics, and improve our public health preparedness.",

First, the pre-existing models we use to demonstrate our points in this paper are not perfectly calibrated to present-day population dynamics and specific COVID-19 characteristics. We have made some efforts on the latter point, in particular sourcing a COVID-19 adapted compartmental model [1, 2, 3] and parameters from [4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13] , but we stress this limitation. In addition, the type of problems we discuss solutions for in this paper may be solved in some cases with more direct implementations involving parameter sweeps and \"manual\" checking for desired policy effects, albeit at potentially higher human cost.",

As well, the basic structure of simulators currently available may lack important policy-influenceable interaction parameters that one might like to examine influencing. If viewed solely in light of the provided examples, our contribution could reasonably be seen as both highlighting the utility of inference for planning in this application setting and intelligently automating the manual selection of policy parameters that achieve success. The tools that we highlight and showcase are capable of significantly more; however, for expediency and clarity we have focused on control as inference, an application that has seen relatively little specific coverage in the literature. We leave other straightforward applications of automated inference tools in this application area, like parameter inference from observed outbreak data [14, 15, 16, 17, 18] , to others.",

Beyond this demonstration, we hope to encourage timely and significant developments on the modelling side, and, if requested, to actually aid in the fight against COVID-19 by helping arm policy-makers with a new kind of tool and training them how to use it rapidly.

There exists a disease whose transmission properties may only partially be known, but whose properties cannot themselves be readily controlled. There exists a population dynamic that can, in part, be controlled. There exists a \"policy goal\" or target which we will refer to as the allowable, allowed, or goal set. An example of this could be \"the total number of infectious persons should not ever exceed some percentage of the population\" or \"the first date at which the total number of infectious persons exceeds some threshold is at least some number of days away.\" We assume an implied \"allowable\" population dynamics, in the sense that if a population behaves according to a prescribed policy, the goal will be attained with high probability and if the population does not follow the policy, the goal will not be attained with high probability. We acknowledge but ignore the costs and benefits of choosing among policies and suggest that many approaches to maximizing utility require solving the problem we address in this paper as a sub-problem first.",

This is because in the real world, many of the variables crucially impacting the dynamics of simulations are not directly observable, such as the number of infectious but asymptomatic carriers or the actual number of contacts people make in different regions each day. These variables are called latent, as opposed to observable variables such as the number of deaths or the number of passengers boarding a plane each day, which can often be directly measured with high accuracy. It is often absolutely crucial to perform inference over some latent variables to achieve reliable forecasts. For example, the future course of an epidemic like COVID-19 is driven by the number of people currently infected, rather than the number of people currently hospitalized, while in many countries in the world currently only the latter is known.",

This choice of problem was driven by the hypothesis that the search for effective controls may not in fact be particularly well-served by automation at the current time. In the epidemiological context, the questions we are trying to answer are ones like \"when and for how long do we need to close schools to ensure that we have enough ventilators for everyone who needs them?\" While obviously this is overly simplistic and many different policy decisions need to be enacted in tandem to achieve good outcomes, we use this example to illustrate tools and techniques that can be applied to problems of realistic complexity.",

Again, our aim here is to inform or remind a critically important set of policy-makers and modellers that these methodologies are extremely relevant to the current crisis. Moreover, at least partial automation of model-informed policy-guidance is achievable using existing tools, and, may even lead to sufficient computational savings to make their use in current policy-making practical.

These models break the population down to a series of compartments (e.g. susceptible (S), infectious (I), exposed (E), and recovered (R)), and treat them as as continuous quantities that vary smoothly and deterministically over time following dynamics defined by a particular system of ordinary differential equations.

Compartmental models are usually more blunt unless the number of compartments is very high and it is indexed by spatial location, demographics and age categories. Increasing the number of compartments adds more unknown parameters which must be estimated or marginalized. Agent-based models are complex by nature, but they may be more statistically efficient to estimate, as they are parameterized more efficiently, often directly in terms of actual individual and group behaviour choices. In many cases, predictions made by such models are more high fidelity, certainly more than compartmental models with few compartments, and this has implications for their use as predictive tools for policy analysis. For instance, policies based on simulating a single county in North Dakota with excellent hospital coverage and a highly dispersed, self-sufficient population could lead to different intervention recommendations compared to a compartmental model of the whole of the United States with only a few compartments.",

The model we use is an example of a classical SEIR model [1, 2, 3] . In such models, the population is subdivided into a set of compartments, representing the susceptible (uninfected), exposed (infected but not yet infectious), infectious (able to infect/expose others) and recovered (unable to be infected). Within each compartment, all individuals are treated identically, and the full state of the simulator is simply the size of the population of each compartment. Our survey of the literature found a lack of consensus about the compartmental model and parameters which most faithfully simulate the COVID-19 scenario. Models used range from standard SEIR [12, 11, 7, 57] , SIR [58, 7, 59, 60, 61] , SIRD [62, 63, 64] , QSEIR [65] , and SEAIHRD [66] . The choice depends on many factors, such as how early or late in the stages of an epidemic one is, what type of measures are being simulated, and the availability of real word data. We opted for the model described in this section, which seems to acceptably represent the manifestation of the disease in populations. Existing work has investigated parameter estimation in stochastic SEIR models [67, 68] . Although we will discuss how we set the model parameters, we emphasize that our contribution is instead in demonstrating how a calibrated model could be used for planning.",

It uses six compartments: susceptible (S), exposed (E), infectious with mild (I 1 ), severe (I 2 ) or critical infection (I 3 ), and recovered (R). We do not include baseline birth and death rates in the model, although there is a death rate for people in the critically infected compartment. The state of the simulator at time t \u2208 [0, T ] is X t = {S t , E t , I 1,t , I 2,t , I 3,t , R t } with S t , E t , I 1,t , I 2,t , I 3,t , and R t indicating the population sizes (or proportions) at time t.

Plots in the left column show the full state trajectory, and in the right column are cropped to more clearly show the exposed and infected populations. Without intervention, the infected population requiring hospitalization (20% of cases) exceeds the threshold for infected population (0.0145, black dashed line), overwhelming hospital capacities. With intervention (u=0.37) the infected population always remains below this limit. Note that we re-use the colour scheme from this figure through the rest of the paper.",

We therefore describe how we can perform inference and conditioning in a stochastic model requiring less strict assumptions, and show that we are able to provide meaningful confidence bounds on our inferences that can be used to inform policy decisions more intelligently than without this stochasticity. As described in Section 4, stochasticity can be introduced to a model through a distribution over the latent global parameters \u03b7. Examples of stochastic simulations are shown in Figure 3a . Clearly there is more capacity in this model for representing the underlying volatility and unpredictability of the precise nature of real-world phenomena, especially compared to the deterministic model. However, this capacity comes with the reality that increased effort must be invested to ensure that the unknown latent states are correctly accounted for. For more specific details on dealing with this stochasticity please refer back to Section 4, but, in short, one must simulate for multiple stochastic values of the unknown parameters, for each value of the controllable parameters, and agglomerate the many individual simulations appropriately for the inference objective. When asking questions such as \"will this parameter value violate the constraint?\" there are feasibly some trajectories that are slightly above and some slightly below the trajectory generated by the deterministic simulation due to the inherent stochasticity (aleatoric uncertainty) in the real world. This uncertainty is integrated over in the stochastic model, and hence we can ask questions such as \"what is the probability that this parameter will violate the constraint?\" Using confidence values is this way provides some measure of how certain one can be about the conclusion drawn from the inference -if the confidence value is very high then there is a measure of \"tolerance\" in the result, compared to a result with a much lower confidence.",

Using census-based models available for every state and county in the US and selected international locations, FRED simulates interactions within the population in discrete time steps of one day. Transmission kernels model the spatial interaction between infectious places and susceptible agents. Agents follow their own belief about susceptibility, severity and provided social benefits and barriers, such as health insurance and paid sick leave. Additionally, FRED can model immunity at the individual and population level, as well as the co-evolution of different viral strains. These characteristics enable FRED to provide much more fine-grained policy advice at either the regional or national level, based on socio-economic and political information which cannot be incorporated into compartmental models.",

These changes can be directly examined by browsing one of the public source code repositories accompanying this paper. 3 First, the random number generator and all random variable samples must be identified so that they can be intercepted and controlled by PyProb. Second, any variables that are determined to be controllable (i.e. part of \u03b8) need to be identified and named. Third, in the main stochastic simulation loop, the state variables required to compute Y aux t and Y obs t must be extracted. Fourth, these variables must be given either synthetic ABC likelihoods or given constraints in the form of likelihoods. Finally, a mechanism for identifying, recording, and or returning X 0:T to the probabilistic programming system must be put in place. FRED, like many stochastic simulators, includes the ability to write-out results of a run of the simulator to the filesystem. This, provided that the correspondence between a sample \u03b8 (i) and the output file or files that correspond to it is established and tracked, is how X (i) 0:T is implicitly defined. In the interest of time and because we were familiar with the internals of PyProb and knew that we would not be using inference algorithms that were incompatible with this choice, the demonstration code does not show a full integration in which all random variables are controlled by the probabilistic programming system, instead, it only controls the sampling of \u03b8 and the observation of Y aux t . Notably this means that inference algorithms like lightweight Metropolis Hastings [75] , which are also included in PyProb, cannot be used with the released integration code.",

The certainty in the result under the stochastic model is not a binary value like in the deterministic case, and instead occupies a continuum of values representing the confidence of the results. We see that the intersection between the red and green curves occurs at approximately 0.5, explaining the observation that approximately half of the simulations in Figure 5a exceed the threshold. We can now ask questions such as: \"what is the parameter value that results in the the constraint not being violated, with 90% confidence.\" We can read off rapidly that we must instead reduce the value ofR 0 to 50% of its original value to satisfy this confidence based constraint. Repeating the stochastic simulations using these computed values confirms that very few simulations violate the constraint (Figure 5c ). The ability to tune the outcome based on a required level of confidence is paramount for safety-critical applications, as it informs how sensitive the system is to the particular parameter choice and is more resilient to model misspecification.",

However, u is not something that is directly within our control. Instead, the value of u is set through changing policy level factors. As an exploratory example we suggest that the value of u is the square root of the product of two policy-influenceable factors: the fractional reduction in social contact, \u03c1, below its normal level (indicated as a value of 1.0), and the transmission rate relative to the normal level, \u03c4 , where we again denote normal levels as 1.0. This relationship is shown in Figure 5e . Figure 5a shows a stochastic simulation usingR 0 = 0.63R 0 , identified as an acceptable parameter value under the deterministic model. However, once used in a stochastic system, the parameter performs poorly, yielding many simulations that violate the constraint. This highlights why analyses in deterministic systems can yield poor results. Figure 5b repeats the analysis in Figure 4a adding planning in the stochastic simulation, where the y-coordinate can now be interpreted as the confidence level. Figure 5c shows a simulation using the lowest valid value of u, representing the \"weakest\" valid policy. This value, approximatelyR 0 = 0.5R 0 , renders most of the trajectories under the threshold, with only a small fraction above, implying that it will satisfy the criteria with high probability. Figure 5d shows simulations usingR 0 = 0.4R 0 effectively reduces the level of infection to near zero. Figure 5e illustrates an example of how policy-level variables create model-level parameter values. Shown are the level-sets of the free parameter u \u2208 [0, 1], which acts to reduce the baseline reproduction rate R 0 asR 0 = (1 \u2212 u)R 0 . We suggest that the reduction in the (unknown) reproduction rate is given by the root of the product of two factors controllable through policy. Green level sets indicate that the value of u was effective and achieved a 90% confidence that the trajectory does not violate the constraint, whereas red curves do not satisfy this.",

We suggest taking the least invasive, valid policy, being represented by the highest green curve. Once the analysis above has been performed to obtain a value of u, that satisfies the required infection threshold, it defines the set of achievable policies. Any combination of \u03c4 and \u03b7 along this curve render the policy valid. Here, additional factors may come into consideration that make particular settings of \u03c4 and \u03b7 more or less advantageous. For instance, wearing more PPE may be cheaper to implement and less economically and socially disruptive than social distancing, and so higher values of \u03c4 may be selected relative to \u03b7. This reduces to a simple one-dimensional optimization of the cost surface along the level-set. Figure 6 : Here we briefly demonstrate the capacity of the SEI 3 R model in a model predictive control setting. Figure  6a shows the state when we begin controlling the system at t = 200 with some level of infection already present. We solve for the minimum required control such that the constraint is satisfied. We plot the 90% confidence interval over trajectories conditioned on this control value. We then step through the system, randomly sampling continuations, and adapting the controls used such that the constraint is always met (Figure 6b ). We uncover that the amount of control required reduces over time as herd immunity comes into effect. We reuse the colour scheme defined in Figure 2a for plotting trajectories. While we have simply hypothesized this as a potential relationship, it demonstrates how policy level factors influence simulations and outcomes. While the SEIR model family is an invaluable tool for analyzing and understanding the bulk dynamics of outbreaks, it is too coarse-grained for actual, meaningful, localized policy decisions to be made, especially when those policy decisions are directly influencing populations. Further, these notions of \"policy\" are somewhat abstract here because of the high-level nature of the SEI 3 R model used. We now go on to resolve these issues by using the more sophisticated, agent-based simulator, FRED, where simulations are able to represent localized variations, and, where real policy measures are more easily defined.",

We are also releasing code that demonstrates how a complex, existing, agent-based epidemiological dynamics model can be quickly interfaced to an existing probabilistic programming system so as to automate, even in such a complex, agent-based epidemiological model, the inference tasks which are required to be solved when framing control as inference. Again, we stress that the specifics of the models we use to illustrate these techniques are not optimally calibrated for COVID-19 and that we do not report methodological innovation per se as existing inference packages applied to existing models can be easily repurposed to solve the control problem by posing it as inference as we have.",

While COVID-19-specific FRED parameters were not available at the time of writing, and only very limited population dynamics data was released publicly (effectively just for Allegheny County, Pennsylvania), we still were able to demonstrate how to do the systems integration required to wire up automated inference in the FRED simulator. With this integration we were able to explore how policy-makers might search for fine-grained controls using inference, albeit in an influenza model rather than a COVID-19 model. It is our hope that this demonstration will inspire a few things to happen. One, creating COVID-19-specific parameters and interaction models for FRED would make it, potentially in combination with PyProb, a formidable policy analysis tool, particularly because it could allow very targeted policies to be adapted in efficient and potentially region-specific ways. Doing this kind of potentially more-precise policy-making could lead to enormous societal benefit, particularly economically. Indeed, the entire point of this demonstration is to show that with a high-fidelity simulator an expanded and potentially more targeted set of policy interventions can be explored in a, for instance, regionally-specific manner. As we could only examine a single county in Pennsylvania, we can only hypothesize that the set of effective policy interventions might differ between counties, states, or countries. Rapid expansion of the number of counties, provinces, and countries that can be currently simulated in FRED, or any other agent-based model that is subsequently interfaced to PyProb, would allow us or others to quickly test this hypothesis.",

These methods and the models to which they have been applied could be repurposed for planning, in the way we have shown that it can be done, simply by changing the quantities that they observe to include control optimality variables as we have demonstrated. There are at least two existing papers that we have identified that explore using probabilistic programming coupled to epidemiological simulators; [29] which used Libbi [83] and [49] which used PyProb. The latter is an example of work that \"hijacks\" a malaria simulator in the same way we \"hijacked\" the FRED simulator in this paper. Neither explicitly addresses control. There is another ( [18] ) that uses the probabilistic programming system STAN [84] to address parameter estimation in SEIR-type models, but it too does not explore control, nor could it be repurposed to control an agent-based model.",

For instance, we could also condition the model on total reported number of deaths due to COVID-19, collected on a daily or weekly interval. However, as the epidemiological community already relies upon long-standing methods established for estimating \"confidence intervals\" for model parameters during evolving pandemics, we exclusively restricted ourselves to demonstrating how to achieve control via inference and assume that all control inference tasks are conducted using priors that are posteriors from other, established parameter estimation techniques.
