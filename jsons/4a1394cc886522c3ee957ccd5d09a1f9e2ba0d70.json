            "text": "Little research focuses on how counsellors experience counselling encounters concerning intimate partner violence. This study reports on narrative research conducted with eight South African non-governmental organisation counsellors. Participants spoke of creating productive and caring counselling dynamics, and providing non-directive counselling. However, they also indicated providing moral guidance, particularly in cases where pregnancy or children were involved. Success was viewed rather narrowly as the women leaving the relationship, setting up 'all-or-nothing' outcomes. Such 'success' led to counsellor happiness, whilst failure in this regard led to counsellors experiencing anger and burn-out. We conclude that the conundrums evident in these data are grounded in patriarchal systems, limiting the efficacy of counselling based on a bondage and deliverance narrative. Implications for practice and training are also outlined.",

The resource-related barriers include the relative lack of availability of healthcare or service provision facilities in the first place (Mbokota and Moodley 2004; Modiba et al. 2011; Njuho and Davids 2012) . Other reasons include lack of adequate assistance due to problematic interactions with counsellors (Rasool Bassadien and Hochfeld 2005) . That is, counsellors may sometimes view IPV as a private matter, or that it is a normal phenomenon, possibly leading to lack of action or non-interference (Rasool Bassadien and Hochfeld 2005); they may misdiagnose IPV (Joyner and Mash 2012) , be afraid to intervene on behalf of the community (Lewis et al. 2005) , and may not have received adequate or appropriate primary care training (noted locally, Mash et al. 2012, and globally, Watts and Mayhew 2004) . In terms of social issues, some women may not report abuse due to conservative gender roles; e.g., the belief that the man is the head of the household and that his authority, and manner in which he runs the household, should not be questioned (Sugarman & Frankel 1996 , cited in Jewkes et al. 2002 .",

Women may either accept such violence as an everyday feature of their intimate relationships, or may see themselves as deserving of violent treatment from their partners for failing to adhere to culturally-located gendered expectations regarding their relationship roles (Kim and Motsei 2002; Wood et al. 2007) . As a result, many women who experience IPV may feel that their violent partners were justified in their actions or that they did not harm them intentionally (Silverman et al. 2004) . Women may also feel reluctant or ashamed about reporting IPV (Lewis et al. 2005) due to the personal, and sometimes sexual nature of the assault (Vogelman and Eagle 1991) . Cultural and contextually mediated understandings of violence in intimate relationships, as well as subjective interpretations of the relative harm sustained, may also play a role. For example, anthropological research in South Africa has described violence in interpersonal relationships as being understood by those involved as a demonstration of love, depth of feeling, or emotional investment in the relationship, with women victims of IPV consequently downplaying the harm caused (Wood et al. 2008) .",

In the first interview, the counsellors were asked, using an open-ended narrative-inducing question, to share their understandings of IPV, and their experiences with conducting counselling sessions with clients who were in relationships characterised by IPV. In the second interview, held 15 min after the first one, the researcher asked questions based on topics that had emerged during the first interview. The third and final session was conducted two months later, once the data had been transcribed and after a preliminary analysis had been conducted on the data, so as to determine which topics would be suitable for follow-up questions in the final interview.",

The transcribed data were imported and coded using QSR NVIVO 10, a qualitative data analysis software program. Coding centred on the identification of micro-narratives. In the analysis, we examined common micro-narratives occurring across the interviews and at different times in the same interview, which allowed us to see patterns in the counsellors' micro-narratives.

Throughout the data, 'success' was described by the counsellors as the woman removing herself from the IPV relationship. As such, the classic narrative of women being delivered from bondage formed the foundation of counselling. Within this narrative, women who remain are regarded as victims and women who leave are considered survivors. This creates a dichotomy or an 'all-or-nothing' position within the counselling dynamic. The counsellor's emotional investment in the client and relationship building (such as ensuring confidentiality and thus building trust, listening attentively, displaying empathy where possible, promoting strength) was seen as worthwhile when the woman leaves the relationship (see also Lewis et al. 2005) . However, the counsellors indicated becoming discouraged when the woman remained within the relationship.",

There is no guarantee that the women will be able to successfully leave their current relationship characterised by IPV, or avoid another one in the future, and the counsellors were painfully aware of this. They nevertheless held onto the narrative of Bbondage to deliverance^or Bvictimhood to survivorhood^as the only valid outcome of counselling. This singular narrative regarding what constitutes a 'successful' outcome of counselling women who have had experiences of IPV during pregnancy, does not take into account the sometimes very real structural and/or cultural obstacles that frequently prevent women from leaving relationships characterised by IPV (e.g., economic dependency on their partners for survival, or culturally-located customs and traditional practices regarding marriage bonds) (see Fleischack et al. 2017 ). This 'narrow' view of counselling outcomes may, therefore, be more likely to fail than not. Indeed counsellors' insistence on clients' adherence to patriarchal and culturally-entrenched forms of motherhood may unwittingly constitute a barrier to successfully leaving an IPV relationship, thereby undermining their own criterion for a successful outcome (that is, leaving the IPV relationship).",

The conundrums illustrated above point to a number of implications in terms of the counselling process. Firstly, to obviate counsellors feeling that their emotional investment has not been worthwhile, a useful perspective would be to see clients as complex beings: somewhere between victim and survivor, slipping between the two depending on circumstances, or as neither. This may also allow the counsellors to see and value small gains in their counselling process. Examples include: when the women come to counselling in the first place, because they feel hopeful that they can receive some assistance; valuing women having a comfortable space to share their stories to gain some insight (which also links to Moon's 2006 idea that story telling is a means to healing); and the notion of women engaging in everyday practices that serve to increase their agency and reduce the IPV, even if it involves remaining in the relationship.",

This is particularly important in circumstances where, as mentioned earlier, some women feel unable, for a range of reasons (e.g., financial, childcare), to leave the relationship. Research into IPV risk factors and reduction interventions have highlighted key risks and aspects that, if addressed, might lower the likelihood of IPV occurring. These include addressing, for example, poor relationship communication and conflict management skills (Abrahams et al. 2006; Hatcher et al. 2014) , as well as economic and social empowerment initiatives (Jewkes et al. 2014; Kim et al. 2007; Pronyk et al. 2006) .

The kind of support received from colleagues that was spoken about by participants is essential. Peer support as well as sensitive clinical supervision go a long way in developing growth and self-care in counsellors, as identified by Friesema (2016) . Equally, though, counselling needs to be supplemented with a focus on accountability or collective responsibility for IPV in communities. This, thus, suggests the need for widerscale interventions and advocacy. Running these kinds of interventions alongside counselling may assist counsellors in feeling less burnt-out and despondent about what is and is not achievable in this context.",

On the flip side, uncontained emotions such as anger may surface and may interfere with the sessions. This is particularly pertinent when, as in this case, the 'success' of the counselling is narrowly defined.
