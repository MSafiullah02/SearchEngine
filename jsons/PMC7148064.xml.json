As a matter of fact, referential units such as names of persons, locations and organizations underlie the semantics of texts and guide their interpretation. Around since the seminal Message Understanding Conference (MUC) evaluation cycle in the 1990s [11], named entity-related tasks have undergone major evolutions until now, from entity recognition and classification to entity disambiguation and linking [21, 25]. Besides the general domain of well-written newswire data, named entity (NE) processing is also applied to specific domains, particularly bio-medical [10, 14], and on more noisy inputs such as speech transcriptions [9] and tweets [26].",

First, at the technical level, the adoption of deep learning architectures and the usage of embedded language representations greatly reshapes the field and opens up new research directions [1, 16, 17]. Second, with respect to application domain and language spectrum, NE processing has been called upon to contribute to the field of Digital Humanities (DH), where massive digitization of historical documents is producing huge amounts of texts [30]. Thanks to large-scale digitization projects driven by cultural institutions, millions of images are being acquired and, when it comes to text, their content is transcribed, either manually via dedicated interfaces, or automatically via Optical Character Recognition (OCR). Beyond this great achievement in terms of document preservation and accessibility, the next crucial step is to adapt and develop appropriate language technologies to search and retrieve the contents of this \u2018Big Data from the Past\u2019 [13]. In this regard, information extraction techniques, and particularly NE recognition and linking, can certainly be regarded as among the first steps.",

First, inputs can be extremely noisy, with errors which do not resemble tweet misspellings or speech transcription hesitations, for which adapted approaches have already been devised [5, 27]. Second, the language under study is mostly of earlier stage(s), which renders usual external and internal evidences less effective (e.g., the usage of different naming conventions and presence of historical spelling variations) [2, 3]. Further, beside historical VIPs, texts from the past contain rare entities which have undergone significant changes (esp. locations) or do no longer exist, and for which adequate linguistic resources and knowledge bases are missing [12]. Finally, archives and texts from the past are not as anglophone as in today\u2019s information society, making multilingual resources and processing capacities even more essential [22].",

More precisely, articles were first randomly sampled from each year of the considered decades, with the constraints of having a title and more than 100 characters. Subsequently to this sampling, a manual triage was applied in order to keep journalistic content only and to remove undesirable items such as feuilleton, cross-words, weather tables, time-schedules, obituaries, and what a human could not even read because of OCR noise.",

Such processing can support research questions in various domains (e.g. history, political science, literature, historical linguistics) and knowing about their performance is crucial in order to make an informed use of the processed data.
