Here we report the clinical course and liver pathology in three SARS patients with liver impairment. Three patients who fulfilled the World Health Organization case definition of probable SARS and developed marked elevation of alanine aminotransferase were included. Percutaneous liver biopsies were performed. Liver specimens were examined by light and electron microscopy, and immunohistochemistry. Reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) using enhanced real-time PCR was applied to look for evidence of SARS-associated coronavirus infection. Marked accumulation of cells in mitosis was observed in two patients and apoptosis was observed in all three patients. Other common pathologic features included ballooning of hepatocytes and mild to moderate lobular lymphocytic infiltration. No eosinophilic infiltration, granuloma, cholestasis, fibrosis, or fibrin deposition was noted. Immunohistochemical studies revealed 0.5% to 11.4% of nuclei were positive for proliferative antigen Ki-67. RT-PCR showed evidence of SARS-associated coronavirus in the liver tissues, but not in the sera of all 3 patients. However, electron microscopy could not identify viral particles. No giant mitochondria, micro-or macro-vesicular steatosis was observed. In conclusion, hepatic impairment in patients with SARS is due to SARS-associated coronavirus infection of the liver. The prominence of mitotic activity of hepatocytes is unique and may be due to a hyperproliferative state with or without disruption of cell cycle by the coronavirus.

Indeed, SARS-CoV is detectable in less than 50% of sera of SARS patients beyond 14 days after fever onset. 19 Because ribavirin and Kaletra were given to all three patients prior to liver biopsy, viral replication might possibly be suppressed and hence no virus could be identified by electron microscopy.

Immunohistochemical study using Ki-67 stain showed that hepatocytes were highly replicative. Ki-67 proliferative index has also been reported as 0.4% to 1% in chronic active hepatitis C, 8, 21, 22 but the index for acute viral hepatitis remains unknown. However, hepatocytes in the mitotic phase are uncommonly seen even in acute or chronic hepatitis and liver cirrhosis even when regeneration takes place rapidly. 23 The finding of conspicious mitoses in our patients appears out of proportion to the extent of liver cell damage as assessed biochemically or histologically. The possibility of cell cycle disruption caused by coronavirus should be considered. Studies of transmissible gastroenteritis virus (a group 1 coronavirus) and mouse hepatitis virus showed that nucleolar localization of nucleoprotein (N protein) is a common feature of the coronavirus family, and about 30% of Vero cells transfected with the nucleoprotein appear to undergo cell division. 24 This observation has also been reported in the avian infectious bronchitis virus (a group 3 coronavirus). 25 A delay in mitosis or inhibition of cytokinesis could lead to an accumulation of cells in the M phase of the cell cycle and hence the appearance that a significant number of cells undergo cell division.

Studies show that some coronaviruses exert extensive cytopathic effect through the induction of apoptosis of their host cells by caspase activation. 27, 28 Mouse hepatitis virus can also activate the immune coagulation system by the fgl2 gene, which encodes a specific prothrombinase. It induces macrophage procoagulant activity, 29 which in turn leads to fibrin deposition on the endothelium of intrahepatic veins and hepatic sinusoids resulting in confluent hepatocellular necrosis. However, our specimens did not show any sinusoidal dilatation or fibrin deposition on the hepatic veins. On the other hand, fibrin thrombi and intimal swelling of pulmonary vessels have been reported among patients with SARS. 30 An alternative explanation of the liver impairment in SARS patients is hepatotoxicity due to antiviral treatment. Kaletra has been used for the treatment of SARS in more than 100 patients in Hong Kong. Preliminary results show that 30-day mortality and intubation rates are lower in the Kaletra-treated group compared with patients treated with ribavirin. 31 Elevation in ALT greater than fivefold the upper limit of normal has been reported in 3% to 11% of patients taking Kaletra. 32 Ribavirin also increases mitochondrial toxicity in HIV-infected patients treated with protease inhibitors. 33, 34 However, we do not favor this possibility, because hepatotoxicity usually develops only after long-term use of antiviral agents. Furthermore, our patients had no pancreatitis, myopathy, lactic acidosis, or other clinical features suggestive of mitochondrial toxicity. Occasionally, hepatotoxicity may occur in the first few weeks after initiating antiviral therapy; this is typically related to immune-mediated hypersensitivity and generally occurs in conjunction with allergic reactions such as fever and rash. 35 However, our patients had no such clinical features, and their liver biopsies did not show any eosinophilia, giant mitochondria, or microvesicular steatosis suggestive of drug toxicity. 36 -39 Furthermore, there is no consistent temporal relationship between the antiviral treatment and liver function impairment. In primary human hepatocytes, ribavirin can also inhibit cell proliferation induced by mitogenic factors by way of a delayed progression to the S phase of the cell cycle. 40 However, liver histology of patients with chronic hepatitis C does not show any features of cell cycle arrest after ribavirin monotherapy. 41, 42 Further studies are warranted to determine whether or not SARS-CoV infection, like chronic hepatitis B and C virus infection, [43] [44] [45] may increase the hepatotoxicity of the antivirals.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 247, "end": 249, "text": "26", "ref_id": "BIBREF25"}, {"start": 499, "end": 502, "text": "27,", "ref_id": "BIBREF26"}, {"start": 503, "end": 505, "text": "28", "ref_id": "BIBREF27"}, {"start": 680, "end": 682, "text": "29", "ref_id": "BIBREF28"}, {"start": 1061, "end": 1063, "text": "30", "ref_id": "BIBREF29"}, {"start": 1420, "end": 1422, "text": "31", "ref_id": "BIBREF30"}, {"start": 1547, "end": 1549, "text": "32", "ref_id": "BIBREF31"}, {"start": 1657, "end": 1660, "text": "33,", "ref_id": "BIBREF32"}, {"start": 1661, "end": 1663, "text": "34", "ref_id": "BIBREF33"}, {"start": 2176, "end": 2178, "text": "35", "ref_id": "BIBREF34"}, {"start": 2365, "end": 2371, "text": "36 -39", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 2664, "end": 2666, "text": "40", "ref_id": "BIBREF39"}, {"start": 2806, "end": 2809, "text": "41,", "ref_id": "BIBREF40"}, {"start": 2810, "end": 2812, "text": "42", "ref_id": "BIBREF41"}, {"start": 2939, "end": 2943, "text": "[43]", "ref_id": "BIBREF42"}, {"start": 2944, "end": 2948, "text": "[44]", "ref_id": "BIBREF43"}, {"start": 2949, "end": 2953, "text": "[45]", "ref_id": "BIBREF44"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Discussion"}, {"text": "In conclusion, SARS-CoV can infect livers leading to mild to moderate lobular inflammation and apoptosis.
