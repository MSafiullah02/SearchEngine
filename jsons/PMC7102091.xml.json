However, the Ct value is routinely used in virology laboratories as a semi-quantitative measure of the amount of virus present in samples as has been shown in previous studies [21\u201324]. Our data would support the use of quantitative PCR for the management of hospitalized patients with influenza virus infection in order to discriminate the presence of abnormal findings on chest X-ray or lymphopenia. However, the currently available viral load assays present several technical problems, including the lack of an international standard, the lack of consensus on specimen types, and the influence of the timing of specimen collection in viral load results [25]. In our opinion, it would be useful to have a standardized quantitative PCR as a diagnostic tool to evaluate these hospitalized patients.",
