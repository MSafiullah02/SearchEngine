However, tools specifically targeting virus needs are still rare and under-researched (Hufsky et al., 2018, Ibrahim et al., 2018, H\u00f6lzer and Marz, 2017). For example, long-range RNA\u2013RNA interactions (LRIs) play an important role in the life cycle of RNA viruses. Many LRIs are already known to act directly as activators or inhibitors of viral replication and translation (Nicholson and White, 2014). For example, several interactions have been recently identified as potential new LRIs in the genome of the hepatitis C virus (HCV) using LRIscan (Fricke et al., 2015). Some of these computationally identified interactions have already been verified experimentally (Romero-L\u00f3pez and Berzal-Herranz, 2012, Tuplin et al., 2012, Friebe et al., 2005, Liu et al., 2009, Honda et al., 1999a, Wang et al., 2000, Kim et al., 2003, Beguiristain et al., 2005).",

Thus, SIM directly accepts the whole sequence as input, together with a start and end position for the snips and the reading frame. The tool first extracts the requested interacting segments from each sequence. Each of them will be automatically increased in both directions if the provided range would otherwise split a codon, based on the predefined reading frame (Fig. 1). This ensures a preservation of all codons. Both sequences, pre-snip1 (ps\n1) and pre-snip2 (ps\n2), will then be fold together using RNAcofold to acquire only codons involved in the folding. Unpaired codons at the termini will be removed to get the final snip1 (s\n1) and snip2 (s\n2) from which SIM calculates the two mutant sequences mut1 (m\n1) and mut2 (m\n2).",

Importantly, having a small mfe difference between the wild-type (mfe(s\n1\n,s\n2)) and the single mutants (mfe(s\n1\n,m\n2) or mfe(m\n1\n,s\n2)) would diminish the mutational effect on the interaction. It is therefore vital to increase the distance between these mfe scores. Therefore, the user can directly specify the required distance with the filter percentage (--filterperc) parameter. The defined value is then multiplied with the mfe(s\n1\n,s\n2) value to obtain an upper limit (denoted l) for mfe(s\n1\n,m\n2) and mfe(m\n1\n,s\n2). Then, the tool creates all foldings between s\n1 and Q as well as P and s\n2. Each folding mfe(s\n1\n, q\nj \u2208 Q) and mfe(p\ni \u2208 P, s\n2) (with i and j defining the i-th and j-th element of set P and Q, respectively) is only considered for the next recovery step if the mfe is higher than l. The new sets mut1 (U) and mut2 (V) have a drastically reduced size compared to P and Q which greatly reduces the computational complexity for finding the two mutant sequences m\n1 and m\n2 where mfe(m\n1\n,m\n2) is similar to the wild-type mfe(s\n1\n,s\n2). While it seems to be convenient to set a very low --filterperc parameter, this could also result in an empty permutation set. On the other hand, setting a high --filterperc could result in longer running times. It is therefore recommended to start with the default 0.5 and later adjust this parameter depending on the performance.",

The running time of this folding process strongly depends on the previous attenuation step. When using the unprocessed P* and Q* sets from the example in Fig. 1, the number of required folding operations would be around 24 million and reduced to only 37,000 for the filtered sets U and V. Some LRIs function as inhibitors for viral replication (Nicholson and White, 2014) and a stronger interaction would decrease functional viral reproduction. For the simulation of the double-mutant interaction it is therefore necessary to set a lower but also an upper similarity threshold. Each of the calculated mfe(ui\u2208U,vj\u2208V) values are therefore compared with the wild-type mfe(s\n1\n,s\n2).

An unfavorable v and u pair would result in a significantly higher single-mutant mfe of the mutant folded with the WT sequence in comparison to the mfe of the other mutant and WT combination. Therefore, it is recommended to keep both, mfe(s\n1\n,v\ni \u2208 M) and mfe(u\ni \u2208 M, s\n2), in a similar range while minimizing the combined mfe. Accordingly, the sampling step takes the mutation range (-mrg) parameter into account and calculates the lower threshold l-mrg as(mfe(s1,vi\u2208M)+mfe(ui\u2208M,s2))\u00b70.5\u00b7(1+mrg)and the upper threshold u-mrg as(mfe(s1,vi\u2208M)+mfe(ui\u2208M,s2))\u00b70.5\u00b7(1\u2212mrg)for each mutant tuple.

Importantly, we limited the number of possible mutation pairs to four and calculated the mfe between the WT and mutant (mut) combinations in mere seconds. We further increased the search space of single mutants through setting the filter percentage parameter to 0.6, derived from the difference between the lowest single-mutant and the WT mfe value (\u221224.60 kcal/mol \u00f7 \u221214.00 kcal/mol = 0.569; see Fig. 2\na and c). Because there exist multiple double mutants with reasonable mfe values, we also had to define an exact search range for the double-mutant. The lower deviation was set to 1.07 and the upper deviation to 1.08, based on the difference between the double-mutant and WT mfe values (\u221226.40 kcal/mol/\u221224.60 kcal/mol = 1.0731; see Fig. 2a and b). The SIM results of the secondary structure predictions and mfe values for the two IAV segment combinations are shown in Fig. 2. By only allowing a maximum of four mutation pairs, we were able to calculate the same structures and mutations as previously proposed by Gavazzi et al. (2013a). Moreover, our results show a mfe difference of 1.80 kcal/mol between wild-type and double-mutant (Fig. 2a and b) and a mfe difference of 2.20 kcal/mol between single-mutants (Fig. 2c and d). Again, we want to point out that for the in silico experiment it is preferable to have a similar mfe between the two wild-type IAV segments mfe(NS\nWT\n, PB1\nWT) and the double-mutant mfe(NS\nmut\n, PB1\nmut) as well as between the single mutants mfe(NS\nWT\n, PB1\nmut) and mfe(NS\nmut\n, PB1\nWT).",

Furthermore, we have chosen this interaction as an example, since one interacting segment is located in a coding region and the other segment in a non-coding region. Applying SIM on this interaction resulted in two compensatory point mutations in each snip (Fig. 4\n). As the 3\u2032 SLII region is non-coding, only the point mutations in the snip from the 5BSL3.2 structure are silent. Our results show, that the wild-type structure mfe(5BSL3.2\nWT\n, SLII\nWT) should have a similar strength compared to the calculated double-mutant structure mfe(5BSL3.2\nmut\n, SLII\nmut), see Fig. 4. Additionally, both mfe(5BSL3.2\nWT\n, SLII\nmut) and mfe(5BSL3.2\nmut\n, SLII\nWT) weaken the interaction significantly.",

The tool can be used to heavily reduce the search space of possible synonymous mutation interactions between two RNAs. Another difficulty when creating silent IAV mutations lies in preserving the codons on the positive strand, while mutating the negative strand, and is also intercepted by SIM. Furthermore, our tool provides a significant speedup, not only in the verification of interactions in these two viruses, but also for many other virus families. Our simulations will help to gather a deeper understanding of the translation and replication processes in viruses and also how long-range interactions are regulating these.",

Both so-called pre-snips are folded with RNAcofold to remove unpaired codons at the endings. We refer to an extracted single-stranded RNA snippet as snip. (b) All possible codon permutations (here, reverse complements due to ssRNA-) are generated for both snips (called perms) to conserve the amino acid sequence. Permutations with too many mutations defined by the mutations (-mut) parameter are discarded. (c) To further decrease the total number of combinations, SIM will fold each snip with all permutations of the other snip and keep permutations with a mfe higher or equal to mfe(snip1, snip2) times the filter percentage (-prc) parameter, denoted as upper limit l. (d) All remaining snip1 permutations will then be folded against all snip2 permutations to find snip1 and snip2 mutations with a similar fold mfe. A double-mutant mfe(mut1, mut2) fold is considered to be similar, if its mfe is lower than the wild-type mfe(snip1, snip2) times the lower deviation (-ldv) parameter and higher than mfe(snip1, snip2) times the upper deviation (-udv) parameter. (e) The last step will minimize a combined single-mutant mfe(snip1, mut2) and mfe(mut1, snip2) by keeping both mutations in a similar range depending on the mutation range (-mrg) parameter. The range for each mutation combination is defined by (mfe(snip1, mut2) + mfe(mut1, snip2)) \u00b7 0.5 \u00b7 (1 + -mrg) for the lower threshold (l-mrg) and (mfe(snip1, mut2) + mfe(mut1, snip2)) \u00b7 0.5 \u00b7 (1 \u2212 -mrg) for the upper threshold (u-mrg).
