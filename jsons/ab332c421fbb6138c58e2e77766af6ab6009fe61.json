In response, the United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and other health organizations have advocated for both voluntary and enforced control measures. Among basic public health recommendations, social distancing measures have been recommended, involving avoiding social gatherings with ten or more people, keeping a physical distance of at least 2 m, and cancelling non-essential in-person activities [2, 3] . More extreme measures have since been implemented, including statewide \"shelter-in-place\" or \"stay-athome\" orders [4, 5] . Residents are allowed to leave their houses for essential services (e.g. grocery stores, pharmacies) but are otherwise expected to remain at home [4] . At the time of writing this Note, nearly all U.S. states have some form of stay-at-home order in place [6] .",

Social isolation was measured using latent class analysis. other person, in a relationship, had someone reliable to count on for support and friendship, or reported being 'socially satisfied.' The MI group (N = 508, 54.3%) was composed of PLHIV who reported: living alone, not engaged in any type of relationship, not socially satisfied, or not having someone reliable to count on for support and friendship. Lastly, the SI class (N = 88, 9.4%) included individuals likely to live alone, not in a relationship, not socially satisfied, or did not have someone to count on for support and friendship. When considering those included in both the minimally and socially isolated classes, 63.7% (N = 596) experienced some degree of social isolation in the LISA Study. Given the prevalence of social isolation that we identified among PLHIV, it is particularly relevant to consider the impacts of the COVID-19 outbreak within this population. As previously noted, older adults living with HIV have restricted social networks due to both HIV-related stigma and ageism [17] . The aging population is also most susceptible to severe health effects of COVID-19 [2] . Therefore, due to the various shelter-in-place and physical distancing measures, it is likely that this disease is resulting in more social isolation, and in greater severity, than previously experienced among PLHIV. In addition, many AIDS service organizations and other community-based organizations, which can provide opportunities for socializing to combat isolation and loneliness among PLHIV, have been required to limit non-essential programming [20] . While this is absolutely necessary for limiting COVID-19 cases, it seems evident that actions taken to curb spread of this respiratory virus will, in fact, exacerbate isolation-related vulnerabilities among PLHIV. However, it has yet to be seen how these vulnerabilities will play out.",

While many schools and companies have transitioned to functioning online, community based organizations may lack the capacity to do so. Given that these organizations help support socializing needs of PLHIV, it would be beneficial to provide increased funding at this time to support the establishment of online programming or telemedicine projects, for example. As previous research has shown that programs targeting loneliness are most beneficial when those affected are involved in the implementation and conceptualization of the projects [9] , it is imperative that PLHIV are included when discussing needed programming. Further, individuals marginalized by socio-structural inequities may not have access to materials required for online participation. Therefore, it is necessary to also focus on evaluating mental health of PLHIV, during and after the COVID-19 control measures, to better understand and address loneliness in this population.",
