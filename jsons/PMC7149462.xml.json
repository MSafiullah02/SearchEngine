Although the threat posed by resistance to antibiotics is almost as old as their use, it is only now that AMR is garnering global attention. The World Health Organization's (WHO) first global report on AMR surveillance (World Health Organization 2014, IX) summarized the scope of the threat, stating that, \u201cA post-antibiotic era\u2014in which common infections and minor injuries can kill\u2014far from being an apocalyptic fantasy, is instead a very real possibility for the 21st Century.\u201d Unlike other newly emergent diseases\u2014severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), Influenza A virus subtype H5N1, Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS CoV), and the Zika virus\u2014which all originated in a particular country, AMR is a truly global threat with novel outbreak sites in multiple countries.",

According to the model put forward by Buzan, W\u00e6ver, and de Wilde 1998, an existential threat is first identified and accepted by an audience before a series of resource reallocations and policy responses is undertaken (emergency mode processes and policies) to resolve it. At its heart, the model presupposes that the initial actions taken by securitizing actors and agencies represent a rational attempt to resolve an existential threat to human existence. While the elements of this model have long been criticized\u2014in terms of an overemphasis on the verbal nature of speech acts (Williams 2003; M\u00f6ller 2007), the neglect of the role of audiences (Balzacq 2005; Vaughn 2009), or the Eurocentric nature of its agenda (Vuori 2008)\u2014Buzan and W\u00e6ver (2009) have also observed that the theoretical and empirical space between the state and the global levels needs more attention.",

In particular, middle-level actors\u2014and their attendant securitization processes\u2014can become disaffected with their subordination to the higher-level process. Due to the global spread of infectious diseases and related health threats (such as AMR), the concurrent securitization responses provide valuable case studies wherein the conceptual utility of macrosecuritization can be evaluated (Lo and Thomas 2018).",

By consciously not integrating lower-tier actors and processes into the macrosecuritization framework, we argue that the model has suboptimal theoretical utility. It is only by understanding the perceptions and behaviors of these actors that it is possible to ascertain whether an issue has been securitized or not. As will be shown later in this article, from a surface reading of Chinese responses to AMR it would be possible to conclude that a middle-tier securitization\u2014one that is integrated into a macrosecuritization\u2014has taken place. Chinese officials, state media, and bureaucracies have all committed speech acts to support global efforts to address the existential threat of AMR. This is supported by domestic policy and technical communities that have reallocated funds and developed new policies and practices to address AMR threats.",

Instead, we argue that AMR has been securitized by national authorities to enforce central health policy control over subnational authorities, the general population, or local market actors. This is necessitated by the presence of competing lower-level policy and economic logics.",

This follows Buzan and W\u00e6ver's observation that we must \u201cunderstand the tensions between overarching macrosecuritizations and the lower level securitizations that they contain and coordinate\u201d and provides an initial contribution to answering how \u201cmacrosecuritisations [are] affected when they have to incorporate a new lower level securitization which undermines commitment to a larger goal\u201d (Buzan and W\u00e6ver 2009, 275). Implicit in this observation is the fact that it cannot be assumed that lower tiers will automatically follow middle-tier securitization processes\u2014even in authoritarian systems. Ever since the 1980s, there has been a fragmentation of bureaucratic power in China between national and subnational actors. This fragmentation goes well beyond just the health sector to include economic policies, environmental regulations, and other areas of governance. Usually these are issues of domestic politics but the centrality of the Chinese biomedical and agribusiness sectors to international AMR efforts means that understanding Chinese policy and practice reactions to AMR is critical to evaluating the macrosecuritization of AMR globally.",

This study was motivated by a move made on the part of the Chinese leadership to securitize the threat without an epidemiological trigger event that would rationalize such a decision (as occurred with, for example, the SARS outbreaks in Foshan and Hong Kong). In our initial interviews, we met with leading microbiologists, infectious disease specialists, and epidemiologists from the Chinese Academy of Sciences, the China Center for Disease Control and Prevention (China CDC), key research laboratories, and local universities. These interviews were supplemented with a second series of interviews with representatives from international health agencies (in China and globally), with public health specialists from other countries based in China, and with local researchers engaged in disease surveillance. Finally, we met with Chinese farmers engaged in poultry and pork production. These interviews were conducted in Cantonese, English, or Mandarin under the Chatham House Rule.

Most securitizations take place at the state and individual levels.

The relationship between macrosecuritization and middle-level securitizations is, however, not necessarily peaceful. The structure is \u201cvulnerable to breakdowns not just by desecuritization of the macro-level threat (or referent object). . . but also by the middle-level securitizations becoming disaffected with, or pulling away from, subordination to the higher level one\u201d (Ibid).

Lo and Thomas (2018) added AMR as another case of macrosecuritization, based on the extent to which AMR responses fulfill the basic format of macrosecuritization and have been securitized at the global level.

As a result, these countries have moved beyond speech acts to emergency mode reallocations of resources to address AMR. For example, in 2015 the United States allocated close to double the funding to different federal agencies to address the threat posed by AMR. Of the US$1.2 billion allocated, over US$1 billion was related to public health aspects of anti-AMR programs, with the remaining funds targeted to animal and agricultural AMR strategies (White House 2015). Between 2007 and 2013, the EU allocated \u20ac314.1 million (\u223cUS$357 million) to AMR prevention programs (Kelly et al. 2016, 436), with member states making their own contributions.

Fleming's comments were made at a time when antibiotic supplies were still limited for most people and a year before biochemists identified the use of antibiotics as growth promoters in livestock. While the development of resistance can originate from insufficient quantities of antibiotics, a host can be equally endangered from using too many antibiotics. In China, the latter issue is more severe within the population. A nationwide survey of 230,800 prescriptions, given across 784 community health institutions in twenty-eight Chinese cities from 2007 to 2009, shows that the number of antibiotic prescriptions given was two times more than that recommended by the WHO (Li et al. 2012). Another report showed that roughly 57 percent of people in China had received antibiotics over the previous six months in 2015 (Zhongguo pinglun tongxunshe 2015).

This is due to the widely held belief that an intravenous (IV) drip (dadiandi) is a panacea for all kinds of illnesses. A 2009 study indicated that the average person in China consumes eight bottles of IV infusion fluid per year against a world average of 2.5\u20133.3 bottles per person (World Health Organization 2012).

Public hospitals receive only 10 percent of their funding from the government, and so they make up the 90 percent shortfall by charging patients for medicine (Lazarus 2016). More importantly, public hospitals are allowed to sell medicines and antibiotics with a 15 percent markup to cover operation expenses. Regulatory attempts made by the state in 2009 to cancel this markup practice as part of the EDL reform did not, however, effectively resolve the problem, as problems related to financial incentives were not fully addressed. The latest effort to address this issue is the 2017 Trial Opinion on the Implementation of a Two-Invoice System for Public Medical Institutions\u2019 Drug Procurement, or the \u201ctwo-invoice system\u201d for public medical institutions. Under the new system, manufacturers send their products to a distributor, and these products are then transported directly to hospitals or clinics (Li and Sindik 2017). This is an important reform developed to standardize drug circulation, to reduce the number of drugs in circulation, and thus to lower drug prices (as prices increase with the number of distributors and intermediaries involved/with the number of invoices issued). However, a senior AMR scientist commented that, \u201cwithout an increase in budgets to public hospitals, medical institutions have to find ways to gain profits to sustain daily operations.

While funding to the public healthcare sector has increased in percentage terms (State Council 2017), it is coming off a low base, one where most of the new fiscal capacity is to support long-term institution building rather than directly addressing an existential threat from AMR or similar health insecurities (S\u00fcssmuth-Dyklerhoff and Wang 2010). As McInnes and Rushton (2013, 128) argue, \u201calthough the absence of emergency measures may not in itself be conclusive, it may offer an indication that an issue has not been fully securitized.\u201d In the absence of a resources shift by Chinese authorities, it is hard to argue that the motivation for securitizing AMR is to deal with the perception of it as an existential threat.",

Initially promoted by Deng Xiaoping, China has since become a global economic player that is deeply enmeshed in the international trade system. This has led to rising incomes and to a shift in patterns of food consumption away from a grain-based diet to one wherein meat plays a more dominant role. In terms of international trade, this long-term period of economic development has also led to more intensified livestock product trade, coupled with an awareness of the importance of quality control. The latter factor in particular is supporting a growth in imports from overseas markets that are perceived to be safe and/or a source of higher-quality meats (e.g., Australia, Canada, and New Zealand). However, even though food safety is an ongoing issue for Chinese consumers, it is focused on more explicit problems\u2014melamine in dairy products, for example\u2014and less on the presence of antibiotics in local food production processes.",

By 2013, this had increased to over 113 million head of cattle (Han et al. 2016). As Sampaio stated in Reed and Rodrigo (2015), \u201cBeef consumption is directly related to income. China has rising incomes and a large population. This is reflected in an increase in protein consumption.\u201d Similarly, Chinese pork production levels have increased sevenfold since the late 1970s, rendering China the largest consumer and producer of swine products in the world (The Economist 2014). In line with these trends, Chinese production of poultry and eggs has also increased markedly since the liberalization of the agricultural sector. China is now the second largest producer of chicken meat and the largest producer of eggs in the world, with both chicken meat and eggs forming a significant part of the daily Chinese diet. This growth in both livestock production and antibiotic usage has been and will continue to be facilitated by an ongoing structural reorganization of Chinese farms away from small-scale operations to large commercial operations. While this mirrors changes occurring in other countries such as the United States, it has not been accompanied by a concomitant increase in food safety.",

Here, the difference between Chinese commercial farms and those in, for example, the United States is stark. Cargill, for example, has begun to phase out antibiotics use in its swineherds (Cargill undated). This has been achieved with only slight increases in disease prevalence and slight losses of growth potential (Interview D 2017). Hence, the rationale to use antibiotics as a growth promoter that emerged after the Second World War, and which continues to dominate production plans in Chinese commercial farms, is no longer necessarily valid when a hygienic environment is established.6",

China is no exception. In China, while the human abuse of antibiotics is partly attributed to financial incentives for public healthcare facilities to sell unnecessary and expensive antibiotics, the overuse of antibiotics in the animal husbandry sector is likewise induced by economic incentives for the use of antibiotics as growth promoters. Despite the fact that data show little or even no economic benefits in terms of meat production, growth promotion uses are a major contributor to antibiotics usage in Chinese food animal farms. As the largest antimicrobial consumer of livestock in 2010, China used one-third of all growth-stimulus antibiotics fed to livestock worldwide (Van Boeckel et al. 2015).",

It takes only 40 days for the former chickens to be ready to sell on the market and 200 days for the latter\u201d (Interview E 2017). The same farmer noted that when he and other farmers can access cheap human antibiotics, these are also fed to the animals for either growth promotion or therapeutic purposes. This echoes comments made by the head of a Chinese microbiology lab who mentioned that \u201cthe effectiveness of tetracycline [as a growth promoter] remains inconsistent. In any case, farmers feel that tetracycline and antibiotics in general facilitate livestock production, and so they add antibiotics to livestock feed\u201d (Interview F 2016).",

One reason for colistin's widespread application in piggeries is its toxicity, which meant Chinese authorities never approved it for human use. Another reason is that colistin is an older drug and so it is fairly cheap; therefore, Chinese farmers can administer a large volume of colistin together with animal feed at a low cost. Recent figures show that, as the world's largest pig producer, China is also the largest consumer of the 12,000 tons of colistin in agriculture each year (Zhang 2015). China is also one of the world's largest producers of colistin for animal husbandry. Although the dangers posed by using such last-line antibiotics in livestock are well documented, only recently have these dangers been tied to the use of colistin in the Chinese swine industry. In 2015, MCR-1 was found in pigs in China. A year later, the gene was identified in humans, some of whom had acquired their infections from animals directly or from eating pork (Garrett and Laxminarayan 2017). MCR-1 is now found on every continent. The global spread of the gene implies that humans are losing a last-resort antibiotic for curing deadly drug-resistant superbug infections (e.g., carbapenem-resistant infections). The emergence of colistin resistance has sparked fears concerning public health in China, renewing calls for urgent policy responses to address the use of antibiotics for animal husbandry.",

From our interviews with representatives of international health organizations, external health agencies, and domestic actors, this shortcoming is well known, globally and within China. However, the desire to address the threat of AMR and to develop global action on the issue is governed by realpolitik considerations that accept suboptimal commitments in exchange for consensus building.

The unwillingness of the Chinese government to develop a broad-based approach to AMR reinforces our central argument that the current efforts to securitize the issue are concerned with issues other than its existential threat potential.",

As this study demonstrates, there is a clear need to go behind the speech act in order to understand it.7 Hence, while Buzan, W\u00e6ver, and de Wilde's (1998) original assertion that anyone can securitize anything remains valid, the assumption that the process\u2014when developed through its subsequent stages\u2014is intended to address an existential threat can be challenged. Only by focusing on a pre-stage level at which motivations for the securitizing act can be examined can the rationale for securitization be properly determined. Furthermore, when this rationale is absent or subordinated to another purpose, the macrosecuritization or lower-tier securitizations can be said to be imperfectly (at best) realized, if not substantively absent.",

While Buzan and W\u00e6ver's work would suggest that states are the audience, the theory also allows for lower tiers to be subsumed into the process. At the same time, the theory allows for contending lower-tier political or securitization agendas to exert bottom-up pressure on the process. Hence, the notion of audience needs to be unpacked. As our case study highlights, even as the Chinese state has supported the macrosecuritization of AMR, subnational and individual-level actors have ignored (partially or completely) the resulting national directives. As we have shown, this lower-tier resistance has come about due to contending political and resource competitions within the state. A question that arises beyond the scope of this article is: To what extent does the emergency distribution of resources during securitization validate the act itself? In this article, we have identified a negative case\u2014where the insufficient distribution of emergency resources weakens audience acceptance and thus the domestic securitization of AMR and, as a consequence, the macrosecuritization of AMR.",

As we note in reference to the MOHNARIN network, funds the state has made available are insufficient to operate a truly national surveillance program despite claims to the contrary. While there is also the CHINET network of sentinel hospitals and laboratories as well as closed WeChat networks for clinicians and infectious disease researchers, these also have gaps. Moreover, there is no sense of integration between these different capacities. This leads to a patchwork approach to AMR, in particular, and to infectious disease surveillance, more generally. Such a result is at odds with China's image as a centralized state that can implement core directives as needed. Even in the age of Xi Jinping's China Dream, the provinces and lower-tier public health agencies and institutions are able to disregard or imperfectly implement policies and practices when this suits their needs.",

In the case of China, when the state does not supply sufficient funding, external health agencies and foundations can do so. However, as noted above, competition generated by resource scarcities can create a perversely competitive environment wherein even viral samples are not shared between local hospitals because when a host hospital runs an analysis it creates a basis for that hospital to seek additional funding for training and equipment.",

In resource-constrained countries, such as China and Indonesia, competition is more severe because resources are scarcer. Equally, in Vietnam, the state simply manages disease control, preferring not to expend scarce resources on their elimination and only taking action when human lives are threatened or when the issue attracts international attention (Interview J 2017). This, in turn, means that external donors can affect local public health priorities disproportionate to the actual needs of the recipient state and society.",

In other words, as W\u00e6ver (2011, 474) put it, undertaking the securitization for \u201cother reasonings than threat or necessity.\u201d This politicized\u2014rather than securitized\u2014perception of AMR is what allows policy space for competing health or economic agendas to be advanced at the lower tiers.
