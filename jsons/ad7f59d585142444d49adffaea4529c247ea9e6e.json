We excluded studies that reported viral data as patient fraction, reported only baseline data, included 27 solely asymptomatic patients or were interventional studies. Extracted data included author, title, design, 28 sample size, thresholds and genes of RT-PCR, patient age, COVID-19 severity, clinical characteristics, 29 treatment, location of viral sampling, duration of viral detection, and viral load. We pooled the data of 30 selected studies to determine effect estimates of duration of viral detection. Combined viral load was 31 visualized over time. The objective of this paper is to provide a systematic review of the spatial and temporal viral dynamics of 77 SARS-CoV-2 in COVID-19 patients, stratified after clinical severity, location of viral sampling and age, 78 based on individual patient data. The data of the systematic review is then aggregated to report a weighted 79 mean of duration of viral detection, per sampling location for adults and children with mild and moderate-80 severe symptoms. 81",

However, in some studies the sampling frequency was not daily, meaning that the 102 last positive test does not equal Day -1 of first negative test. Therefore, we also reported the duration of viral 103 detection until the last positive swab, to not introduce any predictions into the summary measures. In the 104 case that the day of the positive test was not reported for a patient, we excluded this patient in the overall 105 summary measure, as the duration of viral detection becomes predictive. Also, in case a positive test was 106 not reported, we could not be sure that this patient was tested at all positive for the virus at the specific 107 sampling location. Furthermore, for patients that did not clear the virus within the time frame of sampling, 108 we used the day of the last positive test as final day to not introduce bias into the data by excluding these 109 and leaving out patients that needed longer to clear the virus than the average. Finally, we also recorded the 110 duration of viral detection in case recurrence of positivity was observed, meaning a positive test was detected 111 after two negative ones have been obtained. To measure the duration in regard to the \"recurrence\" endpoint, 112 the final day was also set as Day -1 of the first negative test of two consecutive negative tests. 113",

First, different genes and 249 thresholds were used to assess negative conversion of SARS-CoV-2 hampering the direct comparison of 250 studies.

Third, studies that only reported fractions or median of duration 253 of viral shedding were excluded, which might introduce a selection bias into this review. Fourth, the viral 254 load was measured via RT-PCR, which cannot differentiate dead virus particle, and hence data presented 255 here might not necessarily reflect active viral replication. However, this technique is currently used 256 worldwide to measure the quantities of SARS-CoV-2. Fifth, a portion of the patients included in this review 257 (14 %) did not clear the virus in the time frame of sampling, hence the here presented data might be an 258 underestimation of the duration of virus detection.

These efforts are revealing clinical and molecular 65 characteristics of SARS-CoV-2 and the infection it causes 1 , but its viral dynamics and spatial shedding 66 patterns in humans remain poorly understood. A variety of case series and retrospectives studies, reporting 67 viral dynamics of SARS-CoV-2 on a patient or patient population level, have been published and illuminate 68 the spatial patterns of SARS-CoV-2's shedding in different stages of the infection. 1 However, these studies 69 are heterogeneous with regards to patient populations and the specific viral load testing. To provide an 70 overview of our current knowledge of the shedding patterns of SARS-CoV-2, we conducted a review of the 71 temporal and spatial viral dynamics across clinical severities of COVID-19. Firstly, this knowledge can help 72 improve mathematical models of SARS-CoV-2's replication, as the numerical model can be trained with 73 more real-world data. Secondly, this knowledge can inform the definition of relevant endpoints in clinical 74 trials assessing pharmacological treatments aimed at reducing viral load in patients positive for SARS-",
