Economic theories have modelled the causes and consequences of price wars. The conventional reason advanced for the outbreak of a price war is the breakdown of collusion. As collusion is an illegal activity in many countries, it is not easy to thoroughly document such behaviour. It is also hard to determine when a price war actually starts, and how and when it comes to an end, and for what reasons.",

In one period, passengers enjoy very low prices, while in another they have to pay prices close to the full published fares, with little or no discount being available. The absence of an effective antitrust law means that such collusive behaviour faces no threat of prosecution, as long as the airfare is not more than the published full fare. However, in the years since price deregulation, for most of the time passengers have enjoyed lower fares than before, thanks to fierce competition among airlines.",

More frequently, the price agreements collapse and surprisingly low prices ensue. Price wars could be discovered in almost all city-pair markets, and led to the consolidation of the state-owned trunk airlines in October 2002. One of the main aims of these amalgamations, as seen by the General Administration of Civil Aviation of China (CAAC) and the relevant merging parties, was to reduce unnecessarily destructive competition and produce a more \u201corderly\u201d market (see Zhang and Round (2008) for more details).",

For example, Youth Times (2004) reports that Air China offered an 80% discount, or 350 yuan (US$44) fare from 15 to 16 December 2004 on the Shenzhen\u2013Beijing route, whereas previously the discount offered was only 30% at most, and the fare was rarely less than 1000 yuan (US$125). China Southern and Shenzhen Airlines matched this low price a few hours later and all flights in the following days were soon fully booked. However, this short price war ended days later after an \u201cemergency meeting\u201d between the sales managers of China Southern and Air China. All airlines' prices rose to around 50% (875 yuan or US$109) of the normal price on 19 December 2004. This pattern of behaviour has been repeated on many city-pair routes from time to time in China.",

Although there have been a small number of empirical studies on airfare wars which will be reviewed below, research with convincing evidence into collusive activities remains sparse due to the illegal nature of collusion and the unavailability of data for the airline industry. What differentiates our study from previous studies are its unique data sets and our accessibility to airline staff to obtain first-hand opinions on our results and to discover information that cannot be revealed by the data alone. Accordingly, this paper seeks to discover the patterns of price wars and collusion in China's airline markets, and to estimate the conditions that facilitate the two phenomena. In the next section, we will briefly mention the theoretical models relevant to collusion and price wars. From a review of the empirical literature on airline collusion and price wars, we will discuss the identification of price wars and price collusion in Section 3. Section 3 also provides the data and model specification using the factors expected to contribute to these two types of extreme pricing behaviour. Section 4 will analyse the results, and conclusions will be drawn in Section 5.",

Most of the game theoretical works have modelled the effect of a change in demand on the breakdown of a cartel. Porter's (1983) analysis of the Joint Executive Committee (JEC) cartel contends that firms with imperfect monitoring can only observe their own output and industry-wide price collusion. The trigger price might be activated by an unexpected low demand shock or by cheating. Either could result in a period of punishment in which each firm produces at Cournot\u2013Nash levels and then resumes a collusive phase. The periodical price wars are a result of the firms' inability to perfectly monitor all the other members' behaviour, and are an information cost that a cartel must bear. Price wars here should not be seen as the end of the cartel, but rather they help the cartel to regain stability. In this model, price wars are thought to be more likely to happen during economic downturns. Ellison (1994) re-examined the JEC cartel and provided further findings in support of the Green and Porter theory.",

If the cartel could flexibly adjust the agreed-upon price in response to increased demand (by lowering prices in booms), cheating would not happen and the cartel would not break down. Therefore, price collusion never breaks down, but we can still observe fluctuations in cartel prices. This model provides a situation where a competitive outcome occurs in an expanding economy. The JEC case was also considered by the authors who concluded that price wars occurred in winter periods when the Great Lakes were frozen and in the years when grain production was high.",

To attract consumers, a new entrant will provoke a price war by providing a lower price to temporarily compensate consumers for their switching costs. Alternatively, a lower price can be seen as an attempt to influence consumers' expectations, persuading them to switch to an alternative firm by giving up their current preference. Once an entrant has locked in its new consumers, the price war ends and normal prices resume. Unfortunately for our study, there is not a sufficient number of new entrants in the data sets, and so it is impossible to examine systematically the effects of entry or entry deterrence on pricing.",

Multimarket contacts give firms familiarity with the strategies of their rivals and facilitate their tacit coordination and mutual understanding (Scott, 1993, Baum and Korn, 1996). One of the notable theoretical works on multimarket contact by Bernheim and Whinston (1990) supports the view that mutual forbearance might exist among firms with multimarket contacts. Evans and Kessides, 1994, Singal, 1996 find consistent empirical evidence that endorses the mutual forbearance hypothesis as being relevant to the airline industry. However, other empirical studies report contrary results. Morrison and Winston, 1996, Sandler, 1988 find that higher multimarket contact leads to intense price competition in the US airline market.",

Therefore, price wars are more likely to happen in periods of low demand. An opposing theory, which argues that price wars could happen in an expanding economy owing to the lure of high benefits from cheating compared with the possible costs of punishment, supports a countercyclical pricing pattern (Rotemberg and Saloner, 1986). Suslow (2005) investigated the stability of cartels by looking at 71 international cartel agreements covering 45 industries during the period 1920\u201339 in Europe when cartel agreements were legal (these European countries did not have antitrust legislation before World War II), and found that a cartel is more likely to fall apart during economic downturns and in the presence of economic volatility. It seems that frequent macroeconomic fluctuations increase the possibility of the collapse of a cartel (Carlton and Perloff, 2005).",

Therefore, once an airline significantly cuts the price on a particular route, almost all the airlines that operate on that route will match the price and get involved.

If one of the members was not happy with the outcome of an agreement, collusion could quickly break down because of the lack of an effective enforcement mechanism, but it was easy enough to form another one soon thereafter.

Our data indicate that there was a slight increase in the duration of collusive agreements in 2004. Our interviews suggested that in 2005 on a small number of routes, the agreements using such approach were quite successful. However, given that any collusive contract could not cover all the aspects of the participants' interests and that the outside conditions on a particular route changed from time to time, it was the norm for agreements to collapse frequently, followed by a new one formed soon after the price wars, with new additional conditions to suit each individual airline's needs.",

Although not entirely comparable, the negative sign in the price-war model for China Southern gives some support to the view of Green and Porter that a price war is more likely to erupt when demand is low.15\nAlso, the collusion model (China Southern) shows that successful collusion is less likely to be maintained in a market where demand is high. This seems to be consistent with the conclusion in Rotemberg and Saloner (1986) that collusion is hard to maintain in booms. The results of the passenger variable suggest that both price wars and price collusion could happen in a low demand period or in a market where air travel demand is relatively low.

Compared with the shoulder season in June, peak seasons such as January (before the Chinese New Year) and April (before the week-long holiday for Labour Day) in all the models show that an inference can be made about a strong tendency towards collusion and less likelihood of a price war. Our interviews suggest that the airlines are well aware of the times of peak and low seasons. The incentive to coordinate pricing during high seasons is stronger as they believe that the profits in this period can cover the losses in the low seasons. Therefore, it was common practice for the sales managers to meet before the advent of the peak season to form an agreement, as they understood that if they lost peak time revenues, they would suffer losses for the whole year, Therefore, most of airlines observed the agreements quite closely when demand was high, even though this sometimes meant that the flights were not full.16\nThis again supports the view of Green and Porter (1984). However, coefficients on the SARS dummy suggest that when air travel demand was extremely low, the probability of collusion significantly increased for both China Eastern and China Southern. As a result, the likelihood of price wars occurring was reduced. This seems to be consistent with the rationale presented in Rotemberg and Saloner (1986).",

The presence of China Eastern on China Southern's routes increased the likelihood of both price wars and price collusion at the 10% and 5% significance levels respectively, indicating that these two airlines, of similar size, fought against one another fiercely in one period and cooperated in harmony in another period, or competed on some routes and colluded on others. Table 3 also shows that the presence of China Southern in China Eastern's markets could intensify competition between the two carriers.",

It is possible that that markets associated with these cities are crucial to the airlines involved in terms of generating large amounts of revenue, and therefore it is in every player's interest to keep airfares in these markets as high and stable as possible through collusion.

China Southern's price-war model shows that longer routes were more likely to experience price wars. One possible reason could be that relatively low personal disposable income in many areas of China constrains the use of air transport for long-distance travel (in fact, for the vast majority of the population, travel by train is the first choice, especially when long-distance travel is very expensive). An additional possible reason is that longer routes are usually associated with a route involving a rival's hub airport, and thus competition tends to be strong. In contrast, shorter routes are usually within an airline's sphere of influence and a certain degree of market power could be exercised. The sign of the distance variable is also positive in China Eastern's price-war model, but it is not statistically significant. For collusion models, the distance variable did not have a significant effect.",

For China Eastern, an increase in departure airport HHI, on the one hand, increased the likelihood of price wars (at the 10% significance level). On the other hand, it also increased the likelihood of a successful price agreement (at the 1% significance level). These findings once again are not conflicting. Rather, it is very likely that when there is a price war, price collusion follows in the same market. The market share at the departure airport seems to have no significant impact on the price wars and collusion. Although economic theory suggests that collusion is more likely to occur in concentrated markets, we have not generally found this result in all the models we have estimated. This is consistent with the survey conducted by Levenstein and Suslow (2006) who conclude that there is no simple relationship between industry concentration and the likelihood of collusion. However, we cannot exclude the possibility that firms in China's concentrated airline markets had the ability to alleviate price fluctuations, or to collude with a moderate pricing strategy, and perhaps on other competitive variables such as flight schedules and capacity that cannot be captured by our price-war and collusion models.",

This variable, however, indicates that China Southern was more likely to get involved in a price war at the 5% significance level. This contradicts the traditional mutual forbearance hypothesis, but is consistent with the findings of Morrison and Winston (1996). They give the explanation that although multimarket contact might facilitate carrier cooperation that reduces the chance of price wars, it can also facilitate the spread of price wars once the cooperation breaks down. This might also be true in China's airline market. As well, owing to the strong rivalry in China's airline markets, explicit price-fixing agreements generally could not be expected to last long, let alone any implicit collusion implied by mutual forbearance. In addition, airline pricing decisions are generally made locally. A successful and stable collusion is largely dependent on the negotiation skills of the local sales managers as noted earlier, and these will reflect each individual's self-interest. Under these circumstances, mutual forbearance or implicit collusion across the board is quite difficult to achieve.",

To the best of our knowledge, this paper is the first academic paper that documents price wars and collusion in China's airline markets, which many Chinese consumers have experienced and observed. By using monthly fare data to study the period from 2002 to 2004, during which airline consolidations eliminated many trunk and local airlines, it has been found that the occurrence of price wars was not tempered by the mergers. Fare wars occurred periodically across routes, but price collusion was still prevalent.17\nHowever, both tended to be short-lived. Our interview information obtained from airline staff reveals the importance of changes in demand in inducing or promoting collusion in China. Although it is almost certain that airlines tended to engage in collusion when demand was high, there is also evidence from our price-war and collusion models which suggests that collusion could happen during low demand periods.",

For example, high airport concentration measured by HHI may facilitate collusion in certain circumstances, but it may also lead to more price wars under other conditions. The rejection of the existence of mutual forbearance owing to multimarket contact demonstrates that in dealing with airline merger cases, at least in China, there seems to be no major need to attach too much attention to the potential anticompetitive impacts of this variable, in contrast to previous claims made by many economists. It is, therefore, hard to generalise a set of factors that facilitate price wars or collusion as people might like to see. This reflects the nature of oligopolistic interdependence where any outcome could be possible, as reflected by numerous theoretical game models using different assumptions about firm behaviour and responses to rivals' strategies. Therefore, it is recommended that caution is needed in approving or rejecting proposed mergers, at least in China's airline industry, especially if using a \u201cchecklist\u201d of the factors (for example, the factors listed in the Australian Merger Guidelines18\n) thought to be necessary to consider assessing the anticompetitive effects of a proposed merger.",

However, our study also shows that a small number of markets had consistently higher prices for a relatively long time. Stable collusion may exist in a few markets that are vital to profits of the relevant airlines. More dangerously, if the skills of cooperative negotiations improve, and if efficient enforcement mechanisms can be developed, price agreements could become long-lived. China thus needs an operationally effective modern antitrust law in order to develop a culture for competition, and to ban any implicit and explicit collusion between rival firms throughout the economy.",
