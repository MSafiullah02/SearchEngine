Namely, these results show that IgA immunity can be accurately detected one week after the RT-PCR positivity while IgG immunity has to be assessed after two weeks to avoid false negative results. Secondly, adapted cut-offs have to be established by each laboratory in order to improve the sensitivity of the commercial assays. However, this implies that the sera selected to define the adapted cut-off is crucial. In our case, the cut-off was determined on samples from symptomatic patients collected 14 days after the positive RT-PCR. Of note, there is to date no consensus on how to define the disease onset, i.e. date of first COVID-19 symptoms or date of RT-PCR.",

This further complexifies the interpretation of the results and highlights the need for competent national authorities and learned societies to establish guidance and procedures for serological testing to avoid misinterpretation of too early determination, leading to a high rate of false negative results.",
