Create accessible e-calendar for overview and procedures to keep them updated. o Logistical staff: procuring adequate storage for in situ equipment, organising the laundry of simulation clothing. o Media and communications department: help to promote or advertise simulation activity, both for staff and the public: \"We train for your safety.\" Table 4 Practical considerations for the conduct of simulation sessions General aspects", "cite_spans": [{"start": 683, "end": 686, "text": "[5]", "ref_id": "BIBREF4"}], "ref_spans": [{"start": 321, "end": 328, "text": "Table 3", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1452, "end": 1459, "text": "Table 4", "ref_id": null}], "section": "Conclusion"}, {"text": "\u2022 Comply with limitations of bringing people into the same physical location in the current situation.
