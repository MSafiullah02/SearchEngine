            "text": "The recently identified novel SARS-CoV-2 virus has caused an outbreak of the underlying disease, COVID-19, which has continued to spread rapidly throughout China and around the world. As of April 6, 2020, a total of 1,174,866 COVID-19 cases and 64,541-related deaths were reported in 209 countries, areas, or territories spanning six continents, with 83,071 cases and 3,340 deaths reported in China alone. There is currently no effective vaccine or antiviral medication available for SARS-CoV-2. In addition, the case-fatality (i.e., COVID-19-related mortality) rate varies widely among epicenters and counties, even at the global level (Figure 1). To reduce the overall mortality rate, identifying risk factors associated with disease severity and poor outcome among COVID-19 patients is urgently needed. Therefore, COVID-19 patients who present with a comorbid condition may have an increased risk of deterioration and should therefore be admitted to a designated unit for close monitoring in accordance with the WHO guidelines for screening and triage [1]. Importantly, the ability to accurately evaluate risk factors associated with poor prognosis among SARS-CoV-2-infected patients is essential for early intervention in order to improve these patients' prognosis. At the same time, identifying patients who are at risk of developing severe disease could help healthcare providers allocate their limited care resources more effectively in SARS-CoV-2-infected communities.",

After removing duplicate publications, excluding articles based on the abstract, and screening the remaining articles by reading the full-text publication, a total of 34 studies were included in our final analysis (Figure 2), with a total of 6,263 COVID-19 cases, including 1,727 and 4,536 severe and nonsevere patients, respectively (Table 1). We then extracted data regarding the outcomes of interest from the studies, and the pooled results were analyzed using a random-effects model. Specifically, we analyzed the effect of various preexisting chronic diseases on the risk of developing severe COVID-19, as well as the clinical characteristics of organ injury in patients with severe COVID-19.",

[6] previously suggested that preexisting heart disease could be a potential risk factor for SARS-CoV-2-infected patients being admitted to the ICU. To test this, we performed a meta-analysis in order to investigate whether cardiovascular disease (CVD) and/or hypertension is significantly associated with increased disease severity in SARS-CoV-2-infected patients. Our analysis revealed that compared to COVID-19 patients with no preexisting chronic cardiovascular condition, COVID-19 patients who present with either hypertension or CVD have an approximately 3-4-fold higher risk of developing severe disease, with an odds ratio (OR) of 2.92 (95% CI: 2.35, 3.64) and 3.84 (95% CI: 2.90, 5.07), respectively (Figure 3). In addition, our analysis revealed moderate and low heterogeneity among the included studies with respect to hypertension (I2 = 45.2%) and CVD (I2 = 3.5%). Based on these results, we suggest that COVID-19 patients who present with a history of hypertension and/or heart disease should be carefully monitored and managed.",

We therefore systematically examined the correlation between ACI and COVID-19 severity. The epidemiological characteristics of cardiac injury in COVID-19 patients were extracted and are summarized in Table 2. The first report of ACI in patients infected with SARS-CoV-2 was a retrospective study by Huang et al. based on a report from Jinyintan Hospital in Wuhan, China [5], which included 41 laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 cases; five of these 41 patients (12%) had ACI, and four of these five patients (80%) were admitted to the ICU. In addition, Wang et al. studied an additional 138 COVID-19 patients in Wuhan, China, and found that 10 patients (7.2%) were diagnosed with virus-related ACI [6]. Wang et al. also found that COVID-19 patients admitted to the ICU were more likely to have cardiac complications (22.2%) compared to patients who were not admitted to the ICU (2.0%) [6]. Zhang et al. reported that 29.1% of severe COVID-19 patients in Zhongnan Hospital at Wuhan University had ACI [10]. Yang et al. treated 52 critically ill adults with SARS-CoV-2 infection in the ICU at Jinyintan Hospital, 32 of whom (61.5%) died during treatment [9]. They found that 12 of the 52 patients (23%) had myocardial injury, indicating that patients with this condition have a higher risk of death; moreover, a closer analysis revealed that nonsurviving patients had a nearly 2-fold higher risk of developing ACI compared to surviving patients [9]. Recently, a relatively large epidemiology survey found a strong association between ACI and COVID-19-related mortality [12].",

Xu et al. found that intubated COVID-19 patients had a much higher risk of developing ACI compared to nonintubated patients in the ICU [11]. Wu et al. also analyzed ACI-related markers, including TnI, creatine kinase-MB, lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), and \u03b1-hydroxybutyrate dehydrogenase, and found that COVID-19 patients who were admitted with increased serum levels of these markers had significantly higher overall mortality rates and shorter survival [8]. Thus, COVID-19 patients who develop signs of ACI should be identified as early as possible, and cardiovascular specialists should be consulted in order to minimize the risk of heart damage-related mortality.",

In addition, Zhou et al. reported that 15% of SARS-CoV-2-infected patients had AKI, compared to 50% in nonsurviving patients [12]. Similarly, Diao et al. reported that 27% of COVID-19 patients (23 out of 85) presented with AKI [21]. Overall, nearly 9.4% of critically ill patients admitted to the ICU with SARS-CoV-2 (55 out of 585 patients) had AKI; these results are summarized in Table 3.",

This conclusion was based on three separate lines of evidence. First, our meta-analysis revealed no significant correlation between CLD and severe COVID-19, with an overall OR of 0.86 (95% CI: 0.42, 1.75) and low heterogeneity (I2 = 0.0%) (Figure 5). Second, we found that the majority of COVID-19 patients with CLD did not require admittance to the ICU, suggesting a less severe disease course in this subset of patients. Consistent with this finding, Chen et al. reported that 13 out of 15 patients (86.7%) with both COVID-19 and CLD did not have severe disease [3]. Third, we found that many clinical reports regarding COVID-19 provided little or no information with respect to CLD. For example, in a large cohort study involving 1,099 patients with COVID-19, only 23 patients (2.1%) had hepatitis B [13]. Nevertheless, given the small number of patients with preexisting CLD analyzed, the effect of CLD on COVID-19 severity requires further study.",

Moreover, given the genetic and clinical similarities between the novel SARS-CoV-2 virus and the original SARS-CoV virus [5, 25], it is reasonable to speculate that ALI may also affect the severity of COVID-19. Indeed, Yao et al. reported that the incidence of ALI among severe COVID-19 patients is considerably higher compared to patients with moderate COVID-19 (77.3% vs. 27.8%, respectively) [26]. As summarized in Table 4, both AST and ALT levels were significantly higher in patients who had severe COVID-19 and/or were admitted to the ICU compared to patients who had moderate COVID-19 and were not admitted to the ICU. Strikingly, Guan et al. [13] examined a large set of laboratory data and found increased AST and increased ALT levels in 39.4% and 28.1%, respectively, of patients with severe COVID-19, compared to 18.2% and 19.8%, respectively, of patients with nonsevere COVID-19. However, it remains inconclusive with respect to whether ALI affects the mortality of COVID-19 patients. Yang et al. reported that the rate of liver dysfunction among 32 nonsurvivors and 20 survivors with severe COVID-19 disease was comparable, 28% and 30%, respectively [9]. Whereas in Cao et al.'s study, there was a significant difference (P < 0.001) in the rate of ALI, 76.5% (13 out of 17) in nonsurvivors and 24.7% (21 out of 85) in survivors [27]. Given the small number of patients in both studies, the effect of ALI on COVID-19 mortality requires further study.",

As shown in Figure 6, our analysis revealed that patients who present with diabetes have a significantly increased risk (OR: 2.61; 95% CI: 2.05, 3.33) of developing severe COVID-19 compared to nondiabetic patients, with moderate study heterogeneity (I2 = 39.2%).

The same authors also found that during the course of a SARS infection, the patients' fasting plasma glucose levels were inversely correlated with arterial oxygenation (SaO2) and directly correlated with mortality and hypoxia [29]. Moreover, a meta-analysis of Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) studies by Badawi and Ryoo revealed that 51% (95% CI: 36%, 66%) of severe MERS-CoV-infected patients had diabetes [30], and a meta-analysis by Matsuyama et al. found that preexisting diabetes was associated with an increased risk of developing severe MERS-CoV-related complications (OR: 1.8; 95% CI: 1.5, 2.1) [31].",

Ding et al. [39] systematically examined the presence of SARS-CoV in tissues of deceased SARS patients using immunohistochemistry and in situ hybridization; the authors found that SARS-CoV was present in the lungs, small intestine, kidneys, liver, pancreas, cerebrum, and other tissues, indicating that ACE2-expressing organs may serve as direct targets of SARS-CoV. Furthermore, SARS-CoV uses the ACE2 protein for cellular entry [40\u201342] and uses the cellular serine protease TMPRSS2 for viral spike protein priming [43\u201345]. A recent study confirmed that the closely related SARS-CoV-2 also uses both ACE2 and TMPRSS2 [46]. It is reported that the coding region variants and eQTL variants for ACE2 might also contribute to differential susceptibility or response to SARS-CoV-2 [47]. In addition, other proteins such as CD147 may also be employed by both SARS-CoV [48] and SARS-CoV-2 [49] during virus transmission. Nevertheless, it is noted that a subset of previously healthy and even relatively young COVID-19 patients has been killed by SARS-CoV-2, suggesting that the patients' genomes for DNA variations might have an impact on the disease severity and mortality [50, 51].",

Importantly, ACE2 is expressed throughout the lungs but is also expressed in the cardiovascular system, where it has direct effects on cardiac function [58].

Further support comes from a report by Zhang et al. that 54% of COVID-19 patients had increased levels of gamma-glutamyl transferase, a diagnostic biomarker for cholangiocyte damage [70]. A second possible mechanism is that ALI in COVID-19 patients may result from a dysregulated inflammatory response, possibly including excessive activation of immune cells and subsequent inflammatory cytokine storm [71].

Second, several chronic comorbidities, including hypertension, CVD, CKD, and diabetes, may render the affected organs and tissues susceptible to virus infection via an impaired immune response [74]. Third, certain antiviral drugs such as chloroquine [62], ribavirin [63, 68], and lopinavir/ritonavir [67] have side effects that can include organ damage. Fourth, acute respiratory distress syndrome- (ARDS-) induced hypoxia can promote damage in organs outside of the respiratory system [64, 75]. Finally, secondary infection by other pathogens may contribute to acute organ damage [5].",

Firstly, studies included in this study primarily used retrospective cohorts, which are limited in their ability to infer definitive causality. Most recently, scientists and clinicians across the globe have responded to the ongoing coronavirus pandemic with a huge, high-quality global research effort to find a treatment for COVID-19. Secondly, nineteen out of thirty-four studies included in the meta-analysis were from preprint manuscripts, which are not peer reviewed. Thirdly, to ensure feasibility of this study, eligibility criteria were that data on COVID-19 patients were available in the published reports of the studies. It is noted that all included original clinical cohort studies were performed in China. More studies with broad geographic areas are likely to evolve over time, which may help to cross-validate the findings.",
