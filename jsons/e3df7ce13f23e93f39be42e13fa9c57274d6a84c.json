            "text": "Biosensors: analytical devices used for detection and/or measurement of specific analyte, biometric parameters, and body conditions. Caspases: a family of intracellular cysteine-aspartic proteases that are pivotal in programmed cell death, such as apoptosis, pyroptosis, and necrosis. Compound annual growth rate (CAGR): rate of return required for an investment to grow from its beginning balance to its ending balance, assuming the profits are reinvested at the end of each year of the investment's lifespan. Energy transfer (ET) based: systems in which ET can occur from an electronically excited state of a donor to an acceptor. In biosensors the efficiency of this process can be influenced by a target analyte, thus signaling its presence by means of a spectroscopic observable (emission, intensity or lifetime). Logic gate: a device that performs logical operations to convert the signal from the sensor to a binary output (0 or 1). Logic gates based on proteolytic activity operate by differentiating 'low-activity' from 'high-activity' states and further address them as 0 and 1, respectively. Matrix metalloproteases (MMPs): metal-dependent endopeptidases found in the extracellular matrix, which are responsible for degrading several proteins and bioactive products. Multiplex-modality systems: combine two or more complementary techniques that enable imaging of metabolic processes, such as proteolytic activity, with increased resolution compared with their individual counterparts. Personalized medicine: a new paradigm in medicine that views patients not as members of a group, but rather as unique individuals with intrinsic characteristics that must be diagnosed, evaluated, and used to inform therapeutic decisions. Photothermal therapy (PTT): uses electromagnetic radiationcommonly IR wavelengthswhich is absorbed by a molecule/particle (photosensitizer). This activation brings the sensitizer to an excited state further releasing heat. The resulting heat increases the temperature locally, killing the targeted cells. Here, the interaction between two or more entities is distance dependent; thus, the signal detected by the sensor is strictly dependent on the distance. In proteolytic sensors, molecular-rulers operate to differentiate the signal proteases as drug targets or as biomarkers for diagnosis and prognosis. In this regard, thrombin and prostate-specific antigen (PSA) can be highlighted as two of the most common protease targets in clinical biochemistry [9, 10] . And, one notable example of a protease-targeted therapy is the administration of HIV-1 protease inhibitors (i.e., lopinavir/ritonavir branded as Kaletra from Abbott Laboratories) in the context of AIDS [11] . Lopinavir is a specific inhibitor of HIV proteases, which prevents maturation of the virus, hindering its ability to infect new cells and replicate. However, lopinavir is quickly degraded within the human body by cytochrome P450 3A4 enzyme (CYP3A4) [12] . To overcome this and increase the lifetime of lopinavir, a potent CYP3A4 inhibitor (ritonavir) is included in the formulation. During the preparation of this manuscript (March 27, 2020), the world is facing an unprecedented pandemic due to the outbreak of the coronavirus disease, COVID-19, caused by the virus SARS-CoV-2. Similar to HIV, proteases are pivotal during viral maturation, affecting the ability of the virus to infect new host cells [13] . Likewise, protease-targeted therapies with protease inhibitors are one of the forefront strategies being pursued to fight the outbreak. Several drugs are undergoing testing and clinical trials (https://www. sciencemag.org/news/2020/03/who-launches-global-megatrial-four-most-promising-coronavirus-treatments#), with mild results [14, 15] , notably lopinavir/ritonavir and arbidol (https:// clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT04252885). In this regard, the ability to monitor proteolytic activity in real-time can play a pivotal role in screening potential protease inhibitors for therapeutic purposes [16] . The spread of COVID-19 caught most countries off-guard, with their health-care systems being unable to restrain transmission before adequate testing to allow controlled isolation and tracking [17] . This may due to the fact that the 'gold-standard' RT-PCR test is time-consuming and expensive, among other limitations (https://www.fda.gov/media/136151/download; https://www.iaea.org/newscenter/news/how-is-the-covid-19-virus-detected-using-real-time-rtpcr). Alternative, less expensive and easier to use serological tests also have limitations [17] . Both tests may also provide non-definitive results (https://www.politico.eu/article/spanishgovernment-under-fire-after-defective-testing-kits-fiasco). Although to our knowledge diagnosis of viral infections by proteolytic activity monitoring is unavailable in health care, experimental studies on viral proteolytic maturation should clarify the potential of proteases as drug targets and as diagnostic tools [18] .",

            "text": "In view of its biological and therapeutic relevance, understanding and evaluation of proteolytic activity, both in vitro and in vivo, is extremely informative. However, determining protease concentration in serum, tissues, and other samples without correlation with its activity can give limited or erroneous information due to particular features of these enzymes, as described below. Despite the disadvantages of measuring protease concentration instead of proteolytic activity, this is still performed due to the simple adaptation of gold-standard procedures to these enzymes. The presence of proteases is usually established indirectly by measuring genetic expression via RNA quantification or by using immunoassays. A good example of this approach is the use of reverse transcription PCR (RT-PCR) to infer the presence of matrix metalloproteases (MMPs) in rheumatoid arthritis [19] . However, in these studies immunosensing and mRNA quantification can be misleading because proteases are naturally synthetized in an inactive pro-form, which is activated post-expression. Unfortunately, most immunoassays cannot distinguish between the two forms and the detection of mRNA cannot be taken as a guarantee of the presence of proteolytic activity. Additionally, enzymes are sensitive to disease-related environmental conditions (e.g., pH is often lower in cancerous cells) and thus genetic expression does not necessarily the particle's material, size, and geometry and interparticle distances. Positron emission tomography (PET): a nuclear medical imaging technique based on the detection of radioactivity emitted by a radioactive tracer delivered to an individual to monitor physiological functions. Programmable medicine: current medical practice, based on analysis of the symptomatology and medical examination results. Programmable medicine does not consider the phenotypic and genotypic characterization, sociodemographic and environmental factors, or lifestyle of an individual and does not include disease preventive strategies. Real-time proteolytic assays: (in the authors' definition) assays that have an immediate response that is proportional to proteolytic activity and can be rapidly read by a sensor, but not necessarily as a continuous measurement. Signal-to-noise ratio (SNR): defined as the ratio between the intensity of a specific signal generated during the measurement and the intensity or standard deviation of a signal generated from unspecific sources (noise). A high SNR corresponds to a bigger difference between the signal generated from an occurring event and the background noise, increasing the confidence/ sensitivity. Suicidal experiments: experiments that can be used only once to determine a specific parameter at a given time. Therefore, an experiment needs to be done for each desired time point.",

Also, proteases are characterized by a high catalytic constant (10 8 -10 9 M \u22121 s \u22121 ), which means that even a very small variation in genetic expression can have a major outcome difference. Finally, these enzymes are often regulated by endogenous inhibitors, such as tissue inhibitors of metalloproteinase (TIMPs), which are responsible for restraining the activity of MMPs, and a disintegrin and metalloproteinases (ADAMs) within the homeostatic range [22] . For the reasons mentioned above, concentration is not always correlated with activity. Alternatively, by measuring the proteolytic activity one is directly evaluating the function of the protease at physiological conditions and not merely its presence. This creates several opportunities, as described next.",

Changing the paradigm to real-time detection, where the sensor gives an immediate response proportional to the proteolytic activity, would be extremely interesting in drug development, fundamental studies, and healthcare. From the perspective of the development of protease-targeted drugs/therapies, measuring enzyme kinetics over time using the same sample and without the need for suicidal experiments decreases the number of assays needed for each test [31] . Usually, proteases and pharmaceutical compounds, especially those of clinical relevance, can be expensive and, by decreasing the number of performed tests, the development costs can diminish significantly. Additionally, in assays that determine the concentration of a given analyte, usually one molecule produces one output signal. When measuring enzyme activity, however, a single enzyme can be responsible for multiple events of substrate cleavage thus leading to multiple readout signals, which ultimately produce signal amplification with a concomitant increase of the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR).",

The distance between the two components should change only due to the proteolytic activity of the target proteaseas result of cleavage of the target sequencethus producing a signal readout, while in control samples this bridging sequence remains intact and, in this case, no readout is produced. Other real-time sensors, by contrast, explore the fact that the cleavage of the original protein target generates smaller fragments and often induces a change in a given property (impedance, diffusion), which will influence the sensor readings proportionally to the proteolytic activity ( Figure 1C ).",

In most designs, ET occurs through long-range dipole-dipole interactions [F\u00f6rster mechanism or FRET], in which one entity works as an energy donor and another as an energy acceptor. Herein, the fluorophore properties critically affect the detection limit and the dynamic range of the method; a good fluorophore should possess a high molar absorption coefficient, high quantum yield (QY), chemical and photochemical stability, and, ideally, no or low toxicity [33] . The advantage of organic fluorophores is illustrated by the fact that tailormade proteolytic sensors using cyanine and Atto dyes are commercially available [34] . Furthermore, being molecular-sized entities, these organic dye labels exhibit almost no steric effects, which can be critical in enzymatic assays. Despite these advantages, organic fluorophores, especially near-IR (NIR) dyes, have limiting photophysical properties, such as photobleaching and low QY, which hampers their potential for in vivo applications [34] .",

For example, Jeong et al. developed a QD-based ET biosensor in the second NIR region to determine the proteolytic activities of MMP-2 and -9 in real time ( Figure 2A ) [35] . In this work, a multifunctional peptide was used to bridge a QD to an acceptor that quenches its emission in the absence of MMPs. On breaking the peptide bond, the acceptor is released and the donor brightness increases proportionally to the presence of the active protease. Compared with other NIR dyes, this QD-based sensor displayed better performance for in-depth in vivo imaging. Despite these improvements, the application of QDs in these systems can still be hindered by toxicity, photoblinking phenomena, and size-related issues.",

[36] to detect Caspase-3 and -7 inside cells using an adenocarcinoma (SW 620) cell line. In their design, the authors used a crown nanoparticle assembly comprising a core 40-nm plasmonic gold particle coupled to several gold nanoparticles by a target sequence for caspase detection ( Figure 2B ). Using this plasmon ruler, the authors were able to optically probe caspase activity by measuring the scattered light from the nanoassembly and to follow cell-signaling pathways in vivo at a single-molecule level during a period of over 2 h (continuous measuring). The crown nanoassemblies were crucial to obtain a good SNR in such a highly scattering environment, because two or more particles display a scattering signal 44\u00d7 greater than individual particles. Additionally, the nanoassembly was functionalized with a cell-penetrating peptide (TAT) allowing intracellular/cytosolic sensing of Caspase-3 and -7 activity in real time. The movement of the particles was minimal during experiments due to constriction from the network of cytoskeleton filaments, although after cleavage the resulting particles were able to freely diffuse away from the region of interest. This system proved to be a powerful tool to determine single proteolytic events in real time inside living cells and allowed the researchers to characterize biochemical parameters, such as time lag, and to determine cell heterogeneity in the same sample. The main disadvantage of the strategy appeared to be the difficulty in preparing the nanocrown systems and their inherent heterogeneity.",

Succinctly, tumor margins are determined using fluorescence imaging activated by the proteolytic activity of MMP-2. After cleavage from MMP-2, a ligand (cRGD) becomes accessible and leads to preferential accumulation and internalization of T-MAN on tumor cells.

In this design, the peptide substrate that crosses the nanopore-containing membrane produces only one major type of current modulation event. When the target protease is present or active, however, the substrate is cleaved in two differently sized fragments, producing two new types of blockage events with smaller residence times and/or amplitudes relative to the original substrate. Given the high sensitivity of the method and its potential to discriminate the target protease from false positives, this strategy is potentially useful in diagnosis, prognosis, and the development of drugs. The major disadvantage of nanopore systems is that these are not suitable to be used in vivo and in complex media.",

[49] developed an on-chip dual-sensing device for the detection of cell-secreted MMP-9 that simultaneously monitors cellular resistance and correlates it with the secretome and morphological analysis. The device comprises two independent sensing platforms featuring interdigitated-array microelectrodes (IDAMs) in one common fluidic chamber ( Figure 3C ). The goal of the device is to detect MMP-9 activity and understand cellular behavior during motility. On migration, cells tend to change morphology by extending their shape (i.e., lamellipodium formation) [50] and that increases resistance to the flow of electrical current between electrodes. The faster cells extend, the higher the value of the electrical resistance measured. During the migration process, MMP-9 was simultaneously secreted and diffused upwards from the cell binding site [49] . The substrate peptides at the upper site were proteolytically cleaved, causing a change in electrode capacitance. We believe that this dual-sensing method is interesting since it affords high versatility and could be applicable to a wide range of cell-secreted proteases by choosing the appropriate target proteins or peptides. Despite not being suitable for in vivo studies, this approach could deliver promising insights on the relation between the cellular secretome and morphological analysis in real time; for example, in the context of bioengineering approaches used for cellular differentiation.

AVB-620 is a fluorescence-based sensor that is currently undergoing Phase III trials for breast cancer and entering Phase I trials for multiple cancers ( Figure 4 ) [54] . In this hairpin sensor design, two fluorophores (Cy-5 and Cy-7) are in close proximity due to electrostatic interactions between two oppositely charged domains of the sensor molecule, which are bridged by a specifically targeted peptide sequence. In the absence of tumorassociated enzymes such as MMP-2 and -9, the two fluorophores are close to each other, with Cy-5 acting as an energy donor to Cy-7, which then emits brightly. In the presence of MMP-2/9, the target sequence is cleaved and the two fluorophores are separated, leading to a decrease in Cy-7 emission that is dependent on the protease activity as detected by fluorescence cameras, allowing intraoperative imaging in real time. Additionally, the presence of an activated cell penetration peptide (positively charged) in the resulting Cy-5-containing peptide fragment allows the fluorophore to be internalized by nearby cells, precisely delimiting tumor margins. The system did not exhibit significant side effects and showed improved performance in defining tumor margins. If the AVB-620 sensor is able to pass through the whole validation process, it will potentially encourage the development of protease-based theranostic systems.",

New strategies for multiplexing can overcome the current limitations, increase diagnostic precision, and be helpful in correlating metabolic information between different enzymes.

Although these types of biosensors are already under development, we strongly believe that there are plenty of unexplored concepts that can arise in the future (see Outstanding Questions). We cannot predict the pathways that are going to be pursued henceforth in real-time proteolytic-activity biosensors. Nevertheless, we hope that platforms for general use and the accessibility of these sensors will accelerate protease-based research and intensively propel the field. Undoubtedly, optimized systems to monitor and control biological processes will play a role in improving healthcare and moving towards a better version of personalized medicine. ",
