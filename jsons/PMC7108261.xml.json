            "text": "Viral respiratory diseases are a major health problem. They affect people of all ages and exert a great economic impact on the health care system. The viruses most often associated with respiratory tract illness include influenza virus, parainfluenza virus, respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), adenovirus, rhinovirus and coronavirus. In 2001, Van den Hoogen and colleagues first reported the discovery of a new respiratory virus (human metapneumovirus, HMPV) in the Netherlands.1 Serological studies have revealed that virtually all children have been exposed to HMPV by the age of 5 years.1, 2, 3, 4, 5 Similar studies seem to support this hypothesis.6, 7, 8, 9, 10 However, in other case studies HMPV infections have been reported in the elderly11, 12, 13, 14 and immunocompromised individuals,15, 16, 17, 18, 19 which suggests that the virus is not strictly limited to infecting infants or children. Since its discovery, the occurrence of HMPV has been reported in many countries, such as Australia, Canada, Finland, United States, United Kingdom, Spain, Ireland, Israel and Japan. It is now thought to be prevalent worldwide, indicating that it is a common and ubiquitous human pathogen.20, 21, 22\n",

            "text": "To define the seroepidemiology of HMPV in an Irish population, we developed enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISAs) based on the expression of HMPV M and P proteins in E. coli and the recombinant HMPV N produced in Sf9 insect cells. A sero-epidemiological survey using these HMPV recombinant antigen-based ELISA systems was employed to determine the prevalence of antibodies to specific HMPV proteins in Ireland. The total antibody reactivity to HMPV M, P and N antigens correlated well, in particular there was significant correlation between the seroreactivity observed in both the M and N ELISA systems, (r\n = 0.96; Table 3). The correlation between the presence of HMPV antibodies determined by the M and P ELISAs was lower (r\n = 0.57) compared to the correlation between HMPV M and N ELISAs. Significant correlation was also observed between the N and P ELISAs (r\n = 0.74). The lack of correlation between the M and P protein-based ELISA systems may be due to variable levels of IgG to each recombinant antigen within the selected donor cohort. Ishiguro et al. tested for specific antibodies against nucleocapsid (N) and matrix (M) proteins in 97 sera by Western blot using recombinant N and M proteins of HMPV expressed in E. coli.33 The results were compared with those of immunofluorescence assays (IFAs) based on HMPV-infected LLC-MK2 cells, which expressed the whole HMPV proteome. Their results indicated that the antibodies against N and M proteins are highly specific (100%) but less sensitive (42.1%, N protein; 40.8%, M protein) than those against whole proteins of HMPV detected by IFA. This would also suggest that a multi-HMPV antigen ELISA would increase the sensitivity of the detection of HMPV antibodies within human sera. However, the lower detection of P antigen-specific IgG may be due to the relatively low percentage sequence identity between HPMV P (from the A2 genotype) and genotypes A1 B1/2, respectively.34 The HMPV genotype A2 proteins (M, P and N from ROI135) used in this study exhibited 97.2\u201398.8, 85\u201396.3, and 95.2\u201399.5% sequence identify to selected examples of genotypes A1 and B1/2, respectively (Table 4). Extensive validation of the HMPV ELISA systems described herein, whereby antigen coating on microtitre plates was optimised (2, 3 and 5 \u03bcg/ml for HMPV M, P and N, respectively) and assay reproducibility, in terms of % coefficient of variation, was determined to be 5.5, 8 and 8%, respectively, preclude sub-optimal assay performance as a reason for the observed differences in antibody detection. In summary, recombinant M, P and N proteins of HMPV were antigenic, and the responses to M, P, and N proteins differed across the study population. Assays based on multiple antigens provided higher sensitivities than assays based on single antigens.",

All individuals (n\n = 10) screened were HMPV IgG seropositive with the exception of one individual E10, who was seronegative for HMPV specific IgG (Fig. 4). Five individuals (E1, E2, E3, E8 and E9) exhibited low, but detectable (range: 1\u201314.6 SFC/million B cells) B cell memory. There was a significant correlation between the number of memory B cells directed against HMPV M and HMPV P antigens (r\n = 0.655). However, the greatest numbers of SFCs were evident in two individuals (E1, mean \u00b1 SD: 13.5 \u00b1 1.2 SFC/million cells and E9, 14.7 \u00b1 2.2 SFC/million cells). B cell memory could not be detected in the absence of IL-2 and SAC stimulation prior to ELISpot analysis, which was an unstimulated B cell control (Fig. 4).",

Conversely, a correlation was observed between the ELISpot results and IgG reactivity to the HMPV P antigen (r\n = 0.655) for individuals exhibiting IgG specific antibody responses to the HMPV P antigen.

Besides antibodies, long-term memory B and T cell immunity might play an important role in protection against HMPV. In some individuals, high antibody levels with low or no numbers of memory B cells were found. This strengthens the idea that long-lived plasma cells maintain antibody levels and that memory B cells are a distinct population of cells. Memory B cells do not secrete antibodies prior to activation. Upon renewed antigen stimulation, memory B cells may rapidly respond, proliferate and differentiate in antibody secreting cells. The ongoing circulation of HMPV among the Irish population causing antigenic re-challenge might explain the low correlation between circulating HMPV-specific memory B cells and antibody levels measured in our study. Importantly, in some individuals no HMPV-specific memory B cells, as well as low HMPV-specific antibody levels, were detectable which might result in a higher susceptibility for infection with HMPV.",
