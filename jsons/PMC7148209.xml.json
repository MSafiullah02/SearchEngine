One of the main reasons is that the capabilities of public health systems to cope with the plethora of cases that emerge on a daily basis are certainly limited. However, the proliferation of online social media platforms is changing the dynamics in which mental state assessment is performed [7, 23]. Individuals are using these platforms on a daily basis to share their thoughts as well as to disclose their feelings and moods [8].",

In particular, they highlight the potential for cross-disciplinary collaboration and impact with a number of scientific fields, including psychology. In this respect, the Early Risk Prediction on the Internet (eRisk) [14, 15], as well as the Computational Linguistics and Clinical Psychology (CLPsych) [9] workshops were the first to propose benchmarks to bring together many researchers to address the automatic detection of mental disorders in online social media.",

Researchers participating in these workshops have examined a wide variety of methods to identify positive cases [27, 30]; however, not much insight has been given as to why a system succeeds or fails. Moreover, the models and features used in those studies could be analysed and motivated more deeply. Therefore, we argue that even though achieving an effective performance is important, being able to track and visualise the development of the mental disorder also is. This means that an accurate system can be more useful if it provides a way of understanding the explanatory factors that lead to a certain decision.",

Secondly, we are interested to know whether different mental disorders share the same characteristics or they are clearly different in terms of the dimensions analysed. Our main research questions, therefore, are:RQ1: How different is the language of users with mental disorder compared to control individuals in online social media?RQ2: To what extent is the language of depression, anorexia and self-harm cases different in online social media?RQ3: How can language-specific and emotional information be visualised to be utilised by psychologists during the diagnosis process?\n",

Across different mental disorders, however, we could not find any significant indicators. Therefore, we can conclude that analysing social media posts could help a system identify people that are more likely to be diagnosed a mental disorder. On the other hand, determining the exact disorder is a much more difficult task, requiring expert judgement. Also, we found that psychometric attributes and emotional expression provides a quantifiable way to differentiate between individuals affected by mental disorders from healthy ones. The study we presented in this work has high practical impact since research should be steered towards building new metrics that can correlate with a disease before traditional symptoms arise and which clinicians can use as leading indicators of traditional later-onset symptoms.",
