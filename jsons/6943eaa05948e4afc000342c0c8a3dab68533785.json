            "text": "Assessing the impact of mobility on epidemic spreading is of crucial importance for understanding the effect of policies like mass quarantines and selective re-openings. High mobility between areas contribute to the importation of cases, affecting the spread of the disease. While many factors influence local incidence and making it more or less homogeneous with respect to other areas, the importance of multi-seeding has often been overlooked. Multi-seeding occurs when several independent (non-clustered) infected individuals arrive at a susceptible population. This can give rise to autonomous outbreaks that impact separate areas of the contact (social) network. Such mechanism has the potential to boost local incidence and size, making control and tracing measures less effective. In Spain, the high heterogeneity in incidence between similar areas despite the uniform mobility control measures taken suggests that multi-seeding could have played an important role in shaping the spreading of the disease. In this work, we focus on the spreading of SARS-CoV-2 among the 52 Spanish provinces, showing that local incidence strongly correlates with mobility occurred in the early-stage weeks from and to Madrid, the main mobility hub and where the initial local outbreak unfolded. These results clarify the higher order effects that mobility can have on the evolution of an epidemic and highlight the relevance of its control.",

            "text": "In Europe, SARS-CoV-2 severely hit Italy, the first country to report local transmission, in mid-February [3] and, by the end of the month, other European countries like Spain were already experiencing sustained local outbreaks [3] . Madrid was the first region to confirm large * mattia@ifisc.uib-csic.es \u2020 ahernando@kidodynamics.com \u2021 jramasco@ifisc.uib-csic.es numbers of local contagions and, on March 6, 2020, the city already reached 100 confirmed cases. This led to the closure of public buildings and different activities, like, for instance, universities, which brought the lateral effect of getting people who reside in the city for work or study to leave and go back to their province of origin. As most major capitals in the world, Madrid attracts workers and students from all the country, a large fraction of daily commuters from neighboring provinces and weekly travelers from all provinces. Among these for example Soria, one of the most affected provinces by COVID-19 per capita, which counts with a scarce population and density but a large number of weekly commuters with the capital. On March 14, given the fast spread of the virus in the country, the Spanish Government declared the Alarm State (Estado de Alarma) [4] . Such State allows the Government to impose restrictions on economic activities and citizens mobility. The restrictions included a reduction of public transport services like buses, metros and trains around the 50% of the usual capacity, the closure of buildings and activities related to the public sector and the limitation of individual mobility in the whole country. People could leave home only for essential needs as grocery shopping, visiting the doctor and pharmacies, or going to work. Mobility between provinces was limited to working reasons. This compressed the closing of many economic activities, especially those related to the service sector, letting only some exceptions like logistics and transport, supermarkets, pharmacies, health-related centers, construction, agriculture and industry to keep operating. On March 29, given the growth in the number of new cases, the Government declared the closing of all non-essential activities. After April 13, 2020, the restriction measures have started to be progressively lifted but we will center on the initial stages of the spreading. In this work, combining detailed human mobility data with epidemiological reports, we study the relationship between inter-city mobility flows and COVID-19 incidence. Our working hypothesis is that large mobility flows lead to multiple seeding events resulting in several local outbreaks and, finally, to a higher incidence. Although the role of human mobility in shaping epidemic dynamics has been extensively considered [5] [6] [7] [8] [9] [10] [11] [12] [13] [14] , even recently for COVID-19 [15] [16] [17] [18] [19] [20] [21] , the effect of multiple seeding due to mobility has received sensibly less attention; with only few theoretical [22, 23] and applied exceptions [24] [25] [26] [27] . To test this assumption, we focus on the change in mobility among the province of Madridwhere the first sustained outbreak was recorded-and the other provinces in Spain the week before the onset of the local outbreaks. The same analysis is then performed on the mortality instead of the incidence, attesting the robustness of our approach. Our results confirm that trips between Madrid and other provinces occurred one week before the onset explain the 65% of the peak incidence for each area. Moreover, we find that a model that takes into account trips, population size and onset time accounts for the 76% of the SARS-CoV-2 incidence and mortality during the peak in each area of the country.",

The dataset contains approximately 13 million devices with unique daily mobility patterns, each being composed of a series of trips and visits. A trip is defined as a sequence of records per device that are only compatible with displacements of at least 5 km/h in the past 1 hour window. Trips are aggregated by origin (destination) province according to the location of the antennas where the first (last) records occurred. Complementary to trips, a stay is defined as any sequence of consecutive records that do not constitute trips. Stays are aggregated by province according to the location of the antennas where all their records occurred. Each device is assigned a residence province according to the most common location of its stays outside office hours. All the stays outside a device's residence area are then labeled as \"visits\". Figure 1 shows, for instance, the number of residents from the different provinces with stays in Madrid. Mobility patterns in Spain display significantly different behaviors during the weekend and weekdays. Thus, we classify the visits of a given device to a given province as \"weekender\" if more than half of the device's visits to that province during the period of study occurred during the weekend.",

As can be seen in Fig. 2a , the height of the incidence peak is connected to the time between the local onset and peak in every province. This is natural, but it testifies that the outbreaks behave similarly across provinces once local contagion ignites. An analogous, even clearer relation, can be observed between the maximum incidence and the delay of the local onset from the arrival of Madrid at 100 cases (Fig. 2b) . As can be observed in Figs. 2c and d, the time of the local onset is highly related to the total trips from/to Madrid the week before, showing that mobility was the main driver of the epidemic expansion. The main outliers here are La Rioja and\u00c1lava, which started the onset right after Madrid without having such high level of trips per capita with the capital. This is due to a super-spreading event registered in a wedding that strongly boosted local contagion in both neighboring provinces almost at the same time that the epidemic started to ramp up in Madrid [29] . Finally and more importantly for the hypothesis of the relevance of multiseeding, Figs. 2e and f show the connection between the height of the incidence peak and the trips from/to Madrid weighted by the local population of the province with a high level of correlation. There are some outliers as the provinces neighboring Madrid (\u00c1vila, Cuenca, Guadalajara and Toledo), which fall within the functional metropolitan area of the capital and thus behave similarly to Madrid itself.

The peak of mortality correlates better with the time difference between the local onset and March 6 (Fig. 3b) . The mobility for the analysis is the same as that taken for the incidence, one week before or 7 days before the onset of the incidence in every province. The results of plotting the time difference between the local mortality onset and March 6 are shown in Fig. 3c (for the one week mobility) and in Fig. 3d for a single day mobility. In general, the higher the mobility between the province and Madrid, the faster casualties are observed. This relation is valid for all provinces except for those with a strong overlap with the metropolitan area of Madrid, which once again are outliers in these plots. As shown in Figs. 3e and f, the mobility the week before the local incidence onset from/to Madrid in trips per capita of the province correlates with the peak in mortality.

This is understandable given that for them the trips are internal mobility. Such effect brings the saturation in the curves of Fig. 4b and c . On the other side, weekenders stays from/at Madrid are not affected by distance as much as for weekday visitors, hence the saturation for neighboring provinces disappears. By this analysis, we can understand that those provinces where a higher relative peak of contagions and deaths occurred exhibit higher visits to/from the capital per capita the week before the onsets and, therefore, a higher inflow of seeds.

The confinement measures were taken in an uniform way across the country with a first lockdown on Friday March 14, 2020, a more strict lockdown on March 29. The incidence peaks for most of the provinces occurred after the first lockdown and before the second. The fact that the lockdowns are uniform allows us to perform the analysis on multi-seeding in equal conditions. We find a clear relation between the mobility from/to Madrid and the heights of the peaks of incidence and mortality. Furthermore, the kind of mobility that better correlates is the one exhibited by weekenders one week before the local onset and, typically, before the confinement measures. This supports the policies intended to target non-essential trips first and, only later, commuting flows (weekday travelers).",

More cases imply larger mortality. These are theoretical arguments of the effect of multi-seeding. The main contribution of our work is to offer empirical evidence of such connections between multi-seeding and the severity of the epidemic at the population level. We hope that this study will highlight the importance of mobility in an epidemic situation, which goes beyond a first direct relation between arrival times and inflow of trips, and help stakeholders and decisionmakers to design more efficient responses.",
