            "text": "Pancreas disease (PD) of Atlantic salmon is an emerging disease caused by Salmonid alphavirus (SAV) which mainly affects salmonid aquaculture in Western Europe. Although genome structure of SAV has been characterized and each individual viral protein has been identified, the role of 6K protein in viral replication and infectivity remains undefined. The 6K protein of alphaviruses is a small and hydrophobic protein which is involved in membrane permeabilization, protein processing and virus budding. Because these common features are shared across many viral species, they have been named viroporins. In the present study, we applied reverse genetics to generate SAV3 6K-deleted (D6K) variant and investigate the role of 6K protein. Our findings show that the 6K-deletion variant of salmonid alphavirus is non-viable. Despite viral proteins of D6K variant are detected in the cytoplasm by immunostaining, they are not found on the cell surface. Further, analysis of viral proteins produced in D6K cDNA clone transfected cells using radioimmunoprecipitation (RIPA) and western blot showed a protein band of larger size than E2 of wild-type SAV3. When D6K cDNA was co-transfected with SAV3 helper cDNA encoding the whole structural genes including 6K, the infectivity was rescued. The development of CPE after co-transfection and resolved genome sequence of rescued virus confirmed full-length viral genome being generated through RNA recombination. The discovery of the important role of the 6K protein in virus production provides a new possibility for the development of antiviral intervention which is highly needed to control SAV infection in salmonids.",

PD is a major problem in salmonid farming in Western Europe, causing high mortalities in the seawater stage. Diseased fish are clinically characterized by inappetence, fecal casts and emaciation with main pathological changes found in pancreas, heart and skeletal muscle [1] . To date, several subtypes of SAV sharing highly homogeneous genome sequences have been identified. Salmon pancreas disease virus (SPDV or SAV1) was first found in Ireland and Scotland in farmed Atlantic salmon [2] . Subsequently, sleeping disease virus (SDV or SAV2) which mainly affects rainbow trout was discovered in UK and France [3] . The third subtype of SAV (SAV3) is so far exclusively found in Norway affecting both Atlantic salmon and rainbow trout [4] . Additionally, another three discrete subtypes (SAV4-6) have been identified in Scotland and Ireland based on partial sequence (nsP3 and E2) analysis [5] , and a marine SAV2-related virus is now also found in PD outbreaks in mid-Norway and Scotland [6] . All subtypes are geographically separated and distinguished based on phylogenetic analysis [7] . Only SAV 1-3 are fully sequenced, with a nucleotide identity of the three SAVs being above 90% over the entire genome.",

Members of the alphavirus genus include many medically important pathogens such as Western equine encephalitis viruses (WEEV), Eastern equine encephalitis viruses (EEEV), Venezuelan equine encephalitis viruses (VEEV), Chikungunya virus, Ross River virus (RRV), Semliki Forest virus (SFV) and Sindbis virus (SINV). The diameter of an alphavirus virion is around 65-70 nm consisting of a tightly adherent lipid envelope surrounding an icosahedral capsid [8, 9] . The genome is a positivesense, single-stranded RNA of approximately 11-12 kb which is capped at the 59 end and polyadenylated at the 39 end and thus serves directly as mRNA for translation of the viral replicase upon entry into host cells. The genomic organization of alphavirus is divided into two open reading frames (ORFs) [10, 11] . The first ORF encoding four non-structural proteins (nsP), designated nsP1-4, is responsible for transcription and replication of viral RNA. The second ORF, under the control of a 26S subgenomic promoter, codes for another polyprotein (capsid-PE2-6K-E1) making up the structural proteins (SP). PE2 and E1 are the envelope glycoproteins, associated as a heterodimer that migrates together with 6K through the secretory pathway to the plasma membrane. PE2 is cleaved to generate E3 and E2 glycoproteins in a post-Golgi compartment [12] .",

Alphavirus 6K together with several other viral gene products, such as Poliovirus 2B, Influenza A virus M2, HIV-1 Vpu and HCV p7, are classified as viroporins which share a common feature of enhancing membrane permeability [13] [14] [15] . The 6K proteins of SFV or SINV have been shown to be involved in membrane permeabilization at the late stage of infection [16] . Oligomerization of 6K proteins leads to ion channels formation in cell membranes and increases membrane permeability, which facilitates virus budding [15] . An identified aromatic domain (rich in aromatic amino acids) at the N-terminal of 6K shows a strong tendency to insert in the interfacial phase of the phospholipid bilayer which also facilitates membrane destabilization [9] . In addition to the role associated with membrane permeabilization, 6K also provides cleavage sites for polyprotein processing at its Nterminal and C-terminal ends. Both the E2-6K and 6K-E1 cleavage sites are found on the luminal side of ER and cleaved by signal peptidase [17] . A SFV mutant lacking the entire 6K is processed correctly between PE2 and E1 without altering glycoprotein formation, heterodimerization and intracellular transport [18] . However, the budding process of the SFV 6K deletion mutant is impaired and virus titer is reduced [19] . Deletion of 6K in SINV also causes impaired budding and in addition the cleavage of polyprotein becomes less efficient [20] . The sequence of SAV3 6K has been identified but protein function and its role in virus formation have not been studied in any detail. We wanted to explore if deletion of the SAV3 6K gene would attenuate virus infectivity and thus could represent a strategy for development of a live-attenuated viral vaccine against PD. As the cleavage sites of the polyprotein including 6K remain to be proven experimentally for salmonid alphaviruses, these were deduced from amino acid sequence homology with other alphaviruses [21] . We examined the role of the 6K protein by deleting the entire gene using a reverse genetics approach and then studied generation of infectious progeny in vitro.",

PCR was performed using Phusion High-Fidelity DNA Polymerase (Finnzymes) with primers (Table 1) based on a previously published sequence (GenBank no. AY604238). The rapid amplification of cDNA ends (RACE) technique was performed to obtain the full-length sequence including the exact 59 and 39 ends. The procedure was performed according to the manufacturer's instructions (BD SMART RACE cDNA Amplification Kit, Clontech). 59 RACE-GSP and 39 RACE-GSP primers were designed based on sequence information obtained in the first round (Table 1 ). RACE products were purified and subcloned into pGEM-T Easy vector, and for both 59-and 39-RACE, 10 colonies were picked up for sequencing (Eurofins MWG).",

The infectious clone was constructed by combining two clones containing roughly half of the genomic cDNA ( Figure 1 ). The first fragment (6374 bp) was amplified with primers P1 and P2 flanked with EcoR I and Afl P/Not I restriction sites respectively ( Table 1 ). The second fragment (5527 bp) was amplified with primers P3 and P4 flanked with EcoR I/Afl P and Not I sites respectively. PCR reactions contained 28.5 ml H 2 O, 10 ml 5X Phusion HF Buffer, 3 ml 10 mM dNTPs, 6 ml 0.5 mM forward plus reverse primers, 2 ml viral cDNA and 0.5 ml Phusion High-Fidelity DNA Polymerase (Finnzymes). PCR was performed using the following conditions: 98uC 30 s, 35 cycles of 98uC 10 s, 60uC 30 s, 72uC 4 min, and finally 72uC 5 min. The two fragments constituting the entire viral genome were cloned separately into the pBluescript vector (Stratagene) at EcoR I and Not I sites following standard cloning procedures. pBluescript vectors containing the 6.5 kb and 5.5 kb fragments were subsequently digested with Afl P and Not I and purified, before the full-length SAV3 cDNA clone without poly(A) was constructed by combining the two fragments at Afl P/Not I site ( Figure 1) . A poly(A) tail was added by PCR at the 39 end of the cDNA clone using primer P5 containing the poly(A) tail and flanked by BmtI and NotI sites in combination with primer P3 (Table1). The PCR product was gel purified and combined with the pBluescript vector containing the 6.5 kb fragment at the Afl P/Not I sites to yield the full-length SAV3 cDNA clone with poly(A). The resulting infectious cDNA clone was finally transferred from the pBluescript backbone and inserted into the pTurboFP635-N vector (Evrogen) at the EcoRI and NotI sites, and designated as pSAV3-FL.",

Furthermore, a T7 promoter was fused upstream to the HH sequence to obtain the capability of in vitro transcription. This was achieved by long-range PCR using the Phusion system as described above, with primers T7-HH-F and CMV-R (Table1) and NotI linearized pSAV3-FL DNA as template. The obtained PCR product was purified and treated with a T4 polynucleotide kinase (Promega) and subsequently self-ligated with T4 ligase (Promega). The full-length SAV3 cDNA construct containing the T7 promoter and HH sequences was named pSAV3-HHFL. Deletion of the 6K gene was obtained by amplifying pSAV3-HHFL using PCR with appropriate outward-facing primers (D6K-F and D6K-R), creating a PCR product of the entire plasmid but lacking the gene of interest ( Table 1 ). The PCR product was turned into a plasmid as described above and designated pSAV3-HHD6K. A SAV3 helper cDNA vector was constructed by deleting the replicon (nsP1, nsP2, nsP3, and nsP4) from the fulllength cDNA clone except for 100 nt at carboxy-terminal of nsP4 that was preserved. This was achieved by PCR using the primers Helper-F and Helper-R ( Table 1 ). The sequences of all final constructs were confirmed by DNA sequencing (Eurofins MWG).",

Five Balb/C mice were immunized with pSFV-REP-SAV-SP (10 mg DNA/20 ml PBS per mice) via intradermal injection near the base of the tail followed by intradermal electroporation (Cyto Pulse Sciences, Inc., Glen Burnie, MD) as previously described [25] .

Additionally a booster immunization with recombinant SAV3-E2 protein (10 mg/50 ul PBS) expressed in E. coli [22] and mixed with 50 ml Freund's incomplete adjuvant (Sigma F5506) were given intramuscularly divided equally between the hind legs at week 6. Sera from the five immunized mice and two non-immunized controls were then harvested at week 13. After confirming specific staining in SAV3 infected cells by immunofluorescence (IF) assays, sera from all mice were pooled and stored at 220uC. All mice were bred and housed at the animal facility of the Department of Microbiology, Tumor and Cell Biology at the Karolinska Institutet, Stockholm, Sweden. Mice were anaesthetized with 4% isoflurane (Baxter Medical AB, Kista, Sweden) during all intradermal injections and electroporations.

Genome sequencing except for the 59 and 39 end was performed with primers based on known sequences from other SAV3 strains deposited in GenBank. To ensure functionality of the recombinant virus, the exact sequences of the viral ends were revealed by 59 and 39 RACE. To obtain the full-length SAV3 cDNA construct, two fragments with the sizes of 6374 bp and 5527 bp was combined, using the internal restriction site AflII and external restriction sites EcoR I and Not I for ligation (Figure 1 ). At this stage the full-length SAV3 cDNA excluding 39 poly(A), 11877 bp in length, was inserted into the pBluescript vector. The addition of a poly(A) tail sequence at the 39 end was made by PCR and the resulting fulllength SAV3 cDNA containing poly(A) was subcloned into the pTurboFP635-N vector (Figure 2A) . Two different cDNA clones were fully sequenced and the sequencing result showed nucleotide sequences identical to the parental virus sequences. This suggests an efficient and predictable method for construction of full-length SAV cDNA clones has been established. In order to ensure precise cleavage at the 59 end during transcription, a HH ribozyme sequence was inserted immediately upstream of the 59 UTR as described by others [23] . The construct was further engineered by fusing a T7 promoter in front of the HH sequence. Finally, the non-viral sequences between the CMV and T7 promoter were removed, generating the final infectious cDNA clone ( Figure 2B ) for rescue of recombinant virus.",

The SFV replicon system has proven to be a useful vector for expression of heterologous genes and the vector design for enhanced immunogenicity in mice [24, 29] was employed to generate anti-SAV3 antibody. ELISA results confirmed high levels of antibodies generated from immunized mice with minimal background, while non-immunized mice were negative ( Figure 3A ). The anti-SAV3 mice serum also allowed specific detection of SAV3 in infected pancreatic tissue by immunohistochemistry ( Figure 3B ). When mouse anti-SAV3-SP serum was incubated with proteins from wt SAV3 infected CHH-1 cells blotted on a PVDF membrane, four bands were clearly revealed. No specific bands were detected in uninfected control cell samples ( Figure 3C ). Two bands at around 50 kDa and 57 kDa were most likely E2 and pE2 (E2+E3), respectively, although we cannot rule out that one of them might as well be E1. Additionally, two larger bands with the size of around 100 kDa and 110 kDa were possibly corresponding to uncleaved polyproteins. Further analysis revealed that the antibody provided strong and highly specific detection of SAV3 in cell culture by immunostaining, making it possible to evaluate the expression kinetics of SAV3 viral proteins during the course of viral infection. As shown in Figure 3D -I, following inoculation with wt SAV3, no viral protein was detected at 16 and 24 hours post inoculation (hpi), while some cells expressed viral proteins at 40 hpi. At 48 hpi, an increasing number of positive staining cells were detected concomitant with a slight change in morphology. CPE consisting of cell shrinkage was observed from 72 hpi, progressing into more severe CPE being observed at 96 hpi.",

            "text": "rSAV3 is predominantly recovered in CHH-1 which have a feeble IFN response In order to rescue infectious SAV3 virus by reverse genetics in a virus-favored environment, we first sought for an optimal cell line for virus replication. The full-length cDNA clone was transfected into three susceptible cell lines, CHSE-214, BF-2, and CHH-1. Extensive CPE was observed in CHH-1 cells appearing at 5 days post transfection (dpt). Comparable CPE was observed at 10 dpt in CHSE-214 and BF-2 cells (data not shown), suggesting that these cell lines were more resistant to SAV3 infection. In line with these results, infectious virus was rescued as early as 2 dpt in CHH-1 cells and increased to a viral titer of 4.7610 7 TCID 50 /ml at 7 dpt and 6.8610 7 TCID 50 /ml at 13 dpt ( Figure 4A ). The rescue of infectious virus was significantly delayed in CHSE-214 and BF-2 cells (rescued from 4 dpt) and the resulting peak titers were 1-1.5 log 10 lower than what was obtained in CHH-1 cells ( Figure 4A ). In a previous study we have demonstrated the effect of IFN-a on limiting SAV3 viral replication [22] and this prompted us to associate the discrepancy of CPE and viral replication with capabilities of IFN induction in different cell lines. We therefore measured innate immune responses in these three cell lines post SAV3 infection. The induction of IFNa and two interferonstimulated genes (ISGs), Mx and ISG15, was quantified at RNA expression level by real-time PCR. Indeed, the result showed that responses in both IFNa and the two ISGs were low in CHH-1 while significantly stronger responses were detected in CHSE-214 and BF-2 cells ( Figure 4B ). At 1 and 2 dpi, the induction of IFNa and ISGs was in general low in all examined cell lines. At 4 dpi, markedly high levels of IFNa and ISGs were induced in CHSE-214 and BF-2 cells ( Figure 4B ). IFNa was upregulated ,120-fold in CHSE-214 and ,150-fold in BF-2 cells. In contrast, upregulation of IFNa was only 5-fold in CHH-1 cells. For the ISGs, Mx was upregulated ,400-fold in CHSE-214, ,1450-fold in BF-2, and 90-fold in CHH-1 cells, while ISG15 was upregulated ,135-fold in CHSE-214, 215-fold in BF-2 cells, and 23-fold in CHH-1 cells. The same pattern was obtained for Mx protein expression in CHSE-214 and CHH-1 cells by western blot (Figure 4C ), confirming differential induction of IFN responses in different SAV3 susceptible cell lines. From the results above, we conclude that CHH-1 is the optimal cell line for rescue of infectious SAV3 virus from full-length cDNA clones, and thus the following studies were performed in CHH-1 cells.",

In the present study, we first aligned the SAV3 6K sequence with sequences from other alphaviruses ( Figure 5A ) and performed hydrophobicity scale characterization ( Figure 5B ). Results showed that SAV3 6K shares 38-51% similarity to other alphaviruses, while being highly conserved when compared to SAV1 (94.1%) and SAV2 (95.1%). Although sequence similarities were found, differences between SAV and other alphaviruses were detected. First, the 6K protein of SAV3 possesses 68 amino acids, being slightly larger than 6K proteins of other alphaviruses, manifested with a unique insertion of 7 amino acids (GVRGWSA) located in the transmembrane domain 2 (TMD 2) ( Figure 5A ). Second, two hydrophobic residues in the aromatic domain of 6K, Trp-11 and Trp-19, are fully conserved among all alphaviruses ( Figure 5A ). The first corresponding residue in SAV3 6K, Trp-12, is conserved with other alphaviruses. However, the second corresponding hydrophobic residue in SAV3 6K is Gly-20. Hydrophobicity analysis of the 6K protein using the Kyte-Doolittle method, showed two potential transmembrane domains (TMD) in SAV3, as seen in other alphaviruses ( Figure 5B ). These two putative TMDs were further analyzed by TMpred program [30] . The first TMD starts from Val-17 to Leu-37, with a predicted outside to inside orientation and the second TMD is from Phe-47 to Cys-66, with the orientation inside to outside membranes ( Figure 5C ). A cysteine rich domain between the two TMDs was found in SAV3 and conserved with other alphaviruses, possibly forming a cytosolic loop connecting the two transmembrane domains of 6K. Aligning 6K among SAV subtypes 1-3 showed that only five amino acids were not conserved between them ( Figure 5C ), while the aromatic domain and the unique insertion (GVRGWSA), were conserved among three SAV subtypes.",

Despite the fact that multiple attempts with the D6K cDNA clone (pSAV3-HH D6K) were made to recover virus both from transfected CHH-1 and CHSE-214 cells, CPE was not observed and no virus was recovered. We next examined whether viral proteins were expressed in transfected cells by immunostaining ( Figure 6 ). CHH-1 cells were transfected with either full-length SAV3 (pSAV3-HHFL) or SAV3 lacking 6K (pSAV3-HHD6K) cDNA clones and expression of viral proteins was examined at 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 10 dpt. Due to complete CPE present at day 8 following transfection with full-length SAV, these cells were examined for 6 days. At 2 dpt, viral protein expression was observed both in fulllength ( Figure 6A ) and D6K cDNA transfected cells ( Figure 6E ). At 3 dpt, a distinct difference of viral protein expression was seen between full-length SAV3 ( Figure 6B ) and D6K mutant ( Figure 6F ). The number of positive cells was higher for CHH-1 cells transfected with full-length SAV, and the staining of virus-positive cells was shown in a multi-focused pattern indicating spread of virus from primary infected cells to neighboring cells. At 4 dpt, a large number of virus-positive cells were seen for pSAV3-HHFL transfected culture and correspondingly, changes in cell morphology started to appear ( Figure 6C ). By day 6 the virus infection had spread to all cells and evident CPE was present ( Figure 6D ). In contrast, the number of virus positive cells increased slightly in CHH-1 transfected with pSAV3-HHD6K cDNA up to 4 dpt, waning at 8 and 10 dpt ( Figure 6G-J) . Correspondingly, no CPE was observed ( Figure 6E -J) and the cell cultures grew to higher density at late time points (Figure 6E versus 6J) . These results show that viral proteins were expressed in pSAV3-HHD6K cDNA transfected cells but infectious virus was not recovered spreading from the primary transfected cells.",

If this was the case, viral proteins should be detected on the plasma membrane of pSAV3-HHD6K transfected cells. To test this, transfected cells were immunostained under both permeabilized and non-permeabilized conditions. In pSAV3-HHFL transfected cells, viral proteins were clearly observed both in the cytoplasm ( Figure 7A ) and on the plasma membrane ( Figure 7B ), indicating that viral proteins were transported to the cell surface. Although viral proteins were detected in the cytoplasm of cells transfected with pSAV3-HHD6K ( Figure 7C) , we were not able to detect any viral proteins on the cell surface ( Figure 7D ).

            "text": "Since alphaviruses produce polyproteins which are subsequently cleaved into separate proteins, we wanted to know whether viral proteins were properly processed in pSAV3-HHD6K transfected cells. To study viral protein synthesis, we metabolically labeled the newly synthesized proteins with S 35 methionine. Characterization of total proteins by SDS-PAGE and autoradiography showed a partial shutdown of protein translation in both wt SAV3 infected (85% shutdown) and pSAV3-HHFL cDNA transfected cells (70% shutdown). In contrast only a moderate shutdown (33%) was seen in pSAV3-HHD6K cDNA transfected cells ( Figure 8A ). Newly synthesized SAV viral proteins, one being the putative capsid protein with the size of around 37 kDa was also visualized by autoradiography, which is in agreement with the size of the capsid [31] . However, in contrast to other alphaviruses, the fact that SAV does not induce total shutdown of host protein translation makes it difficult to identify each single viral protein or polyprotein. In order to enrich viral proteins over host proteins, S 35 labeled total proteins were separated into an aqueous and a detergent phase and radio-immunoprecipitated with mouse anti-SAV3-SP antibody against structural proteins. The separated detergent phase was applied to RIPA as it is assumed that most SAV3 viral structural proteins will be located either on ER/Golgi or plasma membranes. The results showed virus-specific bands ( Figure 8B ), similar to the viral proteins detected by western blot using mouse anti-SAV3-SP antibody ( Figure 3C ). For the wt SAV3 and full-length construct a faint capsid protein band was still present in the membrane fraction, very likely representing preassembled virus particles found on membranes [32] . As mentioned above, proteins corresponding to approximately 50 kDa and 57 kDa were possibly E2, E1 and pE2 (E2+E3). It is noticeable that the viral protein patterns for wt SAV3 and rSAV3 were identical ( Figure 8B ). The protein pattern in pSAV3-HHD6K cDNA transfected cells was however different. One strong band with a molecular mass slightly larger than 60 kDa was found only in pSAV3-HHD6K transfected cells and not present in wt SAV3 infected and pSAV3-HHFL cDNA transfected cells ( Figure 8B ). Western blot analysis using the rabbit anti-SAV3-E2 specific antibody [22] confirmed that this protein was indeed virus specific ( Figure 8C) , likely corresponding to a precursor of the E2 protein, but cannot be the non-cleaved E2-E1 as the size was too small.",

At 12 dpt, CPE was detected in 14 out of 48 transfected wells ( Figure 9A&B ). To examine whether viruses obtained from these CPE-positive wells were fully infectious or propagation-defective that undergo only one round of infection, virus supernatant derived from the transfected cells was passaged to new CHH-1 cells. Development of CPE was consistently seen for three passages, demonstrating successful formation of infectious virus likely through RNA recombination during viral replication. To prove this, supernatant was collected from a well showing CPE and from which viral RNA was isolated and the SAV structural genes were amplified from the capsid protein gene to E1. After cloning and transformation, plasmids were extracted from 12 colonies and digested with the restriction endonucleases EcoR I and BsrG I. As BsrG I is a unique site within 6K, digested plasmids will contain three fragments if 6K is present, otherwise only two fragments will appear ( Figure 9C ). The results showed that 5 out of 12 examined clones contained the 6K gene, which was further confirmed by DNA sequencing. Notably, these clones contained fragments of different sizes, suggesting that recombination did not occur at precise sites. We therefore went on to study what was present in the following passage. Viral RNAs isolated from the first passage were amplified by PCR targeting the region between nsP4 and E1. Following cloning and digestion with EcoR I, EcoR V, and BsrG I, plasmids will contain four fragments if the 6K gene was present. The result showed that all digested clones contained 6K in the viral genome ( Figure 9D ). One of the cloned viral genomes was fully sequenced and the result revealed the genome sequence identical to that of parental virus (SAV3-H10).",

Furthermore, we found that SAV contains a unique seven-amino acid domain ''GVRGWSA'', conserved within the three fully sequenced subtypes SAV1-3, and not found in other alphavirus species. The 6K protein is associated with membranes and it is not unlikely that this insertion adapts the 6K protein to function in cold-blooded animal species that carry a different membrane composition compared to warm-blooded animals. To maintain the viscosity of their membranes as poikilothermic animals, fish cell membranes contain a high content of unsaturated fatty acids to keep them fluid at low temperatures.

All these similarities theoretically imply that SAV3 6K functions as a viroporin in a similar way as for other alphaviruses, while being indispensable for SAV3 infectivity. This is comparable to the viroporin p7 protein of HCV which is also essential for infectivity [33, 34] and viability [35] . Due to this, p7 has become an interesting target for development of antiviral compounds [36] [37] [38] [39] .

Proper glycoprotein proteolytic processing was however hampered in SINV variants containing either a partially deleted 6K lacking the amino acid residuals 24 to 45 or an in-frame insertion of 15 amino acid within the 6K gene, resulting in reduced formation of viral particles and reduced plaque size [20, 40] . We could not unequivocally determine whether the process of SAV polyprotein cleavage shares similarity to other alphaviruses, partly because protein shutdown was not 100% in the host cells, making it difficult to identify the viral proteins during protein synthesis. To resolve this problem, development of antibodies specifically recognizing each viral protein will be needed. When we compared the size of the E2 glycoprotein of the D6K mutant by radioimmunoprecipitation and western blot, we observed that the glycoprotein was of larger size than E2 of wild-type SAV3. Impaired polyprotein processing between E2 and E1 leading to the production of unauthentic E2 proteins could explain this. Another explanation is that the large size of E2 of the D6K mutant could result from incorrect posttranslational modification, appearing as a heavily non-trimmed glycosylated protein stuck in the secretory pathway. Although immunofluorescent staining showed that viral proteins were expressed within pSAV3-HHD6K transfected cells, viral proteins were not detected on the cell surface, suggesting impaired trafficking of viral proteins from the ER or other intracellular compartments to the plasma membrane.",

In this study, we demonstrated frequent RNA recombination by SAV3 within cells transfected with pSAV3-HHD6K cDNA together with a helper cDNA clone containing all structural genes including 6K gene in CHH-1 cells. A recent publication by our group documenting that natural infection of SAV3 generates numerous viral deletion mutants through imprecise RNA recombination [42] , is in agreement with the result of this study showing recombination in co-transfected cells in vitro at non-specific sites. After one round of passage in cells, we found that the structure of all plasmids analyzed by restriction enzyme digestion was identical, documenting strong selection for viable variants. The fact that RNA recombination occurs in alphaviruses therefore seems to address pivotal safety concerns regarding recombinant alphaviruses used as attenuated vaccines.",

The mechanisms of recombination of non-segmented genomes are not fully understood, but occur during viral replication and likely involve switching between viral templates while holding on to the nascent viral strand [44] . More detailed studies of alphavirus RNA recombination has been performed in SINV [45] [46] [47] , showing that RNA recombination of SINV gives rise to deletions, insertions and genome rearrangements [48] . Interestingly, many of these altered SINV RNAs are still infectious. Similarly, Hahn et al. [49] demonstrated that WEEV is a recombinant virus and suggested that WEEV appears to have arisen by recombination between a EEEV-like virus (capsid protein) and a SINV-like virus (glycoproteins), which underlines the importance of RNA recombination in virus evolution.",

The CHH-1 cell line develops CPE faster than CHSE-214 and Salmon head kidney-1 (SHK-1) cells after infection with SAV1 [51] . Based on the above, we compared recovery of recombinant SAV3 in these three cell lines, CHSE-214, BF-2 and CHH-1. In conformity with the published results, CPE occurred earlier after transfection with the full-length cDNA clone in CHH-1 cells compared to CHSE-214 and BF-2 cells. Moreover, a 10 times higher virus titer was obtained in CHH-1 cells. As SAV is highly sensitive to IFN-a responses [22] , the difference was likely due to CHH-1 cells generating weak IFN-a and ISGs responses to SAV3 infection when compared to the other two cells lines (Figure 4) . Similarly, Baby hamster kidney-21 (BHK-21), an IFN-deficient cell line, has been widely used for the production of high titer alphaviruses [52, 53] .",

However, chimeric alphaviruses composed by a SFV replicon and SAV3 structural proteins failed to assemble into virus particles in transfected BHK-21 cells (no CPE) despite high levels of SAV3 structural proteins being detected in the cytoplasm (data not shown). It is possible that the SAV3 capsid protein does not recognize the SFV packaging signal located in nsP2 [54] or that surface proteins of SAV3 (E1 and E2) adapted for cold-water environment are not functional at higher temperatures.",
