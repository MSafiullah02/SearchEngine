            "text": "Cryptosporidial infection is one of the most common causes of diarrhea in humans and livestock worldwide (Fayer, 2008b, Fayer et al., 1997, Tzipori and Widmer, 2008, Wyatt et al., 2010). The most prevalent species producing disease in cattle, Cryptosporidium parvum, can cause extensive economic loss in young calves, although some cases remain subclinical (Wyatt et al., 2010). C. parvum is a primary contributor to the neonatal diarrhea complex, along with rotavirus, coronavirus, and Escherichia coli, and is one of the most important zoonotic agents of diarrhea in calves aged below one month (Naciri et al., 1999). Severely affected animals may die, but more often, a self-limiting diarrhea results in morbidity and increased labor and veterinary costs (deGraaf et al., 1999). Infected animals usually shed large numbers of infective oocysts in their feces (Nydam et al., 2001). In dairy calves, the prevalence of shedding has been reported to be the highest among animals 7\u201321 days of age, with a prepatent period of 3\u20136 days (Fayer, 2008a).",

A variety of therapeutic, prophylactic, and metaphylactic pharmaceuticals have been tested for efficacy against C. parvum in humans and animals with varying results (Silverlas et al., 2009, Stockdale et al., 2008, Zhu, 2008). Halofuginone and paromomycin have been tested for veterinary use. According to a recent review and meta-analysis study investigating multiple field trials, calves did not benefit from Halofuginone treatment (Silverlas et al., 2009). Halofuginone lactate (Halocur\u00ae, Intervet) has been approved for use in several European countries, while paromomycin sulphate (Gabbrovet\u00ae, Ceva Sant\u00e9 Animale) is only available as an injectable against bacterial infections in a few countries for piglets, calves and poultry. Vaccines made from killed C. parvum oocysts (Harp and Goff, 1995, Harp and Goff, 1998) or repetitively passaged precocious strains of C. parvum (Fayer, 1994) have been tested for their ability to protect calves from diarrhea and limit oocyst shedding. Vaccination of day-old calves using gamma irradiated oocysts reduced oocyst shedding and diarrhea when challenged with C. parvum on day 21 (Jenkins et al., 2004), however, field trials of killed vaccines have not always convincingly shown protection (Harp and Goff, 1995, Harp and Goff, 1998). There is increasing awareness of the need to develop new, more efficient and safer products to control cryptosporidiosis in livestock (Stockdale et al., 2008).",

A formulation of monoclonal antibodies (MAbs) 3E2 (\u03b1CSL), 3H2 (\u03b1GP25-200), and 1E10 (\u03b1P23) provided significant additive prophylactic efficacy over that of the individual MAbs in neonatal ICR mice (Schaefer et al., 2000). In a study using an adult SCID mouse model to evaluate the therapeutic effect of \u03b1CSL MAb 3E2, highly significant efficacy in reducing, but not eliminating, persistent C. parvum infection was demonstrated (Riggs et al., 2002). A study to evaluate prophylactic efficacy of MAb 3E2 against oocyst challenge was conducted in calves and the results demonstrated significant reductions in severity of diarrhea and oocyst shedding (Riggs et al., 2004). While these studies demonstrated efficacy of antibody-based treatments for cryptosporidiosis, the effective treatment dose of the bioreactor-produced MAb used was cost prohibitive to developing an economically feasible veterinary product.",

The selection of MAbs was based on the work of Schaefer et al. who described significant sporozoite neutralization in vitro and reduction of infection in neonatal mice with a panel of MAbs produced against surface-exposed antigens of C. parvum sporozoites. Among others, MAb 4H9, which was produced against the GP25-200 antigen complex of C. parvum, was chosen for the development of an antibody\u2013biocide fusion (Schaefer et al., 2000). This was done by genetically linking the coding sequence of MAb 4H9 heavy chain with the coding sequence of LL37, a human cathelicidin-derived antimicrobial peptide. The resulting constructs were expressed in a highly efficient retrovector-based mammalian cell culture system. Testing of these novel immunotherapeutics in a neonatal ICR mouse infection (asymptomatic) model revealed that 4H9-G1-LL37 achieved sporozoite neutralization at a 50 fold lower dose than C. parvum-specific neutralizing MAb 3E2, the most potent of the neutralizing antibodies identified to date (Imboden et al., 2010). A dose response mouse trial demonstrated efficacy at a dosage as low as 1.5 mg/kg/d given for 5 days (Imboden et al., 2010). This study allowed establishment of an effective dose for orally administered antibody\u2013biocide fusions in rodents.",

The IgG1 heavy chain constant region was previously engineered (Imboden et al., 2010) to contain the human LL37 sequence attached to the C-terminal end. Fully assembled heavy chain-linker-LL37 and light chain constructs were transduced into CHO (Chinese hamster ovary) cells using a pantropic Moloney murine leukemia virus-based retroviral expression vector system (Clontech, Mountain View, CA). Due to the high efficiency transduction, cell pools secreting the 4H9-G1-LL37 antibody\u2013biocide fusion were subjected to standard limiting dilution cloning to isolate clonal cell lines for pilot scale production in 20 L benchtop fermentors (Wave Bioreactor\u2122 Systems, GE, Piscataway, NJ).",

            "text": "A total of sixteen newborn Holstein bull calves were obtained from the same closed herd production unit of approximately 10,000 dairy cows, in 4 cohorts of 4 calves each. To assemble an age-matched cohort of 4 calves, cows calving within a maximum 12 h period were selected. Calving was manually assisted and the calves were delivered onto plastic sheeting to prevent contamination with enteropathogens that might otherwise confound interpretation of the results, and then placed in individual disinfected transport crates containing autoclaved straw. Upon arrival at the University of Arizona Central Animal Facility BSL2 unit, each calf was randomly assigned to groups using the Microsoft Excel Random Number Generation Tool, weighed and then placed into an elevated calf stall (Wenke Manufacturing, Pender, NE) equipped with urine and fecal collection pans. Calf weights were between 37.5 and 48.6 kg. A single ear tag was applied which served as the calf's identifying number in the study. Commercial colostrum replacer (Bovine IgG Colostrum Replacement, Land O\u2019Lakes, Shoreview, MN) from a single production lot for all calves in the study was administered within 2 h of birth per label instructions. Adequacy of passive transfer of colostral IgG was determined using a commercially available sodium sulfite precipitation test, serum from each calf was collected at 24\u201336 h of age (Bova-S Bovine FPT Test Kit, VMRD Inc., Pullman, WA). All the calves reached serum levels of immunoglobulin between 800 and 1600 mg/ml which is defined as adequate transfer. Bo-Se\u00ae vitamin E/Se supplement (3 ml/45 kg) (Merck, Whitehouse Station, NJ) was injected subcutaneously to each calf within 12 h of birth. Beginning at 12 h of age, all calves were maintained on reconstituted milk replacer (Nutrena\u00ae Snowflakes\u00ae Calf Milk II-Utiliz Milk Replacer Medicated, Cargill Animal Nutrition, Minneapolis, MN) twice daily (10% body weight at arrival for days 1\u20135 and thereafter 50% more) until termination of the experiment at day 10 post infection (DPI). At the end of the acclimation period of 36 h, an overall clinical examination was performed to determine health status prior to admitting each animal to the study. Calves were observed for fever (>39.4 \u00b0C), diarrhea, respiratory distress, inability to rise on own, and inappetence. No exclusions were needed based on these health parameters. An individual fecal sample was collected from each calf to determine the presence of other known viral and bacterial enteropathogenic agents (rotavirus, coronavirus, E. Coli K99 and/or F41, and Salmonella) 2 h post oocyst challenge and on DPI 10. Negative-staining electron microscopy was used for direct examination of feces to identify rotavirus and coronavirus particles. Aerobic cultures were performed on feces to detect the presence of aerobic bacterial pathogens. Sheep blood agar and Tergitol-7 agar (Hardy Diagnostics, Santa Maria, CA) were used for routine aerobic culture, whereas Tetrathionate broth and XLT-4 agar (Hardy) were used for Salmonella culture. Enteric bacteria were identified by routine biochemical tests (Anon, 2007). The presence of K99 antigen in E. coli isolates was evaluated by the E. coli antigen latex agglutination test kit (K-99 Pilitest. VWRD, Inc. Pullman, WA). All samples were found to be negative for these pathogens. The calves were examined once daily by a veterinarian. Each cohort consisted of two groups of two animals, with one group receiving 4H9-G1-LL37 and the other group receiving the control substance. Personnel involved in the calf handling were unaware of the treatment identity (single-blind study). During this 8-month trial, a total of 4 cohorts of 4 animals were recruited. There were two treatment groups: (i). 4H9-G1-LL37 test substance-treated, (ii) control substance-treated animals. All animals belonging to the same treatment group were statistically analyzed as one group, i.e. all data from the same treatment group were averaged across cohorts. The 4H9-G1-LL37 test substance-treated and control substance-treated animals were housed in separate BSL2 rooms. Prior to oocyst challenge at 36 h age, individual fecal samples were collected and examined for C. parvum oocysts by acid-fast staining and confirmed to be negative (Smith, 2008).",

Average scores for health parameters were calculated by averaging the scores among all animals of the same treatment and the same day. The best possible score for a healthy animal is 1, accordingly the worst score for a sick animal is 4. Statistical analysis was carried out using the modeling platform of JMP version 9 (SAS Institute, Cary, NC). A full factorial regression model was used with the following effects and interactions in the model: Cohort, Treatment, Cohort \u00d7 Treatment, Cohort \u00d7 Day, Treatment \u00d7 Day, Cohort \u00d7 Treatment \u00d7 Day. In the regression analysis time (Day) was treated as a continuous fixed effect variable. Day is modeled as a fixed effect using a knotted spline as described by Stone and Koo (1986). A regression model with time as a fixed effect was chosen rather than a repeated measures analysis because of the nature of the biological responses which are all non-random time-dependent responses each dependent on the timing of their measurement relative to the parasite challenge. In that regard the study is more akin to a pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic study where spline functions are used in the models. Use of the knotted splines makes possible direct area under the curve measures fitting of the biological patterns. Use of knotted splines is similar to the use of polynomial terms in the model but can more closely fit the experimental data. Details of an example output of the modeling platform for the oocyst shedding data can be found in Supplemental Fig. S1.",

Treatment efficacy was demonstrated by improved health parameters and reduced oocyst shedding in Cryptosporidium-infected calves, a reduction of fecal output in treated animals (data not shown) was not detected. From an epidemiologic perspective, reduction of oocyst shedding is an important factor in helping reduce the parasite pool in the environment. We are aware of the fact that a 50% overall reduction in oocyst shedding might not suffice to control the spread of the disease but it might make a significant contribution to a comprehensive Cryptosporidium control program of any given farm. A reduction of the parasite pool would result in reduced dairy herd infection as well as reduced likelihood of human exposure through direct contact at the farm or via drinking and recreational water supply contamination.",

            "text": "This study provides proof of concept for a novel biotherapeutic in a clinical model for cryptosporidiosis. The treatment regimen and dose that were chosen are largely based on previous efficacy data in the neonatal mouse model (Imboden et al., 2010) and based on the assumption that an initial elevated dose during the first 4 h after challenge is important to achieve a therapeutic effect. Whether the subsequent regimen consisting of 12-h interval dosing had a positive or negative impact on the natural, asynchronous life cycle of Cryptosporidium and exposure of extracellular stages during the infection is not known. However, this successful proof of concept study serves as the starting point for further development of antibody\u2013biocide fusion efficacy trials. In an effort to test treatment regimens that are more adaptable to field applications on a dairy farm, we will focus on testing less frequent treatment schedules, and lower treatment doses. To generate more field-like conditions, future trials will also include more animals and lower but multiple challenge doses. Lower challenge doses than that used in the present study have been shown by others to induce diarrhea in large numbers of calves with 100% infection rates and lower oocyst numbers shed (Moore et al., 2003, Perryman et al., 1999). As we see a dose-dependent efficacy of our product in mice (Imboden et al., 2010) it is likely that a lower oocyst challenge number which results in a lower number of shed oocysts would allow a lower treatment dose of our antibody fusion product to achieve efficacy.",
