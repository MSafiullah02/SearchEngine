Since then, known as COVID-19 disease, the responsible viral pathogen, SARS-CoV-2, has spread around the world in a pandemic. Decisions on how to deal with the crisis are often based on simulations of the pandemic spread of the virus. The results of some of these, as well as their methodology and possibilities for improvement, will be described in more detail in this paper in order to inform beyond the current public health dogma called \"flatten-the-curve\".",

Therefore, while some countries are at an early stage of the crisis, as evidenced by the low number of new infections confirmed daily, other populations in the world may already be much more seriously affected. China and South Korea, for example, are already planning to return to normal life (1, 2) , but elsewhere the situation is becoming increasingly dramatic. These differences result in an inhomogeneous data situation; in addition, different fundamental conditions of countries make it difficult to mutually compare situations. Creating simulation models that allow a (realistic) prediction of the pandemic virus spread is a difficult task. The basic theories on which such models are based are as old as they are complex. Thus, with this thesis I would like to contribute to the understanding of these and to present results from previous publications relevant to this topic.",

With this tool, (SEIR) simulations can be easily visualized in a browser. By default, the hospitalisation rate (severe-cases) is given there as follows, but it can be adjusted individually. The underlying model uses data on health care and demography of a given country. However, parameters are not (yet) adapted to current knowledge (as of 29.03.2020, (10)). In order to adjust the simulation in the appendix to more recent data, we have therefore changed the parameters for the proportion of severe cases according to the ICL paper as it can be seen in Figure 6 . In summary, the third assessment of the online tool shown is probably the most pessimistic, as it is based so far only on data from countries particularly affected by the crisis. It has been shown that a collapse of the health care system quickly pushes up the death rate. The ICL, on the other hand, predicts a lower probability of hospitalisation and severe courses of disease in older patients (80+).",

Although the simulation models available today are already very comprehensively designed (some of them even include global traffic flows and demographics in their datasets (10,20-22)), an unmanageable number of influencing factors remain, which cannot all be taken into account mathematically. Depending on which model is used to determine the reproduction number, it will be lower or higher. If the growth curve begins to flatten out, it is probably worth adjusting the models and taking into account subexponential growth by assuming other growth processes as exponential growth, i.e. logistic growth or generalized growth, in order to realistically estimate R t . The presented study (4) provides a good framework for such models to build on. Whether, and which measures are sufficient for a permanent reduction of the reproduction number has not yet been confirmed. It is a fact, however, that a relaxation of restrictions or non-compliance with rules increases the transmission rate and can quickly lead to a renewed rise in the curve in the worst case. Detection of such events through monitoring and rapid follow-up in case of occurrence offers potential to prevent this.",
