A recent study [1] published by the Imperial College London changed the stance of the UK government towards COVID-19, changing it from \u201cherd immunity\u201d to a more \u201cpragmatic approach\u201d. In the field of pharmacy practice, the research has increased manifold; however, the impact of this research is less visible at the global level. This editorial discusses health services research in pharmacy highlighting how building an encyclopaedia or a major reference work (MRW) would be useful to enhance the visibility and impact of this research.",
