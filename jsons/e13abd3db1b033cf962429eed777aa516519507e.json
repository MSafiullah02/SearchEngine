One driver of the transmission of the virus in nursing homes has been delays in implementing appropriate infection control protocols (3) . We know that achieving effective quarantine or isolation is challenging in residents with dementia, whose compromised cognitive functioning, insight and judgment impact their capacity to voluntarily comply with restrictions . In this commentary, we will discuss important barriers to achieving isolation in this population, including the need for ethical and clinical frameworks to guide rapid and decisive decision-making. We also provide a case 4 vignette illustrating an approach to safe, effective and compassionate quarantine of an older adult with dementia.",

A pre-pandemic systematic review identified that some common features of outbreaks in nursing homes are delay in the implementation of control measures, and insufficient application of isolation and cohorting (5) . In particular, the perception that infection control practices are in conflict with quality of life goals and the rights of the resident are an important barrier to their effective use (6) . Several features of the COVID-19 infection -the duration of the incubation period, asymptomatic spread, and atypical presentations in older adults-represent challenges to infection control in nursing homes. Isolating and screening nursing home residents based on symptoms alone would fail to identify approximately half of residents with COVID-19 (7) . Widespread screening in nursing homes may be required, which will identify both symptomatic and asymptomatic COVID-19 positive residents who need to be isolated. Nursing home staff are experiencing moral distress due to the potential harms associated isolation of residents, as well as the severe consequences if these infection control measures are not effectively implemented.",

From an ethical perspective, the context of a pandemic shifts priorties towards the protection of a population (in this case, the other residents and staff), while providing safeguards for individual rights. Principles used to balance the individual rights with collective safety include use of the least restrictive alternative to achieve effective infection control, addressing fairness and justice, and providing transparency and accountability in decision-making to maintain public trust (10) . These public health principles are in contrast to the principles which have guided dementia care best practices over the past few decades, with a focus on relational ethics and the ethics of care, and emphasizing trust and responsiveness within the individual therapeutic relationship (11, 12) . The use of an ethical framework addressing these conflicts can help to support and guide ethical decision-making (13) .",

While international guidance has been consistent in recommending isolation of residents of nursing homes with confirmed or suspected COVID-19 (1), none of these guidelines directly address the practical challenges faced when trying to isolate people with dementia effectively while maintaining their safety and human dignity.",

Second, there is a need for guidance about the use of pharmacological management, seculsion, and physical restraint measures when less restrictive measures have failed. In the case vignette, we describe the safe and effective use of some of these measures and the steps taken to minimize harm, in a well-resourced setting.",

A door exit alarm (15) was used to notify us if she was leaving or another resident was entering the room, but staff responding to the alarm were often faced with directing Mrs. X without time to don PPE. Given that less restrictive measures were not consistently effective, the decision was made to use physical restraints when necessary. Mrs. X was restrained in a geriatric recliner using a pelvic holder with three staff in PPE required to safely initiate restraint. A tray table allowed her to engage in preferred activities and to hold snacks and drinks. In keeping with hospital policies, she was restrained at intervals no longer than two hours, and she was monitored and socially engaged by staff every 15 minutes for the first hour and every 30 minutes thereafter. If she fell asleep, she was assisted into bed. From the perspective of pharmacological management, her antipsychotic medication was changed to a more sedating agent, loxapine 5mg BID, and increased to 10mg BID three days later, with loxapine 5mg used as needed.",
