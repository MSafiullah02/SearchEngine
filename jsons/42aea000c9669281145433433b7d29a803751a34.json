While novel immunosuppressive regimens have improved allograft survival and function, combined with surgical complications, these predispose transplant recipients to infectious complications [1, 2] . Invasive fungal infections (IFIs) are particularly concerning in this population due to the associated high morbidity and mortality [1] . The most common IFIs in SOT recipients are candidiasis, aspergillosis, cryptococcosis, and those caused by endemic fungi such as Blastomyces, Coccidioides, and Histoplasma [3] . The incidence of IFIs varies according to type of organ transplant, and the risk of infection changes over time based on host state of immunosuppression and many fungal factors (e.g., virulence and resistance of fungi) [2, 4] . In this chapter, we review epidemiology, clinical presentation, diagnosis, and treatment of fungal infections due to yeast and endemic fungi in SOT recipients.",

The median time to cryptococcosis ranges between 16 and 21 months posttransplantation, although time to onset was earlier (<12 months) in liver and lung transplant recipients possibly related to the more intense immunosuppression they receive compared to other types of transplants [16, 17] . A recent multicenter study suggested that lung transplant recipients are at highest risk of cryptococcosis [18] .

            "text": "The timing of IFIs posttransplantation is typically divided into three intervals based on the risk and type of IFIs: early (0-1 month), intermediate (1-6 months) , and late (>6 months). Infections in the early interval are similar to that in nonimmunocompromised patients postoperatively, usually due to surgical complications, nosocomial, or donor-derived infections [3] . Candida species are the common cause of IFIs in the early period. The intermediate interval has the most frequent IFIs as immunosuppression plays a major role, while the effects of surgical and nosocomial factors decrease. IC is less common, while mold infections due to aspergillosis, mucormycosis, scedosporiosis, or other molds predominate [3] . By late stage when 80% of SOT recipients are maintained on minimal chronic immunosuppression, the risk of IFIs declines [2] . The predominant fungal pathogens in this interval are Cryptococcus and endemic fungi, but mold infections such as aspergillosis and mucormycosis are possible and may occur at any time posttransplantation [3, 17] . The net state of immunosuppression is an important determinant of the overall risk of infection and involves a number of host and environmental factors. Host factors include underlying immune defects; extrinsic factors such as loss of integrity of mucocutaneous barriers and surgical complications; dose, duration, and sequence of immunosuppressive therapy; and environmental exposures to specific pathogens (Table 13. 2) [23, 24] . Other risk factors that are specific to the type of organ transplant include the type of anastomosis or drainage, intensity of immunosuppression especially in the immediate posttransplantation period, and postoperative complications (anastomotic leak, ischemia, thrombosis, fluid collection, and the presence of foreign bodies) (Table 13. 3) [2, [23] [24] [25] [26] [27] [28] [29] [30] [31] [32] [33] [34] [35] [36] .",

Calcineurin inhibitors (CNIs) (such as cyclosporine and tacrolimus) have synergistic antifungal activity against C. neoformans isolates, and thus, cryptococcal disease in SOT recipients manifests with skin and soft tissue disease rather than CNS disease owing to the antifungal activity of tacrolimus at 37-39 \u00b0C and the lower skin temperatures [38] . Episodes of rejection pose a particular risk for IFIs as patients receive pulse doses of glucocorticoids, intensified immunosuppressive therapy, ATG, and monoclonal antibodies as well as they experience high rates of cytomegalovirus (CMV) reactivation which can contribute to IFIs and immunosuppression [37] .

Also, Candida contamination of preservation fluid has been associated with posttransplantation infections in renal and liver transplant recipients [39, 40] . In a study of graft-site infections in renal transplant recipients, the incidence was 1 case per 1000 grafts [41] . A recent case of C. auris was transmitted during lung transplantation [42] . Of note, early cases of cryptococcosis were reported posttransplantation especially in liver transplant recipients that were attributed to unrecognized pretransplant or donor-derived infections [14] . Donorderived infections due to Histoplasma and Coccidioides but not Blastomyces have been reported [43] .",

Early antifungal therapy for suspected candidemia has been associated with better outcomes in patients with candidemia [79, 80] . Fluconazole can be used as first-line in patients with mild-moderate disease and who are unlikely to have infections with fluconazoleresistance Candida species [64] . The use of an echinocandin is now strongly recommended in the treatment of candidemia [64] , especially in SOT patients with hemodynamic instability or with previous exposures to azoles or colonized with Candida species resistant to azoles [81] . Liposomal amphotericin B (AmB) or an azole should be used when other IFIs are suspected due to the limited activity of echinocandins, but the use of AmB is limited but its toxicities. Monitoring drug levels is important as azoles are potent inhibitors of liver cytochrome P-450 CYP3A4 and can increase the levels of CNIs, everolimus, and sirolimus [35, 82] . Patients with candidemia should have repeated blood cultures every 48-72 h until it is cleared, and central venous catheters should be removed as soon as possible. It is also strongly recommended to do a dilated fundoscopic exam in these patients [64] . Management of anastomotic tracheobronchitis should include using inhaled or systemic AmB. Treatment of other manifestations of IC is outlined in Table 13 .7. Guidelines for the treatment of cryptococcosis in SOT patients are mostly based on clinical trial data among HIV patients [49, 58] . In order to choose the right antifungal therapy, it is essential to define the extent and severity of disease as well as the net state of immunosuppression. Identifying localized pulmonary from disseminated disease and sites of involvement including CNS helps to define the extent of disease. When meningeal disease is suspected, an LP should be done for CSF analysis, CSF CrAg, and opening pressure. This can also have therapeutic implications to relieve elevated intracranial pressure (ICP) to \u226420 cm.",
