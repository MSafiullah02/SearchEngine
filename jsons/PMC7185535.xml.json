Berne virus (EToV Berne), the first isolated ToV, was isolated from a horse with diarrhea in 1972 in Switzerland (Weiss et al., 1983). In 1979, a bovine ToV (BToV), named Breda virus, was detected in calves with diarrhea in the United States (US). BToV Breda causes enteric disease in gnotobiotic reared calves (Woode et al., 1982). BToVs are found throughout the world including North America (Hoet et al., 2002, Hoet et al., 2003), Central America (P\u00e9rez et al., 1998), Europe (Haschek et al., 2006, Koopmans et al., 1991, Matiz et al., 2002), Asia (Aita et al., 2012, Ito et al., 2010, Park et al., 2008) and South Africa (Penrith and Gerdes, 1992). BToVs have been detected in 2.9\u201336.4% of fecal samples obtained from cattle with diarrhea (Duckmanton et al., 1998, Hoet et al., 2003, Ito et al., 2007, Kirisawa et al., 2007, Nogueira et al., 2013, Park et al., 2008). Porcine ToV (PToV) is also prevalent in piglets worldwide; however their pathogenicity in swine remains unclear (Anbalagan et al., 2014, Shin et al., 2010, Sun et al., 2014).",

The phylogenetic trees of S and N coding regions were constructed without these strains. The four Japanese BToVs branched separately from BToV Breda1, and clustered with PToV strains in the 5\u2032UTR, ORF1a, ORF1b, N, and 3\u2032UTR phylogenetic trees (Fig. 3\nA-C, H and I). In addition, Japanese BToVs in this study together with other BToV strains from Japan and other countries selected from GenBank, clustered with BToV Breda1 but not with PToVs in the S, M, and HE phylogenetic trees (Fig. 3D-G). Ito et al. classified Japanese BToVs using 5\u2032 portion of S coding region into three genotypes, Clusters 1\u20133 (Ito et al., 2007, Ito et al., 2009, and 2010). In the phylogenetic tree, the 5\u2032 portion of S coding region of BToVs in this study showed that BToV Ishi and BToV Tochi clustered with Cluster-1 and Cluster-2 strains, respectively, while BToV Kago and BToV Tokyo clustered with Cluster-3 strain, though enough bootstrap support could not be obtained. (Fig. 3D). BToV Tochi separately clustered with BToV Ishi, BToV Kago, and BToV Tokyo in the S (21,693\u201325,548), M, and HE phylogenetic trees (Fig. 3E-G).",

We could obtain a sufficient number of sequence reads and contigs of nearly 28 kb from 0.25 ml of 105.3\n TCID50/mL BToV Ishi cell culture supernatant. Only one sample among three 0.25-mL fecal suspension samples gave a sufficient number of sequence reads and large contigs, though the number of sequence reads from this sample was lower than that from the viral culture supernatant. Unfortunately, we could not isolate BToV from fecal sample of BToV Kago by using HRT-18-Aich cells, which are useful for BToV isolation (Aita et al., 2012, Ito et al., 2012, Kuwabara et al., 2007), possibly because the samples could not be preserved at \u2212 20 \u00b0C at the veterinary clinic. Although numerous sequence reads originating from bacterial species and hosts might interfere and reduce the number of sequence reads from fecal suspensions, the whole genome sequence of BToV could be obtained from this sample by using our deep-sequencing strategy.",

Smits et al. provided evidence for recombination of ToV sequences between BToV Breda1 and PToV in the HE coding region (Smits et al., 2003). Italian and Dutch BToVs identified before the year 2000 were reported to possess a single recombination breakpoint located approximately 1100 nucleotides from the ATG initiation codon of the HE coding region. The putative recombinant breakpoint in the HE coding region of Japanese BToVs was quite identical to that of European BToVs. In the phylogenetic tree analyses, Japanese BToVs were found to be closely related to European BToVs in S, M, HE, and N coding regions. These findings suggest that Japanese BToVs and European BToVs have a common ancestor. However, owing to the lack of sequence information of 5\u2032UTR, ORF1a and ORF 1b of European BToVs, we could not further compare Japanese BToVs with European BToVs. The HE coding region of ToV shares sequence homology to that of coronavirus and influenza C virus, however it is suggested that HE region of these viruses were introduced through independent heterologous recombination events (Smits et al., 2005). Homologous recombination of HE coding region was also reported in PToVs (Cong et al., 2013, Smits et al., 2003), suggesting that the HE coding region may be a hot spot for recombination events.",

Approximately 76% of the genomes of BToV Ishi and BToV Kago are similar to that of PToV. Natural recombination events are common in coronaviruses, resulting in evolution and emergence of new variants that are pathogenic to poultry, cats, pigs, and humans (Graham and Baric, 2010, Herrewegh et al., 1998, Hewson et al., 2014, Lau et al., 2015, Song et al., 2013, Terada et al., 2014, Tian et al., 2014, Wang et al., 2015, Zhang et al., 2015a, Zhang et al., 2015b, Zhao et al., 2013). Co-infection of certain cells in bovine or swine with BToV Breda1 type virus and PToV is a pre-requisite for the generation of new recombinant viruses by double-template switch.
