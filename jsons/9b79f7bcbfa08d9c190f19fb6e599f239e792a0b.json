In a retrospective, single-centre study in Wuhan, 41% of 138 patients were thought to have acquired infection in hospital. 19 At the Royal Gwent Hospital in Newport, Wales, approximately half of the emergency room workforce have tested positive. 20 Blanket testing near Venice, Italy, helped to identify asymptomatic cases and might have helped eliminate SARS-CoV-2 in a village. 21 Moreover, asymptomatic and presymptomatic HCWs continue to commute to places of work where personal protective equipment (PPE) might be suboptimal. This disease spread could, in turn, propagate out of hospitals: during a period of lockdown asymptomatic COVID-19 carriage among hospital staff could conceivably act as a potent source of ongoing transmission.",
