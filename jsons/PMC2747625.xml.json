The WHO draws on a wide range of data sources\nto quantify global and regional effects of diseases, the details of which are not\ndiscussed here, however are available on their websites [Tables S5 and\nS6] (www.who.int). When statistics were not available through the WHO, we\nused the peer-reviewed literature and/or personal communication with experts in the\nrespective fields. Further validation was sought for these figures by contacting\nsubject matter experts (SMEs) to confirm the accuracy of estimates and timeframes.\nBecause morbidity and mortality data for individual pathogens/diseases are acquired\nat different yearly intervals, data derived from a single year could not be\ndetermined for all of the pathogens included herein. The majority of the figures\nwere available for years 2004\u20132008, however, some figures were older than\n2004 and have been noted. Accurate and reliable burden of disease estimates are\ncurrently difficult to assess as a result of inconsistent data collection and/or\nreporting, especially in the developing world. Therefore, the majority of the data\nshown presented herein are likely underestimates. The majority of the prevalence\ndata represents case estimates by the WHO, unless otherwise noted as actual reported\ncases.",

These were selected\nbased on the most prevalent disease categories for which sound epidemiological data\nexisted. For example, within the broader categories such as single stranded,\npositive sense RNA viruses, we selected prominent pathogens such as measles virus,\nRSV, Mumps, rabies virus, Ebola virus and all influenza viruses as representative of\nthe group. Preliminary prevalence and mortality figures were then assigned to each\npathogen using the WHO web page (WHO fact sheets). In order to verify that our data\ncorresponds with what is currently accepted within the scientific community a list\nof subject matter experts (SME) was generated using the ISI web of knowledge site\n[apps.isiknowledge.com]. Under the Web of Science tab, the terms\n\u201cmorbidity or prevalence or mortality and disease x\u201d were\napplied in order to flag the top 5 experts within each disease-specific field based\non their total number of publications. Subject matter experts were then formally\ncontacted by email to seek independent validation of the preliminary figures.\nPrevalence and mortality numbers were then adjusted, if warranted, to those provided\nby the SMEs. On average, three authors were emailed for each disease in order to\nobtain validation. Diseases, for which reliable figures could not be found and/or\nwere not available through the SMEs, were excluded from this part of the\nanalysis.",
