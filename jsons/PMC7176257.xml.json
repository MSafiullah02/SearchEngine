These membranes are derived from the host cell, and among other purposes, serve to protect the internal components of the virus from immune recognition. While protective, the membrane is also a barrier: to infect a cell, enveloped viruses must breach not only the target host membrane, but also their own membranes. To do so, they utilize energy stored in metastable viral spikes that protrude through the viral membrane [6]. These spikes also target the virus to specific receptors on host cells, prior to the fusion event. Together, these processes facilitate entry of the viral genome to the host cell.\n",

            "text": "Three gp120 envelope glycoproteins associate non-covalently with three gp41 transmembrane molecules to form the functional viral spike (reviewed in [11]]. Despite extensive effort, by our group and others, the trimeric functional spike has so far resisted atomic-level structure determination. Recent low resolution cryo-electron microscopy (EM) studies have provided insight into possible gp120-gp41 subunit arrangements within a functional viral spike [12, 13]. Information from cryo-EM studies is being used in our efforts to design candidate Env molecules amenable to high resolution crystallographic analysis. Part of the difficulty in structurally characterizing the functional spike relates to the biology of HIV-1. Both gp120 and gp41 components of the viral spike undergo conformational rearrangements during viral entry (Fig. 39.2). The binding by the gp120 component to the CD4 receptor is believed to induce large structural rearrangements [14, 15], which are required for the formation of the binding site for a requisite coreceptor [16], generally CXCR4 or CCR5 (reviewed in [17, 18]). The gp41 component then utilizes a large conformational change, involving formation of a trimeric \u201cpost-fusion\u201d coiled-coil [19-23], to fuse the viral and target cell membranes. Since the \u201cpre-fusion\u201d conformation of the viral spike [24] is believed to be the primary target for elicitation of neutralizing antibody, we have sought to understand its conformation in atomic-level detail.\n",

In an effort to obtain well-diffracting crystals of the \u201cpre-fusion\u201d trimeric viral spike, we have utilized heterologous trimerization domains as well as ligands and chemical/mutational modifications to enhance protein stability. Most of the viral spikes that we have constructed have mutations that prevent the proteolytic cleavage of gp41 from gp120, which increases protein stability and ease of production. However, since cleaved viral spikes are antigenically and structurally distinct from uncleaved spikes, and represent the functional form of the molecule, methods for creating cleaved viral spikes are being optimized. gp41 peptides are currently being developed that bind to the N and C termini of gp120 and the co-crystallization of other published peptides is also being pursued [25].",

One line involves the delineation of functional constraints to identify potential footholds of conservation and exposure. We have investigated antibodies, called CD4-induced antibodies that bind to the co-receptor-binding site on gp120. These were found capable of neutralizing not only HIV-1, but also the more evolutionarily divergent HIV-2 [34]. They also accumulate to high titers in most HIV-1 infected individuals [34]. Unfortunately, the virus effectively hides the site of co-receptor binding prior to CD4 engagement [34, 35]. After CD4 engagement at the cell surface, the close proximity of the target-cell membrane sterically occludes potential sites of vulnerability on the co-receptor-binding site [36]. These studies demonstrate that functional constraints restrict epitope variation but do not necessarily expose epitopes sensitive to antibody neutralization. We are currently exploring whether the functional constraint of binding to the CD4 receptor, which \u2014 unlike the co-receptor-binding site \u2014 must be available as an initial site of attachment [1], can provide a site of vulnerability to neutralizing antibodies.",

Only four antibodies that neutralize the primary isolates have thus far been characterized-the monoclonal antibodies 2F5, 2G12, 4E10, and b12 [37\u201340]. We have determined the structures of 2F5 and b12, each with their HIV-1 envelope epitopes [1, 41] (Fig. 39.3). In the case of the broadly neutralizing 2F5 antibody, the structure of the membrane-proximal external region of gp41, when bound by 2F5, was found to adopt an extended loop conformation \u2013 distinct from unbound structures of this region, which largely adopt alpha-helical conformations [41]. These structural differences prompted the hypothesis that the inability of existing immunogens against this region to elicit 2F5-like antibodies may partly be due to a lack of proper antigenic mimicry of the 2F5-bound form of gp41. In collaboration with Drs. David Baker and Bill Schief at the University of Washington, techniques of computational protein design are being used to develop heterologous epitope scaffolds that possess conformational mimics of the 2F5-bound form of gp41 on their surfaces. These epitope scaffolds not only provide a means for structural mimicry, but also serve to focus the immune response to specific sites within otherwise complex structures.\n",

These alternative forms include trimeric mimics of the viral spike, monomeric variants of gp120, domain versions of gp120 that retain b12 binding, and epitope-scaffold mimics believed to be unencumbered by most Env-based mechanisms of humoral evasion.

Such antibodies comprise a high percentage of the elicited antibody response in HIV-1 infected individuals. We have succeeded in determining the structure of F105 in complex with gp120 (Lei Chen and Young Do Kwon, personal communication). F105 is a prototypical CD4BS antibody and has been tested in Phase I clinical trials [42]: it shows broad recognition of monomeric gp120, competes with CD4 for binding, and neutralizes laboratory-adapted \u2013 but not primary \u2013 isolates of HIV-1. Analysis of the epitopes on gp120 for F105, b12 and CD4 shows they all bind to a very closely related site on gp120. Despite their similarity, one large difference we find is that the region that makes up the bridging sheet in the CD4-bound conformation of gp120 opens up in the F105-gp120 structure. Strands \u03b220/\u03b221 open to uncover a conserved hydrophobic surface, which serves as a focus of F105 binding. This suggests that antibodies like F105 need to access the hydrophobic region under the bridging sheet. To define F105 as a prototype for non-neutralizing CD4BS antibodies, we tethered the \u03b220/\u03b221 strands to the inner domain with a disulfide and observed inhibition of binding for most CD4BS antibodies, though not b12 or CD4. Thus, this result highlights the importance of occluding the hydrophobic region under the bridging sheet in vaccine immunogens designed to elicit b12-like antibodies, and also provides another example for how atomic-level structural information can be used in the development of a successful HIV vaccine.",

Biphenyl moiety of CD4M33 reaches into the deep Phe43 cavity in a way that no side chains of natural amino acids can emulate [49]. Furthermore these structures show that small molecules and miniproteins bind exactly the same gp120 conformation as CD4 binds and suggest that these molecules are useful not only for therapeutic purpose but also for exposing potential vulnerable sites on gp120 for neutralizing antibodies.",

N-linked glycan, for example, when added to a particular region of a protein appears to dramatically reduce the immunogenicity of that region [50, 51]. As the sequon controlling N-linked glycosylation (Asn-X-Ser/Thr) can be introduced into an immunogen in a structure-specific manner, glycan-silencing allows for targeted immunosilencing (Fig. 39.5a). A related strategy utilizes PEG-chemical modification to generate protein-PEG adducts [52\u201354]. Because PEG molecules can be specifically coupled to lysine residues, and lysines can be introduced in a structurally specific manner, such PEG-Lys immunosilencing can also be carried out in a structure-specific manner (Fig. 39.5b).\n",

For example, studies done in collaboration with Dr. Richard Wyatt\u2019s group at the Vaccine Research Center have demonstrated the ability of conformational stabilization to focus immune response [55]. When gp120 monomers were stabilized in the CD4-bound conformation with multiple disulfides and used for immunization in rabbits, they elicited a stronger response of neutralizing CD4i antibodies than the native monomer. These studies demonstrate that structure-directed conformational stabilization can alter the quality and magnitude of the humoral immune response to a desired epitope. Though the CD4i antibodies elicited in this study are not potent against primary isolates, this proof of concept study bolsters our confidence that structure guided immunogen modification which leads to exposure and stabilization of vulnerable sites on the HIV envelope, elicits high titers of antibodies against a specific epitope. The precise design of a gp120 monomer in the receptor-stabilized conformation was possible because of the availability of a crystal structure of gp120 bound to CD4 and the CD4i antibody-17b. We expect atomic-level structures of the trimeric spike to enable similar precise design of immunogens with optimal exposure of stabilized vulnerable epitopes of the HIV envelope.",

We have assessed a number of expression systems for expressing HIV-1 Env glycoproteins suitable for structural analysis (Table 39.1), and currently employ a mammalian cell-based transient transfection system for protein production (Fig. 39.6). However, high-resolution structural analysis has been hindered by difficulties in producing adequate amounts of stable HIV-1 recombinant envelope trimers. Interestingly, poor viral spike expression has also been observed for other members of the class I family of viral fusion proteins, including HIV-2/SIV, coronaviruses, and retroviruses. To address this problem, we have used glycosidase processing inhibitors, multiple transfection reagents and several target cell types to optimize trimer expression, glycan processing, and cost efficiency (Fig. 39.6). At the moment, we are testing the effects of different signal sequences and trimerization domains on viral spike expression.\n\n",

Thus, for example, to obtain a complex of a CD4-induced antibody with gp120, 5 CD4-induced antibodies were combined with 3 different Clade B gp120s to make 15 different complexes. Each of the 15 complexes was then assessed for crystallization, enhancing the overall probability of obtaining crystals suitable for structural analysis [29].

Following endocytosis, the glycoprotein is cleaved by cathepsin B and/or cathepsin L in the acidic endosome environment and potentially triggers membrane fusion, which subsequently allows for the entry of the Ebola nucleocapsid into the cell cytoplasm [73).",

One of the methods that can be employed to immunofocus the response is silencing regions that are not biologically relevant or known to elicit an unfavorable immune response. For example, the human neutralizing antibody, KZ52, binds to GP1:GP2 residues in the base region of the trimer [3]. We can effectively focus the immunogen to elicit antibodies to the conserved trimer core through the addition of glycans to specific resides to which KZ52 binds. Another approach is to remove the highly glycosylated mucin-like region, which may play a role in providing the ultimate virus immune evasion strategy. Removal of this region also focuses the immune response to the exposed highly conserved receptor binding core. Our current immunogen approach, to target the highly conserved receptor-binding domain, may also result in generating protection against many, if not all, Ebola virus strains. Knowledge of the crystal structure of the prefusion Ebola glycoprotein also allows us to create recombinant proteins that mimic the processed glycoprotein that may represent a conserved but otherwise inaccessible form of the protein that may be sensitive to neutralization.",

The head region of HA recognizes terminal sialic acid (i.e. the receptor) on the surface of the host cell to facilitate viral internalization.

However, influenza A is highly variable and currently consists of 16 known immunological subtypes of HA and 9 subtypes of NA combined in a multitude of reassorted strains. To date, most human infections have resulted from H1N1, H1N2, H2N2, and H3N2 strains, although more recently 390 cases of highly pathogenic H5N1 infections and a handful of H7 and H9 infections of humans have been reported [77]. In total, over 6,000 different strains of influenza are now known to infect humans [78]. Influenza is highly immunogenic; vaccines created from inactivated or live-attenuated virus are generally effective without the need for a booster shot or the use of adjuvants. Unfortunately, selective pressure from the immune system of hosts combined with an error prone viral RNA polymerase promotes rapid mutation of the influenza viral surface proteins (referred to as antigenic drift) as well as genetic reassortments. As a result, new trivalent vaccines need to be generated each year using the strains of H1N1, H3N2 and B-type influenza that are predicted to be in circulation six months later during the upcoming flu season [79]. Not only does this require a significant outpouring of time and resources every year, but the predictions regarding upcoming influenza strains are not always on target. Furthermore, a large unpredicted human outbreak from a pathogenic avian subtype such as H5N1 would not be covered by current vaccines.",

More recently Kashyap and colleagues reported on broadly neutralizing human monoclonal antibodies that neutralize divergent H1 and H5 strains [81]. These reports suggest that conserved regions of HA can elicit broadly neutralizing antibodies. When sequence conservation is mapped onto the three-dimensional structure of HA, it is evident that the stem region consisting mostly of HA2 is much more conserved than the HA1-head region (Fig. 9b). Since most neutralizing HA epitopes are located on the highly variable head region, we are presently exploring methods to immunofocus antibodies to the conserved HA-stem. The methods we are employing include PEG/glycan silencing, antigenic resurfacing and protein truncation of immunodominant regions as well as removal of native glycosylation and conformational stabilization (Fig. 9c). Our ultimate goal is to design an influenza immunogen that will elicit antibodies that broadly neutralize not only against multiple strains but even against multiple subtypes of influenza over time spans of many years.",

Whether such basic science discoveries will provide benefits to public health depends on our ability to translate them from the laboratory to the clinic, a critical step facilitated by close interactions with other laboratories at the center.

(Top row) Schematics of the viral spike (gp120 in red and gp41 in tan) are shown, first in the context of free HIV-1 virion (left-most image), then binding to CD4 (yellow) at the target cell surface. Binding to CD4 induces conformational changes that assemble the binding site for a requisite co-receptor (teal). Binding to co-receptor results in further conformational changes: the fusion peptide at the N-terminus of gp41 is thrown into the target cell membrane; the gp41 C-terminus rearranges to form the final coiled-coil structure with gp41 N and C termini in close proximity (right-most image). (Bottom row) Atomic-level structure of monomeric gp120 and trimeric gp41 are shown in C\u03b1-ribbon representation.

N-linked glycan are colored blue and the surface of gp120 is colored red, expect for regions corresponding to Lys residues (colored yellow) or within 10 \u00c5 of a lysine (colored gray). The HXBc2 core with V3 is shown in the left image, and the Lys-optimized core is shown in the right image. As can be seen, structure-based optimization allows the b12 binding surface to be free of Lys, and to improve coverage of the rest of the gp120 surface (for example, of the V3 loop).

A construct encoding a clade A gp140 (fibritin trimerization domain appended C-terminal to the gp41 ectodomain) was tested in transient transfections on 293Freestyle cells (293F), Chinese Hamster Ovary cells (CHO) and 293GnTi- cells (GnTi-).

Good diffraction data is solved for the crystal structure of the protein or protein complex. The Crystal Optimization Cycle is used for optimizing the initial crystallization screening conditions, and for optimizing conditions which result in poor crystals. Imaging data is scored manually, which is used to generate a new crystallization matrix, referred to as an optimized screen.

It adopts an open chalice-like shape of GP1 (each monomer is a different shade of orange), held together by a belt of GP2 (monomers shown in various shades of green). The receptor-binding domain is localized between residues 54 and 201 of GP1 (88), of which 6 residues of known critical importance for virus entry have been mapped onto the structure (shown in blue). These residues are located in the head region, which itself is surrounded by a glycan cap containing several N-linked glycan sites (shown in red).
