In addition, there are numerous bacterial zoonoses, fungal zoonoses and the emergence of variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease. Avian influenza H5N1 was detected in a domestic cat eating a bird carcass. The authors expressed concern regarding disease transmission to people from household cats. 2 In the United States, pets are present in 58% of the households, which includes about 69 million cats and 62 million dogs. 3 Owners of cats and dogs are likely to have as much contact with their pets as with people. Of the emerging diseases, \u223c75% are zoonoses. When the disease is known to be a zoonosis and the species of origin understood, the role of animals is fairly straightforward.",
