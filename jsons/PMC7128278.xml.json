First detected in September, 2012, in a patient who had died of an acute respiratory illness in Saudi Arabia,4 it was soon confirmed in a Qatari patient with a similar illness in London, UK. These cases triggered collaborations between the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia Ministry of Health (KSA-MoH), Qatar, and other global partners. The immediate need was to ensure the safety of the 3 million pilgrims attending the Hajj pilgrimage in October, 2012. Testing of pilgrims before and after Hajj 2012, and case based surveillance for the novel coronavirus during Hajj, suggested that the virus was not in circulation at the time.7\n",

Ascertainment of the country of initial infection remains unclear and at least three cases had a history of travel to another country (including Pakistan and Egypt). Eight cases occurred in three clusters, and 13 required intensive care. In the UK cluster, three members of the same family were infected: one individual had recently travelled to Pakistan and Saudi Arabia, whereas the other two had no recent travel history,8 suggesting person to person transmission. Although two of the cases had severe respiratory symptoms, one had mild symptoms suggesting a range of clinical expression. Contacts of the UK cases have been identified by the HPA and KSA-MoH, and follow-up tests have so far been negative for the molecular targets of the novel coronavirus.8\n",

Because of the global nature of religious and sporting events, active surveillance of the participants is of paramount global importance. A unique opportunity now exists for global collaboration, with transparent sharing of information as was done during the SARS outbreak, to improve elucidation of the risks associated with the novel coronavirus so that another SARS-like epidemic does not begin to spread undetected. Collaborations with other consortia such as the International Severe Acute Respiratory and Emerging Infection Consortium will ensure that the lessons from the SARS epidemic are applied to provide a valuable resource for risk assessment, surveillance, and response in accordance with the international health regulations.",
