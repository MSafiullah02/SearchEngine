They cause annual epidemics of varying severity, including mild common cold symptoms to severe lung injury with fatal outcome. IAVs, on which we focus in this review, show a very wide variety and thus are further subgrouped by the antigenic properties of their surface proteins hemagglutinin (HA) and neuraminidase (NA). Besides the well-defined strains circulating in humans (of the subgroups H1N1 and H3N2), IAVs are present in a large number of mammalian species, poultry, and particularly wild birds, with currently 18 or 11 variants known for HA or NA, respectively, where the recently discovered bat-isolates H17/18 and N10/11 seem to be quite distinct from avian and mammalian strains.5\n6\n",

Thus\u2014and due to other reasons such as close proximity to domestic poultry\u2014it has been proposed that the Asian continent represents a particular \u201creservoir\u201d for not only endemic human but also zoonotic influenza virus strains.8\n9 Overall, seasonal IAV affects up to 10% of the adult population and 20% of children annually10 and displays a substantial morbidity. A cohort study estimates that between 2003 and 2009 in the United States, seasonal influenza was responsible for 3.8% of all admissions for respiratory failure and evaluates the incidence of influenza-associated acute respiratory failure at 2.7 per 100,000 persons per year.11 This results in considerable clinical and economic burden. For the United States, direct medical costs covering health care for influenza-induced illness as well as economic losses due to lost working days and declined production are proposed to account for at least 26 billion USD annually.12\n",

            "text": "The first step of IAV replication in the human host is the cell attachment, when the virion binds via the viral surface protein HA to sialic acids (SAs) expressed on the upper or lower airway or alveolar epithelial cell. While avian epithelia highly express \u03b12,3-linked SA, the \u03b12,6-linked SA is predominant in the human trachea. After attachment, virions enter the endosomal pathway.43 Subsequently, an HA-induced fusion of viral and endosomal membrane is followed by the dissociation of the viral ribonucleoprotein complex (vRNP) consisting of viral RNA, the polymerase complex (viral proteins PA, PB1, and PB2), and the viral nucleoprotein (NP), from the M1 protein.44 Interestingly, avian and mammalian IAVs show different pH optima for this HA-mediated membrane fusion, and the respective mutations in the HA protein (amino acids N104D and T115I) have been associated with the capacity to sufficiently release the viral genetic information into the host cell.45\n46 In the next step, the vRNP is trafficked from the cytosol toward the nucleus. This import is mediated by the cellular importin-\u03b17 in the mammalian system and importin-\u03b13 in the avian host,47\n48\n49 and the switch in usage of importin isoforms depends on both NP and PB2.49 Within the nucleus, the negative-oriented viral (v)RNA is transcribed into messenger (m)RNA, giving rise to new viral proteins by the cellular translation machinery, as well as positive-oriented copy (c)RNA and high amounts of newly transcribed negative-sense vRNA. Herein, the avian polymerase is adapted to working temperature of 41\u00b0C as found in the avian gastrointestinal tract, whereas in human strains, mutations at position 627 in the PB2 gene are thought to contribute to the tolerance toward lower temperatures found in the human lung.50 Virus assembly takes places at the apical cell membrane, where viral proteins and newly formed RNPs accumulate at lipid raft domains, resulting in budding, scission, and release of newly formed virions.51 During release, cleavage from cell surface expressed SA by the viral NA is essential to prevent clumping and retention of virions. NA has to switch from cleaving \u03b12,3- to \u03b12,6-bound SA when introduced into the human host.52\n53 Furthermore, NA activity has been shown to be temperature- as well as pH-dependent, and multiple alterations promote optimal performance in the human respiratory tract.53\n54\n",

            "text": "Especially with regard to pandemic preparedness, an important task is to evaluate the occurrence of virus variants with increased pathogenicity. These IAV variants often show enhanced replication properties or means of immune evasion, some of which will be highlighted here (for a more detailed review, see Baigent and McCauley53 as well as Tscherne and Garc\u00eda-Sastre55). Many mutations enhancing replication efficiency can be found in the polymerase complex (reviewed in M\u00e4nz et al56); most prominent is the E627K substitution in the PB2 gene that is suggested to stabilize the interaction with the NP, to enhance replication rates and to induce higher pathogenicity in the 1918, 1957, and 1968 pandemic IAV.57\n58 It is found in 32% of circulating H5N1 variants as well as H7N9 isolates.59\n60\n61 An important contributor to effective viral spread is the viral nonstructural NS1 protein that plays a major role in limiting the host innate immune response.62\n63 It prevents viral RNA recognition by the innate system and thus blocks the production of antiviral type I interferons (IFNs) by influenza-infected epithelial cells.64 Additionally, NS1 inhibits downstream signaling of protein kinase R (PKR), downregulates the IFN-receptor, and deregulates processing of cellular mRNA.64 Viruses with reduced or lacking NS1 activity are substantially compromised in pathogenicity.65\n66 Another major determinant of influenza virus pathogenicity is the viral HA. Highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI), in contrast to seasonal human IAV and low pathogenic avian influenza strains, bear a multibasic amino acid motif in the HA cleavage site, which promotes HA cleavage by a higher variety of proteases.3\n67 HPAI-induced disease is therefore related to increased disease severity and higher mortality in humans.68\n69 Additionally, influenza strains newly introduced into the population generally show no or only one to two N-linked glycosylation site(s) in the globular head domain of the HA, whereas seasonal strains acquire more sites to mask their antigenic epitopes70\n71; over the past 40 years, H3N2 has increased the number of sites of glycosylation in parallel with its pathogenicity decrease.72\n",

Additional risk factors or comorbidities enhancing the likeliness to develop severe influenza-induced complications comprise age, chronic respiratory, renal, hematologic, neurologic or cardiovascular disease, diabetes, obesity, immunosuppression/-deficiency, and pregnancy/postpartum period as many clinical studies on hospitalized 2009 influenza have demonstrated.128\n129\n130\n151\n152\n153 A global pooled analysis on 70,000 hospitalized 2009 influenza patients indicate that children (<15 years) present a higher risk of being admitted to hospital, whereas older adults (>50 years) display higher mortality rates. Furthermore, morbid obesity seems to be associated with the risk of ICU hospitalization and lethal outcome.130 Immunocompromised persons suffer from a more severe disease and are more likely to develop drug-resistance mutations.154\n155 Numerous clinical studies especially on 2009 pandemic cases156\n157 and WHO or CDC recommendations158\n159 identify pregnancy as comorbidity factor for influenza and advise general vaccination of this risk population. Pregnant women are more susceptible for infection with influenza, develop a more severe disease associated with worse pregnancy outcomes, and show higher risk of ICU admission and increased mortality. Biological reasons for this predisposition are not yet defined, but changes in immune responses, particularly in antiviral responses,160 associated with pregnancy are involved and the fetus-associated complications are probably essentially due to maternal fever.161 As well as maternal protection, vaccination also protects newborns and infants, another risk population, for which vaccination is recommended from 6 months of age in the United States and in the European Union (EU), with the latter mostly limited to infants with increased risk of exposure.162\n",

The currently approved vaccinations are either based on egg- or cell culture\u2013grown inactivated subunit vaccines that are administered intramuscularly, or live, attenuated influenza viruses that are used for intranasal administration in children in the United States and Europe.174 The inactivated trivalent or quadrivalent vaccination preparations contain antigens of two IAV strains (currently a descendant of the pandemic H1N1 and a circulating H3N2 strain) and of one or two influenza B virus strains (Yamagata and Victoria line), respectively, and mainly trigger an immunoglobulin G (IgG) serum response.175 This IgG-mediated protection can be suboptimal especially in cases of strong divergence between the antigens used for vaccination and those of the currently circulating seasonal influenza strains, when prediction is suboptimal. To minimize reduced efficacy, efforts are taken to develop vaccines that elicit cross protection against several strains and are directed against a conserved HA stem region.176\n177\n178 Live, attenuated vaccine strains are usually generated on an H2N2 backbone and reassorted with the WHO-recommended strains to carry the current HA and NA genetic information and surface protein expression adapted to growth at 25\u00b0C, thus limiting spread in the human host.179 They elicit a stronger immune response including IgG and IgA production as well as T-cell memory, but are considered less safe, as they bear the potential risk of reversion to a nonattenuated form and a possible reassortment platform for circulating virus stains.180 Therefore, efforts are made to improve safety of live, attenuated vaccines, for example, by engineering variants unable to circumvent the antiviral IFN response by deleting or inserting a truncated NS1 protein.174\n",

DAS181 (Fludase) abrogates HA adsorption to the host cell by cleavage of SA from the host cell surface.192\n193\n194 HA is further targeted by agents preventing correct posttranslational processing of the transmembrane protein (Nitazoxanide), as well as by blocking cleavage of HA by the internal proteases HAT and TMPRSS2 (Aprotinin).192\n195 Another approach is the inhibition of the transcription factor NF-\u03baB that has been proven to be activated upon influenza infection and to be supportive for virus replication.196 Given that NF-\u03baB inhibition resulted in reduced viral replication, less inflammation, and improved outcome in preclinical models, an inhaled compound, L-lysine acetylsalicylate glycine (LASAG), has been tested in phase II trials.197 Other strategies interrupt virus replication through specific modulation of lipid raft domains (Viperin),198 the MAP kinase pathway, pyridine metabolism, protectin D expression, and even IFN modulation,191\n199 where the latter is either enhanced early in IAV infection or suppressed by neutralizing antibodies late in disease progression.200 Further strategies are aimed to modulate an unbalanced, overshooting inflammatory response during virus-induced lung injury, to promote pulmonary host defense and to drive repair of the damaged epithelium after virus clearance. GM-CSF is an important modulator of macrophage and DC-mediated antiviral immunity, and also plays a major role in the repair of the alveolar epithelium.201\n202\n203 As such, we suggested that local administration of GM-CSF to patients with pneumonia- and IAV-induced ARDS will improve host defense, oxygenation, and outcome,204 and a placebo-controlled, double-blind, randomized multicenter phase II trial on inhaled GM-CSF for treatment of ARDS induced by bacterial or viral pneumonia has been launched. Such host-modulating therapies are envisioned to be combined with antivirals in future to improve outcome of influenza-induced respiratory failure.141\n",

A key challenge in influenza research is to design innovative host-based therapies able to boost antiviral immunity and to improve lung regeneration. Translational approaches should be focused on better understanding of viral\u2013host interactions as well as immunopathogenic mechanisms to define signaling pathways on a molecular basis amenable to specific targeting. Meanwhile, defining host susceptibility factors will accelerate recognition and treatment of a new category of risk patients and also promote the discovery of novel strategies for personalized therapies. It will also be necessary to understand the mechanisms underlying the increased susceptibility to bacterial outgrowth associated with influenza infection, to reduce the prevalence of secondary infections with increased morbidities. Finally, ongoing research on stem cell\u2013based therapies, including injury- or pathogen-specific programming of these cells prior to application to improve their particular modes of action in different forms of acute lung injury, reveals promising results which will likely be the basic of future therapies against ARDS.",
