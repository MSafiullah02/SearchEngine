After studying the cholera epidemic spread in Bari in 1973, Capasso and Serio [2] introduced a saturated incidence rate g(I)S into epidemic models, where g(I) tends to a saturation level when I gets large, i.e.,(1.1)g(I)=kI1+\u03b1I,where kI measures the infection force of the disease and 1/(1 + \n\u03b1I) measures the inhibition effect from the behavioral change of the susceptible individuals when their number increases or from the crowding effect of the infective individuals. This incidence rate seems more reasonable than the bilinear incidence rate(1.2)g(I)S=kIS,because it includes the behavioral change and crowding effect of the infective individuals and prevents the unboundedness of the contact rate by choosing suitable parameters. Ruan and Wang [12] studied an epidemic model with a specific nonlinear incident rate(1.3)g(I)S=kI2S1+\u03b1I2and presented a detailed qualitative and bifurcation analysis of the model. They derived sufficient conditions to ensure that the system has none, one, or two limit cycles and showed that the system undergoes a Bogdanov\u2013Takens bifurcation at the degenerate equilibrium which includes a saddle-node bifurcation, a Hopf bifurcation, and a homoclinic bifurcation. The general incidence rate(1.4)g(I)S=kIpS1+\u03b1Iqwas proposed by Liu et al. [10] and used by a number of authors, see, for example, Derrick and van den Driessche [3], Hethcote [5], Hethcote and Levin [6] and van den Driessche [7], Alexander and Moghadas [1], etc. Nonlinear incidence rates of the form kI\np\nS\nq were investigated by Liu et al.

            "text": "If the function g(I) is nonmonotone, that is, g(I) is increasing when I is small and decreasing when I is large (see Fig. 1\n), it can be used to interpret the \u201cpsychological\u201d effect: for a very large number of infective individuals the infection force may decrease as the number of infective individuals increases, because in the presence of large number of infectives the population may tend to reduce the number of contacts per unit time. The recent epidemic outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) had such psychological effects on the general public (see [8]), aggressive measures and policies, such as border screening, mask wearing, quarantine, isolation, etc. have been proved to be very effective ([4], [13]) in reducing the infective rate at the late stage of the SARS outbreak, even when the number of infective individuals were getting relatively larger. To model this phenomenon, we propose a incidence rate(1.5)g(I)S=kIS1+\u03b1I2,where kI measures the infection force of the disease and 1/(1 + \n\u03b1I\n2) describes the psychological or inhibitory effect from the behavioral change of the susceptible individuals when the number of infective individuals is very large. This is important because the number of effective contacts between infective individuals and susceptible individuals decreases at high infective levels due to the quarantine of infective individuals or due to the protection measures by the susceptible individuals. Notice that when \u03b1\n = 0, the nonmonotone incidence rate (1.5) becomes the bilinear incidence rate (1.2).",

[14] (pp. 114) or Theorem 2.11.1 of Perko [11] (pp. 150), we know that (0, 0) is a saddle-node.

The Jacobian matrix of (3.3) at (x\n\u2217, \ny\n\u2217) isM1=x\u2217(px\u22172+2pqx\u22172-2Apx\u2217-1)(1+px\u22172)2-x\u22171+px\u22172q-1.We have thatdet(M1)=-x\u2217(px\u22172+2pqx\u22172-2Apx\u2217-1)(1+px\u22172)2+qx\u22171+px\u22172=x\u2217(1+q+2Apx\u2217-(1+q)px\u22172)(1+px\u22172)2.The sign of det(M\n1) is determined byS1\u225c1+q+2Apx\u2217-(1+q)px\u22172.Note that mpx\n\u2217\n2\n + (1 + \nq)x\n\u2217\n + \nm\n \u2212 \nA\n = 0. We havemS1=(2Amp+(1+q)2)x\u2217+(1+q)(2m-A)=(2Amp+(1+q)2)x\u2217+(1+q)(2m-A)2Amp+(1+q)2.Substitutingx\u2217=-(1+q)+\u039412mp,where\u03941=(1+q)2-4mp(m-A),into S\n1 and using a straightforward calculation, we haveS1=-\u03941m[(1+q)\u03941-(2Amp+(1+q)2)]=(1+q)\u03941m1+q+2mpA1+q-\u03941.Since1+q+2mpA1+q2-\u039412=4m2p2A2(1+q)2+4m2p>0,it follows that S\n1\n > 0. Hence, det(M\n1) > 0 and (x\n\u2217, \ny\n\u2217) is a node or a focus or a center. Furthermore, we have the following result on the stability of (x\n\u2217, \ny\n\u2217).Theorem 3.4\nSuppose m\n \u2212 \nA\n < \n0, then there is a unique endemic equilibrium (x\n\u2217\n,\n \ny\n\u2217\n) of model\n(3.3)\n, which is a stable node.\n\nProofWe know that the stability of (x\n\u2217, \ny\n\u2217) is determined by tr(M\n1). We havetr(M1)=-p2x\u22174+(1+2q)px\u22173-2(1+A)px\u22172-x\u2217-1(1+px\u22172)2.The sign of tr(M\n1) is determined byS2=-p2x\u22174+(1+2q)px\u22173-2(1+A)px\u22172-x\u2217-1.We claim that S\n2\n \u2260 0. To see this, note that mpx\n\u2217\n2\n + (1 + \nq)x\n\u2217\n + \nm\n \u2212 \nA\n = 0. Then we havem3pS2=(B1A+B2)x\u2217+(B3A+B4),whereB1=mp(2+3m+2q+4mq),B2=(1+q)[(1+q)2+m(1+q)(1+2q)-2m3p],B3=-(1+q)2-m(1+q)(1+2q)+2m3p,B4=m[(1+q)2+m(1+q)(1+2q)-p(1+2m)A2].When m\n \u2212 \nA\n < 0, we can see that B\n1\nA\n + \nB\n2\n > 0.Let \u03be\n = \nmpx\n\u2217\n2\n + (1 + \nq)x\n\u2217\n + \nm\n \u2212 \nA. Similarly, we have(B1A+B2)2\u03be=m3pPS2+S3,where P is a polynomial of x\n\u2217 andS3=m3p(1+A2p+2q+q2)[(A+2Am-2m2)2p+(1+A-m+q)(1+m+q+2mq)].Assume that S\n2\n = 0. Since \u03be\n = 0, it follows that S\n3\n = 0. However, when m\n \u2212 \nA\n < 0, we have S\n3\n > 0. Therefore, S\n2\n \u2260 0 for any positive value of the parameters p, q and A, that is, tr(M\n1) \u2260 0. Thus, m\n \u2212 \nA\n < 0 implies that (x\n\u2217, \ny\n\u2217) does not change stability. Take m\n = 1, A\n = 2, p\n = 1, q\n = 1. Then x\u2217=-1+2, y\u2217=-1+2, tr(M\n1) = \u22121.64645 < 0. By the continuity of tr(M\n1) on the parameters, we know that tr(M\n1) < 0 for m\n \u2212 \nA\n < 0. This completes the proof.  \u25a1\n",

Interestingly, this model does not exhibit complicated dynamics as other epidemic models with other types of incidence rates reported in Liu et al. [10], Derrick and van den Driessche [3], Hethcote and Levin [6], Hethcote and van den Driessche [7], Ruan and Wang [12], etc. In terms of the basic reproduction number R\n0\n = \nkb/(d(d\n + \n\u03bc)), our main results indicate that when R\n0\n < 1, the disease-free equilibrium is globally attractive (see Fig. 2\n). When R\n0\n > 1, the endemic equilibrium exists and is globally stable (see Fig. 3\n). Biologically, these indicate that when the proportionality (infection) constant (k) and/or the recruitment rate (b) is sufficiently large and removal rate (death rate (d) plus recovery rate (\u03bc)) is sufficiently small such that R\n0\n > 1, then the disease persists. On the other hand, if the proportionality (infection) constant (k) and/or the recruitment rate (b) is small enough and removal rate (death rate (d) plus recovery rate (\u03bc)) is large enough such that R\n0\n < 1, then the disease dies out. The aggressive control measures and policies, such as border screening, mask wearing, quarantine, isolation, etc., helped in reducing the infection rate and increasing the removal rate and in the eventual eradication of SARS (Gumel et al. [4] and Wang and Ruan [13]).",
