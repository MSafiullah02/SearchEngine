Given the high prevalence of comorbidities in DR Congo, as there is in Africa more broadly, the death toll could even be much higher.3\n",

However, authorities in Ghana and South Africa have already begun to consider lifting restrictions.8 Given the dearth of health-care facilities and equipment across Africa, we urge investing heavily in prevention, including lockdowns focused on densely populated areas and shelter-in-place orders for the most vulnerable. Simultaneously, the socioeconomic considerations of the population and the disparate local realities of the 54 African countries must be taken into account. Mitigation strategies must be implemented in conjunction with social protection measures, such as price controls, the waving of utility bills and taxes, and targeted cash transfers.9 A concerted international effort is both moral and pragmatic for achieving this goal. However, on April 14, 2020, the US President announced that the USA will suspend its funding of WHO. Such action would be shortsighted, imperilling the containment of SARS-CoV-2. Protecting Africa is essential, not only for the continent itself, but also to safeguard the rest of the world. Given the potential for SARS-CoV-2 to reseed, even as some countries extinguish their current epidemics, the worldwide population is only as safe as its most vulnerable nations.",
