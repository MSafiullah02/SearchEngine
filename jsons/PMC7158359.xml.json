            "text": "Carbohydrates regulate a variety of biochemical pathways and disease processes, including protein folding, fertilization, embryogenesis, neuronal development, cell proliferation, microbial and viral infections, and cancer metastasis.1, 2, 3, 4, 5 Coupled with advances in understanding of the functions of carbohydrates in biological and pathological processes, the importance of carbohydrate-binding molecules has been rapidly growing as chemical tools in glycobiology. The most extensively used carbohydrate-binding molecules are lectins, which are defined as proteins of non-immune origin that bind specific carbohydrates without modifying them.6, 7 They have proved to be extremely useful tools not only for the isolation and characterization of glycoproteins but also for detection of dynamic spatiotemporal changes that are associated with pathological processes.8, 9, 10 In addition, several lectins derived from prokaryotic, plant, invertebrate, or vertebrate species having binding specificity for mannose, galactose, or N-acetylglucosamine (GlcNAc) have been found to inhibit the infection of enveloped viruses, such as human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and hepatitis C virus (HCV).11, 12, 13 Representative lectins having antiviral activity are the mannose-specific agglutinins from Galanthus nivalis (GNA), Hippeastrum hybrid (HHA), Cymbidium sp. (CA), Narcissus pseudonarcissus (NPA), Epipactis helleborine (HEA), and Listera ovata (LOA), the GlcNAc-specific agglutinin from Urtica dioica (UDA), and the cyanobacterium-derived lectin (CV-N). These lectins show the dual mode of antiviral action, blockage of virus entry, and triggering the action of immune system by exposing cryptic immunogenic epitopes of the virus surface. The discovery of these unique anti-HIV properties of lectins that have never been observed in any of the existing chemotherapeutics has spurred intensive study of lectins as therapeutic agents.",

            "text": "While lectins are of great value as possible drug candidates as well as chemical tools in glycobiology research, they have several disadvantages due to their nature as proteins. First of all, large-scale production of proteins is generally both costly and time-consuming, and their relative low chemical stability may be problematic for long storage. From a therapeutic viewpoint, the bioavailability of proteins is likely to be poor, and concerns are also raised about the unfavorable biological properties of lectins, such as immunogenicity, inflammatory activity, cellular toxicity, mitogenic stimulation of human peripheral lymphocyte cells, and hemagglutination of human red blood cells. Under these situations, non-protein small-size molecules having carbohydrate-binding properties have been recently attracting a great deal of attention as alternatives to lectins of protein structure. Since small molecules can be prepared in reliable quantities and are easily \u201ctuned\u201d for structural optimizations, these \u201clectin mimics\u201d may have potential benefit as research tools and drug candidates.",

            "text": "Lectin mimics of synthetic origin have been developed progressively during recent years.14, 15, 16, 17 On the basis of molecular-design principles, the synthetic lectin mimics may be divided roughly into two groups, boronic acid-dependent and boronic acid-independent lectin mimics. The former group possesses boronic acid motifs, which form tight and reversible covalent bonds with 1, 2- or 1, 3-diol groups of carbohydrates. While boronic acid itself has a low affinity for most common carbohydrates at physiological pH, the affinity can be enhanced by introduction of neighboring functional groups and/or use of two boronic acid motifs of proper alignment. In contrast, boronic acid-independent lectin mimics rely solely on non-covalent interactions for binding to carbohydrates. These types of lectin mimics have been intensively developed in the field of supramolecular chemistry. Representative molecular architectures include tripod- and cage-types, both of which incorporate, respectively, hydrophilic and hydrophobic surfaces for hydrogen bonding and CH/\u03c0 interaction (a weak hydrogen bond occurring between CH groups and aromatic rings)18 with carbohydrates. A combination of these non-covalent interactions collectively realizes three-dimensional recognition of carbohydrates.",

We also focus on naturally occurring lectin mimics, pradimicins (PRMs) and benanomicins.19 They are the only class of non-protein natural products having a C-type lectin-like property of being able to recognize d-mannopyranosides (Man) in the presence of Ca2 + ions. Recent investigations have revealed an interesting similarity in molecular architecture between these natural products and tripod-type lectin mimics. Moreover, accumulated evidence suggests that they have unique antimicrobial profiles that differ from those of the major classes of antibiotics, and exhibit anti-HIV activity in a manner similar to lectins. These emerging concepts of the molecular basis of carbohydrate recognition and therapeutic potential of naturally occurring lectin mimics are also described.",

Boronic acids act as Lewis acids because of the empty p-orbital on boron, and in the presence of Lewis bases such as hydroxyl groups, interconversion from sp2 to sp3 hybridization readily occurs.20, 21, 22 In aqueous media, a water molecule reversibly adds to a neutral trigonal form (I) of boronic acids to produce an anionic tetrahedral form (II) with a release of one proton (Scheme 1\n). In the alkaline pH range (pH > 10), diols can react with the tetrahedral form (II) to give stable cyclic boronate esters (IV). The general affinity of boronic acids for diols in carbohydrates is as follows: cis-1, 2-diol > 1, 3-diol \u226b \ntrans-1, 2-diol. On the other hand, boronic acids exist predominately as the trigonal form (I) in the neutral pH range. As a result, reaction with diols produces chemically unstable adducts (III), which are readily hydrolyzed. Therefore, a high pH is generally required in order to favor the equilibrium toward cyclic boronate esters (IV).",

            "text": "To realize arylboronic acid/diol association at neutral pH, several attempts have been made to stabilize their adducts. One of the most promising strategies is the introduction of dialkylaminomethyl groups to the ortho position of arylboronic acids (Scheme 2\n).23, 24 The covalently appended amino groups facilitate formation of a boronic ester and accelerate arylboronic acid/diol association by direct B\u2013N coordination or \u201csolvent-insertion\u201d mechanism. Recent investigations by X-ray crystallography, 11B-NMR, and computational analysis support that the latter mechanism is predominant in protic solvents.25, 26, 27 By using this molecular architecture as a key structure, a number of boronic acid-dependent lectin mimics have been reported.14, 28 The majority of these works have been directed toward the development of molecular sensors for monitoring blood d-glucose as a key component of insulin-releasing implants for diabetes patients. In early landmark studies, Shinkai and coworkers developed carbohydrate-based photoinduced electron-transfer sensors (1, 2, Fig. 1\n).29, 30, 31 These compounds bound carbohydrates at neutral pH (pH 7.77) and showed increased fluorescence through suppression of the photoinduced electron transfer (PET) from the tertiary amino group to the anthracenyl group upon binding of the carbohydrate. While the binding selectivity of 1 for d-glucose was poor (the order of selectivity for 1 is d-fructose > \nd-allose \u2248 \nd-galactose > \nd-glucose > ethylene glycol), compound 2 exhibited binding preference for d-glucose (the order of selectivity for 2 is d-glucose > \nd-allose > \nd-fructose \u2248 \nd-galactose > ethylene glycol). This selectivity of 2 for d-glucose was explained by the spatial disposition of the two boronic acid moieties. The two inwardly facing boronic acid moieties are perfectly spaced and aligned for two pairs of diol groups (1,2- and 4,6-hydroxyl groups) of d-glucose.",

Although the affinity of 3 for d-glucose was about three times lower than that of 2, compound 3 represents about 3-fold enhancement in selectivity for d-glucose over d-fructose. Based on these results, an additional three derivatives with electron-withdrawing groups, which generally enhance the carbohydrate affinity of arylboronic acids, were tested for their affinity and selectivity for carbohydrates. Although the introduction of cyano and nitro groups enhanced the affinity for d-glucose, the effects were more significant for binding to d-fructose and d-galactose. As a result, the selectivity of 6 and 7 for d-glucose was lower than that of the parent compound 3. The fluoro-substituted derivative (8) was inferior to 3 in both affinity and selectivity. Although the substituent effect on carbohydrate selectivity of arylboronic acids is hard to predict, it is interesting that a simple modification of the aryl group changes the binding preference for carbohydrates.",

Compound 11 showed strong fluorescence enhancement upon binding to sLex in a 1:1 mixture of methanol and phosphate buffer (pH 7.4). Moreover, 11 was found to fluorescently label HEPG2 cells expressing high levels of sLex, while 11 stained neither HEP3B cells expressing Lewis Y nor COS7 cells lacking fucosylated antigens. Using this unique fluorescent sLex probe, matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization mass spectrometry (MALDI-MS)-based imaging of cancer tissue has been performed.41 Targeted imaging mass spectrometry (TIMS) is a powerful method of imaging for histological analysis, which allows spatial visualization of a molecule of interest directly from tissue sections by the use of laser-reactive photo-cleavable molecular tags attached to affinity molecules.42, 43 Wang and coworkers synthesized a conjugate molecule (12) of 11 and a trityl-based tag, and TIMS analysis of cancer tissues having a high level of sLex was performed. The tumor region expressing sLex was successfully detected by the imaging, suggesting that MS-based imaging of cancer tissues using lectin mimic-based probes is feasible.",

The unusually small C\u2013B\u2013O dihedral angle of 13 facilitates production of an anionic boronate ester with a diol even at neutral pH by opening up the cone angle in the resulting tetrahedral structure. The boronate ester formation of 13 is also entropically more favorable than that of the simple phenylboronic acid, which requires the external hydroxyl ligand to form the anionic tetrahedral complex (Scheme 1). The most important and interesting feature of 13 is its capability to bind the pyranose form of carbohydrates in neutral water. Several lines of evidence suggest that carbohydrates bind to boronic acids, including o-dialkylaminomethyl arylboronic acids in their weakly populated furanose forms, and not in their pyranose form.46, 47 In contrast, 13 was shown to bind hexopyranosides of d-glucose, d-galactose, d-mannose, and d-fucose with weak but encouraging affinities (Table II\n). Although the exact mode of complexation of 13 with them is not fully understood, the relatively high Lewis acidity and strained cyclic structure of 13 are thought to be possible contributing factors for its exceptional pyranoside-binding behavior.",

The tri(ethylene glycol) component was introduced to increase the water solubility. A library of 400 examples having different peptide backbones was prepared by solid-phase peptide synthesis and was screened for binding to the TF antigen disaccharide by use of a competitive enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). The most potent receptor, showing an IC50 of 20 \u03bcM, was compound 14, having an electron-rich p-methoxyphenylalanine component and a furan, both of which are favorable for CH/\u03c0 interaction with hydrogen atoms on the carbohydrate rings. The importance of the benzoboroxole moieties was confirmed by the weak affinities of control compounds (15: IC50\n = 54 \u03bcM, 16: IC50\n = 100 \u03bcM) for the TF disaccharide. These studies demonstrate that benzoboroxole (13) holds a great promise for the design of lectin mimics for carbohydrate biomarkers of biological importance.",

It is well known that several proteins of the viral envelope are densely glycosylated. For example, gp120, the HIV-1 envelope glycoprotein, possesses 18\u201330 (an average of 24) N-linked glycans, which constitute about half of the molecular weight of the gp120 molecule.58 These glycans on the HIV-1 envelope play crucial roles in enabling an efficient entry of HIV into its susceptible target cells.59, 60 Binding of lectins to these glycans thus inhibits the efficient functioning of the envelope molecules during viral entry.61, 62, 63 Another important role of the envelope glycans is to hide the highly immunogenic epitopes from the immune system of the host.64, 65 Because of this glycan shield, the neutralizing antibody response is not elicited, and as a result, the immune system is not able to suppress HIV. However, these glycans are progressively deleted by long-term exposure of HIV to lectins through mutation of HIV.66, 67, 68, 69 Weakening of the glycan shield triggers the production of neutralizing antibodies against the immunogenic epitopes of gp120 previously hidden.",

            "text": "Despite the promising dual mode of anti-HIV action of lectins, concerns regarding their therapeutic use have been raised on account of the unacceptably high cost of large-scale production, low chemical stability, and unfavorable immunogenic response. Investigations are therefore ongoing to identify lectin mimics having high synthetic accessibility and high chemical stability. Boronic acid-dependent lectin mimics are undoubtedly potential candidates that exhibit lectin-like anti-HIV activities. The first attempt to evaluate antiviral activities of small-size boronic acid derivatives has been made by McGuigan and coworkers.70 In an initial screening, a diverse range of ortho-, meta-, and para-substituted monophenylboronic acids were tested for their antiviral activities against a broad range of viruses, including HIV-1, HIV-2, varicella zoster virus, and influenza virus (Fig. 5\n). Unfortunately, none of the compounds showed antiviral activity at subtoxic concentrations or bound to gp120 of HIV-1. The same research group therefore performed the second screening using a library of bisphenylboronic acids having a variety of linkers (Fig. 6\n).71 Although these compounds have a potential to bind two sets of diol groups in such glycans as 2\u20138, surface plasmon resonance (SPR) experiments revealed that none of the bisphenylboronic acids bound to gp120 of HIV-1, even at 50 \u03bcM. Obviously, all of the compounds lacked the ability to inhibit virus replication. Although the results were disappointing, these data are valuable for future research aimed at designing small-size phenylboronic acid derivatives having antiviral activity.",

Multivalent interactions can compensate for weak binding affinity of ligands because of entropic advantage and steric stabilization, and are often found in natural systems, including the carbohydrate\u2013lectin interaction.73, 74 Moreover, they utilized benzoboroxole (13) for the boronic acid components, which can bind to such non-reducing carbohydrates as methyl \u03b1-d-mannopyranoside and methyl \u03b1-d-galactopyranoside at physiological pH, as already described.44, 45 The use of benzoboroxole is quite rational, because 30\u201350% of glycans in HIV-1 gp120 are high mannose-type oligosaccharides containing three terminal non-reducing mannose residues, and 50\u201363% are complex-type oligosaccharides terminating to some extent with non-reducing galactose groups (Fig. 8\n).58 Based on these molecular design concepts, the research group of Kisher synthesized benzoboroxole-functionalized oligomers (18) and polymers (20\u201322). In these compounds, 5-methacrylamido-2-hydroxymethylphenyl boronic acid-derived monomers were incorporated at different feed ratios into linear backbones with 2-hydroxypropylmethacrylamide. The SPR experiments revealed that the 25 mol% functionalized oligomer (18) showed an about 8-fold higher affinity for gp120 of HIV-1 than the simple benzoboroxole (13). On the other hand, no binding was detected for an oligomer lacking benzoboroxole components (17) at any concentrations, indicating that multivalent interaction of the benzoboroxole groups with gp120 glycans is responsible for the significant affinity of compound 18. Antiviral activity against HIV-1 was evaluated only for the polymer compounds (19\u201322) because polymers of larger molecular weight decrease cytotoxicity by preventing cellular uptake. While the 25 mol% functionalized polymer 20 showed only slightly higher activity (EC50\n = 15 \u03bcM) than the control polymer without benzoboroxole groups (19, EC50\n \u2265 50 \u03bcM), increasing the degree of functionalization markedly decreased the EC50 values. The 75 mol% functionalized polymer (22) exhibited a strong activity (EC50\n = 0.015 \u03bcM) comparable to that of the natural lectin CV-N.",

In fact, an almost 100-fold increase in aqueous solubility was observed with the incorporation of the methylpropanesulfonic acid moieties, and compound 24 showed enhanced anti-HIV-1 activity (EC50\n = 4 nM). A physical mixture of 21 and 23 did not demonstrate any significant increase in activity, suggesting that simultaneous ionic and covalent interactions possibly contribute to the observed synergistic improvement in antiviral activity of 24. Moreover, biocompatibility evaluations on VEC-100-reconstructed human vaginal tissue suggest that 24 is likely to be nontoxic.

Whereas the apolar bottom face of this architecture interacts with CH groups of carbohydrates through CH/\u03c0 interaction, the polar lateral face forms hydrogen bonds with the hydroxyl groups of carbohydrates. These non-covalent interactions collectively realize three-dimensional recognition of carbohydrates by the tripod-type receptors. Early examples are compounds 25 and 26 developed by Mazik and coworkers.76, 77, 78, 79 These receptors contain a benzene platform as the \u03c0-donor for CH/\u03c0 interaction and three amidopyridine moieties as hydrophilic units (Fig. 10\n). 1H-NMR spectroscopic titrations in chloroform (Table III\n) revealed that both receptors formed very strong 2:1 receptor\u2013carbohydrate complexes with n-octyl \u03b2-d-glucopyranoside (Oct-\u03b2-Glc), n-octyl \u03b1-d-glucopyranoside (Oct-\u03b1-Glc), and n-octyl \u03b2-d-galactopyranoside (Oct-\u03b2-Gal). Replacement of the amidopyridine moieties by aminopyridine groups and incorporation of methyl or ethyl groups into the central phenyl ring (27, 28, Fig. 10) significantly increased the binding selectivity for Oct-\u03b2-Glc. In addition, curve fitting of the titration data for receptors 27 and 28 with Oct-\u03b2-Glc suggested the existence of both 1:1 and 1:2 receptor\u2013carbohydrate complexes in chloroform, with strong association constants for 1:1 complexes.

Receptors 29, 30, and 31 contain, respectively, the primary amide, amino, and hydroxyl groups instead of one aminopyridine unit of 28.80 These functional groups were incorporated as analogues of the side chains of Asn, Gln, Lys, and Ser, which are often observed in the carbohydrate-binding motifs of natural lectins. While the binding profiles of 30 and 31 with the amino and hydroxyl groups, respectively, were almost similar to that of the parent compound 28, significant enhancement in affinity for Oct-\u03b2-Glc was observed in 29 with two primary amide groups (Table III). Receptors 32 and 33 containing imidazole and indole rings, which mimic the side chains of His and Trp, respectively, were also tested for their binding to Oct-\u03b2-Glc, Oct-\u03b1-Glc, and Oct-\u03b2-Gal.81 Marked enhancements in binding to all glycosides were observed in both compounds. 1H-NMR analysis suggested that CH/\u03c0 interaction might contribute significantly to the complexation of 32 and 33 with Oct-\u03b2-Glc. On the other hand, introduction of an unnatural phenanthroline ring to the hydrophilic unit (34) was shown to be particularly effective in the binding to Oct-\u03b2- and Oct-\u03b1-Glc.82 Molecular-modeling calculations suggested that the binding pocket of 34 has the correct shape and size for encapsulation of these glucopyranosides.",

            "text": "Based on the observation that the phenanthroline, imidazole, and indole rings were valuable building blocks for hydrophilic units, a new series of receptors (35\u201337) containing two units of these building blocks were designed.83, 84 Although the affinities of both 34 and 35, having, respectively, one and two phenanthroline units, for Oct-\u03b2-Glc and Oct-\u03b1-Glc were too large to be calculated in chloroform, titration experiments in 5% Me2SO\u2013chloroform revealed that 35 was a superior \u03b2-Glc binder to 34 (K\n11 for 34\n = 36,530 M\u2212 1, K\n11 for 35\n = 78,400 M\u2212 1). These results indicate that the incorporation of the second phenanthroline unit causes further enhancement of the binding affinity of the receptor. On the other hand, significant changes in binding preference were observed in 36 and 37, containing, respectively, two imidazole and indole units. Whereas the affinities of these receptors for Oct-\u03b2-Glc were markedly decreased as compared to those of 32 and 33 with, respectively, one imidazole and indole unit, they displayed a high level of affinity toward Oct-\u03b2-Gal. The binding selectivity for Oct-\u03b2-Gal was further increased in 38 and 39, which have the alkyl side chains of Val and Leu in the hydrophilic units, respectively.85 Their binding affinities for Oct-\u03b2-Gal were slightly higher than those for Oct-\u03b2-Glc. Van der Waals contacts between the branched alkyl groups and glycosides probably contribute to the binding capacity of 38 and 39. The most effective receptor for Oct-\u03b2-Gal reported to date is 40, a compound with two 8-hydroxyquinoline units.86 Receptor 40 displayed more than 2-fold selectivity for Oct-\u03b2-Gal over Oct-\u03b2-Glc and Oct-\u03b1-Glc, and its affinity for Oct-\u03b2-Gal was extremely potent. In addition to these tripod-type receptors for monosaccharides, Mazik's group has developed the tetrapod-type receptors 41 and 42 (Fig. 12\n).88 Combination of the dimesitylmethane scaffold and four aminopyridine units was expected to provide a cavity suitable for disaccharides. Indeed, these receptors exhibited a strong binding preference for n-dodecyl \u03b2-maltoside (K\n21\n \u2265 100,000 M\u2212 1 for 41 and 42) over Oct-\u03b2-Glc (K\n12\n = 630 M\u2212 1 for 41, K\n12\n = 560 M\u2212 1 for 42) in chloroform, indicating that these relatively large architectures fit well to the disaccharide structures.",

            "text": "Roelens and coworkers have developed a series of pyrrolic tripodal receptors using the triethylbenzene scaffold, representatives of which are shown in Fig. 13\n(43\u201347). These receptors were evaluated against a set of n-octyl glycosides of biologically relevant monosaccharides, including Glc, Gal, Man, and GlcNAc. Roelens's group has assessed the binding affinities of the receptors using the original parameter, BC500 (intrinsic median binding concentration) descriptor, which is defined as the total concentration of receptor necessary for binding 50% of the ligand when the fraction of bound receptor is zero.89 The BC500 value can be viewed as a global dissociation constant in chemical systems involving any number of complex species. Table IV\nsummarizes BC500 values of 43\u201347 for the set of n-octyl glycosides in chloroform or acetonitrile. The progenitors 43 and 44, having imino and amino groups, respectively, displayed modest to high affinity for all n-octyl glycosides in chloroform.89 Both receptors had a preference for Oct-\u03b2-Glc and Oct-\u03b2-GlcNAc, indicating that the pyrrolic tripodal architecture is well suited for binding to carbohydrates having all-equatorial arrays of polar functionality. However, the binding selectivity was completely different in 45, which has an acetal substituent in the \u03b1 position of the pyrrole.90 Receptor 45 showed a striking affinity for Oct-\u03b2-Man, which was too strong to be evaluated in chloroform. Titration experiments in acetonitrile revealed that the affinity of 45 for Oct-\u03b2-Man was almost one order of magnitude greater than those of the other glycosides. NMR experimental data combined with molecular-modeling calculations suggested that this notable selectivity of 45 for Oct-\u03b2-Man was derived from a conformational restriction induced by the cyclic acetal substituents on the pyrrole unit.92 The resulting narrower binding-cleft of 45 fits preferentially to Oct-\u03b2-Man. Based on these promising results, Roelens's group developed a new generation of Man-selective receptors incorporating chiral trans-1,2-diaminocyclohexane units (46, 47).91, 93, 94 Receptors 46 and 47 displayed substantial affinity and selectivity for Oct-\u03b1- and Oct-\u03b2-Man, respectively. Replacement of the diamines of 46 and 47 with the corresponding enantiomers decreased both affinity and selectivity, indicating that the chirality of the receptor plays a key role in determining the recognition properties of the receptors. In regard to affinity and selectivity, 46 and 47 are the most effective Man receptors reported to date.",

This prediction was confirmed by binding studies employing fluorescence-titration experiments in chloroform.

After the successful development of a water-soluble variant of compound 50 (53, Fig. 16),100 in which a tricarboxylate group is installed in each hydrophilic component, its binding property against a panel of 22 carbohydrates was thoroughly examined (Table VI\n).101 In accordance with the binding preference of 50 in organic solvents, compound 53 displayed substantial affinity for methyl \u03b2-d-glucopyranoside (Me-\u03b2-Glc) in water (K\na\n = 28 M\u2212 1). However, it was found that methyl 2-acetamido-2-deoxy \u03b2-d-glucopyranoside (Me-\u03b2-GlcNAc) was a better target for 53 (K\na\n = 630 M\u2212 1). The affinity of compound 53 for Me-\u03b2-GlcNAc was comparable to that of a natural lectin, wheat-germ agglutinin (WGA, K\na\n = 730 M\u2212 1), which has classically been used to bind GlcNAc residues. It is also noteworthy that 53 was far more discriminatory than WGA. Whereas WGA exhibits significant binding to several 2-acetamido sugars, including GlcNAc, Me-\u03b1-GlcNAc, N-acetylneuraminic acid, and N,N\u2032-diacetyl-d-chitobiose, the affinities of 53 for other 21 carbohydrates were more than one order of magnitude weaker than that for Me-\u03b2-GlcNAc. Since \u03b2-GlcNAc attached to the hydroxyl group of serine or threonine is a common posttranslational modification of proteins, binding experiments of 53 with a glycopeptide containing a GlcNAc residue were also conducted using 54 (Fig. 16). This was based on the sequence from GlcNAc-linked casein kinase II.102\n1H NMR titration experiments in D2O demonstrated that 53 bound to 54 with significant affinity (K\na\n = 1040 M\u2212 1). On the other hand, binding to the aglycosyl peptide 55 was negligible, supporting the conclusion that 53 binds 54 through the GlcNAc residue.",

To avoid this phenomenon, Davis's group employed a meta-terphenyl structure in place of the para-terphenyl group of 51 and incorporated the fifth isophthalamide spacer. The resulting \u201crigid\u201d variant of 51 (56, Fig. 17\n) bearing carboxylate groups was shown to bind cellobiose (K\na\n = 560\u2013600 M\u2212 1) and methyl \u03b2-cellobioside (K\na\n = 850\u2013910 M\u2212 1) with good affinities in aqueous solutions (Table VII\n). The binding affinities of compound 56 for carbohydrates were evaluated by 1H NMR, induced circular dichroism (ICD), and fluorescence titrations. To obtain reliable K\na values, at least two methods were used for each carbohydrate. While 56 showed moderate affinities for xylobiose (K\na\n = 250\u2013270 M\u2212 1) and N,N\u2032-diacetylchitobiose (K\na\n = 120 M\u2212 1), both of which are also all-equatorial disaccharides, only weak binding was detected for monosaccharides and other disaccharides (K\na\n \u2264 25 M\u2212 1).

The isophthalamide and BAMP spacers are similar to each other in length, but very different in hydrogen-bonding characteristics. In the isophthalamide spacer, two sets of the amide hydrogen and amide carbonyl groups can act as hydrogen-bond donors and acceptors, respectively. On the other hand, the BAMP spacer contains one pyrrole ring as a hydrogen-bond donor and two amino groups, which can act either as donors or acceptors, depending on the pH of the solution. 1H NMR titration experiments under basic conditions (pD = 13) demonstrated that the affinity of 57 for d-glucose (K\na\n = 18 M\u2212 1) was twice as high as that of 53 (K\na\n = 9 M\u2212 1). However, 57 bound weakly to Me-\u03b2-Glc (K\na\n = 4 M\u2212 1) and GlcNAc (K\na\n = 7 M\u2212 1), in contrast to 53 (K\na\n = 28 M\u2212 1 for Me-\u03b2-Glc, K\na\n = 56 M\u2212 1 for GlcNAc). Although the binding test under neutral conditions has not been performed because of solubility problems with 57, this study suggests that selectivity among all-equatorial carbohydrates can be tuned though modification of the hydrogen-bonding property of the cage-type receptors.",

On the other hand, several tripod-type receptors have been shown to bind Man in organic solvents. Although none of tripod-type receptors thus far reported can bind carbohydrates in aqueous media, the tripod-type architecture has an advantage with regard to its simplicity in structure, which allows for easy preparation of libraries of compounds for systematic studies.

            "text": "P\u00e9rez-P\u00e9rez and coworkers have synthesized a library of tripod-type compounds and have evaluated their anti-HIV activities.107 The library is classified into three groups, the monomers (58\u201366, Fig. 18\n), dimers (67\u201375, Fig. 19\n), and trimers (76\u201381, Fig. 20\n) of the 1,3,5-triazine motif, incorporating two aromatic amino acid components (Phe, Tyr, or Trp). Each triazine motif is considered to have the tripod-type architecture, in which the 1,3,5-triazine ring is a core scaffold and the amino acid and amine groups can act as hydrophilic components. The carboxylate groups of the amino acid residues are also crucial for increasing the water solubility of the compounds. The dimers and trimers were designed based on the assumption that multivalent interaction can be realized between the two or three triazine motifs and glycans on the viral envelope. The anti-HIV activity of these compounds was evaluated as the inhibitory activity against HIV-1(IIIB) and HIV-2(ROD) replication in the CEM T-cell culture (Table VIII\n). While the monomers (58\u201366) were devoid of anti-HIV activity even at 250 \u03bcM, significant activity was observed in several dimers and trimers. Among the dimers, the Trp-containing 69 and 72 showed moderate anti-HIV activity, with EC50 values of 65 and 56 \u03bcM for HIV-1(IIIB) and 63 and 81 \u03bcM for HIV-2(ROD), respectively. Enhanced activity was observed in the trimers, especially in those having triethylbenzene as the central unit. Thus, 79\u201381 afforded EC50 values of 16\u201333 \u03bcM for both HIV-1(IIIB) and HIV-2(ROD). The same order in anti-HIV activity (trimer > dimer \u226b monomer) was also observed in binding studies to HIV-1 gp120. SPR analysis revealed that the trimer 79 bound strongly to gp120, with K\ndvalue of 1.61 \u03bcM. On the other hand, the corresponding dimer 72, which exhibited low antiviral activity, showed a much lower amplitude of binding, and binding of the corresponding inactive monomer 63 was barely detected. The strong correlation for the mono-, di-, and trimer between antiviral activity and binding affinity to HIV-1 gp120 possibly indicates that the anti-HIV activity of these tripod-type compounds is ascribed to the binding to HIV-1 gp120, and that a certain level of multivalent interactions is required to show both antiviral and binding activities. One remaining question is whether the observed affinity to HIV-1 gp120 is due to binding to the glycans or do the polyanionic compounds interact with protein areas of gp120, such as the positively charged V3 loop. Additionally, the anti-HIV activities of these compounds seem still modest compared to the activities of natural lectins. For example, the reported EC50 values of CV-N for HIV-1(IIIB) and HIV-2(ROD) are 0.003 and 0.002 \u03bcM, respectively,68, 108 and thus both of these are more than three orders of magnitude lower than those of 79. Nevertheless, this study provides strong evidence that anti-HIV drug discovery based on the tripod-type architecture is a viable approach.",

            "text": "In other work, Roelens and coworkers have explored the potential of tripod-type receptors as the antimicrobial agents.109 As already described, Roelens's group has developed a family of aminopyrrolic tripod-type compounds, some of which proved to be effective receptors for Man in polar organic solvents. The pradimicins and benanomicins (see the later section) are small-size Man receptors that occur in nature. They are reported to show potent antimicrobial activity against a wide variety of fungi and yeasts, including clinically important pathogens, by binding to mannans on the cell wall. Focusing on the similarity of Man-binding properties of the aminopyrrolic tripod-type compounds and pradimicin-related natural products, Roelens's group performed the first investigation on the antimicrobial activity of aminopyrrolic tripod-type receptors. In preliminary screening, the progenitor of the family, compound 44, and the most effective Man receptors, 46 and 47, were tested for their antimicrobial activities against Candida tropicalis, Pichia norvegensis, Prototheca wickerhamii, and Prototheca zopfii (Table IX\n). All compounds were shown to inhibit markedly the growth of the four microorganisms. In particular, the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) values of 44 were comparable for those of the well-known antibiotics, amphotericin B and ketoconazole. Structural segments (82\u201387, Fig. 21\n) of compound 44 were less active or inactive, indicating that all structural components are essential for antimicrobial activity. Analogues of 44 were also prepared, and representative examples (88\u201392) are shown in Fig. 22\n. Antimicrobial assay using a variety of yeast and yeast-like microorganisms revealed that none of the modifications, including introduction of functional groups into the pyrrole rings (88\u201390) and variation of substitution pattern on the benzene platform (91, 92), enhanced the activity of the parent compound 44 (Table X\n). The binding affinity of these compounds for Oct-\u03b1-Man was also evaluated in acetonitrile. Although this affinity may not reflect the binding for mannans in water, a broad correlation was detected between the antimicrobial activity and Man-binding affinity; compounds without antimicrobial activity lacked Man-binding ability, whereas compounds having antimicrobial activity showed detectable binding for Man. However, perfect correlation was not obtained. On the basis of these results, Roelens and coworkers proposed the interesting hypothesis that Man binding of the tripod-type compounds would facilitate the approach to the microbial cells. This would trigger a process that would subsequently involve penetration across the membrane into the cytoplasm, where the compounds might exert antimicrobial activity by interacting with a specific target. Although further research is necessary to validate this hypothesis, this pioneering study emphasizes the promising potential of tripod-type carbohydrate receptors as antimicrobial agents having a novel mode of action.",

            "text": "While there are a number of publications describing synthetic lectin mimics, only a few natural products possessing carbohydrate-binding ability have been reported. Pradimicins (PRMs) and benanomicins are the only family of naturally occurring lectin mimics with non-peptidic skeletons. In 1988, three PRMs (PRM-A, B, C) and two benanomicins (benanomicin A, B) were first isolated from actinomycetes as potential antibiotics, by Oki's and Kondo's groups, respectively.110, 111 Interestingly, these compounds were found to share a common aglycon, namely benzo[a]naphthacenequinone, and differ only in the glycon components (Fig. 23\n). Since then, benanomicin B was shown to be the same as PRM-C,112, 113 and 12 additional members of the PRM class demonstrating antimicrobial activity have been identified.114, 115, 116, 117, 118, 119, 120, 121, 122, 123, 124 These structurally unique natural products show potent in vitro antimicrobial activity against a wide variety of yeasts and fungi, and high in vivo therapeutic efficacy in murine models against Candida albicans, Cryptococcus neoformans, and Aspergillus fumigatus.\nTable XI, Table XII\nlist the in vitro and in vivo antimicrobial profiles of PRM-A. Since there is no cross-resistance to other antimicrobial agents, such as amphotericin B, 5-fluorocytosine, and ketoconazole, this family of compounds is chemically and functionally different from the other major classes of antimicrobial agents. The initial biochemical study using C. albicans found that PRM-A causes K+ leakage from the cells and binds to the outer surface of C. albicans cells in a Ca2 +-dependent manner.126 The absorption of PRM-A on C. albicans cells was found to originate from binding to mannan in the yeast cell wall. These results collectively suggest that the antimicrobial action of PRM-A is associated with alteration of the membrane permeability by binding to cell-wall mannan. This putative mechanism explains well the fact that PRM-A does not induce K+ leakage from human erythrocytes or other mammalian cells in the presence of Ca2 + ion.",

Replacement of the d-Ala component with l-amino acids, including l-Ala, abolished antimicrobial activity.127, 128 On the other hand, d-\u03b1-aminobutanoic acid, d-Phe, d-Asp, d-2,3-diaminopropanoic acid, d-Lys, Gly, and d-Ser derivatives retained the activity, indicating that stereochemistry at position 17 is crucial for the antimicrobial action of PRM-A, while the side chain of d-Ala plays only a marginal role. The amide hydrogen at position 16 seems to be important, because a complete loss of activity was observed in sarcosine (N-methylglycine) and d-Pro derivatives. The role of the carboxyl group at position 18 was also examined, using the ester and amide derivatives.129 Whereas the esters, butyl amide, and dipeptidyl derivatives showed much diminished activity, the amide, N-methylamide, and N,N-dimethylamide derivatives were as effective as PRM-A. These observations suggest that the carboxyl group at position 18 is not essential, but there are some electronic and steric requirements around this group. On the other hand, the antimicrobial activity of PRM-A is quite sensitive to chemical modifications of the benzo[a]naphthacenequinone group.130 Methylation of the 1- and 9-hydroxyl groups, substitution at positions 4 and 10, and reduction of 13-ketone group significantly decreased or abolished the activity. The position 11 is the sole site to be modified without losing activity. 11-Demethoxy-, 11-O-demethyl-, and 11-O-ethyl derivatives were as active as PRM-A. These results indicate that the benzo[a]naphthacenequinone group of PRM-A, except for position 11, plays a pivotal role in the antimicrobial action. Regarding the disaccharide group of PRM-A, the d-xylose component is apparently not essential, because PRM-B, which lacks the d-xylose group, is indistinguishable from PRM-A in its antimicrobial activity.115 Similarly, comparison of PRM-A with benanomicins A and B (PRM-C) suggests that the methylamino group at position 4\u2032 of the 4,6-dideoxy-4-methylamino-d-galactose substituent is of little importance,110 which is further supported by the observations that the activity is retained after introduction of various alkyl and acyl groups onto the methylamino group.131 In contrast, antimicrobial evaluations of synthetic derivatives having d-fucose, l-arabinose, and d-galactose in place of the 4,6-dideoxy-4-methylamino-d-galactose group showed that the stereochemistry at position 1\u2032 and the existence of the methyl group at position 6\u2032 are fairly important for the biological activity of PRM-A.132\n",

BMY-28864 (93, Fig. 25\n), which was prepared by reductive N-methylation of PRM-FA2, displays an in vitro and in vivo antimicrobial profile (Table XI, Table XII) similar to that of PRM-A, but has greater water solubility than PRM-A (0.02 mg/mL for PRM-A, > 20.0 mg/mL for 93 in phosphate-buffered saline containing 0.9 mM CaCl2 and 0.5 mM MgCl2, pH 7.2, 25 \u00b0C).125, 133, 134 The availability of sample and handling convenience enabled further studies on the mode of antimicrobial action of PRMs by using compound 93. As the first and foremost step, the carbohydrate binding of 93 was thoroughly examined. In the early studies, PRM-A was found to produce an insoluble precipitate with yeast mannan in the presence of Ca2 + ion.126 Thus, quantitative analysis of the precipitate of 93 with Ca2 + ion and methyl \u03b1-d-mannopyranoside (Me-\u03b1-Man) was initially performed.135 The molar quantity of 93, Ca2 + ion, and Me-\u03b1-Man in the precipitate was determined by UV/visible spectrophotometry, atomic absorption spectrometry, and the phenol\u2013sulfuric acid methods, respectively. The molar component ratio of 93:Ca2 +:Me-\u03b1-Man was found to be 2:1:4. The same ratio was obtained when the concentration of 93 was varied, or d-mannose was used instead of Me-\u03b1-Man for forming the precipitate, indicating that the precipitate of 93 with Ca2 + ion and Me-\u03b1-Man is a true chemical complex and not a simple mixture. By taking advantage of this complex-forming property, the carbohydrate specificity of 93 was subsequently evaluated.136 As shown in Table XIII\n, compound 93 produced precipitates with Me-\u03b2-Man, the \u03b1 and \u03b2 anomers of p-nitrophenyl d-mannopyranoside, p-aminophenyl d-mannopyranoside, d-fructose, d-arabinose, and d-lyxose, as well as d-mannose and Me-\u03b1-Man, while other carbohydrates did not form precipitates at all. The complex formation with these carbohydrates was also confirmed by UV\u2013visible spectrophotometric analysis. It is noteworthy that the carbohydrate specificity of 93 is quite high; the compound has the ability to discriminate d-mannose from l-mannose, and the 2-, 3-, and 4-epimers of d-mannose (d-glucose, d-altrose, and d-talose, respectively), d-mannosamine, and N-acetyl-d-mannosamine. These results indicate that 93 recognizes the 2-, 3-, and 4-hydroxyl groups of d-mannose, and the configuration and substituent at position 1 are not essential. However, it remains unclear as to whether the 6-hydroxyl group of d-mannose is necessary for binding to 93. In addition, there is no plausible explanation available concerning the reason why d-fructose, d-arabinose, and d-lyxose formed precipitates with 93. Oki's group proposed that these carbohydrates have an arrangement similar to 2-, 3-, and 4-hydroxyl groups of d-mannose (Fig. 26\n), and thus bind to 93 in the same manner as d-mannose. However, l-galactose and l-fucose, both of which do not form precipitates with 93, can also mimic the array of 2-, 3-, and 4-hydroxyl groups of d-mannose. Further studies are necessary to clarify these issues. In addition, however, the metal specificity of 93 was examined by UV\u2013visible spectrophotometric analysis and two biological assays, yeast-cell absorption, and potassium leakage induction tests.136 The results collectively suggest that Sr2 + and Cd2 + ions, which have ionic radii similar to that of the Ca2 + ion (1.05 \u00c5 for Ca2 +, 1.18 \u00c5 for Sr2 +, 0.99 \u00c5 for Cd2 +), can also form the ternary complexes with 93 and mannan.",

Oki's group examined the Ca2 + salt-forming ability of PRM-A, compound 93, and their derivatives (94\u2013100, Fig. 27\n) and found that the ester derivatives (94, 95, 98) formed no Ca2 + salts, whereas PRM-A, 93, and the other derivatives (96, 97, 99, and 100), having the carboxyl group free, produced the Ca2 + salts with a PRM:Ca2 + ratio of 2:1.137 Although the hydroxyl groups on the benzo[a]naphthacenequinone group also have the potential to bind Ca2 + ion, these observations suggest that the carboxyl group of PRMs is a possible binding site for Ca2 + ion. This hypothesis was partially supported by solution NMR analysis of the formation of the Ca2 + salt of 93.138, 139, 140 Significant change in chemical shifts upon addition of CaCl2 was observed for the proton signals at positions 3-Me, 4, and 7 of 93. On the other hand, the proton signals at positions 10 and 12 showed little change, indicating that the Ca2 +-binding site is near the A ring but not around the E ring of PRMs. The Man-binding process of PRMs was investigated using 93 by Lee and coworkers.141 UV\u2013visible spectrophotometric analysis demonstrated that two molecules of PRM bind four molecules of Man in two separate steps. As shown in Scheme 4\n, the [PRM2/Ca2 +] salt initially binds two molecules of Man to form the ternary [PRM2/Ca2 +/Man2] complex, which then incorporates another two molecules of Man to form the ultimate ternary [PRM2/Ca2 +/Man4] complex. This complicated three-component equilibrium, along with the aggregation-forming property of PRMs, has collectively made it difficult to analyze the molecular interaction of PRMs and Man by conventional methods of solution NMR.",

The first stage of the analysis explored the role of Ca2 + ion on the binding of Man with PRM-A.142 As already described, Cd2 + ion can act as a surrogate for Ca2 + ion in the binding of Man to PRMs. Accordingly, we conducted cross-polarization/magic angle spinning (CP/MAS) 113Cd-NMR spectroscopic experiments with solid samples of the PRM-A/113Cd2 + salt and the ternary PRM-A/113Cd2 +/Me-\u03b1-Man complex (Fig. 28\n). The 113Cd NMR spectrum of the PRM-A/113Cd2 + salt exhibited a broad signal around \u03b4\n = \u201350 ppm, which is similar to those reported for solid cadmium compounds containing two carboxyl groups, such as Cd(OAc)2\u00b7H2O (\u03b4\n = \u201346 ppm) and Cd(O2CCH2CH2CO2)\u00b72H2O (\u03b4\n = \u201352 ppm).143, 144 This result indicates that the 113Cd2 + ion binds to the carboxyl group of PRM-A and also supports the hypothesis that Ca2 + ion bridges the carboxylate groups of two PRM molecules to produce the Ca2 + salts having a PRM:Ca2 + ratio of 2:1. In contrast, the ternary PRM-A/113Cd2 +/Me-\u03b1-Man complex exhibited a sharp signal at \u03b4\n = \u2013135 ppm, which was markedly shifted upfield (> 80 ppm) in comparison with that of the PRM-A/113Cd2 + salt (\u03b4\n = \u201350 ppm), suggesting the occurrence of a change in 113Cd2 + coordination upon binding of Me-\u03b1-Man to the PRM-A/113Cd2 + salt. Since 113Cd signals upfield of \u03b4\n = \u2013100 ppm are observed only for 113Cd2 + coordinated with more than six oxygen ligands,143 it is reasonable to assume that the hydroxyl group(s) of Me-\u03b1-Man coordinates to 113Cd2 + ion in the PRM-A/113Cd2 + salt. The realistic implication of these results is that PRM-A binds at least one molecule of Man in a Ca2 +-mediated manner through its carboxylate group.",

On the basis of this assumption, our subsequent analysis was directed at identifying the Man-binding site in PRM-A.145 Several lines of evidence have suggested that PRM-A possesses two binding sites exhibiting different affinities for Man.135, 141 Although it is undoubtedly difficult to search simultaneously two Man-binding sites of PRM-A, we successfully prepared an aggregate composed solely of the [PRM-A2/Ca2 +/Me-\u03b1-Man2] complex, in which only the Man-binding site of stronger affinity was occupied by Me-\u03b1-Man. Me-\u03b1-Man was found to be released from the weaker binding site during the process of washing the aggregate composed of the [PRM-A2/Ca2 +/Me-\u03b1-Man4] complex. The simple 1:1 complexes of biosynthetically 13C-enriched PRM-As and Me-\u03b1-[13C6]Man facilitated the analysis, by two-dimensional dipolar-assisted rotational resonance (2D-DARR), of the stronger binding site for Man.146, 147, 148 In 2D-DARR spectra, dipolar interactions between 13C nuclei that are located within a 6 \u00c5 distance can be detected as cross peaks, permitting evaluation of intermolecular close contacts between PRM-A and Me-\u03b1-Man. The 2D-DARR analyses detected close interactions between the d-alanine residue (C-17, 17-Me, C-18) and the 3-Me, C-4, C-5, and C-14 of PRM-A with Me-\u03b1-Man (Fig. 29\n). These close contacts are simultaneously compatible when Man is located on the same face of the A ring as the d-alanine group and the C-14 carbon atom, suggesting that the cavity consisting of the d-alanine group and the ABC rings is the stronger binding site for Man (Fig. 30\n). Similar CP/MAS 113Cd-NMR and DARR experiments using compound 93 confirmed that the mode of binding of Ca2 + ion and Man is nearly identical between PRM-A and 93.149\n",

It is particularly interesting that the architecture of PRM-A, the naturally occurring lectin mimic, seems conceptually similar to that of tripod-type lectin mimics (Fig. 9); the A ring provides the hydrophobic surface for CH/\u03c0 interaction, and the d-alanine, anthraquinone, and disaccharide components serve as hydrophilic units. Although more investigations are necessary to validate this model, these studies provide an important step toward the full elucidation of the molecular basis of the recognition of Man by PRM-A.",

Time-of-drug-addition studies demonstrated that PRM-A as well as the mannose-specific plant lectin HHA needed to be present from the beginning of the virus infection to fully suppress the infection. This observation supports the assumption that an early event in the infection cycle of HIV is the target of therapeutic intervention by PRM-A. The inhibition of the HIV entry process by PRM-A through interaction with gp120 was further confirmed by the complete loss of the inhibitory effect of PRM-A against VSV-G-pseudotyped HIV-1, which lacks gp120 in the envelope. The SPR analysis revealed that PRM-A significantly bound to gp120 in a Ca2 +-dependent manner, with a K\nd value of \u223c 2.7 \u03bcM, suggesting the possibility that PRM-A inhibits entry of the virus by binding to high mannose-type glycans of gp120 in a manner similar to those of natural lectins. In accordance with this hypothesis, HIV-1 strains selected under increasing pressure of PRM-A were found to contain up to eight different glycan deletions in gp120, most of which were high mannose-type glycans. Such deletion at similar glycosylation sites was also observed for such mannose-specific plant lectins as HHA, GNA, and CN-V. Thus, PRM-A can act as a lectin in terms of glycan recognition, antiviral activity, and pattern of drug resistance.",

Drug resistance selection experiments using PRM-S demonstrated that PRM-S, like PRM-A, selected for drug-resistant mutant virus strains contained deletions at various N-glycosylation sites of HIV-1 gp120, showing that PRM-S as well as PRM-A has a strong preference for binding to high mannose-type glycans.

In contrast to the conventional strategies of designing drugs that have as high a genetic barrier as possible to delay the development of drug resistance, the proposed approach makes use of viral variability and the inherent viral replication to generate mutant virus strains having deletions of glycosylation sites on gp120. Moreover, this therapeutic concept is unique in regard to its use of concerned action of drug chemotherapy\u2014triggering the immune system in the host (\u201cself-vaccination\u201d) by the administration of one single drug. It is also noteworthy that carbohydrate receptors can interact with a target gp120 molecule in a non-stoichiometric manner. All existing anti-HIV drugs, such as reverse-transcriptase inhibitors and protease inhibitors, bind to only one target molecule. As a result, one or a few mutations that appear in a target usually elicit a marked degree of drug resistance. On the other hand, several carbohydrate receptor molecules can bind to one gp120 molecule bearing 20\u201329 glycans at the same time, resulting in a high genetic barrier for HIV to overcome. Obviously, this effect becomes more significant for the smaller carbohydrate receptors, PRM-A and PRM-S, because a larger number of molecules can simultaneously bind to gp120 without steric hindrance. They also have additional advantages over protein lectins in regard to chemical stability and productivity. Although their antiviral activity is less pronounced than that of lectins, these lectin mimics possessing beneficial characteristics for drug development may be very suitable candidates as conceptually novel anti-HIV drugs.",

Consequently, there is a rapidly growing interest in small molecules having carbohydrate-binding properties (lectin mimics). Progress in the study of synthetic lectin mimics has laid an excellent foundation for the future development of diagnostic and therapeutic agents based on carbohydrate recognition. The boronic acid-dependent lectin mimics are designed to form covalent bonds with carbohydrates in aqueous media, and several examples have been successfully shown to act as possible sensors for such biologically important biomarkers as sialyl Lewis X and the TF antigen. An especially encouraging result was obtained for boronic acid-dependent lectin mimics having peptide backbones, in which such non-covalent interactions as hydrogen bonding and CH/\u03c0 interaction also contribute to carbohydrate recognition. The combination of covalent interactions with boronic acid components and non-covalent interactions with other functional groups may be a promising strategy for designing a new generation of boronic acid-dependent lectin mimics that can act as diagnostic and therapeutic agents.",
