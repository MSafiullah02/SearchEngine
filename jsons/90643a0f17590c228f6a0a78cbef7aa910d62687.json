This divergence may suggest the same ancestral origin with the CPV strains of Asian origin but a separate evolution, as well as a continuous adaptive process of the virus in separate environments. Indeed, some of these changes lay in the potential encoding sequence of functional domains (Mira, Canuti, et al., 2019) and, particularly, residues 351, 517 and 545 are located between the \u03b15-and \u03b16-helices, between the \u03b25-and \u03b111-helices and just close to the \u03b111-helix of the helicase domain protein sequence, respectively, as illustrated in Niskanen, Ihalainen, Kalliolinna, H\u00e4kkinen, and Vihinen-Ranta (2010) .

These data showed a high prevalence of CPV-2c (91.5%) compared to the CPV-2a variant (8.5%), without any evidence of CPV-2b. Moreover, the divergence in the VP2 gene sequence of the CPV strains compared to those previously circulating in Nigeria suggests the potential circulation or introduction of different strains during years. Indeed, despite the limits of the length of available sequences, the CPV strains analysed in this study are prone to be related to a different origin than the previous ones. All CPV strains collected in 2010(Dogonyaro et al., 2013) displayed divergent amino acids at specific VP2 residues(267, 324)with a closer phylogenetic connection with the CPV-2a strains previously collected in other continents such as North/South America and Europe. Differently, since 2014 the analysed circulating CPV strains showed a closer connection with CPV strains of Asian origin.Despite some previously analysed CPV sequences lack of informative VP2 aa residues(5, 267, 324, 370), the comparison with our sequences suggested that both CPV-2a and CPV-2c strains collected in Nigeria after 2014 have a different phylogenetic origin with respect to previous analyses(Apaa et al., 2016;Fagbohun & Omobowale, 2018), suggesting a most recent introduction and spreading.The analysis included both ORFs and allowed to gain additional information. Indeed, in this study the whole VP gene sequences were analysed, showing the VP1 and VP2 aa changes K116R and A5G, respectively.
