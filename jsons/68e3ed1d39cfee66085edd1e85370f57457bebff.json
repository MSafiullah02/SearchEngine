            "text": "A variety of display technologies, such as Phage or mRNA display, are used for selection of the new binders against wide range of antigens [1] [2] [3] . In Phage display, a DNA library encoding millions of variants of a specific antibody is cloned in fusion to a phage coat protein such that each phage expresses a slightly different specific binder on its surface. The DNA encoding each binder is then contained within each phage, allowing a direct linkage between the DNA sequence and functionality of the binding protein to the target antigen. The selection relies on an affinity enrichment process known as Biopanning [3, 4] . The Biopanning process includes three parts: binding of phage to the target antigen, washing out the non-binding phages, and then elution of binding phage. The target antigens used for Biopanning are typically highly purified recombinant proteins that are immobilized on either beads or solid supports such as ELISA multi-well plates. Solid-support immobilization methods require less target protein and facilitate the selection multiple targets simultaneously. However, in both methods, the quality and yield of the recombinant protein have an essential role in the generation of antibodies [5] . For every new Biopanning selection process ~ 1 mg of purified recombinant protein is required (typically 1-100\u00b5g/ml for each well of a microtiter plate). In many laboratory applications, the purification of new target antigen proteins can present a serious bottleneck to developing new binders, since each new target can require an entirely new expression and purification method to be developed.",

This method was developed for affinity selection of a specific protein in crude lysate without purification. This procedure was done by saturation of nonbinder antibodies in non-expressed bacterial lysate, with blocking agents in ELISA wells, followed by selection of specific binders from expressed lysates in wells. This method was used for development of MERS-CoV nucleoprotein specific antibody. Although this method is very cost effective, it must be optimized for every target protein. Fierle et al. have used bacterial superglue for specific capture of antigen from crude lysate [7] . This method is based on covalent peptide-protein interaction of SpyTag (SpyT) and SpyCatcher (SpyC) from Streptococcus pyogenes [8] . In practice, the SpyTag is chemically synthesized and conjugated onto beads, while the corresponding SpyCatcher protein is expressed as a fusion partner with several cancer antigens expressed in a recombinant eukaryotic host system. The SpyCatcher fusion protein was specifically captured onto the bead-based solid phase and then used specific-antibody selection. This interaction is efficient and highly specific. However, it is relatively expensive due to chemical synthesis and conjugation of SpyTag.",

It reversibly aggregates and becomes insoluble in the presence of low concentrations of calcium (25mM) and remains insoluble until the calcium is removed by EDTA or other strong chelating agent. At this calcium concentration most bacterial proteins remain soluble, making it possible to isolate RTX-fusion proteins from whole lysates by simple centrifugation. By washing the RTX fusion pellet several times, it is possible to achieve pure a protein. Addition of metal chelators such as EDTA/EGTA in equivalent concentration reverts the RTX tag to soluble form. The RTX-based purification is illustrated in Figure 1 . Addition of a solubility enhancer (in this work Trx) enhanced the production yield. For pET32-RTX-SpyC002, ~6.5 mg of pure protein was purified from 200ml of shake-flask culture, where the pellet was washed 5 times. It was noted that after the third round of washing the purity of the protein didn't change, indicating that 3 wash cycles are suitable for protein purification (Figure 2A ). This procedure was repeated for Trx-RTX-GFP ( Figure 2B ) and SpyT002-MBP-RTX-GFP ( Figure 2C) , where 3.3 mg and 1.5 mg of purified protein was achieved respectively. For SpyT002-MBP-RTX-GFP, after every round of washing the pellet size decreased significantly, and for this reason the yield of this protein is lower than the others.",

            "text": "To assess the maximum possible signal at different concentrations of reacted SpyT002-GFP fusion protein to the coated SpyC, the purified Trx-RTX-GFP test protein was \u00bd serially diluted from 100 to 0.78 \u00b5g/ml (from A-H) and was used as positive control. The signal of the positive control was approximately 3 (OD 450nm) in all concentrations. At a constant concentration of SpyC (100 \u00b5g/ml), the signal of SpyT at concentrations ranging from 500 to 15\u00b5g/ml was similar to the positive control. The signal decreased significantly at 7.8 \u00b5g/ml (86 nM) and 3.9 \u00b5g/ml (43nM) of SpyT concentration. The SpyT lysate signal was somewhat lower due to impurity, but followed pure protein pattern ( Figure 4A ). In serially diluted SpyC, the signal was maximum at 200 nM concentration of SpyC ( Figure 4B ). At lower concentrations the signal decreased to about 40% of positive control at 12nM. According to the result of the SpyT purified and lysate samples, for 100 \u00b5g/ml concentration of SpyC, the minimum concentration of SpyT that is required for a high reaction rate in 2h at 30 \u00b0C is ~173 nM of SpyT protein (in this work ~15 \u00b5g/ml) ( Figure 4C ). However, it is possible to use lower concentrations, but with a slower reaction rate. Serial dilution of SpyC results showed that the minimum concentration of SpyC required for a high reaction rate is between 100 and 200 nM (~6.25-12.5\u00b5g/ml) and in this case at least ~350 to 700nM of SpyT (in this work ~31-62.5\u00b5g/ml) is required ( Figure 4D ). These results match the original Spy002 article, which reports that the reaction rate in 100 nm SpyC is ~70% [9] .",

Since the development of this method in 2012, its applications are expanding along with its potential [22] . In this work we have combined a non-chromatographic method with the spy catcher002 protein to generate a potentially cost-effective universal capture method for immobilization of SpyT-fusion recombinant proteins from unpurified feeds. The RTX-mediated protein purification takes 1 to 2 hours, without any specific equipment. As mentioned above, we produced ~6 mg of purified fusion protein in one example, which is theoretically suitable for the generation of hundreds of ELISA wells. Conversely, the sample size is also small, which subsequently decreases the required culture volume. In addition, this system is sensitive to small amounts of recombinant protein, which is ideal for low-expressing recombinant proteins or in mammalian transient expression systems. However, low concentrations of recombinant protein (100nM for both partners) may show different results due to reaction rate dependence of Spy variant 002 on protein concentration. Recently, variant 003 of this method has been developed [23] . Increased sensitivity of this method to even sub-nanomolar concentrations may be possible by applying Spy003. As both ELISA and Spy tag-protein are compatible with urea, it is possible to use this method with urea to dissolve inclusion bodies and continue process steps with immobilized protein. This method is also helpful for the study of SpyT fusion vaccines and for studies of immunization or in labon chip methods. ",

Products of the TRX-RTX-SpyC002 purification steps, as well as purified Trx-RTX-GFP and SpyT002-MBPRTX-GFP proteins of were analyzed by SDS-PAGE.Protein concentration was measure using a Bradford Assay[12] with Bovine Serum Albumin (BSA) used as a standard. The standard curve was generated according nanodrop 2000 protocol by using 125, 250, 500, 1000 and 2000 \u00b5g BSA/mL water. Clarified lysate samples were diluted 1:100 and purified product samples were diluted 1:50 in water.To test the SpyT-SpyC interaction, 200 \u00b5g of purified SpyT002-MBP-RTX-GFP and 1 mg Trx-RTXSpyC002 were mixed and incubated for 2h at 30 \u00b0C. The samples then analyzed by SDS-PAGE.2.6.Indirect Sandwich-like ELISAThe purified Trx-RTX-SpyC002 was diluted in PBS buffer to a final concentration of 100 \u00b5g/ml. It was coated on ELISA wells either at constant (100 \u00b5g/ml) or \u00bd serial dilution concentrations (100, 50, 25, 12.5, 6.25, 3.125, 1.56 and 0.78 \u00b5g/ml) in 100 \u00b5l samples at 4 \u00b0C overnight. The wells were then washed with TBST buffer (Tris-buffered saline, pH 7.4, with 0.1 % (v/v) Tween 20) 5x times. The coated wells were blocked with 1.0% BSA in PBST buffer (PBS with 0.1 % (v/v) Tween 20) for 1 h at 37 \u00b0C. The wells were then washed with TBST buffer 3x times. At this point coated SpyC is ready for capture of the SpyT fusion protein.To assess Maximum signal of anti-GFP in different concentration, purified Trx-RTX-GFP was used as positive control and serially diluted from 100 to 0.75 \u00b5g/ml and coated according to the previous steps described above. As SpyT reacts with SpyC in a 1:1 molar ratio, the signal of reacted Spy-T-GFP to SpyC at different concentrations with a respective positive control indicates the reaction rate for each respective concentration.SpyT002-MBP-RTX-GFP in either pure and cleared lysate form (from step 2.4.) was diluted in PBS-T buffer to final concentration of 500 \u00b5g/ml. Then, serially diluted samples at 500, 250, 125, 62.5, 31.25, 15.6, 7.8 and 3.9 \u00b5g/ml in 100\u00b5l buffer volume were incubated with SpyC coated wells for 2h at 30 \u00b0C. The wells where then washed with TBST buffer 5x times, and 100 \u00b5l of a 1:5000 dilution of Primary antibody (anti-GFP) was added and incubated for 1h at 37 \u00b0C. The wells were then washed with TBST buffer 5 times and a 1:5000 dilution HRP-conjugated antibody (anti-Rat) was added and incubated for 1h at 37 \u00b0C. The wells were then washed with TBST buffer 5 times. To develop a signal, 100 \u00b5l TMB substrate was added to each well and incubated for 15min in darkness. The reaction was then stopped by addition of an equivalent volume of 0.3M H 2 SO 4 . The wells were then read at 450 nm.",
