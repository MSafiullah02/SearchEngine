However, nucleic acid detection is affected by factors such as insufficient kits, patients' immune status, disease course, and slow test reports, which complicate the diagnostic process. Chest high-resolution computed tomography (HRCT) is an important method for detecting lung abnormalities. It plays an irreplaceable role in the screening of suspected patients, the diagnosis and differential diagnosis of diseases, clinical classification, assessment of disease progression, detection of pulmonary complications, and follow-up after discharge [6].",

The focus was to observe whether lesions identified on the HRCT images involved both lungs and several lung lobes. A detailed analysis and evaluation of the imaging appearance concerning each of the lesions identified included: (i) the number of lesions, (\u2171) the specific distribution of the lung lobe, (iii) the area of the lung field involved, (iv) lesion size, (v) lesion density, and (vi) whether signs of air bronchogram and dilatation were combined. In this study, lung lobe distribution information included the right upper lobe, the right middle lobe, the right lower lobe, the left upper lobe, and the left lower lobe. The distribution of the lung field included the periphery (the outer one-third region of the lung), the central zone (the area inside the inner two-third region of the lung), and whether the peripheral and central zones were affected simultaneously. The transverse CT consecutive 1.25 mm slice thickness for high-resolution reconstruction scan, the largest layer of the lesion was selected, and the largest diameter of the lesion was measured. Lesions were divided into small patchy or nodular opacity (size of <1 cm in long diameter), patchy or nodular opacity (1\u22123 cm), medium patchy opacity (3\u22125 cm), and large patchy opacity (5\u221210 cm), and larger patchy opacity (size \u226510 cm). In terms of density of a lesion identified using HRCT, this was assessed as either pure ground-glass opacity (PGGO), ground-glass opacity (GGO) with interlobular septa thickening or with a crazy-paving pattern, a mixed GGO with consolidation<50 %, a mixed GGO with consolidation\u226550 %, and a complete consolidation. When the number of lesions per lobe was >5, only 5 obvious lesions t were analyzed. We determined whether mediastinal lymphadenopathy (defined as lymph node size of \u22651 cm in short-axis dimension), pleural effusion, and other abnormal changes were also present. If there was disagreement concerning analysis of the signs, a third chief physician (Zuhua Chen) was consulted to reach a consensus.",

This finding may be related to the thick and short physiological structure of the right lower lobe bronchus, which may have allowed the virus to enter this area more easily. In addition, whether the air bronchogram is associated with the central representation needs further study. The lesions of patients were mostly distributed in peripheral zone of the lung (80.7 %), probably because the virus mainly affects the terminal bronchioles and lung parenchyma around the respiratory bronchioles in the early stage [10]. In patients, GGO with a crazy paving pattern or interlobular septum thickening was the most common sign (48.8 %), with PGGO (33.2 %) the second-most common.

With increase in age, the lesions appeared to be mostly GGO with interlobular septum thickening or a crazy paving pattern, and the possibility of the appearance of 5\u201310 cm large patchy opacity and \u226510 cm larger patchy opacity was likely to increase. Our study findings showed that middle-aged and older patients had more severe lung involvement and lobe involvement and, at the same time, the lesions were accompanied more often by air bronchograms. Possible reasons for these findings are as follows: 1) adolescent cases are mostly third-generation infection cases, which may involve mainly family cluster cases. Furthermore, COVID-19 has weak virulence, resulting in lighter imaging signs in these patients [7]; 2) minors have immature lung structure development, resulting in atypical HRCT signs, and; 3) a COVID-19 attack on the immune system is more likely to cause diffuse alveolar damage and a large number of inflammatory exudations in middle-aged and older patients with more baseline diseases. In one patient, bilateral pleural effusion was found, which may be due to the adjacent inflammation stimulating the pleura.",

In this study, the key finding is that the middle-aged and elderly patients have the most severe representation of parenchymal findings, and follow with the morphological appearance that seems to be particularly limited in youngest group, which provides certain support for clinical individualized treatment of patients of different ages. Chest HRCT scans are helpful for screening, treatment management, and follow-up evaluation of suspected patients with COVID-19 infections, and they are complementary to clinical symptoms (fever), epidemiological history (direct or indirect exposure to people from Wuhan), and laboratory indicators. Therefore, it is essential to make full use of chest HRCT scans to achieve a comprehensive diagnosis and guide treatment for patients with COVID-19 infection. It is worth noting that the epidemiological pre-test risk drives the diagnosis towards COVID-19, which otherwise does not have a specific pattern compared to any other infectious interstitial infiltrate with further diffuse alveolar damage (DAD) or organizing pneumonia (OP).",
