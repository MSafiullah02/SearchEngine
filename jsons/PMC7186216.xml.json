However, over the last decade, our appreciation of the importance and distribution of viruses has expanded beyond the original parasitic\u2013pathogen model, and now virologists recognize the role of viruses in host regulation and the maintenance of natural ecosystems9. Shotgun metagenomic sequencing has also revealed the presence of a vast variety of viruses in diverse environmental samples and in apparently healthy organisms from all divisions of life10\u201313.",

In contrast to the taxonomies of cellular organisms, this new virus taxonomic framework will have to accommodate the current view that viruses have multiple origins (polyphyly) and that their diversity cannot be represented by a single virosphere-wide tree14.",

Thus, there was little impetus to extend the taxonomy rank structure. The result was a taxonomy that, in profound contrast to its cellular counterparts, included many disjointed taxa, the number of which increases with the accelerating discovery of novel viruses (exceeding 100 families in 2018). However, classification efforts continued outside of the official taxonomic framework and, over the last few decades, several informal groupings such as \u2018supergroups\u2019 or \u2018superfamilies\u2019 were proposed for subsets of RNA viruses21\u201323 and DNA viruses24\u201328. These groupings relate to otherwise seemingly disparate viruses belonging to different families and have a variety of different hosts, genome types and organizations, and replication mechanisms. Importantly, these groupings have relied on distant relationships often associated with structure\u2013function hypotheses (for example, an essential virus protein involved in virus replication or virion morphogenesis), which were then validated in subsequent experimental studies29\u201331; these provided independent support for the inferred classifications.",

Other ranks may be used optionally when the scientific justification is sufficient. The new 15-rank taxonomic structure applies to all viruses, although none have been assigned to all ranks thus far. To illustrate the application of some of the newly established ranks, Fig. 2 and Table 1 show the full current classification and taxa demarcation criteria of two viruses with RNA genomes, Ebola virus (EBOV) and severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV). Both viruses are well-known human pathogens and members of the species Zaire ebolavirus and Severe acute respiratory syndrome-related coronavirus, respectively. Although both of these viruses infect humans, they differ taxonomically in the ranks that are populated and the demarcation criteria that define the taxa. Only at the basal, realm rank are the two viruses included in the same taxon, Riboviria. Figure 2 also shows the corresponding information for another human pathogen, herpes simplex virus 1, which has a double-stranded DNA genome and is currently assigned to taxa of five \u2018traditional\u2019 ranks.",

This will include the consideration of numerous supergroups and superfamilies that have remained outside of virus taxonomy to date. At the time of writing (January 2020), the ranks included highly different numbers of taxa (Fig. 1). As expected, the species rank, with the lowest degree of intra-taxon virus divergence, is the most heavily populated, and ranks with higher degrees of intra-taxon divergence are the least populated. This highly uneven distribution of the number of taxa assigned at different ranks is due not only to the hierarchical relationship of the ranks, but also to the very recent introduction of the more basal ranks, and the lack of requirement to fill these ranks. The uneven distribution also reflects variations in the sampling of different virus lineages in diverse hosts as well as differences in the approaches adopted for the recognition of taxa in particular species by different ICTV Study Groups.",

Genomic sequences of ebolaviruses of different species differ from each other by \u226523%. Genomic sequences of filoviruses of different genera differ from each other by \u226555%. Genomic features, such as number and location of gene overlaps, ebolavirus host and geographic distribution, and ebolavirus pathogenicity for different organisms, are also considered for species assignment, while genomic features, such as number and location of gene overlaps, number of open reading frames (ORFs) and/or genes, filovirus host and geographic distribution, and filovirus pathogenicity for different organisms, are also taken into account for genus assignment. Phylogenetic relationships across the genus have been established from maximum likelihood trees generated using coding-complete or complete genome sequences or by analysing filovirus large protein amino acid sequences43. bNidovirus taxa demarcation and rank assignment were defined by DivErsity pArtitioning by hieRarchical Clustering (DEmARC) analysis, a distance-based method with improved predictive power44 and inferred biological relevance45. The analysis sought minima of clustering cost in the distribution of pairwise distances derived from a maximum likelihood tree of the concatenated 3CLPro, NiRAN, RdRP, ZBD and HEL domains of the replicase polyprotein in all available sequences of viruses of the suborder Cornidovirineae. These minimum numbers were converted into percentages of amino acid identity that serve as a proxy for the selected minima. For the demarcation of the suborders, the order-wide analysis was performed. Members of the species, subgenus, genus, subfamily and family taxa form phylogenetically compact lineages in the Coronaviridae tree. Members of the suborder taxa form phylogenetically compact lineages in the Nidovirales tree (see ref. 46). 3CLpro, 3C-like protease; NiRAN, nidovirus RdRp-associated nucleotidyltransferase; RdRp, RNA-directed RNA polymerase; ZBD, Zn-binding domain covalently linked to HEL1; HEL1, helicase of superfamily 1.",
