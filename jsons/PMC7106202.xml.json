            "text": "Shortly after its emergence in southern China in 2002/2003, Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) was confirmed to be the cause of SARS (Peiris et al., 2003). There has been a total of 8096 laboratory-confirmed cases of SARS, leading to 774 mortalities in 11 countries (World Health Organization, 2004). Subsequently, SARS-related CoV (SARSr-CoV) was found in palm civets from live animal markets in Guangdong province (Guan et al., 2003). However, the initial hypothesis that civets may act as animal reservoir of SARS-CoV was soon overturned by several observations. Firstly, SARSr-CoV was only detected in civets from the market, but not those in the wild (Kan et al., 2005; Tu et al., 2004). Secondly, the high ratio of nonsynonymous to synonymous mutation rates (Ka/Ks ratios) of the Spike (S), open reading frame (ORF) 3a and non-structural protein (nsp) genes in civet SARSr-CoVs collected in both the 2003 and the minor 2004 outbreaks suggested that the virus was undergoing rapid evolutionary gene adaptation in civets (Song et al., 2005). Thirdly, compared with SARS-CoV collected from human during the 2003 epidemic, functional changes have been observed in the S protein of civet SARSr-CoV and the SARS-CoV isolated from the 2004 minor outbreak. The latter showed less efficient use of the human angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor (Li et al., 2005b) and demonstrated resistance to antibody inhibition (Yang et al., 2005). Finally, while significant levels of antibody to SARS-CoV were detected in 80% of the civets from one animal market in Guangzhou, low seroprevalence rates in civets from various civet farms in China suggested that civets were largely brought to the animal market infection-free (Guan et al., 2003; Tu et al., 2004). The SARSr-CoV was likely contracted during later mixing and trading.",

Among the 127 bats (including 8 bat species), 20 monkeys and 60 rodents surveyed, SARSr-CoV was only detected in 39% of the fecal samples of 59 Chinese horseshoe bats (Rhinolophus sinicus, Rs) (Lau et al., 2005). Western blot analysis showed that antibodies against the nucleocapsid (N) protein of bat SARSr-CoV was present in 67% of the serum samples of Chinese horseshoe bats, while 8% of the serum of Chinese horseshoe bats were tested positive for human SARS-CoV-neutralizing antibody with titer \u22651:20 (Lau et al., 2005). Shortly afterward, another independent group also reported the detection of SARSr-CoV in Chinese horseshoe bats, greater horseshoe bats (Rhinolophus ferrumequinum, Rf), and big-eared horseshoe bats (Rhinolophus macrotis, Rm) in Hubei and Guangxi provinces of China (Li et al., 2005a). In the past few years, SARSr-CoVs have been isolated from a variety of horseshoe bats in Yunnan province of China by several groups (Ge et al., 2013; He et al., 2014; Hu et al., 2017; Lau et al., 2015).",

Its genome structure follows the characteristic gene order of other known CoVs: the 5\u2032 two thirds of the genome comprises ORF1ab encoding replicase polyproteins, while the 3\u2032 one third consists of genes encoding structural proteins including S, envelope (E), membrane (M), and N proteins (Fig. 1\n). Both the 5\u2032 and 3\u2032 ends of the SARS-CoV genome contain short untranslated regions. The translational product of ORF1ab is cleaved by proteases encoded by SARS-CoV itself into 16 nsps, which include major enzymes such as papain-like protease(s) (PLpro), chymotrypsin-like protease (3CLpro), RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) and helicase (Hel) (Fig. 1). In contrast to the genome of viruses belonging to lineage A Betacoronavirus (recently renamed as subgenera Embecovirus), haemagglutinin-esterase gene is absent from the genome of SARS-CoV. In addition, SARS-CoV contains 6\u20137 accessory proteins, encoded by ORF3a, ORF3b, ORF6, ORF7a, ORF7b and ORF8 [or ORF8a and ORF8b as a result of a 29-nucleotide (nt) deletion]. This is unique to lineage B Betacoronavirus, a subgenus recently renamed Sarbecovirus and contains all SARSr-CoVs (Fig. 2\n).",

Protein 3b inhibits type I interferon and also induces apoptosis. Protein 6 inhibits interferon signaling and stimulates DNA synthesis. Protein 7a activates NF-\u03baB (nuclear factor kappa B) and MAPK8 (mitogen-activated protein kinase 8) for CXCL8 and RANTES production. The function of protein 7b is not well characterized yet. ORF8 is present in all SARSr-CoV genomes in bats and civets, as well as in SARS-CoVs isolated from human during the early phase of the epidemic. Protein 8 activates the ATF6 (activating transcription factor 6) branch of unfolded protein response. In the genomes of SARS-CoVs isolated from human during the late phase of the epidemic, there was a signature 29-nt deletion in ORF8, splitting it into two separate ORFs 8a and 8b. Protein 8a includes caspase-dependent apoptosis whereas protein 8b modulates cellular DNA synthesis.",

In 2011, the Coronavirus Study Group of the International Committee for Taxonomy of Viruses renamed these three groups into three genera: Alphacoronavirus, Betacoronavirus, and Gammacoronavirus (de Groot et al., 2011). When SARS-CoV was first discovered in 2003, phylogenetic analysis of the SARS-CoV genome showed that it occupied a unique position in Betacoronavirus, which was subsequently placed into the subgenus Sarbecovirus. The traditional betaCoVs (e.g. mouse hepatitis virus, human CoV OC43, bovine CoV) were classified as Embecovirus (Fig. 2). After the SARS epidemic, an unprecedented number of novel CoVs were discovered (Lau et al., 2016; Lau et al., 2007; Lau et al., 2012a; Lau et al., 2012b; Lau et al., 2014; Woo et al., 2005; Woo et al., 2014a; Woo et al., 2014b).

For the 47 bat SARSr-CoV genomes, 30 are from Chinese horseshoe bats, 9 from greater horseshoe bats, 2 from big-eared horseshoe bat, 2 from least horseshoe bat (Rhinolophus pusillus, Rp), and 1 each from intermediate horseshoe bat (Rhinolophus affinis, Ra), Blasius's horseshoe bat (Rhinolophus blasii, Rb), Stoliczka's Asian trident bat (Aselliscus stoliczkanus, As) in the neighboring family Hipposideridae and wrinkled-lipped free-tailed bat (Chaerephon plicata, Cp) in the genetically more distant family Molossidae. SARSr-CoVs have also been detected in countries other than China, including Thailand, Italy, Luxembourg, Bulgaria, Slovenia, Hungary, Japan, Kenya, etc. However, only partial sequences were available for these isolates.

Overall, it is observed that the SARSr-CoV genomes from bats in Yunnan possess relatively higher, whereas those from Guangdong, Jilin, Shanxi and Hebei possess relatively lower nt identity to those from civets (Fig. 3A). This is an interesting phenomenon since the SARS epidemic that emerged in late 2002 was first noticed in Guangdong province as an outbreak of acute community-acquired atypical pneumonia syndrome. Severe cases were later retrospectively traced back to five cities around Guangzhou, with the index case reported in Foshan, a city 24 km away from Guangzhou. The second case was a chef from Heyuan who worked in a restaurant in Shenzhen who contacted with wild game-food animals regularly. This mismatch between clinical events and apparent gradient of nt identity could either be due to a missing link during evolutionary adaptation among the SARSr-CoVs in different provinces or simply as a result of sampling error.",

As for SARSr-CoVs, it is evident from both multiple alignments and phylogenetic analyses that some genes of a particular SARSr-CoV from bats may possess higher while other genes possess much lower nt identity to the corresponding genes of SARSr-CoV genomes from human/civets, resulting in shifting of phylogenetic position in different phylogenetic trees.

Like other class I viral fusion proteins, the S protein undergoes a series of events including receptor recognition, proteolytic cleavage to shed the S1 subunit and conformational changes in S2 that ultimately lead to fusion of the viral and host membranes. It has been well established that human SARS-CoV utilizes ACE2 as a functional receptor. The receptor-binding motifs in the C-terminal domain of S1 are implicated in receptor recognition. Substitutions within the S1 receptor-binding domain (RBD) confers adaptability to new or orthologous entry receptors, thus altering the viral tropism (Hulswit et al., 2016).

However, significantly slower viral replication rate was observed, suggesting that deletions in RBDs were more critical in receptor recognition while the presence of ACE2-adapted critical residues modulated entry efficiency. In contrary to the WIV1 strain, neither neutralizing human monoclonal antibody nor existing double-inactivated whole SARS-CoV vaccine provided protective effect against infection caused by SHC014-harboring recombinant virus strain, indicating key difference in a.a. sequences determining antigenicity (Menachery et al., 2015).",

Surprisingly, SARSr-Ra-BatCoV LYRa11, a strain discovered in intermediate horseshoe bat in Baoshan, Yunnan (He et al., 2014), around 375 km from Kunming, sits closest to the civet/human SARSr-CoVs despite its lower overall nt identity. This is likely due to the presence of 7 nt in civet/human SARS-CoV that is found exclusively in SARSr-Ra-BatCoV LYRa11. Such a unique S gene in relation to civet/human SARS-CoV would therefore challenge the previous hypothesis that the origin of RBD was solely from Chinese horseshoe bats in Kunming. Nevertheless, the S proteins of the majority of bat SARSr-CoVs found in Chinese horseshoe bats in various part of China including Yunnan resemble the genotype of SARSr-Rs-BatCoV HKU3 but not the human ACE2-utilizing genotype of SARSr-Rs-BatCoV WIV1. This raises question on how SARSr-BatCoVs manage to have two distinct genotypes of S infecting the same host (Rs). There is a possibility that two cellular receptors for SARSr-CoVs are present in Chinese horseshoe bats.",

Detailed analysis of their genomes revealed several intriguing phenomena. Firstly, ORF1a and ORF1b in SARSr-Rf-BatCoV YNLF_31C isolated from greater horseshoe bats in Lufeng, Yunnan by our group has the highest nt identity to civet SARSr-CoV, especially at the regions nsp5, nsp10, nsp12 and nsp13 (Fig. 3A). This raised the possibility that Lufeng, Yunnan could be a potential gene pool for the progenitor of ORF1 of SARS-CoV. Secondly, as previously illustrated, for most regions along the genome of SARSr-CoV except ORF8, SARSr-Rs-BatCoVs from Chinese horseshoe bats are predominantly closer to civet SARSr-CoV. However, the ORF8 of SARSr-Rf-BatCoV has higher a.a. identity to civet SARSr-CoV ORF8. In addition, V90 and I113 are the two Rf-specific residues present in the ORF8 of SARSr-Rf-BatCoV Rf4092, which could evolutionarily bridge the ORF8 of SARSr-Rf-BatCoV to SARSr-Rs-BatCoV that had very high identity to civet/human SARS-CoV (Fig. 5\n). SARS-Rf-BatCoV was thus hypothesized to be the origin of human SARS-CoV ORF8 gene through recombination events.",

There are eleven such strains isolated from bats so far, with eight of them originating from Chinese horseshoe bats and three from greater horseshoe bats. Type II ORF8 has lower (70.8\u201382.8%) nt identity to ORF8 of civet SARSr-CoV.

Yet another strain, the SARSr-Rp-BatCoV F46 isolated from least horseshoe bats, processes an ORF8 with a phylogenetic position right between type I and type II ORF8s with 93.2% nt identity to civet SARSr-CoV, further complicating the analysis (Fig. 6\n). The rest of the ORF8 genes from sequenced SARSr-BatCoV strains belong to type III. These type III ORF8 genes possess 53.9\u201357.7% nt identity to the ORF8 of civet SARSr-CoV and have the greatest genetic distance observed over the whole genome of SARSr-CoV (Fig. 3B).

Replication assay in VeroFM cells demonstrated a phenotypic hierarchy that the infectious clone with full type I ORF8 exhibited significantly more efficient growth than other variants. The same hierarchy of viral replication was observed in human airway epithelial cell cultures and several \u201cnon-host\u201d cell lines transduced to express human ACE2, including R. alcyone lung epithelial cell line, cotton rat airway epithelial cell line, and goat and sheep lung cell lines. This study suggests that the 29 nt deletion actually conferred a loss of viral fitness during the initial phase of human-to-human transmission, contradicting the previous belief that the truncated products ORF8a and ORF8b favored adaptation to human (Muth et al., 2018).",

Moreover, the genetic diversity within the group of civet SARSr-CoV strains is minimal, further supporting that civets are only recently infected. Adaptation of SARSr-BatCoV to civet as intermediate amplification host is likely needed, which is further corroborated by the phylogenetic position of civet ACE2 in-between bat and human ACE2. Recently, direct bat-to-human transmission of SARSr-CoV was proposed by some groups in view of the fact that some SARSr-BatCoVs could utilize human ACE2 receptors in vitro and that seropositive sera against SARSr-BatCoVs were detected in Yunnan residents (Menachery et al., 2015; Wang et al., 2018), despite the fact that human/civet SARS-CoV has never been reported in Yunnan. Our findings provide substantial evidence against this hypothesis from a phyloepidemiologic point of view and demonstrated the significance of an intermediate host during the transmission cascade (Fig. 3).",

As mentioned above, SARSr-Rs-BatCoV Rs4084 was predicted to be able to utilize human ACE2 as functional receptor since its RBD region is genetically similar to RsSHC014. SARSr-Rs-BatCoV Rs4084 has not been studied either as whole virus or in the form of recombinant virus in terms of accessory protein function, tissue infectivity assay and replication kinetics; leaving a potential field for future investigations.

Our current model on the origin of SARS is that the human SARS-CoV that caused the epidemic in 2003 was probably a result of multiple recombination events from a number of SARS-CoV ancestors. Yunnan is the province in China with the largest diversity of horseshoe bat species. It is also the area shown to have a high variety of SARS-CoV ancestors.
