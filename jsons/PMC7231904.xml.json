The discovery\nof COVID-19 was linked to the Huanan seafood market in Wuhan, China. As of February 27,\n2020, there have been 82 294 confirmed cases globally with the first case in New\nZealand.1\nThis constitutes an import risk to neighboring Pacific Island countries including Samoa,\nwhich as on February 28, 2020, had no confirmed case of COVID-19.",

This is imperative considering the extent of spread and\nrapidity of virus transmission, especially among vulnerable populations. The rise of\nCOVID-19 brought back the horror of the last measles epidemic in Samoa and some Pacific\nIsland countries. The gradual decline in the measles epidemic trend was met with a\nsedulous approach toward case diagnoses, detection, and confirmation. It further\nstresses the importance of having well-equipped state-of-the-art diagnostic health\nfacilities, public health disease control centers, and highly trained infectious disease\npersonnel. This is a necessity for early disease detection and diagnosis to prevent the\noccurrence of an epidemic of COVID-19 in Samoa.",
