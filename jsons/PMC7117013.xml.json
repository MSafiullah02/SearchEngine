It however, does not share sequence similarity with other apolipoproteins, but instead is a member of the lipocalin superfamily of proteins which share a conserved tertiary structure and function in the transport of small hydrophobic ligands. The molecular structure of apoD consists of an eight-stranded \u03b2 barrel (\u03b2-clam) that forms a binding pocket suitable for a number of small hydrophobic molecules including arachidonic acid, cholesterol and progesterone [8], [15], [20], [21]. Apolipoprotein D is the major protein component in cyst fluid from women with human breast gross cystic disease [1]. Its expression has been shown to be increased in the brain in patients with Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease or schizophrenia [19], [26], [28], and animal models of Niemann\u2013Pick type C disease, transmissible spongiform encephalopathy, ischemic stroke and excitotoxic injury [5], [18], [22], [25].",

In a screen to identify genes that protect Drosophila against acute oxidative stress, a fly homolog of apoD, glial lazarillo (Glaz) was identified. Overexpression of Glaz resulted in increased resistance to hyperoxia as well as a 29% extension of lifespan under nomoxia [30]. In contrast, the absence of Glaz reduces the organism's resistance to oxidative stress and starvation and shortens male lifespan. Glaz mutants also have a higher concentration of lipid peroxidation products, pointing to a role of lipid peroxidation protection or scavenging as the mechanism of action of this lipocalin [23]. Furthermore, flies that express the human form of apoD are long lived and protected against stress conditions associated with aging and neurodegeneration, including hyperoxia, dietary paraquat and heat stress [16].",

Loss of mouse apoD function increases the sensitivity to oxidation stress and the levels of brain lipid peroxidation, and impairs locomotor and learning abilities [9]. In contrast, human apoD overexpression in the mouse brain produces opposite effects, increasing survival and preventing the rise of brain lipid peroxides after oxidant treatment [9]. ApoD has also been shown to provide resistance against coronavirus infections in mice [6]. Plants that overexpress apoD, likewise, show increased resistance to oxidative stress [4]. Cellular stresses that either cause extended growth arrest, such as hydrogen peroxide and UV light, or increase in proliferation, such as lipopolysaccharide treatment were found to increase apoD production in vitro. At the promoter level, NFkB, AP-1 and APRE-3 proved to be the elements implicated in the lipopolysaccharide response [7].",

The slices were then detached from the membranes and incubated with monoclonal antibody to microtubule-associated protein 2 (MAP2) (Sigma, 1:1000 dilution). The slices were washed in three changes of PBS and incubated for 1 h at room temperature in a 1:200 dilution of biotinylated horse anti-mouse IgG (Vector, Burlingame, USA).

The color reaction was stopped with several washes of Tris buffer, followed by PBS. The slices were mounted on gelatin-coated glass slides and counterstained with methyl green before coverslipping with Permount. The number of MAP2 positive neuronal cells in the CA fields of the hippocampal slices was counted in a \u201cblind\u201d manner on coded slides at 200\u00d7 magnification with the help of a grid. At least six slices were quantified for each treatment. The mean number of stained cells/mm2 was then calculated for each treatment, and the results were subjected to statistical analyses, using one-way ANOVA with Bonferroni's multiple comparison post-hoc test.

Essentially lipids were extracted from homogenates using organic solvent (CHCl3/methanol 2:1, v/v, +0.005% butylated hydroxytoluene (BHT) and dried under a stream of N2. After addition of heavy isotopic standards of F2-isoprostanes, and the cholesterol oxidation product 7-ketocholesterol, samples were reconstituted in 1 ml PBS and 1 ml KOH (1 M in methanol) and hydrolyzed overnight at 23 \u00b0C in the dark under an argon atmosphere. Solid phase extraction was carried out using 60 mg MAX (mixed ion exchange, Waters, Milford, USA) columns. After elution of F2-isoprostanes and 7-ketocholesterol, extracts were dried under N2 gas, derivatized and analyzed by an Agilent 5975 mass selective detector interfaced with an Agilent 5890II gas chromatograph. Selected-ion monitoring was performed to monitor ions selected from each compound's mass spectrum in order to optimize sensitivity and specificity. Quantification of F2-isoprostanes and 7-ketocholesterol was carried out by relating the total peak area of each analyte with their heavy isotopic internal standard. The results were subjected to statistical analyses, using one-way ANOVA with Bonferroni's multiple comparison post-hoc test. P\n < 0.05 was considered significant.",

This was shown by the light microscopic observation of decreased MAP2 immunostained pyramidal neurons in hippocampal CA fields. To investigate a possible neuroprotective effect of apoD, the kainate-injured hippocampal slices were treated with 1, 5, and 10 \u03bcg/ml of apoD. ApoD at a concentration of 10 \u03bcg/ml partially prevented loss of MAP2 immunostaining from hippocampal neurons from kainate injury (Fig. 1A and B). Furthermore, assessment of LDH from kainate-treated tissues with and without addition of apoD showed significant decrease in LDH release from apoD-treated tissues (Fig. 1C). No protective effect was observed after addition of BSA (Fig. 1B and C). Together, these findings indicate a neuroprotective effect of apoD after kainate induced excitotoxicity that might be related to its ability to prevent the formation of lipid oxidation products. The above results are consistent with recent reports that showed that loss of mouse apoD function increases the sensitivity to oxidation stress and the levels of brain lipid peroxidation. In contrast, human apoD overexpression in the mouse brain produces opposite effects increasing survival and preventing the raise of brain lipid peroxides after oxidant treatment [9]. ApoD has also been shown to provide resistance against coronavirus infections in mice [6].",

            "text": "What may be basis for the neuroprotective effect of apoD? Kainate treatment caused a significant increase in levels of the breakdown product of arachidonic acid peroxidation, F2-isoprostanes (Fig. 2A) and the cholesterol oxidation product, 7-ketocholesterol (Fig. 2B) indicating increased oxidative stress, but levels of these oxidation products were attenuated, in slices that were treated with 10 \u03bcg/ml apoD (Fig. 2A and B). No attenuation of increase in oxidation products after kainate treatment was observed in slices treated with 10 \u03bcg/ml BSA (Fig. 2A and B). These results extend previous findings which showed decreases in the precursor to arachidonic acid, linoleic acid (18:2n6c), arachidonic acid itself (20:4n6) and the elongation product of arachidonic acid, adrenic acid (22:4n6), but increases in LA, eicosadienoic acid and docosahexaenoic acid in apoD knock-out compared to wild-type mice [29]. In view of the molecular structure of apoD which consists of an eight-stranded \u03b2 barrel (\u03b2-clam) that forms a binding pocket form a number of small hydrophobic molecules, we propose that apoD is neuroprotective by binding to arachidonic acid and cholesterol thus preventing their oxidation to neurotoxic products such as 4-hydroxynonenal (4-HNE) [2] and 7-ketocholesterol [3], [10], [17]. The binding of apoD with arachidonic acid and cholesterol may also facilitate lipid transport mechanisms related to repair processes following KA-mediated toxicity. Further studies are necessary to elucidate factors that regulate the expression of apoD after neuronal injury.",
