Patients may have the fear of death, doctors and nurses those are involved in treating COVID-19 affected people may experience a fear of contagion by this virus and spreading to their family, friends, or close others (Xiang et al., 2020). Isolated and quarantined people experience stressful phenomenon, i.e. loses face to face communication and other regular social intervention instigating from an epidemic outbreak (Zhang et al., 2020). They may also experience felling of loneliness and anger (Xiang et al., 2020). These short term effects may develop adjustment disorder and post-traumatic stress disorder (Banerjee, 2020). Moreover, vaccine for curing COVID-19 affected people is not invented till now. People are not sure when this viral disease comes into full control. Unavailability of vaccine, unpredictability of the situation, and quarantine for indefinite periods create a stressful situation for Chinese people. Stressful situations can increase common mental health problems like anxiety, depression, etc (Dar et al., 2017). The overflow of information about COVID-19 epidemic on social media also triggers panic that may lead to extreme behavior like suicide (Goyal et al., 2020).",

Second, more than 50 % participants were from Wuhan province, the epicentre of COVID-19. This might question the representativeness of the study sample.
