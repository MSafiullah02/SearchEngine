            "text": "Streptococcal disease is common in both animals and man. Most streptococcal species are host specific with sporadic occurrence of disease, although outbreaks can occur where people or animals are housed in close confinement such as long-term care facilities and shelters for the homeless (Musher, 2003), barns (Radostits et al., 2000) and animal shelters (Pesavento et al., 2007). Streptococcus equi subspecies zooepidemicus (SEZ), a beta haemolytic, Lancefield group C streptococcal bacterium, is reported to be a mucosal commensal with a wide host range (Gyles et al., 2004). This organism is most commonly isolated from horses and in this species may be associated with pneumonia, pleuropneumonia, endometritis, arthritis, neonatal septicaemia, abortion, mastitis (Radostits et al., 2000) and meningoencephalitis (Pusterla et al., 2007).",

This is evidenced by the increasing frequency of reported outbreaks of streptococcal disease in sheltered dogs reviewed above. The clinical presentation of the cats reported here is similar to two outbreaks of rhinitis, sinusitis and meningitis in shelter cats reported by Pesavento et al. (2007) from which Streptococcus canis was recovered. S. canis is a commensal of the cat found on both the skin and mucosal surfaces and is most commonly associated with bacteraemia in kittens (Greene, 2006). In the dog, S. canis is the most common streptococcal respiratory commensal (Chalker et al., 2003) and the most common streptococcal bacterium recovered from respiratory disease (Biberstein et al., 1980, Angus et al., 1997). These observations suggest that, similar to SEZ in horses, S. canis is a commensal that acts as an opportunistic pathogen in dogs and cats and, as such, sporadic disease and occasional outbreaks would be anticipated.",

            "text": "In contrast to S. canis, SEZ is not an established respiratory commensal of cats or dogs. Studies of canine and feline mucosal microflora failed to isolate SEZ from tonsillar, oral or nasal cultures of dogs (Bailie et al., 1978, Devriese et al., 1992) or from tonsillar cultures of cats (Devriese et al., 1992). Furthermore, SEZ is rarely isolated from dogs dying from respiratory disease, other than the severe haemorrhagic pneumonia described in shelter outbreaks (Biberstein et al., 1980, Angus et al., 1997, Chalker et al., 2003, Pesavento et al., 2008) and was not isolated from cats with chronic rhinitis or sinusitis (Johnson et al., 2005, Demko and Cohn, 2007). Thus residence in shelters, research laboratories and other facilities where close confinement of animals occurs appears to be the major risk factor for development of SEZ associated disease (Chalker et al., 2003, Pesavento et al., 2008). Why close confinement may predispose to SEZ disease is unclear. Coinfection with other respiratory pathogens and age and health of the animal on entry to the facility was unrelated to later colonization of the respiratory tract by SEZ in dogs (Garnett et al., 1982, Chalker et al., 2003, Pesavento et al., 2008). The rapid onset of severe SEZ pneumonia in shelter dogs suggests the introduction of either a high challenge or a virulent clone into an environment densely populated with susceptible hosts (Pesavento et al., 2008).",

In the two outbreaks of S. canis meningitis in shelter cats, osteolysis of the nasal bones and the cribriform plate was demonstrated, suggesting that meningitis likely occurred secondary to an olfactory route of bacterial spread from the sinuses and nasal passages through the cribriform plate (Pesavento et al., 2007).
