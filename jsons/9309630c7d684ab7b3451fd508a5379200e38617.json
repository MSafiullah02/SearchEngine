Using instruments based on the combinations of wind direction, air pollution in the PRDEZ, and distance between the PRDEZ and different districts of HK, we show that air pollution causes more people to die from cardio-respiratory diseases. Specifically, we estimate that a 10-unit increase in the Air Pollution Index (API) can cause a 1.77% increase in monthly cardio-respiratory mortality. 2 The elderly are particularly vulnerable to air pollution, with a 10-unit change in the API leading to an 8.41% change in mortality. To understand how the air pollution effect changes over time, we split the sample by different sub-periods and find that the effect has been diminishing in the past two decades.

First, this study is among the first efforts to estimate the causal health effects of air pollution in a high-income and high-pollution context. Existing literature mostly focuses on developed countries with a low level of pollution, such as the U.S. and the E.U., or developing countries with a high level of pollution, such as China and India. The high-income high-pollution setting is important because the air pollution effect can be non-linear and the pollution-mortality relationship may be altered by better institutional, and socio-economic background (Arceo et al., 2016; Burnett et al., 2014) . Within the small set of studies that focus on HK, most of them are associational studies that may suffer from endogeneity concerns (e.g., Ko et al., 2007; Qiu et al., 2012; Wong et al., 2001; Wong et al., 2002) . The only exception is Colmer et al. (2019), a concurrent study that also emphasizes the importance of investigating Hong Kong. Colmer et al.

We differ from Colmer et al.

We use monthly data to avoid estimating the very short-term health effect (i.e., the effect of daily air pollution on mortality) for two reasons. First, many epidemiological studies have investigated the dynamic impacts of air pollution on health outcomes and a general finding is that air pollution can lead to worse health outcomes at a more aggregated level (e.g., Zeger et al., 1999; Schwartz, 2000; Zanobetti et al., 2000; Zanobetti et al., 2002; Costa et al., 2017; Zanobetti and Schwartz, 2008; Deryugina et al., 2019) . The reason is that people will develop more complex cardio-respiratory diseases with prolonged exposure to air pollution and the affected population will increase over time. Monthly data therefore allows us to capture the air pollution effect in the medium run. Second, our instruments are based on transboundary air pollution from one region to another and it takes time for the transmission to take place. If we use daily data, current-day pollution in PRDEZ may not be able to strongly affect current-day air quality in HK, especially when weather conditions are relatively stable.

The impact at the weekly level is 0.10%, twice larger than the daily estimate (Column 2). At the monthly and quarterly level, we obtain similar coefficients (0.177 and 0.164). From daily to quarterly level analysis, we can observe an increasing trend in the estimated coefficient and the effect size stabilizes when we use monthly data. These results are consistent with the previous literature that using daily data tends to generate smaller estimates than using more aggregated data. In addition, results in Table 6 also indicate that the health impact of air pollution became larger as we use more aggregated data, suggesting harvesting effects is not going to be an important issue when assessing the air pollution effect in the medium and long run. In Appendix Table S9 , we report the OLS estimates and fixed-effects model estimates. Based on these models, we draw the following conclusions. First, the estimated effects vary greatly across different specifications. For example, if nothing is controlled for, a 10-unit increase in API is associated with a 0.92% change in the CVR mortality rate and the estimate is statistically significant at the 1% level. Adding controls and fixed effects significantly change the point estimates and the significance level. These findings suggest that associational estimates can suffer from severe omitted variable bias. Second, in the most restrictive model (i.e., Column 6), a 10-unit increase in API is associated with a 0.67% change in CVR mortality rate. This estimate is substantially smaller than the IV estimate (1.77%) in Table 2 , suggesting the potential attenuation bias in the fixed-effects models. These findings are consistent with several quasi-experimental studies (e.g., Schlenker and Walker, 2015; He et al., 2016; Deryugina et al., 2019) , which also find that estimates of the air pollution effects obtained using a quasiexperimental design were much larger than estimates obtained from associational approaches.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 1977, "end": 2004, "text": "Schlenker and Walker, 2015;", "ref_id": "BIBREF49"}, {"start": 2005, "end": 2021, "text": "He et al., 2016;", "ref_id": "BIBREF29"}, {"start": 2022, "end": 2045, "text": "Deryugina et al., 2019)", "ref_id": "BIBREF18"}], "ref_spans": [{"start": 100, "end": 107, "text": "Table 6", "ref_id": "TABREF7"}, {"start": 753, "end": 760, "text": "Table 6", "ref_id": "TABREF7"}, {"start": 1009, "end": 1017, "text": "Table S9", "ref_id": "TABREF13"}, {"start": 1819, "end": 1826, "text": "Table 2", "ref_id": "TABREF1"}], "section": "Robustness checks"}, {"text": "Finally, many environmental epidemiology papers use non-accidental deaths as the outcome measure.

The baseline estimates are plotted on the left for comparison. The corresponding regression results are reported in Table 7 . In Panel A, we focus on CVR mortality. We see that the effect is the largest using 2000e2002 data: a 10-unit increase in API will lead to a 3.13% increase in the CVR mortality rate (Column 1). Using data from more recent years, we find the air pollution effect on CVR mortality rate becomes smaller and statistically insignificant (Columns 2 to 4). In other words, the air pollution effect on mortality in HK is diminishing over the years. For non-CVR mortality, all the coefficients are small in magnitude and statistically insignificant (Panel B). 13 We choose the Year 2003 as the point to split the sample because many factors that affect population health in HK, especially the healthcare infrastructure, were drastically changed after the 2003 SARS epidemic.

Particularly, it unveiled some basic failings of HK's healthcare system, including overcrowded wards, poor ventilation in some hospitals, lack of isolation facilities, inadequate intensive care facilities, and difficulty in isolating and cohorting patients with suspected SARS infection (Hung, 2003) . Following the SARS, numerous healthcare improvements were carried out. For example, after reviewing the medical practices at the time, the Hospital Authority (HA) of HK built additional isolation beds, revamped the Intensive Care Units (ICU), rationalized existing beds, adopted a series of infection control practices, and launched massive staff training programs. The HA also worked closely with the HK Government to construct longer-term isolation facilities and set over 200 improvement targets at the beginning of 2004.

Below, we offer additional supporting evidence for this argument and try to rule out several alternative explanations.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Air pollution effects over time"}, {"text": "A large number of medical studies have shown that air pollution often triggers acute cardiovascular diseases, such as strokes and heart attacks (see Mustafi c et al., 2012; Shah et al., 2013; Cohen et al., 2017 for recent reviews). Air pollution also damages the immune system and increases the risk of various respiratory diseases, such as acute upper respiratory tract infections. When one's life is threatened by such acute diseases, immediate access to emergency care is critical. For example, if a patient is struck by acute ischemic stroke, the treatment modality is highly time-dependent and better outcomes can only be achieved when treatment is administered soon enough. Treatment within 60 min of symptom onset, known as the Golden Hour, can produce desirable health outcomes with significantly lower rates of morbidity and mortality (Ebinger et al., 2015) . As a result, we conjecture that access to immediate emergency care and the quality of healthcare service may have important implications for the air pollution effect. Hong Kong has stunningly efficient emergency services, in which the ambulance service is almost free and pledged to arrive at the patient's address within 12 min upon request. In 2014, for example, the total number of ambulance transportations was more than 20,000, with 95% of them arriving in less than 12 min. 15 Whether a patient can receive immediate healthcare thus largely depends on the distance between the patient's address and the nearby hospital. In light of this, we explore the heterogeneity of the air pollution effect based on whether an LTPUG has immediate access to a hospital with an Accident and Emergency (A&E) service. In HK, 20 hospitals provide A&E services and the locations of these hospitals did not change during our sample period. We generate 2-km buffer zones surrounding all the hospitals with A&E services and compare the air pollution effects for LTPUGs that are located within and outside those buffer zones. We use the 2-km buffer zone because it roughly divides all the LTPUGs into two groups with equal sample sizes (Appendix Fig. S5 ). 16 Table 8 summarizes our findings separately for these two groups. Columns 1 and 2 report the results for districts located within the 2 km radius of A&E services and Columns 3 and 4 report the results for districts located outside the radius. The estimates are statistically insignificant for both CVR and non-CVR mortality rates in Columns 1 and 2, suggesting that air pollution is less likely to kill people in districts with A&E services. In contrast, air pollution has a statistically significant impact on CVR mortality for people living far away from hospitals with A&E services. These results suggest that easy access to emergency medical services can reduce pollution-related deaths, which are consistent with our argument that the availability of high-quality medical service is important for mitigating the air pollution effect. In addition, we check the robustness by varying the buffer zones of A&E services to 1.5 km and 3 km and report the results in Appendix Table S11 .

As shown in Appendix Fig. S7 , the API in HK was between 40 and 50 during most of the time and there were no dramatic improvements or deteriorations in air quality in Hong Kong during the sample period. Particularly, the API between 2000 and 2002, during which we find the largest air pollution effect, was not very different from the later periods (e.g. 2004 to 2007) . This result suggests that the diminishing air pollution effect is not driven by changes in air pollution levels. Second, existing literature also suggests that smokers can be more sensitive to air pollution, in that they have a higher relative risk of all-cause mortality, cardiopulmonary mortality, and lung cancer (Hoek et al., 2002; Pope III et al., 2002; Hamra et al., 2015) . This argument is often used to explain the finding that males are more likely to die from air pollution than females. If this argument were true and if there were fewer and fewer smokers over the years, the air pollution effect could decrease. To examine this hypothesis, we collect data from the HK Government and compare the smoking population over time. We find that, somewhat to our surprise, the percentage of smokers has remained almost unchanged during the entire period (see data in Appendix Table S13 and Appendix Fig. S8 ).
