The Pediatric Unit at Fondazione IRCCS Istituto Nazionale Tumori (Milan) is one of the largest departments for children and adolescents with solid tumors in Europe, with >200 new cases yearly. We have consequently had the opportunity to manage a significant number of children and adolescents with solid tumors during this emergency.",

            "text": "At the time of writing (Table 1) It is worth noting that, following the Lombardy Health Authorities' guidelines, asymptomatic patients and health professionals were not routinely tested for SARS-CoV-2 at our hospital. To date, we have had no clinically evident SARS-CoV-2 infections among our children with cancer. While recognizing the low rate of viral testing as a possible bias, it is also true that-given the acknowledged low test rates-we might have expected a wider spread of the virus from asymptomatic caregivers to patients. 7 A substantial proportion of children with cancer are potentially curable. In this SARS-CoV-2 outbreak, a major risk for children and adolescents with cancer lies in the associated strain on the medical services. We wish to highlight the importance of a shared vision for providing cancer care to patients in the face of the uncertainty and rapid change prompted by these exceptional circumstances. Any emerging information is crucial to help us characterize the potential impact of SARS-CoV-2 in specific patient settings, 8 orient the implementation of contingency plans, and avoid measures that may be unduly restrictive of normal healthcare activities.",
