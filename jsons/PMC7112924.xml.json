In comparison with convalescent SARS patients, the Ab levels and neutralization activity of immunized mice were about 10 times higher. The curve of IgG Ab in mice indicates that the specific Abs remained at a high level for a long period. These results confirmed the feasibility and efficacy of SARS inactivated vaccine. We also performed the similar experiments using other species such as rats, rabbits, horses and monkeys which also confirmed the effect of this vaccine (Wang et al., in preparation).",

Recent studies reported that the DNA vaccines targeting protein S or N could induce several events including the production of specific Abs and/or the activation of cytotoxic T lymphocytes, and protective immunity in mice [11], [12], [13]. A highly attenuated modified vaccinia virus Ankara containing the gene encoding full-length SARS-CoV S was also proved to be able to induce protective immunity in mice [14]. Here, we showed for the first time that the Abs specific to proteins N, S4 and S2 are stronger than other structure-protein specific Abs induced by inactivated vaccine. Sui et al. [15] recently reported a potent neutralization McAb, the epitope of which was located within the N-terminal 261\u2013672 amino acids of protein S. In accordance with their observations, we found that the level of S2-specific Ab predominated in mice sera. From these results and other antigenicity analysis of SARS-CoV structure protein, we propose that protein S and/or N may be a potential subunit for an effective vaccine.",

Escaping mutations in response to immune system have been observed and selected point mutations are known to be responsible for major shifts in the pathogenicity, as well as in the tissue specificity of bovine coronavirus [16]. Mutations in the genome of SARS-CoV have recently been described [17]. These mutations may hamper the development of effective vaccine against SARS-CoV; however, during the neutralization test of antisera induced by SARS inactivated vaccine, we found that the antisera could neutralize not only the CPE of SARS-CoV strain F69, but also strain Y3, another SARS-CoV isolated from a female patient who belonged to a \u201csuper-spread\u201d event in Guangdong Province [18]. We did not find any significant difference between two strains in terms of the neutralization titer (data not shown).
