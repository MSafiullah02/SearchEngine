The disease is prevalent in nearly all countries with an intensive poultry industry, causing respiratory and renal diseases in chickens of all ages. It also reduces the quality and quantity of eggs produced by mature hens, causing heavy economic losses to the poultry industry. In addition, high mortality often occurs in young chickens infected with nephropathogenic strains as a result of renal pathology (Cavanagh and Gelb, 2008).",

The N phosphoprotein is conserved among different IBV serotypes and can induce high titers of cross-reactive antibodies and cell-mediated immunity that protects chickens from acute infection, thus it is used as a target protein in designing vaccines against IB (Williams et al., 1992, Collisson et al., 2000, Seo et al., 1997). The S glycoprotein is responsible for receptor binding and membrane fusion (Hofmann et al., 2004), and consists of the N-terminal S1 and C-terminal S2 subunits (Bosch et al., 2003). Most of the conformation-dependent, neutralizing antigenic, and serotype-specific determinants in IBV have been mapped to S1, while other immunodominant regions are located in the N-terminal regions of S2 (Koch et al., 1990, Kusters et al., 1989, Lenstra et al., 1989). In addition, interactions between the S1 and S2 subunits might affect the conformation of the S1 subunit, thereby accounting for differences in serologic protection (Callison et al., 1999). The M glycoprotein of coronaviruses gives the virion envelope its shape. It has been reported that the S glycoprotein interacts with the transmembrane region of the M glycoprotein and the cytoplasmic tail of the IBV E protein is responsible for its interaction with the IBV M glycoprotein (Cavanagh, 2007).",

Multiple live attenuated IBV vaccines are most often required because of poor cross protection between vaccines produced from different IBV serotypes (Liu et al., 2009, Liu et al., 2014). Live attenuated IBV vaccines do not provide adequate protection throughout the lifetime of layers or breeders, whereas inactivated vaccines convey certain advantages, such as slow antigen release and long-lasting immunity throughout the laying period. Unfortunately, inactivated IBV vaccines are not effective when used alone, as birds require one or a series of vaccinations with live-attenuated IBV vaccines (live priming) prior to administration of an inactivated vaccine (Cook et al., 2012). Conventional live IBV vaccines are attenuated by multiple serial passages in embryonated eggs (Gelb and Cloud, 1983, Jackwood et al., 2003, Bijlenga et al., 2004, Huang and Wang, 2006), although this is a time-consuming process.",

At week 3 post-vaccination, the antibody levels in the rDEV-S and rDEV-S1 groups decreased sharply, whereas the covalent-vaccination groups had higher antibody levels. Single rDEV-N and single rDEV-S1 vaccination invoked weak antibody responses, while covalent vaccination with these two rDEVs induced strong antibody responses. The high antibody titers were related to the lower mortality in the rDEV-N & rDEV-S1 covalent-vaccination group, indicating that covalent vaccination with the IBV structural proteins N and S1 provided better protection against challenge with virulent IBV strains. The IBV S glycoprotein consists of the S1 and S2 subunits. The S1 subunit induces efficient cellular immunity (Zhang et al., 2014), while the N protein mainly induces cross-reactive antibodies (Ignjatovic and Galli, 1993), which may be one of the reasons for the difference in antibody levels among the rDEV-N, rDEV-S and rDEV-S1 groups. To evaluate the cellular immune responses induced by the rDEVs, we detected the percentages of CD4+ CD3+ and CD8+CD3+ T-lymphocytes in peripheral blood samples collected from vaccinated chickens on post-vaccination days 3, 7, 14, and 21. The results showed that CD8+ T-lymphocytes increased and the causative ratio of CD4+/CD8+ T-lymphocytes decreased at day 7 post-vaccination in each vaccinated group, suggesting the induction of cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs). Reportedly, CD4+ T-lymphocytes induce and enhance the immune response by secreting cytokines, while most CTLs were shown to be CD8+ cells, which play a major role in the control of viral infection. Collisson et al. (2000) reported that IBV-specific CTL activity was dependent on the S and N proteins of IBV, which was consistent with the results of the present study. Moreover, chickens infected with IBV Gray strain showed CTL responses as early as 3 days and peaked at 10 days postinfection (Collisson et al., 2000), consistent with our results on the detection of CD8+ T-lymphocytes. In this study, the antibody responses and increases in CD8+ T-lymphocytes levels were detected as early as 7 days post-vaccination, suggesting efficacious delivery of the foreign protein as a vaccine vector to the host, which elicited both humoral and cellular immune responses.",

In addition, a lower percentage of birds vaccinated with rDEV-S showed clinical signs after challenge when compared with birds vaccinated with the other two viruses, demonstrating that better protection was conferred by vaccination with rDEV-S. Furthermore, although covalent vaccination with rDEV-N & rDEV-S or rDEV-N & rDEV-S1 provided the same clinical protection (20% clinical signs) as chickens in the rDEV-S group, vaccination with the covalent vaccines offered better protection in regard to viral shedding of virulent IBV. We did not test a live IBV vaccine in the present study because no commercial LX4-type (QX-like) vaccine is currently available. In our previous study, we found that the H120 commercial vaccine did not provide efficacious protection against the ck/CH/LDL/091022 strain of IBV, resulting in a morbidity rate of 40% (Sun et al., 2011), which was higher than that observed in chickens vaccinated with rDEV-S (20%), rDEV-N (30%), DEV-N & rDEV-S (20%), or rDEV-N & rDEV-S1 (20%). The mortality induced by IBV ck/CH/LDL/091022 infection in the control group in this study was higher than that reported by Sun et al.

Sera from chickens immunized with rDEV-N, rDEV-S, rDEV-S1, rDEV-N + rDEV-S, rDEV-N + rDEV-S1, or the control were tested for the presence of antibodies against IBV at 1 week (n = 25), 2 weeks (n = 25), 3 weeks (n = 25), 4 weeks (n = 15), and 5 weeks (n = 15) post-vaccination. There were very significant differences in the antibody titers of the vaccinated groups as compared to that of the control group (p < 0.01). All single vaccinated groups were compared to the corresponding covalent vaccinated group. Significant differences in antibody titers are indicated with dashes.",
