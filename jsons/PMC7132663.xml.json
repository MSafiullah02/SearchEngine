Each experiment was performed in duplicate. Each carrier was placed in a 24-well plate, and 20 \u03bcL of virus suspension was applied. The virus was allowed to dry for 2 hours. After drying, 50 \u03bcL of use-dilution germicide was placed on the dried virus suspension on 3 test carriers, and 50 \u03bcL of cell culture medium was placed on 3 control carriers. After 1-minute contact time, 950 \u03bcL of neutralizing solution was added to the 3 test carriers to halt virucidal activity, and 950 \u03bcL of cell culture medium was added to the control carriers. To elute viruses from carriers, 150 \u03bcL of 15% beef extract (pH 7.5) was then added to all 6 carriers. Carriers were agitated on a shaking platform (60 rpm) for 20 minutes. The liquid from each well was then recovered, diluted, and assayed for virus infectivity as previously described. To determine the reduction in virus infectivity, the concentration of virus per 20-\u03bcL sample volume was calculated. Reduction in viral titer was calculated using difference in virus concentration between test carriers and control carriers. Log10 reductions were calculated for each germicide based on 6 independent exposure trials.",

The efficacy of 6 hospital surface germicides was tested against 2 coronaviruses, MHV and TGEV, used as surrogates for SARS-CoV. These findings expand the available data on disinfection beyond what has been previously studied using other surrogates such as human coronavirus 229E. Although 229E shares some tissue tropism with SARS, there are important differences. Studies of SARS patients and outbreaks demonstrated that SARS-CoV is also a fecally shed virus, with intestinal tissue tropism; 229E lacks this. This may indicate important differences in resistance to environmental stressors because fecally shed viruses must be able to survive the conditions in the gastrointestinal tract, including extremes of pH, abundance of other microbes, and bile salts. This gastrointestinal tropism has played an important role in at least 1 major outbreak; this suggests that surrogates such as MHV (a virus with multiple tropisms) and TGEV (an enteric virus) that reflect this diversity in tissue tropism are necessary.",

For MHV, the 3 ethanol-based germicides (71%, 70%, and 62% ethanol) gave the greatest reduction in infectivity, with log10 reduction factors ranging from 1.5 to 4.9. This was greater than the reductions observed with hypochlorite, phenolic, and orthophthalaldehyde based germicides. These same performance trends are evident in tests of these germicides against TGEV. The ethanol-based germicides gave log10 infectivity reduction factors ranging from 2.9 to 4.6, greater than those observed for hypochlorite, phenolic, and orthophthalaldehyde germicides. The phenolic and orthophthalaldehyde germicides had greater virucidal activity against TGEV than against MHV. However, only the reductions in infectivity by orthophthalaldehyde were significantly different between MHV and TGEV. Statistical analysis indicates that mean log10 viral reductions differed significantly based on both the type of germicide and the type of virus tested and that there are interaction effects between germicide and virus type. Hence, both the selection of germicide and the type of virus will influence the resultant magnitude of reduction of virus infectivity titer.",

This study shows that the actual reduction is slightly greater than 3-log10 (3.9 for TGEV and 3.19 for MHV).

Studies of hospital germicide efficacy against adenovirus 8 using the same carrier-based method with 1-minute contact times found greater log10 reduction factors by OPA (4.37) than were observed in this study for TGEV (2.27) and MHV (1.71). In contrast, Vesphene IIse reduced adenovirus 8 by a log10 reduction factor of only 0.41, compared with 1.33 for MHV and 2.03 for TGEV in this study. Reduction of adenovirus 8 by 70% ethanol was similar to that observed for coronavirus in this study, but 0.12% hypochlorite reduced adenovirus 8 approximately 4-log10 greater than reductions observed for coronaviruses with 0.06% hypochlorite.5 This suggests that disinfection efficacy may differ greatly by virus type and that nonenveloped viruses may not be appropriate surrogates for predicting the effects of disinfectants on enveloped viruses such as coronavirus and influenza.",

Previous studies of coronavirus disinfection have found higher reductions with concentrations of hypochlorite greater than the recommended use-dilution, suggesting these results are consistent with a concentration-dependent effect. Sattar et al26 reported 99.9% reduction of viral titer for human coronavirus 229E when 0.10% and 0.50% sodium hypochlorite solutions were tested with 1-minute contact times. Commercial marketers of sodium hypochlorite recommend contact time of 5 minutes. In actual use, it is likely that contact times are shorter than this, and increases in concentration may be necessary to offset the use of shorter contact times. The results of this study suggest that the 1:100 use-dilution should not be recommended for use on surfaces with suspected contamination by coronaviruses. Hypochlorite is an important environmental surface disinfectant in health care; without the flammability and rapid evaporation of ethanol, it is suitable for large surface area spills. Increases in both sodium hypochlorite concentration and contact time should be evaluated to determine whether these factors would improve virucidal activity of hypochlorite on hard surfaces to achieve a >3-log10 reduction performance target.",

A concentration of 600 mg/L on a surface produced a log10 reduction factor <1 of MHV and TGEV in this study. The poor performance of hypochlorite against viruses dried into surfaces may be due to the high oxidant demand exerted by the proteinaceous cell culture medium matrix in which the viruses were suspended. This results in consumption of available hypochlorite by the proteins and other organic compounds (eg, amino acids) present in the matrix, rendering it unavailable for disinfection. Use of viruses suspended in a proteinaceous matrix simulates the real world conditions under which viruses shed by human hosts occur in health care environments. Viruses are not shed by an infected host as single purified particles; they occur as aggregates, surrounded by membranes and embedded in feces, mucus, and other proteinaceous matrices. Together, these results suggest that changing the recommended use-dilution of hypochlorite may address the problem of oxidant demand exerted by proteinaceous material such as body fluids and result in effective inactivation of coronaviruses shed from human hosts.",

These results suggest that sufficient contact time is crucial to ensure that inactivation of viruses on the surfaces of semicritical equipment items takes place. According to the manufacturer, the phenolic disinfectant tested demonstrated a 3- to 4-log10 reduction in viral titer after 10 minutes contact time when tested against another surrogate coronavirus, avian infectious bronchitis virus. The results from this study, using 1-minute contact time, suggest that virucidal efficacy is greatly compromised if germicides are not used according to label directions and contact time is shorter than manufacturer recommended contact times.",

There is still an important role to be played by surrogate viruses, especially for the evaluation of new disinfectants or the re-evaluation of use of current disinfectants (such as changes in dose and contact time); the available data suggest that both TGEV and MHV may serve as conservative surrogates for modeling control of SARS-CoV by health care germicides in worst case scenarios.",
