However, previous studies suggested that SARS-CoV-2 is transmitted within family and hospital-associated populations [3, 11, 12] , indicating that this virus spreads mainly through close contact and infected respiratory droplets rather than through aerosols. In our study, the RNA of SARS-CoV-2 was not detected in any of the 44 air samples, indicating that the possibility of SARS-CoV-2 transmission by aerosols is yet to be confirmed. An air sampler that could force larger volumes of air should be required to detect low concentrations of the virus in the clinical environment in further studies [13] . Conversely, in the designated hospitals for COVID-19, strict measures for air purification had been taken. The most important measure was to open windows to promote ventilation. If mobility could increase air exchange and reduce the virus concentration, then the probability of infection is greatly reduced [14, 15] . Previous studies have shown that ultraviolet light could kill the coronavirus effectively [16] . For rooms with poor ventilation in the designated hospital, an ultraviolet air disinfection machine with 24-h ultraviolet disinfection filtration was devoted to sterilize the air.",

Thirty-six (24.83%) of the 145 samples collected in medical areas and two (3.64%) of the 55 collected in living quarters were positive for the virus. The positive rate in medical areas was significantly higher than that in living quarters (P=0.001). The positive rates were 25.00% and 37.50% for the general isolation ward and ICU, respectively, and no significant difference was observed between these regions (P=0.238). Two positive samples were detected in the office area, one was detected on the surface of a keyboard, and another was on the surface of a telephone.The positive rates of samples from environmental surfaces of specific sites in medical areas are presented inTable 3. In medical areas, the PCR-positive samples were obtained from the surface of keyboards, computer mice, beepers, bedside tables, bedrails, and medical equipment including ventilators and monitors. In living quarters, the PCR-positive samples were obtained from the surface of telephones and desktop.Samples taken from the surface of beepers (50.00%), water machine buttons (50.00%), elevator buttons (42.86%), computer mouses (40.00%), telephones (40.00%), and keyboards (33.33%) were positive for SARS-CoV-2 RNA.",

The positive rate in medical areas was higher than that in the living quarters, demonstrating the efficacy of the nosocomial infection prevention and control strategies. The wards were divided into different areas according to the risk level of infection, separating patients and healthcare workers using a physical barrier. Targeted measures for nosocomial infection prevention and control were carried out. Individuals in the designated hospital were required to adhere to the regulations imposed in different areas, and crossing of those different areas was strictly prohibited. The results showed that application of physical barriers combined with behavioral management can effectively prevent the spread of SARS-CoV-2 in the designated hospital. Two positive samples taken from the living quarters indicated the importance of more careful and thorough environmental cleaning and disinfection in this area. The positive rates in areas such as general isolation ward 1, general isolation ward 3, general isolation ward 6, ICU, emergency room, and fever clinic in public area were, on average, higher. In our study, SARS-CoV-2 RNA was detected from the environmental surfaces frequently touched by patients and healthcare workers. The top five sites with a positive infection rate were beepers, water machine buttons, elevator buttons, computer mouses, telephones, and keyboards. Special emphasis should be placed on the cleaning and disinfection of the crucial parts of key departments, and intensive disinfection should be instituted and done by professional nurses.Water machine buttons and elevator buttons that are frequently used by healthcare workers or patients are some of the neglected sites in the hospital, often not cleaned or disinfected. These sites can potentially become contaminated with the virus.",

There were some limitations in the process of environmental disinfection in the designated hospital. First, environmental surface disinfection was implemented by spraying a chlorine-containing disinfectant. However, spraying cannot cover the surface evenly, such as the corners, and the effect of disinfection cannot be guaranteed without the wiping process. Moreover, spraying disinfectants may lead to harms to patients and health-care workers, thus spraying disinfection should not be recommended. Second, the cleaning work in the designated hospital was mostly done by volunteer cleaners during this special period. They received the necessary training without professional experience. Third, all samples were collected under emergency conditions around 8:00 am before routine cleaning and disinfection.",
