            "text": "Infectious bronchitis (IB), which is caused by infectious bronchitis virus (IBV; Avian coronavirus), is one of the most important diseases of poultry, causing severe economic losses worldwide. 8 Clinical signs of disease are diverse and include respiratory distress, severe ocular discharge, poor body weight gain, decreased egg production, flushing (renal disease), and occasionally mortality in chickens. 7 IB is often complicated by secondary bacterial (e.g., Escherichia coli, Mycoplasma sp.) and viral infections (e.g., influenza A virus, Newcastle disease virus, infectious laryngotracheitis virus). 43 Lack of cross-protection among IBV serotypes is a challenge to controlling IB 15 ; therefore, control of IB relies heavily on serotype-specific live attenuated vaccines. 8 Collectively, the presence of multiple IBVs in a single sample, emergence of variant IBVs, and high genetic diversity of IBV can complicate the diagnosis of IB and illustrate the need for enhanced testing. 15 IBV is an enveloped, pleomorphic gammacoronavirus with an unsegmented, single-stranded, positive-sense, 26-27.8-kb, RNA genome that encodes the nonstructural polyproteins, 1a and 1b, and several structural proteins: spike (S), envelope (E), membrane (M), and nucleocapsid (N). 38, 41 In addition, 2 accessory genes, expressing 3a, 3b and 5a, 5b, respectively, have also been described. 6, 14, 38 The S protein is highly glycosylated, and post-translational cleavage leads to 2 subunits: S1 and S2. 10, 48 Besides acting as the viral attachment protein, the S1 protein is a major target of neutralizing antibodies. 7 As with many attachment proteins that are targets of virusneutralizing antibodies, the S1 subunit is highly diverse with almost 50% of the amino acids differing among IBV serotypes. 2, 21, 38 Such variation leads to important biological differences between IBV serotypes and the emergence of novel variants. More than 60 serotypes of IBV have been reported, but the most common serotypes of IBV in North America are Arkansas, Connecticut (Conn), Delaware 072, Georgia 08 (GA08), Georgia 98 (GA98), and Massachusetts (Mass). 16 This genetic diversity leads to the emergence of new serotypes and a lack of complete cross-serotype protection by vaccines. 29 The correlation of IBV genotypes and serotypes of IBV has been reported 45 ; therefore, accurate genotypic identification of IBV is an important step to identify IBV in clinical respiratory cases, ensure selection of proper IBV vaccines for use in vaccination programs, and to better understand the epidemiology of this global virus.",

Additionally, given that the target is short, the primers lie within the variable regions of the S1 gene and may require a different assay for each genotype. In contrast to the genotype-specific primers, the pan-IBV S1 primers 1, 17, 22, 23, 25, 33 only require one reaction to determine the presence of IBV; however, they have a relatively low sensitivity and are typically used only on egg-cultured virus, which adds an additional, time-consuming step, and many diagnostic laboratories do not have specific pathogen-free embryos readily available. Additionally, genotyping the pan-IBV results requires cloning of PCR products to detect multiple IBV subpopulations in the sample, 30 which is inefficient when potentially dealing with multiple (3 or 4) IBV types (i.e., \"type\" denoting genotype, lineage, and/or sublineage classification of an IBV). As such, the development of a pan-IBV sequencing method to rapidly determine the genotype(s) in samples would aid in lineage typing and tracking of IBV circulating in poultry flocks.",

A second database was constructed with all of the avian coronavirus S1 sequences (n = 7,328) available in NCBI (as of 2017.09.08) and the chicken genome (hereafter, All-IBV database). Prior to database construction, all sequences were dustmasked (NCBI C++ ToolKit, https:// ncbi.github.io/cxx-toolkit/), and each IBV sequence was assigned a unique taxonomy ID as a species hierarchically under the genus Gammacoronavirus to allow easy sorting. The local BLAST (https://blast.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/) databases were compiled using default settings. The IBV-lineage-typing database was used to assign IBV lineages to each read, as appropriate. The All-IBV database was used to assign a taxonomic ID to each of the IBV reads from within IBV lineage read clusters. The IBV-lineage-typing database, which contains only one sequence per lineage, is required because Centrifuge (computational tool for taxonomic classification of individual reads) divides the score for any given read by the number of hits that have an equal score. Given that some lineages are overrepresented in GenBank (e.g., Mass strains), this results in the scores of those reads (e.g., Mass reads) being divided by a large number, effectively reducing the score for any single alignment. However, because there is only one read per lineage in the IBV-lineage-typing database, it has insufficient diversity to determine if there is more than one strain of the same lineage present in a sample. Thus, the All-IBV database provides the diversity required for that analysis.",

For nanopore sequencing data, pre-processing steps were performed to prepare data for downstream analysis. Briefly, nanopore reads (FAST5) were basecalled using Albacore v.2.02 (https://github.com/Albacore/albacore) with the following parameters (read_fast5_ basecaller.py -i /Input_reads_fast5/ -recursive -t 4 -s / Output_files -flowcell FLO-MIN107 -kit SQK-LSK108 -o fastq). Porechop (https://github.com/rrwick/Porechop) was used for adapter-trimming (default setting), barcode-based demultiplexing (default settings), and to trim an additional 21 nucleotides representing the S1 primer sequences (porechop -i Input_file.fastq -extra_end_trim 21 -b ./output_ demultiplexed/). After barcode and adapter removal, reads were analyzed with a script-based, 2-step data analysis protocol, which includes centrifuge-kreport as taxonomic read classifier 24 using the sequences in the above-mentioned BLAST databases. Briefly, basecalled reads (FASTQ) from individual barcoded samples were used as an input. First, the basecalled reads were aligned to the IBV-lineage-typing database using BLASTn and reads were clustered based on the read sequence alignment to the respective prototype sequence of IBV lineage. These read clusters were used to interpret the presence of IBV genotypes and lineages in the samples. For the identification of IBV types, the lineagebased read clusters were individually aligned to the All-IBV database, which produced subclusters of reads. Each of these read subclusters potentially represents a different sequence of IBV and was further used for interpretation. Knowing that MinION sequencing has a high sequencing error rate in individual reads, further steps were added in the data analysis algorithm to obtain a more accurate consensus sequence. Therefore, these read subclusters were mapped, using Geneious mapper in Geneious software v.11.1.3. (Biomatters, Auckland, New Zealand), to the IBV-lineage-typing database (a reference FASTA file) to obtain consensus sequences from each subcluster. A minimum threshold for the number of reads per consensus sequence was not set because in 2 samples (sample 4 in run 1 and sample 12 in run 2), only 1 and 5 IBV reads were obtained, respectively; therefore, consensus sequences were built from all of the available IBV reads per subcluster.

The MinION-negative samples included sample 5, which was consistently negative with RT-rtPCR and RT-PCR assays (and thus interpreted as IBV negative), and sample 1, which had the highest cycle threshold (Ct) values in the pan-IBV RT-qPCR (Table 1) . Sequencing data were further analyzed to determine if multiple IBV genotypes or lineages could be detected. Lineage 1 and lineage 27 from genotype I (GI-L1, GI-L27), and lineage 1 from genotype IV (GIV-L1), were the detected lineages in the samples. Results from the individual RT-rtPCR assay for GA08 (GI-L27), and RT-PCR assays for GIV-L1 and GI-L1, confirmed the presence of multiple IBV genotypes and lineages in 6 of the 9 IBV-positive samples (1-4, 6, 7); AmpSeq results confirmed multiple genotypes and lineages in 4 (2, 4, 6, 7) of those 6 samples (AmpSeq failed to detect any IBV in 1, and failed to detect GIV-L1 in 3). The presence of a single lineage was confirmed by PCR-based assays and AmpSeq in 3 samples (8-10; Table 3 ).",

High-quality consensus sequences were obtained from the other read clusters (>5 reads per cluster; Supplementary Table 2 ). Each of the obtained consensus sequences was compared to GenBank sequences using BLAST, which revealed >99% sequence identity to respective IBV sequences ( Table 4 ). As described in the Sanger sequencing section, 2 samples (8 and 9) contained only 1 IBV type per the non-MinION assays, and the AmpSeq results were consistent with these findings. Non-MinION assays showed that 7 samples contained 2 or more IBVs per sample. Six samples (1, 3, 4, 6, 7, 10) contained 2 IBV types per sample (Table 4; Supplementary Tables 1, 2 ). Of those 6 samples, AmpSeq detected both IBV types in 4 samples (4, 6, 7, 10), 1 IBV type in 1 sample (3), and no IBV in 1 sample (1; as mentioned above, sample 1 was the sample with the highest Ct value). Of note, sample 10 contained 2 IBV types from the same lineage and AmpSeq was able to identify both types within this sample. Finally, the seventh multi-type sample (2) contained 4 IBV types per the non-MinION results, and the AmpSeq detected 2 of those 4 types. These data show that a coinfection of multiple IBV lineages existed in the abovementioned samples, but a single RT-rtPCR, or Sanger sequencing of a single clone, may not have detected these coinfecting IBV lineages and multiple assays were required to detect all the IBV types. However, the AmpSeq protocol accurately detected multiple IBV lineages in 4 of 7 samples, with partial detection in 2 of the remaining 3 samples (Table 4 ). In samples that had the same IBV type, BLAST search of consensus sequences obtained from AmpSeq and Sanger sequencing identified the same (or highly related IBV type for samples 6 [GA98] and 9) in the NCBI nt database as per parameters described in the Methods section.",

Rapid pan-IBV RT-qPCR and serotype-specific RT-rtPCR assays 4,23,36 have been used for serotype identification; however, positive results from RT-rtPCR is insufficient to determine the IBV genotype; thus, sequence analysis of the IBV S1 gene is required.

Although mixed IBVs were not 100% identified (0 of 2 in sample 1; 2 of 4 in sample 2; and 1 of 2 in sample 3) in 3 samples with our AmpSeq method, detection of those mixed IBVs required several non-AmpSeq assays.

Although AmpSeq did detect all genotypes in 4 samples, in 3 cases not all of the genotypes of IBVs were detected. A potential explanation of partial detection of multiple IBV genotypes could be the relative abundance of IBV genotypes in these clinical samples. It could also be that amplification of these IBV genotypes by serotype-specific RT-rtPCR assays is more efficient given the small targeted fragment size (e.g., 120 bp for PCR and ~1,600 bp for AmpSeq) and better primer alignment to the target (e.g., degenerate bases are used in the S1 primers used for AmpSeq). One complicating factor of our current AmpSeq protocol is that the IBV target sequence 27 was not originally designed for high specificity, especially from clinical samples. As such, a high proportion of total reads were non-IBV reads (e.g., often mapping to the chicken genome, data not shown), consistent with the extra bands visible in the original report for these target sequences. 28 Future studies to reduce the proportion of chicken reads may increase the sensitivity of this assay. Additionally, it is possible that certain genotypes are better complemented to the S1 primers than others and may outcompete those IBV genotypes for amplification in the AmpSeq protocol. Also, increasing the total number of reads collected by AmpSeq may improve the ability to detect all of the genotypes in a given sample. It is possible to allow the sequencing to continue longer to obtain more reads per sample. Overall, AmpSeq is a feasible test for IBV characterization, and work is ongoing to improve this new type of assay.",

            "text": "Cost and time efficiency of a sequencing protocol can be improved through the multiplexing of more samples in a single sequencing run. 3, 47 In our study, samples (run 1 = 10, run 2 = 5) were simultaneously multiplexed (i.e., pooled and then sequenced in one run) while maintaining IBV genotyping from data collected. Given that the MinION flow cells were not exhausted, and can be washed and re-used, the AmpSeq method also has the potential for sequential multiplexing. This would decrease the need to hold samples for weeks while waiting for the cost-optimal number of samples for simultaneous multiplexing. The single protocol nature of AmpSeq, the ability to obtain S1 gene sequence results, realtime data analysis, and flexibility of testing design makes MinION-based AmpSeq a viable sequencing protocol for genotyping and lineage typing of IBV. The advent of real-time, in-house, third-generation sequencing represents a transformative opportunity for diagnostic laboratories by offering the ability to more fully characterize PCR reactions beyond confirming amplicon size (e.g., routine electrophoresis), Sanger sequencing RT-PCR products, or by confirming a partial sequence through probe hybridization (e.g., probe-based RT-rtPCR). However, the interpretation of such large data sets represents a challenge to veterinary diagnosticians. Read-based classification software such as Centrifuge, 24 Kraken, 50 QIIME, 5 and Mothur 37 have been used to identify and profile microbial species; however, the high error rate 20 of nanopore reads translates to poor classification accuracy for many of these tools. Alternatively, de novo 3,26 or reference-based 18 assembly methods have been used in MinION and other deep-sequencing platforms. Using a strategy similar to other unbiased laboratory tests (e.g., standard bacterial cultures), an approach was developed to maximize usage of reads (i.e., reads are not discarded based on pre-set length or abundance requirements, similar to how a single colony may be interpreted as a significant result). This approach uses read-based classification against a database containing an equal number of representative IBV sequences per lineage to detect and classify the IBV reads based on their lineage, before conducting read-based classification of IBV reads by using all available IBV sequences in a separate database. Finally, lineage-clustered IBV read assignments are interpreted by a veterinary diagnostician to result in reads available for consensus building. The use of a final consensus alignment helps to overcome the individual error rate of MinION sequencing. 3 Similarly, the absence of predetermined metrics used in de novo assembly allows for the informed decision as to how many consensus sequences to build, a bioinformatics problem when dealing with clinical cases that can contain more than one type of IBV (e.g., similar to how there is not a predetermined number of significant bacterial colonies). Confirmatory follow-up tests (e.g., RT-PCR) may be needed when dealing with low numbers of reads in clinical samples; however, future testing of this new technology will allow for creating standards for such confirmatory testing.",

Thus, MinION-based AmpSeq coupled with data analysis workflow for identification, differentiation, and accurate prediction of IBV genotypes from clinical swab samples can be used as an adjunct to other established rapid detection assays 9,12 until extensive testing of this protocol is done to improve and validate AmpSeq for IBV identification. Furthermore, AmpSeq-based assays can be and are being applied to other viral pathogens, 3,37 demonstrating the power and utility of this method.",
