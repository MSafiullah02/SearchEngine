            "text": "Clonorchis sinensis (C. sinensis), an important fishborne zoonotic trematodes parasite, is prevalent in Asian countries and regions including China, South Korea, northern Vietnam, and Russia. Adult worms of C. sinensis live in the intrahepatic bile duct of definitive host. In addition to human beings, various other kinds of mammals can be definitive hosts of C. sinensis, such as cat, dog, pig, rabbits, etc. As reported, the average prevalences of C. sinensis infection in dogs and cats were 20.5% and 41.8% in the Pearl River Delta region which is the most important endemic area in Guangdong province (Lin et al., 2011). And nearly 35 million people are estimated to be infected with C. sinensis globally, of whom approximately 15 million are in China (Lai et al. 2016; Qian et al. 2016; Tang et al. 2016b) and bring a series of diseases like indigestion, biliary inflammation, bile duct obstruction, even liver cirrhosis, and hepatic carcinoma (Tang et al. 2016b). Accumulating evidence demonstrated that there is an aetiological relation between clonorchiasis and cholangiocarcinoma in human beings (Lun et al. 2005; Machicado and Marcos 2016; Zheng et al. 2017). However, we still lack effective strategy to completely prevent the spread of C. sinensis at present (Tang et al. 2016b). Human beings or other definitive hosts get infected by ingesting raw or undercooked fishes (the second intermediate hosts) containing live metacercaria (Lun et al. 2005). On the one hand, in epidemic areas wild animals served as the definitive hosts (reservoir hosts) for C. sinensis (Qian et al. 2016) which could be infectious source. For example, in Southern China, a large number of dogs and cats roam freely in rural settings, and the presence of these animals in proximity with people may represent a risk of parasitic zoonoses including C. sinensis (Fang et al. 2015; Nguyen et al. 2018). On the other hand, eating raw fish has been deeply rooted in culture of the area. In previous, most vaccine trials focused on the definitive host of C. sinensis instead of the intermediate hosts including freshwater fishes or snails (the first intermediate hosts). Protein-based or nucleic acid-based vaccine trials have been conducted on the rat model, but none of the vaccine candidates brought a protective effection (worm reduction rate) of more than 70%(Qian et al. 2016; Tang et al. 2016b). Freshwater fishes (e.g., Ctenopharyngodon idellus, Carassius auratus, and Hypophthalmichthys nobilis) serve as the second intermediate host for C. sinensis. Hence, we speculate that cutting off the life cycle of C. sinensis by preventing the cercaria invasion or metacercariae formation in freshwater fish might be an efficacious tactic to control the prevalence of C. sinensis.",

            "text": "Vaccine has been the most effective method for combating infectious disease in aquaculture industry (Gudding and Van Muiswinkel 2013; Plant and Lapatra 2011). Compared with other immunization routes (injection and immersion route), oral vaccine is a preferable route as it is needle-free, no size limitation, lower cost, and more convenient for farmer operation (Plant and Lapatra 2011). However, oral immunization suffers from antigen degradation in the gastrointestinal tract of fish, which will affect the protective effect (Quentel and Vigneulle 1997). A considerable amount of investigations have proved that spores of Bacillus subtilis (B. subtilis) were a potent antigen delivery platform for oral vaccine (Ricca et al. 2014; Rosales-Mendoza and Angulo 2015; Tavares Batista et al. 2014). Because B. subtilis spores can survive extreme environment in the gastrointestinal tract, thus protect the antigens from digestion and degradation (Duc le et al. 2003). Besides, B. subtilis were widely employed as probiotic additives as it enhances the growth performance, digestive enzyme activities, immune responses, and disease resistance of fishes or shrimps (Liu et al. 2017; Sanchez-Ortiz et al. 2016; Truong Thy et al. 2017; Wang et al. 2010). B. subtilis spores were widely investigated as a delivery vehicle for the oral vaccine in aquaculture industry (Fu et al. 2010; Valdez et al. 2014).",

In 1 \u00d7 1011 CFU/g B.s-CotC-CsPmy spores administrated fishes, mRNA levels of IgM, IgZ, TNF-\u03b1, and IL-8 significantly elevated in the head kidney and spleen, and transciptional levels of tight-junction proteins in foregut, midgut, and hindgut of grass carp obviously increased too.

In bony fishes, as there are a lot of lymphoid cells, macrophages, eosinophilic, neutrophilic granulocytes, and other secretory cells in skin, it is also a main tissue-producing mucosal immune response besides intestinal mucosa (Salinas 2015). Antigen-specific immune globulins (e.g., IgM and IgZ) were secreted from intestinal mucus and skin mucus when they were stimulated by heterogeneous antigens so that they serve as the first line of immunological barriers against pathogenic invasion (Zhu et al. 2013). Well-studied IgM is the main kind of immune globulins in grass carp. IgZ, analogous to mammalian IgA, also plays a specialized role in mucosal immune responses of fish (Xu et al. 2013).",

IL-8 was considered to be one of the most important proinflammatory cytokines in grass carp (Wang et al. 2013). IL-8 expresses in immune-related tissues in grass carp such as the head kidney, spleen, gill, and so on. IL-8 level would increase when grass carp was stimulated by heterologous antigens or pathogens resulting in attraction of other immune-related cells for fighting against the pathogens (Wang et al. 2013). TNF-\u03b1 was also proved to be a crucial cytokine involved in immune regulation and mediates the inflammatory responses in grass carp (Zhang et al. 2012; Zhu et al. 2013). In the current study, mRNA levels of TNF-\u03b1 and IL-8 in the head kidney and spleen in B.s-CotC-CsPmy-108 and 1011 groups were significantly up-regulated at week 6 (Fig. S1). It demonstrated that oral administration of the recombinant spores activated the innate immunity and might invoke specific adaptive immune responses (Liu et al. 2015). Additionally, the TNF-\u03b1level had no significant difference in B.s-CotC-CsPmy 1 \u00d7 105 and 1 \u00d7 108 group in the head kidney. The possible reason might be that the spore dosages (1 \u00d7 105 and 1 \u00d7 108 CFU/g) were not enough to induce TNF-\u03b1secretion in the head kidney because a certain amount of the spores might be excreted from the intestine with the intestinal movement (Leser et al. 2008).",

Variation in the diversity and abundance of bacteria in intestine seriously impairs the immune development and function (Nayak 2010).

Rikenellaceae were considered as intestine beneficial bacteria, as Alistipes genus belong to the family can produce fibrinolysin, digest gelatin, and ferment carbohydrate resulting in enhancement of digestion in fishes(Li et al. 2016). Odoribacter can produce short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs) such as acetic acid, succinic acid, or butyric acid, which are beneficial to both microbial and epithelial cell growth of host (Meehan and Beiko 2014). Desulfovibrio has also been proved to be beneficial to the microbial community and able to improve energy recovery from food (Li et al. 2016). Lachnospiraceae are a butyrate-producing superfamily, which can produce an enzyme to break down a wide variety of complex carbohydrates found in plants (Hao et al. 2017b). Hence, higher abundances of these bacteria found in the intestines would probably be helpful to digestion function of grass carp and promote their growth performance.",

Compared with na\u00efve group, metacercaria intensities in B.s-CotC-CsPmy-1011 spore treated grass carp were significantly decreased (Fig. 5C). We conjectured that immune responses induced by the recombinant spores (B.s-CotC-CsPmy) played roles in protecting against adherence or invasion of cercaria to grass carp. It needed further study to illuminate the involved mechanisms. When grass carp was orally administrated with B.s-CotC-CSCP spore (107 dosages), no metacercariae were observed (Tang et al. 2017). We speculated that might be due to two reasons: firstly, the function and immunogenicity of CsPmy were different from those of CsCP (Tang et al. 2016a; Wang et al. 2012) resulting in different protect effect. Secondly, the methods used for metacercariae detection were different. In the former study, metacercariae were checked by direct compression method by randomly picking fish flesh from 5 different positions in one fish (Tang et al. 2017), which might lead to missed detection when the infection intensity was low. While in our present study, we checked by digestion method with high detection rate. That is, the fishes were totally digested with artificial gastric juice, so that every metacercariae could be detected.",

Additionally, oral treatment of the spores in grass carp could reduce the abundance of potentially pathogenic bacteria (e.g., Flavobacterium) and enhance the abundance of probiotics (e.g., Streptococcus, Lactobacillus) or bacteria associated with digestion. Our work suggested that B. subtilis spore presenting CsPmy on the surface is a promising effect, safe, and needle-free oral vaccine candidate for prevention of C. sinensis infection in grass carp. Our study established the cornerstone for the prevention of C. sinensis infection in both human and mammalian reservoir hosts by using fish vaccine to cut off its life cycle. This work also shed light on the vaccine development for other zoonosis.",
