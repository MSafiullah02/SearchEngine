With current concerns about new, emerging respiratory viruses (e.g. avian A/H7N9 influenza, Middle East Respiratory Syndrome coronavirus \u2013 MERS-CoV), it is useful for infection control purposes to quantify the potential, relative risk posed by such exhaled pathogens. One component of this risk assessment is to estimate the fraction of the exhaled airflow that is re-inhaled during normal (nasal) breathing. This will impact upon risk assessment models that assume human exhaled aerosol as the main source for such exposures, with the fraction of re-inhaled exhaled air potentially not contributing to the final exhaled, airborne pathogen load. This value has been previously reported by Laverge et al. [3] to be about 5% with a tracer gas experiment on the supine thermal manikin (steady condition), and by Zhu et al. [4] to be 17% by CFD simulation on the standing thermal manikin, but no experimental data of dynamic breathing processes has yet been performed, despite of the significant difference in the reported re-inhalation ratios.",

The breathing airflow has a maximum velocity of about 1\u20132 m/s, and can be approximated by a sinusoidal function. Respiratory airflow can be influenced by human thermal plumes. Schlieren optical systems have long been used to visualize the plume and its interaction with human respiratory activities [7], [8], [9]. The human thermal plumes were quantified using hot-wire anemometers and Particle Image Velocimetry (PIV) techniques, and by Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) approaches [10], [11], [12], [13], [14]. The thermal plume of a standing person begins to turn into turbulent flow at the chest level when the Grashof number exceeds 109 and reaches a maximum velocity of 0.2 m/s above the head [7]. The maximum velocity at the breathing zone is about 0.1 m/s with a boundary thickness of around 0.1 m [10] for a standing occupant in quiescent air Factors that influence the thermal plume, e.g. supine or sitting postures, clothing insulation, walking of the occupant, have also been investigated [7], [15], [16], [17].",

The thermal plume plays an important role in particle transport from lower levels to the breathing zone [4], [18], [19]. In the case of oral breathing in quiescent air, about one third of the inhaled air is entrained from around the mouth, and approximately two thirds is from below [12]. However, these measurements or simulations were mostly obtained under steady exhaling or inhaling conditions. According to Lewis et al.

The thickness of the plume around the breathing zone is about 0.08 m, which is similar to the plume described by Craven and Settles [10]. In addition, a stronger plume with a maximum velocity of 1.48 cm/s was also produced for comparison as described in the Discussion.",

After including the effect of the rising thermal plume, although this value quadrupled, it is still very small compared with the CFD simulation results of Zhu et al. [3], which is 17%. The 50 \u03bcm polyamide particles (\u03c1 = 1030 kg/m3) is similar in density with water, and it is dynamically equivalent to particles of 1.76 \u03bcm in air. Golshahi et al. [21] measured aerosol deposition in a replica of the present pediatric airway, and found that less than 10% of particles with this aerodynamic particle size deposited at the same flow rates considered by us. Regarding interception, it is not possible to use similarity to extrapolate from the measurements of Golshahi et al. [21]. However, since the flow in the present pediatric nasal airways is expected to be laminar [25], a simple estimate for the amount of deposition, assuming neutrally buoyant particles, can be made based on the fractional area of the airway that is within 50 \u03bcm of the airway wall. This value is 2% for the present pediatric airway, indicating negligible deposition by interception.",

            "text": "\nFig. 7\nillustrates the interaction of the thermal plume and exhaled air (also shown in video form, using human volunteers, by Tang et al. [9]). The nasal breathing jet starts with a high momentum, compared with the thermal plume of about 0.1 m/s at the chest and nose level [10], mostly travelling in an undisturbed trajectory. The maximum visible propagation distance and derived exhalation velocity for nasal breathing were 0.6 m and 1.4 m/s, respectively [22], which compares well with our experimental results. However, the momentum decays quickly by convective entrainment, so the exhaled air trapped by the thermal plume may be carried upwards into the breathing region again. The estimated ratio of the trapped air volume in Fig. 7a to the total conical volume is 11%. It is worth noting that the head angle has an important effect, as the exhaled air would impact on the chest and be mostly trapped with the head leaning downwards to 30\u00b0 (Fig. 7b), while only about 5% of exhaled air is trapped with the head leaning upwards to 30\u00b0 (Fig. 7c). We are not able to investigate the effect of the head angle, because the connection between the respiratory model and the cylindrical vessel is rigid. Head angle is a topic for future study. It is also expected the effect of a thermal plume in the supine or sitting posture is different from that for a standing posture [7]. Besides, although we tried to use a plate as the human chest in the thermal-plume setting (Fig. 2), the geometry is simplified; simplicity of the body shape might introduce some error, e.g. boundary layer separation at the shoulder and separation of the rising plume under the chin make the plume itself more complex [12]. It was indicated by Zhu et al. [4] that trapping of exhaled air under the jaw might increase the re-inhalation ratio. In addition, in the presence of background ventilation, it would be more complicated, as ventilated air would weaken or enhance the rising thermal plume as well as interact with breathed airflow directly. For example, the breathing zone will be located in the thermal plume region if the occupant is back-to-the wind in a horizontal airflow, in which situation a relatively higher re-inhalation ratio is expected [29].",

First, it should be noted that others have found that the upper airways of young children (<5 years old) are not geometrically similar to those in adults [24], thereby violating a basic tenet of such analysis. However, the essential flow features of the exhaled air flow are expected to be determined more by the nasal valve and vestibules than the more distal regions of the respiratory tract. While, the breathing parameters such as frequency and flow rate are different between children and adults, the basic aspects of the flows associated with the turbulent exhalation jet and inhalation potential flow structure are likely similar. Hence we believe that the present results of low-re-halation rate may broadly apply to adults.",

The presence of the rising thermal plume increases this fraction several-fold, however, it still remains a very small fraction of the exhaled air volume (<0.2%). Factors that act to reduce the fraction of exhaled air that is re-inhaled include the initial inertia of the exhaled flow and its dilution by the ambient air. The rising thermal plume seems to have a mixed effect on this phenomenon in that it may also act to dilute this exhaled air to some extent, but also convects some of it back into the inhalation zone, increasing the fraction that could be potentially re-inhaled. More detailed investigations using more realistic full-body thermal breathing human-like manikins are required to investigate this phenomenon further in different postures and subject ages, including when sitting and supine, where the effects of the thermal plume will differ.",
