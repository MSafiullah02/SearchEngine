The research process of T\u03b11 began with the study on the thymus, which is an important vital organ for homeostatic maintenance of peripheral immune system [48]. In 1966, Goldstein et al. [35] first isolated and described a lymphocytopoietic factor from calf thymus, which was termed \u201cthymosin\u201d. The multiple action of thymosin on the immune, endocrine and central nervous systems was revised by Goldstein and Badamchian [32]. Further purification of this factor led to the isolation of a heat-stable acetone-insoluble preparation, termed thymosin fraction 5 (TF5), which could induce T cell differentiation, enhance immunological function [36] and induce apoptosis of neuroendocrine tumor cells [72]. The promising results seen with TF5 provided the scientific rationale to further isolate and characterize the molecules in TF5 responsible for the reconstitution of T-cell immunity. Hence, T\u03b11 was first purified from TF5 in 1977 [34] and has been found to be 10\u20131000 times as active as TF5 evaluated in vivo and in vitro\n[47].",

T\u03b11 is a highly conserved acid peptide, ubiquitously existing in lymphoid tissues such as spleen and lymph nodes, non-lymphoid tissues such as lungs, kidneys, and brain, but mainly existing in thymus gland [33], especially in the thymic epithelial cells. Interestingly, the secretion of T\u03b11 is not modulated by other hormones or releasing factors [54]. As a potent biological response modifier (BRM), T\u03b11 has intensive clinical applications. In the first randomized double-blind Phase II trial of T\u03b11 carried out by Schulof et al. [68], administration of synthetic T\u03b11 to postradiotherapy patients with non-small cell lung cancer exhibited significant improvements in relapse-free and overall survival, which was most pronounced in patients with nonbulky tumors. Now T\u03b11 is in clinical trials worldwide for the treatment of several types of cancer, hepatitis B virus (HBV) and hepatitis C virus (HCV) infections, which connect closely with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) [77]. Additionally, T\u03b11 shows remarkable effects in the treatment of other diseases such as severe sepsis [87], [43], acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) [38], severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) [23], gastrointestinal and systemic infectious disorders [39], and spontaneous peritonitis in individuals with cirrhosis [49].",

Evidence has shown that T\u03b11 increased the efficiency of T cell maturation [1], stimulated precursor stem cell differentiation into the CD4+/CD8+ T cells [57] and balanced CD3/CD4+/CD8+ T cells of peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) [84]. By stimulating natural killer (NK) cells and cytotoxic lymphocytes (CD8+ T cell), T\u03b11 could directly kill virally infected cells [67]. By activating dendritic cells (DCs), T\u03b11 was able to protect immunocompromised mice from death caused by aspergillosis [62]. T\u03b11 stimulated a significant increase of IL-2 and led to a decrease in the Th2 cytokines such as IL-4 and IL-10 in patients with chronic HCV [67]. Besides, T\u03b11 remarkably decreased the severity of severe acute pancreatitis by having a negative effect on serum levels of IL-1\u03b2 and tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-\u03b1) [84]. T\u03b11 also upregulated specific cytokine receptors such as high-affinity IL-2 cytokine receptors [42].",

            "text": "Although the observations of the T\u03b11 potential immunoregulatory effects are clearly evident, what is not clear is the mechanisms of action on the immune system. It was reported that T\u03b11 could directly modulate the expression of cytokine genes, MHC class I, MHC class II related genes as well as a significant number of new genes, acting as immune system regulators [26]. Naylor and his colleagues demonstrated that genes of major histocompatability proteins, costimulatory molecules, chemokines and cytokines, and their receptors were upregulated in both T cells and monocytes exposed to T\u03b11 [54], indicating that there were multiple targets for its immune-enhancing activity. As illustrated in Fig. 1\n, T\u03b11-mediated stimulation of intracellular signaling pathways included mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) transduction pathways [71] and TNF-\u03b1 receptor-associated factor 6 (TRAF6) signal pathway by activating I-kappa B kinase (IKK) [88]. T\u03b11 has also been found to induce IL-6, IL-10 and IL-12 expression via IRAK4/1/TRAF6/PKC\u03b6/IKK/NF-\u03baB and TRAF6/MAPK/AP-1 pathways [56]. These pathways are shared by many cytokines, which predict potential synergy between T\u03b11 and cytokines. T\u03b11 was able to prime DC for antifungal Th1 resistance through Toll-like receptor 9 (TLR9)/myeloid differentiation factor 88 (MyD88)-dependent signaling [62]. Besides, DCs could also be primed by T\u03b11-induced activation of p38 MAPK, NF-\u03baB pathways [83]. Activated plasmacytoid DCs (pDC) led to the activation of interferon regulatory factor 7 and the promotion of the IFN-\u03b1/IFN-\u03b3-dependent effector pathway, which resulted in vivo in protection against primary murine cytomegalovirus infection [63]. Moreover, activated indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase (IDO) could induce transplantation tolerance and reduce inflammation allergy [64]. Recently, Qin et al. found that T\u03b11 inhibited HepG2 cells proliferation might associated with protein kinase B (Akt) signaling pathway [60].",

To explore the anti-metastatic/antitumor activity of T\u03b11, it was subcutaneously injected into BALB/c-mice, which significantly reduced liver and lung metastases and decreased local tumor growth [6]. Moody et al. investigated the effects of T\u03b11 on mammary carcinogenesis in fisher rats and found that T\u03b11 could reduce mammary carcinoma incidence and prolong survival time [52]. In another breast adenoma model, T\u03b11 increased the survival time in female C3(1)SV40T antigen transgenic mice and fisher rats, but it remained to be determined whether the immune response also increased or not [53]. The antitumor activity of T\u03b11 was most effective when the lung adenomas were small, which was based on studies proformed by Moody who gave T\u03b11 daily to A/J mice bearing lung adenoma [53]. T\u03b11 may fight against tumors through either stimulating the immune system or directly inhibiting the proliferation of tumor cells.",

In DHD-K12 colorectal cancer model, combination of 5-FU, IL-2 and T\u03b11 could dramatically increase survival rates as well as control tumor metastasis [26]. Similarly, compared with Carmustine (BCNU) monotherapy, intraperitoneal injection of T\u03b11 and BCNU to adult Long Evans rats bearing glioblastoma could significantly lower the tumor burdens and increase the cure rates [73]. Since the cascades and feedback networks of immune responses, the combination of immunoactive molecules that affected different immune effector cells resulted in a stimulation of the immune response significantly stronger than that evoked by single treatments.

Most of the studies have evaluated the efficacy of T\u03b11 in the treatment of HBeAg-positive and HBeAg-negative chronic hepatitis B. For instance, administering T\u03b11 either 0.8 mg or 1.6 mg to 316 Japanese patients with HBeAg-positive chronic hepatitis B showed HBeAg seroconversion in 18.8% and 21.5% at 48 weeks after the end of treatment, respectively [37]. Similarly, administering T\u03b11 1.6 mg to Chinese patients with HBeAg-negative chronic hepatitis B twice weekly showed a complete response, defined as normalization of alanine transaminase (ALT) and undetectable HBV DNA by PCR assay, in 11 of 26 patients (42.3%) at 6 months after the end of treatment [86]. Zhang et al. searched materials from different databases and analyzed eight trials using meta analysis. They found that lamivudine and T\u03b11 combination treatment was particularly prominent than lamivudine monotherapy in terms of ALT normalization rate, virological response rate and HBeAg seroconversion rate [89]. Conversely, Lee et al. [41] revealed that combining T\u03b11 and lamivudine did not display a better benefit to virological and biochemical response than the lamivudine monotherapy. Maybe the small trial scale led to the divergent results.",

In addition, T\u03b11 was well tolerated with no significant adverse effects observed [66]. Approximately 50% of treatment-naive HCV patients failed to achieve a sustained virologic response (SVP) with standard peg-IFN and ribavirin therapy [21], so a triple combination therapy with peg-IFN-\u03b12a, ribavirin and T\u03b11 has been developed and proved to be a safe [7] and effective [59] treatment option for difficult-to-treat HCV patients who are refractory to prior conventional treatment.",

            "text": "Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) specially targets cells that express CD4, such as macrophages, DCs and CD4+ T cells. When the virus becomes lymphotropic, it begins to infect CD4+ T cells efficiently followed by significantly declined antibody class switching. Furthermore, CD8+ T cells are not stimulated as effectively, facilitating the escape of the virus from immune control and the collapse of the whole immune system [51]. Since significant immune responses play an important role in the prevention of infection with human HIV, it is thought that the induction of strong immune responses especially CTL responses against HIV-1 could be important to prevent the onset of acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS) [74]. One study has suggested that combination of T\u03b11, zidovudine (AZT) and IFN-\u03b1 resulted in a significant increase in the number and function of CD4+ T cells and a reduction in HIV titers [27]. Another interesting finding was provided by Chadwick et al. [9], who studied the safety and efficacy of T\u03b11 in combination with highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) in stimulating immune reconstitution. The results demonstrated that T\u03b11 appeared to be very well tolerated and could dramatically increase the levels of signal joint T cell receptor excision circles (sjTREC) in patients with advanced HIV disease. However, longer treatment duration of T\u03b11 in augmenting the immune reconstitution needs further investigation.",

The use of protease-deficient host strains and fusion tags, such as his-tag and thioredoxin can help to avoid non-specific proteolytic degradation and facilitate purification. Following this approach, the synthesized human T\u03b11 gene was inserted into pET-28a (+) plasmid and then inductively expressed as a soluble form in E. coli BL21, which is a protease-deficient host strain. Compared with other expression systems, the BL21/pET-28a system provided the highest expression level of fusion protein, which amounted to 70% of total expressed proteins [13]. Furthermore, T\u03b11 gene was inserted into pET32b (+) and expressed with thioredoxin in E. coli strain ER2566. After proteolytic cleavage and chemical acetylation, the resultant T\u03b11 was purified by reversed-phase high-performance liquid chromatography (RP-HPLC) with the yield of 29 mg per litre of bacterial culture. This method is simple, cost-effective and suitable for large-scale production of T\u03b11 [18].",

Thus, the expression of fused molecules of T\u03b11 and other BRMs which have synergistic effect with T\u03b11 was investigated. T\u03b11 and cBLyS, a soluble B-cell lymphocyte stimulator amplifying the humoral response, were fused with a flexible linker sequence and expressed in E. coli. This bifunctional lymphokine was useful in the treatment of various immunodeficiency syndromes and served as an immunomodulator to enhance the host's response to vaccination [69]. The fusion protein of T\u03b11 and consensus IFN\u03b1 (IFN\u03b1-con), which was soluble and amounted to more than 20% of total proteins of E. coli, showed higher antiviral effect than IFN\u03b1 and the activity in promoting lymphocyte proliferation was similar to commercial T\u03b11 [45].",

It is very likely that due to its pleiotropic biological activities, T\u03b11, either alone or combined with other treatment strategies, will have a broader spectrum of applications for successful treatment of various diseases in clinic. Up to now, chemical synthesis is the only effective way to produce T\u03b11 for clinical therapy. Genetic engineering is an attractive alternative route of expressing bioactive T\u03b11, but at present, it offers no higher purity of T\u03b11 compared with chemical synthesis. Recently, gene expression of T\u03b11 concatemer and fusion proteins have become a major research focus, which are effective strategies for facilitating purification, increasing production and reducing production costs. It is believed that the rapid development of biotechnology may allow application of T\u03b11 products obtained by genetic engineering in clinic in the future.",

When digested with BglII and BamHI, the two fragments had identical termini and could be ligated with T4 DNA ligase subsequently forming a new sequence GGATCT, which could not be digested by neither BamHI nor BglII. Therefore, a plasmid containing double T\u03b11 genes was constructed and could not be destroyed when the concatemer T\u03b11 gene of 4 repeats was constructed. Thus, the plasmid containing concatemer T\u03b11 gene of 4 repeats and 6 repetats could also be constructed [90].
