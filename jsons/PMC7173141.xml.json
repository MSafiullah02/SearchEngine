The disease is multifocal, with a course ranging from indolent, with only skin manifestations, to fulminant, with extensive visceral involvement.",

Although the classic type remains more prevalent among elderly men of Mediterranean origin, it has been diagnosed worldwide and typically follows a benign course. The African endemic form of KS was first described in 1914 and occurs predominantly among young black men aged 25 to 40 years.2 There is also a lymphadenopathic subvariant of the African form that affects children at a mean age of 3 years.3 In the 1970s, a third form associated with immunosuppressant treatment was described among recipients of organ transplantation, patients on long-term corticosteroids for various disorders, and patients immunosuppressed as a result of other therapeutic regimens, including chemotherapy (iatrogenic form).4., 5. Finally, in 1981, an epidemic of KS among young men who had sex with men in the United States served as the harbinger of a new immunodeficiency syndrome, subsequently identified as being associated with HIV infection (epidemic form).6 As the HIV epidemic progressed, KS was found almost exclusively among homosexual men.7 Due to epidemiologic data indicating the high incidence of KS among persons at greater risk for sexually transmitted infections, a further independent infectious agent was proposed in the etiology of epidemic KS.7\n",

In particular, four subtypes (B, N, Q, and R) have been found almost exclusively among Sub-Saharan African samples, one (D/E) has been found only within indigenous South Asian and Polynesian (Pacific Rim) populations, and three (A/C, J, and K) have been identified almost exclusively in Eurasian subjects (European, United States, North Asian, and Middle Eastern).20 Sequence analysis of the highly variable ORF K1 region has allowed the identification of seven major HHV-8 subtypes (A, B, C, D, E, F, and Z), comprising each several sub-clades, whose distribution in the world parallels that of ORF 26 variants: HHV-8 subtype B predominates in Africa and F has been identified in Ugandan Bantu tribe, subtype D is present in the Pacific islands; subtype E clusters in ancient populations, like Brazilian Amerindians, whereas A and C predominate in Europe and the United States.21., 22., 23., 24., 25.

The decreased frequency of MDM2 SNP309 G/G genotype in cutaneous KS patients could have several explanations including that G/G carriers with HHV-8 infection could be at increased risk for developing visceral KS, or highly aggressive HHV-8 related lymphoproliferative disorders such as primary effusion lymphoma (PEL) or multicentric Castleman\u2019s disease.51 The analysis of seven PEL cell lines for mutations and SNPs in 10 genes involved in apoptosis and cell cycle regulation, including SNP309 in MDM2 and codon 31 in CDKN1A genes has been demonstrated.52 Interestingly, three (42.8%) Epstein-Barr virus (EBV)\u2013negative cell lines, namely BC3, BCBL-1 and BCP, were homozygous for SNP309 G, suggesting a major role of this polymorphic allele in cell transformation, particularly in the absence of EBV co-infection.

In Uganda, from 1954 to 1960 and 1968 to 1970, KS represented 6.4% to 6.6% of all male cancer patients, respectively, with rare female cases53., 54.; however, from 1989 to 1991, KS prevalence in male cancer patients rose to 48.6% (incidence of 30.1/100,000), becoming the most frequently reported cancer in men, whereas prevalence in female cancer patients climbed to 17.9% (incidence of 11/100,000).55 Since the HIV epidemic, KS has become as common in women as in men and has been prevalent also in many African countries where it was almost unknown, but where HHV-8 has been shown to be prevalent.56 These observations point to a role for other factors in the etiology of KS, including the possibility that different HHV-8 variants might spread during HIV/AIDS epidemic.",

            "text": "Concerning immunity disorders, systemic immunodeficiency should be considered as well as conditions of local immune destabilization, such as lymphedema, caused by several agents, often environmental factors.57 In endemic KS, there is a relationship between KS and podoconiosis (non-filarial elephantiasis) and an increased prevalence of KS among rural peasants and cultivators toiling up highland soils containing volcanic clay minerals.58 Walking barefoot on volcanic soils exposes pores and sweat glands in bare feet permits abrasions and allows aluminosilicates and possibly iron oxides to be taken up by lymphatics. The silicates can cause an obstacle to lymph flow, inflammation of regional lymph nodes, and disruption of the immune control in the feet and legs. As a result, these sites become an immunocompromised district, namely, a body region where chronic lymph stasis leads to an immune stasis, responsible for the local outbreak of opportunistic infections (parasitic, bacterial, fungal) or tumors, as paradigmatically KS is. The link between the impairment of lymph circulation and regional immune dysfunction in classical KS was first proven in 1984.59 KS appeared on a lymphedematous leg of a patient with altered lymph drainage and lack of cell immune response confined to the lymphedematous limb. Intradermal skin tests to common antigens performed on the four limbs (forearms and legs) revealed no immune responses on the affected limb versus normal or even strong responses on the three unaffected limbs.59 Five years later, the same patient presented with lymphedema and new KS lesions on the other leg. On this occasion, skin tests were negative on both legs, whereas normal responses were still observed on the forearms.60 Two years later, KS lesions also appeared on both the forearms: At this time, skin tests were negative on all four limbs.60 A lymphologic and immunologic investigation performed in patients with classical KS sensitized with dinitrochlorobenzene proved that the affected limbs presented concomitant alteration of the lymph drainage and of the immune response.61 The role of chronic lymphedema in facilitating the onset of KS was stressed in an unusual localization (penis) of the classical form62 and even in the epidemic AIDS-related type.63 Although rarely emphasized in HIV-related KS, a variable degree of lymphedema (overt or subtle, a sort of microlymphedema) of the KS-involved areas is somewhat common in homosexual men and has a wide anatomic distribution, often without notable lymphadenopathy.64., 65. Also a localized trauma may be responsible for facilitating the onset of KS lesions selectively on the traumatized area.66., 67.\n",

            "text": "Some drugs proved to be associated with KS pathogenesis due to their immunomodulatory and proangiogenic effects. Quinine and its analogues, 4-aminoquinolines, are drugs used for many years in malaria treatment. The link between these drugs and KS is based on a series of clues that take into account the geographical distribution and incidence of KS in patients taking these drugs. In fact, HHV-8 seropositivity and KS have a high prevalence in areas such as sub-Saharan Africa, Italy, and Greece and low in northern Europe and Asia, which reflects the same pattern of distribution of malaria.75., 76. There are regions of the world, such as Brazil, Gambia, Ivory Coast, and Thailand, with high HHV-8 seroprevalence where KS and malaria are rare and the use of quinine derivatives is low, thus confirming the possible association of these drugs with KS development. In several regions of sub-Saharan Africa, despite the widespread resistance of Plasmodium to quinolines and the availability of more efficacious anti-malarial drugs, quinine and its analogues continue to be widely used in the treatment of malaria. In fact, since 2009, 31 African countries have recommended quinine as second-line treatment for uncomplicated malaria, 38 as first-line treatment of severe malaria, and 32 for treatment of malaria in the first trimester of pregnancy.77 In most of Africa, quinine is still used as monotherapy, contrary to recommendations by the World Health Organization (WHO).77 Quinine continues to play a significant role in the management of malaria in sub-Saharan Africa and other malaria endemic areas, and its use in routine practice may not be restricted to the stated WHO recommendations. In Cameroon, quinine has continued to be used as first-line therapy, with 45% of adults receiving oral quinine for uncomplicated malaria.78 Recent surveillance data from sentinel sites in Uganda showed that quinine was prescribed for up to 90% of children younger than age 5 years with uncomplicated malaria.79 Furthermore, this drug and its analogs are widely distributed to healthy children as preventive treatment (prophylaxis campaigns). The still widespread use of antimalarials might contribute to the high incidence of KS in the geographic areas where both KS and malaria are endemic. In fact, KS and its causative agent, HHV-8, have distinctive geographic distributions that are largely unexplained. For this reason, it has been put forward an \u201concoweed hypothesis,\u201d which suggests that environmental cofactors (such as some plants and natural products deriving from them) present in KS endemic regions may cause frequent reactivation of HHV-8 in infected subjects, thus leading to increased viral shedding and transmission.33., 80. Conversely, it has been hypothesized that quinine and its derivatives might better explain the epidemiology of KS than oncoweeds. This oncodrug hypothesis, specifically hints at quinine and its derivatives.81 In fact, it is worth noting that quinine, chloroquine, and hydroxychloroquine may affect the effectiveness of the immune response, being immunosuppressive drugs. It is well known that chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine are extensively used in the treatment of autoimmune diseases such as lupus erythematosus and rheumatoid arthritis.82 The immune-suppressive properties of these drugs may produce deleterious effects in the presence of viral infections or immunizations. For example, a randomized controlled trial to evaluate the antibody response of freshman veterinary students to intradermal human diploid-cell rabies vaccine administered concurrently with chloroquine have demonstrated that this drug taken in the dose recommended for malaria prophylaxis can reduce the antibody response to primary immunization with rabies vaccine.83 Incidentally, one could reasonably think that the unusually severe course run by the Spanish flu pandemic of 1918\u20131919 could have been facilitated by the documented large administration of quinine in flu patients, because at the time, quinine was considered the \u201cspecific\u201d remedy for fever attacks.84\n",

Several cases reported in the literature would indicate that ACE inhibitors might act as a trigger for the development of KS.86., 87. In fact, ACE inhibitors have immmunomodulatory effects. The immunomodulatory action of ACE inhibitors has been attributed to several mechanisms, including: (1) inhibition of the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines such as tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-\u03b1, interleukin (IL)-1, IL-6, and IL-12 produced by activated monocytes and dendritic cells, (b) antiproliferative activity, (c) inhibition of free radicals, (d) inhibition of metalloproteases and, (e) elevation of immunomodulatory prostaglandins.88 Suppression of ACE itself may explain immune alteration (possible immunosuppression) because ACE has been shown to be involved in immune function and to be up-regulated in inflammatory conditions. Furthermore, ACE inhibition enhances angiogenesis through the activation of the B2-receptor pathway. This proangiogenic effect may be associated with the up-regulation of endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS) expression, but would be independent by the vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) pathway.89 Other studies, however, have confirmed that the same eNOS up-regulation would be able to stimulate the VEGF pathway,90 or to stimulate angiogenesis through the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines or activation of cyclooxygenase-2.91\n",

For example, some contradictory data make it difficult to assess the relationship existing between antimalarial drugs and KS (Table 2\n). Chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine, quinine analogs, have recently being considered potential anticancer agents as well as chemosensitizer when used in combination with anticancer drugs, such as 5-fluorouracil in colon cancer cells or topotecan in lung cancer cells, possibly by inhibiting autophagy-dependent resistance to chemotherapy.92., 93. Autophagy is an evolutionarily conserved cell survival pathway that has been implicated as a potential mechanism of resistance to anticancer agents. In fact, it can promote cell survival in the face of stress induced by chemotherapeutic agents by breaking down cellular components to generate alternative sources of energy. Disruption of autophagy with chloroquine induces the accumulation of ubiquitin-conjugated proteins, stimulating apoptosis in several cancer cells.94 Chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine also inhibit angiogenesis and production of proinflammatory cytokines such as IL-1\u03b2, IL-6, IL-18, VEGF, fibroblast growth factors (FGF)-2, TNF-\u03b1, transforming growth factor-\u03b2 and IFN-\u03b2. Most cytokines are involved in the reactivation of the HHV-8 lytic cycle and induction of the microenvironment necessary for lesion formation, which is characterized by a triad of inflammation, angiogenesis, and production of cytokines and chemokines. Thus, these drugs can counteract the molecular targets by which HHV-8 is able to cause the disease and indirectly they can inhibit the action of the virus.95., 96.\n",

Some antiretroviral drugs such as foscarnet, ganciclovir, cidofovir, and adefovir are alleged to have anti-HHV-8 activity. In patients with limited cutaneous lesions (T0 early-stage disease and/or slowly proliferating disease) an effective HAART regimen may represent the first step of therapy for KS, with an ORR of 66% to 86% and a complete remission rate of 35%. KS lesions typically start to decrease and disappear completely within a few weeks or months. Frequently, KS may flare dramatically following the initiation of HAART, which seems to be a manifestation of the immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome (IRIS), that occurs in HIV-positive patients with initial low CD4 counts and an incontrollable viral load. At present, HAART alone may represent the first-line therapy for T0 and T1 slowly progressive disease. HAART with concomitant chemotherapy is indicated for visceral and/or rapidly progressive disease, whereas HAART after systemic chemotherapy may be effective as anti-KS therapy after debunking chemotherapy (ORR 91%).110., 111.\n",

This therapy may be an effective strategy for patients with epidemic KS that progressed despite chemotherapy and/or HAART. Irinotecan (CPT-11), a semisynthetic camptothecin derivative converted by decarboxylation into a biologically active form SN-38 (7-ethyl-10-hydroxycamptothecin), belongs to a recently established class of anticancer agents with a cytotoxic mechanism targeting the cellular enzyme DNA topoisomerase I. The model of fibroblast growth factor-\u03b2\u2013induced angiogenesis in mouse cornea suggests that irinotecan may be active also in KS. Data from a GICAT (Gruppo Italiano Cooperativo AIDS e Tumori) Phase II study show that intravenous CPT-11 (150 mg/m2 day 1; 10 mg/m2 every 21 days) plus HAART including protease inhibitors is active and well tolerated in HIV-infected patients with KS relapse or progression during HAART.113\n",

The ORR is 41%, with median duration of response of 52 weeks.114 Thalidomide (100 mg/day for 12 months) has been shown to block TNF-\u03b1 production and to inhibit basement membrane formation and intercellular adhesion molecules. The inhibition of vascular endothelial cell proliferation induced by thalidomide occurs in association with a marked decrease in the activity of the transcription factor SP1, which is involved in the extracellular matrix gene expression and moderate inhibition of nuclear factor-\u03baB activation in nuclear extracts.115 IL-12, a cytochine that enhances type 1 immunity, can down-regulate a constitutively active G protei-coupled receptor that is encoded by HHV-8.
