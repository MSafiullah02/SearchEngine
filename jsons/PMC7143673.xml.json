This may require activation of plans for military intervention to protect emergency departments and pharmacies. This was seen recently during the Ebola epidemic in West Africa, and the Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) outbreak. In one area over 80% of MERS cases were coming from within the hospitals. By triaging patients in temporary buildings in the car parks and preventing them from reaching the hospitals unprotected, cross-infection dropped to zero in 1 month.",

Often directed by anaesthesia rather than going to the operating room, MDCT scanning can give precise information on multiple injuries including bleeding and nerve damage in under 90 seconds (head to knees). Furthermore the use of angiographic endovascular haemorrhage control is now possible and easier to do in radiology than an operating room. Focussed assessment with sonography for trauma (FAST) scanning may identify bleeding on arrival which directs the patient straight to the operating room.",

During retrieval and initial assessment administration of blood, blood products and tranexamic acid amongst other things can be used empirically in certain scenarios. Blood bank resources need to be considered and diverted appropriately. Much has been learnt from the military medical emergency response teams in this regard. The overall approach to acute clinical management is covered in more detail in Trauma resuscitation and the damage control approach on pages 430\u2013436 of this issue.",

One key CCN function is to enable units to work together in the face of a major incident that would overwhelm local ICU resources. Incidents such as H1N1 flu were planned for and managed with some disruption to elective work but no compromise of care. Systems to flex bed usage locally (sometimes called surge planning) such as ventilation of patients in recovery are also useful planning activities. Typically, a CCN expectation would be to double critical care capacity during a major incident if required.",
