Most patients with these illnesses are treated with long-term immunomodulatory therapy to prevent acute relapses and disability. Our review is driven on the premise that most people with autoimmune neurological disorders are on immunomodulatory treatments, some of which may predispose to infections. We currently do not know whether people with autoimmune demyelinating neurological disorders are at an increased risk of acquiring COVID-19 infection; whether the disease has different severity and whether COVID-19 modifies the clinical behaviour of these disorders. We also lack any current understanding on how the use of ongoing treatments for autoimmune demyelinating neurological disorders modifies the risk and manifestations of COVID-19 infection episodes. We therefore intend to address the following concerns: (1) Is it safe to continue ongoing treatments/start treatment for the underlying neurological disorders during and after COVID-19 infection episodes? (2) Do people with CNS autoimmune demyelinating disorders need to follow usual or special precautions during the COVID epidemic? and (3) What is the influence of the coexisting conditions in the decision-making? Answers to these are not known succinctly, but an indirect application and corroboration of current understanding may provide us with steps to optimise patient care during the current global crisis.",

Medications influence lymphocyte levels variably and by different mechanisms.[8] Although data from previous studies have suggested that lymphopenia may not necessarily correlate with increased risk of infection,[9] it becomes imperative to monitor patients during this time and choose medications with lowest cytopenic potential for newly diagnosed cases. Cytokine overactivity also occurs in patients with COVID-19 infection,[10] leading to a potential discussion on experimental therapies with immunomodulatory agents.[11] How this would potentially affect a patient with a known CNS demyelinating disorder is currently not understood.",

Disease exacerbation will require optimum adjudication, severity judgement, risk related to the underlying disease and appropriate discussion with the patient regarding various treatment options.It is important to differentiate a relapse from any fluctuation and pseudorelapse.It is advised to screen a patient for symptoms of active COVID-19 infection before starting steroids.[20]For patients with MS, based on severity of the relapse, the neurologist may take a decision on observation or treatment with steroids during this pandemic. For symptoms that are very mild, more subjective, with negligible objective findings and disability, observation over the next 48-72 hours may be considered. For worsening symptoms, or a moderate to severe relapse, it may be prudent to start immediate acute immunomodulation. The drug of choice for relapse treatment is pulse intravenous methylprednisolone in usual doses,[3940] although other potential choices in the current situation could include intravenous immunoglobulin therapy or plasmapheresis, albeit with issues of cost, feasibility, low evidence and probably uncertain efficacy.[39404142]For patients of NMOSD, MOG disease and related disorders, a relapse may suggest more severe disease behaviour and risk of disability. Therefore, it is prudent to start acute treatment. As mentioned above, steroids remain the mainstay of treatment but since plasmapharesis has a significant role in NMOSD relapses and probably in MOG related disease too and is generally considered in patients with severe relapses as an early add on or sometimes a primary therapy to reduce disability, it remains a potentially effective alternative in this situation.[4144454647] However, invasive nature of this treatment and its potential risks, availability and feasibility in the current situation should be borne in mind. IVIG remains an alternative option in this scenario.[4547484950]\n",

We know little about the effects of this novel CoV on various body systems and its behaviour among patients with a variety of underlying medical and neurological conditions, especially those on immunomodulatory medications.The aim of the present document is to appraise the potential concerns when managing our patients with underlying CNS autoimmune demyelinating disorders during the current COVID-19 pandemic.The statement shall cover Multiple Sclerosis (MS), Neuromyelitis Optica Spectrum disorders (NMOSD), Myelin Oligodendrocyte Glycoprotein (MOG) antibody associated disease and other related disorders.The advisory is based on our current knowledge of the medications and known risks of immunosuppression. It is unclear at this juncture whether disease modifying therapies (DMT) for MS and immunosuppressants (IS) prescribed for MS and related disorders including NMOSD and MOG antibody associated disease have a potential risk of increasing the likelihood of COVID- 19 infection and its related complications. This consensus statement can be used to guide decisions on balancing the risk of infection with the risks of both starting and stopping immunomodulatory therapy. In the absence of evidence-based data specifically for COVID 19 and these disorders, this review comprises the consensus opinion of experts rather than a systematic elaboration of evidence-based guidelines.The statement is written specifically from the perspective of ongoing COVID 19 pandemic and is not intended to be a generic guideline to manage patients with these disorders.The treating neurologist should individualize the decision-making in consultation with an infectious disease specialist and after discussion with the patient and his family members.It is prudent to screen a patient for symptoms of active COVID-19 infection before starting any immunomodulatory therapy.The opinion and advisory may vary across different countries.\n",
