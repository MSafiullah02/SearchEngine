As the awareness about the ailment increased, so did messages, videos and posts acknowledging its presence. The social networking site, Twitter, demonstrated similar effect with the number of posts related to coronavirus showing an unprecedented growth in a very short span of time. This paper presents a statistical analysis of the twitter messages related to this disease posted since January 2020. Two types of empirical studies have been performed. The first is on word frequency and the second on sentiments of the individual tweet messages. Inspection of the word frequency is useful in characterizing the patterns or trends in the words used on the site. This would also reflect on the psychology of the twitter users at this critical juncture. Unigram, bigram and trigram frequencies have been modeled by power law distribution. The results have been validated by Sum of Square Error (SSE), R 2 and Root Mean Square Error (RMSE). High values of R 2 and low values of SSE and RMSE lay the grounds for the goodness of fit of this model. Sentiment analysis has been conducted to understand the general attitudes of the twitter users at this time. Both tweets by general public and WHO were part of the corpus. The results showed that the majority of the tweets had a positive polarity and only about 15% were negative.",

Determining word frequencies in any document gives a strong idea about the patterns of word used and the sentimental content of the text. The analysis can be carried out in computational as well as statistical settings. An investigation of the probability distribution of word frequencies extracted from the Twitter text messages posted by different users during the coronavirus outbreak in 2020 has been presented. Power law has been shown to capture patterns in the text analysis [1, 2] . Sentiment analysis is a technique to gauge the sentimental content of a writing. It can help understand attitudes in a text related to a particular subject. Sentiment analysis is a highly intriguing field of research that can assist in inferring the emotional content of a text. Sentiment analysis has been performed on two datasets, one pertaining to tweets by World Health Organization (WHO) and the other tweets with 1000 retweets. The sentimental quotient from the tweets has been deduced by computing the positive and negative polarities from the messages.",

A substantially significant approach among these is inferring the pattern of frequency distributions of the words in the text [3] . Zipf's law is mostly immanent in word frequency distributions [4, 5] . The law essentially proclaims that for the words' vector x, the word frequency distribution \u03bd varies as an inverse power of x. Some other distributions that are prevalent include Zipf-Mandelbrot [6] , lognormal [7, 8] , and Gauss-Poisson [7] . Such studies have been conducted for several languages such as Chinese [9] , Japanese [10] , Hindi [11] and many others [3] . Not only single word frequencies, but also multi-word frequencies have been exhaustively explored. One of the examples is [12] wherein bigram and trigram frequencies and versatilities were analyzed and 577 different bigrams and 6,140 different trigrams were reported.",

The key intent of sentiment analysis is to gauge opinions, identify hidden sentiments and finally to classify their polarity into positive, negative or neutral. Sentiment analysis has been immensely used in customer reviews [19] , news and [20] , and stock market [21] to name a few. Several methods have been deployed for sentiment analysis including Support Vector Machines [22] , Naive Bayes [23] , and Artificial Neural Networks [24] .

Fig. 7 corresponds to the histogram of sentiment polarities of tweets on Coronavirus by WHO. It can be seen that majority of the tweets have a neutral and positive sentiment.

Fig. 8 and 9 represent the histograms produced by removing the neutral tweets. It readily reiterates that the positive emotions in the tweets are higher than negative ones. This is a great sign that indicates that the humans are still focusing more on the positive and sharing the same light through their messages. ",

The spread of the disease has created an environment of threat, risks and uncertainty among the population globally. This response can be gauged from the immensely high number of tweet messages corresponding to the outbreak in a short duration of 2-3 months. In the present work, data related to tweets made since January 2020 have been analyzed with two major perspectives: one understanding the word frequency pattern and the second sentiment analysis. The study has resulted in the following observations. The number of twitter ids tweeting about Coronavius has increased rapidly with several peaks during February and March. An empirical analysis of words in the messages was made by determining their frequencies of occurrence. The most frequent words were Coronavirus, Covid19 and Wuhan. Unigram, bigram and trigram frequencies (the top 1000) were modeled. It was seen that all of them followed the rightly skewed power law distribution with quite heavy tails in the first two cases. The exponential parameters for the same were determined to be -1.273 for unigram, -1.375 for bigram and -0.5266 for trigram. The plots for the same have been depicted. The goodness of fit for the model was determined using SSE, R 2 and RMSE. The results were found to be satisfactorily good. The model can be used to determine the pattern of the words used during this time. The sentiment analysis was performed on tweet messages by general public and WHO. The polarities of the individual messages were determined and a histogram of the same was plotted. It could be observed that most of the messages belonged to the neutral and positive categories. With WHO messages, 60% of the messages were found to be positive and with general messages, 29% were found to be positive and 54% neutral. In both the cases, just about 15% messages were of negative sentiment. The results obtained are a great reflection of the sentiments expressed worldwide during this pandemic. ",
