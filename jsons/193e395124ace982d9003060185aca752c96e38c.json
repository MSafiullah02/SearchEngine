Only human research studies (no editorials, commentaries, narrative reviews were included) where the focus of the study was an attempt to improve BLS/ALS skills (or related skills such as airway management / trauma management) through the use of a simulation technique that sought to enhance the realism of the training process. The underlying premise is that a \"highfidelity simulation experience allows the participants to suspend disbelief and perform in a manner that more closely reflects the way they would act in caring for a real patient in a comparable situation.\" 1,p139 Moreover there is a belief (and some evidence) that repetitive performance of specific skills, coupled with assessment and feedback, will lead to acquisition of expertise in medicine. 2 The use of high-fidelity simulation in medicine has been suggested as a useful teaching method for clinical situations that, although infrequent, are critical in nature and require the maintenance of a high level of skill and preparedness. 1,p142 Cardiac arrest clearly fits this description.",

            "text": "The papers included in this worksheet highlight that the field is plagued by inconsistent definitions -beginning with what the term 'high-fidelity simulation' actually means. Moreover there is overwhelming variation in a) the type of intervention under test, including: computerized interactive videodisk (Fabius,1994,p262); screen-based simulation (Tan,2008,p565); high-fidelity human patient simulators (Wayne,2005,p210), and b) the intensity of the 'intervention' used, which ranged from a 30min 'one off' simulation session (Cavaleiro,2009,636) , to 10-hours of simulator practice sessions (Wayne,2005,210) to a 3-day course (Dunning,2006 (Dunning, ,1767 . Similarly the 'control' group varies from comparisons with low-fidelity simulation (rare), didactic lectures, reading materials alone or simply 'no-training'. Given the clinical and methodological heterogeneity of the studies, meta-analysis would be problematic, and as such summarization of the literature is restricted to descriptive methods. As asserted in a recent paper by Donoghue(2009) , \"as simulation research in resuscitation continues to expand, it will be necessary to design and validate instruments to measure team and individual performances to be used as reproducible outcomes of interest for future studies.\" 1,p142 The outcomes of interest for the 30 studies were categorized as follows: E1=Skills performance on a manikin (n=24); E2=Skills performance in real arrests (n=4); E3=Patient survival after arrest (n=1); E4=Knowledge (n=13); and E5=other (n=7). (Note total numbers add to more than N=36, since 53% of the studies had more than one of the outcomes of interest reported.) In addition many studies reported participant satisfaction with the simulation technique, with most reporting good to excellence evaluations. The 'Other outcome' category also includes self-assessed confidence in performing the respective resuscitative procedure. Most studies showed an increase in confidence after the simulation intervention. However, it has been established that student self-reported confidence in resuscitation skills does not necessarily correspond to competence. 2 Of the 36 studies included in the evidence evaluation, 22 (61%) of studies reported at least one 'positive' outcome. Nonetheless, given the number of 'neutral' studies, the evidence for the efficacy of more realistic ('high-fidelity') techniques in resuscitation training remains equivocal. Notwithstanding this, it is generally well accepted by students and has a persuasive pedagogy underpinning it. The simulation literature is fraught with heterogeneity and as such the future challenge is to improve the standard and comparability of research studies in the field. The null hypothesis under test was that there was no effect of high fidelity versus lower fidelity technology used during training on student learning outcomes. All participants had a 'pre-training' assessment on entering the study, the same total duration of teaching and then a 'post-training' (exit) assessment. Assessors blind to group allocation; Post-training assessment scheduled for 3-weeks after last training session. Group 3 showed significantly higher scores (p = 0.047) in the VT-post scenario and performed significantly better than the other groups in the ANAphylaxis scenario (p = 0.012)which was a 'new challenge'. No difference between the performance of Groups 1 and 2 so the authors conclude that using a whole body manikin is not necessarily better than a smaller, simpler part-task trainer. . ",

All students received the standard trauma undergraduate curriculum consisting of seminars, lectures, and case discussions on trauma topics. site NRP training (using non-intrumental mannikin) and certification. 4-months later 60 3rd year medical students (Newfoundland, Canada) were randomised to either (Exp) the \"ANAKIN\" system -which encompasses a manikin simulator that is integrated with a computer-based assessment program and videoconferencing technology or (Crl) viewing a NRP training video -then both groups re-assessed at 8-months post NRP. NO explanation of statistical analysis in the Methods Section and only within group results detailed. The main purpose of this study was to evaluate the effectiveness of the ANAKIN system as a means for updating and assessing the neonatal resuscitation skills of neonatal resuscitation providers. Outcome Measures: NRP megacode performance Checklist-131 items= measured initially (post NRP) and at 8-months; Knowledge: 27 item MCQ; Self-rated confidence scale -15 items rated 1-5; Satisfaction scale -20 items rated 1-5. Results: Experimental study group did score higher than the control group on Performance Score 2 -but the diff was not significant; Knowledge deteriorated at 4-months and not improved with either 'booster' intervention; students positive about using the ANAKIN system. Confidence scores initially increased (in both groups) from immediately before to immediately after the booster intervention (at 4-months) -but deteriorated by 8 months. No relationship between knowledge and performance scores, not between confidence and performance. Conclusion: Neither the ANAKIN nor the video were effective in maintaining the skill level of the students to the level that they had achieved immediately following the initial NRP course. .Donoghue, AJ, Durbin, DR, Nadel, FM, et al.

Randomisation within study site and PG level using block-randomisation to high-fidelity (SIM) or standard mannequin groups (MAN). Unblinded RCT. All sessions at all 3 sites were conducted by the same investigator. All 3 phases of the intervention, ie PRE-didactic session-POST, were completed within 90minutes. The only difference between the groups was the 'fidelity' of the manikin used. All sessions were videorecorded by 2 simultaneous webcam feeds, one of which was synchronized to the simulator event log and debriefing software (SimBaby Debrief Viewer, Laerdal). A scoring instrument was designed by investigator consensus that granted a maximum score of 2 points for each critical task. Points could be deducted if tasks were done incorrectly, in the wrong sequence, or after an unacceptable amount of time had elapsed. No significant differences in baseline resuscitation, procedural, or mock code experience between SIM and MAN groups. The PRE phase scores were similar for both groups. The POST phase scores were higher in the SIM group compared with the MAN group, but not statistically sig. The improvement in scores between PRE and POST phases was significantly greater in the SIM group (11.1[1.8]  vs. 4.7[1.7], P = 0.007).

Outcome=Time to successful definitive treament based on (blinded) assessment of videotaped performance in patient scenarios. Four precourse and 4 postcourse cardiac arrest scenarios (VF or asystole) conducted. \"Despite the small numbers of scenarios conducted, there was a highly significant difference between the two groups in the time taken to reach all significant objectives after cardiopulmonary resuscitation had been initiated\" (Time to CPR not sig diff, p=0.114). \"Times to successful chest reopening and internal cardiac massage were also significantly improved in cardiac arrest patients: (451 secs [SD 39 secs] precourse and 228 secs [SD 17 secs] postcourse; p = 0.011).\" Limitation: No control group -so improvements could have been seen even if lower-fidelity intervention used -given that the intensive nature of the course (3 days). as effective as students trained on human subjects. The results failed to show a significant learning curve, because the success rates were consistent throughout the 15 intubation attempts. This suggests that both simulator and OR training led to sufficient acquisition of ETI skills before OR testing.Limitations: assessors not blinded to training method. Very few paediatric patients. Translation of skills to prehospital environment not tested -however one assumes that students would be more familiar with the prehospital environment than the OR.

No sig diff between HFS and LFS in terms of demographic characteristics, work experience or pre-course knowledge. Intervention: For students participating in the LFS course, the AHA instructors provided all the information required to resuscitate the manikin: vital signs, heart tones, breath sounds, and a description of the patient's overall condition. Students participating in the HFS course gathered all the same assessment data, but this information came from theIglesias-Vazquez, JA, Rodriguez-Nunez, A, Penas-Penas, M, et al.

The intervention was only one-hour duration -this is possibly not sufficient to effect a significant difference in outcome. There was no difference in the overall mean performance score for the anaphylaxis scenario but students in the screenbased simulation scored more highly in the sub-scale relating to 'specific treatment'. The authors claim that this reflects superiority of screen-based teaching for clinical skill teaching -however this is possibly over-interpreting the results. .Wang, XP, Martin, SM, Li, YL, et al.

Wayne, DB, Butter, J, Siddall, VJ, et al. (2005). \"Simulation-based training of internal medicine residents in advanced cardiac life support protocols: a randomized trial.\" Teaching & Learning in Medicine 17(3): 210-6. from paper): A randomised crossover trial of 38 2ndyear residents (single academic medical centre USA) who were randomly allocated to either receive the intervention (Group A) or serve as wait-list controls (Group B). Both groups underwent baseline testing after randomization. The intervention group then received four 2-hour simulator practice sessions (using a 'high-fidelity' Human Patient Simulator) while the wait-list control group received no intervention (i.e., performed normal clinical duties). After a second round of testing 3 months later, the control group crossed over and received the educational intervention while the intervention group returned to routine duties. A third round of standardized clinical skills testing was then conducted after 3 months for both groups. Teaching sessions gave groups of two to four residents time to practice protocols and procedures and to receive structured education from simulator faculty. Debriefing allowed the residents to ask questions, review algorithms, and receive feedback. Primary outcome measures were checklist scores -scores were computed as percent correct for each of the simulations and summed across the three simulations randomly assigned to each resident. The total scores thus ranged from 0 to 300. A secondary outcome measure was a course assessment survey completed at the end of the 10-month study period.Results (from paper): The figure shows that at baseline, the total ACLS checklist scores for Group A and Group B did not differ significantly. However, after the first educational intervention, the total ACLS checklist performance for Group A (M = 265.6, SD = 9.5) was 38% higher than the total score for the wait-list control Group B (M = 192.5, SD = 35.9), a highly significant difference, t(36) = -8.58, p < .0001.Following crossover, the second educational intervention, and the third round of simulation-based testing, the total ACLS checklist scores for Group A (M= 256.15, SD = 20.28) and Group B (M= 268.98, SD = 12.63) were very similar yet significantly different on statistical grounds, (t(36) = 2.34, p < .05).Postcourse questionnaire responses were uniformly high and positive endorsing(1)(2)(3)(4)(5) Likert scale M and SD) such statements as \"Practice with the medical simulator boosts my clinical skill\" (4.82, 0.69); \"Repetitive practice using the medical simulator is a valuable educational experience\" (4.55, 0.76); and \"The medical simulator has helped prepare me to be a code leader better than the ACLS course I took\"(4.79, 0.70). Reviewer Conclusion: Simulator training significantly improved performance in ACLS skills -as assessed on a manikin (same manikin as training was undertaken) -however it is possible that similar results could have been achieved using a lower-fidelity manikin. .Wayne, DB, Butter, J, Siddall, VJ, et al. (2006b). \"Mastery learning of advanced cardiac life support skills by internal medicine residents using simulation technology and deliberate practice.\" Journal of General Internal Medicine 21(3): 251-6. Builds on the work reported in the Wayne(2005) RCT and Wayne(2006a) follow-up study -but ? a different cohort of medical registrars at the same medical centre. Methods (from the paper): First, all residents underwent baseline pretesting on a random sample of 3 of 6 ACLS scenarios. Second, the residents received a minimum of 4, 2-hour education sessions with deliberate practice of ACLS events and procedures using a medical high-fidelity simulator. Results (from the paper):The pretest to posttest contrasts in overall ACLS performance represents a 24% improvement, a highly significant difference (P<.0001). The need for additional deliberate practice for those who failed to reach the overall mastery standard on the posttest was a powerful negative predictor of posttest performance. Medical knowledge, measured by USMLE Step 1 and 2 scores, had no correlation with ACLS skill posttest results -nor did pretest skill performance also had no correlation Comment (from paper): A key question about this and other simulation-based studies is whether performance in a highly controlled simulator environment will generalize to variable clinical practice settings. This is especially the case for critical yet infrequent clinical events like in-hospital ACLS events. .Wayne, DB, Didwania, A, Feinglass, J, et al.

The hypothesis under test is that there is no association between adherence to AHA standards during cardiac arrests and prior ACLS simulator-training. Limitations: Single centre. Retrospective study design -Multivariate analysis allowed for adjustment for some potential confounders but it is possible that other non-measured factors could be confounding the apparent relationship between simulator-training and adherence to AHA guidelines. Inter-rater reliability established -but still possible that there could have been omissions or errors in chart abstraction. No significant difference in the outcome of the arrests ie immediate event survival or survival to hospital discharge. Wayne, DB, Siddall, VJ,Butter, J, et al. (2006a). \"A longitudinal study of internal medicine residents' retention of advanced cardiac life support skills.\" Academic Medicine 81(10 Suppl): S9-S12. Longitudinal follow-up study of ACLS skills retention in PGY-2 medical residents who had participated in the earlier Wayne,2005 RCT crossover study involving a high-fidelity simulation based educational intervention. Results (from paper): Mean checklist scores were very stable from baseline (RCT outcome) to follow-up one (6 months) to follow-up two (14 months). ANOVA showed no statistically significant difference in residents' ACLS performance across the three testing occasions (p > 0.5) Conclusion (Reviewer): The lack of ACLS skills decay in this cohort of junior medical residents contrasts with many other studies that have shown rapid ACLS skills decay without re-training. The findings are supportive of the assertion of the authors that their \"educational intervention in ACLS skills using deliberate practice and small group teaching that maintains a high level of performance\". Limitations of the study include: small sample size (n=38), no comparison group, single centre, possibility of selection bias in the recruitment of residents to the initial RCT.",
