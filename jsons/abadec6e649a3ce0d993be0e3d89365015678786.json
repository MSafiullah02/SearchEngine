Several HERV genes have been detected as transcripts and proteins in the central nervous system, frequently in the context of neuroinflammation. The HERV-W family has received substantial attention in large part because of associations with diverse syndromes including multiple sclerosis (MS) and several psychiatric disorders. A HERV-W-related retroelement, multiple sclerosis retrovirus (MSRV), has been reported in MS patients to be both a biomarker as well as an effector of aberrant immune responses. HERV-H and HERV-K have also been implicated in MS and other neurological diseases but await delineation of their contributions to disease. The HERV-W envelope-encoded glycosylated protein, syncytin-1, is encoded by chromosome 7q21 and exhibits increased glial expression within MS lesions. Overexpression of syncytin-1 in glia induces endoplasmic reticulum stress leading to neuroinflammation and the induction of free radicals, which damage proximate cells. Syncytin-1's receptor, ASCT1 is a neutral amino acid transporter expressed on glia and is suppressed in white matter of MS patients. Of interest, antioxidants ameliorate syncytin-1's neuropathogenic effects raising the possibility of using these agents as therapeutics for neuroinflammatory diseases. Given the multiple insertion sites of HERV genes as complete and incomplete open reading frames, together with their differing capacity to be expressed and the complexities of individual HERVs as both disease markers and bioactive effectors, HERV biology is a compelling area for understanding neuropathogenic mechanisms and developing new therapeutic strategies.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Abstract"}], "body_text": [{"text": "Multiple sclerosis (MS) is the prototypic neuroimmune disease, defined by neuroinflammation within the central nervous system (CNS) accompanied by demyelination and axonal disruption [1] .

The recent application of rigorous criteria for the diagnosis of MS has refined the inclusion criteria for clinical trials, which may improve the trial outcomes [8] . The neuropathological changes accompanying MS are diverse and have been characterized into four different subtypes [9] . Demyelination and inflammation are the cardinal features of MS and involve the CNS at all levels. Accompanying inflammation and demyelination in MS, is the rediscovery of axonal and neuronal perikaryal injury [10] . Lesions in relapsing-remitting MS patients are usually found in white matter and are characterized by disruption of the blood-brain barrier (BBB), local edema and demyelination, typical of inflammatory processes [11] . Conversely, in primary-progressive MS, inflammatory processes are less predominant but progression to disability and brain atrophy may evolve faster [12] . Interest in the mechanisms by which demyelination and inflammation-related damage to axons and neurons occur [13] has been complemented by neuroimaging studies that suggest that axonal injury accompanied by cerebral atrophy (loss of tissue) constitute a major mechanism by which physical disability progresses during MS [1, 14] .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 453, "end": 456, "text": "[7]", "ref_id": "BIBREF6"}, {"start": 620, "end": 623, "text": "[8]", "ref_id": "BIBREF7"}, {"start": 741, "end": 744, "text": "[9]", "ref_id": "BIBREF8"}, {"start": 956, "end": 960, "text": "[10]", "ref_id": "BIBREF9"}, {"start": 1175, "end": 1179, "text": "[11]", "ref_id": "BIBREF10"}, {"start": 1331, "end": 1335, "text": "[12]", "ref_id": "BIBREF11"}, {"start": 1447, "end": 1451, "text": "[13]", "ref_id": "BIBREF12"}, {"start": 1658, "end": 1661, "text": "[1,", "ref_id": "BIBREF0"}, {"start": 1662, "end": 1665, "text": "14]", "ref_id": "BIBREF13"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Clinical and neuropathological features of MS"}, {"text": "The role of immunopathogenesis as an etiologic determinant of MS is supported by the large-scale genetic studies showing linkages to multiple immune genes, especially to the MHC Class II loci on chromosome 6 [15, 16] and MS neuropathology, which implicates multiple cell types within the CNS together with immune activation [17] . The current dogma defining MS pathogenesis is that it is a T-celldriven autoimmune disorder, albeit with diverse phenotypes [1] . Nonetheless, MS clinical and neuropathological phenotypes are highly variable depending on the population and geographic domain. Much of the understanding of MS immunopathogenesis has been influenced by the use of different animal models, especially experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) [18] . Both innate and adaptive immune mechanisms have been shown to participate in the immunopathogenesis of MS [19] although adaptive immunity may predominate early in disease, reflected by selective T and B cell activation accompanying clinical relapses. Multiple groups have demonstrated that enhanced MHC class II expression on myeloid cells and accompanying innate immune activation are associated with damaged myelin and failure of re-myelination [20] . Th1-associated innate immunity is also activated throughout the different phases of disease, as indicated by persistently increased cytokine and chemokine production by macrophages, microglia and astrocytes [21] , even into the later or secondary progressive stages of disease [22] . Indeed, modulation/polarization of macrophages by disease-modifying therapies may be an important mechanism by which these compounds exert their therapeutic effects [23] . The mechanisms underlying demyelination and axonal damage remain uncertain although inflammatory molecules including cytokines, chemokines, prostaglandins, reactive oxygen species and matrix metalloproteinases have been demonstrated to contribute to demyelination and axonal/ neuronal injury associated with MS [14, 24, 25] . The molecules mentioned above represent a complex cascade of signaling events that originate with activation of lymphocytes, macrophages and astrocytes [17] . Activation of these latter cell types results in the release of soluble intercellular signaling molecules that subsequently either feedback on the activated cells or alternatively, induces cellular changes, usually through receptor-mediated mechanisms to cause damage to myelin, oligodendrocytes, axons and perhaps neuronal cell bodies [13, 26, 27] . Given the substantial role of innate immune mechanisms in MS and the burgeoning recognition of its involvement in prototypic neurodegeneration (e.g., Alzheimer's disease, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis), the contribution of primary neurodegenerative mechanisms (oxidative stress, excitotoxicity, endoplasmic reticulum stress, apoptosis and other programmed cell death pathways) to the development of MS-associated neurological disability has gained greater importance in recent studies of MS pathogenesis [28] . Indeed, the modest clinical benefits of immunosuppressive and immunomodulatory therapies have prompted investigators to reexamine potential pathogenic mechanisms in MS with an increased focus on regulation on neurodegenerative disease mechanisms [29] .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 208, "end": 212, "text": "[15,", "ref_id": "BIBREF14"}, {"start": 213, "end": 216, "text": "16]", "ref_id": "BIBREF15"}, {"start": 324, "end": 328, "text": "[17]", "ref_id": "BIBREF16"}, {"start": 455, "end": 458, "text": "[1]", "ref_id": "BIBREF0"}, {"start": 759, "end": 763, "text": "[18]", "ref_id": "BIBREF17"}, {"start": 872, "end": 876, "text": "[19]", "ref_id": "BIBREF18"}, {"start": 1213, "end": 1217, "text": "[20]", "ref_id": "BIBREF19"}, {"start": 1427, "end": 1431, "text": "[21]", "ref_id": "BIBREF20"}, {"start": 1497, "end": 1501, "text": "[22]", "ref_id": "BIBREF21"}, {"start": 1669, "end": 1673, "text": "[23]", "ref_id": "BIBREF22"}, {"start": 1987, "end": 1991, "text": "[14,", "ref_id": "BIBREF13"}, {"start": 1992, "end": 1995, "text": "24,", "ref_id": "BIBREF23"}, {"start": 1996, "end": 1999, "text": "25]", "ref_id": "BIBREF24"}, {"start": 2154, "end": 2158, "text": "[17]", "ref_id": "BIBREF16"}, {"start": 2497, "end": 2501, "text": "[13,", "ref_id": "BIBREF12"}, {"start": 2502, "end": 2505, "text": "26,", "ref_id": "BIBREF25"}, {"start": 2506, "end": 2509, "text": "27]", "ref_id": "BIBREF26"}, {"start": 3016, "end": 3020, "text": "[28]", "ref_id": "BIBREF27"}, {"start": 3269, "end": 3273, "text": "[29]", "ref_id": "BIBREF28"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "MS pathogenesis"}, {"text": "Environmental factors including infectious agents, lifestyle (tobacco smoking) and nutritional (vitamin D depletion, dairy products) factors might contribute to MS development and progression [30] . There is remarkable diversity in the evidence that indicates MS is caused by conventional exogenous infectious agents (herpes viruses, coronaviruses, Chlamydial infections, etc.) and in fact, the data are highly controversial in this area (reviewed in [30, 31] ). There is also abundant evidence to support the hypothesis that genetics has a pivotal role in an individual's susceptibility to MS, perhaps in conjunction with triggering factors such as viruses. Although MS is not inherited in a Mendelian fashion, concordance rates of 26% in homozygotic twins (3% in dizygotic twins) are typically seen, suggesting substantial discordance (~70%) [32] . Nonetheless, family members of MS patients inherit a higher risk of developing MS, arguing for a genetic predisposition to this disease [33] . There is a strong genetic association between MS in Caucasians with the HLA class II DRB1*1501 allele, which is in linkage disequilibrium with DRB5*0101. The latter allele might confer MS risk by selecting for autoreactive CD4 + T cells, while the former is suppressed in EAE by deleting autoreactive T cells in mice transgenic for both the alleles [34] . To date no specific genomic locus has been linked definitively to MS onset or progression although several chromosomal loci and multiple polymorphisms have been associated with MS [35] , particularly among genes associated with immune mechanisms.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 192, "end": 196, "text": "[30]", "ref_id": "BIBREF29"}, {"start": 451, "end": 455, "text": "[30,", "ref_id": "BIBREF29"}, {"start": 456, "end": 459, "text": "31]", "ref_id": "BIBREF30"}, {"start": 844, "end": 848, "text": "[32]", "ref_id": "BIBREF31"}, {"start": 987, "end": 991, "text": "[33]", "ref_id": "BIBREF32"}, {"start": 1343, "end": 1347, "text": "[34]", "ref_id": "BIBREF33"}, {"start": 1530, "end": 1534, "text": "[35]", "ref_id": "BIBREF34"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "MS pathogenesis"}, {"text": "Two principal hypotheses link MS and infection: the \"prevalence hypothesis\" states that the causative agent is more common in high risk areas, whereas the \"polio hypothesis\" and by extension, the \"hygiene hypothesis\" suggests that early infection induces protective autoimmunity and delayed infection increases the risk of disease [36] . Thus, several infections in early life might protect against the development of MS, which could explain why MS is rare in developing countries or lower socioeconomic groups [37] . Although various infectious agents are linked to MS, their presence may simply provide an appropriate environmental trigger for development of an autoimmune response directed against CNS antigens [38] . Application of sophisticated biochemical and molecular tools has led to identification of several viruses that exhibit an association with MS, albeit no pathogen has been accepted as the causal agent of MS. Studies related to virus infections in MS are largely serological and demonstrated by antibody titers against a particular virus, although it has not been elucidated whether these antibodies are elevated in response to the etiological agent, or through molecular mimicry [39] . Infections contributing to increased MS clinical activity of supposedly viral origin occur in the upper-respiratory tract, are self-limiting and mild, but might include pathogens such as Chlamydia pneumoniae and Mycoplasma pneumoniae [40] . Among viruses, epidemiological studies favor Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) while neuropathological studies support HHV-6, HERVs and perhaps coronaviruses [37] . EBV serology correlates with the distribution and onset of MS. While most adults have been infected with EBV, a proportion of children are EBV seronegative [37] . Meta-analysis studies of EBV infections in MS suggest that there is a role for EBV, particularly with a higher number of patients showing antibodies to EBV nuclear antigen than EBV seropositive controls but whether the oligoclonal IgG from MS brain and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) is specific to EBV remains unknown [41] . A large Danish study reported that MS risk increases soon after infectious mononucleosis and persists for at least 30 years and there is a confirmed association between EBV infection in children and MS [37] . Although HHV6 and EBV are ubiquitous viruses, seroconversion happens usually before or during puberty into adult life, matching epidemiological evidence for time of exposure to the infectious agent causing MS [41] . Oligoclonal antibodies in CSF of some MS patients were determined to target the EBV-encoded proteins BRRF2 and EBNA-1 [42] . Further, EBV was found to infect B cells, and plasma cells and in brains of MS where viral latent proteins were expressed [43] . A T-cell-mediated immune response to EBV-infected cells leads to damage of neurons and oligodendrocytes as a result of bystander activation [37] . Due to the complex immunophenotype of MS, the immune response to human herpes virus (HHV)-6 has been difficult to predict; concentrations of serum IgG to HHV-6 were higher in RR-MS than CP-MS while HHV-6 DNA was often detected during relapse in 15% of MS patients showing presence of viral DNA. Several cells, including oligodendrocytes in MS brains showed the presence of HHV-6 antigen or genome, but not exclusively associated with MS. Of interest, several retroviral infections exhibit clinical and neuropathological phenotypes that resemble MS including human T cell lymphotropic virus (HTLV)-1-associated myelopathy and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-associated leukoencephalopathy [44] . Unlike most conventional exogenous viruses, retroviruses are integrated into the host genome and continue to exert (auto)-immune effects for years after infection, often in the absence of substantial viral replication [45] .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 331, "end": 335, "text": "[36]", "ref_id": "BIBREF35"}, {"start": 511, "end": 515, "text": "[37]", "ref_id": "BIBREF36"}, {"start": 714, "end": 718, "text": "[38]", "ref_id": "BIBREF37"}, {"start": 1199, "end": 1203, "text": "[39]", "ref_id": "BIBREF38"}, {"start": 1440, "end": 1444, "text": "[40]", "ref_id": "BIBREF39"}, {"start": 1596, "end": 1600, "text": "[37]", "ref_id": "BIBREF36"}, {"start": 1759, "end": 1763, "text": "[37]", "ref_id": "BIBREF36"}, {"start": 2080, "end": 2084, "text": "[41]", "ref_id": "BIBREF40"}, {"start": 2289, "end": 2293, "text": "[37]", "ref_id": "BIBREF36"}, {"start": 2505, "end": 2509, "text": "[41]", "ref_id": "BIBREF40"}, {"start": 2630, "end": 2634, "text": "[42]", "ref_id": "BIBREF41"}, {"start": 2759, "end": 2763, "text": "[43]", "ref_id": "BIBREF42"}, {"start": 2906, "end": 2910, "text": "[37]", "ref_id": "BIBREF36"}, {"start": 3604, "end": 3608, "text": "[44]", "ref_id": "BIBREF43"}, {"start": 3829, "end": 3833, "text": "[45]", "ref_id": "BIBREF44"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "MS pathogenesis"}, {"text": "Retroviruses are RNA viruses defined by their expression of reverse transcriptase and best exemplified by the exogenous retroviruses, HIV-1/2, HTLV-I/II, murine leukemia virus (MuLV) and Visna-Maedi virus, an early animal (sheep) model for MS (Fig. 2) [46] .

All humans carry human endogenous retrovirus (HERV) sequences as an integral part of their genomes, comprising almost 8.29% of the human genome [49] and are likely vestiges of retroviral infections during evolution. At some point during evolution, exogenous (infectious) progenitors of HERVs inserted themselves into the cells of the germ line, where they have been replicated along with the host's cellular genes following a Mendelian pattern [4, 5] .

Comparison of sequences, particularly in the LTRs of certain HERV families, provides insight into the length of time a particular genetic sequence may have been present in the genome.

HERVs could play several roles in MS pathogenesis but the most plausible (and contemporary) explanation for the effects in MS is that they act predominantly as a host component of the pathogenic cascade of events underlying MS (Table 2) . A retroviral etiology for MS was postulated in the past when 70% of MS patients had cross-reactive antibodies to Human T lymphotropic virus (HTLV-1/2) and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) antigens [97] although subsequently disproved, underlining the danger of relying on serology for viral detection. Jocher and coworkers found no HTLV-1 sequences in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) or MS brain tissues [41] .

HERV-R (ERV-3), whose allele is homozygous in about 1% of the Caucasian population, exhibits polymorphisms including deletions in the envelope protein [99] .

Indeed, syncytin-1 overexpression in astrocytes resulted in cytokine and reactive oxygen species production with ensuing in vitro and in vivo oligodendrocyte injury. Importantly, given the abundance of syncytin-1 encoding RNA and protein in controls and MS patients and its inability to replicate despite the release of HERV-W genome and proteins from cells, it is unlikely to behave like a conventional exogenous retrovirus but rather serves as a modulator of disease.

Previous studies have shown, using degenerate PCR primers, that the MSRV pol is also upregulated in neuroinflammatory conditions [69] but its DNA copy number does not differ between MS and age-/sex-matched controls [105] . Indeed, the MSRV pol is also upregulated in other neurological disorders [72, 106] . It has been reported that MSRV is replication competent and behaves like an exogenous retrovirus, which has prompted substantial interest about MSRV [107] , especially with recent data generated using MSRV envelope-specific PCR primers that did not demonstrate up-regulation of MSRV in MS brains [108, 109] . It is now clear that there are multiple HERV-W members, which vary in their sequence and chromosomal loci. Recent work also indicates that among 7 individual HERV envelopes examined, only syncytin-1 is upregulated in MS brain [102, 108] , underscoring the specificity of perturbed syncytin-1 expression in MS but the specific syncytin-1 sequence (or encoding locus) predominating in the CNS remains unknown. Indeed, these findings were confirmed with quantitative PCR analyses wherein syncytin-1 RNA and proviral copy numbers were increased in brains of MS patients although we did not find differences in PBMCs, plasma or CSF from MS and non-MS patients [108] . Other human retroelements have also been posited to participate in MS pathogenesis but a full understanding of their pathogenic role(s) and underlying mechanisms remains to be defined [107] . HERVs potentially might act also as either genetic markers for polymorphisms related to MS, or as markers of environmental/ endogenous stress [110, 111] . Induction of HERV-H/RGH, HERV-W and ERV-9 expression was reported when specific cell types (chiefly B cells) from MS patients were cultivated in vitro [112] . Several studies suggest that specific HERVs that occur in few copies in the genome (e.g. ERV-3, HERV-R and HRES-1) may show polymorphic patterns in MS and might act as auto-, super-or neoantigens with the potential to enhance inflammatory responses or induce autoimmune reactions [110, 113] . RNA encoded by these HERVs has been detected by reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) with degenerate primers in sera/plasma and brain tissues from MS patients, although not exclusively from this patient group [107] .

Leptomeningeal cells (LM7) isolated from the CSF of MS patients, as well as monocytes and EBV-transformed B cells, yielded a novel retroelement that was subsequently identified and characterized as MSRV [104] . Along with a French group who discovered MSRV in MS patients, particles containing reverse transcriptase activity were also reported by a Danish group [58] . MSRV and HERV-H particles and RNA were found to be increased in MS patients relative to controls [32, 115, 116] . However, it is possible that several HERV loci contribute to and are activated in MS since patients exhibit heterogeneous sequences. A pan-retro RT-PCR that amplified a conserved pol sequence among all retroviruses was used [104] . Using MSRV probes obtained from virion-associated RNA, a novel HERV family was identified that is different from ERV9 and genetically related to MSRV sequences and was named HERV-W [57, 117] . There is substantial controversy as to whether MSRV is an endogenous or exogenous virus [118] . MSRV belongs to the ERV9 family of endogenous retroviruses (ERVs), and partial molecular characterization revealed that MSRV has 75% homology to ERV9 [104] . Recent evidence points to MSRV being transcribed from HERV-W loci on chromosomes 3q23, Xq22.3, 15q21.3 and recombinations between loci on chromosomes 3p12.3 and 18q21.32, Xq22.3 and 5p12 [100] .

It was also detected in blood from control groups without MS (6%) [118] , some bipolar disorder patients, 40% of other neurological diseases [120] and in synovial fluid from rheumatoid arthritis patients (22%) [121] . Using primers specific to ERV9/MSRV, although less sensitive than MSRV-specific primers [104] , a cohort of South African MS patients did not show the presence of MSRV, except for one pregnant individual [122] . This could be attributed to the degenerate primers used that might have amplified HERVs normally expressed highly in the placenta. Enhanced expression of MSRV in MS brains [120] and increased MSRV copy number in MS blood DNA [123] are associated with a poorer MS prognosis [124] . MSRV is also induced by inflammatory agents [125, 126] and might also induce a potent inflammatory response [127] . This is particularly evident when none of the MS patients treated with anti-inflammatory drugs showed detectable levels of MSRV [118] . Of particular interest was the finding that IFN-\u03b2 treatment reduced MSRV load in plasma and MS progression index among patients examined for a year [128] . It is also plausible that MSRV expression is activated in response to certain inflammatory products or infectious agents, particularly viruses (HSV-1, influenza virus). In fact the expression of MSRV was enhanced in the presence of HHV-6 in MS patients [90] . The pol and env genes of MSRV and their expressed proteins have also been shown to be involved in inflammatory responses [129] . Gliotoxins secreted from macrophages expressing MSRV also caused the death of oligodendrocytes, key cells involved in the myelination process [130] . This finding might suggest a direct inflammatory role for MSRV gene products. The pathogenicity of MSRV retroviral particles was evaluated in severe combined immunodeficiency (SCID) mice grafted with human lymphocytes and injected intraperitoneally with MSRV virion. MSRVinjected mice displayed cerebral hemorrhage and died within 5 to 10 days post injection. RT-PCR analyses showed circulating MSRV RNA in serum for mice, with overexpression of TNF-\u03b1 and IFN-\u03b3 in spleen [131] . This in vivo study implies that MSRV retroviral particles from MS cultures might have potent immunopathogenic properties mediated by T cells corroborating previously reported superantigen activity of HERVs in vitro, which appear to be mediated by overexpression of proinflammatory cytokines [132] . The pathogenesis of MSRV could also involve an innate immune response to the virus through toll-like receptors (TLRs), which was demonstrated by the stimulation of PBMCs with purified Env protein that resulted in the release of cytokines [127] . However, a subsequent study using a different approach could not demonstrate an immune response to MSRV [114] . In the latter study, a cohort of HLA-B7 + -matched MS (n = 24) and healthy controls (n =29) patients did not exhibit any cellular immune response to MSRV/HERV-W. Further, serum and CSF from MS (n = 50) and healthy controls (n = 29) did not exhibit antibodies against MSRV/HERV-W [114] . Several possible reasons might explain this phenomenon, including a lack of antigens in the cohort studied, insufficiently sensitive methodology or lack of an immune response to the antigen [114] .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 111, "end": 116, "text": "[118]", "ref_id": "BIBREF117"}, {"start": 137, "end": 142, "text": "[119]", "ref_id": "BIBREF118"}, {"start": 211, "end": 216, "text": "[118]", "ref_id": "BIBREF117"}, {"start": 286, "end": 291, "text": "[120]", "ref_id": "BIBREF119"}, {"start": 355, "end": 360, "text": "[121]", "ref_id": "BIBREF120"}, {"start": 451, "end": 456, "text": "[104]", "ref_id": "BIBREF103"}, {"start": 567, "end": 572, "text": "[122]", "ref_id": "BIBREF121"}, {"start": 747, "end": 752, "text": "[120]", "ref_id": "BIBREF119"}, {"start": 800, "end": 805, "text": "[123]", "ref_id": "BIBREF122"}, {"start": 848, "end": 853, "text": "[124]", "ref_id": "BIBREF123"}, {"start": 900, "end": 905, "text": "[125,", "ref_id": "BIBREF124"}, {"start": 906, "end": 910, "text": "126]", "ref_id": "BIBREF125"}, {"start": 964, "end": 969, "text": "[127]", "ref_id": "BIBREF126"}, {"start": 1100, "end": 1105, "text": "[118]", "ref_id": "BIBREF117"}, {"start": 1256, "end": 1261, "text": "[128]", "ref_id": "BIBREF127"}, {"start": 1517, "end": 1521, "text": "[90]", "ref_id": "BIBREF89"}, {"start": 1645, "end": 1650, "text": "[129]", "ref_id": "BIBREF128"}, {"start": 1795, "end": 1800, "text": "[130]", "ref_id": "BIBREF129"}, {"start": 2275, "end": 2280, "text": "[131]", "ref_id": "BIBREF130"}, {"start": 2574, "end": 2579, "text": "[132]", "ref_id": "BIBREF131"}, {"start": 2820, "end": 2825, "text": "[127]", "ref_id": "BIBREF126"}, {"start": 2932, "end": 2937, "text": "[114]", "ref_id": "BIBREF113"}, {"start": 3219, "end": 3224, "text": "[114]", "ref_id": "BIBREF113"}, {"start": 3417, "end": 3422, "text": "[114]", "ref_id": "BIBREF113"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "MSRV and its role in MS"}, {"text": "The HERV-W envelope-encoded glycoprotein, syncytin-1, is readily detected in healthy placenta and is principally expressed by the chromosomal locus, 7q21.2 although there are other loci that encode partial and complete sequences (Fig. 2) . Syncytin-1 is also detected as both transcript and protein in brain tissues from MS patients [102] , especially in astrocytes and microglia within active and chronic MS demyelinating lesions [102] . Syncytin-1 appears to be distinct from MSRV env, but with sequence similarities [100] . Syncytin-1 is overexpressed in brains of individuals with MS [102, 133] and examination of its copy numbers by PCR techniques revealed a significant increase in RNA and DNA copy numbers in the brain tissue but not in peripheral blood mononuclear cells, CSF or plasma of MS patients relative to controls [108, 134] . A major difference between syncytin-1 and MSRV env is the localization of the protein. While the former is found intracellularly and on the plasma membrane, MSRV has been reported to be found as an extracellular virus, visualized by electron microscopy, sedimenting at retrovirus buoyant density, with reverse transcriptase activity and a poly A(+) RNA containing terminal repeats, gag, pol and env sequences. However, aside from point mutations that distinguish MSRV env from syncytin-1 [108] , the MSRV env can also be distinguished from syncytin-1 by the presence of a 12 nucleotide insertion in the cytoplasmic tail of the transmembrane region of MSRV. Using specific probes, quantification of DNA, RNA of MSRV and syncytin-1 in PBMCs revealed that MSRV was significantly increased in PBMCs of MS patients compared to controls in contrast to syncytin-1 [109] . While the expression of syncytin-1 in PBMCs in this study agrees with an earlier study using a less sensitive PCR approach [108] , the expression pattern of MSRV env is at odds with other studies [100, 108] . Interestingly, syncytin-1-negative/ MSRV env-positive PBMCs from MS patients showed MSRV Env glycoprotein expression, albeit with an antibody that does not distinguish between MSRV env and syncytin-1 [100] .

Increased syncytin-1 expression in astrocytes leads to induction of free radicals [102] .

Retroviruses have been shown to induce an ER stress response; the envelope protein of MuLV is known to upregulate GRP78/BiP as a means to protect cells from apoptosis [140] . However, when ER stress is prolonged, some of the chaperones persist and bind to promoter elements resulting in transcription of genes that alter cellular function. Astrocytes that undergo ER stress as a consequence of syncytin-1 expression release free radicals through the induction of iNOS mediated by OASIS. Free radicals are responsible for much of the pathology in MS as evidenced by axonal damage as well as death and damage of oligodendrocytes. Blocking iNOS using inhibitors or scavenging free radicals using ingredients found in many natural compounds (e.g., ferulic acid) suppressed syncytin-1-mediated damage in cultured neural cells as well as in a mouse model [102] . It could be argued that inhibiting iNOS is not necessarily going to diminish lesions from developing in MS as iNOS as free radicals also have trophic effects in addition to their pathogenic properties [141] .

The syncytin-1 protein has also retained the ability to interact with the receptor for D-type retroviruses [67, 143] and can confer infectivity to pseudotyped retroviral particles [144] . A widely dispersed interference group of retroviruses that includes the feline endogenous virus (RD114), baboon endogenous virus, HERV-W and type D primate retroviruses uses the human Na-dependent neutral amino acid transporters type 1 and 2 (hASCT1; gene name, SLC1A4 and hASCT2; gene name, SLC1A5) as cell surface receptors.

ASCT2 abundance is low in the adult brain [149] and recent observations of ASCT2 immunostaining in human brains represent the first report of its expression predominantly in microglial cells [135] . In the mouse brain, ASCT1 was chiefly expressed in GFAP-positive astrocytes in the cerebral cortex and corpus callosum, but not in neurons, oligodendrocytes or activated/resting microglia [150] , similar to observations in the white matter of human brains. Interestingly, weak ASCT1 labeling was observed around ER cisterns, revealing its intracellular trafficking pathway or ASCT1 may have a functional role in exchange of ions between cytoplasm and ER lumen [150] . ASCT1 was also found to be significantly down-regulated in glial cells treated with 7-ketocholestrol, a by-product of myelin, damaged by oxidative stress, a key feature of MS [151] . Reduced expression of ASCT1 in astrocytes from MS patients appears to have adverse consequences for oligodendrocytes and perhaps other proximate cells' health and function. ASCT1 is the principal transport system involved in the secretion of L-serine [152] , a potent astrocyte-derived neurotrophic factor [150] , which is essential for myelination [153] and neuronal survival [154] .

Sequence divergence nearby will allow unambiguous identification of individual transcripts in order to determine the extent to which other syncytin-1-like transcripts are expressed. mediating intracellular transport of the excitotoxic amino acid, cysteine [154] , preventing its extracellular accumulation. A reciprocal interaction between syncytin-1 and its putative receptor, ASCT1, along with diminished amino acid influx has also been observed in the placenta [155] . Down-regulation of ASCT1 expression in mouse brain capillaries has been observed during the second postnatal week and is speculated to be due to lowered demand for small neutral amino acids from circulation or their increased synthesis in local glial cells [150] . These results suggest a highly specific role for ASCT1 down-regulation, since another astrocytic, amino acid transporter, EAAT1 [156] , was unaffected by syncytin-1 exposure [135] .

Further, the rationale for using NO donors was that syncytin-1 mediates NO production and formation of peroxynitrites [102] , both of which are known to induce ER stress [158] . Sodium nitroprusside (SNP), an NO donor, diminished ASCT1 expression in astrocytes, but also induced Egr1, a repressor protein of ASCT1 in neural cells [159, 160] . Of note, Egr1 suppresses TNF-\u03b1 [161] , which may have pathogenic consequences in MS due to the protective nature of this pro-inflammatory cytokine [162] . Bcl-2-induced Egr1 DNA binding activity has been correlated to oligodendrocyte death [163] . As iNOS and Egr1 are significantly enhanced in brain lesions of MS patients [164] with concurrent downregulation of ASCT1, there might be a potential role for Egr1 in MS neuropathogenesis. A transgenic mouse model of MS was developed that expressed syncytin-1 in astrocytes under the GFAP promoter. Indeed, syncytin-1 transgenic mice exhibited neurobehavioral features resembling MS. T cell (CD3 immunopositive) infiltration into the corpus callosum were observed in transgenic mice upon TNF-\u03b1 implantation, suggesting that the adaptive immune component of neuroinflammation is activated in this model. When syncytin-1 was over expressed in human astrocytes, syncytia develop [135] , which recapitulates an occasional finding of multinucleated (syncytia) astrocytes in plaques from MS patients [165] . Engagement of ASCT1 by syncytin-1 or treatment with IL-1\u03b2 results in suppression of its expression although the mechanism by which this reduction might occur remains uncertain [146] . Of interest, ASCT1 was also suppressed in the syncytin-1 transgenic mouse [135] . The down-regulation of ASCT1 in white matter of MS brains has important implications for oligodendrocyte and neuronal survival, given that ASCT1 on astrocytes is responsible for the export of L-serine, which can serve as a neurotrophic factor [154] . Astrocytes are the chief source of L-serine in the CNS [154] and the principal cells type expressing ASCT1 [150] . L-serine biosynthesis plays an important role in multiple cellular reactions, particularly in the brain, as L-serine is a precursor of important metabolites such as nucleotides, phospholipids and the neurotransmitters, L-glycine and D-serine. Disturbances of serine-glycine metabolism in relation to N-methyl-Daspartate-receptor activation might also play a role in MS pathogenesis [166] . Interestingly, disruption of L-serine biosynthesis, through deficiency in the enzyme, 3-phosphoglycerate dehydrogenase, results in dysmyelination, seizures and psychomotor retardation [167] . Earlier data indicated that treatment of astrocytes with the ASCT1 blocker, benzylserine, mediated oligodendrocyte injury and death [135] . Indeed, the underlying mechanisms by which syncytin-1 mediated its cytotoxic effects appeared to involve activation of the unfolded protein response (UPR) in the CNS, resulting in endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress, which can lead to inflammation and altered cell survival [168] (Fig. 3) .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 185, "end": 190, "text": "[157]", "ref_id": "BIBREF156"}, {"start": 311, "end": 316, "text": "[102]", "ref_id": "BIBREF101"}, {"start": 363, "end": 368, "text": "[158]", "ref_id": "BIBREF157"}, {"start": 523, "end": 528, "text": "[159,", "ref_id": "BIBREF158"}, {"start": 529, "end": 533, "text": "160]", "ref_id": "BIBREF159"}, {"start": 567, "end": 572, "text": "[161]", "ref_id": "BIBREF160"}, {"start": 683, "end": 688, "text": "[162]", "ref_id": "BIBREF161"}, {"start": 776, "end": 781, "text": "[163]", "ref_id": "BIBREF162"}, {"start": 860, "end": 865, "text": "[164]", "ref_id": "BIBREF163"}, {"start": 1460, "end": 1465, "text": "[135]", "ref_id": "BIBREF134"}, {"start": 1578, "end": 1583, "text": "[165]", "ref_id": "BIBREF164"}, {"start": 1762, "end": 1767, "text": "[146]", "ref_id": "BIBREF145"}, {"start": 1844, "end": 1849, "text": "[135]", "ref_id": "BIBREF134"}, {"start": 2095, "end": 2100, "text": "[154]", "ref_id": "BIBREF153"}, {"start": 2158, "end": 2163, "text": "[154]", "ref_id": "BIBREF153"}, {"start": 2210, "end": 2215, "text": "[150]", "ref_id": "BIBREF149"}, {"start": 2600, "end": 2605, "text": "[166]", "ref_id": "BIBREF165"}, {"start": 2792, "end": 2797, "text": "[167]", "ref_id": "BIBREF166"}, {"start": 2932, "end": 2937, "text": "[135]", "ref_id": "BIBREF134"}, {"start": 3212, "end": 3217, "text": "[168]", "ref_id": "BIBREF167"}], "ref_spans": [{"start": 3218, "end": 3226, "text": "(Fig. 3)", "ref_id": null}], "section": "HERV-W and its receptors"}, {"text": "The endoplasmic reticulum has 3 basic functions: (1) protein synthesis, (2) protein folding and (3) calcium storage [169, 170] .

However, when the levels of unfolded or misfolded proteins in the ER are too high for effective ER function, four mechanisms of cellular response to this condition can be activated, which are collectively termed the unfolded protein response (UPR) [170] . The first mechanism of the UPR is to increase the expression of ER chaperones to increase the rate of correct protein folding in the ER [170] . If this mechanism fails, the second UPR mechanism is translation attenuation, which decreases the rate at which proteins are synthesized in the ER and hence decreases the rate at which proteins accumulate in the ER [170] . If these two mechanisms are not successful, the third UPR mechanism is ERassociated degradation (ERAD) [170, 171] . During ERAD, proteins are tagged and retrotranslocated out of the ER into the cytoplasm where they are degraded via the ubiquitin-proteosome pathway [171] . However, if ERAD fails, unfolded proteins aggregate and lead to the fourth and final UPR mechanism: ER stress [170] . ER stress can lead to apoptosis, oxidative stress and inflammation [170, 172] . There are 3 principal ER stress sensors: PERK (PRKR-like endoplasmic reticulum kinase), IRE-1 (inositol requirement enzyme-1) and ATF-6 (activating transcription factor 6) [173, 174] (Table 3) . PERK is a protein kinase that is activated when there is ER stress; its role in ER stress is to phosphorylate eIF-2\u03b1 and stop translation [169, 175] . IRE-1 has kinase and endoribonuclease activity; however, its cardinal function in ER stress is to cleave a 26-bp intron in pre-mature transcript of XBP-1 (X-box binding protein 1) [172, 175] . The third ER stress sensor, ATF6, is a transcription factor that has a basic region and a leucine zipper motif and its principal role in ER stress is to enhance transcription of ER chaperones [172, 173] . In the absence of ER stress these 3 ER stress sensors are bound to binding immunogenic protein (BIP) and expressed at a very low level [174] . The main control for these three sensors, BiP, is an ER glucose regulated chaperone that plays a major role in ER stress [171] [172] [173] .

Phosphorylated eIF-2\u03b1 will enhance translation of specific mRNA for transcription factors like ATF4 or chaperones such as CHOP which will in turn activate the transcription of anti-oxidant genes and stimulate the expression of ERAD component genes [170, 176] .

Infection by cytomegalovirus transiently induces Grp78/BiP at early stages but returns to basal levels at the later stage. This coincides with expression of other markers of UPR. Increased Grp78/BiP at the early stages inhibits the stress response by interacting with PERK, ATF6 and IRE1. Thus, the virus seems to induce Grp78/BiP in order to control ER stress [183] . Caspase-12 is an initiator caspase required for transduction of a death signal from the ER in infected cells and is activated by several viruses and the onset occurs before activation of caspase-8 and -3 [185] . Multiple viruses induce apoptosis mediated by ER stress through the activation of GADD153/CHOP. Virus infection activates the p38 MAPK pathway, which then acts on GADD153/CHOP to initiate apoptosis in infected cells. Through the regulation of as yet unidentified proteins, several viruses including African swine fever virus, block the expression of GADD153/CHOP [183] . It is unclear, however, why some viruses promote ER-mediated apoptosis. Several studies of neurotropic murine retroviruses have reported the induction of inflammation and ER stressrelated genes [186] . Moreover, ER stress was related specifically to an individual envelope protein expressed by the retrovirus.

Stressed neurons also exhibit increases in [Ca 2+ ] i -mediated phosphorylation of calmodulin (CaM) kinase II\u03b1. Since ts1 infects glial cells, but not neurons, an indirect mechanism of neuronal death, perhaps glutamate excitotoxicity associated with NMDA receptor activation due to neurotoxins from infected glia, might lead to neurodegeneration [187] . The envelope protein of an avirulent retroviral strain, F43, binds to Grp78/BiP and is processed through the normal secretory pathway. In contrast, the envelope protein of FrCasBr E bound to Grp78/BiP for a prolonged period is retained in the ER and diverted to the proteasome for degradation [186] . MoMuLV ts1-infected astrocytes induce GADD153/ CHOP in neurons but not astrocytes [187, 188] . GADD153/CHOP and Grp78/BiP as well as iNOS and apoptosis are induced in p53 deficient microglial cells when treated with lipopolysaccharide [189] or IFN-\u03b3, suggesting p53-independent NO-induced apoptotic mechanism in microglia [190] . Both FrCasBr E and ts1 strains induce a protein misfolding disease since Grp78/BiP binds to hydrophobic residues and attempts to prevent protein aggregation of misfolded proteins and thus activating an UPR. We have shown that replication-competent feline immunodeficiency virus (FIV) is essential for inducing an ER stress response and a Fig. 4 . Mammalian ER stress mechanisms. In the absence of ER stress, BiP is bound to all 3 ER stress cascade initiators (PERK, IRE1 and ATF6). When ER stress occurs, BiP dissociates from the ER stress cascade initiators and binds to the unfolded and misfolded proteins. PERK is a kinase that phosphorylates EIF2\u03b1 which leads to the translocation of ATF4 and ultimately activation of CHOP promoter. Endonuclease, IRE1, splices XBP1 pre-mRNA into its mature transcript variant and also leads to the induction of CHOP. ATF6 is a transcription factor that gets cleaved twice before it translocates into the nucleus to enhance the transcription of CHOP and ER chaperone genes. Also ER stress can indirectly lead to increased iNOS and production of pro-inflammatory cytokines through oxidative stress. vigorous neurotoxic and immune response in feline macrophages and in vivo. However, mere exposure and/or expression of the envelope protein of FIV were insufficient to induce an ER stress response [191] . ER stress can activate inflammation through activation of NF-\u03baB, as previously described. Similarly TRAF2 ((TNF-\u03b1)-receptor-associated factor 2) can form a complex with IRE-1\u03b1 and also activate inflammatory genes through a phosphorylation cascade [172] . TNF-\u03b1 is a cytokine that breaches the BBB and causes neuroinflammation [172, 192] . IRE-1\u03b1-TRAF2 complex can phosphorylate JNK (JUN N-terminal kinase), which phosphorylates AP1 (transcription factor activator protein 1) [172] .

The in vitro production of retroviruslike particles (RVLPs) in cell cultures from MS patients but not healthy controls may be enhanced or activated by infectious triggers such as Herpes viruses (e.g. herpes simplex virus (HSV), EBV). Independent molecular analysis of retroviral RNA associated with RVP revealed two different genetic families of endogenous retroviral elements: MSRV/ HERV-W and RGH/HERV-H. Retroviral particles of the latter were reported to be transmitted to mitogen-stimulated lymphocytes from healthy donors [115, 116] . Although this study was not confirmed, it suggests that one or more HERVs may be associated with MS. In a recent study from Spain, of 48 MS patients studied within a patient population of 92, CSF samples showed no HERV-H RNA [194] . In fact, HERV-W was also not detected. In a Danish study, using a wellcontrolled study group, seroreactivity to select HERV-H peptides was determined by a sensitive time resolved immunofluorometric assay and generally MS patients with an active disease status had antibodies to several HERV-H peptides compared to non-active disease as well as unaffected relatives. At least 50% of the MS patient sera exhibited this response and there was a positive correlation with lower levels of an innate immune molecule, MASP3 [195] . In agreement with other infectious agents associated with MS, HERV-H was found to show a profound increase in cell-mediated immune response when peptides corresponding to the gag and env regions elicited a significant proliferative effect when combined with HSV and HHV-6A [32] . Indeed, splice variants of HERV-H env were also detected in about 40% of MS patients and attributed to the high transcription and translation of HERV-H env-encoded protein, which also elicited a strong serological activity. Interestingly, the splice variants associated with MS did not have any known homology with a host gene and thus ascribing loci was not achieved [116] . Most studies with HERV-H have involved determining whether there is a serological response to HERV-H antigenic peptides and invariably MS patient-derived PBMCs (which are in an activated state) always respond to these peptides more vigorously than control-derived PBMCs [196] . T cells and PBMCs from 25% of MS patients when cultured express retrovirus-like particles, which vary in size from 70 to 100 nm and appear morphologically similar to type C retroviruses in being irregularly rounded, with surface projections on the envelope and a relatively electron dense nucleocapsid/core [107] .

In a follow up study, the same group examined the synergism between herpesvirus antigens and HERVs in the release of pro-inflammatory cytokines in PBMCs [198] .

It is conceivable that HERV allelic variants exert specific effects on the MS phenotype, progression and response to therapy depending on the host genetic background. Indeed, detection of sequences will require confirmatory sequencing to establish the encoding locus before definitive associations between disease and specific HERVs can be made. For example, it is imperative to understand the molecular nature of HERV recombination events that might trigger the emergence of a novel retroelement from individuals with MS, its geographic restriction and epidemiological features. In addition, allelic variation within specific HERVs, already associated with disease, warrants investigation. Since detection of MSRV, syncytin-1 and HERV-H in serum, plasma and brain tissue have depended on the use of RT-PCR, the use and efficacy of this technique for quantification of multicopy genes such as HERVs has recently raised questions about its utility. Quantitative RT-PCR analysis has not been performed in many studies, largely because of the large number of truncated HERV genes in the genome, pseudogenes and the homology between members of the same family.

It has been postulated that there may exist a pathogenic cascade in MS involving several step-specific pathogens interacting with particular genetic elements leading to enhanced retroviral expression [200] . There is no conclusive proof that any HERV plays a major role in human disease although investigators have postulated several possible pathogenic mechanisms. HERVs, for example, could enhance the transcription of cellular genes downstream of HERV-LTRs that contain promoter elements. HERVs have also been posited to encode superantigens that result in enhanced inflammatory responses or mimic self-antigens leading to autoimmune pathologies such as lupus or MS [201] . Viral proteins interact directly or indirectly with promoters of various inflammatory cytokines and regulate their expression in infected cells. MSRV can be transactivated in vitro by two herpes simplex virus type 1 immediate early proteins [202] and thus act as triggering cofactors of MSRV in the pathogenesis of MS. In a similar fashion, MS long-term lymphocyte cell lines, which are EBV-transformed B cells with a T cell subpopulation, with high reverse transcriptase activity attributed to HERV-H RVLP, also produced significant levels of IL-2, IFN-\u03b3, GM-CSF and TNF-\u03b1 [107] .

In fact, cytokines such as IL-4, IL-6, TNF-\u03b1 and IFN-\u03b3 might induce the release of MSRV particles thereby contributing to the pathogenic feedback loop [125] . These differences in cytokine profiles are to be expected as MS is a heterogeneous disease and compounded by allelic variations among patients, multiple cellular constituents (lymphocyte, PBMC, brains, CSF), stage of the disease, treatment regimen, etc. However, in a recent new study, MSRV env, MSRV gag and syncytin-1 did not provoke immune responses among MS patients who were HLA-B7 matched [114] . This observation suggests that either some specific antigenic epitope among the RVLPs is necessary or a specific protein folding pattern which might not be achieved in insect cells when recombinantly produced or that the pathogenesis is localized to the CNS as argued for syncytin-1 [102, 134, 135] .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 116, "end": 121, "text": "[130]", "ref_id": "BIBREF129"}, {"start": 156, "end": 159, "text": "[2]", "ref_id": "BIBREF1"}, {"start": 362, "end": 367, "text": "[200]", "ref_id": "BIBREF199"}, {"start": 831, "end": 836, "text": "[201]", "ref_id": "BIBREF200"}, {"start": 1080, "end": 1085, "text": "[202]", "ref_id": "BIBREF201"}, {"start": 1413, "end": 1418, "text": "[107]", "ref_id": "BIBREF106"}, {"start": 1535, "end": 1540, "text": "[130]", "ref_id": "BIBREF129"}, {"start": 1694, "end": 1699, "text": "[125]", "ref_id": "BIBREF124"}, {"start": 2097, "end": 2102, "text": "[114]", "ref_id": "BIBREF113"}, {"start": 2388, "end": 2393, "text": "[102,", "ref_id": "BIBREF101"}, {"start": 2394, "end": 2398, "text": "134,", "ref_id": "BIBREF133"}, {"start": 2399, "end": 2403, "text": "135]", "ref_id": "BIBREF134"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Conclusions and future directions"}, {"text": "Syncytin-1 expression is enhanced by various viruses including HSV-1 infection [138] . Yet induced expression of several HERV genes is observed in neuroinflammatory diseases including MS [69] , suggesting that HERVs found in MS are a by-product of the inflammatory component of MS, diluting the contention of some researchers that HERVs are a causative pathogen of MS [201] . Although HERVs are not the a priori cause of MS, they might participate in the pathogenesis such as in ER stress, and hence blocking HERV function in the CNS through specific therapies might diminish the progression of MS. While HERVs might also act as auto-, super-or neoantigens (upon expression of oncogenic viruses), HERV variants could participate in antigenic mimicry, all of which have the potential to enhance inflammatory responses or induce autoimmune reactions [110] . However, HERV-W expression in schizophrenia in which there is a lack of inflammation does not support this hypothesis. HERVs are present at conception in humans and if the genes are involved in pathogenesis through polymorphisms or reintegration, there should be a predominant hereditary component of the disease and a minor environmental role. This is not the case with MS, which exhibits significant hereditary and environmental susceptibility factors. Our understanding of HERVs is limited due to variability in the composition of human DNA in terms of copy number variations, deletions, expression patterns associated with methylation and tissue-specific effects. Given the abundance of HERV sequences in the human genome (complete or incomplete ORFs), it is also conceivable that retroelements express noncoding RNAs that act as microRNAs or siRNAs [203] . Because HERVs are conserved evolutionarily, differentially expressed in specific tissues and might participate in disease inheritance, susceptibility and progression, it is imperative to delineate HERV genetics and biology. Indeed, elucidation of individual HERV contributions to pathogenesis might enhance treatments for MS (Table 4 ) and other diseases that involve HERV expression or activation in a patient-or populationspecific manner.
