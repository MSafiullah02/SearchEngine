It is frequently complicated by overwhelming immunological reactions, with overactivation of T cells, leading to acute respiratory distress syndrome and multiorgan failure, secondary to immunopathological processes. The viral load of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 is not correlated with worsening symptoms, but it is the host inflammatory response that is a major cause of lung damage and subsequent mortality.1, 2 Hyper-inflammatory responses in patients with COVID-19 are associated with a cytokine storm that is characterised by an increase in proinflammatory cytokines, including tumour necrosis factor, interleukin (IL)-1\u03b2, IL-6, and other chemokines in serum.3, 4 Overwhelming secretion of cytokines causes severe lung damage, which manifests as extensive damage to pulmonary vascular endothelial cells and alveolar epithelial cells, as well as increased pulmonary vascular permeability, leading to pulmonary oedema and hyaline membrane formation.2, 3, 4\n",

It is likely that both antivirals and blockage of inflammatory pathways are needed to optimise responses. For example, it would be relevant to understand the role of steroids in combination with or sequential to antiviral treatments. Without studying combinations, and their potential synergies or additive effects, potentially useful agents could be disregarded. Furthermore, in the absence of synergistic combinations, single drugs might cause more harm\u2014for example, mass killing of the virus might enhance inflammatory responses. Because of the urgency of the current situation and, so far, an absence of clear evidence of a clinically meaningful effect of any monotherapy strategy, investigators should join their efforts in proposing, rather than adaptive or sequential studies of a single strategy, combined approaches through multifactorial designs. This approach will enable determination of the risks and benefits of combinations versus monotherapies. Such trials with multifactorial designs (eg, with randomisation first to antivirals and then to adjunctive immune-based therapy) are urgently needed and could provide more rapidly clinically meaningful results.",

We call for collaboration between pharmaceutical companies, institutions, and policy makers to either allow individuals to be enrolled simultaneously in trials of different investigational drugs with distinct targets or to collaborate on trials that include study arms that investigate combination therapy.",
