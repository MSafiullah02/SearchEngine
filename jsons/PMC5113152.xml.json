            "text": "The discovery of ribozymes, RNA interference, and riboswitches brought RNA to the forefront of molecular biology by demonstrating that these molecules are ubiquitously involved in a wide range of cellular processes (1, 2, 3, 4). Genome sequencing and high-throughput expression profiling have recently revealed novel long noncoding (lnc) RNAs, some of which are thousands of nucleotides long and are known to play important regulatory functions (5, 6). For example, Xist lncRNA is a 17 kb-long transcript responsible for silencing one of the homologous pair of X chromosomes during mammalian development (7, 8). Others, such as HOTAIR and NRON, are important regulators of gene expression (9, 10, 11) linked to diverse human diseases (12). Furthermore, a vast number of important pathogenic viruses including HIV, SARS coronavirus, poliovirus, Dengue fever virus, and many others utilize long RNAs as genetic material, which also play structural roles during virus assembly and genome packaging (13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20). Previous studies have established the importance of local secondary and three-dimensional structure in the biological function of RNA (21, 22). However, the effects of the secondary structure on the large-scale properties (e.g., size) of long RNAs remain poorly understood, even while its importance for virus assembly has been demonstrated (13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20).",

            "text": "Several models have been developed to describe properties of double-stranded (ds) and single-stranded (ss) homopolymeric nucleic acids, both of which behave as linear polymers. Coarse-grained properties of long dsRNAs are well described by semiflexible polymer models such as the wormlike chain (23), which only take into account the overall contour length and average persistence length, the latter being weakly dependent on sequence or base composition. Similarly, the freely jointed chain model describes the conformational behavior of the more flexible single-stranded homopolymers (24, 25). These models yield simple scaling laws, which relate the contour length (l) or a degree of polymerization (N, number of nucleotides) to the overall size, e.g., radius of gyration (Rg) or hydrodynamic radius (Rh):(1)Rg\u223cRh\u223cb(1-\u03bd)\u00d7l\u03bd\u223cN\u03bd.Here \u03bd is a scaling exponent that depends on the polymer chain model (e.g., \u03bd = 0.5 for an ideal Gaussian chain, \u03bd = 0.59 for a self-avoiding chain, and \u03bd \u223c 1 for a stiff polyelectrolyte at low ionic strength), and b represents an effective segment length that is related to the persistence length (lp) and describes polymer flexibility. Highly structured RNAs are described by a collapsed polymer chain model with \u03bd close to 0.33, also applicable to other compact biopolymers such as globular proteins (26, 27).",

            "text": "In contrast, due to extensive intramolecular basepairing arising from Watson-Crick complementarity of nucleotides separated by long distances along the chain contour, long ssRNAs fold into effectively branched structures with short duplex regions emanating from single-stranded loops (28) (Fig. 1). Furthermore, given the plethora of possible basepairing scenarios, thermally equilibrated long RNAs are expected to display a large number of secondary structures in solution. Notable exceptions are RNAs in large ribonucleoprotein complexes such as in ribosomes (29) or virus capsids (15, 30, 31, 32, 33, 34, 35). This view is supported by recent experiments confirming that protein-free viral genomic RNAs adopt an ensemble of branched conformations (28), which are further compacted upon viral assembly (14, 20, 36, 37). Hence, selecting out a unique (native) or representative conformation is less appropriate and useful than averaging over a statistical (thermal) ensemble of secondary structures, for obtaining a reasonable estimate of the overall RNA size.",

The sizes compare well with those predicted by two ensemble averaging methods that take into account the sequence-dependent effective branching of long RNAs. Furthermore, this correlation holds even in the presence of polyvalent cations that enhance tertiary interactions and result in measurable compaction of RNAs, suggesting that these polymer theory-based methods can successfully predict sizes of long RNA molecules under a variety of conditions. Both methods are based on generic RNA structure prediction algorithms and, accordingly, would be widely applicable to other long RNAs with known sequences.",

The resulting PCR product was then amplified using 5\u2032-phosphorylated primers TCV_F2 and TCV_R2 (Table S1) to add a T7 promoter sequence to the 5\u2032-end and an XhoI restriction site to the 3\u2032-end.

Templates for transcription of 16S rRNA and 23S rRNA (16SrRNA_ pSMART_HCAmp and 23SrRNA_ pSMART_HCAmp) were produced by cloning the corresponding genes using genomic DNA extracted from E. coli BL21 cells.

This amplification resulted in incorporation of T7 promoter sequences at the 5\u2032-ends of both PCR products and DraI (16S rRNA DNA) and HindIII (23S rRNA DNA) restriction sites at their respective 3\u2032-ends. Further PCR product purification via agarose gel electrophoresis and subsequent cloning into a pSMART HCAmp vector were performed as described above for other DNA templates.

            "text": "To account for the conformational statistics associated with an ensemble of secondary structures, it is useful (28, 40, 41, 42, 43) to represent the RNA secondary structure as a tree graph (44), i.e., a collection of points (vertices) each of which is connected by a line (bond) to at least one other point, without any closed paths. Fig. 1 illustrates this mapping for a simple case: here duplexes are treated as rigid bonds of the same length\u2014tree edges, and single-stranded flexible loops are treated as tree vertices. Hairpin loops are vertices of order one; loops, including bulges, connecting two duplexes are twofold vertices; and loops from which three or more duplexes emanate are branched vertices (see Fig. 1\nA). To calculate the size of the resulting branched polymer (Fig. 1\nB), two approaches can be used. The first method makes use of the Kramers theorem (41, 45, 46) to directly calculate Rg from the tree topology. In the second method, the size is determined by identifying the longest chain of edges found within the tree\u2014defined as the maximum ladder distance (MLD, Fig. 1\nA) (42, 43)\u2014and the branched tree is replaced by a linear chain with effective contour length (Neff) proportional to the MLD. Treating the resulting linear polymer as an ideal chain then gives(2)Rg=(b2Neff/6)1/2.Here the segment length b corresponds to the average length of a duplex (\u22485 bp) (17, 28, 47) and Neff is the number of duplexes along the MLD, which is Neff = MLD/b. Thus,(3)Rg=(b2MLD/6b)1/2\u223c(MLD)1/2in bp units (42, 46). The MLD is estimated from RNA secondary structure predictions and can be further refined using structure probing experiments (21). Because there is heterogeneity among the many structures whose energies lie within a thermally available range (kBT), we use the Boltzmann-averaged MLD (denoted \u2329MLD\u232a), derived from an ensemble of RNA structures generated by prediction algorithms implemented in RNAfold (48). Earlier theoretical analyses have shown that while even the most sophisticated and accurate basepairing programs begin to fail for long RNAs like those treated here, the relative values of their \u2329MLD\u232a and Rg can still be meaningfully estimated (41, 42).",

Each tree graph representation was derived from a dot-bracket representation of the secondary structure (see the Vienna RNA web server manual at http://rna.tbi.univie.ac.at/help.html). The Rg was calculated from the tree graph by treating the vertices as perfectly flexible joints and the edges as rigid phantom bonds (i.e., as an ideal branched polymer), and using the Kramers theorem (46). More explicitly, the Rg of a branched polymer (tree graph) was calculated by(4)Rg2\u00af=(b2/L2)\u03a3jL1(j)[L\u2212L1(j)],where the overbar denotes an average over all conformations of the ideal branched polymer. The sum in Eq. 4 is evaluated by summing over all L bonds the product of L1(j) and L-L1(j), the numbers of vertices on either side of the jth bond (see Fig. 1\nB). The square root of Eq. 4 yields the radius of gyration of the tree graph (i.e., R\u02c6g=Rg2\u00af). We then averaged R\u02c6g over the tree graphs we generated from the secondary structures, which for simplicity we refer to as the Rg (i.e., Rg\u2261\u2329R\u02c6g\u232a).

Some of them, such as viral positive-sense ssRNA genomes, adopt compact conformations as part of their function and facilitate packaging into the confined space of icosahedral viral capsids (17). Likewise, several lncRNAs, including HOTAIR and SRA, assume well-defined conformations with separate domains, capable of folding into compact structures upon addition of divalent cations (49, 50). These independent domains interact with their binding partners via evolutionarily conserved protein-binding motifs (49). To better understand the architecture of long RNA molecules, e.g., their overall compactness or extendedness, we explore the relation between predicted sizes, using either the MLD or Rg obtained from Kramers theorem, respectively, and the experimentally determined hydrodynamic radii (Rh) for long RNAs, ranging from 600 to >9000 nucleotides in length.",

In contrast to other ensemble solution techniques (small-angle x-ray and light scattering, and analytical centrifugation), the dilute conditions minimize aggregation due to intermolecular basepairing, which has previously been shown to result in an overestimation of sizes (51). Furthermore, we have also used FCS to examine compaction of individual RNA molecules in response to biologically relevant divalent (Mg2+) and trivalent (spermidine, Sp3+) cations. The latter conditions promote formation of tertiary structures (52, 53).",

Due to the low RNA concentrations and ionic strength conditions used here (notably nonphysiological, by design), aggregation and tertiary structure formation are unlikely, so that the effects of branching due to secondary structure can be accentuated and be probed directly under close-to-isolated molecule (infinite-dilution) conditions. We note that while the measured Rh broadly increases with the length, the rise significantly deviates from the monotonic behavior expected for the simple scaling laws (Eq. 1, Fig. 2\nA). This result suggests that linear polymer scaling laws (Eq. 1) are not appropriate to describe long ssRNA, which is an effectively branched polymer.

The measured hydrodynamic radii are in good agreement with the theoretical estimates of the Rg values based either on the MLD (Fig. 2\nB, Eq. 3) or the Kramers theorem (Fig. 2\nC). This result is consistent with most RNA molecules adopting branched structures in which the MLD largely determines the overall size (41, 42). This is illustrated by comparing the maximum ladder path of rotavirus segment 11 precursor (s11, Fig. 1\nC) with that of MS2 phage genomic RNA (Fig. 1\nD). The experimentally determined secondary structure pattern of s11 is significantly less branched than that of the typical prediction for MS2. Furthermore, this is reflected in the relatively large MLD and hydrodynamic size of s11, comparable to that of Ef2 mRNA, which is three times the length. This demonstrates that the relatively simple MLD description can capture the essence of coarse-grained RNA structure, and yields quantitative predictions based on the RNA sequence alone.",

Fig. 3 compares Rh before and after the addition of multivalent cations. The Rh values cluster along the line with the slope between 0.7 and 0.8, indicating that on average the RNAs undergo a 20\u201325% size compaction compared to their original Rh. As a consequence, the proportionality between Rh and predicted size holds for most of the RNAs even after addition of polyvalent cations.

            "text": "The quantitative relation between the experimental Rh and Rg predicted either from \u2329MLD\u232a or the Kramers theorem indicates that modeling the RNA as an ideal branched polymer constitutes a good starting point for predicting the overall size of long RNAs. However, there are several notable discrepancies between the predicted and measured sizes. One limitation of our approach is that computational predictions may yield an incorrect structure and hence an MLD that differs from that of the experimentally determined secondary structure, as in the case of STMV RNA (21, 55). Such failures of the computational approach are more likely to occur when long RNA sequences are analyzed, thus explaining the largest deviations observed for HCV and BunV L (>5 kb), the longest RNAs examined here (Fig. 2\nB; Table 1) (17, 28). This situation can be remedied by estimating MLD from structure-probing data, which should improve the accuracy of RNA size calculations. This is demonstrated for s11 RNA for which the probing-derived MLDexp is slightly lower than the computed average \u2329MLD\u232a (Fig. 1\nC, compare \u2329MLD\u232a and MLDexp), yielding a Rg \u223c 9.3 value that agrees better with the experimental Rh (i.e., point No. 1 would be closer to the trend line in Fig. 2\nB). On the other hand, when secondary structure determination (or prediction) is ambiguous, experimental size measurements by FCS can be used for selecting those structures with MLDs compatible with the experimentally determined hydrodynamic radii. In addition to the MLD prediction limitations, HCV RNA is compacted twofold in the presence of multivalent ions, i.e., to a much higher degree than other RNAs examined here (20\u201325% reduction), highlighting the importance of repulsive electrostatic interactions at low salt and formation of tertiary contacts stabilized by multivalent cations, not accounted for in our approach.",

Analysis of the scrambled RNA sequence yields a reduction of \u2329MLD\u232a and is reflected in a concomitant decrease (significant at 99% confidence level) of experimentally measured Rh (Table 1; Fig. 2, RNA No. 2). In this case the native, original fold of s11 RNA is an extended conformation while the scrambled sequence produces an ensemble of more branched and hence more compact species, further demonstrating the predictive power of the MLD approach.

While MS2 phage genomic and subgenomic ssRNAs (Nos. 9, 10, and 15 in Fig. 2\nA) are comparable in length to lncRNAs (Nos. 8 and 11) and the protein-free ribosomal RNA (No. 12), they appear to be smaller in size (see 2\u20134 kb region in Fig. 2\nA). However, the Ef2 mRNA transcript (No. 6) is yet even more compact than the comparatively short viral RNAs (RNAs No. 4, 5, and 13 in Fig. 2\nA), suggesting that although there might be evolutionary pressure on genomes of ssRNA viruses to fold into more compact structures (17), there is a number of exceptions, including more extended viral RNAs (21) and compact mRNAs. Moreover, relative size of viral RNAs may also reflect replication strategies and genome packaging mechanisms employed by viruses. For example, viruses with segmented RNA genomes may preferentially utilize extended, less branched RNA conformations for their segment precursors (s11 in Fig. 1\nC) to minimize the formation of nonspecific intersegment RNA-RNA contacts, while enabling formation of specific interactions facilitated by the viral RNA chaperones (58).",

Because the theoretical approaches used here treat exclusively the branching patterns associated with the RNA secondary structures, our results provide experimental evidence that the overall sizes of long RNAs are determined predominantly by their secondary structure branching patterns (17). The effects of di- and polyvalent cations are more prominent for smaller RNAs, such as riboswitches and ribozymes, which adopt compact and unique tertiary structures in the presence of Mg2+ (59) via formation of specific tertiary contacts. Due to the heterogeneity of secondary structures in long RNAs, such specific contacts would be harder to achieve, while also explaining why long RNAs often require auxiliary proteins to guide their folding into a unique structure. This feature of RNA is likely to be the result of a limited repertoire of interactions offered by the four nucleobases and points to a fundamental limitation of RNA as a complex biopolymer when compared to proteins. We find that even relatively simple theoretical calculations based on ensembles of predicted secondary structures and MLD averaging correlate well with the experimental measurements for a diverse set of long RNA molecules, allowing our approach to account for the sizes and compactness of broad classes of ssRNAs.",
