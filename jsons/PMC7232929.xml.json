Some advances in cancer treatment by targeted drugs, such as imatinib, gefitinib, and trastuzumab, were expected to improve cancer cure rates and also to reduce severe adverse actions because of the high specificity of the targeted drugs, which are expressed and have critical roles in cancer cells, but not in normal cells. However, the clinical effect was found to be limited and did not last for a long period because of the acquired resistance of the tumor cells. Furthermore, these drugs often cause on-target and/or off-target severe toxicity (Keefe and Bateman 2011). Therefore, the development of more target-specific therapy, with minimum toxicity, is warranted to extend disease-free survival and improve the quality of life of cancer patients.",

Initially, the docking studies were carried out on the BRAF\u2014sorafenib complex (PDB code 4R5Y) (Tang et al. 2015), using the Discovery Studio 2016 client to remove the small-molecule ligand of erlotinib in 4R5Y to obtain the three-dimensional crystal structure of BRAF, and then the designed compounds were docked to the crystal structure BRAF with MVD software.

This implies that the compound we designed is likely to become an effective BRAF inhibitor. From Fig. 4b, c, we can see that the carbon-based oxygen atom in the urea structure in the 7u structure can act as a hydrogen bond acceptor to generate hydrogen bond interaction with the amino-acid residue ASP594. At the same time, NH in the urea structure close to chlorophenyl group can act as a hydrogen bond donor to generate hydrogen bond interactions with the amino-acid residue GLU501. All of this confirms the feasibility of introducing a diphenylurea structure into the drug design to increase the affinity of the compound to the target. Moreover, N atom on the pyridine ring in 7u has a hydrogen bond with THR529, and the N atom on the pyridine with N on amides in sorafenib can generate a hydrogen bond with CYS532. This also shows the importance of introducing a pyridine ring. Hence, we can conclude that both the diaryl urea structure and the pyridinyl ring structure in our designed compounds enhance the affinity of the compound to the target BRAF kinase. In addition, it can be seen that the amino-acid residues HIS574, LYS483, PHE595, VAL471, GLN 530, ALA481, PHE583 formed some weak interactions between the compound 7u and BRAF.",

(2) The substituent on the A ring has a significant effect on the inhibitory activity of the target compounds. When the substituents on the C ring are the same, when the ring A of the compound is substituted by an electron withdrawing group such as \u2013F, \u2013Cl or \u2013CF3 or the like, the inhibitory activity is superior to the compound substituted with an electron donating group such as \u2013OCH3. In addition, when electron withdrawing group coexist in the A ring, the inhibitory activity is better than of the two electron withdrawing groups. (3) The inhibitory effect of the compound on the three test cells showed different selectivity. Most of the compounds inhibited the activity of A549 cells better than the inhibitory activities of HCT-116 cells, while the inhibitory activity against PC-3 cells was poor.",

It was found that NH and oxygen in the urea structure, the N atom of pyridine ring form a hydrogen bond with the amino-acid residue in the BRAF protein. A novel series of 1-aryl-3-[4-(pyridin-2-ylmethoxy)phenyl]urea derivatives were evaluated for their antiproliferative activity against A549, HCT-116, PC-3 cancer cell lines and HL7702 human normal liver cell lines in vitro by using the MTT colorimetric assay. Most of the target compounds demonstrate significant antiproliferative effects on all the selective cancer cell lines.
