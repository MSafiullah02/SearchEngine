Considering the published literatures on medicinal importance, total 154 phytochemicals with analogous structure from limonoids and triterpenoids were selected to search potential inhibitors for the five protein targets of SARS-CoV-2, i.e., 3CLpro (main protease), PLpro (papain like protease), SGp-RBD (spike glycoprotein-receptor binding domain), RdRp (RNA dependent RNA polymerase, ACE2 (angiotensin converting enzyme 2). Analyses of the in silico computational results and reported medicinal uses, the phytochemicals such as 7deacetyl-7-benzoylgedunin, epoxyazadiradione, limonin, maslinic acid, glycyrrhizic acid and ursolic acid were found to be effective against the target proteins of SARS-CoV-2. The proteinligand interaction study revealed that these phytochemicals bind at the main active site of the target proteins. Therefore, the core structure of these potential hits can be used for further lead optimization to design drugs for SARS-CoV-2. Also, the plants extracts like neem, tulsi, citrus and olives containing these phytochemicals can be used to formulate suitable therapeutics approaches in traditional medicines.",

Repurpose of some approved drugs like hydroxychloroquine, remdesivir, favipiravir, arbidol, hydroxychloroquine/azithromycin, lopinavir/ritonavir and lopinavir/ritonavir combined with interferon beta etc. are used, but despite some promising results further clinical results are required to examine their mechanisms of inhibition, efficacy and safety in the treatment of COVID-19 [4] [5] [6] [7] [8] . Therefore, both computational and experimental approaches are adopted to search suitable drugs from the library of FDI-approved drugs and also drugs under clinical trial but not yet approved to repurpose against the COVID-19. Simultaneously, the recent reports supporting the use of traditional medicines as adjuvant for treating COVID-19 [9] [10] [11] and therefore, efforts are also going to integrate the use of both western drugs and traditional medicines to formulate suitable therapeutic strategies.",

Our literatures survey revealed that the triterpenoids like 3\u03b2friedelanol from Euphorbia neriifolia, quinone-methide triterpenoids extracted from Tripterygium regelii (Celastraceae) and glycyrrhizin from Glycyrrhiza glabra are experimentally proven to inhibit the effects of SARS-CoV (first identified in Guangdong, China in 2002) [12] [13] [14] [15] . Also, our recent molecular docking studies of phytochemicals against the protein targets of SARS-CoV-2 supported the higher binding affinity towards limonin, a triterpenoid found in citrus [16] .

Maslinic acid, corosolic acid and 2-hydroxyseneganolide are potent inhibitors of SGp-RBD active sites that hinder to dock hACE2 receptor. Glycyrrhizic acid including ursolic acid could potentially interfere with the ACE2-SGp RBD complex with binding energy -10.3kcal/mol. Olives, holy basil and lycorice triterpenoids potentially obstruct SGp and ACE2 receptors disease establishment. Therefore, the computational predictions along with the reported pharmacological properties postulated that the limonoids and triterpenoids are potential against SARS-CoV-2 target proteins. The outcomes will be useful in formulating therapeutic strategies using the traditional medicines as well as the potential hits can be used for lead optimization for drugs discovery for SARS-CoV-2.",
