This team met and reviewed the best practice literature for HAPI prevention, determined and implemented evidence-based interventions for each of the HAPI prevention bundle elements, and evaluated the feasibility of the bundle interventions in a variety of clinical settings (acute care to critical care). After a review of the literature, the group voted to implement the standard SPS HAPI prevention bundle with the addition of nutrition consults as appropriate in high-risk patients. Defined elements of the HAPI prevention bundle included full head to toe skin assessment, device assessment and rotation, patient positioning, appropriate bed/pressure-redistributing surface, moisture management, and nutrition consult for at-risk patients (Table 1).",

An interdisciplinary group convened to look at the current state of deep dives for HAPI and to redesign a standard process for all units. Our institution utilizes deep dives after the occurrence of HAPIs (stage 3, 4, unstageable, and deep tissue injury) to identify modifiable and nonmodifiable factors that resulted in the HAPI occurrence. These deep dives require a team approach and involve the unit clinical nurse specialist, bedside nurses, unit management, and physicians, in coordination with the wound ostomy team. The deep dive process is completed partially by the unit and partly by the wound care team. The unit is responsible for following up with those who provided care for the patient and collecting information about factors that may have contributed to the event. The wound care team identifies the source of the injury through patient activities in the days before the event in conjunction with the location and severity of the injury. The wound team also looks at systemic issues or concerns that may have resulted in a higher likelihood of injury. With the newly designed process, for each SPS-reportable HAPI, there is a deep dive investigation to evaluate potential deviations in care that contributed to the event. The deep dive involves review by both certified wound and ostomy nurses, as well as unit-based leaders. The wound care nurses serve as subject matter experts and identify the suspected cause of the injury, potential contributing factors, and deviations in standard care. The deep dive looks more broadly for additional risk factors and practice deviations, such as identifying what interventions were in use, the overall patient condition, Braden QD score,7 and time in the operating room. Additionally, the deep dive identifies barriers to prevention efforts and steps that may prevent HAPIs in the future.",

It has been validated for use in preterm infants through age 21 years.7 Medical devices account for a significant percentage of pressure injuries in children, and the Braden QD allows for quantification of that risk related to medical devices.7 To standardize across the hospital and reduce confusion with using multiple scoring tools, we decided to utilize the Braden QD scale for all inpatients, even if over the age of 21 years.

Active surveillance occurs twice per month in the areas where the highest percentage of HAPIs occur in our organization, the cardiovascular intensive care unit and the pediatric intensive care unit. Nurses who have been trained by the wound ostomy team perform head to toe skin assessments on each patient within the unit in conjunction with bedside nurses. These assessments are opportunities for just-in-time coaching on HAPI reduction as well as identification of any potential or actual pressure injuries. This process is designed to be educational, so the main focus of active surveillance is coaching and modeling best practices while bringing special attention to pressure injury prevention on a routine basis.",

A smaller workgroup comprised staff from information services, wound care (consisting of certified wound ostomy nurses), and bedside nursing met several times to define the specifications for the information services Epic build, focusing on the measurement for each of the bundle elements. After this build was complete, a pilot was conducted with the SkIPE and wound care teams to solicit additional feedback and modifications. The outcome was a unit-level dashboard that aggregates the individual bundle compliance for each patient for each shift on a given unit. This dashboard enables the inpatient units to monitor their HAPI bundle compliance by individual bundle element. It allows units to easily review patients who have had HAPIs for any missed bundle elements. The transparency of data from the individual patient level to the aggregate unit level allowed unit leadership and the wound care team to easily identify trends or gaps in the HAPI bundle elements and address them in real time. The Braden QD Scoring was also incorporated into the HAPI bundle round report in Epic for ease of use in the identification of patients at risk for HAPIs for unit leadership to more effectively target staff for bundle education rounds and allocate resources to the patients most at risk.",

This goal was a shift from prior years, where a HAC aggregate metric had been the focus of our organization. This shift in focus from a HAC aggregate to HAPI reduction resulted in significantly more attention and engagement in HAPI reduction efforts. Accordingly, inpatient units developed their own HAPI reduction goals, beginning in July 2018. An email was sent to all staff from the executive offices to commend units for their commitment to HAPI reduction, make staff aware of the planned organization-wide efforts to support HAPI reduction, and request that additional unit-based nonenterprise-wide interventions not be deployed without involvement of the enterprise-wide HAPI reduction team.",

Standardization provided 1 standard screening tool, clear alignment between bundle elements and interventions, and real-time education.

Such a \u201cbundle\u201d approach is not uncommon with improvement initiatives. Related, the roll-out of the subinitiative actions occurred in a busy pediatric healthcare system with many competing other initiatives and projects. Therefore, because of issues with the timing of allocation of resources, such as information services, it was not possible or ever envisioned that all of the action plans would be enacted simultaneously. The actions were rolled out over time in an overlapping fashion. In this retrospective look back to review the effectiveness of the overall initiative, the point in time separating the preinitiative to the postinitiative time frames is somewhat arbitrary.
