Our cities are built by and for humans, but are also complex, adaptive biological systems involving a diversity of other living species. The majority of these species are invisible and constitute the city's microbiome. Our design decisions for the built environment shape these invisible populations, and we interact with them on a constant basis. A growing body of evidence shows us that our health and well-being are dependent on these interactions. Indeed, multicellular organisms owe meaningful aspects of their development and phenotype to interactions with the microorganisms-bacteria or fungi-with which they live in continual exchange and symbiosis. While the processing and sequencing of samples can be high-throughput, gathering samples is still very expensive, labor intensive, and can require mobilizing large numbers of volunteers to get a snapshot of the microbial landscape of a city, such as City Sampling Day (metasub.org). Here we postulate that honeybees may be effective collaborators in the sampling process, as they daily forage within a 2-mile radius of their hive. We describe the results of a pilot study conducted with 3 rooftop beehives in Brooklyn, NY, where we evaluated the potential of various hive materials (beeswax, honey, debris, pollen, propolis) to reveal information as to the surrounding metagenomic landscape, and where we conclude that the bee debris are the richest substrate. Based on these results, we profiled 4 additional cities in this manner: Sydney, Melbourne, Venice and Tokyo. While the molecular and computational methods used here were based on DNA analysis, it is possible they could be used to monitor RNA-based viruses such as Sars-Cov-2. Here we present the results of this study, and discuss them in terms of architectural implications, as well as the potential of this method for epidemic surveillance.",

Our cities are built by and for humans, but are also complex, adaptive biological systems involving a diversity of living species (Puppim de Oliveira et al. 2010) . The majority of these species are invisible and constitute the city's microbiome. Our design decisions for the built environment shape these invisible populations, and we interact with them on a constant basis. A growing body of evidence shows us that our health and well-being are dependent on these interactions. Indeed, multicellular organisms owe meaningful aspects of their development and phenotype to interactions with the microorganisms-bacteria or fungi-with which they live in symbiosis. Accumulated evidence confirms that mammalian phenotypes are a combination of an individual's genetic makeup as well as its biome (microbiome and other organisms), including disease states such as obesity (Turnbaugh et al., 2006) and influence on neuro-psychiatric disorders as well (Cryan & Dinan, 2012) . Beyond human consequences, plants' flowering time has been found to depend on the soil microbiome (Wagner et al., 2015) and the useful metabolic compounds in medicinal plants are possibly synthesized in conjunction with their symbiont bacteria (Koberl, Schmidt, Ramadan, Bauer, & Berg, 2013) , both traits were formerly thought to depend only on the plant's genotype. Metagenomic studies such as these are facilitated by the rapidly decreasing cost of high-throughput DNA sequencing and this growing understanding that the phenotype of a multicellular organism depends on both its own genotype and that of its associated microbes leads us to redefine the scope of genetic identity. The holobiont, term which encompasses the notion of host and symbiont, and coined by Lynn Margulis in 1991 (Margulis and Fester 1991) , can now be augmented to define the hologenome.",

            "text": "Metagenomics is a rapidly growing field that is well-situated to survey across all domains and kingdoms of life, including city-scale efforts of urban metagenomics. Microbial classification using high-throughput DNA sequencing is faster and more comprehensive than culture-based methods, and has enabled city-wide mapping of microbial populations (Afshinnekoo 2015 , Hsu 2016 , MetaSUB Consortium, 2016 . Mapping the indoor environments (Lax 2017 , Kembel 2014 ) also provides insights into the relationship between humans and the indoor microbiome, which holds promise for designing buildings that optimize this metric. Thus, we are moving away from the germ-centric paradigm of microbes to the quantification of a ubiquitous, continuous and commensal map of the environmental microbiome within which we live, work, and sleep. While the processing and sequencing of samples can be high-throughput (with automation, hundreds at a time), gathering samples is still very expensive, labor intensive, and can require mobilizing large numbers of volunteers to get a snapshot of the microbial landscape of a city, such as global City Sampling Day (metasub.org). Moreover, samples collected manually with swabs represent a limited area: 0.5-1m 2 . While this scale of resolution is important for applications such as tracking contamination through a hospital, it is not always easily implemented for city-scale studies and leads researchers to look for pinchpoints where samples might be most meaningful. Examples of this have been MetaSub sampling subways, air sampling in indoor environments (J. F. Meadow et al., 2014) , or sewers (Maritz 2017).",

Bee gut commensals were found in low abundance in honey, and include the species identified in the bee samples, described below. Traces of plant DNA were also identified, including Medicago truncatula and Vitis vinifera. The Bee samples ( Fig 1B) contain sequences representative of both Apis mellifera (European honeybee) and Apis dorsata (Giant honeybee), indicating the hives are likely hybrids of these two species. The most abundant microbes in the bee samples include species described as bee commensals such as Snodgrassella alvi and Gilliamella apicola (Kwong & Moran, 2013) , as well as Lactobacillus wkB8 and wkB10 (Kwong, Mancenido, & Moran, 2014) . The bees from AS and FG hives display almost identical species distribution, however the CH sample shows lower abundances of the aforementioned commensals, and includes species absent from the other two. These include Nosema cenarae, a fungal parasite of the honeybee affecting both larvae and adults (Eiri, Suwannapong, Endler, & Nieh, 2015) , as well as various human-related bacteria such as Sporosarcina newyorkensis, isolated from clinical samples in New York State (Wolfgang et al., 2012) and",

This implies that these microbes were constituents of the respective \"microbial clouds\" (Meadow et al., 2015) of these entities and that the bees collect a trace of these clouds. Biological content in the atmospherethe biosphere -was first described in 1978 (Imshenetsky, Lysenko, and Kazakov 1978) and has since been characterized as an integral part of ecosystem function ( see Burrows et al. 2009 for review). The biosphere is an indicator of climate change, for example, increasing frequency of dust storms from the African continent are carrying plant and aquatic pathogens to the Americas, affecting coral populations (Behzad, Mineta, and Gojobori 2018) . Urban aerosols contain a diverse microbial component including species of potential health and bioterrorism concern. This study demonstrates a novel sampling methodology, which reveals that different neighborhoods have different clouds just as different humans do, and that the collected microbiome can reveal information about the built environment and its inhabitants. For example, the Venetian bees carried a signature of wood rot and aquatic species, similar to previous work showing how flooded areas of a city can carry a \"molecular echo\" of the aquatic events of its past (Afshinnekoo et al., 2015) . Indeed, it has been shown that microbial communities can serve as quantitative geochemical indicators (Smith et al., 2015) and the metabolic properties of the recovered communities can yield information about the environment. Furthermore, metagenomic data can be mined for human-health related information (Rosenfeld et al., 2016) . Our ability to recover known bee pathogens as well as virulence factors associated with typhus indicates that this method can serve for early detection of bee-related diseases, and possible human-associated pathogens, in an unprecedented manner. Indeed, insectbased, city-wide microbial monitoring is likely more spatially comprehensive, even if lower resolution, when compared to discrete, human-based sampling techniques, such as swabbing or air-sampling. While the molecular and computational methods used here were based on DNA analysis, it is possible they could be used to monitor RNA-based viruses such as Sars-Cov-2.",

The liquid and solids were then separated, and both were placed into Eppendorfs and placed in the -20\u00b0C freezer so that a freeze-thaw cycle would help disrupt the cell membranes. The bee debris material was then ground with a mortar and pestle to break down any large pieces of bee debris, and resuspended in 1X PBS to bring all of the tubes to a final volume of 20 mL. Then material was then allowed to settle, spun down at 39000 RPM for 20 minutes along with 1-2 grams of 100\u221dm glass beads to further mechanically disrupt the samples. The pellet and a small amount of the supernatant was then used for DNA extraction.",

            "text": "of three independent beekeepers were sampled in New York City. The first location (BK1) were Langstroth hives located in Astoria, Queens, NY. The second location (BK2) were Langstroth and Top Bar hives located in Crown Heights, Brooklyn, NY. The third location (BK3) were Langstroth hives located in Fort Greene, Brooklyn, NY. Samples of honey, bees, bee debris, and swabs of the inside of the hive were collected using sterile one-time-use scrapers and transferred into sterile 50ml Falcon tubes. Australia: Two Langstroth hives in Sydney (SYD1, SYD2) and two in Melbourne (MEL, SH) were sampled. Custom collection trays with self-sealing apertures were developed and fabricated at MIT, and shipped to Sydney and Melbourne for deployment. Trays were installed for 1 week collections, then removed and samples were transferred to sterile 50ml Falcon tubes. Italy -Venice: One Langstroth hive at the Palazzo Mora, Venezia, Italy was sampled. Debris were collected from the hive using a sterile one-time-use scraper and transferred to 50ml Falcon tube. Japan -Tokyo: Samples were collected from 12 hives distributed over 4 neighborhoods. Samples were collected with sterile one-time-use scrapers and stored in sterile 50ml Falcon tubes.
