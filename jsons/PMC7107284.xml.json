Data on age, sex, place of residence, antimicrobial treatment during the previous 8 weeks, the number of AOM episodes during the previous 12 months, current use of day care, and vaccination with PCV7 were obtained at the time of sample collection. In Switzerland, PCV7 was added to the routine vaccination schedule in 2006. Therefore, season 1 (2004\u20132005) was designated as the prevaccine season (Table 1). Of a total of 218 NPS specimens collected during the study period, 153 were selected for this study. Twenty-five and 40 NPS specimens were excluded because they did not have sufficient DNA or were lacking clinical information, respectively.",

Furthermore, age, sex, number of AOM episodes during the previous 12 months and day care use had no influence in the univariate analysis (Supplementary Table 2). Use of weighted distance matrices again revealed a significant difference between infants with AOM and controls (P < .05), but for none of the other factors studied (not shown). This indicates that differences between microbiota were based more on discrepancies related to prevalence of bacterial families (unweighted analysis) than on their relative abundance (weighted analysis).",

The healthy infant microbiota was characterized by the presence of low prevalent bacterial families and nonpneumococcal Streptococcaceae. In infants with AOM, however, the classical AOM pathogens predominated over rare, putative commensal bacterial families. This finding is in line with previous reports using culture- and nonculture- based methods to examine the respiratory tract microbiota [16, 23]. They suggest that a richer and more diverse microbiota may protect against AOM. This is supported by reports about an inhibitory effect of \u03b1-hemolytic streptococci on colonization with AOM pathogens and, thereby, protection against recurrence of AOM [24, 25]. Little is known about the epidemiology and biology of the low prevalent bacterial families living in the nasopharynx, apart from being involved in isolated cases of AOM, opportunistic infections, or bloodstream infections associated with dental procedures [26\u201328].",

In this study, recent antimicrobial treatment was the strongest factor inducing bacterial community changes in the nasopharyngeal microbiota in infants with AOM. Community structure changed toward reduced prevalence of commensal families (Streptococcaceae, including pneumococci and Corynebacteriaceae), increased prevalence of Enterobacteriaceae, and greater relative abundance of Pasteurellaceae. The latter observation has been reported also in earlier culture-based studies [31, 32]. Therefore, antimicrobials change the microbiota toward an unhealthy status with lesser presence of commensals. In general, effects of antibiotic exposure on the microbiota can be expected to depend largely on the prevalence of resistance genes. They may therefore overrule interspecies relationships and may lead to complex and unpredictable changes of the microbiota.",

In our study, having received vaccination with PCV7 and having had samples obtained after the introduction of PCV7 changed the community structure of the microbiota toward reduced prevalence of commensals (Streptococcaceae excluding pneumococci and Corynebacteriaceae). Therefore, unexpectedly, the results indicate that PCV7 drives the microbiotia toward a composition with lower presence of commensals. The mechanisms mediating the influence of PCV7 are not clear, but it may be that pneumococcal serotypes that have emerged under the selection pressure of PCV7 inhibit colonization by commensal Streptococcaceae more than the PCV7 serotypes did.",

The lack of an association with age can be explained by the narrow age range studied. Sociodemographic differences between Switzerland and other countries may be the reason that day care had no measurable influence on the microbiota. A potentially important factor could be concurrent infection with a respiratory virus. In a preliminary study, we analyzed 81 samples from infants with AOM collected from 2004 through 2006 for the presence of RNA viruses, including human rhinovirus, respiratory syncytial virus, coronavirus, and bocavirus. The presence of any of these viruses did not have an effect on the microbiota, either on the prevalence or the abundance of bacterial families (data not presented). In agreement with our preliminary data, no evidence for an association between seasonal shifts in microbiota and the presence of respiratory viruses was found in healthy infants in the Netherlands [29]. However, additional studies are needed to explore the role of viruses in the microbiota in more detail.",

Samples from infants with AOM were restricted to those collected during winter seasons because AOM incidence peaks during winter, and there was no information about diet, number of siblings, or parental smoking, which may all have an influence on the microbiota. The results from our study may therefore not apply to the summer season, as has been shown for healthy controls [29]. The number of controls was small, and samples were collected during a relatively short period after the introduction of PCV7 in a selected geographic region, compared with samples for infants with AOM. However, the results obtained for our control infants resembled closely those described in a recent Dutch study, as discussed above [29]. Another limitation of our study is the lack of high-quality quantitative data on colonization density, because the quantity of bacterial DNA in NPS specimens is very small, which impedes a reliable quantification of the microbiota directly in the sample. However, taking the DNA concentration of the PCR amplification product as a surrogate for colonization density has been described as a reasonable approach [18]. Our results suggest that colonization density is lower in bacterial communities of increased richness, such as the healthy microbiota in the controls. Increased quantities of nontypeable H. influenzae, S. pneumoniae, and M. catarrhalis have been observed in nasopharyngeal secretions during AOM, compared with the healthy status [33]. Therefore, the pathogenesis of AOM may include a disturbance of the interspecies balance with ensuing overgrowth of an AOM pathogen.",
