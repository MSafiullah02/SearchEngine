During an epidemic or pandemic, social distancing should be employed among the general population.7 Social distancing can also be practiced within contained environments (e.g., homes, offices) and shared spaces (e.g., cafeterias, public transit) as well as natural spaces (e.g., parks); however, it can be culturally and socially challenging to enforce. Edicts to close non-essential businesses and cancel community events are employed by various levels of governments in an attempt to implement, or indirectly enforce, social distancing. Social distancing is distinct from self- or group-quarantine, which refers to restricting the movement of asymptomatic people who have been exposed to the disease (e.g., staying at home or some other designated location, having no visitors). It is also distinct from isolation, which refers to keeping people with known infections away from susceptible people.8",

For example, team members that perform the same activities together every day will know one another, and this decreases the likelihood of miscommunication.17 During a pandemic, however, this is simply not realistic, particularly as team members will change secondary to infection, exposure, and burnout. Limiting speaking, and even the volume of our voices (which is associated with droplet and aerosol generation)18,19 in the OR could be important. Limiting the proximity of staff to one another is also important, so that any droplets or aerosols generated by speaking are less likely to move between people. And yet messages must be clear and precise. We frame this issue through four different types of communication identified in OR team dynamics. Proactive, intuitive communication is described first, as an ideal team management strategy during an emergency pandemic response. We then describe three other communication styles observed in OR teams, and why they must be limited during a crisis.17",

This type of communication generally requires team member experience and has often been used by teams working in especially complex procedures or environments. For this reason, it may be most useful in the midst of a pandemic. Notably, this type of communication can be created or reinforced through preoperative preparation. Examples include a shared text message thread reviewing the surgery start time and team member names, or even anticipated surgical challenges; or, a positive hand gesture to confirm the correct completion of a task.

Successful interventions that have reduced OR door-opening and overall traffic provide a reference for changing OR work culture. In a Canadian study,27 key changes that led to decreased OR door-opening included phone communication rather than in-person communication, signs on doors that remind staff to limit traffic, signs on doors requiring staff to log why they are entering or leaving a room, cessation of all traffic through the OR during key surgical periods, and the use of templates or wall-hangings to guide shared tasks.

These areas are often designed to accommodate a relatively large number of people compared with the OR, and we are not necessarily trained or accustomed to extending safety precautions to these areas. We recommend extending the same strategies as discussed above for these areas. This includes posting reminder signs on break room doors and in sub-sterile cores, prohibiting all non-OR personnel from OR hallways, and allowing OR staff to use alternative spaces (e.g., lecture rooms) as break areas to spread out and maintain social distancing.

Par exemple, on peut imaginer un fil de message texto partag\u00e9 passant en revue l\u2019heure de d\u00e9but de la chirurgie et les noms des membres de l\u2019\u00e9quipe, ou m\u00eame les difficult\u00e9s chirurgicales anticip\u00e9es; ou un geste positif afin de confirmer la compl\u00e9tion ad\u00e9quate d\u2019une t\u00e2che. De tels \u00e9changes peuvent contribuer \u00e0 la r\u00e9ussite de la gestion d\u2019\u00e9quipe et ce, sans augmenter le risque d\u2019infection.",
