Since testing began, local procedures and national guidelines have changed in response to changing understanding of the disease and demand for testing. On the evening of 06 February 2020, the UK definition of a suspected case was extended to include people presenting with respiratory illness (defined as cough, shortness of breath or fever with or without other symptoms) returning from or transiting through China including Hong Kong and Macau, Japan, Malaysia, South Korea, Singapore, Taiwan or Thailand within the last 14 days, with the case definition subsequently changing further on 25 February 2020 to include northern Italy, Iran and further countries in SE Asia. As of 27 February 2020, 7690 tests have been performed nationally, of which 15 were positive (0.2%). Initially, testing has been led by clinicians, predominantly by infectious diseases or emergency department physicians, although there are plans to move to a community testing model led by other groups of healthcare professionals, and some regions have already done so. Patients are instructed to self\u2010isolate while results are pending and until their symptoms have resolved, with possible financial and health implications for the 99.8% so far in the UK who have an illness other than COVID\u201019. During the 2009 H1N1 influenza pandemic when a syndromic management strategy with presumptive treatment and self\u2010isolation was used, initial clinical diagnoses of influenza were reported to delay diagnoses of a number of diseases including primary HIV infection7 and Plasmodium falciparum malaria,8 and although scoring systems were developed, it remains difficult to distinguish between viral and bacterial pneumonia on clinical grounds.9 In addition, many mild respiratory viral infections were managed as influenza,10 with significant resource implications, both for healthcare services and for patients.",

Sixty\u2010eight individuals, including 2 children, were tested over 26 days. The majority were ambulant and able to self\u2010isolate and had features consistent with an upper respiratory tract viral infection, or common cold. After the first 10 cases, 6/58 (10.3%) were admitted, at least three of whom only because they lived in shared accommodation where self\u2010isolation was unrealistic, rather than on clinical grounds. This observation supports a community testing approach for the majority. Five of fifty individuals were prescribed antimicrobials without being admitted, emphasising the importance of the availability of clinical decision\u2010makers and prescribers for more unwell patients. None of our cases had severe respiratory illness requiring non\u2010invasive or mechanical ventilation, suggesting it will be rare that patients meeting the definition of a suspected case will require enhanced care, at least while COVID\u201019 itself remains rare in the UK. Some COVID\u201019 case series have suggested up to 20% of cases may require respiratory support,2, 12 although this figure may be influenced by ascertainment bias.

There was a step\u2010change in the number of suspected cases seen after the introduction of the third case definition on the evening of 6 February 2020 as a high number of people with respiratory symptoms and recent travel suddenly became suspected of having COVID\u201019.

Infectious diseases physicians may be the group best placed to support patients in this situation for the short period of self\u2010isolation,13 especially given the need for ongoing personal protective equipment use.14 Although we did not observe any imported \u201ctropical\u201d infections such as dengue, malaria, typhoid, rickettsiosis or leptospirosis, these remain important differential diagnoses in returning travellers from some areas of South\u2010East Asia and may be life\u2010threatening if missed.8, 15 These diagnoses may become more common in this group now that the definition of a suspected case has been expanded to include other countries in South or South\u2010East Asia such as Vietnam.

Additionally, because these patients need to be more pragmatically managed than patients not suspected of COVID\u201019, they may be more likely to be exposed to antimicrobial therapy. There are also significant resource implications not just in terms of PPE use but predominantly in terms of the time required to don and doff PPE for every care interaction from bringing food to routine observations to clinical review.
