All efforts are directed to giving every infant mother\u2019s own milk. In the cohort of 11 infants colonized, all were on mother\u2019s own milk. The second factor described by Cassetari et al. is increased use of antibiotics [8]. There was an ongoing antibiotic stewardship QI at that point and all efforts were being made to reduce antibiotic use in the NICU. The outbreak though involved only colonization, required overtime of staff especially to maintain cohorting and isolation. The outbreak was successfully overcome by reinforcing the existing infection control practices and use of aspetic non-touch technique for fortification of milk and use of distilled water to clean the diaper area.

The source of the MRSA was identified to be 2 healthcare personnel who had nasal colonization and a mother with MRSA in her LSCS wound swab [She had given Kangaroo mother care (KMC) to her infant]. It is highly debatable whether the healthcare personnel caused the MRSA outbreak or contacted MRSA themselves while taking care of infants during the outbreak. The infants who were colonized were cohorted and given surface cleaning with 0.5% chlorhexidine (bio scrub) for 5 d. The healthcare personnel were allotted to other areas and advised nasal mupirocin for 5 d and chlorhexidine bath. They were screened negative before re-entry to the NICU. Lepelletier et al. found that appropriate cohort isolation of neonates and cohort nursing and improving hand hygiene reduced MRSA transmission. Use of mupirocin in staff and patients was not helpful [9]. Parent to child MRSA transmission has also been reported by other authors [10]. This raises the question of routine parental screening. At this point, this requires further evidence for resource allocation to this intervention. After this outbreak, authors made it a policy to counsel all mothers before KMC and inform any of the HCP if they had a pus discharge of the LSCS wound. All healthcare personnel undergo a screening prior to entry to the NICU.",

The source identified was an extra-mural infant whose blood culture grew Acinetobacter sensitive only to colistin. The key reason for the outbreak was that the blood culture of this infant who expired within 24 h of admission was not followed up. The positive culture was seen only during Root cause analysis of the two deaths of babies no. 2 and 3 (Table 4). Both the deaths occurred before the culture was reported positive. The spread of infection was attributed to compromise in CLABSI bundle care and environmental cleaning practices. This is because the nurse numbers were reduced from a total of 42 to 27. An optimal nurse- infant ratio is necessary to ensure patient safety. All infants were in close proximity to the index case in present cohort. Although mechanical ventilation was a common in all 4 of index infants, only 1 of them was exposed to carbapenem. Acinetobacter is known to thrive in environmental surfaces. Pillay et al. reported source of Acinetobater linked to contaminated suction catheters. De Brito et al. found infected neonates were more exposed to carbapenem and mechanical ventilation [11]. The outbreak response was successful as there were no positive cultures at the institution of the responses. Chan et al. described successful control of Acinetobacter infection with no mortality [12].",
