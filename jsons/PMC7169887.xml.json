The incidence of anxiety was higher among female healthcare staff compared to male healthcare staff (26%, 48/187 compared to 12%, 5/43). Because this was self-report of anxiety, it is possible that males may minimize symptoms. The incidence of anxiety among nurses, compared to doctors, was nearly 2-fold (27%, 43/160 compared to 14%, 10/70)(2).",
