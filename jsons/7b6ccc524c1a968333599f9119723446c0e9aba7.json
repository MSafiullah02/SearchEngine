Results: MD simulations and full structure LocalSCF semi-empirical quantum mechanics calculations of receptorligand complexes were carried out to investigate structure-activity relationship for the papain hydrolysis of a set of 23 Nbenzoylglycine esters of type I and various atomic charge and structural parameters of complexes as descriptors. Traditional QSAR descriptors were reinterpreted using detailed structural information. A modreately significant linear regression equations were calculated (Eqs. 1, 2) and it was shown that the pattern of charge distribution on the ester group was different if charges of free or complex ligands were analyzed. The charges of two significant atoms, namely the O1, which is at the reaction center and the C2, were used which are the closest independent non-substituted atom to the substituent, water-shell and torsional angle values as descriptors. The effects of complexation on the electronic structure of ligands were also studied by multivariate analyses (PCA and PCO) and a trend was found for the change of inter-ligand correlation of atomic charges by complexation. The correlation among these charges after complex formation was different for the case of molecules substituted at para-or at dimeta positions. It was suggested that the results can help to understand how traditional QSAR descriptors, e.g., F or s, interact with other electronic effects during complex formation.

The correlation coefficients are greater than 0.99 except that for PBDEs, and the standard deviation is less than 1.83 log units, which is less than error measured by Harner et al. In addition, the computation of molecular connectivity index used in this paper is very simple and the acquisition of data is very easy. Therefore, this method is a viable alternative to predict the octanol-air partition coefficients from molecular structures. (B. B.) Computational methods: Model calculation (EC 50 values of the test compounds were estimated using an house program system and correlated with anti-HIV activity taken from the literature). Data calculated: EC 50 [effective concentration of the test substance (mM) required for 50% inhibition of HIV RT was estimated using an house program system]; W (Wiener index); 1 c (first order molecular connectivity index); A c c [augmented eccentric connectivity index calculated as A c c \u00bc S i \u00bc 1 n (M i /E i ), where M i is the of all degrees of all vertices (\u00dc j ), adjacent to vertex i, E i is the eccentricity, and n is the number of vertices in graph G, for a molecular graph (G), \u00dc 1 , \u00dc 2 , ..., \u00dc n are vertices and the number of first neighbors of a vertex \u00dc i is this vertex]. Results: HIV RT inhibitory activity of 61 acylthiocarbamates of types I and II has been modeled using topological descriptors (W, 1 c, and A c c ) Resulting data were analyzed and predictive models were developed after identification of the active ranges. In the next step biological activity was assigned to each of the compounds using these models which were compared with the reported anti-HIV activity. Very high accuracy of prediction ranging from 95% to 98% was achieved using the developed topological models (n, r, s, and F as well as the analytical form of the model based upon the augmented eccentric topological index is not given).",

Analysis of the structure-activity relationships of the compounds in the active range revealed the following features: activity is shown only by the O-2-(phthalimidoethyl) for the acylthiocarbamates of type II. All compounds of type I having other groups are inactive. Presence of a halogen or a nitro group at position 4 of N-aryl group is important for activity. Among the halogens, chloride is the most suitable. Compounds having halogen or nitro group at other positions are inactive. Compounds having methyl or ethyl group or no substitution at this position are active but are relatively less potent. In general, five compounds in the set are more suitable as acyl group (type II), although compounds displaying a six-member ring, with or without heteroatom, are also active. Amongst five-member heterocyclic rings, activity is better with furfuryl group. The developed topological models possess a useful potential for designing lead structures for development of further potent anti-HIV agents. (B. B.)",

Results: Molecular modelling of human microsomal EH by homology with A. niger EH crystal structure has been carried out to 1.8 resolution. In the homology model the active site lies in a well-defined, essentially hydrophobic, pocket within the enzyme structure. Two tyrosine residues, that are conserved in all known mammalian EH sequences, form hydrogen bonds with the epoxide oxygen atom on the known EH substrate, styrene oxide. A small hydrophobic cleft is present in the active site region, where the phenyl group of styrene oxide can bind, but this cleft appears to be of limited size such that the bulky side-chains of an incoming epoxide molecule may obstruct binding. The inhibitory activity of epoxide hydrolase substrates results from an association between a relatively low Q O value for hydrogen bonding to the active site tyrosines, and a fairly high lipophilicity in the form of logP which is related to a combination of molecular size of the substituent and its overall hydrophobic character. This feature set optimizes affinity for the essentially hydrophobic active site region lined by complementary amino acid residues such as leucine, methionine and tryptophan. Consequently, logP/QO provided a relevant descriptor for the explanation of potency differences with the set of epoxides, as shown by Eqs. 1 -4.

Results: QSAR and classification models have been developed for a novel set of COX-2 selective inhibitors of types I -V employing SVM methodology. Each compound was described by CODESSA descriptors.

The approach yielded a seven-descriptor model based on SVMs with root mean-square errors of 0.107 and 0.136mM for training and prediction sets, respectively. The best classification results were derived using SVMs. . Results: A QSAR study of novel antibacterial BSFQs obtained by the derivatization of N4-piperazinyl atom of ciprofloxacin (CIP) has been performed. The behavior of the new BSFQ series was similar to the studied previously norfloxacin (NOR) analogs allowing the QSAR analysis of a complete set of BSFQs. Hansch analysis of the activity data showed a linear correlation of the activity with electronic and steric parameters. Small electron-donor groups increased the in vitro activity against Gram-positive bacteria. Hydrophobic properties played a relatively minor role in modulating MIC values, while lipophilic parameters obtained from HPLC turned to be more reliable descriptors. In this study the amino-and the methylamino derivatives were the most active analogs. Single parameter regression equations for pMIC were statistically poor. The best multilinear regression equations were the followings (Eqs. 1 -5): ",

These equations can allow formulation scientists to rapidly estimate the potential of HP-b-CD in increasing solubility of poorly water-soluble drugs at the early stage of drug development. The role of the selected descriptors in model description selected could be reasonably rationalized. As for the effect of hydrogen bonding and cohesive forces on the solubility of drug-CD complexed species, it seems very complicated and difficult to understand. (B. B.)",

Results: General and class-specific QSPR models have been developed for soil sorption (logK OC ) of 344 organic pollutants (0 < logK OC < 4.94) using a large diverse set of theoretical molecular descriptors based only on molecular structure. Two general QSAR models were obtained. The two-parameter Model_1 (logP and h ) was derived for a structurally representative set of 68 chemicals showing R 2 \u00bc 0.76 and s \u00bc 0.44 statistical parameters. The four-parameter Model_2 (logP, PNSA-1, h , p max p-p ) involved a total of 344 compounds displaying R 2 \u00bc 0.76 and s \u00bc 0.41 parameters. Fig. 1 shows the plot of the calculated versus experimental logK OC values by Model_2 for 344 pollutants, where three compounds denoted by lines (near circles) had the largest residuals. Model_1 was validated using the test set comprising the remaining 276 pollutants (R 2 \u00bc 0.70, s \u00bc 0.45). An additional validation of both models was carried out employing an inde-pendent set of 48 pollutants. Both Model_1 and Model_2 predicted the logK OC values at the level of experimental precision. The theoretical molecular descriptors used in the QSPR models yielded further insight into the mechanisms of soil sorption. Analysis of the distribution of the residuals of the logK OC values calculated by both general models indicated the need and possible advantages of modeling soil sorption for smaller data sets of individual classes of organic pollutants. Accordingly, QSPR models were also developed for the 14 individual chemical classes. The descriptors used in these models were examined and related to the possible interaction mechanisms in soil sorption. The major molecular properties relevant to soil sorption were hydrophobicity, size and shape of the compounds and charge distribution. A larger size and bulkier shape favor nonspecific interactions with the soil constituents and the humic matrix. The charge distribution describes nonspecific polar and specific interactions.

The QSPR model has been developed using MLR and a set of molecular descriptors of the alcohols calculated using AM1 and ab initio methods. Statistically highly significant liner regression equations were obtained for the retention times. (Partial Least Squares projections to latent structures analysis performed using SIMCA-P v9.0); LOO (Leave-One-Out cross-validation). Data calculated: Descriptors (a total of 162 descriptors were calculated using the AM1 method and 121 descriptors using the B3LYP/6-31G** method: 4 descriptors based on molecular orbital energies, 31 descriptors based on charge distribution, 75 descriptors based on molecular surface area and net atomic charges, 41 descriptors based on molecular orbital wave functions and energies, 11 geometrical descriptors); logP (logarithm of the partition coefficient in 1 octanol/water calculated using PALLAS v3.0); RMSE (root mean square error of the fit); r 2 cv (cross-validated correlation coefficient performed using MINITAB v13.1); q 2 (cross-validated correlation coefficient for the PLS model). Results: The electronic descriptors of the compounds in a large and chemically diverse organic compound set was calculated using semiempirical and ab initio methods for the development of toxicological quantitative structure-activity rela-tionships models employing MLR and PLS analyses. The use of logP in a single parameter regression equation yielded the following regression equation (8 outliers were omitted) (Eq. 1). pLC 50 \u00bc 0.700 (AE 0.022) logP \u00c0 0.720 (AE 0.058) (1) n \u00bc 560 r \u00bc 0.806 s \u00bc 0.803 F \u00bc 1034 r 2 cv \u00bc 0.647 Fig. 1 shows the plot between pLC 50 versus logP, where the outliers were denoted by empty circles. Statistically similar and significant models were obtained using AM1 and B3LYP calculated descriptors and in addition calculated logP values. The quality of the models derived using the two sets of quantum chemical descriptors depended mainly on the type of descriptors employed. It was found that for modeling large data sets (n \u00bc 568) irrespective of the mechanism of toxic action, the use of precise but computer time demanding ab initio descriptors did not offer considerable advantage over the semiempirical ones. For the best MLR models the following statistical parameters were obtained (model, descriptor calculation method, number of parameters, r 2 , r 2 cv , s, (the PETRA program package employs various physicochemical methods for the calculation of atomic physicochemical properties of organic compounds, e.g., total, s-and p-charge distribution, atomic polarizability, lone-pair sand p electronegativities, and molecular properties such as hat of formation, molecular polarizability, etc.); T i (Hotelling score calculated by a method utilized for the determination of the prediction space covered by the developed models based on the Hotellings T 2 statistic including PCA). Results: Structure descriptors were employed to discriminate between modes of toxic action of phenols utilizing two classification models based on a data set of 220 phenols with four associated MOAs. CPG NN and multinom were used as classification methods. The combination of topological autocorrelation of empirical p-charge and s-electronegativity and of surface autocorrelation of hydrogen-bonding potential yielded a 21-dimensional model that significantly discriminated between the four MOAs. Fig. 1 shows the PCA-score plot of the training set with 21 descriptors, where the ellipse defines the 95% confidence region (full circles, full triangles, x signs, and open triangles denote polar narcotics, uncouplers, proelectrophiles, and soft electrophiles, respectively. The calculation of such descriptors was very fast which made them ideal for screening of databases. The predictive power of the approach was found to be equal to previously published quantum mechanical based descriptors. The overall predictive power of the approach was estimated to be 92% using 5-fold CV. In the next step, a simple score value for the distance to the training data was used to determine the prediction space of the model and employed in a study of the phenols included in the NCI database. The use of a prediction space metric was proved to be an essential requisite for the screening of this very diverse database. The prediction space covered by the developed model was rather limited due either to the limited diversity and size of the training set or to the high dimensionality of the descriptors employed.

Results: Upon sunlight exposure, PAHs undergo rapid structural modification generally via oxidation reactions. The modified products are in many cases more toxic than their parent compounds. The toxicity is due to the p-orbital system of PAHs, which strongly absorbs in the UV and visible regions of the solar spectrum. In this study a QSAR study of 67 PAHs has been performed and a prediction rule for the phototoxicity of these compounds was proposed. EHOMO, ELU-MO and GAP were used as descriptors. The relationships between these molecular descriptors and the photo-induced toxicity were found to be non-linear, and Gaussian type functions were used to linearize them. Statistically significant PLS models were calculated and the models were validated by predicting the phototoxicity for a set of molecules not used in model development. Pentaphene of type I, benzo[b]chrysene of type II, and dibenz [a.j] anthracene were among the compounds potentially phototoxic as predicted by the model. A new GAP range (7.2 AE 0.7 eV) was proposed for the classification of phototoxic compounds, and a larger cutoff was suggested for the normalized lethal time as log(1/ALT) \u00c0 2.95. An unscaled regression equation was obtained from the PLS model (Eq. 1) by using a routine for unscaling the regression vector obtained from autoscaled data.",

The data matrix (735 \u00c2 1350 dimension) was subjected to PCA. PCA explained 95% of the variances in the matrix by the first 137 principal components (PCs). ER, CR, and GA were employed to select the best PCs for PC-ANN modeling. In the ER-PC-ANN approach, the PCs were stepwise entered into the ANN based on their decreasing eigenvalue. In the CR-PC-ANN, the ANN was first employed to model the nonlinear relationship between each one of the PCs and the carcinogen activities separately. In the next step, the PCs were ranked based on their decreasing correlating ability and entered to the input layer of the ANN one after another. Finally, GA was used to find the best set of PCs. Both external and cross-validation methods were used to validate the predictive performances of the derived models (model, r 2 cv , RMSE cv ): ER-PC-ANN, 0.714, 1.89; CR-PC-ANN, 0.911, 0.95; PC-GA-ANN, 0.922, 0.88).

In this paper a nonlinear model equation based on tissue composition (a content of lipids, proteins, and water) for the tissue-blood partition coefficients of compounds was further developed to account for the neutral and ionized forms of the compounds (the complex equations of the nonlinear model are given).

Results: Glycogen phosphorylase (GP a ) is an attractive target for the design of inhibitors that may prevent glycogenolysis at high glucose levels in type II diabetes. The carboxamides represent one of the major classes of GP inhibitors other than glucose derivatives. In this study CoMFA methodology and docking of ligands into GP a was performed in order to elucidate the essential structural and physicochemical requirements responsible for binding to the GPa enzyme and to develop predictive models for designing indole-2-carboxamide derivatives. The Common Feature Hypothesis approach generated 10 hypotheses containing the RHDA, RHDD, HHDA, or HHDD features. All 25 molecules belonging to the training and test sets mapped every feature of all hypotheses.

In this study molecular-modeling based design, synthesis, and evaluation of activity of substituted piperidines of type I, as g-secretase inhibitors, has been performed. A pharmacophore has been derived based on type I and used in a ROCS search of a corporate database yielding type II. A set of g-secretase inhibitors has been designed based on the scaffold of type II. Fig. 1 shows the schematic view of the developed pharmacophore overlaid on compound of type I, shown as the low-energy conformer. Three of the designed analogs of type III showed moderate g-secretase inhibitory activity (EC 50 \u00bc 3.5 -20.9mM; EC 50 of type I % 0.1mM). The data suggested that the compounds acted via g-secretase inhibition. The measured g-secretase inhibitory activity within this small library validated the usefulness of the ROCS search design strategy. (B. B.)",

Data determined: IC 50 [concentration of the test substance (mM) required for 50% inhibition of the production of PGHS-1 and PGHS-2 using immortalized mouse PGHS-1 and PGHS-2 cells]; IC 50 [concentration of the test substance (mg/mL) required for eliciting 50% cytotoxic effect measured using colorimetric method]. Computational methods: Molecular modeling [initial structures of eight naphthol compounds of type I were generated by molecular model-ing software Sybyl v6.8.21, geometry optimization of the structures was performed using the semiempirical AM1 method, binding conformations of naphthol derivatives with COX-2 and COX-1 were studied employing AutoDock v3.0.5 using LGA in conjunction with an empirical force field to calculate ligand free energy of binding, the Kollman-all-atom charges were assigned to enzyme electrostatic contributions whereas Gasteiger H\u00fcckel charges were assigned to all ligands, the docking simulations reproduced the co-crystals of burbiprofen and SC-558 bound to COX-1 and COX-2 enzymes with RMSD value of 0.7 for both cases (references: 1eqh and 1cx2, respectively), the Au-toDock method and the parameter set employed was extended to search the enzyme binding conformations for other inhibitors]; AUTO-DOCK (automated docking program using a Metropolis Monte Carlo algorithm of simulated annealing for positional and conformational searching in combination with a rapid energy evaluation through precalculated grids of molecular affinity potentials allowing the inclusion of van der Waals, electrostatic, and hydrogen bonding interactions); GA (Genetic Algorithm is a stochastic optimization method that mimics the process of evolution by manipulating a collection of data structures called chromosomes); LGA (Lamarckian Genetic Algorithm). Data calculated: rmsd [root mean square deviation () of the position of the corresponding atoms of two superimposed molecular structures]. Results: Structure-activity relationships of the inhibitory effects of 2-substituted-1-naphthol derivatives against COX-1 and COX-2 were investigated using receptor docking methods. Five compounds showed preferential inhibition of COX-2 over COX-1, while three compounds lacked inhibitory effect on either the COX-1 or COX-2 isozyme. Results of the docking experiments with these naphthols indicated that the presence of hydroxyl group at C-1 position on the naphthalene nucleus enhanced the anti-inflammatory activity towards COX-2 via hydrogen bonding to the COX-2 Val 523 side chain. When this hydroxyl group was replaced by methoxy group, there was no inhibition. Introduction of C-2' dimethyl substituents onto the propyl chain also increased the inhibitory activity. All active compounds possess the C-1 hydroxyl group aligned so as to form hydrogen bond with Val 523 . Fig. 1 shows the orientation of the docked compound of type I substituted with (CH 2 ) 3 )OH group in the position b. The hydrogen bonding interaction with Val 523 is shown near arrow. The results provided a model for the binding of the naphthol derivatives to COX-2 which should be very useful to design more potent COX-2 and selective COX inhibitors.

PCA of the data matrix of 70 carbapenem analogs and 72 Volsurf descriptors yielded 5 PCs (PC, explained variance, cumulated value): PC1, 45.62, 45.62; PC2, 15.09, 60.72; PC3, 9.62, 70.33; 7.44, 77.79; 6.64, 84.41 , respectively. The PC score plots showed clustering of compounds according to the activity. The PC loading plots explained the Volsurf descriptors responsible for the separation and behaviour of the compounds. PLS analysis yielded two significant models (species, q 2 , r 2 , N opt , SDEP, SDEC, % of variance): S. aureus, 0. 684, 0.883, 7, 0.276, 0.168, 79.13; E. coli, 0.514, 0.756, 6, 0.271, 0.192, 81.22 . Both the PCA and PLS models were validated by an external test set of 15 carbapenem analogs. All the compounds of the test set were predicted fairly well showing residual values less than one log unit. Fig. 1 shows the PLS coefficient plot for the correlation of Volsurf descriptors for S. aureus. The MIC activity data of S. aureus (Gram positive) was better explained than E. coli (Gram negative) by the PLS models. Fig. 2 shows the plot of experimental versus calculated activities of S. aureus obtained by PLS analysis, where the triangles show the predictions of the training set and stars show the data for the test set compounds.",

Classification models were also developed predicting selectivity for pcDHFR over rlDHFR using SIMCA methodology, with a selectivity ratio of 2 (IC 50 rlDHFR/IC 50 pcDHFR) for delimiting classes. A 5-component model including steric and electrostatic molecule field contributions displayed cross-validated and test set classification rates of 0.67 and 0.68 for selective inhibitors, and 0.85 and 0.72 for unselective inhibitors. It was concluded that the predictive power of the CoMSIA and SIMCA classification models, together with the structural insights derived from them, might aid in the design of novel inhibitors used against P. carinii infections in immuno-compromised states.

Results: A GRIND-derived pharmacophore model has been developed for a set of a-tropanyl derivative ligands of type I of the sigma-2 receptor using GRIND descriptors. Statistically significant PLS models for were calculated for sigma-2 affinity. Sigma-2 model: r 2 \u00bc 0.83, q 2 \u00bc 0.63) and S (sigma-1/ sigma-2 selectivity): r 2 \u00bc 0.72, q 2 \u00bc 0.46 were derived using a training set of a-tropanyl derivatives. The models provide pictures of the virtual receptor site (VRS) providing a qualitative pharmacophoric representation of the sigma receptor. The analysis performed using the GRIND descriptors has confirmed the presence of two hydrophobic areas and a Hbond donor moiety in the binding site of the sigma receptor, interacting with the lipophilic groups and the electron-rich center of the molecules. They modeled the internal geometrical relationships within two hydrophobic areas (hydrophobic-1 and -2) and a H-bond donor receptor region with which ligands establish non-covalent bonds. Fig. 1 shows the proposed geometrical relationship and maps of the main interaction areas for the s-receptor. The obtained PLS model predicts the sigma-2 activity of the a-tropanyl derivatives involved in the study, while results from the selectivity analysis highlight the distance within the two hydrophobic areas as the major sensitive element for sigma selectivity. [program for finding potential docking sites on proteins of known structure by starting with solvent accessible surface, and filling cavities with overlapping spheres to make binding pockets, ligands of known structure (e.g., found by searching a database) are then automatically docked into this site]. Data calculated: Shape of Signature (the shape signature is a histogram representation the ray segment lengths obtained from the ray tracing within the SAV of a molecule, a shape signature which contains only the length of information is termed a 1D signature, the 2D-MEP signatures encoding both segment length and electrostatic potential information associated with the point of incidence inside the SAV); . Results: Enrichment of ligands has been performed for the serotonin receptor using the Shape Signatures approach, a new 3-dimensional molecular comparison method adapted here to rank ligands of the serotonin receptors. The approach was exemplified using a variety of test databases including the mixture of agonists and antagonists together with approximately 10 000 randomly chosen compounds from the NCI database. Both ID and 2D Shape Signature databases were compiled for the enrichment studies, and key parameters for searching and matching the molecules were determined. It was found that the ID Shape Signature approach is highly efficient in separating agonists from a mixture of molecules which includes compounds randomly selected from the NCI database taken as inactives. The method was also equally effective at separating agonists and antagonists from a pool of active ligands for the serotonin receptor. The influence of conformational variation of the shape signature on enrichment was studied by docking a subset of ligands into the crystal structure of serotonin N-acetyltransferase (code: 1IB1). Enrichment studies using the resulting \"docked\" conformations yielded only slightly improved results compared with the CORINA-generated conformations. Fig. 1 shows the comparison between CORINA generated and docked conformations, where black circles and gray squares denote 2D and 1D scores. Parallel enrichment studies were carried out using 2D shape signatures showing high selectivity with more restricted coverage due to the high specificity of 2D {Spearmans rank correlation coefficient r s \u00bc 1 \u00c0 [6 \u00b7 S i d 2 i /n(n 2 \u00c0 1)], where d i is the difference between two ranks at the point i and n is the total number of points}; rmsd [root mean square deviation () of the position of the corresponding atoms of two superimposed molecular structures]. Results: In order to identify novel chemical classes of factor Xa inhibitors, five scoring functions were employed to evaluate the docking poses generated by FlexX. The compound collection was composed of 549 confirmed potent factor Xa inhibitors and a subset of the LeadQuest screening compound library. Four scoring functions but PMF successfully reproduced the crystal complex (PDB code: 1FAX). This was unexpected since PMF was parametrized on crystal complexes. Fig. 1 shows the representative poses generated by FlexX in reference to co-crystallized DX-9565a. After docking and scoring by different methods FlexX exhibited the highest hit rate enrichment in the entire screening process, followed by D-SCORE and ChemScore. Hit rate enrichments by G-SCORE and PMF were comparatively moderate. The hit rate of 80% was achieved by FlexX at an energy cutoff of \u00c0 40 kJ/mol, which is about 40-fold over random screening (2.06%). The study suggested that presenting more poses of a single molecule to the scoring functions could deteriorate their enrichment factors. A series of potential factor Xa inhibitors was identified from LeadQuest with a potential capability of replacing the benzamidine moiety, yielding compounds with improved pharmacokinetic properties. Several promising scaffolds with favorable binding scores were identified from LeadQuest. Consensus scoring by pair-wise intersection failed to enrich the hit rate yielded by single scorings (i.e. FlexX). It was cautioned that reported successes of consensus scoring in hit rate enrichment could be artificial because their comparisons were based on a selected subset of single scoring and a reduced subset of double or triple scoring. The findings obtained in this study were based upon a single biological system. (B. B.) ",
