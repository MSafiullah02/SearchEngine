            "text": "Mortality from coronavirus disease 2019 is strongly associated with cardiovascular disease, diabetes, and hypertension. These disorders share underlying pathophysiology related to the renin-angiotensin system (RAS) that may be clinically insightful. In particular, activity of the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) is dysregulated in cardiovascular disease, and this enzyme is used by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) to initiate the infection. Cardiovascular disease and pharmacologic RAS inhibition both increase ACE2 levels, which may increase the virulence of SARS-CoV-2 within the lung and heart. Conversely, mechanistic evidence from related coronaviruses suggests that SARS-CoV-2 infection may downregulate ACE2, leading to toxic overaccumulation of Angiotensin II that induces acute respiratory distress syndrome and fulminant myocarditis. RAS inhibition could mitigate this effect. With conflicting mechanistic evidence, we propose key clinical research priorities necessary to clarify the role of RAS inhibition in COVID-19 mortality that could be rapidly addressed by the international research community.",

            "text": "Multiple early reports of the novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) identified a strong association between cardiovascular disease (CVD) and mortality in infected patients. In an analysis of 45,000 confirmed cases in China, the crude case fatality rate was 0.9% for patients without any documented comorbidities, whereas the case fatality rate was much higher for patients with CVD (10.5%), diabetes (7.3%), or hypertension (6.3%) [1] . This pattern threatens extensive mortality worldwide given the high prevalence of these disorders, but may also be clinically insightful as these conditions share pathophysiologic mechanisms that could underly heterogeneity in COVID-19 outcomes. It is possible that this comorbidity pattern is simply an artifact of confounding by age or underlying pulmonary disease, in which case fatality rates from COVID-19 may rise as its incidence increases in countries with older populations. However, COVID-19 does not follow the bimodal age distribution that is typically seen in viral pneumonias due to relative immunocompromise [2] , and it is unclear if young children are spared from most COVID-19 symptoms due to cross-protective immunity to other coronaviruses or from additional differences in physiology related to age. Conversely, the association between CVD, CVD risk factors, and mortality from COVID-19 may be related to differential expression or function of angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), which is the functional receptor for SARS-CoV-2 [3] . This latter mechanism warrants urgent attention from the international research community. In this report, we highlight important known and unknown features of COVID-19 related to ACE2 and RAS activity and suggest clinical research strategies to clarify the role of RAS blockade in COVID-19.",

In particular, hospital-based cohorts will exhibit selection bias for sicker patients, which is likely to bias results towards the null hypothesis (i.e., no effect of RAS blockade) if patients with the least prominent risk factors are underrepresented. Significant confounding likely exists that could also obscure the direct effect of RAS blockade, notably confounding by disease indication.

In admitted patients who test positive for SARS-CoV-2, we would want to compare the risk of severe disease versus mild disease associated with current use of RAS blockade at admission. Because most patients who die from COVID-19 appear to develop ARDS as they decompensate, the definition of severe disease should include death, need for intensive care and organ support such as mechanical ventilation, or acute respiratory distress syndrome. Some centers are anecdotally reporting de novo cardiomyopathy; if this is true, this too should be considered in the definition of severe disease, although the mechanism could differ, and it is unclear if cardiomyopathy associated with COVID-19 occurs in the absence of ARDS. The definition of RAS blockade exposure could also vary, given that patients may be on different drug classes (i.e., ACEi or ARBs), with different doses, and with different time courses of exposure to the drug. All of these exposure parameters are important and should be considered, but a preliminary analysis with RAS blockade exposure defined at admission as a binary variable would be an important first step.",
