Viral hemorrhagic fevers have threatened combat, peacekeeping, and training operations for decades in areas such as the Balkans (Dobrava virus), Korea (Hantaan virus) and the South Pacific (dengue virus) and, as a result, have motivated the development of preventive measures. Consequently, the first study in the BD/EID Program area was a collaboration between the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID) Vaccine Research Center and military investigators on the safety and immunogenicity of Ebola and Marburg DNA vaccines, assessed at a WRAIR collaborative field site at Makerere University in Kampala, Uganda. The results showed that, given separately or together, both investigational DNA vaccines, one encoding Ebola virus Zaire and Sudan glycoproteins and one encoding Marburg virus glycoprotein, were well-tolerated and elicited antigen-specific humoral and cellular immune responses.3 These findings contributed to the accelerated development of more potent Ebola virus vaccines that encode the same wild-type glycoprotein antigens that were tested during the 2013\u201316 Ebola virus disease outbreak in West Africa.4,5",

IDCRP investigators participated in the prioritization effort and the IDCRP\u2019s team at the Walter Reed National Military Medical Center served as the only DoD site participating in the protocol: a randomized controlled trial of the monoclonal antibody ZMapp for treatment of Ebola virus disease.

Nevertheless, because of ongoing concerns of bioterrorism, the U.S. military continues to vaccinate at-risk operational forces, some healthcare workers, and service members in Korea.8 During the last decade, over one million individuals received the vaccine, which is made from the Vaccinia virus. In addition to conferring protection against smallpox, the Vaccinia virus demonstrated promise as a vaccine-delivery system, inducing immunity to pathogens such as HIV. As a result, another early study assessed host immune factors that might attenuate the response to vaccinations. Because of its potential use in HIV candidate vaccines, investigators at the IDCRP and the Military HIV Research Program, with support from the U.S. Military Vaccine Agency, evaluated the potential impact of pre-existing immunity to Vaccinia with the use of Vaccinia-vectored vaccines in a cell-based infection model. Using longitudinal sera from military personnel who had been vaccinated, the investigators found that serum antibody responses to smallpox vaccination did not persist over extended periods of time (e.g., 5 years post-vaccination), suggesting that prior vaccination for smallpox might not interfere with the effectiveness of novel vaccines using Vaccinia virus as a vector.9",

Given limitations on the availability of laboratory testing, U.S. (and DoD) policy precludes testing of asymptomatic men for diagnosis of ZIKV infection. To date, there have been 175 confirmed ZIKV cases in the MHS, primarily in deployers and travelers to Puerto Rico and South America.18 Following the ZIKV outbreaks, there was a recognized need for establishing means for conducting active surveillance of ZIKV (and related arboviruses, such as dengue and chikungunya) among MHS beneficiaries in a disease-endemic location to better prepare for any subsequent re-emergence of these diseases. To this end, the EIDAR team, in collaboration with the WRAIR Viral Diseases Branch, developed a prospective protocol to conduct surveillance of ZIKV and related arboviral infections among active-duty service members and their dependents presenting with symptoms at the Rodriguez Army Health Clinic in Puerto Rico. This study will allow early detection of outbreaks among MHS beneficiaries on the island, assessment of impact on military readiness, and ready reporting to Force Health Protection officials.",

            "text": "In addition to vector-borne tropical infectious diseases, diarrheal disease is another major threat to U.S. military operations worldwide; however, further investigation is merited to determine the potential long-term health consequences of severe gastrointestinal infections. The impact on military medical readiness of diarrheal illness (travelers\u2019 diarrhea) encountered during overseas deployments is a well-characterized Force Health Protection issue and is a major focus for prevention and treatment research within the IDCRP Deployment and Travel-Related Infection Research Area.21\u201323 In contrast, less is known about the deleterious health consequences associated with outbreaks of enteric diseases among military populations at installations within the continental United States. Moreover, mounting evidence reported in the literature, primarily from epidemiological studies among civilian populations impacted by diarrheal disease outbreaks, suggests post-infectious sequelae (medical complications observed following infection) is a growing concern.24\u201326 Shiga Toxin-Producing Escherichia coli (STEC) infection, a major cause of foodborne illness in the United States and associated with consuming undercooked beef, is linked to life-threatening complications manifesting in the acute phase of infection as severe hemorrhagic colitis and hemolytic uremic syndrome, as well as lesser known sequelae emerging months to years later.27",

The overall objective is to determine the incidence of post-infectious sequelae, including functional bowel disorders (irritable bowel syndrome, dyspepsia, constipation), osteoarticular symptoms (reactive arthritis and avascular necrosis), and renovascular disease (hypertension and chronic kidney disease) in Marines identified as STEC cases during the outbreak relative to non-ill matched controls. A series of analytic modeling approaches will be used to develop a risk model health outcomes risk score to determine how comorbidities, demographics, and other factors affect risk for developing post-infectious sequelae. This health outcomes risk score could be a Force Health Protection tool for identifying individuals at greatest risk for long-term complications in military populations affected by future diarrheal illness outbreaks.",

Co-morbidities may differ in a military population compared to the general public, especially in combat-related trauma patients and, thus, may affect outcomes differently in this population.39 The impact of in vitro resistance in a military population has not been evaluated.
