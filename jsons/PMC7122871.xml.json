The naming system specifies that each herpesvirus should be named after the taxon to which its primary host belongs. The herpesvirus is followed by an Arabic number, e.g., Herpesvirus 1. However, human herpesviruses represent an exception, as a number are better known by other names (e.g., Epstein\u2013Barr virus) so that it is impractical to insist on a change into how they are referred. This has led to a dual nomenclature for some herpesviruses; however, all new herpesviruses described since this system was adopted are named in accordance with it.

All herpesviruses are nuclear replicating, i.e., the viral DNA is transcribed to mRNA within the infected cell\u2019s nucleus and the mRNA gene products promote the replication of the viral DNA. Infection is initiated when a viral particle contacts a cell with specific types of cell surface membrane receptors. Following binding of viral envelope glycoproteins to their receptors, the virion is internalized and dismantled, so that viral DNA can migrate to the cell nucleus where replication of viral DNA and transcription of viral genes occur.",

In some host cells, a small number of viral genes termed latency-associated transcripts (LAT) accumulate and allow the virus to persist in the host cell indefinitely. During latency, the infected host is asymptomatic, but reactivation of latent viruses can result in disease. In such case, the transcription of latency-associated LAT genes switches to that of lytic genes that lead to enhanced virus production and cell death. Symptoms and signs may include low-grade fever, headache, sore throat, and rash, as well as lymphadenopathy and reduced levels of circulating immune cells. Infection is long lived, as viral DNA persist in dormant states within sensory nerves and ganglia. HSV-1 reactivation begins in peripheral nerve cells, and viruses are transported via sensory nerve axons to mucosal surfaces, where they can produce vesicular eruptions.",

Newborn infants are particularly at risk and may develop disseminated disease with pulmonary infiltrates and mortality rates (even following acyclovir therapy) approaching 30 % (Kimberlin 2004). In adults, HSV is isolated from secretions in ~30 % of mechanically ventilated patients, and evidence suggests that Herpesviruses may be an important factor in severe exacerbations of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (Gu and Korteweg 2007). Dyspnea, cough, and hypoxemia are common in this setting. Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS) can develop with virulent herpetic infection, and bacterial and fungal superinfections are both common and can be fatal when they supervene. Herpesvirus can also complicate ARDS (Byers et al. 1996).",

Diagnostic cytopathic changes include the presence of either type A or type B Cowdry nuclear inclusions, molding of adjacent cells, and multikaryon formation (Fig. 6.5). When there is extensive necrosis, immunohistochemistry for herpes viral antigen will often demonstrate intense background staining.

They present late in the course of HIV infection and are profoundly immunocompromised at the time of presentation. Patients who are HIV negative are mostly elderly and often of Mediterranean origin (Ferry et al. 2008; Klepfish et al. 2001; Nador et al. 1996). Patients present with a pleural effusion, pericardial effusion, or ascites. By definition, there is no discrete contiguous lymphomatous mass associated with the effusion. PEL has a poor prognosis, although among HIV+ patients, the outcome may be better for those receiving highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) (Boulanger et al. 2005).

            "text": "The neoplastic cells of primary effusion lymphoma are either uniform and immunoblast like or very large and pleomorphic (Fig. 6.7a, b). Some are multinucleated and may resemble Reed\u2013Sternberg cells. Neoplastic cells express CD45, as well as activation antigens, including CD30, without expression of B-cell-specific markers. Despite the absence of B-cell antigens, immunoglobulin heavy and light chains are clonally rearranged, thereby supporting a B lineage. Occasionally there is aberrant expression of T-cell-associated antigens (Said and Cesarman 2008). Tumor cells are often coinfected with EBV. Like HHV-8, EBV is a gamma herpesvirus closely related to HHV-8 (Cesarman et al. 1995; Cesarman and Knowles 1997; Chadburn et al. 2004). The neoplastic cells are also bcl6-, MUM1/IRF4+, and CD138+, corresponding to a late stage in B-cell differentiation (Carbone et al. 2000). MUM1/IRF4 has been shown to downregulate cellular response to interferon, at least in vitro. It is possible that MUM1/IRF4 expression by the neoplastic cells plays a role in allowing the virally infected tumor cells to escape from interferon-mediated control (Carbone et al. 2000). HHV-8 may also downregulate expression of major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I surface molecules, allowing HHV8-infected cells to escape killing by cytotoxic T cells (Sirianni et al. 2005). HHV8 infection may be associated with impaired natural killer (NK) cell activity (Sirianni et al. 2005). These features, in combination with the tendency of primary effusion lymphoma to occur at a late stage in the course of HIV infection, contribute to the very poor prognosis associated with this lymphoma.\n",

It is frequently associated with mutations in the 5\u2032 noncoding regions of BCL6 (Antinori et al. 1999) as well as in the immunoglobulin gene variable (IGV) regions (Hamoudi et al. 2004). BCL6 and IGV mutations are considered to indicate transition of B cells through the germinal center, and in conjunction with the immunophenotype, the genetic changes provide additional support for a late, post-germinal center stage of maturation for the neoplastic cells of primary effusion lymphoma in most cases. Gene expression profile analysis shows that primary effusion lymphoma shares features of AIDS-associated immunoblastic lymphoma and plasma cell myeloma and is quite different from other types of B-cell lymphomas (Jenner and Boshoff 2002; Klein et al. 2003). There is in addition a specific set of genes unique to primary effusion lymphoma (Klein et al. 2003). Thus, both immunophenotype and genetic features indicate that the neoplastic cells of primary effusion lymphoma correspond to a late stage in B-cell differentiation. It is proposed that HHV8, utilizing some of the genes in the B-cell program of its host, drives the cells it occupies toward plasma cells (Jenner and Boshoff 2002).",
