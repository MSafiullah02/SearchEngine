We also observed multiple events of syncytia 139 formation between IECs in both 2D monolayer (Fig. S2B ) and in 3D Matrigel (Fig. S2C  140 and Video S1). The cell fusion and subsequent cytopathic effect may have important 141 implications regarding the common GI symptoms seen in COVID-19 patients (25) (26) (27) (28) (29) . TMPRSS4 and matriptase (encoded by ST14) shared a highly specific expression pattern 149 in human IECs (Fig. 3A) . Previous studies indicated that both TMPRSS4 and ST14 150 facilitate influenza A virus but neither play a role in SARS-CoV infection (31-34). Notably, 151 in our mouse scRNA-seq dataset, both TMPRSS4 and ST14 were found to be present in 152 mature enterocytes and had an increased co-expression pattern with ACE2 than 153 TMPRSS2 (Fig. S3A) . 154",

While TMPRSS2 alone did not mediate viral infection, co-expression of TMPRSS2 159 significantly enhanced ACE2-mediated infectivity (Fig. 3B) . Importantly, we found that 160 expression of TMPRSS4 but not ST14 also resulted in a significant increase in the levels of viral RNA and infectious virus titers in the presence of ACE2 ( Fig. 3B and S3C) . 162 TMPRSS4 and TMPRSS2 had an additive effect and mediated the maximal infectivity in 163 cell culture ( Fig. 3B and S3C-E) . 164 165 We reasoned that TMPRSS4 may function as a cell surface serine protease that 166 enhances S cleavage to promote viral entry. To test this hypothesis, we co-expressed a 167 C-terminally Strep-tagged full-length SARS-CoV-2 S protein in an HEK293 cell line that 168 stably expresses ACE2 with or without additional introduction of TMPRSS2 or TMPRSS4. 169",

Human enteric 231 viruses that spread via the fecal-oral route typically withstand the harsh environment in 232 the GI tract, including the low pH of gastric fluids, bile and digestive enzymes in the small 233 intestine, dehydration and exposure to multiple bacterial by-products in the colon. We 234 sought to investigate the stability of SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 chimera viruses in 235 different human gastric and intestinal fluids. Compared to rotavirus, a prototypic human 236 enteric virus known to successfully transmit fecal-orally (40), both CoV chimera viruses 237 quickly lost infectivity in a low pH condition (Fig. S5A). However, SARS-CoV-2-S exhibited 238 greater stability than SARS-CoV-S in human small intestinal fluids that contain biological 239surfactants including taurocholic acid sodium salt and lecithin(Fig. 5A). Interestingly, 240 SARS-CoV-2-S chimera virus was not resistant to certain components in the human 241 colonic fluids(Fig. 5A). The virus titers decreased by 100-fold within 1 hour and no 242 infectious virus was detectable at the 24 hour time point(Fig. 5A).

Due to the limitation of sample size, we cannot definitely conclude that fecal-261 oral transmission of COVID-19 does not exist. However, our data is consistent with the 262 previous reports from SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV publications which concluded that 263 despite long duration of viral RNA shedding, no infectious virus could be recovered from 264 the patients' feces (41, 42). 265 266 Intriguingly, the small intestinal fluids, which contain taurocholic acid sodium salt and 267 lecithin, important surfactant components of the bile, did not inactivate virus as expected 268 (Fig. 5A). In addition, we also observed that the virus titers did not drop in the presence 269 of 0.03% bovine bile (data not shown), the highest concentration that did not induce 270 cytotoxicity, contradicting the known fragility of lipid bilayers and sensitivity to bile salts 271 which serve as detergents in gut. Recent studies showed a heavy glycosylation of SARS-272 CoV-2 S protein (43) and it is possible the sugar coating conferred some stability against 273 the enzymatic digestion and bile salt solubilization. Two recent publications did 274 demonstrate that SARS-CoV-2 has unique stability in the environment, at least in a colonic fluids that are absent from small intestinal fluids function to potentially disrupt viral 277 lipid membranes in vivo. 278 279 Mechanistically, recent work from multiple groups showed a key role of TMPRSS2 in 280 cleaving SARS-CoV-2 S protein. Here, we provide data that besides TMPRSS2, 281TMPRSS4 also increases SARS-CoV-2 infectivity, at least in gut epithelial cells(Fig. 3-282 4). We observed an intriguing additive effect of the two enzymes, as both target single 283 arginine or lysine residues (R/K\u2193). One may speculate that this synergy stems from a 284 distinct subcellular localization in neighboring cells(Fig. 4A). Future work with 285 recombinant proteins and enzymatic digestion may help address whether S cleavage is 286 sequential and whether the two enzymes act on different sites on the S protein.287 288Finally, we observed strong syncytia formation in human enteroids(Fig. S2B-C). These 289 results may have great implications for virus cell-cell spread and evasion from antibody 290 neutralization (46).

For confocal microscopy, enteroids were seeded into 8-well Nunc chamber 372 slides (Thermo Fisher), cultured under maintenance or differentiation conditioned, 373infected with SARS-CoV-2 chimera virus, and fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde as 374 previously described (48). Samples were then stained with the following primary375 antibodies or fluorescent dyes: ACE2 (sc-390851 AF594, Santa Cruz), DAPI (P36962, 376 Thermo Fisher), SARS-CoV-2 S (CR3022 human monoclonal antibody (51)), Villin (sc-377 58897 AF488, Santa Cruz), and phalloidin (Alexa 647-conjugated, Thermo Fisher). 378 Stained cells were washed with PBS, whole mounted with Antifade Mountant, and imaged 379 with Zeiss LSM880 Confocal Microscope at the Molecular Microbiology imaging core 380 facility at Washington University in St. Louis. Z-stack was applied for imaging 3D human 381 enteroids.

Cells were stained with LIVE/DEAD Aqua 387 Dead Cell Stain Kit (Thermo Fisher) and live cells were sorted using a BD FACSAria II 388 flow cytometer. Preparation of single cell suspensions was performed at the Stanford 389 single-cell RNA-sequencing using Chromium Single Cell 3). The Cell Ranger package (v3.0.2) was used to align 394 high quality reads to the mouse genome (mm10). Normalized log expression values were 395 calculated using the scran package (53). Highly variable genes were identified using the 396 FindVariableGenes function (Seurat, v2.1) as described (54). Batch effects from technical 397 replicates were removed using the MNN algorithm as implemented in the batchelor 398 package's (v1.0.1) fastMNN function. Imputed expression values were calculated using a 399 customized implementation (https://github.com/kbrulois/magicBatch) of the MAGIC 400 (Markov Affinity-based Graph Imputation of Cells) algorithm (55) and optimized 401 parameters (t = 2, k = 9, ka = 3). Cells were classified as dividing or resting using a pooled 402 expression value for cell cycle genes (Satija Lab Website: regev_lab_cell_cycle_genes). 403 For UMAP and tSpace embeddings, cell cycle effects were removed by splitting the data 404 into dividing and resting cells and using the fastMNN function to align the dividing cells 405 with their resting counterparts. Dimensionality reduction was performed using the UMAP 406 algorithm and nearest neighbor alignments for trajectory inference and vascular modeling 407 were calculated using the tSpace algorithm. Pooled expression of all viral genes was 408 calculated using the AddModuleScore function from the Seurat package. appreciate the assistance from Matthew Williams (Molecular Microbiology 419 Media and Glassware Facility), Wandy Betty (Molecular Microbiology Imaging Facility), 420 Roseanne Zhao (Division of Rheumatology) and Philip Mudd (Division of Emergency 421 Medicine) for fecal specimen collection.
