            "text": "Toroviruses (ToVs) are enveloped, positive-stranded polyadenylated RNA viruses and are classified as the second genus in the family of Coronaviridae, order Nidovirales that contains many important pathogens. Toroviruses infect both animals and humans and are associated predominantly with enteric diseases (Koopmans and Horzinek, 1994). The first report of ToVs described the identification of the Berne virus in 1972 from a rectal swab of a horse with diarrhea in Berne, Switzerland (Weiss et al., 1983). A decade later, a virus that was related morphologically and antigenically to the Berne virus, which was designated the Breda virus (BToV) and Breda virus-like particles, was described in the stools of neonatal calves and children (Beards et al., 1984, Woode et al., 1982). A porcine torovirus (PToV) has been identified and characterized in the feces of swine (Kroneman et al., 1998). Toroviruses have been established as infectious gastrointestinal agents in cattle and as a predominant cause of acute enteric infections in piglets (Ito et al., 2007, Kroneman et al., 1998). Significantly, zoonosis was possibly implicated when ToV-like particles detected in patients with gastroenteritis exhibited similar morphology and cross-reacted with BToV, which supports the need for continuous monitoring of potential zoonotic infection with ToVs (Hoet and Saif, 2004).",

Real-time RT-PCR is a more recent method that is more sensitive than EM and conventional RT-PCR for quantitating virus load, pathogenesis studies and identification of virus latency (Glass et al., 2000, Park et al., 2009). Real-time RT-PCR is relatively easy to perform and has a high-throughput capacity as reported with other viruses using SYBR Green chemistry and/or the TaqMan assay (Chun et al., 2010, Park et al., 2009). As far as we know, there is only one report describing the use of real-time RT-PCR for the detection of PToV (Pignatelli et al., 2010). There is no report of the use of real-time RT-PCR for BToV.",

All reactions were performed using a Corbett Research Rotor-Gene 6000 series Real-Time Amplification system (Corbett Research, Mortlake, Australia) and SensiMix one-step RT-PCR kit with SYBR Green (Quantace, London, UK). Optimization of primer concentration was achieved using RNA from positive fecal samples. Reactions were run using primer concentrations from 0.3 to 0.9 \u03bcM. A concentration of 0.5 \u03bcM of each primer was found to give the highest sensitivity. Real-time RT-PCR was performed with a final volume of 25 \u03bcl containing 5 \u03bcl of RNA template, 12.5 \u03bcl of SensiMix one-step mixture, 1 \u03bcl each of 0.5 \u03bcM forward and reverse primers (final concentration of each primer: 20 nM), 0.5 \u03bcl of 50\u00d7 SYBR Green solution (final concentration: 1\u00d7), 0.5 \u03bcl of RNase inhibitor (final concentration: 10 units), 0.5 \u03bcl of MgCl2 (final concentration: 4.0 mM) and 4 \u03bcl of RNase-free water. Reverse transcription was carried out at 42 \u00b0C for 30 min, followed by the activation of the hot-start DNA polymerase at 95 \u00b0C for 10 min and 45 three-step cycles: 94 \u00b0C for 15 s, 50 \u00b0C for 45 s and 72 \u00b0C for 20 s. To perform the melting curve analysis, after 45 reaction cycles, the temperature ramp was programmed from 72 to 95 \u00b0C in increments of 1 \u00b0C, waiting 5 s before each acquisition. Samples were considered positive if both an exponential increase of fluorescence and a BToV- or PToV-specific melting peak were observed. Quantitative detection of ToVs was averaged from three independent runs with duplicate reactions.",

Amplicons of the expected size by SYBR Green real-time RT-PCR were visualized by gel electrophoresis (Fig. 1C and F). Standard curves with a higher correlation coefficient (R\n2\n > 0.97) and slope values of 3.42 and 3.33 (Fig. 1B and E) were generated using a serial dilution of in vitro BToV and PToV RNA transcripts, respectively. The standard RNA subjected to SYBR Green real-time RT-PCR presented a specific fluorescence signal and Ct values between 3.7 and 34.6 for BToV and between 6.8 and 39.8 for PToV (data not shown). The intra-assay reproducibility showed that at the highest dilution where cRNA was detected, both replicates were found positive for BToV or PToV. At the 10\u22121 dilution containing cRNA copies, 100% reproducibility was achieved for the two viruses.

The primer pair for the SYBR Green-based real-time RT-PCR assay was designed to target sequences centered on the conserved M gene. The conserved stretches in a portion of the M gene have shown high homology among the published BToV and PToV isolates and, with the nucleocapsid gene, was thought to be the most sensitive and specific detection genes for both viruses in fecal samples (Ito et al., 2007, Pignatelli et al., 2009). Using both target genes, the detection of BToV or PToV by real-time RT-PCR was demonstrated to be specific and sensitive in this study and in another study (Pignatelli et al., 2010). The findings of the present study proved the application and efficiency of using one primer pair for the detection of two viruses. However, the results showed a higher analytical sensitivity of BToVs over PToVs. The detection of a larger amplicon size that was >70 bp (187 bp), and the positive weaker amplicons in the case of PToVs could have possibly affected the melt rate and phenomenon of dye translocation, which consequently affected SYBR Green binding and detection (Varga and James, 2006).",

The M gene region has different GC/AT ratios in BToV and PToV. Accordingly, the functions of the GC/AT ratio, length and sequence can be demonstrated by melting curve analysis and can be used to differentiate amplification products with <2 \u00b0C intervals in melting temperature (Ririe et al., 1997). Melting curve analysis of the in vitro transcripts showed a difference of only 1 \u00b0C between BToV and PToV, and, using the field samples, melting curve analysis showed overlapping temperature ranges for BToV (74.7\u201379.7 \u00b0C) and PToV (73.9\u201378.1 \u00b0C). From this, it can be inferred that the differentiation between BToV and PToV by the current real-time RT-PCR assay becomes more difficult to determine and insignificant. Nonetheless, the desired products can be distinguished from undesirable products, and in many cases the need for gel electrophoresis is eliminated (Ririe et al., 1997). The samples that showed close melting temperature with the no-template control were reconsidered positive as they showed a good level of viral copies and a clear band after electrophoresis. In this study, all of the real-time RT-PCR samples tested were verified by electrophoresis and sequencing.",

At present, the SYBR Green RT-PCR assay is 1000 and 10,000 times more sensitive than BToV and PToV detection by conventional RT-PCR, respectively, and 100 times more sensitive than nested PCR for both viruses when using cRNA. Therefore, the one-step SYBR Green quantitative real-time RT-PCR assay is significantly superior (P\n < 0.05) to the other PCR assays in terms of sensitivity, specificity and quantitative linearity. The short amplicons in the real-time PCR assays used in this study likely resulted in more efficient amplification and higher analytical sensitivity. Despite the shorter amplicon size in PToV nested PCR, the real-time PCR reproduced amplicons with greater analytical sensitivity. Taken together, these observations indicate that the SYBR Green-based RT-PCR assay is a useful and reliable method for the detection of BToV and PToV.",

Porcine toroviruses were detected in 5% of the diarrhea specimens of piglets in Hungary (Matiz et al., 2002), 23.7% in Japan (Kiriwasa et al., 2007), and 6.4% in South Korea (Shin et al., 2010). Using the same South Korean bovine and porcine fecal samples (Park et al., 2008, Shin et al., 2010), SYBR Green real-time RT-PCR assay detected BToVs in 18.2% and PToVs in 36.0% of the samples. These findings support the above suggestion that SYBR Green real-time RT-PCR is more sensitive than conventional RT-PCR and nested PCR. In addition, these observations indicate that the fecal prevalence of BToV and PToV in calves and piglets might be higher than previously reported in South Korea (Park et al., 2008, Shin et al., 2010).",

Interestingly, those fecal samples that tested positive only by SYBR Green real-time RT-PCR contained lower numbers of BToV and PToV RNA (3.4 \u00d7 102\u20131.2 \u00d7 104 and 3.1 \u00d7 103\u20133.9 \u00d7 104 viral copies per reaction, respectively). These diarrhea specimens with lower number of ToVs were co-infected with other enteric pathogens, including BCoV, BRVA and/or BVDV in the bovine fecal samples, and PRV A\u2013C in the porcine fecal samples (data not shown). Therefore, it can be presumed that BToV or PToV can either induce diarrhea alone, or can play a role in accelerating the clinical and pathological presentation of diarrhea with the other pathogens (Hoet et al., 2003, Kiriwasa et al., 2007, Park et al., 2009, Shin et al., 2010).",
