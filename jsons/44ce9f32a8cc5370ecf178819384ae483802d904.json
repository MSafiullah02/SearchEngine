To provide information for clinicians, the following recommendations are based on the consensus opinion of members of the dermatology expert committee of the Light Treatment Effectiveness (LITE) study, a pragmatic trial of home versus office narrowband UVB phototherapy in 1,050 patients at approximately 30 sites across the US (1). The committee consists of dermatologists who have long standing expertise in the management of patients on phototherapy.",

Currently, the risk of spreading COVID-19 in a shared phototherapy setting is unknown. The germicidal property of ultraviolet (UV) light may be helpful in limiting COVID-19 in the phototherapy unit. UVC has been used for decontamination of N95 filtering facepiece respirators during the pandemic (2) . Based on extrapolation of 254 nm UVC virus inactivation data using viruses other than SARS-CoV-2, solar radiation, including UVB and UVA, has been estimated to also have virucidal effect (3) . Office phototherapy is generally not the only option; therefore, risks and benefits of options, including home phototherapy and judicial exposure to natural sunlight, should be weighed. For sites providing targeted phototherapy service (excimer laser or light), for the safety of the staff, treatment of facial lesions should be minimized, or if possible, avoided.",
