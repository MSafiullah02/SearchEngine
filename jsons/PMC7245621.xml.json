            "text": "Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) is typically defined as an inflammatory pulmonary edema resulting from an acute damage of the alveoli [1, 2]. Mechanical ventilation, improving the severe hypoxemia and reducing the work of breathing, remains the cornerstone of ARDS management [3, 4]. However, ARDS is still accompanied with a mortality rate higher than 40% [5]. The mechanical forces generated during the mechanical ventilation by the interaction between the ventilator and the respiratory system can damage the lung, a process that has been called ventilator-induced lung injury (VILI) [6\u20138]. Previous randomized studies and retrospective data showed that excessive tidal volume, driving pressure, and positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) were related to a poor outcome [9\u201312]. Differently, lower respiratory rates and lower peak inspiratory pressures were associated with a decrease in-hospital mortality [13].",

According to the classical equation of motion of the respiratory system, the energy applied to the respiratory system, per unit of time, depends on the mechanical properties of the lung (elastance and resistance), the applied tidal volume, the inspiratory flow, and the PEEP level [18]. For example, a reduction of the tidal volume together with an increase of the respiratory rate could increase or decrease the total energy delivered to the lung [16]. Experimental data, based on lung CT scan characteristics, suggested that a mechanical power higher of 12 J/min could generate VILI, irrespective of the different combinations of each component [17]. Thus, mechanical power should be superior to each of the individual components of the ventilator setting in modulating the final effect on the VILI [15]. However, no human data are available on the safe threshold of mechanical power for the developing of VILI.",

However, similar values of mechanical power could result in different effects on the respiratory system, according both to the dimension of the ventilated lung (i.e., size of the baby lung) and to the relationship between lung and chest wall elastance (i.e., transpulmonary pressure) [16, 20\u201323]. In fact, for similar values of mechanical power, a higher or lower energy could be delivered respectively in case of a smaller or larger ventilated lung surface. Zhang et al., normalizing the mechanical power to the predicted body weight, as a surrogate of the lung size, reported that the normalized mechanical power better predicts in-hospital mortality [24].",

Third, the mechanical power was normalized only considering indexes reflecting static conditions (compliance, lung size, and amount of well-inflated tissue).
