The intermediate is resolved by a condensation reaction when Cys-sulfenic acid reacts with a Cys in the C-terminal distal domain of a second inverted Prx molecule, thus forming a dimer linked by two disulfide bridges [17], [33]. Reduction of the Prx dimer regenerates the Prx monomer and in most cases the physiological hydrogen donor is thioredoxin, but this may also be performed by tryparedoxin or glutathione [17]. Thioredoxin itself is maintained in the reduced state by electrons transferred from NADPH by thioredoxin reductase [4], [5], [21], [33].",

Infective parasites (metacercariae) excyst from a dormant state following ingestion and penetrate the intestinal wall before migrating to the liver. In this nutrient and oxygen rich environment the parasites undergo rapid growth and development, and energy is supplied by aerobic respiration [9], [31]. As part of its antioxidant defence, F. hepatica expresses glutathione-S-transferase and superoxide dismutase, which detoxify ROS to hydrogen peroxide [1], [2], [21]. The pathway of hydrogen peroxide detoxification is unclear, since the liver fluke lacks catalase and exhibits little glutathione peroxidase activity [1], [2], [24]. Our laboratory was the first to describe the presence of Prxs in helminth parasites when we reported the isolation of a cDNA encoding this enzyme in F. hepatica\n[23]. Since these enzymes can detoxify hydrogen peroxide we suggested that Prx performs this function in F. hepatica, and other helminths that lack catalase [23], [24].",

When examined by SDS\u2013PAGE under non-reducing conditions, the FhePrx enzyme migrated close to the 50 kDa molecular size marker indicating that the recombinant protein forms a dimeric enzyme containing a reactive center (Fig. 1B, lane 1). This was confirmed firstly by reduction of the inter-subunit disulfide bridges, and thereby splitting the two monomers, by addition of a small dithiol, DTT, to the sample prior to electrophoresis (Fig. 1B, lane 2). Addition of hydrogen peroxide to the recombinant FhePrx caused the dimer to migrate as two bands, one slightly slower than that seen in lane 1, presumably because either one or two covalent disulfide linkages were formed between the monomers with corresponding conformation rearrangements (Fig. 1B, lane 5) [16]. However, somewhat surprisingly, the addition of DTT before or after the addition of hydrogen peroxide to the recombinant FhePrx (Fig. 1B, lanes 3 and 4) did not increase the amount of monomeric form. It was expected that the reduced active site residues, Cys-SH, would react with the hydrogen peroxide to form the sulfenic acid derivative, Cys-SOH, which is resolved by dimerisation, and that addition of DTT should reduce the disulfide bonds to give rise to a monomeric form; however, this did not occur and the protein migrated similarly to that observed when hydrogen peroxide was added alone (Fig. 1B, compared lanes 3 and 4 with 5). It is possible that under the experimental conditions hydrogen peroxide reacted directly with DTT and prevented its capacity to reduce the active site cysteines. Dimer formation was also confirmed by gel permeation chromatography which showed that recombinant FhePrx eluted at a molecular weight of approximately 50 kDa (data not shown). Gel permeation chromatography also detected high molecular sized forms of the FhePrx (not shown) and some material is retained on the top of the gels lanes in the non-reducing SDS\u2013PAGE analysis that is reducible by DTT (Fig. 1B, see lanes 1 and 2); this likely corresponds to a decameric form of the FhePrx which is known to exist for other Prxs, and is important in regulating the activity of the enzymes [17], [33].",

Moreover, FhePrx may appear in the ES products due to the continual sloughing and replacement of the parasite tegumental and/or intestinal cells [9]. We investigated the possibility that FhePrx is a non-classically secreted protein using the SecretomeP 2.0 server [www.cbs.dtu.dk/services/SecretomeP/, Ref. 14]. The analysis of FhePrx returned a value of 0.527, compared to a threshold value of 0.5, which indicates it is possible that the enzyme is secreted without a signal peptide, but the probability is not high. In contrast, a similar analysis of the schistosome egg Prx (Genbank Accession No. AF121199) which is known to be secreted returned a value of 0.622, indicating a higher probability of secretion. FhePrx is expressed by all stages of the developing parasite, including the earliest infectious larvae, and antibodies are detected in serum both during acute infection and at low levels in chronic disease (not shown).",

Addition of recombinant FhePrx with DTT to the reaction tube protected the plasmid from nicking (Fig. 3A, lane 4), since this did not occur when DTT was substituted by ascorbic acid (Fig. 3A, lane 5) the activity of FhePrx is, therefore, thiol-dependent. The anti-nicking activity was FhePrx-specific, as another F. hepatica recombinant protein, cathepsin L1 [7], did not protect plasmid DNA from nicking (Fig. 3A, lane 6). Although cathepsin L1 was expressed in the yeast Pichia pastoris, the active enzyme is His-tagged and was purified in an identical manner to FhePrx. Also, incubation of the plasmid DNA with another E. coli-expressed recombinant protein, the surface antigen of Toxoplasma gondii, gave the same result as the cathepsin L1 negative control. Our data supports that of Salazar-Calderon and coworkers [28] who demonstrated that a recombinant F. hepatica thioredoxin peroxidase fused to GST was able to protect inactivation of glutamine synthetase and enolase when subjected to FeCl3-induced oxidative stress.",

Therefore FhePrx, which is 67% identical to SmPrx 2 on the amino acid level, was tested for glutathione affinity. We found that recombinant FhePrx was not active with glutathione (concentration ranging from 0.1 mM to 1 mM) and glutathione reductase (0.2 U) (Fig. 3B) as the addition of FhePrx failed to increase activity over the background rate of NADPH consumption. By preparing truncated recombinant versions of SmPrx 2 and SmPrx 3, Sayed and Williams [29] showed that the affinity for glutathione was dependent on the 22 amino acid C-terminal tail. In addition, another schistosome Prx, SmPrx 1, that lacks this C-terminal tail exhibited no affinity for glutathione [29]. In the Prx II group of peroxiredoxins, which includes SmPrx2 and FhePrx, the C-terminus is known to form a well-ordered helix, which stabilizes the C-terminal arm and reduces mobility [29], [33]. The FhePrx C-terminal tail contains the conserved Tyr-Phe motif at residues 89 and 90, and is predicted to form a helical structure from residues 183\u2013194 by the PredictProtein server [www.predictprotein.org, Ref. 27]. However, the C-terminal tails of SmPrx 2 and FhePrx are only 55% identical on the amino acid level and this sequence variation between the S. mansoni and F. hepatica enzymes may account for the difference in C-terminal arm mobility, resulting in differences in glutathione affinity.",

            "text": "The steady-state kinetics of FhePrx were analysed by measuring initial rates of FhePrx activity using varying concentrations of substrates hydrogen peroxide and reduced thioredoxin. Two substrate enzyme reactions can be described by the equation of Dalziel (1) [10].(1)E/v0=\u03d50+\u03d51/[A]+\u03d52/[B]+\u03d51,2/[A][B]where E is total enzyme molarity, v\n0 is initial rate, A is concentration of hydrogen peroxide, B is concentration of thioredoxin, and \u03d5\n0, \u03d5\n1, \u03d5\n2 and \u03d5\n1,2 are constants associated with the enzyme\u2013substrate affinity. The results were plotted as total enzyme molarity divided by initial rate versus the reciprocal of the hydrogen peroxide concentration (Fig. 4\nA). With typical peroxidase kinetics, regression lines of the primary data are parallel, however in Fig. 4A the lines are convergent. In secondary plots, the slopes and intercepts of the curves from the primary data were plotted against the reciprocal of the reduced thioredoxin concentration and values for constants \u03d5\n0, \u03d5\n1, \u03d5\n2, and \u03d5\n1,2 were derived [10]. The first order rate constant \u03d5\n0 is the reciprocal of k\ncat, in non-saturable kinetics, k\ncat approaches infinity, and the value of the reciprocal is zero. The \u03d5\n0 value obtained for FhePrx is 0.0538 s and therefore finite, supporting previous conclusions that FhePrx is saturable and has Michaelis\u2013Menten type kinetics. The constant \u03d5\n1 refers to the affinity of the enzyme for the hydrogen peroxide substrate and \u03d5\n2 refers to affinity of the oxidized enzyme for reduced thioredoxin. The value for \u03d5\n1 for FhePrx is 0.105 \u03bcM s\u22121 and is relatively low compared to that reported for Prx enzymes of schistosomes [28], bacteria and protozoa [16]. The significance of this relative low rate of association of reduced FhePrx for hydrogen peroxide is unknown, but these rates can differ by several orders of magnitude between Prxs of various species and may reflect differences in the levels of substrate in the particular microenvironment in which the enzymes function. Alternatively, the reported rates of association for hydrogen peroxide for Prxs of various sources may also be an artifact of recombinant protein production and/or the capacity of these proteins to form dimers or decamers. However, the \u03d5\n2 constant of 0.173 \u03bcM s\u22121 for the F. hepatica enzyme is similar to values for other peroxiredoxins, indicating that regeneration of the reduced enzyme likely occurs at a similar rate [17]. The third order rate constant \u03d5\n1,2 was calculated as 12.42 \u03bcM2\n s\u22121, it is surprising that our analysis yields a term for a ternary complex as nearly all kinetic evidence for reaction order in peroxiredoxins suggest that the detoxification of hydrogen peroxide occurs as two half reactions [17]. There are two possible explanations for deviation from a typical double displacement mechanism: (1) thioredoxin interacts with Prx before hydrogen peroxide can be attacked, in which case a type of ternary complex is formed. Thioredoxin certainly does interact with Prx, but all experimental evidence to date indicates that the function of thioredoxin is to provide reducing power in the regeneration of Prx [4] and no evidence of an intermediate in which Prx is interacting with both substrates simultaneously has been reported (2) Prx has an apparent single-displacement mechanism, which deviates from double displacement mechanism for a biologically significant reason. There is precedence for deviation from typical peroxidase kinetics, the kinetics of S. mansoni Prx 2 and 3 [29] and the mitochondrial tnpx of Leishmania infantum\n[17] do not conform to a double displacement mechanism. Reasons for a change in kinetic pattern could be (1) enzymatic activity is dependent on decameric versus dimeric conformation [17], [33] and conformational changes of recombinant Prx versus native molecules are responsible, (2) sensitivity to hydrogen peroxide substrate, especially at higher concentrations of thioredoxin, alters the rates or (3) as the coupled enzyme reaction relies on the E. coli-derived thioredoxin and thioredoxin peroxidase, the use of the F. hepatica enzymes could result in a different pattern.",

            "text": "Many eukaryotic 2-Cys Prxs are sensitive to high levels of hydrogen peroxide due to over-oxidation of the peroxidatic cysteine to sulfinic acid, which cannot be rapidly reduced again, resulting in inactivation of the enzyme [17], [32], [33]. In the presence of high concentrations of hydrogen peroxide the effective concentration of the enzyme is reduced. We observed that FhePrx activity is subject to over-oxidation at hydrogen peroxide concentrations of 500 \u03bcM and greater (Fig. 4B). We further investigated the sensitivity of FhePrx to over-oxidation by determining the reaction rates of the enzyme at increasing hydrogen peroxide concentration. The rates of inactivation, determined by the ratio of the rate at each given time to the initial rate, were plotted against the concentration of hydrogen peroxide (Fig. 4C). The steep slope of the curve is consistent with an enzyme that is rapidly inactivated and is comparable to data reported for sensitive Prxs such as the schistosome Prx 2 and Prx 3 and human Prx 1 [29], [32].",

However, given that F. hepatica parasites lack catalase activity and express minimal levels of glutathione peroxidase [1], [2], [23] the Prx system must be a requirement for detoxification of metabolically-produced hydrogen peroxide in this parasite. The cells of the liver fluke may be under particular oxidative stress during migration in the host at which time (approximately 8 weeks) metabolic processes (catabolism of host proteins and anabolism of parasite proteins) result in growth from <1 mm to >1.5 cm in length [11]. The high affinity of FhePrx for hydrogen peroxide, the concentration required to obtain half maximal rate (K\nm) is 30 \u03bcM, coupled with the high abundance of enzyme in parasite cells, is sufficient to maintain peroxide levels below toxic levels, 120\u2013150 \u03bcM [25]. Recently, Sayed and Williams [30] demonstrated that knocking down Prx activity by interference RNA techniques in larvae of S. mansoni resulted in an increase in parasite mortality by seven-fold; although Prx 1 dsRNA was used for silencing, reduction in both Prx 1 and Prx 2 expression was observed.",

The FhePrx is abundant in the parasite tissues, and is also secreted by the parasite [13], [18], [26], despite lacking a signal sequence, which suggests that the anti-oxidant functions outside the parasite. We and others have speculated that this function may include the inactivation of ROS released by immune effector cells such as eosinophils, neutrophils and macrophages, although there is no supporting evidence for this function [2], [17], [26]. However, we have recently shown that injection of partially purified native FhePrx or recombinant FhePrx into mice induced the recruitment of alternatively activated host macrophages [13]. The mechanism by which FhePrx exerts its function on macrophages needs to be elucidated but this may be via binding to specific surface receptors and/or drawing on emerging new functions of Prx in signal transduction [12], altering hydrogen peroxide levels on the extracellular surface of the cells.",
