            "text": "There is an increasing interest in detecting viruses in oral fluid. Oral fluid is defined as the fluid obtained from the mouth by an absorptive device (Atkinson et al., 1993). The composition of oral fluid is influenced by the location of the absorptive device in the mouth, the method of collection, as well as the collection device (Atkinson et al., 1993). Oral fluid is composed of mostly saliva from the salivary glands and serum transudate that crosses the oral mucosa and contains high levels of mucin, glycoproteins and enzymes such as amylases, proteases, lipases, RNAses (Prickett and Zimmerman, 2010). As viruses enter the oral cavity via serum, the tonsils, the upper and lower respiratory tracts, and environmental contamination, PCR based assays have been used to detect nucleic acid from pathogenic viruses such as coronavirus, Ebola virus, hepatitis E virus, human herpes virus, and measles virus in oral fluids from humans (Collot et al., 2002, Formenty et al., 2006, Furuta et al., 2004, Matsubayashi et al., 2008, Wang et al., 2004) and swine pathogens such as foot-and-mouth disease virus, influenza A virus, porcine circovirus, porcine respiratory and reproductive syndrome virus (PRRSV), and Torque teno virus in oral fluid from pigs (Ebl\u00e9 et al., 2004, Prickett et al., 2008, Ramirez et al., 2012). Oral fluid sampling is considered an efficient and cost effective approach for surveillance of viruses in swine herds (Prickett and Zimmerman, 2010, Ramirez et al., 2012).",

            "text": "Hepatitis E virus (HEV) is a zoonotic virus and there are increasing reports of hepatitis E infections in humans in industrialized countries (Meng, 2011). HEV is widespread in swine herds but pigs are asymptomatic carriers or experience subclinical infections (Meng, 2011). Leblanc et al. (2007) reported that 98% of swine in a herd shed HEV in fecal material at some point between 2 and 29 weeks of age. HEV is transmitted through the fecal oral route (Bouwknegt et al., 2009, Kasorndorkbua et al., 2004) and pigs can be infected via direct contact with fecal material or by consuming feed or water contaminated with fecal material containing HEV (Leblanc et al., 2007). As pigs are imported and exported extensively, improved control for infected animals is recommended (Rutjes et al., 2007). While there is a lack of information on the prevalence of HEV in oral fluid from pigs, HEV is detectable in porcine tonsil tissue and salivary glands (Banks et al., 2004, Leblanc et al., 2010, Williams et al., 2001) at levels ranging from 1 \u00d7 103 to 9.9 \u00d7 105 genome copies (gc)/g of tissue (Leblanc et al., 2010). Furthermore, HEV RNA was detected in human saliva from an individual suffering from acute HEV where HEV RNA remained detectable in saliva, feces and serum until 71, 85 and 97 days, respectively, after transmission, suggesting the potential for the transmission of HEV also via the oral\u2013oral route between humans (Matsubayashi et al., 2008).",

There are a number of advantages of detecting viruses in oral fluid over serum because of the ease of collecting the sample, the minimal discomfort of the subjects, it is non-invasive and cost effective. While the detection of viruses in oral fluid is an attractive possibility, there are concerns about the stability of viral RNA in the presence of salivary enzymes, proteins and cellular debris and information on optimal handling methods such as heat treatments, freezing and RNA stabilization agents is needed (Decorte et al., 2013, Roy et al., 1999). The objectives of the study were to determine optimum handling conditions of the oral fluid before RNA extraction and to compare the performance of the RNeasy Protect Saliva Mini kit, which contains a stabilizing agent, with that of the QIAamp Viral RNA Mini kit, which does not contain a stabilizing agent.",

Oral fluid contains degradative enzymes and some studies have suggested that a heat treatment may inactivate salivary enzymes and prevent degradation of viral RNA (Roy et al., 1999). Gomes-Kellar et al. (2006) incubated feline saliva samples at 42 \u00b0C for 10 min before extracting nucleic acids and reported that there was good agreement with the detection of feline leukemia virus (FeLV) in saliva and plasma but average Ct values were 1.5 units higher in saliva. The effect of heat treatment on the performance of the assays was not investigated in that study but the initial levels of FeLV were fairly high in such samples, where mean Ct values were below 20. Roy et al. (1999) concluded that a heat treatment of 15 min at 60 \u00b0C prior to storage at \u221220 \u00b0C for 30 days did not prevent the degradation of hepatitis C virus (HCV) RNA in whole saliva and oral fluid samples during frozen storage but the effect of a heat treatment alone on the detection of HCV in those samples was not reported. Preliminary studies with oral fluid inoculated with low levels of HEV derived from a clarified fecal HEV suspension (5 \u00d7 103\n gc/ml of oral fluid) indicated that a heat treatment of 60 \u00b0C for 15 min was detrimental to HEV RNA (data not shown). While HEV was detected in 10/10 samples incubated at 4 \u00b0C for 1 h and 18 h and in 3/10 samples stored at \u221220 \u00b0C for 30 days, HEV was not detected in any of the samples that were heated for 15 min at 60 \u00b0C or heat treated and then stored at \u221220 \u00b0C for 30 days (data not shown). Based on those preliminary findings, the effect of heat treatment as a means of inactivating degradative enzymes was not investigated in subsequent trials.",

Therefore the source of HEV in this study was derived from a swine fecal sample that was positive for HEV by qRT-PCR. Other possible sources of HEV include serum or lymphnodes of infected animals, which were not available to the researchers. The fecal sample was diluted in PBS and clarified by centrifugation, a procedure used commonly for the detection of HEV by real time RT-PCR (Jones and Johns, 2012, Leblanc et al., 2007). One of the drawbacks of using fecal extracts is that fecal material contains inhibitors that may affect the PCR assay. The concentration of inhibitors originating from the fecal extract are diluted in the inoculated oral fluid where each sample of inoculated oral fluid contains approximately 3.3% of orginal fecal material, which may be realistic and comparable to the presence of background fecal material naturally present in oral fluid of pigs due to environmental contamination. Detecting viral RNA in oral fluid from pigs is complex. In addition to PCR inhibitors present in oral fluid itself, concerns have been raised about additional PCR inhibitors from fecal material and other environmental contaminants in oral fluid (Chittick et al., 2011). Chittick et al. (2011) reported that the interference of PCR inhibitors in oral fluid could be reduced by increasing the concentration of PCR enzymes.",

MS2 and MNV were obtained from diluted virus stocks that were propagated by cell culture, which eliminates the concern about the presence of PCR inhibitors derived from clarified fecal extract as in the case of HEV. However, it is likely that the oral fluid still contains a background level of fecal material due to environmental contamination. Similar to results observed with HEV, the recovery of MS2 and MNV was significantly higher from oral samples that were incubated without a stabilizing agent but the relative differences in log genome copies recovered between the two processes were smaller than observed with HEV, with a difference of 1.4, 1.8, and 2.7 log units for MS2, MNV, and HEV, respectively (Table 3\n). While MS2 and MNV were spiked simultaneously in the samples of oral fluid, there was insufficient RNA for 2 of the oral samples to detect MNV by qRT-PCR for one of the extraction procedures, therefore those samples were excluded from the analysis for MNV. In contrast to HEV, MS2 and MNV were detected in all samples that were analyzed when oral fluid was incubated with a stabilizing agent for 24 h at 37 \u00b0C and extracted with the RNeasy Protect Saliva kit.",

            "text": "The RNeasy Protect Saliva kit has been evaluated for human mRNA but information on the performance with viral RNA or with oral fluid from animals is limited to a single final project report, which lacks peer review (Strugnell and Thirsk, 2010). The manufacturer instructions indicate that human RNA can be stabilized with the RNA protect Saliva Reagent for up to 1 day at 37 \u00b0C, up to 14 days at room temperature, up to 28 days at temperatures between 2 and 8 \u00b0C, or archived at \u221220 \u00b0C or \u221280 \u00b0C, where lower temperatures are recommended when possible. The stabilization conditions of 24 h at 37 \u00b0C used in this study represent a worst case scenario within the guidelines of the manufacturer. Such conditions are encountered realistically by samples during collection in a warm climate or transit in vehicles. Although a better recovery of viral RNA might be expected when a lower stabilization temperature such as room temperature is used, the recovery of viral RNA was significantly lower from stabilized samples held at \u221220 \u00b0C than when oral fluid was extracted with the QiaAmp kit. However, even when PRRSV inoculated into oral fluid was stabilized with the RNA protect Saliva Reagent, serially diluted and then stored at 4 \u00b0C for 18 h before RNA was extracted, the performance of the QiaAmp kit was superior to the RNAeasy Protect Saliva kit (Strugnell and Thirsk, 2010). The samples of oral fluid were inoculated with high levels of viruses in this study to permit the evaluation of different treatments in quantitative terms. However, when sampling oral fluid for viruses, investigators probably are more interested in presence/absence data than in quantitative data. The data suggests that at lower virus concentrations, the likelihood of detecting viruses is higher when the QiaAmp kit is used over the RNeasy Protect Saliva kit under the conditions that were tested. These findings confirm the observations of Strugnell and Thirsk (2010). In addition, stabilizing and extracting viral RNA with the RNeasy Protect Saliva Mini kit is almost 3 times more expensive than extracting RNA with the QiaAmp Viral Mini kit. As minimal degradation of viral RNA was observed with 3 different viruses when oral fluid was stored without a stabilizing agent at 4 \u00b0C for \u226424 h or \u221220 \u00b0C for 30 days and extracted with QiaAmp RNA Mini kit, it appears that it is unnecessary to stabilize oral fluid from swine for the detection of viral RNA, provided the samples are stored at 4 \u00b0C or frozen at \u221220 \u00b0C. The findings of this study are in agreement with other studies investigating the stability of viral RNA in oral fluid from swine. Prickett et al. (2010) reported that PRRSV RNA in oral fluids was relatively resistant to degradation when samples were frozen promptly or held at 4 \u00b0C for up to 12 days. If refrigeration of samples of oral fluids is not possible, then it is important to use a stabilizer that works for viral RNA. Decorte et al. (2013) investigated the stability of PRRSV RNA in the presence of 3 different RNA stabilizers in pooled oral fluid at room temperature. PRRSV RNA was stable for 7 days at 4 \u00b0C without an RNA stabilizer and at room temperature with Oragene RNA as a stabilizing agent but when Aware Messenger or Saliva Gene Collection Module were used as RNA stabilizers, PRRSV RNA was degraded even more rapidly at room temperature than in the absence of these RNA stabilizers, with reductions of >3 log units after 8 h of incubation (Decorte et al., 2013). As the oral fluid samples were stored at \u221280 \u00b0C before the RNA was extracted, frozen storage may have had an additional impact on the results reported in that study. The findings obtained from the storage and handling conditions on the stability of HEV, MS2 and MNV in swine oral fluid and the limitations of the RNeasy Protect Saliva Mini kit contribute to the knowledge that is required to develop appropriate handling procedures to develop monitoring tools based on oral fluid collection to screen for the presence of HEV or other potential zoonotic viral pathogens in swine.",
