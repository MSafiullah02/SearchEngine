            "text": "The coronavirus pandemic is mediated by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) and has been responsible for more than 900,000 infections and 45,000 deaths worldwide as of April 1, 2020 [1, 2] . The molecular mechanisms leading to SARS-CoV-2 infection were identified at an incredible pace: Similar to SARS-CoV-1, the virus which led to the SARS epidemic during 2002-2004, SARS-CoV-2 infects cells via binding to angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2; [3] ). Therefore, concerns were raised that higher expression of ACE2 in the respiratory tract may expedite the infection. However, ACE2 also plays beneficial roles in the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) where it metabolizes angiotensin II (Ang-2), a vasoconstrictor, to angiotensin-(1-7) (Ang-(1-7)), a vasodilator with antihypertrophic properties. Thus, consumption of ACE2 by the virus may result in an overshooting activation of the RAAS. Importantly, inhibitors of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEI) as well as AT1-receptor blockers (ARB) have been shown in experimental studies to upregulate ACE2 and ACE levels in various tissues [4, 5] . Both ACEI and ARB are widely used for the treat-ment of heart failure and hypertension, especially in patients with diabetes. The observation that patients suffering from these conditions are at increased risk of dying from SARS-CoV-2 infection [S1] raised reasonable concerns about whether these drugs might increase the risk of both SARS-CoV-2 infection and an unfavorable course of the disease. However, several important issues regarding the involvement of ACE2 in the disease and the interaction of its expression and activity with the administration of RAAS-modulating drugs are not fully understood yet:",

However, data on the expression of ACE2 in lung tissue are scarce. In contrast to the intestine, heart, and kidney, ACE2 expression levels in the lung are rather modest [S3]. In addition, experimental research revealed that ACE2 might have aprotectiveroleinlunginjury. Inamouse model of acute acid-induced lung injury, the knockout of Ace2 resulted in detrimental effects, e.g., reduced lung elastance, reduced blood oxygen levels, and more interstitial edema compared with wildtype mice. Importantly, the effects of a lack of Ace2 might be mediated by reduced inactivation of Ang-2: (a) a double knockout of Ace2 and Ace was able to partially revert the effects; (b) pharmacological blockage or a genetic knockout of the AT1 receptor resulted in curtail-ing of the consequences of acid-induced lung injury [S4].",

There is also genetic evidence that single-nucleotide polymorphisms at the ACE2 locus are associated with left ventricular parameters in men [S6]. As already mentioned, ACE2 is expressed in the heart and inhibitors of the RAAS system have been described to modulate the system in animal models [4, 5] . While cardiotropism via ACE2 seems plausible, ACE2 might also have protective effects: Mice lacking Ace2 displayed reduced myocardial contractility; of note, similar to what has been observed in lung injury, an additional lack of Ace was able to obvert the cardiac phenotype. This again highlights the important role of ACE2 in counteracting Ang-2 [S7].",
