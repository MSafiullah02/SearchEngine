This slow period is called golden time as it allows for intervention, which is much more difficult after the disease becomes global. Modeling of epidemic spread with essential factors is necessary to control catastrophic outbreaks within this golden time. To this end, several epidemic models have been investigated on complex networks, for instance, the susceptible\u2013infected\u2013removed (SIR) model [2,3] and the susceptible\u2013infected\u2013susceptible (SIS) model [4]. Analytical and numerical studies of those models revealed that a continuous phase transition occurs on Erd\u0151s-R\u00e9nyi (ER) random networks [5]. Thus, abrupt pandemic outbreaks on a macroscopic scale, which often occur in the real world, cannot be reproduced using those models.",

A natural way is to appropriately extend the conventional SIR and SIS models. For instance, an extended SIR model includes more than one infected state of different pathogens that are cooperatively activated in contagion: A person who is suffering from the flu can be more easily infected by pneumonia. This model is referred to as a cooperative contagion model [6,7]. Similar instances include a two-step contagion process. A patient becomes weakened first and then becomes sick. This model is referred to as the susceptible\u2013weakened\u2013infected\u2013removed (SWIR) model [8\u201315]. In another instance of modified SIR models, a network evolves by rewiring links at a certain rate during the spread of contagion [16]. The rewiring takes into account the mobility of humans. Then, epidemic spread can be accelerated as the rewiring rate is increased, which can lead to a discontinuous transition representing the pandemic outbreak.",

Here we reconsider this problem and represent the pattern of disease transmission using a nonlinear mapping. We show that the linear and nonlinear terms of the nonlinear mapping separately behave well. The linear term is responsible for one-step contagion without weakened states and the nonlinear term describes the two step contagion, which includes weakened state. Thus, the previous result of N1/3 for the golden time is consistent with the characteristic size of the giant cluster generated in the SIR model [19,20], thus it is verified within this new framework. Next, we consider another case, which is the main concern of this paper, in which an epidemic starts to spread from endemic multiple seeds of O(N) on ER networks also at the epidemic threshold. In this case, long latent period appears not immediately but after some characteristic time. Thus fluctuations induced by the stochastic process of disease transmission in the early time heavily affect the behavior during the latent period, which changes the measured exponent \u03b6 to a value slightly larger than 1/4. We estimate this scaling behavior using the saddle-node bifurcation theory [21] and discuss the underlying mechanism.",

References [26,27] showed that the exponent 1/3 is also obtained in k-core percolation. Thus, the scaling behavior of N1/3 is robust.

Nodes in state W are involved in the reactions S+I\u2192W+I and W+I\u21922I, which occur in addition to the reactions S+I\u21922I and I\u2192R in the SIR model. At each discrete time step n, the following processes are performed. (i) All the nodes in state I are listed in random order. (ii) The states of the neighbors of each node in the list are updated sequentially as follows: If a neighbor is in state S, it changes its state in one of two ways: either to I with probability \u03ba or to W with probability \u03bc. If a neighbor is in the state W, it changes to I with probability \u03b7, where \u03ba,\u03bc, and \u03b7 are the contagion probabilities for the respective reactions. (iii) All nodes in the list change their states to R. This completes a single time step, and we repeat the above processes until the system reaches an absorbing state in which no infectious node is left in the system.

            "text": "When contagion starts from a single infectious node, its spread in the early time regime is governed by the linear term of Eq. (18). It proceeds in the form of a CB tree [17], i.e., the mean branching ratio (un+1\u2212un)/(un\u2212un\u22121) is almost unity, and the main contribution is that of the reaction S+I\u21922I. Thus, in the thermodynamic limit, un always stays zero so that nonlinear terms in Eq. (18) do not appear. However, in finite systems, un grows gradually and the nonlinear term (b\u2212a)un2 becomes significant after a characteristic time nc(N). It was argued in Ref. [19] that for the SIR model at the epidemic threshold, the maximum size of outbreaks is proportional to N2/3 in the mean field limit. When un grows up to O(N2/3), the nonlinear terms in Eq. (14) suppresses further growth of the cluster, leading to a subcritical branching process. This means that the CB process driven by Eq. (14) persists up to O(N1/3), because the fractal dimension of the CB tree is two. However, for the SWIR model, the coefficient of the nonlinear term Eq. (18) is positive, and the nonlinear term enhances further increase of removed nodes. The CB process turns into a supercritical process, leading to a pandemic outbreak. Accordingly, the golden time, the duration of the CB process, scales similarly as \u223cN1/3 to that of the SIR model, which is what we observed in a previous work [14,17].",

QN(d0) has a longer tail in its positive side than in the oppposite side as shown in Figs. 4(a)\u20134(c). As the system size becomes larger, it becomes not only narrower but also more symmetric.

Using this model, we obtained the scaling behavior of the golden time with respect to the system size. Using the local tree approximation, we set up a nonlinear dynamic equation in the form of saddle-node bifurcation that represents the cascade dynamics of two-step contagion. When the epidemic dynamics starts from a single infected node, we showed that the linear and the nonlinear terms of the nonlinear mapping play distinct their roles. In the early time regime, the linear term governs a critical branching (CB) process. The CB tree can be regarded as a critical cluster in percolation. However, in the late time regime, the nonlinear term causes an explosive spread of epidemic disease. The golden time is determined by the finite-size effect on the linear term, which scales as \u223cN\u03b6 with \u03b6=1/3. This scaling behavior is universal for cascade-induced dynamic models such as the threshold model, k-core percolation and the CFoIN.",

In this case, a long CB process does not appear from n=0, but it does at some characteristic time n*. During the time until n*, clusters of ever infected nodes merge and form a cluster of size O(N). The size fluctuates for different realizations. The fluctuations are induced by the stochastic process of disease transmission. We found that these fluctuations change the value of \u03b6 from 1/3 to about 0.252 for the multiple-seed case. Due to the multiplicative noise of disease spread, the size distribution of those clusters over different realizations becomes asymmetric with a long tail in its positive region. It seems that due to such non-Gaussianity the golden time scales as \u223cN\u03b6 with \u03b6 slightly larger than 1/4. However, this asymmetry decreases gradually in a power-law manner of the skewness function as the system size is increased. This leaves the possibility open that asymptotically the value of \u03b6 approaches 1/4. This problem could not be ultimately solved by our study. A very precise analysis of corrections to scaling would be needed for it, which was not possible in spite of our massive numerical efforts.",
