First, there was a significant delay in testing for COVID-19 in the USA,14 which might subsequently lead to longer lag time between the trends of search-interest and daily incidence. Second, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommended a priority-based testing strategy and allowed for not testing some subjects considered low-priority when the COVID-19 tests are short in supply.15 The criteria for testing COVID-19 in the USA, therefore, were different from those in China and Europe, where the WHO criteria were adopted.16\u201318 Thus, the patients, who met the WHO criteria, may not be tested and subsequently not included in the daily incidence in the USA; this could lead to underreporting of daily incidence. Third, the biological and socioeconomic differences between the USA and Chinese patients may also contribute to the difference. Finally, the prevalent COVID-19 subtypes in the USA may also be different from those in China and result in different lag times.19",

First, COVID-19 daily new deaths in the USA are poorly understood, and are here described and studied using a semiparametric model. Second, we extensively examined nine COVID-19-related search terms, which are more than the two used in a previous study.7 Our data also suggest that pneumonia and heart problems were highly relevant to the daily new cases and deaths in the USA. This finding may be explained by the frequent pneumonia and cardiac injuries seen in COVID-19 patients.20,21 Third, the lag time in our study was longer than that previously reported in China (12 days vs. 9 days). However, the 12 and 19 days of lag time also afforded us the opportunity to assess a model\u2019s prediction accuracy for a longer period of future trends. Fourth, the comparison of predicted values and prospectively collected data will significantly reduce the recall and selection biases.",

Indeed, we found very high correlation in retrospective modelling but low accuracy in prediction, suggesting that the search-interest based model may be more helpful in predicting daily-incidence peak or early outbreak than post-peak or post-intervention trends. The unexpected low accuracy of model prediction was due to significant attenuation of trend plateau. It may be linked to the April 3 recommendation of wearing masks by the U.S. CDC,22 which was 5 days before our model\u2019s peak time and matched the COVID19\u2019s median incubation time of 5 days.20 Finally, to our knowledge, we are first to examine the correlations of search interest with the COVID-19 daily new cases and deaths in the USA and show greater correlations (Pearson\u2019s r > 0.97) than reported in the Chinese data.7",
