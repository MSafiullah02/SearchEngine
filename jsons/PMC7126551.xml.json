Since its emergence as a clinical entity in the late 1980s, PRRS virus has proven to be a persistent threat to the health and productivity of pig herds and the economic well-being of pig producers. Neumann et al. (2005) estimated the annual cost of PRRS to U.S. pig producers at $560.32 million per year. By comparison, prior to eradication, annual losses in the U.S. to classical swine fever (hog cholera) and pseudorabies virus were estimated at $364.09 million (Wise, 1981) and $36.27 million (Hallam et al., 1987), respectively (adjusted to year 2004 dollars).",

Several epidemiological investigations showed that proximity to infected herds increased the risk of a herd acquiring PRRS virus. In France, Le Potier et al. (1997) found that 45% of herds suspected to have become infected through area spread were located within 500 m (0.3 miles) of the postulated source herd and only 2% were 1 km from the initial outbreak. In Denmark it was observed that the likelihood of herd positivity increased as the density and proximity of PRRS virus-positive neighboring herds increased (Mortensen et al., 2002).",

(1947) reduced the spread of airborne viral pathogens (\u201cmeasles\u201d) in school classrooms using ultraviolet. Riley (1961) demonstrated that ventilated air from hospital tuberculosis wards produced tuberculosis in guinea pigs, but not when the air was irradiated with ultraviolet light. In recent years, UV254 emitters have been engineered into areas where people congregate either by placing UV254 light tube grids into existing ventilation ductwork or by installing free standing UVC emitters (Brickner et al., 2003, Dumyuahn and First, 1999, McDevitt et al., 2008, Menzies et al., 1999, Noakes et al., 2006). Ultraviolet technology is appealing due to its low cost as compared to HEPA filtration (Brickner et al., 2003). However, effective implementation must be based on achieving a dose of UV254 sufficient to inactivate the target. No estimates of the effect of UV254 on airborne PRRS virus have been published. Therefore, the objective of this experiment was to evaluate the capability of ultraviolet (UV254) to inactivate airborne PRRS virus under varying conditions of temperature and relative humidity.",

In contrast, in a study involving bacteriophage MS2, respiratory adenovirus serotype 2, and mouse hepatitis virus (coronavirus), Walker and Ko (2007) reported that UV254 inactivation increased as relative humidity increased (temperature conditions not reported). This same general trend was reported by McDevitt et al. (2007) who stated there was an increase in UV254 susceptibility with an increase in relative humidity (temperature conditions not reported). Walker and Ko (2007) hypothesized that increased UV254 susceptibility at higher relative humidity could have been a function of larger droplet size at higher relative humidities.

The percent of the infectious viral population remaining after n UV254 half-life doses may be described as (1/2n); thus, the percent of infectious PRRS virus remaining after 10 UV254 doses may be calculated as (1/210) = 0.1%. From this, the dose of UV254 required to inactivate 99.9% of airborne PRRS virus may be calculated using the value from Table 3 as (0.121 mJ/area2/half-life) \u00d7 (10 half-lifes) = 1.21 mJ/area2. This exposure dose may be achieved under different conditions of ultraviolet intensity and airflow.
