For lack of effective drugs, this zoonotic, cosmopolitan coccidiosis is difficult to cure. On farms with endemic occurence of C. parvum, morbidity of calves up to 1 month of age may reach 100% (de Graaf et al., 1999). Calf mortality due to cryptosporidiosis, especially among animals receiving good zoohygiene and care, is usually low. The biggest losses are thus mainly indirect, due to the extra costs associated with the care of sick animals, and due to growth impairment.",

Studies on infected children, moreover, indicate that mucosal damage caused by cryptosporidia is associated with higher paracellular permeability of the intestine and an impairment of the mucosal barrier function (Kukuruzovic et al., 1999).",

The solution was administered via a drencher, together with the d-xylose solution. Thereafter all urine was collected for five consecutive hours using urine collection bags. Urine volume was measured and 100 mL aliquots were stored at \u221228 \u00b0C until analyzed using gas liquid chromatography.

In fact, at day 7 p.i. most of infected calves showed severe diarrhoea, which in addition, may contribute to reducing the time of d-xylose exposure to the site of absorption, and thus lead to an underestimate of absorption. The d-xylose test results of Perin et al. (2001) obtained with HIV positive children partially support our observation in calves, since the highest impairment of the intestinal absorption was observed just in children with cryptosporidiosis.

The persisting malabsorption of d-xylose show that the small intestine in C. parvum infected calves requires more than 2 weeks to fully recover its absorptive surface.
