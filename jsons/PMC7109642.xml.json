As a consequence, practices vary markedly, even within geographically proximal locations. The aim of this article is to take a few potshots at some of the current dogma in this area, aiming to puncture a few balloons. We will highlight the lack of supportive data, potential mis-extrapolations, overblown claims and the non-consideration of contrary findings. These blinkered views enable conclusions and recommendations to be drawn that often fall well short on closer scrutiny. We will focus on some specific examples of infection treatment and control measures in the intensive care unit (ICU) that illustrate these issues.",

They may simply represent an alternative spin based on selective cherry-picking of articles that we use to support our arguments. If so, we are as guilty as those taking the establishment view or who promote their own particular bandwagons.

The myriad ways of performing meta-analysis which change the likelihood of deriving a \u2018positive\u2019 result, trial protocols that load the odds unfairly against the control group, and extrapolation of data from specific patient subsets to whole populations are but three examples of \u2018evidence-biased\u2019 medicine. We are also recognizing that overall benefit applied to a population may not necessarily help an individual. Subsets may be either benefited, unaffected or disadvantaged by specific treatments and stratagems, so the net result of a wide population study will often fail to reflect an individual's response. Recent studies on pharmacogenomics2 and the marked severity-related differences in survival with activated protein C in severe sepsis3 highlight this fact.\n",

He observed that adoption of hand hygiene in medical attendants during childbirth reduced mortality rates due to puerperal fever by a factor of 10. While ridiculed at the time, these observations have become regarded as one of the seminal events in the development of modern medicine. Seen in this quasi-religious light, and with additional pressure from media shock\u2013horror expos\u00e9s and governmental/insurer threats of \u2018naming and shaming\u2019, financial penalties and senior administrator dismissal and litigation, it is easy to see why a perceived rise in hospital-acquired infection instinctively provokes calls for more assiduous hand disinfection, increased use of barrier precautions and institution of diagnostics and therapies that offer dubious cost- or outcome-benefit. Practices such as the use of gown and gloves, isolation of selected patients and alcohol gel hand sterilization have been rapidly established as standards of care but without specific high-level proof of efficacy. Subsequent efforts at grant funding, formal testing and/or publication may then be impeded by a lack of equipoise, especially when experts who promote the orthodoxy tend to be the \u2018go-to\u2019 reviewers.",

Judging the evidence base for these treatments is complex. For example, is Level 1 evidence from prospective randomized controlled trials required to justify the use of every intervention, or would such a requirement prevent the uptake of many potentially beneficial interventions? Is it ethical to formally test by prospective randomized controlled trial the benefits of interventions long established as standard of care? Even if this were possible, would sufficient equipoise exist? In the absence of such evidence, how valid are findings culled from retrospective database analyses and historical studies that suggest benefit? This is particularly pertinent when the practice and process of critical care has changed dramatically in the last 10\u201320 years. Stress ulcer bleeding was a major cause of morbidity and mortality in ICU patients in the early 1970s; now it is a relatively unusual phenomenon regardless of the use (or not) of gastric protectants. The unwanted consequences of the continued (over)use of proton pump inhibitors and H2 antagonists, e.g. impairment of neutrophil bactericidal activity5 and Clostridium difficile overgrowth,6 may no longer be outweighed by their direct therapeutic benefit. Is it now time to have a moratorium on these agents except in well-defined patient populations (perhaps concurrent peptic ulcer disease)?",

If confirmed, should we then determine which components become superfluous or offer only minimal added benefit to save valuable effort, cost and resource. Should we be opposing changes in clinical practice that are motivated by political or financial priorities merely because they lack a clear evidence base? Or are such changes occasionally essential for public confidence? Yet again, why have interventions with a good evidence base from prospective randomized controlled trials not been widely adopted?",

It is a sad indictment of the specialties of intensive care, microbiology and infectious diseases, as well as governmental bodies and industry, that after 40 years or more of critical care we still do not know the optimal duration of a course of antibiotics for a \u2018standard\u2019 infection. Clearly, deep-seated infections such as osteomyelitis and endocarditis warrant a prolonged antibiotic course but, even in these cases, the chosen duration is largely empirical. Is there any evidence that neutropenics or patients with a \u2018slow clinical response\u2019 benefit from a longer course of antibiotics? Or do patients simply suffer the consequences of microbial overgrowth with (often multiresistant) hospital flora, C. difficile and fungi? Data from the USA suggest that fungal causes of sepsis rose by 207% between 1979 and 2000;17 how much of this rise was caused by better identification, sicker patient cohorts or antibiotic (over)use is unknown.",

            "text": "Antibiotic courses thus tend to be empirical, often lasting 7 or 14 days, and are likely to be chosen to coincide with a weekly multiple. Prospective randomized controlled trials (PRCTs) are few and far between. Chastre et al.18 did show that comparable clinical effectiveness was achieved with 8 day or 15 day treatment regimens for ventilator-associated pneumonia, but there was a significant reduction in the emergence of multiresistant pathogens in those receiving the shorter course. Two recently published PRCTs have used the pro-inflammatory blood marker procalcitonin to guide discontinuation of antibiotics. The multicentre PRORATA trial,19 performed in 321 patients in eight French ICUs, showed a reduction in antibiotic course duration from 14.3 \u00b1 9.1 days to 11.6 \u00b1 8.2 days (P < 0.0001) with no change in mortality. The predominant type of infection treated was of the respiratory tract and nearly half the patients had septic shock. Similar patients were treated and similar outcomes were achieved by Nobre et al.20 in a single-centre trial from Geneva; they, however, showed a median reduction in antibiotic use from 9.5 days to 6 days (P = 0.15). A reasonable argument can be made that ongoing inflammation is not a direct surrogate of ongoing bacterial activity, so the procalcitonin measure could be merely acting as a comfort blanket to support the clinician's decision to stop antibiotics. Indeed, the practice in our ICU, reported in 2004,21 showed a median duration of treatment for bacteraemia of 5\u20135.5 days, without the use of procalcitonin monitoring, and with very low relapse rates. If anything, our current practice is even shorter, although this has not been formally measured. The extent to which an antibiotic course can be safely truncated requires many more prospective, randomized studies in different infections affecting different patient populations. A trial comprising Dutch adults with mild to moderate/severe community-acquired pneumonia who had improved after 3 days of treatment with intravenous amoxicillin, involved randomization to either placebo (n = 56) or a further 5 days of oral amoxicillin (n = 63).22 Outcomes (clinical and radiological success rates) were similar in both groups. From Auckland, Briggs et al.23 reported a case series of 90 patients with proven (n = 72) or probable (n = 16) meningococcal disease who received just 3.1 \u00b1 0.5 (mean \u00b1 SD) days of intravenous benzylpenicillin. Of the six who died, four did so soon after admission while still on treatment, with the other two dying of late complications resulting from the initial multi-organ failure. No microbiological relapses were seen, either in the short or long term. Even more extreme, at least in a Western context, was the study by Nathan et al.24 performed in health clinics in Niger, where patients with meningococcal meningitis were randomized to receive a single intramuscular dose of either ceftriaxone or chloramphenicol. In cases of clinical failure, a second single dose was given after 24\u201348 h and, if failure persisted at 72 h, rescue treatment was intravenous ceftriaxone for a minimum of a further 4 days. Only 7% required a second dose at 24\u201348 h, and the rate of treatment failure at 72 h was 9% (mortality 5%). Using multiple logistic regression analysis, they found that only impaired consciousness at baseline, or diagnosis of another disease (alone or in association with meningococcal meningitis), remained significant risk factors for treatment failure at 72 h.",

These policies undoubtedly cater to public concerns about the rising incidence of healthcare-acquired infection and the need to demonstrate clearly visible attempts at infection control. This is nevertheless a perfect illustrative example of a policy led principally by a desire to be seen be taking action, despite unproven benefits and the potential to harm.",

Bizarrely, in contrast to the evidence base for many other infection control methods in intensive care, a wealth of evidence exists for this strategy, with over 50 randomized controlled trials performed. Meta-analyses show SDD is associated with significant reductions in lower airway and bloodstream infection rates and offers an overall survival benefit.45\u201347 The fear that this approach encourages bacterial resistance does not appear to be borne out; indeed, the reduction in infection has often led to an overall decrease in antibiotic use.",

A valid criticism is that many of the SDD studies are generally small, heterogeneous, largely single-centre, of low quality and not blinded. The recent large Dutch multicentre randomized controlled trial48 employed a cluster-randomized design crossing over between SDD, selective oral decontamination (topical antibiotics without prophylactic parenteral agents) and standard care in over 5000 patients expected to stay in the ICU for longer than 48 h. In this study, survival benefit only became evident after statistical correction for differences in illness severity arising from imbalanced randomization.

He reviewed five representative large ICU studies and demonstrated a wide variation (19\u201362%) in the proportion of hospital-acquired bloodstream infections assigned to CR-BSI, highlighting likely differences in local interpretation. National Nosocomial Infections Surveillance guidelines recommend that the use of multiple lines in a single patient should still be counted as 1 catheter day. Thus, a rate of 2.7 per 1000 catheter days would equate to approximately one CR-BSI per ICU bed per year. The health and economic impact of reducing CR-BSIs has not been assessed in the UK but would fall far short of numbers claimed for the USA. In 2006 Pronovost et al.51 asserted that an estimated 80 000 CR-BSIs occurred per annum in the USA, with up to 28 000 deaths among ICU patients. With an average cost of care of US$45 000 per infection, they claimed the annual cost could be up to US$2.3 billion.

Indeed, several US states have now enacted laws mandating disclosure of \u2018never events\u2019 and introduced remunerative or punitive measures for failure. Consumer (e.g. www.ConsumerReportsHealth.org) and business (e.g. www.leapfroggroup.org) groups now name and shame hospitals that are either poorly performing or who decline to release their data. Clearly, this has had an impact. Many hospitals now report zero infection rates. The Leapfrog Group found that roughly half of 1285 hospitals responding to a survey waived fees for \u2018never events', those that waived fees being much more likely to have perfect scores on the Leapfrog Safe Practices Score. The Michigan Health and Hospital Association Keystone:ICU (www.mhakeystonecenter.org) stated that a series of interventions to improve ICU safety, with daily goals and elimination of CR-BSI and ventilator-associated pneumonia, has resulted over a 5 year period (2004\u201309) in 1830 lives saved, 1 40 700 excess hospital days avoided and US$271 million in healthcare dollars rescued in the state of Michigan alone.54 The validity of these claims has not, to our knowledge, been substantiated, yet the UK Department of Health has been so impressed that the National Health Service is attempting to follow suit with the Matching Michigan project.55 However, Edgeworth50 has pointed out how estimates of excess length of stay due to CR-BSI (claimed to be 10\u201320 days) are predominantly based on case\u2013control studies, a design fraught with difficulties in both selecting controls and adjusting for potential confounders. Similar difficulties surround attributable mortality due to CR-BSI, which is reported to vary from 0 to 35%. Studies that employed more sophisticated approaches to correct for confounders have generally been unable to show a significant effect of CR-BSI upon mortality. This applies not only when all organisms are included but also holds when coagulase-negative staphylococci are excluded.56",

Paradoxically, an intervention with a large evidence base, SDD, is largely rejected while interventions with little evidence of efficacy are promoted through either dogma and/or political imperative. Indeed, the lack of consistency in infection control and treatment policies between hospitals highlights the weakness of this evidence base and the vagaries of our behaviour. Millar57 argues that the particular circumstances and environment of any healthcare facility predisposes to differing microbiological hazards, reducing the generalizability of practice recommendations and research findings. He rightly contends that government-driven targets to reduce specific infections (for instance MRSA bacteraemia, which accounts for just 2% of healthcare-associated infection in the UK) inevitably encourage deprioritization of other, non-targeted infections. Some of these (e.g. Gram-negative bacteraemias) are associated with an equal if not larger burden of adverse outcomes and yet, despite the huge increase in expenditure, staff effort and resource spent on infection control, are inexorably increasing. Furthermore, these targets and the procedures instituted to control them may distract from other, arguably more important, patient outcomes that may not be related to infection. His list of ideal properties for an infection target is reproduced in Figure 2.\n",

We should address and prioritize the definitive studies needed to address current major deficiencies in our knowledge base. We need to identify the true outcome- and cost-effectiveness of an intervention, and not rely on headline-grabbing \u2018telephone\u2019 numbers to spark media interest and subsequent governmental activity and funding. We do recognize that benefit may be difficult to assess. This is especially pertinent when baseline rates of infection are low (such as CR-BSI) and when directly attributable mortality from such infections may represent perhaps only a small component of the overall cause of death in critical illness. With the financial crises currently besetting most healthcare systems, it is incumbent upon us to maximize the utility of our interventions, particularly when a bundled package is promoted with minimal scrutiny. Given that unequivocal evidence is unlikely to become available for many interventions, we would not suggest their immediate abandonment, but we should recognize their limitations and be prepared to modify practice as this changes. We also need to carefully assess the effect of real-world implementation of any change to detect unanticipated harm and understand the true cost\u2013benefit balance.",
