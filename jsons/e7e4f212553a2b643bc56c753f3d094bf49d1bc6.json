Yet, despite tremendous advances, infectious diseases still remain a major burden for the human population in Asia. Of the estimated 2.1 million deaths in children aged less than 5 years in Southeast Asia in 2010, 47 % are attributable to infectious causes (Liu et al., Lancet 379:2151-2161 , 2012 . As such, Asia is both vulnerable to imported EIDs and a global focus of major social and environmental change that may facilitate the emergence and dissemination of new pathogens. However, it would be too simplistic to present the extensive changes in Asia as inevitably increasing the risk of This work is in part based on an article published in Emerging Infectious Diseases in June 2013.",

            "text": "The conditions or events (the 'drivers') that result in the successful cross-over of an animal microbe into humans are not well characterised, but emergence is often precipitated by changes to ecological or biological systems (Wilcox and Colwell 2005) . Such changes include altered patterns of contact between wild and domestic animals (e.g. Nipah virus), of direct human and wild animal contact (e.g. HIV, Ebola), and changes in species abundance or diversity (e.g. Hantavirus; Lyme disease). Species diversity, including the diversity of insect vectors and pathogenic microorganisms, increases towards the equator (Guernier et al. 2004) , and Jones et al. found a correlation between the emergence of zoonotic pathogens and the diversity of mammalian wildlife species (Jones et al. 2008) . Whilst high animal host and pathogen species diversity may be associated with a high burden of infectious diseases and an increased risk of disease emergence, biodiversity loss may, perhaps counter-intuitively, be associated with increased disease transmission. Biodiversity loss directly disrupts the functioning and stability of ecosystems, producing effects that can extend well beyond the particular lost species (Hooper et al. 2012) . Changes in species abundance and diversity may favour pathogen amplification and 'spill-over' through a variety of mechanisms, including reduced predation and competition resulting in increased abundance of competent hosts, and the loss of 'buffering species' leading to increased contact between amplifying host species and compatible pathogens (Keesing et al. 2010) . Tropical regions with a rich pool of existing and potential pathogens that are increasingly connected, but also experiencing high rates of ecosystem disruption and biodiversity loss, may therefore be at a particularly high risk of disease emergence. Human pathogens occasionally re-emerge as a result of dynamics that are beyond the control of humans. For example the Hantavirus outbreaks in the Southwestern U. S. in 1991-1992 and 1997-1998 have been attributed to changes in the abundance of infected rodents following periods of heavy snow and rainfall and vegetation growth leading to abundant production of rodent food. However, many ecological disturbances resulting in an EID seem to originate in the direct actions of humans. A wide range of anthropogenic factors have been linked to infectious disease emergence, including changes in land-use, travel, trade, and demographics. Notably, most of these associations are speculative and supported (Wolfe et al. 2007 ). Stage 1: The pathogen is still exclusively infecting animals. Stage 2: The pathogen has been transmitted from animals to humans under natural conditions but not yet from human to human. Stage 3: There is limited transmission from animals to humans and between humans. These are often severe and lethal diseases due to for instance filoviruses (e.g. Ebola). Stage 4: Animal disease that have sustained transmission between humans (e.g. influenza). Stage 5: A microbe that exclusively infects humans (e.g. measles, syphilis) by little hard data because ecological and biological systems are highly complex and multi-layered (Woolhouse 2011) . Demonstrating or predicting the impact of particular conditions or events on the functioning of a system is difficult, with further inference of the impact of any changes on the risk of pathogen emergence posing a formidable challenge.",

The demand for water, wood, pulp, agricultural land, living space, roads, minerals and power has had an enormous impact on the landscapes of Asia. Deforestation occurred throughout the 1990s and the area of primary forest in Asia has continued to decline (FAO 2012) . Deforestation, forest fragmentation, and afforestation are all alterations in habitat, which change species composition and the interaction between wild animals, domestic animals, insect vectors and humans, providing new opportunities for microbial transmission and potential emergence. There are well-documented examples of deforestation and forest encroachment resulting in increases in infectious diseases, such as yellow fever, Mayaro, and Chagas disease in the Americas (Saker et al. 2004 ). The clearing of forest and planting of large cacao plantations was linked to the emergence of Oropouche virus in Brazil. In Asia there are already very high pressures on productive land, and the peak in land-use change in Asia has probably passed. Many areas are now in an era of increasing intensification of land productivity. This intensification is driven largely by demographic pressures, which are predicted to result in a 70 % increase in food production by 2050, with decreased consumption of grains and increased demand for meats, fruits and vegetables (FAO 2011a, b) .",

The consequences of intensified agricultural production include the depletion and degradation of river and groundwater, reduced soil quality, and biodiversity loss. A direct and predictable effect of reduced access to clean water for low-income families is an increase in the risk of water-washed diseases (diseases that increase when the availability of water for personal hygiene is limited e.g. diarrhoeal and respiratory infections, trachoma), and water-borne diseases such as typhoid and hepatitis E. However, unquantified risks arising from the intensification of agriculture are pollution of freshwater with pesticides and fertilizers, loss of biodiversity, and land abandonment by small-scale farmers. The potential consequences of these changes on the risk of emergence of zoonotic infections have not been assessed.",

Whilst the reservoir of the SARS coronavirus is thought to be bats, wild civet cats traded for food are thought to have acted as an intermediate host, transmitting the SARS virus to humans through live animal markets (Li et al. 2005) . Wild animal products are popular in Asia as traditional medicines, tonics, delicacies, or as symbols of wealth. Although all ten countries in the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) are signatories to the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (CITES), Asia continues to host the largest illegal wildlife trade in the world (Rosen and Smith 2010) . The smuggling of H5N1-infected birds of prey into Europe, the frequent smuggling of bush meat from Africa into the U.S., and the importation into the U.S. of pet rodents infected with monkeypox show that both the legal and illegal trade in wild animals and wild animal products is a potential conduit for the international spread of zoonotic pathogens (Bair-Brake et al. 2013; Van Borm et al. 2005) ",

Whilst mega-cities (cities with a population of at least ten million) receive a lot of attention, most urban dwellers live in small cities, with half of the global urban population in 2011 living in cities of less than 500,000 people (UN-DESA 2012). This can be perceived positively as cities generally offer better economic opportunities, better educational opportunities, better living conditions, better nutrition, better sanitation, and therefore better health than underdeveloped rural areas. At the same time it is likely to mean that in many low to middle income countries, health and veterinary infrastructure in rural areas will not improve, or may even deteriorate, adversely affecting the likelihood of the early detection of EID. The demand for food in urban centres will increase and result in livestock and their products being transported over large distances from a wider catchment area, and thereby increase risk of spread and amplification of EID. Urbanisation is one facet of changing human sociocultural systems, which also includes changing consumer demands and dietary habits (Janes et al. 2012 ). The consequence is a spatial concentration of people and animals; not necessarily co-located, but connected through increasingly complex networks of rural and peri-urban farms and markets, distributors, agricultural workers, and consumers.",

The increased demand for meat has been met by more intensive and geographically concentrated production of livestock, especially pigs and poultry (Steinfeld et al. 2006 ). Much of this has been through expansion of both the number of small-scale production units and large commercial farms. High-density monoculture of domestic animals is a form of low biodiversity that poses a particular threat for the spread of infectious diseases from farmed animals to humans. Where domesticated animals are a conduit of spread from wild animals to humans, high density livestock production may promote spread of zoonotic diseases. Genetic diversity within an individual host species is important since genetic diversity limits the potential for devastating epidemics (King and Lively 2012) .",

One of the key factors, in particular in the case of Campylobacter, has been the integration of highly intensive poultry production with poultry processing systems facilitating cross-contamination of meat (Moore et al. 2005; Nyachuba 2010) . It is notable that some foodborne pathogens cause subclinical infections in their animal hosts (e.g., Campylobacter in poultry); therefore there is no direct incentive for farmers to control them. In addition, subsequent attribution of the source of foodborne disease in an affected human is notoriously difficult. It is likely that the global incidence of foodborne illness will rise as a result of increased industrial production of poultry in the emerging economies. The situation will be exacerbated by the emergence of antimicrobial resistant pathogens of foodborne pathogens (Sahin et al. 2012; Luangtongkum et al. 2009; Altekruse and Tollefson 2003) .",

Reducing contact between domestic and wild animals, whether the wild animals are in their natural habitat or captive, is a key strategy of the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) to reduce risk to human health, and is part of the wider FAO strategy of enhancing 'biosecurity'. Improving biosecurity in farms is a major challenge since a large proportion of farming in Asia is based on small-scale backyard production, and there is often a mix of commercial and backyard farming in any one location. Achieving improvements in biosecurity without adversely affecting the livelihoods of small-scale farmers requires an approach to risk management that is adapted to their socio-economic context. The longer-term vision is to restructure the livestock production sector towards a more commercialised and controlled system, where controls benefit animal health, human health, and commercial profitability. But it has also been recognised that small-scale producers will continue to have a key role in providing food security in developing economies, and in fact their importance may increase due to their more efficient use of natural resources compared with large-scale industrial production (Sjauw-Koen-Fa 2012; Quan 2011).",

Bacteria in some areas show alarmingly high rates of resistance to anti-bacterial agents, and the recent emergence of the New-Delhi Metallo-beta-lactamase-1 (NDM-1) resistance gene, conferring resistance to a last resort antibiotic, and its rapid dissemination to other regions highlights the serious threat to human health of antimicrobial resistance (Khan and Nordmann 2012) . Antibiotics are used extensively in the livestock and aquaculture sector to treat or prevent infections, or as growth promoters. Non-therapeutic use of antibiotics as growth promoters involves the prolonged administration of sub-therapeutic doses. This practise has a demonstrable effect on the emergence and prevalence of resistant microorganisms in food animals and their environment, as well as resulting in the excretion of antibiotics into the environment, where environmental bacteria may be subject to antibiotic selection pressures (Marshall and Levy 2011) .",

A more analytical approach to these emergence events requires characterisation of the attributes of natural and artificial ecological systems before and after disturbance, and the functional relationship between changes in system attributes and pathogen emergence (Woolhouse 2011) .",

Recent examples are drug resistant bacterial infections (penicillin resistant pneumococcal pneumonia, carbapenem resistant hospital acquired infections), drug resistant malaria, and oseltamivir resistant influenza. -Already known diseases that reappear after apparent control or elimination, or under unusual circumstances. Examples in category are the deliberate release of anthrax in the USA in 2001, or the reappearance of dengue on Florida, USA.",
