However, at the beginning of 2020, the outbreak and fast spread of the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) disrupted all festival plans. In Wuhan City, China, 11 million people were placed on lockdown to stop the further spread of Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19). In addition to changes in the pace of life, unfamiliarity and uncontrollability enhanced people's stress. Given that this outbreak has highlighted the fragility of psychological resilience, attention must be paid to the psychological state of healthcare workers (HCW) during epidemics (Ho et al., 2020).",

More importantly, protective measures were the independent risk factor for the development of anxiety and depression, which is in line with one study about SARS, in which it was found the sufficient protection was a positive factor for mental health of HCW (Kaysen et al., 2003). However, the sudden occurrence of the COVID-19 outbreak, which was both fast and widespread, the particular timing (coinciding with the Spring Festival) and traffic control-led to a shortage of masks, goggles, face shields and protective clothing. Under such conditions, some HCW used masks repeatedly and did not drink water or go to the bathroom to prolong the life of their protective equipment, which might reduce its effectiveness and increase the risk of infection. We suggest that these physical and psychological responses induced symptoms of anxiety and depression.",

However, the conclusion that contact history affects psychological health is controversial. Authors of one study about SARS announced that contact with an infected patient was not an adverse factor for psychological health (Maunder et al., 2006). In contrast, authors of another study indicated that HCW who had more possible exposure to SARS were 2-3 times more likely to have high PTS levels than those without exposure (Kaysen et al., 2003; Wu et al., 2009). In our study, when compared to those who had had no contact, HCW who had contact with diagnosed patients were approximately twice as likely to develop anxiety and depression. This is because contact with infected and suspected patients will induce fear and uncertainty for the virus, as there is no effective medication for treating COVID-19 pneumonia, and the prognosis is inclusive. Additionally, the incubation time of COVID-19 pneumonia is longer than SARS, meaning the sustained and cumulative stress over time turns into anxiety.",

In addition to these previous findings, we firstly unveil that job titles affect stress as a result of contact history (Table 5 and supplementary figure 3). The senior and junior titles were found to have significant differences in stress (Supplementary Figure 2), which could be explained by the observation that juniors have more contact with infected patients and specimens than senior HCW (Supplementary Figure 3). Interestingly, HCW with all three types of title have endured stress (median PSS=28, 28, 26 respectively), but only intermediate titles were an independent risk factor for anxiety (Table 3). This is because, firstly, there was more chance for the intermediate HCW to have contact with diagnosed patients (Supplementary Figure 3). Moreover, HCW with intermediate titles are more likely to work in high-risk units but may have less ability to deal with emotion (Angerer et al., 2008). Finally, intermediate HCW may have more pressure than senior titled HCW in terms of income, family burden and promotions (Wang et al., 2010). Therefore, intermediate titled HCW were the most susceptible to anxiety in the COVID-19 epidemic.",

This indicates that, during the COVID-19 pandemic, it is helpful for HCW to have access to protective equipment support and that intermediate and female HCW should be given primary concern and psychological support. Various strategies can be adopted in that regard. Firstly, intermediate and female HCW can be teamed up with experienced medical personnel to increase their practical abilities. Secondly, psychological education is needed to help HCW reduce pressure, so as to improve their psychological endurance. Thirdly, the activities of Balint Groups should be promoted to improve their ability to deal with challenging emotions and ensure the quality of medical treatment. Finally, promotions and financial incentives may be used to encourage HCW during disease epidemics.",
