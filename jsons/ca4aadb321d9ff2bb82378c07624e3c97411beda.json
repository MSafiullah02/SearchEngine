Main psychiatric diagnoses were affective disorders in 121 patients (ICD-10 F3), schizophrenia and related disorders in 41 (F2), addictive disorders in 21, and others in 13. The CGI-scores were evenly distributed between the groups with a mean of 4.6 (SD 1.7) and so were most symptoms described. More than half of the patients from all groups felt that they now had to endure much more mental distress due to the pandemic. A quarter of the patients with affective disorders reported increased difficulties sleeping. What stood out in comparison with the other diagnoses was, that half or more of the patients with addictions complained that their daily routines were badly affected, they were afraid of the future, had financial worries, suffered from isolation (also on open wards) and experienced increased irritability (Pearson Chi-square < 0.01). Among the explanations offered spontaneously by the patients was that the crisis had sent prices of illegal substances sky high. The pandemic appears to burden patients with mental disorders from all diagnostic groups, disrupting their daily routines, cutting their social ties, increasing their financial worries and fears of the future. The early impact of dynamic markets not usually monitored by medical personnel was a surprise to us and may need increased attention in times of crisis.",
