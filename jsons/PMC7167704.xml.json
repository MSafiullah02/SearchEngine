Our data, the limited existing studies of M. catarrhalis and cough duration in children, and the increasing data on its prevalence in the lower airways of children with chronic lung disease suggest it may have an important role in chronic cough development in children, warranting further study. Importantly, data on whether the association between M.catarrhalis and chronic cough is related to its presence as a single pathogen or due to co\u2010infection with other viruses and/or bacteria are not available. Our analyses controlled for co\u2010infection, but evaluating the role of M. catarrhalis as a single pathogen was not feasible given it was found in isolation in only 4.4% of episodes.",

It might reflect the more aggressive and supervised management of severe acute disease received in hospital and subsequent reduced risk of adverse sequelae.",

The seasonal findings are consistent with a reduced risk of cough at day\u201028 in those for whom the outcome was known, suggesting an illness with a more acute duration. This may also explain both the rate of loss to follow\u2010up prior in the 2\u2010weeks following ED presentation and the increased risk of cough status being unknown if the cough duration at ED presentation was greater than 14\u2010days. Data from systematic reviews suggest only 10% of children attending primary care with a cough have this symptom 21\u2010days later.47 Hence, it is plausible that many children lost to follow\u2010up had stopped coughing and parents chose not to continue in the study, particularly given the study incentive of providing children with rapid access (within 2\u2010weeks of day 28) to a pediatric pulmonologist if persistent cough was present.17 The association with Bocavirus and cough status being unknown is difficult to explain and may be either an anomaly of the data or related to milder illness given the severity of Bocavirus respiratory infections in children may be more dependent on viral load and/or co\u2010detection.48\n",

The single\u2010center study population may also not be representative of all children with cough presenting to EDs, particularly given our lower recruitment rates in young infants.

In contrast, we found a possible role for M. catarrhalis in developing a persistent cough post\u2010ARI. Our microbiological findings are likely to have little immediate application in the clinical setting, however they provide important epidemiological data to better understand the etiology of the development of chronic cough in children. Further studies collecting prospective clinical specimens in the weeks following an ARI are warranted, particularly given the burden of chronic cough in children and its relationship with chronic lung disease.",
