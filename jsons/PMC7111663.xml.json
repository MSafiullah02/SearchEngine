In south-west China, Guan Du district is one of these areas. Guan Du is a suburban region of Kunming, the capital of Yunnan province. China is a multi-ethnic country and has 56 ethnicities. Yunnan province is a multi-ethnic area with 52 ethnic groups, and is one of the poorest provinces in China. This study population is representative of the poor population in China. A computerized death registration system was established in 1998, which is validated for completeness every 3 years in this region. In 2003, Guan Du had a population of 335,622 (178,099 males and 157,523 females), with 17 townships and 157,604 families. The total area was 1025 km2. The major sources of income in this region are grain, vegetables and flowers. The per-capita income among peasants was USD$675.5 From 1998 to 2003, the proportion of the population who were illiterate or semi-literate declined from 15.3% to 6.7%,5, 6 and the per-capita income among peasants increased steadily at an average rate of 13% per year.5, 6 The local government has invested increasing public health expenditure on disease prevention and control, particularly for prevention and curative programmes for specific diseases (tuberculosis, endemic diseases, human immunodeficiency virus/acquired immunodeficiency syndrome, severe acute respiratory syndrome, etc.). Since 1984, an immunization system has been in place in Kunming to immunize and monitor diseases routinely. Kunming has engaged in health promotion through some educational programmes and by establishing smoking-free public areas.",

            "text": "COPD is a major cause of death in this suburban region. In most parts of the world, COPD mortality is still increasing in response to past increases in smoking. It has been estimated that COPD accounts for 35% of all smoking-related deaths.13 Passive exposure to cigarette smoke increases the frequency of respiratory symptoms in adults.14 In the USA, COPD is a leading cause of death,15 and the annual COPD death rate has been increasing over the past 20 years.16 In the UK, male mortality from COPD has been decreasing for 30 years, while female mortality has risen steadily during the same period.17 In Australia, the per-capita mortality burden of COPD has decreased in males but increased substantially in females. The increasing trend in mortality due to COPD in females found in most developed countries18 is partly explained by the increasing numbers of female smokers in the preceding few decades. However, in the present study, premature mortality due to COPD showed a steady decline over time in both males and females. The 1996 national survey in China indicated that the prevalence of smoking was 34.1% (63% in men, 3.8% in women).19 A recent Chinese study indicated that the smoking rate has reduced significantly but was still over 60% in men.20 Kunming has the largest consumption of tobacco in China.21 The decrease in YLL due to COPD indicates that there has been some success in smoking control during the period of economic growth. However, the present study found that females had a slightly higher premature mortality burden due to COPD than males throughout the study period, highlighting the importance of risk factors other than smoking for COPD in women. Cooking indoors with biomass fuel is common in the study region, and women are usually more exposed to this risk factor. The use of solid fuel has also been shown to be an important risk factor for COPD.22 The nature of this additional aetiologic factor needs to be explored further.",
