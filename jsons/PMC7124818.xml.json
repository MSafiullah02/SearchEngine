The clinical presentation of PVE ranges from mild to severe, based on clinical signs and physical examination [2,3]. The most common clinical signs in puppies include acute severe vomiting and bloody diarrhoea, fever, dehydration and lethargy [4]. Complications such as cardiac damage, which may result in death or permanent myocardial damage [5], and systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS) prior to sepsis have been described [6].",

The use of non-invasive specimens such as saliva provides several advantages compared to invasive methods, being safer for the personal and the patient, easier to collect, pain-free and causes reduced sampling stress [10]. Saliva can have potential advantages versus others non-invasive samples such as faeces, which usually need a laborious pre-treatment prior to its analysis. In particular, in the case of PVE, it has been described a poor sensitivity of faeces when used in rapid antigen ELISA test [11]. For this, it is envisioned that saliva can play an increasingly important role in the early diagnosis and monitoring of diseases [12].",

Proteomic techniques have become widely used with the aim of discovering disease-related biomarkers in diverse biological fluids that could be used in routine practice for early diagnosis, prognosis or treatment monitoring [14,15]. Over the last several years, novel technologies such as the use of isobaric tags have greatly increase the sensitivity of the proteomic analysis [[16], [17], [18]]. Tandem Mass Tags (TMT) allow for relative simultaneous quantification of differentially labelled peptides [19] since each sample is marked and distinguished by differences on their reporter ion masses [20,21]. However, there is still a scarcity of reports using TMT technology in saliva samples, and no reports have been found describing the use of TMT to detected possible biomarkers of diagnosis and prognosis in PVE.",

Dogs with negative test result were enrolled to study. All dogs in test group were treated as described previously [22]. Briefly, fluid replacement therapy (dextrose 5% with a balanced crystalloid solution - lactated ringer, and hydroxyethyl starch), anti-emetics (metoclopramid 0.2-0.4 mg/kg, BID, subcutaneously, and ranitidin 2\u20134 mg/kg, BID, intramusculary), parenteral antibiotics (ampicillin 30 mg/kg, BID + amikasin 5\u201310 mg/kg, BID + metronidazol 25 mg/kg, BID), immune stimulator (imunex), probiotics and vitamins (E and C) were used.

The two most down-regulated proteins in the dogs with parvovirosis that survived, cathelicidin antimicrobial peptide (CAMP) and Rho-GDP dissociation inhibitor beta (ARHGDIB), have protective role against infections and are involved in the inflammatory response. Cathelicidins are a group of short cationic antimicrobial peptides with an important role in the protection against infections [[33], [34], [35]]. The main source of CAMPs are the specific granules of neutrophils, which are released upon neutrophil activation [36,37], although they can be produced by other cells such as epithelial cells at mucosal surfaces [38]. CAMPs are known to regulate the activation of a wide variety of toll-like receptors, which plays important roles in the modulation of the inflammatory response during infections [39,40]. In addition, antimicrobial activity has been described in CAMPs, and the loss of cathelidicin expression has been reported to increase the susceptibility to Escherichia coli infection in mice [33,34]. Rho-GDP dissociation inhibitor beta (ARHGDIB) is primarily expressed in cells of a hematopoietic lineage and belongs to the RhoGDI family, which are known to regulate Rho-GTPases [41]. ARHGDIB showed an ability to decrease human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) replication in cell lines and can be used as a biomarker of HIV-1 infection [42]. ARHGDIB expression has been also proposed as suppressor of metastasis and predictor of prognosis in human patients with bladder cancer, in which ARHGDIB positive tumours are related with longer disease-free and disease-specific survival rates [43].",

Lipocalins are a family of proteins that usually carry lipids or other hydrophobic or amphiphilic compounds accommodated in a cavity within their conformation, including steroids, hormones and metabolites such as vitamins and cofactors [44]. Furthermore, lipocalins have been reported to be modulators of cell growth and metabolism, and regulators of the immune response [45,46]. Although little is known about LCN9, a related protein, neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin, NGAL, has been associated with bacterial infection in humans [[47], [48], [49]]. BPiFB2 belongs to a family of proteins considered as a key component of the innate immune response against Gram-negative bacteria [50], but the physiological functions of the BPIFB family still remain largely unknown [51]. Despite this, a previous study on BPIFB2 has reported the involvement of BPIFB proteins regulating enterovirus infection, with BPIFB6 assisting the enterovirus replication by controlling secretory pathway trafficking and Golgi complex morphology [51].",

APO-A1 is the major protein component of high density lipoproteins in human and other mammals [52] and the decreased levels APO-A1 observed in the present study are in concordance with other responses described in different canine diseases such as leishmaniosis [53] or canine idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy [25], suggesting that APO-A1 could be a feasible biomarker in dogs. Lower expression of neutrophil esterase was observed in both groups of dogs with PVE when compared to control group. Neutrophil esterase is a serine proteinase with important antimicrobial effects that are released by neutrophils and enhances inflammatory responses. Genetic mutations in its gene (ELANE) has been identified in forms of hereditary neutropenia in humans and dogs [54]. There is a case reported of a mutation in ELANE gene as the cause of chronic parvovirosis in a woman [55]. The activation of complement C3 supports local inflammatory responses against pathogens and initiates the humoral immune response, playing a central role in the activation of the complement system [56]. Increased C3 expression has also been reported in dogs with canine babesiosis [57]. In our study, different hypotheses could explain the down-regulation of complement C3 in saliva of dog with PVE such as a reduction due to cleavage of the protein in order to activate complement cascade, or as a consequence of an immunodeficiency [58]. Histidine-rich glycoprotein is a relatively abundant plasma protein with a wide range of targets and functions, such as regulating clotting and fibrinolysis, and angiogenesis [59,60]. HRG roles in anti-inflammatory effects and pathogen control have been proposed since, after experimental Streptococcus pyogenes infection, HRG-deficient mice showed higher bacterial burden and pro-inflammatory cytokines than wild-type mice [61].",

Desmogleins are a family of calcium-binding transmembrane glycoproteins which play an important role in the desmosomes transmembrane component [62]. In humans, salivary levels of DSG1 and DSG3 are correlated with serum anti DSG titres, proposing salivary DSG as suitable markers of diagnosis of Pemphigus vulgaris [63]. Clusterins are secretory glycoproteins that are involved in multiple physiopathological processes, including lipid metabolism, tissue remodelling, reproduction, transport and cell apoptosis [64]. These proteins have been classically considered as markers of cell death [65]; however, protective roles such as anti-apoptotic or prevention of complement attacking complex functions of clusterins have been suggested [66,67].",

For example, the network created by comparison of survival and control groups revealed that fibrinogen and ubiquitin complexes could play important roles in the development of the disease. The down-regulation of fibrinogen observed in the present study is in contrast with other reports that showed increased levels of fibrinogen in dogs with parvovirosis [73], leishmaniosis [74] or babesiosis [75]; although dogs with uncomplicated babesiosis showed higher levels of fibrinogen that those with SIRS or multiple organ dysfunction syndrome (MODS) [75]. This could be explained by the fact that, although fibrinogen is considered as a positive acute phase protein in dogs, in disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) and hyperfibrinolysis the concentration of fibrinogen falls due to fibrinogen cleavage to form soluble fibrin monomers [76,77]. Progressive decrease of fibrinogen levels was also reported in dogs during acute haemorrhage [78], as occurs in parvovirosis. On the other hand, ubiquitins have been shown to be involved in numerous intracellular processes such as cell cycle control, apoptosis, DNA repair, regulation of transcription, stress responses, and targeting cellular proteins for degradation by the 26S proteasome [79]. As described in previous reports, viruses often make use of the ubiquitin conjugation to target for degradation of cellular proteins that might otherwise affect the replication of the virus [80].",

Therefore this could be considered as a pilot study, and further validation studies with a larger number of dogs should be made to confirm these findings. The changes in protein expression and the subsequent bioinformatics analysis described in the present study were based on the analysis of saliva and, therefore, further studies are desirable to discern if they reflect systemic alterations. Nevertheless, despite these limitations, our results indicate that PVE can produce changes in saliva proteome that can reflect an inflammatory response and changes in coagulation system and immune response \u2013 among other biological processes.",
