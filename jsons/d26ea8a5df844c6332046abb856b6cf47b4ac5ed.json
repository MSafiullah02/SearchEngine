Although these epidemiological models are useful for estimating the dynamics of transmission, and evaluating the impact of intervention strategies, they have some serious limitations (Funk et al., 2018 , Johansson et al., 2019 . First, the epidemiological models consist of ordinary differential equations that have many unknown parameters, and depend on many assumptions. It is difficult to translate public interventions to these parameters. Most analyses used hypothesized parameters, which often lead to fitting data very poor. Health officers desperately want to track the trajectory of epidemics and accurately estimate the peak time and umber of cases, duration, and ending time and number of cases of Covid-19 for their health policy plan. However, the forecasting results of using the classical epidemiological models such as Susceptible-Exposed-Infectious-Removed (SEIR) models are highly unreliable. Second, the successful application of public health intervention planning highly depends on the model parameter identifiability.",

We viewed the interventions as treatments where multiple interventions were administered at different time points. The number of new cases were taken as treatment responses. The ability to accurately estimate effects of public health interventions over time would allow health officers to determine what intervention strategies should be used and the optimal time at which to implement them (Lim et al., 2018) . Recurrent Intervention Network (RIN) (Lim et al., 2018) where a recurrent neural network architecture for forecasting a nation's response (number of new cases) to a series of planned interventions were used to forecast and evaluate multiple public health interventions for Covid-19 worldwide. Potential outcomes of RIN were trajectory of the spread of Covid-19. university dormitories. To quantify comprehensive intervention strategies, an intervention variable was used as an input variable for each block of RIN. We cluster all the countries in the world into several groups. For each group, a value (weight) was assigned to each group such that the average prediction error of CRN was minimum. The RIN is taken as a general framework for investigating how Covid-19 evolves under different intervention plans, how individual nation responds to intervention over time, but also which are optimal timings for assigning interventions. Therefore, this approach will provide new tools to improve public health planning and policy making.",

The latent state of the RNN encoder after reading in the entire input time series (past trajectory of Covid-19), is the representation (compressed latent features of the entire input time series) of the input trajectory of Covid-19. Unlike the standard decoder where the decoder reconstructs back the input time series from the latent representation, the RNN decoder uses the learned features of the dynamics of Covid-19 in the RNN encoder to forecast the potential response time series, given a sequence of planned public health interventions as an input to the RNN decoder. The feature vector learned in the RNN encoder is then provided as an input to the RNN decoder which initiate prediction of the future dynamics of Covid-19 under the future interventions (Figure 2). Training the RIN RIN training consisted of RNN encoder training and RNN decoder training. We first introduced RNN encoder training procedures. The basic RNN unit in the RIN consisted of input layer, hidden layer and output layer. The input variables in the RNN encoder included covariates such as density of population, traffic flow, health facility resources, GDP, and social-economic status, intervention variable and the numbers of cases (potential outcomes) at the time .",
