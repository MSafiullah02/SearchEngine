Classically, the neutropenic patient is considered most at risk with bacterial and fungal infections predominating in this period. However, the increasing use of novel aggressive chemotherapies and immunosuppressant agents, including biological response-modifying agents such as monoclonal antibodies, has led to a growing population of patients with deficits in cell-mediated immunity (CMI). This exposes them to risks of serious viral and fungal infection that may be prolonged (Table 1\n).",

Neutropenic sepsis in patients having anti-cancer treatment is defined as a neutrophil count equal to or lower than 0.5 \u00d7 109/litre with either a temperature higher than 38\u00b0C or other signs or symptoms consistent with clinically significant sepsis. Mortality from untreated neutropenic sepsis ranges from 2 to 21%1 and empirical therapy for immunocompromised patients is essential. There are several common pitfalls in the management of suspected infection, as follows.\u2022The concept of empirical treatment, which should be applied to patients where no source/organism is identified, is frequently misunderstood. Patients with infiltrates on chest X-ray, obvious line or soft-tissue infection, or with pathogens already isolated, should receive targeted therapy as determined by national guidelines not the \u2018empirical\u2019 neutropenic fever regimen.\u2022Differentiation between uncomplicated neutropenic fever and life-threatening neutropenic sepsis is not always made and the terms are sometimes used interchangeably. Sepsis requires additional rapid interventions and appropriate care bundles for sepsis management.\u2022Definition of response to antibiotics is often determined incorrectly by resolution of fever. There is an unrealistic expectation that fever will settle rapidly whereas in reality the duration of fever in documented bacterial infection is 7\u201310 days.2 This leads to inappropriate addition and/or switching of antimicrobials. Markers of response should concentrate on clinical variables and include reducing fever haemodynamic stability and normalization of acute phase response markers; response should not be determined solely by rapid defervescence of fever.\n",

It must be remembered that severe infection may present with hypothermia. Monotherapy with extended-spectrum beta-lactam agents has been shown to be equivalent to and less toxic than aminoglycoside combinations in several meta-analyses and is recommended in most guidelines.4 Concerns regarding these analyses remain, in that they compared different \u03b2-lactam agents in different studies and did not take into account the changing spectrum of diseases over time. These concerns have been addressed by a mixed treatment analysis demonstrating a benefit for monotherapy with ureidopenicillins such as piperacillin/tazobactam (Tazocin\u00ae).3 This treatment was associated with the lowest mortality (although not necessarily infectious mortality) and was not affected by year of study. Empirical use of glycopeptides is now discouraged. However, when deciding on initial empirical therapy, it is most important to consider clinical and microbiological findings. Combination therapy may still be indicated and centres with a high incidence of resistance should undertake a risk assessment. Key NICE recommendations are outlined in Practice points.",

Many problems arise with patients with unresponsive fever where fungal and/or viral infection may be suspected. Empirical antifungal therapy is still considered by many as a standard of care for patients with refractory fever but it inevitably results in massive overuse of costly and potentially toxic antifungal drugs in patients who do not actually have invasive fungal disease. In solid organ transplantation, the incidence of invasive fungal disease (IFD) varies, being lowest in renal transplantation and highest in small bowel transplantation.5 Most infections are caused by Candida species6 except in lung transplant patients where aspergillosis causes invasive disease and tracheobronchitis in up to 9% of patients.7 Liver transplant patients are often considered at high risk of mould infection but the incidence is relatively low (1\u20139%) unless specific risk factors (re-transplantation, renal failure) are present. In haematology and stem cell transplant patients where azole prophylaxis against Candida is widely used, invasive aspergillosis is the major IFD seen with rates ranging from less than 5 to 15%.8\n",

The combined insult of underlying disease, newer treatment modalities and recurrent infection can lead to profound and prolonged immunoparesis. Major advances have been made in molecular diagnosis allowing a move away from empirical therapy of refractory fever. However, diagnostic accuracy is not a fixed feature of a specific test but rather a reflection of how that test is used in a particular patient population. Understanding test performance in different groups is fundamental to maximizing clinical benefits of improved diagnostic methods.\n",
