Initial empiric therapeutic choices may be standardized and initiated on the basis of patient clinical status, underlying disease, and/or risk for infection with a multidrug-resistant pathogen.

RADTs have highly variable sensitivities (10%-75%) and specificities (50%-100%) depending on the viral target, age of the patient, sample collection, and duration of symptoms prior to testing [4] [5] [6] .

In addition, DFA testing can detect human metapneumovirus (hMPV) [6] .

DFA testing can be performed in as little as 30-60 min, and shell vial and R-Mix rapid cell cultures (Quidel/Diagnostic Hybrids) generally identify respiratory viruses in 24-48 h [6] . If these tests are performed on site, the time to virus detection can be within a time frame that could affect patient management. However, these tests are not widely available outside larger hospitals and reference laboratories. Although these 8 viruses are responsible for a large number of respiratory tract infections, bocavirus, selected coronaviruses (229E, OC43, NL63, and HKU-1), parainfluenza 4, and rhinovirus are also important causes of respiratory disease and are generally only detected using NAATs.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 514, "end": 517, "text": "[6]", "ref_id": "BIBREF5"}, {"start": 753, "end": 756, "text": "[5,", "ref_id": "BIBREF4"}, {"start": 757, "end": 759, "text": "6,", "ref_id": "BIBREF5"}, {"start": 760, "end": 763, "text": "10]", "ref_id": "BIBREF9"}, {"start": 945, "end": 948, "text": "[6]", "ref_id": "BIBREF5"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Nonmolecular Diagnostic Testing for Viral Respiratory Infections"}, {"text": "Because antiviral therapies are currently limited to the treatment of influenza A, influenza B, cytomegalovirus pneumonia, and varicella zoster virus pneumonia, it is often argued that the specific identification of other viruses is not relevant, because the information would not change patient management. From a treatment standpoint, this may currently be true; however, the respiratory viruses cause similar illnesses, and diagnosis based on clinical symptoms alone can be highly inaccurate [11] . For example, a study by Poehling et al revealed that physicians who used only clinical symptoms recognized influenza in only 28% of hospitalized children and 17% of nonhospitalized children with laboratory-confirmed influenza [11] . Therefore, establishing the viral etiological characteristics of the illness is often highly dependent on accurate diagnostic testing. In addition, new therapeutic agents for respiratory viruses are in development, and clinical trials for these agents will need rapid diagnostics that detect a broad range of viral pathogens. Once these new drugs are approved, clinical laboratories will need the tools to identify each virus so that appropriate antiviral therapy can be rapidly initiated. In addition, during the first weeks of the 2009 influenza A H1N1 outbreak in the spring of 2009, multiple influenza viruses were cocirculating [5] . It was necessary to subtype influenza A strains to differentiate seasonal influenza A/H1, seasonal influenza A/H3, and 2009 influenza A H1N1. Subtyping is necessary to provide relevant information needed for appropriate selection of antiviral therapy, in particular for acutely ill patients. Antiviral resistance testing of influenza isolates from 2009 (www.cdc.gov/flu) revealed that the circulating seasonal influenza A/H1 strains were resistant to oseltamivir (99.6%), and seasonal influenza A/H3 and 2009 influenza A H1N1 were resistant to the adamantanes (100%).

The burden of nosocomial influenza can be high, incurring additional costs for diagnostic tests, increased morbidity, and extended hospitalization [17, 18] . Therefore, rapid diagnostic tests are needed to identify patients with influenza at admission, in order to prevent nosocomial transmission by facilitating isolation and cohorting decisions [18] . Studies have documented substantial nosocomial transmission of hMPV in pediatric units [20] , as well as in chronic care facilities [21] , similar to what is seen with RSV. During the height of RSV season, many institutions must cohort RSV-positive children because of a lack of private rooms. However, dual infections with RSV and hMPV do occur. Limiting diagnostics to RSV alone in a cohorting scenario could put other seriously ill children at risk for acquisition of a second viral infection with hMPV. The meaning of mixed viral infections can be defined only if testing is comprehensive. Broad test panels also allow for monitoring the epidemiologic patterns of respiratory disease and for identifying new or reemerging pathogens.

Often FDA-approved/ cleared kits do not contain nucleic acid extraction reagents, so additional equipment and reagents are necessary and can add $3-$15 per test. Batch testing of samples may reduce the cost per test; however, often batching is not practical if the time to result is delayed beyond a period that would affect either clinical management or infection control practices. Instrumentation costs for molecular tests can be substantial, with real-time instrumentation costing on average $35,000-$85,000 per instrument, and higher volume laboratories may require multiple instruments. Laboratories must also calculate the cost for technical time, which is again highly variable depending on the test complexity and run size. Finally, the costs for quality control, proficiency testing, and competency assessment all affect the overall cost per test.

NAATs are especially suited for the identification of respiratory pathogens that are not routinely or easily cultured (eg, hMPV, bocavirus, parainfluenza 4, and Chlamydophila pneumoniae), pathogens that are dangerous to culture (eg, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus), pathogens for which the time to detection by traditional means is often too delayed to affect patient care (eg, tube cell culture for influenza), and pathogens for which serologic testing is difficult to interpret (eg, C. pneumoniae). In most cases, NAATs offer enhanced sensitivity over culture methods, RADTS, and DFA testing [5, 6, 10] . The specificity of NAATs varies with target and assay design but is generally very high. In addition, laboratorydeveloped NAATs validated in accordance with the Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments (CLIA) requirements can be used to identify new pathogens until FDA-approved/ cleared in vitro diagnostic (IVD) devices become available.

In contrast, the detection of other bacteria, such as Streptococcus pneumoniae, may indicate infection or simply colonization. Therefore, interpretation of the molecular detection of many bacterial pathogens must be viewed in light of the clinical specimen (sterile vs nonsterile body site) and determination of the quantity of organisms present. In addition, molecular methods must include all potential pathogens, even though culture is still required for antimicrobial susceptibility testing. For these reasons, there is currently a scarcity of FDA-approved/cleared assays for nonviral respiratory pathogens (Table 1 ). For such targets as the atypical pneumonia pathogens, the interpretation of NAAT results is generally not an issue, quantitative tests are not necessarily indicated, and NAATS could replace traditional test methods.

Benefits of this assay include low technical complexity, allowing for potential point-of-care testing; minimal hands-on time (15-20 min); test turnaround time of ,2 h; and containment of the sample, extracted nucleic acids, and amplicons in the test cartridge.

The comparator methods for influenza A subtyping, RSV subtyping, and hMPV and rhinovirus detection were wellcharacterized RT-PCR assays followed by bidirectional sequencing. xTAG RVP sensitivity for each target was determined as follows: The benefits of the xTAG RVP assay include the broad spectrum of viruses detected by a single test, with a cost per test comparable to real-time assays that only target up to 3 analytes. The subtyping of influenza A viruses as seasonal influenza A/H1 or seasonal influenza A/H3 or the identification of an ''unsubtypeable'' virus has proven to be an important aid in identifying novel influenza A strains. A limitation of the assay is the decreased sensitivity for the detection of certain adenovirus strains. In-house validation studies by our laboratory have found that by reducing the positive cutoff MFI level from 300 to 150 for adenovirus, improved sensitivity for the detection of adenovirus was obtained without loss of specificity (unpublished data). Additional limitations of the assay include the time to final results, number of required steps, technical handson time, and a potential for amplicon contamination.

The fluorescent signal increases with each cycle as additional reporter dye molecules are cleaved from their respective probes.
