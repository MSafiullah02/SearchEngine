Notwithstanding its potential benefits, VA-ECMO remains associated with significant morbidity and mortality [1]. This is partly due to the patients\u2019 critical condition, but also to complications related to VA-ECMO, notably renal failure, sepsis, bleeding, thromboembolism, limb ischemia, and multi-organ failure [3, 4].",

Beside this particular aspect, several additional mechanisms may contribute to lung damage and dysfunction in the setting of VA-ECMO. The latter may be assimilated to a simplified cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) circuit, and both techniques share common pitfalls with respect to lung physiology. CPB may alter pulmonary function after cardiac surgery by promoting an inflammatory response via biomaterial-dependent and biomaterial-independent factors, the collapse of lungs during the procedure, the shunting of pulmonary circulation, and the phenomenon of lung reperfusion injury which takes place once CPB is weaned [6]. During VA-ECMO, although such processes are attenuated, they still occur at different stages of support and at various degrees, and they may persist for days or weeks. In such conditions, the combination of a chronic inflammatory response, pulmonary congestion, and lung ischemia could foster a wealth of morphological and functional alterations which could interfere with patient\u2019s recovery and compromise the overall planned therapeutic strategy. In this review, we discuss the pathophysiological mechanisms and potential clinical implications of the pulmonary complications associated with VA-ECMO.",

CS generates kallikrein [12], which activates monocytes and polymorphonuclear cells (PMNs), and triggers the intrinsic coagulation cascade, resulting in the rapid generation of thrombin and fibrin within the systemic circulation [13]. Thrombin activates platelets and endothelial cells (ECs) and induces the secretion of pro-inflammatory mediators and growth factors, such as interleukin-6 (IL-6), interleukin-8 (IL-8), or platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) [13]. The extrinsic coagulation pathway is activated to a lesser extent, mainly through the release of tissue factor (TF) by activated monocytes and ECs. CS also generates bradykinine [12], which activates ECs and leukocytes, and elicits hemodynamic alterations including systemic vasodilation and pulmonary vasoconstriction [14]. Complement activation occurs via the alternative pathway, generating the anaphylatoxins C3a and C5a, which activate ECs. C5a is also a potent mediator of leukocyte chemotaxis. A peak of complement activation occurs within 1\u20132 h of ECMO onset, followed by a progressive decreases over the next 2 to 3 days [15].\n",

TNF-\u03b1 plays a major role in the amplification of the early inflammatory response, by upregulating pro-inflammatory cytokines and prostaglandin synthesis, activating PMNs and ECs, and stimulating reactive oxygen species (ROS) production [18, 19].",

Activated platelets foster the generation of pro-inflammatory cytokines, thromboxane A2 (TXA2), platelet-activating factor (PAF), P-selectin, and serotonin. TXA2 induces ECs activation and local vasoconstriction, while serotonin and P-selectin promote PMN-endothelial interactions [20]. Platelet activation is maximal at the initiation of VA-ECMO and progressively decreases over hours to days but remains persistent [21]. EC activation leads to their detachment from the basal membrane and disassembly of tight junctions, increasing vascular permeability with the development of sub-endothelial edema [22]. Moreover, activated ECs display an upregulated expression of adhesion molecules favoring PMN adhesion and transendothelial migration [23], and they also release cytokines, tissue factor, and ROS. Circulating PMNs, monocytes, and macrophages are spontaneously activated by tubing surfaces [24]. Furthermore, PMNs are activated by complement, histamine, serotonin, and PAF, which facilitate their adhesion to ECs, diapedesis, tissue infiltration [25], and the release of cytotoxic mediators, including proteases, cytokines, and ROS.",

Still, a delayed persisting inflammatory response can be observed several days after VA-ECMO implementation, whose underlying mechanisms may involve the presence of low concentration of endotoxin within the circulation, which may sustain complement activation, cytokine release, and ROS generation, to elicit a sepsis-like inflammation [27, 28].

In the setting of cardiogenic shock, these disturbances may worsen LV performance and dramatically reduce LV stroke volume [31, 32]. In addition, if LV residual function is insufficient to permit aortic valve opening, progressive LV distension will occur, due to persisting venous return through pulmonary and bronchial veins into the left atrium and through Thebesian veins into the LV, with concomitant increase of LV end-diastolic pressure. At worst, stagnation of blood within dilated left cardiac chambers may favor the formation of clots and induce pulmonary vein thrombosis [33].",

Firstly, interstitial edema increases the thickness of the alveolar-capillary barrier, hence the diffusion distance for oxygen between alveoli and parenchymal cells, whose oxygenation primarily depends on oxygen diffusing from alveolar spaces [36]. Secondly, alveolar edema results in a marked reduction of local alveolar PO2 (PAO2). Alveolar epithelial cells, normally exposed to PAO2 above 100 mmHg, are sensitive to hypoxia from PAO2 below 50 mmHg, which may occur in alveoli flooded by pulmonary edema [37]. Alveolar hypoxia can destabilize intercellular junctions, impair barrier permeability, impede alveolar fluid clearance and surfactant production by pneumocytes, induce local vasoconstriction and neoangiogenesis, and finally trigger local and systemic inflammation [37\u201339]. Therefore, pulmonary congestion during VA-ECMO creates a vicious circle in which VA-ECMO-induced SIRS and LV pressure overload promote pulmonary edema, leading to alveolar hypoxia which maintains SIRS [37]. Alveolar hemorrhages are another frequent consequence of the combination of pulmonary congestion and the requirement of anticoagulation during ECLS. Even if massive hemoptysis is rare [40], local alveolar hemorrhages are frequent and sustain local inflammatory changes [41, 42].",

Chest ultrasound is an effective and reliable alternative method to assess interstitial edema, pleural effusion, and parenchymal consolidation [43]. Echocardiographic examination is mandatory, as it may show left heart dilation and indirect signs of cardiac congestion, such as spontaneous contrast echoes or the presence of \u201csludge\u201d in heart chambers, as well as the absence of aortic valve opening [44]. Hemodynamic monitoring using pulmonary artery catheter (PAC) has been associated with improved survival in cardiogenic shock [45], notably in the context of mechanical cardiac support. PAC is particularly helpful to identify patients with cardiac distension, by demonstrating elevated left-sided filling pressure [46]. It has been shown that combining a value of pulmonary artery diastolic pressure > 25 mmHg (as a surrogate of pulmonary capillary wedge pressure) with evidence of pulmonary edema on chest X-ray could identify patients with subclinical LV distension [47]. Although these data need further validation, PAC is now advocated by most experts to help manage patients under VA-ECMO [48].",

Reducing VA-ECMO flow to decrease LV afterload, as long as residual LV ejection is present and peripheral perfusion maintained, should also be considered. The insertion of an intra-aortic balloon pump (IAPB) is a further option to decrease LV afterload. As demonstrated by Br\u00e9chot et al., IABP in combination with VA-ECMO versus VA-ECMO alone is independently associated with less frequent hydrostatic pulmonary edema and a shorter duration of mechanical ventilation [50]. A recent meta-analysis found concomitant IABP to reduce in-hospital death and length of stay [51].",

In a porcine model, Vardi et al. demonstrated that the pulmonary capillary blood flow decreases dramatically as the VA-ECMO flow increases [57]. Moreover, in case of pulmonary congestion (see above), the upstream transmission of increased left atrial pressure reduces the transpulmonary perfusion gradient. Ventilation with high positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) might also impede pulmonary blood flow by compression of alveolar vessels [58]. Several additional mechanisms, including alveolar hypoxia, reduction of local NO production, and the actions of inflammatory mediators can promote vasoconstriction and the subsequent increase of pulmonary vascular resistance, with a reduction of pulmonary blood flow [59]. It is also noteworthy that blood flow through the bronchial arteries (BAs) is also reduced during VA-ECMO, due to attenuated pulsatility of the systemic circulation (which supplies the BAs). This can further limit blood supply to ischemic areas within the congested lung [60]. Eventually, these various hemodynamic changes may lead to hypoperfusion of the entire pulmonary vasculature, which, superimposed to alveolar hypoxia, can promote a state of global, persistent lung ischemia.",

An additional strategy relies in the upgrading of VA-ECMO to a hybrid system of veno-veno-arterial support, with an additional cannula inserted into the jugular vein, which provides oxygenated blood within the pulmonary arteries. This approach is sometimes used to treat the Harlequin syndrome (see below), but has not yet been evaluated to prevent lung injury during VA-ECMO.",

Furthermore, some degree of angiogenesis and vascular remodeling may also play some role, as alveolar hypoxia and chronic ischemia (typical of long-lasting VA-ECMO) can activate several pro-angiogenic cascades in alveolar cells, relying on the hypoxia-inducible factor family or the resistin-like molecule-\u03b1 [37].

Causative microorganisms comprise primarily Gram-negative bacilli, with Pseudomonas aeruginosa isolated in 18\u201325% of cases [67]. Diagnosis of VAP may be particularly troublesome, as the usual criteria of VAP are difficult to interpret in the setting of ECMO, and a high clinical index of suspicion coupled to early microbiological sampling are major clues to diagnosis [67]. Treatment of VAP on ECMO is challenging, notably because of the alterations of antibiotic pharmacokinetics occurring in this setting, and frequent therapeutic drug monitoring is therefore recommended [69].",

First, the rapid development of a systemic inflammatory response with pulmonary involvement is an unavoidable consequence of the artificial VA-ECMO circuitry. Second, due to retrograde blood flow within the thoracic aorta, peripheral VA-ECMO has the propensity to increase LV afterload, which may favor the congestion of alveoli already affected by the ongoing inflammation.",

Limited evidence from human observational studies and animal models indicates that VA-ECMO support for more than a few days may lead to severe structural changes of the lung parenchyma and interstitial fibrosis, which could result in long-term functional limitation. Clinicians in charge of VA-ECMO patients should be aware of its effects on lung physiology and should take all measures to limit such consequences, including the maintenance of VA-ECMO support as short as possible, the early diagnosis and treatment of cardiac overload and pulmonary congestion, and the application of lung-protective ventilation. Future studies specifically addressing the issue of the pulmonary consequences of VA-ECMO are warranted.",

Right side: EC injury favors fluid infiltration into both alveolar space and lung parenchyma, leading to pulmonary edema, which is aggravated by the increase of pulmonary vein pressure. Alveolar edema and decreased pulmonary artery perfusion lead to lung parenchymal ischemia which in turn maintains chronic inflammation and promotes neoangiogenesis and fibrosis generation",
