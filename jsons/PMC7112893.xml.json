Genetically very similar coronaviruses cause disease in turkeys and pheasants (Cavanagh et al., 2001, Cavanagh et al., 2002). Coronaviruses are enveloped viruses that replicate in the cell cytoplasm and contain an unsegmented, 5\u2032-capped and 3\u2032-polyadenylated, single-stranded, positive-sense RNA genome of 28\u201332 kb (de Vries et al., 1997, Lai and Cavanagh, 1997, Siddell, 1995). All coronavirus envelopes contain at least three membrane proteins, the spike glycoprotein (S), a small membrane protein (E) and an integral membrane protein (M). In addition, the coronavirus virion also contains a nucleocapsid protein (N) that interacts with the gRNA.",

            "text": "The assembly of full-length cDNAs corresponding to the coronavirus genomes was hampered due to some cDNAs, derived from regions of the replicase gene, being unstable in bacteria. However, despite this, three methods have been described for the assembly of full-length cDNAs of the genomic RNA of coronaviruses. The first method involved the assembly of a TGEV full-length cDNA in a bacterial artificial chromosome (BAC), immediately downstream of a viral RNA polymerase II promoter. Transfection of the BAC DNA into susceptible cells resulted in synthesis of infectious RNA and the recovery of infectious virus (Almaz\u00e1n et al., 2000). The second system involved the in vitro assembly of full-length cDNAs using a series of contiguous cDNAs with engineered specific restriction sites. Bacteriophage T7-RNA polymerase-derived RNA transcripts of the cDNAs were used to generate infectious virus (Yount et al., 2000, Yount et al., 2002, Yount et al., 2003). The third strategy involved the in vitro assembly of contiguous cDNAs followed by direct cloning into the genome of vaccinia virus. Infectious RNA transcripts were synthesised in vitro from the vaccinia virus DNA, using bacteriophage T7 RNA polymerase, and transfected into cells resulting in the recovery of infectious virus (Thiel et al., 2001). In an alternative strategy infectious IBV was recovered following transfection of restricted vaccinia virus DNA, containing the IBV full-length cDNA, into cells infected with recombinant fowlpox virus expressing T7 RNA polymerase (Casais et al., 2001). The vaccinia virus system has the advantage that the coronavirus full-length cDNA is present in a non-bacterial system and offers the opportunity of modifying the coronavirus cDNA by homologous recombination.",

The method relies on a two-step procedure. In the first step, a complete plasmid sequence is introduced into the vaccinia virus genome as a result of a single cross-over event involving homologous recombination between vaccinia virus sequences in the plasmid DNA and virus genome. The plasmid sequence contains the sequence being modified and a dominant selectable marker gene, Escherichia coli guanine Xanthine phosphoribosyltransferase (Ecogpt) (Mulligan and Berg, 1981), under the control of the vaccinia virus P7.5K promoter. Recombinant viruses expressing the gpt gene are selected for resistance against mycophenolic acid (MPA) in the presence of xanthine and hypoxanthine. In the second step, the MPA-resistant viruses are grown in the absence of selection, resulting in loss of the Ecogpt gene due to a single homologous recombination event between duplicated sequences, present as a result of the integration of the plasmid DNA. The second step results in one of two recombination events; return to the original input virus sequence, without modification to the virus or introduction of the modified sequences into the vaccinia virus genome. Both events should occur with equivalent efficiencies if the homology regions are of equal length.",

Having demonstrated that it was possible to produce a rIBV expressing a modified S gene we decided to investigate an alternative, quicker and simpler, procedure for modifying the full-length IBV cDNA within the vaccinia virus genome for the production of rIBVs containing the chimaeric S gene. In this paper, we describe the generation of two homologous rIBVs, rIBV-M41S-A and rIBV-M41S-B, in which the ectodomain sequence of the Beaudette S gene in vaccinia virus vNotI-IBVFL (Casais et al., 2001) was exchanged with the corresponding region from the M41 strain of IBV using the TDS method. Our results demonstrated that rIBVs can be generated following direct modification of the full-length IBV cDNA by homologous recombination within the vaccinia virus genome.",

The IBV isolates used were: (1) Beaudette-CK (Beau-CK; (Cavanagh et al., 1986)), a virus adapted for growth in CK cells that can grow on, but has not been adapted for growth on, Vero cells an African green monkey cell line; (2) Beau-R, a recombinant IBV (rIBV) produced from an infectious RNA transcribed from a full-length cDNA of Beau-CK (Casais et al., 2001); (3) M41-CK, a virus adapted from M41 (Darbyshire et al., 1979) for growth on CK cells but not Vero cells; and (4) BeauR-M41(S), a rIBV expressing a M41-CK/Beau-CK chimaeric S gene, produced following in vitro assembly of a full-length IBV cDNA in vaccinia virus, that grows on CK but not Vero cells (Casais et al., 2003). Beaudette and M41 belong to the same, Massachusetts, serotype. Vaccinia viruses were titrated on monkey kidney fibroblast cells (CV-1) grown in Dulbecco's-modified Eagle medium (D-MEM) supplemented with 0.37% (w/v) sodium bicarbonate, l-glutamine, 10% foetal calf serum and antibiotics. Baby hamster kidney cells (BHK-21) cells were grown in Glasgow medium supplemented with 0.37% (w/v) sodium bicarbonate, tryptose phosphate broth, l-glutamine, 10% foetal calf serum and antibiotics and used for the propagation of vaccinia viruses for isolation of virus DNA. Recombinant fowlpox virus rFPV-T7 (fpEFLT7pol; Britton et al., 1996), expressing the bacteriophage T7 RNA polymerase under the direction of the vaccinia virus P7.5 early/late promoter, was grown in chick embryo fibroblast (CEF) cells (Casais et al., 2001).",

However, to replace the 3.4 kb Beau-CK S sequence with the corresponding M41-CK S sequence an intermediary recombinant vaccinia virus, vNotI-IBV-\u0394SFL, containing the Beau-CK cDNA with the S gene deleted had to be produced. This was to avoid recombination events occurring within the S gene sequence if attempts were made to directly exchange the two sequences.

The chimaeric S gene consisted of the signal sequence, ectodomain and transmembrane regions derived from IBV M41-CK and the cytoplasmic tail domain from Beau-CK. The transmembrane domains are identical between the two sequences but the cytoplasmic tail domain of the M41-CK S protein is truncated by nine amino acids when compared to the Beau-CK S protein. We had previously indicated that we retained the Beau-CK cytoplasmic tail domain because this region of the S protein has been demonstrated to interact with other virus proteins (Godeke et al., 2000). The chimaeric S gene sequence, from pFRAG-3-M41S (Casais et al., 2003), was used to replace the corresponding Beau-CK S gene sequence in pGPT-IBV-StuI-BamHI, resulting in pGPT-M41S (Fig. 2).

The transmembrane domains from the two viruses are identical, therefore the chimaeric S gene has essentially the signal sequence and ectodomain sequences derived from M41-CK and transmembrane and C-terminal domain sequences from Beau-CK in pGPT-M41S. The flanking regions of the chimaeric S gene were as described in the legend for Fig. 1 and were present to allow integration of the chimaeric S gene by homologous recombination events into the IBV cDNA lacking an S gene sequence in vNotI-IBV-\u0394SFL. The various IBV gene sequences are as described in the legend for Fig. 1 and the relevant restriction sites are shown.",

The diagram represents a potential recombination event between the replicase sequence in one of the flanking regions in pGPT-IBV-\u0394S and the corresponding region in the IBV cDNA in vNotI-IBVFL. The single step recombination event results in the integration of the complete plasmid sequence into the IBV cDNA in the vaccinia virus genome. Resultant recombinant vaccinia viruses are selected in the presence of MPA due to incorporation of the GPT gene under the control of a vaccinia virus promoter. The integrated sequences result in tandem repeat sequences within the IBV cDNA. Such resultant vaccinia viruses are relatively unstable and are only able to maintain the duplicate sequences in the presence of MPA. In the absence of MPA one of the duplicated sequences is lost as a result of spontaneous recombination events. In the absence of MPA, two types of potential recombination events, I and II, are possible resulting in the loss of the GPT gene. Recombination event (I) results in retention of the S gene sequence, such recombinant vaccinia viruses have the same sequence as the original input vaccinia virus; (II) results in the loss of most of the S gene sequence, the desired modification. Both types of recombination events have an equal chance of occurring. The various IBV genes are as described in the legend to Fig. 1 Rep represents the end of the IBV replicase gene, \u0394S indicates that the signal sequence and ectodomain are deleted with the transmembrane and C-terminal domain sequences remaining in the partial S gene sequence in the IBV cDNA; 3 and 5 represent the IBV gene 3 and 5 sequences, respectively.",
