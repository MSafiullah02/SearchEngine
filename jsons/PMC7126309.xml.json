            "text": "Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), a contagious and often fatal respiratory illness, was first reported in Guandong province, China, in November 2002.1, 2 Its rapid and unexpected spread to other Asian countries, North America, and Europe alarmed both the public and the World Health Organization (WHO). SARS is caused by the novel coronavirus (CoV), SARS-CoV.3, 4 SARS-CoV is a positive-strand RNA virus whose genome sequence exhibits only moderate homology to other known coronaviruses.5 SARS-CoV encodes a chymotrypsin-like protease (3CLpro), which is also called the main protease (Mpro) because it plays a pivotal role in processing viral polyproteins and controlling replicase complex activity.6 This enzyme is indispensable for viral replication and infection processes, thereby making it an ideal target for the design of antiviral therapies. The 3CL active site contains a catalytic dyad in which a cysteine residue (Cys145) acts as a nucleophile and a histidine residue (His41) acts as the general acid-base.6 To date, SARS-CoV 3CLpro inhibitors have been reported from both synthetic peptidyl compound libraries and natural product derived libraries.7 Inhibitory synthetic compounds include C2-symmetric diols,8 quinolinecarboxylic acids,9 isatins,10 and anilides.11 Natural-derived inhibitors include betulinic acid,12 indigo,13 aloeemodin,13 luteolin,7 and quinine-methide triterpenoids; the latter are products of our latest investigation 3CLpro inhibitor from Tripterygium regelii.14 These natural molecules were found to have IC50 values ranging from 3 to 300 \u03bcM in the enzyme assays.",

T. nucifera, a Taxaceae tree found in snowy areas near the Sea of Jeju Island in Korea that has been used in traditional Asian medicine as a remedy for stomachache, hemorrhoids, and rheumatoid arthritis, was chosen as the starting material by virtue of its observed 3CLpro inhibition (62% at 100 \u03bcg/mL). We isolated 12 phytochemicals\u2014eight diterpenoids and four biflavonoids\u2014with SARS-CoV 3CLpro inhibitory activity from the ethanol extracts of the leaves of T. nucifera. All isolated compounds were examined for their 3CLpro inhibitory activities by enzymatic inhibition assay. Of the isolated compounds, biflavonoid amentoflavone (9) was identified as a potent inhibitor of SARS-CoV 3CLpro, exhibiting an IC50 value of 8.3 \u03bcM. We also report on enzyme-inhibition mechanisms ascertained using kinetic plots and molecular docking experiments.",

As shown in Figure 1\n, more than 15 principal secondary metabolite peaks were detected in the chromatogram by photodiode array (PDA) at 210 nm. As a first step toward relating biological activity to principle metabolites, we assessed the SARS-CoV 3CLpro inhibitory effects of the T. nucifera EtOH extract, along with n-hexane and EtOAc fractions. The results indicate that n-hexane (27% at 50 \u03bcg/mL, Fig. 1B) and EtOAc fractions (53% at 50 \u03bcg/mL, Fig. 1C) have good 3CLpro inhibitory activity. We then used repeated open silica gel column, RP-18 gel, and Sephadex (LH-20) chromatography to isolate bioactive compounds from both fractions for further phytochemical investigation. Their chemical structures were unambiguously assigned on the basis of a comprehensive spectral analysis of mass spectrometry and 1D, 2D NMR data, and a comparison to previously published data.15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23 Compounds isolated from the n-hexane fraction (1\u20138) were identified as the known diterpenoid species 18-hydroxyferruginol (1), hinokiol (2), ferruginol (3), 18-oxoferruginol (4), O-acetyl-18-hydroxyferruginol (5), methyl dehydroabietate (6), isopimaric acid (7), and kayadiol (8). The EtOAc fraction yielded four biflavonids (9\u201312), which were identified as amentoflavone (9), bilobetin (10), ginkgetin (11), and sciadopitysin (12) (Fig. 2\n).",

A comparison of biflavone amentoflavone (9) with biflavone derivatives revealed that methylation of 7-, 4\u2032-, and 4\u2032\u2032\u2032-hydroxyl groups diminished inhibitory activity, whereas a naked biflavone, as in amentoflavone (9), increased inhibitory activity. Thus, compounds 10\u201312, which have methoxy groups, were less potent (IC50\n = 32.0\u201372.3 \u03bcM) than compound 9, which lacks a methoxy group. We also found that the location of the methoxy group within these compounds was positively correlated with the potency of the compounds against SARS-CoV 3CLpro. The terminal methoxy groups in C-4\u2032 and -4\u2032\u2032\u2032 were not required for 3CLpro inhibition, as shown by compounds 10 and 12, which exhibited moderated potency against 3CLpro. However, substitution of a methoxy group at C-7 appeared to enhance the potency of the compound. For example, the C-7 methoxy group of compounds 11 (IC50\n = 32.0 \u03bcM) and 12 (IC50\n = 38.4 \u03bcM) might be responsible for twofold increase in the SARS-CoV 3CLpro inhibitory activity relative to compound 10 (IC50\n = 72.3 \u03bcM). The rank order of potency of these derivatives was compound 9 (8.3 \u03bcM) > compound 11 (32.0 \u03bcM) > compound 12 (38.4 \u03bcM) > compound 10 (72.3 \u03bcM).",

The most potent inhibitor (9) exhibited an IC50 value toward SARS-CoV 3CLpro of 8.3 \u03bcM, making this compound about 30-fold more potent than the parent compound apigenin, which had a threshold value of 40% at 200 \u03bcM in this experiment (Table 2). Moreover, this activity was higher than that of another flavone, luteolin (IC50\n = 20.2 \u03bcM). In the case of flavones, flavones with a C-3\u2032-substituted hydroxyl group, as in luteolin, were more potent inhibitors than apigenin. Thus, these data suggested that substitution of the apigenin motif within the flavone as in biflavonoid (9) may play a pivotal role in SARS-CoV 3CLpro inhibition. This relationship was also supported by quercetin (IC50\n = 23.8 \u03bcM), which has a hydroxyl group at the C-3\u2032 position in the flavones (Fig. 4).",

The enzyme inhibition mechanisms of biflavonoids were modeled using double-reciprocal plots (Lineweaver-Burk and Dixon plots). As shown in Figure 5A, the Dixon plot of [I] versus 1/V (RFU/min\u22121) results in a family of straight lines with the same x-axis intercept, as illustrated for the three fluorogenic substrate concentrations [S], 1/2[S], and 1/4[S], respectively. This indicates that biflavonoids (9\u201312) exhibit noncompetitive inhibition characteristics toward 3CLpro because V\nmax decreased without a change in K\nm value in the presence of increasing concentrations of inhibitors (Fig. 5B). The K\ni values of these biflavonoids were easily calculated from Dixon plot with a common intercept on the x-axis (corresponding to \u2212K\ni).",

The three-dimensional structure of SARS-CoV 3CLpro in complex with a substrate-analogue inhibitor (coded 2z3e)24 obtained from the Protein Data Bank (PDB; http://www.rcsb.org/pdb/) was used for modeling analysis. Computer docking analysis revealed that biflavone 9 nicely fits in the binding pocket of 3CLpro. As shown in Figure 6\n, the C5 hydroxyl group of 9 formed two hydrogen bonds with the nitrogen atom of the imidazole group of His163 (3.154 \u00c5) and OH of Leu141 (2.966 \u00c5) which are belonging to S1 site of 3CLpro. Additionally, the hydroxyl group in the B ring of 9 forms hydrogen bonds with Gln189 (3.033 \u00c5) which is belonging to S2 site of 3CLpro. Our studies of structure\u2013activity relationships implicated interactions with Val186 (4.228 \u00c5) and Gln192 (3.898 \u00c5) as one of the key chemotypes in this inhibitor. Moreover, the potencies of the inhibitors amentoflavone (9) and apigenin correlated well with their binding energies: amentoflavone (9) = \u221211.42 kcal/mol; apigenin = \u22127.79 kcal/mol. These differences in binding energy apparently manifest as a 30-fold smaller IC50 value of amentofalvone (9) toward 3CLpro compared with apigenin. Thus, this docking experiment supports the inferences drawn from the enzymatic assay, revealing an important inhibitory action of biflavones on SARS-CoV 3CLpro.",

The IC50 value of individual compounds was measured in a reaction mixture containing 10 \u03bcg/mL of the 3CLpro (final concentration, 2.5 \u03bcg) and 10 \u03bcM fluorogenic 14-mer peptide substrate in 20 mM Bis-Tris buffer. Reactions were run for 60 min at room temperature with continuous monitoring of fluorescence with a FLx 800 (BioTeck Instrument Inc., USA). The inhibition ratio was calculated using the equation:(1)Activity(%)=[(S-S0)/(C-C0)]\u00d7100where C is the fluorescence of the control (enzyme, buffer, and substrate) after 60 min of incubation, C\n0 is the fluorescence of the control at zero time, S is the fluorescence of the tested samples (enzyme, sample solution, and substrate) after incubation, and S\n0 is the fluorescence of the tested samples at zero time. To allow for the quenching effect of the samples, the sample solution was added to the reaction mixture C, and any reductions in fluorescence were assessed. Kinetic parameters were obtained using various concentrations of FRET peptide in the fluorescent assay. The maximal velocity (V\nmax\n = 44.4 \u00b1 6.2 intensity min\u22121), Michaelis-Menten constant (K\nm\n = 9.7 \u00b1 0.2 \u03bcM), and inhibition constant (K\ni) were calculated from the Lineweaver-Burk and Dixon plots.",

AutoDockTools software was used for the addition of polar hydrogen atoms to the macromolecule to correct calculation of partial atomic charges. Aspartic and glutamic acids were deprotonated, lysine and arginine were protonated, and histidine was neutral. Kollman charges were assigned for all atoms. Three dimensional affinity grid size with 60 \u00d7 60 \u00d7 60 on active size with 0.375 \u00c5 spacing was calculated for each atom type by using of AutoGrid 3. The docking parameters for Lamarckian genetic algorithm between 3CLpro with different biflavones were as follows: population size of 250 individuals, random starting position and conformation, translation step ranges of 2.0 \u00c5, maximum of 10,000,000 energy evaluations, number of top individuals to survive to next generation 1, maximum of generations 27,000, mutation rate of 0.02, rate of crossover 0.8, local search rate 0.06, 50 docking runs. The maximum number of iteration per local search was set to 300. Each docking job produced 50 docked conformations. Binding energy between the three-dimensional structure of SARS-CoV 3CLpro and biflavones was then calculated. The docking results were ranked according to docking energy scores.",
