The best known of these media, developed by Eagle, is an isotonic salt solution with added glucose, vitamins, and amino acids, buffered at pH 7.4, and containing antibiotics to inhibit the growth of bacteria and fungi. Serum must be added to Eagle's medium, and to most others, to supply additional growth factors, without which most cells will not multiply satisfactorily. In recent years several growth factors have been identified, and certain cell lines can now be grown in media that are totally defined chemically. For instance, the Madin\u2013Darby canine kidney cell line has been grown on fibronectin or in polylysine- or collagen-coated dishes, in serum-free medium supplemented with hormones including insulin, binding proteins (e.g., transferrin and albumin), and attachment factors. Such serum-free media are particularly useful for the cultivation of \u201chybridoma\u201d cells used for the production of monoclonal antibodies, where there is a need to ensure that all the immunoglobulin in the medium is antibody of a single specificity, produced by the hybridoma cells. Defined media also present advantages for the isolation of viruses that are likely to be neutralized by antibody present in \u201cnormal\u201d animal serum, but this is generally not a problem if fetal calf serum is employed. Fetal calf serum (5\u201310%) is therefore incorporated in the media used for the initial growth of cells in culture. Once the monolayer is established, the \u201cgrowth medium\u201d is removed, virus is inoculated, and \u201cmaintenance medium\u201d containing little or no serum is added to the culture.",

This restricts their value, whether for routine diagnostic work or vaccine production, because of the high cost and inconvenience of having to obtain fresh tissue each time, as well as lack of consistency from batch to batch. Furthermore, the donor animals often harbor latent viruses which can confuse diagnosis or contaminate vaccines. Nevertheless, the presence of a diverse range of differentiated cell types in such primary cultures means that they tend to be very sensitive to many animal viruses. In veterinary diagnostic virology, it is common practice to inoculate samples suspected to contain virus into primary cultures derived from the same species of animal as that providing the samples.",

For example, it is no longer possible to distinguish microscopically between the epithelial cell lines arising from various cells of ectodermal or endodermal origin, or between the fibroblastic cell lines arising from cells of mesodermal origin.

On adaptation by serial passage, however, mutants with somewhat greater growth potential for a given cell line can be selected.

A series of 10-fold dilutions of a viral suspension is inoculated onto monolayers of cultured cells for an hour or so to allow the virions to adsorb to the cells. The infected cells are then overlaid with medium in an agar or methylcellulose gel, to ensure that the spread of viral progeny is restricted to the immediate vicinity of the originally infected cell. Hence, each infective particle gives rise to a localized focus of infected cells that becomes, after a few days, large enough to see with the naked eye as an area of cytopathology. To render the plaques more readily visible, the cell monolayers are usually stained with neutral red or crystal violet; the living (uninfected) cells take up the stain and the plaques appear as clear areas against a red or purple background (Plate 3-3\n). Some viruses, e.g., herpesviruses and poxviruses, will produce plaques even in cell monolayers maintained in liquid medium, because most of the newly formed virions remain cell-associated and plaques form by direct spread of virus to adjacent cells. Infection with a single virus particle is sufficient to form a plaque; the infectivity titer of the original viral suspension is expressed in terms of plaque-forming units (PFU) per milliliter.",

Being an all-or-none assay, it is not as precise as a quantitative assay. Serial (e.g., 10-fold) dilutions of virus are inoculated into several replicate cell cultures, eggs, or animals. Adequate time is allowed for virus to replicate and spread to destroy the whole cell culture, or kill the embryo or animal, as the case may be. Hence, each host yields only a single piece of information, namely, whether or not it was infected by that particular dilution of virus.",

Statistical procedures must be used to calculate the end point of quantal titrations.

Such virions can, therefore, bridge red blood cells to form a lattice. This phenomenon, known as hemagglutination (HA), was first described in 1941 by Hirst, who then went on to analyze the mechanism of hemagglutination by influenza virus. The hemagglutinin of influenza is a glycoprotein, which projects from the envelope of the virion (see Plate 26-1). The virus will attach to any species of erythrocyte carrying complementary receptors, which are glycoproteins of a different sort. Hemagglutination by influenza virus and the paramyxoviruses is complicated by the fact that the virions also carry an enzyme, neuraminidase, which destroys the glycoprotein receptors on the erythrocyte surface (by removing terminal neuraminic acid) and allows the virus to elute, unless the test is carried out at ambient or lower temperature. About 107 influenza virions are needed to cause agglutination of sufficient erythrocytes to permit the test to be read with the naked eye. Thus, hemagglutination is not a sensitive indicator of the presence of small numbers of virions, but because of its simplicity it provides a very convenient assay if large amounts of virus are available (see Plate 13-3).",

There are three main approaches. The viral suspension can be mixed with a known concentration of polystyrene latex particles (or with a morphologically distinct virus of known particle count), to provide an easily recognizable marker; the ratio of \u201cunknown\u201d virus particles to latex beads enables its concentration to be determined. Alternatively, a known volume of viral suspension is deposited on the grid by ultracentrifugation. Another method is to remove water and salts from a drop of viral suspension hanging from the underside of an ultrathin carbon-coated plastic (\u201cFormvar\u201d) film mounted on a copper grid, by diffusion downwards into agar; thus the number of particles in a known volume may be counted.",

For example, an influenza virus suspension may provide the data set out in Table 3-3. The difference between the electron microscope and hemagglutination titers reflects merely the difference in sensitivity between the two assays. On the other hand, the ratio between the infectivity titer and the particle count, known as the infectivity to particle ratio, requires deeper analysis. In part, it is explained by the fact that most of the virions visible by electron microscopy are noninfectious, having being inactivated by heat (even at 37\u00b0C) or by other mechanisms during extraction and purification, or having been assembled unsatisfactorily in the first place (typically having a defective genome, hence known as \u201cdefective\u201d or \u201cincomplete\u201d virus\u2014see Chapter 5). However, the situation is complicated by another factor, namely, the susceptibility of the cell system in which viral infectivity is assayed; here one speaks of the plating efficiency of the virus. Even a fully infectious virion has only a certain chance of successfully negotiating all the barriers it may encounter in the course of entering and infecting a cell. The susceptibility of one cell system may be much lower (i.e., resistance much higher) than that of another, hence a given viral preparation may have a lower efficiency of plating in one system than in the other; for example, there is a 1.2 log10 difference between egg ID50 and TCID50 in Table 3-5\n.",
