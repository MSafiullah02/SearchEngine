Three bigger pandemics of A/H3N2 subtype were also seen in the 1992/1993, 1994/1995 and 1998/1999 seasons, showing over 8\u00d7105 patients [1], [2], [3].(B)The following results [1], [2], [3] were clarified from viral and serological analyses of influenza pandemics in Japan:(1)By viral and genetic analyses of pandemic subtypes of influenza in Shizuoka Prefecture and all Japan in three recent years (1998\u20132000), A/H3N2 and B subtype strains were isolated as one peak with shoulder in 1998/1999 season, however A/H1N1 and A/H3N2 subtype strains were isolated at the same time as a single peak, namely without viral interference, in 1999/2000 season [1], [2], [3].(2)As herald strains in interpandemic periods, A/H3N2 strain (A/Sydney-like) was found in October 1999, and B strains (B/Victoria- and B/Yamagata-like) were detected in July and November 1998 and in August and December 2000 in different cities of Shizuoka Prefecture. One herald strain of them, B/Shizuoka/1/98 was internationally registered by National Institute of Infectious Disease (NIID, Japan), Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC, USA) and World Health Organization (WHO) as a vaccine-recommended strain [1], [2], [3].(3)A/H3N2 subtype strains which were isolated from patients with influenza-associated encephalopathy were detected in 78% (7/9) of the suspected patients in 1998/1999 season, and 55% (6/11) of those patients in 1999/2000 season in Shizuoka Prefecture, by using MDCK cell culture and RT-PCR methods, and rapid viral diagnostic kits (Directigen Flu A and Influenza OIA) [1], [2], [3].Furthermore, it has been reported by national survey of influenza-associated encephalopathy in January\u2013March, 1998\u20132000 that A/H3N2 and B subtype viruses were also highly detected in 90% (217/238) of the suspected patients in 1998/1999 season, and 77% (109/142) of those patients in 1999/2000 season in all Japan [1], [2], [3].(4)By seroepidemiological analyses of anti-HA antibody titers against influenza subtype strains in 250 persons in Shizuoka Prefecture, high antibody (HI) titers over 40 (meaning protective potency) were shown against A/Sydney/5/97 (H3N2), A/Yokohama/8/98 (H3N2), A/Panama/2007/99 (H3N2) and A/Moscow/10/99 (H1N2) strains, and B/Harbin/09/94 strains (Table 1)\n[1], [2], [3].On the other hand, low antibody (HI) titers under 10 (meaning nonprotective potency) were shown against A/Beijing/262/95 (H1N1), A/New Caledonia/20/99 (H1N1), B/Beijing /243/97, B/Shangdong/7/97 and B/Yamanashi/106/98 strains (Table 1)\n[1], [2], [3].(5)By comparison with the percentage (%) of humoral anti-HA antibody (HI) titers against A/H3N2, A/H1N1 and B subtype strains among nine classes of every 5-year stage, clear generation gaps were observed between children (0\u201319 years), adults (20\u201359 years) and old men (over 60 years), suggesting the infectious scale of the pandemics in the near future (Table 1)\n[1], [2], [3].\n\n",
