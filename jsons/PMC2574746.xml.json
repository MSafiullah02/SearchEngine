            "text": "Members of the paramyxovirus family of negative strand RNA viruses employ a diverse range of mechanisms to circumvent host cell antiviral responses, including limiting cytokine and type I interferon (IFN) synthesis, blocking IFN signaling pathways and inhibiting apoptosis (reviewed in Conzelmann, 2005, Garcia-Sastre, 2001, Goodbourn et al., 2000, Horvath, 2004). Many of these mechanisms for counteracting cellular responses have been attributed to products of the P/V gene which typically encodes both the phosphoprotein P subunit of the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (Kolakofsky et al, 2004) and the V protein which counteracts antiviral responses (Didcock et al., 1999a, Didcock et al., 1999b, Parisien et al., 2001). For some paramyxoviruses, the P/V gene also encodes the family of multifunctional C proteins that are involved in suppressing antiviral responses and in controlling viral gene expression and virion release (Devaux and Cattaneo, 2004, Garcin et al., 2001, Lamb and Parks, 2007). For Simian Virus 5 (SV5), accurate transcription of the P/V gene results in mRNA that codes for the accessory V protein. The P mRNA is identical to the V mRNA except for the addition of two nontemplated G residues that are inserted by the viral polymerase at a precise location in the P/V transcript (Thomas et al., 1988). Thus, the SV5 P and V proteins are identical for the 164 amino-terminal residues (the shared P/V region), but differ in their C-terminal sequences. The P and V proteins have unique C-terminal domains, with the V protein encoding a highly conserved cysteine-rich (cys-rich) zinc-binding domain that is required for many V-associated functions (He et al., 2002, Paterson et al., 1995).",

During infection of a wide range of animal cells, V protein forms a cytoplasmic complex that directs the ubiquitylation and targeting of STAT1 (signal transducer and activator of transcription 1) for degradation (Andrejeva et al., 2002, Ulane et al., 2005). Recently, the SV5 V protein has also been shown to block activation of the IFN-beta promoter (He et al., 2002, Poole et al., 2002), through V protein targeting the IFN-inducible RNA helicase mda-5 (Childs et al., 2007) by binding with the cys-rich region (Andrejeva et al., 2004). Thus, the multifunctional V protein counteracts IFN responses at two steps, resulting in both limited induction of IFN synthesis and a block in IFN signaling.",

This is evident from the naturally-occurring CPI\u2212 variant of SV5 which is defective in targeting STAT1 degradation and in blocking IFN signaling (Chatziandreou et al., 2002). Mutational analyses have identified amino acid differences in the P/V region between WT SV5 and CPI\u2212 that are responsible for defects in targeting STAT1 for degradation (Chatziandreou et al., 2002). We have previously engineered a recombinant rSV5 mutant (P/V-CPI\u2212) to encode these same six CPI\u2212 P/V substitutions in the background of the WT rSV5 genome (Wansley and Parks, 2002). Our analyses have shown that in human cells, these P/V gene substitutions converted WT rSV5 into a mutant that could not induce loss of STAT1 as expected, but the P/V mutant was also found to be a potent inducer of IFN and proinflammatory cytokines (Wansley and Parks, 2002, Young et al., 2006).",

The genetic basis for this new phenotype was shown to be a single point mutation in the shared P/V N-terminal domain at position 100 that changes an asparagine residue to aspartic acid (N100D).

Our panel of SV5 variants represents viruses that are poor inducers (WT rSV5 and P/V-N100D) and potent inducers (P/V-CPI\u2212) of antiviral pathways. Given the role of IFN as an adjuvant (Bracci et al., 2006, Braun et al., 2002, Fink et al., 2006), we hypothesized that SV5 variants that induce higher levels of host cell responses would elicit higher adaptive immune responses, such as anti-SV5 antibodies. However, given the role of IFN as an inhibitor of virus replication (Didcock et al., 1999a, Goodbourn et al., 2000), an alternative hypothesis was that the variants which elicit higher levels of host cell responses would be restricted for growth, which could in turn lead to lower antibody titers (Atmar et al., 2007, Braciale et al., 1976, Mak et al., 1982). Here we have utilized the mouse and ferret animal model systems to test these two hypotheses by determining the magnitude and kinetics of the antibody response to respiratory infection with WT rSV5 and P/V mutants.",

The second pair consisted of the P/V-CPI\u2212 mutant, which is a potent inducer of antiviral responses, and a WT rSV5 encoding GFP as an additional transcription unit between HN and L, which was the proper control virus to account for the GFP gene encoded by P/V-CPI\u2212 (Fig. 1; Wansley and Parks, 2002).

By contrast, cells infected with the P/V-N100D mutant showed luciferase levels that were indistinguishable from those seen with mock-infected cells. These results were supported by ELISA data, in which levels of secreted IFN-beta and IFN-alpha were determined at 24 h pi.

As predicted by these properties, the P/V-N100D virus grew in CL7 cells to titers that were approximately 2 logs higher in multi-step growth assays (Fig. 4A). Unexpectedly however, the P/V-CPI\u2212 virus grew to higher titers than rSV5-GFP (Fig. 4B), despite being a more potent activator of IFN responses. This enhanced growth may be a consequence of higher levels of viral gene expression and genome replication as described previously in human epithelial cell lines (Wansley and Parks, 2002).",

Infected animals showed no clinical signs of illness and pathological lesions in the nasal cavities were mild, consisting of infiltration by mixed type inflammatory cells, superficial epithelial injury and edema (data not shown). At the days pi shown in Fig. 5\n, sera were collected and used in an SV5-specific ELISA to determine the titers of IgG1 and IgG2a. These isotypes were chosen because they are indicative of the CD4+ Th cell response to virus infection (Finkelman et al., 1990), and therefore provide an internal control to our experiment that would ensure we were not missing any portion of the antibody response because of a missing Th1 or Th2 population. There was a dose-dependent increase in the anti-SV5 IgG1 (Fig. 5A) and IgG2a (Fig. 5B) isotype response following i.n. infection of mice with doses between 104 and 106 pfu, and the highest dose of virus yielded final titers that were nearly 100-fold higher than the low dose of virus. A dose of 107 pfu did not significantly increase responses over that seen with 106 pfu. Most importantly however, there was no difference in antibody titers elicited with the WT rSV5 parental virus and P/V-N100D virus. Similarly, there was no difference in the antibody responses elicited by rSV5-GFP compared to the P/V-CPI\u2212 mutant (data not shown).",

Groups of BALB/c mice were infected i.n. with 106 pfu of virus, and viral titers in tissues from the lungs were determined at various times pi. As shown in Fig. 6A, mice infected with rSV5-WT or the P/V-N100D mutant virus showed high titers of virus at early times pi, with a plateau between 3 and 7 days pi. A very similar profile of virus titers was seen in the case of mice infected with the rSV5-GFP and P/V-CPI\u2212 mutant viruses (Fig. 6B). WT rSV5 and P/V mutants grew to higher titers and virus was recovered at later times pi in nasal tissues compared to lung tissues; however, there were no differences in virus growth between animals infected with either virus (Fig. 6C). Together, these data indicate that infection of mice with rSV5 viruses that differ in their ability to induce IFN does not result in differences in levels of virus recovered from the respiratory tract, and there is no dose-dependent difference in anti-SV5 antibody responses elicited in mice by the WT and P/V mutants.",

As an alternative animal model to test our hypotheses, we turned to the ferret system, which has been used as a model for studying a number of respiratory virus infections (Durchfeld et al., 1991, von Messling et al., 2003, Zitzow et al., 2002). In this model system, the P/V-N100D mutant virus becomes irrelevant, since this virus has phenotypes that are specific for the mouse system. Primary cultures of lung fibroblasts were established from na\u00efve ferrets as described in Materials and methods. Staining with anti-cytokeratin antibodies showed these cells were > 95% fibroblasts (data not shown). To determine the growth properties of WT SV5 and P/V-CPI\u2212 in ferret cells, cultures were infected at high moi and examined by western blotting for NP and GFP expression. As shown in Fig. 7A, very low levels of NP and GFP were detected at 12 h pi, but were greatly enhanced by 24 h pi. In multi-step growth analyses, the P/V-CPI\u2212 mutant grew to a final titer that was ~ 1 log lower than rSV5-GFP (Fig. 7B), consistent with our previous results with human tissue culture cell lines (Wansley and Parks, 2002). It is noteworthy that titers of both WT and P/V mutant SV5 in the fibroblast cells shown in Fig. 7B were ~ 2 logs lower than that seen in human epithelial cells (Wansley and Parks, 2002). This is consistent with our findings that SV5 yields in many fibroblast cell lines are typically much lower than that seen in epithelial cells (data not shown).",

By contrast, ferrets that received rSV5-GFP (closed diamonds, Fig. 9A) showed the highest mean anti-SV5 titers with the lowest dose of virus in the primary infection (104). With increasing doses of rSV5-GFP there was a slight decrease in titer that was statistically significant (p\n = 0.001). Most importantly, at the lowest dose of virus (104 pfu), rSV5-GFP elicited a mean antibody titer that was ~ 500 fold higher than that elicited with the P/V-CPI\u2212 virus, and this difference was statistically significant (p\n =0.0002).

Mean antibody titers to rSV5-GFP and the P/V mutant at 106 and 108 pfu were not statistically different.

            "text": "The goal of this study was to utilize the mouse and ferret animal model systems to test the hypothesis that SV5 P/V gene mutants which are more potent activators of cell responses in tissue culture will also be better at eliciting adaptive immune responses. This hypothesis was based on our previous work showing that: 1) the P/V-CPI\u2212 mutant was more effective than WT rSV5 at activating innate responses in cell culture (Wansley and Parks, 2002), and 2) human DC infected with the P/V-CPI\u2212 virus are more effective at activating T cell functions in vitro than DC infected with WT rSV5 (Arimilli et al., 2006). Likewise, it has been proposed that viruses encoding defective antagonists of antiviral responses would be more effective vectors for eliciting adaptive immunity (Talon et al., 2000, Valarcher et al., 2003). Here we show that primary cultures of ferret lung fibroblasts reproduce many of the in vitro human cell culture properties of WT SV5 and P/V-CPI\u2212 described previously, including differences in STAT1 degradation, induction of IFN synthesis and signaling, and CPE. Most importantly for our hypothesis, low dose intranasal infection of ferrets with WT and P/V mutant SV5 elicited different antibody responses, and different levels of virus were recovered from the ferret trachea. By contrast, in the mouse model system WT and P/V mutants showed differences in their ability to counteract IFN responses in tissue culture cells, but intranasal infection of mice with these mutants did not result in differences in either virus growth or antibody responses at any dose tested. Together, these data support the proposal that ferrets represent an excellent animal model system for in vivo analysis of SV5 growth and immune responses.",

In our primary cultures of ferret cells, WT SV5 efficiently targeted ferret STAT1 for degradation, whereas the P/V-CPI\u2212 mutant which is defective for this property in human cells (Wansley and Parks, 2002) is also defective in STAT1 degradation in ferret cells. Furthermore, our results show that the P/V-CPI\u2212 mutant virus induced higher levels of IFN-beta mRNA than WT rSV5, consistent with this mutant virus being defective in limiting IFN induction in ferret cells. The inability to limit IFN induction and signaling pathways likely contributes to the P/V-CPI\u2212 mutant virus having attenuated low moi growth in ferret cells compared to WT SV5, a property also seen during infections of human tissue culture cells (Wansley et al., 2005). These findings raised the hypothesis that differences in the ability of WT SV5 and P/V-CPI\u2212 to limit ferret cell antiviral responses would be reflected in vivo by differences in adaptive responses to infections of the ferret respiratory tract.",

Ferrets are highly susceptible to a number of experimental viral respiratory infections, including influenza virus (Zitzow et al., 2002), canine distemper virus (CDV; Hoover et al., 1989, Svitek and von Messling, 2007), and SARS-associated corona virus (Martina et al., 2003). In the case of CDV, infected ferrets show massive dissemination of virus throughout the body, with excessive morbidity and mortality (von Messling et al., 2003). In our studies, infection of the ferret respiratory tract with WT SV5 or the P/V-CPI\u2212 mutant resulted in no overt indication of illness \u2014 animals remained playful with no changes in either body weight or temperature. Likewise, analyses of respiratory tract tissues did not provide any evidence of virus-induced pathology (data not shown). These results are consistent with previous work examining the pathology of the bone fide CPI virus in ferrets (Baumgartner et al., 1989, Baumgartner et al., 1991), and with a mouse model system in which SV5 was only pathogenic under conditions in which immune responses were severely compromised, such as in STAT1-deficient mice (He et al., 2002, Randall and Young, 1991).",

For both WT and P/V mutant SV5, virus was detected in tissue from the ferret upper trachea, but there was no detectable virus in tissues from the lung or lower trachea as described previously for CPI infections of ferrets (Durchfeld et al., 1991). Importantly, at a low dose of 104 pfu the P/V-CPI\u2212 mutant elicited ~ 500 fold lower anti-SV5 antibody response than that seen with the same dose of WT virus. In addition, the antibody response to P/V-CPI\u2212 infection increased as the dose was increased between 106 and 108 pfu, whereas this was not seen with WT rSV5. Finally, with P/V-CPI\u2212, the anti-SV5 antibody titer was increased by ~ 1 log following a secondary infection, whereas anti-SV5 responses were not altered following a booster infection with WT rSV5. Future work will focus on whether there is also a dose-dependent difference in cellular immune response to these two viruses, but this will require the development of appropriate ferret-specific reagents for cellular immunology.",

One of our original hypotheses was that the P/V-CPI\u2212 virus, which induces DC maturation and is defective in limiting cytokine induction and counteracting IFN, would elicit higher-than-WT levels of antibodies, possibly due to the positive effects of innate cytokines on adaptive immune responses (Bracci et al., 2006, Braun et al., 2002, Fink et al., 2006). As an alternative hypothesis, the induction of innate responses to P/V-CPI\u2212 could limit virus replication, which in turn could limit the antibody responses. Our results are consistent with the second hypothesis, since i.n. infection with the P/V-CPI\u2212 mutant elicited lower antibody titers than that seen with WT rSV5 and lower levels of virus were recovered from the ferret respiratory tract. At higher doses of both viruses, we hypothesize that there is an increase in either the number or type of infected cells. In the case of the P/V mutant, this could overcome limitations in viral replication seen at the lower doses, resulting in higher antibody titers. With WT rSV5, we have shown that higher doses elicited slightly lower anti-SV5 antibodies, possibly due to different cell types being infected. Future work will focus on directly determining the levels of viral antigen and replication following infection with different doses of WT and P/V mutant SV5.",

Our previous cell culture studies have shown that apoptosis is induced in human immature dendritic cells infected with WT rSV5, but not with the P/V-CPI\u2212 mutant (Arimilli et al., 2006, Arimilli et al., 2007). Likewise, DC infected with the P/V-CPI\u2212 mutant are more effective activators of T cell functions than DC infected with WT rSV5 (Arimilli et al., 2006). The role that DC plays in different ferret antibody profiles elicited by WT SV5 and the P/V mutant has not yet been evaluated. Anti-SV5 responses could be the result of DC acquiring antigen by direct infection or by cross-presentation. In the former case, differences in dose-dependent antibody responses to WT and P/V mutant SV5 could be explained by ferret DC being more readily infected in vivo at high rather than at low doses of virus. In the case of the P/V mutant, higher doses could lead to more infected DC and to a higher anti-SV5 response. In the case of WT SV5, higher doses could lead to virus-induced apoptosis of infected DC, and this could contribute to the slight decrease in antibody responses compared to the P/V-CPI\u2212 virus. Further experimentation is required to test this proposed mechanism involving ferret DC.",

Alternatively, levels of anti-HN or -F antibodies elicited by the P/V mutant may be low, but could be superior in their capacity for neutralization compared to higher levels elicited by rSV5-GFP, perhaps due to the adjuvant effect of cytokines elicited by the P/V mutant. Work is in progress to determine the anti-HN and anti-F responses elicited by WT and P/V mutant viruses, and the relative avidity of these antibodies.",

Most importantly for our hypotheses on innate and adaptive immunity, we have analyzed a previously identified SV5 P/V mutant (N100D) with a gain-of-function ability to block IFN signaling in mouse tissue culture cells (Young et al., 2001). We have extended this finding to show that the P/V-N100D virus prevents phosphorylation of STAT1 in response to exogenously-added IFN by an undetermined mechanism, but STAT1 levels do not appear to differ from that of mock-infected cells.",

Unexpectedly however, the P/V-N100D virus was found to be a poor inducer of IFN synthesis. Thus, the change of asparagine residue 100 to aspartic acid in the P and V proteins confers two new phenotypes on WT rSV5: a block in IFN signaling as shown by Young et al. (2001) and lower induction of IFN secretion. More detailed work is needed to uncover the mechanism by which the N100D mutation alters the ability of SV5 to limit IFN production. For the purposes of this study, our cell culture work identified a panel of WT and P/V mutants with decreasing ability to limit murine IFN induction and signaling pathways: N100D > WT rSV5 > P/V-CPI\u2212.",

Following i.n. infection of mice, anti-SV5 antibody responses were similar between WT SV5 and each of our P/V mutants at all doses tested. Likewise, there was no detectable difference in levels of virus recovered from mice infected with any of the SV5 viruses. These data indicate that there are restrictions on virus growth in the murine respiratory tract that are not evident in our cell culture system, and that they are independent of any differences in P/V mutations. It is unlikely that these restrictions are due exclusively to IFN, since the growth of WT SV5 and P/V-CPI\u2212 in mice deficient in the IFN receptor (IFNAR\u2212/\u2212 mice) was very similar and was not significantly enhanced over normal mice (data not shown). In this regard, there may be species specific restrictions in SV5 replication in murine cells, since the yield of SV5 progeny from CL7 mouse tissue culture cells is ~ 100\u20131000 fold lower that that typically seen with human cell lines in vitro.",

In these human STAT2 transgenic (hSTAT2 Tg) mice, WT rSV5 grows to ~ 100 fold higher titer in the respiratory tract compared to normal control mice (Kraus et al., 2008). Why is virus replication enhanced in the case of WT SV5 infection of hSTAT2 Tg mice compared to normal mice, but the N100D mutant, which is a poor inducer of IFN and blocks IFN signaling, grows to titers that are similar to WT rSV5? One possibility is that there may be added benefit to virus replication by degrading STAT1 in the case of WT rSV5-infected hSTAT2 Tg mice versus blocking STAT1 phosphorylation as our data indicate for the P/V-N100D mutant. In this regard, there is evidence that STAT1 may serve as a constitutive transcription factor for basal expression of some cellular genes (reviewed in Horvath, 2000), and virus replication in vivo may be enhanced when this function is eliminated due to STAT1 degradation. A second possibility is that lymphocytes recruited to the site of infection in hSTAT2 Tg mice may differ in their capacity to mount antiviral responses compared to control normal mice. An analysis of the effector functions of lymphocytes in the hSTAT2 Tg mouse and P/V-N100D systems may shed light on this proposal.",

In vivo growth analyses were performed by harvesting the indicated regions of the respiratory tract and using the homogenized tissues in a plaque assay as described above. Ferret antibody responses were analyzed by withdrawing 1\u20133 ml of blood from the jugular vein on day 28 pi. Animals were boosted with an equivalent amount of homologous virus, and blood was collected by cardiac puncture at the termination of the experiment (day 14 post boost). ELISAs were performed using clarified sera as described above except the secondary antibody was an anti-ferret IgG (Bethyl Laboratories). Final antibody titers for ferret experiments were defined as the dilution of serum that yielded an absorbance of two times the absorbance obtained using serum from a na\u00efve animal run in parallel.",
