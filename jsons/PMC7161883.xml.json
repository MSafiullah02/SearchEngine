A significant number of newly developed antibiotics represent minor alterations to well\u2010known chemical scaffolds and are therefore particularly prone to resistance.3 The relentless increase in the number of resistant pathogens has threatened 70 years of medical advancement and led to the suggestion that we are reentering the pre\u2010antibiotic era.4 This is happening at a time when large pharmaceutical companies have ended or down\u2010sized their antibiotic discovery programs because they are too expensive.",

With the increase emergence of mutated strains of microbes, such as the recently discovered coronavirus H7N9, coating of face masks with NPs may be a useful preventive measure for health care workers and civilians. In a study carried out by Li et al., ten treated and untreated masks with a mixture of Ag NPs and TiO2 NPs were tested against E. coli and S. aureus.20 No growth was reported on the treated masks after 48 h incubation while the untreated masks showed an increase in bacterial numbers. Wound dressing is another important area of investigation. Bacterial cellulose fibers do not possess antimicrobial activity. However, upon incorporation of Ag NPs into the fibers, they exhibited a strong antimicrobial response against E. coli and S. aureus.21 NPs have proven to overcome some of the shortcomings of existing antibiotics include having relatively short half\u2010lives, low bioavailability, and possible toxic side effects.22 For example, gentamicin was previously studied in different NP drug delivery system such as poly (lactide\u2010co\u2010glycolide) (PLGA) and chitosan.23, 24 It was observed that NPs carrying gentamicin aided in the drug delivery to specific sites and with sustained release of the drug.25 In addition, the encapsulation of antibiotics within NPs was observed to reduce their toxic side effects relative to conventional administration.26\n",

A linear correlation has been observed between size of the silver NPs and the minimum inhibitory concentration for both Gram\u2010positive and Gram\u2010negative strains.30 Ag NPs have been shown to kill yeast by disrupting its plasma membrane and thus affecting the membrane potential of the cells. Amphotericin B (AmB) was used as a positive control and the plasma membrane DPH fluorescence anisotropy of Candida albicans displayed a significant decrease as the concentrations of Ag NPs and AmB increased.31, 32 This result was consistent with the disruption of the plasma membrane by Ag NPs and AmB. In the same study, Ag NPs exhibited a minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) of 2 \u00b5g mL\u22121, which is similar to that exhibited by AmB (2.5\u20135 \u00b5g mL\u22121).32 Moreover, nano\u2010Ag caused less hemolysis of erythrocytes (6% lysis) compared to AmB (10% lysis) at the same concentration.32 Ag NPs display average MIC values of 4.86 \u00b5g mL\u22121 compared to 500 \u00b5g mL\u22121 for ZnO NPs and 197 \u00b5g mL\u22121 for Au NPs against Streptococcus mutans.33\n",

The mixture is then added to an aqueous solution. As the organic solvent evaporates, the polymers and drugs undergo nanoprecipitation via rapid solvent diffusion, to produce NPs.110 Alternatively, polymeric NPs can be prepared from linear polymers via an emulsion polymerization method. Monomers are first dissolved in polymerization media with surfactants, followed by the addition of polymerization initiators, resulting in the formation of nanocapsules. Antimicrobials are either absorbed into the NPs during this process or they can be covalently attached to the surface of the NPs after they are formed. Hydrophobic drugs are typically loaded via absorption while hydrophilic drugs are attached via covalent conjugation.111\nTable\n\n5\n summarizes the reported methods for preparing polymeric NPs. Different preparation methods and different compositions of liposomes contribute to their efficacy as antimicrobial carriers. Electrospray can produce a broad array of NPs. This technique generates monodisperse droplets in sizes ranging from nanometers to micrometers (depending on the processing parameters).
