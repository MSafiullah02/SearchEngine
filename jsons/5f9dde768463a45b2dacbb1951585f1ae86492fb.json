            "text": "The possible role of video gaming in imprinting aggressive and specifically gun-related behaviors has been elusive, and findings regarding these associations have been inconsistent. I address this gap by proposing and testing a bipartite theory that can explain inconsistent results regarding the previously assumed linear association between videogames and gun-related behaviors. The theory suggests that this association follows a U-shape. It posits that at low levels of video gaming time, video gaming displaces gun-related behaviors and shelters adolescents by keeping them occupied and by reducing opportunities and motivation to acquire guns. However, at some level of gaming time (because most popular games adolescents play include violent aspects), the assumed imprinting of aggressive behaviors overpowers the positive displacement force, and this can trivialize and naturalize gun-carrying behaviors, and ultimately increase motivation to obtain and carry guns. I tested this theory with two national samples of American adolescents (n1 \u00bc 24,779 and n2 \u00bc 26,543, out of which 403 and 378, respectively, reported bringing a gun to school in the last month). Multiple analyses supported the proposed U-shaped association. These findings show that the moral panic over video games is largely unsubstantiated, especially among light to moderate gamers.",

Playing videogames can have positive effects on adolescents, including improved motor skills, selective visual attention, and cognitive abilities ( ; ; serious games can also be used for learning, skill development, and fun (Padilla, Ochoa, & Margain, 2016) , and help children with mental disorders to develop desired skills (Mansilla et al., 2017) . Nevertheless, there is some but inconclusive evidence that leisure video games, many of which are plagued with violence (Greitemeyer, 2018) , can be weakly but significantly associated with aggressive behaviors (Bushman & Anderson, 2002; DeWall, Anderson, & Bushman, 2011; Elson & Ferguson, 2014) . While such studies have focused on various forms of aggression, little is known about how the use of video games might be associated with gun-related behaviors in adolescents. Examining this association is important, given recent school shooting incidents in the US, and the ability of scientific findings to guide policy development, and prevention efforts (Clements, 2012) . Findings on this association can also inform research because research on this topic has been inconclusive (see discussion in Supplementary Materials A). This body of rsearch has also primarily focused on negative effects of video games, neglecting their potential positive effects (American Psychological Association, 2015) . Here, I aim at providing and supporting a more balanced than before perspective on this association.",

I seek to extend the understanding of this association and inform the debate about it, by focusing not only on the possible negative role of video games in this association but also potential positive effects of video gaming in this context. I specifically focus on carrying a gun to school as the variable of interest for three reasons. First, it is a preliminary and necessary condition for gun violence at schools. Second, it is likely easier to intervene with this behavior than with the actual use of the firearm at school.",

First, I focused on adolescents given their tendency to engage in risky behaviors, including gun-related behaviors (Klein et al., 1993) ; this behooves researchers and policymakers to find ways to reduce them. Second, as mentioned above, gun culture and accessibility in the US make gun-carrying to school easier to implement compared to in other countries (Ybarra, Huesmann, Korchmaros, & Reisner, 2014) .

            "text": "I first note that the association between videogames and aggression is typically explained via the general aggression model (Bushman & Anderson, 2002; DeWall et al., 2011) . This model suggests that aggressive behaviors are triggered in social encounters based on repeated person-environment interactions that create knowledge structures (or scripts), which include aggression as a desirable, normal, and acceptable response to threats in the environment. When such scripts are established, people can develop hostile attribution bias, which leads them to assess ambiguous social situations as much more threatening than they really are, and respond to them with aggression (Crick & Dodge, 1996) . Thus, when aggression scripts are imprinted in individuals, individuals tend to accentuate threats in the environment and act accordingly (Dill, Anderson, Anderson, & Deuser, 1997) . Applied here, it means that repeated exposure to guns, gun use, and violence, can normalize such objects and behaviors in adolescents' minds and make them seem like natural and even necessary. At the heart of this association is the assumption that most videogames include violent features, which are the basis for imprinting violent behaviors. I test this assertion in a preliminary study of 99 11th grade US high school students (66 male, 33 female) who play videogames. Results (see Supplemental Materials B) show that even though games vary by audience rating, most popular games contain blood, violence, shooting, and weapons. Thus, they have the potential to imprint violent behaviors, including gun-related behaviors.",

            "text": "Nevertheless, the \"imprinting through repeated exposure\" hypothesis is likely relevant only at high levels of repeated exposure. While a single exposure is sufficient for creating short term effects on immediate aggressive cognitions and behaviors (Bushman & Anderson, 2002) , it takes frequent and prolonged repetition to create significant relatively stable changes in a person's aggressive personality, as manifested in more aggressive behavioral schemata . This is consistent with key ideas of attitude and behavior change models (Ajzen, 2001; Fishbein & Ajzen, 2011) , according to which changes require prolonged and persistence exposure to change instigators. When video gaming time is low, possible aggressive cues in games may not suffice for creating significant changes in aggression (gun-related in our case) schemata (Lemmens, Valkenburg, & Peter, 2011) . Thus, I hypothesize that (H1) only when video gaming time is sufficiently high (to be empirically defined later), there is a positive association between video gaming time and bringing guns to school. To supplement this perspective, I build on the displacement hypothesis. It suggests that when there are physical, spatial, or temporal constraints that do not afford simultaneous execution of activities, one activity may be displaced by another, more appealing, or advantageous activity (Gabor, 1981) . For example, when gun availability is low, other means of suicide displace them (Carrington & Moyer, 1994) . In the case of video gaming, research often built on the displacement hypothesis to suggest that time spent on video gaming displaces and detracts from other important activities (Gentile, 2011) , such as school work (Sharif & Sargent, 2006) and physical activity (Biddle, Gorely, Marshall, Murdey, & Cameron, 2004 ) (dubbed here negative displacement). Nevertheless, video gaming can also serve as a positive displacement by keeping adolescents occupied. This activity prevents them from having the motivation and/or opportunity to hang out on the streets and indirectly, have a need, motivation to acquire or carry, and access to guns. There is some evidence for such positive displacement with regards to illicit substances; \"light\" gamers use illicit substances less frequently compared to non-gamers and compared to \"heavy\" gamers (Turel & Bechara, 2019) .",

This positive displacement means that video games can serve as a healthy substitute to unsupervised after-school time (that can give rise to motivation and opportunity to access guns), without much influence of imprinting forces. Videogames, at this level, can displace gun behaviors indirectly. Specifically, they can alleviate precondition factors for gun carrying to school (e.g., hanging out with people who sell and/or play with guns, hanging out and feeling threatened on the streets, socializing with the wrong people after school). This level of video gaming can also represent \"voluntary incapacitation,\" a term describing how people selectively choose an activity that prevents them from engaging in problematic behaviors (Dahl & DellaVigna, 2009 ). Integrating these views, I hypothesize that (H2) as people transition from not playing video games to low video gaming time, there is a negative association between video gaming time and bringing guns to school. H1 and H2 describe competing forces; while H1 focuses on high levels of video gaming and the imprinting force, H2 focuses on low levels of video gaming and the displacement force. The dominance of these competing forces should, therefore, inflect at some point along the video gaming time continuum. The integration of these forces suggests that video gaming contributes to declining gun-carrying behaviors (consistent with the positive displacement hypothesis) until an inflection point, where the imprinting hypothesis overshadows the displacement effect, and the association between video gaming and bringing guns to school becomes positive. I hence expect that (H3) the association between video gaming time and bringing guns to school is U-shaped, such that it is negative at low levels of video gaming time and positive at high levels of video gaming time.",

Responses ranged from 1 \u00bc none to 9 \u00bc \ufffd40 h. To avoid relying on the artificial equal distances between scale points, they were converted into estimated hours per day. Range values (e.g., 6-9 h) were re-coded as the middle point (i.e., 7.5 h in the example), and the result was divided by seven to convert from weekly to daily time (Bradbury, Turel, & Morrison, 2019) . Squared values were calculated to model the hypothesized quadratic association. The dependent variable (frequency of bringing a gun to school) was captured in a different part of the survey by asking adolescents to report the number of days during the last four weeks on which they brought a gun to school. Responses ranged from 1 \u00bc none to 6 \u00bc \ufffd10 days. For proper scaling, similar conversions to those applied to the independent variable were employed here. For example, the value \"3-5 days\" was recoded as 4 days. For a supplementary analysis focusing on video gaming association with the odds of bringing guns to schools, a dummy variable was created (Turel, 2020) , such that 0 represented not bringing a gun to school over the last 4 weeks and 1 described bringing a gun to school in the previous 4 weeks, at least once.",

Year of administration was included to account for trends in gun violence prevalence in the US (Frazer et al., 2018) . Sex was included because the sexes differ in both video gaming patterns and choices (Lucas & Sherry, 2004 ) and weapon-related behaviors (DuRant, Krowchuk, Kreiter, Sinal, & Woods, 1999) . Grade was included as a proxy for age, because assaults with weapons and injuries from such assaults increase from the age of 2 to the age of 17 (Finkelhor, Turner, Ormrod, & Hamby, 2009 ). The family environment and socioeconomic status were indirectly captured with parent education (Johnson, Cohen, Smailes; Kasen, & Brook, 2002) .

All models were estimated with bootstrapping with 1000 re-samples for generating bias-corrected 95% confidence intervals for estimates. This was done to avoid distributional assumptions, for better assessing estimate robustness (Mooney & Duval, 1993) , and for allowing the comparison of regression coefficients. I performed three analyses. First, a preliminary examination of the hypothesized U-shaped association was performed by plotting the 95% confidence intervals for the frequency of bringing guns to school at different levels of daily video gaming time. Non-overlapping confidence intervals or distances from upper/lower bound to the estimate point that have <50% overlap were deemed indicative of significant differences at least at the p < 0.05 level (Cumming, 2009 ). Second, I tested the hypotheses directly with hierarchical regression models (Turel & Gil-Or, 2019) , where the first block included control variables, the second added video gaming time, and the third added squared video gaming time. This approach allows testing nonlinear associations after accounting for control variables, and for examining the added contribution of predictors. Last, I supplemented the testing of the hypotheses and expanded the regression model interpretation with a logistic regression model that focused on the associations between the predictors and the odds of bringing a gun to school. The dependent variable in this case was binary (brought a gun to school or not), which required the use of logistic regression.",

For both datasets, it indicates a statistically significant decline in this behavior from the group that does not play video games to those who play video games for as little as 0.07 h per day. The displacement and imprinting forces appear to relatively balance each other between 0.07 h of video gaming per day and 4.93 h per day, and the imprinting of aggressive behaviors seems to overpower the displacement force only after about 5 h of video gaming per day. Results therefore, provide preliminary support for the bipartite theory and the hypothesized U-shaped association. Table 2 outlines the results of the hieratical regression and logistic regression models for the first dataset; Table 3 does so for the second dataset. The hieratical regression results, consistently across datasets, support the hypothesized U-shaped association between video gaming time and bringing a gun to school. They show that this association is small but significant, even after controlling for several essential confounds. The coefficients indicate that video gaming initially decreases the frequency of bringing a gun to school (consistent with the \"positive displacement\" hypothesis) and that the frequency of bringing a gun to school does not increase until the vertex of the parabola is reached.

Older adolescents had increased frequency of bringing a gun to school in 2012-2014 data, but this trend, while existed, was not significant in the 2015-2017 data. Lastly, the father's education level contributed to a reduction in gun carrying behaviors only in the 2015-2017 data.",

The findings also indicate higher prevalence rates of bringing guns to schools (about 1.5%) compared to findings in (Ybarra et al., 2014, p . 33% of 1.4% \u00bc 0.46%).

After accounting for control variables, each hour of video gaming increased the frequency of bringing a gun to school by 1.3%. However, this effect disappeared in the 2014-2017 data. In contrast, the U-shaped association was consistent across datasets.

The literature on negative effects of video games on adolescents typically used the displacement hypothesis for suggesting that video gaming time detracts from the time devoted to other life domains (Gentile, Lynch, Linder, & Walsh, 2004) , or used experiments to demonstrate that playing violent video games can impair anger recognition, increase self-perceived fighting ability and reduce perceptions regarding the toughness of opponents (Denson et al., 2019) . The literature has also been more heavily slanted toward the adverse effects of video games (Ferguson, 2015) . We show here that indeed video game use can be associated with undesirable adolescent behaviors, which is consistent with prior research (Anderson et al., 2008 .

Heavy use (presumably especially of violent games), however, may be considered a risk factor for gun-related behaviors (but not necessarily a strong predictor of such behaviors), especially for males. When such conditions exist, parents, teachers, and health professionals may want to monitor the situation more closely. Moreover, the findings suggest that legislators and governments should not necessarily try to restrict video gaming time or adolescent access to even violent video games (see one attempt described in Clements, 2012) because (1) general video gaming associations with gun-related behaviors are small, and (2) at low levels of general gaming time such activities can be useful and shelter adolescents from other, undesirable behaviors (Turel & Bechara, 2019) . Similarly, the findings suggest that video game developers should be more mindful regarding possible adverse effects of gaming, but only after a certain threshold. Hence, suggestions made in prior research to include warning or game-lock mechanisms (Xu, Turel, & Yuan, 2012) can be efficacious and should take into account the transition point between the dominance of the displacement and imprinting forces. These implications, though, merit much more research given the observed small associations, the focus on general gaming time and not on violent games only, and the preliminary and correlational nature of our findings.",

            "text": "Ultimately, even though this study relied on two large datasets, findings of this study should be treated as preliminary, because our data were cross-sectional, restricted in scope (I was constrained by available national survey items, such as general gaming time) and self-reported, and focused on one specific problematic behavior. While the replication of the model in two datasets increase confidence in the bipartite theory, future longitudinal designs, with foci on a broader set of aggressive and/or problematic behaviors, separating violent and nonviolent games, and using objective data (e.g., video gaming logs), can be used for enriching and extending our findings and their generalizability. It would also be interesting to consider the effect of platforms in which shooting is more naturally simulated (e.g., Kinect) on gunrelated behaviors in future research. In addition, I focused only on US adolescents (13-16 years old). Generalizability to other countries with different gun cultures and accessibility, as well as with varying responses to videogames and video gaming narratives (Ochoa et al., 2006; Welsh, 2016) should be established with data from additional countries. Moreover, the proposed model explained a small proportion of the variance in the target behavior. While this is understandable given the sparse and complex nature of the outcome variable (Glenn & Shelton, 1983; O'grady, 1982) , and does not detract from the importance of studying such significant but small associations (Abelson, 1985) , future research can include a broader range of predictors of gun-related behaviors. In addition, our study was constrained by available data to focus on all games and consequently did not account for the specific games and/or types of games adolescents play. Although I show that the most popular games among adolescents include many violent features, it would be interesting to consider if our model improves when the focus is only on violent games and/or level of violence in games is directly included in the model. The model can also be extended to focus on competition within games, frustration, and not just violence, as competition and frustration are more potent drivers of aggressive affect than violence itself (Dowsett & Jackson, 2019) . This also means that the recommendations regarding desirable and risky gaming time should be taken with caution, and be fine-tuned to account for the type of games adolescents play an special cirumstances (like COVID-19).",

This study presents a more balanced view through a theory that accounts for both positive and negative associations between videogames and problematic adolescent behaviors. The findings provide initial support to the idea that low levels of general video gaming can be protective. In contrast, higher levels of general video gaming time can be a small risk factor for gun-related behaviors. These findings show that the moral panic over video games in general, many of which include aggressive elements, is largely unsubstantiated, but also that there may be some kernel of truth in attributing some (small) blame to video games, but only at very high levels of use. I call for further testing our theory and for adjusting public statements portraying video games as primarily negative.",
