            "text": "Brain death is legally accepted as the criterion of death in many countries worldwide.1 Despite this wide consensus there are still many pockets of resistance in philosophy and in the medical community, and one might even argue, that there are even more dissenters now than there were about 20 or 30 years ago, when brain death started its way towards its legal recognition. Many philosophers have expressed the view that the concept of brain death is philosophically indefensible and therefore should be abandoned (Veatch 1993; Singer 1995; Truog 1997; Degrazia 2005). Peter Singer, for example, has pointed out that brain death is a conventional fiction and that although currently there is consensus about the concept, for various reasons it is unstable (1995, pp. 35\u201337).2 Seema Shah, Robert Truog and Franklin Miller have argued that death determination based on whole brain death is an \u201cunacknowledged legal fiction that is used without full recognition of its falsity\u201d (Shah et al. 2011, p. 721).3 This, however, raises difficult questions about the possibility of effective organ procurement and transplantation policy as the current practices in this area in many countries rely on the acceptance of the brain death criterion of death.",

McMahan 2002; Glannon 2007) argue that instead of the whole brain death criterion we should accept the so-called higher brain criterion of death, i.e. assume that death should be determined as soon as irreversible loss of consciousness is diagnosed. Others argue for a slightly more complex solution. For example, Robert Truog (1997) suggests that we should return to the good old cardiorespiratory criterion of death and uncouple the link between organ transplantation and death.4 This means abandoning the so-called Dead Donor Rule\u2014the principle that vital organs can be procured only from donors who are dead. The purpose of this move is to keep the current practice of organ procurement for transplantation, which we would have to change if we would simply go back to the cardiopulmonary concept of death without challenging the Dead Donor Rule.5",

            "text": "Furthermore, there are authors who argue that there is no reasonable hope to arrive at a consensus on the issue of death determination, because people have rather different intuitions about the matter and all philosophical conceptions advanced so far have problems of their own. Those authors defend the view, that determination of death is not a matter that can be decided by some medical facts about human organisms, but rather that it is a metaphysical and ethical choice, a decision that usually depends on the extent to which particular medical facts matter to people. Therefore, the only workable solution is to embrace pluralism about the criteria of death and to admit that people themselves should be allowed to choose the criteria that are used to determine their deaths. Views along these lines have been proposed by several authors (e. g. Lachs 1988; Sass 1992; Emanuel 1995; Bagheri 2007; Zeiler 2009), but to our knowledge the most elaborate account of this kind belongs to Robert Veatch (1989, 1999, 2019), Veatch and Ross (2016). According to Veatch, we have to tolerate different views that people have about death and to allow different groups to act on their opinions. Veatch proposes that people\u2014while still competent\u2014should be free within reason to choose the criteria under which they should be considered dead. As there are indefinite number of theoretically possible conceptions of death, there should be\u2014for practical reasons\u2014some limited set of choice alternatives. Veatch suggests that people should be offered to choose from the three plausible accounts that are discussed in bioethics literature, i.e., cardiopulmonary, whole-brain and higher brain. Furthermore, since for different reasons not everyone will make an explicit choice among the offered criteria of death, there must be a default position on death, so that it is clear for doctors and others how to proceed in such cases. Veatch proposes that the best candidate for that role is the currently widely accepted whole-brain conception. In cases where patients have not made their view on death clear while competent, the decision within certain limits should be made by the next of kin as it is done in other similar situations already.",

A recent literature review indicates that \u201cthe existing data on public attitudes regarding brain death and organ transplantation reflect substantial public confusion\u201d about medical and legal facts (Shah et al. 2015, p. 291). There are some important tendencies noted in the empirical literature, however. For example, research conducted in Japan and China (see Yang and Miller 2015, p. 216 for a brief overview) indicates a quite strongly pronounced support for a cardiopulmonary understanding of death. However, as far as we know, there are no studies in which participants had a possibility to explicitly indicate their own preferences concerning death determination criteria by choosing from a wide set of options. Another tendency of note is rather consistent public support for the Dead Donor Rule (see Dubois and Anderson 2006 for a review; but see Nair-Collins et al. 2014).",

Stage 3 was designed to reflect the higher brain criterion of death, Stage 4\u2014whole brain death criterion, Stage 5\u2014cardiopulmonary criterion. This 6-stage description was always available for participants at the bottom of each page with measure.The patient had fever and headaches for 3 days. The patient cannot tolerate bright light and noises. The patient is nauseous, and when he moves too fast he has vertigo. The doctor stuck a needle into the patient\u2019s back to get some of the fluid in his brain and the results came back indicating inflammation. The doctor diagnosed meningitis.The patient has been in the hospital for 3 days. First, in Neurology unit, but after a day he was transferred to the Intensive care unit. Patient\u2019s memories of the recent past are fragmented, he has intense hallucinations. Medication is used to calm him down. In the ICU he is asleep most of the time. When he opens his eyes he cannot recognize the relatives. Sometimes when awake he mumbles random words or screams.The patient\u2019s state deteriorated rapidly. His brain herniated. Due to that the cerebral cortex of the brain stopped functioning. The patient is still breathing on his own and his heart beats, but he cannot feel anything or make himself move. The consciousness is irrevocably lost. The patient does not react to any attempts to talk to him. However, the patient responds to some stimuli: when the neurologist poured some ice-cold water into the patient\u2019s ears and looked for his eyes to move, they did move. The patient is in this state for 2 weeks.The patient\u2019s brain stopped functioning. The patient is intubated and breathing is done by mechanical lung ventilator. If removed from it, the patient would not be able to breathe. The heart is beating, but medication is needed to sustain it. The patient does not move and does not feel anything. The patient no longer reacts to painful stimuli but some very basic reflexes remain: when the neurologist hits the knee with a little rubber hammer, the leg moves. The patient is in this state for 2 weeks.The patient\u2019s heart stopped and the patient was disconnected from the ventilator. The patient is not breathing, the body temperature starts to drop below 36 \u00b0C. The skin is becoming cold and grey. The patient is not responsive to any stimuli whatsoever.After a day, the body is cold and stiff. The temperature is the same as the room temperature. The blood in blood vessels has pooled in the lower parts of the body due to gravity. The abdomen is distended because guts are starting to decay due to bacteria in there.",

If we agree\u2014along with Veatch\u2014that the distribution of the preferences is a good guide to which options should be in the choice-set while formulating a policy, then this result provides initial support for the idea of widening the set of criteria available for choice: not only whole brain death and cardiopulmonary death but also higher brain death should be in the choice-set.7 This is especially suggestive looking at preferences for the self where 40% of participants in our study opted for criteria that are less restrictive than the current legal standard (22% opted for more restrictive criteria).",

Our data do not allow one to evaluate the precise distribution of preferences, but it is suggestive about general trends. Further research would be needed to provide more precise estimations. Another limitation is that only one description of the process of dying was used. Moreover, concerns can be raised that the process of death rarely if ever unfolds in the exact sequence of stages as in our description.8 Under realistic conditions we should not expect the process of dying to be structured in such a step-by-step manner. We acknowledge this as an important limitation of our study but we would still like to defend this methodological move. While clearly an idealized abstraction, this experimental set-up was decided a priori since our main interest was to find a way to measure differences in how \u2018permissive\u2019 or \u2018restrictive\u2019 criteria of death determination and an acceptable time for organ procurement that study participants are willing to apply. While we sacrifice some realism in choosing to operate with sequential description of the process of dying and, in consequence, an ordinal scale, we also gain quite a bit in simplicity and intuitiveness of exposition. Treating the scale as categorical would remove these benefits. One more limitation is that in order to make the study more intelligible to the participants we introduced some explanations that referred to current practices which may have had some anchoring effects. Data reported in this paper accord very closely with the data from a much smaller (N = 160) preliminary study we conducted with Lithuanian participants (Dranseika and Neiders 2018).",

Moreover, our data also shows that the three conceptions of death that are suggested by Veatch as candidates for people to choose from are not entirely arbitrary\u2014each had considerable number of supporters in our sample. In addition, since the whole brain criterion was the most frequently chosen answer, this would provide some preliminary evidence that\u2014if default option is needed at all\u2014this criterion would be most practicable as the default option. Also, as participants in most cases indicate that, provided that they have consented to donate their organs, the organs should be procured after their death is diagnosed, our data provide some support for the Dead Donor Rule, i.e., the data suggest that the rule fits well with the preferences observed in our sample. Last but not least, our study provides some evidence that people have a tendency to prefer an earlier stage for determination of death for themselves than for their relatives. This result underscores the importance of advance directives in establishing preferences concerning death determination criteria as the criterion preferred by a person might differ from the one that his or her relatives might choose, if that decision should be made when the person doesn\u2019t have decision making capacity.",
