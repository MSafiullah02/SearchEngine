The disease has not recurred to a significant extent since 2003, but coronaviruses similar to the one that caused the epidemic continue to circulate in wild animals, especially in bat populations (Woo et al., 2006). The SARS epidemic sparked efforts to develop vaccines that would be used if future outbreaks of SARS occurred. Both inactivated and live, attenuated vaccines have been described but thus far all are in early stages of development. From these initial studies, several salient observations emerged. First, transfer of neutralizing antibody, directed against the surface (S) glycoprotein, prior to infection completely protected experimentally infected animals from clinical disease (Greenough et al., 2005, Rockx et al., 2008, Subbarao et al., 2004, Zhu et al., 2007). Second, SARS-CoV vaccines were more effective in young than aged animal populations in terms of protection from clinical disease and the development of a neutralizing antibody response (Deming et al., 2006). Third, the precise viral proteins that were included in a particular vaccine was an important consideration because vaccines that included the nucleocapsid (N) protein resulted in an immunopathological pulmonary disease characterized by eosinophilic infiltration in SARS-CoV-challenged mice (Deming et al., 2006, Yasui et al., 2008).",

Live, attenuated coronavirus vaccines have been developed against coronavirus pathogens such as infectious bronchitis virus and transmissible gastroenteritis virus (Saif, 2004). An additional issue that must be considered in developing a SARS-CoV vaccine is that the virus most likely originated from a SARS-like CoV that infected bats (Lau et al., 2005, Li et al., 2005). This virus then jumped species to infect intermediate hosts such as Himalayan palm civets in wet markets in Southern China prior to infecting humans (Chinese, 2004). Therefore, an ideal vaccine will also have efficacy against zoonotic strains of SARS-CoV, thereby minimizing the likelihood that virus will have sufficient time to adapt to human populations.",

The virion envelope contains at least three structural proteins, S, E and M, embedded in the membrane. Also like other coronaviruses, SARS-CoV encodes several group-specific proteins, termed 3a, 3b, 6, 7a, 7b, 8 and 9b (Snijder et al., 2003). These proteins are not essential for replication in tissue culture cells and their deletion does not significantly attenuate virus growth in mice (DeDiego et al., 2008, Yount et al., 2005). By contrast, deletion of the small envelope (E) protein modestly reduces SARS-CoV growth in vitro and in vivo (DeDiego et al., 2007, DeDiego et al., 2008), resulting in an attenuated virus. In other coronaviruses, deletion of E results in either complete absence of infectious virus or a severe reduction in titer (Kuo and Masters, 2003, Ortego et al., 2007). However, E deletion in the context of SARS-CoV results in only a 20-fold decrease in virus titer in tissue culture cells (DeDiego et al., 2007).",

Mice that are transgenic (Tg) for the expression of the human SARS-CoV receptor, angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (hACE2) have been obtained (McCray et al., 2006, Tseng et al., 2006). These mice develop moderate respiratory disease but overwhelming neurological disease with 100% mortality after intranasal infection with SARS-CoV. As such, they are very useful to assess vaccine safety and efficacy. We previously showed that infection of these highly susceptible mice with recombinant SARS-CoV deleted in E (rSARS-CoV-\u0394E) or E and several group-specific proteins genes (6, 7a, 7b, 8a, 8b and 9b; rSARS-CoV-[\u0394E,6-9b]) resulted in no weight loss or death, even after inoculation with 12,000 plaque forming units (PFU). In contrast, 100% of mice infected with 800 PFU of either rSARS-CoV or rSARS-CoV deleted in group-specific genes 6, 7a, 7b, 8a, 8b and 9b (rSARS-CoV-[\u03946-9b]) succumbed to the infection (DeDiego et al., 2008). While these results suggest that rSARS-CoV-\u0394E and rSARS-CoV-\u0394[E,6-9b] have the potential to be safe vaccines, their stability, efficacy and immunogenicity were not examined in this initial study.",

In specific, the MA15 strain was isolated after 15 passages through the lungs of BALB/c mice and unlike the parental Urbani strain of virus, intranasal inoculation with this virus results in signs of respiratory disease with substantial mortality (Roberts et al., 2007). Here, we use this infection system to assess the protective ability of rSARS-CoV-\u0394E and rSARS-CoV-\u0394[E,6-9b] in the context of respiratory disease.

We used a challenge dosage of 1 \u00d7 105 PFU, which caused > 70% mortality and substantial weight loss (Figs. 1\nC and D, triangles) in the experiments described below. We next showed that infection with 12,000 PFU of rSARS-CoV-\u0394E or rSARS-CoV-\u0394[E,6-9b] caused no weight loss or mortality in BALB/c mice (Figs. 1A and B). This was expected because the same dosage of virus caused no disease in hACE2 Tg mice, which are extremely susceptible to infection with the Urbani strain of SARS-CoV. To assess the protective ability of these viruses against infection with MA15 virus, 6- to 8-week-old BALB/c mice were immunized with 12,000 PFU rSARS-CoV-\u0394E or rSARS-CoV-\u0394[E,6-9b] and challenged 21 days later with 1 \u00d7 105 PFU MA15 virus (Figs. 1C and D). Following challenge, mice immunized with the deletion mutants exhibited weight loss on days 1\u20133 p.i., but 10/10 of rSARS-CoV-\u0394E and 9/10 of rSARS-CoV-\u0394[E,6-9b]-immunized mice recovered and survived. In contrast, na\u00efve mice challenged with the same dose of MA15 virus lost significantly more weight and most mice succumbed to infection at days 4\u20138 p.i.",

Immunization with rSARS-CoV-\u0394E resulted in 8% and 91% reductions in virus titers in the lungs at days 3 and 5 p.i., respectively (Fig. 2A). MA15 virus caused pathological changes consistent with pneumonia, including alveolar edema, alveolar sloughing, necrotizing bronchiolitis and interstitial and perivascular inflammatory cell infiltration (Roberts et al., 2007; Figs. 2D and E). Vaccination with rSARS-CoV-\u0394E resulted in a substantial diminution in the extent of pathological changes in challenged mice, with little evidence of lung destruction or inflammatory cell infiltration present (Figs. 2B and C). These results showed that a single dose of rSARS-CoV-\u0394E was able to protect mice from clinical disease, prevent lung damage and decrease virus replication.",

Severe disease occurred when virus gained entry into the brain via the olfactory nerve. An effective immune response would likely need to prevent the entry of nearly all virus into brain, since once in the brain, virus spread is rapid and widespread (Netland et al., 2008). Next, we examined the protection mediated by immunization with rSARS-CoV-\u0394E or rSARS-CoV-\u0394[E,6-9b] after challenge with 12,000 PFU of the Urbani strain. A single immunization with either rSARS-CoV-\u0394E or rSARS-CoV-\u0394[E,6-9b] protected approximately 30% of mice from death after challenge with 12,000 PFU of the Urbani strain of SARS-CoV (Fig. 3\n). To assess whether virus titers in the brain correlated with protection, we analyzed four additional animals, one of which was asymptomatic. Virus was detected in the brains of the 3 symptomatic mice (average geometric titer 7.56 \u00b1 0.26) but not in the brain of the fourth mice. In the same experiment, average geometric titers were 8.13 \u00b1 0.14 in the brains of PBS-treated mice, all of which developed severe disease. It should be noted that 12,000 PFU is equivalent to approximately 50 LD50, so that even after an overwhelming infection, the vaccine showed some efficacy.",

Previous reports showed that passive administration of neutralizing antibody directed against the S protein could prevent infection (Greenough et al., 2005, Rockx et al., 2008, Subbarao et al., 2004, Zhu et al., 2007), so we initially determined anti-SARS-CoV antibody titers by ELISA and neutralization assays at 21 days after immunization with rSARS-CoV-\u0394E or rSARS-CoV-\u0394[E,6-9b], just prior to challenge with MA15 or Urbani strains of SARS-CoV. By ELISA, all mice mounted a detectable antibody response against whole inactivated virus (Table 1\n). Responses to rSARS-CoV-\u0394E and rSARS-CoV-\u0394[E,6-9b] were approximately 10- to 20-fold lower in BALB/c compared to hACE2 Tg mice (pooled samples, 298 \u00b1 19 (n\n = 8) vs. 4054 \u00b1 426 9 (n\n = 6), p\n < 0.0001). Antibody titers were higher in hACE2 Tg mice immunized with rSARS-CoV-\u0394E when compared to rSARS-CoV-\u0394[E,6-9b]-immunized animal, although these differences did not reach statistical significance (p\n = 0.16). Neutralizing antibody titers in the sera of the rSARS-CoV-\u0394E and rSARS-CoV-\u0394[E,6-9b]-immunized BALB/c mice were measured. Neutralizing antibodies were detected in all eight mice, but at low titers (titers of \u2264 1:10). We also measured neutralizing titers using sera from a separate group of hACE2 Tg mice immunized with rSARS-CoV-\u0394E (4 mice) or rSARS-CoV-\u0394[E,6-9b] (5 mice) and again detected only low levels of antibody in the sera (titers of \u2264 1:20 in 2/4 rSARS-CoV-\u0394E and 1/5 rSARS-CoV-\u0394[E,6-9b]-immunized mice).",

Thus, it is very likely that T cells are critical for virus clearance in infected humans or experimental animals. Therefore, we measured SARS-CoV-specific T cell responses in the blood of BALB/c or hACE2 Tg mice at 7 days after immunization with the MA15 or Urbani strains of virus, respectively, and in the spleen at 21 days p.i. by intracellular IFN-\u03b3 release assays. Several CD4 and CD8 T cell epitopes recognized in C57Bl/6 (H-2b-restricted) and BALB/c (H-2d-restricted) mice have been reported (Zhao et al., 2007, Zhi et al., 2005). Using lung mononuclear cells harvested from the lungs of MA15-infected BALB/c and C57Bl/6 mice, we recently confirmed the identity of many of these epitopes and also identified additional epitopes (Zhao et al., 2009). We detected SARS-CoV-specific responses to seven CD8 and one CD4 T cell epitopes in the lungs of infected B6 mice, but for the purpose of assessing efficacy after immunization of hACE2 Tg mice, we measured responses in the blood to two immunodominant CD8 T cell epitopes spanning residues 436\u2013445 and 525\u2013534 of the surface (S) glycoprotein. Responses to both epitopes were detected in the blood of all hACE2 Tg mice at day 7 p.i. and in the spleens of mice sacrificed at day 21 p.i.

For the assays described here, we measured the CD8 T cell response to the immunodominant S366 epitope. The CD8 T cell response was less robust than detected in hACE2 Tg mice, with an S366-specific CD8 T cell response detected in the blood of 5/8 rSARS-CoV-\u0394E and 7/8 rSARS-CoV-\u0394[E,6-9b]-infected mice at day 7 p.i. Mean responses of those with detectable CD8 T cell responses were similar to those detected in the hACE2 Tg mice (1.6 \u00b1 0.6% and 1.7 \u00b1 0.4% for rSARS-CoV-\u0394E and rSARS-CoV-\u0394[E,6-9b], respectively) (Fig. 5\n).

            "text": "A key feature of any live attenuated vaccine is that it must be stable after passage in tissue culture cells, or more crucially, in animals or humans. This is especially true for SARS-CoV, which rapidly underwent adaptation to replication in both intermediate hosts, such as palm civets and in human populations. SARS-CoV may have continued to adapt to human populations, if the epidemic had not been terminated so efficiently and rapidly. To address the stability of rSARS-CoV-\u0394E and rSARS-CoV-\u0394[E,6-9b], we serially passaged both viruses 16 times in Vero E6 cells. After passage, both viruses replicated more efficiently in vitro, with titers that were approximately 20-fold higher than passage 1 viruses (Fig. 6\n). To determine the basis of this increased ability to replicate in Vero E6 cells, we sequenced the complete genome of both passaged viruses. Remarkably, only a single mutation at position 23,312, which resulted in a serine to phenylalanine mutation, was detected in rSARS-CoV-\u0394E passaged 16 times (rSARS-CoV-\u0394E-p16 virus) (Table 2\n). This mutation, which is located outside of the receptor binding domain of the S protein, was also detected when rSARS-CoV-\u0394[E, 6-9b] was passaged 16 times through Vero E6 cells (rSARS-CoV-\u0394[E,6-9b]-p16). As this was the only mutation common to both viruses after tissue culture passage and the only one present in rSARS-CoV-\u0394E-p16, it is likely responsible for improved replication in these cells. An additional mutation was also detected in nsp8 in rSARS-CoV-\u0394[E,6-9b]-p16. The significance of this mutation, located in the primase gene, is unknown. Adaptation occurred rapidly, because the S protein mutation was detected within 5 passages through Vero E6 cells (Table 2).",

Although rSARS-CoV-\u0394E and rSARS-CoV-\u0394[E,6-9b] were equally attenuated in our initial study (DeDiego et al., 2008), it was not expected that they would be equivalently immunogenic. Group-specific proteins have roles in inhibiting type 1 IFN signaling (ORFs 6 and 3b) and in apoptosis induction (ORF3a, ORF3b, E, M, ORF 7a, ORF 8a) (Chen et al., 2007, Frieman et al., 2007, Khan et al., 2006, Kopecky-Bromberg et al., 2006, Lai et al., 2006, Law et al., 2005, Schaecher et al., 2007, Tan et al., 2007, Yang et al., 2005, Ye et al., 2008). Therefore, deletion of these proteins might be predicted to modulate immunogenicity. This did not occur to a significant extent, although rSARS-CoV-\u0394E may induce slightly higher humoral and T cell responses.",

Based on studies of other coronavirus infections, it is likely that both virus-specific T cell and antibody responses are critical for virus clearance. In mice infected with MHV, CD4 and CD8 T cell responses are necessary for virus clearance during the acute phase of the infection whereas anti-MHV antibody is necessary to prevent virus recrudescence (Bergmann, Lane, and Stohlman, 2006).",

Consistent with these results, virus-specific antibody titers in mice infected with MHV, when measured by ELISA, reached a maximum at about 20 days p.i. while neutralizing titers were detectable at 10 days p.i. but did not reach peak values until 45 days p.i.

            "text": "Our results also showed that tissue culture adaptation resulted in a virus that was more immunogenic. One hACE2 Tg mouse died after infection with rSARS-CoV-\u0394E p16, but a greater percentage of mice challenged with rSARS-CoV survived when compared to those immunized with unpassaged virus (Fig. 1, Fig. 7). It should be noted that the gain in virulence was relatively minor since the LD50 of SARS-CoV in hACE2 Tg mice is 250\u2013800 PFU while only 1/20 hACE2 Tg mice died after infection with 12,000 PFU rSARS-CoV-\u0394E p16. No evidence for increased virulence was observed in BALB/c mice, consistent with the extreme susceptibility to infection exhibited by hACE2 Tg mice. Tissue culture adaptation of viruses most often results in the generation of viruses that are attenuated in animals. However, SARS-CoV was in a state of active adaptation to both palm civets, an intermediate host, and humans, when the epidemic was terminated in 2003 (Chinese, 2004, Kan et al., 2005, Song et al., 2005). Thus, it may not be surprising that the virus underwent further adaptation after tissue culture cell passage. The single mutation that was detected in rSARS-CoV-\u0394E was in the S protein, although not in the region responsible for binding to the host cell receptor (Wong et al., 2004). Further development of a rSARS-CoV-\u0394E vaccine will require additional passage through Vero E6 and human tissue culture cells to determine if the virus continues to undergo further adaptation to primate cells and possibly, gains (or losses) in virulence and immunogenicity. This potential for a gain in virulence indicates that it will be important to introduce additional mutations into the virus to ensure safety. One obvious candidate for mutation is nsp1, since this protein is involved in modulating the host immune response (Kamitani et al., 2006, Narayanan et al., 2008, Zust et al., 2007). Mutation of nsp1 in MHV has been shown to attenuate the virus without affecting immunogenicity, and based on the similarity between SARS-CoV and MHV nsp1 s, mutation of nsp1 is predicted to have a similar effect.",

Differences in survival were statistically significant (p < 0.002). (C, D). Six-week-old hACE2 Tg mice were immunized with 12,000 PFU of rSARS-CoV-\u0394E-p16 (circles, n = 8) or rSARS-CoV-\u0394(E,6-9b)-p16 (squares, n = 10) or PBS (triangles, n = 4) and challenged 21 days post-immunization with 12,000 PFU of SARS-CoV Urbani. Survival (C) and weight loss (D) were recorded daily.",
