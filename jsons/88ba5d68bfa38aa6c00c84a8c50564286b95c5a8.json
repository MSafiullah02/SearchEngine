            "text": "Any patient with an inflammatory skin disorder being actively managed with an immunomodulator, who is diagnosed with COVID-19, should stop the immunomodulator (s) immediately, with the possible exception of systemic corticosteroids (see below). Whilst there is little specific evidence of COVID-19 infection being aggravated by immunomodulators as used in otherwise healthy dermatology patients, a precautionary approach is mandated, particularly as any secondary bacterial infection as part of COVID-19 may be aggravated by concurrent use of immunomodulators. Patients who are immunosuppressed appear to be at higher risk of a more severe infection or complications from COVID-19, although the extent of this risk is not known. Although median COVID-19 infection duration is in the order of 2 weeks, it would be sensible to discontinue systemic immunomodulators for at least 4 weeks, and until the patient has completely recovered.",

The possible exception is systemic corticosteroids.",

There is currently insufficient evidence to determine whether patients on systemic immunomodulators are at increased risk of becoming infected with COVID-19. Therefore, the benefit-to-risk ratio of any immunomodulator needs to be carefully assessed (see additional comments below).",

Whilst a number of clinical trials of the newer biologics used in dermatology patients indicate a slight increased risk of developing upper respiratory tract infections (URTI), there does not appear to be a significant increase risk of developing influenza (flu). However, annual influenza vaccination is strongly encouraged (but avoid the live attenuated influenza nasal vaccine). 3. The COVID-19 pandemic is likely to continue for many months before being downgraded to seasonal epidemic status. This means a patient may have their immunomodulator withheld for many months. ",
