Burnet showed in the early 1940s that macaques were susceptible to influenza A virus (Graffe 1991, 121), the principal animal models for extensive immunization trials and strain typing remained ferrets and mice. Recently, researchers have used macaques to compare the pathogenesis of highly virulent influenza strains, such as the reconstructed 1918 pandemic strain and the pathogenic bird flu strain (H5N1), with a nonvirulent conventional strain (H1N1) (Rimmelzwaan et al. 2001). Genomics and proteomics technologies, with macaque-specific reagents, have shown dramatic differences in gene expression in pulmonary lesions induced by the H5N1 influenza virus and tightly co-regulated genes expressed in peripheral white blood cells that might prove a marker of early infection (Baas et al. 2006). Apparent cytokine storms, triggered by alveolar damage from H5N1 virus replication in the lungs, induced an acute respiratory distress syndrome and multiple organ dysfunction at remote sites that were free of virus (Rimmelzwaan et al. 2003). A similar transcriptome approach revealed that the virulent 1918 strain of influenza virus induced a lethal respiratory infection associated with an atypical innate immune response and an abnormal antiviral response (Kobasa et al. 2007). A better understanding of the virus-host interaction in the macaque will aid development of interventions to modulate the host's innate immune response to virulent influenza virus and facilitate early diagnosis. A novel live vaccine, incorporating the H5N1 hemagglutinin influenza virus gene in an avian Newcastle disease virus vector and given via the respiratory tract to African green monkeys, has induced high levels of H5N1 neutralizing antibodies and is therefore considered a candidate for clinical evaluation in humans (DiNapoli et al. 2007).",

Natural outbreaks of human, bovine, or avian TB have occurred repeatedly over the years in captive macaques (Zumpe et al. 1980). Fifty years ago, macaques were used to demonstrate the efficacy of the bacillus Calmette-Guerin (BCG) vaccine, an attenuated strain of M. bovis, and to evaluate other vaccine approaches and test new drugs against lethal challenge with M.tb. (Good 1968; Schmidt 1956). Although researchers have confirmed these results in recent years (Langermans et al. 2001), neither the BCG vaccine nor drugs have curtailed the global spread of TB. But with modern macaque-specific reagents on hand, this model is being resurrected. Interferon gamma release from antigen-specific T cells provides a useful immunologic correlate of protection against M.tb. infection (Baskin et al. 2004).",

Macaques experimentally coinfected with SIV and BCG exhibit a fatal disseminated disease characterized by BCG granulomas in multiple organs (Chen 2004; Shen et al. 2002). Because HIV-infected human infants vaccinated with BCG also experience a high risk of developing disseminated BCG disease (von Reyn 2006), the World Health Organization (WHO) does not recommend BCG vaccination for HIV-infected children (WHO 2007). An SIV-induced compromise of adaptive T cell responses may contribute to this tuberculosis-like disease (Zhou et al. 2003).

These studies also demonstrated an increased expression of virulence genes thought to encode the H. pylori type IV structural pilus and its accessory proteins (Boonjakuakul et al. 2005). A predominant Th1-type immune response is induced early after infection and may be associated with apoptosis of gastric lymphocytes and epithelial cells (Mattapallil et al. 2000; Tanaka et al. 2005). Researchers have evaluated the result of short-term antibiotic treatment on H. pylori infection and intestinal microflora in macaques (Tanaka et al. 2005); several vaccination strategies, including recombinant H. pylori urease, partially protect macaques against infection with this agent (Dubois et al. 1998).",

Based on this research in the NHP model, the Salk inactivated (1955) vaccine as well as the Koprowski and later Sabin (1962) attenuated polio vaccines were tested for immunogenicity, safety, and efficacy in many thousands of human children and were proven to be protective and safe.",

Use of the macaque is therefore still necessary for monitoring the potential neurovirulence of the live attenuated Sabin polio vaccine, which is now administered primarily in developing countries (Rezapkin et al. 1999). (Because reversion to virulence remains a problem with this live attenuated vaccine, it is no longer given in the United States.) A transgenic mouse carrying the human polio virus receptor gene (CD155) has been developed for neurogenic virulence testing (Abe et al. 1995; Nagata et al. 2001), but the global drive to eradicate polio will probably continue to depend on the macaque model to test for neurogenic virulence of the oral vaccine. Importantly, the macaque has been used recently in poliovirus pathogenicity studies (Samuel et al. 1993) and in efforts to develop a hexavalent vaccine against inactivated poliovirus, influenza, hepatitis B, diphtheria, tetanus, and pertussis (Caulfield et al. 2000).",

Inadvertent transmission of either this virus (from humans) or the closely related distemper virus (from dogs) to captive macaques has caused numerous outbreaks with significant morbidity and mortality (Choi et al. 1999; Jones-Engel et al. 2006; Willy et al. 1999). Experimental inoculation of \"wild\" measles virus strains in macaques produces a disease that closely mimics human measles in its clinical and pathologic manifestations, including immunosuppression and occasional central nervous system (CNS1) complications (Albrecht et al. 1977; Kobune et al. 1996). Undetected CNS infection of macaques with measles virus may have affected the results of neurovirulence tests done with some oral poliovirus vaccines (Contreras and Furesz 1992). This animal model has been particularly valuable for studying measles virus pathogenesis in the normal and immunocompromised host (Hicks et al. 1977; Polack et al. 1999; Zhu et al. 1997b). Cellular immunity appears more important than humoral immunity in clearance of the virus (Pahar et al. 2005; Permar et al. 2003).",

Adult macaques, immunized with either the human measles virus vaccine (Attenuvax) or the canine distemper virus vaccine, were protected against challenge infection by human measles virus (Christe et al. 2002). Because maternal measles virus antibody can interfere with the active immune response, experiments were done in infant macaques to compare several recombinant vaccines given in the presence or absence of preexisting immunity. At least partial protection against challenge infection and disease was achieved in infant macaques in the presence of maternal antibody to measles virus by vaccination with (1) replication-competent or -defective vaccinia virus expressing measles virus hemagglutinin and fusion proteins (Stittelaar et al. 2000; Zhu et al. 2000), (2) recombinant BCG expressing the measles virus nucleoprotein (Zhu et al. 1997a), or (3) a measles virus DNA vaccine (Premenko-Lanier et al. 2004). Addition of interleukin (IL1)-12 to a recombinant measles virus vaccine altered the T helper type 2 immune response but did not improve the immunosuppression associated with challenge infection (Hoffman et al. 2003). Very recently, a live attenuated measles virus vaccine given by aerosol administration has been efficacious in macaques (De Swart et al. 2006).",

An inactivated RSV vaccine, developed in the 1960s, caused enhanced disease after natural infection. Researchers reproduced this immunopathological phenomenon in macaques and showed that it was caused by antibody-dependent enhancement of RSV replication (Ponnuraj et al. 2003). A vaccine-induced IL-13-mediated hypersensitivity to subsequent RSV infection also contributed, at least in part, to this adverse reaction (De Swart et al. 2002).

To determine whether HHV-6 might accelerate progression to AIDS in HIV-infected people, researchers coinfected pigtail macaques with HHV-6 and SIV. HHV-6 infection alone in this species was asymptomatic (Yalcin et al. 1992), but in the presence of SIV it appeared to accelerate AIDS progression (Lusso et al. 2007; Yalcin et al. 1992). Also, in vitro infection of macaque T lymphocytes with HHV-6 increased the levels of SIV replication (Lusso et al. 1994). This macaque model may help in investigations of both viral and host factors that influence the interaction between HHV-6 and HIV in progression to AIDS. Based on serology, a related but as yet unidentified herpesvirus may be present in squirrel monkeys and a few macaques (Higashi et al. 1989).",

Almost 100 years later, the complete genome sequence of Ae. aegypti has just been reported (Nene et al. 2007). The natural sources of yellow fever virus are monkeys, originally from tropical West Africa. With the spread of infected humans and Aedes mosquitoes, the virus has adapted to the Americas. Interestingly, yellow fever virus has never been reported in Asia, despite the presence of Ae. aegypti. Mosquito control led to eradication of the virus in Cuba and Panama at the beginning of the 20th century.",

This 17D seed virus is the source of the current human vaccine, which has proven to be stable, safe, and efficacious when given as a single dose. However, occasional cases of fatal hemorrhagic fever have recently been associated with the 17D vaccine (Vasconcelos et al. 2001). Therefore, for quality control, testing of the potential neurovirulence of this vaccine continues in rhesus monkeys (Marchevsky et al. 2003). The 17D yellow fever vaccine strain also now provides the vector for recombinant, chimeric vaccines against other flaviviruses, such as the Japanese encephalitis, Chikungunya, West Nile, and dengue viruses. All of these vaccines have relied on rhesus monkeys for proof of efficacy and for neurovirulence safety testing (as discussed below).",

Attempts to suppress dengue virus type 2 early viremia in rhesus monkeys with recombinant human alpha interferon showed a temporary suppression of viremia but no effect on total viral burden (Ajariyakhajorn et al. 2005). A recombinant modified vaccinia virus expressing the envelope glycoprotein of dengue type 2 virus protected rhesus monkeys against homologous viral challenge (Men et al. 2000). A recombinant, modified live chimeric yellow fever/dengue type 2 virus vaccine (ChimeriVax) protected rhesus monkeys against challenge with wild-type dengue type 2 virus (Guirakhoo et al. 2004); protection correlated with the production of neutralizing antibody. This vaccine is now in phase 1 clinical trials. Most recently, tetravalent live attenuated dengue virus vaccines given to rhesus macaques provided complete protection against viremia from dengue type 2 challenge but only partial protection against the other three serotypes (Blaney et al. 2005; Sun et al. 2006). Interference among the four vaccine viruses will require further dose adjustments to identify an optimal formulation for humans.",

Formalin-killed and attenuated live vaccines have been in use for many years, and the killed vaccine was given during the Second World War to protect American troops in Asia. Rhesus macaques are highly susceptible to a lethal infection that resembles fatal human disease by intranasal inoculation with JEV (Myint et al. 1999). In recent years, macaques have been used to test several recombinant flavivirus vaccines, including JEV and West Nile virus (Dean et al. 2005; Monath et al. 2000; Raengsakulrach et al. 1999). In another study investigators showed that bonnet macaques immunized with the JEV vaccine were protected against West Nile virus, whereas the West Nile virus immunization only reduced the severity of JEV disease (Goverdhan et al. 1992).",

Macaques infected by the intragastric route were protected from lethal disease when challenged later by the intravenous route; this protection correlated best with strong cell-mediated immunity (Rodas et al. 2004). In the last 5 years research has established the LCMV infection of macaques as a surrogate for Lassa virus infection of humans (Djavani et al. 2007). The transcriptome of macaques experimentally infected with LCM virus showed a weak inflammatory response, upregulation of IL-6 expression, evidence of hepatocyte proliferation, and blood changes indicative of major alterations in eicosanoid, immune response, and hormone response pathways (Lukashevich et al. 2003). Research in the early 1980s showed that rhesus monkeys were also susceptible to lethal infection with Lassa virus and that ribavirin treatment and immune plasma were beneficial (Jahrling et al. 1984). These studies showed that shock in the macaque model of Lassa fever is due to biochemical dysfunction of platelets and endothelial cells, which leads to leakage of plasma and hemorrhage (Fisher-Hoch et al. 1987).",

Together with tuberculosis and leprosy, this mycobacterial disease has become a major health problem in over 30 countries, particularly in central Africa. M. ulcerans was first identified in the environment in the 1990s using PCR amplification methods on aquatic insects obtained from endemic areas of Africa. Thus, transmission may occur by biting water bugs of the insect order Hemiptera (Johnson et al. 2005). In southeastern Australia, a recent outbreak of Buruli ulcer was probably transmitted by mosquitoes (Johnson et al. 2007). No specific vaccine is available, but cross-protective efficacy against M. ulcerans experimental infection has been achieved in mice by vaccination with either BCG or plasmid DNA encoding antigen 85 (Ag85A) of M. tuberculosis (Tanghe et al. 2001). However, the lack of an experimental animal model that replicates the spectrum of human disease features, in particular the extensive ulceration, prompted a study on the intradermal inoculation of a cynomolgus monkey with M. ulcerans (Walsh et al. 2007). The inoculation sites developed ulcers within 2 to 4 weeks with the size and rate of progression proportional to the number of organisms delivered. The macaque may thus provide a valuable model for further vaccine development against M. ulcerans.",

Of the four species of such parasites that infect humans, P. falciparum, of avian origin, causes most deaths in Africa, and P. vivax, of macaque origin, accounts for more than 50% of infections outside Africa and 10% of those in Africa (Escalante et al. 1995, 2005). Macaques are susceptible to experimental infection with the sporozoites of P. falciparum and P. vivax as well as those of about 10 related indigenous plasmodium species (e.g., P. cynomolgi, P. fragile, P. coatneyi) (Kawai et al. 2003). Both natural and experimental infections can cause clinical malaria, and various antimalarial drugs successfully eliminate the parasitemia (Puri and Dutta 2005; Wengelnik et al. 2002).

Most vaccine research has focused on blocking the initial infection, using irradiated killed sporozoites, CS surface proteins recombined with hepatitis B virus surface (or core) antigen, adenovirus recombinants, or naked DNA in various combinations and protocols (Heppner et al. 2005; Walsh et al. 2006; Wu et al. 2006). Most experiments have used mice or humans, but macaques have also been used for immunogenicity, efficacy, and safety testing as well as in vaccine tests aimed at recombinant surface proteins of the merozoite or zygote stages (Coban et al. 2004; Dutta et al. 2005). Each of these three vaccine approaches has shown a degree of efficacy in mice, macaques, and humans, but not of a sufficient magnitude to support widespread clinical application. Recently, the transcriptional profile of host gene expression in whole white blood cells was tested in a rhesus monkey model of human P. vivax malaria. The results indicate a downregulation of genes involved in RNA processing during the initial liver stage of infection and an upregulation of defense response genes (Ylostalo et al. 2005). The macaque model may yet direct research efforts toward better vaccines and novel targeted therapies.",

Rhesus monkeys have proven very useful for understanding the immunology of schistosomiasis because they develop a solid immunity to reinfection. Vaccination with a surface antigen gave partial protection against challenge in cynomolgus monkeys (Smith and Clegg 1985). In rhesus monkeys chronically infected with SHIV clade C, coinfection with S. mansoni reactivated viral replication and increased the expression of Th2-associated cytokine response (Ayash-Rashkovsky et al. 2007; Chenine et al. 2005).

A large natural reservoir for the organisms includes other infected humans, domestic animals, and wild animals such as rodents and monkeys. Infection has been described in both free-ranging and captive macaques (Kasa et al. 1977; Olson et al. 1986; Pung et al. 1998). Charles Darwin may have acquired this disease (i.e., cardiomyopathy) (Morris et al. 1990) from the bite of what he called \"a great black bug of the Pampas\" (a Reduvius vinchuca) (Darwin 1839). The acute phase exhibits a skin nodule at the site of the bite (usually on the head) and local lymphadenopathy. Chronic disease affects the nervous system, digestive system, and heart, and causes about 50,000 deaths annually, mostly from heart failure due to associated cardiomyopathy.",

About 50% of rhesus macaques from several different primate facilities are infected with indigenous papillomaviruses (Ostrow et al. 1995). PCR analysis of genital samples from female cynomolgus and rhesus monkeys also showed that they are natural hosts of genital papillomaviruses, which are genetically related to and have a genetic diversity similar to that of the HPVs (Chan et al. 1997). Cervical and vaginal epithelial neoplasms, associated with papillomavirus, were present in 5% of captive female cynomolgus macaques (Wood et al. 2004). Four viral types were associated with cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN), which resembles human CIN. Transfer of cervical cells positive for one of these high-risk papillomavirus types, which are closely related to the highly oncogenic HPV16, to uninfected monkeys resulted in new cervical infections and the development of abnormal cytology (Wood et al. 2007). CIN and squamous cell carcinoma of the cervix resulted from sexual transmission of papillomavirus in a rhesus monkey (Ostrow et al. 1990). The macaque papillomavirus model should prove valuable for further research into the pathogenesis, therapy, and prevention of cervical cancer.",

Vaccine protection appeared to correlate with induction of a cell-mediated immune response. Intrarectal or intratubal inoculation of macaques causes proctitis (Quinn et al. 1986) or salpigitis (Patton 1985), respectively, which have proven useful for understanding pathogenesis (Van Voorhis et al. 1997) and evaluation of systemic antibiotics (e.g., azithromycin) (Patton et al. 2005) and topical microbicides (Patton et al. 2006). Researchers have found that antibodies to a 60kDa C. trachomatis heat shock protein (Peeling et al. 1999) and two proteins including the heat shock protein 60, localized to the bacterial inclusion bodies (Bannantine and Rockey 1999), are markers of persistent infection and a delayed-type hypersensitivity reaction (Lichtenwalner et al. 2004).",

A mild form of this disease was induced with minimal clinical symptoms, rapid clearance of virus, and resolution of the pneumonia. However, parameters of infection were sufficiently apparent that it was possible to show some benefit from therapy with siRNA, given either prophylactically or therapeutically (Li et al. 2005a). Pegylated alpha interferon also had a beneficial effect against SARS-CoV infection in macaques (Haagmans et al. 2004).

Depending on the dose, the viruses induced either uniformly fatal disease resembling human smallpox or less severe systemic disease with lower mortality. High virus levels led to multisystem failure, depletion of T cells, and disseminated intravascular coagulation. cDNA microarrays of host gene expression in circulating white blood cells during infection showed upregulation of cytokines, including IL-6 and alpha interferon, which contributed to a cytokine storm (previously called toxemia) (Rubins et al. 2004).",

Sporadic outbreaks of monkeypox also occur in humans in Africa and in the United States and thus are a public health concern. The reservoir is squirrels and other small mammals, and monkeys and humans are accidental hosts (Hutin et al. 2001; Sale et al. 2006). In 2003, an outbreak of monkeypox in humans in the central United States was caused by contact with pet prairie dogs and other mammals that had been shipped from Gabon to Texas and then transported to pet distributors in the Chicago area (Di Giulio and Eckburg 2004). Vaccinia virus immunization (smallpox vaccine and modified vaccinia virus Ankara) affords long-lasting protection of macaques against monkeypox virus challenge (Earl et al. 2004; Heraud et al. 2006; Stittelaar et al. 2005). Vaccine protection is correlated with the induction of neutralizing antibody against monkeypox virus (Edghill-Smith et al. 2005b), but the smallpox vaccine does not protect macaques with SAIDS against a lethal monkeypox challenge (Edghill-Smith et al. 2005a). A smallpox DNA vaccine, consisting of four vaccinia virus genes, and a modified vaccinia Ankara DNA vaccine also protected macaques against otherwise lethal challenge with monkeypox virus (Hooper et al. 2004; Nigam et al. 2007). Treatment of macaques with antiviral compounds such as cidofovir, 24 hours after lethal intratracheal MPXV infection, was more effective at reducing mortality than vaccinia virus vaccination (Stittelaar et al. 2006).",

Cynomolgus macaques immunized with DNA encoding the viral glycoprotein survived virus challenge, whereas nonvaccinated controls developed fatal rabies (Lodmell et al. 1998). Protection with both vaccines correlated with the induction of neutralizing antibodies. Very early (<6 hrs) postexposure treatment with interferon or a potent interferon inducer also significantly reduced mortality (Baer et al. 1977; Weinmann et al. 1979).

The reservoir hosts in Africa are not known, although small mammals (possibly rodents or bats) are suspected. Wild nonhuman primates, including macaques, are, like humans, accidental hosts. These viruses are usually transmitted to humans through contact with an infected animal. A summary of Marburg and Ebola virus infections in laboratory NHPs is available (Schou and Hansen 2000). A total of 23 Marburg and Ebola virus outbreaks have been reported among humans and monkeys since the first documented outbreak in Marburg, Germany, in 1967. Most of the 1,100 human cases, with 800 deaths, occurred in Africa after contact with infected patients. In 1989, Ebola virus and simian hemorrhagic fever virus were isolated from a cynomolgus macaque imported to the United States from the Philippines. Human animal handlers became infected but did not get sick (Dalgard et al. 1992). In recent years, there have been several outbreaks of human and animal Ebola in Gabon and Republic of Congo. The epidemics were associated with different viral strains and high mortality of gorillas, chimpanzees, and duikers, and resulted from the handling of infected animal carcasses (Leroy et al. 2004).",

By contrast, treatment with recombinant alpha interferon or immunoglobulin has little benefit; neutralizing antibodies fail to protect or alter the course of Ebola virus infection in the monkeys (Oswald et al. 2007). Live attenuated recombinant vaccines protected macaques almost 100% against the Ebola and Marburg viruses. One of the vaccines was based on replication-competent vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) expressing the envelope glycoprotein of the Marburg virus (Hevey et al. 1998). The vaccine induced cross protection against two heterologous strains of Marburg virus (Daddario-DiCaprio et al. 2006a) and also gave strong protection against lethal Marburg virus challenge if given within 30 minutes after virus inoculation (Daddario-DiCaprio et al. 2006b). Similar protection against both Ebola and Marburg virus was achieved using Venezuelan equine encephalitis (VEE) virus as a vector to express the glycoprotein and nucleoprotein of Ebola virus (Geisbert et al. 2002). A recombinant adenovirus carrying the Ebola virus glycoprotein was also protective. Most remarkably, macaques that received a combination DNA vaccine for Marburg virus, Ebola virus, VEE virus, and B. anthracis developed protective immunity against each agent (Riemenschneider et al. 2003). A recent report describes the protection of macaques against Ebola virus by topical immunization through the respiratory tract with a human parainfluenza virus type 3 vaccine vector used to express the Ebola virus surface glycoprotein (Bukreyev et al. 2007).",

This vaccine (AVA) was used to immunize individuals at high risk of occupational exposure. More recently, investigators have evaluated vaccines composed of a recombinant form of the PA in rhesus macaques (Hepler et al. 2006; Phipps et al. 2004; Williamson et al. 2005); they found that the animals were fully protected against a lethal dose of aerosolized bacteria and that protection correlated significantly with neutralizing antibodies, which also conferred passive immunity to B. anthracis challenge of na\u00efve macaques. A DNA vaccine for anthrax is also efficacious in macaques (Riemenschneider et al. 2003). Transcriptional profiles of about 200 genes in PA-stimulated peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) after anthrax vaccine gave a response representative of innate and adaptive immunity (Rogers et al. 2006). These studies predict that the PA-based vaccines should be efficacious in humans. This animal model has also been used for testing antibodies against inhalation anthrax given either alone or together with the vaccine (Kao et al. 2006; Kelly et al. 1992).",

This macaque model was used 40 years ago to develop an efficacious live attenuated tularemia vaccine (Tulis et al. 1970). Long-lasting vaccine protection correlated with the presence of strong cell-mediated immunity against F. tularensis.",

However, direct human-to-human aerosol spread of Yersinia pestis presents a current bioterrorism threat and has prompted efforts to develop a plague vaccine. A case of chronic pneumonic plague in a rhesus monkey has been reported (Ransom and Krueger 1954). A live attenuated Y. pestis vaccine proved to be effective in macaques (Meyer et al. 1974). Recently, vaccination of cynomolgus macaques with flagellin, a toll-like receptor agonist and a fusion of the F1 and V antigens of Y. pestis, induced a strong antigen-specific IgG antibody response and was protective against lethal respiratory challenge with Y. pestis (Honko et al. 2006; Williamson et al. 2007). Immunization of cynomolgus macaques with recombinant Y. pestis F1 and V antigens made in plant vector systems provided complete protection against lethal challenge with Y. pestis (Mett et al. 2007).",

These experiments involved many macaques and sooty mangabeys housed at the California National Primate Research Center.2 Blind passages were carried out in an effort to amplify a putative human virus. Surprisingly, several of the human diseases\u2014for example, kuru, restricted to New Guinea, and Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD), of worldwide distribution\u2014were transmissible to chimpanzees, gibbon apes, and several species of New World monkeys and macaques (Espana et al. 1975; Gajdusek and Gibbs 1971; Gibbs and Gajdusek 1973; Masters et al. 1976). Each disease featured spongiform noninflammatory pathology in the brain and was similar in this respect to other transmissible spongiform encephalopathies that occur in sheep (scrapie), mink, deer, elk (chronic wasting disease, CWD), and cattle (bovine spongiform encephalopathy, BSE). Spontaneous spongiform encephalopathy has also been observed in a young adult rhesus monkey (Bons et al. 1996). These diseases are caused by abnormally folded protein aggregates, called prions. Other prion-associated spongiform encephalopathies that commonly occur in older humans, such as Alzheimer's disease, are not infectious.",

Large amounts of the prion protein were present in lymphoid organs and smaller amounts in the nervous system. Lymphoid organs and blood thus represent a high risk for iatrogenic transmission of the infectious prions.

Unlike SIV and HIV, SRV causes a generalized infection of both T and B cells (Maul et al. 1988), is genetically stable, and can be controlled by neutralizing antibodies, whether induced naturally or by vaccines (Kwang et al. 1987; Marx et al. 1986). Many of the same opportunistic pathogens associated with SIV and HIV infection also exist in macaques with SIV infection. Interestingly, SRV-infected macaques are the major source of a Kaposi's sarcoma (KS)\u2013like lesion called retroperitoneal fibromatosis (RF) (see the section on Kaposi's sarcoma). In contrast to SIV, SRV infection is not associated with B cell lymphomas or activation of latent EBV-like virus. Although humans do not harbor a type D retrovirus and are not susceptible to productive infection with SRV, we include it because it is an important model for retrovirus-induced immunosuppression and RF. Additionally, SRV must be eliminated in NHPs used for research, particularly in studies of SIV-induced SAIDS.",

The complete sequencing of both human EBV and the macaque EBV-related virus shows strong similarities (Rivailler et al. 2002). Like human EBV, the macaque virus generally causes a lifelong, asymptomatic, latent infection. Key aspects of human acute EBV infection are reproducible in the macaque model, including oral transmission, atypical lymphocytosis and lymphadenopathy, and activation of B cells, all features of infectious mononucleosis. Cytotoxic T cell responses are mostly responsible for containing virus replication (Fogg et al. 2006). As seen in humans with AIDS, the macaque EBV-like virus is activated in association with opportunistic B cell lymphomas that occur in the course of SIV-induced simian AIDS or with post-transplant immunosuppression (Habis et al. 2000; Schmidtko et al. 2002).

RFHV, yet to be isolated and fully characterized as a replication-competent virus in vitro, is associated with a spontaneous disease in macaques called retroperitoneal fibromatosis (RF). Described in the 1980s in pigtail macaques (M. nemestrina) (Giddens et al. 1985), RF closely resembles human KS in its histopathology, except for the lack of skin manifestations. RF tumor cells contain multiple RV-1 genome copies, and the pattern of infectivity and latent antigen expression is similar to that of human KS (Bruce et al. 2006). Genomewide transcription patterns for RRV closely resemble the transcription profile for KSHV in infected fibroblasts (Dittmer et al. 2005). RRV is only infrequently detected by real-time PCR at low levels in peripheral blood of healthy macaques and more frequently in SIV-infected animals. However, RRV is not detected in SAIDS-associated lymphomas or lymphoid hyperplasia (Ruff et al. 2003). Experimental infection of macaques with RRV alone or together with SIV has induced generalized lymphadenopathy in a few animals, but as yet no RF lesions or lymphomas (Estep et al. 2007; Mansfield et al. 1999; Wong et al. 1999). If an infectious isolate or molecular clone of RFHV can eventually be derived, it will be interesting to determine whether this agent can induce RF in macaques. Because RRV replicates at very low levels and induces no specific pathology, it is unlikely to provide a useful animal model for disease (Renne et al. 2004).",

These viruses are the single most important cause of severe diarrhea in infants and young children worldwide. Nonhuman primates, including macaques, are naturally infected with simian rotavirus strains, several of which (e.g., SA11, YK1) have been used for experimental infection of macaques (Soike et al. 1980; Westerman et al. 2005). In the natural simian host, diarrhea is usually not manifest and neonatal serum antibody of maternal origin is not associated with resistance to rotavirus infection or disease. However, intragastric challenge of newborn and infant cynomolgus macaques with the simian rotavirus strain SA11 does induce diarrhea (Petschow et al. 1992). Newborn macaques also are susceptible to experimental infection and diarrheal disease from human rotavirus isolates (Leong and Awang 1990; Majer et al. 1978; Wyatt et al. 1976). Baboons and vervet monkeys are similarly susceptible to experimental infection with human rotavirus but do not develop diarrhea (Chege et al. 2005). In 1998 a tetravalent rhesus-human reassortant rotavirus vaccine was licensed by the FDA as a live attenuated human vaccine; however, it was withdrawn when the incidence of intussusception in vaccinated infants increased above control (Murphy et al. 2001). Several human rotavirus vaccines are currently undergoing human trials.",

TBE virus has been isolated from over 20 species of ticks, but the main vectors are Ixodes persulcatus and I. ricinus. Experimental infection of macaques results in viral persistence and encephalitis (Frolova et al. 1985; Kenyon et al. 1992; Pogodina et al. 1981). A naturally occurring case of TBE was reported in a macaque at a German monkey park (Suss et al. 2007). Using the rhesus monkey model of intranasal infection a commercial vaccine protected against a wild-type virus isolate and elicited an effective immune reaction without any evidence of immune enhancement (Hambleton et al. 1983). This effective vaccine is now available for individuals at risk (Suss 2003).",

Experimental inoculation of SPV in na\u00efve macaques induces temporary arrest of erythroid cell production, analogous to that observed in B-19 infection of humans (O'Sullivan et al. 1997). Similarly, mid-term SPV inoculation in macaque fetuses leads to fetal hydrops. PCR detection of parvovirus infection in monkeys has proven to be more sensitive and specific than serology (Gallinella et al. 2003). Although there is no proven human infection with SPV, it must be considered a potential zoonosis, especially given the ability of the virus to replicate in human bone marrow cells in vitro and the high level of viremia that develops in infected macaques.",

In humans with AIDS and macaques with SAIDS, activation of JC or SV40 virus, respectively, causes demyelinating CNS disease, called progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy. Genetic analysis of natural SV40 isolates from the brains and kidneys of several macaques revealed that the enhancer sequence organization is different from that of the laboratory strain of SV40 (Ilyinskii et al. 1992). Furthermore, another PV related to but distinct from SV40 was recently recovered from a number of cynomolgus macaques that were immunosuppressed to promote acceptance of renal allografts or xenografts (van Gorder et al. 1999). This virus, called CPV, caused interstitial nephritis in many of the grafted and native kidneys, as well as a late-onset ureteritis with stenosis in the graft recipients. CPV represents an excellent model for the BK polyomavirus-induced interstitial nephritis and ureteral stenosis that occur in human renal transplant recipients. Researchers have recently discovered novel PVs in some human patients with acute respiratory tract infection (Gaynor et al. 2007).",

Campylobacter has also induced fetal death in a rhesus monkey (Baze and Bernacky 2002). Animals and contaminated food are sources of the bacteria. Rhesus and pigtail macaques are susceptible to experimental infection and colitis from a human strain of Campylobacter (Fitzgeorge et al. 1981; Russell et al. 1989). Interestingly, early efforts to infect rhesus monkeys with the related V. cholera were unsuccessful (Ivanoff et al. 1978).",

Mucosal invasion of the colon was essential to the development of the fluid and electrolyte transport defect that led to the dysentery. In addition, jejunal transport abnormalities contributed to the diarrhea. Arthritis and amyloidosis in SIV-infected rhesus macaques have been associated with S. flexneri breakdown products in the intestine (Blanchard et al. 1986; Chapman and Crowell 1977; Urvater et al. 2000).

Over 30 years ago rhesus macaques were exposed to aerosols of influenza virus and S. pneumonia: the bacteria were cleared from the lower respiratory tissues but persisted in the upper respiratory tract (Berendt et al. 1974). Rhesus monkeys also served as a model for disseminated intravascular coagulation after experimental bloodstream infection (Hawley et al. 1977). In 1995 a fatal case of S. pneumonia meningitis was reported in a 3-month-old lion-tailed macaque (M. silenes) at the Baltimore Zoo (Graczyk et al. 1995). Since the early 1990s several pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccines have demonstrated effectiveness against infection in older children and adults, and subsequent immunogenicity studies in rhesus macaques led to the development of newer polysaccharide vaccines now available for children from 2 to 15 months of age (McNeely et al. 1998). However, adaptation of the adult vaccine is necessary to provide stronger and longer-lasting protection and higher efficacy in immunocompromised populations. To help answer this need, attempts are under way to develop a rhesus macaque model for pneumococcal vaccine assessment (Philipp et al. 2006).",

Experimental periodontitis can be induced in macaques by placement of periodontal silk ligatures or orthodontic elastic as well as by surgical removal of alveolar bone (Schou et al. 1993).

Macaques manifest a subgingival flora resembling that found in humans, including members of Actinobacillus, Porphyromonas, Bacteroides, Campylobacter, and Fusobacterium. In cynomolgus macaques, antibody titers and relative levels of P. gingivalis were inversely correlated, suggesting that a humoral immune response may be efficacious in reducing overgrowth with this bacterium (Persson et al. 1994).

Additionally, natural infections of macaques with agents related to human pathogens extend the value of these animals. A further major benefit of this research is the alleviation of infectious disease for macaques as well as other primate species. Comparative studies in both human and macaque hosts are needed to address continuing problems caused by many infectious diseases that remain intractable. Factors such as increased travel, population growth, and changing ecology are giving rise to new and emerging infectious diseases. Recent advances in genomic, proteomic, metabolomic, and related technologies make macaque models all the more timely for studies aimed at improving the treatment and control of infectious diseases in humans and macaques alike\u2014\"one medicine\" in action!",
