But in situations like epidemic outbreaks, real-time feedback and a rapid response is critical. Social Web media is a profitable medium to extract the society opinion in real time. Blogs, micro-blogs (Twitter), and social networks (Facebook) enable people to publish their personal opinions in real time, including geo-information about their current locations. These big data with situation and context aware information about the users provide a useful source for public healthcare. However, the extraction of information from web is a difficult task due to its unstructured definition, high heterogeneity, and dynamically changing nature. Because of this diversity in the data format, several computational methods are required for its processing and analysing [17] (data mining, natural language processes (NLP), knowledge extraction, context awareness, etc...).",

In the first stage, the texts are classified into relevant or non-relevant categories using to train a naive Bayes classifier.

These methods can be used to detect words related to diseases or their symptoms in published texts [20] . But this goal can be difficult because the same word can refer to a different thing depending upon context. Furthermore, a specific disease can have multiple names and symptoms associated which increases the complexity of the problem. Ontologies can help to automate human understanding of key concepts and relations between them and allow that a level of filtering accuracy can be achieved. Biomedical ontologies contain lists of terms and their human definitions, which are then given unique identifiers and classified into classes with common properties according to the specific domain treated. In the domain of EI it is necessary to identify and link term classes such as disease, symptom and species in order to detect potential focus diseases. Currently there are various available ontologies that contain all the biomedical terms necessary. For example, BioCaster ontology (BCO) [12] is in the OWL Semantic Web language to support automated reasoning across terms in 12 languages.",

This work shows that many objective functions for detecting outbreaks in networks, such as detection time, likelihood, and population affected, are submodular. This means that, for instance, reading only a few blogs provides more new information than reading it after we have read many ones. They use this characteristic to develop an efficient approximation algorithm (CELF) which achieves near-optimal solutions and it is 700 times faster than a simple greedy algorithm.",

Furthermore, user posts retrieved from the public Twitter API can come with GPS-based location tags, which can be used to detect potential disease outbreaks for a health surveillance system. Recently, several works have already appeared shown the potential of Twitter messages to track and predict disease outbreaks. Ritterman et al. [27] work is focused on using prediction market to model public belief about the possibility that H1N1 virus will become a pandemic. In order to forecast the future prices of the prediction market, they decided to use the Support Vector Machine algorithm to carry out regression. A document classifier to identify relevant messages is presented in Culotta et al. paper [13] . In this work, Twitter messages related to flu were recollected during 10 weeks using keywords such as flu, cough, sore throat or headache. Then, several classification systems based on different regression models to correlate these messages with CDC statistics were compared, finding that the best model achieves a correlation of 0.78 (simple model regression).",

This system can be useful not only for early prediction of disease outbreaks, but also for monitoring distribution of different cancer types and the effectiveness of the treatments used. Well known regression models are evaluated on their ability to assess disease outbreaks from tweets in Bodnar et al. [4] . Regression methods such as Linear, Multivariable an SVM, are applied to the raw count of tweets that contain at least one of the keywords related to a specific disease, in this case \"flu\".
