Traditionally electrocardiogram (ECG) and pulse oximeter attached to the fingertips or earlobes were used to measure the heart rate. These methods often caused discomfort to the patient [1], [2]. The ability to monitor heart rate remotely by non-contact means is a growing interest in healthcare [3], [4]. The Research on remote health sensing is more focus towards personal health monitoring. The applications mainly spread through, monitoring of neonatal patients, health monitoring for ergonomics, for driving assistance, monitoring while training/exercising and monitoring during human-computer interaction [5]. The main aim is to monitor the physiological signals from patient/ individual. The heart rate, respiratory rate, breathing rate, and oxygen saturation are some of the commonly analyzed physiological parameters.",

The proficiency to perform multiple sensing using single sensor has motivated researchers to make this technology sustainable [14], [1]. The application and maturity of the technology are still in progress. Digital camera based heart rate measurement method operates based on two broad principles, photoplethysmography (PPG), and ballistocardiography (BCG). The digital camera based heart rate measurement method using photoplethysmography extracts physiological signals from the heart by capturing microscopic color variations of the skin, mainly the facial area [15], [16], [17]. Ballistocardiography based methods rely on the mechanical motion of the heart. The mechanical motion contributes to a microscopic displacement of the head/face or facial skin [18], [19]. Many digital camera based heart rate measuring methods have been proposed using these two principles; a comprehensive survey and review on the details of the methods can be found in [20], [13].",

During this session, 45 subjects were used to collect the data. The subjects were divided into three groups of 15 subjects each by visually inspecting their skin tone. The three groups pertained to three major skin tones: Fair/Pale, Brown, and Black see (Fig. 4\n). Since the object is to determine the effect caused by the variance of skin tone, the subjects were asked to sit idle with minimum physical movement, facing the camera.",

As the distance of the subject from the camera increases the clarity of the facial features also would reduce (see Fig. 5\n). Therefore, the feasibility of extracting microscopic variations of the features also would reduce, which results in an uncertainty of reliability of the heart rate measuring method. During this session, the cam2 was used to record the data of 45 individuals/subjects from three different distances. The subject was asked to ascend to three distance points from the camera and was asked to stand idle with minimum physical movement, facing the camera. The subject stood idle at three points from the camera at a distance of 500 cm on point A, a distance of 700 cm on point B and a distance of 1000 cm on point C (See Fig. 6\n).",

The Discriminative Response Map Fitting method also failed to obtain facial landmark fitting for 39 subjects (see Fig. 9(f)). The false detection disabled the heart rate measuring methods to operate under realistic situations. Therefore, a foreground segmentation based preprocessing step was included to all the heart rate measuring methods to narrow down the region of interest to the foreground of the scene (see Fig. 9(g)). The foreground detection method, was implemented by extracting the initial frame and segmenting the foreground by using active contour model [28] to extract a binary silhouette. The color image was cropped using the binary silhouette of the detected foreground object to narrow down the region of interest. The face detection algorithm was applied to the segmented image to extract the feature points. After that, the feature points were used for the face detection method that operated on the remaining of the incoming frames to reduce the face detection.",

Also, the distance, reduce the clarity of the pixel values, therefore, baffling the microscopic color changes that amount to the PPG signal generation. Similarly the motion feature based method [18], also conceded a high error rate and reported a low Pearson correlation coefficient.

The study was mainly carried out to understand the effects of realistic conditions for the application of health monitoring which deals with health monitoring at public spaces (i.e. airports, subways, malls). The experiment was conducted on 45 subjects to assess four issues that could affect the reliability of the heart rate measuring methods at realistic situations. The feasibility was evaluated for illumination variance, motion variance, and skin tone variance and distance variance. The results were analyzed and discussed for each experiment. Five heart rate measuring methods based on five different feature selection methods were re-implemented and tested for these scenarios. We tested the methods on the neutral session of the MANHOB-HCI database to verify that the state of the art methods were re-implemented correctly.",

The results of the first experiment (i.e. neutral session), showed that the reliability of the methods was highly affected by the diversity of the realistic environment. A preprocessing foreground selection step was included to all the heart rate measuring methods to narrow the ROI to operate at the realistic environment. The reliability was mainly affected by motion artifact caused by the spatial illumination variance of the face. The experiments of the illumination variance session showed that the reliability of heart rate measuring methods based on PPG is directly proportional to the illumination level of the room. However, the motion feature based BCG method showed that the BCG based approach is invariant to illumination variance and can measure heart rate under low illumination levels.",

The effect of skin tone variance was significant for the PPG-based method. The BSS approach of using RGB spectrum was able to perform better in measuring the heart rate from all three skin tones. However, the results derived from the green spectrum based method did not perform well as the other PPG method. Therefore the idea of using a function of two spectra or all three spectra may be useful in measuring the heart rate across different skin tones.",

As the subject was further apart from the camera; the size of the ROI reduced greatly. This affected the heart rate measuring methods since most of the methods generate the raw signal by estimating the spatial mean of the ROI. Thus smaller ROI leading to poor spatial mean estimation. Also the methods were affected by the clarity of the facial features of the face while standing at a distance. This is mainly use to the camera hardware specifications, specifically the focal length. The methods were not able to operate at many sessions due to ROI loss and ROI drift issues. However, the heart rate measurement by Feng et al. [27], at 500 cm point was promising. The re-implemented methods that were tested in this study were developed for controlled environments. By incorporating the ideas and the feature selection methods used by each of the methods; one can further improve the reliability of heart rate measurement for uncontrolled realistic environments.",

Future research should be conducted to address these issue. An interesting direction would be to incorporate advanced computer vision and deep learning based method to perform face/landmark detection and tracking in realistic environments. Remote health monitoring using RGB camera would provide a cheap yet highly efficient solution for health monitoring of crowd. One could perform health monitoring at bottleneck locations of public spaces (e.g. exit and entrance of train stations, malls, and airport) or by using multiple RGB cameras at checkpoints (e.g. immigration checkpoint or ticket counters) to perform individual health monitoring.",
