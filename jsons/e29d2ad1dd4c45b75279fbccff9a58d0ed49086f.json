Diffuse airspace opacification was noted on the last radiographs for all patients who died. The authors concluded that patients presenting with normal findings or focal air-space opacity on chest radiograph had a good clinical outcome. Patients with multifocal opacities that progressed to diffuse opacification and patients presenting with diffuse air-space opacification had a high fatality rate. Chau et al. found that initial chest radiographic score was an independent prognostic factor among the clinical, laboratory and chest radiography variables studied [50] .", "cite_spans": [{"start":
