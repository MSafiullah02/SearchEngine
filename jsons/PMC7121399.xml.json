However, late complications of the conducting airways (e.g., fistula or stenosis) are unusual with conventional doses of RT.

In addition to being directly toxic to cells, ROS/RNS instigate a host of molecular cascades which alter the cytokine milieu leading to chronic inflammation, tissue damage, and remodeling. Edema and extravasation of proteinaceous material into the alveoli can be appreciated within a few weeks after RT as increased density on radiographs (Skoczylas et al. 2000). If the volume of inflammed lung is large, pulmonary symptoms can develop 1\u20136 months after RT. Within 3 months after completing RT (and maybe sooner), there is a reduction in pulmonary function tests secondary to thickening of the intraalveolar septum (edema and fibrosis) and loss of alveoli. The RT-induced microenvironment of chronic inflammation, hypoxia, and fibrosis appears to be self-sustaining leading to progressive decline in pulmonary function. Our understanding of the cellular and biochemical changes that occur in the lung after RT continues to evolve (Brush et al. 2007; Fleckenstein et al. 2007; Tsoutsou and Koukourakis 2006) (see Sect. 3).",

Most patients with breast cancer have ample lung reserve, especially relative to the small volume of lung within the RT fields. Therefore, the incidence of clinical symptoms is low. Typical pneumonitis rates are in the range of 1\u20135 %, with severe injury being even less common.",

Primary lung tumors typically invade into, and replace, normal lung. Further, the primary lung tumor or enlarged hilar/mediastinal lymph nodes can compress central airways/vessels that can decrease overall cardiopulmonary function. In these instances, the damaging effects of RT on the lung are often, at least partially, off-set by RT-induced reductions in tumor mass that may increase lung function. For such patients, the resultant change in lung function after thoracic RT is typically a balance between the radiotoxic effects on the normal lung and improvement in lung function resulting from tumor shrinkage.",

Fibrosis/stenosis of a central vessel or bronchus will render the downstream alveoli nonfunctional.

Resection or injury to a region of lung will not compromise function of adjacent regions.

Indeed, many of the signaling pathways implicated in radiation injury, such as the TGF-\u03b2 pathway, are sensitive to changes in cellular redox status (Tyler and Blackman 1922; Groover et al. 1922). The transient nature of ionizing radiation suggests that a mechanism of amplification of ROS/RNS occurs after radiation. Proposed mechanisms include activation of oxidant-generating enzymes, such as NADPH oxidases, mitochondrial leakage, and the respiratory burst from activated inflammatory mediators recruited to the site of injury. The role of NADPH oxidases is supported by the fact that TGF-\u03b2 is activated by radiation and that in turn, TGF-\u03b2 can activate the NADPH oxidase isoform, Nox4. Newer data coming to light recently have shown a critical role for Nox4 in TGF-\u03b2 mediated apoptosis (Hines 1922) and downstream Smad signaling (Davis 1924).",

            "text": "It is hypothesized that the imbalance between oxidant-generating enzymes and antioxidant capacity is a primary cause of hypoperfusion following radiation (Skoczylas et al. 2000; Vujaskovic et al. 2001). Fleckenstein et al. demonstrated that tissue perfusion begins to decrease 3 days after radiation exposure, resolves for approximately 2 weeks, and then progressively decreases throughout the time of disease progression (Skoczylas et al. 2000). In parallel, the lung tissue becomes increasingly hypoxic (Skoczylas et al. 2000). The late decrease in tissue oxygenation is likely a result of fibrous obliteration of capillaries and decreased gas exchange due to increased alveolar wall thickness and edema/congestion within the alveolar space. The early drop in perfusion cannot be explained by these events and is more likely a result of vasoconstriction, although this is not confirmed. The activation of NADPH oxidase after radiation increases superoxide production, which may suppress vasodilation by oxidizing key enzymes within the NO signaling pathway or through rapid reaction with NO itself to form peroxynitrite. Both of these reactions can interfere with NO signaling leading to vasoconstriction, a transient loss in tissue perfusion, and tissue hypoxia. Tissue hypoxia, a fundamental feature underlying the development of lung injury, develops several weeks after lung irradiation and progresses with time, presumably as a result of injury to the pulmonary vascular and decreased perfusion (Skoczylas et al. 2000; Bernier et al. 2004). Changes in pulmonary perfusion have been observed within months following high doses of radiation in humans (Bentzen 2006; Mikkelsen and Wardman 2003) and within weeks in rodent models (Skoczylas et al. 2000; Rubin et al. 1995; Jackson et al. 2006). In studies by Fleckenstein et al. (Skoczylas et al. 2000), the transient decrease in perfusion was associated with increased edema and elevated expression of hypoxia-inducible factor-1 alpha (HIF-1\u03b1) and TGF-\u03b2. In that study, the vascular perfusion changes were noted before the development of histologically apparent and functional disease.",

This could, in part, contribute to the presence of cytokines in the irradiated tissue weeks to months after exposure (Skoczylas et al. 2000). Jackson et al. (Johnston et al. 1996) found that in vitro TGF-\u03b2 production by macrophages could be induced by hypoxia (0.5% O2), prior to the onset of VEGF production. In that study, incubation with a superoxide dismutase mimetic led to decreased TGF-\u03b2 and VEGF production (Johnston et al. 1996). Thus, it appears that ROS signaling plays a key role in macrophage-associated expression of the above cytokines under hypoxic conditions.",

            "text": "The pro-inflammatory/pro-fibrogenic cytokine transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-\u03b2) has been most extensively studied in regard to its role in the development of radiation-induced lung injury (Fleckenstein et al. 2007; Novakova-Jiresova et al. 2007; Kang et al. 2003; Feletou et al. 1995). TGF-\u03b2 is secreted as an inactive polypeptide by a number of cells including macrophages, fibroblasts, and epithelial cells of the lung. The inactive precursor is sequestered in the extracellular matrix with its latency-associated peptide (LAP), which has been suggested to be the \u201csensory\u201d portion of the protein (Marks et al. 1997; Theuws et al. 2000; Peterson et al. 1992; Dor et al. 2001; Li et al. 2001). The LAP is sensitive to free radicals, changes in cellular pH, and integrins, all of which can induce activation of TGF-\u03b2 which readily binds the TGF-\u03b2 type II receptor to stimulate the Smad second messenger signaling pathway (Bartholdi et al. 1997). Activation of TGF-\u03b2 and subsequent translocation of Smad2/3 protein into the nucleus of the responding cell leads to transcription of genes involved in fibroproliferation and tissue repair (Li et al. 2007; van Hinsbergh et al. 2001). An increase in TGF-\u03b2 protein can be observed within 24 hours following radiation exposure (Skoczylas et al. 2000; Dor et al. 2001; Anscher et al. 1998, 2006). Epperly et al. (Rodemann et al. 1996) found a biphasic TGF-\u03b2 surge associated with the early and delayed radiation response in mice after 20 Gy whole lung irradiation. The establishment of TGF-\u03b2 as a mediator of radiation-induced lung injury has led to a number of studies evaluating circulating serum TGF-\u03b2 levels as a potential biomarker for increased risk of lung injury as well as pre-clinical testing of inhibitors of TGF-\u03b2 and/or its signaling pathway. These studies have used either neutralizing antibodies or adenoviral vectors to demonstrate significantly reduced histological and functional damage in rodent models of lung injury following radiation exposure. Reduced lung damage was also associated with decreased cytokine activity, fewer macrophages, and less oxidative stress (Kang et al. 2003; Barcellos-Hoff 1996; Rahimi and Leof 2007).",

It is now established that chronic oxidative stress and continuous production of cytokines, particularly TGF-\u03b2, play a significant role in sustaining inflammation and fibroproliferation in irradiated lung during the progression of disease. Symptomatic and histologically relevant lung injury is preceded by cytokine production and communication, inflammatory cell infiltration, changes in blood flow and perfusion, and increased vascular permeability (Bernier et al. 2004; Roberts 1999; Barcellos-Hoff 1993; Barcellos-Hoff et al. 1994; Stone et al. 2003, Vujaskovic et al. 2000). Although great progress has been made in identifying the mechanisms underlying radiation-induced lung injury, more comprehensive studies are needed to link the events occurring at the molecular level to cellular and tissue pathology.",

While the radiologic changes associated with this inflammatory reaction are generally limited to the irradiated regions of the lung (Mah et al. 1987; Marks et al. 2000), radiologic changes have been occasionally observed to extend beyond the irradiated field (Gibson et al. 1988; Roberts et al. 1993). Furthermore, bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) following unilateral irradiation reveals increased lymphocytes from both the irradiated and unirradiated lung (Gibson et al. 1988; Roberts et al. 1993; Martin et al. 1999). These observations suggest that radiation pneumonitis may be type of hypersensitivity pneumonitis (bilateral lymphocytic alveolitis) (Abratt and Morgan 2002). Further, the lymphocytes retrieved with BAL are activated T-lymphocytes (Martin et al. 1999), suggesting that immunologic processes are participating in the radiation reaction. The observation that pneumonitis typically responds well to oral prednisone (Salinas and Winterbauer 1995) also supports the inflammatory/immunologic nature of radiation pneumonitis.",

Following modest doses of RT for breast cancer and lymphoma, investigators at the Netherlands Cancer Institute (NKI) report up to 50% recovery by 18 months (Theuws et al. 2000; Boersma et al. 1996). At Duke, we have not seen such recovery, but our study population was predominantly patients with lung cancer receiving higher doses of RT (Woel et al. 2002).",

This is similar to what has been done by surgeons who have tried to relate the percent decline in pulmonary function with the percent of alveoli that are resected (Beckles et al. 2003). We and investigators at the NKI have attempted to relate the sum of the changes in regional perfusion (also termed the integrated response) to changes in pulmonary symptoms and PFTs, with mixed success. While there is a strong correlation between the sum of regional injuries and changes in global function, the correlation coefficients are weak, suggesting that there may be numerous other factors affecting global pulmonary function (Fan et al. 2001; Theuws et al. 1998). The correlation coefficients are higher for the patients with breast and lymphoma than for the patients with lung cancer.",

Diffusing capacity of the lung for carbon monoxide (DLCO) is likely the best parameter to assess lung function after RT, since the ultimate role of the lungs is to facilitate gas exchange. Loss of alveolar surface area and thickening of the intraalveolar septi are the primary causes for reductions in DLCO. Thus, both acute (edema, extravasation of material into the alveoli) and chronic (fibrosis, loss of alveoli) injury can affect DLCO. The forced expiratory volume in 1 s (FEV1) is another useful parameter and often interpreted in the context of the FEV1/FVC ratio (FVC = forced vital capacity). A decreased FEV1 with a normal FEV1/FVC ratio is most consistent with a restrictive process, such as fibrosis. A decreased FEV1 and FEV1/FVC ratio is more consistent with an obstructive process.",

DLCO typically is reduced to a greater degree than FEV1 (Table 5), and many studies appears to show less recovery at \u224812 months than FEV1.

For low-dose rate TBI (5\u201310 cGy/min), assuming lung density corrections, an early study concluded that the threshold dose for pneumonitis is approximately 9 Gy, the TD5 (dose resulting in a 5% complication rate) is approximately 10 Gy, with a TD50 (dose resulting in a 50% complication rate) of 11\u201312 Gy (Keane et al. 1981). When higher dose rates are utilized, principally for hemibody irradiation, the dose response curve is shifted to the left. In this circumstance, the threshold dose was estimated to be approximately 7 Gy, with a TD5 of 8 Gy and a TD50 of approximately 9.3 Gy (Keane et al. 1981). In a more recent, comprehensive review, the TD5 (with cyclophosphamide) was estimated to be much lower, approximately 5 Gy for low-dose rate TBI (Sampath et al. 2005). Both studies demonstrated that the dose response curve for whole lung irradiation is steep such that a difference of only 1\u20132 Gy increases the risk of pneumonitis significantly (Fig. 8) The development of pneumonitis after whole lung irradiation is an ominous sign, proving fatal in up to 80% of patients (Fryer et al. 1978). The difference in mortality for similar doses between TBI and HBI dose response appears to have been due to the low-dose rate protraction for TBI. Decreasing the dose rate from 0.5 to 0.1 by per minute decreases the incidence of pneumonitis associated with whole lung irradiation during TBI. This was a byproduct of greater distance from the radiation source, required to produce a large field to encompass the whole body.\n",

These studies suggest that fractionation increases lung tolerance. However, in two randomized studies comparing single fraction TBI with fractionated TBI, there was no difference in the risk of interstitial pneumonitis (virus + idiopathic) (Table 6). There were less cases of idiopathic pneumonitis with fractionation (Deeg et al. 1986; Girinsky et al. 2000).\n",

This may be secondary to nonuniform distribution of gas exchange throughout the lung and/or incidental heart dose. In mice, Travis et al. (1997) demonstrated that the lower lobes are more radiosensitive (increased respiratory rate, lethality) than the upper lobes. In another rodent study, the respiratory rate following thoracic RT was related to both the volume of lung and heart irradiated (van Luijk et al. 2005). Similarly, RT-induced changes in breathing rate were greater with left- versus right-sided RT in rats (Wiegman et al. 2003), suggesting that incidental dose to the heart may contribute to symptomatic RT-induced lung injury. Many (Graham et al. 1999; Hope et al. 2006; Seppenwoolde et al. 2004; Yorke et al. 2005), but not all (Robnett et al. 2000; Tsujino et al. 2003; Wang et al. 2006) clinical studies have shown increased rates of radiation pneumonitis with treatment of lower lobe tumors. As stated above, part of these effects may be related to incidental cardiac irradiation, as a greater volume of heart is the field with lower lobe targets.",

For patients receiving RT, it has been more challenging to quantitatively relate pre-RT PFTs to the risk of subsequent RT-induced lung injury.

Traditional DVHs assume that all regions of the lung contribute equally to pulmonary function, which is often an erroneous assumption since many patients have heterogenous regional lung function (e.g., from tumor or COPD). Furthermore, metrics such as the V20 or V30 (volume of lung receiving at least 20 or 30 Gy, respectively), consider only a single point on the cumulative DVH. It is apparent that two DVHs with markedly different shape may overlap at the same point (V20, for instance). MLD might be a preferable metric since it considers the entire 3D dose distribution. In practice, it may not be particularly useful to try to determine which parameter is truly \u201coptimal\u201d since there tends to be strong correlations between the different dosimetric parameters, at least with relatively uniform treatment techniques (Fan et al. 2001; Graham et al. 1999; Kong et al. 2006).",

This is especially useful for targets adjacent to critical structures. However, IMRT planning usually delivers lower doses of radiation to larger volumes of surrounding normal tissue. The impact of large-volume/low-dose lung irradiation in the context of curative treatment of lung cancer is not known. The M.D. Anderson Cancer Center recently published the largest clinical experience using IMRT in 68 patients with lung cancer (Yom et al. 2007). In this report, the incidence of grade \u22653 radiation pneumonitis was significantly lower in those patients treated using IMRT versus their comparison group treated with conventional 3D-conformal RT (8 vs. 32% at 12 months, p = 0.002). In the IMRT group, patients with V5 values (volume of lung receiving more than 5 Gy) greater than 70% appeared to be at higher risk of pneumonitis. Other dosimetric parameters (MLD, V20) were not assessed for their association with pneumonitis. Investigators at Memorial Sloane Kettering Hospital noted a similarly low rate of clinical lung injury in patients with non-small cell cancer treated with IMRT (Sura et al. 2008). Additional experience is necessary to confirm the safety and efficacy of IMRT for lung cancer. Further, the dosimetric predictors of pneumonitis might be different with a limited number of conformal beams versus IMRT.",

Further, there is marked inter-patient variation in pre-RT lung disease (e.g., COPD), and tumor-related pulmonary compromise. It may not be appropriate to force strict dose/volume constraints based on pre-RT pulmonary status, since poor pre-RT function maybe due to the tumor itself, and hence may actually improve with RT. Therefore, patients need to be counseled about the possible risks of lung injury and the uncertainty in defining individual risk.

This is particularly relevant when IMRT techniques are utilized or when patients with mesothelioma are treated after extrapleural pneumonectomy. However, further investigation is necessary to understand the biological and clinical ramifications of low-dose RT to large volumes of lung. Symptomatic bronchial stenosis has been observed with doses >70 Gy, thus care should be taken when irradiating central structures to high doses.

Although the exact mechanism is unknown, the pulmonary specific drug toxicity is felt to be in part due to the fact that the inactivating enzyme, bleomycin hydrolase, is less expressed in normal lung tissue compared to other normal tissues (Sikic 1986). Exposure to high FiO2 has also been associated with exacerbation of bleomycin toxicity in animal models and humans (Gilson and Sahn 1985; Allen et al. 1981; Toledo et al. 1982; Tryka et al. 1982). Clinical manifestations include an acute hypersensitivity pneumonitis or a fibrosing alveolitis that may occur acutely, subacutely, or >6 months following exposure. Symptoms are nonspecific, as is the case in many presentations of chemotherapy-induced lung toxicity, and may include fever, cough, chest pain, dyspnea, tachypnea, hypoxemia, etc. Although treatment in the acute setting has traditionally consisted of prompt discontinuation of bleomycin and initiation of corticosteroids, reports are anecdotal and nonrandomized (Maher and Daly 1993; White and Stover 1984).",

For example, in a small series of 24 lung cancer patients treated with 40 Gy of RT with concurrent doxorubicin (10 mg/m2), 13 (54%) developed radiation pneumonitis. Combinations of RT and chemotherapeutic agents with known pulmonary toxicity have generally been associated with higher rates of radiation pneumonitis, including mitomycin-C (Rancati et al. 2003) and bleomycin (Einhorn et al. 1976). The taxane docetaxel, with RT in the locally advanced setting and with gemcitabine in the metastatic setting (Kouroussis et al. 2004), has also been associated with high rates of pneumonitis. For example, in a Japanese phase II study (Onishi et al. 2003), lung cancer patients were treated with 60\u201366 Gy with concurrent weekly docetaxel (20 mg/m2). The rate of grade 3\u20134 pneumonitis was 47%. Fortunately, the chemotherapeutic agents most commonly utilized with RT for lung cancer, such as cisplatin, carboplatin, paclitaxel, and etoposide, have not been consistently shown to increase the risk of pneumonitis (Robnett et al. 2000; Graham et al. 1999; Hope et al. 2006; Hernando et al. 2001). The impact of chemotherapy in the setting of TBI is shown in Fig. 8.",

This was intensely studied by Morgan and Breit who lavaged the contralateral lung in a series of breast cancer patients post-irradiation. Although asymptomatic, the lavaged contralateral lung yielded an increase in lymphocytes and macrophages which was termed an autoimmune effect. Finklestein, Rubin and Williams observed a dramatic increase in the contralateral lung abnormalities following ipsilateral lung irradiation. Other investigators have confirmed abscopal out-of-field effects when confining radiation to the apex or base of lung attributed to cytokine cascades, inducing an inflammatory response in shielded lung segments. DNA damage in micronuclei are also evident in addition to lymph acidic infiltrates. The induction of an acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) in out of field lung, induced by in field radiation pneumonitis can be fatal. Bennett and Million reported that 8% (6/72) of lung cancer patients at necropsy had ARDSas did 3% of patients iiradiated for breast cancer, which had been attributed to bilateral radiation pneumonitis.",

Tumor can spread anywhere within the pleural space, including the fissures, diaphragmatic and pericardial surfaces, and the pleural recesses. RT techniques have historically been suboptimal to fully encompass sites at risk while respecting normal tissue tolerance. Recently, there has been growing interest in IMRT for these patients as it tends to be well suited for the delivery of the necessary concave dose distribution. In an initial report from MD Anderson, a low rate of lethal radiation pneumonitis was noted (1.6%, 1/62) (Stevens et al. 2005). A subsequent report from Harvard could not replicate the safety of this approach. Of 13 patients treated with IMRT, 6 experienced lethal radiation pneumonitis (46%, 6/13) (Allen et al. 2006). The MLD was 15 Gy for patients who developed pneumonitis (all lethal) versus 13 Gy for those who did not (p = 0.07). Similarly, the V20 was 18% for patients who developed pneumonitis versus 11% for those who did not (p = 0.08). In a reanalysis of the data from MD Anderson, fatal pulmonary toxicities (whether previously ascribed to RT or not) were noted to have occurred in 10% of patients. These events were more common in patients with higher V20 values (Rice et al. 2006). While IMRT may be particularly suited for the concave targets encountered with the postoperative treatment of mesothelioma, dose to the contralateral lung must be minimized. In this setting, we recommend limiting the V20 to 4\u201310% and the MLD to <8 Gy (Allen et al. 2006; Rice et al. 2006) (Table 7).",

These approaches assume that hypofunctional regions of lung are permanently nonfunctioning. However, if hypoperfusion is caused by an obstructing tumor, then it may be temporary and may improve with tumor shrinkage, and this should be taken into account in the RT planning process. In our experience, areas of hypoperfusion that are adjacent to large central lung lesions often demonstrate reperfusion on post-RT scans. Conversely, areas of hypoperfusion that are \u201capart\u201d from the gross tumor do not demonstrate reperfusion post-RT.

In DIBH, treatment planning and delivery is performed with the patient holding their breath in deep inspiration. DIBH requires a compliant patient with sufficient pulmonary function to hold their breath for a moderate length of time. DIBH has the added advantage of delivering treatment to an expanded lung, thus irradiating a smaller fraction of the lung for a given target size. Respiratory gating, on the other hand, allows the patient to breathe freely and the beam is turned on during a specified phase of the respiratory cycle and turned off when that phase has passed (Giraud et al. 2006). This technology requires a signal, usually an external marker acting as a surrogate for respiratory motion, to gate the linear accelerator. It is essential to have CT images corresponding to the desired phase of the respiratory cycle for treatment planning, often accomplished using 4D CT technology. Tracking refers to systems where the treatment beam adjusts, in real time, to movements of the intra-thoracic contents. This is most commonly performed using a CyberKnife (Accuray, Sunnyvale, CA) (Nuyttens et al. 2006), but has also been suggested to be possible with synchronized movement of multi-leaf collimators (Keall et al. 2005). Respiratory gating and tracking are potentially less demanding on a patient compared with the breath-hold techniques.",

Amifostine is believed to scavenge harmful free radicals produced by the interaction of ionizing radiation and water molecules. Multiple randomized studies and a meta-analysis (Sasse et al. 2006) have tested the utility of amifostine in patients receiving RT for lung cancer with conflicting results (Table 9). The largest study was performed by the RTOG (Movsas et al. 2005). The incidence of grade \u22653 esophagitis, the primary endpoint of the study, was 30% with amifostine versus 34% without (p = 0.9). The incidence of grade \u22653 pulmonary toxicity was lower in patients receiving amifostine (9 vs. 16%), but this was not statistically significant. This study has been criticized since the drug was given once daily (4 days/week) and the RT was given twice daily (5 days/week), and thus 60% of the RT fractions were delivered without the protector. Conversely, there are several single-institutional randomized trials suggesting protection with amifostine, in which the drug was used during a larger fraction of radiation treatments (Table 9). Presently, given the acute toxicity associated with amifostine (nausea/vomiting, hypotension, infection, rash), and the mixed clinical results, amifostine is not currently utilized widely for patients receiving thoracic RT.\n",

Symptomatic improvement after steroid therapy was first reported by Cosgriff and Kligerman (1951), who noted that although the acute symptoms rapidly abated, fibrosis eventually developed. There are no robust studies assessing the optimal corticosteroid or dosing schedule, though it has been observed that symptoms may recur with a rapid taper or when corticosteroids, prescribed for other reasons, are discontinued after completion of RT (Castellino et al. 1974). We recommend oral prednisone (Salinas and Winterbauer 1995), typically 40\u201360 mg daily for 1\u20132 weeks, followed by a slow taper (reducing ~10 mg every 1\u20132 weeks). It must be remembered that there is a differential diagnosis for shortness of breath occurring after RT. This includes tumor progression, drug toxicity, cardiac disease, pulmonary embolus, anemia, and infection. Since steroids can exacerbate an infection, an initial short course of antibiotics may be considered. The majority of patients with pneumonitis recover. However, symptoms can be serious enough to require oxygen or hospitalization, and can be potentially fatal.",

Treatment was continued for 6 months. There was a significant reduction in both fibrotic surface regression (60 vs. 43%, p = 0.04) and volume regression as based by ultrasound (73 vs. 51%, p = 0.054), comparing the combined treatment arm with the control arm. Neither pentoxifylline alone nor alpha-tocopherol alone was effective. Interestingly, there was a marked decrease in fibrosis in the double placebo arm. Another agent that has shown preliminary promise is liposomal superoxide dismutase. In a preclinical study (Lefaix et al. 1996), this agent has been shown to reverse RT-induced fibrosis with regeneration of normal tissue in the previously fibrotic region. A single arm clinical study has also been reported (Delanian et al. 1994). Patients (n = 34) with palpable radiation-induced fibrosis were treated with 3 weeks of liposomal Cu/Zn superoxide dismutase. All patients showed some clinical regression within weeks of initiation of treatment. Though promising, further study is necessary to confirm these findings. Currently there are no widely accepted treatments for lung fibrosis and management continues to be entirely supportive.",

            "text": "Almost immediately after Wilhelm Conrad R\u00f6entgen discovered \u201ca new kind of ray\u201d in 1895, X-rays were employed to shrink malignant tumors (Pusey 1905) (Table 10). Primitive X-ray machines were limited by their low energy, and were consequently only able to treat superficial tumors effectively (Bernier et al. 2004). Initially, most tumors were managed with only a few relatively large doses of RT. Although reasonable tumor control was achieved, it was noted that fibrosis often developed in surrounding soft tissues (Evans and Leucutia 1925; Tyler and Blackman 1922). Pulmonary and pleural reactions were, as expected, seldom observed (Evans and Leucutia 1925). Technological advances in the early twentieth century allowed deeper-seated tumors to be treated. The effects of RT on normal tissues deep to the skin surface were subsequently noted. In 1921, Groover et al. (1922) reported the following to the Southern Medical Association:\nIn a considerable number of cancers of the breast which have been treated\u2026an irritative, unproductive cough has developed\u2026.with a certain amount of dyspnea. Shortly afterward certain pulmonary changes have been demonstrable in the roentgenogram in cases which have previously shown no evidence of intra-thoracic pathology\u2026In at least one case the infiltration assume(d) a more fibrotic appearance. The natural assumption would be that these pulmonary phenomena are due to metastasis, but certain clinical observations have led us to consider seriously the possibility of their being caused by the treatment instead\u2026It is at once apparent that it is of vital importance to determine the significance of these pulmonary phenomena\u2026and if due to treatment\u2026they become of very great therapeutic significance.\n",
