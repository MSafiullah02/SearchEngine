This area of immunological research has been highly active for the past 50 years and is now enjoying unprecedented bench-to-bedside clinical success. Here, we provide a comprehensive historical and biological perspective regarding the advent and clinical implementation of cancer immunotherapeutics, with an emphasis on the fundamental importance of T lymphocyte regulation.

Wilhelm Busch and Friedrich Fehleisen were the first to describe an epidemiological association between immune status and cancer. They noticed spontaneous regression of tumours following the development of erysipelas, a superficial skin infection most commonly caused by Streptococcus pyogenes 1 . Later, William Coley, often called the 'Father of Cancer Immunotherapy' , retro spectively demonstrated that erysipelas was associated with a better outcome in patients with sarcoma 2 . With hopes of prospectively verifying his epidemiological evi dence, Coley treated patients with cancer with extracts of heatinactivated S. pyogenes and Serratia marcescens to boost immunity 3 . This extract, termed 'Coley's tox ins' , possessed potent immunostimulatory properties and achieved favourable responses in various cancers 2 . However, lack of scientific rigour and reproducibility, in concert with the discovery of radiotherapy and chemo therapeutic agents, prevented treatment with 'Coley's toxins' from becoming standard practice 1 .",

            "text": "The concept of cancer immunotherapy resurfaced in the twentieth century and made significant headway with the advent of new technology. In 1909, Paul Ehrlich hypothesized that the human body constantly gen erates neoplastic cells that are eradicated by the immune sys tem 3 . Lewis Thomas and Sir Frank Macfarlane Burnet independently conceived the 'cancer immuno surveillance' hypothesis, stating that tumourassociated neoantigens are recognized and targeted by the immune system to prevent carcinogenesis in a manner similar to graft rejection 1 . Productive immune responses following tumoural adoptive transfer in mice 4 and clinical reports of spontaneous regression of melanoma in patients with concomitant autoimmune disease 5 provided additional evidence supporting this hypothesis, although a unifying mechanism was elusive. The advent of knockout mouse models provided the necessary technology to experi mentally demonstrate a link between immunodeficiency and cancer 6 . Additional molecular and biochemical advances led to the identification of tumourspecific immune responses 7 . This provided unequivocal evi dence that the immune system, in particular T cells (see Box 1 and Fig. 1 ), was capable of waging war on cancer tissue 7 . Cancer immunotherapy has now revolutionized the field of oncology by prolonging survival of patients with rapidly fatal cancers. The number of patients eligi ble for immunebased cancer treatments continues to skyrocket as these therapies position themselves as the first line for many cancer indications. Novel treatment combinations and newly identified druggable targets will only expand the role of immunotherapy in the treatment of cancer in the decades to come.",

The CTLA4 and CD28 genes are found in the same region of chromo some 2 (2q33.2) and are selectively expressed in the haematopoietic compartment 11 . However, in contrast to the high levels of basal CD28 expression on conven tional T cells, CTLA4 is expressed at a low basal level and is strongly induced following antigen activation. Interestingly, CD4 + CD25 + regulatory T (T reg ) cells, which have an immunosuppressive function, express CTLA4 constitutively. Structurally, both CTLA4 and CD28 form membranebound homodimers comprising an extra cellular immunoglobulinlike domain, a transmembrane region and a cytoplasmic tail capable of recruiting sig nalling proteins and controlling surface expression 10, 12, 13 . The trafficking of CTLA4containing vesicles to the cell surface after activation is controlled by a physical interaction with the lipopolysaccharideresponsive and Box 1 | T cell function, development, activation and fate the 1960s represented a period of enlightenment within the field of immunology because two major subtypes of lymphocytes, B lymphocytes and t lymphocytes, were characterized 264, 265 . this was recognized by the 2019 Lasker award for Basic science, awarded for the pioneering work by Jacques a. F. P. Miller and Max Dale Cooper that defined the key roles of T cells and B cells in adaptive immunity. B cells recognize circulating antigen in its native form and respond by secreting protective anti bodies 266 . By contrast, T cells recognize peptide antigens, derived from proteins degraded intracellularly, that are loaded onto cell surface MHC molecules, a process called antigen presentation. two broad classes of T cells that have distinct effector mechanisms are delineated by the expression of either the CD4 or CD8 coreceptor: CD4 + T cells detect antigen in the context of MHC class ii molecules and orchestrate the adaptive arm of the immune system by producing cytokines with chemo tactic, proinflammatory and immunoprotective properties 267 . at least one CD4 + T cell subclass, CD4 + CD25 + regulatory T cells, dampens the immune response following challenge 268 . CD8 + T cells detect antigen in the context of MHC class i molecules and carry out direct cytotoxic reactions that kill infected or neoplastic cells 269 .",

The ligands for CD28, B71 and B72, are expressed on antigenpresenting cells and are upregulated when these cells encounter microorganisms that activate Tolllike receptors or other pathogen sensors 279, 280 . inhibitory molecules, including cytotoxic T lymphocyteassociated protein 4 (CtLa4) and programmed cell death 1 (PD1), are induced during immune responses and represent a 'checkpoint' to dampen T cell hyperactivation 281 (see Fig. 2 ). the polymorphic tCr signals through a complex of three sets of dimeric CD3 chains, \u03b5-\u03b4, \u03b3-\u03b4 and \u03b6-\u03b6 282 . the intracellular portions of the CD3 chains contain immunoreceptor tyrosinebased activation motifs that are phosphorylated by lymphocytespecific protein kinase (LCK), a srC family kinase 283 . at rest, the surface signalling protein CD45 exhibits phosphatase activity that blocks LCK function 284 . Following activation, CD45 removes an inhibitory phosphate on LCK, permitting phosphorylation of \u03b6 chainassociated protein kinase 70 (ZAP70), a SYK kinase family member that binds to immunoreceptor tyrosinebased activation motifs in the CD3 \u03b6chain and recruits the linker for activation of T cells (LAT) and phospholipase C\u03b31 (PLC\u03b3) 285 . With ample costimulation, downstream signalling affects calcium release, the activation of the GTPase RAS and transcriptional reprogramming essential for activated T cell function 286 .",

First, the effector T cell population can contract through apoptosis as the immune response resolves (cytokine withdrawal) or following repeated highdose stimulation (restimulationinduced cell death) [287] [288] [289] . T cells can also exhibit an exhausted phenotype induced by repeated lowdose and lowaffinity stimulation, as seen in chronic infections and neoplastic processes 88 . Lastly, a subset of these effector cells are involved in longterm immunological memory. Memory T cells are primed to react more vigorously to the same antigen during a subsequent encounter, making them critical mediators of immune recall responses to pathogens and tumours 290 . Leveraging the power of technological advances in molecular biology, recent singlecell RNA sequencing and epigenomic studies have provided additional molecular insight into T cell fates and the corresponding features of immunotherapyresponsive T cells. These studies collectively implicate that complex transcriptomic, epigenomic and clonotypic changes of tumourinfiltrating T cells determine the success of immunotherapy 291-294 . beigelike anchor protein (LRBA) 13 . The sequence simi larity between CTLA4 and CD28 is highest within their extracellular binding domain and they therefore bind to the same ligands, called B71 (also known as CD80) and B72 (also known as CD86), which are expressed by antigen-presenting cells (APCs; Box 1). However, CTLA4 has greater affinity and avidity than CD28 for B7 ligands, representing a key difference in their biology [14] [15] [16] .",

T cell receptor (TCR) signalling studies unequivocally demonstrated that CTLA4 inhib its T cell activation and proliferation 12, 17, 18 . The negative tolerogenic role of CTLA4 was also evident in vivo, because Ctla4knockout mice developed a character istic T cellmediated lymphoproliferative autoimmune disease 19 . The absence of Ctla4 was sufficient to cause this phenotype, as treatment with an engineered solu ble version of a CTLA4:Fc fusion protein (CTLA4ig) and genetic crosses to B7deficient mice ameliorated dis ease 20, 21 . The autoimmune lymphoproliferative disorder caused by Ctla4 loss depends on the activity of CD28 because mutation of an LCKbinding carboxyterminal proline motif in the intracellular tail of CD28 abrogates disease in mouse models 22 .

Resting T cells become activated after stimulation by cognate antigen in the context of an antigen-presenting cell and co-stimulatory signals. Activated T cells produce and consume proliferative/survival cytokines, for example, IL-2, IL-4 and IL-7 , and begin to expand in number. If CD4 + CD25 + regulatory T (T reg ) cells are present, they can deprive the cycling T cells of proliferative/survival cytokines, especially IL-2, causing them to undergo apoptosis. Once cells are proliferating rapidly , they have different fates depending on their environment. If they receive acute strong antigenic stimulation, especially if it is encountered repeatedly , the cells will undergo restimulation-induced cell death. By contrast, if they receive chronic weak antigenic stimulation, the cells will survive but become reprogrammed into a specific unresponsive transcriptional state known as 'T cell exhaustion'. Finally , as the antigen and cytokine stimulation diminishes as the immune response wanes, usually once the pathogen has been cleared, cytokine withdrawal can occur passively to contract the expanded population of antigen-specific T cells. A small fraction of cells will be reprogrammed to enter a 'memory' phenotype, and this differentiation step is facilitated by IL-7 and IL-15. Memory T cells will continue to persist in the immune system and form the basis of anamnestic responses. In these regulatory processes, T cell death usually takes the form of apoptosis.",

Lastly, phosphatases, including SH2 domaincontaining tyrosine phosphatase 2 (SHP2) and protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A), are recruited and inter act with the cytoplasmic tail of CTLA4, thereby contrib uting to its negative effect on T cell activation. SHP2 is an inhibitor of phosphorylation of the CD3 \u03b6subunit of the TCR and also inhibits phosphorylation of the adaptor protein linker of activated T cells (LAT) 30, 31 . PP2A is hypothesized to inhibit extracellular signalregulated kinase (ERK), a kinase that acts as a signalling protein downstream of the TCR 32 . However, there is significant debate about which of the molecules that associate with the cytoplasmic tail of CTLA4 are most important for inhibiting T cell activity. Nevertheless, these inhibitory signals reduce the activation of transcription factors, such as activator protein 1 (AP1), nuclear factor\u03baB (NF\u03baB) and nuclear factor of activated T cells (NFAT), which reprogrammes T cells towards an anergic fate 29, 33 . Beyond its function in activated conventional T cells, CTLA4 expression on T reg cells is essential for the direct and indirect immunosuppressive activity of these cells 34, 35 . In vitro studies showed that CTLA4 was necessary for antiinflammatory cytokine release by T reg cells, which reduces polyclonal activation and proliferation of conventional T cells nearby 36, 37 . This result was confirmed in vivo by adoptive trans fer of CTLA4bearing T reg cells to prevent auto immunity induced by CTLA4deficient T cells that had been transferred to T cell and B celldeficient mice (Rag -/mice) 38, 39 . This treatment effect was nullified by antibodymediated neutralization of CTLA4 (reFS 38, 40, 41 ",

The inhibitory molecule cytotoxic T lymphocyte antigen 4 (CTLA4) is contained within intracellular vesicles in naive T cells, whereas it is constitutively expressed on the cell surface of CD4 + CD25 + regulatory T (T reg ) cells. Both classes of T cells express the co-stimulatory receptor CD28. Early after activation, generally in the lymphoid tissue, T cells are activated when their TCRs bind to their cognate antigen presented by APCs in conjunction with CD28 binding to B7-1/B7-2. Also, the activated T cells begin the process of displaying CTLA4 on the cell surface. T cells within peripheral tissues upregulate PD1 at the mRNA level early after activation. Late after activation, in lymphoid tissue, CTLA4 expressed by activated T cells binds to the B7-1 and B7-2 molecules on APCs, thereby preventing their binding to CD28 and promoting anergy by decreasing the T cell activation state. At the same time, constitutive expression of CTLA4 on T reg cells leads to trans-endocytosis of B7 ligands and interferes with the CD28 co-stimulatory ability of APCs. Late after activation in peripheral tissues, PD1 is further upregulated transcriptionally , leading to greater surface expression of programmed cell death 1 (PD1), which binds to its ligands PDL1 and PDL2, thereby promoting T cell exhaustion at sites of infection or when confronted with neoplasms.

In addition, a greater tumour burden corre lated with reduced tumour responses to antiCTLA4 treatment because larger tumours foster a more robust antiinflammatory tumour microenvironment 45, 49 . Despite the mixed success in preclinical studies, mAbs targeting CTLA4 proved effective in clinical trials of melanoma 45 . Ipilimumab, a human IgG1\u03ba antiCTLA4 mAb, gained FDA approval in 2011 for nonresectable stage III/IV melanoma following evi dence that it elicited potent tumour necrosis 54 and conferred a 3.6month shortterm survival benefit 55 . Longterm survival data demonstrated that 22% of patients with advanced melanoma treated with ipili mumab benefited from an additional 3 years or more of life 56 . Additional longterm studies have demonstrated the durability of this survival benefit, indicating the per sistence of antitumoural immunity following CTLA4 blockade 56,57 . Unfortunately, trial results in renal cell carcinoma 58 , nonsmallcell lung cancer 59 , smallcell lung cancer 60 and prostate cancer 61 have yielded less impressive effects than those seen in patients with melanoma. Tremelimumab, an IgG2 isotype form of a CTLA4blocking antibody, has yet to receive FDA approval as it did not increase survival in advanced melanoma 62 .

Human PD1 is expressed on T cells after TCR stimula tion and binds the B7 homologues PDL1 (also known as B7H1) and PDL2 (also known as B7DC), which are present constitutively on APCs and can be induced in nonhaematopoietic tissues by proinflammatory cytokines [74] [75] [76] . In this review, we refer to PD1 and its ligands as the 'PD1 axis' . The predominant role of the PD1 axis in the negative regulation of T cell activation became clear in 1999 when loss of the mouse PD1 ortho logue, Pdcd1, was found to cause autoimmunity in vivo. C57BL/6 mice lacking functional PD1 protein devel oped splenomegaly 77 . Ageing of these animals led to mild T cellmediated lupuslike glomerulonephritis and arthritis that was exacerbated by concurrent lpr muta tions in the Fas gene 78 . Characterization of additional mouse strains showed that Pdcd1 -/mice of the BALB/c strain exhibited cardiac inflammation leading to dilated cardiomyopathy 79 . By comparison, non-obese diabetic Pdcd1 -/mice had accelerated type 1 diabetes mellitus compared with their Pdcd1sufficient counterparts 80 .",

            "text": "The heterogeneous and lateonset autoimmune pheno types of Pdcd1 -/mice were distinct from Ctla4 -/ani mals, demonstrating that the PD1 axis regulates T cell biology differently to CTLA4. Spatially, CTLA4 exerts its regulatory effect predominantly within lymphoid organs, whereas PD1 tends towards tempering T cell activation locally within peripheral tissues 8 . Temporally, PD1 acts later in the course of T cell activation and fate determination. Overall, the PD1 axis plays a unique role in maintaining T cell tolerance to self. PD1 restrains immune responses primarily through inhibitory intracellular signalling in effector T cells and T reg cells 81 . The immunoreceptor tyrosine-based switch motif and the immunoreceptor tyrosine-based inhibitory motif of PD1 are phosphorylated and recruit the phosphatases SHP1 and SHP2, which dephosphorylate, and thereby inactivate, downstream effectors (that is, the CD3 \u03b6subunit and ZAP70) that are important for early T cell activation 76 and CD28 signalling 82 . Both CTLA4 and PD1 inhibit protein kinase B (PKB; also known as AKT) signalling to reduce glucose uptake and utiliza tion, the former through PP2A and the latter by reducing phosphoinositide 3kinase (PI3K) activity 83 . In contrast to CTLA4, the PD1 axis is essential for controlling the continued activation and proliferation of differentiated effectors; when PD1 engages its ligands, it can induce a state of T cell dysfunction called T cell exhaustion [84] [85] [86] . However, what determines whether PD1 mediates exhaustion or apoptosis in certain contexts is still an active area of research. One model suggests that the interaction between PI3K signalling and the mito chondrial B cell lymphomaextra large (BCLX L ) pro tein is a critical control point at which PD1mediated P13K inhibition reduces BCLX L and promotes apop tosis 25, 83 . Beyond regulating conventional T cells, PDL1 on APCs can control T reg cell differentiation and suppressive activity 87 . Unfortunately, tumour cells can exploit this mechanism by upregulating PD1 ligands to induce T cell exhaustion and generate a tumour microenvironment that facilitates tumour growth and invasion 88 .",

            "text": "www.nature.com/nri cytolysis and limit metastasis. Apart from a role of PD1 and its ligands in cancer treatment, multiple studies have also shown a negative correlation between human tumour expression of proteins involved in the PD1 axis and prognosis, indicating the utility of these proteins as potential biomarkers [95] [96] [97] . Following preclinical success, mAbs designed to counteract negative immunoregulation by the PD1 axis were developed and efficacy was shown in clinical tri als 98 . Development was initiated by Medarex (ultimately purchased by BristolMyers Squibb) in 2001 (reF. 99 ). In 2010, a phase I trial demonstrated that PD1 blockade was well tolerated and could promote antitumoural responses 100 . In 2014, the humanized and fully human antiPD1 mAbs pembrolizumab and nivolumab (both IgG4) became the first FDAapproved PD1targeted therapeutics for refractory and unresectable mela noma [101] [102] [103] [104] . In a headtohead comparison, pembroli zumab showed better 6month progressionfree survival than ipilimumab and conferred an overall survival ben efit 105, 106 . Clinical trials of nivolumab demonstrated an overall survival of 72.9% at 1 year compared with 42.1% survival in the group of patients treated with the chem otherapeutic dacarbazine 104 . In 2015, pembrolizumab was approved for the treatment of PDL1expressing nonsmallcell lung carcinoma because it provided a 4.3month increase in progressionfree survival com pared with platinumbased chemotherapeutics and was more effective than the chemotherapeutic pacli taxel 107, 108 . Increased PDL1 expression on the target tumour was associated with improved responses to PD1 axis blockade 109 . Additional successful clinical trials expanded the use of pembrolizumab to head and neck squamous cell carcinoma 110 , Hodgkin lymphoma 111 , urothelial carcinoma 112 , gastric/gastrooesophageal junc tion cancer 113 and tissueagnostic carcinoma with a high degree of microsatellite instability 114 . Following approval in tissueagnostic cancers with microsatellite instability, pembrolizumab became the first drug to be approved based on a molecular biomarker rather than by cancer site. However, the immunosuppressive microenviron ment of different tissues makes it hard to predict which patients will benefit 115, 116 . Similar to prembrolizumab, the use of nivolumab has since been extended to renal cell carcinoma 117 , head and neck squamous cell carcinoma 118 , urothelial carcinoma 119 , hepatocellular carcinoma 120 , Hodgkin lymphoma 121 and colorectal cancer with a high degree of microsatellite instability 122 . As was seen with antiCTLA4 therapy, longterm survival analyses demonstrate a longlasting immunemediated survival benefit following PD1 blockade 123 . However, the reason why PD1 blockade has demonstrated broader clinical utility than antiCTLA4 treatment has remained elusive. It is hypothesized that the difference may be because the PD1 axis is frequently coopted by tumours via ligand expression, whereas CTLA4 represents a broader immunoregulatory circuit 74, 124 . PDL1 is also targetable by specific antibodies that have proven effective treatments in multiple forms of cancer. In 2016, the first PDL1targeted humanized mAb, atezolizumab (an IgG4 antibody), was approved for treatment of urothelial carcinoma. An overall response rate of 15% was deemed statistically signifi cant based on historical control data, although responses were dependent on tumour PDL1 expression status 125 . Unfortunately, additional trial data have not demon strated that atezolizumab has clinical efficacy beyond the standard of care in urothelial carcinoma, although it is less toxic than traditional chemotherapy 126 . Indications have since expanded to include the treatment of non smallcell lung carcinoma 127 , triplenegative breast cancer 128 and smallcell lung cancer 129 . Additional antiPDL1 human mAbs, avelumab and durvalumab, entered the market in 2017 (reF. 98 ). Avelumab is used for the treatment of Merkel cell carcinoma 130 , urothe lial carcinoma 131 and advanced renal cell carcinoma 132 . Duvalumab is used for urothelial carcinoma 133 and nonsmallcell lung cancer 134 . Therefore, similar to PD1, blockade of PDL1 has been effective in difficulttotreat forms of cancer.",

Ctla4-and Pdcd1knockout mice provided a glimpse into the spectrum of autoimmune responses that occur in humans during immune check point blockade therapy 19, [77] [78] [79] . Human lossoffunction mutations in CTLA4 and its interacting regulatory pro tein, LRBA, also mirror the immunerelated side effects observed with antiCTLA4 therapy 13, 24 . On the basis of a metaanalysis of trial data sets, immunerelated adverse events are estimated to occur in 15-90% of patients 55 . More severe events requiring intervention are observed in 30% and 15% of patients treated with CTLA4 and PD1 axis inhibitors, respectively 136 . The common immune feature of toxicity is the loss of naive T cells and the accumulation of overactive memory T cells that invade peripheral organs, such as the gastrointestinal tract and lungs, and cause inflammatory damage. Keratinized and nonkeratinized mucosa appear to be the most susceptible, as approximately 68% and 40% of treated patients exhibit pruritis and mucositis, respectively 137, 138 . AntiCTLA4 therapy carries an increased risk of severe autoimmune complications compared with therapies targeting the PD1 axis, as was observed in knockout mice and in clinical studies 19, [77] [78] [79] [80] 139 . In addition, data from doseescalation trials support the claim that antiCTLA4 agents elicit dosedependent responses not seen with therapies targeted at the PD1 axis 107, 139 . Toxicities affecting the gastrointestinal tract and brain are more common with antiCTLA4 therapy, whereas patients treated with PD1 axistargeted therapies are at higher risk of hypothyroidism, hepatoxicity and pneumonitis 137 . However, as the number of indica tions treated with checkpoint blockade increases and more patients are treated, rarer side effects in a wider spectrum of organs and heterogeneous responses have manifested 137 . For example, hyperprogression of disease has been observed in a minority of patients with vari ous tumour types treated with PD1 inhibitors [140] [141] [142] . Most recently, it was shown that the PD1 inhibitor nivolumab can lead to the rapid progression of disease in patients Nature reviews | Immunology with adult T cell leukaemia/lymphoma, providing evi dence for a role of tumourresident T reg cells in the patho genesis of this lymphoma 143 . Multiple immunerelated response criteria have been developed to better catego rize patient responses to checkpoint blockade. In addi tion, these criteria aim to distinguish progression from pseudoprogression, a phenomenon in which patients treated with CTLA4 or PD1 inhibitors experience a period of progression followed by rapid tumour clear ance 144, 145 . Overall, checkpoint blockade leads to auto immune toxicities with a therapyspecific pattern of organ involvement, as predicted by the phenotypes of animals genetically deficient for checkpoint molecules.",

Modified pHsensitive antibodies that do not interfere with LRBAmediated CTLA4 recycling were shown to limit adverse events and improve clinical outcomes in established tumours in mouse models, which may ulti mately broaden clinical utility 149, 150 . Additional research has focused on developing biomaterials for the localized administration of checkpoint inhibitors 151 .

ATC ther apy using tumourinfiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) for the treatment of metastatic melanoma was pioneered at the National Cancer Institute in the late 1980s 158 . Lymphocytes isolated from a cancer biopsy were greatly expanded with IL2 and then reinfused intra venously into the same patient with a large bolus of IL2. The objective response rate was 34%; however, the median duration of response was only 4 months and few patients experienced a complete response 159 . Later studies incorporating lymphodepletion before ATC therapy in 93 patients with metastatic melanoma were more successful, with complete tumour regression in 20 (22%) patients, 19 of whom were still in complete remission 3 years after treatment 160 . The screening and enriching for neoantigenspecific TILs, made possible by highthroughput technologies, recently demon strated promise in a patient with metastatic breast cancer 161 . In addition, knockdown of the gene encod ing cytokineinducible SH2containing protein (Cish), a negative regulator of TCR signalling, was shown to boost the antitumoural response of ATC therapy in mouse models 162 . However, in order for TILbased ATC therapy to elicit durable responses (Fig. 5) , effector T cells with antitumour activity must be present in the tumour, which is not the case for many cancer types 163 . Other innovative approaches to tweak T cell activity and pro liferation may allow for a greater palette of treatments to be developed.",

            "text": "Engineered lymphocytes for ATC. The challenges asso ciated with expanding tumourspecific T cells in vitro led to the development of TCRengineered lymphocytes (Fig. 5) . However, these cells are limited to responding to tumour antigens presented by the MHC (also known as human leukocyte antigen (HLA) in humans) rather than surface antigens on tumour cells 163 . However, synthetic chimeric antigen receptors (CARs) can bypass MHC restriction and direct specific cytotoxicity to a target molecule on the surface of the malignant cell. Isolated T cells from the patient (or allogeneic donor) are genet ically modified to express CARs and then expanded and infused into the patient. This overcomes the problem that tumour cells often downregulate MHC molecules, which leaves the cell unable to present antigen to con ventional T cells 164 . CARs comprise an antigenbinding domain, most often from the variable regions of anti bodies, linked to signalling domains of the TCR and various costimulatory molecules (Fig. 5) . Given the domain modularity of cell surface signalling proteins, mixes and matches of extracellular targeting domains and internal signal transduction domains can be assem bled using protein engineering. This offers many options to tailor CARs to specific tumours. The first generation of CAR T cells relied only on the CD3 \u03b6chain to simu late TCR signalling 165 , but this design was ineffective in clinical trials owing to limited T cell proliferation and cytokine production 166, 167 . Subsequent generations of CAR T cells have been engineered to include domains from CD28, CD40 ligand and other positive regulators of T cell activation to potentiate activation and cyto toxicity in vivo [168] [169] [170] [171] . An engineered singlechain PD1 blocker has also demonstrated similar enhanced effi cacy to secondgeneration CAR T cells with solely a CD28 domain 172 . Even though CAR T cells are typically engineered using retroviral transduction, recent work has used CRISPR-Cas9 technology. CRISPR-Cas9 can be used to edit the TCR germline sequence directly, which could lead to more uniform CAR T cell generation and, ultimately, better efficacy 173 . TILs are then infused into a patient who has undergone lymphodepletion to provide a niche for the transferred TILs to expand, act as effector cells and generate immunological memory. As the T cells were derived from the tumour, it is assumed that a good proportion can recognize tumour-associated antigens (TAAs) or neoantigens. b | The physiological T cell receptor (TCR) complex gains its specificity from polymorphic \u03b1-and \u03b2-glycoprotein chains that have an antigen-binding portion and a conserved domain that associate with and signal through a group of nonpolymorphic proteins, CD3 \u03b3, \u03b4, \u03b5 and \u03b6. Bioengineering of the TCR \u03b1-and \u03b2-glycoprotein antigen-binding domain (purple), while preserving the conserved domains (C\u03b1 and C\u03b2), allows for the development and expansion of T lymphocytes with specificity to tumour neoantigens. c | Originally , chimeric antigen receptors (CARs) were composed of an extracellular singlechain fragment of an antibody variable region coupled to a CD3 \u03b6-signalling domain. Poor expansion and functionality of these first-generation CARs led to the development of second and third-generation CARs containing intracellular modules from co-stimulatory molecules (CD28 and/or 4-1BB) that provide additional signals necessary to fully activate the T cell. Subsequent generations of CAR T cells contain further modifications to improve antitumour efficacy. For example, fourth-generation 'armoured' CAR T cells have been engineered to secrete pro-inflammatory cytokines, such as IL-12, to overcome immunosuppression in the tumour microenvironment. The chimeric cytokine receptor 4\u03b1\u03b2, comprising the ectodomain of IL-4R\u03b1 fused to the IL-2/IL-15R\u03b2 chain, signals in response to IL-4, an abundant cytokine in numerous tumour types.

CD22 is another anti gen commonly expressed by malignant cells in BALL and has shown promise as a target for CAR T cell therapy in a phase I trial 178 . Other targets, especially tumour neoantigens, are currently being investigated for haematological malignancies that do not express CD19, as well as for solid tumours 179, 180 .

A preclinical study recently identified another target antigen, GPRC5D, with comparable efficacy and toxic ity to BCMAtargeted CAR T cell therapy 183 .

Patients most commonly experience cytokine release syndrome (CRS) and neurotoxicity 200 . CRS results from the power ful activation and proliferation of CAR T cells in vivo and typically appears quickly after cell transfer. The symptoms are often mild and flulike but can also be severe and lifethreatening, involving hypotension, high fever, capillary leakage, coagulopathy and multi system organ failure. Serious neuro logical events can also occur, such as CAR T cellrelated encephalopathy syndrome, typically characterized by confusion and delirium, but sometimes also associated with sei zures and cerebral oedema 199 . Glucocorticoids are the firstline treatment for milder forms of CRS and CAR T cellrelated encephalopathy syndrome. Tocilizumab, a humanized antiIL6 antibody, is a highly effective secondline treatment for CRS caused by CAR T cell therapy 201 . Other side effects of CD19specific CAR T cell therapy include lymphopenia and hypogamma globulinaemia 202 , which can be effectively managed with intravenous immunoglobulin therapy, similar to the treatment that patients with primary B cell immuno deficiencies receive 203 . The mechanisms behind these side effects are unclear and further research may yield ways to avoid or minimize toxicity. Recent develop ment of a novel murine model of CRS demonstrated that it is not mediated by CAR T cellderived IL6 but rather by recipient macrophages that secrete IL6, IL1 and nitric oxide. Therefore, IL1 blockade repre sents a possible novel intervention in the armamen tarium against CRS 204 . Moreover, a clinical study of lowaffinity CD19specific CAR T cells demonstrated reduced toxicity and enhanced efficacy 205 . Additional efforts to reduce toxicity involve the engineering of CAR T cells with multiple receptor specificities 206 and reducing the halflife of cellular toxicity by using mRNAbased methods that allow for transient recep tor expression 207 or including suicide cassettes that can be activated by exogenous agents to clonally delete the infused cells 208 .",

Interestingly, most neoantigens induced cytokine responses from CD4 + T cells rather than CD8 + T cells, suggesting that neoantigens are selected for MHC class II binding 222, 223 . Other preclinical studies demonstrated effective CD4 + and CD8 + T cell responses to neoantigen vaccines in various cancer types [223] [224] [225] [226] [227] . However, recent preclinical work has also highlighted the nonoverlapping role of neoantigen responses mediated by CD4 + and CD8 + T cells 228 .",

An individual tumour can harbour thousands of somatic mutations and pre dicting which neoantigens can elicit strong antitumour responses remains an imperfect art. However, the cur rent methods, consisting of validating mRNA expres sion of the mutation in tumour cells and using software/ databases to predict peptide-MHC binding, have been surprisingly effective in clinical trials to date 229 . How ever, this success has been biased towards MHC class I specific neoantigens as prediction for MHC class II molecules presents unique challenges. For example, the increased diversity of MHC class II molecules and the structural nature of their open binding pocket make discerning a predictable binding motif difficult 233 . Taken together, these differences between MHC classes high light the particular need for new MHC class II predic tion algorithms. Other challenging factors to consider are the time and cost associated with developing bes poke vaccines. Currently, development and production of these vaccines takes approximately 4 months, and, although the downtime can be used to initiate other types of treat ment, shortening the time span to personalized treatment is critical. For rapidly growing or meta static tumours, months might matter. Ongoing efforts to improve design and manufacturing could shorten the production time to several weeks 229 .",

Nevertheless, it took many years of basic science discoveries and subsequent clinical translation to une quivocally demonstrate the power of modulating the immune system to treat cancer. Further research that investigates the regulation of T cells and other immune cells, for example APCs and natural killer cells, may allow us to enhance the power of this approach. In 'dif ficult to treat' tumours, the effect sizes observed in clin ical trials of checkpoint blockade agents, ATC transfer therapies and cancer vaccines have been far higher than the most effective chemotherapeutic agents. Although immunerelated adverse effects are common, these inno vative immunetargeting therapies are better tolerated than traditional chemotherapeutic agents. The burgeon ing field of cancer immunotherapy continues to grow as indications for currently approved therapies expand and the search for novel druggable targets continues. The cancer immunotherapy success stories we have recounted highlight the intrinsic connection between basic science research and clinical practice. They also illustrate how a benchtobedside approach, built upon a solid basic science foundation, can be successful in fighting one of humanity's most dreaded diseases.",

Blocking of the PD1 axis through the administration of an anti-PD1 (or anti-PDL1 or anti-PDL2) antibody prevents this inhibitory interaction and unleashes antitumoural T lymphocyte activity by promoting increased T cell activation and proliferation, by enhancing their effector functions and by supporting the formation of memory cells. Consequently , more T cells bind to tumour antigens presented on tumour cells by MHC molecules via their T cell receptors (TCRs). This ultimately leads to the release of cytolytic mediators, such as perforin and granzyme, causing enhanced tumour killing. APC, antigen-presenting cell. Adapted from \u00a92019 Fritz, J.
