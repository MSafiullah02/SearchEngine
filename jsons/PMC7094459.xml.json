Assuming the recovered individuals have temporary immunity, the classical susceptible-infectious-recovered (SIRS) model can be written as follows:(1.1)dSdt=b\u2212dS\u2212g(I)S+\u03b4R,dIdt=g(I)S\u2212(d+\u03bc)I,dRdt=\u03bcI\u2212(d+\u03b4)R, where b is the recruitment rate of the population, d is the natural death rate of the population, \u03bc is the natural recovery rate of the infective individuals, \u03b4 is the rate at which recovered individuals lose immunity and return to the susceptible class. g(I)S is called the incidence rate, and g(I) is a function to measure the infection force of a disease.",

The bilinear incidence rate (1.2) might be true when the number of the infective individuals I(t) is small, but it becomes unrealistic when I(t) is getting larger. Studying the data on the cholera epidemic spread in Bari, Italy, in 1973, Capasso et al.

            "text": "\n(b) Nonmonotone Incidence Rates with Psychological Effect. Though Capasso and Serio [6] described incidence functions taking into account psychological effect, but they did not give any specific function to describe such incidence. To model the effects of psychological factor, protection measures and intervention policies when a serious disease emerges, Xiao and Ruan [29] proposed the following specific incidence rate:(1.6)g(I)S=kIS1+\u03b1I2, where the incidence function g(I)=kI1+\u03b1I2 is nonmonotone when I\u22650 (see Fig. 1.1(b)). This implies that the contact rate and the infection probability are increasing when a new infectious disease emerges, since people have very little knowledge about the disease. However, when I is large and the disease becomes more serious, psychological factor leads people to implementing measures to control the spread of the disease. For example, in the outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), the aggressive measures and policies, such as border screening, mask wearing, quarantine, isolation, etc. were proved to be very effective in reducing the transmission. So the infection force decreases when the number of infected individuals becomes larger. Liu et al. [18] used (1.6) to describe the psychological effect toward avian influenza in the human population. In [29], Xiao and Ruan presented a global analysis for model (1.1) with nonmonotone incidence rate (1.6), and showed that either the number of infective individuals tends to zero as time evolves or the disease persists. Hence, model (1.1) with nonmonotone incidence rate (1.6) cannot exhibit complicated dynamics and bifurcations.",

Thus, a more reasonable incidence function g(I) may be one that first increases to a maximum when a new infectious disease emerges or an old infectious disease reemerges, then decreases due to psychological effect, and eventually tends to a saturation level due to crowding effect.

Then we havem>max\u2061{m1,m2}, where m1 and m2 are given in (3.9).\n(I) Firstly, we consider the discriminant of c0+c1m+c2m2=0, which is given by\u0394(p)=c12\u22124c0c2=\u03940+\u03941p+\u03942p2+\u03943p3+\u03944p4, where\u03940=n2>0,\u03941=8\u221218n+6n2+4n3,\u03942=\u221215+60n\u221269n2+18n3+6n4,\n\u03943=6\u221248n+104n2\u221284n3+18n4+4n5,\u03944=1+6n\u221233n2+52n3\u221233n4+6n5+n6. We consider the third derivative of \u0394(p) with respect to p, which is given by\u0394(3)(p)=6\u03943+24\u03944p. Because \u0394(3)(11\u2212n)=60(1\u2212n)3(1+n)>0, we can show that \u03944>0 when 0<n<1. Thus\u0394(3)(p)>0forp>11\u2212n. On the other hand, we have \u0394p\u2033(11\u2212n)=18(n\u22121)2>0, and so\u0394p\u2033(p)>0forp>11\u2212n. Similarly, we have \u0394p\u2032(11\u2212n)=0 and \u0394(11\u2212n)=0, which yield\u0394(p)>0forp>11\u2212n.\n\n(II) Secondly, we analyze the sign of m1\u2212m2, which is same asm12(p)=1+(2n+n\u22123)p+(n\u22121)2p2. By noticing 0<n<1 and using a simple analysis, we have2n+n\u22123<0,\u22122n+n\u221232(n\u22121)2\u221211\u2212n=(n\u22121)22(n\u22121)>0,m12(11\u2212n)=n\u22121n+1<0. Thus, we can see that m12(p)>0, m12(p)=0 and m12(p)<0 if and only if p>p\u204e, p=p\u204e and 11\u2212n<p<p\u204e, respectively, where p\u204e=3\u22122n\u2212n+5\u221212n1/2+6n+4n3/2\u22123n22(n\u22121)2\n(>11\u2212n).\n(III) Thirdly, we analyze the relationship between \u2212c12c2 and m1, m2. The sign of \u2212c12c2\u2212m1 is the same as that ofms1(p)=\u22124\u2212n+(9\u221211n\u22122n2)p+(\u22125+17n\u221211n2\u2212n3)p2\u22124n(n\u22121)2p3. The first derivative of ms1 with respect to p isms1\u2032(p)=9\u221211n\u22122n2+2(\u22125+17n\u221211n2\u2212n3)p\u221212n(n\u22121)2p2. Since 0<n<1 and p>11\u2212n, one can prove that ms1\u2032(p)<0. Moreover, we have ms1(11\u2212n)=0. Thus we have ms1(p)<0, i.e., m1>\u2212c12c2, when conditions (3.15) are satisfied.The sign of \u2212c12c2\u2212m2 is the same as that ofms2(p)=\u2212n+(\u22123+8n1/2\u22123n\u22122n2)p+(\u22121\u22123n+8n3/2\u22123n2\u2212n3)p2. Since 0<n<1, by a direct computation, we can show that\u22121\u22123n+8n3/2\u22123n2\u2212n3<0,\n\u2212\u22123+8n1/2\u22123n\u22122n22(\u22121\u22123n+8n3/2\u22123n2\u2212n3)\u221211\u2212n=5+2n+5n2(n2\u22121)(1+2n+6n+2n3/2+n2)<0, andms2(11\u2212n)=\u22124(1+n)2<0. It then follows that ms2(p)<0, i.e., m2>\u2212c12c2, when conditions (3.15) are satisfied.\n(IV) Finally, we show that c(m)=c0+c1m+c2m2>0 when conditions (3.15) are satisfied. When p\u2265p\u204e\n(>11\u2212n), we have m1\u2265m2 by the step (II), then m>max\u2061{m1,m2}=m1 and c(m)>c(m1) by the step (III). Moreover, we can show that c(m1)>0. In fact, the sign of c(m1) is the same as that ofcm1(p)=2+n+(\u22126+7n+n2)p+(3\u22129n+5n2+n3)p2+2n(n\u22121)2p3. By a direct computation with conditions in (3.15), we havecm1(11\u2212n)=n\u22121<0,cm1(p\u204e)=c1\u204e2(1\u2212n)(1+n)4, wherec1\u204e=7+(3+3n+5n+3n3/2+2n2)(1\u2212n)3(5+3n)\u2212n(3+2n+4n)\u2212n2(\u22125+n+2n).We can see that c1\u204e is monotonic decreasing for 0<n<1. Moreover, since c1\u204e(0)=7 and c1\u204e(1)=0, we have c1\u204e>0 (i.e., cm1(p\u204e)>0) when 0<n<1, and thus c(m1)(p)>0, i.e., c(m1)>0, when p>p\u204e.When 11\u2212n<p<p\u204e, we have m1<m2 by the step (II), then m>max\u2061{m1,m2}=m2 and c(m)>c(m2) by the step (III). Moreover, we can show that c(m2)>0. In fact, the sign of c(m2) is same ascm2(p)=\u22121\u22122n+(3+n\u22124n3/2)p\u22122n(\u22121+n)2(1+n+n)p2. By direct computation, we have cm2(11\u2212n)=2(1+n)2>0 and cm2(p\u204e)=cm1(p\u204e)>0. Then c(m2)(p)>0, i.e., c(m2)>0, when 11\u2212n<p<p\u204e.Summarizing the above results, we have shown that c0+c1m+c2m2>0 when conditions (3.15) are satisfied. \u25a1\n",

Thus, h(m2)>0 when 11\u2212n<p<p\u204e.Summarizing the above results, we have shown that h(m)>0 (i.e., 2+4np+m(np+p+1)>0) when conditions (3.15) are satisfied. \u25a1\n",

Setting a=aH yields the eigenvalues at the critical point as \u03bb\u00b1=\u00b1\u03c9ci, where\u03c9c=[p(1\u2212n)\u22121][q\u2212(p(1\u2212n)\u22121)]. In order to have \u03c9c>0, it needs(3.22)0<p(1\u2212n)\u22121<q, which in turn yields 1+m+n>0 from aH>0. It is obvious that we need the following condition:(3.23)0<n<1.\nTo simplify the analysis, we introduce two new parameters:(3.24)P=p(1\u2212n)\u22121,Q=q\u2212P\u27f9p=1+P1\u2212n,q=P+Q,(0<n<1). Thus, the conditions 0<p(1\u2212n)\u22121<q are equivalent to P>0,Q>0. Then, aH=P1+m+n>0 and \u03c9c is reduced to \u03c9c=PQ. Note that the condition q<pa=paH becomesP+Q<(1+P)(1+m+n)(1\u2212n)P\u27f90<Q<(1+P)(1+m+n)\u2212(1\u2212n)P2(1\u2212n)P.

Since v1 and v2 have the same sign of F1 and F2, respectively, we consider the polynomials F1 and F2.First, suppose that the two polynomial equations F1=F2=0 have solutions for P and Q and we study if the solutions satisfy the conditions in (3.25). Note that F1 is linear in Q, we solve Q from F1=0 to obtain(3.27)Q=(1+m+n)(1+P)[P(mn+m+4n)+2(1+m+n)](n\u22121)[P(mn2+m2+3mn+6n2\u22122n)+m2+4mn+3n2+2n\u22121], and then substitute it into F2 to getF2=6(n\u22121)(1+m+n)4(1+P)3P[P(mn+m+4n)+2(1+m+n)]2[P(mn2+m2+3mn+6n2\u22122n)+m2+4mn+3n2+2n\u22121]3(A0P2\u2212A1P+A2), whereA0=m3n2\u22123m3n+m2n2\u22122mn3+m3+m2n+24mn2+12n3\u22122mn+12n2,A1=(1+m+n)(2m2n+mn2+2m2\u22126mn\u221212n2+m\u221212n),A2=3(1+n\u2212m)(1+m+n)2. Note that the solutions of F2=0 come from the quadratic polynomial equation A0P2\u2212A1P+A2=0. Solving this polynomial equation yields two solutions:P\u00b1=12A0(A1\u00b1\u0394),\u0394=A12\u22124A0A2, and then we haveQ\u00b1=(1+m+n)(1+P\u00b1)[P\u00b1(mn+m+4n)+2(1+m+n)](n\u22121)[P\u00b1(mn2+m2+3mn+6n2\u22122n)+m2+4mn+3n2+2n\u22121]. To have real solutions for P\u00b1 and Q\u00b1, it requires \u0394>0. Summarizing the above results shows that if the two sets of solutions satisfy v1=v2=0, they must satisfy the conditions given in (3.25) as well as \u0394>0. Define\u03a9\u00b1={(m,n)|0<n<1,1+m+n>0,\u0394>0,P\u00b1>0,Q\u00b1>0,(1+P\u00b1)(1+m+n)\u2212(1\u2212n)P\u00b12>0}.It is clear that the conditions given in (3.25) must be in \u03a9\u00b1. We will show that the obtained solutions P\u00b1 and Q\u00b1 do not belong to \u03a9\u00b1, then P\u00b1 and Q\u00b1 do not satisfy conditions in (3.25), thus there are no feasible parameter values for v1=v2=0, and the best possibility is v1=0 but v2\u22600, which implies that the maximal number of limit cycles bifurcating from the Hopf critical point is two.To prove the result by combining geometric (graphic) and algebraic methods, first we consider the set \u03a9\u2212. Define the functions:C1=P\u2212,C2=Q\u2212,C3=(1+P\u2212)(1+m+n)\u2212(1\u2212n)P\u22122=0, then plot the curves \u0394=0 and Ck=0,k=1,2,3 on the m-n plane, and identify the regions on the boundary regime: 0<n<1,1+m+n>0, satisfying \u0394>0 and Ck>0,k=1,2,3. If these regions do not overlap, then no solutions exist; if these regions do overlap, we need to further check the last condition in (3.25), Q<Qmax.For the set \u03a9\u2212, we show the curves \u0394=0 and Ck=0,k=1,2,3, in Fig. 3.3\n(a) with the colors in red, blue, brown and green, respectively. Fig. 3.3(b) is a zoomed area near the m-axis. The region for \u0394<0 is inside the red loop, and \u0394>0 is outside the loop. Thus, we only need to consider the region outside the red loop. We use + or \u2212 to indicate Ck>0 or Ck<0. Fig. 3.3(c) is a zoomed area near the corner of (m,n)=(\u22122,1), showing that all three curves are tangent to the line 1+m+n=0 at the corner. This can be rigorously proved using an algebraic argument. Figs. 3.3(a), (b) and (c) clearly show that there are no regions with \u0394>0 and all three functions Ck>0,k=1,2,3. Thus, the set \u03a9\u2212 does not have feasible solutions satisfying v1=v2=0.Next, consider the set \u03a9+. We have a similar result, as shown in Fig. 3.4\n. Again, this set also does not have feasible solutions satisfying v1=v2=0.To this end, we have shown that under the restrictions on the parameters, as given in (3.25), it is not possible to have solutions such that v1=v2=0 and to have three limit cycles bifurcating from the equilibrium (x0,y0)=(1,1) due to Hopf bifurcation. Therefore, the next best choice is to have v1=0 and v2\u22600, and P can then be treated as a free parameter. The above proof implies that v2 must be kept the same sign for the feasible parameter values. Otherwise, if it can change sign, then it must have solutions for v2=0, which contradicts the above result. To determine whether the sign of v2 is positive or negative, we only need to choose a solution such that v1=0 and then calculate v2. For example, taking P=n=m=110, we obtainQ=359487299<(1+P)(1+m+n)\u2212(1\u2212n)P2(1\u2212n)P=70374172990, giving v1=0 andv2=8175332680651336418386743659728845703491966184311975452303564800000>0, implying that v2>0 for any parameter values which satisfy the conditions given in (3.25). Thus, the outer bifurcating limit cycle is always unstable and the inner one is stable, both enclose an unstable focus (1,1). The proof is complete. \u25a1\n",

In this paper, we considered the SIRS epidemic model (1.1) with a generalized nonmonotone and saturated incidence function g(I)=kI21+\u03b2I+\u03b1I2, which exhibits three different properties: (i) when \u03b2\u22650, g(I) is monotonic, which always increases and then tends to a saturated level k\u03b1 as I intends to infinite. (ii) When \u22122\u03b1<\u03b2<0, g(I) is nonmonotonic, which increases when I is small and decreases when I is large, and finally tends to a saturated level k\u03b1 as I tends to infinite (see Fig. 1.2), which can be used to describe the phenomenon that the infection force first increases to a maximum when a new infectious disease emerges, and then decreases due to psychological effect and eventually tends to a saturation level due to crowding effect. (iii) When \u03b2>\u22122\u03b1, g(I) has both properties of (i) and (ii), i.e., g(I) is first nonmonotonic and then monotonic when \u03b2 increases from negative to positive. In this paper, we performed qualitative and bifurcation analysis, and found that the model (1.1) with general incidence rate (1.8) has complicated dynamical behaviors and bifurcation phenomena. It has been shown that there exists a weak focus of multiplicity at most two and a cusp of codimension at most two for various parameter values, and the model undergoes saddle-node bifurcation, Bogdanov-Takens bifurcation of codimension two, Hopf bifurcation and degenerate Hopf bifurcation of codimension two as the parameter values vary. By considering a more general model, our results show that Bogdanov-Takens bifurcation of codimension higher than two cannot occur, which clarifies and corrects the corresponding results by Tang et al. [27]. Moreover, our results about degenerate Hopf bifurcation (i.e., Hopf bifurcation of codimension two) can also be seen as a complement of the results in Ruan and Wang [25]. We also used model (2.1) to simulate the reported human influenza data from 2004 to 2017 reported by the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention.",

However, it is difficult to measure the psychological effect. So can we give a quantitative description about the psychological effect with respect to variation of the parameters involved in the infectious diseases? In this paper, we presented a concrete critical value to measure the psychological effect. More specifically, we have shown that there exists a critical value \u03b1=\u03b10 for the psychological or inhibitory effect and two critical values k=k0,k1(k0<k1) for the infection rate such that: (i) when \u03b1>\u03b10, or \u03b1\u2264\u03b10 and k\u2264k0, the disease will die out for all positive initial populations; (ii) when \u03b1=\u03b10 and k0<k\u2264k1, the disease will die out for almost all positive initial populations; (iii) when \u03b1=\u03b10 and k>k1, the disease will persist in the form of a positive coexistent steady state for some positive initial populations; and (iv) when \u03b1<\u03b10 and k>k0, the disease will persist in the form of multiple positive periodic coexistent oscillations and coexistent steady states for some positive initial populations.",
