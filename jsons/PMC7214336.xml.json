In 1994 first virtual reality-based modelling language was first projected, and used for humanizing the virtual world to overcome the craving over headsets. There exists a vast range of applications offered by this technology, namely; medical training, video gaming, military purposes, etc. Moreover, the virtual reality is an imitation by utilizing the computer/communication devices beyond the boundaries. The majorly employed constituents for the development of virtual reality are the input tools, output devices, and the graphical interface software [1,2].",

The simulation-based teaching-learning concept further makes this tactic more practically feasible to explore more new applications of the real world. Based on the past practices made in the domain of medical-related learning, it is always suggested and advised to edify the physicians with the opted simulation contrivances and practices. Some successful, relevant practices attempted are; intrusive hemodynamic observing, ventilation handlings, medical education issues, etc. [7,8]. These practices ultimately make the working of medical practitioners improved and effective in terms of their working style and flexibility. In the healthcare sector, the training and learning practices based on proposed simulation-based techniques are further observed and suggested as benign, replicable, and economical too.",
