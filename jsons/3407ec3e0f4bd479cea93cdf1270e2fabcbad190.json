The analysis of codon usage may improve our understanding of the evolution and pathogenesis of Chlamydia and allow reengineering of target genes to improve their expression for gene therapy. Here, we analyzed the codon usage of C. muridarum, C. trachomatis (here indicating biovar trachoma and LGV), C. pneumoniae, and C. psittaci using the codon usage database and the CUSP (Create a codon usage table) program of EMBOSS (The European Molecular Biology Open Software Suite). The results show that the four genomes have similar codon usage patterns, with a strong bias towards the codons with A and T at the third codon position. Compared with Homo sapiens, the four chlamydial species show discordant seven or eight preferred codons. The ENC (effective number of codons used in a gene)-plot reveals that the genetic heterogeneity in Chlamydia is constrained by the G+C content, while translational selection and gene length exert relatively weaker influences. Moreover, mutational pressure appears to be the major determinant of the codon usage variation among the chlamydial genes. In addition, we compared the codon preferences of C. trachomatis with those of E. coli, yeast, adenovirus and Homo sapiens. There are 23 codons showing distinct usage differences between C. trachomatis and E. coli, 24 between C. trachomatis and adenovirus, 21 between C. trachomatis and Homo sapiens, but only six codons between C. trachomatis and yeast. Therefore, the yeast system may be more suitable for the expression of chlamydial genes. Finally, we compared the codon preferences of C. trachomatis with those of six eukaryotes, eight prokaryotes and 23 viruses. There is a strong positive correlation between the differences in coding GC content and the variations in codon bias (r=0.905, P<0.001). We conclude that the variation of codon bias between C. trachomatis and other organisms is much less influenced by phylogenetic lineage and primarily determined by the extent of disparities in GC content.",

C. trachomatis is the causative agent of trachoma, which leads to preventable blindness worldwide, and it also causes several sexually transmitted diseases, such as urethritis, cervicitis and salpingitis [5, 6] . C. pneumoniae, which causes pneumonia, sinusitis and bronchitis, has attracted great scientific attention because it has also been found to be associated with atherosclerosis, acute myocardial infarction and chronic neurological diseases [7] . Romero et al. [8] have reported that four factors (strand-specific mutational biases, replicational-transcriptional selection, the hydropathy of each encoded protein and the degree of amino acid conservation) are involved in the codon usage bias in C. trachomatis. However, it is not clear whether genetic and environmental factors affect codon usage in Chlamydia.",

If the genes have low codon usage bias, the translational selection factor does not appear to be important for gene expression. Genes with lower GC3 values also have lower ENC values, indicating a stronger codon bias. A large number of points lie near the solid curve on the left side of this distribution, suggesting that these genes are subject to GC compositional constraints. Statistically, the relationship between ENC and GC3 is significantly positive (P<0.001), suggesting that mutational bias may be the major determinant of codon usage variation among chlamydial genes. The genetic heterogeneity correlates positively with the A+T content at the third position, which is consistent with the preference for codons with T and/or A ending as discussed above.",

Codon usage bias is found to be related to different biological factors, such as tRNA abundance, strand-specific mutational bias, gene expression level, gene length, amino acid composition, protein structure, mRNA structure and GC composition [15] [16] [17] [18] . However, directional mutation pressure on DNA sequences and natural selection affecting gene translation are the two major factors that have been widely accepted to account for both interspecific codon usage variation and intragenomic codon usage variability. With regard to the codon usage variation among genes within the same organism, this phenomenon has been observed in a wide range of species. In some unicellular organisms, such as E. coli and Saccharomyces cerevisiae, highly expressed genes have a strong selective preference for the codons complementary to the most abundant tRNA species, whereas lowly expressed genes display more uniform codon usage patterns largely compatible with the mutational bias in the absence of translational selection [19, 20] . In mammals and birds, the diverse patterns of codon usage may arise from compositional constraints of the genomes [21-23].",

In the present study, we used the ENC-plot to analyze the factors affecting codon usage variation among genes and extended the analysis to other chlamydial species. Our analysis has reinforced the abovementioned findings. Here, genetic heterogeneity in the Chlamydia species is observed to be constrained by GC content, while the gene length has only a minor impact on the codon choice. In various species of Chlamydia, genetic heterogeneity seems to be the result of similar factors. In C. trachomatis, the major trend in codon choices is not as strong as in other species [8] , so it can be postulated that there may be several major factors which shape chlamydial gene codon usage. In addition to strand-specific mutational biases, GC3 may be another important factor. Certainly, illustrating all the factors which shape chlamydial codon usage variation is a complex issue. However, mutational pressure, not the selective forces acting at the translational level, may play an important role in determining the codon usage variation among chlamy-dial genes. All these findings that hold true for C. trachomatis as well as for other tested chlamydial species support the \"mutational bias-translational selection\" hypothesis.",

It can be inferred that codon usage variability among different species may not depend on their phylogenetic relationships, but on their coding GC content. Consequently, the coding GC content may be more useful in predicting the amino acid or nucleotide sequence rather than the phylogenetic reconstruction. Our conclusion is consistent with previous studies that were mostly focused on genome GC content and limited to the three domains of life (Bacteria, Archaea, and Eukarya). For example, Chen et al. have proposed that only two parameters, genome GC content and context-dependent nucleotide bias, effectively differentiate the genome-wide codon bias of 100 eubacterial and archaeal organisms [24] . Moreover, they found that genome GC content variation is the most important parameter differentiating codon bias between different organisms [24] . It has been reported that seven GC-rich microbial genomes belonging to different domains of life adopt similar codon usage patterns regardless of their phylogenetic lineages [25] . In the present study, we have examined the relationship between the coding GC content and cross-species disparities in codon usage. Since the whole genome contains coding regions and non-coding regions, coding GC content may presumably be a more accurate reflection of the codon usage bias than genome GC content. Most importantly, our analysis revealed that coding GC content is correlated with crossspecies disparities in codon usage not only in all three domains of life but in non-cellular microbes.",

Compared with human genomes, the four chlamydial genomes do not have the same preferred codons. Furthermore, the biased trend towards A and T coincides with high A+T content at silent sites in Chlamydia (the mean value is 70%). Since Chlamydia are AT-rich organisms, it is reasonable that A and/or T ending codons are predominant in their genomes. These findings suggest that it is still necessary to differentiate various chlamydial species-even biovars-when designing specific strategies for optimizing chlamydial codons even though there are significant similarities in the codon usage pattern among all tested Chlamydia species.",

This may serve as a guide for manipulating the expression of the targeted genes. Chlamydial genes optimizing with host-preferred codons are likely to improve the expression levels of the chlamydial genes in a given host. Our preliminary experiments have proved that the chlamydial major outer membrane protein (MOMP) gene optimized with human-preferred codon usage shows a higher level of expression in mammalian cells than the wildtype MOMP gene (data not shown). Thus, yeast and vaccinia virus expression systems may be better applied to the production of chlamydial proteins. We plan to use yeast and vaccinia virus expression systems to test our hypothesis. In summary, our work has provided a basic understanding of the evolution and pathogenesis of Chlamydia, with some new insights into the mechanisms for codon usage bias and vaccine development to prevent chlamydial diseases.
