A blood sample was collected from the cranial vena cava and submitted for a complete blood count (CBC) and plasma biochemistry.

Reverse transcriptase PCR was retrospectively submitted on formalin fixed paraffin embedded tissue, returning with a negative result for FRSCV and weak positive result for FRECV.
