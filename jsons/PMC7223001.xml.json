This disease caused by the protozoa in the genus Leishmania, and transmitted by the bite of an infected female sandfly. There are three main categories of leishmaniasis clinical manifestation viz. cutaneous (CL), visceral (VL), and mucocutaneous leishmaniasis (MCL). Typically, CL is caused by Old World Leishmania species such as Leishmania major, L. tropica, and L. aethiopica. The VL is caused by Leishmania donovani and L. infantum. The New World Leishmania species, L. braziliensis cause MCL [1]. However, L. donovani is responsible for both cutaneous and visceral leishmaniasis in Sri Lanka.",

Annually, a considerably high number of cutaneous leishmaniasis cases were reported from many districts in Sri Lanka. In the year 2018, The Epidemiology Unit reported 3271 leishmaniasis cases (Epidemiology Unit, Ministry of Health, 2019) [6]. Annually, the number of leishmaniasis patients is getting increased; therefore, more efficient diagnostic tools, treatment methods and effective prevention measures are indispensable. For this reason, many studies were conducted regarding leishmaniasis infections in Sri Lanka; however, some areas need more attention. Thus, in this review, we comprehensively discussed the studies carried out in Sri Lanka concerning leishmaniasis, which are publicly accessible as of 15th July 2019, and the knowledge gaps are highlighted where applicable.",

A study conducted on BALB/c mice has identified the subcutaneous immunization with the live L. donovani isolate causing CL in Sri Lanka was associated with significantly decreased liver parasite burden following challenge with the virulent Sri Lankan VL isolate [24]. This could indicate protective immunity against VL among humans in Sri Lanka since the resolution of cutaneous lesions is more common. This may be the reason for the low levels of VL observed in Sri Lanka. Furthermore, this study indicates this method of immunization can be useful in vaccine development efforts for visceral leishmaniasis worldwide [24].",

The incidence of leishmaniasis at high altitudes is very low compared to the cases identified from areas situated at low altitudes.

Unmonitored cattle breeding and living near paddy fields are associated with increased transmission of CL [29, 31, 55]. People in the dry and the intermediate climatic zones in Sri Lanka are mainly paddy farmers and are involved with the Chena cultivation during the daytime. These agricultural activities are, in many cases associated with irrigation systems and moisture-rich soil. These conditions facilitate favourable resting and breeding habitats for sand flies, thus increasing the risk of infection [56]. Uncovered areas in the body are more prone to sandfly bites [8]. Infected areas of the patients\u2019 body show a clear association with the clothing habits in the Sri Lankan society. Most of the farmers in the endemic areas wear clothes to cover only the lower part of the body [8]. Therefore, the exposure of sandfly bites to the upper part of the body is higher compared to the lower parts [57]. Underprivileged living conditions and house clustering also increase the risk of infection. Low usage of protective measures against insect bites is associated with increased infections [58].",

Also, the diagnosis of the patients suspected for VL and MCL should be confirmed by PCR and culture [61]. Negative skin slit smears are recommended to combine with PCR for confirmation [64]. Loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP) assay optimized under the local conditions can also be used as a diagnostic tool.

            "text": "Sandfly control measures should be carefully launched because biochemical assays revealed acetylcholinesterase and esterase-based insecticide resistance mechanisms in sandflies [72]. Consequently, insect control by organophosphorus and carbamate insecticides may have already been compromised [72]. Additionally, antimalarial campaigns in Sri Lanka used many insecticide sprays until 1960s. After elimination of malaria infections in the country, insecticide spraying activities were discontinued. This may also be a reason for the increased sandfly population and thus the gradual and silent increment in the infection [9]. Also, it could have triggered resistance mechanisms against insecticides. Therefore, a broad study concerning all the sandfly species that have a possible role in transmitting leishmaniasis and their resistance mechanisms is required before applying any sandfly control measures.",

Increasing the public awareness to change the clothing habits as well as to be aware of the insect bites will lower the leishmaniasis prevalence. A broad study should be carried out to identify the demographic characteristics and behaviours that would increase the risk of acquiring leishmaniasis. This information, in return, would facilitate the awareness programs that must be conducted island wide and mainly target the high-risk demographic groups. Also, developing the housing and sanitary conditions of the people who live in affected areas will reduce the infection.",

Prevalence of the leishmaniasis infections is reported from all the districts of the country, including the endemic areas: north-central, north-western and southern regions of Sri Lanka. Complex genetic and the population diversity of both the parasites and vectors make the control of this disease very difficult. Therefore, more studies are essential to be carried out to fill up the existing knowledge gaps emphasized in this review.
