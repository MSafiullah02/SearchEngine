Patients with abdominal pathology requiring urgent surgery could represent a potential cause of nosocomial spread of viral disease. Considering initial vague respiratory symptoms, the potential onset of respiratory distress can be underestimated from both medical and nursing staff. Giving the prolonged incubation period of the SARS-CoV-2 [3] , an initial negative result of the pharyngeal swab can turn into a positive result few days later. Moreover, the concomitance of a surgical complication can delay the real understanding of the clinical features. Our initial experience of a false negative result for the RNA SARS-CoV-2 test has led the whole surgical unit to treat an infected patient with [3] . In front of this new and little understood viral disease, our suggestion is that every patient undergoing surgery coming from high-risk areas should undergo RNA SARS-CoV-2 test before entering the operating room and should be treated at first as an infected patient. In the same way, all post-operative fevers should be kept in serious consideration and the pharyngeal swab test should be repeated several times unless a clinical explanation of the ongoing high temperature would be found. Since surgical stress could increase the viral load and make the healthy carrier more infectious, our suggestion is to treat every patients as a positive subject for RNA SARS-CoV-2 test to prevent the virus spread [4] .",
