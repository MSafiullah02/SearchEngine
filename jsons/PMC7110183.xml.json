Community-acquired pneumonia is defined as symptoms and signs, consistent with an acute lower respiratory tract infection and associated with new radiographic finding for which there is no other explanation, that develop before or within 48 h after presentation to the hospital. Once CoV-HKU1 was detected in NPAs, hospital records, laboratory results (including direct antigen detection, by immunofluorescence, of influenza A and B viruses, parainfluenza viruses 1\u20133, respiratory syncytial virus [RSV], and adenovirus [21]), and chest radiographs of the corresponding patients were analyzed by 2 infectious-disease physicians. The RNA extracted from the NPAs was subjected to RT-PCR, for detection of influenza A virus and human metapneumovirus [4]. Available stored serum samples were subjected to serological assays, for detection of antibodies against Mycoplasma, Chlamydia, and Legionella species and SARS-CoV, by SERODIA-MYCO II (Fujirebio), Chlamydia pneumoniae MIF IgG (Focus Technologies), indirect immunofluorescence (MRL), and our recently developed ELISA, respectively [16]",

The median age of these patients was 71.5 years (range, 13\u201396 years). Seven were men, and 3 were women. Eight had underlying diseases, of whom 4 had underlying diseases of the respiratory tract. Four had recently traveled to southern China. Five were smokers. Clinically, the illness was not distinguishable from other community-acquired pneumonia illnesses. Fever, productive cough, and dyspnea were common symptoms at presentation. Upper respiratory tract symptoms were present in only 2 patients (patients 1 and 5). One patient (patient 7) had loose-stool diarrhea. Oxygen saturation levels on room air on admission were <95% in 2 patients. Airspace shadows were observed in the right lungs of 6 patients and in the left lungs of 6 patients. The upper, middle, and lower zones were affected in 2, 4, and 9 patients, respectively. All patients, except patient 10, had normal platelet counts and normal results of liver and renal function tests. Bacterial or mycobacterial pathogens were not detected in any of the sputum samples from the patients. Results of direct antigen testing for influenza A and B viruses, parainfluenza viruses 1\u20133, RSV, and adenovirus and of RT-PCR for influenza A virus and metapneumovirus were negative for all NPAs. Results of testing for antibodies against Mycoplasma pneumoniae, C. pneumoniae, Chlamydia psittaci, Legionella pneumophila and SARS-CoV were negative for all 6 patients (patients 1, 4, 5, 6, 8, and 9) from whom serum samples were available. Of these 6 patients, all had a 4-fold increase in IgG titer (patients 4, 5, and 6) and/or the presence of IgM against CoV-HKU1 (patients 1, 5, 8, and 9). Compared with age- and sex-matched controls with non\u2013CoV-HKU1\u2013associated pneumonia, patients with CoV-HKU1\u2013associated pneumonia had no epidemiological, clinical, hematological, serum biochemical, or radiological risk factors identified (table 3).

The phylogenetic trees and nonsynonymous mutations and the corresponding amino acid changes are shown in figure 3. For the S gene, there were 317 and 306 nt positions with synonymous and nonsynonymous mutations, respectively (figure 3B); 72% and 28% of the nonsynonymous mutations were in the putative S1 and S2, respectively (figure 4). For the N gene, there were 42 and 53 nt positions with synonymous and nonsynonymous mutations, respectively (figure 3C). The nucleotide sequences of 7 of the 9 S or N genes showed similar sequences (genotype A), and those of the other 2 genes also showed similar sequences (genotype B) (figure 3B and 3C). For the CoV-HKU1 specimen from patient 1, 2 peaks (T and C) were consistently observed at nt 1300 of the N gene, suggesting the presence of a quasi species (figure 3C).

The nucleotide sequences of the pol genes in the 7 CoV-HKU1 specimens of genotype A were also clustered together (figure 3A). Interestingly, the 7 CoV-HKU1 specimens of genotype A were from 7 patients with underlying diseases, and the 2 specimens of genotype B were from the 2 patients without underlying diseases (table 2). Furthermore, multiple alignments of the nucleotide sequences of the pol genes from the 9 CoV-HKU1 specimens and those from the HCoV-OC43, HCoV-229E, HCoV-NL63, and SARS-CoV supported the notion that the primers used in the present study were specific for CoV-HKU1",

Since the SARS epidemic in 2003, we have started to prospectively collect NPAs from patients with community-acquired pneumonia and store the extracted RNA, so that, when a novel virus is discovered, the epidemiological and, hence, the clinical, laboratory, and radiological features of the disease can be studied in a timely manner. In January 2004, we discovered a novel coronavirus, CoV-HKU1, from a patient with community-acquired pneumonia [19]. The RNA extracted from prospectively collected NPAs was immediately retrieved, and the presence of CoV-HKU1 was investigated. Ten of the 418 NPAs were positive for CoV-HKU1, giving an incidence of 2.4%. The presence of CoV-HKU1 in these specimens was genuine\u2014that is, it was not due to contamination\u2014since amplification and sequencing of multiple genes (pol S, and N) of CoV-HKU1 indicated the presence of CoV-HKU1 with different nucleotide sequences from the different patients. Moreover, the clinical significance of CoV-HKU1 was confirmed by the presence of a specific antibody response in all 6 patients from whom serum samples were available. The antibody response in these patients was unlikely to be the result of cross-reaction with other known human coronaviruses, since none of the 20 serum samples obtained from patients with HCoV-OC43 infections or SARS-CoV pneumonia had positive results in the recombinant N ELISA (authors\u2019 unpublished data). Further studies on detection of CoV-HKU1 in NPAs from healthy individuals will determine whether asymptomatic shedding of CoV-HKU1 occurs",

Similar to other human coronavirus infections, cases of CoV-HKU1\u2013associated pneumonia occurred during winter and spring. Most patients with CoV-HKU1\u2013associated pneumonia were old (80% were >65 years old) and had major underlying diseases, especially those of the respiratory and cardiovascular systems. To study the phylogeny and relationships among the 10 CoV-HKU1 specimens, we sequenced the pol S, and N genes from the 9 CoV-HKU1 specimens that contained adequate amounts of RNA. Combined with the data on partial sequencing of the pol genes from the 10 CoV-HKU1 specimens (figure 1), results showed that, unlike the epidemiological profile of SARS-CoV, the 10 CoV-HKU1 specimens were not clonal, and the topology of the phylogenetic trees did not follow the pattern of a clonal outbreak (figure 3). Interestingly, the phylogenetic trees constructed using the sequences of both the S and N genes showed that CoV-HKU1 of genotype B was detected in NPAs from with 2 patients without underlying diseases, but CoV-HKU1 of genotype A was detected in NPAs from patients with underlying diseases (figure 3B and 3C). Sequencing of more CoV-HKU1 specimens may reveal the presence of genotypes or clades of CoV-HKU1 with differential virulence",

SARS-CoV pneumonia is often described as a biphasic disease, with the first phase due to cell lysis as a result of viral replication and the second phase due to immunopathological damage [4, 12]. On the other hand, all 10 patients with CoV-HKU1\u2013associated pneumonia showed the pattern of a monophasic disease. Although dyspnea was present in one-half of the patients with CoV-HKU1\u2013associated pneumonia at presentation, compared with only \u223c20% of patients with SARS-CoV pneumonia at presentation [4], patients with CoV-HKU1\u2013associated pneumonia often recovered quickly, but patients with SARS-CoV pneumonia deteriorated after 7\u201310 days [4, 12]. For the 8 patients who recovered, the median duration of hospitalization was only 5.5 days. This rapid recovery of patients with CoV-HKU1\u2013associated pneumonia could be related to the rapid control of the virus by the immune system. This is in line with the results of our previous study, which showed that the index patient with CoV-HKU1\u2013associated pneumonia had his peak viral load at around day 3 after the onset of illness [19]. Moreover, only 1 of the patients had extrapulmonary symptoms, and all available extrapulmonary specimens (stool, urine, and serum) were negative, by RT-PCR, for CoV-HKU1 (authors\u2019 unpublished data). On the other hand, for SARS-CoV pneumonia, patients usually had their peak viral loads 7\u201310 days after onset of illness [12]. Furthermore, the virus can be readily detected in extrapulmonary specimens, in which the viral loads correlated with the manifestations in the corresponding systems [22]. These findings imply that the virus was not well controlled by the immune system during the initial phase of the illness",

As in most cases of pneumonia, extensive involvement in the lungs will result in poor gaseous exchange and, hence, hypoxia and eventually death. The lower hemoglobin concentrations, monocyte counts, and serum albumin levels could represent poorer premorbid states and narrower margins to fight against infections. Both patients who died had underlying diabetes mellitus, malignancy (gastric lymphoma in one and prostate carcinoma in the other), and cardiovascular disease (old myocardial infarction in one and cerebrovascular accident in the other)",
