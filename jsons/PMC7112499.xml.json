            "text": "Stem cells are of great potential in molecular biology research and regenerative medicine [1]. Their defining characteristics include the potential for proliferation and differentiation into various cell types. Recently, Ling et al. discovered a rare subpopulation of pulmonary cells at bronchoalveolar junctions of lung tissues, exhibiting slow cycling and Octamer-4 (Oct-4+) expressing [2]. Oct-4, a member of the family of POU-domain transcription factors, is an important regulator of self-renewal in pluripotent embryonic stem cells. The cells have been revealed as lung stem cells that form epithelial colonies in a serum-free culture and are able to differentiate into type I and II pneumocytes. In addition, they are prone to infection of the severe acute respiratory syndrome-associated coronavirus (SARS-CoV) [2], [3]. These findings are promising in drug screening, tissue engineering and functional genomics. Therefore, a robust and consistent cell culture system should be established to provide moderate to large numbers of cells on a routine basis [4], [5], [6], [7]. Ling et al.\u2019s earlier screening has determined that thin films of type I collagen on the tissue culture polystyrene (TCPS) plates is most effective in forming high density colony cells [2]. However, the interactions of lung stem cells with their microenvironment remain obscure and need to be elucidated.",

            "text": "Type I collagen is a long, fibrous structural protein, found in all multi-cellular animals as a major protein in extracellular matrix (ECM). A collagen monomer consists of three left-handed helices which arrange to an extended superhelix with roughly 1.5 nm in diameter and 300 nm in length. The monomers can spontaneously self-assemble in vivo and in vitro into fibrils with a periodicity of 67 nm, ranging 10\u2013500 nm wide and up to several microns long. The spatial distribution and aggregation states of collagens have found to mediate the cellular signaling and development, through integrins recognitions [8], [9]. For example, the fibrillar structures of type I collagen have led to distinctive changes in gene expression, population, and morphological profiles of cultured smooth muscle cells (SMCs) [10], [11], [12], [13]. The heat-denatured type I collagen (denatured collagen), whose ordered three-dimensional structure is destroyed [14], promotes SMC cellular proliferation and spreading [15], while native type I collagen (native collagen) inhibits its growth [10], [15]. Further mechanistic study suggested that native collagen suppresses cyclin E-associated kinase and cyclin-dependent kinase 2 (Cdk2) phosphorylation while increasing levels of the Cdk2 inhibitors p27Kip1 and p21Cip1/waf1. As a result, proliferation of SMCs is arrested in the G1 phase of the cycle [10].",

It is therefore advantageous to engineer collagen substratums with distinct nanostructures in order to understand the effects to the stromal cells and, consequently, the pulmonary stem cell formation in the stem cell\u2013stromal cell co-culture. By adopting the previously developed methods with minor adjustment [12], both native and heat-acid denatured collagen thin films were readily prepared under various collagen solution concentrations. We have characterized the surface thin film morphology, the fibrillar formation, and the film thickness with atomic force microscopy (AFM), and surface profiler. Moreover, the cultivation of pre-sorted colony cells allowed us to observe the exclusive interaction between colony cells and type I collagen films. The correlation among stem cells, stromal cells and biomaterials is revealed by monitoring the number and size of colonies and performing immunohistochemical staining for Oct-4 and \u03b1-smooth muscle actin.",

The cells were incubated in a polyclonal goat CXCR4 antibody (10 \u03bcg/ml, Abcam, Cambridge, UK) for 30 min at 4 \u00b0C and then washed with PBS, 3% fetal bovine serum (FBS). Thereafter, the cells were incubated with a Cy5-conjugated donkey anti-goat secondary antibody (7.5 \u03bcg/ml, Chemicon, Temecula, CA) for 30 min at 4 \u00b0C and then washed with PBS, 3% FBS. For the second staining, the cells were incubated with a monoclonal R-Phycoerythrin (R-PE)-conjugated hamster anti-mouse (ICAM-1) CD54 antibody (4 \u03bcg/ml, BD Biosciences) for 30 min at 4 \u00b0C and then washed with PBS, 3% FBS. They were then stained with propidium iodide (PI) (1 \u03bcg/ml, Sigma\u2013Aldrich) to allow exclusion of nonviable cells. The pulmonary stem cells were sorted on a FACS-Vantage-SE flow cytometry system (BD). The sorted stem cells were re-seeded in DMEM medium containing 10% FBS (Sigma\u2013Aldrich) and 1% ITS, and MCDB-201 medium containing 1% ITS and 1 ng/ml EGF, respectively. The density was 5 \u00d7 104 cells/well for 12-well plates, which were pre-coated and air-dried with native and denatured collagen, (both at a concentration of 3.88 mg/ml), for each culture medium.",

The average thickness of collagen films on TCPS increased exponentially with the initial concentrations (Fig. 1\nA). Native collagen films, however, were roughly twice as thick as denatured films with identical initial concentrations. For example, the thicknesses of samples of collagen (native, 3.88 mg/ml) and collagen (denatured, 3.88 mg/ml) were 226 nm and 100 nm, respectively. Collagen (native, 1.55 mg/ml) and (denatured, 1.55 mg/ml) were 24 nm and 14 nm, respectively. This difference can be attributed by the changes in physical properties of collagen solutions, as the polymerized native collagen solution conceivably is more viscous and less soluble, leading to porous structures in the films, than the denatured one thus precipitating thicker films. Due to the surface roughness of TCPS (in the order of 1\u201310 nm), as the initial concentrations are below 0.1 mg/ml in native and 0.25 mg/ml in denatured collagen solutions, the resulting film thicknesses cannot be measured accurately. In these diluted samples, existence of collagen molecules at surfaces was imaged by AFM.",

In the film with low native collagen concentration, i.e. 0.62 mg/ml, fibrillar collagen did not distribute uniformly on the TCPS, and supramolecular collagen was not observed (Fig. 1B (i)). As the initial concentration was increased to 1.55 mg/ml, fibrillar collagen of \u223c200 nm in diameter appeared, and supramolecular collagen (approximately 1\u20132 \u03bcm in diameter, black arrow in Fig. 1B (ii)) was observed to be formed by the twists of fibrils. With initial collagen solution at 3.88 mg/ml, the film was covered with supramolecules of adsorbed collagen (Fig. 1B (iii)). The thicker fibrillar structure is also confirmed by the Z -scale of 300 nm, compared with that of 100 nm for the other collagen films (0.62 mg/ml in Fig. 1B (i) and 1.55 mg/ml in Fig. 1B (ii)).

First, the number of colonies on each sample was counted over a fixed area of 78.5 mm2. Secondly, the colonies on TCPS were grouped into three categories: fewer than 25 cells (bars in red), 25\u2013100 cells (bars in green), and 100\u2013250 cells per colony (bars in blue). Thirdly, to estimate the total stem cell counts in each sample, we derived an approximate value of individual total colony cell number from a weighted mathematical method. The median of each category, Ni, was estimated as the weighted value, e.g. Ni = 175 for category of 100\u2013250; Ni = 62.5 for category of 25\u2013100; Ni = 12.5 for category of <25. The total cell number of each category, Nt, was obtained from multiplying Ni by the colony number, Ci, in that category as Nt = Ni \u00d7 Ci. The sums of the weighted Nt values of three categories for each sample are shown in Fig. 3A with the numbers indicated on the right-side y-axis. For the native collagen film samples, there was a rapid decrease in both colony numbers and sizes when the initial collagen solutions increased from 0.04 mg/ml to 3.88 mg/ml. However, for the denatured collagen samples, there was no dependence on the concentrations in stem cell colony counts (Fig. 3A). As comparing the colony size and number of colony cells cultured on TCPS without collagen coating, we observed the promotion of the stem cell growth resulting from the presence of collagen molecules. Phase contrast images of primary cell cultures on collagen films are presented in Fig. 3B. The flat and high spreading stromal cells surrounded the cluster of stem cells that slightly lose optical focus under microscope observation due to their round up shapes.",

Moreover, we examined stem cell morphologies under identical culture conditions. The shape and size of the individual colony cell appeared similar on native and denatured collagen and TCPS surfaces. All colony cells appeared to be spherical shapes that are not fully spread on surfaces, which is similar to the morphology found in other stem cells [19], [20].

In addition, the sorted colony cells were incubated in DMEM with 10% FBS (Fig. 5\nA and C) and in serum-free MCBD-201 medium (Fig. 5B and D). After incubation for 7 days, the sorted cells were immunostained with Oct-4 to examine the preservation of the stem cell function. In the serum-containing DMEM, sorted cells expressed the Oct-4 marker and cell population became independent of the underlying collagen nanostructures (Fig. 5A and C). In contrast, in the original serum-free MCDB-201, the self-renewal ability of sorted cells was restrained and cells underwent differentiation (Fig. 5B and D). Our observation showed that in the case of sorted colony cells, cell fate is determined by medium components as opposed to collagen nanostructures.",

Furthermore, the cells surrounding the epithelial colonies were stained positively for \u03b1-smooth muscle actins, which are considered as a marker of mesenchymal cells. In this study, we utilized the Oct-4 marker, a typical marker of pluripotency for both mouse and human embryonic stem cells [29] (Fig. 2) and \u03b1-smooth muscle actins (Fig. 4).

            "text": "A disease named idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis is known to cause distortion of alveolar architecture, progressive decline in lung function and finally death [30]. It was understood to be concurrent with fibroblast accumulation, excessive collagen deposition and matrix remodeling. Recent studies have implicated insulin-like growth factor-I (IGF-I) in stimulation of collagen production and down-regulation of collagenase production [31]. In the present study, we systematically altered collagen quantity and fibrillar structures to observe the influences on pulmonary stem cells, which can undergo terminal differentiation into alveolar type 2 and type 1-like pneumocytes [2]. Although we could not provide direct evidence regarding the role of pulmonary stem cells in the disease, it is convincing that ECM remodeling should sufficiently modulate the subsequent tissue repair events by regeneration of stem cells. While cells were confluent on the native collagen-coated TCPS plate, colony density and size were both highly dependent on collagen fiber quantity. In contrast, stem cell colony density and size were consistently abundant on the denatured collagen that is analogous to the matrix metalloproteinase-treated collagen in vivo [32] (Fig. 3A). One would think that cell responses might be affected by collagen film bulk thickness. However, from the set of statistical colony cell numbers on denatured collagen films (Fig. 3A), the colony cell population did not depend on thickness (Fig. 1A). Hence, the effect of thickness on colony formation could be eliminated in this experiment, and the nanostructures of topmost collagen films are the important criterion for primary cell activities. It is clear that the adhesion and self-renewal of colony cells can be restricted on the fibril-abundant collagen films. In the meantime, on the native collagen films consisting of filaments and supramolecules, stromal cells have low-spreading and disorganized cytoskeletal stress fibers (Fig. 4A). It is well known that integrins are responsible for the activation of growth-promoting signaling pathways as well as anchorage requirements, therefore cell survival and spreading are governed by integrin-mediated recognition sites [33], [34]. Keresztes and co-workers reported that the space distribution of the fibril-like collagen\u2019s recognition sites may interfere with the organization of the cell-surface receptors [35]. Additionally, the other studies have also shown that SMCs failed to thrive when cultured on polymerized fibrillar collagen, which reflects the regulation of Cdk2 inhibitors [10], [12], [13]. For these reasons, we hypothesize that stromal cells play a crucial role in stem cell colony development. Moreover, in the cultivation of pre-sorted colony cells without stromal cells, we found that while cell fate is unaffected by collagen film nanostructures but impacted by medium components. Therefore, serum should be an alternative to functions of stromal cell for colony cell self-renewal (Fig. 5A\u2013D). It is known that niche cells underlying a basement membrane signal to stem cells to regulate differentiation and division in vivo. Proliferation, differentiation and survival of distinct progenitor populations in the hematopoiesis were discovered to depend on interactions with neighboring cells [36], [37], [38], [39], [40]. Similarly, secreted factors from niche cells play an instructive role in the differentiation of neural crest stem cells [41]. Thus, in this study, by utilizing manipulated nanostructures of collagen films, we further reveal that the growth of Oct-4+ pulmonary epithelial colony cell population is arrested by the effects of the degree of collagen polymerization on adjacent mesenchymal stromal cells. These observations reflect that the ability of renewal of pulmonary epithelial stem cells may in turn be prohibited by the excessive production of collagen from fibroblasts as idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis arises in alveolae in vivo.",

            "text": "In this study, the correlation between pulmonary stem cells and their niches was examined by altering collagen thickness, nanostructures and medium conditions independently in both primary and pre-sorted colony cultures. Collectively, fibrillar collagen inhibits proliferation of pulmonary stem cells. This should be attributed to the regulating mechanisms through the interaction between the neighboring mesenchymal stromal cells and the surface nanostructured collagen films, rather than to the contact of stem cell with collagen surfaces and the bulk material properties in films. This is further evidenced by the fact that in a pre-sorted stem cell culture colony formation is independent on the textures of type I collagen, but only dependent on the presence of serum. This research is a step towards comprehending the relationship between the nanostructures of type I collagen and primary neonatal pulmonary cells, and provides insights into potential influences during collagen accumulation in vivo.",
