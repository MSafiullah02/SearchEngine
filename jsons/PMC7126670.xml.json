It is reported that CsA can regulate the level of CypA in both undifferentiated and cAMP-induced differentiated murine neuroblastoma (NB) cells in culture.6 When treated with CsA, the NB cell can partially differentiate into neurons, which implicates a role for CypA in neuronal differentiation.6 Therefore, CypA ligands might hold great potential for the treatment of nerve injuries and neurological disease.",

It is believed that the immunosuppressive action is exercised by the ternary complexes, namely the CsA/CypA complex inhibits the calcineurin (CN) activity, which plays a key role in the signal transduction pathway towards the T-cell activation. Inhibition of CN might prevent dephosphorylation of the cytosolic component of the transcription factor, nuclear factor of activated T cell (NFAT), and prevent its movement into the nucleus where it is critical for the production of immunosignalling cytokines, including interleukin 2, thus leading to the suppression of T-cell activation.8, 9, 10, 11\n",

            "text": "To gain further insight into the CypA/DC838 interaction model at the atomic level, the docking simulation on CypA/DC838 binding was carried out using human CypA crystal structure (PDB entry 1NMK) as the model. The binding pocket of CypA was fairly big and shallow, composed of residues Arg55, Phe60, Met61, Gln63, Gly72, Ala101, Asn102, Ala103, Gln111, Phe113, Trp121, Leu122 and His126. The molecular docking results indicate that DC838 binds into the active site groove of CypA similar to CsA.33 Different from the case of the full occupation by CsA, DC838 took only partly the binding pocket and might swing in the pocket. The DC838 binding model to CypA was shown in Figure 5\n. It is found that the carbamoyl forms three hydrogen bonds to CypA: the carbonyl O atom forms two hydrogen bonds with the N\u03b52atoms of Gln63 and Gln111, respectively, and the N atom hydrogen bonds to the carbonyl O atom of Asn102. The O atom of one furan ring forms a hydrogen bond with the \u2013N\u03b71\u2013H group of Arg55; and the other furan ring interacts with the benzene ring of Phe113 via \u03c0\u22ef\u03c0 stacking. The quinoxaline ring forms a \u2013NH\u22ef\u03c0 hydrogen bond with the \u2013N\u03b71\u2013H group of Arg55. Helekar ever demonstrated that Arg55 of CypA was a key determinant against the PPIase activity.36 DC838 showed its hydrophobic contacts with Arg55 of CypA. Therefore, the PPIase activity of CypA might be inhibited by the hydrophobic interaction from the inhibitor. In addition, DC838 formed stacking interactions with the only tryptophan residue Trp121 of CypA for contributing to the change of fluorescence intensity (data not shown).",

In vivo assays indicated that this compound inhibits mouse spleen cell proliferation induced by concanavalin A. By using SPR and fluorescence titration techniques, kinetic analyses of CypA/DC838 interactions were quantitatively performed. The measured IC50 value for DC838 is in good agreement with the SPR and fluorescence titration results, which suggests that they are powerful approaches for identifying CypA inhibitor. Molecular docking results elucidated the specific binding of DC838 to CypA at the atomic level. The current work should provide useful information in the discovery of immunosuppressor targeting CypA, and DC838 might be used as a lead compound for further research.",
