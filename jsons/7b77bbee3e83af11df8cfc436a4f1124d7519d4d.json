In this situation, perspectives to recognize and mitigate moral distress are necessary. Strategies such as identification the most vulnerable professionals as well as the senior experts, debriefing together about ethically challenging clinical cases, effective communication within the team, accurate guidelines to be followed, and flexibility to facilitate health workers leadership to develop their work efficiently, should help deal with such difficulties and gain moral comfort (11) . In this sense, clear and sensitive leadership, interdisciplinary collaboration and mutual support to achieve common goals are essential. Due to the high reported prevalence of psychological distress in quarantined health workers, institutional support for them is essential to facilitate their return to work and to provide psychological assistance if necessary (12) . The family-centered care model has been incorporated into neonatal units based on the ethics of care and scientific evidence that suggests that in order to promote correct neurodevelopment and achieve the best health outcomes of the family unit it is crucial to establish an environment that promotes healing. This model effectively encourages parent-infant bonding in order to improve the ability to provide health throughout development. The family and particularly parents, play an active role as primary caregivers of their child, and responsibility in making decisions is shared between health professionals and the families of infants. Being able to exercise this role of primary caregivers brings benefits in the emotional health of parents that have a positive impact on babies in the medium and long term (13) . In addition, promoting this task to parents will also support professional's well-being to better cope with the current pandemic scenario.",

Even though to date no viral load has been isolated in breast milk and there are no major reasons to avoid breastfeeding in the infants of infected mothers, recommendations for restriction are shared (10, 14) . To date, International guidelines advise that breastfeeding should continue, whether or not the lactating parent has SARS-CoV-2 infection, with appropriate precautions (18, 19) . Pasteurized donated milk (milk bank) is a crucial resource for intensive care infants whose mothers are unable to provide their own milk temporarily. Interruption of feeding with donated breast milk, particularly in very premature or very low birth weight infants, increases the risk of necrotizing enterocolitis in these children, hence it is considered a major health intervention in these patients. However, in the current situation, most potential donors have to stay home due to general confinement, and given the shortage of reserves, milk bank may need to be prioritized for preterm infants younger than 30 weeks of gestational age or weighing <1,500 g at birth whose mother cannot provide her own milk (20) . Strategies must be developed to maintain donations and overcome the difficulties of confinement over milk banks.",

Restrictions on families are especially relevant in the NICU as they cause emotional disturbance and may profoundly alter the bonding and relationship established with the baby if the resulting emotions continue over time. In this sense, it would be desirable to incorporate parents into contingency plan decisions, such as in the schedule of their presence at the neonatal unit. These compensatory strategies can help to reduce parental discomfort and to encourage parental bonding with the infant that leads to better results and provides some protection against the many challenges that arise during the infant's hospital stay and will influence later childhood outcome, particularly in premature babies (21) .",
