This multispecies probiotic has been specifically developed to prevent antibiotic-associated disturbances of the intestinal microbiota. The product has shown to reduce the incidence of diarrhoea [18, 19]. This multispecies probiotic has a recommended dosage of 5 g twice daily, with a total viable cell count of 1 \u00d7 1010 colony forming unit/day. This dosage is based on prior human studies in healthy volunteers and general surgery patients showing a health benefit without adverse reactions [18\u201322]. The multispecies probiotic has been used in several clinical studies in different populations, without any adverse effects. It is commercially available in several countries and no serious adverse effects have been reported [18, 21, 23]. This probiotic food supplement consists of the following nine probiotic bacterial strains: Bifidobacterium bifidum W23, Bifidobacterium lactis W51, Enterococcus faecium W54, Lactobacillus acidophilus W37, Lactobacillus acidophilus W55, Lactobacillus paracasei W20, Lactobacillus plantarum W62, Lactobacillus rhamnosus W71 and Lactobacillus salivarius W24. The product also contains maize starch, maltodextrin, fructo-oligosaccharides P6, maize dextrin P9, potassium chloride, hydrolysed rice protein, magnesium sulphate, amylase and manganese sulphate. A placebo will be used as a comparator. The placebo product is indistinguishable in colour, smell and taste from the active formulation, and will have the same composition but without the live bacteria, fructo-oligosaccharides and maize dextrin P9.",
