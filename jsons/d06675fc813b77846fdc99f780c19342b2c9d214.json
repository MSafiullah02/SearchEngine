            "text": "The novel coronavirus disease was identified as the cause of an outbreak of respiratory disease in China at the end of 2019. It then spread with enormous rapidity and by mid-March 2020 was declared a world pandemic. Gilles de la Tourette Syndrome (GTS) is a childhood-onset neurodevelopmental disorder with a worldwide prevalence of about 1% of the population. The clinical symptoms include multiple motor and one or more phonic (vocal) tics. Germane to this communication is that 85% of patients with GTS have associated psychiatric co-morbidities, many of which are being exacerbated in the current global health crisis. In addition, several symptoms of GTS may mimic COVID-19, such as a dry cough and sniffing (phonic tics), while other symptoms such as spitting, inappropriate touching of others and \"non-obscene socially inappropriate symptoms\" can potentially get patients with GTS into trouble with the law. We suggest that a clear explanation of the COVID-19 illness and GTS is important to enable colleagues of various specialities who tend to patients with GTS. It is important to acknowledge at the outset that the information available on the COVID-19 pandemic changes daily, including cases infected, deaths reported, and how various national health systems are planning and or coping or not. It is fair to say that having read the current medical and lay press we conclude that it is not easy to reassure our patients with absolute certainty. However, notwithstanding that, we hope our documentation is of some assistance.

However, certain types of coronaviruses can affect the lower airway, causing serious illnesses such as bronchitis or pneumonia. Coronaviruses have very large single stranded RNA genomes (approximately 26-32 KB). Coronavirus particles are surrounded by a fatty outer layer called an \"envelope\" and usually are spherical when visualised under an electron microscope, with a \"corona\" of club-shaped spikes on their surface (Wu et al., 2020). Most people become infected with coronaviruses at some point in their lives, but the majority of these are harmless. The novel coronavirus, which causes the COVID-19 illness, is different, and can be extremely serious.",

            "text": "The virus that causes COVID-19 is known as SARS-CoV-2 (Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Corona Virus 2). It appears to have emerged in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China. The viruses first inhabited animals such as bats and then \"jumped\" to humans: this occurred in China in late 2019, from whence it has spread worldwide (Zhu et al., 2020). Coronaviruses replicate their RNA genomes using enzymes called RNA-dependent RNA polymerases, which are prone to errors, but genomic analysis to date suggests that SARS-CoV-2 is mutating slowly, thus reducing the chance of it changing to become deadlier (Wu et al., 2020) . It is worth mentioning that since 2003, viral diseases have caused major pandemics. These include the coronaviruses, which have caused multiple major public health events that resulted in global pandemics such as severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS; or \"bat SARS\"), Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) and the current coronavirus disease (COVID-19) (Kandeel et al., 2020). In addition, with a growing threat to maternal-foetal health, the Zika viral illness began in 2009 with devastating consequences and continues to spread (Towers et al., 2018) . Finally, in some parts of the globe, cases of swine flu (H1N1 virus) are still on the rise such as in India, where in 2020 alone around 1500 cases have been reported to date, with 28 deaths in the period from 1 January to 1 March 2020.",

            "text": "COVID-19 can affect individuals of any ages and clinical symptoms may vary. The main recognised clinical features of COVID-19 include fever (52% of younger patient, 89% of older patients), cough (44% younger, 77% older; usually dry, but can be expectorant), fatigue or tiredness; more severe cases get pneumonia. In mild cases people may have only a runny nose or sore throat. Patients may also have gastro-intestinal symptoms such as nausea, diarrhoea and anorexia. It does appear that older people, on the whole, are more severely affected. Individuals with pre-existing co-morbid conditions also appear to be particularly at risk: these illnesses include hypertension, diabetes, cardiovascular disease, and malignancy ( Severity has been described in various ways. Patients with abnormal chest images are older, with a higher rate of pre-existing conditions, lower rate of exposure history, and a longer time between onset and confirmation than patients without pneumonia. In addition, patients with more severe symptoms have a higher rate of fever, expectorant cough and headache, lower lymphocytes, albumin and serum sodium, and a higher total bilirubin, c-reactive protein, creatine kinase and lactate dehydrogenase, (Zhang et al., 2020c). Muscle aches, headache, shortness of breath and nausea/vomiting are also associated with disease severity. Also, biomarkers such as lower lymphocyte levels in addition to raised leukocytes, D-dimer levels, procalcitonin and serum creatinine, as well as higher radiograph score at admission are predictive factors for a severe/critical subtype (Zhang et al., 2020c). Finally, it has been shown that elevated exhaustion levels and reduced functional diversity of T cells in peripheral blood may predict progression in COVID-19 patients (Zheng et al., 2020b). In the most severe cases, patients go into respiratory and multi-organ failure. It must be borne in mind, however, that mortality has also been reported in children, adolescents and young adults. Thus, it does appear that no one is immune or not at risk.",

However, we have chosen not to include a specific reference on neurologic complications of COVID-19. For now, we prefer to stick to the AAN resource centre link we provided since this is a rapidly moving field, and will likely provide a more panoramic view of the field. Also, it is at present unclear to what extent these complications are causally linked to COVID-19 or correlational, so care is warranted. Much of the stigma and social maladjustment associated with GTS resulting in exclusion, bullying and discrimination, can be largely caused by misperceptions of the disorder by teachers, peers and the wider community.

            "text": "As with anxiety -since confinement and quarantine are anxietytriggering in their own right -an increase in tic severity can be expected. Moreover, behavioural abnormalities will likely also be exacerbated. First comes ADHD, present in 50-70% of patients with GTS (Hirschtritt et al., 2015) . In particular, the hyperactive phenotype makes confinement and quarantine hard to bear as physical energy cannot be released. It is also likely that rage attacks/explosive outbursts, as well as oppositional behaviourwhich largely depend on the presence of comorbid ADHD (M\u00fcller-Vahl et al., 2020) -will put an increasing strain on families. Reducing screen time -a frequent trigger of explosive outbursts -follows a paradoxical injunction similar to hand washing since it is more difficult to enforce in conditions of confinement and quarantine, added to which comes reduced schooling time. Yet, this is a potential conflict for parents as allowing children and adolescents to use screens more abundantly than usual may be the only way to keep the peace for the time being. Nevertheless, even in instances where increased screen time cannot be avoided, it is still possible to ensure that the content of what is being watched is age appropriate, engaging/ interactive and meaningful. With regard to ADHD and impulsivity, following the rules (hygiene and social distancing) may be particularly difficult. Note that behavioural abnormalities related to ADHD not only concern children but also adults, especially maladaptive behaviours (Haddad et al., 2009) . Home schooling may further penalize children with learning disabilities, frequent in GTS. Lastly, a hallmark of GTS is individual variation.

Note that these behaviours can also fall into the risk-seeking/impulsive phenotype often present in patients with GTS (Wright et al.,  2012) . Furthermore, echolalia and echopraxia may lead patients with GTS to copy other people's coughing. In case of palilalia and palipraxia (repeating their last actions), a first 'real' cough may be repeated over and over again without any underlying respiratory need.",

Undoubtedly, this literature will grow over the upcoming months and years. As immune function may be altered (even though this does not necessarily mean diminished or compromised) in GTS, one may wonder whether our patients bear a special risk of sequelae. Intuition however dictates that this is highly unlikely as viral CNS infections have a higher probability to target people with neurodegenerative disease, or even causing it, as was the case after the Spanish influenza pandemic and resulting Encephalitis Lethargica (Hoffman & Vilensky, 2017). In neurodevelopmental disorders such as GTS -and this also holds true for its comorbidities which are based on circuit dysfunctions -it is, at present, hard to see how a viral infection, and more specifically SARS-CoV-2, could lead to lasting CNS sequelae specific to GTS (for an evolving online resource, see here). However, only time will tell.",

Similarly, spitting or forced touching etc. can be part of tic-related behaviours that may get the patient in trouble with the law. Hence awareness and appropriate support (e.g. the GTS patient may have to carry a card, informing authorities and other appropriate people about the condition) is important. Further, accurate identification and treatment of tics and comorbidities should continue as usual and according to established guidelines, if possible (Pringsheim et al., 2019). It is likely that medications will need to be increased probably transiently until the COVID-19 crisis resolves. That is obviously true for anti-tic medication as it is for psychostimulants (for ADHD) and selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (for anxiety and OCD). There are currently unprecedented challenges in healthcare delivery and some of the specialists who would normally give this advice in many countries may be unavailable for a time due to redeployment, potentially causing further stress to families. Also, CBT for tics (van de Griendt et al., 2013) should be maintained by videoconferencing whenever possible (Andr\u00e9n et al., 2019) . The same applies to supportive psychotherapy for those who suffer from anxiety, depression, and loneliness. Finally, telehealth will play an increasing role in the medical follow-up of patients with TS, likely beyond the end of the pandemic. It will be important to establish whether this type of care will be well accepted by patients and families alike.",

The authors navigate through the many uncertainties of the unfolding circumstances using the best available evidence as well as their own invaluable experience, according to the ancient motto 'scientia et conscientia'. I have little to say in terms of further improving this useful article. As the authors rightly point out, anxiety is a common comorbidity that needs to be addressed with particular care, in consideration of its recognized This is a nicely written paper by a group of renowned European Tourette experts about GTS in times of COVID-19. The authors discuss similarities of COVID-19 and tics in GTS and outline specific problems that may result from the pandemic for this group of patients. Finally, they give concrete suggestions how to advice and treat patients with GTS and their families during the pandemic. 1 to advice and treat patients with GTS and their families during the pandemic. I like this small paper and find it interesting to read, since it alerts us that the current pandemic may be much more challenging for patients with GTS compared to healthy people. I have some minor suggestions the authors may take into consideration to further improve the quality of this manuscript:The authors mix the name of the virus (SARS-CoV-2) and the name of the disease caused by this virus (COVID-19) . COVID-19 is simply the abbreviation of Coronavirus 2019. Therefore, Disease the authors should correct for example the heading \" Aetiology: COVID-19 (coronavirus)\". As far as I know, the correct spelling is \"SARS-CoV-2\" (not \"SARS-Cov-2\"). Also in Table 1 : \"Viral infection -Coronavirus 19\" please change in \"SARS-CoV-2\".The authors describe the different symptoms associated with COVID-19 including neurological complications. I suggest to include recent reports on meningitis/encephalitis (for example see:) . https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ijid.2020.03.062",
