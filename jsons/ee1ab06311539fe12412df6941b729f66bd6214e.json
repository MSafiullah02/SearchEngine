This technique directly addresses sets of keywords shared by publications, directly mapping the topics of the scientific literature from interactions of keywords (Hui and Fong, 2004; Wang et al., 2012) . Coword analysis is based on the assumption that key words compose an adequate description of the content of a paper.

Co-word analysis has been effective in mapping the strength of the associations between key words in textual data. Social network analysis applied to co-word analysis allows us to draw network graphs that illustrate the strongest associations between descriptors (Lanza and Svendsen, 2007) . For the analysis of co-words, we adopted the assumptions presented by Law and Whittaker (1992) : a) authors of scientific papers choose their technical terms carefully; b) different terms are used in the same paper because the author recognizes some association between the terms; c) if different authors recognize the same relation, that relation may be assumed to have some significance within the area of science concerned.",

For the second most productive institution, Victoria University of Wellington (New Zealand, n=34), the most frequent key words were World Wide Web (n=11), Internet (n=6) and search engines (n=5).

Figure 8 shows the key words most frequently associated with countries publishing more than 9 papers. A threshold of more than 4 occurrences was established. As seen in a previous work, of the 54 countries that contributed to the publication of papers, the United Sates ranked first with respect to scientific productivity (n=199). The most frequently used key words associated with this country were Internet (n=48), information retrieval (n=45), databases (n=33) and search engines (n=32). In second place for publishing the most papers, Taiwan (n=97) preferred Internet (n=26), World Wide Web (n=20), user acceptance (n=19) and technology acceptance model (n=18).

During those years, two key words prevailed: Internet and information retrieval, both of which relate primarily to libraries, information services, search engines, user studies and databases. In the second period (2005) (2006) (2007) (2008) (2009) , the network of co-words was expanded, some words occupying a central position from the first period, such as Internet and information retrieval, World Wide Web and search engines. World Wide Web is clearly associated with search engines, information retrieval and Internet. As seen, one of the leading novelties regarding research in the preceding decades is the significance of the World Wide Web, which draws numerous spheres of research together: computer applications, electronic media, electronic commerce, and information search and retrieval (Gonz\u00e1lez-Alcaide et al., 2008; Orduna-Malea et al., 2015) . This consolidation is quite understandable because of the major influence of the development of the Internet as a technological tool, effecting a profound change in activities connected with library and information sciences (D'Elia et al., 2002; Tsay, 2004) . One of the key words that is notable for not being a technical term in information science is trust, a term that is representative of the concern that the reliance on integrity, reliability and honesty have in the world of the Internet and the World Wide Web.",

We determined that using Web of Science was preferable to using Scopus or Google Scholar based on several previous works (Vandermeulen et al., 2011; Meho and Yang, 2007) . Second, conference proceedings were not included because the ideas presented in conferences are often republished in journals. However, it is possible that many of these papers were never published in refereed journals; therefore, such research was not analysed in our study. Third, because some records do not have assigned keywords, some topics may be underrepresented in our study. In addition, the quality of results from keyword analysis depends on a variety of factors, such as the quality of the keywords assigned by researchers and the accuracy with which these key words represent the content of the work. Some keywords may be too general, or authors may sometimes incorrectly emphasise topics that are not the most relevant in a research paper. General keywords may be useful in showing a rough overview of a scientific field but are less successful at representing detailed topics of a research area (Chen and Xiao, 2016) .",

Many areas, including the most-used key words, the network of cowords and primary topics associated with institutions and countries, have been discussed. On the basis of the research findings, some conclusions and recommendations for the key network players are suggested. The scientometric and social network analysis of key words has great potential to expand valuable understanding of the advancement of the research in a specific journal as well as in cases of emerging fields such as new technologies and processes. This study clarifies the feasibility of co-word analysis as a viable method for extracting patterns and identifying trends in the research published in a given journal. Although estimating the amount and topics of research published in Online Information Review has not previously been reported, we believe that such a study is of primary importance to current and future discussions of the researcher's decisions regarding information science and library science. First, researchers possess useful information regarding the topics published in the journal. The journal's topics aligning with their own interest could guide researchers to select Online Information Review as a candidate journal for publication. Second, policy makers must have baseline information to estimate the status of specific journals to develop adequate policy measures. Finally, journal editors must know the state of current research to effectively position the journal in relation to their competitors (Vandermeulen et al., 2011) .",

Although the journal appears to represent well-defined and established research topics, Online Information Review also changes rapidly to embrace new lines of research. Our findings should be of great interest to library and information scientists because such practitioners seek to understand the nature of research information science. In addition, it would be helpful for the journal editor to obtain the bibliometric portrait of the studied journal and recognize its interaction with other subject disciplines.",

During the third period (2010-2014), several developments are noticeable: the central position of the previous terms with the exception of information retrieval and the consolidation of user acceptance as a new central term. During this period, new terms appeared, such as online communities, virtual communities, and open systems, related to topics such as perception, intention, satisfaction, motivation and user acceptance. Other domains that have emerged and play a major role in stimulating research are investigations related to scientific publications based on bibliometric approaches to research evaluation, such as citation analysis, impact factor, h-index and rankings.",
