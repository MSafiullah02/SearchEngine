            "text": "Sloths are genetically and physiologically divergent mammals. Phleboviruses are major arthropod-borne viruses (arboviruses) causing disease in humans and other animals globally. Sloths host arboviruses, but virus detections are scarce. A phlebovirus termed Anhanga virus (ANHV) was isolated from a Brazilian Linnaeus's two-toed sloth (Choloepus didactylus) in 1962. Here, we investigated the presence of phleboviruses in sera sampled in 2014 from 74 Hoffmann's two-toed (Choloepus hoffmanni, n = 65) and three-toed (Bradypus variegatus, n = 9) sloths in Costa Rica by broadly reactive RT-PCR. A clinically healthy adult Hoffmann's two-toed sloth was infected with a phlebovirus. Viral load in this animal was high at 8.5 \u00d7 10 7 RNA copies/ml. The full coding sequence of the virus was determined by deep sequencing. Phylogenetic analyses and sequence distance comparisons revealed that the new sloth virus, likely representing a new phlebovirus species, provisionally named Penshurt virus (PEHV), was most closely related to ANHV, with amino acid identities of 93.1%, 84.6%, 94.7% and 89.0% in the translated L, M, N and NSs genes, respectively. Significantly more non-synonymous mutations relative to ANHV occurred in the M gene encoding the viral glycoproteins and in the NSs gene encoding a putative interferon antagonist compared to L and N genes. This was compatible with viral adaptation to different sloth species and with micro-evolutionary processes associated with immune evasion during the genealogy of sloth-associated phleboviruses. However, gene-wide mean dN/dS ratios were low at 0.02-0.15 and no sites showed significant evidence for positive selection, pointing to comparable selection pressures within sloth-associated viruses and genetically related phleboviruses infecting hosts other than sloths. The detection of a new phlebovirus closely-related to ANHV, in sloths from Costa Rica fifty years after and more than 3,000 km away from the isolation of ANHV confirmed the host associations of ANHV-related phleboviruses with the two extant species of two-toed sloths.",

Phleboviruses are ubiquitous arthropod-borne viruses (arboviruses), associated with human and animal disease, such as Rift Valley fever virus (RVFV), Punta Toro virus (PTV), Toscana virus (TOSV), Sandfly Naples virus (SFNV) and severe fever with thrombocytopenia syndrome virus (SFTSV) (Ayhan & Charrel, 2017; Gundacker et al., 2017; Hartman, 2017) . The phleboviral genome consists of three single-stranded RNA segments of negative or ambisense polarity, termed the large (L), medium (M) and small (S) segments. The L segment encodes the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp), and the M segment encodes a polyprotein which is cleaved into a non-structural protein (NSm) and two envelope glycoproteins termed Gn and Gc. Finally, the S segment encodes the nucleocapsid (N) transcribed in the viral sense and a non-structural protein (NSs) transcribed in reverse sense (Hornak, Lanchy, & Lodmell, 2016) .",

            "text": "time of entry of the wild animal into the sanctuary was not known, and whether the animal acquired phlebovirus infection in the wild or in the sanctuary remained unclear. The full coding sequence of the viral genome was recovered by deep sequencing. Comparison of the tree topology based on the four deduced proteins showed that the new sloth virus consistently clustered within the clade of mosquito/sandfly-associated phleboviruses together with the ANHV prototype strain isolated in Brazil in 1962 (Nunes-Neto et al., 2017) (Figure 1b). The four amino acidbased ML trees displayed distinct clustering patterns; while in the L segment the two ANHV-related strains were most related to Bujaru and Munguba viruses, the ANHV clade did not cluster in close relationship to other phleboviruses in trees based on the M, N and NSs segments (Figure 1b). No reassortment of the ANHV-related viruses with other phleboviruses and no recombination events within ANHV-related genes were detected. The genome of the new ANHV-related virus encompassed, as observed in other phleboviruses, two negative-sense segments and an ambisense genomic segment, the coding sequences of which were all identical in length to the ANHV prototype strain. Translated amino acid genome identity between the new virus and the ANHV prototype strain was 93.1% (L), 84.6% (M), 94.7% (N) and 89.0% (NSs) (Table 2). Amino acid sequence distance between the new virus and other phleboviruses was relatively high at 38.8%-68.5% (L), 51.2%-79.3% (M), 41.1%-64.2% (N) and 74.0%-84.0% (NSs) (Table 2), which was compatible with the relatively long branches segregating the ANHV-related clade from other phleboviruses in phylogenetic analyses. So far, even the ANHV prototype strain is still unclassified by the International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses (ICTV) and, since it could not be placed together with other viruses, neither based on serology (Nunes-Neto et al., 2017) nor by molecular analyses, it may represent a new phlebovirus species.",

Similarly, no sites showed significant evidence for positive selection. It should be noted that the apparent absence of positively selected sites might be biased by to insufficient number of sequences from individual viral species for robust formal selection pressure analyses. However, near-complete absence of positively selected sites and similarly low mean dN/dS rates have been reported for larger phlebovirus data sets(Lam et al., 2013), suggesting robustness of our analyses.Significantly lower positive selection pressure in many arboviruses compared to other viruses is likely associated with their need to constantly adapt to both vertebrate and invertebrate hosts during their life cycle(Lequime, Fontaine, Ar Gouilh, Moltini-Conclois, & Lambrechts, 2016;Sironi, Forni, Clerici, & Cagliani, 2016).",
