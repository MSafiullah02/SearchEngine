These problems can be mitigated by terminating these public health measures when they are no longer necessary, providing adequate information and basic supplies, reducing boredom and improving communication, using technology where possible.

For the families of those affected, there can be feelings of guilt, remorse and loss. Following bereavement, grief is likely to be complex owing to limits on visiting the sick or dying in hospitals, uncertainties about the spread of infection and complications about the conduct of funerals. In this emotionally charged setting, psychological support is vital both at the time of death and into the future. The best strategy is to give people the time and space to rely on their informal networks to cope, but also ensure they know that the door is open to mental health services if they need them at any point, now or in the future.",
