The correlation between Type C HE and increased mortality in cirrhosis has been difficult to decipher due the heterogeneity of the occurrence and impact of accruing multi-organ failure. Acute-on-chronic liver failure (ACLF) remains a term in search of a more precise definition that accurately captures a dominant subset of decompensated cirrhotics with disproportionately high short-term mortality rates attributable to multiorgan failure. In the recent European Canonic study, ACLF was distinctly defined by the sequence and severity of organ dysfunction, allowing for a better understanding of the implications of HE in this critically ill subgroup [7, 8]. HE in both decompensated cirrhosis and ACLF was independently associated with increased mortality. However, mortality from HE associated with ACLF was significantly worse than the HE associated decompensated cirrhosis [9] and therefore warrants closer monitoring and early transfer to the ICU.",

            "text": "There remains no singular attributable etiology for HE. HE is a result of a complex interplay between brain ammonia, inflammation, altered neurotransmission pathways and cerebral hemodynamic dysautoregulation. Hyperammonemia continues to play a significant role in pathogenesis of HE [14, 15]. Ammonia is also thought to result in both cytotoxic and vasogenic brain edema, cerebral energy failure, excessive intracellular accumulation of the osmolyte glutamine and alterations in aquaporin-4 integral membrane proteins [16\u201319]. Ammonia also causes membrane depolarization, calcium influx, glutamate release, activation of proteases and production of free radicals which causes nitration of neuronal proteins and mitochondrial damage [19\u201321]. Figure 8.1 provides a graphic representation of the various neurotoxic mechanisms in\nhyperammonemia. The homeostasis of ammonia is complex process dependent on multiple organ systems. Ammonia generated in the gut is detoxified to glutamine and urea by the liver and urea in turn is excreted by the kidneys. Defective sequential detoxification of ammonia by liver and kidney due to multi-organ failure in ALF and ACLF appreciably accounts for worsening HE. Muscle and brain (astrocytes) represent auxiliary ammonia detoxification systems that convert toxic ammonia to glutamine. Resultant glutamine accumulation in astrocyte is osmotically active and thus causes intracellular swelling (cytotoxic edema) [16, 22, 23] Hence, in the cachectic and catabolic end-stage cirrhotic, skeletal muscle provides minimal refuge to the brain from ammonia. A measured plasma ammonia level in a patient only discloses a small fraction of the proverbial ice berg, with the net bulk of the ammonia concealed in the form of glutamine. Excess glutamine can only be cleared indirectly via intact liver and renal function [24\u201326], without which glutamine becomes a precursor to generating more ammonia. Figures 8.2 and 8.3 provides a simplified graphic representation of this process.\n\n\n",

While cytotoxic edema is an explicit feature in HE, its immediate contribution to malignant edema or intracranial hypertension is dubious. In cirrhotics with HE, cytotoxic edema is present on a cellular level but often unappreciable on CT imaging. Vasogenic edema it thought to lag temporally behind cytotoxic edema and is both direct and indirectly attributable to ammonia [27\u201329]. Luxury perfusion due to increased cerebral blood flow and impaired autoregulation appears to be a process specific to ALF that accounts for the development of malignant cerebral edema and intracranial hypertension. Mechanisms driving this process include the loss of integrity of blood brain barrier [18], failure of ATPase pump with resultant hyperemia due to loss of cerebrovascular autoregulation, increased NO production due to increased activity of neuronal nitric oxide synthase [30], up regulation of cyclooxygenase with increased production of prostaglandins and eicosanoids resulting in hyperemia and increased cerebral blood flow [30]. Hyponatremia frequently occurs in ALF and likely contributes to increased interstitial water and the cerebral edema. Targeting higher plasma sodium goal is associated with a lower incidence of intracranial hypertension.",

If an unresponsive patient was found on the ground, demonstrates evidence of trauma from a fall, witnessed fall or atypical presentation of HE, imaging with CT should be performed.

Lactitol is not available in the United States. Since there is absence of specific disaccharidases on the villous membranes of the human small bowel, these disaccharides freely reach the colon. In the colon, they are broken by the colonic bacteria into acids which lowers the pH. This acidification favors conversion of ammonia (NH3) into ionic ammonium (NH4+). Because of its very nature, ammonium ion is less permeable than ammonia and less absorbed into portal circulation. In addition, both lactulose and lactitol inhibit ammoniagenic coliform bacteria and clear ammonia by decreasing transit time. Lactulose is superior to placebo and tap water enemas and comparable to neomycin [41, 42]Lactulose is usually given orally in patients who are awake enough to swallow. Initial dose of 30\u201360 ml can be repeated hourly till there is a bowel movement and then dose titrated to 2\u20133 soft bowel movements per day. Caution should be exercised in patients with significant alteration in mental status and high aspiration risk. In addition, it should be recognized that goal of lactulose administration is not profuse diarrhea: resulting hypovolemia may actually make encephalopathy worse. Finally, lactulose can cause significant gaseous small bowel distension in paralytic ileus and make it worse. A distended abdomen in a critically ill cirrhotic patient receiving lactulose should be evaluated for an ileus and not assumed to be increased ascites. Lactulose can also be given as enema in comatose patients and those unable to swallow or lacking enteral access.\nPolyethyelene Glycol (PEG)\nA small randomized single center study demonstrated that a 4 L PEG\nadministered orally or via NG over 4 h led to more rapid HE resolution despite less ammonia difference at 24 h compared to standard therapy with Lactulose. PEG\u2019s safety profile and balanced electrolytes make it an attractive adjunct to Lactulose in the ICU setting. Volume of 4 L remains a concern for aspiration especially in later grades of HE.\n\nAmmonia lowering antibiotics (First Tier)\n\n",

In the meta-analysis by Timbol et al. published in abstract form., zinc supplementation provided for a statistical significant reduction in serum ammonia levels [47]. Zinc levels are tightly associated with liver function. Cirrhotics with low zinc levels have a higher risk of hepatic decompensation and hepatic encephalopathy. In cirrhosis with hypoalbuminemia, low zinc levels may be reported since 80% of zinc in blood is albumin bound. Zinc levels are not routinely monitored unless a way to measure free plasma zinc level is developed.

Ammonia clearance is closely associated with ultrafiltration rate. More than likely, CRRT will be used in such a patient for acute kidney injury needing renal replacement; and not hyperammonemia per se. However, one can make a case for CRRT for severe hyperammonemia particularly in ALF or ACLF where the risk of intracranial hypertension and herniation is significantly higher. Hemodialysis and CRRT remains the mainstay for the management of hyperammonemia in patients with urea cycle disorders with a proven track record.\nMolecular Adsorbent Recirculating System (MARS) and Bio-artifical devices\n\nMolecular Adsorbent Recirculating System (MARS) is a blood detoxification system based on albumin dialysis that removes protein bound (bile acids, bilirubin, endogenous benzodiazepines, nitrous oxide) and water soluble toxins (ammonia, creatinine). In the US, MARS is FDA approved for management of ALF due to drug overdose or toxic exposures and for management of HE in decompensated cirrhosis. MARS trials thus far have failed to show a survival benefit; however they have consistently demonstrated improvement in HE and a satisfactory safety profile. Using MARS for refractory HE is thus a potential option. In the case of bioartificial systems, the extracorporeal circuit includes bioreactors loaded with liver cells, thus theoretically having potential to improve synthetic function as well. These extra-corporeal liver assist devices are as of now far from ideal and not widely available; these are subject of research.\nTherapeutic Hypothermia (Goal Temperature of 34 \u00b0C)\nThere remains limited clinical experience in the use of mild hypothermia in chronic liver failure [51]. Its appeal in liver disease is that it counteracts many of the metabolic effects of ammonia, slows protein catabolism and production of ammonia by bacteria and the kidneys [52]. The predominant concern with using hypothermia in cirrhotic patients is its potential to worsen the existing coagulopathy in patients who are high risk for bleeding and the predisposition to infection. In rare cases of extreme refractory hyperammonemia, hypothermia can be used as a transient neuroprotective strategy while pursuing clearance of plasma ammonia through other avenues.\n\n",

These compounds provide an alternative pathway wherein ammonia is excreted in the urine as phenylacetylglutamine. Whereas small randomized studies show encouraging results, larger trials are needed to define the role of these in HE in daily practice. Limitation of these therapies include the need for intact renal function for elimination of phenylacetylglutamine. Efficacy of therapy with dialysis remains unclear. Sodium benzoate is an FDA approved food additive/preservative and is infrequently off-lable in refractory hyperammonemia by adding it to enteral feeding in patients with refractory hyperammonemia and intact renal function.

Unlike cirrhosis, ALF patients are not preconditioned to deal with hyperammonemia and are likely more susceptible to ammonia related toxicity. In practice, plasma ammonia reduction is ALF is frequently orchestrated habitually and serendipitously by using CRRT [49] for acute renal failure and therapeutic hypothermia [87] IH.

True or False ?\n\nAnswer: False\nAn elevated plasma ammonia level (>150 mmol/L) in acute liver failure increases the risk of intracranial hypertension; however, a low level (<146 mmol/L) does not preclude it when associated with multiorgan failure. Vasogenic edema from hyperperfusion of the brain can occur independently of an elevated plasma ammonia levels due to the cytokine storm produced by the dying liver.\nQuestion: Brain imaging for evaluating severe hepatic encephalopathy in patients with Acute-on-chronic Liver failure is unnecessary. True or False ?\n\nAnswer: Acute-on-chronic liver failure patients admitted with overt hepatic encephalopathy have a significantly higher short-term mortality rate and small but devastating risk of brain herniation (4%) and are at an increased risk of intracranial hemorrhage (16%). Atypical presentation of HE in these patients may warrant a head CT. In chronic liver disease without acute multiorgan failure, the yield from neuroimaging is low unless features are very atypical or there is a history of trauma.\nQuestion: Hyperammonemia in chronic liver failure causes worsening encephalopathy leading to coma, however, the effect on the brain is always reversible with treatment. True or False ?\n\nAnswer: False\nAmmonia is neurotoxic however patients with cirrhosis have a relative tolerance to hyperammonemia. Severe and sustained hyperammonemia in cirrhosis can cause irreversible brain injury akin to patients with urea cycle disorders. The threshold at which the injury is irreversible remain unclear. Brain MRI pattern of restricted diffusion (cytotoxic edema) in hyperammonemia states correlates in severity with plasma ammonia levels and clinical outcome.\nQuestion: Induced hypothermia improves outcome in ALF by controlling ICP? True or False ?\n\nAnswer: FalseTherapeutic hypothermia controls ICP, reduces plasma ammonia levels and is safe but does not confer a clear mortality benefit in acute liver failure.\nQuestion: Monitoring and treating ICP in ALF using invasive intracranial monitoring devices result in improved control in ICP with a clear evidence of mortality benefit. True or False ?\n\nAnswer: False\nInvasive intracranial pressure monitoring used in an estimate of 20\u201330% of patients with acute liver failure in North America yields a 2.5\u201310% risk of intracranial hemorrhage. Patient\u2019s with intracranial monitors in a retrospective review received more interventions for ICP control and increased sedation without a discernable mortality benefit.\n",

            "text": "Fig. 8.1: \nHypothesized neurotoxic mechanisms of hyperammonemia: Multiple pathways of ammonia related neurotoxicity have been discovered and postulated. Most significantly they affect astrocytes where ammonia is converted into glutamine. Glutamine has multiple deleterious effect in the CNS. Glutamine results in elevated synaptic glutamate levels and inhibits GLT-1 receptor thus preventing its reuptake. Glutamate stimulates postsynaptic receptors of neurons causing anxiety, agitation and convulsions. Glutamine is taken up by astrocyte mitochondria where it is reconverted into ammonia. This in turn stimulate ROS production in mitochondria, subsequently causing inflammation and cellular swelling through mitogen activated protein kinase. Glutamine is itself osmotically active and worsens swelling. Aquaporin 4 is upregulated by ammonia and IL-1 and is associated with cellular swelling. Ammonia also stimulates L-amino transporter in BBB, thus increasing uptake of neutral amino acids like tryptophan, tyrosine and phenylalanine. These compounds are building blocks for dopamine, norepinephrine and serotonin in CNS. It also results in stimulation of NMDA (N-methyl d-aspartate) receptors which mediates Na-K-ATPase dysfunction resulting in loss of autoregulation. Ammonia also causes membrane depolarization, calcium influx, glutamate release, activation of proteases and production of free radicals which causes nitration of neuronal proteins and mitochondrial damage. Ammonia also stimulates lactate dehydrogenase activity with subsequent formation of lactic acid and alanine. Hyperammonemia can result in increased neurosteroids production leading to elevated GABAergic tone in CNS. The loss of integrity of blood brain barrier results in formation of vasogenic edema. Hyperemia caused by failure of ATPase pump leads to loss of autoregulation of cerebral blood flow. Increased activity of neuronal nitric oxide synthase (nNOS) by ammonia toxicity results in nitric oxide production. In addition, cyclo-oxygenase gene is upregulated resulting in increased production of prostaglandins and eicosanoids which may contribute to hyperemia and increased cerebral blood flow. There is also evidence that there is microglial activation in ALF resulting in increased production of TNF alpha, IL-1 and IL-6",
