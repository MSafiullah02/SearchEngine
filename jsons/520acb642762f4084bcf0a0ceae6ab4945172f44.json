As of April 14, 2020 Two important factors may contribute a second wave of epidemic. First, unlike the 2003 SARS epidemic in which mainly symptomatic cases are infectious [4] , asymptomatic infection of the SARS-CoV2 can transmit disease [5] [6] [7] [8] [9] . Studies have detected virus shedding in nasopharyngeal swap samples among asymptomatic cases [10] . A few case reports have shown some cluster of cases initiated by asymptomatic cases [5, 7, 9] . Researchers have postulated that asymptomatic and pre-symptomatic cases may play a significant role in sustaining the community transmission [6] .",

Heath care providers, hospital beds, and intensive care units (ICU) are limited resources. One main purpose of mitigating the epidemic is to alleviate the impact of epidemic on healthcare resources. Several reports have shown that about 20% of symptomatic COVID-19 cases require hospitalizations, and of them, about 30-50% may require ICU [11] [12] [13] (also https://gis.cdc.gov/grasp/COVIDNet/COVID19_3.html). More importantly, old people or people with existing chronic conditions have worse outcome than young people. For example, the mortality rate for age 50 or younger is below 1%, while the mortality rate increases to more than 10% among people aged 80 or above in the US [14] .",

In addition, at the beginning of the simulation, some proportion of the population have past infection (or immunized) (P).

Despite young imported cases and only 3 contacts between young and old people, infection can quickly transmit into old people. Interestingly, our model demonstrates that reducing the number of contacts among old people alone can not only slowdown the epidemic but also reduce the magnitude of the epidemic among both young and old people. This spillover effect implies that interventions targeting high risk groups such as elderly population can have a larger impact on the whole society, without significantly disturbing the working life among young people.",

Old people often have weaker immune system and multiple underlying chronic conditions. If infected with the virus, they are more likely to be symptomatic and more infectious because their bodies are not able to eliminate virus effectively. Therefore, during an epidemic such as COVID-19, old people are more likely to be hospitalized and die from the complications of infection.

Furthermore, if the infectivity of asymptomatic cases is similar to that of symptomatic cases, a faster epidemic will occur. Despite more asymptomatic cases at the peak of epidemic, there are also significantly more hospitalizations and deaths, while may overwhelm the health care system. With a lower infectivity (30% infectivity), the epidemic reaches its peak later and results in half of hospitalizations at the peak compared with the default model (Supplemental Figure 3 ). In addition, a closely related issue is case importation [23] . Imported cases are often pre-symptomatic, asymptomatic or with mild symptoms.

Our epidemic model is a population model. Although we take account of population heterogeneity such as age in the current model, our age group is overly broad. A more detained age grouping scheme, including children, young adults, middle age group, and elderly, may reflect the agespecific epidemic more realistically. In addition, we assume random mixing within and between the groups. As a population model, we cannot assess the impact of individual behaviors such as the way of reducing contacts, social distancing and travelling. Furthermore, it ignores clustering within the population such as senior group living, community gatherings (e.g., churches, community centers), worksites and schools. These clusters are hotbeds for superspreading events which may lead to a sudden increase of new cases and overwhelm the healthcare system unexpectedly. Furthermore, the quarantine compartment in the model is not contact tracing based.",

We did not intend to model pandemic, as all prevention strategies are ultimately local. Finally, out study only examines a small subset of scenarios during the epidemic. Multi-interventions are more effective in mitigating an epidemic but less sustainable in the long run.

To contain or mitigate the epidemic, countries and regions affected by the COVID-19 epidemic have mandated various nonpharmaceutical interventions such as meticulous contact tracing, mass detection of virus infection, case isolation, social distancing, and closures of school and non-essential business. As a result, the epidemic was blunted in some countries, and daily new case counts are decreasing in many places. However, the partially controlled or blunted epidemic leaves the source of infection and also a large pool of susceptible people in the community, posing a danger of re-emerging outbreak.",

On the other hand, limiting contacts among old people alone not only changes the epidemic curves among themselves, but also significantly affects those of young people (Figure 2b and 2c), even though young people maintain a lot of contacts within themselves. For example, when limiting 3 contacts among old people, 10 contacts among young people, and 3 contacts between young and old people (Figure 2c), at the peak of epidemic, the maximum hospitalizations are 618 for young people and 882 for old people.
