As we can see in [1] a generalized logistic equation captures both the peaks of the total infected and the deaths. In this article our goal is to study the missing peak, i.e. the currently infected one (or total currently positive). After the April 7 the large increase in the number of swabs meant that the logistical behavior of the infected curve no longer worked. So we decided to generalize the model, introducing new parameters. Moreover, we adopt a similar approach used in [1] (for the estimation of deaths) in order to evaluate the recoveries. In this way, introducing a simple conservation law, we define a model with 4 populations: total infected, currently positives, recoveries and deaths. Therefore, we propose an alternative method to a classical SIRD model for the evaluation of the Sars-Cov-2 epidemic. However, the method is general and thus applicable to other diseases. Finally we study the behavior of the ratio infected over swabs for Italy, Germany and USA, and we show as studying this parameter we recover the generalized Logistic model used in [1] for these three countries. We think that this trend could be useful for a future epidemic of this coronavirus.",

            "text": "We briefly review the historical evolution of the Sars-Cov-2 in the Earth. In early December the Sars-Cov-2 appeared in Wuhan, China. The disease caused by the new Coronavirus has a name: \"COVID-19\" (where \"CO\" stands for corona, \"VI\" for virus, \"D\" for disease and \"19\" indicates the year in which it occurred). The Oms Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus announced it on February 11, 2020, during the extraordinary press conference dedicated to the virus. The appearance of new pathogenic viruses for humans, previously circulating only in the animal world, is a widely known phenomenon (called spill over) and it is thought that it may also be at the basis of the origin of the new coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2). The scientific community is currently trying to identify the source of the infection. On December 31, 2019, the Municipal Health Commission of Wuhan (China) reported to the Oms a cluster of cases of pneumonia of unknown etiology in the city of Wuhan, in the Chinese province of Hubei. On January 9, 2020, the Chinese Center for Disease Prevention and Control (CDC) reported that a new coronavirus (initially called 2019-nCoV and now called SARS-CoV-2) has been identified as the causative agent and has been rendered publishes the genomic sequence. Oms on March 11, 2020 declared that COVID-19 can be defined as a pandemic. After notification of the epidemic by China, Italy immediately recommended postponing unnecessary flights to Wuhan and, subsequently, with the spread of the epidemic, to all of China. Consequently, the latter has canceled all flights from Wuhan. This disease does not save Italy that has become a protected area with the DPCM signed on the evening of 9 March by the Prime Minister, Giuseppe Conte, who has extended the restrictive measures already applied for Lombardy and the 14 northern provinces most affected by the coronavirus infection to the whole national territory. The new action comes into force on March 10 and will take effect until April 3. Among the main innovations: it limits the movement of people, blocks sporting events, suspends teaching activities in schools and universities throughout the country until April 3. With the new ordinance of 22 March 2020 issued by the Minister of Health and the Minister of the Interior, from 22 March people are prohibited from moving with public or private trasportation in a municipality other than that in which they are located, except for proven work needs, absolute urgency or for health reasons.",

            "text": "[2] Many growth models have been very recently applied to study the evolution of the Covid-19 infection [3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10] . In [1] we tried to analyze the time evolution of the Sars-Cov-2 in Italy, using a Logistic model [11] at the beginning of the study and after with a generalization of that model. The Logistic behaviour assumes that growth stops when maximum sustainable population density is reached through the carrying capacity K that depends on the environmental conditions. For example the ordinances of the Prime Minister G.Conte, the people's hygiene habits are encoded in the carrying capacity K. We observe as the generalized model of [1] works very well until the April 7. After this date the large increase in the number of swabs meant that the logistical behavior of the infected curve no longer worked. At first in Italy, pharyngeal swabs were initially made only on seriously ill people. This choice gave us the possibility to have a sample of the infected that we can describe with a single population model, after April 7 it becomes impossible. So we decided to use a different model to describe the new trend of the data and try to give different scenarios of the descent phase of the virus in Italy, in the time window February 24-May 5. In [1] we described two different peaks, the peak of the infected and the deaths one. In this paper we analyze the peak of the currently infected and the downhill of the propagation of the Sars-Cov-2. To do this we define a new model similar to a SIRD (see for example [7] ), but without the population of supsceptibles, because there are no criteria on defining the susceptible ones. We consider three couple differential equations for Infected I(t), Deaths D(t) and Recovery R(t) with the following conservation law",

This is completely coherent with the various scenarios: the apparent lethality ( apparent CFR ) is approximately 4.5% in Germany and 6% in the United States, while in Italy is 14%. The contribution of asymptomatic A seems to be similar for all countries. However the surprising result is that the trend of the virus is captured by the same differential equation, i.e. eq. (19), for all considered countries. This could mean that the virus always has the same type of behavior, but at different speed. Let's try to justify this idea: a different speed may depend on population density, work habits and the number of swabs at the beginning of the epidemic. About the last consideration we imagine to immediately carry out a large number of swabs: knowing as soon as possible the largest possible number of infected means limiting the contagion and therefore the propagation speed of virus.",
