Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) is the first known lifethreatening epidemic, occurred in 2003, whereas the second outbreak reported in 2012 in Saudi Arabia with the middle east respiratory syndrome (MERS). The current outbreak is reported in Wuhan, China during late December 2019 [1] . On January 30, 2020, the world health organization (WHO) declared it a public health emergency of international concern (PHEIC) as it had spread to more than 18 countries [2] and on Feb 11, 2020 , WHO named this COVID-19. On March 11, 2020 , as the number of COVID-19 cases reaches to 118,000 in 114 countries and over 4,000 deaths, WHO declared this a pandemic.",

More specifically, a researcher looks for a target class guided solution, i.e., the researcher seeks for a cluster of research articles meeting his/her area of interest. To accomplish this task, this paper proposes a cluster-based parallel OCSVM [3] approach. The cluster techniques are used to group the articles properly so that the articles in the same group are more similar to each other than to those in other clusters, whereas multiple OCSVMs are trained using individual cluster information. For experiments, a set of targettasks is defined from the domain knowledge to generalize the nature of all articles, and these tasks will become the cluster representatives. To assign the target-tasks to the clusters, OCSVM plays a decisive role.",

The conventional binary and multi-class classifiers are surely not suitable for this target-task mining task because, in this unsupervised learning mode, it is always possible that some of the clusters may not be assigned with any target-class, whereas an increase in the number of targettasks to solve this problem leads to generation of duplicate information. These conventional classifiers work fine in the presence of at least two well-defined classes but may become biased, if the dataset suffers from data irregularity problems (imbalanced classes, small disjunct, skewed class distribution, missing values, etc.). Specially, when a class is ill-defined, the classifier may give biased outcome. Firstly, Minter [4] observed this problem and termed it \"single-class classification\", and later, Koch et al. [5] named this fact \"one-class classification\" (OCC). Subsequently, researchers used different terms based on the application domain to which one-class classification was applied, like \"outlier detection\" [6] , \"novelty detection\" [7] and \"concept learning\" [8] . In OCC problems, the target class samples are well-defined and the outliers are poorly defined which make decision boundary detection a difficult problem.",

The benifit of OCSVCs over other state-of-the-art OCC techniques is its work-ability with only positive class samples whereas the other methods need negative class samples too for smooth operation, hence the OCSVCs are found more suitable for this research. Based on extensive literature review, it is evident that OCSVMs (a type of OCSVC) are mostly used for novelty/anomaly detection in various application domains such as intrusion detection [15] , [16] , fraud detection [17] , [18] disease diagnosis [19] , [20] novelty detection [21] and document classification [22] . These assorted applicability make OCSVMs very interesting and important. Though many research articles have been published concerning OCSVM during the last two decades, still, it is not applied and tested for research article mining task. In this paper, OCSVM is used along with clustering techniques for article categorization, and results show that this approach gives promising performance.",

            "text": "A. Data-preprocessing for text mining Document embeddings help to extract richer semantic content for document classification in text mining applications [24] , [25] . Numeric representation of text documents is a challenging task in various applications such as document retrieval, web search, spam filtering, topic modeling, etc. In 1972, Jones [29] proposed a technique known as term frequency-inverse document frequency (Tf-idf). Tf-idf is a technique of information retrieval and text mining that uses a weight, which is a statistical measure to calculate the importance of a word within a document corpus. It is a frequencybased measure, and its significance increases proportionally as the frequency of the word in the corpus increases. Later, Bengio et al. [26] proposed a feed-forward neural network language model for word embedding. Later, a simpler and more effective neural architecture was developed to learn word vectors, word2vec by Mikolov et al. [27] , where the objective functions produce high-quality vectors. Recently, doc2vec as an extension of word2vec has been provided by Mikolov et al. [28] to implement document-level embeddings. This technique is designed to work with the different granularity of the word sequences such as word n-gram, sentence, paragraph or document level. Avinash et al. [48] performed intensive experiments on multiple datasets and observed that doc2vec method performs better than TF-idf. In this paper, doc2vec is used to generate features of the research documents and defined tasks. The generated features are further used in other components of the proposed model for clustering and classification.",

It keeps inter-cluster data points similar to each other and also tries to maximize the distance between two clusters [30] . DBSCAN is a data clustering algorithm proposed by Martin et al. [31] . It is a non-parametric algorithm based on the concept of the nearest neighbour. It considers a set of points in some space and identifies groups of close data points as nearest neighbours and also identifies outliers to the points which are away from their neighbors. HAC [32] is a \"bottomup\" approach in which each data point is initially considered as a single-element cluster. Later, in the next steps, the two similar clusters are merged to form a bigger cluster, and subsequently, converges to a single cluster. Experiments have been performed on CORD-19 dataset using above mentioned clustering algorithms, and the objective is to find the best cluster representation of the whole sample space.",

Search engines may give unrelated articles, and therefore the overall search process becomes ineffective and time-consuming. As the overall analysis is supposed to perform in unlabeled data, the clustering technique helps to group the related articles in an optimized way. It is obvious that the search query is always task specific, hence the target-tasks are defined with domain knowledge. Conventional classifiers (binary or multi-class) may give biased results and never ensure task-specific classification, thus parallel one-class SVMs are used for target-task assignment to clusters. This method helps the researchers to instantly find the desired research articles more precisely. For experiments, the CORD-19 dataset is used to validate the performance of the proposed approach.",

These tasks are defined and prepared by domain knowledge to answer all possible queries of corona-virus related research articles. In this paper, instead of associating the articles to address the target-tasks, the intention is to map the defined tasks to the cluster of similar articles. The overall approach is divided into several components, such as document embedding (DE), articles clustering (AC), dimensionality reduction (DR) and visualization, and one-class classifier (OCC) as shown in Fig. 4 Since the abstract of a scholarly article represents the semantic meaning of the whole article, this along with the target-tasks are mapped onto the numeric data represented in multi-dimensional vector space using the state-of-the-art natural language processing (NLP) document embedding techniques such as doc2vec [46] based on distributed memory version of paragraph vector (PV-DM) [47] . The generated vector spaces of the article's abstracts are utilized to generate segregated clusters of related articles. The extensive trials are conducted with varying clustering approaches like kmeans [30] , DBSCAN [31] and HAC [32] , to generate an appropriate number of segregated clusters. The generated clusters are also analyzed with the two-dimensional visual representation via dimensionality reduction techniques such as PCA [37] , ISOMAP [38] , t-SNE [39] , and UMAP [40] . Each of the generated clusters are parallely trained on one-class support vector machines (OCSVM) separately. The trained models are then utilized to associate the most appropriate articles for the concerned required information (targettask). Furthermore, these generated results are statistically compared in contrast to the computational effective approach (CEA), where in CEA, the OCSVM models are trained on reduced clusters feature set generated using above discussed dimensionality reduction techniques. Algorithm 1 presents the complete process of the proposed approach.

It shows that the false negative rate is almost negligible, and ensures the robustness of the approach. Results show that among all three clustering techniques DBSCAN sounds most promising, however due to its heavily skewed distribution of articles in the clusters it is not a robust technique for this problem, hence k-means is observed most suitable clustering technique to work along with parallel OCSVMs.",

The CORD initiative has developed a repository to record the published COVID-19 articles with the update frequency of a day. This article proposed a novel bottom-up target guided approach for mining of COVID-19 articles using parallel one-class support vector machines which are trained on the clusters of related articles generated with the help of clustering approaches such as k-means, DBSCAN, and HAC from the embedded vector space of COVID-19 articles generated by doc2vec approach. With extensive trials, it was observed that the proposed approach with reduced features produced significant results by providing quality of relevant articles for each discussed targettask, which is verified by the cosine similarity score. The domain of this article is not limited to mining the scholarly articles, where it can further be extended to other applications concerned with the data mining problems. ",
