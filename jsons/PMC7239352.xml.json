Efforts to provide early rehabilitation following acute stroke can be compromised by a variety of conditions, including apathy and hypersomnia, which may occur in up to 35% and 18% of stroke survivors, respectively [7, 8]. Disordered consciousness after ischemic or hemorrhagic stroke can result from damage to many different structures, including bilateral cerebral cortical injury, pontine tegmentum, midbrain, basal forebrain, hypothalamus and central thalamus, putamen, caudate, and pallidum [9]. Strategies to circumvent these impairments and increase participation in early rehabilitation are needed.",

Although amantadine is commonly administered to patients with disorders of consciousness, its mechanism of action remains unclear. It may modulate dopamine activity by increasing its release, blocking its reuptake, and increasing postsynaptic dopamine receptors or altering their conformation and may also antagonize n-methyl-d-aspartate (NMDA) receptors [10, 11]. The mechanism of action of modafinil has been attributed to stimulation of alpha1B noradrenergic receptors, reduced gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) release, increased glutamate or histamine release, or altered hypocretin activity [12]. Modafinil\u2019s effects appear independent of serotonin, dopamine, GABA, adenosine, histamine-3, melatonin, and benzodiazepine receptors. Compared to conventional neurostimulants, modafinil appears to be devoid of dopaminergic effects, which may be of significance as post-stroke dopaminergic system dysfunction has been recently described [12, 13].",

Caregiver notes and GCS scores were assessed by a neurocritical care Physician Assistant (AML), and physical and occupational therapy notes were assessed by a Doctor of Physical Therapy (KN) and a registered, licensed Occupational Therapist (JC). Supplement 1 describes the approach used by these chart reviewers. Patients who did not meet the definition for responsiveness were classified as non-responders. If patients had an additional neurostimulant added or substituted, the timing of this change was considered when interpreting which drug the patient responded to or did not respond to. Since there was no published literature to establish an expected duration of treatment prior to a response, if a patient responded after at least 24 h of a new combination, we considered them a responder to the new regimen.",

Sleep disruption was present if the patient received a new sleep medication after starting a neurostimulant, and for the other adverse events, the medical record was reviewed for the 48 h prior to initiating neurostimulant therapy, and if the adverse event was not described prior to initiation but was identified afterward, we considered it possibly drug related. Measurements of QTc were obtained from 12-lead electrocardiograms (ECG) and were considered prolonged if > 450 ms after an initial ECG with a normal QTc. Agitation and delirium were assessed using a previously published algorithm [24]. The probability that an adverse reaction was related to neurostimulant administration was not assessed using grading scales (e.g., Naranjo scale or Bradford Hill criteria) because of the numerous confounders present in ICU patients, and the lack of demonstrated validity and reliability in critically ill patients. Instead, as is standard with good clinical practice for research, we reported all potential adverse drug effects [25].",

The best time to start neurostimulants is not known, and caution has been advised to avoid very early, high-intensity mobilization in the first 24 h after acute stroke, since this has been associated with a reduction in favorable outcome at 3 months [26, 27]. Several patients had neurostimulants started late in their hospital course and were either transferred or had support withdrawn prior to 72 h of treatment. It is not clear if a longer duration of monitored dosing would have resulted in a response or not, but because of the short administration time, we excluded them from our effectiveness analysis.

Even in the rehabilitation setting, medications confounded assessment of responsiveness in prior studies for up to a third of patients [14]. The common sequelae of stroke (e.g., pain, seizures, vasospasm, hydrocephalus, and intracranial hypertension) also complicated our neurostimulant response assessments. For example, hydrocephalus (which required CSF diversion 97% of the time) may have induced somnolence, while CSF diversion or unclamping external drains may have induced wakening. Similarly, intubated patients who are liberated from mechanical ventilation may become more interactive as their communication improves and sedation is reduced. A recent study of TBI patients treated acutely with neurostimulants in the ICU encountered many of the same confounders [21]. Supplement 2 includes a list of the potential confounders we encountered in this study and suggested approaches to them in future studies.",

Our most common administration schedule of amantadine at 06:00 and 14:00 may alleviate this, but this remains unproven. Two subjects were initially prescribed twice daily doses at 08:00 and 20:00; both had insomnia noted and the timing of doses was adjusted to 06:00 and 14:00. The ideal dose and whether a predictable dose\u2013response relationship exists for amantadine during acute stroke care is unclear. Amantadine may increase the number of postsynaptic dopamine receptors or alter their conformation over several weeks, suggesting time of daily administration may not influence sleep [29]. The most concerning potential adverse drug effect during amantadine therapy was seizures, though it was impossible to assess causality since seizures are not rare after the types of stroke we studied. Amantadine has been safely administered to patients with epilepsy since the mid-1980\u2019s [30], but caution is still required. Many patients had multiple other reasons for potential adverse effects (i.e., confusion potentially caused by amantadine or modafinil, urinary tract infection, steroids, vasospasm, hydrocephalus, or hypernatremia). Prior studies examining the accuracy of delirium screening following acute stroke using the CAM-ICU have suggested decreased accuracy results [31\u201333]. The number of patients with delirium in our study was low but use of accurate screening tests after stroke in future studies may increase recognition. All adverse events identified have been previously reported, though it is possible other adverse drug effects occurred and were not identified in our retrospective study.",

Due to the paucity of published data for stroke patients treated with neurostimulants in the acute setting, no protocols or robust data were available to guide us or allow for a power calculation. We performed this retrospective evaluation to obtain baseline data and response estimates to help design future studies. Reliance on caregiver notes was an additional limitation but prompted us to incorporate more consistent documentation regarding neurostimulant administration and response. It was not possible to control for changes in the quality of caregiver and PT/OT documentation over time as neurostimulants were more frequently administered. Physical and occupational therapists used a semi-structured template including initial and subsequent evaluations, which differ in frequency and domains evaluated from patient-to-patient. Future studies in the acute care setting should utilize a clinical effectiveness measure that evaluates the indication for neurostimulant use and regularly assesses response.",

Herrold and colleagues retrospectively evaluated 115 TBI patients treated with neurostimulants in a rehabilitation center, finding that those treated with multiple agents had no better outcome than those treated with a single medication [34]. Given the lack of an untreated control group in this retrospective study, we cannot be certain that any improvements resulted from the medications and it is possible they reflect the natural phase of recovery over time after stroke. Not all patients were monitored for the full 9-day period after starting or changing a neurostimulant, due to transfers to rehabilitation or skilled nursing facilities or decisions to withdraw life-sustaining therapy. Ideally, a consistent follow-up period would have been maintained for all patients. Similarly, after a change in neurostimulant, a response within the first few days could be from the new regimen or a delayed response from the initial treatment. It is possible our approach to assign credit for a response to the new regimen if > 24 h of drug had been given was incorrect.",

Prior data have been published for these agents [37, 38], and amantadine and modafinil were the two most prescribed stimulants in a recent acute TBI study [21].
