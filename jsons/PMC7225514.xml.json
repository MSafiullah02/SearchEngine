Micro-blogs are small messages communicated via social media such as Twitter, and gained popularity recently as means of expressing peoples\u2019 views [6]. Micro-blogs fall under the category of unstructured big data and are considered a type of electronic word of mouth (eWOM). A significant amount of eWOM are generated as part of consumers\u2019 evaluations of products and the hospitality services they are linked to [2, 33]. Hence, consumers and tourists now play an active role in shaping an organization\u2019s reputation [13], which in turn can impact the organisation\u2019s sales performance [36]. Therefore, the analysis of reviews has become a mainstream activity in marketing to improve product and services positioning based on customers\u2019 needs and opinions [18]. According to [28], a brand is no longer what the company tells a customer it is, but rather, what customers tell each other it is.",

Topic modelling has also been used to identify topics discussed in reviews to provide temporal associations between topics in a timeline. These studies, however, concentrated on endogenous aspects of tourists\u2019 reviews (i.e., sentiment) whilst exogenous aspects, such as culture and purchasing power, have been addressed separately. No study so far combines exogenous with endogenous variables in one model to investigate the reasons for tourist dissatisfaction and predict perspective tourists\u2019 sentiment. Therefore, this paper investigates the application of Decision Trees to identify patterns, by evaluating the combined effect of culture, purchasing power, and topics discussed by tourists in reviews, on sentiment polarity. The research questions addressed in this paper are: (i) What are the main patterns emerging from tourist reviews of Cyprus hotels? (ii) How endogenous and exogenous reviews\u2019 parameters affect tourist sentiment?",

This is linked to evidence that purchasing power [38] is linked with a greater need to portray status through consumption [12], hence promoting power distance. The financial state of a country has been used for global markets analysis [15] with Gross Domestic Product (GDP) per capita as a key indicator for comparing the level of development among countries and socioeconomic status. Human welfare and GDP per capita go together, while increased GDP per capita is found to be correlated with happiness [11]. At the same time, in countries with low human development index, GDP dramatically affects quality of life [17]. Therefore, the argument by many researchers is that tourists from countries with lower purchasing power compared to their tourist destination might be more demanding and hence more likely to evaluate their experience at a destination negatively.",

Three common SA approaches are Machine Learning (ML), Lexicon-based Methods, and Linguistic Analysis techniques. From these ML techniques are considered the most effective and simplest to use with Na\u00efve Bayes (NB) and Support Vector Machines (SVM) being the most popular. ML techniques are classified into supervised and unsupervised [41], with supervised requiring training the classifier prior to its use. The main difference from unsupervised is that supervised techniques use labelled opinions that have been pre-evaluated as negative, positive, or neutral to train models. Such techniques include SVM, NB, Logistic Regression, Multilayer Perceptron, K-Nearest Neighbours, and Decision Trees [23]. In this study, the NB approach is employed for SA due to its good results and popularity [3, 24, 39].",

Two of the most popular techniques for topic analysis are the Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) and the Structural Topic Model (STM) [14]. In LDA, a topic is a probability distribution function over a set of words used as a type of text summarization. LDA expresses the relationships between words in terms of their affinity to certain latent variables (topics), using Bayesian probabilities. STMs extend the LDA framework with the capability of accommodating supplementary information in the form of metadata that could reveal important aspects of how topics are linked to covariates [35], or to observe which topics correlate with one another [9]. LDA and STM are generative models and assume that each topic is a distribution over words and each document is a mixture of topics [7]. STM is employed in this study, with each review representing a distribution of a finite set of topics, which in turn are distributions of the words in the corpus used in similar reviews. Identified topics were later associated to each review in the dataset. New columns are added depending on the number of topics, each representing the degree of association of each topic to the case.",

They are intuitive and explanatory, unlike black-box algorithms such as support vector machines or artificial neural networks that cannot be easily comprehended by decision makers or validated by domain experts. A DT learns its structure by partitioning the training dataset into bins using a series of splits, each performed after identifying the most prevalent split-variable using information gain or Gini impurity index metrics. Splitting variables are used in defining the structure of the tree that is made up of nodes. Each node splits the dataset into branches. There are several algorithms for designing DTs such as CART, ID3, C4.5, CHAID etc. The CART algorithm [5] is a binary classification technique that utilises the Gini index of heterogeneity to determine the information gain of each variable and accordingly decide which variables to be used to split the dataset.",

In our case, the number of positive sentiment reviews was much larger than the negative ones (minority). This class imbalance can mislead the classifier into overfitting, since the majority class dominates the dataset. Hence, the classifier always generates results that abide with the majority class. Solutions to the class-imbalance problem include many different forms of under-sampling or over-sampling. The oversampling approach creates a balanced subset from the original dataset by duplicating samples of the minority class. Two of the most common oversampling techniques are Random oversampling (RO) and the Synthetic Minority Oversampling Technique (SMOTE). RO is easy to implement and involves the minority samples in the data being replicated randomly until the proportion of majority class is achieved. The SMOTE technique generates artificial samples from the minority class by combining several minority-class instances that are similar. That is, for each minority instance, it introduces a synthetic new sample by utilizing information from the minority-class nearest-neighbours instances. SMOTE is a more sophisticated technique and generally produces better results [40] than RO. We implemented and tested both approaches, confirming SMOTE\u2019s superior performance.

To estimate each country\u2019s purchasing power, the GDP per capita index was used, using data from the World Monetary Fund. The variable is expressed in US dollars and was standardized in a scale from 0 to 100. Similarly, for the cultural values of each reviewer, the Hofstede website was used, associating each cultural dimension to a value in a scale from 0-100, based on country of origin.

In this study [22] for instance they examined whether reviewers from collectivist-leaning societies (valuing tradition and helping each other) tend to write fewer excessively negative reviews than those from individualistic societies. They found that despite being marginally positive in ratings, reviewers use negative connotations in narrative descriptions that indicate dissatisfaction. To avoid this problem, we opted for a sentiment classification approach rather than using the reviewer\u2019s ratings alone. The two trained sentiment models used for this task were Textblob (based on Naive Bayes) and Vader [17], which are popular classifiers with satisfactory precision and recall scores. Both models were used in an ensemble manner to improve our confidence in the results. A python script automatically utilized the Textblob and Vader models and averaged their results. The process was repeated for all downloaded reviews, and their polarity was saved next to each review as a new attribute.",

To learn the topic model, reviews had to be pre-processed further. During this step, irrelevant information was eliminated through the sub-steps of stop-word removal, tokenization, stemming. Stop-words refer to words providing little or no useful information to text analysis and can hence be considered as noise. Common stop-words include articles, conjunctions, prepositions and pronouns. Tokenization refers to the transformation of a stream of strings into a stream of processing units, referred to as tokens. Thus, during this step reviews were converted into a sequence of tokens, by choosing n-grams (phrases composed by n words in length). The Stemming process involves converting words to their root form. After data pre-processing, the STM topic modelling approach was employed. Extracted topics were inspected based on prior domain knowledge; therefore, expertise in the field under investigation was required to make the necessary connections. The identification of the recommended number of topics (k) was based on the model\u2019s semantic coherence and exclusivity for each model and topic [35]. The recommended value for k from this process was 10. Manual inspection of the resulting topics followed to identify possible topic merges into super-topics to reduce the dimensionality of the model further. This yielded the six super-topics of Table 2. Each review was then associated with super-topics based on the results of the trained model and the topic merges. The super-topic associations were appended as new variables in the datafile based on the probability distribution of topics per review, i.e., each review is associated with more than one topic.",

Low indulgence (indicating control of desires) yields positive sentiment in 71% of the cases when no cleanliness and staff issues are encountered, while the combination of high indulgence with low GDP per capita results in marginally negative sentiment, indicating that tourist from poorer countries who want to satisfy their desires expect more for their money. On the other hand, tourists from richer countries tend to give positive sentiment in 61% of cases. Preliminary evaluation of the model\u2019s most prevalent patterns was performed using comparative analysis with relevant literature. Studies on cleanliness, service [37], and value for money (GDP) [30] report a similar effect on satisfaction. The latter is similar to our GDP dimension and utilises equity theory [1] to observe that satisfaction is occurring when the performance of the service equates the money paid for the service. The model was further evaluated by two experts from the hospitality industry who verified the validity of these rules.",

            "text": "This study serves as a proof-of-concept and is the first to combine a DT approach with topic modelling to identify patterns using both exogenous and endogenous parameters of tourists\u2019 reviews. Several studies examined mainly the impact of culture on review generation [21, 22, 34], therefore this work provides a contribution by combining other exogenous and endogenous variables. The case study used to elaborate this method refers to Cyprus as a popular tourist destination and the data collected span the years 2009-2019. The results indicate that the three determinants of sentiment polarity in reviews are firstly, issues with cleanliness and staff professionalism that emerge from topic analysis, and then the cultural dimensions of indulgence and power distance. Based on the most prevalent rules from the DT and the cases that fall under each one, Cypriot hotels seem to have failed to satisfy tourists from Romania and Greece when issues with cleanliness emerge and the Power distance is relatively high. In contrast, when issues with Cleanliness alone emerge, tourists from the UK are more likely to be dissatisfied. Current hotel services cannot satisfy adequately tourists from these countries and, hence, destination marketing managers need to either improve their service or concentrate on tourists from other countries such as Australia, Switzerland and Netherlands that have higher GDP than Cyprus or have low levels of indulgence (<45) and are more likely to be satisfied. Tourist origin countries with positive results with regards to service quality and staff are, Israel, Lebanon and Greece, meaning that staff attitude and professionalism can affect their overall sentiment by 12% and 8% (Israel, Greece/Lebanon) compared to tourists from other countries with much lower positive sentiments. The main findings align with evidence from other studies indicating that consumers from countries with lower purchasing power provide low ratings to hotels. This is also consistent with evidence that power distance affects reviews polarity, supported by theory highlighting that in countries with high power distance, consumers often feel superior to service providers in the social hierarchy [20] and less tolerant with service quality, while they tend to give low service evaluations. Results from this work also highlight that other cultural traits from Hofstede, such as individualism, tend to be related to tourist review sentiment, while the topics that are associated with highest sentiment are those about hotel services. Limitations of this work reside in the quality of the data collected and issues pertaining to fake reviews that might affect the results. Our future work aims to filter out these reviews and examine if the effect of the aforementioned variables alters in any way the main conclusions of the current study.",
