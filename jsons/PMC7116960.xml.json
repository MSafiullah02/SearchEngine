Lower observed PEs in the modified mode may be explained, at least in part, by the 52% reduction in the outdoor air ventilation in the hallway. Thus, particles released into the hallway from the patient room accumulated to higher concentrations with the lower ventilation rate. The measurement uncertainty of the particle counters is estimated to be \u00b110%. For a PE of 98%, this measurement uncertainty translates into an uncertainty for the PE of approximately 0.5% (i.e. 97.6%\u201398.4%).",

Thus, changes in the ambient aerosol concentrations produced errors in the interpretation of the aerosol concentrations. This was especially evident in the small size particles (i.e. 0.5\u20131.0 \u03bcm), which were not removed with high efficiency by the air filtration system. Some researchers [13] have used a tracer gas such as sulfur hexafluoride (SF6), which is a unique tracer not present in significant concentrations in the outdoor air. However, since SF6 is a gas and not a particle, the transport and removal mechanisms will differ from that of particles. Ideally we would use a unique aerosol with an aerodynamic size similar to that of infectious disease droplet nuclei, however there currently is no instrumentation capable of real-time measurements a unique aerosol tracer. Some researchers [9] have used unique fluorescent particles, but these studies typically involve collecting non-real time integrated air samples on filters with subsequent analyses.",
