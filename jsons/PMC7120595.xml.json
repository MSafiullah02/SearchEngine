In the 1980s, Cushley et al. reported that inhaled ADO causes bronchoconstriction in asthmatic patients, but not in healthy subjects [1]. Later, it was discovered that asthmatics maintain high airway ADO levels, which is further raised following a challenge [2, 3]. In the past 5 years, the list of respiratory diseases with aberrant airway ADO and/or ATP regulation was extended to CF, COPD and idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis [4\u20136] (see 10.1007/978-94-007-1217-1_4 for details). Also, the recent finding that ADO induces bronchoconstriction in smokers with COPD supports a role in the \u201coverlapping syndrome\u201d [7\u20139]. Such widespread occurrence of excess airway ADO motivated scientists and clinicians to investigate the implications of this metabolic aberrance in all aspects of chronic respiratory diseases.",

This stunning discovery launched a series of initiatives to identify which ADO and ATP receptors promote, or attenuate, lung complications. The previous chapters were carefully organized to describe all purinergic receptors, their properties, distribution and roles on the lung resident, immune and inflammatory cells. 10.1007/978-94-007-1217-1_8 described the animal studies that were conducted to compare their impact on lung homeostasis and the potential of selective ligands for the treatment of chronic respiratory diseases.",

First, evidence is provided for the higher diagnostic stringency of ADO-induced BHR for asthma, with respect to histamine and methacholine. Then, we tell the tale of Adagen (Enzon Pharmaceuticals), which was designed for the treatment of ADA-related severe combined immunodeficiency (ADA-SCID), but shows considerable potential for the correction of airway ADO levels in chronic airway diseases. Finally, this chapter covers the ADO and ATP receptor ligands selected by pharmaceutical companies for the treatment of acute lung injury and chronic respiratory diseases, and to improve the outcome of lung transplant. Based on the current understanding of purinergic signaling in the respiratory system, this section offers a critical view on the design of the ligands and the delivery route, which may assist the pharmaceutical industry in future drug discovery.",

In contrast, ADO concentrations up to 30-fold higher had no effect on the airway caliber of normal subjects [11]. Adenine nucleotides, ADP and AMP, also elicited airway narrowing in asthmatics, while the ADO metabolite, inosine, did not induce bronchoconstriction [12]. The airway epithelial surfaces express ectonucleotidases which rapidly dephosphorylate adenine nucleotides into ADO (see 10.1007/978-94-007-1217-1_2 for details). While it is well accepted that the effects of these nucleotides on airway caliber are mediated by ADO, AMP remains the drug of preference for solubility purposes (review: [13]).",

These substances activate M3 muscarinic receptors and H1 histamine receptors on airway smooth muscle (ASM) to elicit bronchoconstriction in asthmatics at concentrations having no effect in the airways of normal subjects. While the sensitivity and negative predictive values of methacholine and histamine challenges approach 100%, their specificity and positive predictive values for asthma are very low [14\u201317]. In fact, adult COPD patients and children with bronchiectasis, bronchiolitis obliterans or CF, typically develop BHR in response to methacholine and histamine [18\u201322]. In contrast, non-smoking adults with COPD and children with airway diseases other than asthma are less responsive to an AMP challenge [7\u20139, 22, 23]. This higher specificity for asthma suggests that aerosol AMP may constitute a powerful diagnostic test to differentiate these airway diseases in children and non-smoking adults. Furthermore, contrary to methacholine, the magnitude of the BHR response to AMP is highly correlated with the degree of underlying airway inflammation in asthmatics [24, 25].",

It is more specific for asthma than methacholine and histamine challenges [22, 27], correlates more closely with the degree of inflammation in the lower airways [24, 25], and may be used to evaluate the efficacy and potency of inhaled steroids [28\u201331]. However, the sensitivity of an AMP challenge to detect asthma is limited, the rate of AMP responsiveness varying from 39% to 95.5% in children [32\u201335] and 50% to 89% in adults [24, 36]. The studies reporting a high degree of sensitivity included large numbers of atopic asthmatics. Accordingly, a study designed to elucidate the determinants of AMP responsiveness revealed that atopic sensitization, assessed by positive skin prick testing, was the major variable affecting AMP sensitivity [32]. Compared to non-atopic asthmatics, atopic asthmatics exhibit exaggerated mast cell activation by antigens and allergens. Consequently, these cells have been the focus of intense investigation to better understand the mechanisms of ADO-induced bronchoconstriction.",

Accordingly, ADO-induced BHR was attenuated by mast cell stabilizing agents (i.e. nedocromil) [38\u201340] and antagonists of the histamine receptor (i.e. terfenadine) [41\u201343] or leukotriene receptor (i.e. Montelukast) [44]. These studies led many to believe that ADO-induced bronchoconstriction results from mast cell activation. In rodents, the P1 receptor causing mast cell degranulation was identified as the A3R [45\u201348], whereas this role was ascribed to the A2BR in human mast cells [49\u201351]. Nonetheless, aerosolized treatment with a dual A2BR/A3R antagonist (QAF805) failed to affect PC20 (provocative concentration required to induce a 20% fall in lung function) in asthmatics [52], suggesting that ADO induces bronchoconstriction by other mechanisms.",

Furthermore, the incubation of normal ASM cultures with serum from asthmatic patients induced the up-regulation of A1Rs [55]. Incidentally, animal studies conducted with A1R agonists and antagonists also support a role for A1Rs located on ASM in ADO-induced BHR [56\u201358].

In allergic (not na\u00efve) guinea pigs, the fact that bilateral vagotomy or capsaicin strongly inhibited airway obstruction to AMP (75%), or an A1R agonist (N(6)-cyclopentyladenosine; CPA) (50%), suggests that cholinergic neural input to the ASM is critical for A1R-mediated bronchoconstriction [62].

These functional mutations allow toxic levels of substrates to accumulate and interfere with the development of thymocytes in the thymus and bone marrow, which prevents or weakens the immune responses to infection [67]. Accordingly, inherited ADA deficiency is catalogued as an autosomal recessive immunodeficiency disorder exhibiting a wide range of severity, depending on the level of residual activity: (1) a neonatal and fatal severe combined immunodeficiency disease (SCID) characterized by the absence of cellular and humoral immunity; (2) a delayed onset progressive disease retaining some humoral immunity; (3) a late juvenile onset with progressive attrition of immune defenses; (4) an adult onset disorder [66].

The circulating PEG-ADA was also able to reduce the intracellular levels of ADO [71] due to the ubiquitous expression of transporters in the plasma membrane of mammalian cells (see 10.1007/978-94-007-1217-1_2 for details).",

The therapy successfully reduced tissue ADO concentrations and dramatically improved immune functions [69]. However, the levels of T, B and natural killer lymphocytes rose over the first few years, but never reached normal values. Also, about 65% of the patients developed antibodies against PEG-ADA within the first year. Their lymphocyte levels began to drop, as they faced a steady decline in immune function. Another major obstacle to this therapy was the cost of biweekly injections of PEG-ADA, which rose to $200,000/year [72]. These serious limitations called for alternative approaches for the restoration of ADA.",

Over nearly two decades, the gene therapy consisted almost exclusively in the use of retroviral vectors targeting the lymphocytes and hematopoietic progenitors. Patients were successfully colonized by hematopoietic stem cells transfected with the ADA gene, following partial ablation of the bone marrow [74]. However, this groundbreaking approach came with the risk of inspectional mutagenesis. Recent studies suggest that this highly invasive protocol may be replaced by ex vivo lentiviral therapy. In ADA-deficient mice, the intravenous injection of human immunodeficiency virus 1-based lentiviral vector at birth induced the long-term expression of enzymatically active ADA at levels comparable to long-term PEG-ADA treatments [72]. This approach effectively restored immune function and significantly extended survival. As such, this non-invasive method may provide long-term restoration of ADA activity in ADA-SCID patients.",

An animal model of ADA deficiency was developed to investigate this link, but the ADA\u2212/\u2212 mice suffered from a perinatal lethality due to hepatotoxicity [75]. This complication was circumvented using an ADA minigene possessing only the promoter elements required for expression in the trophoblast, which preserved liver function [76]. These partially ADA-deficient mice were born without ADA activity, as evidenced by a steady accumulation of the ADA substrates: ADO and deoxyadenosine. They displayed typical immunodeficiency in the lymphoid line for ADA-SCID patients [77]. In addition, these mice developed severe pulmonary complications, characterized by BHR to inhaled ADO [78], inflammatory cell infiltration and mucus hypersecretion [77]. The defective alveogenesis resulted in an emphysema-like phenotype by postnatal day 10, and the mice died by postnatal day 21 due to respiratory distress [79] (see 10.1007/978-94-007-1217-1_8 for details). These studies demonstrate that the high systemic ADO levels of SCID patients are responsible for the development of severe lung complications. More importantly, they suggested that the high airway ADO levels of asthmatic [3, 80, 81] and COPD [82] patients promote the inflammation, remodeling and fibrosis leading to BHR and the loss of lung function.",

On the other hand, ADA\u2212/\u2212 mice which develop lung inflammation over 20 days completely recovered after 3 days of PEG-ADA treatment at a dose that fully restored normal lung ADO levels [79]. Interestingly, the microarray analysis of lung tissue revealed that PEG-ADA restored the normal expression of genes critical for inflammatory responses, as well as factors promoting remodeling and fibrosis. This observation supported the therapeutic potential of PEG-ADA for patients with well-established chronic respiratory diseases. This hypothesis was tested using ADA\u2212/\u2212 mice maintained on a low-dose PEG-ADA regimen from birth, which prolonged their lifespan to 4\u20135 months [84]. After 3 months, the resulting intermediate ADO level fostered the development of severe pulmonary inflammation, collagen deposition and alteration in airway structure. Their BAL fluid accumulated, both, pro-inflammatory and pro-fibrotic mediators (IL1\u03b2, osteopontin, MMP12, TGF\u03b2, and PAI-1). All these complications were fully resolved by shifting these mice to high-dose PEG-ADA for 5 weeks.",

An earlier report of normal IL-13 concentration in COPD sputum [88] may have resulted from the use of enzyme-linked immunoassay, instead of the more sensitive cytometric bead array, as the authors only detected IL-13 in 6/34 patients. In CF patients, a significant negative relationship was established between airway IL-13 levels and lung functions [86]. The significance of IL-13 for chronic airway diseases is supported by the plethora of studies which identified this cytokine as upstream element responsible for the imbalance in metalloproteinase production promoting airway remodeling (reviews: [89, 90]). Incidentally, IL-13 transgenic mice develop mucus cell metaplasia, hypersecretion and sub-epithelial fibrosis [91, 92]. Interestingly, they share many phenotypic traits with the ADA-deficient mice, including eosinophilia, emphysema and fibrosis, and they survive less than 4 months [92]. The development of these lung complications coincides with a steady rise in lung ADO level and reduction in lung ADA activity. One month of PEG-ADA treatment corrected the ADO levels and significantly reduced inflammation, mucin secretion, collagen deposition and emphysema [91].",

The immense impact of this discovery on biomedical research led to the development of a new generation of aerosolized drugs for chronic respiratory diseases. In 1999, Metzger and Nyce designed respirable antisense oligonucleotides (RASONs) as short, single-stranded nucleic acid sequences modified to enhance their stability [58]. They bind the initiation codon of the messenger RNA (mRNA), which prevents translation and targets the message for degradation by RNAses. A clear advantage over traditional drugs is that they are metabolized locally by endogenous nucleases, confining their reactivity to the airways (review: [115]).",

The fact that EPI-2010 also reduced airway obstruction caused by house dust mite and histamine challenges supported the existence of an anti-inflammatory effect. In these animals, EPI-2010 was deposited throughout the lung, with no detectable systemic active metabolites, and was excreted primarily in the urine. This original study demonstrated that RASONs can be efficiently delivered to the peripheral lung, where they potently and selectively attenuate the expression of disease-associated genes. In primates, EPI-2010 attenuated the allergen responses to Ascaris lumbricoides for about 7 days, which corresponds to the kinetics of A1R expression.

Similar findings were obtained in OVA sensitized/challenged mice [121]. In addition, CGS21680 was found ten times more efficient than Budesonide [121], a corticosteroid currently prescribed to asthmatic patients (review: [122]). On the other hand, CGS21680 did not address OVA-induced bronchoconstriction or mucin secretion, as expected from the pharmacological properties of the A2AR (see 10.1007/978-94-007-1217-1_8 for details). And these doses caused significant hypotension in the anesthetized animals, which may limit the clinical utility (Table 9.2).\n",

This compound has a lower affinity for A1Rs and A2BRs (pKi \u2264 6) and shows relatively weak agonist activity at these receptors. In vitro assays demonstrated that GW328267X inhibits neutrophil and eosinophil activities (oxidative stress and degranulation), which are antagonized by an A2AR antagonist, CGS15943. However, GW328267X also binds A3Rs (pKi = 7.8) as a competitive antagonist. Hence, GW328267X activates A2ARs and blocks A3R-mediated responses equally well. Since A3Rs mediate neutrophil elastase secretion [125], this drug would offer additional protection as a blocker of this receptor.",

Intranasal GW328267X also produced a small, but significant, reduction of inflammatory marker concentrations in the BAL fluid (tryptase and eosinophil cationic protein), while Fluticasone normalized the concentrations of eosinophil cationic protein and neutrophil chemoattractant IL-8.

In sickle cell disease, misshapen erythrocytes trigger transient episodes of microvascular ischemia-reperfusion, which reduces the baseline lung functions and maintains lung inflammation. Therefore, they used the murine model of sickle cell disease, NY1DD mice, to test Stedivaze. In these mice, continuous infusion of Stedivaze (10 ng/mg/min) initiated a dose-dependent improvement of the baseline lung functions, which reached maximal efficacy within 3 days [136]. In the NY1DD mice subjected to hypoxia-reperfusion, stedivaze added at the onset of reperfusion prevented further lung injury. This study supports the potential of stedivaze for the treatment of the lung inflammation caused by recurrent ischemia-reperfusion in sickle cell disease. On the other hand, this study did not document the impact the circulating A2AR agonist on blood pressure, which is a major concern for this class of bioagent.",

Since 2007, more than 30 studies have been published on this ligand. This section reviews only those addressing the impact of ATL313 on lung injury and inflammation. Linden\u2019s group conducted a series of ex vivo and in vivo experiments to test whether the vascular administration of ATL313 protects the lungs against ischemia-reperfusion injury, which remains a major complication after organ transplant. In the first study, they used isolated, buffer-perfused murine lungs to determine whether the therapeutic potential of ATL313 targets the resident cells [139]. Their model of ischemia-reperfusion significantly impaired pulmonary functions (higher airway resistance and pulmonary artery pressure, lower compliance), caused extensive tissue injury (vascular leakage and edema) and lung inflammation (BAL levels of TNF\u03b1, KC, MIP-2 and RANTES). These lung complications were all significantly attenuated by a bolus dose of ATL313 (30 nM) added to the perfusate at the onset of reperfusion. This dose had no significant effect on the lung functions or hemodynamics of control animals. The specificity of the receptor agonist was demonstrated using lung isolated from A2AR\u2212/\u2212 mice, which showed no reduction in lung complications in response to ATL313. The fact that vascular ATL313 attenuated lung inflammation in the absence of circulating blood reiterates the critical role of the A2AR for the maintenance endothelial barrier integrity (see 10.1007/978-94-007-1217-1_8, Fig. 8.1). As such, ATL313 administered intravenous before the surgical procedure may significantly improve the outcome of lung transplant.",

Therefore, experiments were conducted to determine the relative potency of ATL313 using isolated, blood-perfused lungs infused with a selective agonist/antagonist of the A1R (CCPA/DCPCX), the A2AR (ATL313/ZM241385) or the A3R (IB-MECA/MRS1191) during reperfusion [140]. As expected, all receptor agonists significantly improved the lung functions (increased compliance and oxygenation, and decreased pulmonary artery pressure), reduced edema and inflammation (BAL levels of neutrophil myeloperoxidase and TNF\u03b1), compared to the untreated animals. When each agonist was paired with its antagonist, the protective effects were lost. More importantly, the ATL313 treatment improved lung functions and reduced neutrophil recruitment more efficiently than the A1R and A3R agonists, supporting a superior protective effect during lung transplant. In another study, these authors used the same protocol to show that the addition of ATL313 1 h before ischemia offers the same degree of protection [141]. Together, these studies suggest that ATL-313 infusion before, or at the time of transplant, may protect the lungs against the development of injury and rejection. Incidentally, this drug was reported to improve the outcome of organ islet transplant [142], supporting broad applications for clinical transplantation.",

Based on BAL neutrophil myeloperoxidase activity and immunohistochemistry, ATL313 was also shown to inhibit the infiltration of neutrophils and CD4+ T cells during reperfusion. It is common knowledge that the number of circulating neutrophils is regulated by IL-17A, a cytokine released by the CD4+ T lymphocytes (review: [145]). The mice subjected to ischemia-reperfusion, after depletion of the CD4+ T cells or neutrophils, had significantly reduced lung injury, but ATL313 did not provide additional protection. In contrast, the BAL fluid levels of IL-17, KC, MCP-1, MIP-1 and RANTES were significantly lower in the neutrophil- and CD4+ T cell-depleted mice, but only further reduced by ATL313 in the neutrophil-depleted mice.

In isolated, blood-perfused rabbit lungs subjected to 18 h of cold ischemia, the addition of CF101 before reperfusion improved lung compliance and oxygenation, without affecting arterial pressure [140]. With respect to the inflammatory mediators measured in the BAL fluid, the A3R agonist reduced TNF\u03b1 concentrations by 50% and neutrophil myeloperoxidase activity by 30%. Acute lung injury, quantified in terms of vascular leakage and edema, was also significantly lower in the animals treated with CF101. This study highlights the pleitropic protective effects of intravenous CF101 against acute lung inflammation and injury initiated by episodes of ischemia-reperfusion. Interestingly, Methotrexate was recently shown to enhance the anti-inflammatory effects of CF101 by causing an up-regulation of the A3R on monocytes and macrophages [161], which could offer additional clinical benefits for the treatment of acute lung injury.",

The presence of systemic CF101 during reperfusion significantly reduced the acute lung injury (% injured alveoli, wet/dry weight ratio) and apoptosis (TdT-mediated dUTP nick-end labeling positive cells and caspase 3 activity). Using selective inhibitors, the protective effects of CF101 were found to require ATP-sensitive K+ channels, but not nitric oxide production [163]. The signaling pathways activated by CF101 were identified by monitoring the expression of major protein kinases by SDS-PAGE and Western blot analysis of lung tissue specimens [162]. The A3R agonist induced a gradual up-regulation of the extracellular signal-regulated kinases 1 and 2 (ERK1/2), but not the c-Jun amino-terminal protein kinase (JNK) or p38. Injection of a selective A3R antagonist (MRS1191), before CF101, abolished the response of ERK1/2 without affecting p38 and JNK. These data suggest that the CF101-A3R signals are mediated predominantly by the ERK1/2-dependent pathways. However, A3Rs have been reported to regulate apoptosis via other signaling cascades, such as the phosphoinositide-3 kinase (PI3K)-dependent pathway (review: [157]). Therefore, future studies should verify the impact of selective ERK1/2 inhibitors on the acute lung injury and inflammation caused by ischemia-reperfusion.",

In accordance with the barrier protective role of A3Rs during acute lung injury (see 10.1007/978-94-007-1217-1_8 for details), CF102 suppressed the LPS-induced vascular leakage in wild-type mice. One foreseeable side-effect of intraperitoneal CF102 is the enhancement of neutrophil migration speed (review: [166]). Nonetheless, the ligand did not affect the leukocyte counts in the pulmonary vasculature in the control and LPS-exposed animals.",

The immediate responses to in vivo ischemia-reperfusion were inflammation, apoptosis and edema, restricted to the left lobe subjected to ischemia. After 27 h of reperfusion, this lobe became more edematous, with evidence of hypoxemia, but exhibited less apoptosis and no change in inflammation. The control perfused right lobe presented edema after 27 h, suggesting a systemic effect of ischemia-reperfusion. The animals treated with one bolus dose of CF502, added to the left lobe perfusate during ischemia, developed milder inflammation and injury during at least 27 h of reperfusion. In addition, CF502 further reduced the parameters of apoptosis from the 3 h, to the 27 h, reperfusion time-point. Finally, this treatment also protected the lungs against the increase in blood pressure caused by ischemia-reperfusion.

However, a subset of asthmatic patients exhibit violent allergic reactions to this common drug (review: [168]). Aspirin-intolerant asthma, also known as ASA-exacerbated respiratory disease, is associated with aspirin-induced BHR and a severe eosinophilic inflammation of the upper and lower airways, which maintains chronic rhinitis, sinusitis and polyposis. This disease is caused by an aberrant metabolism of arachidonic acid (review: [169]). The two products, prostaglandins and leukotrienes, bind to specific cell surface G protein-coupled receptors to orchestrate airway defenses. Prostaglandins stimulate mucociliary clearance, inhibit the development of fibrosis and the activities of inflammatory cells. In contrast, leukotrienes promote the recruitment and activation of inflammatory cells, mucus secretion, vascular permeability, fibrosis and bronchoconstriction. In aspirin-intolerant asthmatic patients, the metabolic balance of arachidonic acid is tilted toward leukotrienes, which leads to dramatic increases in the airway concentrations following ASA exposure (review: [170]). A recent clinical study suggests that ASA-induced leukotriene accumulation in exhaled breadth condensate may constitute a diagnostic tool to identify the aspirin-intolerant asthmatic patients [171].",

In this study, murine models of asthma were developed by intraperitoneal sensitization with OVA or OVA/LPS, followed by OVA challenges. Only the OVA/LPS-sensitized mice responded to intraperitoneal ASA by developing the aspirin-intolerant asthma phenotype of severe eosinophilia in the upper and lower tissue, and in BAL fluid. Since eosinophils represent <10% of all cells recruited to the airways, their response to ASA would be overlooked by total cell counts. Interestingly, ASA also caused a dramatic increase in lung ADO levels in the OVA/LPS mice. Expression analysis of the enzymes regulating ADO indicated that LPS selectively up-regulates ADA. This protective mechanism against excess ADO was obliterated by ASA. In addition, ASA-treated OVA/LPS mice accumulated lung IL-13, which has been shown to maintain an ADO/IL-13 amplification cycle by suppressing ADA expression (see 10.1007/978-94-007-1217-1_8 for details). These data predict that aspirin-intolerant asthmatic patients maintain higher airway ADO concentrations than the other asthmatics. This excess lung ADO, exacerbated by ASA, caused a down-regulation of Th17 responses via A1R and A3R engagement [173], which shifted the lung inflammation from a neutrophilic to an eosinophilic phenotype.",

This procedure stems from several in vitro studies showing that HS inhibits neutrophil degranulation. However, some patients respond to HS resuscitation by an exacerbation of the complications. In a murine model of hemorrhagic shock, an early HS resuscitation prevented lung tissue damage, whereas delayed treatment aggravated the complications [176].

With respect to A1Rs, the pharmaceutical industry understands the need to administer antagonists to suppress pulmonary inflammation (Table 9.1). The first two compounds developed, Theophylline and Bamiphylline, are currently available as oral prescriptions for asthmatic and COPD patients. On the other hand, the nebulized antisense oligodeoxynucleotide, EPI-2010, designed to remain in the airways to address BHR presented no clinical benefit in clinical trials. The story of Theophylline discovery tells us that the bronchodilating properties of the drug were mediated by the non-specific inhibition of phosphodiesterase. While in vitro and animal studies support a role for A1Rs in BHR, the importance of this mechanism in human subjects remains to be determined. With respect to A2ARs, everyone agrees on the benefits of selective agonists, but dosages which avoid cardiovascular side-effects (i.e. hypotension) were shown ineffective in the clinical trials, regardless of the selectivity or affinity of the compound (Table 9.2). On the other hand, these agonists hold promises for the reduction of lung complications resulting from cardiopulmonary bypass or lung transplant. The three A2BR antagonists selected for clinical evaluation all remain in the pipeline and the choice of oral delivery is consistent with the need to preserve A2BR-mediated airway clearance (Table 9.3). Finally, the highly controversial A3R is targeted for the development of selective agonists, which appear to provide effective anti-inflammatory protection for various disorders, including arthritis and psoriasis. Given the recent success of these drugs in animal models of lung disorders, clinical testing should be on the horizon.",

Their original work showed that the endogenous selective agonist, UTP, is highly unstable on human airway surfaces [180]. Therefore, they turned to dinucleotides because the tertiary structure offers more stability to the phosphate chain. From this first round of synthesis, they selected the potent P2Y2R agonist: Up4U (INS365; diquafosol). This molecule was further stabilized by substituting one uridine moiety by a deoxycytidine, which generated dCP4U (INS37217; denufosol) [180, 181]. The affinity of denufosol for the P2Y2R (EC50 = 0.3 \u03bcM) is over five times higher than for the other P2 receptors activated by uridine-based agonists on airway epithelia, namely the P2Y4R (EC50 = 1.2 \u03bcM) and the P2Y6R (EC50 = 16.0 \u03bcM) [181]. Preclinical studies demonstrated that denufosol restores normal surface hydration on cultures of human airway epithelial cells from CF patients, and also improves MCC in animals with impaired clearance [180, 181].",

We have reached a point where we can learn from success stories and failures to refine our drug development strategies. For instance, we heard about the potential of the \u201clow-hanging fruits\u201d, like Adagen (PEG-ADA) initially developed for ADA-SCID. The tale of the A1R antagonist, Theophylline, shows how revisiting the properties of an inefficient bronchodilator lead to the discovery of a well-tolerated anti-inflammatory drug currently prescribed to asthmatics, in combination with a \u03b2-adrenergic bronchodilator. While A2AR agonists were once perceived as the most promising anti-inflammatory drugs for chronic respiratory diseases, the frequent reports of cardiovascular side-effects are redirecting these compounds toward surgical applications, to prevent the hypertension and acute lung injury resulting from ischemia-reperfusion. Our gaze is turned toward A2BR antagonists for the suppression of airway hyperresponsiveness. Furthermore, animal studies suggest that long-term treatments could reverse airway remodeling and fibrosis in chronic airway diseases. Finally, clinical trials support the benefits of A3R agonists for inflammatory disorders and acute lung injury. Therapeutic applications for ATP receptor ligands are also emerging. For instance, denufosol has entered the final stage of clinical evaluation for the improvement of P2Y2R-mediated airway clearance in CF patients. And animal studies suggest that P2X7R antagonists may suppress the production of the \u201cfirst wave\u201d pro-inflammatory mediator, IL-1\u03b2, as well as tissue damage by apoptosis. In conclusion, we are clearly witnessing the maturation of a young field of clinical research which will, no doubt, continue to fascinate and surprise us for years to come.",
