Covid-19 pneumonia is defined by a positive result for SARS-CoV-2 on a reverse-transcriptasepolymerase-chain-reaction (RT-PCR) assay of a specimen collected from the upper or lower respiratory tract together with radiological features of pneumonia and clinical features of hypoxaemia and dyspnoea. Although more than 80% of patients with Covid-19 infection have mild disease and make a full recovery, a significant proportion of patients progress to pneumonia, and about half of these cases will develop severe acute respiratory syndrome (ARDS). Initial reports from China suggested that age >65 years and medical comorbidities are risk factors for poor outcomes. (1) The need for ICU admission and mechanical ventilation once ARDS develops is associated with a high mortality, ranging from 39% to 72%.(2,3) Current guidelines recommend that corticosteroids or immunosuppressive therapy should not be used in patients with Covid-19 pneumonia unless there are other indications, such as shock, asthma or exacerbation of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.(4) However, the role of systemic corticosteroids is currently being re-evaluated in mechanically ventilated adults with ARDS, with some guidelines now suggesting their use. (5) We describe a case of a patient with Covid-19 infection, progressive pneumonia, development of a hyperinflammatory state and cytokine release syndrome (CRS) who was successfully treated with steroids and tocilizumab.",

He made an uneventful recovery and proceeded to travel to Austria on 29 February 2020. During his stay in Austria, he had contact with a Covid-19 positive individual and started developing upper respiratory symptoms on 7 March. On his return to South Africa on 8 March he had a fever, sore throat, dry cough, severe wheezing and worsening dyspnoea. At that stage a commercial test for Covid-19 PCR was not yet available to the private pathology laboratories and blood tests showed a normal full blood count and a C-reactive protein (CRP) of 16 mg/L. He was advised to self-isolate at home and was managed telephonically with bronchodilator nebulization, oral prednisone 30 mg daily for 5 days and paracetamol. By 11 March he was not feeling any better and had ongoing fever and cough. The Covid-19 PCR test had become available at that stage and his initial test with a private pathology laboratory was negative.",

This last phase is associated with worsening ARDS, multiorgan dysfunction syndrome (MODS), coagulation abnormalities, myocarditis and death. Patients progressing to this last severe phase of Covid-19 have clinical and laboratory evidence of an exaggerated inflammatory response, similar to the CRS, with persistent fever, worsening ARDS, elevated inflammatory markers and proinflammatory cytokines and MODS.",

            "text": "Although corticosteroids are not routinely recommended for the treatment of Covid-19-associated lung injury, CRS immunosuppression with corticosteroids and other therapies is likely to be beneficial. Although there are currently no controlled clinical trials on the use of corticosteroids in Covid-19 patients, several published reports of corticosteroid therapy in severe Covid-19 have shown a shorter duration of supplemental oxygen use, improved radiographic findings and lower mortality in patients with ARDS. (8, 9) Tocilizumab, an IL-6 receptor blocker registered for CRS treatment, is being investigated for the treatment of patients with severe Covid-19, CRS and elevated IL-6 levels. IL-6 plays an important role in CRS and tocilizumab binds specifically to both soluble and membrane-bound IL-6 receptors (sIL-6R and mIL-6R), inhibiting sIL-6R and mIL-6R-mediated signalling. Small observational studies support the concept that tocilizumab may be an effective drug for patients with severe Covid-19 and respiratory failure requiring mechanical ventilation. (10, 11) In a study of 21 patients with Covid-19-related ARDS who received tocilizumab, the ICU mortality was less than 5%, all surviving patients became apyrexial within 72 h, pulmonary infiltrates on follow-up CT scan improved in 90%, hypoxaemia resolved in the majority and 90.5% of patients were discharged from the ICU after a median of 13.5 days. (12) A large randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled phase 3 clinical trial to evaluate the safety and efficacy of tocilizumab plus standard of care in hospitalised adult patients with severe Covid-19 pneumonia and ARDS has been being initiated. (13) Currently, tocilizumab is available in South Africa for patients with severe Covid-19 and ARDS under the Monitored Emergency use of Unregistered and Investigational Interventions framework.(14) This requires the treating physician to consult with an expert panel prior to enrolment, detailed patient data collection and ensuring that the patient meets the strict inclusion and exclusion criteria. Other immune modulating agents under investigation include siltuximab (IL-6 inhibitor), bevacizumab (vascular endothelial growth factor inhibitor), convalescent plasma from patients who have recovered from SARS-CoV-2 infection and intravenous immune globulin (Polygam). (15, 16) This case study also highlights some of the many controversies and complications in managing patients with severe Covid-19:",

Individuals taking long-term corticosteroids for chronic conditions such as asthma, allergies and arthritis may be unable to mount an appropriate immune response and are generally considered high risk for severe disease if infected with Corticosteroids can also result in increased viral replication and prolonged viral shedding. Even a short course of oral corticosteroids in the preceding month for an asthma exacerbation, such as in this case study, is a risk factor for ARDS and mechanical ventilation. ( , or QTc increases >60 ms from baseline after initiating drug therapy, discontinue azithromycin and lopinavir/ritonavir, and consider reducing dose of chloroquine. Frequent monitoring of QTc is mandatory and chloroquine should also be discontinued if QTc remains >500 ms. The risk of serious ventricular arrhythmia may be reduced by performing a screening ECG prior to initiation of therapy, inquiring about a personal or family history of QT interval prolongation or sudden unexplained cardiac death, avoiding exposure to other medications known to affect QT interval, and aggressively treating hypocalcaemia, hypokalaemia and hypomagnesaemia. Hypokalaemia is especially common in patients with Covid-19 and is associated with a poorer prognosis.
