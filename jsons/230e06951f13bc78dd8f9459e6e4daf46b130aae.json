Sixty-two patients who experienced the onset of SARS symptoms during the period from 18 March 18 2003 through 30 March 2003 were recruited. All patients had pneumonia and positive SARS-associated coronavirus (SARS-CoV) seroconversion. The mean age (\u202b\u05e2\u202cSD) was 37.07 \u202b\u05e2\u202c 12.96 years, the ratio of male subjects to female subjects was 0.82, and the intubation rate was 9.6%. In this cohort, 90.3% of patients received treatment with ribavirin and corticosteroids [1] . The median interval (\u202b\u05e2\u202cSD) between the onset of SARS symptoms and the first follow-up visit was weeks. 6.59 \u202b\u05e2\u202c 1.07",

The finding of abnormal lactate dehydrogenase levels may imply that patients still had not fully recovered from SARSrelated tissue damage at the first followup visit. We should not overlook the effect of therapy with ribavirin and corticosteroids, which might have contributed to the symptoms and to the abnormal laboratory values. Physicians providing care to pa-tients with SARS during the convalescent period should be aware of the possibility of such abnormal findings.",
