The mean number of cases generated by each case (R0) was sampled from a uniform distribution once per model simulation with a lower and upper bound determined by the scenario being evaluated. New generations of cases were then sampled iteratively until the maximum simulation time was reached.

Both SARS-like serial interval scenarios used a Weibull distribution, whilst the MERS-like serial interval scenario used a Gamma distribution 5, 6 . After the simulation of the branching process, reporting delays were added as reported in a line-list of cases compiled from media and other reports 7 . We fitted a geometric, Poisson, and a negative binomial distribution to these observed delays and selected the best fit using the Chi-squared statistic.

More data on the serial interval distribution, on variability of transmission and possible superspreading events, as well as on the timing and impact of interventions, is likely to become available during the course of the outbreak. This will make it possible to estimate the R0 with greater precision with less risk of bias due to unknown parameters. The number of scenarios that need to be evaluated may also be reduced as additional information about cases connected to the initial exposure event becomes available. Though our estimates had wide credible intervals it is possible that we could not fully account for the numerous sources of bias and uncertainty present in the available data. This means that our model estimates may be both spuriously precise and potentially biased. There is some evidence of this in our results as the scenarios with the highest acceptance rate were on the edge of our scenario grid both for event size, event duration, and mean serial interval. This may be the result of these scenarios reducing volatility and therefore having narrower distributions of estimated cases. Indeed, we found that R0 estimates were comparable as event size decreased and event duration increased.

(for example, by one-two sentences in their introduction).My main concern comes from the fact that the ending time (31st of December 2019) was fixed in the simulation, but the starting moment was in range between 1-28 days. In my opinion this scenario misses the very important one: what if there was a short-term exposure around the end of November -beginning of December that followed by a human-to-human transmission chain? At least, the epicurve published earlier in Lancet might suggest such scenario, and also an unofficial article published in FT proposed something similar. In this regard I would also recommend to consider the fixed starting time, but varied length of the exposure. I wonder if the conclusions of the authors could be changed in this case.The transmission event size looks a bit large, and I had the feeling that the authors was a bit biased in their desire to obtain R0 around 2-3. In this, regard, why not to provide some information on R0 estimates for small enough values of the event size. For example, if I consider, say, the size of 5 or size of 2? How unlikely would be the resulting estimate? I think it could be possible to have also big values of R0 at the beginning.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Scenario analysis"}, {"text": "Are sufficient details of methods and analysis provided to allow replication by others?

Using a stochastic branching process model, the authors find that the observed outbreak is most compatible with a large initial transmission event, a SARS-like serial interval, and an R0 between 2 and 4. What I particularly like about the study -and what distinguishes it from some of the other modelling papers -is the addition of reporting delays to the simulated case counts.While the modelling approach is sound, a couple of things about the simulation procedure remain somewhat unclear:The authors write that \"The start date was determined by combining the duration of the transmission event with the date the fish market in Wuhan, the source of the outbreak, closed (31st of December 2019).\" How exactly was the start date determined? The start date is actually one of the most crucial aspects of the analysis, and it is not reported in the text.The authors write that they either use a parametric description of the reporting delay or sample from the empirical delays. Does this mean that they use different delays at different times during the outbreak?Overall, I think that the study would gain from discussing the recent literature on the outbreak dynamics ", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Institute of Social and Preventive Medicine (ISPM), University of Bern, Bern, Switzerland"}, {"text": "If applicable, is the statistical analysis and its interpretation appropriate?", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Are sufficient details of methods and analysis provided to allow replication by others?
