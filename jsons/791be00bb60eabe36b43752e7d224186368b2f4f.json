The Lancet Oncology recently published an editorial [2] which describes the many clouds that are gathering on the world of oncology. The author concludes stating \"ultimately, the situation might lead to substantial changes in how research and medicine are practiced in the future, such as reduced international travel and increased remote networking and telemedicine\". In a recent paper from Marano et al. [3] it is described their perspective on the management of cancer patient prior the admission and during the surgical procedures.",

More than 300 patients/years are discussed and a shared decision about treatment is taken. Since March 9, 2020, when our Government decided to prohibit meetings in order to contain the spreading of COVID-19, our MDT was interrupted for two consecutive weeks. After an initial briefing, we transformed our MDT into a \"Smart-MDT\", using a dedicated oncology platform \"The NAVIFY\u00ae Tumor Board\" (Roche Diagnostics Information Solutions; Belmont, CA) [4] (Fig. 1) This new platform is a cloud-based service where every clinician can insert any patient's record in a single \"file\" needed for the multidisciplinary discussion, which guarantee a continuous and cohesive data gathering contrarily to separate file from every single specialty; everything is available to every member of the MDT prior to convening. It also allows to have a detailed record for every step the patient undergoes from the beginning of his treatment. After all the data gathering, the software generates a slideshow with a one-click procedure.",
