All members of this order encode the large (L) polymerase protein which has six highly conserved regions (\u201cdomains\u201d) postulated to be responsible for the specific enzymatic activities of the viral polymerase complex which include viral genome replication, transcription, mRNA 5\u2032 capping, cap methylation and 3\u2032 polyadenylation. Currently, there is no structural data available for the entire L or any region of L. However, site-directed mutagenesis and computational analyses support the multifunctional nature of the L protein as targeted amino acid substitutions in the different L domains were able to inactivate individual functions of viral polymerase (Cartee et al., 2003, Cortese et al., 2000, Grdzelishvili et al., 2005, Li et al., 2005, Li et al., 2008, Ogino and Banerjee, 2010, Ogino et al., 2010, Poch et al., 1990, Schnell and Conzelmann, 1995, Sidhu et al., 1993, Sleat and Banerjee, 1993, Smallwood et al., 2002).",

            "text": "Similarly to eukaryotic mRNA, most of Mononegavirales synthesize mRNA containing a 5\u2032 cap structure methylated at the guanine-N7 (G-N-7) and 2\u2032-O-adenosine (2\u2032-O) positions. The caps are required for mRNA stability, and cap methylation, especially at G-N-7 position, is required for efficient mRNA translation (Gingras et al., 1999, Horikami et al., 1984, Horikami and Moyer, 1982). The methyltransferase (MTase) activity was originally mapped to the L protein following the characterization of two vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV, family Rhabdoviridae) host range (hr) mutants. These mutants exhibited severe defects in cap methylation (Horikami et al., 1984, Horikami and Moyer, 1982), but this function was successfully complemented with purified wild type (wt) L protein in vitro, demonstrating that L possesses the viral mRNA MTase activities (Hercyk et al., 1988). More recently, computational analyses predicted that the L protein domain VI has a typical 2\u2032-O MTase fold and identified a putative K-D-K-E catalytic tetrad and a glycine-rich motif (GxGxG) as the putative AdoMet binding site (Bujnicki and Rychlewski, 2002, Ferron et al., 2002, Martin and McMillan, 2002). These predictions were experimentally confirmed by several studies with the VSV L protein leading to the identification of the amino acid residues important for cap methylation within domain VI (Galloway et al., 2008, Grdzelishvili et al., 2005, Li et al., 2005, Li et al., 2006). Grdzelishvili et al. (2005) showed that one of the VSV hr mutants, hr1, had a single substitution D to V within the glycine-rich motif (GDGSG in VSV) and was completely defective in cap methylation. Further site-directed mutagenesis of the glycine-rich motif and putative K-D-K-E catalytic tetrad by Li et al., 2005, Li et al., 2006 showed that they are important for mRNA cap methylation at both the G-N-7 and 2\u2032-O positions. Most of previous studies suggest that the L protein uses a single AdoMet binding site for both G-N-7 and 2\u2032-O MTase activity, and that, at least in VSV, 2\u2032-O methylation precedes G-N-7 methylation (Rahmeh et al., 2009, Testa and Banerjee, 1977).",

            "text": "While most of the cap methylation studies were conducted using VSV, limited studies using Sendai virus (SeV, family Paramyxoviridae) demonstrated similarities as well as differences in the cap methylation between these two distantly related viruses. SeV produces mRNA that is capped and methylated at both the G-N-7 and 2\u2032-O positions (Takagi et al., 1995), but interestingly, purified SeV L protein or just its C-terminal portion retaining domain VI, catalyzed only G-N-7, but not the 2\u2032-O cap methylation (Ogino et al., 2005). In both VSV and SeV, alanine substitutions of the lysine upstream of the glycine-rich motif (also the first lysine of a putative K-D-K-E catalytic tetrad) led to cap methylation defects in these two viruses (Li et al., 2006, Murphy and Grdzelishvili, 2009). However, while alanine substitutions at the first two positions of the glycine-rich motif (G1804 and G1806) had little effect on MTase activity in SeV (Murphy and Grdzelishvili, 2009), in VSV the substitutions at the homologous glycine positions G1670 and G1672 affected cap methylation at either the G-N-7 or both the 2\u2032-O and G-N-7 positions (Li et al., 2006). Studies with VSV also identified a region upstream of domain VI important for cap methylation (Grdzelishvili et al., 2006). Interestingly, the recent study showed that VSV tolerates an insertion of GFP gene between domain VI and this upstream region, and a recombinant virus with such insertion showed a normal growth in cell culture but no virion-associated activity in vitro (Ruedas and Perrault, 2009). The upstream region has not been studied in SeV as there is no homology in this variable region between rhabdoviruses and paramyxoviruses, although the L protein of measles virus (a paramyxovirus) was also reported to tolerate GFP insertion in a region just upstream of domain VI (Duprex et al., 2002).",

The L mutations were analyzed in the context of infectious mutant viruses for their effect on viral mRNA cap methylation and virus growth in vitro, and we found a good correlation between attenuation in cell culture and defects in MTase activity for most of SeV mutants. Our analysis experimentally confirms previous computational predictions suggesting the importance of the glycine-rich motif and K-D-K-E tetrad in cap methylation across different families of the order Mononegavirales. In addition, the majority of L mutants were tested for their ability to synthesize viral mRNA and replicate viral genomic RNA. This study is the first detailed analysis of the L protein domain VI in the family Paramyxoviridae.",

In this work, we analyzed the entire domain VI of SeV in more detail, targeting the residues highly conserved in most members of the order Mononegavirales (Fig. 1\n). In addition to targeting the glycine-rich motif (the putative AdoMet binding site) and the putative catalytic tetrad K-D-K-E, which also is conserved in other known 2\u2032-O MTases including NS5 protein of flaviviruses (Fig. 1), we also targeted residues D1799 and Y1802 located just upstream of the glycine-rich motif and conserved only in some paramyxoviruses (Fig. 1). Many classes of MTases of known structure contain either a conserved aspartate or glutamate, or a tyrosine residue within the beta strand that precedes the conserved glycine-rich motif, but rarely do they contain both these residues. A polar residue in this position has been implicated in reaction mechanism as the fifth catalytic entity (Kozbial and Mushegian, 2005), and we were interested in determining whether one or both of these amino acids may play a functional role in SeV MTase. We also targeted the DKDK sequence located immediately upstream of the residue D1799. Although this DKDKD sequence is present only in some paramyxoviruses, we wanted to determine whether such high concentration of aspartates and lysines and its close proximity to the glycine-rich motif may play some role in cap methylation catalysis. In addition to single amino acid substitutions, several double and triple alanine substitutions were created, and the glycines within the glycine-rich motif were changed to leucines to address a possibility that this motif, while important for cap methylation in SeV, is more tolerant to single glycine-to-alanine substitutions as compared to VSV. All told, twenty-four L mutant genes were generated in the context of the pGEM-L vector with the L gene under control of the T7 promoter for their analysis using VVT7 system (see below). In addition, we cloned these mutations into a SeV full-length antigenomic plasmid, and we were able to generate 19 infectious SeV mutants using a reverse genetics system (Table 1\n). Infectious virus particles could not be recovered for the remaining five mutant L genes (indicated as NR in Table 1).",

Infectious foci were visualized by crystal violet staining or IF at 48 or 72 h p.i. Several mutants behaved similarly to rWT, while some mutants had obvious defects in growth based on their inability to form visible infectious foci (Fig. 2A). All of the mutants with the substitutions between positions 1795 and 1800 (DKDKDR) were capable of forming visible infectious foci and grew to rWT-like titers (Fig. 2A and Table 1). The rG1804A, rE1805A, rG1806A mutants and the double-mutant rG1804A/G1806A behaved as in our previous report (Murphy and Grdzelishvili, 2009), i.e., they showed similar growth to rWT. Even the rE1805A mutant, which had a slight delay in growth, still grew to high titers. Additional alanine mutants in or around glycine-rich motif behaved with minor variations: the rG1808A and especially the triple mutant rG1804A/G1806A/G1808A had smaller than rWT infectious foci, but grew to a high titer (1.4 \u00d7 108\n CIU/ml), and the rY1802A mutant had small infectious foci 48 h p.i. but at 72 h p.i. had foci size and titer similar to rWT (Fig. 2B). In contrast to these mutants, leucine substitutions had dramatic effect on virus growth: E1805L and G1808L could not be recovered despite all effort; rG1804L was dramatically attenuated in Vero cells and infectious foci could only be detected by IF (Fig. 2C); and rG1806L was severely attenuated in cell culture, and even after several passages on Vero cells, titers remained extremely low (< 102\n CIU/ml) (Fig. 2C and Table 1). Thus, the GxGxG motif, which in the cases of homologous MTases with the known structure is invariably located in the loop between the first beta strand and the alpha helix of the Rossmann fold, tolerates substitutions to small side chain residue such as alanine, but the bulkier aliphatic side chain of leucine appears incompatible with the structure or function of this region. The rules for E1805 were similar: negative charge turned out to be unimportant for virus viability, even though this residue is conserved in all Mononegavirales, but a bulky aliphatic leucine residue was not tolerated.",

Interestingly, after sequencing, the K1938 position mutant had a substitution to serine and not alanine. This serine substitution apparently has been selected in vivo, as the input plasmids used for virus recovery were confirmed by sequencing to have the alanine substitution. In addition to targeting the K-D-K-E tetrad, we created alanine mutants of two other positions invariant in Mononegavirales, S1777 and E1903, and a double mutant, rK1938A/I1939L.

They form a semi-circle on the outer rim of the AdoMet binding pocket and are thought to work together in transferring the methyl group from that donor to the 5\u2032 nucleotides of virus mRNA, though exact role of each residue, as well as the details of the reaction mechanism (and indeed, the native three-dimensional structures of MTases of Mononegavirales), remain to be investigated. Residues S1777 and E1903 are predicted to be further outwards from the AdoMet binding pocket, and may be expected not to interact with the methyl donor, but rather perhaps play a role in recognition of the RNA substrate.

This normalization was done to account for variability in overall transcription levels between different viruses (Table 1, columns 3 and 4).

However, to confirm that [3H]-labeled SeV mRNA (Table 1) had methylated cap structure, we analyzed [3H]-AdoMet labeled mRNA generated as described above, using tobacco acid pyrophosphatase (TAP) (Fig. 4\n). TAP is commonly used to specifically remove the 5\u2032-terminal guanosine monophosphate from the cap of mRNA, while uncapped mRNA cannot serve as a substrate for the TAP (Shinshi et al., 1976). In addition to SeV mRNA, we used three different control mRNAs (described in detail in Materials and methods): i) [3H]-AdoMet labeled VSV mRNA generated using detergent-activated wt VSV virions using in vitro transcription conditions identical to SeV; ii) synthetic SeV NP mRNA containing Cap 0 (m7GpppA...) structure labeled with [3H] at the G-N-7 position, and iii) synthetic SeV NP mRNA containing Cap 1 structure (m7Gppp[m2\u2032-O]A...) labeled with [3H]-AdoMet only at the 2\u2032-O position (2\u2032-O methylated by the vaccinia virus enzyme). For TAP analysis, all these mRNAs were normalized by [3H] counts and digested by TAP (or mock-treated using the same conditions by without TAP). Fig. 4 shows [3H] counts associated with the released 5\u2032-terminal G (\u201cm7G\u201d) or with mRNA after TAP treatment and separation using Sephadex G-50 columns. As expected, TAP treatment did not affect an association of [3H] with the synthetic mRNA having Cap 1 structure (m7Gppp[m2\u2032-O]A...) but labeled only at the 2\u2032-O position, but resulted in the release of [3H]-m7G from the synthetic Cap 0 mRNA labeled at the G-N-7 position (Fig. 4), confirming that TAP specifically hydrolyzed the phosphoric acid anhydride bonds in the triphosphate bridge of the cap structure. Importantly, TAP treatment clearly resulted in the release of [3H]-m7G from SeV mRNA produced by determent-activated virions in vitro, indicating that SeV mRNA was at least partially methylated at the G-N-7 position. A similar result was obtained for VSV virion-produced mRNA, which is consistent with the previous studies demonstrating that the fully methylated VSV mRNA has Cap 1 structure (Abraham et al., 1975, Rahmeh et al., 2009, Testa and Banerjee, 1977).",

Fig. 4 shows that TAP released more [3H]-m7G from SeV mRNA than from VSV mRNA, and similar amounts of [3H]-m7G were released from SeV mRNA and the synthetic Cap 0 mRNA, which could indicate that SeV was methylated exclusively at the G-N-7 position. However, it would be premature to make this conclusion based solely on the TAP experiments. Thus, we did not observe a complete removal of [3H]-m7G from the synthetic Cap 0 mRNA labeled only at G-N-7 position, indicating that under our experimental conditions TAP was only about 50% effective in hydrolyzing triphosphate bridges. Furthermore, mRNA products analyzed in Fig. 4 were normalized by [3H] counts. However, it is likely that the efficiency of cap methylation is different for SeV, VSV and vaccinia virus MTases and, therefore, different molar amounts of capped mRNA were likely present in these reactions further complicating conclusions about cap structure. Further studies using alternative biochemical assays are needed to determine cap structure of SeV mRNA produced under our experimental conditions, although a dramatic improvement in our in vitro transcription conditions is needed to obtain sufficient amounts of viral mRNA for cap analysis.",

All combinations grew to titers comparable to supernatant collected from Vero cells infected with rWT only with the exception of K1938S and K1938A/I1939L which had 99% lower titers for rWT (rWT foci can be easily discriminated from those generated by mutants due to their significantly larger size and earlier appearance). We then compared growth kinetics of two mutants, K1938S and K1782A in combination with rWT by infecting Vero cells and collecting supernatants at 18\u201372 h p.i. Similar to our titration experiments (Fig. 6A), K1782A when combined with rWT had similar growth kinetics to rWT alone while K1938S in combination with rWT had delayed growth and lower maximal titers (Fig. 6B), indicating that cap methylation defect alone is not sufficient for the interference of rK1938S and rK1938A/I1939L with rWT replication and that some additional factors are involved in the dominant-negative phenotype of these SeV mutants.",

            "text": "At this time, we cannot explain why viruses containing amino acid substitution at the L position 1938 interfere with rWT replication. One possibility is that such inhibition may simply reflect elevated levels of DI particles generated by these mutants. To test this hypothesis, we infected Vero cells again (as in Fig. 6A), collected cells and the medium at 48 h p.i. Consistent with Fig. 6A, both rK1938S and rK1938A/I1939L inhibited production of rWT as was determined by titration of the collected medium on fresh Vero cells (Fig. 6B). For analysis of RNA synthesized during superinfection, both collected supernatants and cells were analyzed by Northern blot as described in Materials and methods. To detect DI genomes, a probe complimentary to the first 54 5\u2032-nucleotides of the SeV genomic RNA was used, which should be able to detect full-length genomic RNA of SeV as well as DI genomes independent on the mechanism of their generation. As shown in Fig. 6D, we were unable to detect any DI genomes in Vero cells under our experimental conditions. Interestingly, despite clear inhibition of SeV rWT virion production (Figs. 6A\u2013C), we did not see any statistically significant decrease in SeV NP mRNA accumulation in the superinfected cells (Fig. 6E) using a probe against coding NP gene sequences, although a modest decrease in the full-length genomic RNA (wt plus mutant) levels was observed (Fig. 6D, FL gRNA band). A similar lack of DI genomes and a very modest reduction in full-length genomic RNA levels was observed when virus particles from the medium were pelleted by ultracentrifugation, and RNA from these particles was analyzed by Northern blot as above (data not shown). Together, out data suggest that rK1938S and rK1938A/I1939L are able to over-compete rWT during superinfection and, while the mechanism is unclear, this effect is apparently DI-independent.",

            "text": "To analyze domain VI, we conducted site-directed mutagenesis targeting the residues highly conserved among Mononegavirales, including the K-D-K-E tetrad and glycine-rich motif, also present in the known 2\u2032-O cap MTases including NS5 protein of flaviviruses (Fig. 1) and nonstructural protein 16 of coronaviruses (Decroly et al., 2008). Similar to VSV, alanine substitutions in the putative K-D-K-E catalytic tetrad of SeV generated mutant viruses defective in cap methylation. The K-D-K-E tetrad was previously shown to catalyze a 2\u2032-O methyl transfer in the known 2\u2032-O MTases, including NS5 protein of flaviviruses (Bollati et al., 2009, Egloff et al., 2007, Ray et al., 2006, Selisko et al., 2010) and nonstructural protein 16 of coronaviruses (Bouvet et al., 2010, Decroly et al., 2008). In West Nile virus (WNV, a flavivirus), amino acid substitutions of the homologous residues abolished 2\u2032-O cap methylation by NS5 protein, but had only modest effect on G-N-7 methylation (Ray et al., 2006, Zhou et al., 2007). In VSV, similar substitutions abolished both G-N-7 and 2\u2032-O methylation (Li et al., 2005). This discrepancy between WNV and VSV can be explained by the different order of methylation events shown for flaviruses (GpppA \u2192 m7GpppA \u2192 m7Gppp[m2\u2032-O]A) (Zhou et al., 2007) and VSV (GpppA \u2192 GpppAm \u2192 m7Gppp[m2\u2032-O]A) (Li et al., 2006, Rahmeh et al., 2009, Testa and Banerjee, 1977). While the inactivation of 2\u2032-O methylation did not significantly affect G-N-7 methylation in WNV, it prevented it in VSV where 2\u2032-O methylation precedes and apparently facilitates subsequent G-N-7 methylation (Rahmeh et al., 2009). A high-resolution analysis of cap structure in SeV mRNA is still beyond our reach due to the more than 200-fold lower abundance of mRNA produced by SeV virion-associated L protein as compared to VSV (Murphy and Grdzelishvili, 2009). However, the critical importance of K-D-K-E tetrad for the overall cap methylation in SeV presented in this study may indicate that the SeV L protein catalyzes cap methylation using the same order as VSV (GpppA \u2192 GpppAm \u2192 m7Gppp[m2\u2032-O]A).",

For VSV, it was shown that virions with alanine substitutions at the first two glycines had decreased cap methylation, while alanine substitution at the third glycine did not affect MTase activity (Li et al., 2006). Here, we determined that the third glycine of the glycine-rich motif seems to play a more significant role in cap methylation in SeV than VSV, decreasing cap methylation by about 70% (compared to rWT). As further confirmation of the importance of this position, a triple mutant with all three glycines substituted to alanines also had low methylation levels (37% of rWT) while a double mutant with only the first two glycines substituted to alanines had rWT-like levels of growth and higher methylation. Our previous partial results showed so much tolerance to substitution in the first two glycines in the glycine-rich motif as to even doubt that this is a functional AdoMet binding site (Murphy and Grdzelishvili, 2009). Our data presented here, including the role of the third glycine in the SeV cap methylation and dramatic effect of glycine-to-leucine substitutions in this motif restore a more conventional view of the role of this conserved sequence motif.",

In several paramyxoviruses, just next to this residue there is a motif DKDKD1799 with potential importance in catalysis due to the high concentration of aspartates and lysines and its close proximity to the glycine-rich motif.

The majority of these mutants had substitutions in and around the putative K-D-K-E catalytic tetrad. In agreement with our recent study (Murphy and Grdzelishvili, 2009), we observed that alanine substitutions at positions in and around the glycine-rich motif were well tolerated; however, a triple mutant with all three glycines replaced with alanines did show slight attenuation, confirming the importance of this motif for SeV L function and virus replication. We also observed that two cap methylation defective mutants, rK1938S and rK1938A/I1939L, had strong interfering effect on replication of wt SeV during superinfection. Interestingly, another cap methylation defective mutant, rK1782A, did not interfere with rWT replication indicating that cap methylation defect alone is not sufficient for this dominant-negative mutant phenotype and that some additional factors are involved. Currently, we cannot explain how K1938S mutation could inhibit the growth of rWT and further studies are warranted to explore this interesting observation.",

However, when infectious virus particles, recovered using a reverse genetics system, were sequenced, the substitution was to serine rather than alanine. Based on the importance of this position in the catalytic tetrad, we speculate that the change to the polar serine residue led to a more favorable configuration of hydrogen bond network linking catalytic residues to AdoMet and perhaps additionally supporting proper conformation of the L protein, which may be important for its function. When tested in a VV-T7 in vitro transcription or replication systems, the K1938A mutant L had slightly lower transcription (\u223c 80%) and lower replication levels (\u223c 60%) as compared to rWT. Mutant virions with the K1938S substitution were defective in cap methylation (8% of rWT), but had high transcription levels (91% of rWT): apparently, a serine substitution is more favorable for the overall activity of the L protein (although not necessarily for cap methylation).",

For virus-driven expression of the bacteriophage T7 RNA polymerase, A549 cells were infected with T7-expressing vaccinia virus (VV-T7) (Fuerst et al., 1986). Recombinant wt (rWT) SeV (Fushimi strain) (Leyrer et al., 1998) was kindly provided by Dr. Wolfgang J. Neubert (Max-Planck-Institute of Biochemistry, Germany). SeV rWT or mutants were grown and purified as described in (Murphy and Grdzelishvili, 2009). SeV infectivity was measured by virus titration on Vero cells and expressed as cell infectious units/ml (CIU/ml). For faster growing SeV mutants, wells were stained with 0.1% Crystal Violet in 10% formalin for 10 min, washed with PBS and dried. An immunofluorescence (IF) assay was used for severely attenuated SeV mutants as described in (Murphy and Grdzelishvili, 2009).

Plaque assays were performed on Vero cells using supernatants collected at different time points. For superinfection experiments, virus infection foci were detected by IF as described above and in (Murphy and Grdzelishvili, 2009) or by 4 CN Peroxidase Substrate colorimetric staining (KPL).
