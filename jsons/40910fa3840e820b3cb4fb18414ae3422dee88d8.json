The daily peak of deaths (7270 (+/-500)) happened the 15 (+/-3) of April, meaning that we are in descending curve of the pandemic. The outbreak will end completely the 23 th (+/-3) of June. However, already on 9 th (+/-3) of May, 2 \uf073 (95.45%) of the deaths will have be occured. The projected death toll is much lower (5-10 times) than those forecasted by the Imperial College Group (ICG) even considering the best scenario of total suppression of virus transmission. Using actual mortality rates it is possible to back calculate which number of infected individuals would produce such mortality. The death toll arises from a number of infected individuals between 53 (worst case) and 3.3 million. The calculated number of infected individuals is significantly lower than that calculated by ICG (227.5 millions) with suppression.",

This could be to the fact that the number of susceptible contacts is decreasing (because all are already infected or recovered) or that the number of contacts is decreasing with time. A way to calculate the number of persons infected involves dividing by the rate of mortality (Rm = deaths/infected). However, Rm is not easily known because it would require knowing exactly the number of persons infected in all the countries involved, and such number depends on the testing capabilities and testing protocol. In Argentina, only individuals who show symptoms are tested, therefore asymptomatic infected individuals are not counted. Since different Rm values have been reported, the Rm reported by South Korea (0.5 %) was used to produce the high limit number and that of Italy (8 %) to calculate the lower limit. Using these assumptions, a worst case scenario of 53,050,000 (+/-10000) individuals should be infected.",
