We find an excess mortality that is correlated in time with the COVID-19 reported death rate time series, the latter lagging in time by about one week. Relative to the reported deaths by COVID-19, the overall excess mortality is significantly higher for many of the regions in Italy, and its age distribution is skewed towards people above 80 years of age. We estimate that the number of COVID-19 deaths in Italy is 47,000 \u00b1 2000 as of April 11 2020, more than a factor of 2 higher than the official number. We estimate the Population Fatality Rate (PFR), defined as the ratio of COVID-19 related deaths to the total population. It has reached 0.2% in the most affected region of Lombardia as of April 11, and 0.4% in the most affected province of Bergamo, which is also a lower bound to the Infection Fatality Rate (IFR). We estimate PFR as a function of age, finding a steep age dependence: in Lombardia (Bergamo province) 0.5% (1.1%) of total population in age group 70-79 died, 1.3% (3%) in age group 80-89, and 3% (7%) in the age group above 90. We combine this with the IFR estimate from the Princess Diamond cruise ship for ages above 70 to estimate the age dependent IFR which range from below 0.1% for ages below 50 years to 15% for ages above 90 years, with an overall IFR of 1.1% for Lombardia. Combining with the PFR, we estimate the infection rates (IR) of regions in Italy which peaks in Lombardia at 21% (10%-37%, 95% c.l.), and for provinces in Bergamo at 48% (24%-85%, 95% c.l.), corresponding to 2 Million and 0.5 Million infected people, respectively.",

A more stable quantification of the intrinsic mortality rate is characterized by the Infection Fatality Rate c (IFR), the knowledge of which is paramount to guide the public health response.

We attribute the difference between the true 2020 data and the predicted counterfactual as excess deaths due to . For robustness, we use two different methods of counterfactual analysis: a Conditional Mean Gaussian Process (CGP) 3 , which provides both the counterfactual estimate and its error, and the Synthetic Control Method (SCM) 4 .

As we have no way to quantify the error associated with this, we will use the most complete region (Lombardia, 80% complete) and province (Bergamo, 100% complete) for much of the quantitative analysis in this article, but we show that other regions give consistent results.

The counterfactual is the best prediction given the historical probability distribution of the death rate time series data, combined with the trend in the data before the beginning of the pandemic. This approach is superior to the averaging of historical data in that it can account for the trends that may be correlated in time.

Moreover, CGP method also estimates the error on the prediction. The data shows a clear excess in mortality over the counterfactual predictions after the week ending on Feb 22. This is the week when the first COVID-19 related deaths were reported officially in Italy. In Figure 2 , we show the excess deaths over the expected counterfactual for every week of officially reported COVID-19 data until April 11th. At the time of writing mortality data were available only up to March 28th. In Figures 2 and 3 we have extrapolated this data to April 11. To perform this extrapolation, we have made a conservative assumption that the weekly excess mortality is the same as the reported COVID-19 deaths for the week ending in April 11. This is based on the observation that the ratio of weekly excess to reported COVID-19 deaths is decreasing with time in all the regions, as is expected based on the increased testing. However, none of the regions have reached the ratio of unity as of March 28 (Figure 2 ), the lowest being Lombardia with a ratio of 1.5. Thus we expect our procedure to give a lower-bound on the total deaths as of April 11. We also do not extrapolate the deaths past April 11, so our estimates are still a lower bound on the total number of deaths from COVID-19.",

We allow time lags between -15 and +15 days, meaning that we can perform this analysis in a time-window spanning from March 9 to March 28 without the need of extrapolation. For the hardest hit regions we identify distinct minima in \u03c7 2 , corresponding to time-lags of \u22126 \u00b1 0.5 days for Lombardia and \u22125 \u00b1 1 days for Emilia-Romagna. We obtain consistent time-lags for most other regions, however, the lower number counts result in noisier estimates. The inferred time-lag suggests that the official number lags behind the excess. Assuming that most people entering into the excess count never received medical treatment in a hospital, this lag could be attributed to the fact that a treatment in a hospital postpones a death on average by several days.",

However, correlation is not causation, so attributing the excess death rate to COVID-19 is still a strong assumption. We discuss possible caveats. COVID-19 has put an enormous pressure on Italy's medical system and social services. This could have led to an excess mortality in some scenarios that would otherwise not be fatal, causing us to overestimate the COVID-19 deaths. However, the pressure on the medical system is regional and was likely sustainable for regions with a low number of official COVID-19 deaths and we consistently find a very large excess in mortality in most of the regions in Italy, including those that reported nearly zero COVID-19 deaths. The temporal trend also lends a similar argument: the societal and medical systems should function normally in the earliest stages of the pandemic and get increasingly stressed as the number of infections increases. However we see an exponential growth and a large excess of deaths in the initial stages. We find that the excess deaths over reported COVID-19 fatalities rapidly increases early, and then decreases as the number of reported infections increases. The ratio has decreased to 1.5 at the end of March for the most affected and most complete region of Lombardia, and the trend suggests this ratio will become unity sometime in April 2020. Our working hypothesis is that the excess deaths over official COVID-19 deaths are primarily due to the lack of testing in the initial stages of the pandemic. With the increase in testing as the pandemic evolves, the reported fatalities due to COVID-19 slowly catch up with the true current mortality.",

Italy has been under lockdown since March 9, which may have reduced fatalities due to other common sources such as road and workplace accidents, or criminal activities. This can be studied by observing the death rate correlations with the lockdown datum in regions with little or no infection, such as south Italy. There are several regions that do not show excess death rate, but none of them show a deficit death rate post March 9, so we assume that this effect is negligible.",

Due to our conservative scaling to April 11, this represents a lower bound on the fraction of the population that will have died from COVID-19 by the time the pandemic is over.

This is thus a null hypothesis that we test in this paper. As of April 11, 11 out of 330 DP infections in the age group above 70 had been fatal. This results in an IFR for this age group of 3.3% and we assign Poisson distribution errors to this. The population distribution in this age group on the DP was 80% in 70-79 and 20% above 80. For each region of Italy, we match this age distribution to estimate the age weighted IFR to DP in the above 70 age group. Combining it with the corresponding PFR, we are able to estimate an IR for this age-group. Then, under the assumption of age-independent IR, we are able to derive IFR for all the other age-groups.",

Our results suggest that there is a significant population of people predominantly above the age of 80, and specially above 90, that are dying of COVID-19, but did not get tested and do not appear in official statistics, possibly because the death occurred rapidly after the onset of COVID-19 (as supported by the time delay between the total and official mortality rate). Our analysis cannot distinguish between the IFR of official COVID-19 deaths which originates from a predominantly hospitalized population and this predominantly non-hospitalized and older population.",

Moreover, if only symptomatic cases are being tested then, assuming 50% asymptomatic ratio (AR) as suggested by the PD data, IFR<0.5 CFR (in some literature the true CFR is defined with equality in this relation). The differences between our IFR and the low CFR of other countries can be explained partly by the higher age distribution of Italy. For example, using the age dependent IFR estimates combined with the age distribution of Israel or Iceland, we obtain an estimate of IFR for Israel and Iceland of 0.4% and 0.5%, respectively. This is well below 1.1% for Italy, and also below the current Israel and Iceland CFR. It also appears that as of April 11 the CFR is still growing in most of the low CFR countries, possibly due to a time delay in infections relative to Italy. Finally, it is possible that similar corrections as presented in this paper need to be applied to other countries, and one may not be able to directly compare the official COVID-19 CFR to the IFR of the entire population. While we caution against comparing IFR without a population age distribution adjustment, at the moment there is no evidence that the age dependent IFRs vary by location. However, there is a lot of evidence that the IR do, even within a single country like Italy (Table 1) .",

The most direct way to verify this is to perform COVID-19 tests on every fatality, which is currently not done in any location. We can also repeat our analysis in other locations in the world, which would allow us to verify some of the alternative explanations, such as a concurrent flu outbreak. Such data is becoming available for some locations and our preliminary analysis of New York City data suggests a similar underestimation of COVID-19 deaths by official numbers h . 3) We assume IFR in a given age group does not depend on other factors such as differences in co-morbidities or health care systems between the locations. This can be verified with tests performed at random or for an entire population, which are currently not available except for DP. It requires a very large number of tests to accumulate large enough fatality statistics. 4) We assume the same infection rate for all the age groups in a particular region, inspired by epidemiological models 5 . This could be to some extent verified by the positive test fraction as a function of age. Data for this exists but are currently not published. In addition, our age dependent PFR from the province of Bergamo serves as a lower limit to the IFR (Figure 4) . We note that given the conservative scaling of excess mortality to COVID-19 reported data by April 11, the reported numbers are likely an underestimate of the overall COVID-19 mortality by the conclusion of the pandemic in Italy, but we will be able to improve on this with the subsequent data releases.",

Figure 5 shows the population and mortality scaling factors for the regions presented in this work (bottom). We show the mortality completeness averaged over 2015 through 2018, and the standard deviation of these 4 years determines the error bar. We find consistent results between the 2010 census data and the January -March 2015 through 2018 weekly reported deaths. This consistency between the population and mortality completeness estimates is an indicator that there are minimal biases introduced by the data scaling performed.

The first reported COVID-19 mortality occurred in the week ending on February 22 (gray vertical line). The observed data in 2020 is shown in black, while the predicted counterfactuals by conditional Gaussian Process (CGP, section 0.2) and synthetic controls method (SCM, section 0.3) are shown in green and orange, respectively. The historical data from 2015-2019 and corresponding mean is shown by the thin blue and pink lines, respectively. The 1 sigma confidence interval for CGP estimate is shown with green shaded region. The counterfactual predictions trace the observed data better than the historical mean over the pre-pandemic period.",

Excess mortality compared to reported COVID-19 deaths. a, excess weekly deaths, and b, cumulative excess deaths, over the predicted counterfactual in comparison to the reported COVID-19 deaths (in pink) for the period since February 23rd (available COVID-19 data). Estimates from both the counterfactuals, SCM (orange) and CGP (green) agree. We find that COVID-19 deaths are under-reported by multiple factors for every period and every region. We extrapolate the data excess beyond March 28th with dashed-lines. To do this, we make a conservative assumption that the ratio of excess deaths to COVID-19 reported deaths approaches 1 on April 11 linearly.",
