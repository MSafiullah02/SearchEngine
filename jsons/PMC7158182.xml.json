The etiologic agents in the infants described by Dehner and Kissane,3 Moss and Pysher,5 Chusid,6 and Miedema and co-workers7 included Escherichia coli, S. aureus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Klebsiella sp., Enterobacter sp., and Listeria monocytogenes. However, the causative bacteria of solitary abscesses are generally those colonizing the umbilical stump,43 including S. aureus (11 cases); E. coli alone (3 cases); E. coli with S. aureus (2 cases) or enterococcus (1 case); Enterobacter sp. (3 cases); Klebsiella pneumoniae alone (2 cases); K. pneumoniae with Proteus sp. (1 case); P. aeruginosa (1 case); Staphylococcus epidermidis with group F Streptococcus (1 case); and Streptococcus pyogenes (1 case). In three infants, the abscesses were described as \u201csterile.\u201d19,\n28,\n31 Although one of these infants had received penicillin for 9 days before surgical drainage, it is possible that in all three cases the abscesses were caused by anaerobic bacteria that failed to grow under standard conditions of transport and culture. The presence of gas in seven abscesses25,\n28,\n34,\n35,\n39 may indicate infection with anaerobes, a frequent cause of liver abscess in adults.44\n",

Because the liver is perfused by blood with a high oxygen content45 and is the first organ that encounters tubercle bacilli, it is often severely involved.15,\n44,\n46 The presence of primary liver foci is considered prima facie evidence for the congenital nature of tuberculous lesions as a result of hematogenous spread through the umbilical vein.47 However, closed-needle biopsy may be less accurate in the diagnosis of hepatic granulomas, and open biopsy may be required to confirm liver and regional node involvement.48 Although generalized fetal infection may also arise through aspiration of contaminated amniotic fluid, the lesions acquired in this manner are usually most prominent in the lungs. In addition to hepatomegaly, a clinical picture of fever with elevated serum IgM and chorioretinitis (e.g., choroid tubercles) may be similar to that caused by other congenital infectious agents.49 In a review by Abughal and co-workers,49 positive sites of culture for tuberculosis included liver (8 of 9), gastric aspirate (18 of 23), tracheal aspirate (7 of 7), ear (5 of 6), and cerebrospinal fluid (3 of 10). Noncaseating granulomatous hepatitis, thought to be caused by a hypersensitivity reaction related to bacille Calmette-Gu\u00e9rin (BCG) vaccination, has also been described in a neonate,50 but histologic and bacteriologic studies performed on liver biopsy specimens failed to identify the presence of acid-fast bacilli or BCG organisms.",

Despite intense infection of the underlying vessels, inspection of the umbilical stump usually shows no evidence of inflammation or purulent discharge. The presence of hepatomegaly, a finding commonly associated with neonatal sepsis, also offers little aid in establishing a definitive diagnosis.

In most cases, resolution of the primary process permits restoration of the flow of bile and relief of distention. In some cases, prolonged obstruction leads to hydrops.94 Cholecystitis rarely follows, perhaps because of a direct toxic effect of retained bile or because of ischemia related to elevated intraluminal pressure.

The presence or absence of fever is an unreliable sign in appendicitis as in other forms of neonatal infection; temperature has been recorded as normal or subnormal in more than 50% of newborns with this condition. Abdominal tenderness and guarding are inconstant findings and, when present, are rarely localized to the appendiceal area. Physical signs of sufficient specificity to indicate acute inflammation of the appendix are generally absent until late in the course of the illness, when gangrene and rupture may result in the formation of a localized intra-abdominal abscess or cellulitis of the anterior abdominal wall. Erythema or edema, or both, of the right lower quadrant has been observed in several patients. The presence of this finding, particularly when accompanied by a palpable mass in the right iliac fossa, indicates bowel perforation with peritonitis and should suggest a preoperative diagnosis of NEC or appendicitis (see \u201cNecrotizing Enterocolitis\u201d).\n",

Perforation, fecal spillage, and peritonitis occur so early in the course of neonatal appendicitis that almost all infants with this condition require treatment before the time of surgery. After the diagnosis of gangrenous or perforated appendicitis has been established and surgery performed, parenteral antibiotic therapy should be continued for 10 days. The combination of clindamycin (or metronidazole), gentamicin (or extended-spectrum cephalosporins), and ampicillin provides adequate coverage against most enteric pathogens and can be used for initial empirical therapy. Alternatively, \u03b2-lactam and \u03b2-lactamase inhibitor combinations such as ticarcillin plus clavulanate or piperacillin plus tazobactam or carbapenem antibiotics (e.g., imipenem) can be used alone to broadly cover enteric bacteria, Pseudomonas sp., and anaerobic bacteria.

The vomitus contains bile and may contain blood. The stools are either absent or scant; some mucus or blood may be passed.

Diagnostic needle paracentesis is also useful for relief of pneumoperitoneum and may facilitate exchange of gas by reducing the intra-abdominal pressure. Shock, dehydration, and electrolyte disturbances should be corrected through parenteral administration of appropriate electrolyte solutions, plasma, or plasma substitutes. If blood is discovered in fluid recovered by gastric suction or abdominal paracentesis, use of whole blood, packed red blood cells, or other fluids may be necessary to correct hypovolemia. Persistent bleeding must be evaluated for disseminated intravascular coagulation or thrombocytopenia, or both, and treated accordingly. Hypothermia, which frequently accompanies neonatal peritonitis, should be corrected before induction of anesthesia.

Each of these conditions, singly or together, may act as a stress leading to mucosal injury, but none has been consistently associated with NEC.348,\n349 NEC has occurred among apparently healthy infants with no known predisposing risk factors.298,\n307,\n336,\n345 Several studies (discussed later) suggest that early feeding of premature neonates may play a causal role in NEC. Dvorak and coinvestigators344 have shown that maternal milk may be protective compared with artificial formulas in a neonatal rat model of NEC; similar to human NEC, artificial feeding of maternal milk reduced the incidence and severity of NEC injury and IL-10 expression was significantly increased when neonates were fed maternal milk.",

The temporal clustering of cases at institutions, the association of some outbreaks with single infectious agents or alterations in bowel flora, and the possible beneficial effects of breast-feeding, oral nonabsorbable antibiotics, or infection control measures in reducing the incidence of disease suggest a possible nosocomial cause. Unfortunately, the evidence linking NEC to a specific infectious agent is often circumstantial or open to alternative interpretation. Evidence suggests that NEC is the end response of the immature gastrointestinal tract to multiple factors acting alone or in concert to produce mucosal injury, with colonization or invasion by the microorganisms representing only one part of the continuum of that disease process.282,\n289,\n290,\n307\n",

After an antiseptic skin preparation, a small needle (22 or 25 gauge) is inserted carefully in the flank, at a 45-degree angle. It is advanced slowly and aspirated gently until free flow of 0.5mL or more of peritoneal fluid is obtained. Any volume less than 0.5mL is considered a dry tap and cannot be accurately interpreted. The color and appearance of the fluid are noted, and the fluid is transported immediately to the laboratory\u2014preferably in the syringe with air expelled and the needle covered with a cork or rubber stopper\u2014for Gram staining and for aerobic and anaerobic cultures.

In controlled clinical trials, a significant reduction in the incidence of NEC in treated premature infants was shown in some,331,\n434,\n435,\n436,\n437 whereas in others, investigators were unable to demonstrate any protective effect.437,\n438 Studies of vancomycin439 have shown a significant reduction in NEC in high-risk infants. Previous studies revealed selective growth of resistant organisms in bowel flora331,\n438,\n440 and evidence of significant systemic absorption of aminoglycoside antibiotics,429,\n441,\n442 suggesting that oral aminoglycoside prophylaxis is not free of potential risks. Potential risk factors, however, have not been examined in vancomycin trials. Until additional evidence is presented indicating clear-cut benefits from the use of oral aminoglycosides or vancomycin, it does not appear that either should be used routinely for prevention of NEC in premature infants. Epidemiologic evidence that early use of parenteral ampicillin and aminoglycoside therapy may delay or decrease the risk of NEC has not been confirmed in controlled studies.343 Oral probiotics have been suggested to alter the bowel flora of the infant to reduce the incidence and severity of NEC.

NEC infants are more likely to have been fed earlier, to have received full-strength formulas sooner, and to have received larger feeding volumes and increments, and stress and associated respiratory problems may make such infants more vulnerable to NEC.245,\n309,\n310,\n311,\n312,\n313,\n314,\n444 Prior studies of the use of a feeding regimen employing prolonged periods of bowel rest in high-risk infants has been successful in preventing NEC in some nurseries315 but totally without value in others.317,\n324 Later studies have added additional support for standardized feeding schedules in low-birth-weight infants (500 to 2500g); all have used maximum volumes no greater than 20mL/kg/day, with feeding beginning at 24 to 72 hours after birth, depending on birth weight and gestational age.325,\n326 Both synthetic formulas and breast milk have been successful. Carrion and Egan445 have suggested that relative hypochlorhydria of the neonate may contribute to NEC and found that hydrochloric acid supplements (0.01 to 0.02 1.0 N HCl/mL of formula) significantly reduced NEC rates and lowered gastric pH. Additional studies have shown that standardized feedings begun at a median of 4 days after onset of NEC can be associated with an abbreviated time until institution of full enteral feedings, a reduced incidence of the use of central catheters and catheter infections, and ultimately, a shorter hospital stay.446\n",

The prolonged survival of critically ill infants and the increased use of intravascular catheters, together with advances in the diagnostic sensitivity and availability of echocardiography, may be responsible for rising recognition of endocarditis. In a 35-year review of 76 cases of endocarditis in children, 10% of patients were younger than 1 year; the youngest patient was 1 month old.486 Sixty-two (83%) had congenital heart disease, and 77% had had prior surgery. Central venous catheters were additional significant risk factors. For example, at the University of New Mexico in a level III nursery with 3200 to 3500 admissions annually, 12 cases of endocarditis occurred in children younger than 3 months.487 Organisms isolated from these 10 cases included S. aureus (6 cases), Klebsiella pneumoniae (1 case), Enterobacter cloacae (2 cases), Candida sp. (1 case), alpha-streptococci (1 case), and coagulase-negative staphylococci (1 case). Three patients had congenital heart disease with early surgical intervention; all had surgically implanted catheters or intravenous access devices, one had NEC, and one had an associated osteomyelitis.",

Widespread use of new techniques such as transesophageal echocardiography, which provides detailed views of the mitral and tricuspid valves, and color flow Doppler imaging, which can identify areas of turbulence as blood passes over vegetations or through narrowed valve leaflets, may greatly improve diagnostic accuracy in the future.515\n",

One early review of Pseudomonas sepsis described suppurative pericarditis in four neonates.532 Another report on the recovery of Pseudomonas from the pericardium of premature infants dying of septicemia and meningitis during a nursery outbreak is difficult to evaluate because details of clinical and autopsy findings were not given.539 Cases caused by Candida sp. and Mycoplasma hominis have also been described.493,\n499,\n540 The causes of a pericardial effusion in three fetuses with multiple congenital anomalies, myocardial hypertrophy, and pericarditis are uncertain. Although the inflammatory exudate found at autopsy contained polymorphonuclear leukocytes in addition to lymphocytes, no evidence of bacterial infection was found.541\n",

Unfortunately, the clinical findings of cardiac tamponade are extremely subtle and difficult to differentiate from those of myocardial disease with right-sided heart failure. A rapid pulse, quiet precordium, muffled heart sounds, neck vein distention, and hepatomegaly are findings common to both entities. More specific signs of tamponade, such as narrow pulse pressure or respiratory variations in pulse volume of more than 20mm Hg (i.e., pulsus paradoxus), are technically difficult to obtain in neonates without an arterial catheter in place.

If there is a strong suspicion of involvement with anaerobic bacteria (i.e., negative aerobic cultures or failure to respond to therapy directed at aerobic pathogens), consideration should be given to adding or substituting antibiotics appropriate for anaerobic bacteria (e.g., clindamycin, metronidazole in combination with other antibiotics or a \u03b2-lactam and \u03b2-lactamase antibiotic alone). The duration of therapy should extend throughout the period of inflammation, continuing 3 to 5 days after signs of local inflammation have disappeared.

Operators were frequently uneducated, were dirty, and often spat on their instruments. Erysipelas, tetanus, and diphtheria have long been recognized as complications of unsterile surgical technique performed on newborns. In a now obsolete and prohibited part of the Orthodox Jewish circumcision ritual, the operator applied his lips to the fresh circumcision wound and sucked a few drops of blood. Such practices were responsible for transmission of syphilis and tuberculosis in neonates in the past. In one report,586 a 4-month-old infant presented with a penile ulcer, bilateral inguinal adenopathy, and a draining inguinal sinus caused by Mycobacterium tuberculosis after the \u201cbarber\u201d spat on his razor before circumcision. Reports of 43 cases of tuberculosis associated with circumcision had been published by 1916.585 Subsequent case reports of severe infection after circumcision include bacteremia related to group B streptococci,587 local infection and fatal staphylococcal pneumonia,588 staphylococcal scalded skin syndrome,589,\n590 necrotizing fasciitis,591 and bullous impetigo.592 Two reports of necrotizing fasciitis after Plastibell circumcision emphasize severe infection as a potential risk of this procedure.593 One infection caused by S. aureus and Klebsiella sp. was associated with prolonged convalescent and multiple surgical repairs, whereas a second infant survived staphylococcal necrotizing fasciitis after 14 days of intravenous antibiotic treatment.",

The organisms are present in purulent material underlying the necrotic membrane. These lesions are particularly more common adjacent to nose, lip, ear, mouth, and perineum, resulting in avascular necrosis and loss of tissue. P. aeruginosa may be grown in pure culture from blood and lesions. Among 48 infants described in one outbreak, lesions appeared within the first 2 weeks of life; most infants died within 3 days of onset.620 Ecthyma is relatively specific for Pseudomonas infections, but similar or identical lesions have rarely been described in infections due to S. aureus, Aeromonas hydrophila, S. marcescens, Aspergillus sp., or Mucor sp.621\n",

The lesion and the surrounding tissue should be cleaned with 70% ethanol to prevent contamination from organisms that colonize the surface. If crusts are present, they should be lifted with a sterile swab to provide drainage, and cultures should be obtained from the base of the lesion. Vesicles and pustules can be aspirated with a needle (20 to 25 gauge) attached to a syringe, or they can be opened and exudate collected on a sterile swab. In general, swabs are not preferred for specimen collection because swab materials bind or inactivate bacterial organisms. Aspiration of abscesses is important; more than one aspiration may be required because the suppurative focus may not be easily distinguished from the surrounding inflammatory tissue. Aspiration of the leading edge or point of maximal inflammation of an area of cellulitis may be of value and should be performed if no other suppurative or purulent sites are available for culture. A small needle (25 or 26 gauge) should be attached to a tuberculin or other small-volume syringe filled with 0.25 to 0.50mL of sterile nonbacteriostatic saline; the needle should be inserted into the area of soft tissue to be sampled, with continuous, gentle aspiration applied to the syringe. If no fluid is returned to the syringe, a small amount of fluid should be injected and immediately aspirated back into the syringe.

Most evidence supports the hypothesis that sclerema is a manifestation of shock and insufficiency of the peripheral circulation. When it occurs in infants with generalized infection, sclerema is associated with a poor prognosis. In a review of cases of sepsis at The New York Hospital, sclerema was detected in 6 of 71 infants, 5 of whom died.667\n",

At first, the clinical manifestations are localized to the eye and include edema and erythema of the lid and purulent discharge. In some children, the conjunctivitis progresses rapidly, with denuding of the corneal epithelium and infiltration with neutrophils. With extension of the corneal infiltration, perforation of the cornea may occur. The anterior chamber may fill with fibrinous exudate, and the iris can adhere to the cornea. Subsequent invasion of the cornea by small blood vessels (pannus) is characteristic of pseudomonal conjunctivitis. The late ophthalmic complications may be followed by bacteremia and septic foci in other organs.700\n",
