Such practices have, however, also often culminated in significant economic damage to locations associated with disease (Cash and Narasimhan 2000). In an explicit attempt to avoid the risk the 2009 influenza pandemic would be labelled the \u2018 Mexican Flu\u2019 (on account that Mexico was the location where the disease first appeared), the WHO secretariat initially settled on identifying the pandemic with the animal that is most closely associated with the H1N1 virus: pigs. Accordingly, for the first few weeks of the 2009 crisis, the pandemic was extensively described by the WHO and international media outlets as \u2018Swine Flu\u2019 (Cohen 2009b; Butler 2009).",

It did, however, result in a raft of unintended consequences that rapidly revealed the decision was a mistake. Indeed, within weeks of the descriptor being applied, approximately 20 per cent of the WHO\u2019s member states implemented a series of measures that exceeded, and thereby contravened, international norms (Davies et al. 2015). In late April 2009, for example, the Egyptian government ordered the mass culling of all pigs throughout the country (estimated to be between 250,000 and 400,000 animals) as a \u2018preventative measure\u2019, despite the fact that no human cases of H1N1 had been recorded in Egypt nor any reported outbreaks of H1N1 had occurred in pigs worldwide (Katz and Fischer 2010). Within days, the Iraqi government followed Egypt\u2019s lead and ordered the culling of three boars in a Baghdad zoo (Karadesh 2009). Added to this, some 20 other countries including Russia, the Philippines, Indonesia, Bahrain and China imposed trade import bans on all live pigs, pork and pork products, citing concerns over the risk that H1N1 may be introduced into their respective human populations (Lynn 2009; WTO 2009; Katz and Fischer 2010).",

On 26 April 2009, for instance, the organisation issued a press release that emphasised that trade and travel restrictions were not recommended (WHO 2009e). The next day the secretariat expanded on this, unequivocally stating, \u2018[t]here is also no risk of infection from this virus from consumption of well-cooked pork and pork products\u2019 (WHO 2009f). On 29 April 2009, a representative from the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO)\nwent further, explicitly condemning the Egyptian government by describing the slaughter of the country\u2019s entire pig population a \u2018real mistake\u2019 and stating \u2018[t]here is no reason to do that\u2019 (Stewart 2009). To add further weight to this public messaging, the next day, the FAO, WHO and the World Organization for Animal Health issued a joint statement stipulating that pork and pork products were safe and that trade bans were unwarranted (FAO/WHO/OIE 2009). This statement was then re-issued on 7 May 2009 to further reinforce the message (Ibid). Nonetheless, several countries persisted in applying live pig and pork import bans with the result that official complaints were formally lodged with the World Trade Organization (WTO)\nin late June 2009 (WTO 2009).",

Similarly, when questioned about their decision to slaughter three wild boars, a representative from the Iraqi zoo admitted that their actions were not based on science but were rather designed \u2018to break a barrier of fear\u2019 amongst zoo visitors (Karadesh 2009). The Philippines, which had banned pork imports from the USA, Mexico and Canada in late April 2009 as a \u2018precautionary measure\u2019(Joshi 2009), lifted the ban within a week for the USA\nand Mexico but sought to justify their continued ban on Canada on the basis of a suspected case of swine-to-human H1N1 infection (Ager 2009).",

Although the WHO secretariat had attempted to avoid the risk the 2009 H1N1 influenza pandemic would become known as the \u2018 Mexican Flu\u2019, by selecting an alternative descriptor, the organisation had inadvertently instigated harmful trade and animal welfare practices. The fact that there was no clinical evidence of the 2009 H1N1 virus spreading between pigs and humans proved irrelevant; the damage had been done by drawing the correlation between pigs and the virus. Compounding the WHO\u2019s mistake, a small number of countries took the additional step of quarantining Mexican citizens in their respective countries, or prevented travel to and from Mexico, in an inept attempt to limit the virus\u2019 transmission. Although conceivably it could be argued the proportion of countries that engaged these latter measures was potentially smaller given the IO had acted so precipitously to negate the association being drawn between H1N1 and Mexico, it nevertheless proved only partially successful. In hindsight, therefore, it can be appreciated the IO\u2019s initial descriptor was not only a mistake that could have been predicted and easily avoided by selecting an alternative name (such as \u2018H1N1\u2019), but it also failed to comprehensively repudiate an association between Mexico and the H1N1 virus (and the associated economic repercussions) that was\nemerging.\n",

Fortunately, due to the work undertaken post-2005 in strengthening pandemic preparedness through increased disease surveillance and collaborative arrangements, the epidemiological agent responsible for the crisis was rapidly identified as a novel strain of influenza. Importantly, however, it took a number of months after the disease\u2019s identification in April 2009 before the lethality of the virus could be accurately determined. Concern over the severity of the virus and the risk to communities was also exacerbated by international media reports, particularly in the initial weeks; until sufficient data had been gathered and interpreted, it was unclear what measures were required to contain the disease and prevent unnecessary human morbidity and mortality.",

Since 1999 the WHO had actively encouraged countries to strengthen their pandemic preparedness and had released a series of guideline documents that detailed various measures designed to achieve that objective (i.e. building vaccine manufacturing capacity, stockpiling antiviral medications, developing national emergency committees, etc.). These guidelines were also important as they introduced a framework for how and when a pandemic would be declared by the IO, outlining the multiple stages and decision points (described as \u2018phases\u2019) such as \u2018limited human-to-human transmission\u2019 through to widespread, sustained community-level infection (WHO 1999a, 2005, 2009c). Somewhat ironically, the WHO secretariat had released the latest version of these pandemic influenza guidelines only a few months before the first recorded outbreak of H1N1 in Mexico. One of the crucial factors cited in the most recent version of the guidelines for declaring a pandemic though had been an assessment of the severity of a virus.",

In an initial attempt to deflect criticism of the secretariat\u2019s actions, rather than accept it had erred in its dealings with the media and accept that its removal of the guidelines was wrong, a WHO official responded to questions about the inclusion of severity criteria in the now-redacted version of the document as an \u2018error\u2019 (Flynn 2010: 9). As preparations for the annual World Health Assembly (WHA)\ngot under way in May though, disquiet about the secretariat\u2019s behaviour grew. Assessing a more robust response was needed, the WHO director-general convened an urgent high-level consultation immediately prior to the WHA to review the data and processes used by the secretariat and IHR emergency committee (WHO 2009d). Even so, throughout the WHA, political pressure continued to build for the IO to revise its procedures for declaring a pandemic (SooHoo 2010). The momentum was such that the director-general concluded it was necessary to appoint an independent panel to review the organisation\u2019s management of the crisis and give the panel unfettered access.",

In early June 2010, these investigations handed down their findings, provoking the director-general to issue a strongly worded statement refuting the allegations that had been made and reaffirming that \u2018[t]he world is going through a real pandemic.

Speculation emerged at the time that the lack of effective communication between Geneva and AFRO was as a result of personality differences involving the director-general, Margaret Chan, and the then AFRO regional director, Luis Gomes Sambo, who was later replaced in office (Gostin 2015a). Irrespective of whether such hearsay was grounded on fact or the AFRO recommendation for a regional team was communicated or not, the decision to send the bulk of personnel to Guinea nonetheless suggests staff in Geneva lacked sufficient insight into how the outbreak might unfold and spread to neighbouring states. Such an oversight is virtually indefensible though given the outbreak was known to have started in an area close to international borders and surveillance systems throughout the region were known to be inadequate.",

Yet, as Gostin (2015b: 1904) notes, \u2018AFRO did not convene health ministers or open a regional coordination centre until 3 months after Ebola was confirmed in Guinea\u2019. By this stage, the virus had spread to neighbouring Sierra Leone and Liberia where, due to poor surveillance and response systems, the pathogen went on to infect thousands.

Arguably, however, while the regional office attracted the ire of some, the majority of criticism was levelled at the WHO staff in Geneva. By September 2014, for instance, the IO\u2019s response was being described extensively by a wide range of external commentators as slow and ineffectual (Anonymous 2014; Sack et al. 2014). While the director-general publicly attempted to defend her organisation by stressing that the agency was not the \u2018first responder\u2019 (Fink 2014), these perceptions were not aided by the unauthorised release of an internal review that identified \u2018severe shortcomings\u2019 in the WHO\u2019s response (Cheng 2014). Further mistakes were then uncovered in March 2015 with the publication of the AP investigation that revealed staff in Geneva had actively resisted attempts to declare the event a global public health emergency over concerns that it may antagonise the affected countries (Cheng and Satter 2015). Collectively, the multiple reports and revelations consolidated the perception amongst many world leaders that the WHO had \u2018failed\u2019 the international community, prompting the UN secretary-general to take an unprecedented action in establishing the United Nations\u2019 first ever public health mission ( UNMEER), while other countries deployed military personnel to assist with the response\n(Kamradt-Scott et al. 2015).\n",

Disturbingly, very many of the recommendations produced by these commissions echoed the practical steps for enhancing global health security advanced by the various H1N1 review panels four years earlier. Critically though, the majority had not been acted upon, raising the question of whether the EVD outbreak could have been contained sooner, saving lives (Ottersen et al. 2016). To what extent, therefore, was the failure to enact these earlier recommendations the fault of the WHO secretariat? Was this yet another of the organisation\u2019s mistakes?

Likewise, the decision to remove influenza policy guidelines when discrepancies were identified, presumably as part of some (misguided) media strategy, rests exclusively with the secretariat.

The secretariat\u2019s decision to remove guidelines during the H1N1 pandemic, for example, was unwarranted and yet inflicted considerable, unnecessary reputational damage. Similarly, the labelling of H1N1 initially as \u2018swine flu\u2019 resulted in a series of unintended consequences, whereas the aversion to challenging member states\u2019 official reports during the West African EVD outbreak proved disastrous and was fundamentally motivated more by politics than technical incapacity. Such mistakes are readily avoidable, and while the coordination problems identified in the Ebola response reflect a deeper organisational (bureaucratic and cultural) predicament, all these issues fall fully within the purview of the IO secretariat\u2019s ability to realise. So, to what extent has the WHO learnt this lesson?",

This new initiative seeks to develop a new organisation-wide policy framework for responding to health emergencies as well as recruit new specialised personnel that will be distributed across the IO\u2019s central headquarters, regional offices and country offices. As outlined in the proposal that member states have endorsed, \u2018[i]n high-vulnerability, low-capacity countries, WHO offices will have dedicated staff to support Member States with their work in all-hazards preparedness and response capacity building\u2019 (WHO 2016c: 3). To accomplish this, the WHE \u2018will require the recruitment of a substantial number of additional staff, with new skill sets\u2019 than the IO currently retains (Ibid: 6). These new resources\u2014both human and policy\u2014are intended to ensure that on-the-ground assessments are conducted within 72 hours of official notification of a possible \u2018high-threat pathogen\u2019 (Ibid: 4). More broadly, the new programme and its personnel are expected to \u2018bring speed and predictability to WHO\u2019s emergency work, using an all-hazards approach, promoting collective action, and encompassing preparedness, readiness, response and early recovery activities\u2019 (Ibid: 1).",

Given, however, that elements of the WHO secretariat had hoped member states would authorise even further modifications to improve the organisation\u2019s crisis response (Fink 2015), it is reasonable to surmise that the IO\u2019s bureaucracy has gained an appreciation of the need to do better in future health crises. Although this may not be evidence of lesson learning per se, it is arguably a strong indication of an internal cultural shift. Indeed, the WHE offers the secretariat a strategic opportunity to realign its current risk-averse approach. If embraced, it may help the organisation to avoid repeating the type of mistakes discussed above. Like the GHEW and HECF though, the new WHE is also struggling to gain the necessary financial backing to see the programme fully operationalised (WHO 2017). Here again, therefore, the secretariat is confronted with a dilemma whereby member states, desiring the WHO to change, appear unwilling to trust the organisation sufficiently with the resources to realise their preferred outcome.",

The IO, ultimately, comprises individuals, and as Oestreich (2012b) observes, \u2018[p]eople are quirky, unpredictable, and unique\u2019. Events such as disease outbreaks are often permeated by pervasive uncertainty, and while they do oftentimes create political space for change, as Ottersen et al. (2016) have also noted, the \u2018policy windows\u2019 for implementing change can be brief. Converting the organisation\u2019s culture to adopt an \u2018emergency mind-set\u2019 is unlikely to be accomplished quickly, principally as reforming bureaucracies can be a laborious, tedious process. The combination of these two crises, occurring in comparatively rapid succession as they did, generated a desire for the IO to reform how it accomplishes its constitutional mandate, but it remains unclear how long the current window of opportunity will remain open.\n",

In the aftermath of the second of these events, political momentum built amongst member states to significantly reform the organisation\u2019s processes, procedures and even internal culture, to make the entity more capable of responding efficiently and effectively in the future. Yet, while there currently seems to be an appetite for a reformed WHO (as opposed to abolishing the organisation and starting over), a number of challenges still remain.

It is a change that will not be easy and will likely take some time to attain.
