A quick perusal of early journal and pre-print publications, trial registries, discussions with journal editors, and our own experience with peer review requests suggests that it will be crucial to be able to curate evidence rapidly, clearly delineate the kind of evidence that will answer pressing questions, and identify well-conducted and reported studies that can help us answer those questions.",

A protocol has been uploaded to the Open Science Framework (https://osf.io/96csg/). Studies in any language that address review questions and meet inclusion criteria will be included. A comprehensive search strategy for the review was developed in English by a health sciences librarian and translated to Chinese by members of the research team. The search will be conducted in English-language databases (MEDLINE (Ovid), PsycINFO (Ovid), CINAHL, EMBASE (Ovid), Web of Science) and using both English and Chinese search terms in the China National Knowledge Infrastructure and Wanfang databases. Search alerts will be set in each database to send the research team daily updates when new results match search terms. Results will then be quickly uploaded onto a website dedicated to the project (https://www.depressd.ca/covid-19-mental-health). Our team will provide a narrative synthesis as evidence accumulates. As part of this, Dr. Sarah Markham, a member of the team and an experienced patient advisor [8] (diagnosed with anxiety and a depressive disorder) who survived a serious suicide attempt in 2007, will provide commentary from a patient perspective. In addition, experts in mental health research and care will contribute outside reviews and commentary, which will be made public, as the review progresses. Eventually, the review will undergo traditional academic peer review for publication in the Journal of Psychosomatic Research.",

            "text": "In evaluating evidence on the nature and level of mental health burden from COVID-19, we will prioritize studies that compare symptom levels or diagnoses among study participants during COVID-19 to pre-COVID-19 data. Evidence from cross-sectional studies that report percentages of participants with scores above cutoff thresholds on commonly used symptom questionnaires is sometimes considered. Conclusions that can be drawn from that type of data about mental health effects from COVID-19 and clinical implications, however, will be limited. This is because percentages of people who score above a threshold on standardized questionnaires vary, sometimes dramatically, between populations, even in normal times. For example, the percentage of participants with scores of at least 10 on the Patient-Health Questionnaire-9 [9] , a commonly used measure of depressive symptoms, in large, randomly selected, regional or national general population samples, has been reported as 4% in Hong Kong (N = 6028) [10] ; 6% in Germany (N = 5018) [11] ; 7% in Shanghai, China (N = 1045) [12] ; 8% in the United States (N = 10,257) [13] ; 8% in the province of Alberta, Canada (N = 3304) [14] ; 11% in Sweden (N = 3001) [15] ; and 22% in Jiangsu Province, China (N = 8400) [16] . Even within populations from the same region, the percentage can vary dramatically depending on sample characteristics. In Jiangsu Province, for example, the percentage among rural residents (32%) is twice that of urban residents (16%); it is also several times higher for older adults (25% for 55-64 years; 87% for \u226565 years) than for young adults (8% for 18-34 years). Further complicating interpretation when there is not a time-based or other relevant comparator, percentages from symptom measures such as the PHQ-9 tend to dramatically overestimate prevalence that would be obtained from validated methods for ascertaining prevalence of mental health disorders, and there is too much heterogeneity between samples in the difference to correct for this statistically [17] .",
