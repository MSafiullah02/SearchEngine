On January 9, 2020, the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention identified the causative agent as a novel coronavirus, which now is officially termed severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). 1 The illness caused by SARS-CoV-2, coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), mainly manifests with fever, dry cough, dyspnea, myalgia, and diarrhea. However, COVID-19 presentations can range from asymptomatic infection, self-limited influenza-type symptoms, and acute pneumonia to severe respiratory failure with high mortality. Currently, the epidemic in China is being gradually controlled with major domestic efforts and international support. However, the global epidemic has now become a pandemic.",

Clinically, the incidence of acute kidney injury (AKI) in COVID-19 varied from 0.9% to 29% in different centers. New onset proteinuria was also reported by several institutions. 3 Currently, the pathologic investigation has primarily focused on respiratory, hematopoietic, and immune systems, whereas morphologic data of kidney injury are lacking.

Platelet aggregations or fibrin tactoids were not detected in association with this lesion. Aggregation of erythrocytes in segmental glomerular capillary loops was frequent, without inflammation or necrosis. In patent glomerular capillary loops, a varied extent of endothelial injury was noted, including swelling, foamy-like change, subendothelial lucent expansion, and endothelial proliferation without deposits. The ultrastructural findings are summarized in Table 3 . macrophages. CD235a (glycophorin A, present in erythrocytes) staining confirmed the microvascular obstruction was composed predominantly of erythrocytes. Serial section staining for CD61 (platelet marker) showed minimal staining in the same field, indicating no significant platelet component, and CD31 staining for endothelial cells showed near complete occlusion of peritubular capillary lumens ( Figure 3a ). In an archival biopsy of a patient who was nondiabetic, nonhypertensive, and without COVID-19, biopsied for proteinuria, weak ACE II (ACE2) staining of proximal tubules without glomerular staining was observed, which is consistent with previous publications. No detectable signal was observed in the kidney vascular compartment (Figure 3b ). ACE2 staining was also done in 5 of the patients (nos. 21, 22, 23, 24, 25), revealing altered ACE2 pattern in 3 of these (nos. 21, 22, 25). ACE2 expression was prominent in proximal tubular cells, particularly in areas with severe ATI. In addition, focal strong parietal epithelial cells staining was present, as well as occasional weaker podocyte staining (Figure 3c ). Direct or indirect immunofluorescent (IF) staining was conducted from paraffin blocks in 6 cases, and nonspecific IgM and C3 trapping were present. One biopsy showed segmental granular capillary IgG, however, without diagnostic C3 staining along the capillary wall, but with scattered humps by EM. One case showed IgA staining in mesangial area as well as capillary wall, associated with corresponding mesangial and subendothelial deposits by EM. By an indirect fluorescence method, the expression of SARS-CoV nucleoprotein was analyzed in the same 6 cases, and 3 showed positive granular staining in a nuclear or cytoplasm pattern in tubular epithelium (Figure 3d ). Negative and positive controls showed expected reactivity. The immunostaining findings are summarized in Table 3 .",

Our autopsy study demonstrates the range of abnormalities present and the specific kidney cells likely infected with the virus, and thus may provide important information for future clinicopathologic studies in less severely ill patients with COVID-19 infection and kidney injury. We observed significant ATI, the occlusion of microvascular lumens mainly by erythrocytes with ensuing endothelial damage, as well as glomerular and vascular changes indicative of underlying diabetic or hypertensive disease. Some of these findings are in accordance with former mechanisms known for b-coronavirus infection in kidney. We also show findings that suggest distinct mechanisms of this novel coronavirus infection, involving direct kidney parenchyma infection and likely secondary endothelial injury. Thus, these pathologic observations may provide a basis for further understanding of COVID-19.",

The tubular cytoplasmic vacuoles were mostly variable in size. However, in a few patients, focal isometric fine vacuolization was present and is likely related to treatment with hypertonic sucrose or other hyperosmolar fluids, such as i.v. Ig or mannitol therapy. EM demonstrated spherical virus particles characteristic of coronavirus in proximal tubular epithelium. The diameter of the virus particles and the length of spikes were similar to previously identified coronaviruses causing SARS and Middle East respiratory syndrome. 4 Furthermore, virus particles were clearly identified in podocytes, associated with foot process effacement and occasional vacuolation and detachment of podocytes from the glomerular basement membrane. Virus infection was confirmed by IF staining using an antibody targeting SARS-CoV nucleoprotein shared between bcoronaviruses. These findings indicate that SARS-CoV-2 virus can directly infect the renal tubular epithelium and podocytes, which was associated with AKI and proteinuria in these patients with COVID-19. Another common morphologic finding was erythrocyte stagnation in the lumen of glomerular and peritubular capillaries without platelets, red blood cell fragments, fibrin thrombi, or fibrinoid necrosis. Interestingly, in cases with predominant glomerular loop occlusion, less red blood cell aggregation was present in peritubular capillaries, which is often associated with a relatively long duration of hypotension.",

In endothelial cells of the kidney, only ACE is expressed without detectable ACE2. 10, 11 In line with this distribution of ACE2, we observed virus particles in tubular epithelium and podocytes, sites of known ACE2 expression. Collectively, the tubular and glomerular visceral epithelial cells of the kidney are the main targets of SARS-CoV-2. Based on our observations, the endothelium thus is not expected to be directly infected with SARS-CoV-2. However, we cannot totally rule out the possibility that SARS-CoV-2 can infect other resident kidney cells, as ACE2 expression may be altered in disease states or due to medications. Indeed, we show intensely positive parietal epithelial cells and occasional podocyte staining with ACE2 in 3 of the 5 COVID-19 kidney samples we assessed.",
