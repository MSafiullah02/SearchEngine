            "text": "Ebola virus (EBOV; Zaire ebolavirus) is the causative agent of a severe hemorrhagic fever disease, Ebola virus disease (EVD; formerly called Ebola hemorrhagic fever). It was first recognized in 1976 in northern Democratic Republic of Congo, at that time Zaire (1\u20133). Since then, EVD is endemic in Africa. Fruit bats are the best-known reservoirs of EBOV (4). EVD is a well-established zoonotic disease; the initial cases of the EVD outbreaks occur after contact with reservoir or materials contaminated with the virus and followed by human-to-human transmission (5). EBOV is not only a serious public health issue but now also designated as category A pathogen and considered as a potential bioterrorism agent (6, 7). EBOV causes high mortality rates of up to 88% in the infected humans (8); therefore, it is classified as a risk group 4 agent and handled under biosafety level-4 containment. The risk of mortality is relatively greater in the elderly and/or patients with high viral load and poor immune response at the initial stage of the infection (9).",

Its envelope is decorated with spikes of trimeric glycoprotein (GP1,2) which are responsible for mediating viral entry into target cells (function of GP1) (10) and release of viral ribonucleoprotein from endosome to cytoplasm for replication (function of GP2) (11, 12). EBOV infects primarily humans, simians, and bats; but other species such as mice, shrew, and duikers may also contact infection (3, 13). Of the five identified EBOV species, four species, viz., EBOV, Sudan virus (SUDV; Sudan ebolavirus), Tai Forest virus (TAFV; Tai Forest ebolavirus, formerly C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire ebolavirus), and Bundibugyo virus (BDBV; Bundibugyo ebolavirus), are known to infect humans and cause disease, whereas Reston virus (RESTV; Reston ebolavirus) is non-human primate (NHP) pathogen.",

EBOV can spread from males to females through semen (16) and from mother to fetus and infant during gestation and lactation, respectively (17). Of the note, in an EBOV-infected patient, higher concentration of Ebola viral RNA in semen was noticed during the recovery period than the viral concentration in the blood during peak time of infection, suggesting male genital organ as virus predilection site for replication (18). Usually the human immune system mounts a response against infectious pathogens by sensing the pathogen-associated molecular patterns via a variety of pathogen-recognition receptors. Nevertheless, in the case of EBOV, innate immunity is impaired by the immunosuppressive viral proteins including VP35 and VP24, and lymphocytes are depleted as a result of apoptosis caused by inappropriate dendritic cell (DC)\u2013T-cell interaction (7, 19). A thorough understanding on the pathogenesis of this deadly virus is essential because of its severe health impacts (20).",

Even before delineating the less studied Ebola viral genome fully, researchers throughout the globe and health industry were pressured to focus on the development of effective and safe Ebola vaccines and therapeutics (21, 22). As of now, no licensed vaccines and direct-acting anti-EBOV agents are available to protect against the lethal viral infection or to treat the disease. To minimize the suffering, EBOV-infected patients are only provided with symptomatic treatment and supportive care. Because of its high pathogenicity and mortality rate, preventive measures, prophylactics, and therapeutics are essential, and researchers worldwide are working to develop effective vaccines, drug, and therapeutics, including passive immunization and antibody-based treatments for EVD (23\u201326). Prior to the 2014\u20132016 EBOV outbreak in West Africa, which has been the deadliest EBOV outbreak to date, convalescent blood products from survivors of EVD represented the only recommended treatment option for newly infected persons. Administration of monoclonal antibody (mAb) cocktails (ZMapp, ZMAb, and MB-003) as post-exposure prophylactics have been found to reverse the advanced EVD in NHPs and/or effectively prevented morbidity and mortality in NHPs (27\u201330).",

One of the main challenges in containing EBOV is its presence in remote areas that lack technology and equipment to limit the virus spread. Because of its lethality, EBOV can only be handled in laboratories with biosecurity level-4 containment; thus, only few laboratories in the world can conduct EBOV research and testing of the counter measures against the authentic virus. Recent efforts by several organizations have focused on identifying effective therapies and developing appropriate vaccination strategies (33). Several drugs and vaccines have been developed against EBOV, and the production of low-cost drugs and vaccines against EBOV is essential for everyone, including those in the high-risk areas of the world, to be protected (26, 34). As of the acquisition of better knowledge against the pathogen due to improvement in the field of genomics and proteomics, there has been expansion in the field of vaccine synthesis where epitope-based vaccines are gaining top priority (35\u201337).",

Inclusion of inactivated vaccine with EBOV E-178 along with interferon (IFN) and immune plasma saved the life of a scientist working on EBOV (53). The protective efficacy of liposome-encapsulated irradiated EBOV, tested in a mouse model, was 100%. However, these viral particles failed to protect NHPs (54). This suggests that murine model is excellent for evaluating vaccine efficacy, but the level of protection might be different in different species and, hence, it is essential to test vaccines in NHPs before proceeding to clinical trials in humans.

Baculovirus-derived eVLPs comprising GP, VP40, and NP of EBOV have been found to induce human myeloid DC maturation, suggesting their immunogenicity. Baculovirus-generated VLPs were able to elicit similar levels of protection as 293T cell-derived VLPs and showed protection against virus challenge in a dose-dependent manner (62). Nano-VLPs, produced by sonication of VLPs and filtering to have a mean diameter of approximately 230 nm, increased their thermostability. Unlike native VLPs where GP protein is denatured in a solution by heating, the nano-VLP maintained the conformational integrity of the GP protein at temperature up to 70\u00b0C and could confer protection in a mouse model (63). VLP containing only VP40 was sufficient to protect mice from EBOV infection. VLP injection leads to an enhanced number of natural killer (NK) cells, which play a crucial role in innate immune protection against lethal EBOV. NK cell protection is dependent on perforin, but not recombinant viral vector vaccines on IFN-gamma secretion (64).",

To generate VRPs, generally filoviruses or alphaviruses are required. Here, while keeping the genes essential for replication, viral structural genes are deleted from full-length genomic cDNA clones. Viral structural genes are replaced with alternative gene(s) coding for an immunogen. Such replicons are able to replicate and transcribe upon transfection in competent cells. The resulting VRPs are able to infect cells only for one cycle. Because of the lack of structural genes, viral progeny are not formed. Viruses such as Venezuelan equine encephalitis virus (VEEV) can be used for production of EBOV antigen instead of structural proteins for the replicon vector. Thus, such vaccines are also quite safe (67). The gene inserted is typically GP, the main target of neutralizing antibodies. VRPs expressing EBOV VP24, VP30, VP35, and VP40 have been evaluated for their protective efficacy in a mouse model, but these were found not to be as protective as EBOV GP and NP antigens. VEEV replicons containing GPs from both EBOV and SUDV showed promising results in cynomolgus macaques after administration of a single dose. Here, two VRPs were constructed that contained the GP of EBOV or SUDV. The animals intramuscularly injected with both of the VRPs, survived viral challenge without exhibiting any clinical signs.

Replication-competent rVSV and chimpanzee adenovirus 3 (ChAd-3/cAd3) are the most efficient platforms for designing new vaccines (73). A recombinant vesiculovirus vector containing EBOV GP region (rVSV\u0394G/EBOVGP) was found to be highly effective after a single injection in NHPs (74, 75). The vaccine evaluated in pigs showed no disease development and no viral shedding. This indicated that the vaccine could be utilized for herd immunization and it also suggested the safety of the live-attenuated rVSV\u0394G/EBOVGP vaccine (76). Recently, this rVSV\u0394G/EBOVGP vaccine was evaluated in a randomized double blinded placebo phase III trial in 1,197 humans. There were no adverse effects or death following vaccination, supporting its use as a vaccine (77). The vaccine protected immunocompromised rhesus macaques that had a high number of CD4+ T cells (78). The rVSV\u0394G/EBOVGP vaccine was also studied for its efficacy as a therapy in rhesus monkeys after exposure to EBOV-Makona. This vaccine showed minimal prophylactic efficacy after exposure (79). Efficacy trials initiated to test the rVSV-vectored EBOV vaccine showed greater efficiency at the time of EVD outbreak, if deployed following the strategy of ring vaccination (80).",

Another recombinant vaccine viz., rVSV-EBOV vaccine was tested as a candidate vaccine. This particular vaccine is under trial in human (phase II/III). It provides protection against only EBOV and is clinically efficient in the clinical set up of ring vaccination format (38, 83, 84). EBOV and SUDV glycoproteins have been assimilated into a cAdVax vector (adenovirus-based vaccine). In mice, this vaccine has provided full protection (85, 86).

The vaccine GamEvac-Combi contained two heterologous expression systems. One is live-attenuated rVSV and the second is a recombinant replication-defective adenovirus type-5 (Ad5). Both the vectors are expressing the same glycoprotein. The rationale to use a combination of two vectors expressing glycoprotein of EBOV is that widely present preexisting immunity to Ad5 limits the use of Ad5 and also a negative correlation between EBOV glycoprotein-specific immune response and preexisting antibodies to Ad5 has been reported (88). Hence, prime immunization with VSV vectored vaccine and then boosting with AD5 vectored vaccine might contribute in compensating negative impacts of preexisting immune response to Ad5. This heterologous vaccine evoked glycoprotein-specific immune response in 100% volunteers on day 28th. Also, the vaccine is well tolerated and did not significantly altered the body physiological parameters and vital organs. In Liberia, Sierra Leone, and Guinea; the VSV and ChAd3 vectored vaccine are in focus (89).",

To note, the component antibodies in ZMapp are manufactured in Nicotiana benthamiana using a rapid antibody manufacturing platform. Gene transfer is mediated by a viral vector, and the expression is transient. N. benthamiana-derived antibodies produced stronger antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity than the analogous anti-EBOV mAbs produced in a mammalian Chinese hamster kidney cell line (100). Phoolcharoen (101) expressed a GP1 chimera with the heavy chain of 6D8 mAb, forming an immune complex that was co-expressed with the light chain of the same mAb in leaves of tobacco plant. The ammonium sulfate-precipitated purified antibodies, along with poly(I:C) adjuvant, a synthetic analog of double-stranded RNA capable of interacting with toll-like receptor (TLR)-3, was found to elicit strong neutralizing anti-EBOV IgG. In addition, the immune complex along with poly(I:C) adjuvant was capable of stimulating a Th1/Th2 response. The experiment suggested the potential application of plant-produced Ebola immune complexes as vaccine candidates. EBOV VP40 was expressed in tobacco plants, and a mouse immunization study showed results that suggested this approach can be used to produce an EBOV vaccine (102).",

Bean yellow dwarf virus, a single stranded-DNA virus, can replicate inside the nucleus of plant cells using their cellular machinery. A vector containing deletions in the coat-encoding genes and gene for the desired antigen may be inserted to form an expression cassette. The delivery of vectors to plants is Agrobacterium-mediated (23). mAbs against EBOV are produced by the process of agroinfiltration. In this context, it is noteworthy that lettuce acts as a very good host for the process of agroinfiltration. In lettuce cells, Agrobacterium tumefaciens has been used for delivering viral vectors (104). Neutralizing and protective mAb6D8 against EBOV has been expressed at a concentration of 0.5 mg/g of leaf mass. This quantity is similar to that generated in magnICON expression system (105). The plant-derived approach to vaccine development is attractive because of the large amount of transient proteins that can be expressed, with the potential for use during high demand for therapeutics and prophylactics (106). Advances in the field of vector expression like plant transient expression system and associated host cell engineering and manufacturing processes paved way for developing biopharmaceutical proteins and therapeutics in commercial basis. The great potentials of such novel approaches have been exploited for evolving therapeutics to counter emerging pandemics of EBOV and influenza that is evidenced from the production of experimental ZMapp antibodies (107).",

IFN-\u03b3 reduced the mortality rate in mice when administered either before or after EBOV infection (147), suggesting its promise as a prophylactic and/or therapeutic drug for use in EBOV infections.

In the low pH of endosome, cysteine proteases including cathepsin B and L proteolytically cleave GP.

TIM-1 receptors directly interact with phosphatidylserine on the viral envelope, suggestive of GP independent virus attachment onto the cells. In poorly permissive cells, EBOV infection enhanced by exogenously expressed TIM-1 by 10- to 30-folds (154). Other phosphatidylserine interacting proteins like TIM-4 and Axl (a receptor tyrosine kinase) also have been demonstrated to enhance the infection of several enveloped virus.

Thus, proteases may be a good target for the inhibition of EBOV replication. One study showed that, using a synthetic serine protease inhibitor, nafamostat mesilate (NM), caused a reduction in CatB release in rat pancreases. NM was also found to have anti-coagulant properties, which would also be useful in EBOV infections, as EBOV causes disseminated intravascular coagulation. Thus, this drug should be examined in clinical trials to be approved for the treatment of EVD (167). Chemically modified human serum albumin with 3-hydroxyphthalic anhydride (HP-HSA) has been demonstrated with the potential of a therapeutic candidate in resisting the EBOV infection (168).",

Precise immunoglobulins retrieved from equine serum against EBOV were found safe and effective as prophylactic therapy in non-allergic patients (177). Recently developed mAb-based treatments for EVD include mAb114 and MB-003, ZMAb, ZMapp, and MIL-77E cocktails (25). ZMAb, consisting of three murine mAbs (1H3, 2G4, and 4G7), administered at a dose of 25 mg/kg three times, completely protected cynomolgus macaques against EVD. Administration of ZMAb with adenovirus-vectored IFN-\u03b1 resulted in 75 and 100% survival of cynomolgus and rhesus macaques, respectively (29). mAbs that bind to the base of GP (4G7 and 2G4) are neutralizing antibodies, whereas mAbs that bind to the glycan cap (mAb114, 1H3, and 13C6) are non-neutralizing antibodies. The chimeric human mAbs 13C6, 6D8, and 13F6 possess the variable region from mice and Fc region of human; mAbs 13C6 and 6D8 neutralize EBOV in the presence of complement proteins (24). By repeated immunization of mice with glycoproteins of filovirus, generation of pan-EBOV-specific (as well as pan-filovirus) mAbs have been obtained. These pan-EBOV mAbs have shown reaction with RESTV, SUDV, and other viruses (178).",

Although several mAbs are available that can neutralize EBOV, there are few mAbs that can neutralize GPs from different EBOV species. In a study by Duehr et al. (183), a panel of eight murine mAbs derived from animals immunized with Zaire ebolavirus was evaluated. The mAbs were tested for binding breadth using a set of recombinant surface GPs from RESTV, TAFV, BDBV, EBOV, SUDV, and MARV. Of the eight, two mAbs (KL-2E5 and KL-2H7) showed binding ability. These two mAbs did not neutralize EBOV; however, they protected mice from infection with a VSV expressing the Zaire ebolavirus GP. Duehr et al. (183) also suggested that Fc-FcR interactions are responsible for the protection of mice in the absence of neutralization. Although ZMapp was found to be effective against Zaire EBOV, it has not shown cross-protection against other species of EBOV. FVM04 (a mAb) has shown cross neutralizing activity against SUDV. So, it can be used to replace one of the components of ZMapp, thereby increasing the range of protection against SUDV, ultimately leading to generation of cross-protective mAbs cocktail (184).",

The transbodies inhibit the function of VP40 by additional mechanisms also; such as binding to N-terminal domain and L-domain peptide WW binding motifs, suggesting the potential of these transbodies as direct acting anti-EBOV agents in future (190). Cell-penetrable HuscFvs specific to a highly conserved interferon-inhibitory domain (IID) of VP35 of EBOV inhibited the VP35 biofunctions in the EBOV replication cycle including polymerase cofactor activity and host IFN\u2013antagonism by forming interface contact with residues of the first basic patch, the central basic patch, end-cap, and residues important for IID multimeric formation for dsRNA binding (191). The cell-penetrable small antibody fragments (HuscFvs) or superantibodies [the term coined by Kohler and Paul (192)] can cross the membrane of all cells but get accumulated intracellularly only where the target antigen is present. Thus, disappearance of the superantibodies from the blood circulation does not imply that they are eliminated from the body. The transbodies to the highly conserved EBOV VP40 and VP35 should be evaluated further using authentic EBOV in animal models of EVD and clinical trials before they can be considered a broadly effective and promising alternative to existing treatment approaches for EVD.",

Human mAbs against BDBV GP were isolated from patients who survived during the 2007 Uganda outbreak. These mAbs were found to have a neutralizing effect against multiple EBOV species, suggesting the possibility of the use of single mAbs as cross-protecting antibodies (194). Another investigation showed that EBOV GPs were conserved across different EBOV species. ELISA revealed that four mAbs namely S3, S12, S17, and S33 were found to show cross-reaction with GPs of five different species of EBOV (195). The discovery of cross-protective antibodies can aid in the development of therapeutic strategies for treatment of EBOV disease (196). In another study, 349 EBOV GP mAbs were isolated from survivors of EVD in an outbreak in Zaire, and 77% of the mAbs were found to neutralize EBOV (197). Three mAbs of EBOV-GP (Q206, Q314, and Q411) were isolated during the West African EVD outbreak in 2014. Recognition of the novel epitopes has been performed for Q206 and Q411, wherein these mAbs were found protecting mice against EBOV (198). A therapeutic vaccine based on mAbs has been proposed to sufficiently resolve replication of invasive EBOV, even if administered as a single dose 4 days post-infection (199). Non-neutralizing mAb 5D2 or 7C9 expressing adeno-associated virus (AAV), consistently released mAb in body and was found 100% protective against mice adapted EBOV strain. Neutralizing mAb 2G4 conferred 83% protection and a cocktail of these two mAbs provided 100% protection when given 7 days prior to infection and sustained protection when immunized animals were challenged 5 months post AAV-mAb immunization (200).",

Owing to the lack of approved EBOV therapies, the screening of potentially efficacious drugs revealed that few of the drugs could be repurposed for EBOV treatment (206) (Table 2). Amiodarone, dronedarone, and verapamil, which are used for tachycardia, arrhythmias, and high blood pressure or angina, respectively, have been screened for their ability to inhibit the entry of filoviruses into cells and found efficacious in in vitro models (158). The use of statins, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, and angiotensin receptor blockers has also been suggested to attenuate EBOV infection (126). Phosphoinositide 3-kinases inhibitor LY294002 and calcium/calmodulin kinase (CAMK2) inhibitor KN-93 have been reported to reduce EBOV infection in Vero E6 cells. The p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase inhibitor SB202190 was shown to check virus-mediated cytokine storm, as studied in monocyte-derived DC of humans (207). Estrogen re-uptake modulators, viz., toremiphene and clomiphene, although cause in vitro inhibition of the virus entry, but are not free from unwanted side effects like ocular adverse reaction (in case of clomiphene) and serious derangements of electrolytes (in case of toremiphene) at the higher doses. To overcome this, combination therapy is suggested while using such drugs (206). Brincidofovir, a cidofovir analog conjugated with a lipid, can prevent EBOV replication; however, its exact efficacy in an in vivo model needs to be determined (208). Because cyclophilin A (CypA) is not essential for EBOV replication, alisporivir, which inhibits the host protein CypA, has shown limited antiviral effects against EBOV strains (Makona, Mayinga) (209). Emetine, an anti-protozoal agent, and its desmethyl analog cephaeline have potently inhibited EBOV replication and cephaeline is well tolerated in patients than emetine (210).",

The use of recombinant nematode anticoagulant protein c2, an inhibitor of tissue factor-mediated blood coagulation, was found to improve survival of macaques from Ebola hemorrhagic fever, and hence suggested to act as a good treatment module targeting the disease development (228). Anti-malarial drugs such as chloroquine and its structural analogs (hydroxychloroquine, pamaquine, primaquine, and plasmaquine) also act as lysosomotropic agents, preventing endosomal/lysosomal acidification, and thus limiting certain viral infections (233). There are conflicting reports on the therapeutic effects of chloroquine in mouse, hamster, and guinea pig models of EVD. Chloroquine was found to inhibit virus replication in in vitro studies but failed to protect against EBOV infection and disease development in mice, hamsters, and guinea pigs (234, 235). Esomeprazole and omeprazole were also found to inhibit viral entry during in vitro studies but higher concentrations of these drugs may be required when to be used in vivo (236). During the EBOV outbreak in Liberia in 2014, a reduction in fever cases was observed following mass administration of malaria chemoprevention drugs (237).",

Small interfering (si)RNA targeting RNA polymerase L protein has shown inhibition of EBOV replication and promising results for its use as a post-exposure therapeutic option (249). siRNAs and phosphorodiamidate morpholino oligomers (PMOs) targeting the EBOV RNA polymerase (L) protein protected NHPs against EVD (248, 249). PMOs target co-polymerase protein VP35 and membrane-associated protein VP24 for this protection (250). Antisense PMO-based drugs like AVI 6002, AVI-6003, and LNPs/siRNA (TKM-Ebola) are in clinical trials. TKM-Ebola is a mixture of three siRNAs that target the L, VP24, and VP35 proteins of Zaire EBOV. In NHPs, it efficiently provided post-exposure protection (249, 251). Although the results were promising, clinicians did not use much TKM-Ebola as it could lead to lethal overproduction of cytokines (a dangerous EBOV-induced inflammatory response) (232). A siRNA LNP product named TKM-130803 has been developed for EVD therapy. Although, the infusion of TKM-130803 at a dosage of 0.3 mg/kg/day through intravenous route to adult patients with severe clinical signs of EVD was comparable, it did not show an improved protection to the existing and classical controls (252). LNP-encapsulated short siRNAs protected 100% of rhesus monkeys exhibiting viremia and clinical illness (253). LNP encapsulation is also an effective drug delivery system (127, 253).",

Antiviral drug AVI-7537, targeting the VP24 gene of EBOV, has been shown to be efficacious in mice and monkeys (255). The EBOV-GP (cleaved) molecule acts as a ligand for NPC1, a transmembrane transfer protein. For entry of the virus into the target cell, an interaction between EBOV-GP and NPC1 domain C is necessary. Two small molecules, a sulfonamide (MBX2254) and a triazole thioether (MBX2270), have been identified as novel EBOV inhibitors suppressing EBOV infection in an in vitro model by blocking the entry of virus into target cell via inhibiting GP\u2013NPC1 protein interaction (256).

It helps in evaluating the in vivo anti-EBOV agents, viz., vaccines and drugs without the necessity of biosafety level-4 facilities. The system appears suitable in studying the process of viral entry also (259). The molecular tweezer CLR01 has been recently reported to inhibit EBOV and Zika virus infection. CLR01 interacts with the lipids in the viral envelop but not with the cellular membrane, thereby it is having very less effect on viability of cells (270). This small molecule has earlier been shown to possess antiviral activity against HIV-1 and herpes viruses. Such broad-spectrum antiviral agents need to be further explored to develop an effective drug against EBOV.",

Further research works need to be strengthened to identify potent viral or host targets that can be exploited to treat EVD or inhibit EBOV. With advances in bioinformatics tools, it is now possible to identify the active sites of the viral targets which can be utilized as a critical step toward designing and discovering anti-EBOV drugs (272). The involvement of computational tools has widened our approach toward designing drugs (target based) widely. Computational approaches can also countervail the endemic burdens in development of drugs traditionally (271, 273). Large libraries can now be effectively screened, ultimately stimulating research activities toward identifying potent anti-EBOV drugs. Therapeutic applications of cytokines, recombinant proteins, RNAi technology/RNA interference, TLRs, avian egg yolk antibodies, plant-based pharmaceuticals, nanomedicines, immunomodulatory agents, probiotics, herbs/plant extracts, and others may be explored appropriately to combat EBOV, as these have been found promising against other viral pathogens (2, 249, 274\u2013282).",

In the case of Ebola, deviations in the touchstone drug/vaccine research approaches may be permitted by authorities to an appropriate extent, considering the devastating and alarming pandemic threat from the disease. In recent years, several therapies have emerged to tackle lethal EBOV infections. A plant-derived formulation of humanized mAbs: \u201cZMapp\u201d has been used to treat some patients. However, the shortage of ZMapp supply warrants the evaluation and development of new mAbs. Various drugs have been repurposed to treat potentially lethal disease like EVD. There is a long list of repurposed compounds that have been evaluated as inhibitors of EBOV, including microtubule inhibitors, estrogen receptor and reuptake modulators, kinase inhibitors, histamine antagonists, and ion channel blockers. In-depth studies are still required to understand the pathogenesis and the role of different EBOV peptides, proteins, and antigens and host\u2013virus interactions in EVD. There is also a need to develop economic and effective antivirals and vaccines against EBOV having approach/utility to any part of the world including resource poor countries.",

Hence, the hunt for an effective vaccine is still on. Ebola VLPs play an imperative role in high-throughput screening of anti-EBOV compounds. Because five EBOV species have been reported, a polyvalent vaccine having immunogenic determinants such as GP from each of species would provide broader immunity; indeed, in nonhuman primate experimental studies with a DNA vaccine, this is commonly true. The best first-generation vaccine candidates for EBOV are rVSV and ChAd3, as reflected by their application in providing long duration protection during sporadic outbreaks. Various combinations of antigens from different species of EBOV may be explored to achieve higher protective immune response. The rVSV-based vaccine is being used in Democratic Republic of the Congo. Due to absence of preexisting immunity to VSV, it eliminates several drawbacks and safety concerns associated Ad5-based vaccine. Also, it has show long-term protection in several NHP models, it is an ideal vaccine platform to be used at time of outbreak. Together, the GamEvac-Combi vaccine also seems to be equally promising as it generated immune response in 100% volunteers.",

In the era of genomics, a computational approach may also be employed to screen large numbers of inhibitory molecules to safeguard human health.
