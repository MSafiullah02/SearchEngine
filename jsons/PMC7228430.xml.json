            "text": "The present authors first envisaged the mediation of rumination in relation to uncertainty and wellbeing. One of the main postulations that informs an individual\u2019s vulnerability to depression is the theory of response styles (Nolen-Hoeksema 1991; Nolen-Hoeksema et al. 2008). In this theory, rumination broadly describes repetitive speculations as the cause and consequences of an individual\u2019s current psychological symptoms (Nolen-Hoeksema 1991). Therefore, rumination is considered as a way of thinking that deepens and maintains depression (P\u00f6ssel 2011). A possible reason for this is the retrieval of negatively charged emotional experiences from autobiographical memory with rumination (Lyubomirsky et al. 1998). Another factor is that when individuals think about bad situations or memories, they may ruminate more than when thinking about good ones (Zullow et al. 1988). Research has demonstrated that rumination may threaten mental health (e.g., Bravo et al. 2020) and increase negative moods (Genet and Siemer 2012), including depression (Ciesla and Roberts 2007). Moreover, intrusive rumination can trigger posttraumatic stress disorder when faced with a traumatic event (Wozniak et al. 2020).",

            "text": "In addition, rumination can facilitate negative emotions that can negatively affect the wellbeing of the individual during the trauma process. Consequently, rumination may strengthen anger when experiencing something traumatic (Christ et al. 2020). Additionally, rumination may weaken an individual\u2019s sense of mastery, reinforce the perception of loss of control, and cause depressive emotions to be prolonged Nolen-Hoeksema et al. 1999). Therefore, in the present research study, it was hypothesized that rumination fed by uncertainty may negatively affect wellbeing through fear of COVID-19 because the prominent feature of rumination is the focus on negative emotions (Nolen-Hoeksema 1991). The media plays an important role in the dissemination of information in the pandemic, and continuous exposure to COVID-19 pandemic-related information can keep the sense of threat alive (Garfin et al. 2020). The rapid flow of information in both traditional and social media leads to confusion and increases uncertainty. At this this current time of information overload concerning COVID-19, individuals who ruminate more may inflate the perception of threat and experience more fear of the COVID-19 pandemic. Consequently, psychological wellbeing can deteriorate beyond the inherent negativities of the pandemic. In line with these data and based on previous findings in the literature, the present study proposes the following hypotheses (Hs):H1. Intolerance of uncertainty will be negatively related to mental wellbeing.H2. The relationship between intolerance of uncertainty and mental wellbeing will be mediated by rumination.H3. The relationship between intolerance of uncertainty and mental wellbeing will be mediated by fear of COVID-19.H4. The relationship between intolerance of uncertainty and mental wellbeing will be serially mediated by rumination and fear of COVID-19.",

Gender and age were controlled for as covariates. The advantage of this procedure, as noted by Van Jaarsveld, Walker, and Skarlicki (2010), is that it enables isolation of each mediator\u2019s indirect effect: rumination (H2) and fear of COVID-19 (H3). Furthermore, this approach also allows investigation of \u201cthe indirect effect passing through both of these mediators in a series\u201d (Van Jaarsveld et al. 2010, p. 1496) (H4). The statistical significance of the mediating variable was investigated using 5000 bootstrap samples. This method generated 95% confidence intervals (CI) of the indirect effects. Bootstrapped 95% CIs not straddling zero were considered statistically significant (Hayes 2018). All data analyses were conducted using IBM SPSS Statistics 22 and JASP 0.11.1.",

The limitation due to the correlational nature of the research may be eradicated by using stress-priming studies in a laboratory environment. In this way, emotional consequences of rumination used in case of stress can be observed. Although the present study was carried out among a relatively large sample, the use of cross-sectional data collection is a limitation. Consequently, more valid findings would be generated by testing the associations reported here utilizing a longitudinal research design.

In this context, the attachment-based intolerance to uncertainty reduction program in Turkey for adolescents has been developed and implemented (Yildiz and Iskender 2019). Similar programs may be implemented in online settings, especially targeting risk groups. In addition, audio and visual materials in which internal dialogues with and without rumination are played can be prepared and shared by counselors. Moreover, to deal with uncertainty caused by pseudo-science and information, accurate and filtered knowledge about the COVID-19 pandemic can be shared with clients and the general community through social media channels.",
