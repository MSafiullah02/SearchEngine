Priorities and activity in the workplace have fundamentally changed during the pandemic, not least the rapid move within the musculoskeletal field to remote consultations. Across the world, physiotherapy associations have developed guidance on remote service delivery options, including advice on telephone and video consultations in musculoskeletal practice (WCPT, 2020. CSP, 2020). The recommendation is that once a triage decision has taken place the majority of consultations should be conducted remotely, with few if any face to face. Yet despite COVID-19 the time frames of emergency and urgent management for musculoskeletal conditions remain the same; therefore communication skills have never been more important than now.",

Working \u2018closely\u2019 with patients in a therapeutic alliance in monitoring symptoms over time in the shared decision making process of ongoing management is critical. This safety netting approach needs to be developed more strongly within physiotherapy generally and it also needs to be firmly embedded in remote consultations to provide appropriate assurances.

The focus of all consultations should encompass the exclusion of potential serious pathology and when necessary, signpost to appropriate services via the emergency or urgent care pathway (NHS, 2020). Whilst this is common sense, clinical reasoning is not always straight forward and patients do not always fall into clear diagnostic categories (Comer et al., 2019); remote consultations can sometimes result in the decision making being even more of a challenge. With the additional ramifications of social restrictions around the world, appropriate onward management can also be a conundrum. The decision to suggest to a patient, especially one recognised as at risk of contracting COVID-19, that they break their shielding status to be examined or investigated for a suspected musculoskeletal condition requires very robust clinical reasoning. In the context of the current health care crisis both clear communication and time can be important diagnostic tools.",

For instance a 75 year old patient with ongoing treatment for prostate cancer presenting with worsening unfamiliar back pain, much worse during the night and precluding sleep would be worrying. Therefore a decision to move them along a potential serious spinal pathology local pathway would be appropriate. However, a 75 year old with no history of cancer and a recurrence of episodic back pain, slightly different to usual, with the patient in a current shielding situation is a different matter. The risks of bringing this patient out of shielding could far outweigh the benefits. Social isolation has added a significant new dimension to the clinical decision of making a risk benefit analysis. The last patient may or may not have a serious cause for back pain, however if they move from a shielding situation they are at increased risk of contracting COVID-19 with potentially fatal consequences. We need to work closely with our patients in these situations using shared decision making skills and consider using \u2018time\u2019 as a tool in our reasoning process (Cook et al., 2018). Safety is fundamental within every patient consultation; safety netting using clear communication allows us to do that.",

Particularly in the prodromal early stages of cancer, symptoms are non-specific and indistinguishable from other common conditions (Bankhead et al., 2011). The clinical consequence of this early uncertainty is that diagnoses of some cancers are often delayed. Managing this uncertainty on a daily basis requires clinical skills that not only require in-depth clinical knowledge but robust communication skills. In the current climate embedding safety netting within our consultations is therefore not optional. Easton (2016) points out that this safety net must anticipate those at risk of the worst case scenario and clearly outlining actions to take should this worst case prove a reality. However, in the context of current global social restrictions this is not straight forward. For patients, the fear of COVID-19 is overshadowing other health concerns.

Despite improvements in survival and mortality in recent years, cancer outcomes in England fall far behind the best outcomes in Europe (Bankhead et al., 2011). This is said to be related mainly to late presentation (Ellis-Brookes et al., 2012). It is well known that those from socially deprived backgrounds, the elderly, alcoholics, drug addicts and males have a tendency to seek medical help late in the disease process. This is an extremely important concept to recognise in our current situation. Fear of contracting COVID-19 will confound the patient's decision of \u2018what to do\u2019 (Vrdoljak et al., 2020). As clinically astute as we aspire to be, if the patient does not present with developing symptoms at an early stage, early diagnosis of a serious condition is impossible.

Almond confirms the safety net advice should include specific clinical features (red flags) that the patient should be aware of, along with time scale for symptom development as well as the time and location for health seeking. They consider safety netting goes wrong in three ways; correct information is not given in high risk situations, the language used is not heard or understood and the content of information is unclear. A qualitative study on Cauda Equina Syndrome (CES) patients found that patients had an inability to concentrate when consumed by very severe acute pain and their ability to express subtle symptom progression was also negatively affected (Greenhalgh et al., 2016). As a consequence, CES credit cards were developed for patients at risk of CES, by CES sufferers and are a good example of safety netting advice (Greenhalgh et al., 2016).",

Let us return to our 75 year old during the current COVID 19 epidemic. There is no history of cancer but a recurrence of episodic back pain, feeling slightly different to usual. In addition they are in a shielding situation and likely to be fearful of leaving the safety of home. To avoid leaving the protection of shielding, safety netting can keep this patient safe by explaining the best ways to manage back pain using an evidenced based approach and how symptoms may respond over time. It is crucial that the explanation clearly outlines any Red Flags to be aware of such as escalating or band-like pain, lying flat increasing pain, sleep or gait disturbance. Ensure they understand exactly what to do if these symptoms do begin to emerge. If the patient falls into the group that may be reticent to \u2018bother\u2019 the clinician, arrange another remote appointment. Work with the patient as another valuable member of the clinical team to monitor symptoms over time.",

There potentially may be reticence within the population to seek face to face health care once national lockdown restrictions are released, particularly from those who know they are considered to be vulnerable. Within this future musculoskeletal practice model, whether consultations are remote or face to face, we need to consider the process of safety netting to be best practice in any physiotherapy setting to facilitate early presentation with a serious condition.",
