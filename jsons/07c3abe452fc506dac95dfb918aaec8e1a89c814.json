A study exploring human hand bacterial and fungal microbiome diversity discovered Malassezia spp. and Aspergillus spp. as the most common and second most common fungal microorganisms, respectively [10] . Additionally, infectious individuals who use their hands when covering a cough divert infective pathogens from the droplet route to the hand-fomite route, which has the potential to increase fomite transmission from highly touched devices [11] . Recently, the rapid spread of the SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus, responsible for COVID-19, has challenged the scientific community to identify the undetected pathways. With the current pandemic and its links to modern transport (i.e. planes, cruise ships) there has been a lot of interest in mobile phones as one of the pathways by which SARS-CoV-2 can be transmitted.",

A 2013 study by Sondhi and Devgan explored smartphone application in a paediatric ward. This study highlighted the effectiveness of smartphones with a wide range of applications including medical calculators (Qx, PICU calculator, Phototherapy calculator), drug information (Micromedex drug information, the Sanford guide to antimicrobial therapy), epidemiology (LearnStat) and medical news (MedPage). Additionally, the study indicates that such devices enable health care providers to connect with clinical information at the point of care, which ultimately provides patients with the best possible evidence-based practise. Of importance, the article suggests that mobile phone and smartphone use in the clinical setting can act as a source of distraction and potentially compromise the aseptic environment [17] .",

Combined with the fact that cleaning and disinfection of mobile phones is not a common practice with up to 72% of mobile phone users never washing their devices (Tajouri et al. Unpublished data). It is likely that they constitute a suitable fomite, meaning an inanimate platform with microbial contamination. The frequent handling of billions of mobile phones worldwide, which are often microbially contaminated, provides the potential for them to act as 'Trojan Horses', a term first presented by [20] enabling disease infection transmission globally.",

All but two publications (54 out of 56) targeted or reported on bacteria isolates; however, in multiple cases, only 'clinically important' or 'pathogenic' bacteria were presented in the results.

We salute this initial steps of public awareness of such fomites but as trojan horses contaminated platforms, such awareness need to become a global decontamination campaign complementing handwashing. While the CDC advises at home sick individuals to follow manufacturer's instructions, they also advise, in case of no guidance, to use alcoholbased wipes containing at least 70% alcohol [82] .

Additionally, it is important to highlight that such devices are rarely subject to decontamination while being commonly used in hospitals, clinics and other health care related settings. First line medical staff fighting actively working as part of the COVID-19 pandemic response have been routinely exposed and contaminated with SARS-CoV2 virus. COVID-19 pandemic images broadcasted worldwide through different forms of media have regularly shown examples of hospital staff with personal protective equipment holding and using their mobile phones (with and without) gloves on. It is our opinion and hypothesis, that mobile phones are most likely contributing to the spread of SARS-CoV2 within different professional settings including hospitals and may play a significant role in viral propagation within the community.",

The 2019 SARS-CoV-2 outbreak responsible for COVID-19 epidemy has presented an unprecedented high velocity of virus spread. While the ss+ RNA enveloped virus can be destroyed by hand washing with appropriate disinfectants, mobile phones once touched can re-contaminate the user and pose a biothreat risk for infection spread globally. They can contribute to crossing all borders especially as they are omnipresent in modern transport, and human-to-human social contact scenarios. Mobile phones can also contribute to the contamination and genesis of additional secondary fomites (door knobs, airport self-check in stations, bus polls, ATM monitors, lift buttons, etc...
