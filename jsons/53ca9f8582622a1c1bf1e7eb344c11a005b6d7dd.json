            "text": "Health care in Canada operates in a complex space where federal and provincial mandates intersect. Health care is considered a provincial responsibility but the majority of funding is provided by the federal government through the national Medicare program. The federal Liberal government has instituted, over three consecutive majority terms beginning in 1993, a massive reduction of funding transfers to the provinces. Beginning in 1995 the federal government removed regulations covering health care transfers that had previously ensured the funding went directly to health care. This move meant that monies that had previously been earmarked specifically for health care could now be spent on any other area the provincial government deemed necessary. This left Ontario's governments free to apply $987 million in federal health transfer money to such areas as hydro cost overruns (Diebel, 2003, p. A8) . Previously such moves would have been met with a financial penalty and a future loss of funds. This situation was compounded when former finance minister and former Prime Minister, Paul Martin, cut $6 billion from health care transfers to Ontario over four years between 1995 and 1999. Most of the harm to Ontario's health care system has been inflicted by the provincial Progressive Conservative (Tory) government. SARS, like the Walkerton tragedy before it, which saw several people die and hundreds become sick after privatization and cuts to water inspection contributed to E. coli contamination of the town's drinking water, revealed the extent of the damage done to the health care system in Ontario by the Tories. When the Tories assumed power in 1995 under the leadership of Eve's predecessor Mike Harris, they pursued a stated policy of creating a crisis in public services in order to encourage privatization and cutbacks. Harris withdrew $1.3 billion from hospitals to underwrite a policy of tax cuts for the wealthy and corporations (Diebel, 2003, p. A1) . With regard to health care, Harris maintained that Ontario employed too many nurses and worked to reduce staffing levels by laying off thousands of nurses. Between 1995 and 1999, 25,000 hospital positions were cut in Ontario (Diebel, 2003, p. A8 ). In addition, much of nursing in the province was casualized with 50% of nurses working part-time, often holding down two or three jobs at separate hospitals. Only 18 months prior to the SARS outbreak the government fired five leading laboratory scientists who worked with a Toronto reference laboratory unit that monitored coming infections and new disease threats. 'Hospitals and public health units across Ontario relied on their work' (Toronto Star, 2003b, p. A9) .",

Despite the concerns raised by SARS, the funding level is still below necessary amounts. Much of the responsibility has been passed onto municipalities that lack the resources to cope properly. In Toronto, the public health department requires $5 million to reach a full complement of staff (Toronto Star, 2003a, p. F6) . Due to budget constraints resulting from chronic under-funding by the provincial government, the department was short 65 workers around the time preceding, during and following the SARS outbreak. During the crisis people were pulled off of other programs to assist with SARS and health workers had to be brought to Toronto from other areas of the province.",

Likewise cuts to health care put systems under greater strain and left fewer resources to pick up the extra work (resulting in delays for people requiring other services). Not only does Ontario's health care system have little or no room for 'surge capacity', the insurance against unexpected outbreaks or emergencies, but it also lacks adequate capacity to meet ongoing needs, a problem that persists to the present day. SARS was a relatively narrowly confined illness, affecting primarily health care workers and family members of SARS patients, which should have been quickly and easily contained. Unfortunately few Ontario hospitals have the necessary number of infectioncontrol nurses, as outlined by provincial recommendations. The diminished state of Ontario's health care system, with inadequate facilities and staff levels for proper infection control, means that 'the spread of infections such as SARS is inevitable' according to the former chief of infectious diseases at Toronto's Hospital for Sick Children (quoted in Diebel, 2003, p. A8) . This already untenable situation was exacerbated by the response to the outbreak which saw the closing of hospitals to all but the most serious cases and the cancellation of hundreds of operations. Several otherwise avoidable deaths during the crisis were attributed to delayed or canceled operations (Diebel, 2003) . Clearly public health care in Ontario requires a substantial increase in resources.",

Using a retrospective analysis of hospital admission data from the GTA prior to, during and after the SARS outbreak, two sets of investigators (Schull et al., 2007; Schabas, 2007) concluded that hospital restrictions resulted in only a modest decrease in the rate of admissions. Worse, hospital restrictions may have inhibited potentially seriously ill patients from seeking medical attention. Many people with serious conditions had surgeries canceled because hospitals were considered contaminated areas, and some of those people died. At three hospitals of the University Health Network, 1,050 surgical procedures were canceled as a result of SARS, including transplants, cancer and heart surgeries, hip and knee replacements and lens implants (Singer, 2007) . As well, radiation, chemotherapy, dialysis physiotherapy and other treatments were canceled (Singer, 2007) .

It would appear that in the case of SARS in Toronto, these conditions were not met. Indeed they were not even approached. Singer (2007) also argues that society has a duty to ensure that those quarantined receive adequate care, are not kept in quarantine for unduly long periods and are not abandoned or psychosocially isolated. Again the experiences of quarantine in Toronto under SARS raise questions about the degree to which these obligations were fulfilled. While Singer (2007) also raises the need to eliminate economic barriers, such as income loss, that would prevent someone from following a quarantine order, it is quite clear that such economic supports were largely absent. Furthermore, restrictions were enacted against the informed analysis of front-line health workers.",

In the view of government officials the legislation, and the imposition of travel restrictions, represents a major step forward in developing preparedness in the event of a widely anticipated influenza pandemic. Critics such as Dr. Schabas counter that both the SARS experience and the particular biology of influenza should raise significant warning signs about the use of quarantine and travel restrictions during an influenza pandemic. In his view, not only would the costs of trying to establish quarantine be enormous, but also a system seeking to restrict travel and quarantine air passengers would be threatened with a descent into chaos (Schabas, 2007) . Schabas argues that national borders are not, and indeed, never have been, important lines of defense against infectious diseases. Yet it might be noted that the focus on detention and restrictions on mobility fit well with the broader emphasis on border controls and detention that have characterized Canadian social policy, particularly with regard to immigrant populations, since the terrorist attacks of 11 September 2001.",

Indeed, cuts to social spending for the poor and unemployed leaving thousands of families without proper diets and nutrition, declines in adequate social housing stocks, reduced health care expenditures and the shortage of family doctors in the province, as well as the lack of public coverage for pharmaceuticals all contribute to a context in Ontario in which the population is left more susceptible to broad health problems.",

A Ministry of Labour investigation during the outbreak found St. Michael's, as well as North York General, to be in violation of the Workplace Health and Safety Act for having provided inadequate equipment and training to nurses, including SARS masks that did not fit. The hospitals responded by threatening mandatory work to deal with the SARS cases. Finally, during the second outbreak, after weeks of serving stress-filled overtime shifts and suffering some of the city's highest infection rates, nurses, through their union, put forward a demand for 'danger pay'.

            "text": "Incredibly, other hospitals responded by laying off nurses. Lakeridge Health Corporation laid off 15 registered practical nurses, including 11 who were in quarantine at the time. Premier Eves responded to criticisms about the firings by claiming it was part of the province's attempt to build a 'flexible system' that 'would be able to move resources as we need them within the health-care system' (quoted in Boyle & Mallan, 2003, p. A6) . Indeed further layoffs were proposed as hospitals scrambled to make up a deficit of approximately $400 million. Of course the flexibilization of health care, a key aspect of Tory policy, had already placed the system in an extremely vulnerable position. Singer (2007) suggests that under SARS Toronto health care workers were, for the first time in a generation, forced to weigh their obligations to care for the sick against serious and imminent health risks to themselves and their families. With dozens of medical workers, primarily nurses, contracting SARS, difficult choices confronted health care workers across the city in a context in which hospital administrations and the government only heightened the stress that those workers faced. Putting their lives at risk to help others, health care workers feared contagion for themselves and their families and being shunned by others who viewed them as potentially infectious (Singer, 2007) . Many struggled with reduced human contact with sick and dying patients and the burdens imposed by cumbersome and uncomfortable equipment they were required to wear to protect themselves (Singer, 2007) . Loss of work and disrupted work routines, without proper compensation or support, added to stress. Many more lost work as their hospitals restricted admissions. Singer (2007) argues that, as health care workers have a duty to care, society and its institutions have a reciprocal duty to assist health workers. Policies in health care institutions should not penalize workers either financially, socially or emotionally. Workers must be compensated for loss of work on a dollar-for-dollar basis. As well information and support must be made available to workers, both so that they understand the risks they are facing and to ensure that their safety is regarded and protected as much as possible. None of these circumstances was adequately present during the SARS outbreak. Furthermore, health care workers' duty to care must be met by a mutual respect for their need to care for themselves, both as a human right and in order to ensure that they can properly carry out their work.",

Tellingly, Premier Eves (now former Premier) canceled two prior election announcements, including one that had been planned for the week in which the second outbreak occurred, lest the election become a referendum on Tory health care policies. Anger over the Tory bungling of the SARS crisis was still running high, extending into their support base among suburban consumers in the regions surrounding Toronto, at the time of October's election and likely contributed to the loss of several key Tory ridings in the city's suburbs. Notably, health minister Clement, a major figure in the party, was among the casualties. Now into a second term, the provincial Liberal government has failed to maintain its election commitment to restore funding and resources to Ontario's health care system.

            "text": "Infectious diseases can now travel the globe quickly, in a matter of hours rather than years. In a globalized world the need for solidarity becomes crucial (Singer, 2007) . This has long been a central theme of the alternative globalization movements that have emerged to mobilize for a globalization of social justice, fairness and equality rather than a globalization of 'free trade', markets and economic exploitation. Solidarity means working on the basis of mutual aid and support with others who are less powerful, wealthy or healthy (Singer, 2007) . A key challenge of the global era is to understand and address the complex interconnections between globalization and health and to develop ways to overcome global health inequalities in different regions (Singer, 2007) . Some of the instability and indeed trauma of globalization might be lessened through the nurturing of a global health ethic of solidarity. Health impacts are felt far more severely and do greater damage in poor, rural areas, but diseases can spread to wealthier, urban areas, as SARS showed, so those in wealthier centers have a self-interested, rather than purely compassionate, reason for developing an ethic of solidarity in dealing with health issues. Health, in privileged nations, is linked with health, or the lack of health, in poorer nations, especially as distinctions between domestic and foreign policy become blurred in the global age (Singer, 2007) . Addressing this will, of course, require significant socio-political shifts. As Singer (2007) suggests, along with solidarity we need transparency, honesty and good communication over health issues at global levels. Information sharing becomes a crucial part of ensuring the public good globally. This may involve the development of new governance mechanisms, and should, as alternative globalization advocates have argued, be carried out as part of a democratization process that includes greater citizen involvement in national as well as global governance. One example might include citizen fora and community panels, and transnational community organizations which bring together grassroots community members to share information and resources. This would involve the participation of health care workers but also unionists and workers in relevant industries such as food production, bringing people together across borders to share ideas and material resources that might allow for a restructuring of work and subsistence such that the causal conditions behind major outbreaks are avoided or lessened. It is not coincidental that SARS and, more recently, H1N1 have roots in farming practices within conditions of poverty and insufficient resources. Other example would include the inclusion of health care workers and their union representatives within community policy panels.",

At the same time the neo-liberal emphasis on individualized health care and decreases to public welfare leave growing numbers of people susceptible to harm, without adequate resources to care for themselves and their communities.",

It showed fundamentally and often starkly that emerging epidemics are about political economy as much as anything. SARS brought to the fore relations of inequality, power, poverty, democracy and governance and the distribution of resources within capitalist societies such as Canada in the global period. It showed that relations of power and inequality are central in giving rise to epidemics but also in inhibiting the capacities of people, such as health care workers, to respond adequately, despite their often heroic efforts. Even advanced health care systems are imperiled by persistent disparities in wealth and access to resources and decision-making processes. These are lessons that must still be learned and acted upon in light of ongoing threats of emerging epidemics in the current period. As more people are negatively impacted through economic crisis, and as economic 'recovery' programs retrench neo-liberal policies and re-distribute public resources to private capital, the lessons of SARS, and its social underpinnings, press even more forcefully upon us.",
