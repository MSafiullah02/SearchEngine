            "text": "For influenza pandemic preparedness, global and national response systems need to balance the apocalyptic-like risk of a repeat of the great pandemic of 1918\u201319, which was estimated to have infected some 500 million people worldwide with tens of millions of deaths, and a worldwide over-reaction to a milder, less severe outbreak of the influenza virus. Influenza virus's great versatility, persistence, and potentially rapid spread and severity means that optimising global mechanisms to respond to it will always be a work in progress.16 WHO has published interim guidance on pandemic influenza risk management that describes pandemic phases along a continuum according to a global average of cases over time, based on continued risk assessment and consistent with actions linked to a broader emergency risk management framework (figure 2\n).17 The new guidance builds on recommendations stemming from a WHO review of the coordinated response to the 2009 H1N1 pandemic,4, 16, 17 and substantial changes have been made to the pandemic preparedness plan (the panel\nshows a summary of the guidance).17 There is a new approach to the global phases of pandemics: simplified to four phases, these are now uncoupled from action at the country level with an emphasis on providing guidance and Member States retaining responsibility and flexibility for their own national risk management plans. The plan now recommends adopting an all-hazards approach using the Emergency Risk Management for Health Framework (ERM-H) and embedding aspects of planning at every level of society including key aspects of determining pandemic influenza risk (ie, transmissibility, severity of disease, and likely effect in national action plans). The development of the Pandemic Influenza Preparedness (PIP) Framework for the sharing of influenza viruses and access to vaccines and other benefits brings together WHO Member States, WHO, industry, and other stakeholders to improve and strengthen the sharing of influenza viruses with human pandemic potential, and achieve more predictable, efficient, and equitable access for countries needing vaccines and medicines during future pandemics; the framework therefore recognises that there is an ethical dimension to pandemic planning.18\nPanelEvolving approach to pandemic influenza preparedness: the interim WHO guidance17,18\nCoordination under the International Health Regulations (IHR, 2005)\nThe International Health Regulations (2005) are binding upon 196 States Parties and provide a global legal framework to prevent, control, or respond to public health risks that might spread between countries including serious events that endanger global public health, specified by the regulations as public health emergencies of international concern (PHEICs). A PHEIC is defined as \u201can extraordinary event which is determined to constitute a public health risk to other States through the international spread of disease and to potentially require a coordinated international response\u201d. This definition implies a situation that: is serious, sudden, unusual, or unexpected; carries implications for public health beyond the affected state's national border; and might require immediate international action. The responsibility of determining whether an event is within this category lies with the WHO Director-General and requires the subsequent convening of a committee of health experts\u2014the IHR Emergency Committee.\nPandemic phases\nThe pandemic influenza phases show WHO's risk assessment of the global situation regarding influenza viruses with pandemic potential that are infecting human beings. These assessments are based on evolving virological, epidemiological, and clinical data. The global phases\u2014interpandemic, alert, pandemic, and transition\u2014describe the spread of the influenza virus subtype, taking account of the disease it causes worldwide. As countries face different risks at different times they are advised to develop their own national risk assessments and management plans while taking into consideration the information and support provided by WHO.\nPandemic Influenza Preparedness (PIP) Framework\nThe framework provides a mechanism for sharing of influenza viruses and access to vaccines and other benefits and brings together Member States, industry, other key stakeholders, and WHO for this reason. The framework, effective as of May 24, 2011, comprises three core components. Virus sharing, whereby Member States share PIP biological materials to ensure ongoing global monitoring and risk assessment, and the development of safe and effective influenza vaccines. Benefit sharing, whereby Member States and WHO aim to ensure that benefits from the sharing of PIP biological materials are made more accessible and available to countries based on public health risk and need. And lastly, governance and review. The framework puts in place an oversight mechanism with three pillars. The World Health Assembly oversees implementation of the PIP Framework, the WHO Director-General promotes its implementation, and the Advisory Group provides guidance to the Director-General, monitors PIP Framework implementation, and reports annually to the Director-General on progress. More broadly, WHO acts as the secretariat for implementing the PIP Framework and works with private and public partners to help in achieving results as efficiently as possible.\nRisk assessment and the Emergency Risk Management for Health Framework\nThe national risk assessment process for pandemic preparedness should analyse three essential indicators: transmissibility, severity of disease, and impact. The Emergency Risk Management for Health Framework describes measures to manage risks through prevention and mitigation, and preparing for, responding to, and recovering from emergencies including influenza pandemics. This all-hazards approach is recommended for national influenza risk management plans and includes action across six key domains: policies and resource management; planning and coordination; information and knowledge management; health infrastructure and logistics; health and related service; and community capacities.",

It was originally conceived with a principal aim to develop a coordinated approach with shared responsibilities to contain the emergence and spread of human and animal diseases. In recent years this has expanded to include other non-disease-specific collaborations, including antimicrobial resistance arising from human and non-human use of antimicrobials. With the development of the Global Early Warning System and the possibility for further integration of harmonised surveillance, alert, and response systems across disease areas, the potential exists to further improve worldwide pandemic preparedness plans through this agreement. The FAO and OIE have already developed a joint Network of Expertise on Animal Influenza (OFFLU) to support international efforts to monitor and control infections of avian influenza. Links between OFFLU and the WHO Global Influenza Surveillance and Response System (GISRS) have been strengthened, facilitating a free exchange of information and the establishment of joint technical projects between the networks.59 Strengthening one-health partnerships at the global level could eventually lead to a further evolution of the global influenza pandemic plan; one which embeds a one-health approach explicitly and incorporates a mechanism for detecting and responding to both animal and human pandemics worldwide.",

International Organization for Standardization (ISO) certification and quality assurance for large centralised livestock and poultry holdings in both developing and developed countries could be linked to the maintenance of a basic surveillance system for detecting infections in livestock, which could be achieved by one-health engagement with technical committees developing ISO standards.60 Concerns about increased costs of production from operating such surveillance systems could be offset by the benefit of earlier detection and control of livestock outbreaks.61 The advent of new technologies allows for real-time syndromic surveillance systems across both animal (livestock) and human populations by the use of tablet and mobile phone-based platforms for data collection.57\n",

The ban was only partly effective with animals from Somalia crossing to Saudi Arabia through other intermediate countries. Upgrading of port quarantine and livestock export facilities at Bossasso and Berbera, through Saudi investment in ensuing years, however, ensured that Somalia was able to export animals to more countries and gave importing countries the reassurance that animals being purchased were disease free and operations were in compliance with international OIE standards. This bilateral agreement benefited both countries in trade, human, and animal health terms and could be a template for other one-health initiatives.63 Wealthy Gulf Arab states are bilaterally supporting the development of other agricultural and livestock systems in low-income countries as a way to strengthen food security and an opportunity exists to incorporate control programmes for EIDs, such as influenza and corona viruses, in that process.64 The one-health approach to EID control potentially aligns national, global, and health and trade priorities.",
