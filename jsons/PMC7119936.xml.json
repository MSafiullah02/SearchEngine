They are implicated in diseases involving the respiratory tract, the digestive system, and the central nervous system (Vabret et al., 1998). Apart from rhinitis, human coronavirus is associated with more severe pulmonary infection (Myint, 1994). As for other respiratory viruses (influenza viruses, rhinoviruses), they are associated with bronchitic hyperactivity even in non-atopic patients (Trigg et al., 1996, Freymuth et al., 1999). Epidemiological inquiries have led to the conclusion that these viruses circulate widely in seasonal oubreaks.",

The reference detection technique is electron microscopy. Electron microscopy is not a sensitive technique, and it requires an experienced technician. In respiratory samples, images of coronavirus are very hard to differentiate from other cellular structures. Search of intracellular viral antigen by direct immunofluorescence on respiratory cells is disappointing, and many diagnostic laboratories do not undertake this test. In our laboratory, only one marketed antibody (PIV-11646, Arg\u00e8ne France) was used between 1996 and 1999 for the systemic search of coronavirus 229E in nasal aspirates sampled from hospitalised children, and bronchoalveolar liquids (BAL) from hospitalised adults. Among the 7120 tests done, only six samples (five bronchoalveolar liquid and one nasal aspirate) were found positive for HCoV-229E (data not shown). The sensitivity of this antibody has not been defined in viral diagnosis and it is possible that the epitopes recognized are only slightly or not expressed by the cells infected by the wild-type HCoV-229E. Furthermore, the specificity of that monoclonal antibody is not defined.",

Each amplified PCR product is submitted to a molecular hybridization that uses a specific probe recognising HCoV-229E or HCoV-OC43, thus on one hand allowing a control of its specificity, and on the other hand an increase of its sensitivity.

Two reasons justify this choice: this protein is a priori well conserved and the correspondent RNAm is present in large amounts in the infected cell (Van Der Most and Spaan, 1995). We decided to compare two of these primers with an original system defined in the M protein gene. Of all the protein components of the virion, the M protein is the most abundant. It is a transmembranous protein with a N-terminal hydrophilic ectodomain and three hydrophobic regions containing three transmembrane helixes (Rottier, 1995). The nucleotidic sequence of its gene is a priori conserved. The results obtained show that in the prototype strains and in the detection, these primers permit a very sensitive detection assay on a scale of 0.05 TCID50 for HCoV-229E and 0.01 TCID50 for HCoV-OC43. These methods, therefore, allow the detection of less than one infectious particle. The phenomenon can be explained by the synthesis in cell culture of many defective particles. These particles contain identifiable genetic material, but do not have the capacity to infect other cells.",

The method used was a RT-PCR duplex HCoV-229E and HCoV-OC43, followed by a molecular hybridization on microplates. The primers are localised in the gene of the N nucleocapside protein and are different from those used in this study. The results show that the coronavirus was found in 2.6% of the samples (46 in total, 21 HCoV-OC43 and 25 HCoV-229E), of which half were obtained from children presenting other infectious diseases (Nokso-Koivisto et al., 2000): bronchitis, pneumonia, quinsy, laryngitis, conjunctivitis, and exanthema. In order to compare the sensitivity of the different molecular methods described for the detection of coronaviruses 229E and OC43, it is advisable to apply in parallel many respiratory specimens since the percentage of positive samples found in the studies is low, around 3%. It is also necessary to correlate those results with the clinical signs presented by the patients, and to study controls without respiratory clinical signs.",
