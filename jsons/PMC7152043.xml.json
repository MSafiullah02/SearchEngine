Each species typically causes an undifferentiated febrile illness characterized by periodic fevers, chills, headache, muscle aches, malaise, and sometimes nausea and vomiting. Symptoms are essentially the same across all five species and so have no discriminating value. Each species may also progress to a severe and complicated systemic illness (P. falciparum may do so more often and with greater rapidity) comprising cerebral, pulmonary, renal, hepatic, or circulatory dysfunction.

The World Health Organization (WHO) definition of severe malaria has criteria for both adults and children and is based mostly on data from malaria-endemic countries (Table 17.2\n). In one European series of 185 patients with imported severe malaria (2006 WHO criteria), the main features seen were (i) hyperparasitemia >5% (~71%), (ii) jaundice (44%), (iii) impaired consciousness/coma (25%), (iv) acute kidney injury (19%), (v) shock (15%), (vi) respiratory failure/ARDS (12%), (vii) spontaneous bleeding (7%), (viii) acidosis (5%), (ix) hypoglycemia (3%), and (x) multiple convulsions (2%).4 The median number of WHO criteria was 2, and some 40% of patients had an underlying comorbidity. These data are broadly consistent with those from an earlier series of 400 patients, reported by Bruneel et al.5 who highlighted the contribution of community (7.5% patients) and hospital-acquired (16.6%) bacterial infections to malaria-related morbidity. One important consequence of treating nonimmune, severe malaria patients with intravenous artesunate (IV AS) is delayed (up to ~3 weeks) acute hemolytic anemia (AHA), which may require transfusion; this occurred in 19 (27%) of 70 IV AS\u2013treated patients.4\n",

Chloroquine (CQ) is used commonly to treat P. vivax, P. malariae, P. ovale, and P. knowlesi. However, CQ-resistant P. vivax is well documented in Southeast Asia, the Indonesian archipelago, and Papua New Guinea with reported foci in a range of countries. If in doubt, use an ACT.

Atovaquone proguanil is available widely and retains efficacy against P. falciparum (failures reported from western Cambodia), P. vivax, and P. knowlesi. For individuals who have been taking chemoprophylaxis, typically doxycycline, atovaquone proguanil, or mefloquine, treatment should exclude these drugs.",

Diligence to fluid balance is important because the risk of fluid overload precipitating pulmonary edema is increased due to increased pulmonary capillary leakage. Patients should be kept \u201cdry\u201d while maintaining adequate perfusion and renal function. An input-output chart is essential, but a central venous\u2013pressure line is not useful in guiding fluid management. Reserve aggressive fluid resuscitation for patients who are shocked but still exercise caution and observe carefully for a response. Limit the number of fluid challenges and seek early ICU advice regarding the use of vasopressors. Shock in severe malaria may be due to a concurrent bacterial infection, which also contributes to metabolic acidosis and the development of ARDS. Take blood and other cultures and treat promptly with a broad-spectrum antibiotic. AKI in severe malaria is hypercatabolic and early renal replacement treatment may be needed. Convulsions should be managed in the standard way; look for and correct hypoglycemia, hypocalcemia, hyponatremia, and hypoxia. Hypoglycemia may occur in severe malaria, particularly in quinine-treated patients even in the recovery phase. Regular blood glucose concentrations by fingerstick are necessary: every 4 hours routinely, every 2 hours during quinine infusions, and at any time a patient has a convulsion and/or reduced level of consciousness. Treat hypoglycemia acutely with 10% dextrose and prevent further episodes with 5% or 10% dextrose infusions as part of fluid maintenance. Full blood counts, clotting, and biochemistry (including calcium, magnesium, and phosphate) should be monitored closely, especially if AKI develops. Daily malaria parasite counts are needed to monitor parasite clearance. Blood transfusion should follow local ICU guidelines. Platelet transfusions are not indicated even with low counts unless there is active bleeding.",
