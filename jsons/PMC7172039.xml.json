            "text": "Community acquired respiratory tract infections are frequent and constitute an important cause of morbidity in Sweden and other European countries. A significant part of these infections are caused by viral pathogens (Creer et al., 2006, Diaz et al., 2007). It is often difficult for the clinician to distinguish between viral and bacterial aetiologies, and this may result in overuse of antibiotics (Lundborg et al., 2002). Diagnosis of viral respiratory tract infections using viral culture, antigen detection or serology is either too slow or too insensitive to be applicable in clinical practice (Gunson et al., 2005). The more reliable, specific and sensitive PCR methods have not yet won acceptance as the first choice for diagnosis owing to the high cost when several agents are targeted. Recently, multiplex assays that detect a large number of viral agents have been described. Some of these are based on traditional PCR (Bellau-Pujol et al., 2005, Gruteke et al., 2004, Liolios et al., 2001, Puppe et al., 2004), others on real-time PCR (Gunson et al., 2005, Kuypers et al., 2006, Templeton et al., 2004, Watzinger et al., 2004) or PCR combined with Luminex liquid chip hybridization and identification (Li et al., 2007).",

Amplification was then carried out in 50 \u03bcL reaction volumes, including 10 \u03bcL of sample preparation and 25 \u03bcL of one-step RT-PCR master mix from Applied Biosystems (this was exchanged to a master mix from Invitrogen (Carlsbad, CA) in the later part of the study period to improve sensitivity). After a reverse transcription step at 46 \u00b0C for 30 min followed by 10 min of denaturation at 95 \u00b0C, 45 cycles of two-step PCR was performed (15 s at 95 \u00b0C, 60 s at 58 \u00b0C). Each sample was amplified in 5 parallel reactions, each containing primers and probes specific for 3 targets (mixtures A\u2013E), as described in Table 1\n. Multiplexing tended to hamper the performance of the amplification significantly for many combinations, and therefore the reagent mixtures were carefully evaluated: combinations were only accepted if the Ct value in multiplex was no more than 2 cycles higher than when detection was carried out in separate reactions. The performance was evaluated using pUC57 plasmids with inserts of the targeted viral or bacterial sequences, synthesized by by GenScript Corp. (Piscataway, NJ).",

The procedure was run every working day and results from samples arriving in the morning could be delivered during the same day to the clinician. The positivity rate (48%) is comparable with previous reports with similar study subjects. The rate of RSV and IfB were remarkably low, probably because these infections had appeared in extensive epidemics the preceding year.",

We have also noted that inclusion of bacterial agents has promoted the willingness from clinicians to use our service, probably because Mycoplasma pneumoniae or Ch. pneumoniae infections may require antibiotic treatment. Viral detection may support the clinician's decision to avoid antibiotics, or may prompt antiviral treatment such as oseltamivir (against influenza) to the patient or exposed family members. Identifying the aetiology also allows the clinician to better inform the patient about the prognosis and ways of limiting the spread to other individuals. We therefore believe that an expanded use of molecular diagnostics of respiratory infections is of great clinical value. It should, of course, be kept in mind that viral agents detected by highly sensitive assays might reflect asymptomatic infection rather that being the cause of the present illness, and that an identified viral agent does not exclude concomitant bacterial infection. To some extent, the probability that a given agent constitutes an aetiological agent should be related to the Ct value: The lower Ct value, the higher the probability, and this may also be of relevance for the interpretation of double infections. Further studies of respiratory infection aetiologies in different patient categories, and of the clinical utility of this and similar multiplex assays, need to be carried out.",
