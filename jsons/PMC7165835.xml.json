Furthermore, the importance of systems and computational biology was stressed, whatever emerging disease was being investigated (Poland et al., 2011). In addition to the summaries later of six presentations on this topic, this Special Supplement includes an article, Monitoring of West Nile Virus Infections in Germany by Dr. U. Ziegler et al. which identified West Nile Virus (WNV) antibodies in migratory birds, but not in resident birds, in domestic poultry or in local horse populations throughout Germany. The WNV antibody\u2010positive species were found in birds that migrate to tropical Africa or southern Europe; however, WNV\u2010specific RNA could not be found in any of the samples.",

Professor Diuk\u2010Wasser began by noting that West Nile Virus (WNV) was introduced into New York City in 1999 by unknown means and was now considered endemic throughout the USA, with 29,700 human cases and 1,180 deaths in the USA since 1999. It had been hypothesized that increased biodiversity leads to a decreased risk of exposure to zoonotic pathogens (Keesing et al., 2006). At issue is whether this \u2018dilution effect\u2019 or \u2018Zooprophylaxis\u2019 for vector\u2010borne pathogens applies only when vectors are generalist feeders, because the link between host diversity and pathogen transmission might break down when vectors exhibit host preferences.",

Previous studies had detected that a large proportion of C. pipiens and C. restuans bloodmeals were derived from American robins (Turdus migratorius), suggesting a key role for this bird species in the WNV transmission cycle (Kilpatrick et al., 2006; Molaei et al., 2006). The New Haven\u2010based research team tested for preferential feeding by conducting equal choice experiments (robins versus other bird species) (Simpson et al., 2009) and by comparing the proportion of Culex spp. bloodmeals acquired from robins to the proportion of robins in the local bird community. Both methods indicated preferential feeding for robins. They were also able to identify robin communal roosts as amplification foci in greater New Haven (Diuk\u2010Wasser et al., 2010). Then, through field\u2010informed mathematical modelling, they determined that host preferences were indeed key drivers of WNV transmission and that landscape attributes (such as urbanization) in combination with mosquito abundance and a measure of host community competence were the strongest predictors of pathogen prevalence (Simpson et al., 2011). Thus, it was clear that pathogen prevalence and human risk of infection were best predicted by assessing the relative pathogen competence and attractiveness to vectors of all species in the host community, rather than using simple measures of biodiversity.",

Krause (Yale School of Public Health, New Haven, CT, USA) stressed that species interactions within a parasite community drive infection risk in a wildlife population (Telfer et al., 2010). At least five tick\u2010borne pathogens are known to be transmitted by Ixodes scapularis, the principal vector of Lyme disease in the United States: (i) Borrelia burgdorferi, an agent of Lyme disease; (ii) Anaplasma phagocytophilum, an agent of human anaplasmosis; (iii) Babesia microti, an agent of human babesiosis; (iv) Borrelia miyamotoi, an agent of relapsing fever; and (v) the Powassan encephalitis virus. Two or more of these pathogens can be transmitted either simultaneously by a single tick or sequentially by successive tick\u2010bites, resulting in 240 different permutations of mixed\u2010infection studies. In the context of pathogen prevalence of Ixodes scapularis nymphs, Borrelia burgdorferi, has been found in 19.8% of samples from the north\u2010east and mid\u2010western United States, while Babesia miroti has been found in 14.7% of samples from Block Island, Rhode Island.",

Outcomes of mixed infections in mice have been measured by R\no, the fitness parameter and basic reproductive rate which indicates the number of secondary tick infections resulting from a primary infection (Levin and Fish, 2004). The observed outcomes of dual mixed infections have been variable with both positive and negative effects on R\no, while interactions have been mutual, unidirectional or null. These diverse pathogen interactions play an important role in determining the infection prevalence of host\u2010seeking nymphs in nature, and consequently, in the risk of infection for humans.",

In a large European Union project, EDEN (Emerging Diseases in a Changing European Environment, 2011), rodent\u2010borne (robo) viral infections have been studied, along with tick\u2010borne pathogens, leishmaniasis, West Nile Virus, malaria and Rift Valley Fever. The most important aim of Professor Henttonen and his colleagues was to clarify the differences in boreal (northern) and temperate Europe in the human epidemiology of nephropathia epidemica, by far the most common hantaviral disease in Europe, caused by Puumala hantavirus (PUUV). The population dynamics of the host species, the bank vole, differ greatly in various parts of Europe, driven by predation in the north and masting events in the temperate zone. Consequently, the causes of rodent fluctuations are different. In addition, the role of landscape patterns (homogenous Taiga vs. fragmented temperate forests) in rodent/virus dispersal is significant, as well as local environmental conditions (e.g. temperature and moisture), which affect virus survival outside the host. For example, in room temperature, PUUV remains infectious for at least 2 weeks outside the host, and possibly for much longer in cold temperatures and in moist conditions. These research findings are essential for human risk evaluation with regard to both long\u2010term and seasonal occurrence of PUUV in the environment. In spite of chronic infection of bank voles and the excretion of PUUV in their faeces, urine and saliva, the shedding period is limited, which has significant implications for seasonal transmission dynamics in rodents. Thus, within the same host/virus system, biome\u2010specific PUUV epidemiologies occur (Kallio et al., 2009; Tersago et al., 2009), thereby highlighting the need for geographically comparative studies in Europe (METLA, 2012).",

He emphasized that modern day virologists and immunologists must do better in their search to understand how a virus kills and how effective vaccines can be developed, especially because traditional virology has yielded surprisingly little information about why some virus strains cause severe diseases while others remain innocuous. He pointed out that the case fatality rate for the 1918 influenza pandemic was about 2.5% and that particular H1N1 virus may have infected as much as one\u2010third of the world\u2019s population. Issues arise not only in understanding a virus, but also in understanding how hosts respond. For example, the 1918 virus infection resulted in very high expression of inflammatory, antiviral and immune cell genes very early in host infection (Kash et al., 2006).",

Such research begins with either in vitro studies of virus replication on cell lines or primary cell cultures, moving to nonhuman primate models of virus infection. Then samples from the experiments are investigated at multiple time points and conditions; and high throughput data are then examined by data processing to prepare systematic evaluations of different host responses. Data integration involving data analysis and modelling of key genes and pathways is then possible, followed by iterative processing of host perturbations and the use of viral mutants to discover specific applications to translational research. Such a systems biology approach requires not only continuing experiments with virus\u2010infected experimental systems but also significant efforts to maintain the hardware and software of an extensive laboratory computational infrastructure. It is this computing infrastructure, which permits the laboratory to go quickly from samples to pathway visualization, as the data analysis workflow moves from microarray images to gene expression data to pathway models.",

The three key characteristics of this integrated approach to so many infectious diseases are as follows: (i) to use cell culture, primary cells, nonhuman primate and human clinical models to study viral infection; (ii) to combine traditional histopathological, virological and biochemical approaches with functional genomics, proteomics and computational biology (Haagmans et al., 2009); and (iii) to obtain signatures of virulence and insights into mechanisms of host defense response, viral evasion and pathogenesis (Casadevaill et al., 2011). For example, with the study of all respiratory viral diseases, a unifying hypothesis is that highly pathogenic respiratory viruses use both unique and common strategies to remodel the host cell to enhance virus replication, regulate disease severity and promote virus transmission (Chang et al., 2011).",

Since mid\u20102005, it has programmed approximately $500 million to build capacities in more than 50 countries for monitoring the spread of HPAI among wild bird populations, domestic poultry, and humans, and to mount a rapid and effective containment of the virus when it is found. Recent analyses indicate that these efforts have contributed to significant downturns in reported poultry outbreaks and human infections and a dramatic reduction in the number of countries affected. Furthermore, the USAID Bureau for Global Health, Office of Health, Infectious Disease and Nutrition (GH/HIDN) recently funded two cooperative agreements, PREDICT and RESPOND, under its Avian and Pandemic Influenza and Zoonotic Disease Program to continue and expand this work. The goal of PREDICT is to establish a global early warning system for zoonotic disease emergence that is capable of detecting, tracking and predicting the emergence of new infectious diseases in high\u2010risk wildlife (e.g. bats, rodents and non\u2010human primates) that could pose a major threat to human health. The goal of RESPOND is to improve the capacity of countries in high\u2010risk areas to respond to outbreaks of emergent zoonotic diseases that pose a serious threat to human health.

There are some 1000 different bat species; and they often roost in high\u2010density colonies of over one million flying mammals, which have, in a very real sense, been travelling for millions of years, exposing themselves to many pathogens; therefore, the resulting complexity is not surprising. Key research questions include (i) Why do bats seem to be able to co\u2010exist with a great diversity of viruses without showing disease signs? (ii) What triggers the spillover of bat viruses into other animals? (iii) Do bats control viral infection differently from other mammals?",

The very similar genome organization supported the hypothesis of a shared ancient ancestor. Interestingly, both CAdVs are presenting untypical pathological features within the family Adenoviridae.

Today bats had become a primary species encountered by humans in terms of potential exposure to significant disease agents. Their research was tackling three important unanswered questions: (i) what is the prevalence and diversity of bat CoVs in New World bats?

Of the 1,002 faecal or anal swab samples, 75, that is, 7%, were positive for CoV RNA. The highest prevalence of the virus was in juvenile bats; although rates of prevalence varied from year to year, late spring was the time when the virus peaked. Although bat CoVs persisted within bat populations and their roosts, individually tagged CoV\u2010infected bats cleared their infections within 6 weeks without apparent illness. New world bats of the same species in geographically distinct locations and over the course of several years harbour similar CoVs, and some New World bat CoVs may be able to infect bats of different genera. Strikingly, bats, which had known or potential contact with humans, had a high prevalence of 10\u201320% of CoV infection.

The recent emergence of SARS coronaviruses from civets, bats and/or other reservoir species into humans depended upon a few amino acid substitutions in the receptor\u2010binding domain (RBD) of S from the animal viruses that allowed them to recognize human ACE2 instead of, or in addition to, receptors of their natural hosts (Li, 2008).",

There is now considerable evidence that HA mutations altering receptor specificity and cell tropism of the 2009 pandemic influenza A virus (H1N1v) are linked to the D222G amino acid substitution and are associated with a particularly severe outcome of infection (Liu et al., 2010). It should be remembered that the viral polymerase has to enter the nucleus of the infected cell to promote replication and transcription of the viral genome. Adaptive mutations in polymerase subunits of avian viruses improve binding to importin alpha, a component of the nuclear pore complex in mammalian cells. As a result, nuclear transport of these proteins and efficiency of replication are enhanced.

While humans can serve as host species for all three viruses, Influenza A can also be present in other mammals and avian species, Influenza B in seals and Influenza C in pigs. The severity of the disease is relatively high with Influenza A, moderate with Influenza B and low with Influenza C, with the prevalence in humans high with both Influenza A and B viruses, but lower with Influenza C. Furthermore, a clear distinction needs to be made between seasonal influenza, avian influenza and pandemic influenza. There are two different mechanisms of host adaptation \u2013 sequential mutations and genome reassortment. Most recently, the new H1N1 swine flu pandemic outbreak of 2009 drew attention to the speed with which an influenza virus could move around the world. However, the fact that this particular virus was not as virulent as first anticipated proved crucial in confronting the virus, even though it spreads rapidly among humans, unlike the much more virulent H5N1 avian flu virus, from which more than 300 people have died from more than 500 verified cases from 2003 to 2011 (World Health Organization (WHO), 2012).",

The likelihood of a major pandemic linked to H5N1 has not decreased in the last 5 years, even though publicity has certainly decreased. Furthermore, Professor Osterhaus pointed out that the recent H1N1 pandemic influenza outbreak indicated that the scientific community was wrong in its earlier belief that \u2018a pandemic strain could only arise from a subtype that had not previously been widely disseminated in humans [because] the H1N1 virus has shown that human varieties characterized by different hemagglutinin (HA) molecules may follow separate lines of evolution and may generate potentially pandemic strains within an existing human HA subtype.

Within each pair, the wild\u2010type and oseltamivir\u2010resistant virus caused disease of equal severity in ferrets and replicated to comparable virus titers in the upper respiratory tract. Then, to assess the fitness of drug\u2010resistant H5N1 influenza viruses, the research team considered virus\u2013virus interactions within the host by co\u2010inoculating ferrets with mixtures of the oseltamivir\u2010sensitive and oseltamivir\u2010resistant H5N1 viruses in varying ratios (e.g. 100/0; 80/20; 50/50; 20/80; 0/100).

Their consideration of The Mixing Vessel Pendulum began by explaining the three elements of how swine could be considered as a mixing vessel for influenza A viruses as formally proposed by Scholtissek et al. (1985): (i) swine are susceptible to infection with influenza A viruses from avian and human viruses; (ii) the avian viruses can adapt within the pig, producing novel reassortants; and (iii) these reassortants can then be shed and are infectious to man. The goal of this presentation was to test the first part of the mixing vessel hypothesis, concerned with the susceptibility of swine to avian and human influenza viruses, making use of both mixing vessel studies in pigs and genetic markers to investigate adaptation.",

Moreover, the emergence of the 2009 pandemic H1N1 virus has re\u2010emphasised swine as a potential source of pandemic virus. In this study, all of the challenge viruses (avian H5, H7, H9) induced a similar effect in pigs; challenge viruses did replicate in pigs; the infections were subclinical with mild pneumonias; most infections resulted in seroconversion; and none of them transmitted to contact controls. This series of studies suggests pigs could be easily infected with avian viruses; however, an adaptation step is needed to generate fit viruses that transmit among swine. Parallel studies are currently underway testing the susceptibility of pigs to human seasonal influenza viruses. Future studies using reverse genetics could investigate potential genetic markers for adaptation of avian viruses to swine which may provide insight into the interspecies transmission of influenza viruses.",

Swine exhibited an elevated transcriptional response that tapered by resolution of influenza. Mice exhibited a decrease in many acute phase and immune response genes quickly followed by a steady increase in expression. Host response in macaques was most pronounced and maintained over time. In considering the transcription of immune\u2010related genes in swine, mice and nonhuman primates, they found that although the number of immune\u2010related genes changing in each species was similar, the precise genes changing were very different, with only 14 immune response genes commonly differentially expressed across all three species.

They noticed that while in Huh7, CCHFV infection elicited at day 3 a cytopathogenic effect, no visible effect was seen in CCHFV\u2010infected HepG2. This intriguing feature led them to analyse the viral parameters expecting a differential cellular response. Both cell lines were shown to be permissive to CCHFV and with a high viral yield as monitored by plaque titration assay, genomic and anti\u2010genomic strand quantification. These CCHFV\u2010infected hepatocarcinoma cell lines induced only IL\u20108 secretion. In addition, a pro\u2010apoptotic effect was observed in Huh7 but not in HepG2. Interestingly, no type\u2010I IFN was detected for Hep\u2010G2 during the kinetic study, suggesting a strong inhibition of IFN secretion. They concluded that CCHFV does enter and replicate in hepatocytes and that hepatocytes could be involved in CCHF pathogenesis associated with antigen presenting cells for CCHFV dissemination. While CCHFV did not induce IFN\u2010Beta secretion in hepatocyte cell lines, CCHFV did induce the secretion of IL\u20101 in hepatocyte cell lines. Furthermore, CCHFV induced a higher secretion of IL\u20108 in the apoptotic Huh 7 cell line than in the nonapoptotic Hep\u2010G2 cell line.

According to the Canadian Biosafety Guidelines 4th edition, an organism may be removed from containment once it has been rendered inert, but no procedure is in place to validate these biosafety guidelines, and it is up to the individuals to implement the relevant guidelines (Public Health Agency of Canada, 2004, p. 28. Chap. 3.1.4). Methods such as gamma irradiation, formalin fixation, acetone and methanol permeation, plus the use of various other chemical agents, are common practices to preserve cellular tissue or blood components and to inactivate organisms (Elliott et al., 1982; Mitchell and McCormick, 1984; Preuss et al., 1997; Villinger et al., 1999; Sanchez et al., 2007).

Their focus was on how the EBOV\u2010glycoprotein (EBOV\u2010GP) facilitated viral entry and promoted viral release from human cells. They compared EBOV\u2010GP interactions with human cells and cells from African fruit bats, leading to the finding that GP displayed similar biological properties in human and bat cells. The only exception was GP localization, which was to a greater extent intracellular in bat cells as compared to human cells. Collectively their results suggested that GP interactions with fruit bat and human cells are similar and do not limit EBOV tropism for certain bat species.",

C. jejuni is one of the most common causes of bacterial gastroenteritis worldwide, causing some 400\u2013500 million cases each year. Opening his presentation, The Foodborne Pathogen Campylobacter jejuni Exploits Mammalian Host Cell Receptors and Signaling Pathways, Professor Konkel noted that the per cent of C. jejuni isolates that are resistant to antibiotics is continuing to increase and that C. jejuni infections are frequently associated with serious sequelae, including Guillain\u2010Barr\u00e9 Syndrome. It is well understood that infection with C. jejuni is often a consequence of eating foods contaminated with undercooked poultry. However, C. jejuni pathogenesis is a highly complex process that is dependent on many factors including motility, adherence, cell invasion, protein secretion, intracellular survival and toxin production. Acute illness, characterized by the presence of blood and leucocytes in stool samples, is specifically associated with C. jejuni invasion of intestinal epithelial cells. Dissecting bacteria\u2013host cell interactions are critical to understanding the infection caused by C. jejuni.",

To test the hypothesis that maximal cell invasion requires specific signalling events, binding and internalization assays were performed in the presence of numerous inhibitors of cell signaling pathways. The research team found that C. jejuni cell invasion utilizes components of Focal Complexes (FCs), as invasion is significantly inhibited by wortmannin (an inhibitor of PI\u20103 kinase) and PP2 (a c\u2010Src inhibitor). They further demonstrated that a wild\u2010type strain of C. jejuni results in the activation of the Rho GTPase Rac1. These observations are consistent with the proposal that C. jejuni binding to host cell\u2010associated Fn and secretion of the Cia proteins trigger integrin receptor activation, which in turn promotes intracellular signalling and actin cytoskeletal rearrangement. On the basis of these data, they concluded that C. jejuni utilizes a novel mechanism to promote host cell invasion.

Importantly, Mycoplasma species are difficult to culture or are un\u2010culturable, and thus are difficult to impossible to detect by conventional diagnostic methods. Moreover, current PCR methods have limited breath of species detection and differentiation, requiring the use of species\u2010specific assays that are costly and time\u2010consuming.

Listeria monocytogenes, a non\u2010sporulating, gram\u2010positive bacillus, is found chiefly in ruminants, but can affect all species and causes listeriosis, an infrequent but serious illness that affects the central nervous system of humans and domestic animals (Bortolussi, 2008; Chan and Weidmann, 2009). Listeriosis can be acquired from the consumption of contaminated foods and has an incubation period ranging from 2 to 70 days (Bortolussi, 2008; Chan and Weidmann, 2009). Because of this variable incubation period and the fact that listeriosis leads to a mortality rate of 20\u201330%, the Applied Biosafety Research Program at the National Microbiology Laboratory of The Public Health Agency of Canada considered the significance of proper decontamination of listeria in food processing environments (Chan and Weidmann, 2009).

BSE prions were found in the sympathetic nervous system starting from 16 months post\u2010inoculation (mpi) on as well as in the parasympathetic nervous system from 20 mpi on (Kaatz et al., 2012). A clear dissociation of prion infectivity and detectable PrPSc deposition was obvious in tongue (Balkema\u2010Buschmann et al., 2011). The earliest presence of infectivity in the brainstem was detected at 24 mpi, while PrPSc\u2010accumulation was detected first after 28 mpi. In summary, these results deciphered for the first time the centripetal spread of BSE prions along the ANS to the CNS starting already half way during the incubation period. BSE prions spread in cattle from the gut to the brain along the sympathetic, parasympathetic and spinal cord routes, possibly in that order of importance. Spinal cord involvement may even not be necessary at all, but BSE infectivity in the form of PrPSc spills over into the periphery already in the pre\u2010clinical phase.",

Of the five papers relevant to this topic, two have been published in full below in this Special Supplement. Dr. G.

Their mathematical model of the Mycobacterium bovis infection within and between species takes into account the transmission of M. bovis through infected offal \u2013 the viscera of animals killed by hunters and left behind. When an animal was hunted in the Brotonne Forest in Normandy prior to 2002, it was eviscerated in situ and only the carcass taken away, with the raw viscera left behind. Since 2002, offal disposal has been required in Brotonne forest; however, the regulation has not always been observed by hunters (unpublished correspondence with G. Zanella, 16\u201317 December, 2011) An important benefit of mathematical modelling is that it permits consideration of all the elements involved in disease transmission within a population, thereby complementing field data, as well as testing the effects of control measures. Thus, the direct transmission of the M. bovis infection within the red deer and wild boar populations can be distinguished from indirect transmission through contaminated offal. The model indicates that offal destruction is the key factor in infection control for both red deer and wild boar. The authors conclude that, in principle, the structure of this model is relevant to the situations where dead animals play an important role in disease transmission between two or more species.",

Gonz\u00e1lez\u2010Salazar and Professor C. Stephens set out the role of ecological networks as a powerful tool for understanding and visualizing inter\u2010species ecological and evolutionary interactions. Taking the example of leishmaniasis in Mexico, they show that such networks can be used not only to understand potential ecological interactions between species involved in the transmission of the disease, but also to identify the potential role of the environment in disease transmission and dispersal. Strikingly, they show how potential interactions can be inferred from geographical data, rather than by direct observation. Their findings have led to the prediction of additional reservoirs in Mexico of many new species, including bats and squirrels. The resulting model can be used to understand and map potential transmission risk, as well as construct risk scenarios for the dispersal of leishmaniasis from one geographical region to another. Such a risk assessment tool for leishmaniasis will be especially useful in the light of the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation decision in January 2012 to join with 13 major pharmaceutical companies and the World Health Organization in targeting leishmaniasis as one of the neglected tropical diseases to receive improved drugs, diagnostics, vector control strategies and vaccines (Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, 2012; Boseley, 2012). However, the possibility of new reservoirs suggests it is hard to imagine that leishmaniasis can be completely eradicated. Nevertheless, it is increasingly clear that leishmaniasis has a disturbing capacity to jump from species to species, so efforts to control the disease must be given a high priority (Unpublished correspondence with C. Stephens, February 1, 2012; cf. Flanagan et al., 2011).",

Hence, epidemiologists must perform observational studies of people most likely to be infected with SIV and by looking at possible risk factor associations, infer causality. One must first determine settings where the prevalence of SIV in expected to be high and then study those workers. For example, SIVs are often endemic in large\u2010scale modern production facilities. Risk factors for sow\u2010herd SIV seropositivity involve pig density, whether there is an external source of breeding pigs, the total animals on the site and the closeness of barns.

However, SIV surveillance in pigs is largely passive and voluntary, so recognizing which pig workers to study is a challenge. Detection of SIV infections in man often requires a sentinel event (e.g. human illness with pig exposure or sick pigs). As pigs do not always have clinical signs of novel virus infection and often there is no compensation system to protect pig farmers, the pork industry is reluctant to permit the study of their workers for SIV infection (Gray and Baker, 2011).

Outbreaks of Rift Valley Fever are known to follow periods of widespread and heavy rainfall associated with the development of a strong inter\u2010tropical convergence zone over Eastern Africa (Davies et al., 1985). During periods of elevated transmission, there is a significantly increased risk of globalization of these and other arboviruses; however, the forecasting methods described provide 2.5\u20135 months early warning before an outbreak and provide ample time for disease mitigation before the first cases appear (Anyamba et al., 2010).",

Guillossou and his colleagues Professors H. M. Scott and J. A.

Dr. Guillossou pointed out that there were more than 15 different methods for determining a 95% confidence interval of a proportion. He stressed that it is always important to report the method of statistical analysis being utilized. In his view, the Agresti\u2010Coull interval approach presents a satisfactory compromise between computational requirements and coverage probability (Newcombe, 1998; Brown et al., 2001). Ideally, the effects of coverage probability should be estimated and the most appropriate method chosen before reporting the findings or using proportions as inputs in any epidemiological study.",

Even the recent relatively mild swine flu virus infected 10% of the human population and killed some 100,000 people globally \u2013 far less than would have been the case if the virus had mutated to a more deadly form, as might easily have happened. The reality is, as Professor Nathan Wolfe, Professor in Human Biology at Stanford University, has commented: \u2018As a species, we\u2019re not that focused on the things that have the most potential to be devastating to us as a global population, such as viruses. Unless people take these things seriously, we\u2019re going to look back and say we had all the tools necessary to try to address these risks, and we basically ignored them because they weren\u2019t dramatic like a car accident or a hurricane\u2019 (Geddes, 2011; Kahn, 2011; Wolfe, 2011).
