Indeed, such studies were carried out even before RVs were identified as causative agents of the common cold. In 1914 almost 40 years prior to identification of RV, Kruse induced colds in volunteers by inoculating them with a filtrate of nasal washings.1 Following the identification of RVs, viral challenge studies were used extensively in healthy volunteers to study numerous aspects of RV biology including viral infectivity, modes of transmission, role of environmental factors, host immune responses, and the effects of treatments. In the 1990s these studies were extended to subjects with asthma to study the pathogenesis of RV-induced asthma exacerbations, and over the last decade experimental RV infection has also been carried out in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). These studies have provided unique insights into the pathogenesis of RV infection that would have been difficult to obtain using studies of naturally acquired infections or in animal models.",

            "text": "Viral respiratory tract infections are the commonest infectious syndrome in humans with adults experiencing two to four infections per annum. Given the frequency of viral infections it is pertinent to ask why studies that deliberately expose humans to an infectious agent are required, when there are more than enough naturally acquired infections to yield sufficient subjects for studies. Despite the ubiquity of viral colds there are a number of factors that make studies of naturally acquired infections problematic. Although RVs are the commonest etiological agents of viral colds there are several other viral causes (and nonviral causes of upper airway symptoms), and the clinical syndromes caused by different virus types are indistinguishable.2., 3. Other factors contributing to variability in naturally acquired infections include different routes of inoculation (eye, nasopharynx, direct contact, aerosol, etc.), different inoculation doses, variability in the perception of symptoms leading to differences in time to presentation and host factors (immune status, smoking, age, etc.) that influence viral pathogenicity. Further, the heterogeneous nature of naturally occurring infections requires that large patient numbers are needed to identify statistically significant effects of treatment. Therefore human experimental infection studies are an attractive proposition as they allow for a known etiological agent to be administered at a standard dose, route of inoculation, and time point to a selected group of recipients with similar characteristics (e.g., age, smoking history, health/disease, and antibody status). Detailed follow up can be carried out in a controlled clinical setting with sample collection at defined time points in relation to the time of infection. As the clinical syndrome induced by RV challenge in young healthy volunteers is benign and self-limiting, experimental RV infection in this group is relatively uncontroversial. Perhaps the only risk to subjects was the possibility of additional infectious agents present in the inoculum and good manufacturing practice (GMP)-prepared stocks are now required by regulators for experimental infection studies in humans to contravene this risk.4 Studies in healthy volunteers have been central to establishing the key aspects of the biology of RV infection including routes of acquisition of infection,5., 6., 7., 8. clinical symptoms,8., 9. inflammatory and immune responses,10 involvement of the lower airway,10., 11. and correlates of immune protection of RV infection.12\n",

Licensing approval was sought for an antiviral drug, pleconaril, for the treatment of RV infection.21 Approval was denied by the Food and Drug Administration as the adverse effects outweighed the benefits in healthy subjects with self-limiting colds. The lack of approval of any antiviral treatments casts doubt on whether continued investment in viral challenge studies is justified. However, the recognition that RV infection is associated with more severe clinical manifestations in people with chronic lung diseases such as asthma and COPD provided a new impetus to research and a new direction to human experimental infection studies.",

There were occasional reports of RV infection associated with more severe clinical illness such as pneumonia52 but both scientific and pharmacological research tended to be focused on other respiratory viruses such as influenza and respiratory syncytial virus, as these were considered to be more serious human pathogens. Colds had long been associated with asthma exacerbations but early studies investigating virus infection in asthma and COPD exacerbations reported low detection rates.53., 54., 55. The consensus was that asthma exacerbations were predominantly triggered by allergen exposure and COPD exacerbations by acute bacterial infection. The development of highly sensitive and specific molecular diagnostic techniques using polymerase chain reaction (PCR) technology led to a revolution in viral diagnostics and a reevaluation of the role of respiratory viruses in a range of clinical syndromes. This was particularly pertinent to human RVs, which are either difficult or impossible to culture (e.g., RV-C strains) and due to the large number of serotypes diagnostic serology testing is not feasible. PCR-based diagnostic tests have a much greater sensitivity for the detection of RVs and studies using PCR revealed that the range of clinical illness associated with RV infection was much broader than previously recognized and included more severe disease syndromes such as pneumonia,56 bronchiolitis,57 acute rhinosinusitis,58 and influenza-like illness.59 In addition RVs could be detected in most asthma exacerbations,60 and in a substantial proportion of COPD exacerbations.61 Asthma is estimated to affect 360 million people worldwide and COPD affects 174.5 million people and was the cause of 3.2 million deaths in 2015.62 Much of the enormous morbidity, mortality, and healthcare costs associated with asthma and COPD are related to acute exacerbations. Therefore the recognition that RVs are a major cause of asthma and COPD exacerbations stimulated new interest in their biology and treatment. As part of this research investigators considered whether experimental infection studies in humans could be extended from healthy volunteers to patients with asthma and COPD.",

The recognition of the role of RVs in asthma exacerbations stimulated research into their biology in an attempt to develop treatments for virus-induced exacerbations. This research included investigating whether experimental RV infection could be used in people with asthma in the same way it had been used in healthy individuals. The first experimental RV challenge of subjects with asthma was carried out in 1985 at Dalhousie University, Canada. Of the 21 volunteers inoculated, 19 became infected but only 4 had \u226510% decrease in forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV1) and an increase in airway hyperreactivity (AHR). The authors felt that these findings suggested \u201cthat other viral pathogens may play a more important role in precipitating asthma attacks.\u201d66 It is unclear why this study failed to induce features of asthma exacerbations but it would be almost another decade before further experimental RV infection studies in people with asthma were attempted. Experimental infection studies in allergic (nonasthmatic) subjects suggested that RV infection could induce changes in lower airway physiology similar to that seen in asthma.67., 68. In 1994 an experimental infection study from the University of Southampton, United Kingdom included a small group of people with allergic asthma and reported that upper respiratory symptoms were more severe in atopic subjects but did not report on lower airway symptoms or physiology.69 Concurrently a study using PCR to detect viruses in naturally acquired asthma exacerbations strongly supported a role for RV.60 Subsequent studies were carried out by research groups in the United Kingdom,70 the Netherlands,71., 72., 73., 74. and the United States75., 76. in volunteers with mild, intermittent asthma. These studies demonstrated that RV infection induced airway obstruction,77., 78. increased AHR,70., 71., 72., 73., 79. and airway inflammation70., 72., 79., 80., 81., 82., 83., 84. and RV could be detected in the lower airways,75., 85. thereby supporting a causative role for RVs in asthma exacerbations.",

A study of naturally acquired infections in cohabiting couples discordant for asthma suggested that people with asthma were not more susceptible to virus infection but had more lower respiratory tract symptoms.86 Airway inflammation during naturally acquired infections was greater in people with asthma compared with those without asthma but the number of subjects in this study was small and the viruses detected were different between the two groups.87 Viral challenge studies are ideally suited to addressing this research question as people without asthma matched for characteristics such as age and gender can be infected simultaneously. Most of the earlier infection studies did not include a control group of healthy volunteers and therefore could not address the question as to whether host responses to infection differ in people with asthma. Studies that did include nonasthmatic controls produced somewhat inconsistent results with one study reporting no differences in lower airway inflammatory cells,70 another reporting increased nasal inflammatory mediators in asthma88 and discrepant results regarding virus-induced respiratory symptoms.88., 89. These divergent results were likely related to differences in sampling methods and timing, antibody status of subjects, and choice of healthy controls (e.g., atopic vs nonatopic).",

            "text": "The first study to show clear differences between subjects with and without asthma in their responses to RV infection was published in 2008.90 In this study, RV challenge induced more respiratory symptoms, greater lung function impairment, increased bronchial hyperreactivity, and eosinophilic and neutrophilic lower airway inflammation in asthmatic compared with normal subjects with direct correlations between loss of lung function and the degree of neutrophilic, eosinophilic inflammation, and nasal viral load.90 In addition, the study provided insights into potential mechanisms of differential responses to viral infection in people with asthma. Despite being infected with the same dose of virus, postinoculation virus loads tended to be higher in the asthmatic subjects compared with the healthy controls, suggesting that antiviral immunity may be impaired in people with asthma with subsequent failure to control viral replication. Virologic and clinical outcomes were related to deficient interferon (IFN)-\u03b3 and interleukin (IL)-10 responses and to augmented T-helper type 2 (TH2) responses (IL-4, IL-5, and IL-13), indicating that excessive TH2 or impaired TH1 (or IL-10) immunity may be important mechanisms. When infected with RV in vitro, alveolar macrophages and bronchial epithelial cells from subjects with asthma demonstrated deficient production of IFN\u03b2 and IFN\u03bb, and this was related to the severity of virus-induced asthma exacerbations.91 Other reports subsequently confirmed that IFN production is deficient in asthma,92., 93. but this finding has not been replicated in all studies.94., 95., 96. It may be that this phenomenon only occurs in a subset of people with asthma, or that it is seen in more severe or poorly controlled asthma. Such patients were not initially included in challenge studies as these were limited to mild, well-controlled asthma not requiring inhaled corticosteroids. In 2014 RV challenge was shown to be safe in a small group of people with well-controlled asthma requiring long-term use of inhaled corticosteroids.97 A larger study confirmed this and reported significantly more upper and lower respiratory symptoms, greater reduction in peak expiratory flow and FEV1, increased viral loads, increased bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) eosinophils, and increased nasal IL-4, IL-5, and IL-13 in subjects with moderate asthma using inhaled corticosteroids.98 This study also identified novel mediators of virus-induced asthma exacerbations including IL-33,98 IL-25,99 and IL-18.100 Poor asthma control was associated with more severe virus-induced exacerbations, greater TH2 inflammation and higher virus load.101 Therefore responses to virus infection may differ depending on asthma severity and control, which may account for some of the discrepant results in earlier experimental infection studies. These successful viral challenge studies should pave the way for further studies in subjects with moderate asthma that should reveal new insights into the pathogenesis of exacerbations that may not have been obtained from studies in mild asthma.",

Although COPD exacerbations are preceded by upper respiratory symptoms in up to two-thirds of cases, virus detection rates in the pre-PCR era were low.53., 107. As with asthma, the role of viruses in COPD exacerbations was reexamined using PCR-based detection methods. Although detection rates of respiratory viruses in COPD exacerbations are more variable than in asthma, respiratory viruses can be detected in 50%\u201364% of COPD exacerbations, with RVs the predominant virus type detected.108., 109., 110., 111. Despite this emerging evidence implicating respiratory viruses in a significant proportion of COPD exacerbations, both scientific and clinical research continued to focus on bacterial infection. As evidence of this, it was almost two decades after the first experimental RV infection study was carried out in asthma that a similar study in COPD was attempted. Despite the excellent safety record of experimental infection studies in asthma, caution was warranted in repeating these studies in COPD as there are major differences between these two populations. COPD patients are older, current or ex-smokers, and have impaired lung function with irreversible airflow obstruction. All these factors have the potential to result in a more severe response to experimental RV challenge, compared with the younger, nonsmoking patients with relatively normal baseline lung function recruited to the asthma infection studies.",

All the subjects recovered completely without treatment and no adverse events were reported. Subsequently the same research group carried out two larger studies of experimental RV infection in subjects with COPD and non-COPD control subjects.113., 114. These studies replicated the findings of the pilot study, wherein RV infection manifested in cold symptoms, lower respiratory symptoms consistent with exacerbations of COPD, including airway inflammation and worsened airflow obstruction.113., 114. These studies provided important causal evidence linking virus infection to COPD exacerbations. Studies from naturally acquired infection were supportive of this link but do not provide definitive evidence as PCR evaluation detects viral nucleic acid and therefore does not prove the presence of live virus and samples are only collected after exacerbation onset. Respiratory virus nucleic acid can also be detected in COPD patients with stable disease, although is usually elevated during COPD exacerbations.115 In experimental infection models, RV was present in airway samples prior to exacerbation onset, virus load increased in parallel with the increase in symptoms, airflow obstruction and inflammation, and clearance of virus was associated with exacerbation resolution.113., 114. Strong correlations were observed between virus load and airway neutrophil numbers, neutrophil elastase, IL-8, IL-6, and tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF\u03b1), granulocyte macrophage colony stimulating factor, most of which of also correlated with levels of epigenetic regulator, histone deacetylase 2 and these inflammatory responses were greater in patients with COPD. In these studies, RV infection is the sole experimental agent responsible for increased inflammatory markers in patients with COPD, providing strong evidence that RV infection directly causes exacerbations in COPD patients.",

Further studies including larger numbers of patients are needed to validate these findings and further investigate the mechanisms of virus-induced exacerbations in COPD.",

Key roles for neutrophils and the neutrophil chemokine receptor CXCR2 in mediating RV-induced pathology were identified. Inoculation of CXCR2\u2212/\u2212 mice with RV-A1 (4.5\u00d7106 TCID50) resulted in reduced airway neutrophil numbers, reduced inflammatory cytokine production (TNF\u03b1, MIP-2, KC), decreased mucus production, and decreased cholinergic responsiveness, with no alteration in viral load, compared with wild-type control animals.157 Further, antibody depletion of neutrophils and infection of TNFR\u2212/\u2212 mice also reduced AHR, compared with control animals.157 These findings provide evidence for a role of neutrophilic inflammation, potentially via TNF\u03b1 production, on downstream pathology following RV infection. Roles for pattern recognition molecules have been demonstrated for MDA5, Toll-like receptor 3 (TLR3) and TLR7. Infection of MDA5\u2212/\u2212 mice resulted in delayed type I IFN (IFN\u03b1/\u03b2) and suppressed type III IFN expression, with a slight early increase in viral load in the lung.158 In contrast, inoculation of TLR3\u2212/\u2212 mice resulted in normal IFN responses and no difference in viral yield.158 Both MDA5\u2212/\u2212 and TLR3\u2212/\u2212 mice had reduced neutrophil numbers, inflammatory cytokine production (CXCL1, CXCL2, CCL2, CXCL10) and airways responsiveness, compared with wild-type controls.158 Differing roles for NF\u03baB signaling pathways in RV-induced inflammation and type I INF responses in antiviral immunity have been demonstrated. Disruption of NF\u03baB signaling in p65+/\u2212 mice resulted in reduced neutrophil numbers and inflammatory cytokine production (CXCL1, CXCL5, CXCL2), while IFN production and viral loads are unaltered.159 In contrast, IFNAR1\u2212/\u2212 mice have unaltered neutrophilic inflammation, a persistent increase in lymphocyte numbers and cytokines CCL5, CXCL10, and CXCL11, with reduced IFN\u03b1 production and increased viral load.159 A pathogenic role for the proinflammatory molecule MUC18 has also been demonstrated, with increased expression of antiviral genes (Mx1, IP-10), reduced neutrophil inflammation and viral load in MUC18\u2212/\u2212 mice following RV-A1 inoculation (1\u00d7107\n PFU).160 Studies using Tbet\u2212/\u2212 mice (a key regulator of TH1 cell differentiation) have also demonstrated the key role for TH1-polarized T cells in the response to RV infection. Tbet\u2212/\u2212 mice developed a TH2/TH17-polarized immune response to RV infection (5\u00d7106 TCID50) with increased IL-13 and IL-17A production, deficient NK cell responses, and decreased neutralizing antibody development.161 CD4+ T cells contributed to increased airway eosinophil numbers and mucus production following RV infection in Tbet\u2212/\u2212 mice.161 Studies using TSLP receptor-deficient mice (TSLPR\u2212/\u2212) demonstrated that RV-A1 infection interferes with tolerance to an inhaled allergen, via a mechanism requiring TSLP, IL-33, and activation of OX40L on lung dendritic cells.162\n",

Exposure of epithelial cells in culture to RV-A1 resulted in increased bacterial attachment and translocation through an epithelial monolayer (nontypeable Haemophilus influenzae (NTHi), Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Staphylococcus aureus),154 suggesting a potential mechanism underlying secondary bacterial infections following viral infection. A subsequent study demonstrated that primary inoculation with RV-A1 (5\u00d7106 TCID50) delayed the clearance of NTHi in vivo, associated with suppressed chemokine production (KC, MIP-2) and neutrophilic inflammation through a TLR2-mediated mechanism.164 The model has also been used to assess immune alterations relevant to premature birth and bronchopulmonary dysplasia, risk factors for viral-induced exacerbations. Exposure of neonatal mice to hyperoxia (75% oxygen) in early life increased inflammatory cytokine expression (IL-12, IFN\u03b3, TNF\u03b1, CCL2, CCL3, CCL4) and suppressed early IFN responses following RV-A1 infection (9\u00d7106\n PFU) at 14 days of age.165 One study has also assessed the effect of RV infection timing on subsequent development of AAD. Inoculation of 7-day-old mice with RV-A1 and subsequent induction of house dust mite (HDM)-induced allergic airways disease had additive effects with increased neutrophilia and AHR in female mice, although RV inoculation had no additional impact in male mice.166 These studies extend the use of RV infection in mice to new areas, including mechanisms of early life infection susceptibility, to mechanisms of secondary bacterial infection/compromised antimicrobial immunity and experimental exploration of clinical risk factors associated with increased likelihood to develop virus-induced exacerbations of respiratory diseases.",

Chronic low-dose HDM exposure and RV infection have additive effects on neutrophilia and induce AHR.177 A more recent study demonstrated that RV infection in an HDM-mediated asthma model results in double-stranded DNA release into the airways and administration of genomic DNA alone was sufficient to mimic characteristic components of RV-induced exacerbations.178 Further, blocking neutrophil elastase or degrading NETs by applying DNase into the airways reduced eosinophil and lymphocyte numbers, tissue pathology, and cytokine production (IL-5, IL-13).178\n",

In addition to roles during RV infection alone highlighted above, MDA5 and TLR3 are also involved in RV-induced exacerbations. MDA5\u2212/\u2212 and TLR3\u2212/\u2212 mice have decreased inflammatory responses and AHR, while MDA5\u2212/\u2212 also had decreased IFN responses (IFN\u03b2/\u03bb2/\u03bb3).158 Midline 1 (a E3 ubiquitin ligase) is upregulated in an HDM-induced model, and short interfering RNA\u2013mediated inhibition prior to RV inoculation reduced neutrophil numbers and mucus production production.179 The monocyte chemotactic protein CCL2 is produced by epithelial cells and macrophages following RV-induced exacerbation and administration of an anti-CCL2 antibody reduced eosinophil numbers and AHR.180 Foxa3-overexpressing transgenic mice produce excess mucus in their airways and RV infection increased Foxa3 expression.181 In Foxa3-deficient mice (Foxa3\u2212/\u2212), RV clearance is increased, with increased IFN\u03b2 activation.181 IL-25 expression is also increased in RV-induced exacerbations and blocking the IL-25 receptor reduced type 2 cytokine production (IL-4, IL-5, IL-13, IL-25, IL-33, TSLP), mucus production, and numbers of eosinophils, neutrophils, T cells, and innate lymphoid type 2 cells.99 Combining dsRNA administration with RV-A1 inoculation worsened preexisting allergic airways disease. Repeated dsRNA administration after OVA sensitization/challenge resulted in neutrophilic lung inflammation and tissue pathology and combined dsRNA and RV-A1 inoculation increased expression of TSLP, TNF\u03b1, and IFN\u03bb in the lung.182 Key roles for pattern recognition receptors have also been demonstrated in RV asthma exacerbation models. HDM-allergic TLR7\u2212/\u2212 mice had a decreased antiviral response, with reduced IFN release (IFN\u03b1/\u03b2/\u03bb1/\u03bb2/\u03bb3) and increased virus replication, associated with increased eosinophil and lymphocyte numbers, increased IL-5 and CCL11, and AHR.183 Administration of IFN or transfer of wild-type TLR7-competent pDCs could restore antiviral responses and reduce disease exacerbation.183 OVA-allergic TLR2\u2212/\u2212 mice also had reduced macrophage, neutrophil, and eosinophil numbers and suppressed AHR after RV inoculation.146 Bone marrow transfer experiments demonstrated that TLR2\u2212/\u2212 bone marrow could protect from exacerbations, while transfer of wild-type bone marrow restored responses in TLR2\u2212/\u2212 mice.146 Transfer of wild-type macrophages into TLR2\u2212/\u2212 mice could also restore exacerbations.146 As previously mentioned, a role for TRAIL has also been demonstrated, with HDM-allergic TRAIL-deficient mice (Tnfsf10\n\u2212/\u2212) protected from RV-induced AHR and induction of airway inflammation.163\n",

An approach to block major-group RV virus infection was assessed through administration of antihuman ICAM-1 antibody, which prevented entry of RV-A16 and RV-14 and reduced neutrophil and lymphocyte numbers, cytokine production (IL-4, IL-5, IL-6, CCL1, CCL11), mucus production, and virus load in human transgenic mice in an OVA-allergic model.186 Treatment with a nontoxic anthraquinone derivate reduced RV-induced AHR, neutrophil, and eosinophil airway inflammation; inflammatory cytokine production; and mucus hypersecretion while also boosting type 1 IFN response and reducing viral yields, with associated decreased AKT, HIF-1\u03b1, and VEGF production.187 Treatment with an antiinflammatory VAP-1/SSAO inhibitor, PXS-4728A, or the macrolide antibiotic azithromycin also reduced neutrophil numbers and PXS-4728A reduced AHR following RV-A1 inoculation in HDM-allergic mice.188\n",

Intranasal inoculation of RV-A16 (107\n PFU) into cotton rats induced lower respiratory histopathology, increased mucus production, and induction of INF-activated genes.196 Immunization with live RV-A16-induced high levels of circulating antibodies and protected from subsequent infection, while prophylactic transfer of anti-RV-A16 serum also protected from disease.196 Further, this protection was transferred effectively from mother to newborn, limiting viral yields in subsequently infected progeny.196 In a later study, the same group provided evidence that infection with RV-B14 (106\n PFU) induced similar disease pathology. Furthermore, immunization with RV-B14 provided protection from subsequent infection with either RV-B14 (an RV-B group virus) or RV-A16 (an RV-A group virus), demonstrating some degree of cross-reactivity to very different major-group viruses.197\n",

Due to the decreased efficiency of RV entry into nonhuman epithelial cells (and likely differences in the nuances of cellular machinery required for replication), a high amount of viral load is required to elicit a biological response to RV in laboratory animals (e.g., 106 TCID50 in mouse vs 5\u201310 TCID50 in experimental human infection models). Human RV strains also demonstrate limited viral replication and different replication kinetic between mouse and man. These differences highlight the importance of confirming findings in relevant patient cohorts/samples and the utility of using human experimental models in parallel with animal models. This point is not purely for academic consideration. More so, it is important to take into consideration clinical trial design and outcomes. For example, mouse models highlighted the key relevance of IL-5 in asthma pathology through use of knockout mice209 and antibody blockade.210 However, the initial randomized control trial assessing anti-IL-5 therapy (mepolizumab) in a broad asthma population failed to demonstrate any clinical effect.211 It was not until subsequent trials limited recruitment to patients with demonstrable eosinophilic asthma (a patient subset that is more closely modeled by the experimental mouse system) that clinical improvements were observed.212., 213.\n",
