Under the current coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic situation, most Chinese hospitals are cautious in screening patients for admission. The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is transmitted by not only patients with symptoms but also asymptomatic individuals [2] , which undoubtedly increases the difficulty of preventing and controlling hospital transmission. For patients requiring surgery, especially emergency patients, on the one hand, strict screening can reduce the incidence of nosocomial infection and medical staff infection, on the other hand, tedious screening may delay operation. Thus, finding a balance is the challenge. We offer the following protocol ( Figure 1 ) and recommendations for infection prevention and control in patients awaiting emergency operations.",

We recommend CT and antibody testing as the preferred screening methods, which are faster and more effective than etiological examination. The hospital must establish a control team, which includes experts from the infection department, respiratory department, surgery department, and anesthesiology department. In case of any difficulty in decision-making, one must report to the infection control team (ICT) to confirm results. A negative pressure operating room must be established to meet the operation requirements of suspected or confirmed cases. A negative pressure isolation transfer cabin can be used by staff wearing biosafety level 3 (BSL-3) protective medical equipment to transport patients. BSL-3 protective gear, including N95 masks, goggles, protective suits, face shields, caps, shoe covers, and gloves, is required while performing operations on patients confirmed with COVID-19 or patients suspected with SARS-CoV-2 infection. For the care of patients receiving general anesthesia and endotracheal intubation, the anesthesiologist should use a powered air-purifying respirator [4] . All protective gear should be disposed off properly. The next operation must be performed 2 h after disinfection of the operation theatre (chlorine-containing detergent and ultraviolet irradiation are recommended).",
