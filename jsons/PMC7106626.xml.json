            "text": "Epidemiological studies have shown that cardiac surgery with cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) is a known risk factor for acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) [1\u20135]. Although being a highly sterile type of surgery, cardiac surgery with CPB can lead to a systemic inflammatory response with the activation of multiple inflammatory pathways involving both cellular elements and soluble proteins [6, 7]. The possible causes of the inflammatory response are the exposure of blood to non-physiological surfaces, ischemia\u2013reperfusion injury due to aortic clamping and extracorporeal circulation [8], as well as translocation of endotoxins from gut to the bloodstream [9], which can activate inflammatory cascades similar to those observed in sepsis. Cytokines such as interleukin (IL)-6, IL-8, tumor necrosis factor, C-reactive protein, lipoprotein-binding protein and procalcitonin (PCT) may play an important role in the immune reaction.",

            "text": "PCT is initially described as an early, sensitive and specific marker for sepsis associated with bacterial infection [10]. However, it also increases in clinical situations without infections such as major surgery, burns, or trauma [11]. Previous studies suggested that the concentration of serum PCT increased at the end of CPB, reaching its peak on the first day and then declined rapidly [6, 12]. Previous studies also suggested that significant elevation of PCT level can be observed when complications (including pulmonary complications) presented [6, 13, 14]. However, ARDS was not differentiated from other kinds of pulmonary edema in these studies [6, 13, 14]. It is important to do so because patients undergoing cardiac surgery are at high risk of developing cardiogenic pulmonary edema, which is probably due to cardiac dysfunction or fluid overload, whereas the development of ARDS is predominantly attributed to the systemic inflammatory response. It is still unknown whether high PCT concentration indicates a high risk of developing ARDS. In the present study, our aim was to validate whether patients with higher PCT concentrations have a higher incidence of ARDS.",

Therefore, we were not able to confirm the relationship among CPB, systemic inflammatory response and elevated PCT. Second, we assessed cardiac function by using either echocardiography or pulmonary artery catheter which basically depended on the availability of pulmonary artery catheter\u2014if there was a pulmonary artery catheter in place, we used it; if not, echocardiography was used. In this way we were not able to directly compare cardiac function between cohorts because we had complete data of neither echo nor pulmonary arterial wedge pressure. Instead, we used BNP as an indicator of cardiac function. Third, this study excluded patients with underlying pulmonary diseases who are at risk for ARDS and included only those who underwent elective CBP surgery. Therefore, the conclusion should be extrapolated with caution. Fourth, there was an imbalance in the number of patients between groups: the number of patients in the PCT-elevated cohort was about one-quarter to the number of patients in the control cohort. Finally, the specificity and sensitivity values of PCT predicting ARDS were of low statistical power. Predictions should not be drawn solely from PCT results.",
