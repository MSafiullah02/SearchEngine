We also wanted simultaneous antimicrobial susceptibility testing. Our dreams are now coming true. Multiplex arrays are approved or in development for the diagnosis of respiratory and gastrointestinal infections direct from patient specimens within less than an hour. An array was FDA cleared in August, 2013, that can detect common bacterial and fungal agents of bloodstream infections, as well as several important antibiotic-resistant genes, within about an hour after the culture bottle turns positive. Microbiology lines are available, starting with automated plate streakers and ending with molecular identification of organisms grown on solid media. Humans must still view the culture plates, perhaps on a television screen, and select colonies to analyze.",

The role of specimen processing in concentrating nucleic acid targets and removing inhibitors of amplification is largely neglected, despite its important role in the sensitivity of the assay. Most techniques mentioned here involve RT-PCR, unless otherwise specified. RT-PCR lowers the incidence of amplicon contamination in the laboratory, and has allowed many nucleic acid amplification techniques to come \u201cout of the closet,\u201d but does not prevent specimen contamination.

This represents significant time and money saving, although it does not eliminate the need to grow M tuberculosis for susceptibility testing. If there is only one visible colony and if the probe result is negative, whether due to inadequate sample, improper probe selection, or growth of an organism not recognized by the probe, one must wait for the colony to regrow before further analysis (Fairfax and Salimnia, unpublished data).

More than 100 HPV genotypes exist, of which 13 are associated with a high risk of cervical carcinoma (16, 18, 31, 33, 35, 39, 45, 51, 52, 56, 58, 59, 68).

The presence of high-risk DNA below the detection limit of hc2 appears to be associated with a low risk for malignancy.9 However, new information suggests that infections acquired in the early years of sexual activity may reactivate with aging.11 If this is supported by further studies, more sensitive assays might be indicated.

Rare misses have occurred in mixed infections due to failure to detect very low numbers of Staphylococcus aureus against the background of a much higher number of coagulase-negative Staphylococcus, or similar low numbers of Enterococcus faecalis in a background of other Enterococcus spp. On review of the slides, the previously undetected organism was seen (Salimnia, unpublished results). This no longer occurs as our technologists are alert to this possibility. In a few, rare situations, the PNA-FISH and the MicroScan have disagreed. These discordant results have been resolved in favor of PNA-FISH by 16S rRNA sequencing.16 Depending on how one resolves the results of the mixed cultures described previously, the sensitivity and specificity of PNA-FISH in our laboratory approximate 100%.",

It detects rRNA from Gardnerella vaginalis, used as an indicator for bacterial vaginosis (BV), C albicans, and Trichomonas vaginalis. The sensitivity has been adjusted to avoid giving positive results with low concentrations of G vaginalis and C albicans, which often colonize the normal vagina. It is formatted to be performed in a cassette superficially resembling the lateral flow tests used for the serologic detection of influenza or rotavirus antigens and was the first FDA-approved molecular test based on lateral flow. After collection on a proprietary swab, the specimen is lysed to release the nucleic acids, buffered to stabilize the nucleic acids and establish stringency, and added to the cassette, which is incubated at the proper temperature for nucleic acid hybridization. The cassette contains 5 \u201cbeads,\u201d each coupled to a capture probe: 1 for each of the 3 analytes, plus positive and negative controls. Next, enzyme-linked detector probes bind to specific sequences on the target organism\u2019s rRNA. Unbound sample components and probes are washed away. A colorless substrate is converted to a blue product if sufficient target and detector probe have bound. A blue \u201cbead\u201d indicates a positive result.17\n",

These are both described in detail in the methods article. The TMA assay targets organism-specific rRNA sequences in each organism: 23S rRNA for CT and 16S rRNA for NG. It begins with target capture on magnetic beads, and ends with the hybridization protection assay similar to those previously described for the AccuProbe tests, although each species of detector probe is attached to a different acrydinium ester. One flashes very rapidly and its chemiluminescence attenuates before the other begins to fluoresce (glow). Thus, they can be detected sequentially in the same tube.20\n",

The FRET detector consists of 2 different probes, complementary to adjacent sequences on the target amplicon, and each attached to a different fluor. When activated by incident UV light, the first fluor emits energy at an unmonitored wavelength. If the second probe is bound adjacent to it, the energy is transferred to the second flour, which then emits light at the wavelength monitored by the sensor. At the end of the PCR assay, a melting curve for the amplicon-probe complex can be generated. The melting temperature (Tm) is characteristic of each amplicon-probe combination. If there is a mismatch between the probe and the amplicon, the melting temperature decreases.33 The Tm difference has been exploited in a test that distinguishes between herpes simplex 1 and 2 (Roche). The PCR primers bind sequences common to both viruses within the HSV DNA polymerase gene. The amplicon detector probes match the HSV-2 sequence, which differs from that of HSV-1 by 2 bp. Melting curve analysis reveals a reproducible Tm for HSV-2 that is about 10\u00b0C higher than that exhibited by HSV-1.34 Occasional mutant HSV strains have been detected that have intermediate melting temperatures. These can be reported as positive for HSV, but the type is not clear. Types 1 and 2 could be distinguished by sequencing the amplicons, by using an assay employing a different target sequence, or by the Tm of the amplicon, which is said to be 0.9\u00b0C higher for the HSV-2 variant than the type 1 variant.35\n",

It was developed by EraGen BioSciences, Inc (Madison, WI; acquired by Luminex Corporation [Austin, TX] in 2011). Their Multicode-RTx Herpes simplex virus 1 and 2 kit was FDA approved in 2011. MultiCode RTx assays use 2 unusual nucleotide bases iC (2-deoxy-5-methylisocytidine) and iG (2\u2032-deoxy-isoguanoside) that base pair only to one another and that are efficiently incorporated into PCR products. iG is put at the 5\u2032 end of the RTx primers with a fluor covalently linked nearby. The reaction mix contains iC covalently linked to a quencher. In the initial cycle amplification, the iG, with its attached fluor, appears at the 5\u2032 end of the nascent amplicon strands. When these serve as templates for copying in the other direction, an iC, with its attached quencher is added to the 3\u2032 end of the new strand, opposite the iG and its fluor. The approximation of fluor and quencher decreases the fluorescence. In melting curve analysis, fluorescence increases as the amplicons melt, and the Tm allows determination of the nature of the analyte.36 Although these RT-PCR assays are qualitative, detection is based on the determination of a CT, as with any other standard RT-PCR. Comparison of CTs can be used to provide a rough quantification of the amount of target DNA.37\n",

Theoretically, one can construct a standard curve of copy number versus CT and determine the quantity of analyte in a patient specimen by referring to the curve. However, variations in extraction efficiency and the presence of inhibitors can introduce significant errors, particularly at low levels of analyte, when one is attempting to distinguishing \u201conly a few\u201d from \u201cnone.\u201d One relatively straightforward method to overcome this problem includes the addition of a control target or quantitation standard (QS) into the patient sample before extraction. The target and the QS are extracted, amplified, and detected together, controlling for the extraction and for any inhibitors present. The ideal QS should be the same size and base composition as the target to be quantified, with the same primer binding sites. It should differ enough in sequence that the detector probe or probes for the target do not bind to it, and its own detector probe should fluoresce at a different wavelength from that of the target. Then, quantitation should be a simple mathematical calculation.33 However, at low target concentrations, the standard curve is no longer straight. Roche has incorporated complex mathematical calculations into its recent viral load assays to account for this divergence.",

Time-consuming correlations between viral load and prognosis have to be redone for each new, more sensitive assay. Sequence differences between the numerous organism strains and the inherent mutability of the organisms also make accurate quantification difficult, especially for RNA viruses, such as HIV and HCV. One must target a stable sequence. However, the viral RNA polymerase enzymes are error prone and lack proofreading activity. Changes in the genetic sequence, particularly in the primer or probe-binding sites, may reduce detected viral load. Minority quasi-species also cause problems (see later in this article).

Even at the peak of an influenza epidemic, an individual may be infected with respiratory syncytial virus instead or concurrently. Furthermore, mixed infections are more common than many had imagined.41, 42 Some virus infections are treatable, and others have different isolation requirements if the patient is hospitalized.42 Thus, molecular panels that could detect multiple etiologic agents of diseases clearly are desirable. Four multiplex respiratory panels are FDA approved at this writing: Luminex xTAG RVP (xRVP) and RVP Fast (xRVPF) (Luminex Diagnostics, Toronto, Canada); Film Array Respiratory Panel (FARP; BioFire Diagnostics [formerly Idaho Technologies], Salt Lake City, UT), and eSensor Respiratory Panel (eSRP) (GenMark Diagnostics, Carlsbad, CA).

Newly detected viruses since 2001 include human metapneumoviruses (2001), severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS; 2003), human bocavirus (2005), new influenza A viruses (H1N1, 2009; H7N9, 2013), and now, Middle East respiratory syndrome corona virus (MERS-CoV; 2012), the latter 2 of which apparently have not (yet) appeared in the United States but apparently have a high mortality rate.44, 45, 46 The human metapneumoviruses and human bocavirus are included in some of the previously mentioned assays. It is not clear whether MERS-CoV can be detected by the coronavirus detector systems in these assays, but if so, it could not be distinguished from those that cause more common respiratory infections. Thus, keeping panels updated may prove difficult.",

The PCR product was captured by the capture probes and probed with organism-specific detector probes complementary to species-specific regions of the rRNA molecules. The detector probes are covalently linked to magnetic nanoparticles. The bound magnetic nanoparticles are detected by faster relaxation of their signal in a micronuclear magnetic resonance system. The assay is carried out in a microfluidic chip, requires 2 hours and can be carried out with only 2 \u03bcL of sample.
