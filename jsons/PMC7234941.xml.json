Early results from a nationally representative phone survey in the United States show that over one-third of parents of children under 6 years of age reported delaying health care visits.7 Risks include HIV-positive pregnant women and those in the postnatal period interrupting their supply of antiretroviral medication, placing their infants at risk of vertical transmission of HIV. This has the potential to begin to reverse the enormous progress made by prevention of mother-to-child transmission programs, especially in parts of sub-Saharan Africa where rates of maternal infection remain high. Interruptions to the vaccination schedule in early childhood could have short- and long-term ramifications for children\u2019s health. Furthermore, as has been experienced during the HIV epidemic, illness, hospitalization, separation, and loss of caregivers have immediate harmful effects on young children\u2019s health, nutrition, wellbeing, and learning. These effects can occur even in the absence of infection or symptoms among children.",

It is estimated that the pandemic can lead this year to an additional 42 to 66 million children who live in extreme poverty, and that the economic shocks experienced by families because of the global economic downturn could reverse the last 2 to 3 years of progress in reducing infant mortality.8 Families may lose wages and housing, and have to bear the costs of increased health care and associated food insecurity. Low-income households quickly deplete savings and sell assets to provide better food and treatment for ill household members. As in prior economic crises, widespread loss of employment and increases in poverty drive further migration, displacement, and family separations, which severely affects early childhood nutrition, care and development.9\n",

Parenting and family factors are the critical drivers of children\u2019s early healthy growth and development and are thus primary in determining the immediate severity of pandemic impacts on young children now and in the future. In crisis situations, primary caregivers and parents struggle to keep up with providing health, nutrition, safety and care of children. For those household already living in conditions of adversity and stress, this crisis may have particularly harmful effects. And with many childcare and early education facilities closed worldwide, and interactions with extended families disrupted, children are deprived of both social and cognitive stimulation beyond their homes, in addition to the meals and other resources provided by many ECD programs. Early evidence shows increases in parents reporting mental health difficulties as well as increases in child behavior problems since the onset of the pandemic.7 The challenges may be amplified for parents and family members caring for children with disabilities, or living with disabilities themselves.",

The Ebola crisis had a significant impact on girls, with increases in teen pregnancy, sexual violence and disproportionate school dropout and marginalization.17 In Sierra Leone there was an 11 % increase in the chance of pregnancy for girls 12 \u2013 17 years as a result of the Ebola crisis.18.

The kinds of task shifting, retraining, and targeting of additional resources that have been effective in the response to HIV, malaria and tuberculosis may have lessons for the unique combination of health, nutrition, economic and care consequences of COVID-19. Many low- and middle-income countries face an ongoing HIV epidemic, tuberculosis and multidrug resistant tuberculosis, malaria and child undernutrition. Trained para-professional communityhealth- and support-workers, supervised within the health system in collaboration with faith organizations and civil society, are effective at reaching large numbers of people in their homes and in groups to deliver information, essential health products, support services and referrals.43, 44, 45\n",

Children\u2019s understanding of illness and death evolves throughout childhood.59 Thus, children need coherent explanations that are clear, simple, and concrete, taking into account their age and level of understanding, and accompanied by support and reassurance that they will not have to manage alone (for support on how to communicate about COVID-19 see https://www.psych.ox.ac.uk/research/covid_comms_support).
