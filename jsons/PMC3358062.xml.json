Transmission occurs through respiratory droplets and close contact, which leads to rapid and widespread dissemination. Similar events have been seen in military camps (4), high schools, and day care centers (10). All affected trainees were 20\u201326 years old. Risk factors such as overcrowding, increased physical activities, and psychological stress could possibly increase susceptibility to ARD. These risk factors associated with outbreaks of HAdV-caused ARD, which are prevalent in military and police training centers, have been reported in previous HAdV outbreaks in military recruits (11).",

Among the 27 isolates, the following species were represented: 19 (70%) belonged to HAdV-C, 6 (22%) belonged to HAdV-B, and 2 (7%) belonged to HAdV-F. Among the HAdV-B species isolates, 5 had the HAdV-3 serotype and only 1 had the HAdV-7 serotype. An earlier analysis of HAdV isolates in Malaysia (13) revealed that HAdV-21 was associated with acute flaccid paralysis during the outbreak of hand, foot, and mouth disease in Sarawak, but none of the isolates were HAdV-7.",
