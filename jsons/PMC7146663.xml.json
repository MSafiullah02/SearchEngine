            "text": "\n1.A first point of discussion is that in other countries, including South Korea, a wider sample of the population was tested, whereas in Italy and especially in the north, diagnostic tests were mainly reserved for symptomatic cases seen in the emergency department or symptomatic cases at home with recent contact with a confirmed case. Therefore, the actual number of positive patients could be even 10-fold higher than the estimated number, thus considerably reducing the percentage of fatal cases. However, this assumption cannot be confirmed until extended population testing is done.2.Epidemiological and demographic differences should also be considered. For instance, mortality rates have been higher in the elderly as well as in men than in women. This could be because men are more frequent smokers and have more cardiovascular comorbidities than do women. In both China and South Korea, life expectancy is lower than that in Western countries. In South Korea, most infected patients are young, nonsmoking women, who, generally and in the absence of COVID-19, have a lower overall risk of death. This argument may partially explain the differences between Italy on the one hand and South Korea or China, on the other, but not with the rest of Europe or the United States. An additional hypothesis is that Italian grandparents spend more time with their young grandchildren, the latter possibly representing asymptomatic carriers of the infection. Further epidemiological research is needed with regard to this issue.3.A relevant issue is that the Italian health system, which experienced financial cuts in the past years, was poorly positioned and resourced to deal with the emergency imposed by the COVID-19 crisis. The lack of an appropriate number of intensive care units, managed care organization, and lifesaving devices such as ventilators may have compromised the care of patients. The paucity of personal protective equipment throughout the country caused a spread of the contagion among medical staff and consequently patients.4 Furthermore, the lack of renovation in health care facilities with inappropriate air ducts could have facilitated virus circulation in compromised patients.4.The Chinese \u201cdisaster response plan\u201d allowed the construction of 2 dedicated hospitals in only 10 days, whereas Italy was unprepared to face emergency conditions.5.The Chinese experience emphasized not just the quarantine of asymptomatic and mildly symptomatic cases but also follow-up of possible contacts and of the infectious status so as to attenuate viral spread.\n",

            "text": "Substantial differences occur throughout Italy, with the north of the country, predominantly Lombardy, exhibiting the highest rates of spread and mortality.1.One possible explanation is that the above-mentioned Italian regions represent a central driver of the Italian economy, being the headquarters of several major industries; individuals from other regions and other countries who are involved with such industries may spread the virus elsewhere. Nevertheless, other Italian cities that are overcrowded because of business and tourism, such as Rome, have not experienced the same prevalence and spread of COVID-19. A supposition could be that the northern experience led to severe restrictive measures throughout the country, thereby containing the outbreak.2.Climate conditions may also be relevant to the differences reported among Italian regions. Higher temperature and humidity may block virus diffusion and reduce its persistence in the air and on the objects.6 This explanation has been given to the unequal distribution of the contagion among the continents. In Italy, however, differences in climate among regions are less than what exists between Italy and other parts of the world such as China.3.More recently, there is increasing attention on the possible role of air pollution in virus diffusion. The correlation between the air pollution index and increased fatality was previously hypothesized for the severe acute respiratory syndrome caused by a virus member of the Coronaviridae family; subsequent evidence supported this hypothesis for the severe acute respiratory syndrome. In particular, atmospheric particulate seems to act as a carrier of the virus, facilitating its diffusion and dissemination and allowing its survival in active form for hours and even days. Indeed, air pollution imposes an increased vulnerability of the population to respiratory syndromes, even in the absence of microbial causative agents. A recently published position paper of the Italian Society of Environmental Medicine in collaboration with 2 Italian universities compared COVID-19 case distribution (updated to March 3) and air pollution levels in the past 20 days. Interestingly, northern Italy had both the most polluted area and the highest number of cases of COVID-19, thereby supporting the possibility that the degree of air pollution may contribute to regional differences in cases of COVID-19.7\n\n",
