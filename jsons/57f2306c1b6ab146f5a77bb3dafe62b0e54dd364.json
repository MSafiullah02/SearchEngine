This will preserve the health status and prevent the adverse COVID-19-related outcomes in people affected by different endocrine diseases. People with diabetes in particular are among those in high-risk categories who can have serious illness if they get the virus, according to the data published so far from the Chinese researchers, but other endocrine diseases such as obesity, malnutrition, and adrenal insufficiency may also be impacted by COVID-19. Therefore, since the responsibilities of endocrinologists worldwide due to the current COVID-19 outbreak are not minor we have been appointed by the European Society of Endocrinology (ESE) to write the current statement in order to support the ESE members and the whole endocrine community in this critical situation.",

Chronic hyperglycemia negatively affects immune function and increases the risk of morbidity and mortality due to any infection and is associated to organic complications. This is also the case for COVID-19 infection [1] . During the Influenza A (H1N1) pandemic, the presence of diabetes tripled the risk of hospitalization and quadrupled the risk of ICU admission once hospitalized. Among COVID-19 mortality cases in Wuhan, China, major associated comorbidities included hypertension (53.8%), diabetes (42.3%), previous heart disease (19.2%), and cerebral infarction (15.4%) [2] . In addition, as for seasonal influenza, new data regarding COVID-19 indicate that the infection potentiates myocardial damage and identifies underlying heart disorders as a new risk factor for severe complications and worsening of prognosis [3] .",

However, as for what is currently being the experience in some hospitals in Spain, cases of young people in which severe obesity is present may evolve toward destructive alveolitis with respiratory failure and death (Puig-Domingo M, personal experience). There is no current explanation for this clinical presentation, although it is well known that severe obesity is associated to sleep-apnea syndrome, as well as to surfactant dysfunction, which may contribute to a worse scenario in the case of COVID-19 infection. Also, deterioration of glycemic control is associated with an impairment of ventilatory function and thus may contribute to a worse prognosis in these patients. In addition, type 2 diabetes and obesity may concur in a given patient, which typically is also frequently accompanied by an age >65. In summary, these patients may be at a higher risk of impaired outcomes in the case of COVID-19 infection.",

A nutrient dense diet is recommended in hospitalized cases including high protein supplements (2-3 intakes per day) containing at least 18 g of protein per intake. Adequate supplementation of vitamin D is recommended particularly in areas with large known prevalence of hypovitaminosis D and due to the decreased sun exposure [8, 9] . If nutritional requirements are not met, complementary or complete enteral feeding may be required, and in case that enteral feeding may not be possible due to inadequate gastrointestinal tolerance, the patient should be put on parenteral nutrition.

However, it is known that patients with Addison's disease (primary adrenal insufficiency) and congenital adrenal hyperplasia have a slightly increased overall risk of catching infections. Moreover, primary adrenal insufficiency is associated to an impaired natural immunity function with a defective action of neutrophils and natural killer cells [11] . This may explain, in part, this slightly increased rate of infectious diseases in these patients, as well as an overall increased mortality. This latter could also be accounted by an insufficient compensatory increase of the hydrocortisone dosage at the time of the beginning of an episode of infection. For all these reasons, patients with adrenal insufficiency may be at higher risk of medical complications and eventually at increased mortality risk in the case of COVID-19 infection.
