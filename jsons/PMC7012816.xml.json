Great efforts have been devoted to the characterization and control of porcine pleuropneumonia in the past 30 years, and considerable achievements have been made. A total of 18 serovars of A. pleuropneumoniae have been identified till now, all of these serovars are able to colonize pigs2. Since A. pleuropneumoniae is susceptible to drying and other antibacterial factors, direct transmission from infected to susceptible healthy pigs is considered to be the most frequent means by which the disease spreads3. Airborne transmission of A. pleuropneumoniae was also confirmed to occur over a short distance (1 m)4. Pigs of all ages are susceptible to A. pleuropneumoniae infection, especially fattening pigs at about 3-months old, and the first outbreak in herds often leads to high morbidity and mortality5. A. pleuropneumoniae contains several virulence factors, which are involved in the steps of adherence, colonization and tissue damage during infection, including Apx toxins, LPS, CPS, adhesins, outer membrane proteins, and transcriptional regulators6.",

The problem of AMR in A. pleuropneumoniae should not be underestimated at present8, and the use of drugs is undesirable for consumers of ethically produced food. Therefore, vaccination is a one of the most promising strategies for the control of porcine pleuropneumonia9. Several types of vaccines against this disease, including inactivated vaccine, subunit vaccine, ghost vaccine, DNA vaccine, edible vaccine, heterologous vaccine and live attenuated vaccine, have been developed in recent years10. However, only the first two types of vaccines have been introduced to the market, and other vaccines, which have been claimed to be effective, still have a long way to go before they can be marketed. Advantages of inactivated and subunit vaccines in the control of porcine pleuropneumonia are recognized, but some defects are notable. Bacterin-based inactivated vaccines often show limited cross-serovar protection, and subunit vaccines protect animals from death, but do not eradicate the invading bacteria completely9. Improvement in the immunogenicity of existing vaccines is a highly desired objective in this field. Bacterin formula, composed of more than one prevalent A. pleuropneumoniae serovar, could provide improved cross-serovar protection11. Discovery of novel conserved and protective antigens based on our understanding of A. pleuropneumoniae infection, or through modern proteomics technologies, is essential for the development of effective vaccines against porcine pleuropneumonia12\u201314.",

A number of lipoproteins were predicted from A. pleuropneumoniae in previous studies17,18. To evaluate the potential of these lipoproteins as vaccine candidates, 55 lipoproteins were cloned from the genome of A. pleuropneumoniae JL03 (serovar 3) and expressed in Escherichia coli. The reactivity of these recombinant proteins was assessed by western blotting analysis, and five of them were selected and tested for their potential as vaccine candidates against A. pleuropneumoniae infection in mice.

Vaccination is considered to be one of the most promising strategies for control of the disease. However, traditional vaccines on the market against A. pleuropneumoniae show a varying degree of defects in terms of cross-protection and protection against morbidity and mortality9,10. Development of novel types of vaccines and identification of candidate vaccine antigens are important approaches to overcome the deficiencies of current vaccines, and have received much attention in recent years10. Immunogenic proteins from the cell surface and outer membrane of A. pleuropneumoniae have been identified by phage display, immunoproteomic analysis or bioinformatic prediction12,20,21. In addition, antigens expressed during A. pleuropneumoniae infection were found using the in vivo-induced antigen technology22. The protective immunity of some identified proteins was investigated, although only a few of the tested proteins provided partial protection, and most of them induced considerable seroconversion in inoculated animals, suggesting that they are potential candidates for subunit vaccines13,20,21. These results demonstrate that high-throughput screening and bioinformatics technologies are powerful tools in identifying novel vaccine antigens. We targeted bacterial lipoproteins in the present study to screen for protective antigens for vaccine development.",

Results indicate that these selected lipoproteins were able to stimulated protective immunity in mice against challenged by lethal virulent pleuropneumoniae serovar 1. Then the protective efficacy of three selected lipoproteins were verified in the natural host, the pigs in this study. Pigs immunized with lipoproteins elicited considerable antibodies against target proteins before challenge (Table 3), confirming that recombinant lipoproteins produced in E. coli are immunogenic. Pigs vaccinated with lipoproteins, showed few clinical symptoms or lung lesions after challenge with virulent heterologous serovar 1 (Table 4). In addition, the histological examinations confirm pigs in the unvaccinated control group infected with A. pleuropneumoniae serovar 1 suffered from pleuritis and hemorrhagic pneumonia, whereas lung sections from lipoprotein-immunized groups showed less pathological changes than those of unvaccinated groups (Fig. 6). Taken together, results indicate that these three lipoproteins provide effective protection for pigs against virulent A. pleuropneumoniae challenge.

The PotD protein, which is reported to be a potential vaccine candidate against Streptococcus pneumoniae infection27, was recently shown to be involved in the growth, stress tolerance and virulence of A. pleuropneumoniae28. The outer membrane, lipoprotein-trafficking protein LolB29, delays the development of disease in pigs upon challenge with virulent A. pleuropneumoniae20. Although PlpB is a potential target of subunit vaccine against Pasteurella multocida30, it was not protective against A. pleuropneumoniae, probably because the recombinant A. pleuropneumoniae PlpB protein was not folded into a soluble conformation when expressed in E. coli31. The A. pleuropneumoniae HgbA protein is homologous to the Haemophilus influenzae periplasmic HbpA protein, which has been implicated in the uptake of heme and glutathione, and associated with bacterial virulence32,33. Immunization with a single HbpA protein provided partial protection for mice against challenge with virulent A. pleuropneumoniae21. In the present study, all four of these proteins were recognized by the rabbit anti-A. pleuropneumoniae serum by western blotting (Fig. 3). Immunization of mice with PotD elicited a high level of humoral immune response, and conferred partial protection on mice in our vaccine trials. These data suggest that our experimental approach based on bioinformatics and immunological testing is capable of selecting effective candidate antigens.",

            "text": "The list of candidate lipoproteins in Table 2 includes 13 soluble expressed proteins, which have been functionally annotated according to the sequence similarities with other bacterial species34. In addition to the reported proteins described above, five antigens exhibited strong signals in western blotting analysis in our study: SlyB (APJL_0038), PlpD (APJL_0487), TadD (APJL_0542), HlpA (APJL_0922) and TolA (APJL_1740). Involvement of these factors in cellular processes and infection with A. pleuropneumoniae and some other pathogens have been mentioned before. In Burkholderia multivorans, the outer membrane lipoprotein SlyB has been shown to contribute to membrane integrity35. PlpD was found to be homologous with the E. coli BamE, which is the core component of \u03b2-barrel assembly machine (Bam), and is reported to regulate outer membrane integrity and cell viability36. TadD of the tight adherence (tad) locus is up-regulated when A. pleuropneumoniae is cultured in biofilm-formation medium, emphasizing the possible importance of TadD for biofilm formation37. APJL_0922 encodes a protein with homology to d-methionine-binding lipoprotein MetQ of other bacteria. Previous studies have suggested that MetQ is involved in methionine transport, cell adherence, intracellular survival in Neisseria gonorrhoeae, and more importantly, the surface-located MetQ protein is a promising vaccine candidate that elicits bactericidal and functional blocking antibodies38. The A. pleuropneumoniae TolA protein is homologous to the colicin transporter of Neisseria sicca, and contains 15 copies of EAEAKAKA in the intragenic tandem repeat (TR) region at the N terminus, and is implicated in E. coli colicin uptake, filamentous phage infection, and detergent tolerance39. The TR region of TolA was truncated in the present study, so as to increase the production and solubility of the immunogenic C terminus of TolA. Two proteins, HlpA and TolA, which showed strong positive signals in our western blotting analysis, were used for animal experiments. These two proteins, especially HlpA, provided significant protection in our mouse model. Our results support the findings that at least some immunoreactive lipoproteins are protective vaccine candidates.",

            "text": "A particularly interesting finding is the identification of 23 lipoproteins that so far have only been annotated as hypothetical. It is worth noting that a number of hypothetical proteins (APJL_0221, APJL_1318, APJL_1380, APJL_1469, APJL_1726 and APJL_1976) yielded clearly positive reactions with rabbit anti-A. pleuropneumoniae serum in western blotting. Two hypothetical lipoproteins, APJL_1380 and APJL_1976, were selected for further investigation. On the basis of in silico analysis, APJL_1380 is homologous to E. coli outer membrane, penicillin-binding protein activator LpoA, which is reported to stimulate the transpeptidase activity of peptidoglycan synthase PBP1A and thus regulate peptidoglycan synthesis40,41. However, the roles of LpoA in immunological protection and pathogenesis have not been addressed before. Here, our data showed that APJL_1380 elicited effective protection in animals in both active and passive immunization assays. To our knowledge, this is the first report of the vaccine potential of the LpoA lipoprotein homolog from \u03b3-proteobacteria. The hypothetical protein APJL_1976 is homologous to the H. influenzae NlpD. NlpD has been identified as being cell-surface located and is important for membrane stability of H. influenzae42, and it is reported to be essential for pathogenicity of Yersinia pestis43. Immunization with APJL_1976 could induce high IgG titer and confer partial protection against infection with virulent A. pleuropneumoniae. These results suggest that many immunogenic antigens are still undiscovered in A. pleuropneumoniae. Further investigation of the biological roles of these hypothetical proteins may provide insight into the pathogenesis of A. pleuropneumoniae.",

The data present here provide important information for exploration of novel subunit vaccines. In addition, they also provide clues for further development of new diagnostic assays for assessment of A. pleuropneumoniae infection, and for investigation of the molecular mechanisms of A. pleuropneumoniae pathogenicity. We know that one immunogenic protein often elicits limited protection against bacterial infection; thus, bacterial subunit vaccines contain a number of protective antigens. However, a recent study indicated that administration of certain combinations of A. pleuropneumoniae protective components results in more serious lesions than those induced by individual immunogens upon challenge14. Therefore, we are currently investigating different vaccine formulations based on the A. pleuropneumoniae Apx toxins, by the addition of these newly discovered vaccine candidates.",

Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) plates were coated with appropriate amounts of purified proteins (0.2\u20130.3 \u03bcg/well for each protein), and blocked with PBST (PBS with 0.05% Tween 20) plus 5% skimmed milk for 1 h. Serum samples were serially diluted and added to coated ELISA plates, and incubated at 37 \u00b0C for 30 min. After four washes, 100 \u03bcl horseradish peroxidase (HRP)-labeled goat anti-mouse (or anti-porcine) IgG (Southern Biotechnology Associates, Birmingham, AL, USA) diluted 1:5000 in PBST was added to each well, and the plate was incubated at 37 \u00b0C for 30 min. The plate was washed five times, then color was developed with a 3,3\u2032,5,5\u2032-tetramethylbenzidine color development kit (Tiangen Biotech Co. Ltd., Beijing, China). The catalytic reaction was stopped with 50 \u03bcl 1% SDS. The optical density was read at 630 nm (OD630) in an ELISA microplate reader (PowerWave XS; Bio-Tek, Winooski, VT, USA). The antibody titers were expressed as the reciprocal of the highest dilution giving an OD630 value above the cutoff value.",
