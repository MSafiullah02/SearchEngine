The initial estimates were that registered infectives would be between 1/3 and 1/4 of the actual infectives [1]; there have been claims (in the famous speech by the British Government scientific advisers) that this ratio could be as little as 1/10. In a recent contribution [2] Li et al. estimate that 86% of infections remain undetected; in other words only about 1/7 of the infections are detected and can thus be isolated. More recently, other studies have suggested that the fractions of undetected infections could be even higher [3, 4] .",

These estimate are -for the parameters which best fit the present situation -about one third of those for the SIR model as far as the height of the epidemic peak is concerned, and about half for what concerns the time scale of the epidemics. Moreover, the model suggests that an overwhelming part of the population will have been in contact with the virus -most of them with no or very little symptoms -so that if permanent immunity is gained by the immune system of infected, and the virus does not mutate too quickly, one would be confident that there will be no second run of COVID in next year.",

The parameters \u03b1 and \u03b2 describe the contact rate and the removal rate; they depend both on the characteristics of the pathogen and on social behavior. For example, a prompt isolation of infected individuals is reflected in raising \u03b2, a reduction of social contacts is reflected in lowering \u03b1, and both these actions raise the epidemic threshold \u03b3. If this is raised above the level of the total population N , the epidemic stops (which means the number of infected individuals starts to decrease, albeit new individuals will still be infected). The same effect can be obtained by reducing the population N (keeping \u03b1 and \u03b2 constant), i.e. by partitioning it into non-communicating compartments, each of them with a population below the epidemic threshold. 1 One can easily obtain the relation between I and S by considering (1) and (2), eliminating dt; these provide",

Assuming that infective people are immediately isolated, this provides an estimate (actually from below) of R(t). Thus we should be able to compare the predictions for the removed class with epidemiological data, and in order to do this we should focus on R(t). We stress that his problem was already clear to Kermack and McKendrick [5] , see e.g. the discussion in Murray [7] , and that we will basically follow their idea albeit with a relevant difference, which will allow for a simpler fit of the data.",

Remark 6. We said above that the parameters \u03b2 and \u03be can not be altered \"in this framework\"; this requires a brief explanation. As for \u03be this statement is rather clear, and is connected to considering J as the class of asymptomatic infectives, while if they were meant to be the class of registered infectives, \u03be could be altered by a large scale campaign of tests on asymptomatic population. On the other hand, for what concerns \u03b2 the impossibility of compressing the time from infection to isolation is \"in this framework\" in the sense that in it isolation depends on the display of symptoms (plus some unavoidable reaction delay). The time \u03b2 \u22121 could instead be compressed by a campaign of tracing contacts of known (symptomatic or asymptomatic) infectives. These points will not be discussed here, but will be considered in a cognate paper [13] . \u2299 On the other hand, it is conceivable that \u03b7 \u22121 could somehow be compressed if a general screening was conducted, or more simply if all individuals having even the lightest symptoms would more rigorously isolate themselves. At the same time, the contact rate \u03b1 can be reduced by a more or less rigorous lockout; in our discussion, this reduction is encoded in the reduction parameter r, which yields the ratio of the achieved contact rate over the \"natural\" one -i.e. the one measured at the beginning of the epidemic.",

In both cases, the mitigation measures taken at the beginning of March -which according to our analysis led to a reduction factor r \u2243 0.6 in the contact rate [12] -would produce a halving of the epidemic peak and a doubling of the peak time; further measures were taken one week later (March 8), with still stricter ones two further weeks later (March 22), and hopefully these can stop the epidemic spread. 18 We have studied in more detail the case which best fits the epidemiological data outside the period used to fix the model parameters; this corresponds to \u03b2 \u22121 = 7 and \u03be = 1/10 (in the Supplementary Material we also consider \u03be = 1/7). In this framework, two cases are possible: either the restrictive measures are only mitigating the epidemic, or they are capable of stopping it by raising the epidemic threshold above the population level. In the first case, a reduction of \u03b7 \u22121 from 21 to 14 days produce a substantial lowering of the epidemic peak and also substantially postpones its occurrence; in the second case, the effect of such a reduction may be quite relevant if the population remains just under the threshold (see the cases with r = 0.2 in Tables 4 and 7) , or not so relevant if the reduction of the contact rate is taking the epidemic threshold well above the population level (see the cases with lower r in Tables ?? and 7) .",

In other words, the dynamic was altered by these measures and the effects of this alteration started to show on R(t) (the data provided by the Health System we are considering) from March 15. Thus the real testing ground for our model is in the capacity to correctly predict data for the days March 10 through March 15 on the basis of the fitting of previous days.
