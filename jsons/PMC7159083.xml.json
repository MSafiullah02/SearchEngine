An influenza pandemic is an obvious example of a global-security threat. HIV and AIDS are inextricably linked with national and global security. AIDS is crippling economies and also compromising the governance, state stability, and military capacities of many African countries.10 In view of South Africa's international tourism boom and global trade and transport systems, recent emergence of extensively drug-resistant tuberculosis is another example of disease with a global threat.11 Migration brings economic and social benefits. Although many migrants are healthy, some have complex, specific health needs (eg, mental health, communicable disease).12 People developing communicable disease control policies, such as pre-embarkation screening for tuberculosis and HIV, should do so on the basis of sound public-health evidence.",

The commission estimated that in developing countries, a basic health-care package of US$34 per person would save 8 million lives a year, which would generate economic benefits of $360 billion.

Increasing the number of public\u2013private partnerships that include commercial drug and biotechnology companies is one way to do this. A second approach is fairer regulation of international trade. The Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights (TRIPs) agreement is designed to protect the rights of patent holders over knowledge systems or products including, for example, drugs. In 2003, World Trade Organisation (WTO) members agreed that developing countries with insufficient manufacturing capacity in the pharmaceutical sector could make effective use of the compulsory licensing provisions contained in the TRIPs agreement, which was amended in 2005. These changes are designed to make it easier for poor countries to import cheaper generic medicines if they are unable to manufacture them. Developed countries have an obligation to help poor countries make the most of these flexibilities with the aid for trade approach.23 The General Agreement on Trade in Services is the first multilateral trade agreement to cover trade and investment in services. It constitutes the legal framework through which WTO members progressively liberalise trade in services, including, where members wish, health-related services. The Codex Alimentarius Commission, a UN Food and Agriculture Organization and WHO body, sets standards, codes of practice, guidelines, and other recommendations for food quality and safety to protect consumers from food-borne illness from home-grown and imported food and ensure fair trade practices in the food trade.",
