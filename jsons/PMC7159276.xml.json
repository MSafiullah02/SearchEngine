            "text": "Latent tuberculosis is present in a third of the world's population, with the prevalence of active tuberculosis in many areas exceeding 700 cases per 100 000 of the population.1 This global epidemic is fuelled by synergy with HIV, which is found in 40\u201370% of African patients with active tuberculosis.1 Most deaths from tuberculosis are preventable by early diagnosis and treatment.2 In areas of high prevalence, sputum smear microscopy is often the only available and affordable test, but at best achieves a sensitivity of 50\u201370%. Culture of Mycobacterium tuberculosis, the diagnostic gold standard, is sensitive and specific in cases of smear-positive tuberculosis, but takes 2\u20136 weeks to yield a result and is not routinely used in countries with high prevalences of tuberculosis. In these areas, tuberculin skin tests are often insufficiently accurate to aid diagnosis,3 and do not readily distinguish between contained infection and disease. Serological tests for tuberculosis have focused on detection of mycobacterial antigens and, like skin tests, can be confounded by crossreactivity with non-pathogenic mycobacteria or previous immunisation with BCG.4 Recently developed tests based on DNA amplification or interferon \u03b3 release are expensive and need particular expertise.5 A cheap, accurate, and rapid diagnostic test for tuberculosis will have immense impact on the control of this disease. For example, a test yielding results within a few hours but with a sensitivity similar to that of existing tests such as sputum microscopy (which requires two or more clinic visits) would be a great advance because it would enable initiation of treatment at a single clinic visit.",

Because the biological complexity of most diseases means that individual biomarkers have limited diagnostic sensitivities and specificities, analysis of combinations of several biomarkers offers the possibility of enhanced diagnostic accuracy. High throughput proteomic profiling of serum has been revolutionised by recent advances in mass spectrometry, such as surface-enhanced laser desorption ionisation time of flight (SELDI-ToF) mass spectrometry.6 The application of approaches based on machine learning to the problem of pattern recognition7 makes it possible to identify diagnostic combinations of proteins (diagnostic signatures) embedded within such profiles.8 Analysis of serum proteomic fingerprints has improved diagnostic accuracy for some cancers6, 9, 10 and infections such as human African trypanosomiasis.11 This approach has also been used in the search for novel biomarkers for severe acute respiratory syndrome12 and intra-amniotic infections.13 We assessed the potential of proteomic fingerprinting as a basis for diagnosis of pulmonary tuberculosis.",

For example, we included patients with sarcoidosis, which is frequently included in the differential diagnosis of pulmonary tuberculosis, and other severe respiratory infections representing patients who have non-tuberculous destructive pulmonary pathology. To allow for systemic inflammatory processes that can mimic tuberculosis, we recruited patients with other systemic infections, and patients with inflammatory bowel and autoimmune diseases. 21 healthy volunteers were also included among the controls.

The results of the in-gel tryptic digest were corroborated by tryptic digestion after passive elution of the protein from the gel. The peptide mass fingerprints were used to interrogate public databases with the MASCOT search engine.17\n",

The choice of chip surface was based on our previous observation that the CM10 surface-chemistry yields particularly rich spectra from serum.11 Spectra were assigned randomly to a training and testing set and we then used supervised machine learning classification methods (table 3\n, webappendix) to discriminate the proteomic spectra of patients with tuberculosis from the controls using the training and testing set approach (table 2). The ability of a classifier to discriminate data correctly in the testing set is known as its generalisation performance.18, 29 We compared the generalisation performance of a range of classifiers by plotting their performance on the testing set in ROC space (figure 1A\n). A Gaussian kernel SVM16, 29, 30 (table 3 and figure 1A, red square) was the best discriminator between tuberculosis and control groups, with a sensitivity of 93\u00b75% and specificity of 94\u00b79% (overall accuracy 94\u00b72%). This SVM classifier defines the convex hull of the ROC space (figure 1A, red line), achieving the best accuracy. Samples from five patients with tuberculosis and four controls in the testing set were misclassified (webtable 1). Notably, 21 of the 24 control patients with respiratory infection in the test set were correctly classified by the SVM, as were all seven patients with sarcoidosis.

We therefore identified two of the 20 most discriminatory proteins to demonstrate the possibility of implementing more conventional diagnostic assays that are adaptable for field use. These proteins (serum amyloid A and transthyretin), selected by Pearson correlation analysis and confirmed by SVM classification of proteomic signatures, have already been independently associated with pathophysiological processes in tuberculosis. Serum amyloid A is an acute phase protein that is associated with circulating high-density lipoprotein33 and modulates lipid trafficking and immune responses. It is the precursor protein in reactive amyloidosis, which complicates chronic tuberculosis in some individuals, and is a marker of disease activity in several inflammatory states, including tuberculosis.34 The ELISA assay used a commercially available antibody that recognises total serum amyloid A rather than the des-arginine subtype identified in the signature. Specific detection of this variant might further enhance diagnostic discrimination. Transthyretin is a 55 kDa homotetramer in serum and a major transporter of thyroxine and tri-iodothyronine, as well as vitamin A (retinol or trans-retinoic acid) through association with retinol-binding protein.35 Retinoic acid stimulates monocyte differentiation and inhibits multiplication of M tuberculosis in human macrophages.36 Low levels of vitamin A, correlating with reduced transthyretin and raised concentrations of C-reactive protein, have been reported in patients with tuberculosis.37, 38 A truncated form of transthyretin is a negative marker in proteomic fingerprinting studies on ovarian cancer;39 serum amyloid A is a positive marker in severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS),12 and indicates relapse in nasopharyngeal cancer.40\n",

Although collection biases were difficult to control because we also used archived samples, we sought to minimise postcollection bias by interspersing the processing of samples from cases and controls over months and by using samples from four geographical sites and with varying HIV serostatus. Another possible source of bias is the predominance of African patients in the tuberculosis group and white people in the controls. However, at least 58 of 170 controls were of sub-Saharan African origin. It is possible, although unlikely, that our classifiers detect the presence of tuberculosis infection rather than active disease. Tuberculin skin-test reactivity (as a questionable marker of latent tuberculosis) was not available for most control patients, but a substantial minority of the African and Asian control patients were probably latently infected. Moreover, the effectiveness of the classifier on the basis of the four biomarkers (three of which are inflammatory markers), provides evidence against discrimination between the groups on the basis of quiescent tuberculosis. Notably, of the five patients with tuberculosis misclassified by the SVM, three were Ugandan, whereas of the four misclassified controls, two were white. The diverse pathologies in the control group are also likely to have made correct classification more difficult. Furthermore, the findings are unlikely to have been biased by systematic differences in concurrent drug treatment, because only 12 of the patients with tuberculosis had started chemotherapy at the time of recruitment.",

We therefore applied our trained classifier to a second, independent dataset that was collected prospectively at a later date in the UK, over 4 months. Patients in this dataset were more closely matched for ethnic origin and included a greater proportion of controls with respiratory disease than in the training set. All samples in the test set were processed with precisely the same standard operating protocol. The fact that the diagnostic performance of the classifiers survived rigorous testing in this new set strengthens the conclusions of the first part of the study. The small decrease in diagnostic accuracy might be at least partly attributable to the small size of the second dataset, and might also reflect the existence of some biases in the first dataset. The limitations of the SELDI-ToF platform with respect to reproducibility in peak intensity might also have an effect. For example, although we found average interassay coefficients of variation of about 24% for nine universally present peaks in our quality control spectra, there may be larger variations in low intensity peaks residing closer to noise. This suggestion is consistent with maintenance of greater diagnostic accuracy across two datasets seen with inherently less variable immunological assays, and strengthens diagnostic approaches that use two independent assays. A key advantage of SELDI-ToF MS lies in the discovery phase, which can profile large numbers of samples in a high throughput fashion, and by using whole signatures, reduce problems with individual variability in peak detection.",

In some cases, truncated or fragmented derivatives of common plasma proteins might be more specific markers of some diseases and arise by proteolytic enzyme induction characteristic of defined disease states.41 For example, the des-arginine variant of serum amyloid A we identified might be more specific than other variants for tuberculosis. Similarly, truncated forms of another apparently non-specific acute-phase protein, \u03b11-antitrypsin, have been reported as relatively specific markers in SARS.12 Thus, a possible explanation for the apparent paradox that seemingly non-specific acute-phase proteins could provide diagnostic specificity for particular infections, is the possibility of disease-specific modification of common proteins, as has been proposed for several cancers.8\n",

Each block of three bars shows the values for accuracy (red), sensitivity (green) and specificity (blue) obtained when the sigma Gaussian-kernel was optimised for each of these criteria. (C) Averaged ROC using ten-fold train crossvalidation with test. 100 randomly selected train and test sets with a train:test ratio [80:20]. Parameters were selected with a ten-fold crossvalidation on the train set and performance obtained in the test. Red line shows averaged ROC curve of classifiers obtained when kernel parameter is selected on accuracy criteria. Similar ROC curves were obtained when selecting on sensitivity and specificity (webfigure 1).",
