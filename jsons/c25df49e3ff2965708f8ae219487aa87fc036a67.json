Any patient undergoing abdominal scan in anticipation of surgery should also have chest scan, as swabs can give false negatives. (6) In planning surgery, risk of complications requiring urgent new surgery should be minimized; in colorectal surgery, for instance, stoma should be used more frequently (stoma versus primary anastomosis). (7) In suspicion of COVID-19 or when infection cannot be ruled out, workers participating in surgical procedures must wear PPE, which must be used in cases of ascertained infection, namely: tested FFP2 respirator; eye protection; double waterproof long-sleeved protective gown and double gloves. (8) Laparoscopy represents an approach involving a greater risk of transmission by aerosol; therefore, it must be chosen with extreme caution and by keeping pneumoperitoneum at the lowest possible level. Laparoscopy should be reserved for selected patients, taking into account risk/benefit balance, on a case-bycase basis.

(3) If available, use a room connected to negative pressure pre-room space, with separate entrance, that can be used in PPE dressing or undressing, possibly with active assistance and in storing materials that might turn out as necessary when procedure has already begun. (4) According to CDC, procedures producing aerosols should take place inside a negative pressure room, although patients could run a greater risk of infections at surgical site. (5) During surgery, aspiration of surgical fumes is paramount in reducing risk of transmission by aerosol. (6) In a negative pressure room, doors must remain closed and the number of workers coming in and going out must be reduced. When further surgical materials are required, request should be done on the phone to healthcare worker, who leaves them inside pre-theatre area, by keeping door to operating room closed. Later, surgical team should take them by keeping access door to pre-theatre space closed.",
