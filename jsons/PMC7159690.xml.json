For centuries, Southeast Asian farms have been producing incidental crops of wild prawns in tidal ponds. With the advent of everadvancing technology and the increasing requirement for low\u2010cost protein as a food source, penaeid culture has advanced from its experimental nascent beginnings to major industries generating hundreds of thousands of jobs, billions of dollars in revenue and an expansion of the world's food supply with a high\u2010value crop (Lightner & Redman 1998). The importance of disease within this area has increased proportionally with the growth of the prawn industry.",

An economic impact assessment from Lundin (1997) reported that in 1994, just over 2 billion US dollars were lost due to disease. Disease outbreaks continue to cause major losses.

Gill\u2010associated virus is the junior synonym of lymphoid organ virus (LOV), which was reported in 1995 by Spann, Vickers and Lester. Lymphoid organ virus was reported to be found only in the lymphoid organ, bearing a similarity to YHV with respect to ultrastructural and cytopathological features. However, LOV was reported as having no association with disease and mortality (Spann, Vickers & Lester 1995; Spann, Cowley, Walker & Lester 1997). Gill\u2010associated virus was subsequently reported as a pathogenic relative of LOV, found both in the lymphoid organ and the gills of infected Penaeus monodon (Spann et al. 1997). With the use of sequencing analysis on the genome of LOV and GAV, research identified that in fact, LOV had a 98.9% nucleotide identity to the GAV sequence, indicating that they are the same virus (Cowley, Dimmock, Spann & Walker 2000b). However, the method to determine the level of nucleotide similarity used only two clones to determine the 1.1% (3/274) nucleotide variation.",

            "text": "There has been considerable confusion with respect to the taxonomic classification of YHLV. Initially, YHLV was proposed to be a baculovirus due to its size and enveloped rod\u2010shaped appearance (Chantanachookin, Boonyaratpalin, Kasornchandra, Direkbusarakom, Ekpanithanpong, Supamataya, Sriurairatana & Flegel 1993). However, upon the discovery that the genome consisted of ssRNA, it was reported that the virus was either a rhabdovirus or a coronavirus (Wongteerasupaya, Sriurairatana, Vickers, Akrajamorn, Boonsaeng, Panyim, Tassanakajon, Withyachumnarnkul & Flegel 1995). Loh, Tapay, Lu and Nadala (1997) reported the genome as negative in polarity, resulting in the virus being classified as Rhabdoviridae. However, it was subsequently reported that YHLV was a plus\u2010strand RNA virus via in situ hybridization and sequence analysis (Tang & Lightner 1999). These latest results placed YHLV into the corona\u2010like viruses. In 2000, Cowley, Dimmock, Spann & Walker (2000a) stated that the YHLV genome contains an open reading frame (ORF) 1a polyprotein containing a 3C\u2010like Cys protease, an ORF1b coding sequence with replicase functions including an SDD polyprotein, and a helicase domain, an efficient \u2013 one ribosomal frameshift site at the ORF1a/1b overlap that facilitates translation of a 759 kDa ORF1ab polyprotein. From this, it was concluded that the YHLV was a unique member of the Nidovirales. The YHLV have subsequently been placed as members of a new genus Okavirus of a new family Roniviridae, within the order Nidovirales (Mayo 2002). There are two other families within the order Nidovirales. These are Coronaviridae and Arteriviridae (Fig. 1).",

Lu et al. (1995) reported that the lymphoid organ, gill and head muscle had a 50% tissue culture infectious dose assay (TCID50) titre (mL\u22121) of 106, while the midgut, abdominal muscle and heart had a TCID50 titre (mL\u22121) of 105 and the nerve cord, hepatopancreas and the eyestalk had a TCID50 titre (mL\u22121) of 104. These findings suggest that the lymphoid organ, gill and head muscle contained the highest number of infectious virions compared with the other tested tissue/organs. Cowley, Hall, Cadogan, Spann and Walker (2002) tested gonads from P. monodon for signs of YHLV and reported that the reverse transcription nested polymerase chain reaction (RT\u2010nPCR) products had a greater intensity from the spermatophores than those amplified from the lymphoid organ. These results indicate that the viral infection was systemic. Virions with a morphological appearance similar to YHLV have also been reported in the optic nerve fibres and in the nerve cord of P. monodon (Smith 2000; Callinan, Jiang, Smith & Soowannayan 2003). To confirm the entire viral distribution in prawn tissues, a more comprehensive examination must be conducted in other organs and tissues such as haematopoietic tissue, Y\u2010organ, stomach, antennal gland, periopods, pleopods and uropods.",

The YHLV was first described in Thailand in 1990 by Limsuwan (Chantanachookin et al. 1993). Limsuwan named the new syndrome based on the light yellow colouration of the dorsal cephalothorax area and the general pale appearance of the infected prawn. This yellow appearance was a result of the underlying enlarged yellow hepatopancreas. Since this time, the disease has been associated with epizootic mortalities in Thailand. Evidence suggests that YHLV is one of the most highly virulent viruses of causative agents in Thailand, as it is associated with the massive mortality of P. monodon, until recently the principal penaeid species cultured in Thailand (Sithigorngul, Chauychuwong, Sithigorngul, Longyant, Chaivisuthangkura & Menasveta 2000). Since the identification of the causative agent as YHLV in Thailand in 1990 and the resulting epizootic mortalities it was associated with, the virus has been associated with mortalities in penaeid prawns in Taiwan, Indonesia, Malaysia, China, Philippines, India, Australia and the Americas (1996, 1996, 1997).",

The farm was in close proximity to a prawn processing plant and it was suggested that the virus was imported from Asia (Lightner, Redman, Poulos, Nunan, Mari & Hasson 1997). However, research by Pantoja and Lightner (2003) demonstrated that the diagnosis of the YHLV was most probably due to misinterpretation of the lymphoid organ necrosis in the prawns infected with acute white spot syndrome virus (WSSV) infection. Pantoja and Lightner (2003) demonstrated that acute WSSV infection can cause necrosis of the lymphoid organ and other tissues and display histological characteristics very similar to those observed from YHLV infection. Yellow head\u2010like virus has also been detected in frozen prawns that had been imported into the United States from Asia. At present, there is no evidence to show that YHLV is now present in wild or farmed prawns in the Americas.",

Since the initial epizootic, it has been suggested that the disease is now less severe than when YHLV was first isolated in Thailand. Yellow head\u2010like virus infection is now common in healthy prawns.

During the peak of the YHLV epidemic in Thailand, YHLV was detected by TEM in gill samples from at least one prawn from 15 ponds with gross signs and a pond history that indicated YHLV was present. In the three ponds with no signs of YHLV disease, six out of six prawns sampled negative for YHLV by TEM. However, later in the YHLV epidemic, YHLV could be detected by TEM in gill samples from 33 out of 44 healthy prawns sampled from 11 ponds without signs of YHLV (Walker, Cowley, Spann, Hodgson, Hall & Withyachumnarnkul 2001).",

A survey conducted in the Philippines on 219 healthy prawns with Western blot analysis also indicated a relatively high prevalence (24.2%) of YHLV infection (Natividad, Magbanua, Migo, Alfafara, Albaladejo, Nadala, Loh & Tapay 1999). The prevalence varied between 0% and 66.7% depending upon which districts were sampled. There was also evidence of a higher prevalence of infection in postlarvae (54.5%) than in broodstock (16.9%). With respect to the limited sensitivity of Western blot methods compared with two\u2010step PCR, the true level of chronic YHLV infection in the Philippines may be much higher.

Therefore, chronic YHLV infection may have been highly prevalent in healthy prawns before the appearance of the disease.

An experiment to determine the susceptibility of postlarval (PL) P. monodon to YHLV by ingestion showed that PL20 died 7\u201310 days post\u2010infection but PL15 survived the exposure (Walker et al. 2001). The available data suggested that disease was associated with viral loading. Walker et al. (2001) reported that YHLV from a diseased P. monodon caused mortalities after ingestion or immersion exposure but extracts from YHLV\u2010infected healthy P. monodon caused infection without mortality. However, after the viral concentration of the healthy prawns had an equivalent titre to the diseased prawn, YHLV extracts from chronically infected, healthy P. monodon also induced disease, indicating that the disease is associated with viral loading. However, in these studies there was no referral to the possibility of multiple viral infections.",

(2002) tested gonads and lymphoid organs for signs of YHLV from healthy male and female P. monodon broodstock and in fertilized eggs in addition to nauplii spawned from wild\u2010fertilized females using RT\u2010nPCR. The results indicated that the level of YHLV in wild P. monodon was generally low. However, high levels of YHLV were detected in moribund male broodstock reared in captivity for more than 12 months. The RT\u2010nPCR products from spermatophores in these prawns were also significantly greater than those amplified from the lymphoid organ, which had previously been identified as the primary site of YHLV replication in chronically infected P. monodon (Spann et al. 1995). It was also reported that in one out of three spermatophores examined by TEM, mature YHLV virions were detected in the seminal fluid but not in the sperm cells. The RT\u2010nPCR for YHLV in eggs were positive; however, nauplii and protozoea were generally negative. This implies that YHLV is associated with the egg surface and the majority of the virus is lost when the nauplii hatch and that the infection levels in the protozoea remain low. Cowley et al. (2002) argued that this could be due to the lack of development of the lymphoid organ in larval and early postlarval life stages, which is likely to limit potential infection levels. Reverse transcription nested polymerase chain reaction has detected YHLV in PL5 to PL15 both from hatcheries and experimental spawnings of P. monodon (Walker et al. 2001), suggesting that viral replication in postlarvae is occurring at sufficient levels to be detected (Walker et al. 2001). Cowley et al. (2002) reported that the identification of lymphoid organ spheroid bodies and YHLV particles in \u223c1.2 g juvenile P. monodon grown from hatchery stocks (PL6 and PL20) suggests that at least some of the postlarvae were infected with YHLV. However, as individual postlarvae were not grown in isolation, it strongly raises the distinct possibility that some juvenile infections occurred during the course of the grow\u2010out through cannibalism or water\u2010borne transmission. Clearly, this horizontal transmission could promote translocation of YHLV and the potential infection of wild P. monodon in the vicinity of farms via water or through the escape of infected farmed prawns. The authors concluded that the high prevalence of chronic YHLV infection in P. monodon broodstock from northeastern Queensland and farmed prawns produced from these broodstock promotes the idea that this is perpetuated primarily by vertical transmission both in the wild and in hatcheries. Unfortunately, however, in that paper, the authors failed to comment on the likely survival of the YHLV\u2010infected progeny. They only tested eggs and nauplii. It is only a speculation that these postlarvae survive through to adulthood.",

The pathogenicity of YHLV was determined by inoculation of filtered homogenates of the lymphoid organ, gills and whole cephalothoraces from P. monodon that were positive for YHLV, resulting in mortality from 7 to 8 days post\u2010inoculation (Spann et al. 1997). However, at the time of the pathogenicity trial, there were at least five concomitant viruses infecting Australian P. monodon. These viruses consisted of monodon baculovirus (MBV) (Doubrovsky, Paynter, Sambhi, Atherton & Lester 1988), lymphoid parvo\u2010like virus (LPV) (Owens, De Beer & Smith 1991), infectious hypodermal and haematopoietic necrosis virus (IHHNV) (Owens, Anderson, Kenway, Trott & Benzie 1992), spawner\u2010isolated mortality virus (SMV) (Fraser & Owens 1996) and Mourilyan virus (MoV) (Cowley, McCulloch, Spann, Cadogan & Walker 2005), which all could have possibly influenced the mortality of the P. monodon in this trial. This infection trial was repeated in 2004 by Vega et al. In that study, the prawns were again inoculated with filtered prawn homogenate containing levels of YHLV (not purified virus). They reported that 100% (15/15) of the YHLV\u2010injected prawns died compared with 40% (2/5) of the controls. While there was a significant increase (P=0.010) in YHLV for both the infected prawns and the controls during the trial, the YHLV increase was significantly higher (P=0.047) in the YHLV\u2010injected prawns than the control prawns. Again, no other viruses were tested for in that study or referred to as potential pathogens. There are many papers that report YHLV to be pathogenic. However, there is no substantial evidence to support this. Currently, there is only an association with disease. Many papers report that severe necrosis of the lymphoid organ is a typical lesion caused by YHLV (1993, 1993, 1994, 1996). However, penaeid prawns with severe WSSV exhibit the same marked lymphoid organ necrosis (Pantoja & Lightner 2003). The method of injecting YHLV\u2010infected crude homogenate of prawn tissue to determine pathogenicity gives no information as to the virulence of that virus to a species of prawn with respect to our current knowledge of possible multiple viral infections within the same prawn or homogenate sample. To demonstrate a direct pathogenic effect of YHLV, either pathogen\u2010free stock would be required or a viable penaeid cell line would be needed with purified viable YHLV. Until these requirements are available, YHLV can only be said to be associated with disease.",

This disease outbreak was named the mid\u2010crop mortality syndrome (MCMS). An investigation into the syndrome revealed two distinct viral types using TEM (Owens et al. 1998).The two viruses that were implicated as being involved in MCMS were YHLV and SMV (Anderson & Owens 2001). Spawner\u2010isolated mortality virus is a parvo\u2010like virus that was first identified by Fraser and Owens (1996). This virus was isolated from prawns affected by MCMS by Owens et al. (1998). Using a bioassay, Owens et al. (1998) reported that this parvo\u2010like virus was capable of causing mortality. The gross symptoms of SMV were lethargy, reduced feeding and redness of the carapace and pleopods (Fraser & Owens 1996). Owens et al. (1998) reported that SMV virulence in MCMS\u2010affected prawns was enhanced by the presence of other co\u2010infecting viruses such as an enveloped, filiform virus. The co\u2010infecting virus was YHLV, which had first been identified by Spann et al. (1995). The enhanced virulence from YHLV was demonstrated when Owens et al. (1998) treated a prawn extract with ether before injecting it into P. monodon. As SMV is unenveloped, the ether should not have harmed the parvovirus. The extract killed at a slower rate than untreated extract, suggesting that the SMV (or another non\u2010enveloped virus) was capable of causing mortality but that its virulence was enhanced by the presence of other co\u2010infecting viruses such as an enveloped, filiform virus like YHLV. Spann et al. (1997) reported that YHLV was also isolated from prawns affected by MCMS. They reported that diseased prawns were observed swimming at the surface and edge of ponds and displayed varying degrees of red body colouration.

Being TEM, it was observed that the nerve cells in the fasciculated zone contained cytoplasmic vesicles with particles and rod\u2010shaped nucleocapsids. These rods were similar to YHLV and were 130\u2013260 nm long \u00d7 10\u201316 nm in diameter and had a helical symmetry with a screw\u2010like thread. Also, an unidentified enveloped virus, ranging from 50 to 96 nm in diameter, was observed in cytoplasmic vesicles in the fasciculated zone (Fig. 6). Smith (2000) reported that the unidentified enveloped virus was a possible aetiological agent in one of the disease outbreaks. In the paper, Smith (2000) did not suggest what the virus was. From what is reported on the present penaeid viruses, it is likely that this virus was MoV, which is an enveloped virus, averaging 85\u2013100 nm in diameter. From the TEM photograph (Fig. 7), Smith (2000) also reports particles 20 nm in diameter. However, Smith (2000) does not suggest what these could be.

It has been demonstrated that P. monodon, P. japonicus, P. esculentus and P. merguiensis were susceptible to experimental infection (Spann et al. 2000), while P. monodon were the most susceptible out of the four different penaeids and P. japonicus were the least susceptible and displayed a size\u2010related response to the disease with an increased size resulting in increased resistance. The difference in susceptibility between the penaeids may be related to both the dose and their relative susceptibility to the disease, rather than an indication of resistance to infection (Spann et al. 2000). This experiment demonstrated that the four penaeids mentioned were susceptible to infection by YHLV via intra\u2010muscular injection. However, this does not demonstrate that they can be naturally infected. For more substantial results, the prawns should have been infected via bath inoculum or fed infected carcasses. This would give a stronger indication as to whether the three species of prawns are naturally susceptible to YHLV infection because the viral agent would not be by\u2010passing the primary defences of the prawn, i.e. the cuticle or gut. This difference in susceptibility by either experimental or natural pathways is demonstrated by Lu et al. (1994). This research demonstrated that an intra\u2010muscular injection of YHLV into P. vannamei resulted in 100% mortality, despite the fact that P. vannamei now being the dominant species cultured in Asia, there has been no disease report due to YHLV where YHLV is highly enzootic in this region. Other possible reasons for this phenomenon are that YHLV may have mutated from its highly pathogenic variant; multiple viruses are involved in the disease expression or biosecurity and specific pathogen\u2010free stocks may be limiting the chance of infection. However, YHLV is still causing disease in P. monodon within this region and other viruses including the Taura syndrome virus and WSSV still cause disease losses in P. vannamei in this region, resulting in the most probable reason for YHLV not causing disease in P. vannamei even though there is a high chance of infection being the low susceptibility demonstrated by P. vannamei. there is also the possibility that the intra\u2010muscular injection of YHLV by Lu et al.

In 2000, Cowley et al. (2000b) developed an RT\u2010nPCR for the detection of YHLV within Australia. The specific genome amplification with the one\u2010step PCR is able to detect 0.01 pg cDNA while using the two\u2010step PCR technique 0.01 fg cDNA was detectable. The YHLV genome could be detected within 6 h of experimental infection of a P. japonicus. However, again it is probable that the test was detecting genome that was injected into the prawns and does not necessarily indicate viral replication. Gill biopsies can be used as a tissue sample (Cowley et al. 2000b) or more recently, it has been reported that dried haemolymph can be used for the detection of YHLV with RT\u2010PCR (Kiatpathomchai, Jitrapakdee, Panyim & Boonsaeng 2004), resulting in the ability to sample broodstock. A multiplex RT\u2010nPCR has been developed for the differentiation of YHLV from Australia and YHLV from Thailand (Cowley, Cadogan, Wongteerasupaya, Hodgson, Boonsaeng & Walker 2004). The test detected the YHLV in approximately 10 fg of lymphoid organ total RNA. The YHLV from Australia produced a 406 bp product, while the YHLV from Thailand produced a 277 bp product.",

Reported in 2000 and again in 2002, Sithigorngul et al. produced monoclonal antibodies (MAbs) specific to YHLV\u2010enveloped protein. In both experiments, IgG\u2010MAbs were produced. The first experiment resulted in a low yield of hybridomas with MAbs specific to YHLV due to the usage of crude YHLV extract from the gills of an infected P. monodon. The second experiment resulted in higher success of hybridomas specific to YHLV. Most of the YHLV\u2010specific MAbs were specific to the 67 kDa protein and only a few were specific to the 135 and 22 kDa protein. Several of these antibodies against YHLV did bind to haemolymph and tissues from uninfected prawns (Sithigorngul et al. 2002). They did not elaborate as to why this may have occurred. There could be three possibilities for this occurrence; non\u2010specific binding to similar epitopes from the prawn cells, the hybridomas may not have sufficiently screened or even possibly, the reported uninfected prawns had an undetected low level of infection.",

This precipitates an enhanced spread of disease and increased mortalities on the farm primarily due to unknown viral infection or viral load of the prawns being produced or grown in hatcheries and farms. It is inconceivable to ignore the necessity of cheaper detection methods such as the antibody\u2010based tests or HA assays that need to be available for on\u2010farm application, allowing farmers to detect the presence of the virus and the loading of the virus in their farm stock/broodstock.",

With the high level of prawn viral infection throughout the world, contemporaneous reports appear to ignore the potentially profound effects of dual infection of viruses in prawns with regards to disease. Unquestionably, for a greater understanding of how prawn viruses are interacting with each other to cause disease, there is a requirement for further research to infect prawns with individual viruses drawing comparison with prawns dually infected with known viruses. This would enable farmers to predict adequately the likelihood of the occurrence of disease outbreak. For example, it has been reported previously that YHLV infection is present in approximately 97% of P. monodon in Australia. It would be advantageous to determine the effect of dual infection of SMV, MBV, IHHNV, MoV, etc. in the same prawns to ascertain the likelihood occurrence of disease and what mixture of viruses results in disease expression.",
