According to molecular profile, breast cancer was divided into several intrinsic subtypes: luminal-A, luminal-B, HER2-enriched, basal-like, and a normal breast-like group 2 . Triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) is defined as lacking expression of estrogen receptor (ER), progesterone receptor (PR) and epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2). It accounts for 15-20% of all breast cancers and is characterized by enhanced aggressiveness, young age of onset and poor prognosis 3 . All intrinsic subtypes can be found in TNBC, but 50%-75% of TNBC have basal phenotype 4 . Recently, four to six distinct subtypes have been defined within TNBC, such as basal-like and claudin-low 5 . Chemotherapy remains the main treatment for TNBC, but the overall survival for metastatic TNBC is only 13-18 months 6 . Though PARP inhibitors showed promising effect in BRCA mutation patients, their effectiveness in TNBC need to be further verified. So it is very important for us to explore novel biomarkers and potential therapeutic targets in TNBC patients 7 .",

The survival rates for patients with different clinicopathological characteristics were listed in Table 1 . Patients older than 50 years old had a significantly better 5 y DFS rate than those younger than 50 years old (79.4% vs. 68.0%, P = 0.044, HR = 0.572, 95%CI: 0.332-0.986).

We further investigated the relationship between different genotypes and the risk of hematological (neutropenia, thrombocytopenia and anemia) and non-hematological toxicities (nausea, vomiting and neuropathy). We analyzed the distribution of genotypes between patients with or without chemotherapy induced toxicities.

DSBs are repaired through two pathways: homologous recombination (HR) and error-prone non-homologous end joining (NHEJ), which repair DSBs generated during the S-phase and outside the S-phase of the cell cycle respectively 17 . PARP1 is involved in both HR and NHEJ pathways 18, 19 .

Till now, there is no report about polymorphisms investigated in our study and prognosis of breast cancer. However, the expression level of PARP1 has been reported to be associated with the survival of breast cancer patients, but the results are inconsistent. Rojo et al. found that nuclear PARP-1 is overexpressed during the malignant transformation of the breast, particularly in triple-negative tumors, and independently predicts poor prognosis in operable invasive breast cancer 20 . Donizy et al. reported that nuclear-cytoplasm expression (NCE) of PARP-1 was associated with unfavorable prognosis in lymph node negative early breast cancer 21 . While in Aiad's study, the authors demonstrated that PARP-1 immunohistochemical expression is a marker of good prognosis in locally advanced breast cancer 22 . A meta-analysis included 3506 patients from eight studies, the results indicated that higher PARP expression indicated a worse clinical outcome in early stage breast cancer, with a HR of 3.08 (95% CI, 1.14 \u00b1 8.29, P = 0.03) for disease-free survival and a HR of 1.82 (95% CI, 1.20 \u00b1 2.76; P = 0.005) for overall survival 23 . But in locally advanced breast cancer, the authors observed no association between PARP expression level and survival 23 . The results from above studies suggested that PARP1 protein might be a stronger prognostic marker in early stage patients.

            "text": "PARP1 was also related to sensitivity of some chemotherapeutic agents. Minckwitz et al. found that high cPARP expression predicted high sensitivity to neoadjuvant taxane/anthracycline-based chemotherapy 24 . Zhai et al. found that higher nuclear PARP1 expression correlated with increased in vitro chemosensitivity against docetaxel and epirubicin but not cisplatin and vinorelbine 14 . In their study, patients with high nPARP1 expression were more sensitive to anthracycline/taxane based neoadjuvant chemotherapy and with higher pathologic responses 14 . Results from Egyptian researchers also demonstrated that PARP1 immunohistochemical expression is predictive of response to anthracycline/taxane based neoadjuvant chemotherapy in locally advanced breast cancer patients 22 . As PARP1 involves in repairing DNA double-strand breaks, it is easy for us to understand its influence on sensitivity of agents which cause DNA damage, such as anthracyclines. While PARP1 may also lead to an intrinsic cell death program (PARP1-dependent cell death) 25 , which might explain its effect on the sensitivity of other drugs, such as taxanes.",

            "text": "Polymorphisms in PARP1 have been reported to be associated with the risk of several kinds of cancers. In one meta-analysis, the authors found that rs1136410 may be involved in cancer development at least in some ethnic groups (Asian) or some specific cancer types (gastric, cervical, and lung cancers, and glioma) 26 . Alanazi et al. confirmed that rs1136410 was associated with risk of breast cancer in Saudi population 27 . Rs1136410 is the mostly investigated polymorphism in PARP1 which locates at codon 762 in exon 17. Rs1136410 leads to a valineto-alanine substitution in the catalytic domain and then reduces the activities of PARP1 28 . In vitro enzymatic analysis of PARP1-Ala762 and PARP1-Val762 demonstrated that PARP1-Ala762 displayed 57.2% of the activity of PARP1-Val762 for auto-poly(ADP-ribosyl)ation and 61.9% of the activity of PARP1-Val762 for trans-poly(ADP-ribosyl)ation of histone H1 28 . As expression level of PARP1 protein was proved to predict prognosis and chemotherapy sensitivity in breast cancer patients 20,21 , we assumed that rs1136410 genotypes might www.nature.com/scientificreports www.nature.com/scientificreports/ relate to prognosis of TNBC. But in our study, no significant association was observed. There are some reasons for this result. Firstly, the prognostic value might vary between different ethnic groups. Secondly, the complicated interactions with other polymorphisms could also affect the results. Thirdly, all patients in our study received taxane/anthracycline-based adjuvant chemotherapy, which might compromise the prognostic value of PARP1, since higher PARP1 expression level has been found to predict higher sensitivity of taxanes and anthracyclines 24 . The underlying mechanisms of other SNPs on survival of TNBC are not yet clear and are going to be investigated in our further studies.",
