The clinical presentation of respiratory infections caused by various viral pathogens can be very similar; hence, etiological diagnosis is important [Coiras et al., 2004].

Nucleic acid amplification tests (NAAT) have been developed for classical as well as newly emerging respiratory viruses and have been shown to be more sensitive and time efficient than DFA or culture. However, testing for all respiratory viral targets using individual PCRs is expensive and laborious. A conventional multiplex RT\u2013PCR would be a very useful tool in resource limited settings. Therefore, multiplex PCR methods were developed with the aim of detecting different viruses simultaneously [Coiras et al., 2004; Bellau\u2010Pujol et al., 2005; Kim et al., 2009; Choudhary et al., 2013a].",

The use of specific labeled probes ensures easy interpretation when used in a multiplex format.

The xTAG respiratory virus panel (RVP) fast assay (Luminex Molecular Diagnostics Inc., Toronto, Canada) is a CE marked commercially available kit based on suspension microarray technology and enables the detection of large number of viruses in a single reaction [Krunic et al., 2007; Merante et al., 2007]. RVP fast assay has a simple protocol and shorter turnaround time than the original RVP assay and detects 19 different viruses or subtypes: influenza A (subtype: H1, H3), influenza B, respiratory syncytial virus A (RSV\u2010A), RSV\u2010B, parainfluenza virus 1 (PIV\u20101), PIV\u20102, PIV\u20103, PIV\u20104, human metapneumovirus, coronaviruses 229E, NL63, OC43, HKU1, rhinovirus/enterovirus (RhV/EV), adenovirus, and human bocavirus. Recent studies show that the RVP assay is more sensitive and specific compared with culture and antigen detection [Wong et al., 2009; Gadsby et al., 2010]. However a major disadvantage of RVP fast assay is the cost of the kit and the instrument. In this study, we compared the performance of an in\u2010house developed conventional multiplex RT\u2013PCR, monoplex real time RT\u2013PCR and xTAG RVP fast assay for the detection of multiple respiratory viruses and their subtypes in clinical specimens.",

If the MS2 or lambda controls failed in the RVP fast assay, the test was repeated to obtain a valid result. A one step single tube multiplex RT\u2013PCR was performed according to the xTAG RVP fast assay product insert instructions.

The xTAG\u00ae respiratory virus panel assay is based on suspension microarray technology which enables the detection of a large number of targets in a single reactions [Krunic et al., 2007; Merante et al., 2007]. The RVP fast assay provides a considerable reduction in time and less steps of post PCR manipulation from the first version of the assay [Merante et al., 2007].",

The overall sensitivity was 96.9%, 87.9%, and 68.3% for mRT\u2013PCR, rtRT\u2013PCR, and xTAG\u00ae RVP fast assay respectively. Since bocavirus and adenovirus were not tested by multiplex RT\u2013PCR and real time RT\u2013PCR hence excluded for sensitivity calculation for these tests. In this study, we found that the xTAG\u00ae RVP fast assay is less sensitive than mRT\u2013PCR and rtRT\u2013PCR. The overall RVP fast assay sensitivity was 78.8% reported by Gadsby et. al. [2010], 77.5% for all the targets reported by Pabbaraju et. al. [2011], 87.2% reported by Kim et. al. [2013] while 33% reported by Raymaekers et. al. [2011]. Pabbaraju et. al. [2008] reported RVP assay sensitivity and specificity as 91.2% and 99.7% respectively when their in\u2010house NAATs were considered as a gold standard. In another study, RVP fast assay showed a sensitivity and specificity of 100% and 91% when compared with culture, while MultiCode\u2010PLx showed 89% and 87% and ResPlex II showed 89% and 94%, respectively [Balada\u2010Llasat et al., 2011]. Popowitch et al. [2013] reported sensitivity and specificity for xTAG RVP fast as 84.4% and 99.9% respectively. In the present study, a lower sensitivity of RVP fast assay was observed compared to that reported in other studies. This may be due to the fact that in this study we have compared the RVP fast assay against well standardized and robust molecular assays using clinical samples whereas most of the other studies have compared the RVP fast assay against cultures/ DFA using isolates. Another reason may be the sequence variation in the primer\u2010probe binding regions between viruses circulating in India and other parts of the world.",

The RVP fast v2 assay performed well with Quality Control for Molecular Diagnostic (QCMD) samples which had Ct values lower than 30. However for samples with Ct values higher than 30, a considerable drop in sensitivity was observed. To remedy this, PCR cycles were increased by 3 cycles (extended amplification) to increase sensitivity. The protocol for xTAG RVP fast assay was not modified in the present study since it is a CE marked kit. Considering the entire detection spectrum, the present study detected 62.2% samples positive by mRT\u2013PCR, 56.4% by rtRT\u2013PCR and 44.5% by xTAG\u00ae RVP fast assay. Similar findings have been reported in previous studies using the RVP fast assay [Gadsby et al., 2010; Babady et al., 2012] or the original RVP assay [Mahony et al., 2007; Pabbaraju et al., 2008; Gharabaghi et al., 2011].

Concordance between mRT\u2013PCR and rtRT\u2013PCR for influenza A/H1N1pdm09, influenza B, RSV A and B was 100%. Influenza A samples missed by RVP fast assay had MFI (Median Fluorescent Intensity) values ranging between 150 and 300. The cut off value to consider positive for influenza A target was 300 MFI. It was observed that the discordant results of the RVP negative samples were associated with relatively high Ct values (mean Ct in RT\u2013PCR 34). The limitation of xTAG RVP fast assay was that it does not subtype influenza A into H1N1pdm09 and the kit was not upgraded since the emergence of H1N1pdm09. Upgrading of the xTAG RVP fast assay to accommodate the subtyping of influenza A into H1N1pdm09 virus might increase the diagnostic value of the kit. The lower sensitivity of influenza B was also reported by Pabbaraju et al. [2011] and suggested sequence variation in the hemagglutinin gene of Flu B in the primer binding region. Gharabaghi et. al. [2011] reported influenza B sensitivity 64.9% for RVP fast assay. The sensitivity of RVP fast assay for RSV\u2010A, RSV\u2010B, and PIV\u20103 was 13.3%, 47.3%, and 44.4% respectively. Gharabaghi et. al. [2011] reported RSV\u2010A sensitivity 85.5% and RSV\u2010B 98.3%. Similar reports were published by other groups [Gadsby et al., 2010; Rand et al., 2011; Kim et al., 2013; Popowitch et al., 2013]. Low sensitivity of RSV in RVP assay attributed to the high Ct value in real time RT\u2013PCR and may be due to the genetic variation of the virus. Pabbaraju et. al. [2008] also observed that their discordant RSVs were of low titer as well. The lower sensitivity in RVP fast assay for PIV\u20103 was also reported [Gharabaghi et al., 2011; Babady et al., 2012].",

RVP fast assay and mRT\u2013PCR have combined rhinovirus and enterovirus targets, these viruses clubbed together as RhV/EV to perform sensitivity of the tests. Real time RT\u2013PCR sensitivity for rhinovirus was 66.2%, mRT\u2013PCR and RVP fast assay 87.2% respectively. The reduced sensitivity may be because both mRT\u2013PCR and RVP fast assay detect rhinovirus and enterovirus while rtRT\u2013PCR specifically detected only rhinovirus. Sensitivity of RhV/EV in RVP fast assay was reported 93% by Popowitch et al. [2013], 89.6% by Gadsby et al., [2010]. A total 48 rhinovirus/enterovirus positive samples were sequenced, out of which 42 (87.5%) were confirmed as rhinovirus and six (12.5%) as enterovirus by sequencing. Similar findings were also reported by others [Pabbaraju et al., 2008; Gadsby et al., 2010]. A relatively lower number of specimens were positive for coronaviruses, parainfluenza and metapneumovirus in our sample set. Two coronavirus OC43 positive samples missed by mRT\u2010PCR had Ct values of 33 and 35 in the rtRT\u2010PCR. A significant limitation in the present study was the absence of influenza A (H3N2) to evaluate the kit performance for detection of it. Therefore, a larger number of positive specimens are required in order to fully assess the sensitivity of the RVP fast assay for all targets.",

            "text": "In addition to sensitivity and specificity, ease of use, required time and cost are important factors to consider when choosing a multiplex PCR. Each assay evaluated in this study had advantages and disadvantages. The cost of testing the 18 viruses discussed in the present study for one sample by mRT\u2013PCR, rtRT\u2013PCR and RVP\u2010fast assay was US$ 27, US$ 45, and US$ 92 respectively which include only reagents and consumables. The overall duration of the RVP fast assay was 5 to 6 hr, for real time RT\u2013PCR was 8 to 9 hr and mRT\u2010PCR was 6 to 7 hr. Similar observation for workflow and cost were reported for RVP fast assay by Rand et al. [2011] and Babady et al. [2012]. Luminex xTAG RVP fast assay has the advantage of strict quality control and manufacturing practices which minimizes errors during testing of the samples. Luminex xTAG RVP assay is an open PCR system and post amplification products are manipulated (hybridization), increasing the risk of potential laboratory contamination [Kim et. al., 2013]. mRT\u2013PCR has disadvantage because it requires the visual inspection of products in gel and have a potential for amplicon contamination. Real time RT\u2013PCR offers decreased contamination risk. More technical skill is required to perform xTAG RVP fast assay and rtRT\u2013PCR than mRT\u2013PCR. Limitation of the present study was that we have not tested prospective samples.",
