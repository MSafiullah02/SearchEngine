Older people and those with comorbidities are at increased risk of severe disease and adverse outcomes in both diseases.3, 4 And, as we are discovering for COVID-19, both diseases have considerable social impact\u2014including stigma, discrimination, and isolation\u2014in addition to the economic impact from country productivity losses and catastrophic costs to individuals and households.5\n",

While tuberculosis is a slow pandemic and has accompanied humankind for millennia,6 the coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) that causes COVID-19 is new and spreading rapidly around the world. Tuberculosis has been labelled a pandemic many times over the past three centuries, whereas this is the first COVID-19 pandemic. Children are less severely affected by COVID-19, whereas 1\u00b71 million children had tuberculosis disease in 2018, of whom 200 000 died.1 The vast majority of cases and deaths from tuberculosis occur in low-income and middle-income countries, whereas high-income countries have low rates.1 By contrast, Europe became the second epicentre of COVID-19 after China, which might explain, in part, why COVID-19 can be expected to mobilise more global resources and person-power in a year than tuberculosis has in decades. However, underprepared and vulnerable countries in sub-Saharan Africa and Central and South America might soon see substantial rises in COVID-19 cases and deaths, and concerted, collective action must be taken now to avoid catastrophe.7\n",

Simply put, tuberculosis transmission might rise because of increased respiratory symptoms associated with COVID-19, or decline owing to COVID-19-related self-isolation and quarantine. There is increasing recognition of the millions of people treated for tuberculosis who have residual, long-term lung damage8 who are likely to be at a higher risk of severe disease and death from COVID-19. Because of extreme pressures on health systems, exacerbated by COVID-19, people with tuberculosis are likely to face decreased access to diagnostic and treatment services, which might also result in adverse outcomes.",

COVID-19, like tuberculosis, will almost certainly be associated with the medical poverty trap, in which poorer people have a higher likelihood of infection, disease, and adverse outcomes. Moreover, unemployed populations and informal or so-called zero-hours contract workers will experience further impoverishment, which increases risk of tuberculosis.5\n",

We need to continue to mobilise funding for research for better tuberculosis diagnostics, vaccine development, novel therapeutics, equitable access to care, and innovative social protection interventions for tuberculosis-affected households.5 We should drastically increase and sustain investment in health systems that are responsive to the needs of the poor and resilient to the threat of infections, especially those that are air-borne and require isolation facilities. We need to continue to inform, advocate for, and empower local communities and to lobby governments and policymakers to ensure that tuberculosis, as well as COVID-19, remain high on the global agenda. These two pandemics, one old and one new, remind us of the need to be proactive and long-sighted, to plan ahead, and to not become complacent.",
