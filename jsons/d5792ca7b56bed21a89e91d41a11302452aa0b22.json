Viruses were previously defined by their submicroscopic size, which probably prevented the search for giant viruses, which are visible by light microscopy. Extended studies of giant viruses of amoebae revealed that they have genetic, proteomic and structural complexities that were not thought to exist among viruses and that are comparable to those of bacteria, archaea and small eukaryotes. The giant virus particles contain mRNA and more than 100 proteins, they have gene repertoires that are broader than those of other viruses and, notably, some encode translation components. The infection cycles of giant viruses of amoebae involve virus entry by amoebal phagocytosis and replication in viral factories. In addition, mimiviruses are infected by virophages, defend against them through the mimivirus virophage resistance element (MIMIVIRE) system and have a unique mobilome. Overall, giant viruses of amoebae, including mimiviruses, marseilleviruses, pandoraviruses, pithoviruses, faustoviruses and molliviruses, challenge the definition and classification of viruses, and have increasingly been detected in humans.

            "text": "FIG. 1). Indeed, for years the Acanthamoeba polyphaga mimivirus (APMV) was considered to be an intracellular bacterium of amoebae 1 (BOX 2). In a similar manner, pandoraviruses were thought to be atypical parasites of amoebae 4 . However, the absence of ribosomal DNA from an isolate that was presumed to be a bacterium eventually led to the discovery of APMV 1,2 , and, interestingly, the absence of a ribosome essentially separates giant viruses from the three defined domains of life. The genomic and proteomic analyses of giant viruses revealed that they are more complex than other viruses. Furthermore, giant viruses have several novel biological features, which include the fact that mimiviruses can be infected by parasitic viruses (termed virophages), they can contain mobile DNA elements, (termed transpovirons), and they have a defence mechanism against virophages termed the mimivirus virophage resistance element (MIMIVIRE) 5-7 .Thus, how should giant viruses, which do not have a ribosome but have a level of complexity that is approaching that of numerous bacteria and even eukaryotes with an intracellular growth, be defined 8 (BOX 1; Supplementary information S1 (table))? Furthermore, there is disagreement as to whether the large genomes of giant viruses are a result of smaller viruses acquiring genes or of a genome with cellular ancestry adapting to escape the cell nucleus 2,9-13 . In this Review, we reflect on 13 years of research into giant viruses and detail the advances that have been made in characterizing their genomes, structures and mechanisms of replication, as well as the virophages and mobile elements with which they are associated. We place these findings in the context of the ongoing debate on the evolutionary origin of giant viruses and on the extent of similarity between giant viruses and bacteria and eukaryotic cells.",

The capsid comprises proteins that have a double jelly-roll fold and is icosahedral except at one vertex, which is covered by a unique fivebranch starfish-shaped structure (termed 'stargate') that is devoid of fibres 16 . Beneath the capsid, and surrounded by an inner lipid membrane and fibres, is a spherical lipid bilayer compartment that is ~340 nm in size and contains the genome (with an estimated packing density of ~0.06 nm 3 per bp) and proteins 17, 18 . This nucleocapsid has a large depression that faces the 'stargate' , which creates a cavity and indicates that the nucleocapsid has a fixed position relative to the external capsid. APMV particles contain 114 proteins, which is only 12% of the number of predicted genes (see below), among which 12 are involved in transcription, 5 are involved in DNA topology and repair, 2 are involved in RNA modification, 5 are involved in particle structure and 7 are involved in protein or lipid modifications 19 .",

Several APMV genes are not found in viruses other than giant viruses of amoebae, including those that encode translation factors and aminoacyl tRNA synthetases; some of the genes encoding aminoacyl tRNA synthetases are expressed 21,22 and encode functional proteins 23 . In addition, the APMV genome encodes four different tRNAs 2 . Other genes that are unique to APMV and other giant viruses of amoebae encode proteins that are involved in nucleotide synthesis, amino acid metabolism, protein modification, lipid or polysaccharide metabolism, DNA repair or protein folding 2 .

Viruses were considered as simple entities that relied on a cellular host to replicate, were devoid of machineries for energy production and translation, and consisted of a nucleic acid enclosed in a symmetrical protein shell known as the capsid 112, 113 . In 2003, the discovery of Acanthamoeba polyphaga mimivirus (APMV) challenged this paradigm and caused debates in regard to the definition and classification of viruses 2,8, 55 . Although APMV has many of the phenotypic and genotypic characteristics of viruses, it also shares many features with microorganisms 55 . For example, APMV particles are visible using a light microscope 1 , have larger genomes than small bacteria and contain more diverse genes than other viruses 2 . Moreover, APMV is more complex than other viruses, as its capsid contains two types of nucleic acid -a DNA genome and some mRNAs 2 -as well as 114 proteins 19 . In addition, APMV contains translation factors and aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases (which is unprecedented for a virus), and six tRNAs (tRNA is rarely detected in other double-stranded DNA (dsDNA) viruses) 2 . Furthermore, the mobilome of APMV is more diverse than that of other viruses and includes several self-excising introns and inteins, as well as pro-virophages and transpovirons 5,6 . Finally, unlike many viruses, APMV can enter host cells through phagocytosis that does not require specific viral-host interactions, owing to its large size 76 ; this may mean that APMV has a broad host range.",

Such a phylogeny would suggest an archaic origin that is contemporary to that of proto-eukaryotes 13,52 . As these analyses did not involve ribosomal genes, it was proposed that APMV and the other members of the proposed order Megavirales comprise a fourth 'TRUC' (things resisting uncompleted classification) of microorganisms rather than a fourth domain 3 . Phylogenetic studies that were based on entire repertoires of the structural domains of proteins 51 also suggested that a fourth major branch of the tree of life may exist. However, these claims are controversial and have been contested by arguments that the phylogenies were biased by lateral gene transfer from cellular organisms (mostly eukaryotes) to giant viruses and inappropriate methodologies 10,12,13, 114, 115 .

The first of these was marseillevirus, which was described in 2009 (REF. 41 ). Since 2013, the number and diversity of giant viruses of amoebae have expanded considerably, and, as of 2016, two virus families, the Mimiviridae and Marseilleviridae, have been described 32, 42 figure) ). Since the APMV genome was described, giant viruses of amoebae have been linked, through phylo genomic analyses, to nucleocytoplasmic large DNA viruses (NCLDV), which is a group of dsDNA viruses that was described in 2001 and comprises poxviruses, ascoviruses, iridoviruses, asfarviruses and phycodnaviruses; these viruses infect a wide range of eukaryotic cells, from algae to insects and mammals 2,47,48 . In 2009, it was noted that giant viruses of amoebae and NCLDVs share a small subset of nine core genes, five of which are found in all of their genomes (these encode a major capsid protein, a D5 helicase, a family B DNA polymerase, an A32-like packaging ATPase and a very late transcription factor), and a larger subset of ~200 genes are shared by at least two NCLDV families 48, 49 . Moreover, giant viruses of amoebae and NCLDVs were described to have a common ancestor, the genome of which is thought to contain ~50 conserved genes that are likely, based on phylogenomic analyses, to have an early origin that is possibly concomitant with eukaryogenesis [48] [49] [50] [51] [52] . In 2012, it was proposed that giant viruses of amoebae and NCLDV families should be classified into a new viral order, the Megavirales, on the basis of their common origin, which was suggested by the fact that they share a large set of ancestral genes that encode key viral functions, a common virus particle architecture and major biological features, including replication that occurs inside cytoplasmic factories 53 . Nevertheless, the architecture of pandoraviruses, Pithovirus sibericum and M. sibericum (see below) differs considerably from that of other giant viruses of amoebae and no capsidresembling structure, or even gene for pandoraviruses, was detected in these viruses, which, together with poxviruses and ascoviruses that have brick-shaped virus particles and allantoid capsids, respectively, challenges the criteria that are used to classify viruses in the proposed order Megavirales 43, 44, 46, 53 .",

Contrary to all other DNA viruses, the faustovirus prototype isolate has a double protein shell to encapsidate, with an outer shell that is composed of a double jelly-roll protein and is similar to that of many double-stranded DNA viruses (including giant viruses of amoebae), and an inner shell that is composed of a repeated hexameric unit, the structure of which differs from that of known capsid proteins. In addition, the major capsid protein of the outer shell is encoded by a 17,000 bp genomic fragment that contains several introns and exons 68 . Pandoraviruses, pitho viruses and M. sibericum exhibit different morphologies to other giant viruses of amoebae; virus particles have ovoid or spherical (in the case of M. sibericum) shapes 43, 44, 46 . In addition, pandoraviruses and pitho viruses are larger than mimiviruses and all other giant viruses of amoebae. Pandoravirus and pithovirus particles have a wall that is 60-70 nm thick and an apical pore at one of their extremities, which enables the internal virus components to be delivered into the amoebal cytoplasm and has the appearance of a honeycomb grid in pithoviruses 43, 44 .

In addition, these genomes all have a substantial level of mosaicism; this is well exemplified by marseillevirus 41 . This suggests that many genes were transferred laterally between themselves and other viruses and cellular organisms. Among examples of particular features in the genomes of giant viruses of amoebae, it should be mentioned that the genomes of marseilleviruses encode histone-like proteins 41, 69 ; the genes in pandoraviruses frequently include spliceosomal introns 43 and the genome of Pandoravirus salinus contains particular transposons that were termed miniature inverted-repeat transposable elements 70 ; and the genomes of faustoviruses encode membrane occupation and recognition nexus (MORN)repeat-containing proteins, similar to marseilleviruses and pandoraviruses 44 . In the faustovirus prototype isolate it was found that the capsid protein is encoded by a ~17,000 bp large genomic region with several exons and introns, which was most unexpected 45, 68 . Of note, it has been hypothesized that giant virus genomes may evolve through a complex accordion-like process, with successive steps of genome expansions through duplications and gene transfers followed by genome reduction 71 . Hence, the genomes of giant viruses of amoebae both exhibit features that are shared between some or all giant viruses of amoebae and others that are particular to each family or putative family.",

Amoebae are host cells for Legionella spp., and, during the 1980s and 1990s, Rowbotham assembled a large collection of amoeba-associated bacteria from environmental water samples that were gathered as part of investigations into outbreaks of Legionnaires' disease. These bacteria were mostly strict intracellular Legionella spp. 104,120 , but two isolates were unidentified and, by their morphology, seemed to be small Gram-positive coccoid bacteria 121 . In 1995, Birtles brought this collection to the laboratory of D. Raoult with the objective of characterizing the two unidentified isolates by 16S ribosomal DNA (rDNA) amplification and sequencing. All attempts to amplify the isolate that became known as the 'Bradford coccus' were unsuccessful and, as an alternative strategy, the ultrastructure of this isolate was studied by electron microscopy 1 . Unexpectedly, the electron micrographs showed that the coccoid 'bacterium' in infected amoebae consisted of very regular icosahedral forms that resembled a giant iridovirus. Additional observations suggested that, despite its large diameter of ~600 nm, the Bradford coccus was in fact a virus, as the isolate exhibited eclipse-phase replication, which is typical of viruses, the production of virus particles into 'virus factories' and contained a large double-stranded DNA (dsDNA) chromosome that, according to preliminary genome analyses, belonged to the group of viruses that are known as nucleocytoplasmic large DNA viruses (NCLDVs) 47 . These studies revealed that the Bradford coccus was a virus, and it was subsequently renamed 'mimivirus', with an etymology that is based both on the concept of 'mimicking a microorganism' and on a childhood recollection of stories of 'Mimi the amoeba'. considering that it has the largest particle size (~1.5 \u03bcm in length and 0.5 \u03bcm in diameter) among giant viruses of amoebae 44 . Moreover, its coding density is only 68%, owing to a considerable number of ~150-nm-long regularly interspersed palindromic sequences that are distributed in tandem repeats within arrays that are ~2,000 bp long. Although P. sibericum morphologically resembles pandoraviruses, it is most closely related to marseilleviruses and iridoviruses based on phylo genetic analyses. A total of 159 proteins were identified in purified virus particles, of which two-thirds and the four most abundant have unknown functions 44 . The genome of M. sibericum is 651,523 bp in size, with inverted repeats approximately 10,000 bp long at its extremities, and, similar to pandoraviruses, is GC rich (60%) 46 .",

In addition, a homologue of the major capsid protein in members of the proposed order Megavirales is translated, although it is apparently not involved in the structure of the virus particle 46 . Another pithovirus, named Pithovirus massiliensis, was recently isolated from sewage in southern France and was compared with its fossil counterpart 72 . This analysis indicated that the genomic content of pitho viruses evolves slowly, as it was conserved after thousands of years, with selective pressure on the conserved genes. This suggests that the mechanisms of evolution are comparable in giant viruses and bacteria, and include selection, gene fixation and then selective constraints. This enabled the first estimation of a molecular clock in giant viruses, and the mutation rate that was estimated based on the dN/dS ratio was 2 \u00d7 10 -6 substitutions per site per year, which is lower than that of RNA viruses and is very similar to that estimated for poxviruses (0.5-7 \u00d7 10 -6 substitutions per site per year) 73 and in the same order of magnitude as those found in bacteria and archaea 72 . Second, this showed that genes that were thought to be horizontally acquired were selected and highly conserved, which indicates that they are essential genes. The GC content and codon usage of these genes tend to adapt progressively to that of the recipient genome 72 . In light of these results, pitho viruses can select for genes that are acquired by horizontal gene transfer, followed by their long-term fixation and adaptation to viral codon usage. Third, orphans that are highly abundant in pithoviruses 44, 72 were also constrained by strong selective pressure, which indicates that their accumulation is not random and is biologically relevant. These findings do not support the hypothesis that giant viruses are 'bags' of genes and pseudogenes that have been randomly taken from cellular organisms and not used, but rather indicate that horizontally acquired genes and orphan genes are functional and biologically active. Similar findings were reported previously for two marseilleviruses that were isolated in south-eastern France and Australia 74 .",

Furthermore, whereas the use of Acanthamoeba polyphaga as an amoebal host for culture only enabled the isolation of mimiviruses and marseilleviruses, the culture of A. castellanii led to the isolation of Pandoravirus spp. 43 , Pithovirus sibericum 44 and Mollivirus sibericum 46 . This shows that A. polyphaga is less permissive to infection by several giant viruses of amoebae as a support for culture than A. castellanii. Changing the amoebal host was especially fruitful in the isolation of several faustoviruses 45 , which form a new putative family of giant viruses that are specific to the host Vermamoeba vermiformis 117 . However, each host must be adapted to a liquid medium that enables minimal survival before the multiplication of viruses. For example, the quick encystment of V. vermiformis and its inability to survive in Page's amoeba saline (PAS) prevented its use as a host for the isolation of giant viruses, although this limitation could be circumvented by using a starvation medium in which this host could survive for culture 45 .",

The virus internal layer seems to originate from multivesicular membrane structures that bud from the endoplasmic reticulum and become open membrane sheets; the major capsid protein is assembled around these sheets while acting as a scaffold 78 . Genome packaging occurs through a transient aperture that is distinct from the 'stargate' (REF. 78 ). Finally, the layer of fibres is assembled. The involvement of the amoebal nucleus in the life cycle of APMV has been debated 56, 57, 75 . Indeed, the size of the amoebal nucleus decreases approximately twofold during APMV replication, even though this process occurs in a viral factory in the cytoplasm; amoebal nuclear factors may be involved. In marseilleviruses, the replication cycle lasts about 6-16 h (REFS 41, 69) (FIG. 3) . The cell nucleus undergoes transient morphological changes during early stages of the replication cycle, and marseillevirus viral factories tend to have a more extensive distribution in the cytoplasm than APMV viral factories. Marseilleviruses can form giant vesicles, comprised of dozens of virus particles, that are wrapped by membranes derived from the amoebal endoplasmic reticulum 79 . The viruses can be released outside of the amoeba within these giant vesicles; this may cause the amoeba to undergo phagocytosis through an acidification-independent process 79 . In addition, single marseillevirus particles may enter Acanthamoeba spp. through an endosome-stimulated pathway or may group together to trigger their own phagocytic uptake 79 .",

Acanthamoeba spp. or V. vermiformis can protect giant viruses against physical and chemical threats, as they are highly stable organisms that can become encysted 80 . In addition, APMV particles were stable for 9 months in environmental freshwater, saline water and hospital ventilator devices 81 , and resisted antibiotics, 48 h of desiccation, and several chemical biocides, including alcohols 82 . Finally, the phagocytosis-like entry process of giant viruses contrasts with the need of specific interactions for other viruses to enter their host and could enable giant viruses to infect a broader range of hosts. Although amoebae are the primary hosts of giant viruses, mimiviruses and marseilleviruses have been detected in oysters, insects, monkeys, cattle and humans [83] [84] [85] . Moreover, APMV can enter various human myeloid cells and replicate in peripheral blood mononuclear cells 76, 86 , and marseillevirus can cause a productive infection in human T lymphocyte cells 87 . In addition, the virus factories in which these giant viruses replicate were described for other viruses, including members of the proposed order Megavirales that are not discussed here, other DNA viruses (including herpesviruses) and some RNA viruses (such as flaviviruses or coronaviruses) 88 . These factories are replication organelles that recruit viral and cellular components for virus assembly and maturation. Viral factories were considered as the nuclei of 'virocells' (that is, cells infected by a virus, the aim of which is to produce virions), which would themselves correspond to the cellular forms of viruses when not strictly assimilated into a virus particle (or virion) 26 . In the case of APMV and other giant viruses of amoebae, if the virocell is the infected amoeba, the giant viral factory can be considered as its nucleus. This view is connected to two evolutionary scenarios: viral eukaryogenesis 13 , in which the eukaryotic nucleus originated from the viral factory of an ancient giant virus 26 , and nuclear viriogenesis, in which some giant viruses originated from the nucleus of ancient proto-eukaryotic cells 89 .",

Specifically, the ability of mamavirus to lyse amoebae was decreased and mamavirus particles with abnormal morphologies were observed. So far, three Sputnik-like virophages, namely Sputnik2, Sputnik 3 and Rio Negro virophage, have been isolated, and they all infect lineage A, lineage B and lineage C of the Mimiviridae 92-94 . A divergent virophage that is associated with mimiviruses of Acanthamoeba spp., named Zamilon, was also isolated 95 . Another virophage, named Mavirus, depends on Cafeteria roenbergensis virus for its replication and was the second virophage to be discovered after Sputnik 96 . The study of virophage diversity is still in its infancy, and several studies suggest that virophages are common and especially abundant in the oceans. For example, virophages were identified in the genome of the marine alga Bigelowiella natans 97 , and virophage genomes were assembled from metagenomic datasets 98 . Virophages that infect mimiviruses have been recently classified in the family Lavidaviridae 91 . This classification highlights that, as suggested by their particle and genome size, virophages are similar in complexity to genuine dsDNA viruses, and they share a set of six core genes that strongly suggests their monophyletic origin. In addition, the promoter and transcription termination signals of mimivirus virophages are similar to those of mimiviruses, which suggests that these virophages rely on their associated giant virus for mRNA synthesis 99 .",

The search for a system that would explain this resistance was inspired by an analogy to the CRISPR-Cas system, which is widely present in bacteria and archaea and relies on the integration of short DNA sequences from invaders 7,100 . The resistant lineage A isolates indeed have an insertion of four 15-nucleotide-long repeated Zamilon virophage sequences within an operon, named the MIMIVIRE, the resistance mechanism of which was suggested to rely on the sequence-specific recognition of a nucleic acid sequence 7 . The probability of finding such a sequence in this single mimivirus lineage by chance was very low (<1 \u00d7 10 -9 ). MIMIVIRE-associated genes encode a helicase and nuclease that are involved in the degradation of foreign nucleic acids 101 and the functions of which were experimentally validated 7 ; MIMIVIRE also includes a gene that contains the repeated insert. Silencing each of these three genes by RNA interference restored the susceptibility of mimivirus to the Zamilon virophage. However, the exact molecular mechanism of MIMIVIRE is unclear. The MIMIVIRE system is thought to differ from CRISPR-Cas systems owing to the absence of a Cas1 homologue, of protospacer-adjacent motifs and of a well-conserved organization that includes bona fide CRISPR-like repeats 100, 102 . Furthermore, the helicase and nuclease that are described in this MIMIVIRE system are only distantly related to proteins that are classified in the same superfamilies as Cas3 and Cas4 proteins, and they do not seem to be related to them 100 . An alternative mechanism to explain the resistance of mimivirus to virophages is one that would rely on interactions between proteins, rather than on nucleic acid-based recognition, and would involve a restriction factor protein of the virophage replication machinery 102 .",

Thus, a substantial proportion of genes in the genomes of mimiviruses and other giant viruses are predicted to have been exchanged with bacteria, archaea, eukaryotes (including their amoebal hosts) and other viruses, although the direction of putative transfers is often unclear 26, 103 . This high level of genome mosaicism might be related to the co-infection of amoebae by giant viruses and microorganisms, such as bacteria or fungi 41, 103 . Indeed, giant viruses can multiply within amoebae that are infected with other microorganisms, which provides opportunities for horizontal gene transfer. Acanthamoeba spp. are well-known hosts for several bacteria and some fungi, in addition to viruses 104 . Acanthamoeba spp. that were isolated from a contact lens cleaning liquid were found to be co-infected with a mimivirus and two bacteria 93 , and Acanthamoeba spp. have been observed experimentally to be co-infected with marseillevirus and two bacteria 41 . In addition, the fact that, in their natural environment, giant viruses are sympatric with other microorganisms that infect Acanthamoeba helps to explain the large size of their genomes, which accumulate genes that increase their fitness against other microorganisms that replicate in amoebae 103, 105 . Interestingly, a 16% decrease in genome size was observed by co-culturing APMV in amoebae in the absence of other microorganisms 105 ; it was determined that the APMV genes that were inactivated were primarily those with the lowest expression, which suggests the loss of obsolete genes 106 . Moreover, these gene losses were associated with the loss of the external fibres that cover the APMV capsid and a decreased rate of replication 105 .",

They have virus particles that are as large as some microorganisms and have a stunning level of complexity. Their genomes are mosaic and contain large repertoires of genes, some of which are hallmarks of cellular organisms, although the majority have unknown functions. These giant viruses enter amoebae through phagocytosis and replicate inside viral factories. In addition, as shown for mimiviruses, they are associated with a specific mobilome and are parasitized by viruses that they can defend against. Giant viruses not only challenge the classification of viruses but also raise intriguing questions about their origin. They extend the definition of viruses into a broader range of biological entities, some of which are very simple and others of which have a complexity comparable to that of other microorganisms.",

The role that giant viruses of amoebae have in evolution also warrants further attention. Several hypotheses on their ancient origin and their evolutionary relationship with cellular organisms have been proposed, and these topics should continue to be debated. In these viruses, it will be important to search for a translation system that does not involve ribosomes, and/or that is anterior to the ribosome and of which we would find remnants. Finally, the detection of giant viruses of amoebae in humans and the study of their potential pathogenicity are emerging fields 107 . To date, giant viruses of amoebae that have been linked to humans were discovered before 2013 (BOX 4) . Mimiviruses were associated with pneumonia 108,109 , whereas marseillevirus was detected in the blood and the lymphoid tissue, and was associated with adenitis and lymphoma 110, 111 . More systematic investigations of human samples for giant viruses of amoebae must be conducted; such research is more accessible to the next generation of virologists who have entered the field after the description of APMV, and will surely reveal more giant viruses and refine their definition for years to come.",

Mimiviruses have been detected in serological, molecular and culture studies of patients with pneumonia 107 ; serological studies were almost exclusively conducted in our laboratory, although some of the sera samples were collected by other laboratories 61, 107 . Serological evidence notably included seroconversion to Acanthamoeba polyphaga mimivirus (APMV) in patients with unexplained pneumonia, including in a laboratory technician who manipulated large quantities of APMV 108 . In addition, two febrile Laotian patients were seropositive for the mimivirus virophage 122 . In culture studies, a mimivirus was isolated from two Tunisian patients who had pneumonia; in one case it was isolated from bronchoalveolar fluid 107, 109 . As recently reviewed (see REFS. 61, 107) , several studies have failed to detect APMV DNA in respiratory samples from patients with pneumonia and only three cases were positive for APMV DNA when samples were analysed by PCR 123, 109, 124 . This may indicate that APMV is only rarely associated with pneumonia. Alternatively, this may be the consequence of considerable genetic diversity in mimiviruses, which may have prevented their detection by PCR in these studies 125 . Finally, mice that were inoculated intracardially with APMV developed pneumonia lesions 126 , and APMV can enter, and replicate in, human monocytes, macrophages 76 and peripheral blood mononuclear cells 86 , although the virus was not propagated using these human blood cells.",

However, the detection of marseillevirus in human blood is controversial, as two other studies failed to detect marseillevirus DNA in blood from polytransfused patients in Paris and Cameroon and in blood from blood donors in southern France, Paris, the United States and Burkina Faso 129, 130 . By contrast, positive serologies for Lausannevirus, which is a marseillevirus, were detected in young healthy adults in Switzerland (immunoglobulin G (IgG), 1.7-2.5%) 127 . In 2013, a high antibody titre to marseillevirus was reported in an 11-month-old child who presented with symptoms of lymphadenitis; marseillevirus was also detected by FISH and immunohistochemistry in a lymph node of this individual, and by PCR in the serum 110 . Next, marseillevirus was detected in a lymph node of a 30-year-old woman who was diagnosed with Hodgkin lymphoma by PCR, FISH, immunofluorescence and immunohistochemistry, concurrently, with specific antibodies 111 . Finally, marseillevirus was detected twice, with a one-year interval, by PCR in the pharynx of a patient with neurological disorders and once in the blood 128 . Very few data are available for the infection of humans by giant viruses that have only recently been described, but sequences that might belong to these giant viruses, including pithoviruses, pandoraviruses, faustoviruses, as well as to mimiviruses, marseilleviruses and virophages, have been identified in metagenomes that were generated from human samples 61 ",
