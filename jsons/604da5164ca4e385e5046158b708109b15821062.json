The 'D' (deaths) model comes from a simplified version of the SIR (susceptibleinfected-recovered) model known as SI model. It assumes that there is no recovery. In that case the dynamical equations can be solved analytically and the result is extended to describe the D-function that depends on three parameters that we can fit to the data. Results for the data from Spain, Italy and China are presented. The model is validated by comparing with the data of deaths in China, which are well described. This allows to make predictions for the development of the disease in Spain and Italy.",

The system is reduced to two coupled differential equations, which does not possess an explicit formula solution, but can be solved numerically. The SIR model is usually parametrized using actual infection data and the solution of the I(t) function can be compared with actual infection data, to predict the evolution of the disease. In this paper we make drastic assumptions in order to obtain an analytical formula to describe the evolution of deaths by corona virus. This can be useful as a fast method to foresee the global behavior as a first approach before applying more sophisticated methods. We shall see that the resulting 'D' (deaths) model, that derivates from the SI model (no recovery), and is extended to deaths, describes well enough the data of the current corona virus pandemic in the countries China, Spain and Italy, where the pandemic is stronger.",
