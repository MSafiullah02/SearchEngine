She had a history of diabetes mellitus and arterial hypertension. Her family confirmed previous contact with patients positive for SARS-CoV-2. Clinical examination in our Internal Medicine ('Clinica Medica') department revealed the patient had bilateral crackles in both lungs. She was stable haemodynamically. Arterial blood gas (ABG) analysis, blood tests and a chest x-ray were carried out. The ABG results showed mild hypoxemic hypocapnic respiratory failure, the chest x-ray showed bilateral signs of interstitial pneumonia (Fig. 1) , and the blood tests showed lymphocytopenia, and an elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate (42 mm), C-reactive protein (138 mg/l) and lactate dehydrogenase (471 U/l). Platelets were low (54 000/mm 3 ) as was procalcitonin. These findings together with the history suggested the diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 infection.",

In light of the bilateral pneumonia and lymphocytopenia, the patient was also investigated for antibodies against cytomegalovirus (CMV): results showed high IgG (>180 U/ml) and IgM (38.7 U/ml) levels, indicating recent and likely active infection. An infectious disease specialist was consulted and prescribed empirical therapy with lopinavir/ritonavir 200 mg twice a day plus hydroxychloroquine 200 mg twice a day. Bronchoscopy to obtain bronchoalveolar lavage for molecular diagnosis was not possible because of the patient's unstable condition. Unfortunately, she died 6 days after admission due to severe respiratory failure in the clinical context of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS).",

Unfortunately, she developed ARDS and died from severe respiratory failure. To our knowledge, this is first reported case of coinfection with SARS-CoV-2 and CMV. Our team have previously often found lymphocytopenia in other cases of CMV infection and reactivation, particularly in patients who had been given biological drugs. This merits investigation, as the literature [3] suggests a link between SARS-CoV-2 and CMV infection/reactivation caused by the increasingly widespread use of anti-IL-6 and anti-IL-1 biological therapies in COVID-19.",
