In addition, newer stimuli, for example, the pro-inflammatory cytokine, IL-17, which induces IL-8 synthesis (see [2]), IL-18, which primes neutrophil functions [3], or IL-25, a novel Th2 cytokine that upregulates cytokine and chemokine expression from eosinophils [4], are continually being described (Box 1). However viruses and bacteria, as the causative agents of pulmonary diseases, along with their products, also activate the p38 MAPK and are increasingly coming to light as principal causes of exacerbations in asthma and COPD [2, 5].",

            "text": "Thus respiratory viral infections, for example, human rhinovirus (HRV) and respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), upregulate the expression of multiple cytokines (IL-1, TNF\u03b1, IL-6, G-CSF, GM-CSF) and chemokines (IL-8, ENA-78, GRO\u03b1, RANTES) in epithelial cells, as well as ICAM-1 in endothelial cells, via the p38 MAPK pathway [5, 6, 7, 8]. Activation of p38 MAPK by influenza virus (IV), including the H5N1 \u2018bird flu\u2019 strain, suggests a similar induction of cytokines and chemokines [9]. These effects are likely to be mediated via the MAP3K, apoptosis signal-regulating kinase (ASK) 1, which is also responsible for IV-induced apoptotic cell death [10]. Furthermore, the finding that double stranded RNA (dsRNA), which acts via the dsRNA-dependent protein kinase (PKR) and mimics responses to many RNA viruses including RSV, HRV and IV, suggests that these are general responses to viral infection [5]. In addition, HRV infection of alveolar macrophage and monocytic cells leads to p38 and activating transcription factor (ATF)-2 phosphoryation as well as the induction of MCP-1 expression [11]. Therefore, despite not affecting HRV replication, IV infection, or IV and severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) viral protein synthesis, these data indicate the therapeutic potential of targeting p38 MAPK in epithelial and macrophage cells in the context of virus-induced inflammation and apoptosis [6, 9, 10, 12].",

Numerous other bacterial pathogens also induce pulmonary inflammatory responses via p38 MAPK. For example, Burkholderia pseudomallei, the causative agent of melioidosis, activates p38 MAPK and this appears necessary for epithelial cell invasion [14]. Burkholderia cenocepacia, a pathogen that causes fatal pulmonary disease in the immunocompromised and CF sufferers, induces expression of the bradykinin B1 kinnin receptor, and presumably other inflammatory mediators, via a p38-dependent mechanism in fibroblasts [15]. Likewise, Streptococcus pneumoniae, the predominant cause of community-acquired pneumonia, and a major cause of death by infectious disease in industrialised countries, induces IL-8 expression via the p38 pathway [16]. This is also true for cell fractions and lipopeptide, from nontypeable Haemophilus influenzae, which is a major cause of COPD exacerbation [17].",

            "text": "The characterisation of cytokine-suppressive anti-inflammatory drugs (CSAIDs) (p38 inhibitors) revealed inhibition of cytokine biosynthesis via post-transcriptional and translational mechanisms [1, 2]. This involved the downstream kinase, MAPK activated protein kinase 2 (MAPKAP-K2) and is particularly relevant for genes, such as TNF\u03b1, that contain AREs in their 3\u2032UTRs (Table 3\n) [24]. Indeed, many inflammatory genes contain one or more ARE (Table 3), and p38-dependent mRNA stabilisation therefore regulates inflammatory and virally induced gene expression [7, 24]. Despite the identification of numerous ARE-binding proteins (ARE-BPs) [25] (Fig. 2\n), there is considerable uncertainty as to targets of the p38 pathway [26]. This is being said, that binding of heterogenous nuclear ribonuclear protein (hnRNP) A0 to the TNF\u03b1, COX-2 and MIP-2 3\u2032UTRs is MAPKAP-K2-dependent, blocked by the p38 inhibitor, SB203580, and correlates with mRNA stability [25]. Similarly, binding of hnRNP A1 to the TNF\u03b1 ARE increases following phosphorylation by MNK [27], kinases which are also implicated in translation via phosphorylation of the eukaryotic initiation factor 4E (eIF4E) (see[2, 24]) (Fig. 2). Furthermore, Mnk knock-down, or pharmacological inhibition, reduces TNF\u03b1 expression and supports a role for this pathway [27]. Further complexity is introduced as p38-dependent stabilisation of certain ARE-containing mRNAs (e.g. COX-2, TNF\u03b1) occurs via blocking deadenylation [28] to promote both mRNA stability and translation which are themselves coupled to poly-A tail length (Fig. 2). Thus poly-A tail shortening reduces translation efficiency, precedes mRNA degradation and can be targeted by the p38 MAPK to regulate inflammatory gene expression [24, 28] (Fig. 2).",

This acute phase gene is induced by pro-inflammatory stimuli and provides negative-feedback control [24]. Therefore, the inhibition of pro-inflammatory pathways could, by preventing TTP expression, stabilise and enhance the expression of ARE containing genes. In this context, the p38 pathway, acting via MAPKAP-K2 and the TTP ARE, stabilises TTP mRNA and p38 inhibition profoundly reduces TTP expression [31].

Neutrophil influx is usually a hallmark of obliterative bronchiolitis following lung transplantation and using an in vivo rat model, a p38 inhibitor was shown to dramatically reduce inflammatory cytokines, tracheal occlusion and organ rejection [33]. This is consistent with data from LPS-challenged mice in which TNF\u03b1 production was reduced by SB239063, a potent second-generation p38 inhibitor ([2] and see refs therein). Likewise in an ovalbumin (OVA) sensitisation and challenge mouse model, a p38 inhibitor again prevented neutrophil increases in the bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) fluid [34]. Interestingly, whilst increased cytokine levels (for IL-4, -5, -12, -13 or interferon-\u03b3) and goblet cell hyperplasia were unaffected, mice treated with p38 inhibitor revealed significantly decreased airways hyperreactivity (AHR) [34]. Similarly, OVA-induced eosinophilic inflammation in both mice and guinea pigs was also prevented by SB239063 (see [2]). This compound reduced LTD4-induced eosinophilia and promoted eosinophil apoptosis suggesting a beneficial effect in eosinophilic diseases, such as asthma. This conclusion also receives support from an OVA-induced mouse asthma model in which antisense oligonucleotides to p38 MAPK prevented pulmonary eosinophilia, AHR and mucus hypersecretion [35]. In addition, lung oedema is frequently associated with disease. This is promoted by the down-regulation of the epithelial sodium channel, ENaC\u03b1, to reduce water and ion transport into the tissues. As this process requires p38 MAPK, p38 inhibitors could aid the control of lung oedema [36].",

            "text": "In terms of infection and disease exacerbation, epithelial cells from COPD patients show enhanced, as well as additional (versus non-COPD patient), p38 MAPK-dependent inflammatory responses to H. influenzae [37]. Likewise CF tissues showed enhanced responses to Pseudomonas aeruginosa LPS via increased IL-8 release and neutrophil migration and therefore suggest a benefit from p38 inhibition in CF inflammation [38]. One possible worry in respect of p38 inhibition in infection relates to the ability of DNA containing unmethylated CpG, as occurs in the context of bacterial infection, to induce strong Th1-type immune responses and reduce the development of Th2 allergic asthma in a mouse model [39]. This effect, which might be a part of immunological education, requires the p38-dependent release of the pro-Th1 cytokine, IL-12, from alveolar macrophage. Thus the use of p38 inhibitors to combat inflammation in infection could subsequently enhance the development of allergic disease. Another, frequently fatal disease with relatively rapid onset is idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF). This is poorly responsive to current treatments and is characterised by irreversible lung fibrosis, which is now reported to involve the p38 MAPK [40]. Given a role of p38 MAPK in the expression of growth factors and fibroblast functions [2], it is possible that p38 inhibition may prove to be of therapeutic benefit.",

            "text": "The above examples reveal a critical role of the p38 MAPK in regulating inflammatory gene expression and suggest a key role in pulmonary disease. These effects occur by various transcriptional, post-transcriptional and translational mechanisms and the data presented supports the potential use of p38 inhibitors in controlling inflammatory responses. The fact that anti-inflammatory glucocorticoids target the p38 pathway, via the induction of MKP-1, supports the pharmacological rationale for targeting p38 MAPK in inflammation. Furthermore, the finding that the p38 MAPK targets GR to reduce responsiveness raises the possibility that p38 inhibitors could be used, not only in their own right as anti-inflammatory agents, but also in conjunction with glucocorticosteroids to improve patient sensitivity to these compounds. This effect could be particularly valuable in the context of steroid resistant or insensitive patients who often remain poorly controlled, if at all, and require high dose oral corticosteroids. In this context, disease progression in COPD is poorly responsive to glucoccorticosteroids and pathogenesis involves the neutrophil. As p38 inhibitors appear effective at targeting neutrophil functions and many COPD triggers, for example cigarette smoke or particulates, promote neutrophil recruitment via the p38 pathway, inhibitors of the p38 pathway may show benefit in this disease. In addition, both viral and bacterial inflections are potent inducers of the p38 MAPK and lead to significant health issues both arising directly from infectious disease as well as from the exacerbation of conditions such as asthma or COPD. Thus in situations where the underlying infection is controllable by other means, such as antibiotics or anti-virals, it is possible that p38 inhibition may be appropriate to deal solely with the resultant inflammatory response. Notwithstanding this positive outlook, it is to be noted that p38-dependent processes also take a significant role in feedback inhibition of inflammatory genes via the expression and activation of TTP. Removal of these control processes could tend to increase inflammatory gene expression. Thus the balance between these positive and negative effects can be stimulus- and gene-specific and will only become apparent following further studies. In addition, whilst there is some evidence that infection, for example of B. pseudomallei, might require p38 MAPK, this is less certain in respect of other infectious agents and this issue still requires specific testing. Furthermore, the finding that TLR2 expression and signalling is enhanced by p38 inhibition, as a result of loss of feedback control, raises the possibility that p38 inhibitors can only be effective in the context of certain (non-TLR2-dependent) infections. Finally, loss of SOCS3 and IL-12 expression could both lead to enhanced Th2-dependent inflammatory responses and can, in time, lead to the development of elevated allergic reactions. In conclusion, these data, indicate a clear ability of p38 inhibitors to target inflammation, but certain questions remain as to potentially undesirable events that could limit the clinical utility of such compounds.  \n",

Various stimuli, stresses or other insults acting on the cell may cause activation of p38 MAPK isoforms through the sequential activation of the MAP kinase kinase kinases (MAP3K), which phosphorylate and activate the MAP kinase kinases (MAP2K). These in turn phosphorylate the p38 MAPKs, which on activation, are able to phosphorylate several targets including downstream kinases as well as other effectors. ARE, AU response element; ASK1, apoptosis signal-regulating kinase 1; ATF, activating transcription factor; CHOP, CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein (C/EBP) homologous protein; cPLA2, cytosolic phospholipase A2; CREB, cyclic AMP response element binding protein; eIF4E, eukaryotic initiation factor 4E; HMG-14, high mobility group 14; hsp27, heat shock protein 27; MAPK, mitogen-activated protein kinase; MAP2K, mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase; MAP3K, mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase kinase; MAPKAP-K (or MK), MAPK-activated protein kinase; MEF2C, myocyte-specific enhancer binding factor 2C; MEKK, mitogen-activated protein kinase/extracellular protein kinase kinase kinase; MKK, MAP kinase kinase; MNK, MAPK-interacting kinase; MSK, mitogen- and stress-activated protein kinase; PRAK, p38-related/activated protein kinase; STAT, signal transducer and activator of transcription; TAK, TGF\u03b2 activated kinase; TAOs, thousand and one kinases; TBP, TATA-binding protein; TTP, Tristetraprolin, TCF, ternary complex factor; 5LO, 5-lipoxygenase; hnRNP, heterogenous nuclear ribonuclear protein.",

A schematic showing an ARE-containing mRNA that has bound eukaryotic initiation factor (eIF) 4E, which specifically recognises the cap structure (m7Gppp), eIF4A, a single stranded RNA binding protein with helicase activity, and eIF4G, a protein that links the cap region to the 40S ribosome. The translation start and stop sites are shown, as is an ARE and the poly-A tail, which bind multiply copies of the poly-A binding protein 1c (PABP). A series of ARE-binding proteins (ARE-BP) are depicted and include the destabilisation protein TTP (tristetraprolin). Known ARE-BPs, along with their functions are listed below the ARE. Terminal kinases of the p38 mitogen activated protein kinase cascade (MAPK) are depicted with p38 MAPK phosphorylating and activating the downstream kinases MAPK activated protein kinase-2 (MAPKAP-K2 or MK2) and MAPK interacting kinase (MNK). p38 MAPK targets the ARE-BPs, hnRNP A0 and A1, via MK2 and MNK, respectively, and this may play a role in mRNA stabilisation. Other proteins that may be targeted by the p38 MAPK include PABP and other ARE-BPs. In addition, p38 MAPK may also target a deadenylase to prevent loss of the poly-A tail and promote mRNA stability and translation. This along with phosphorylation of eIF4E may facilitate association between the poly-A and the cap structure, an event that could be promoted by ARE-BPs, and lead to enhanced efficiency of translation. Finally, the p38 MAPK, acting via MK2, promotes TTP expression and also activates TTP by phosphorylation to exert negative feedback control and destabilisation of ARE containing mRNAs. Other abbreviations: AUF, AU-binding factor; BRF-1, butyrate-response factor 1; hn RNP, heterogenous nuclear ribonuclear protein; TIA-1, T cell-restricted intracellular antigen-1 (TIA1-); TIAR, TIA-related protein.",
