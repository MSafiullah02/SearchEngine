Nevertheless, there is no unified definition of REI in academe thus far, even though some studies have attempted to investigate this issue (Auer, 2005; Hans et al., 2003). For instance, Hans et al. (2003) defines REI as a procedure by which states within a given region increase their level of collaboration with respect to political, economic, security, and socio-cultural issues. Auer (2005) notes that REI implies a removal of barriers to free trade in the region, growing the free movement of people, labour, goods, and capital across states. In general, there are five levels, beginning from a free trade area, to customs union, common market, economic union, and finally political union in the evolution of REI (Ester, 2013).",

            "text": "The evolution of REI in 31 provinces in Mainland China also experiences a similar process from relatively low to high similar to other countries in recent years. Being an agricultural country, given China's economic reform before 1978, provinces could always be self-sufficient, i.e., a province always supports itself with its own resource and products (Li and Lin, 2017). The level of REI was relatively low as each province is a relatively complete industrial system (Ke, 2015). After 1978, the new market economy encouraged economic cooperation among provinces and flow of goods, and therefore regional barriers were gradually weakening, which led to an increase of regional economic integration levels, such as that seen in the Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei area, and Yangtze River Delta. The integration of regions not only accelerates the flow of production factors, management, and technology but also stimulates the mobility of labour and capital, according to the career construction theory (Corse and Rehfuss, 2011). For example, 8.2 million people flow into Beijing in 2015, accounting for about 37.9% of her permanent population (BSY, 2016), and 9.8 million did likewise, a share of 40.6% in Shanghai (SSY, 2016).",

            "text": "Currently, several studies have attempted to investigate REI and its corresponding influences on labour and capital mobility (Berkowitz and DeJong, 2003; Xu and Voon, 2003). Berkowitz and DeJong (2003) assess the evolution of REI within Russia during 1995\u20131999 and explore potential determinants of this evolution. The study finds a strong negative correspondence between openness to international trade and internal economic integration. Similarly, Xu and Voon (2003) gauge the degree of China's regional integration using a statistical model, and the results show that China is relatively integrated across provinces and the level of integration has increased over time. Meanwhile, several studies explore the impact of REI on the mobility of labour and capital, investment, and trade (Behrens et al., 2007; Ester, 2013; Kumar et al., 2014; Sch\u00f6b and Wildasin, 2007). Ester (2013) investigates the relationship between REI and professional labour mobility within the context of the African community. Kumar et al. (2014) analyses the capital mobility caused by regional economic integration within four regional economic communities in Africa. Behrens et al. (2007) investigates the impact of regional economic integration on trade and finds that the benefits of integration come as trade barriers fall; however, to the best of current knowledge, no study has investigated the influence of REI on CO2 marginal abatement cost (MAC). With increasingly serious climate change, MAC of CO2 emissions, measuring the economic loss of reducing an additional unit of CO2 emissions, are intensively discussed over the past decades with a bottom-up approach (Vaillancourt et al., 2008), macroeconomic approach (Minihan and Wu, 2012; Zhang and Folmer, 1998), and an efficiency analysis approach (Choi et al., 2012; Du and Mao, 2015; F\u00e4re et al., 2006; Lee and Zhang, 2012; Lee and Zhou, 2015; Leleu, 2012; Tang et al., 2016; Wang and He, 2017a, Wang and He, 2017b). Among these studies, some prefer to evaluate the value of MAC of CO2 emissions at national, regional, and industrial levels (Lee and Zhou, 2015; Wei et al., 2013), while some focus on the dynamic relationship between MAC and CO2 abatement to provide wider application to energy and environmental policy-making (M\u00fcller and Tol, 2013; Guo et al., 2016; Du et al., 2015b). Meanwhile, some are interested in investigating the determinants of MAC, which includes industrial structure, energy consumption structure, and urbanisation level (Du et al., 2015b). For a firm, the age, scale, and location are the determinants of MAC (Wei et al., 2013) however, the influence of REI on MAC has been ignored to investigate. In fact, REI has a significant effect on the key parameters used in MAC estimation. On the one hand, the mobility of labour and capital caused by REI will not only contribute to gross domestic product (GDP) growth from the perspective of the production side, according to the Cobb-Douglas production function, but also increase the local energy consumption, and therefore CO2 emissions and environmental pressure, which may influence the MAC of CO2 emissions. On the other hand, technological progress benefitting from REI will also have an impact on local production and carbon emissions technology, which is conducive to the improvement of productivity and carbon emissions efficiency, both of which will affect CO2 marginal abatement costs (Wang and He, 2017b).",

To serve this purpose, the provincial CO2 marginal abatement costs incurred during 2002\u20132011 are firstly evaluated with a parametric directional distance function (PDDF) model. Secondly, following the approach of Parsley and Wei (2001), a regional economic integration index is constructed using a price-based approach considering the stylised fact that the dispersion of price differentials will be gradually weakening by the evolution of regional economic integration (Li and Lin, 2017; Parsley and Wei, 2001; Xu, 2002). Finally, a panel data model with 30 cross-sections and 10 periods is established. In addition to empirical results, robustness tests are conducted through the use of a resampling, and different regional economic integration indexes. The study could provide important insights about the determinants of CO2 marginal abatement cost change.",

            "text": "There is no doubt that the evolution of REI has considerable effects on labour and capital mobility, investment, as well as the CO2 marginal abatement cost. Based on previous studies, REI could influence the MAC of CO2 emissions via the following mechanisms (see Fig. 1\n). Firstly, the evolution of REI stimulates the mobility of labour and capital across different regions (Ester, 2013; Kumar et al., 2014), which may influence the MAC of CO2 emissions from both production, and consumption sides. On the one hand, the mobility of labour will influence the amount of energy consumption, and therefore CO2 emissions. On the other hand, labour mobility will also influence local labour input. Proper labour input increases are conducive to regional GDP growth: however, labour mobility may also result in congestion of labour input considering the unbalanced level of economic development, which may worsen productivity and GDP growth (Sueyoshi and Goto, 2016). Therefore, labour mobility may lead to both positive and negative influences on input-output indicators. If the positive influence is greater than the negative influence, then labour mobility may lead to an increase of MAC and vice versa. Secondly, the evolution of REI is conducive to achieving a certain scale economy, which is regarded as an important source of productivity growth in many studies (Wang and Feng, 2015; Li and Lin, 2017). The achievement of scale in an economy contributes to productivity growth, which would influence the MAC of CO2 emissions. Thirdly, the evolution of REI encourages competition among regions, which accelerates technological progress and the improvement of management as enterprises have more incentive to invest in R&D aimed at improving technology and management (Ke, 2015; Li and Lin, 2017). Finally, regional economic integration encourages specialisation according to comparative advantage theory (Grossman and Helpman, 2015; Li and Lin, 2017). In the process of REI, the firms tend to have more opportunities to choose collaborative partners with relatively low opportunity cost, which urges firms to promote their technology and management to achieve specialisation to decease their opportunity cost. Specialisation, a source of productivity growth, could also influence the MAC of CO2 emissions.",

With the progress of production and CO2 technology, the potential of CO2 emissions reduction would gradually decrease, directly resulting in higher marginal abatement cost, vice versa and regional economic integration merely accelerates this process. Another main component is the adjustment of economic structure. In general, heavy industries are always typified as high energy consumption and CO2 emissions, low efficiency (Wang and Feng, 2015; Wang et al., 2017). High emission with low efficiency always results in great potential of CO2 abatement, and therefore the marginal abatement cost is relatively low. With the adjustment of economic structure, the share of heavy industries is falling, and that of the tertiary industry is increasing. As a consequence, the marginal abatement cost of CO2 emissions also changes accordingly. In empirical study, we also take technology progress and adjustment of economic structure into consideration.",

Based on environmental production technology (1), the input-oriented Shephard distance function, S\nI = inf {\u03b1| (y, \nu) \u2208 P(\u03b1\nx)}, serves to minimise inputs with fixed outputs under that environmental production technology, and was widely used to derive the MAC of pollutants. However, as the Shephard distance function could only optimise one of the inputs and outputs, failing to optimise multiple items, the directional distance function was accordingly proposed by Chung et al. (1997), explicitly expressed as:(2)Dtxyugy\u2212gu=sup\u03b2:y+\u03b2gyu\u2212\u03b2gu\u2208Pxwhere, g = (g\ny, \u2212g\nu) is a direction vector associated with outputs and by-products and \u03b2 is an adjustment coefficient. As shown in (2), direction distance function serves to maximise outputs and minimise by-products at the same time with fixed inputs under environmental production technology P(x). In other words, the directional distance function (2) measures the distance between a DMU and its projection on a frontier along direction vector g. A smaller \u03b2 implies a better production performance of the evaluated DMU, or vice versa. In particular, \u03b2 = 0implies that the DMU is on the frontier. According to F\u00e4re et al. (2006) and Wei et al. (2013), the directional distance has following properties: i) convexity; ii) non-negativity, i.e., for all (x, \ny, \nu) > 0,D\nt(x, \ny, \nu; \ng\ny, \u2212g\nu) \u2265 0, equivalently, D\nt(x, \ny, 0; \ng\ny, \u2212g\nu) < 0; iii) monotonicity, specifically, the D\nt(x, \ny, \nu; \ng\ny, \u2212g\nu) monotonically decreases with respect to inputs and by-products and monotonically increase with respect to outputs; iv) translation property, i.e., for any \u03b1 \u2208 \u211d, D\nt(x, \ny + \u03b1\ng\ny, \nu \u2212 \u03b1\ng\nu; \ng\ny, \u2212g\nu) = D\nt(x, \ny, \nu; \ng\ny, \u2212g\nu) \u2212 \u03b1 holds.",

Considering data availability, this study chose a price-based approach to construct REI index. In general, as suggested by the law of one price (PPP), the dispersion of the price differentials of the goods across the regions will tend to be stable with the evolution of regional economic integration. In other words, the prices of goods in different regions will converge with the evolution of regional economic integration level as the production factors, goods, technology, and management flow across the regions. Based on this important fact, Ke (2015) and Parsley and Wei (2001) constructed a comprehensive index incorporating price information about various goods, to measure the level of REI with a price approach. Similarly, this study will also construct a regional economic integration index by incorporating price information about eight diversified goods items, covering several categories to reduce the error of estimation.",

(8) uses the absolute value to measure the dispersion following the method proposed by Li and Lin (2017). A stylised fact is that the dispersion of price differentials with respect to the goods k defined in (8) is not completely caused by regional segmentation but also goods-specific characteristics. Therefore, as suggested in Li and Lin (2017), filtering these additional factors could better estimate the regional economic integration. By Li and Lin (2017), the dispersion of price differentials is divided into two parts: \u2223\u0394Q\nijt\nk \u2223 = r\nk + \u03b5\nijt\nk. The first part is a goods-specific heterogeneity, while the second part is caused by regional segmentation. To remove the goods-specific heterogeneity, a new dispersion index is defined by minus the average dispersion of price differentials across all province-pairs(i, \nj)at timeton the basis of Eq. (8):(9)RSijtk=\u2223\u0394Qijtk\u2223\u22121S\u2211ijj\u2260i\u2223\u0394Qijtk\u2223=\u03b5ijtk\u2212\u03b5ijk\u2212where, \u03b5ijk\u2212 is the mean of \u03b5\nijt\nk with respect to province pair (i, \nj), and S represents the total of province-pair. After removing the goods-specific heterogeneity, we use the standard deviation of dispersion index RS\nijt\nk across item of goods k, Var(RS\nijt\nk) to measure the fluctuation of price differentials of goods k. Next, the regional segmentation based on price variability in each region could be expressed as VarRSitk=1N\u2211j\u2260iVarRSijtk, where N is the number of regions to be merged. Based on Li and Lin (2017), the regional economic integration index in region i at time t can be defined as:(10)REIit=1VarRSitk\n",

The data pertaining to fossil fuel-based energy consumption (measured as a coal equivalent), are extracted from the China Energy Statistical Yearbook (NBSC, 2012b), while the data for labour and GDP are derived from the China Statistical Yearbook (NBSC, 2012a, NBSC, 2012c). The capital of each province was calculated by x\n2\ni,t = \u03bcx\n2\ni,t\u22121 + I\ni,t, where x\n2\ni,t and x\n2\ni,t\u22121 are the capital stock of region i in period t at time t \u2010 1, respectively (Choi et al., 2012; Wang and He, 2017b); I\ni,t is the investment of region i at time t and \u03bc represents the rate of depreciation thereof. The data of investment are from China Statistical Yearbook (NBSC, 2012a) and were converted to 2000 constant price. As CO2 emissions account for a large share of greenhouse gas, this study only covers CO2 emissions and excludes other greenhouse gas. Since no official data are issued, the data for CO2 emissions were estimated thus (IPCC, 2006): Ck=\u2211hEk,h\u00d7CFh\u00d7CCh\u00d7COFh\u00d73.67, where C\nk are the CO2 emissions of the kth DMU, and E\nk,h represents the hth type of energy consumption of the kth DMU. In addition, CF\nh, CC\nh, and COF\nh are the average net calorific value, the carbon content, and the carbon oxidation factor, respectively. 3.67 is the mass ratio of CO2 to C. It is worth mentioning that this study only covers the energy-related CO2 emissions following the manner in Du et al. (2015a) and Wei et al. (2013), considering its very large share and difficulty in evaluating non-energy CO2 emissions. The descriptive statistics pertaining to the aforementioned data are summarised in Table 1\n.",

As shown in Fig. 2\n, Beijing, Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Guangdong, and Shanghai, with relatively high economic levels of development, have higher marginal abatement cost, and specifically, a cost of more than RMB 300 will be incurred per additional unit of CO2 emissions abatement. Similarly, other eastern provinces, for instance, Tianjin, Jilin, Fujian, and Shandong, have a relatively high marginal abatement cost. While turning attention to the Central and Western provinces with relatively less developed economies, it could be found that their marginal abatement costs are significantly lower than those of the eastern provinces, especially for some western provinces, such as Gansu, Qinghai, Ningxia, Inner Mongolia, etc., with less than RMB 100 marginal abatement cost. With higher production technology and more developed economies, scholars agree that China's eastern provinces would suffer more cost per additional unit of CO2 emissions reduction relative to less developed provinces in the west and in central China (Choi et al., 2012; Du et al., 2015b).",

Firstly, with the passage of time, the average marginal abatement cost of three areas all consecutively rises from 2002 to 2011. In accordance with macroeconomic theory, technological progress inevitably occurs over time, which certainly leads to higher CO2 marginal abatement costs. Secondly, CO2 marginal abatement costs in eastern areas are higher than those in central and western areas: differing from many previous studies which conclude that western provinces had the lowest marginal abatement costs, this study finds that the average abatement cost of central provinces is first slightly lower than that of western provinces before 2009, and then higher thereafter. Although this finding was unexpected, it is, nonetheless, explicable. Du et al. (2015a) found that a significant U-shaped relationship exists between carbon intensity and CO2 marginal abatement cost. It specifically concluded that when the carbon intensity is relatively low (less than 6 ton/RMB 10,000), the marginal abatement cost will decrease with increasing carbon intensity: however, after exceeding 6 ton/RMB 10,000, the marginal abatement cost will also increase with increasing carbon intensity. Here, it is well known that western provinces have the largest carbon intensity among all provinces, followed by central provinces, and eastern provinces, resulting in the highest CO2 marginal abatement cost falling of the eastern provinces, followed by that on the central provinces. If the carbon intensity of western provinces was too high, its marginal abatement cost may also be higher than that of central provinces according to their U-shaped relationship.",

On the other hand, in the theory of econometrics, consistency of estimation is a more important principle in relative to effectiveness of estimation, particularly in the relatively small sample estimation. In addition, as regional economic integration is actually correlated to the position, economic level of the provinces, fixed effect model is indeed a more appreciate approach.

By controlling variables CO2 emissions intensity, urban level, composition of industry, environmental regulation and energy consumption structure in Models 2 to 6, the regression coefficients of ln(ln(REI)) is significantly positive at 5% significance level, which imply that the evolution of regional economic integration partially contributes to the increase of MAC of CO2 emissions. In addition, these models also show a relatively stable relationship between regional economic integration and marginal abatement cost as the coefficients of ln(ln(REI)) in Models 2 to 6 ranged from 0.203 to 0.224. Therefore, we can conclude that the evolution of REI indeed contributes the increase of CO2 marginal abatement cost. In the process of regional economic integration, goods, labour, capital, advanced technology, and management philosophy flow among provinces. Meanwhile, the evolution of REI stimulates the reallocation of resource and energy, which is conducive to the improvement of carbon emissions efficiency. Consequently, the evolution of REI contributes to the improvement of carbon emissions efficiency and technological progress, resulting in the increase of MAC of CO2 emissions. Earlier studies have shown a positive relationship exists between CO2 emissions performance and marginal abatement cost, while Li and Lin (2017) also conclude that CO2 emissions performance benefits from the evolution of regional economic integration. These two important conclusions could also provide indirect evidence for the results of this study.",

Specifically, the coefficient of urbanisation level and environmental regulation are also positive at the 5% significance level, which imply that marginal abatement cost will increase with the evolution of urbanisation level and increase of the share of environmental control investment. Their effect on the MAC of CO2 emissions could be interpreted as follows: the increase in level of urbanisation implies social progress, thereafter, rural labours flow into cities, which could generate more jobs, contributing to the improvement of labour productivity and GDP growth. Both of these will induce an increase in the MAC of CO2 emissions. As discussed in Section 4.3.1, environmental regulation may affects MAC positively or nagatively. The significantly positive coefficient indicates that the positive influence is greater than the negative influence. Therefore, the increase in environmental regulation will induce an increase in MAC. It is worth mentioning that the square of environmental regulation significantly contributes to MAC of CO2 emissions, which indicates that the influence of environmental regulation on MAC will be larger and larger with the increase of share of environment control investment.",

As discussed in 2.1, 4.3.1, technological progress is one of the main sources of marginal abatement cost change, and CO2 emissions intensity reflects the technology level to some extent. Negative coefficient of CO2 emissions intensity at 1% significant level provides the strong evidence that technological progress is one of the main sources of MAC increase. As another main source of marginal abatement cost change, economic structure also negatively influences the marginal abatement cost of CO2 emissions according to the regression results. With the increase of share of heavy industry, typified as high emissions and low efficiency, CO2 abatement potential increases and therefore the marginal abatement cost of CO2 emissions falls. Note that in our results, energy consumption structure doesn't significantly influence the MAC of CO2 emissions. The main reason is that the dependent variable is the logarithm of MAC to overcome the heteroscedasticity.

            "text": "Under the background of frequent trade and blurring of barriers among regions, this study empirically investigates whether regional economic integration affects the CO2 marginal abatement cost or not, in the context of China. To serve this purpose, a parametric distance function model was used to estimate the CO2 marginal abatement costs in 30 provinces between 2002 and 2011. Then the level of regional integration was estimated by a price-based approach. Finally, a series of panel data models were constructed to investigate the impact of regional integration on marginal abatement cost. The main results may be summarised as follows:i)CO2 marginal abatement costs vary by region. On average, these of eastern areas with higher level-economies, are the highest, at approximately RMB 300\u2013400/ton, followed by those in central areas. Some western areas have the lowest CO2 marginal abatement cost at less than RMB 100/ton. Although varying greatly, the CO2 marginal abatement costs of most provinces present an upward trend from 2002 to 2011, which implied a certain technical progress in these provinces in the sample periods.ii)As expected, the regional integration of China shows an upward trend in 2002\u20132011 with the exception of 2003\u20132004 and 2006\u20132009 due to the spread of the SARS virus in 2003 and the effects of the American sub-prime loan crisis in 2008.Moreover, regional integration also exhibits regional differences.iii)The evolution of regional economic integration indeed contributes to the increase of CO2 marginal abatement cost at the 5% significance level, as regional economic integration accelerates the labour mitigation, technological progress Furthermore, the results are robust to the choice of sub-sample and several new regional economic integration measured by the price index of different goods.\n",

            "text": "CO2 marginal abatement cost is key to policy-making with regards carbon abatement, such as in the setting of CO2 reduction targets, implementation of a nationwide carbon trading system, etc. Based on this study, some important policy implications arise. Firstly, implementation of a CO2 trading system is beneficial for the improvement of the cost-effectiveness of CO2 abatement in China. According to the study, CO2 marginal abatement costs range from 40 to 1200 RMB/ton among 30 provinces, therefore a nationwide carbon trading system is conducive to reducing the total abatement cost considering regional differences in MAC. Nowadays, a nationwide CO2 trading system covering only 1700 power-generating firms has been established. There is no doubt it helps to improve the cost-effectiveness of CO2 abatement in the power industry. Therefore, we suggest that a nationwide CO2 trading system covering all industries should be established as soon as possible. Secondly, while establishing a nationwide CO2 trading system, the carbon price is crucial. We suggest formulating different provincial carbon prices. Specifically, the carbon price in eastern provinces should be higher than that in western, and central, provinces. The results of the study could provide a more detailed reference for formulating specific provincial carbon price regimes, considering the reliability of the results compared to these of earlier studies. Thirdly, although regional economic integration contributes to the increase in CO2 marginal abatement cost, Local Government should also encourage, and accelerate, the evolution of regional economic integration. The main reason is that an increase in CO2 marginal abatement cost implies an increase in CO2 emissions efficiency, more reasonable resource allocation, and technical progress, therefore regional economic integration actually accelerates technological progress and increases the potential reduction in CO2 emissions. In particular, western, and central, provinces should accelerate the evolution of regional economic integration through more cooperation with other regions, trade, and the flow of technology.",
