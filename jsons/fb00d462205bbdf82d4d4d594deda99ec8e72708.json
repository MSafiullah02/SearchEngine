In our study, the estimation of the COVID-19 cases in Wuhan around Jan 29, 30 and 31, 2020 exceeds the lower prediction 132,751 in the prior probability: 0.0134. Our statistical analysis is consistent with Jonathan MR et al, if the specificity of SARS-CoV-2 PCR assays in Japan exceeds 99.7%. If the specificity in Japan was 99.99%, it would almost match the number of greater than 190 thousand, Jonathan MR et al said.",
