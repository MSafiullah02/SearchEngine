Salbutamol (albuterol, Ventolin) 2 to 4 puffs, can be given every 15 minutes via MDI with chamber, waiting 5 tidal volume breaths between puffs.3, 9 More puffs can be administered (up to 10) in more resistant exacerbations.

This volume is then diluted with normal saline for a total of 5 mL of fluid per nebulized mask. The most severe exacerbations may benefit from continuous therapy19 with a nebulizer driven by oxygen if hypoxia is also present.3, 9, 17 With continuous nebulization, salbutamol is recommended to be given at 0.5 mg/kg/h with the hourly dose not exceeding 10 to 15 mg/h.3\n",

Traditionally the induction agent of choice is ketamine (1\u20132 mg/kg IV) because of its mild bronchodilating properties,77 though the clinical significance of this bronchodilation is questionable,77, 78 and several trials using ketamine infusion as an adjunct in status asthmaticus have shown no benefit.78, 79 Ketamine can also increase oral and airway secretions80 and trigger laryngospasm, and should be used in conjunction with a paralytic agent to counteract this possibility.81 Other choices for induction include etomidate (0.3 mg/kg IV) and propofol (1.5\u20133 mg/kg IV).

An immunization and travel history should be elicited, since an unimmunized child is at higher risk of developing laryngeal diphtheria from Corynebacterium diphtheriae infection. Pharyngitis and dysphagia are features that are uncommon with croup, and may suggest retropharyngeal abscess, peritonsillar abscess, epiglottitis, or diphtheria. Finally, caution is required when diagnosing croup in a stridorous child younger than 6 months, due to the important differential diagnosis in this age group.

The literature has also addressed the issue of the extent of workup necessary in infants 1 to 90 days old with a clinical diagnosis of bronchiolitis. It has been shown that the incidence of serious bacterial illness (SBI) is lower compared with controls without the diagnosis of bronchiolitis,145 though a full septic workup is still recommended for patients younger than 1 month. In two case series of 42 and 187 children having blood, urine, and cerebrospinal fluid cultures sent despite the diagnosis of bronchiolitis, no cases of septicemia or meningitis were found and the incidence of urinary tract infection (UTI) in the latter study was 2%.

Nasal suctioning is an easy, useful adjunctive treatment that may improve respiratory status, given the significant secretions in many younger infants who are obligate nose breathers; it is recommended before feeds.157 No evidence currently exists to support deeper airway suctioning. Oxygen should be administered for saturation less than 90% according to American Academy of Pediatrics Guidelines,130 and is an option in those with saturations of 90% to 94% and moderate signs of respiratory distress.157, 158 Non-invasive positive-pressure ventilation or intubation is indicated for those rare cases presenting with respiratory failure. IV hydration is necessary for those with dehydration and feeding difficulty. Attention to the risk of syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone secretion (SIADH) is necessary. Chest physiotherapy has been well studied in the inpatient setting and has not been shown to improve short-term clinical scores or hospital course, and is therefore discouraged.130, 157, 158, 159\n",

Given its proposed actions on improving clearance of mucus and cellular debris, initial studies in the setting of cystic fibrosis showed some benefit.165 Multiple studies and a 2010 Cochrane review155 have revealed that nebulized hypertonic saline consistently improves post-inhalation clinical scores and decreases length of stay in hospital by approximately 25% or 0.94 days.166 In contrast to the inpatient data whereby nebulized hypertonic saline is given at intervals of every 8 hours or less over several days, ED studies using 1 to 3 consecutive doses with a bronchodilator have not to date shown statistically significant improvement in short-term clinical scores, nor decreased hospitalization rates (although trends to these outcomes are suggested and decreased severity is found at 24\u201372 hours).135, 151, 155, 162, 166, 167 Nebulized hypertonic saline may need to be given at adequate intervals, dose, and duration for a significant treatment benefit to be seen. It may also be possible that ED initiation followed by continuation of treatment may lead to later benefits in hospital. Further research is currently under way to better establish and clarify the roles of nebulized hypertonic saline in both the outpatient and inpatient settings.",

Although the classic alveolar/lobar pattern was significantly correlated with a bacterial cause in 78% (P<.001), the interstitial pattern traditionally associated with atypical bacteria and viral infections was less specific, with 50% caused by bacteria (typical and atypical) and 50% caused by viruses.

A European study reported that S pneumoniae pneumonia was more commonly associated with WBC of greater than 15,000 to 20,000/mm3, and a mean of 25,000/mm3 if there was also a concomitant bacteremia.144 However, invasive viral disease such as adenovirus or even influenza may cause similar WBC elevations, so interpretation should be done with caution in consideration of the overall clinical picture. Acute phase reactants such as erythrocyte sedimentation rate and CRP have shown suboptimal utility as sole determinants to distinguish bacterial from viral causes, due to limited specificities.181, 194 Although a procalcitonin level greater than 1.0 ng/mL was helpful in distinguishing bacterial from viral CAP in a recent study,178 it was unable to distinguish pneumococcal from atypical bacterial pneumonia.",
