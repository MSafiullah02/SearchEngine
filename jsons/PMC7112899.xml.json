            "text": "Human T-lymphotropic virus 1 (HTLV-1) is a member of delta retroviruses (Retroviridae family). It is the etiologic agent of adult T-cell leukemia-lymphoma (ATLL) (Ratner, 2004) and the neurologic disease HTLV-associated myelopathy/tropical spastic paraparesis (HAM/TSP) (Nagai and Osame, 2003). The HTLV-1 proviral genome is composed of pol, gag and env structural genes, and regulatory genes such as tax and rex, flanked by long terminal repeat (LTR) sequences at both ends (Seiki et al., 1983). The pol gene codes for the reverse transcriptase and integrase, and gag and env code for the structural proteins of HTLV-1. The mature matrix (MA), capsid (CA) and nucleocapsid (NC) proteins are produced after the cleavage of Gag precursor polyproteins by the viral protease. The HTLV-1 Env protein is derived from an envelope polyprotein precursor that is cleaved by cellular proteases, yielding a mature protein. This protein is composed of two subunits, a surface subunit (SU) and a transmembrane (TM) subunit (Le Blanc et al., 2001, Manel et al., 2005). Gag precursor polyproteins direct membrane targeting, which is required for viral assembly and release (Le Blanc et al., 2001). Previous studies found that HTLV-1 uses the glucose transporter GLUT-1 to infect the target cell, and this interaction involves also Env proteins (Manel et al., 2003). These features of HTLV-1 structural proteins make them important targets in studies directed toward the development of new therapeutic methods.",

            "text": "Observed initially in plants but described accurately in Caenorhabditis elegans (Fire et al., 1998), RNA interference (RNAi) refers to a cellular mechanism by which a double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) inhibits the expression of a specific gene. The dsRNAs are processed by the endonuclease Dicer into small interference RNAs (siRNAs), which are composed of approximately 21 nucleotides. These siRNAs are incorporated into the RNA-induced silencing complex (RISC) by the RISC-loading complex (RLC), and the sense strand of siRNA is removed. The RISC is guided by the siRNA antisense strand to the complementary target mRNA. Then, the mRNA is cleaved by the Ago2 protein. If partial complementarity occurs between the siRNA antisense strand and the target mRNA, translation is inhibited and there is no mRNA degradation (Kurreck, 2009). RNAi is involved in the inhibition of viruses and in the silencing of identical elements in plants, insects, fungi and nematodes (Waterhouse et al., 2001, Voinnet, 2001, Wilkins et al., 2005, Wang et al., 2006, Segers et al., 2007). When this genetic technique is used in mammals, dsRNAs elicit the innate antiviral immune response by inducing interferon-linked pathways (Rana, 2007). Furthermore, it has been found that the transfection of 21\u201323-nt synthetic siRNAs, with 2-nt 3\u2032 overhangs, into mammalian cells effectively inhibits an endogenous gene in a sequence-specific manner (Elbashir et al., 2001, Caplen et al., 2001, Holen et al., 2002). Since 2001, when the first report on inhibition of human respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) using RNAi technology was published (Bitko and Barik, 2001), many other studies have been performed examining the suppression of viral infections (Ma et al., 2007, Haasnoot et al., 2007). They include the following: human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) (Novina et al., 2002, Hayafune et al., 2006, Naito et al., 2007), hepatitis C virus (HCV) (Kr\u00f6nke et al., 2004, Sakamoto et al., 2008), hepatitis B virus (HBV) (Wu et al., 2005a, Ying et al., 2007), severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (Sars-CoV) (Shi et al., 2005, Wu et al., 2005b) and influenza A virus (IAV) (Zhou et al., 2007).",

The characteristics of the target RNA and intrinsic mechanisms of siRNA itself play a role in silencing (Kurreck, 2009). One of the two strands can be assembled preferentially into the RISC depending on the stability of the two siRNA strands; if the complementary strand is not assembled into RISC, silencing would thus not be observed. Furthermore, the sequence of the target RNA could be inaccessible to the complementary strand, affecting the silencing (Schubert et al., 2005). These factors may partly explain the variation of gene suppression observed in this study. In addition, siRNA efficiency is strongly related to complementarity. siRNA may recognize and bind to the target sequence with incomplete homology, resulting in merely repression of translation without mRNA target degradation. This fact may explain the difference between the results obtained by flow cytometry and real-time PCR.",

The use of siRNAs for the treatment of HIV-1 infection, specifically directed against the gag gene (Novina et al., 2002), was reported subsequently. At the same time, studies have demonstrated the inhibition of the regulatory HIV-1 rev gene (Lee et al., 2002) and infectivity factors such as the vif and nef genes (Jacque et al., 2002).",

Considering previous studies showing efficient inhibition of HIV-1 structural proteins Gag and Env (Novina et al., 2002, Park et al., 2002, Park et al., 2003), and the importance of the corresponding genes in HTLV-1 for its biology, in the present study, RNAi technology was utilized to determine its efficacy for the inhibition of HTLV-1 structural genes. In addition, few studies have used RNAi during HTLV-1 infection. This technique has been employed previously to demonstrate the importance of GLUT-1 in HTLV-1 cell entrance (Manel et al., 2003), some regulatory tax gene functions (Nomura et al., 2004, Qu et al., 2004, Hara et al., 2008, Jung et al., 2008, Hieshima et al., 2008), virus release (Blot et al., 2004) and host cell gene functions (Tomita et al., 2009). Most of these studies used siRNAs against genes of the host cells or the regulatory tax gene. No other report used siRNAs for HTLV-1 structural genes.",
