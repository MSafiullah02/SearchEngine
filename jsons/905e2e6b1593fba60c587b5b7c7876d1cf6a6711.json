Explanation of the time course of an epidemic can be partly achieved by estimating the effective reproduction number, R(t), defined as the actual average number of secondary cases per primary case at calendar time t (for t > 0). R(t) shows time-dependent variation due to the decline in susceptible individuals (intrinsic factors) and the implementation of control measures (extrinsic factors). If R(t) < 1, it suggests that the epidemic is in decline and may be regarded as being under control at time t (vice versa, if R(t) > 1).

            "text": "The basic reproduction number, R 0 (pronounced as R nought), is a key quantity used to estimate transmissibility of infectious diseases. Theoretically, R 0 is defined as the average number of secondary cases generated by a single primary case during its entire period of infectiousness in a fully susceptible population [14] . The reproduction number, R, is directly related to the type and intensity of interventions necessary to control an epidemic since the objective of public health efforts is to achieve R < 1 as soon as possible. One of the best known utilities of R 0 is in determining the critical coverage of immunization required to eradicate a disease in a randomly mixing population. When an effective vaccine is available against the disease in question, it is of interest to estimate the critical proportion of the population that needs to be vaccinated (i.e. vaccination coverage) in order to attain R < 1 [3, 4, 33] . Considering the so-called control relation, 1 \u2212 1 R 0 , the protection conferred to the population by achieving a critical vaccination coverage, herd immunity, yields the threshold condition for the eradication of a disease [18, 28] . As it is extensively discussed elsewhere [13, 14] , the mathematical definition of R 0 is given by using the next generation matrix where R 0 is in the simplest case calculated as the dominant eigenvalue (see Chapter 1) . In addition to the threshold phenomena, R 0 has been classically used to suggest the severity of an epidemic, because the proportion of those experiencing infection at the end of an epidemic (i.e. final size) depends only on R 0 [23] . The basic statistical methods to estimate R 0 from observed epidemiological datasets have been reviewed by Klaus Dietz elsewhere [15] .",

Explanation of the time course of an epidemic can be partly achieved by estimating the effective reproduction number, R(t), defined as the actual average number of secondary cases per primary case at calendar time t (for t > 0) [6-10, 22, 29, 30, 35] .

If R(t) < 1, it suggests that the epidemic is in decline and may be regarded as being under control at time t (vice versa, if R(t) > 1). Even when effective interventions against a specific disease are limited, it is plausible that the contact frequency leading to infection varies as a function of time owing to the recognition of epidemics and/or dissemination of the relevant information through mass media. In this chapter, we show how R(t) is mathematically defined and how it can be estimated from the observed epidemiological datasets. In addition, other similar time-dependent threshold quantities, which have been proposed in a few practical settings, are discussed.",

Nevertheless, the mathematical importance of the original model was recognized only after the 1970s [12, 27] . We denote the numbers of susceptible and recovered individuals by S(t) and U (t) (Note: to avoid any confusions between the effective reproduction number and the recovered individuals, we denote the recovered individuals by U (t) hereafter). Further, let i(t, \u03c4 ) be the density of infectious individuals at calendar time t and infection-age \u03c4 . The infection-age structured SIR model is given by",

Throughout the pandemic period in Germany, the largest number of deaths was seen in this fall wave. Prussia represents the northern part of present Germany and at the time of the pandemic it was part of the Weimer Republic as a free state following World War I. The death data were collected from 28 different local districts surrounding the town of Arnsberg, which, at the time of the epidemic, had a population of approximately 2.5 million individuals (the mortality rate in this period being 0.36%).

Whereas the choice of generation time therefore affects estimates of R i , it does not affect the ability to predict the temporal distribution of cases. It should be noted that this simple model assumes a homogeneous pattern of spread. Figure 3 shows time variations in the estimated effective reproduction numbers obtained assuming three different generation times (i.e. 1, 3 and 5 days) compared with the corresponding epidemic curve. Epidemic date 0 represents 9 September 1918 when the back-calculated onset of cases initially yielded a value the nearest integer of which was 1. Since the precision of the estimate is influenced by the observed number of cases, wide 95% confidence intervals were observed for estimates using a short generation time. However, these time variations in R(t) Fig. 3 Epidemic curve and the corresponding effective reproduction numbers (R) with variable generation times. Time variation in the effective reproduction number (the number of secondary infections generated per case by generation) assuming three different generation times is shown. The generation time was assumed to be 1 (second from the top), 3 (lower middle) and 5 days (bottom). Days are counted from September 9, 1918, onwards exhibited similar qualitative patterns: (i) although the R(t) was highest at the beginning of the epidemic, the estimates fell below 1 when the epidemic curve came close to the peak (i.e. Days 45-50). For example, the estimated R(t) at Day 50 was 0.92 (95% CI: 0.79, 1.06), 0.82 (0.75, 0.89) and 0.72 (0.67, 0.78), respectively, for a generation time of 1, 3 and 5 days. This period corresponds to the time when public health measures were instituted, e.g. obligatory case reporting, encouragement of mask wearing, and closing of public buildings such as churches and theaters [31] . (ii) Thereafter, R(t) stayed slightly below unity, reflecting a slow decline in the number of onset cases. (iii) Shortly before the end of the epidemic (i.e. Days 90-120), R(t) increased again above 1. (iv) Finally, the expected values of R(t) fell below 1 very close to the end of the epidemic. In this stage, estimates assuming a short generation time exhibited wide uncertainty bounds, reflecting stochasticity due to the small number of cases. Figure 4 compares the expected values of R(t) assuming each of the generation times employed. Although the possibility of individual heterogeneity (e.g. potential superspreaders in the early stage) cannot be excluded, R(t) at calendar time t = 0 is theoretically equivalent to R 0 . Assuming generation times of 1, 3 and 5 days, R 0 was estimated to be 1.58 (95% CI: 0.03, 10.32), 2.52 (0.75, 5.85) and 3.41 (1.91, 5.57), respectively. It is remarkable, therefore, to see that R(t) largely depends on the assumed length of the generation time. That is, the longer the generation time, the higher the R(t). It should also be noted that the relationship between R(t) and the generation time is reversed when the epidemic is under control (i.e. when R(t) < 1 in the later stage of the epidemic). The finding is analytically interpretable from Equation (20) which suggests that the absolute number of the reproduction number The horizontal solid line represents the threshold value, R = 1, below which the epidemic will decline to extinction. Days are counted from September 9, 1918, onwards is informed by the growth rate of an epidemic as well as the shape and scale of the generation time distribution [32, 36] .",

We have shown that the renewal theory gives us rich analytical insights into the definition and computation of various time-dependent threshold quantities. The instantaneous and cohort reproduction numbers are explicit measures of the transmissibility, where the former informs the actual number of secondary transmissions at calendar time t, while the latter gives the average number of secondary transmissions among cohort (i.e. infecteds) who were born at calendar time t. These exactly correspond to the period and cohort total fertility rates, respectively, in mathematical demography. The difference between the two is highlighted when a specific event at calendar time t occurs (e.g. a public health intervention starts at calendar time t). Then, R(t) abruptly varies with calendar time t, while R c (t) smoothly varies. For a disease with long generation time, analysis of both quantities might be called for. We have also provided analytically explicit interpretations of the incidence-to-prevalence ratio and the actual reproduction number. Although it appears that the ratio and the actual reproduction number may not be useful for a disease with long generation time (e.g. HIV/AIDS), these might be extremely useful for a disease with acute course of illness, especially when we have both prevalence and incidence in hand. Applications of the above discussed concepts are seen in other chapters in this volume, and we hope you'll enjoy our statistical approaches to various infectious diseases.",
