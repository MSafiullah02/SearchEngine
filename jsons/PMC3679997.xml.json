For respiratory viruses, NAATs are well established as the most sensitive methods for detection and have become front-line diagnostic procedures [7,13-18]. Most commercially available NAATs are highly multiplexed assays and enable simultaneous detection of several respiratory pathogens; however, their poor performance for detecting HAdV emphasizes the need for single target detection [15,17,19]. Adenovirus-specific NAATs have been challenged by the diversity of HAdV species, which now include more than 60 different types [20,21]. Commercial qualitative and quantitative NAATs are available for the detection of all HAdV species and most types, yet these are cost prohibitive for many laboratories. \u201cIn-house\u201d real-time PCR assays are relatively inexpensive alternatives to commercial NAATs that provide rapid and accurate results [7,17,18,21-26]. Wong and collaborators [18] developed an in-house real-time PCR assay that has been designed for the detection of all HAdV species. It has been extensively validated using a variety of clinical specimens [17,18].",

Recently, a crude mechanical lysis using silica glass beads (i.e. homogenization) and heat treatment was shown to recover herpes simplex virus DNA from swabs submitted in universal transport media (UTM) [27,28]. While defying the traditional paradigm of specimen processing for molecular testing, homogenization with heat treatment was shown to be a cost effective alternative to nucleic acid extraction. This study evaluated whether the combination of homogenization and heat treatment with an in-house real-time PCR would be a cost effective strategy for the detection of HAdV from viral swabs transported in UTM.",

Real-time PCR generated 12 additional positive results that were later resolved as true positives using a manual DNA extraction and a commercial real-time PCR (Figure 3A). All 12 PCR-positive culture-negative results were detected following homogenization protocol, whereas 11 were detected following nucleic acid extraction (Figure 3A). The single discordant result between the molecular assays had a Cp value of 37.22, suggesting that it may be attributed to sampling error (Poisson distribution) at low concentrations of template [34]. Since the internal control also failed to amplify in this sample, the negative result could also be attributed to PCR inhibition. Upon repeat processing by automated and manual nucleic acid extractions, positive results were obtained. Therefore, the original specimen result was considered a false negative. Overall, compared to the modified gold standard, the sensitivity of the in-house real-time PCR following homogenization with heat treatment or nucleic acid extraction was approximately equivalent at 100% (89.7\u2013100%) and 97.4% (86.4\u201397.4%), respectively (Table 3). In contrast, the sensitivity of virus culture was only 69.7% (56.0\u201369.2%) (Table 3). The accuracy of each method was 100% (95.6\u2013100%), 99.5% (95.1\u201399.5%), and 93.9% (88.6\u201393.9%), respectively (Table 3).

Since the internal control was added at the level of PCR, both extraction methods could be directly evaluated for the presence of PCR inhibitors. Despite a subsequent heat treatment and dilution step, homogenization is a crude method to recover viral DNA and may not sufficient to remove or inactivate PCR inhibitors. Amplification of the internal control in adenovirus-negative specimens is consistent with a true negative result and not simply attributed to PCR inhibition. PCR inhibition was suspected by either loss of positivity in the 705 nm channel, or a shift in Cp values greater than two standard deviations (which corresponds to approximately \u00b11.0 Cp) from the value obtained with the negative control. This value was established previously, where the internal control Cp values from 150 consecutive HSV-negative specimens were compared by homogenization and heat treatment or nucleic acid extraction [27].

A cost analysis was performed that assumed a more practical approach of bi-weekly molecular testing (3\u20135 specimens with positive, negative and reagent controls). Excluding labor, the average cost of a commercial PCR following nucleic acid extraction would range from $45 to $55 (CAD) per specimen. In comparison, the in-house real-time PCR following a nucleic acid extraction would reduce the cost approximately ~2-fold ($21.44 to $25.97). Replacement of the nucleic acid extraction with the homogenization-base protocol further reduces the cost ~2-fold ($8.84 to $10.97), which is comparable to the average cost of virus culture ($9.47 to 11.64).

We have shown that combining a crude extraction method like homogenization with heat treatment [27] and an in-house real-time PCR [18] is a cost effective strategy for the detection HAdV from swabs submitted in UTM. Homogenization uses multidirectional motion to disrupt cells through contact with silica beads and the heat treatment [27,28]. In combination with a subsequent heat treatment to inactivate heat-labile PCR inhibitors, this crude mechanical lysis had been shown to be a cost-effective method to recover viral DNA from swabs transported in UTM [27].

This far surpasses the performance of virus culture at 69.2%. The 30% increase in positivity is consistent with the ~32-fold increase in analytical sensitivity and is not surprising since similar results were observed when transitioning other viruses from culture to NAATs [38-41]. When comparing positive results from the in-house real-time PCR, Cp values obtained following the homogenization protocol were consistently higher than those obtained following nucleic acid extraction (Figure 3B). However, the analytical and clinical sensitivities of each assay were not significantly different (Figure 2 and Table 3). It should be noted that all virus culture-negative/PCR-positive specimens had Cp values greater than 30, corresponding to viral loads that fell below the LoD for virus culture (Figure 3B).",

Both methods were able to detect diverse HAdV types spanning all the different species (Figure 1 and Table 2). Of the virus culture-positive specimens, the most predominant types detected were 3, 29 and 2, belonging to species B, D and C, respectively. These HAdV types are well-recognized causes of acute respiratory tract and ocular infections and are consistent with the distribution reported by others regions in Canada [42,43]. Interestingly, a variant of HAdV type 14, termed 14p1, has been described as an emerging pathogen associated with outbreaks and sporadic cases of acute respiratory disease in Europe and the United States [2-5]. While most recorded cases were mild infections, severe disease and deaths have occurred. HAdV type 14p1 has a characteristic 6-bp deletion (K250-E251) in the fiber knob gene [4,35,36]. The adenovirus type 14 from this study was consistent with type 14p1 and harbored these mutations (Figure 4). While there has been a number of reports of type 14p1 circulating in the US and Europe, this variant has only once been reported in Canada [4]. The first adenovirus 14p1 cases in Canada were reported from Nova Scotia\u2019s neighboring province, New Brunswick, and included one fatality (Figure 4) [4]. The specimen identified as 14p1 in this study was obtained from a fatal case dating back to same time period as the New Brunswick cases. Further epidemiological investigations are underway. While severe and fatal cases associated with type 14p1 have been reported, similar outcomes have been reported with many other common HAdV types [6,7,10,44]. The most likely culprit of disease severity is the immune status of the host, not the adenovirus type or species.",

Simultaneously processing of multiple PCR assays on the same LightCycler instrument allows more efficient batch testing when equipment availability is limited. Interestingly, these modifications allowed the detection of HAdV type 31 which had previously been problematic on an ABI instrument [18]. Difference between assays can be attributed to a numerous factors (i.e. instrumentation, kits, etc.); however, the most likely explanation in this case is the annealing temperature. Using the original PCR protocol [18], HAdV type 31 could only be detected when the annealing temperature was reduced from 60\u00b0C to 57\u00b0C [18]. The annealing temperature in this study is 55\u00b0C. Using conditions described in this study, the detection of HAdV type 31 has now been replicated in both collaborating laboratories.",

Secondly, the performance characteristics of homogenization may vary between PCR assays and should not be implemented without proper validation [27]. While homogenization with heat treatment has shown to be effective for the recovery of viral DNA from HAdV (this study), HSV [27], and varicella zoster virus, decreased sensitivity was observed for enveloped RNA viruses like mumps and influenza viruses ([24,45] LeBlanc, J. unpublished data).",
