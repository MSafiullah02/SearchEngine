SARS-CoV-2 infection transmits from human to human through droplets and through contact with infected surfaces. Efforts to discover potential treatments for COVID-19 are accelerating with a focus on repositioning previously tested in vitro compounds. Hydroxychloroquine and chloroquine are antimalarial agents with both immunomodulatory and anti-inflammatory activities that have been proposed as possible treatments for COVID-19 disease [3]. There has also been interest in their use as prophylaxis for people with high-risk exposure to COVID-19 who have not yet become infected, although there are currently no data to support the use of these medications as preventive therapy [4].",

In a recent letter published by Wang and colleagues, the in vitro activity of chloroquine against SARS-CoV-2 showed an effective concentration (EC50) at 48 h of 1.13 \u03bcM, indicating potency [8]. Similar studies of chloroquine were previously done on SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV showing an EC50 in a comparable range [9]. A recently published comparison study of their in vitro activity demonstrated higher potency of hydroxychloroquine over chloroquine, with EC50 values similar to prior data [10]. The authors utilized physiologically-based pharmacokinetic modeling and simulation techniques and provided a rationale for the optimal dosing regimen for hydroxychloroquine (400 mg twice on day 1 followed by 200 mg twice daily) based on their in silico experiment.",

One study referring to Korean guidelines recommended 500 mg of chloroquine twice daily or 400 mg of hydroxychloroquine daily [12]. A panel in China recommended chloroquine at a dose of 500 mg twice a day for 10 days for patients with any severity of pneumonia [13]. The Dutch Centers for Disease Control (CDC) suggested a treatment regimen in adults consisting of an initial 600 mg dose of chloroquine followed by 300 mg 1 h later on day 1, then 300 mg twice a day on days 2\u20135 days. Another guideline document by the Italian Society of Infectious and Tropical Diseases (Lombardy section) recommended the use of chloroquine 500 mg twice a day or hydroxychloroquine 200 mg twice daily for 10 days. A meta-analysis of 6 published articles and 23 ongoing trials primarily in China listed a variety of different regimens being studied [14]. Most recently, an open-label non-randomized trial by Gautret et al. suggested hydroxychloroquine 200 mg three times daily for 10 days, with the addition of azithromycin depending on severity of illness [15]. These proposed dosages for COVID- 19 are greater than the hydroxychloroquine dose suggested for rheumatoid arthritis, which is 200\u2013400 mg daily as a single oral daily dose or in 2 divided doses [16].",
