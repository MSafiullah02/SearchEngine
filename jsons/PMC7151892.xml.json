Some ED design lessons have been learned from terror events. From the Tokyo sarin gas event and other natural disasters, such as earthquakes, hospitals know they will need to plan for surge capacity. Methods of alerting ED staff early and protecting emergency care providers from contamination are needed, another lesson made clear by the Tokyo sarin gas event in which many emergency providers were contaminated. The New York City World Trade Center event illustrated the need to respond to a disaster scene and continue to treat a sustained increase in ED volume over prolonged periods. In New York, the clean-up phase after the event led to prolonged increased prehospital and ED volume. Most care was provided by emergency personnel working close to ground zero. From the anthrax mailings in the wake of the World Trade Center event, we can learn to anticipate the need for accurate public information.",

Garage and parking lot space has been used in many disaster drills and mass exposures. Garages and parking lots are more purposely designed with separate access to streets, allowing separation of disaster traffic and routine ED traffic. Needed terror-response supplies (e.g., antidotes, respirators, personal protective gear) are being stored near or within the ED. The cost of ventilation, heat, air conditioning, communication, and security features often prohibits renovation of garages. More often, tents are erected over parking lots or loading areas. Modular \u201csecond EDs,\u201d tents or structures with collapsible walls (fold and stack), have been deployed by disaster responders. These can be used near the main ED, preserving the ED for critical cases. Some hospitals are considering beds in halls, patient rooms, and other spaces to increase their ability to generate surge capacity. Hallways can provide usable space if constructed wider and equipped with medical gases and adequate power and lighting. Often only minimal modifications are necessary to make existing halls and lobbies \u201cdual-use\u201d spaces. Some hospitals have increased space by installing retractable awnings on the exterior over ambulance bays or loading docks. Tents are often used outside EDs as decontamination and treatment areas in disaster drills. Tents with inflatable air walls have the added benefit of being insulated for all-weather use.",

Portable modular units are also available to help EDs address the space needs. Unfortunately, many EDs rely on other facilities in the regional system.

Many ED parking and decontamination areas are monitored by cameras. The wireless tracking system can also be part of the surveillance system. A tracking system can create a virtual geospatial and temporal map of staff and patient movement. Tracking systems have been used in disaster drills to identify threat patterns. Most EDs have identification/access cards and readers. Chemical and biologic sensors for explosives, organic solvents, and biologic agents are becoming available. When selecting a sensor, designers consider sensitivity, selectivity, speed of response, and robustness.8, 9, 10, 11, 12 Sensor technology is an area of active research that continues to yield new solutions that are being incorporated into EDs. In concept, all entrances could be designed to identify persons using scanning to detect unwanted chemicals, biologic agents, or explosives and to detain and decontaminate as needed.",

At some road access points, automated scanners could monitor and control vehicle access. Modern EDs limit the number of entrances and channel pedestrian and vehicular traffic through identification control points. For the most part, points of entrance into the ED can be managed with locking doors, ID badge control points, and surveillance to allow desired access for staff and supplies.

Although atriums are useful as overflow areas, their windows and glass create hazardous flying debris. Given the threat of blast attack, communication, gas, electric, water, and other critical services should be remote from vulnerable areas and shielded when they traverse roads and walkways. Protection against release of chemical and biologic agents inside or outside the ED requires a protective envelope, controlled air filtration in and out, an air distribution system providing clean pressurized air, a water purification system providing potable water, and a detection system.

Adequate environmental protection for patients undergoing DECON is necessary and includes visual barriers from onlookers, segregation of the sexes, and attention to per sonal belongings.24,\n25 In many EDs, DECON areas are being added to accommodate mass exposures. EDs have added or augmented DECON facilities. DECON areas should have a separate, self-contained drainage system, controlled water temperature, and shielding from environmental hazards. Exhaust fans are used to prevent the buildup of toxic fumes in these decontamination areas. For most EDs, mass DECON has been accomplished by using an uncovered parking lot and deploying heated and vented modular tent units. Uncovered parking areas adjacent and accessible to the ED have been enabled for disaster response. Other EDs use high-volume, low-pressured showers mounted on the side of a building. Serial showers allow multiple patients to enter at the same entrance and time. However, serial showers do not provide privacy, can be difficult for an ill patient to access, and can lead to recontaminated water runoff. Also, persons requiring more time may impede flow and reduce the number of patients decontaminated. Parallel showers built in advance or set up temporarily in tenting offer greater privacy but require wider space and depth. Combined serial and parallel design allows the advantages of each, separating ill patients and increasing the number of simultaneous decontaminations.26\n",
