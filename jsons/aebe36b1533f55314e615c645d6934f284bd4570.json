PL pro also shows significant in vitro deubiquitinating and de-ISGylating activities, although the detailed mechanism is still unclear. Here, the crystal structure of SARS-CoV PL pro C112S mutant in complex with ubiquitin (Ub) is reported at 1.4 \u00c5 resolution. The Ub core makes mostly hydrophilic interactions with PL pro , while the Leu-Arg-Gly-Gly C-terminus of Ub is located in the catalytic cleft of PL pro , mimicking the P4-P1 residues and providing the first atomic insights into its catalysis. One of the O atoms of the C-terminal Gly residue of Ub is located in the oxyanion hole consisting of the mainchain amides of residues 112 and 113. Mutations of residues in the PL pro -Ub interface lead to reduced catalytic activity, confirming their importance for Ub binding and/or catalysis. The structure also revealed an N-cyclohexyl-2-aminethanesulfonic acid molecule near the catalytic triad, and kinetic studies suggest that this binding site is also used by other PL pro inhibitors.

The first 62 residues form an independent ubiquitin-like (Ubl) domain, while the other three domains, the palm, thumb and fingers domains, constitute a right-handlike architecture. This topology is similar to the ubiquitinspecific proteases (USPs), one of the five distinct deubiquitinating protease (DUB) families, although their sequence identities are only about 10% (Nijman et al., 2005; Ratia et al., 2006) . The catalytic triad, Cys112, His273 and Asp287, is located within the palm and thumb domains. In the fingertips region of the fingers domain, there is a zinc ion coordinated by four cysteine residues. Mutational studies have confirmed the importance of the catalytic triad and the zinc-binding motif for catalysis (Barretto et al., 2005) . Further studies suggested that in the presence of the denaturant urea, the zinc-binding domain may start to unfold during the first transition and lead to an 80% loss of enzymatic activity (Chou et al., 2012) . It has been demonstrated that PL pro may display a differential domain-structure stability and a molten globule state in its folding. Furthermore, pp1a cleavage by SARS-CoV PL pro has been found to be quite stringent, with selectivity for the substrate P1 (Gly), P2 (Gly), P4 (Leu) and P6 (hydrophobic residues) positions and with cleavage occurring between the P1 and P1 0 positions (Han et al., 2005) .
