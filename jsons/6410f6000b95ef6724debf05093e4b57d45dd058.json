Such issues have vast implications on the desirability of compact, highrise high-dense built forms. Yet, the environmental quality and social acceptance of these forms remain barely studied. This chapter reviews some of the critical environmental implications posed by the closely packed high-rise building and high urban densities. High-rise buildings of Hong Kong 1 are explored to discuss the pressing challenges of poor air quality, ventilation, daylight, lack of open space and noise pollution. Both quantitative and qualitative appraisals of Hong Kong residents living in high-rise buildings are used to analyse the environmental challenges. Recommendations for improvements using current practices in Hong Kong and possible solutions for the future are also discussed.",

Yet, evidence on the impact of higher and lower densities on sustainability, the impact of centralized decentralized city form on sustainability are lacking. Review of some city forms indicates both advantages as well as disadvantages in sustainability. For example, forms that reduce travel and are fuel-efficient may be harmful to the environment and have social inequities. They may be locally beneficial but not city-wise beneficial (Williams et al., 2000) . The effects of urban density on the total energy demand of a city are complex and at times conflicting (Givoni, 1998) . Compactness of land use patterns will bring benefits to energy distribution and transport system design, but crowded conditions may create congestion and undesirable local microclimate (Hui, 2000) .

Among the rectangular mass type and podium type buildings, several shapes of building forms are observed such as the rectangular, \"Y\" shape, clusters and crucifix shapes.

            "text": "In Hong Kong where the buildable land resources are scarce due to hilly terrain and scarcity of usable land, tall buildings serve as an optimal option to maximise development potentials and best returns. Reduction in travel time due to intensification of mixed land uses contributes to efficiency and economic viability of the city (Wu, 2005) . The concept of home-work-play gives the residents efficiency, convenience and savings in time. Tall buildings also provide a heuristic device to meet the housing demands for the increasing population. Additionally, the mixed use nature of developments creates places that are active and lively for longer duration of time, providing safe neighbourhoods and additional time for use of urban spaces for its residents. Rich, vibrant urban spaces are created within neighbourhoods. Urban intensification and compactness also provides savings in infrastructure and services, and high penetration of infrastructure and services for all residents. For example, it results in an overall reduction in energy use and traffic fumes (Wu, 2005) . High-rise building rather than urban sprawl reduces the use of woodlands and forest areas for development, saving valuable land resources for future use and recreation purposes. In Hong Kong such country parks and woodlands can be easily accessed. Yet, there are some consequences associated with tall residential built forms arising from the very high population and extreme density. Both social and environmental implications are prevalent in such conditions. This chapter is specifically focused on the environmental implications and various measures and solutions that may mitigate the environmental consequences of tall residential buildings taking Hong Kong as a case study.",

Drastic environmental implications such as living in busy urban centres with high air and noise pollution, poor lighting and ventilation in individual housing units, urban heat island and wind tunnel effects are observed in Hong Kong's high-rise building developments. One of the problems related to mixed land use developments at very high intensities is the incompatibility of uses. This problem is particularly apparent in the old built-up areas because of a lack of comprehensive planning in the past (Fung, 2001) . Examples include those residential developments that face environmental nuisance due to its location adjacent to industrial areas. Another example is where highways pass through residential areas, posing the threat of noise and air pollution.",

Many areas in Hong Kong are topographically confined by hills and the air pollution dispersion in these areas is inhibited (Hong Kong Use of Solar Energy -Roof and exposed areas for collection of solar energy are limited Planning Department, 2006a). Hong Kong has been facing two air pollution issues: local street-level pollution caused by motor vehicles; and regional smog problem caused by motor vehicles, industry and power plants both in Hong Kong and in the Pearl River Delta. Street level pollution is mainly caused by the large number of motor vehicles in highly dense urban areas. The emissions are trapped in between the very tall buildings along the streets. The tall stacks of building towers create urban walls that are barriers to wind circulation and vistas in the city. Further, it causes wind tunnel effects and unsafe environments at street levels. Walking at street levels in compact cities is no longer safe for the pedestrian. The high flow of vehicular traffic damages the quality of the street environment, with their high noise and air pollutants. Therefore, whether within enclosed spaces or outside in the public areas and streets, the quality of the living environment is being damaged, affecting the overall quality of life.",

Study on residents' satisfactions and aspirations of high-rise living in Hong Kong shows that better view, less noise, better air quality are the major reasons for people to opt for high-rise living (Lau, 2002) . The higher selling prices for apartments on higher floors are also attributed to better views, less noise and better environmental quality. This trend may seem to suggest that residents who choose living on higher floors are seeking an escape from the environmental problems since living on higher floors allows one to be further way from the city surface.

In his 2006-2007 policy address, the Chief Executive of Hong Kong has emphasized the importance of addressing these issues in order to secure sustainable development for future generations. He has outlined some of the measures, To reduce air pollution, we have formulated the Pearl River Delta (PRD) Regional Air Quality Management Plan. This plan, prepared in partnership with the Guangdong Provincial Government, aims to achieve specific emissions reduction targets by 2010. We have now set up a 16-station air quality monitoring network in the PRD.

Recent study identifies the following urban design issues as a means to a better quality and comfortable urban environment: lack of breezeways air paths; tall and bulky buildings closely packed causing undesirable wind breaks to urban fabric; uniform building heights resulting in wind skimming over the top of buildings and not being re-routed into the fabric; tight narrow streets not aligned with prevailing wind with tall buildings resulting in urban canyons; lack of urban permeability-with few open spaces, minimal gaps between buildings, excessive podium structures reducing air volumes at ground levels; large building blocks forming wind barriers; projections from buildings and obstructions on narrow streets and general lack of soft landscaping, shading and greenery as contributing to poor air ventilation and environmental quality in high-rise, compact built areas (Chinese University of Hong Kong, 2005; Hong Kong Planning Department, 2006b) .",

During the daytime, the air near the mountain surface can be heated up and higher than the free air far away at the same height due to the solar radiation. Thus the warm air moves up along the slopes. While during the night-time, as the mountain surfaces cool down, the cold breezes can be formed and flow down the slopes. The proposed new podium can enhance the air flow through the building. It can be imagined that the building region can benefit from the mountain breezes by bringing the cooled air at night-time on hot days. The thermal environment can be improved and energy can be saved (Li & Yang, 2008) . ",

Table 3 .5 illustrates the types of building footprints found in high-rise residential buildings in Hong Kong and the evaluation of the lighting quality within a selected individual housing unit. A qualitative appraisal of the lighting quality in individual rooms of the housing unit is done by its occupant. This is combined with a quantitative -daylight simulation for the residential units showing the distribution of lighting within the spaces. The distribution of lighting quality significantly varied across the building types and spaces/rooms within the individual units. Lack of sufficient lighting and ventilation in the kitchen and washrooms were a common observation. Obstructions to light due to windows being covered for better privacy and furniture layout were also observed as barriers to daylighting within the spaces. Some spaces have no windows at all and may be for the purpose of storage. But due to the lack of sufficient living space such spaces are also used for habitation. On most occasions, occupants use artificial lighting in such spaces even during day-time. Small window sizes and fixed glazing were also commonly noted as causes for poor light and ventilation.",

Residents most often use the window opening into re-entrants for drying clothes, etc. The inlet and outlet water pipes to kitchen and toilets are located along the re-entrant spaces. The mechanical ventilation outlets are also located along these re-entrants that act as a shaft for bringing in fresh air as well as outlets for foul air from toilets and kitchen. The building shapes play a major role in determining the re-entrant shapes (see Table 3 .5 for building shapes and re-entrant shapes).

A common issue is windows placed within the visibility range from neighbouring blocks cause lack of privacy. As a result, most windows are kept closed and covered using opaque materials such as shades, curtains, etc. blocking light and ventilation into the housing units. Tables 3.6 and 3.7 illustrate the case studies and respective daylight analyses. Uneven day light distribution in several spaces within the block is caused due to window sizes and numbers, the floor area, window-floor area ratio, the location of windows, shape of building foot print, interior furniture layout and distance between blocks and block layout, contextual barriers such as hills, obstructions from other buildings also determine the lighting quality and ventilating inside housing units of high rise blocks. Windows facing neighbouring blocks are being constantly kept closed due to lack of privacy, thereby does not serve the purpose of brining in light and ventilation Table 3 .6 Day light study of high rise housing. Sources: Chan (2006 ), Cheung (2006 , Kei (2006 ), Wong (2006 In addition, investigated the effect of relaxation of room height as a means for improving daylight conditions. The study investigated the relaxation of room heights from 2,800 to 3,650 mm and sustainable design features of proposed residential building located at Mid-Levels, Hong Kong. When window size remains the same and the room height is increased the day light within the room is improved but not a very significant improvement is seen. But when window size and room height is increased there is a significant increase in the daylight quality within the room. Also graph shows that in Room 2 with higher room height and larger window size the day light factor shows significant increase The simulations were carried out based on the parameters: date 21 Dec (winter solstice), time 9:00 am, sky condition: overcast sky, design sky 8,500 lux. This analysis is regarded as the worst-case scenario for daylight calculation. Three cases are presented in Table 3 .8. The study revealed that an increase in room height has some effect on improving the daylight quality within a room. In addition, the increase of window height can make a significant contribution to the daylight quality within the room. ",

Open spaces and landscaping on podiums are design measures taken to improve resident perceptions of open spaces, views and greenery. Open spaces located close to highways, roadways, and transport nodes create poor environmental quality due to noise, dust and smoke emissions. In other words, it can be argued that even if open spaces are provided within residential blocks or outside in close proximity to homes, if its quality does not meet the demands and satisfaction of its users, such open spaces may not be efficiently utilised. Podium open spaces and sky gardens create a barrier from traffic and pollution at road levels. Yet, being surrounded by high-rise buildings these spaces have a tendency to trap pollutants due to a lack of cross ventilation and high building mass. The lack of green cover, trees and hard landscaping may contribute to poor micro climatic conditions in the outdoor spaces of high-rise developments (Tan & Fwa, 1992; Wilmers, 1990 Wilmers, /1991 . But, people are forced to use these open spaces despite its poor environmental quality. Study by Davies (1998) has shown that the most popular form of recreation among Hong Kong residents is the use of passive local open spaces. It is observed that the majority of users of such open spaces are elderly, low income groups whose accessibility to district open spaces and country parks may be limited.",

This can be done by orientating the buildings so that it does not obstruct and reflect noise. Instead, it disseminates the noise and avoids a canyon effect. The materials of the facades should be of less reflectance and higher absorption values. In addition, trees and shrubs can be introduced as noise screens alongside roadways. Zoning at planning stage must be done with an awareness of the noise sources and noise reflectors in the surrounding context. Habitable spaces can be buffered by elevating the units above the noise source levels. Soft landscaping features such as water fountains can be used to mask and create distraction from traffic noise.",

But how tall and how to design such tall building is the question of concern. The general policy and regulations provoke taller buildings. But the regulations and attention of Hong Kong designers are turned towards more sensitive design measures that will balance the demand for taller buildings with more sensitive, sustainable and liveable design features. The critical implications for building tall are mainly associated with poor air quality, lack of wind ventilation in a macro context of a high-rise city as well as the micro context within the residential units or apartments.",
