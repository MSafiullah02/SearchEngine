            "text": "The role of response gene to complement (RGC)-32 as a cell cycle regulator has been attributed to its ability to activate cdc2 kinases and to induce S-phase entry and mitosis. However, recent studies revealed novel functions for RGC-32 in diverse processes such as cellular differentiation, inflammation, and fibrosis. Besides responding to C5b-9 stimulation, RGC-32 expression is also induced by growth factors, hormones, and cytokines. Transforming growth factor \u03b2 activates RGC-32 through Smad and RhoA signaling, thus initiating smooth muscle cell differentiation. Accumulating evidence has drawn attention to the deregulated expression of RGC-32 in human malignancies, hyper-immunoglobulin E syndrome, and fibrosis. RCG-32 expression is up-regulated in cutaneous T cell lymphoma and colon, ovarian, and breast cancer, but down-regulated in invasive prostate cancer, multiple myeloma, and drug-resistant glioblastoma. A better understanding of the mechanism by which RGC-32 contributes to the pathogenesis of these diseases will provide new insights into its therapeutic potential. In this review we provide an overview of this field and discuss the most recent research on RGC-32.",

The human RGC-32 gene is located on chromosome 13 and encodes a 137-amino-acid protein with 92% similarity to both the rat and mouse proteins [3] . RGC-32 mRNA is abundantly expressed in the placenta, skeletal muscle, kidney, pancreas, liver, and aortic endothelial cells [3] . RGC-32 is weakly expressed in the heart and brain, and is not expressed in the lungs [3] . The RGC-32 protein has been detected in human brain, heart, and liver by Western blotting [3] .",

Its expression is significantly higher in human embryonic stem cells cultured in serum-containing medium than in those grown in serum-replacement medium [41] .

CKIs function as negative regulators of the cell cycle and inhibit cyclin-CDK activity. CDK4-cyclin D1 and CDK6-cyclin D1 are involved in the progression to G1 in response to growth factor stimulation, while CDK2--cyclin E controls the G1/S transition. Cyclin A associates with CDK2 and regulates S-phase entry and DNA replication. Accumulation of CDC2-cyclin B1 and complexes during G2 enables the cell to enter mitosis [40] . Sublytic C5b-9 induces cell cycle activation together with an increase in CDK4, CDK2, CDC2 [31, 37] , and RGC-32 expression [3, 15] . RGC-32 has been found to act as a substrate and regulator of CDC2 activity [3] . RGC-32 directly binds to CDC2 and up-regulates its kinase activity, as demonstrated in vitro by glutathione S-transferase pull-down assays and in vivo by immunoprecipitation and Western blotting. The phosphorylation of RGC-32 at Thr-91 is critical to its ability to stimulate CDC2-kinase activity [3] .",

Overexpression of the protein in human aortic smooth muscle cells leads to S-phase and G2/M entry in unstimulated cells (cultured in serum-and growth factorfree medium), and exposure to C5b-9 further increases the G2/M progression. These data indicate that RGC-32 is able to induce S-phase entry and mitosis in smooth muscle cells and that C5b-9-mediated activation of the cell cycle may be dependent on the induction of RGC-32 and its effects on CDC2-kinase [3] (Fig. 2) .",

RGC-32 mRNA levels were determined by Northern blotting. As a control, normal human serum treated with K76 COONa (C5D) was used to block C5 cleavage and C5b-9 assembly. B -densitometric scanning was performed to determine the RGC-32 expression with respect to actin. Serum C5b-9 and FBS were able to induce a significant increase in RGC-32 mRNA expression, while a small increase was induced by C5D.

[32] on testis-specific protein Y-encoded (TSPY), a repeat gene mapped to the oncogenic gonadoblastoma locus on the Y chromosome that enhances cellular proliferation in vitro and carcinogenesis in vivo. They found that ectopic expression of the TSPY gene shortens the G2/M transition and up-regulates RGC-32 mRNA expression as well as other pro-growth genes and oncogenes, while it down-regulates cell cycle inhibitors [32] . The results of another gene array study has also indicated that a gene homologous to RGC-32 (Olrfe14k04) is highly expressed during the early stage of fin regeneration and blastema formation in the medaka (Oryzias latipes), a teleost fish [26] . In addition, RGC-32 mRNA expression has been shown to increase during pancreatic tissue regeneration after pancreactomy [29] . Increased levels of RGC-32 mRNA have been found during the structural and functional remodeling that takes place in the cardiac tissue when a left ventricular assist device support is implanted in congestive heart failure patients [6] . As part of this gene signature, RGC-32 was found to be up-regulated together with several genes that are related to the phosphatidylinostol 3-kinase/forkhead protein-signaling pathway and are important for cell cycle activation [6] . In addition, RGC-32 was also found to be up-regulated as part of the gene expression signature in exercise-induced cardiac hypertrophy in rats [44] . Taken together, these data suggest that RGC-32 plays an important role in regeneration and remodeling. It is noteworthy that RGC-32 expression has been found to be down-regulated in fibroblasts obtained from older human individuals as compared with younger ones [27] , suggesting that the RGC-32 level decreases during senescence. We have shown that SP600125 (a JNK MAPK inhibitor) and PD98059 (an MEK1 inhibitor) inhibit RGC-32 mRNA expression in human aortic endothelial cells (Fig. 3) . The involvement of the MAPK pathway in RGC-32 mRNA regulation is also supported by the results of Viemann et al. [51] , who showed that the p38 MAPK inhibitor SB202190 blocks the basal expression of the RGC-32 gene in human umbilical vein-derived endothelial cells. These data indicate that both JNK and ERK1 are required for the expression of RGC-32 mRNA. Thus RGC-32 may enhance cell proliferation by activating CDKs such as CDC2 and by inducing S-phase entry and mitosis.",

In an attempt to identify downstream targets of transforming growth factor (TGF)-\u03b2-induced smooth muscle cell differentiation, Li et al. [28] performed a microarray analysis of TGF-\u03b2-treated neural crest cells and found that RGC-32 expression was markedly increased (50--fold) after 24 h of treatment. Furthermore, RGC-32 knockdown with siRNA resulted in the inhibition of three smooth muscle cell marker genes: \u03b1-SMA, SM22\u03b1, and calponin. In contrast, overexpression of RGC-32 in neural crest cells and pluripotent C3H10T1/2 stem cells enhanced the TGF-\u03b2-induced promoter activities of \u03b1-SMA, SM22\u03b1, and SM-MHC. Since both Smad and RhoA signaling are necessary for TGF-\u03b2-induced smooth muscle cell differentiation from neural crest cells, the authors proposed the following model for the role of RGC-32 in smooth muscle cell differentiation: TGF-\u03b2 activates Smad and RhoA signaling, which stimulates RGC-32; RGC-32 switches on smooth muscle gene transcription and thereby initiates the differentiation of these cells [28] .",

NUP98--HOXA9 is a chimeric protein that results from a t(7;11)(p15;p15) chromosomal translocation and is thought to be involved in the pathogenesis of leukemia. When expressed in human CD34 + cells by retroviral transduction, it has a biphasic effect: it produces an initial phase of early growth suppression, followed by induction of long-term proliferation and, most importantly, impaired differentiation. In this late phase, Takeda et al. [47] noted the repression of several putative tumor suppressors and observed that the expression of genes involved in hematopoietic differentiation, including RGC-32, was equally suppressed.",

RGC-32 expression has been found to be up-regulated in colon [16] , ovarian [13] , breast [16, 25] , and prostate [16] cancers and cutaneous T cell lymphoma [19] (Table 2 ). In patients with colon cancer, higher RGC-32 levels have been found in tumor tissue than in normal adjacent tissue [16] . However, it has also been reported that RGC-32 mRNA expression is lower in advanced stages of primary astrocytomas [39] . The same group has also reported that RGC-32 transcription is directly regulated by p53 in glioblastoma/ astrocytoma, osteoblastic, and colon cancer cell lines. Overexpression of RGC-32 in tumor cell lines was found to result in delayed G2/M progression when compared with that in control cells. RGC-32 was localized to the cytoplasm of tumor cells during interphase and concentrated in the centrosomes and spindle poles during prometaphase and metaphase. Furthermore, RGC-32 was seen to form a complex with polo-like kinase 1 (Plk1) during mitosis and was phosphorylated by Plk1, suggesting that it might negatively regulate the cell cycle [39] . These data suggest that RGC-32 can form complexes not only with CDC2, but also with Plk1 and that the effect on the cell cycle is dependent on the kinase to which it binds in the cell.",

            "text": "Our immunohistochemical studies of a large number of tumor tissues [16] have indicated that RGC-32 is expressed in prostate, bladder, breast, lung, and digestive tract tumors [16] . RGC-32 protein was present in 70% of the colon carcinoma samples tested. Two major patterns of immunoreactivity were noted in colon tumors: in some tumors, reactivity was limited only to the malignant epithelial cells, whereas in others, both malignant epithelial cells and interstitial cells were positive for RGC-32 staining. In most of the neoplastic colon epithelium, RGC-32 was co-localized with the cell cycle activation marker Ki-67. Interestingly, the RGC--32 protein was absent from normal colon epithelial cells that were adjacent to the tumor [16] . This increased RGC-32 protein expression in tumors compared with normal tissue argues against its proposed tumor-suppressing role [39, 46] . It is possible, however, that RGC-32 can play a role in cell proliferation and also work as a tumor suppressor gene in certain types of cancers. RGC-32 was found to be subjected to epigenetic silencing in the Ishikawa endometrial cancer cell line [46] . RGC-32 mRNA expression was induced after 5-Aza-CdR (demethylating agent) and SAHA (histone deacetylase inhibitor) treatment. CpG islands were found within the RGC-32 promoter region, but methylation of the promoter was not detected. Conflicting data have been presented concerning the effect of p53 on RGC-32 expression. While Saigusa et al. [39] have reported an increased expression of RGC-32 after treatment with adriamycin in p53 +/+ (HCT116 cells) but not in p53 -/-HCT116 cells, others have found the RGC-32 gene to be overexpressed (as are cyclin E1, cyclin E2, and cyclin G2) in irinotecan-treated p53-mutant SW620 colon cancer cells [43] . In addition, RGC-32 is one of the genes that have been found to be up-regulated after K-ras transformation of normal enterocytes [38] . In vivo, K-ras transformation occurs late in colon carcinogenesis and enables the transition from small to large adeno- mas. Other studies using gene microarrays have shown changes in the expression of RGC-32 mRNA in tumors ( Table 2 ). These studies have indicated that RGC-32 mRNA expression was down-regulated in some tumors, such as high-grade prostate intraepithelial neoplasia, invasive prostate cancer [33] , multiple myeloma [54] , and drug-resistant glioblastoma [7] , but up-regulated in others, including ovarian [13] and breast [11] cancer and cutaneous T cell lymphoma [19] . Similarly, studies of RGC-32 mRNA expression in various metastatic cancers have yielded different results: RGC-32 was shown to be up-regulated in breast cancer with osteolytic metastasis [25] , but down-regulated in androgen-resistant metastatic prostate cancer [9] and metastatic liver carcinoma [20] . In addition, RGC-32 was found to be preferentially expressed in micrometastases (lesions smaller than 1 mm) compared with the macrometastases of small-cell lung cancer [24] .",

Using microarray analysis, they identified 33 genes that were up-regulated in unstimulated CD14 + cells of HIES patients compared with those of healthy patients. Among these genes, RGC-32 was the most highly expressed, suggesting that analysis of RGC-32 expression levels would be helpful in diagnosing HIES, even if the reason for this relationship between the up-regulated expression of RGC-32 and the pathogenesis of HIES is still unclear [49] .",

Stimulation of the pancreatic rat insulinoma cell line (RINm5F) with high doses of IL-1\u03b2 was found to induce a down-regulation of RGC-32 mRNA, while the expression of complement component C9, C3, and complement C4b-binding protein genes was increased at 24 h [34] . Similarly, RGC-32 has been identified as one of the genes that are down--regulated in interferon-\u03b12b-treated peripheral blood mononuclear cells [50] .",
