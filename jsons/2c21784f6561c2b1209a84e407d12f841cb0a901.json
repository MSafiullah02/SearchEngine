Modeling showed that an initial D-Dimer value of 1.65 \uf06dg/ml could distinguish between those that would survive and those that would not. Given these data, we would suggest that D-Dimer be factored in the decision-making algorithm of whom to dismiss from the ED. In the Richardson study 2.2% were readmitted within 3 days, although follow-up time was short at 4.5 days (11) . Examining the D-Dimer of these patients before discharge may enable us to make more informed decisions. There is anecdotal evidence that thrombotic events may occur in COVID patients post-discharge; following D-Dimers might be a way to distinguish who should get prolonged thromboprophylaxis.",

We do not yet have an idea of the temporal changes in D-Dimer with COVID nor do we know whether these change with anticoagulation. Both are the subject of ongoing research. Our data do not show any differences in outcome but this is from a very small cohort on anticoagulation. Despite many protocols, the effect of anticoagulation on mortality with COVID is uncertain with only a few reports showing that there may be a benefit. Indeed, even the effect of anticoagulation in the symptomatic thromboses/vessel occlusion associated with COVID is unclear (15) . It may be that this disease presents with more of a thrombotic microangiopathy (TMA) picture and may be more amenable to TMA therapeutics. Studies are ongoing looking at therapies with anticoagulation, anti-complement, fibrinolysis (16) . Should elevations in D-Dimer without evidence of pathology be treated is open to debate. Given the strength of D-Dimer as a predictor of mortality, future studies should focus on establishing guidelines on how to use D-Dimer trending in different settings to better predict mortality, monitor disease progression and response to treatment.",
