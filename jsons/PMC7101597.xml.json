When the practitioners changed the simple face mask to allow bag-mask ventilation during the induction of anesthesia, a patient cough was simulated. We did this by using Glo Germ\u2122 powder (Marlatek, Inc., Brockville, ON, Canada), a product designed to identify the simulated spread of microorganisms, which was brushed as powder onto the mannequin (contact) and forcefully expelled from the airway mannequin\u2019s naris using a MAD Nasal\u2122 intranasal mucosal atomization device (Teleflex, Morrisville, NC, USA) (droplet). Spread of the simulated nasal secretions was visualized with ultraviolet light.",

During the fifth simulation, an airway assistant wearing a disposable Association for the Advancement of Medical Instrumentation (AAMI) level-3 surgical gown (Sirus sterile nonreinforced surgical gown; Medline, Chicago, IL, USA) showed no contamination of scrubs beneath the gown. It also came to our attention that there was a significant amount of contamination on the practitioner\u2019s neck, on the base of their wrist, as well as on their lower pants and shoes.",

We now use high-cuff (9\u201312 cm) gloves, either non-sterile nitrile gloves or surgical gloves, and double glove. Neck contamination was almost eliminated after this change. Hand and forearm contamination was reduced by encouraging removal of rings and a full 20 sec surgical scrub style of cleaning with an alcohol-based hand rub at each step of the doffing process. Shoe and lower leg contamination was reduced by using the coverall with booties. We also have a surgical gown with knee-high booties as an alternative. Above all, it made practitioners aware that, despite meticulous donning and doffing, contamination is still highly possible and that a shower after an aerosol-generating medical procedure is very prudent.",
