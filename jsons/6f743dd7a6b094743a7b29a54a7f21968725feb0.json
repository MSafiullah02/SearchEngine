            "text": "Since the start of the COVID-19 pandemic, an unprecedented number of genomic sequences of the causative virus (SARS-CoV-2) have been publicly released. The resulting volume of available genetic data presents a unique opportunity to gain real-time insights into the pandemic, but also a daunting computational hurdle if analysed with gold-standard phylogeographic methods. We here describe and apply an analytical pipeline that is a compromise between fast and rigorous analytical steps. As a proof of concept, we focus on Belgium, one of the countries with the highest spatial density of sequenced SARS-CoV-2 genomes. At the global scale, our analyses confirm the importance of external introduction events in establishing transmission chains in the country. At the country scale, our spatially-explicit phylogeographic analyses highlight an impact of the national lockdown of mid-March on the dispersal velocity of viral lineages. Our pipeline has the potential to be quickly applied to other countries or regions, with key benefits in complementing epidemiological analyses in assessing the impact of intervention measures or their progressive easement.",

We here describe and apply an analytical pipeline that is a compromise between fast and rigorous analytical steps. As a proof of concept, we focus on Belgium, one of the countries with the highest spatial density of sequenced SARS-CoV-2 genomes. At the global scale, our analyses confirm the importance of external introduction events in establishing transmission chains in the country. At the country scale, our spatially-explicit phylogeographic analyses highlight an impact of the national lockdown of mid-March on the dispersal velocity of viral lineages. Our pipeline has the potential to be quickly applied to other countries or regions, with key benefits in complementing epidemiological analyses in assessing the impact of intervention measures or their progressive easement.",

Since the early days of the pandemic, there has been an important mobilisation of the scientific community to understand its epidemiology and help providing a real-time response.

In particular, our objective is to investigate the evolution of the circulation dynamics through time and assess the impact of lockdown measures on spatial transmission.

We then ran a preliminary discrete phylogeographic analysis along this tree to identify internal nodes and descending clades that likely correspond to distinct introductions into the Belgian territory ( Fig. 1, S2 ). We inferred a minimum number of 166 introduction events (95% HPD interval = [161-171]). When compared to the number of sequences sampled in Belgium (391), this number illustrates the relative importance of external introductions in establishing transmission chains in the country. Introduction events resulted in distinct clades (or \"clusters\") linking varying numbers of sampled sequences (Fig. 1) . However, most clusters (127 out of 165) only consisted of one sampled sequence. According to the time-scaled phylogenetic tree and discrete phylogeographic reconstruction (Fig. S1 ), some of these introduction events could have occurred before the return of carnival holidays (around the 1 st of 1 month A cluster is here defined as a phylogenetic clade likely corresponding to a distinct introduction into the study area (Belgium). We delineated these clusters by performing a simplistic discrete phylogeographic reconstruction along the Nextstrain tree while only considering two potential ancestral locations: Belgium and outside Belgium. We identified a minimum number of 165 lineage introductions (95% HPD interval = [155-177]), which gives the relative importance of external introduction considering the number of sequences currently sampled in Belgium (391). On the tree, lineages circulating in Belgium are highlighted in green, and green nodes correspond to the most ancestral node of each Belgian cluster. See Figure S1 for a non-circular visualisation of the same tree, and Figure S2 for a first exploration of the spatial distribution of Belgian clusters.

Here, we looked at these movement vectors to assess if the dispersal velocity of lineages was impacted by the national lockdown, of which the main measures were implemented on March 18 th , 2020. When inspecting the duration of and geographic distance covered by lineages, our analysis revealed that fast long-distance dispersal events mainly occurred before the lockdown (Fig. 2) . This overall pattern could, at least in part, result from the relatively lower sampling effort currently available at the country-scale for the lockdown time period. However, we further confirmed this trend by looking at the spatially-explicit phylogeographic reconstruction in itself (Fig. 3A) and estimates of the lineage dispersal velocity through time (Fig. 3B) : while the lineage dispersal velocity was globally higher at the early phase of the Belgian epidemic, which corresponds to the week following the returns from carnival holidays, it then seemed to reach a plateau before further decreasing around the end of April.

To assess the effect of such potential sequencing errors, we have repeated all the analyses after having discarded 21 tip branches associated with Belgian sequences carrying such suspicious homoplasies (C3130T, A4050C, T8022G, T13402G, C27046T, T28785G). Our results are however fully consistent with the analyses performed on the entire data set. Directly starting from inference results kept up to date by a platform like Nextstrain allows for fast analytical processing but also relies on newly deposited data that could sometimes carry potential errors, as we have investigated here for specific sequences that were generated in Belgium. To remedy such potentially challenging situations, our proposed pipeline could be extended with a sequence data resource component that makes uses of expert knowledge regarding a particular virus. The GLUE 16 software package allows new sequences to be systematically checked for potential issues, and could hence be an efficient tool to safely work with frequently updated SARS-CoV-2 sequencing data. Such a \"CoV-GLUE\" resource is currently being developed (http://cov-glue.cvr.gla.ac.uk/#/home).",

These RNA extracts were provided by the National Reference Center for Coronaviruses and UZ Leuven. Reverse transcription was carried out via SuperScript IV and cDNA was posteriorly amplified using Q5 R High-Fidelity DNA Polymerase (NEB) with the ARTIC nCov-2019 primers and following the recommendations in the sequencing protocol of the ARTIC Network (https://artic.network/ncov-2019). Samples were multiplexed following the manufacturer's recommendations using the Oxford Nanopore Native Barcoding Expansion kits NBD104 (1) (2) (3) (4) (5) (6) (7) (8) (9) (10) (11) (12) and NBD114 (13) (14) (15) (16) (17) (18) (19) (20) (21) (22) (23) (24) , in conjunction with Ligation Sequencing Kit 109 (Oxford Nanopore Preliminary discrete phylogeographic analysis. We performed a preliminary phylogeographic analysis using the discrete diffusion model 10 implemented in the software package BEAST 1.10 12 . The objective of this first analysis was to identify independent introduction events of SARS-CoV-2 lineages into Belgium. To this end, we used the Nextstrain tree as a fixed empirical tree and only considered two possible ancestral locations: Belgium and outside Belgium. Bayesian inference through Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) was run on this empirical tree for 10 6 generations and sampled every 1,000 generations. MCMC convergence and mixing properties were inspected using the program Tracer 1.7 19 to ensure that effective sample size (ESS) values associated with estimated parameters were all >200. After having discarded 10% of sampled trees as burn-in, a maximum clade credibility (MCC) tree was obtained using TreeAnnotator 1.10 12 . We used the resulting MCC tree to delineate Belgian clusters here defined as phylogenetic clades corresponding to independent introduction events in Belgium.",

We used the continuous diffusion model 11 available in BEAST 1.10 12 to perform a spatially-explicit (or \"continuous\") phylogeographic reconstruction of the dispersal history of SARS-CoV-2 lineages in Belgium. We employed a relaxed random walk (RRW) diffusion model to generate a posterior distribution of trees whose internal nodes are associated with geographic coordinates 11 . Specifically, we used a Cauchy distribution to model the among-branch heterogeneity in diffusion velocity. We performed a distinct continuous phylogeographic reconstruction for each Belgian clade identified by the initial discrete phylogeographic inference, again fixing a Nextstrain subtree as an empirical tree. As phylogeographic inference under the continuous diffusion model does not allow identical sampling coordinates assigned to the tips of the tree, we avoided assigning sampling coordinates using the centroid point of each administrative area of origin. For a given sampled sequence, we instead retrieved geographic coordinates from a point randomly sampled within the administrative area of origin, which is the maximal level of spatial precision in available metadata. This approach avoids using the common \"jitter\" option that adds a restricted amount of noise to duplicated sampling coordinates. Using such a jitter could be problematic because it can move sampling coordinates to administrative areas neighbouring their actual administrative area of origin 20 . Furthermore, the administrative areas considered here are municipalities and are rather small (there are currently 581 municipalities in Belgium). The clade-specific continuous phylogeographic reconstructions were only based on Belgian tip nodes for which the municipality of origin was known, i.e. 380 out of 391 genomic sequences. Furthermore, we only performed a continuous phylogeographic inference for Belgian clades linking a minimum of three tip nodes with a known sampling location (municipality). Each Markov chain was run for 10 6 generations and sampled every 1,000 generations. As with the discrete phylogeographic inference, MCMC convergence/mixing properties were assessed with Tracer, and MCC trees (one per clade) were obtained with TreeAnnotator after discarding 10% of sampled trees as burn-in. We then used functions available in the R package \"seraphim\" 21, 22 to extract spatiotemporal information embedded within the same 1,000 posterior trees and visualise the continuous phylogeographic reconstructions. We also used \"seraphim\" to estimate the following weighted lineage dispersal velocity, where d i and t i are the geographic distance travelled (great-circle distance in km) and the time elapsed (in days) on each phylogeny branch, respectively:",

For each clade, we mapped the maximum clade credibility (MCC) tree and overall 80% highest posterior density (HPD) regions reflecting the uncertainty related to the phylogeographic inference. MCC trees and 80% HPD regions are based on 1,000 trees subsampled from each post burn-in posterior distribution. MCC tree nodes were coloured according to their time of occurrence, and 80% HPD regions were computed for successive time layers and then superimposed using the same colour scale reflecting time. Continuous phylogeographic reconstructions were only performed along Belgian clades linking at least three sampled sequences for which the geographic origin was known (see the Methods section for further details). Besides the phylogenetic branches of MCC trees obtained by continuous phylogeographic inference, we also mapped sampled sequences belonging to clades linking less than three geo-referenced sequences. Furthermore, when a clade only gathers two geo-referenced sequences, we highlighted the phylogenetic link between these two sequences with a dashed curve connecting them.Sub-national province borders are represented by white lines.
