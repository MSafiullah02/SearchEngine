Among the RBPs present in the Arabidopsis genome are 197 proteins with an RNA recognition motif (RRM), the most abundant type of RNA-binding domain, and 28 K homology (KH) domain proteins first identified in mammalian heterogeneous nuclear protein hnRNP K (Silverman et al. 2013). In addition, 26 Pumilio (PUM) domain proteins, nine DEAD-box helicases as well as five proteins with cold shock domains (CSDs) have been identified (Silverman et al. 2013). Another 450 proteins harbor pentatricopeptide repeat (PPR) domains. PPR domains consist of multiple 35-amino acid repeats of which two are known to be engaged in specific RNA recognition (Barkan and Small 2014). These proteins are imported into mitochondria or chloroplasts and regulate all aspects of RNA metabolism, e.g., RNA editing, splicing, RNA cleavage, and translation in organelles (Schmitz-Linneweber and Small 2008; Barkan and Small 2014).",

At the biochemical level, an impact of defined RBPs on RNA processing including pre-mRNA splicing, 3\u2032 end processing, processing of microRNA precursors, and translation has been described (Lopato et al. 1999; Simpson et al. 2003; Vazquez et al. 2004; Dong et al. 2008; Stauffer et al. 2010; Ren et al. 2012; R\u00fchl et al. 2012; Juntawong et al. 2013; Sorenson and Bailey-Serres 2014; Staiger 2015; Carvalho et al. 2016). Recent attempts to comprehensively identify RBPs, summarized in Sect. 2, provided experimental evidence for RNA binding for most of the previously identified Arabidopsis RBPs and identified a plethora of proteins with noncanonical RBDs.",

In protein-centric approaches, the focus is laid on a particular RBP. The RNA complement associated with the RBP of interest, the ribonome, is identified via immunoprecipitation of the RBP from cell lysates and identification of the bound target RNAs, initially by microarrays (Tenenbaum et al. 2000; Galgano and Gerber 2011; Guerreiro et al. 2014) or more recently via high throughput sequencing (Licatalosi et al. 2008; K\u00f6nig et al. 2010; Rossbach et al. 2014; M\u00fcller-McNicoll et al. 2016) (Fig. 1b).\n",

The second class comprised 70 proteins with a known RBD. For 41 of them, a role in mRNA binding and RNA biology had already been described while the remaining proteins had a potential role in mRNA processing. Moreover, 12 of the RBPs in the second class overlapped with the RBPs identified in the native oligo(dT) affinity chromatography approach (Schmidt et al. 2010). The third class comprised 132 candidate RBPs. Of these, 49 were metabolic enzymes, mainly oxidoreductases. Moreover, numerous proteins related to photosynthesis were found. As these are generally strongly expressed, their RNA binding activity and the domains involved beg for an independent validation. One of the enzymes was the Arabidopsis ortholog of phosphoglycerate kinase whose RNA binding capacity has previously been validated in yeast and human cells (Beckmann et al. 2015).",

Among novel RBPs were proteins harboring a YT521-B homology (YTH) domain (Li et al. 2014). YTH domain proteins have been shown to bind N6 methyladenosine and thus serve as readers of the m6A mark in mammals (Wang et al. 2014). In addition, Alba domain containing proteins have been identified. Alba domain proteins are well characterized in archaebacteria where they act as transcriptional repressors and in other eukaryotes where they control translation (Goyal et al. 2016). In plants, they have not yet been functionally characterized. The only observation pointing to RNA binding is the recovery of an Arabidopsis Alba domain protein by RNA-affinity chromatography (Gosai et al. 2015). WHIRLY domain containing proteins have been characterized as single-stranded DNA binding proteins in organelles (Krause et al. 2009) and in maize, association of a WHIRLY protein with chloroplast transcripts has been observed (Prikryl et al. 2008). The identification of three WHIRLY proteins in the etiolated seedling interactome (Reichel et al. 2016) and of WHIRLY1 upon oligo(dT) affinity chromatography in Arabidopsis cells (Schmidt et al. 2010) now provides evidence for global in vivo RNA binding.",

High throughput sequencing (HITS)-CLIP of HLP1 fused to GFP and expressed under control of the strong, constitutive Cauliflower Mosaic Virus 35S RNA promoter identified above 5500 transcripts bound in vivo (Zhang et al. 2015). When endogenous HLP1 protein was precipitated by a specific antibody, 6850 transcripts bound in vivo were detected with an overlap of above 3000 transcripts to the HLP1-GFP precipitation. The prevalence of cross-linked regions near polyadenylation sites provoked the hypothesis that HLP1 may control polyadenylation. Indeed, in more than 2000 transcripts the distal polyadenylation site was preferred over the proximal polyadenylation site in hlp1 mutant plants. Around 19% of these transcripts were also recovered by HLP1 HITS-CLIP, pointing to a role for HLP1 in the control of alternative polyadenylation, at least partly by direct binding. In line with this, MEME motifs overrepresented in the cross-link regions, namely A-rich (5\u2032-AGAAAA-3\u2032) and U-rich (5\u2032-UUUUCU-3\u2032) motifs, resembled motifs enriched in the vicinity of the poly(A) site, 5\u2032-AAAGAAAA-3\u2032 and 5\u2032-UGUUUC-3\u2032. The presence of cross-link regions in other parts of the transcripts apart from the 3\u2032 untranslated region (UTR) suggests that HLP1 may also affect other aspects of pre-mRNA processing in addition to polyadenylation.",

In both, the AtGRP7 overexpressors or the mutant, a similar number of transcripts was expressed at elevated or reduced levels compared to wild-type plants. Notably, significantly more differentially expressed iCLIP targets were downregulated in AtGRP7-overexpressors than upregulated. In turn, more of the differentially expressed AtGRP7 iCLIP targets were expressed at elevated in the mutant than at reduced levels. This indicates a predominantly negative effect of AtGRP7 on its targets. Among the targets were more circadianly regulated transcripts than expected. In particular, elevated AtGRP7 levels lead to damping of circadian oscillations of target transcripts including DORMANCY/AUXIN ASSOCIATED FAMILY PROTEIN2 and CCR-LIKE. This conforms with the idea that the circadian clock regulated AtGRP7 functions as a molecular slave oscillator, conveying temporal information from the core circadian clock within the cell (Rudolf et al. 2004). In addition, changes in splicing patterns were observed for iCLIP and RIP-seq targets upon misexpression of AtGRP7, confirming a role for AtGRP7 in the control of alternative splicing.",

Genes upregulated in the sr45-1 mutant are enriched for defense response genes. Indeed, the sr45-1 mutant was more resistant to bacterial and fungal pathogens. Of 68 upregulated defense response genes in sr45-1, 10 were SARs. Thus, SR45 has an additional role as a negative regulator of plant immunity.",

Determination of potential SR45 binding sites in inflorescence SARs uncovered an overrepresentation of the purine-rich motifs GGNGG, GNGGA, and GNGGNNG. Importantly, GGNGG and related motifs are enriched in introns and exons that are alternatively spliced in the sr45-1 mutant, irrespective of the splicing event is favored or suppressed by SR45. This led to the suggestion that SR45 identifies regions for alternative splicing and acts as a facilitator for other splicing factors.

Both RIP-seq data sets nevertheless strengthen SR45\u2019s key role as an important splicing factor in Arabidopsis.

The cpRNPs comprise an acidic domain and two RRMs. They are encoded in the nucleus and imported into chloroplasts. Mutants in distinct cpRNPs are widely affected in processing of transcripts in the chloroplast, leading to defects in chloroplast development and, consequently, plant performance owing to the essential role of the chloroplast in photosynthetic energy (Ruwe et al. 2011). For example, mutants deficient in CP29A (29 kDa chloroplast protein A) and CP31A (31 kDa chloroplast protein A) showed gross defects at low ambient temperature. RIP performed with antibodies against the endogenous proteins and subsequent hybridization of coprecipitated RNAs on tiling arrays covering the Arabidopsis chloroplast genome (RIP-Chip) showed that CP29A and CP31A associate with large overlapping sets of chloroplast transcripts including strong enrichment for psbB, psbD, psaA/B, atpB, ndhB and intermediate enrichment for almost all chloroplast mRNAs (Kupsch et al. 2012). Both CP29A and CP31A are required for accumulation of chloroplast mRNAs under cold stress. Furthermore, binding of CP31A to 3\u2032 ends of certain transcripts serves to protect these transcripts against 3\u2032 exonuclease activity (Kupsch et al. 2012). Together with the known role of CP31A in RNA (Tillich et al. 2009) this points to multiple functions in posttranscriptional regulation in chloroplasts.",

(a) RNA-centric strategies such as mRNA interactome capture employ oligo(dT) affinity capture. RNA and bound proteins are covalently linked in planta through UV irradiation. RNA\u2013protein complexes are recovered by oligo(dT) pull-down. Proteins are released by RNase treatment, subjected to tryptic digest and identified via mass spectrometry. (b) Protein-centric methods focus on a particular RBP and aim at identifying its in vivo RNA targets. Based on the cross-linking agent, RIP using formaldehyde or CLIP technique using UV light are distinguished. Proteins are immunoprecipitated. In RIP-seq cross-links are reversed by heat treatment, RNA is isolated, subjected to reverse transcription and PCR amplification for HITS. Targets enriched upon RIP are determined relative to mock IP controls, e.g., Xing et al. 2015, or relative to polyadenylated RNA, e.g., Meyer et al. 2017. In iCLIP (K\u00f6nig et al. 2010), RNA\u2013protein complexes are subjected to RNase treatment. Bound proteins are digested with proteinase, leaving a polypeptide at the cross-link site. Reverse transcriptase stops there, allowing the detection of the cross-link site at the \u22121 position of the processed sequencing reads",

(a) To identify protein binding sites, i.e., sites that are protected from RNase digestion by interacting proteins (PPS), samples are treated with an RNase specific for double-stranded RNA (left) or for single-stranded RNA (right). Subsequently, proteins are denatured, leaving either target sites for proteins with a preference for single-stranded regions (left), or target sites for proteins with a preference for double-stranded regions (right). These sequences are used to generate libraries for HITS. (b) To determine the RNA secondary structure, proteins are denatured in a first step. Subsequently, samples are treated with RNase specific for double-stranded RNA (left) or for single-stranded RNA (right). Again, libraries for HITS are prepared. Collectively, motifs that are enriched in the samples used to determine protein binding sites compared to the samples used for structure determination are in vivo target sites of RBDs",
