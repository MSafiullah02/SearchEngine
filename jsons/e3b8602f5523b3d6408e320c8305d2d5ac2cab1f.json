Infected cells can spread viruses directly into the surrounding air (primary aerosolization) or to fluids and surfaces, which can become sources for airborne transmission (secondary aerosolization). Secondary aerosolization can occur for any virus, predominantly when air displacements or movements around contaminated surfaces or fluids disperse the viruses into the air. It can also occur by liquid splashes, which can aerosolize viruses in liquids or on surfaces. In fact, almost any kind of disturbance of infected organisms or materials, even the bursting of foam in seawater, can produce airborne, virus-laden particles (Aller et al., 2005) . Virus-laden particles are a complex mixture of various components (salts, proteins, and other organic and inorganic matter, including virus particles). The size of the viral particle itself does not rule the airborne particle size. The influence of viruses alone on the granulometric distribution of aerosols is likely negligible compared to that of the remainder of the aerosol. It was demonstrated that the particle size distribution of artificially produced submicrometer and ultrafine aerosols of culture media is not affected by the presence of bacteriophages (Hogan et al., 2005) .",

A similar occurrence has also been reported for a hotel restaurant (Marks et al., 2003) . A retrospective cohort study conducted after a severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) epidemic in Hong Kong in 2003 suggested that airborne spread may have played an important role in the transmission of the disease. The same mode of transmission was also hypothesized in other studies of SARS (Li et al., 2005 . Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) is an illness caused by a virus Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus (MERS-CoV). Most MERS patients developed severe acute respiratory illness with symptoms of fever, cough and shortness of breath. About 3 to 4 out of every 10 patients reported with MERS have died. The disease was first reported in Saudi Arabia in September 2012. Later retrospective studies identified that the first known cases of MERS occurred in Jordan in April 2012. So far, all cases of MERS have been linked through travel to, or residence in, countries in and near the Arabian Peninsula. The largest known outbreak of MERS outside the Arabian Peninsula occurred in the Republic of Korea in 2015. The outbreak was associated with a traveler returning from the Arabian Peninsula. MERS-CoV, like other coronaviruses, is thought to spread from an infected person's respiratory secretions, such as through coughing. However, the precise ways the virus spreads are not currently well understood (https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/mers/, (2017)).",

Pontiac fever symptoms are primarily fever and muscle aches; it is a milder infection than legionnaires' disease. Symptoms begin between a few hours to 3 days after being exposed to the bacteria and usually last less than a week. Pontiac fever is different from legionnaires' disease because someone with Pontiac fever does not have pneumonia necessarily (Correia et al., 2016) .",

Guidelines for reducing the risk of Legionella growth and spread are available for those who maintain and manage building water systems, including systems for potable (water for drinking and showering), non-potable, and recreational water from ASHRAE (ASHRAE Guideline 2000; ASHRAE Standard, 2015).",
