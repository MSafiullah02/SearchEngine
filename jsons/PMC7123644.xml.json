Endotoxin is recognized through toll-like receptor-4 as a pathogen-associated molecular component that activates macrophages and other leukocytes to produce various inflammatory mediators. Endotoxin plays a major role in the development of toxic symptoms in Gram-negative bacterial infections. A recent review showed that co-detection of Gram-negative bacteria and endotoxemia is strongly predictive of increased risk of mortality compared to detection of neither [1]. It is therefore a reasonable therapeutic approach to evaluate and remove circulating endotoxin in the blood of patients with Gram-negative bacterial infections.",

In 2007, the findings of a meta-analysis demonstrated the favorable effects of PMX [13].

A large RCT, the ABDO-MIX trial in France, has failed to show survival benefit and improvement in organ failure with Toraymyxin treatment compared to conventional treatment of peritonitis-induced septic shock [15]. Recruitment into another large RCT, the EUPHRATES trial in the USA, is now closed and the results showed that polymyxin B hemoperfusion plus conventional medical therapy did not reduce mortality at 28 days in patients with septic shock and high endotoxin activity (Fig. 19.1, ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT01046669).

The detergent-like activity of polymyxin B arises from its ability to prompt the dissociation of endotoxin\u2019s micellar structure [21]. Polymyxin B has been shown to bind to the lipopolysaccharide of Salmonella typhimurium at the negatively charged 2-keto-3-deoxyoctulosonate lipid A region of the lipopolysaccharide molecule. This is achieved via electrostatic, and possibly hydrophobic, interactions at a stoichiometric ratio of one polymyxin B molecule to one lipopolysaccharide monomer unit [22]. Furthermore, Vesentini et al. demonstrated that short-range interactions between polymyxin B and endotoxin are mediated mainly via hydrophobic forces, whereas long-term complex formation is mediated via ionic forces. The interaction energy occurring in each molecular complex was calculated at different intermolecular distances, and the binding forces were estimated by fitting interaction energy data. Maximum binding forces calculated via molecular mechanics for the polymyxin B\u2013endotoxin complex range from 1.39 to 3.79 nN [23].",

These results suggested that polymyxin B-immobilized fibers had a maximal endotoxin detoxification capacity when three primary amino groups were left unbound from the carrier fiber. Furthermore, concentrations of immobilized polymyxin B above 3.5 \u03bcg/mg of fiber were suggested to be optimal.

Although almost all of the studies conducted so far have demonstrated a significant decrease in plasma endotoxin levels following PMX treatment, a recent RCT failed to show such an effect [12].

Indeed, our previous study showed that sensitivity for the detection of endotoxin in the turbidimetric LAL assay was very low (26.9%; 14 of 52 patients) in patients with severe sepsis and septic shock who required PMX treatment [31].

Coagulin spontaneously forms a polymer, and it is this polymer formation that is detected in the turbidimetric LAL assay. Obata et al. reported that by using ESP they were able to detect coagulin particles formed under agitation of the LAL cascade, and that the transferring period of the LAL cascade after endotoxin stimulation depends on the concentration of endotoxin before gelation [34].

We have demonstrated the ability of endotoxin adsorption in longer-duration PMX treatment [36]. Using the ESP method, we observed a reduction in endotoxin after passing through the Toraymyxin column even when PMX duration was greater than 2 h.

However, PMX treatment had beneficial effects by increasing leukocyte expression of these surface antigens [37]. The number of CD16+CD14+ monocytes and the expression level of monocytic toll-like receptor 4 dramatically increase in patients with severe infection, and recent studies have shown that PMX treatment is effective in reducing both of these in patients with septic shock [38]. Moreover, Ono demonstrated that the removal of surplus circulating CD4+CD25+Foxp3+ regulatory T cells in patients with septic shock via hemoperfusion with Toraymyxin might represent a novel strategy for inducing recovery from sepsis-associated immunosuppression [39]. Tsuzuki have demonstrated immediate inhibition of NF-\u03baB binding activity and suppression of TNF-\u03b1 secretion after endotoxin neutralization with polymyxin B regardless of whether the peripheral blood mononuclear cells were already producing TNF-\u03b1 or not [40].

Thirty-six postoperative patients with severe sepsis or septic shock secondary to intra-abdominal infection were randomized to either PMX treatment for 2 h (n = 17) or standard therapy (n = 19). PMX treatment was well tolerated and no significant adverse effects were observed.

Furthermore, the need for continuous renal replacement therapy after study entry was significantly reduced in the PMX group (P = 0.043). There were no statistically significant differences in endotoxin and interleukin six levels, and organ dysfunction as assessed by the Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) score, or 28-day mortality.

The 28-day mortality rate recorded in both groups was significantly lower than that reported in larger studies (between 32.7% and 53% for similar patient cohorts) [51\u201353].

Yokoyama et al. reported a case of severe ARDS caused by novel swine-origin influenza virus (A/H1N1pdm) [64]. The patient underwent PMX, after which her hypoxemia improved and she survived. This is the first report of severe, life-threatening ARDS due to a novel influenza virus in which PMX was beneficial. Yatera et al. reported a case of ARDS due to influenza A infection that was successfully treated with PMX [65]. Kudo et al. has reported cases of severe pneumonia due to highly pathogenic avian influenza A (H5N1) in Vietnam successfully treated with CHDF coupled with Toraymyxin hemoperfusion, suggesting that it is an effective candidate treatment for ARDS due to the H5N1 virus if applied early in the disease [66].",
