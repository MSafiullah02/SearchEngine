Nonetheless, since 1988 representatives of this family have also been described as nitrogen fixing bacteria able to plant growth promotion by a variety of mechanisms. Nitrogen fixation is a biological process that guarantees that the atmospheric N 2 is incorporated into organic matter by several bacterial groups. Most representatives of this group, also known as diazotrophic, are generally associated with soil rhizosphere of many plants and also establishing a more specific association living inside roots, leaves, and others plants tissues as endophyte. Their roles as plant growth-promoting microorganisms are generally related to increase in plant biomass, phosphate and other mineral solubilization, and plant pathogen control. Here, we report many of these plant growth-promoting processes related to nitrogen fixing species already described in Acetobacteraceae family, especially Gluconacetobacter diazotrophicus and their importance to agriculture.

In addition, accessory genes related with nitrogen sensing and metabolism were also studied by sequencing and insertion mutagenesis. At least three copies of genes coding PII-like protein were identified. The copy located upstream to glnA (that codes for glutamine synthetase) was named glnB, because of its homology and conserved organization on many others nitrogen-fixing bacteria. The others PII-like coding genes, glnK1 and glnK2, were located upstream of copies of genes that codes for ammonium or methylammonium transportes, amtB1 and amtB2, respectively [92] . Further characterization of single and double mutants containing gus-fusion suggested that GlnB and GlnK1 are required as positive signals to efficiently relieve repression by GlnK2. In addition, the authors showed that GlnK2 protein clearly has a function different from those of GlnB and GlnK1, since nif gene expression were repressed in glnB glnK1 double mutant under all conditions tested. Based on these studies, the authors suggested that none of the three PII homologs is required for nif gene expression indicating novel regulatory features of G. diazotrophicus PII proteins.

In addition, sodA and katE gene expression correlates with nifD suggesting that reduction of ROS is essential for the homeostasis during respiratory protection and nitrogen fixation in G. diazotrophicus.

In addition, they measured PR genes expression and detected that expression of JA/ET pathway gene increased during wild type-plant interaction, but not to both mutants.

However, the correlation between repression of nifD expression and increase of Asparagine level indicated that genes for an alternative route that converts Asp-tRNA Asn into Asn-tRNA Asn by a glutamine-dependent Asp-tRNA Asn amidotransferase B, encoded by the operon gatCAB, might be present. In fact, in G diazotrophicus the presence of gatCAB operon indicates that the ORF GDI2232 encodes an Aspartyl-tRNA synthetase of ND-AspRS type [113] .

This species is the oldest described and characterization of its agricultural potential to important crops like sugarcane was quite widespread in Brazil and other countries. For the other nitrogen fixing species descriptions of use are rare or no report of agricultural application is available. The use of diazotrophs in agriculture has been explored for over 30 years and its apex in the past century, the decade of 80-90, then the description of G. diazotrophicus. One of the first reports that populations of diazotrophs could be affected by increasing doses of N-fertilizer was made by Vose et al. [158] in sugarcane which showed that high levels of mineral N caused a significant reduction in the acetylene reduction activity, very popular method which measures the indirect activity of the nitrogenase enzyme acting as a competitive inhibitor. This effect was believed to inhibit this enzyme synthesis. In 1993, after the description of G. diazotrophicus, studies conducted in Mexico by Fuentes-Ram \u0131rez et al. [159] reported that the association between G. diazotrophicus and sugarcane could be severely limited by high N-fertilization, which would explain the decrease in acetylene reduction activity. In their study, the crops fertilized with 120 kg N ha \u00c01 showed higher number of isolates than the plots fertilized with 300 kg N ha \u00c01 , levels not applied in Brazil. Muthukumarasamy et al. [160, 161] obtained similar results in India for G. diazotrophicus. They suggest that this effect was not directly related to the presence of high levels of nitrogen fertilizer in sugarcane crop since this bacterium is able to grow and fix nitrogen \"in vitro\" in presence of high concentrations of NO 3 (60 mM). It is more likely that at these high N doses the physiological state of the plant undergoes changes and subsequently influences negatively the population of this organism. Mu\u00f1oz-Rojas and Caballero-Mellado [162] observed a negative effect on G. diazotrophicus population in the presence of high doses of nitrogen appled in sugarcane planted in Mexico. These results were confirmed by Reis Jr. et al. [163] using two sugarcane varieties planted in a sand soil fertilized with 300 kg de N ha \u00c01 in comparison with the control without N application. Only the variety SP792312 presented plant with high levels of total N in the fertilized plots and lower numbers of G. diazotrophicus. Medeiros et al.
