            "text": "Worldwide, the leading causes of death in neonates (birth to 28 days of age) are preterm birth complications, intrapartum-related complications, sepsis or meningitis, pneumonia, congenital abnormalities, other disorders, tetanus, and diarrhea. Globally, 7.6 million children died before the age of 5 years in 2010 with 64 % dying from infections. The major infections causing death in children include pneumonia, diarrhea, and malaria (Liu et al. 2010). Cancer is listed as the fourth most common cause of death in the industrialized world in children less than 15 years of age (American Academy of Pediatrics Committee on Environmental Heat 2003). In the United States (USA), from data obtained from the Center for Disease Control (CDC) National Center for Health Statistics (NCHS) mortality data for 1999\u20132009, the leading cause of death (all causes) in childhood (excluding neonates) was attributed to external causes (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and National Center for Health Statistics 1999). In the neonatal period (up to 28 days following birth), the leading cause of death involved conditions that originated in the neonatal period, followed by congenital malformations, deformations, and chromosomal abnormalities, and diseases of the circulatory system with primary pulmonary hypertension being number one. Beyond the neonatal period, congenital malformations including chromosomal abnormalities, trauma including child abuse, and sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS) are some of the most common causes of death and will be covered elsewhere in the text. Table 30.1 depicts the five most common childhood-acquired diseases categorized by pediatric age groups in the USA. This chapter will focus on acquired childhood diseases that cause death outside the neonatal period that are likely to be encountered by the forensic pathologist, and approaches to autopsy examination. The topics are not intended to be exhaustive but instead to include common natural diseases and their features that are likely to be encountered at autopsy.\n",

Typically there is peripheral, dependent, or diffuse edema. On internal examination, pleural, pericardial, and peritoneal effusions may be present. On examination of the organs, there may be little to no abnormal changes, or marked changes resulting from the dissemination of infection, or changes related to hypotension and septic shock. It is not uncommon to see petechiae or hemorrhages on the organ surfaces, particularly the pleura, heart, and thymus. The liver and spleen may be enlarged, softened, and have wrinkled capsules. On sectioning, the spleen may show deliquescence (liquefaction). The liver parenchyma may have accentuation of the lobular architecture, centrilobular hemorrhage, and necrosis. In severe cases of sepsis, there may also be evidence of cholestasis or steatosis. The lungs, heart, liver, spleen, and kidneys may contain infarcts. In the lungs, there may be evidence of edema and congestion, pneumonia, abscess, or diffuse alveolar damage. Diffuse adrenal hemorrhage can be seen in some cases of bacterial sepsis, most notably in association with Neisseria meningitidis sepsis (Fig. 30.1). The kidneys may have scattered infective foci in the cortex with sparing of the medulla indicating hematogenous spread of infection. The heart may be dilated and contain diffuse or localized red-blue lesions or valvular vegetations (Fig. 30.2). The esophagus, stomach, and bowel walls may be thickened, edematous, and congested. There may be bloody material in the intestinal lumen. There may be fat necrosis or hemorrhage in, or surrounding, the pancreas. The brain may have evidence of edema or hemorrhage within the parenchyma (Fig. 30.3).\n\n\n",

With acute viral enterocolitis, the bowel may appear dilated and filled with flocculent fluid. After emptying the intestines and stomach and for better preservation, it is helpful to rinse the samples in formalin rather than water. Most infections show a nonspecific pattern of damage to the surface epithelium. Acute enterocolitis appears as diffusely red with a thickened mucosa.

For studies of electrolytes, vitreous fluid can be easily drawn from the posterior chambers of the eyes. Vitreous is the specimen for analysis and is preferred over blood samples because of the postmortem breakdown and autolysis that occurs in serum. Although potassium is unstable in vitreous, sodium, chloride, creatinine, and urea nitrogen can remain stable for up to 120 h following death. Because vitreous glucose levels decrease postmortem, the vitreous is not useful for identifying hypoglycemia. Variables such as postmortem interval, temperature, and patient age can affect vitreous components. Analysis for glucose, ketones, alcohols, and certain drugs can also be performed on vitreous.

Tryptase is highly stable and can be assessed several days postmortem (Edston and van Hage-Hamsten 1998). Although there is variability in the interpretation of postmortem tryptase levels, several studies have shown that values above 11.4 \u03bcg/L (the upper normal limit in living subjects) are suggestive of anaphylactic deaths, though increased levels are not specific and have been shown to be elevated in other non anaphylactic deaths (Mayer et al. 2011). There have been mixed reports as to whether or not tryptase levels increase with increasing postmortem intervals. When the suspected allergen trigger is known, trigger-specific IgE antibody levels are also possible. Although elevated IgE antibody levels do not prove anaphylaxis, they can help determine the type of allergen responsible for the anaphylaxis (Prahlow and Barnard 1998).",

Additionally, the incidence of malignancy was more prevalent infratentorially, among males and whites. CNS tumors in general had the highest incidence from infancy to 7 years of age and have the second highest rate of childhood cancer. Childhood brain tumors are associated with a number of genetic syndromes that include neurofibromatosis type I (associated with low-grade optic tract gliomas and other brain tumors) and type 2 (associated with acoustic neuromas), tuberous sclerosis (associated with CNS tubers and subependymal giant-cell astrocytomas), von Hippel-Lindau disease (associated with hemangioglioblastomas), and familial cancer predisposition syndromes (e.g., Li-Fraumeni syndrome associated with choroid plexus carcinomas) (Fleming and Chi 2012). Presenting symptoms in children with primary brain tumors include headaches, increased intracranial pressure, vomiting, and seizures. Most children with brain tumors who present with headaches also commonly experience vomiting and will have increased intracranial pressure and obstructive hydrocephalus (Fleming and Chi 2012). Low-grade tumors of the cerebral cortex may cause seizures, and as previously discussed, seizures can be a cause of sudden death in children.",

Although most naturally occurring childhood diseases are less likely to come to the attention of the forensic pathologist, such cases will be referred and therefore are important to consider. In children of all ages, infections and cancers are frequent causes of mortality. In cases of suspected infection, ancillary testing is particularly important when the responsible agent is previously unknown. For malignancies, establishing the extent of tumor involvement as well as evaluating effects and complications of therapy is important. Likewise, the investigation of sudden unexpected death in childhood warrants careful consideration.
