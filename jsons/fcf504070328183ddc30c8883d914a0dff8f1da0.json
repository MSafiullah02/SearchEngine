Respiratory failure is the inability to maintain either normal delivery of oxygen to the tissues or normal removal of carbon dioxide from the tissues. It occurs when there is an imbalance between the respiratory workload and ventilatory strength and endurance. Defi nitions are somewhat arbitrary but suggested laboratory criteria for respiratory failure include two or more of the following: PaCO 2 > 60 mmHg, PaO 2 < 50 mmHg or O 2 saturation <80 % with an FiO 2 of 1.0 and pH < 7.25 (Wen et al. 2004 ) .",

Infants have less respiratory reserve than older individuals, and respiratory failure is more common, not only during pulmonary illnesses but also any serious illness. Infants have narrow, compliant airways which are prone to collapse. Their chest wall is not ossifi ed and has low muscle mass. It is very compliant, which in combination with a low functional residual capacity puts the infant at risk of airway collapse and atelectasis. The low recoil of the chest wall means that little pressure is required to expand the chest wall. In contrast to older subjects, the major force contributing to elastic recoil is surface tension at the air-liquid interface in the distal airways and alveoli. Surfactant defi ciency, both primary and secondary, leads to decreased stability of the small terminal airways and alveoli and ultimately to collapse.",

During the canalicular phase, there is ongoing branching of the respiratory bronchioles with thinning of the airway epithelium, so that by the end of this period there is some capability for gas exchange. During the saccular stage, the peripheral airways widen into saccules which then form the alveolar ducts, the precursor to alveoli. Infants born during this period do not have fully functioning terminal airways; there are fewer, thick-walled gas exchange units. The true alveolar stage does not start until 36 weeks gestation and continues postnatally until about 2 years of age. The development of fully functional alveoli is also dependent on development of the surrounding mesenchyme and the alveolar capillaries.",

In utero, the terminal airways are full of fl uid secreted from the pulmonary epithelial cells. This fl uid is an important determinant of lung growth. The volume of fl uid is equivalent to functional residual capacity (FRC) post delivery. Following delivery, lung fl uid is cleared. This process is slower and less effi cient in preterm infants (Egan et al. 1984 ) . The sequence of lung infl ation, fl uid clearance and rising pH controls the early fall in pulmonary vascular resistance and initial oxygenation. The action of the respiratory muscles overcomes the resistive properties of the airways to develop FRC and tidal volume .

Premature lungs have insuffi cient alveolarisation, decreased functional surface area, increased distance from alveoli to adjacent capillaries and reduced surfactant synthesis and show less hysteresis than normal lungs. The terminal airways collapse at end of expiration due to high surface tension. Tidal volumes are small and the dead space is relatively large. Infants are able to increase their respiratory rate to compensate for the low tidal volume. This means they may be able to maintain their minute volume, but the work of breathing is doubled (Hjalmarson and Olsson 1974 ; McCann et al. 1987 ). Most infants have some surfactant at birth (Reynolds et al. 1968 ) but levels fall within a few hours as alveolar protein leak inhibits function (Ikegami et al. 1983 ).

In immature, stiff, surfactant defi cient lungs, alveolar epithelial cell death starts to occur in the fi rst hour after birth. Dead cells detach from the basement membrane, denuded patches appear, and protein leak leads to interstitial oedema. Hyaline membranes form; they consist of plasma protein, fi brin, cellular debris, red blood cells, macrophages and proteinaceous exudate. The material lines or fi lls the air spaces inhibiting gas exchange. Most of the protein leak occurs over the fi rst 24 h (Ikegami et al. 1992 ) . During this time the hyaline membranes, which are initially patchy, become more confl uent. Ischaemia exacerbates RDS with epithelial necrosis occurring in the terminal airways.

Hyaline membranes are broken down by the seventh day but will persist for longer if the infant is receiving mechanical ventilation.

Uniform infi ltrates described as a 'ground glass' appearance involve all lobes of the lungs. Air bronchograms are seen as the infi ltrate outlines the larger airways that remain air fi lled. In severe cases, the infi ltrates are such that the cardiac and diaphragmatic borders become indistinct giving a 'white-out' appearance. Infants increase their respiratory rate, take smaller volume breaths and use accessory muscles to assist with their increased work of breathing. This results in nasal fl aring and rib, sternal and subcostal recession. Infants attempt to stop alveolar collapse at end expiration by closing the glottis, resulting in grunting. As the infant tires, cyanosis develops and the infant develops apnoeic episodes with desaturations. Infants with RDS have decreased urine output and commonly become oedematous. The differential diagnosis includes infection (particularly group B streptococcal infection), persistent pulmonary hypertension of the newborn, aspiration pneumonia, lung malformations and upper airway obstruction, transient tachypnoea of the newborn, meconium aspiration syndrome, air leak syndromes, pulmonary haemorrhage, asphyxia, congenital heart disease, primary neurological or neuromuscular disease and inborn errors of metabolism.",

            "text": "Dead Space The effects of RDS on lung function vary with gestational and postnatal age. Newborns with normal lungs quickly develop an FRC of about 30 mL/kg (McCann et al. 1987 ) . FRC is the volume of gas remaining in the lungs at the end of normal expiration, preventing alveolar collapse and allowing the lung to operate at optimal effi ciency. Less mature infants have lower lung volumes, including a lower FRC; however, tidal volume remains about the same at 4-6 mL/kg (Hislop et al. 1986 ). These effects proportionally increase the physiological dead space to 60-80 % of tidal volume, compared with 30-40 % of tidal volume in healthy lungs (Avery et al. 1981 ) . To compensate for this increased dead space, infants with RDS increase their respiratory rates. For infants without RDS, a rise in respiratory rate can lead to gas trapping; however, in babies with RDS, an increased respiratory rate may be enough to help maintain necessary FRC and avoid end-expiratory alveolar collapse. Newborn FRC already approaches alveolar closing volume, so a reduction in FRC permits atelectasis to readily develop. Further loss of FRC occurs due to vascular congestion, interstitial oedema and proteinaceous exudates.",

Infants also contract the laryngeal muscles to keep the upper airway closed until late expiration, and then when these muscles relax, the abdominal muscles contract. The explosive release of air sounds as a grunt. Grunting helps to delay air escape from the lung and maintains FRC. It has been demonstrated that when an endotracheal tube is inserted, the loss of these mechanisms result in a fall in arterial oxygenation (Harrison et al. 1968 ). Surfactant treatment helps to increase lung volumes, so that lower positive pressures are required for ventilation. Higher lung volumes are maintained even when positive pressure is reduced because FRC increases following surfactant treatment (Goldsmith et al. 1991 ) . Most lung volume improvement is seen when exogenous surfactant containing surfactant proteins are used (Rider et al. 1993 ) . As FRC improves oxygenation improves. This normally occurs as lung fl uid clears (Engle et al. 1983 ) or following surfactant treatment (Edberg et al. 1990 ) or when using distending pressure, such as mechanical ventilation (Richardson and Jung 1978 ) .

This leads to overdistension of the larger alveoli that have remained open. Compliance is reduced as fewer terminal air spaces are ventilated, and those that are open become overdistended. Alveolar instability affects compliance as the critical opening and closing pressures vary. This means that alveoli open and shut suddenly, smaller ones then stay closed and open alveoli overfi ll. There is increased resistance in the lungs due to reduced cross-sectional area of the patent airways to the distal lung units. During spontaneous breathing the activity of the respiratory muscles tries to overcome elastic resistance and inertia of the tissues by increasing the change in intrapleural pressure, resulting in distortion of the compliant chest wall. Pulmonary compliance improves more slowly, following surfactant administration, than the rapid improvement seen in FRC (Edberg et al. 1990 ). This is refl ected by quick improvement in oxygenation, compared with the relatively slower fall in carbon dioxide. The reduced compliance slowly returns to normal around day 7.",

Most hypoxia in RDS is due to right-to-left shunting. Small shunts exist across the foramen ovale (if right atrial pressure is higher than left atrial pressure) and the ductus arteriosus (which is often patent in infants with RDS for 48 h). These shunts only account for about 10 % of the shunt in RDS (Seppanen et al. 1994 ) and are more important in other lung pathologies such as persistent pulmonary hypertension. In RDS, the most important shunt is intrapulmonary, as capillary blood travels through unventilated, or hypoventilated, atelectatic areas of the lung. Pulmonary arterial pressure normally falls rapidly, to half of the in utero level, soon after birth, but in RDS it can remain high for the fi rst week (Evans and Archer 1991 ) . The pulmonary pressure is proportionately higher in infants with more severe RDS and can exacerbate the hypoxia seen in RDS.",

This is suffi cient time to administer steroid treatment and reduce the risk of RDS. Antibiotics for suspected infection, or for membrane rupture, reduces progression to preterm delivery (Gomez et al. 1995 ) . Other factors which impact on RDS development include asphyxia and drug depression of the infant.

The widespread uptake of antenatal steroid use has had a dramatic impact on the epidemiology of RDS over the last 20 years. Steroids induce enzymes for surfactant synthesis, induce genes for synthesis of surfactant protein (Mendelson et al. 1993 ) , improve the quality of the surfactant produced (Ueda et al. 1995 ; Lanteri et al. 1994 ) , mature the lung tissue and increase the number of alveolar divisions (Lanteri et al. 1994 ) . The optimal timing of steroid administration has been shown to be 24-168 h prior to delivery (Crowley 1995 ) . Some benefi t can be seen with doses given 4-24 h prior to delivery (Sen et al. 2002 ) . There is limited evidence of benefi t below 28 weeks gestation (Garite et al. 1992 ) or beyond 34 weeks gestation (Liggins and Howie 1972 ) . Steroids appear to be safe in terms of effect on maternal pregnancy-induced hypertension (Lamont et al. 1983 ) , prolonged rupture of the membranes (Crowley 1995 ) and maternal diabetes.

Most resuscitation guidelines are drawn up with term infants in mind and may not translate accurately to preterm infants at high risk of RDS and BPD. Until recently premature infants were routinely stabilised using 100 % oxygen; many were intubated and given surfactant as a standard procedure, regardless of their respiratory effort. We now know that 100 % oxygen is not the best choice of gas to use (Saugstad et al. 2008 ) and several studies are underway to determine the most appropriate initial oxygen concentration to use, as well as the best oxygen saturations to target (Castillo et al. 2008 ) .

            "text": "There are good theoretical, clinical and animal data for using positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) at delivery. Animal data have demonstrated that PEEP reduces alveolar-arterial oxygen gradient (Probyn et al. 2004 ) , protects from lung injury (Jobe et al. 2002 ) , preserves the surfactant pool (Michna et al. 1999 ) , improves oxygenation and improves ventilation-perfusion matching (Schlessel et al. 1989 ; Finer et al. 2004 ) . PEEP also accelerates formation of FRC (Siew et al. 2009 ) and protects the lungs by keeping the alveoli open (Nilsson et al. 1980 ) . Using a resuscitation device that is able to give PEEP would seem advantageous but so far has not shown improved outcomes in terms of saturations at 5 min or need for endotracheal intubation (Dawson et al. 2009b ) . Use of CPAP to treat preterm infants has been shown to reduce rates of endotracheal intubation (Lindner et al. 1999 ; Lundstrom 2003 ; Stevens et al. 2007 ), but the disadvantage is that any surfactant treatment is delayed. PEEP or CPAP from the delivery room onward has been shown to be as good as initial ventilation and surfactant treatment, but not any better , and is discussed further in the CPAP section of this chapter. CPAP and sustained infl ations can be used to help the infant establish FRC (te Pas et al. 2009a ; te Pas and Walther 2007 ) . It is important to carefully control any positive pressure support given in the delivery room to avoid damaging the lungs. Animal studies have shown that even a few large volume infl ations can damage newborn lungs (Bjorklund et al. 1997 ; Dreyfuss and Saumon 1992 ; Hernandez et al. 1989 ) and currently the majority of respiratory support systems used in the delivery room do not allow the clinician to measure the delivered volume (Schmolzer et al. 2010 ). In the absence of respiratory function, monitoring the initial stabilisation and transfer from the delivery room to the neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) should be guided by oxygen saturations and chest movement. However, Tracy et al. suggest that this clinically determined ventilation commonly results in hypocarbia, hyperoxia or both (Tracy et al. 2004 ).",

Once initial examination is complete, infants should be handled as little as possible and nursed prone to maximise oxygenation and respiratory muscle coordination (Hand et al. 2007 ; Leipala et al. 2003 ; Wells et al. 2005 ) . As RDS is clinically indistinguishable from sepsis, infants with ongoing respiratory symptoms should have intravenous access, blood sent for full blood count, a chest x-ray, septic markers and blood culture and should receive antibiotics. Infants with signifi cant increased work of breathing should not initially receive enteral feeds, but be managed with intravenous fl uid titrated against urine output and plasma sodium. Very low birth weight infants who are likely to need ongoing respiratory support require early parental nutrition for optimal lung growth and recovery. Anaemia and coagulation abnormalities need to be carefully controlled; blood pressure should be maintained with crystalloid and if necessary with inotropic support. Arterial oxygen levels should be kept between 50 and 75 mmHg (7-10 kPa); ongoing clinical trials, such as BOOST2, aim to determine the optimal oxygen saturations for this group of infants. The European Consensus Guidelines on the Management of Neonatal RDS currently recommend that oxygen saturations, in infants receiving supplemental oxygen, should be kept below 95 % (Sweet et al. 2007 ). Hypocarbia must be avoided due to the effect on cerebral blood fl ow (Garland et al. 1995 ) . A degree of permissive hypercarbia appears safe (Miller and Carlo 2007 ) and is associated with lower rates of BPD (Thome and Ambalavanan 2009 ).",

It has been advocated as a gentler form of respiratory support (Jacobsen et al. 1993 ) and has been shown to have many physiological benefi ts. These include decreasing the likelihood of upper airway collapse and decreasing upper airway resistance by splinting and increasing the cross-sectional area of the pharynx (Miller et al. 1990 ). CPAP reduces obstructive apnoeas (Miller et al. 1985 ) and alters the shape of the diaphragm, improving lung compliance and decreasing lung resistance (Gaon et al. 1999 ) . It allows larger tidal volumes for the same respiratory effort and conserves surfactant. CPAP has also been demonstrated to increase FRC (Richardson and Jung 1978 ; Richardson et al. 1980 ) , stabilise the chest wall (Locke et al. 1991 ) , improve lung volumes (Harris et al. 1976 ; Yu and Rolfe 1977 ) and improve oxygenation (Durand et al. 1983 ).",

Endotracheal CPAP has been shown to increase work of breathing (Kim 1989 ; Davis and Henderson-Smart 2001 ; LeSouef et al. 1984 ) , and CPAP is now delivered via a variety of short and long, single and bi-nasal prongs, or by nasal mask.",

            "text": "Long nasopharyngeal tubes, passed through one nostril to sit above the epiglottis, are still used but have high intrinsic resistance, and therefore a signifi cant amount of the distending pressure is lost along the tube, sometimes more than 4 cm H 2 O (De Paoli et al. 2002 ) . Shorter single nasal prongs can be used but also have high resistance, and pressure is also lost via the contralateral nostril. Short bi-nasal prongs, of which there are several designs, provide a low resistance interface (De Paoli et al. 2002 ) . Their use has been shown to prevent more re-intubations than single nasal or nasopharyngeal prongs (relative risk (RR) 0.59, 95 % CI 0.41, 0.85, number needed to treat (NNT) was 5) (De Paoli et al. 2008 ) . Small nasal masks have also been developed, initially in the belief that they caused less trauma. There is minimal data regarding their use, effi cacy or safety, and a recent study showed that mask CPAP caused as much nasal trauma as bi-nasal prongs (Yong et al. 2005 ) , albeit at different sites. The use of nasal masks needs to be properly investigated. In much of the developed world, management of very preterm infants in the delivery room has included endotracheal intubation and early surfactant treatment. However, a series of observational studies suggested that preterm infants managed well with initial CPAP support, reducing intubation and BPD rates, without increasing mortality or morbidity (Jacobsen et al. 1993 ; De Klerk and De Klerk 2001 ; Kamper et al. 1993 ; Van Marter et al. 2000 ) . Following these publications CPAP gained more credibility as a fi rst-line treatment and was extensively used in very low birth weight infants Ammari et al. 2005 ) . Starting CPAP soon after birth not only avoids endotracheal intubation and its inherent risks (O'Donnell et al. 2006 ) but also delays any surfactant treatment (Stevens et al. 2007 ). RCTs and meta-analyses of premature infants managed with early CPAP compared with intubation and ventilation had failed to detect differences between groups (Han et al. 1987 ; Sandri et al. 2004 ; Subramaniam et al. 2005 ) . One study did fi nd lower rates of BPD in infants treated with early CPAP, but the group had also received a sustained infl ation at stabilisation which may have affected the results (te Pas and Walther 2007 ). The COIN trial randomised infants less than 28 weeks of gestation to either CPAP or intubation in the delivery room ). This trial found that half of the infants in the CPAP group never required intubation. CPAPtreated infants had a signifi cantly lower rate of death or BPD at 28 days, but not at 36 weeks corrected age. CPAP-treated infants also had a higher rate of pneumothorax, but no differences were found in any other adverse outcomes. From this large RCT, it would appear that CPAP is an acceptable alternative to intubation in the delivery room as many small babies who breathe spontaneously at birth were successfully treated without mechanical ventilation. It is possible that the higher pneumothorax rate in the CPAP group was due to surfactant defi ciency. The challenge is not only to look at ways to support infants with CPAP but also to replace surfactant in a timely manner if necessary (Hascoet et al. 2008 (Fox et al. 1981 ) , poor thoraco-abdominal wall co-ordination (Locke et al. 1991 ) and apnoea of prematurity (Kattwinkel et al. 1975 ) . They can develop progressive atelectasis (Finer et al. 1979 ) and many do not manage without ventilation for long (Annibale et al. 1994 ; Davis and Henderson-Smart 2000 ; Higgins et al. 1991 ) . Systematic review of nine trials randomising infants to CPAP or head box oxygen post-extubation showed reduced need for additional respiratory support in the CPAP group (RR 0.62 95 % CI 0.51, 0.76, with NNT 6) (Davis and Henderson-Smart 2003 ) . No difference was seen in terms of BPD. In these studies many infants in the head box oxygen group were successfully 'rescued' with CPAP treatment, and as a result the review found no difference in re-intubation rates. Extubation to CPAP was only advantageous if CPAP pressures were at least 5 cm H 2 O. The review concluded that CPAP is benefi cial post-extubation, but if resources are limited, there is no harm in restricting CPAP use after extubation to those infants who are unable to manage in head box oxygen alone. Current European guidelines recommend that preterm infants should be placed on CPAP following extubation (Sweet et al. 2007 (Elgellab et al. 2001 ) . Laboratory data demonstrated that different prong systems result in the loss of several centimetres of water pressure across the prongs (De Paoli et al. 2002 ) , and other studies have shown that further pressure loss occurs between the prong and the pharynx . There is much to learn about optimal CPAP pressures, and it is unlikely that any single pressure will be appropriate for the duration of an infant's illness. It would be more realistic to titrate CPAP pressure against severity of the lung disease at a given time Success of CPAP support is dependent on training and experience of both medical and nursing staff. Clinical skills in delivering CPAP support increase with time (Aly et al. 2004 ). The aim of CPAP is to pressurise the infants nasopharynx and lungs, but nasal prong fi t is inexact and gas leak from the mouth and nose means that delivered pressure may be lower than intended (Kahn et al. 2007 ). Optimal prong size, position, angle and strapping all affect pressure delivery. Chin strapping may be used to reduce leak, but there is no evidence that this increases the delivered pressure. It can be diffi cult to achieve a therapeutic distending pressure in some infants, resulting in failure of CPAP treatment. Gastric distension is a well-recognised side effect of CPAP although CPAP does not appear to increase the risk of necrotising enterocolitis (Aly et al. 2009 ) and may actually increase the speed of gastric emptying (Gounaris et al. 2004 ) . Standard practice includes insertion of a gastric tube that is left open to air, with the aim of venting the stomach, although there is no evidence that this occurs. Nasal trauma has been reported in up to 20 % of infants receiving nasal CPAP . Similar rates of injury between nasal prongs, masks and nasopharyngeal tubes have been reported (Yong et al. 2005 ; Buettiker et al. 2004 ). Duration of CPAP support has so far been shown to be the strongest risk factor for traumatic injury (Yong et al. 2005 ) . Early RCTs of CPAP report increased rates of pneumothoraces (Ho et al. 2002 ) and recent trials have shown similar rates Sandri et al. 2009 ). Several case reports exist of more unusual complications including pneumopericardium (Turkbay et al. 2007 ) , pulmonary interstitial emphysema (Arioni et al. 2006 ) and ingested nasal tubes (Duran et al. 2005 ) . There is some data to suggest that CPAP increases infection rates, possibly secondary to trauma to the nasal mucosa (Ronnestad et al. 2005 ) .",

The review also found that INSURE-treated infants had less need for mechanical ventilation (RR 0.67, 95 % CI 0.57, 0.79) and fewer air leaks (RR 0.52, 95 % CI 0.28, 0.96) but had an increase in surfactant use. Stratifi ed analysis, by oxygen requirement at study entry, found that a lower threshold of intervention, at an inspired oxygen below 45 %, resulted in lower rates of pneumothorax (RR 0.46, 95 % CI 0.23, 0.93) and less BPD (RR 0.43, 95 % CI 0.20, 0.92) . Higher thresholds were associated with higher rates of patent ductus arteriosus (RR 2.15, 95 % CI 1.09, 4.13) . Further studies comparing INSURE with ongoing ventilation, published since the meta-analysis, have added further weight to its fi ndings (Rojas et al. 2009 ). The REVE trial also compared the INSURE technique with ongoing ventilation post-surfactant treatment, and the results suggest that the technique has most benefi t for the youngest infants at 25-26 weeks gestation (Truffert et al. 2008 ) .",

These studies have not answered the question of whether it is better to treat infants with the INSURE technique or to treat with CPAP alone and give rescue surfactant, via brief intubation, only if CPAP support is insuffi cient. One small Scandinavian study has addressed this question and found that the INSURE group had better oxygenation and reduced need for mechanical ventilation (Verder et al. 1994 ) compared with the CPAP and rescue surfactant group. The large multicentre CURPAP study also aimed to answer this question (Sandri et al. 2008 ) , and the presented results show that there were no differences between groups in the need for mechanical ventilation, or for the combined outcome of death or BPD (Sandri et al. 2009 ). The implication for clinicians is that CPAP with rescue surfactant was no worse than prophylactic surfactant followed by CPAP support. There is a need to individualise initial CPAP support with early rescue surfactant based on clinical criteria. The Vermont-Oxford Network is now running a three-armed trial comparing traditional intubation, surfactant and ongoing ventilation with either INSURE or CPAP and rescue surfactant ).",

This limited their use due to risk of nasal mucosa injury, mucosal bleeding, thickened secretions and nosocomial infection (Kopelman and Holbert 2003 ; Woodhead et al. 2006 ) . The development of heated humidifi ed high-fl ow gas delivery via nasal cannulae (HHHFNC) may circumvent these issues.

Some algorithms exist to guide fl ow selection, but they depend on a consistent level of leak being present, which is not necessarily the case in practice (Wilkinson et al. 2008 ) . If the infant's mouth is closed and the cannulae become functionally 'sealed' in the nares due to secretions or tight-fi tting cannulae, then fl ow will continue to increase the nasopharyngeal pressure until an outlet is found. This could result in signifi cant lung and gastrointestinal overdistention. A recent report describes development of subcutaneous scalp emphysema, pneumo-orbitis and pneumocephalus during HHHFNC use (Jasin et al. 2008 ) . Not all HHHFNC systems contain a pressurelimiting safety valve to protect against inadvertent high pressure, but such a system should be incorporated into future designs (Lampland et al. 2009 ). One further concern with HHHFNC has been adequate humidifi cation and heating of the circuit. Anecdotal reports exist of condensation in the tubing and cannulae during fl ows at the lower end of the range of 'high fl ow', resulting in water droplets coalescing to obstruct fl ow or enter the nares.",

As the nasal compartment contributes up to 50 % of the overall respiratory resistance (Hall et al. 2002 ) , this effect could contribute to a reduced work of breathing compared with conventional CPAP prongs. The uptake of HHHFNC by numerous neonatal units has not been accompanied by obvious changes in neonatal outcome, but the technique has not been systematically studied. The American Association of Respiratory Care 2002 Clinical Practice Guideline (Myers 2002 ) states that fl ow for nasal cannula treatment in newborn infants should not exceed 2 L/min and acknowledges that even this fl ow may be excessive for the extremely low birth weight infant. There is a need for high-quality RCTs to delineate the range of delivered pressure for a given fl ow, for all sizes of preterm infants. Until the results of these trials are available, if an infant requires CPAP, then it can more safely be delivered with a standard device So et al. 1992 ) . A multicentre, prospective, randomised comparison of CPAP compared with HHHFNC in infants greater than 1,000 g and 28 weeks gestation, from birth or following extubation, is currently underway.",

Hypotheses include pharyngeal dilation and increased pharyngeal pressure (Aghai et al. 2006 ; Santin et al. 2004 ; Friedlich et al. 1999 ; Moretti et al. 1999 ; Khalaf et al. 2001 ) increased sighs and improved respiratory drive , induction of Head's paradoxical refl ex (Ryan et al. 1989 ) , increased mean airway pressure ) increased alveolar recruitment (Khalaf et al. 2001 ; Courtney and Barrington 2007 ) , increased functional residual capacity (FRC) and increased tidal and minute volume (Moretti et al. 1999 ) . It is unclear whether mechanical infl ations during NIPPV are transmitted to the chest. There is some evidence that NIPPV, compared with CPAP, improves arterial oxygen, carbon dioxide, respiratory rates and oxygen saturations (Moretti et al. 1999 ; Migliori et al. 2005 ) , reduces thoraco-abdominal asynchrony (Kiciman et al. 1998 ) and decreases work of breathing (Aghai et al. 2006 ; Ali et al. 2007 ). NIPPV may increase tidal volumes and minute ventilation (Moretti et al. 1999 ) , although this fi nding is not consistent (Aghai et al. 2006 ; Ali et al. 2007 ).",

Recent studies of NIPPV post-extubation have confi rmed this fi nding (Khorana et al. 2008 ; Sai Sunil Kishore et al. 2009 ). Meta-analysis of two studies Ryan et al. 1989 ) comparing NIPPV with CPAP for the treatment of apnoea showed no advantage of NIPPV over CPAP . Some studies have now investigated the use of NIPPV for the initial treatment of respiratory disease and found reduced rates of endotracheal intubation in the NIPPV groups (Kugelman et al. 2007 ; Bisceglia et al. 2007 ). There is emerging evidence that NIPPV, when compared with ventilation (Bhandari et al. 2007 ) or with CPAP (Kulkarni et al. 2006 ; Kugelman et al. 2007 ), has reduced rates of BPD. Retrospective review of NIPPV-treated infants, compared with ventilated infants, shows that the smallest babies had better outcomes with respect to BPD, death and neurodevelopmental outcome at 18-22 months (Bhandari et al. 2009 ) . A large multicentre trial of NIPPV as a fi rst-line treatment is now taking place (Kirpalani 2007 Complications similar to those seen in CPAPtreated infants are the most likely to occur, including trauma, laceration (Yong et al. 2005 ; Shanmugananda and Rawal 2007 ) and sepsis (Graham et al. 2006 ) . Historically gastrointestinal perforations (Garland et al. 1985 ) and head moulding (Pape et al. 1976 ) were reported following NIPPV, but these have not been described in recent studies. Abdominal distension has been reported in one NIPPV study (Jackson et al. 2003 ) , but it has also been suggested that the reduced work of breathing seen during NIPPV may reduce gastrointestinal complications (Aghai et al. 2006 ).",

While there is now considerable debate about which preterm infants need mechanical ventilation, there have also been dramatic changes in the way neonatologists are able to deliver mechanical ventilation. The British Association of Perinatal Medicine (BAPM) suggests that infants have failed CPAP support and require ventilation if they have persistent or major apnoeas with bradycardia, become acidotic below pH 7.25 or require more than 60 % oxygen (British Association of Perinatal Medicine T 2005 ).",

            "text": "Technology now allows synchronisation of mechanical infl ations with spontaneous inspiration. Success of this technique relies on the triggering device being highly sensitive, with minimal time delay. Several types of trigger have been devised, using changes in airway pressure, airway fl ow, transthoracic impedance and abdominal movement. Different triggers may work differently under varying respiratory conditions and movements (Kassim and Greenough 2006 ) ; fl ow triggers have been shown to be superior to pressure triggers (Dimitriou et al. 2001 ) . Triggered ventilatory modes, when compared with conventional CMV, show reduced rates of air leak and shorter duration of ventilation, when started during the recovery phase of RDS ). They also achieve improved blood gases, more stable blood pressure and reduced work of breathing (Cleary et al. 1995 ) . Triggered modes have not been shown to be advantageous over conventional CMV in terms of intraventricular haemorrhage (IVH), BPD or mortality . Some triggered ventilation modes support all spontaneous inspirations (e.g. assist control (AC), synchronised intermittent positive pressure ventilation (SIPPV) or patient-triggered ventilation (PTV)). Other modes support only a set number of inspirations (e.g. synchronised intermittent mechanical ventilation (SIMV)), determined by the clinician. Small RCTs have suggested that supporting all infl ations is superior to supporting a limited number and that low numbers of supported breaths, less than 20/min, actually increase work of breathing (Roze et al. 1995 Until recently, it had not been possible to measure tidal and minute volumes in neonates, but as devices have been developed that can make these tiny measurements, volume-targeted neonatal ventilation has emerged. There is good animal and adult evidence to suggest that controlling tidal volume can reduce volutrauma, atelectotrauma and BPD in low birth weight infants . Volume-targeted ventilation allows gas exchange at lower peak infl ation pressures in both the early and recovery phases of RDS (Cheema and Ahluwalia 2001 ) . VTV shows more consistent tidal volume delivery, fewer very large breaths and less infl ammatory cytokine response (Keszler 2005 ) . Meta-analysis of volume-targeted ventilation, compared with pressure-limited ventilation, shows lower pneumothorax and IVH rates, but no defi nite effect on BPD or mortality rates (McCallion et al. 2005 ). Long-term followup of infants managed with VTV, compared with pressure-limited ventilation, showed no differences in mortality, respiratory illnesses or readmissions. The volume-targeted group had lower rates of inhaled steroid and bronchodilator use (Singh et al. 2009a ).",

Animal data has shown less protein leak in RDS when using HFOV, compared with conventional ventilation (Niblett et al. 1989 ) . Initial trials of HFOV used low lung volume strategies. This technique may be ideal for infants with established air leak syndromes, but when infants with RDS were studied, no pulmonary benefi ts were found with HFOV, and higher rates of IVH were seen (The HIFI Study Group 1989 ). Many of the infants enrolled in the early studies would not have had continuous carbon dioxide monitoring and may have had undetected hypocarbia contributing to the poor outcomes seen (The HIFI Study Group 1989 ; Greisen et al. 1987 ; Froese and Kinsella 2005 ) . Further animal data demonstrated that optimising lung volume prolonged the effect of exogenous surfactant ) and that when starting HFOV it was important to fully recruit the lung using a short period of higher airway pressure. A brief period of overdistension is less damaging than the persistent atelectasis seen in the low-volume approach (Bond and Froese 1993 ) , and the open lung technique results in more even distribution of tidal volume and less alveolar overdistention (Frerichs et al. 2003 ). Froese et al. suggested that how the HFOV technique is applied is more important than the choice of mechanical device generating the oscillations (Froese and Kinsella 2005 ) .",

Acute and chronic pulmonary advantages of HFOV were then seen compared with conventional ventilation (Gerstmann et al. 1996 ) . However, the results were not reproduced in later trials where all the infants received steroids, exogenous surfactant and early CPAP after delivery (Thome et al. 1999 ) , all of which result in a more open lung ventilation technique in both groups. Improvements in conventional ventilation, increasing PEEP, decreasing tidal volume and synchronising infl ations, have meant that the advantages of HFOV have been greatly reduced (Courtney et al. 2002 ) . Now the pulmonary benefi ts of lower BPD rates and shorter duration of ventilation are only seen in infants with the most severe disease, who require high oxygen requirements (>60 %) post surfactant (Courtney et al. 2002 ) . Routine HFOV for all RDS has not been shown to be benefi cial and is now often reserved for the subset of infants with severe disease. The BAPM guidelines suggest conversion to HFOV, from conventional ventilation, for infants who have failed to respond to surfactant therapy and optimisation of conventional ventilation and who still have an oxygen requirement above 60 % and peak pressures above 30 cm H 2 O (British Association of Perinatal Medicine T 2005 ).",

Debate continues today about the need for surfactant administration, which surfactant to use, the most appropriate timing for surfactant delivery, the best dose and optimal mode of surfactant delivery, to treat RDS and prevent BPD. Surfactant has been shown to decrease rates of pneumothorax by 30-65 % and decrease mortality by up to 40 % (Halliday 2005 Surfactant is a complex system of phospholipids -mainly dipalmitoyl phosphatidylcholine, neutral lipids, proteins and glycoproteins. Surfactant is produced and assembled in type 2 pneumocytes from 22 weeks of gestation onwards, and the number of type 2 pneumocytes increases throughout gestation. Surfactant is stored in the lamellar bodies of the pneumocytes and is later extruded into the air spaces.",

Other phospholipids, along with surfactant proteins, further reduce surface tension to almost zero (Veldhuizen et al. 1998 ). Surface tension is responsible for approximately twothirds of the elastic recoil forces of the lung, so by reducing surface tension, the surfactant prevents the air spaces from collapsing at end expiration. The lowered surface tension also allows re-expansion of the terminal airways with less force. Maximum lung volumes are increased and lung expansion is more uniform. Exogenous surfactants can mimic the effects of natural surfactant, but it takes up to ten times the quantity of exogenous surfactant to generate the same effects as endogenous surfactant (Seidner et al. 1988 ; Ikegami et al. 1989 ).",

            "text": "Using surfactant prior to the onset RDS can reduce ventilator-induced lung injury (Halliday 2006 ; Donn and Sinha 2006 ) . Prophylactic versus selective rescue surfactant has been shown to be superior in terms of mortality (OR 0.61 95 % CI 0.28, 0.77), BPD or death (OR 0.85 95 % CI 0.76, 0.95) and pneumothorax(OR 0.54, 95 % CI 0.42, 0.84) (Soll and Morley 2001 ) . However, there has not been shown to be a difference in mortality depending on whether the dose is given prior to mechanical ventilation or following stabilisation (Kendig et al. 1998 ) ; there is no defi nite answer as to how early, early treatment should be (Soll and Morley 2001 ; Yost and Soll 2000 ) . Currently data would suggest that there is not much difference between early CPAP with prophylactic surfactant via brief intubation, early CPAP and selective rescue surfactant, intubation with prophylactic surfactant or rescue endotracheal intubation and rescue surfactant (Thomson 2002 The dose of surfactant recommended by most manufacturers is 100 mg/kg. Smaller doses have been shown to be less effective (Konishi et al. 1988 ; Halliday et al. 1993 ) , and larger doses may have a quicker effect but confer no ongoing advantages (Halliday et al. 1993 ) . Manufacturers recommend repeat doses at 12 h, but if there is severe disease with extensive protein leak, much of the second dose may be inactivated. Early delivery of the second dose in infants with high ventilatory or oxygen requirements may be more advantageous (Figueras-Aloy et al. 2001 ) . A Cochrane review looking at single versus multiple doses of surfactant described two papers using animal-derived surfactants showing that multiple doses resulted in fewer pneumothoraces (RR 0.51, 95 % CI 0.30, 0.88) and a trend towards lower mortality (RR 0.63, 95 % CI 0.39, 1.02). They also described one study, using synthetic surfactant, that showed lower rates of necrotising enterocolitis (NEC) following multiple doses (RR 0.20, 95 % CI 0.08, 0.51) and lower mortality (RR 0.56, 95 % CI 0.39, 0.81). The review concluded that if an infant has ongoing respiratory insuffi ciency, then repeated doses of surfactant are benefi cial (Soll and Ozek 2009 Almost all surfactant is given directly into the endotracheal tube as a bolus. There has not been shown to be any benefi t in performing physical manoeuvres aiming to direct surfactant into different areas of the lungs (Zola et al. 1993 ). In the modern era of minimal ventilation, there is considerable interest in a technique of surfactant delivery that does not require intubation. Endotracheal intubation has inherent risks; it frequently takes longer than the recommended time to perform (O'Donnell et al. 2006 ) and is often not successful at the fi rst attempt (Leone et al. 2005 ) . There are reports of success using alternative delivery techniques. One group has reported using surfactant delivered via a small endotracheal catheter, under direct vision, and showed that the process was well tolerated and fi rst attempt at administration was successful in 80 % (Kribs et al. 2008 ). This method is now the subject of a randomised controlled trial. Two groups have published studies of aerosolised surfactant delivery, which appears feasible and safe (Berggren et al. 2000 ; Jorch et al. 1997 ) but requires further study (Mazela et al. 2007 ) , as animal data have suggested that drug distribution in the lungs may be very variable (Lewis et al. 1991 ) . A recent report of aerosolised lucinactant (Aerosurf TM ) also appears feasible and safe . Another group has delivered surfactant via laryngeal masks (Trevisanuto et al. 2005 ) ; this is also now the subject of an RCT. Kattwinkel et al. used surfactant instilled into the pharynx prior to delivery of the body and reported that the method was simple and safe and warrants a randomised trial (Kattwinkel et al. 2004 Lack of response to surfactant treatment may indicate persistent pulmonary hypertension, patent ductus arteriosus (PDA), air leak, shock, congenital infection or asphyxia (Wirbelauer and Speer 2009 ). In the absence of these confounding conditions, failure of response confers a worse prognosis (Skelton and Jeffery 1996 ; Kuint et al. 1994 Surfactant improves outcomes for small ventilated infants, but many of the trials investigating surfactant use were done in the pre-steroid era and general anaesthetic was routinely used for caesarean sections. The results, therefore, may not be so applicable to today's population of preterm babies. In some infants who have received antenatal steroids, who are not affected by anaesthetic agents and who are supported with early CPAP, it is not clear whether exogenous surfactant is needed at all.",

Adverse effects of morphine, such as delaying achievement of full enteral feeds, need to be considered when considering opioid treatment (Menon et al. 2008 ) . Midazolam is also commonly used for sedation of ventilated newborns, but again systematic review found no advantages when compared with either placebo or morphine. Midazolam use increased rates of adverse events including hypotension, death, longer duration of hospital stay, and more IVH and periventricular leukomalacia. The authors concluded that routine use of midazolam for sedation should not be recommended (Ng et al. 2003 ) . Neuromuscular paralysing agents are sometimes used to abolish spontaneous breathing patterns in infants with asynchronous respiratory effort. Cochrane review has shown that agents such as pancuronium have the potential to decrease air leak and IVH in such infants. Uncertainty regarding the long-term pulmonary and neurological effects of paralysing agents means that routine usage is not currently recommended (Cools and Offringa 2005 ) .",

            "text": "The defi nition of BPD has evolved over recent years from the original description of oxygen dependency at 28 days with corresponding x-ray changes (Northway et al. 1967 ). It has now been shown that oxygen dependence at 36 weeks corrected gestational age correlates better with longterm morbidity (Shennan et al. 1988 ). Infants born below 32 weeks gestation are assessed at 36 weeks corrected age, or at hospital discharge, whichever is sooner, and BPD is classifi ed as mild, moderate or severe. Infants who need supplemental oxygen at 28 days of age, but who are in air at 36 weeks corrected age, have mild disease. Infants requiring up to 30 % oxygen at 36 weeks corrected age have moderate disease, and infants requiring more than 30 % oxygen, or positive pressure support, have severe disease. Infants born after 32 weeks gestational age are assessed by the same criteria at 56 days of age, or at hospital discharge, whichever is sooner (Jobe and Bancalari 2001 ) . It is diffi cult to predict infants who will go on to develop BPD from the appearance of the initial x-rays as the fi ndings depend upon the amount of fetal lung fl uid present and the phase of respiratory cycle in which the x-ray was taken. Positive pressure support and early surfactant use improve the x-ray appearance so early images are a poor guide to outcome (Kanto et al. 1978 ) . The incidence of BPD in very low birth weight infants ranges from 15 to 50 %; quoted incidence varies as the proportion of extremely low birth weight babies in different studies varies . The oxygen saturation target, and ventilation strategy of individual neonatal units, infl uences the number of infants receiving supplemental oxygen and therefore the quoted rates of BPD. Numbers of infants with BPD have increased over recent years, and this may refl ect the increased survival of very low birth weight infants. Many factors affect the risk of developing BPD: the degree of prematurity, the severity of the disease, oxygen toxicity, effects of ventilator-induced lung injury (barotrauma, volutrauma, atelectasis, shear trauma and biotrauma), PDA and the presence or absence of air leak. Infants who develop BPD commonly have exacerbations of their lung disease in childhood, requiring readmission to paediatric wards both in the fi rst year (Mutch et al. 1986 ) and throughout childhood (McCormick et al. 1993 ). These infants are at risk of serious decompensation should they contract bronchiolitis, and regimens exist for respiratory syncytial virus prophylaxis to specifi c groups of children with BPD.",

Transmission of maternal IgG antibodies across the placenta confers a degree of immune protection. However, the neonate is poorly protected against organisms that predominantly evoke IgA or IgM antibodies.

Given the paucity of human data, some animal data may usefully inform clinical practice. Using an adult rat model of pseudomonas pneumonia, Lin et al. showed that the choice of ventilator parameters is potentially important in determining the outcome of pneumonia (Lin et al. 2003 ) . They compared an injurious mode of ventilation, zero PEEP and high tidal volumes with a lung protective strategy, standard PEEP and moderate tidal volume. Rats undergoing the injurious strategy had increased rates of bacteraemia and higher serum levels of infl ammatory cytokines. In a series of experiments using a newborn piglet model of group B streptococcal pneumonia, van Kaam and Lachmann demonstrated the importance of PEEP and atelectasis. The use of (1) surfactant prophylaxis and (2) a strategy of peak and end-expiratory pressures designed to avoid atelectasis each independently resulted in attenuated bacterial growth and translocation into the blood stream (van Kaam et al. 2004 ). In a similar study, this group compared three different PEEP levels after surfactant lavage and group B streptococcus inoculation. The lowest PEEP group had the worst lung function and the highest mortality. The highest PEEP group had higher rates of translocation of bacteria into the bloodstream than the optimum PEEP group (Lachmann et al. 2007 ). The implications for clinicians are that care should be exercised in choice of ventilator settings and overdistension and atelectasis should be avoided. There are no trials which defi nitively identify the role of high-frequency oscillatory ventilation in the management of neonatal pneumonia. Typically this form of support is reserved for the sickest infants, i.e. those with the most diffi culties with oxygenation and carbon dioxide retention. Donn and Sinha appropriately caution clinicians using high-frequency ventilation for infants with sepsis as this modality may exacerbate an already compromised cardiac output (Donn and Sinha 2003 ) . Judicious use of volume replacement and inotropes may be required when this form of ventilation is used in infants with severe respiratory failure and hemodynamic compromise. When pulmonary hypertension is a feature, typically in group B streptococcal pneumonia, the combination of high-frequency ventilation and nitric oxide may be appropriate. Kinsella and Abman suggest that for pulmonary hypertension where diffuse parenchymal disease and underinfl ation are features, e.g. neonatal pneumonia, recruitment of air spaces using high-frequency oscillatory ventilation enhances delivery and effectiveness of inhaled nitric oxide (Kinsella and Abman 1998 ",

Once inhaled, meconium migrates distally down the tracheobronchial tree, obstructing airways of progressively smaller diameter (Tyler et al. 1978 ; Tran et al. 1980 ; Davey et al. 1993 ). In some instances there appears to be a considerable component of ' ball-valve' obstruction, with high resistance to airfl ow in expiration, and thus resultant gas trapping distal to the obstruction (Tran et al. 1980 ) . If global in distribution, high functional residual capacity may result, although only in a small proportion of infants with MAS is there measurably high FRC Yeh et al. 1982 ) , and even then only transiently (Yeh et al. 1982 ) . For most infants with MAS, obstruction of the airways with meconium leads to downstream atelectasis ( Fig. 47.2 ) (Wiswell et al. 1994 ) . The juxtaposition of atelectatic and normally aerated lung units is refl ected in the patchy opacifi cation typically noted on chest x-ray in MAS (Fig. 47. 3 ) (Yeh et al. 1979 ) .",

Meconium is toxic to the alveolar epithelium (Oelberg et al. 1990 ; Higgins et al. 1996 ) , causing disruption of the alveolocapillary barrier and an exudative oedema not unlike that seen in acute respiratory distress syndrome. The underlying lung interstitium shows infl ammatory cell infi ltrate (Tyler et al. 1978 ; Davey et al. 1993 ) , and there is a cytokine release in part related to complement activation (Castellheim et al. 2005 ; Jones et al. 1996 ; Cayabyab et al. 2007 ). The alveolar oedema potentiates the local atelectasis, causing variable degrees of ventilation-perfusion mismatch, or, worse still, intrapulmonary shunt. Moreover, meconium causes a potent dose-dependent inhibition of surfactant function (Moses et al. 1991 ; Sun et al. 1993 ; Herting et al. 2001 ) , and, along with fi brinogen and haemoglobin in the exudate (Fuchimukai et al. 1987 ; Holm and Notter 1987 ) , impairs the capacity of endogenous surfactant to reduce surface tension. Stability of alveoli at end expiration is thus compromised (Possmayer 2004 ) , as is the capacity to clear oedema fl uid from the air spaces (Carlton et al. 1995 ) . The global consequence of these alveolar disturbances is a reduction in lung compliance (see below).",

Some studies in experimental animals have indicated that decreased compliance may be related to hyperinfl ation secondary to 'ball-valve' airway obstruction (Tran et al. 1980 ) . In human infants, poor compliance has been noted with low and high FRC, although the only study reporting measurement of both indices simultaneously has been in non-ventilated infants with MAS of mild to moderate severity (Yeh et al. 1982 ) . This study also demonstrated that most infants with MAS have FRC values in the normal range, with a subgroup showing high lung volumes, in particular, on the second day of life. Undoubtedly, in infants with more severe MAS requiring ventilation, there is the potential for overdistension of relatively unaffected lung regions which, due to their relatively long time constant, may empty incompletely during the ventilator expiratory cycle, especially at fast ventilator rates (Ramsden and Reynolds 1987 ) . Respiratory resistance has also been noted to be increased in some studies, but variations in the technique of measurement make interpretation of these results diffi cult (ATS-ERS Pediatrics Assembly 1993 ).

The fi rst of these is in utero passage of meconium, and the second is an exaggeration of the normal pattern of fetal respiration (Duenhoelter and Pritchard 1977 ) , to the point where the normal net effl ux of fl uid from the fetal lung is reversed and meconium gains entry into the lung in an amniotic fl uid vehicle. Inhalation of meconium or meconium-stained fl uid may also occur as an immediate postnatal event with the fi rst breaths of extrauterine life. The lack of impact of oropharyngeal suction performed prior to the fi rst breath on the risk and severity of subsequent MAS (Vain et al. 2004 ) suggests that postnatal inhalation of meconium is considerably less important as a cause of MAS, and that most cases are of prenatal origin. Passage of meconium in utero is frequent (~10-15 %) (Wiswell and Bent 1993 ) , with the most important determinant under normal circumstances being gestational age. Meconium passage occurs in 4 % of infants <38 weeks, 13 % at 39-40 weeks and 25-50 % of infants beyond 42 weeks (Ostrea and Naqvi 1982 ; Eden et al. 1987 ) and appears in many post-mature infants to be a physiological event not preceded by in utero compromise. On the other hand, in some instances prenatal meconium passage is clearly linked to fetal distress, with meconium-stained amniotic fl uid more likely to occur where there is low fetal pH and/or low Apgar scores (Wiswell and Bent 1993 ) .",

This proportion varies according to how assiduously non-ventilated cases are identifi ed in published series and also depends on ventilation practices of individual units. Indications for intubation of infants with MAS include (a) high oxygen requirement (FiO 2 > 0.8), (b) respiratory acidosis, with arterial pH persistently less than 7.25, (c) pulmonary hypertension and (d) circulatory compromise, with poor systemic blood pressure and perfusion (Goldsmith 2008 ) . Except in emergency circumstances, intubation of infants with MAS should be performed with premedication. Signifi cant endotracheal tube leak is a major barrier to effective ventilation in infants with MAS, and in most cases a size 3.5 mm internal diameter endotracheal tube will be required. Once intubated, tolerance of the endotracheal tube will require ongoing sedation with infusions of an opiate (e.g. morphine or fentanyl) (Aranda et al. 2005 ), possibly supplemented with a benzodiazepine. Additionally, continuation of muscle relaxant drugs is often helpful during the stabilisation period after intubation, particularly in infants with coexistent pulmonary hypertension. ",

Another study found, in a group of 93 infants >2 kg birth weight (including an unspecifi ed number with MAS), that use of SIMV was associated with a shorter duration of ventilation compared with IMV (Bernstein et al. 1996 ) . Despite the relative paucity of evidence in favour, it seems logical to use a synchronised mode of ventilation in any spontaneously breathing ventilated infant with MAS. Trigger sensitivity should be set somewhat higher than for a preterm infant and should take into account the possibility of autocycling if there is a tube leak . There have been no clinical trials in patients with MAS comparing SIMV and synchronised intermittent positive pressure ventilation (SIPPV), also known as assist control. Given the propensity for gas trapping in MAS, there is some concern that using SIPPV may lead to high levels of inadvertent positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) with resultant hyperinfl ation. For this reason SIMV may be the most appropriate mode of ventilation in MAS.",

No more recent clinical studies exist to guide PEEP selection in MAS; physiological principles dictate that if atelectasis predominates (Fig. 47.3b ) , PEEP should be increased up to 10 cm H 2 O, whereas for regional or global hyperinfl ation (Fig. 47.3c ) , a lower PEEP (3-4 cm H 2 O) may be necessary (Goldsmith 2008 ) .

Term infants have generally longer time constants than their preterm counterparts (Wood 2003 ) and thus require a longer inspiratory time (around 0.5 s) to allow near-full equilibration of lung volume change in response to the applied peak pressure. Even longer inspiratory times may be useful for lung recruitment during inspiration if atelectasis is prominent. Especially if there is gas trapping and expiratory airfl ow limitation, optimal conventional ventilation in MAS requires the use of a relatively low ventilator rate (<50) and hence longer expiratory time. This will help to avoid inadvertent PEEP. The resultant minute ventilation must be suffi cient to produce adequate CO 2 clearance. An acceptable arterial pCO 2 range is 40-60 mmHg and pH 7.3-7.4, which is achievable in most infants even when there is signifi cant parenchymal disease combined with PPHN (Gupta et al. 2002 ) . Hyperventilation-induced alkalosis, which anecdotally appeared to reduce the need for extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) in infants with PPHN (Walsh-Sukys et al. 2000 ) , is no longer practised, in part due to the risk of sensorineural hearing loss (Hendricks-Munoz and Walton 1988 ).",

Published series from large neonatal databases suggest that 20-30 % of all infants requiring intubation and ventilation with MAS are treated with high-frequency ventilation (Dargaville and Copnell 2006 ; Singh et al. 2009b ; Tingay et al. 2007 ) , with most of these receiving HFOV rather than high-frequency jet ventilation (HFJV). Indications for transitioning to HFOV include ongoing hypoxaemia and/or high FiO 2 and, less commonly, respiratory acidosis. In infants with signifi cant atelectasis, adequate lung recruitment may require the application of a mean airway pressure ( P AW ) considerably higher than on conventional ventilation (up to 25 cm H 2 O in some cases), with a stepwise recruitment manoeuvre likely to be the most effective (Pellicano et al. 2009 ). Once oxygenation has improved, P AW should then be reduced; most infants with MAS requiring HFOV can be stabilised using a P AW around 16-20 cm H 2 O, with gradual weaning in the days thereafter . Infants with prominent gas trapping may tolerate the recruitment process poorly, with reductions in oxygenation and systemic blood pressure and the potential for exacerbation of pulmonary hypertension. Recruitment manoeuvres of some form can still be advantageous in this group, with the benefi t becoming apparent when the P AW is reduced.",

In experimental models of MAS, high oscillatory frequency (15 Hz) is associated with worsening of gas trapping (Hachey et al. 1998 ) . HFOV can also lend a clinical advantage in infants with signifi cant coexisting PPHN, as the response to inhaled nitric oxide (iNO) is better when delivered on HFOV compared to conventional ventilation (Kinsella et al. 1997 ) . Early reports suggested that up to half of infants with MAS treated with HFOV did not respond adequately and went on to receive ECMO (Carter et al. 1990 ; Paranka et al. 1995 ) . More recent experience would suggest that only around 5 % of infants treated with HFOV and iNO fail to respond and transition to ECMO (Wiswell et al. 1990 ).",

Four randomised controlled trials of bolus surfactant therapy have been conducted (Findlay et al. 1996 ; Lotze et al. 1998 ; Chinese Collaborative Study Group for Neonatal Respiratory Diseases 2005 ; Maturana et al. 2005 ) , which when analysed together show a benefi t in terms of reduction in need for ECMO, but not duration of ventilation or other pulmonary outcomes (El Shahed et al. 2007 ). In the developed world, bolus surfactant therapy is currently used in 30-50 % of ventilated infants with MAS (Dargaville and Copnell 2006 ; Singh et al. 2009b ). Bolus surfactant therapy should be used judiciously in MAS, choosing infants with severe disease, and treating early, and if necessary, repeatedly (Dargaville and Mills 2005 ) .",

Each trial included a large subgroup with MAS; overall more than 640 infants with MAS have been enrolled in iNO trials, although few have reported the outcome for MAS separately. The potential value of delivering iNO during HFOV has been highlighted in one trial, in which the proportion of nonresponders was lowest when the two therapies were combined (Kinsella et al. 1997 ) . Currently around 20-30 % of all ventilated infants with MAS receive iNO (Dargaville and Copnell 2006 ; Singh et al. 2009b ) , and around 40-60 % show a sustained response (Gupta et al. 2002 ; Kinsella et al. 1997 ) . The approach to an infant with MAS and coexistent PPHN should initially focus on optimising the ventilatory management and, in particular, overcoming atelectasis if this is prominent radiologically. The severity of PPHN should be assessed clinically and by echocardiogram if available. If moderate to severe PPHN persists after appropriate ventilatory manoeuvres and the pO 2 remains at less than 80-100 mmHg in FiO 2 1.0 (Kinsella et al. 1997 ; Wessel et al. 1997 ) , iNO should commence at a dose of 10-20 ppm.

With the advent of newer therapies, the number of infants with MAS treated with EMCO has decreased (Fliman et al. 2006 ), but survival with ECMO treatment for MAS has remained high (around 95 %) (Short 2008 ) . The usual indication for commencing ECMO is intractable hypoxaemia despite optimisation of the patient's condition with available therapies (including high-frequency ventilation and iNO and bolus surfactant therapy). Degree of hypoxaemia in this setting has generally been quantifi ed using oxygenation index (OI), where OI = P AW \u00d7 FiO 2 \u00d7 100 / PaO 2 . An OI persistently above 40 despite aggressive standard management has been, and remains, an indication for treatment with ECMO where available (UK Collaborative ECMO Trial Group 1996 ).",

Pneumothorax is associated with an increase in the risk of mortality (Dargaville and Copnell 2006 ; Lin et al. 2004 ) , in part related to the severity of the associated lung disease, but also to the destabilising infl uence of the air leak itself. Clinicians should remain attuned to the possibility of pneumothorax in ventilated infants, particularly those prone to gas trapping, and should employ ventilatory strategies to avoid regional and global overdistension wherever possible. Effective treatment requires that air be evacuated from the pleural space immediately once the condition is diagnosed, and then in most instances, an intercostal drainage tube is required to control ongoing air leak.",

            "text": "The management of congenital diaphragmatic hernia (CDH) in the newborn infant has changed radically since the fi rst successful outcomes were reported 60 years ago (Gross 1946 ) . Then it seemed a surgical problem with a surgical solution -do an operation, remove the intestines and solid viscera from the thoracic cavity, repair the defect and allow the lung to expand. CDH in that era was regarded as the quintessential neonatal surgical emergency. The expectation was that urgent surgery would result in improvement in lung function and oxygenation. That approach persisted up to the 1980s when it was realised that the problem was far more complex and involved both an abnormal pulmonary vascular bed and pulmonary hypoplasia. The use of systemically delivered pulmonary vasodilator therapy became a focus of interest in the 1980s with case reports and small case series suggesting improved survival. In the 1990s, based on studies that showed worsening thoracic compliance and gas exchange following surgical repair, deferred surgery and preoperative stabilisation became the standard of care. At the same time, extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) was increasingly used either as part of preoperative stabilisation or as a rescue therapy after repair. Other centres chose to use high-frequency oscillatory ventilation (HFOV). Despite all these innovations, the survival rate in live-born infants with CDH did not improve to much more than 50 % in large series published from high-volume centres. However, in the past 10 years, there has been an appreciable improvement in survival to the extent that many centres are now reporting survival rates of greater than 80 %. Probably the biggest impact on this improvement has been the recognition of the role that ventilation-induced lung injury plays in mortality and the need for ECMO rescue. This has ushered in an era of a lung protective or 'gentle ventilation' strategy which has now been widely adopted as a standard approach and has largely been responsible for survival rates of 80 % or higher being reported by high-volume centres.",

Eighty-fi ve per cent are left sided, and the most common form is the classic posterolateral or Bochdalek hernia. There is a reported incidence of 40-50 % of other malformations in association with CDH, the most common of which are those involving the central nervous system (Tibboel and Gaag 1996 ) . The most important, in terms of prognosis, is congenital heart anomalies. Approximately 11-15 % of CDH infants will have heart defects based on a recent review of the literature, the most common being atrial and ventricular septal defects, conotruncal defects (tetralogy, transposition, pulmonary atresia, double outlet right ventricle) and left ventricular outfl ow tract obstruction (Lin et al. 2007 ) . Outcome data on this association are limited and confi ned to case reports or case series (Lin et al. 2007 ; Cohen et al. 2002 ; Torfs et al. 1992 ; Fauza and Wilson 1994 ) . Based on the physiology, hemodynamically signifi cant lesions associated with ventricular outfl ow tract obstruction (hypoplastic left heart syndrome, tetralogy, coarctation) or those with high pulmonary blood fl ow (atrioventricular septal defect, large perimembranous ventricular septal defects) will have more impact on mortality compared to atrial and small ventricular septal defects. CDH is also associated with chromosomal abnormalities both in number (Turner's syndrome, trisomy 13 and18) and in specifi c chromosomal aberrations (Fryns syndrome). A rare familial association has also been reported (Frey et al. 1991 ).",

            "text": "The key principles of successful delivery room resuscitation and stabilisation are based on early intubation and positive pressure ventilation. Bag mask ventilation should be avoided to prevent gut distention. A recent study that measured tidal volume and airway pressure during spontaneous and assisted breathing in newborn infants with CDH immediately after delivery showed that spontaneous breaths with assisted ventilation achieved a higher TV than manual infl ations alone (te Pas et al. 2009b ). There is increasing evidence that the use of 100 % oxygen has adverse long-term consequences and should be avoided (Davis et al. 2004a ) . The objective for ventilation should be the establishment of a satisfactory pre-ductal arterial saturation (>85 %) while at the same time avoiding the use of high infl ation pressures based on the hypothesis that this may injure the lung. An experimental study in a preterm lamb model of lung disease of prematurity has shown that as few as 6 high-volume lung infl ations at the time of delivery results in pulmonary barotrauma and a blunted response to surfactant (Bjorklund et al. 1997 ) . Although this is clearly not the same model as CDH, the lungs are hypoplastic and the potential for secondary injury exists. The objective of positive pressure ventilation should be to limit peak inspiratory pressure to 25 cm H 2 O and to target a pre-ductal SaO 2 of >85 % while tolerating hypercarbia (PaCO 2 45-55 mmHg) if necessary as long as there is a compensated pH (>7.35). Correction, using bicarbonate, if the pH is below that level, may be appropriate. Neuromuscular-blocking drugs are useful during the initial resuscitation, but evidence for their continued or routine use is controversial. Surfactant replacement therapy has also been advocated for infants who present with severe hypoxaemia and low Apgar scores based on some encouraging results in animal models of CDH, but this is not supported by any human data (Logan et al. 2007 ; Van Meurs 2004 ) . Standard additional procedures should include insertion of a nasogastric tube as well as arterial and central venous lines. Principles for the safe transport of these infants include a secure airway, gut decompression, adequate vascular access, a compensated pH and a pre-ductal saturation of >85 %.",

The approach in the past has been to make assumptions about pulmonary vascular resistance (PVR) based solely on gradients between pre-and post-ductal saturations and post-ductal PaO 2 measurements.

            "text": "No prospective trial ever demonstrated that this improved outcome, rather there is now persuasive evidence that it may indeed be harmful in terms of pulmonary barotrauma and cerebral vasoconstriction. As long ago as 1985, a 'permissive hypercapnia' strategy was advocated by Wung in ventilation of infants with PPHN, well before it was introduced into adult medicine (Wung et al. 1985 ) . Several retrospective series of CDH have shown that airway pressure limitation and tolerance of hypercarbia while focusing on pre-ductal oxygen saturation to be the most important factors in favourably infl uencing outcome (Bohn 2002 ; Bagolan et al. 2004 ; Boloker et al. 2002 ; Downard et al. 2003 ; Kays et al. 1999 ; Wilson et al. 1997 ; Wung et al. 1995 ) . These series report not only improved survival rates of up to 80 % but also a signifi cant reduction in the need for ECMO support. In the original CDH series, proposing this approach published by Wung et al. ( 1995 ) advocated that the key objective of conventional mechanical ventilation should be to keep PIP \u226425 cm H 2 O while maintaining a preductal SaO 2 >85 %. Patients were managed without muscle relaxation and a chest drain. In this situation, ductal shunting can be tolerated as long as right heart function is adequate. This is based on lessons learned from newborn infants with cyanotic congenital heart disease that a normal lactate, a mixed venous oxygen saturation (SvO 2 ) of >70 % and the absence of a metabolic acidosis are compatible with adequate oxygen delivery. Many centres are now opting to use HFOV as a way of avoiding barotrauma and report improved survival using this approach together with deferred surgery (Bohn 2002 ; Bagolan et al. 2004 ; Bouchut et al. 2000 ; Cacciari et al. 2001 ; Desfrere et al. 2000 ; Kamata et al. 1998 ; Migliazza et al. 2007 ; Miguet et al. 1994 ; Ng et al. 2008 ; Reyes et al. 1998 ; Skari et al. 2004 ; Somaschini et al. 1999 ). This had not been our experience when we were using hyperventilation as part of our strategy to reverse ductal shunting with HFOV as a rescue mode in the 1980s (Azarow et al. 1997 ) . When we performed a detailed analysis of post-mortem fi ndings in 1999, the most striking fi nding was not only the degree of pulmonary barotrauma and haemorrhage in the ipsilateral lung but also in the contralateral (Sakurai et al. 1999 ) . We believed that our error was to use HFOV with the ventilation strategy that incorporated lung recruitment as was commonly used in other forms of neonatal lung disease. The post-mortem study of fi ndings in 68 non-surviving infants with CDH from an era when we were using HFOV with a high mean airway pressure (>20 cm H 2 O) showed that the high mortality (50 %) could be partially attributed to pulmonary barotrauma causing damage to hypoplastic lungs (Sakurai et al. 1999 ). There was a high incidence of air leak as well as histology showing pulmonary haemorrhage and hyaline membrane formation. CDH does not represent a recruitable lung, and attempts to use a high mean airway pressure (MAP) are likely to cause secondary lung injury. More recent case series have recommended MAPs no higher than 14-16 cmH 2 O (Desfrere et al. 2000 ; Miguet et al. 1994 ; Somaschini et al. 1999 ) . We have now changed our philosophy on the use of HFOV from a rescue mode to an early intervention strategy in order to limit lung injury when PIP exceeds 25 cm H 2 O on conventional ventilation. The peak-to-peak pressures (amplitude) are adjusted to achieve a PaCO 2 in the range of 35-45 mmHg with a pH in the range of 7.35-7.45 as long as the pre-ductal SaO 2 is >85 %. Mean airway pressure is limited to 14-16 cmH 2 O. The adoption of this strategy has been associated with a signifi cant improvement in survival in our centre since 1995 (Bohn 2002 ) .",

            "text": "Compliance in CDH For many years there was an assumption that surgical repair would improve gas exchange by relieving compression of the ipsilateral lung which formed the basis for surgical repair. Formal measurements of thoracic compliance and blood gases before and after repair not only showed that this was not so but also, on the contrary, demonstrated a deterioration which was associated with a rise in PaCO 2 actually for the same ventilator settings (Fig. 47.4 ) . There are several possible explanations for this fi nding. Firstly, the abdominal cavity may be somewhat small because the viscera have been in the chest during fetal life and surgical repair and closure restricts movement of both diaphragms. Secondly, the repair itself can stretch the diaphragm especially if the defect is large and a patch is not used. These fi ndings resulted in resetting the priorities for the timing of surgical repair which have changed substantially in the past two decades and provided the rationale for delayed surgery and preoperative stabilisation which has now become widely accepted practice. The decision on timing of repair is based on evaluating the infant's haemodynamic and pulmonary profi le. Surgery should be delayed until such time as there has been a reduction in PVR, and satisfactory ventilation can be maintained with low PIP and inspired oxygen requirements. Infants with mild forms of CDH with a low PIP and minimal shunting can be repaired within the fi rst 24-48 h of life, while infants who are labile with right-to-left shunting should have surgery deferred on a day-to-day basis until such time as they stabilise, even if this requires protracted periods of preoperative ventilation. Where HFOV is used, surgery should be delayed until such time as the infant can be switched back to conventional ventilation and managed with peak airway pressures of <25 cm H 2 O as this meets a defi nition of stability. We do not undertake surgical repair in infants with pre-ductal hypoxaemia and hypercarbia which cannot be reversed by therapies outlined in the previous sections. In terms of surgical repair, Gortex, Marlex or biosynthetic porcine patches are commonly used to close large defects that cannot be closed by primary repair without major distortion of the thorax, but these are associated with a signifi cant recurrence rate (Hajer et al. 1998 ; Moss et al. 2001 ; St Peter et al. 2007 ). Data from the CDH Registry has shown that there is a relationship between defect size and outcome (Lally et al. 2007 ). Reduction of the hernia with replacement of the abdominal viscera is frequently associated with diffi cult abdominal wound closure and an adverse change in respiratory system compliance. The use of an abdominal silo to counter this problem has been suggested in some studies (Kyzer et al. 2004 ; Rana et al. 2008 ) . There is no indication to insert pleural drains at the time of surgery, and they are only needed in the postoperative period in the event that there is an accumulation of pleural fl uid that results in mediastinal shift or a contralateral pneumothorax (Wung et al. 1995 ) . There has been an increasing trend to opt for non-invasive surgical repair techniques. Although this can be done successfully, there are a signifi cant number of cases where the procedure has to be changed to an open reduction or there has been a recurrence of the hernia (Kyzer et al. 2004 ; Chiu and Hedrick 2008 ; Cho et al. 2009 ; Guner et al. 2008 ; Yang et al. 2005 ) . Given this and the fact that the non-invasive technique is unlikely to shorten the ICU length of stay or the time on mechanical ventilation, this approach is diffi cult to rationalise except on the basis of the cosmetic effect.",

            "text": "Increased pulmonary vascular resistance (PVR) is an almost universal fi nding in CDH even when not clinically manifest by right-to-left shunting at ductal level. The diagnosis of PPHN in CDH is usually made on the basis of a pre-/post-ductal saturation gradient. However, as this only occurs when pulmonary artery pressure exceeds systemic, in the absence of this fi nding, there is little clinical information on the level of pulmonary artery pressure (PAP). Therefore, the information obtained by echocardiography is becoming an increasingly important tool in the management of CDH, fi rstly to exclude an associated congenital heart defect but also to assess the degree of pulmonary hypertension. Important prognostic information may also be available in predicting outcome. In a single-centre retrospective review by Dillon, all infants with subsystemic PA pressures survived (Dillon et al. 2004 (Buss et al. 2006 ; Inamura et al. 2005 ; Kinsella et al. 2005 ) . Furthermore, in light of studies that have shown that left ventricular (LV) mass is decreased in infants with CDH (Schwartz et al. 1994 ; Siebert et al. 1984 ) leading to compromise of LV function, there is an additional rationale to maintaining ductal patency . Although undesirable, ductal shunting can be tolerated by the infant as long as pre-ductal saturations are maintained in the 80-85 % as this refl ects very adequate cerebral oxygenation. Indeed, saturations in this range are a common scenario in many forms of cyanotic congenital heart disease. The use of hyperventilation to reverse this is likely to do more harm than good in that it exchanges ventilator-induced lung injury for better systemic oxygenation.",

A randomised trial of the use of iNO in PPHN which included infants with CDH showed that they were the group that responded least well with no impact on survival or the use of ECMO (The Neonatal Inhaled Nitric Oxide Study Group (NINOS) 1997 ). However, a more accurate assessment of the response to iNO is by cardiac echo, and if a reduction of right ventricular pressure is documented, the therapy is worth continuing, accepting that it is unlikely that the dramatic reductions in PVR, seen in other forms of PPHN, will occur. Ductal shunting and low systemic pressures can also be improved by the use of inotropic support, particularly if there is right heart failure. There is also increasing interest in the use of phosphodiesterase inhibitors in the treatment of PPHN, specifi cally the PDE5 inhibitor sildenafi l. A recent open-label study of an IV infusion of the drug in hypoxic neonates showed an improvement in OI (Steinhorn et al. 2009 ). There are also some small case series of sildenafi l being used successfully in the management of sustained pulmonary hypertension in CDH (Keller et al. 2004 ; Noori et al. 2007 ; Rocha et al. 2008 ) .",

            "text": "When it was fi rst introduced, ECMO was originally used in the rescue of infants with severe hypoxaemia after surgical repair. Many centres now opt to use ECMO as part of a deferred repair strategy, together with other therapies such as iNO and HFOV, to stabilise the infant prior to repair and perform the surgery either just prior to weaning from support or after decannulation. Data from the CDH Registry suggests that repair post ECMO is associated with the best outcome (Bryner et al. 2009 ). The latest innovation in extracorporeal support has been the so-called EXIT to ECMO strategy where prenatally identifi ed high-risk infants are cannulated immediately after delivery while still connected to the placenta (Bouchard et al. 2002 ; Kunisaki et al. 2007 ). The most commonly used cannulation technique is veno-arterial, although some centres have reported success with the veno-venous approach (Austin et al. 2004 ; Dimmitt et al. 2001 ; Heiss et al. 1995 ; Kugelman et al. 2003 ) . Venous cannulation pre-repair may be problematic because of caval distortion when the liver is herniated. The duration of support is frequently prolonged, the average in the ELSO database being 10 days with a duration up to 50 days. Morbidity in terms of pulmonary and neurocognitive function post ECMO in survivors is signifi cant (Van Meurs 2004 ; D'Agostino et al. 1995 ; Davis et al. 2004b ; McGahren et al. 1997 ; Nijhuis-van der Sanden et al. 2009 ; Stolar et al. 1995 ) . It is also a highly costly therapy which, in one series, was reported to be $365,000 per survivor in 1995 US dollars (Metkus et al. 1995 ) . The indications for the use of ECMO in CDH are far from clear as indeed are the data which suggest that there is a clear benefi t in terms of survival and long-term outcome associated with its use.",

            "text": "There is a wealth of case series and database material which puts ECMO in a favourable light. Many centres with a historically high mortality rate in the 1990s (>50 %) reported an improvement in survival with the introduction of delayed repair and the use of ECMO as a rescue therapy Frenckner et al. 1997 ; Heiss et al. 1989 ; Semakula et al. 1997 ; vd Staak et al. 1995 ; West et al. 1992 ) . However, this must be now placed into the context of reports of survival rates of >80 % either from centres where ECMO is not available (Bagolan et al. 2004 ; Al-Shanafey et al. 2002 ) or where there has been the adoption of alternate management strategies which has led to a signifi cant reduction in the need for ECMO (Bohn 2002 ; Boloker et al. 2002 ; Kays et al. 1999 ; Wilson et al. 1997 ; Miguet et al. 1994 ; Azarow et al. 1997 ; Mettauer et al. 2009 ). In terms of large case series from high volume (>10 cases/year), the evidence for improved outcome with ECMO is not persuasive. In a retrospective review of over 400 infants with CDH from The Children's Hospital, Boston, and The Hospital for Sick Children, Toronto, outcome was compared between 1981 and 1994 during an era where the major changes were deferred surgery and the use of ECMO (Wilson et al. 1997 ; Azarow et al. 1997 ) . In the Boston series, ECMO was used in 50 % of cases as the rescue mode, while in Toronto HFOV was used with only very occasional resort to ECMO (1 %). The survival rate in the two institutions was the same (53 % vs. 55 %). Since the introduction of a lung protective ventilation strategy, the survival rate has risen in both institutions to 80 % or higher. Most high-volume centres are experiencing a reduction in ECMO use in CDH (Kays et al. 1999 ; Wilson et al. 1997 ; Mettauer et al. 2009 ). which parallels the declining numbers in all forms of neonatal respiratory failure (Hintz et al. 2000 ) . Although many reasons for this have been suggested, a major contributing factor has been the change in ventilation practice. This was confi rmed when data from the ELSO Registry between 1988 and 1997 was analysed (Roy et al. 2000 ) . This showed a reduction in the annual numbers of neonatal ECMO support from 1991 onwards which coincided with an increased use of HFOV and iNO. Perhaps of more signifi cance, the mean level of PIP prior to the initiation of ECMO had fallen from 47 \u00b1 10 cm H 2 O in 1988 to 39 \u00b1 12 cmH 2 O in 1997.",

A Cochrane review of published studies concluded that there is evidence for short-term efficacy, but it is unclear whether there is long-term benefi t as defi ned as improved survival without increase morbidity (Elbourne et al. 2002 ) . Perhaps the more relevant question now is: in an era of ' gentle ventilation', does the use of ECMO result in not only improved survival but without increase morbidity? The hypothesis could be tested in a prospective multicentre RCT, but it is unlikely to happen because of lack of equipoise. One of the major diffi culties is selection criteria and what constitutes the need for ECMO. Traditionally an oxygenation index (OI) >40 has been used and was the entry criteria for the UK randomised trial (UK Collaborative ECMO Trail Group 1996 ) , but as it is most frequently calculated from a post-ductal PaO 2 , it is largely infl uenced by a right-to-left shunt at ductal level. Previous studies that used the relationship between PaCO 2 and ventilation parameters to defi ne severity are no longer relevant in an era when permissive hypercapnia ventilation is widely practised. The most frequently cited criterion is now 'failure of medical management' which is obviously diffi cult to defi ne. Does this mean that all patients should be considered eligible for ECMO, exclusive of those with other major congenital anomalies?",

In our centre we would only consider the use of ECMO in those infants who decompensate with severe preductal hypoxaemia and right-to-left shunting due to high PVR, where we are unable to maintain a pre-ductal SaO 2 >85 % and who fail to respond to a management strategy that includes HFOV, iNO, inotropic support or opening the ductus with PGE 1 (Bohn 2002 ; Buss et al. 2006 ). We would not offer ECMO to infants with severe pulmonary hypoplasia, as defi ned by severe hypercarbia in the immediate postdelivery period and the inability to demonstrate a pre-ductal SaO 2 of >85 % at some stage after initial resuscitation. Since 1995 we have used ECMO in only 18 infants with only 6 survivors but still have an overall 80 % survival.",

There is a price tag for this improvement in survival which has been increase in morbidity in those infants who previously would have died. There has been a rise in the number of reports of survivors with chronic lung disease, recurrent or residual pulmonary hypertension, gastroesophageal refl ux, oral feeding aversion, poor weight gain, hernia recurrence, pectus excavatum, scoliosis, pulmonary hypertension, neurosensory hearing loss and delayed neurodevelopment Stolar et al. 1995 ; Bernbaum et al. 1995 ; Chiu et al. 2006 ; Hunt et al. 2004 ; Jaillard et al. 2003 ; Jakobson et al. 2009 ; Koivusalo et al. 2008 ; Morini et al. 2008 ; Muratore et al. 2001a , b ; Rasheed et al. 2001 ; Stolar 1996 ; Stolar et al. 1990 ; Van Meurs et al. 1993 ; Vanamo et al. 1996a , b , c ) . The incidence of morbidity is higher in these infants treated with ECMO and those requiring patch closure (Jaillard et al. 2003 ; Lund et al. 1994 ). One of the major areas of concern is that of neurological morbidity. In a study published from Boston Children's Hospital in 1994, 30 % of CDH infants where ECMO was used had abnormal CT scans (Lund et al. 1994 ) . These abnormalities are independent of ECMO use. A report by Hunt using MRI showed a high incidence of ventriculomegaly, white matter and basal ganglia abnormalities in a series of CDH survivors where ECMO was not used (Hunt et al. 2004 ) . A long-term follow-up study from this institution has shown an increased incidence of oral motor and visuomotor control in 10-16 year old CDH patients compared to controls (Jakobson et al. 2009 ). The underlying causes of which are probably multifactorial and include perinatal asphyxia and hypoxaemia, alkalosis to treat ductal shunting and ECMO support. As might be predicted there is a high incidence of problems of gastroesophageal refl ux (GER) and feeding diffi culties in severe CDH infants who are now surviving. The incidence depends on the era studied and the length of follow-up (Koivusalo et al. 2008 ; Muratore et al. 2001b ; Stolar et al. 1990 ; Arena et al. 2008 ) . Data from a multidisciplinary follow-up clinic has shown a 32 % incidence of GER with 19 % of patients undergoing fundoplication. Twentyfour per cent had aversion to oral feeding and 56 % were below the 25th percentile for weight despite the use of gastrostomy tubes (Muratore et al. 2001b ). More extended and detailed follow-up studies have shown that between a third and a half of patients have oesophageal abnormalities by endoscopy (Koivusalo et al. 2008 ; Arena et al. 2008 ) .",

Studies of pulmonary function and cardiorespiratory exercise done on adolescents also from our centre who came from an era when the survival rate was 50 % showed some degree of airway obstruction but near normal exercise capacity compared with normal controls (Trachsel et al. 2005 (Trachsel et al. , 2006 . However, follow-up studies from Boston Children's Hospital where they report 90 % survival show prolonged ICU stays and duration of ventilation with 16 % of infants oxygen dependent at the time of discharge (Muratore et al. 2001a ) . Two studies have reported that 4 % of patients in their series have required tracheostomy (Jaillard et al. 2003 ; Bagolan and Morini 2007 ) . Obstructive airways disease is seen in up to 25 % of survivors and chronic lung disease in up to 22 % (Jaillard et al. 2003 ; Ijsselstijn et al. 1997 ) . Chest and musculoskeletal deformities are also being documented more frequently in multidisciplinary follow-up clinics, and these include pectus excavatum and scoliosis (Vanamo et al. 1996a ; Lund et al. 1994 ; Nobuhara et al. 1996 ) . Many of these complications are more frequently seen in infants where the defect is large and requires a patch repair and the use of ECMO, which again refl ects the severity of the disease (Lally et al. 2007 ; Stolar 1996 ; Muratore and Wilson 2000 ) . Infants with CDH in this new era require more than the traditional surgical follow-up clinic visits, and many centres, including our own, have now developed multidisciplinary clinics involving general surgeons, chest physicians, dieticians, neonatal follow-up specialists and cardiologists (Lally and Engle 2008 ) . It is only with this coordinated approach that these medically challenging infants will receive the appropriate care for their ongoing problems.",

            "text": "Congenital diaphragmatic hernia is a complex disease with, until this decade, a 50 % mortality due to a pathophysiology which combines pulmonary hypoplasia and pulmonary vascular disease. The introduction of delayed surgical repair and ECMO in the 1990s was associated with an improved survival in centres with previous high mortality rates. Equivalent improvements were seen in centres where HFOV was used as a rescue therapy. There has been a marked improvement in survival with the widespread adoption of lung protective ventilation strategies but at the cost of signifi cant morbidity in infants with hypoplastic lungs and large diaphragmatic defects. The challenge facing those involved in postnatal management of CDH, especially in centres that offer ECMO, is to decide which infants have the capacity to survive without major morbidity, in particular, neurodevelopmental outcomes. The challenge facing those who advocate prenatal intervention, in an era of 80-90 % survival, is to demonstrate that the predictors they use are robust, easily implemented across centres and are reproducible. If they are, then they need to show in a carefully designed RCT, which includes standardised postnatal management which incorporates current best practice, that tracheal occlusion reduces morbidity. Finally, there is a striking difference in survival in the CDH Registry (68 %) and the >80 survival reported in high-volume centres. Given the fact that CDH is a complex cardiorespiratory disease and that the Canadian Neonatal Network has shown that there is a relationship between volume and outcome (Javid et al. 2004 ), a strong argument can be made for care of these infants to be regionalised to high-volume centres where multidisciplinary, highly specialised management is available.",

Immediately at birth the newborn employs intricate breathing patterns that establish and maintain airway volume and attain ventilation. Thereafter, throughout life the normal breathing pattern, eupnoea, can be gentle tidal breathing that is involuntary and hardly sensed, but many other breathing patterns are employed in normal conditions. Thus, an expanded view of normal breathing is that it consists of centrally controlled coordinated muscular activities which aim to ensure that the airway is protected and has optimal supra-and sub-glottic volumes to maintain homoeostasis and provide a stable platform to enable ventilation with ensuing effi cient gas exchange and transport (Hutchison 2007 ) .

Two features of central control deserve emphasis. There is a redundancy to the circuitry, with alternative drives and pathways, and there is a motor control hierarchy: rapid airway protection takes precedence over control of absolute airway volume, which in turn takes precedence over relative tidal volume changes. Control of breathing is exercised by the coordinated activities of the nasal, pharyngeal, laryngeal and pump muscles which, in concert with lower airway smooth muscle tone that adjusts airway wall stiffness, alter the transairway pressure gradients. The result is that tidal ventilation occurs simultaneously with the control of total airway volume, which adjusts airway pressure critical for patency, central feedback and likely drive threshold (Adrian 1933 ). Airway and chest wall neural feedback is rapid (milliseconds) and crucial for homoeostasis, enabling the controller to adjust fl ow within a breath and match motor outputs with the structural characteristics of the different parts of the respiratory system and their associated mechanics. Feedback from blood gaseous and chemical sensors occurs within seconds. \u2026thoracic gymnastics in preparation for the great extrauterine function of atmospheric respiration.",

Transient lacks of airfl ow are seen in patterns with glottic closure, e.g. during swallowing, defecating, lifting, coughing, yawning, crying or vocalising. Apnoea occurs with a minimal fall in the carbon dioxide tension (PCO 2 ) to below the apnoeic threshold (Khan et al. 2005 ) . Brief apnoeas are typifi ed by the brain's subsequent ability to return quickly to muscle activities that ventilate the airway. Clinical apnoea is a persistent lack of airfl ow without a spontaneous return to breathing.",

            "text": "Breathing patterns and apnoea can be viewed as a spectrum/continuum (Fig. 47.6 ). Throughout life, rapid changes in pattern are dependent upon the status of the central circuitry, its response hierarchy and its different inputs. Central setting of optimal homoeostatic limits must vary constantly with inputs sensing changes in growth and in the individual's internal and external environments. It is speculated that during sleep, 'virtual' central conditions allow the limits to be reset/ tuned (Hutchison 2007 Rostral and caudal CNS structures infl uence the control of breathing patterns (Feldman and Del Negro 2006 ; Rybak et al. 2008 ) . Lesioning studies in animals have identifi ed that, at a minimum, eupnoea requires a pontomedullary neuronal network (Rybak et al. 2008 ) . When both upper pontine respiratory neuronal groups (PRG) and vagal afferents are removed, the lower pontinemedullary output is apneusis, a pattern typifi ed by prolonged inspiratory drive. The generation of signals for coordination of laryngeal and diaphragmatic activities appears to be dependent upon an intact lower pons (Hutchison and Speck 2003 ) . Inspiratory and pre-inspiratory neurons involved in rhythm generation have been identifi ed in the ventral medullary pre-B\u00f6tzinger and parafacial regions, respectively. Neurons in the B\u00f6tzinger complex exert mainly expiratory control (Feldman and Del Negro 2006 ) . Specifi c types of premotor medullary neurons have been classifi ed by their signal shapes and timings. Their actions result in a central breathing cycle consisting of three phases: inspiration, postinspiration and expiration (Feldman and Del Negro 2006 ) . Mechanical changes following these outputs are seen well in grunting (see Sect. 4.1 ). Protective, mechanical and speech-related changes occur quickly within a breath; thus, phase-switching and pattern-switching neurons are important (Rybak et al. 2008 ) (Fig. 47.6 ) . Apnoea of prematurity is associated with incomplete brain development, including decreased cell synapses, dendrites, myelinisation and brainstem conduction (Darnall et al. 2006 (Darnall et al. 2006 ) . The neurochemistry in preterm infants favours neuronal inhibition over excitation. In animals, prostaglandin E production can be triggered by the cytokine IL-1\u03b2, while adenosine stimulates GABA production (Abu-Shaweesh and Martin 2008 ). Metabolism is increased by hyperthermia and decreased by hypothermia. Both hypothermia and hyperthermia can decrease breathing, suggesting that hypothermia decreases excitation more than inhibition and that hyperthermia augments the dominant intrinsic inhibitory pathways and their inputs. Thus, the importance of temperature homoeostasis is emphasised. Central apnoea may result from altered PRG input (Hutchison and Speck 2003 ) . When the PRG is removed from decerebrate cats, the response to an expiratory airway load is a pattern similar to central apnoea with an open glottis. In this circumstance, expiratory fl ow will occur passively until the relaxation volume (Vr) is reached (see Chap. 4.1 , Fig. 4.6 ) . Preterm infants actively maintain sub-glottic volume above their low Vr when awake, but during central sleep apnoeas the sub-glottic volume can decrease. This is especially seen in REM sleep when all types of apnoeas are more common and longer and can be associated with profound bradycardia. Central apnoea with glottic closure can also occur, e.g. in some human newborns who are depressed at birth, in preterm lambs (Praud and Reix 2005 ) and in gasping animals with exposure to acute cerebral hypoxia/ischaemia (Hutchison et al. 2002 ) . Gasping is typifi ed by short diaphragmatic bursts and long expirations with glottic closure. Initially, this incremental breathing pattern (see Sect. 4.1 ) maintains sub-glottic volume, which is probably critical in autoresuscitation (Hutchison et al. 2002 ) . In lambs, when central depression results in prolonged expiratory apnoea, glottic adductor activity persists until all muscle activity ceases (Praud and Reix 2005 ) . During mixed apnoea, obstructive upper airway closure commences before diaphragmatic activity and its associated fall in airway pressure (Idiong et al. 1998 ) and thus appears to be due to centrally altered laryngeal or pharyngeal muscle activities (Idiong et al. 1998 ; Upton et al. 1992 ) . Obstructive apnoea is due to insuffi cient pharyngeal opening pressure, which refl ects an imbalance between factors that decrease pharyngeal patency (see Sect. 4.1 ) and the central motor output that dictates a compensatory increase in muscle tone. In the preterm infant, pharyngeal collapse can occur passively with neck fl exion or actively in sleep, when pharyngeal wall muscle tone can be low (Thach and Stark 1979 ) . Expiratory laryngeal closure, triggered by a low lung volume, could play a role by reducing intrapharyngeal pressure below its critical value for patency.",

The apnoeic threshold is higher in preterm infants with apnoea (Gerhardt and Bancalari 1984 ) , making apnoea more likely with a fall in PCO 2 , e.g. with normal activity, sighing. Hypercapnia increases ventilation, but the response is depressed by accompanying hypoxia (Rigatto 1986 ) and can be accompanied by expiratory laryngeal closure (Eichenwald et al. 1993 (Rigatto 1986 ). Hypoxia can result in periodic breathing and then apnoea (Rigatto 1986 ). The responsiveness of the carotid body is depressed after birth but recovers within 2 weeks (Abu-Shaweesh and Martin 2008 ). Repeated exposure to hypoxaemia postnatally may augment the carotid body sensitivity to hypoxaemia with a resultant hyperventilation, followed by hypocarbia and decreased ventilation (Al-Matary et al. 2004 ; Nock et al. 2004 ). These cycles may produce periodic breathing and apnoea. However, prenatal exposure to cigarette smoke may diminish the response to hypoxaemia (Gauda et al. 2004 ; Schneider et al. 2008 ) , and exposure to hyperoxia at critical periods of development can inhibit carotid body development in animals (Gauda et al. 2004 ) . Diminished stimulatory responses to hypoxaemia have been found in preterm infants (Gauda et al. 2004 ). Thus, central integration of both increased and decreased carotid body inputs may promote apnoea (Gauda et al. 2004 ).",

            "text": "Vagal cardiac efferent output decreases in inspiration when airway vagal afferent input increases. Therefore, heart rate increases during inspiration, while it slows during expiration -sinus arrhythmia. The heart rate changes help maintain a constancy of cardiac output and blood pressure. Augmented ventilation in respiratory distress can produce cardiac output volume swings detected as pulsus paradoxus (Goldstein and Brazy 1990 ) . During apnoea, vagal afferent input falls and vagal cardiac efferent output increases; thus, the onset of bradycardia can be immediate. Bradycardia in older preterm infants with apnoea follows the onset of a decrease in oxygen saturation, refl ecting the importance of central integration of vagal afferent and chemoreceptor inputs (Poets 2003 Active maintenance of sub-glottic volume is noted in the newborn, whose elastic chest wall is ideal for growth and atraumatic birth. Chest wall distortion, inward movement that threatens airway volume, occurs easily and stimulates chest wall afferents that inhibit phrenic activity (intercostal-phrenic refl ex) and/or produce glottic closure. Newborn infant motor responses to vagal afferents are easily elicited (Thach 2001 ) . Lower airway slowly adapting receptors (SARs) detect within-breath volume/stretch, while rapidly adapting irritant receptors (RARs) detect distortion/defl ation. C-fi bre receptors, associated with the pulmonary vasculature, detect chemical changes. In animals, the SAR inputs stimulate the chest wall and diaphragmatic pump muscles during inspiration until peak afferent activity is reached when inspiration is inhibited. Increased vagal afferent feedback accompanies a large infl ation and triggers expiratory apnoea -the Hering-Breuer infl ation refl ex, a response modulated by airway CO 2 in animals. After a large infl ation, abdominal expiratory muscle activity is triggered -the Hering-Breuer expiration refl ex. Prevention of inspiration by airway occlusion causes a fall in upper and lower airway vagal input, prolonging inspiration. During partial vagal blockade, infl ation produces a second inspiratory effort -Head's paradoxical refl ex. Prevention of expiration by airway occlusion maintains vagal afferent input, thus prolonging expiratory time. In adult animals, when airway volume is considerably reduced, irritant receptor stimulation triggers an inspiration -the Hering-Breuer defl ation refl ex. However, irritant receptor input in preterm infants, with defl ation or with tracheal stimulation, can result in apnoea (Fleming et al. 1978 ; Hannam et al. 1998 ) . A cough response is only noted after 34 weeks postmenstrual age (Fleming et al. 1978 ) . The Hering-Breuer and Head refl exes may act to optimise lung infl ation without tissue damage during inspiration and tailor expiratory time for a given expired volume. The stretch receptors may also act to increase central neuronal activity during expiration such that inspiration begins at a higher level of expiratory vagal input and thus peaks sooner, signalling an earlier cessation of tidal inspiration and promoting respiratory rate (Al-Matary et al. 2004 ). There is support for Head's viewpoint. Infants use laryngeal and diaphragmatic means of maintaining higher absolute airway volumes and breathe faster (Sect. 4.1 ) (Thach 2001 ) . In the preterm neonate, atelectasis/defl ation post-extubation is associated with apnoea (Hannam et al. 1998 ) . A lower end-expiratory volume (EEV) is noted in REM sleep and in apnoeic infants (Poets 2003 ) . Furthermore, in lambs breathing through a tracheostomy, absence of laryngeal control of EEV is associated with apnoea (Johnson 1979 ) . Airway pressure support after birth is the mainstay for reversal of apnoea and bradycardia, the latter being used in initial stabilisation as a sign to indicate the need for airway volume support. After birth, the intensivist employs the 'open lung (airway) approach' during artifi cial ventilation. Failure to maintain sub-glottic airway volume when the preterm infant is on a ventilator results in desaturation/bradycardia (Bolivar et al. 1995 ) . This stresses that, when handling the endotracheal tube and/or moving the preterm infant's thorax, the maintenance of sub-glottic airway volume is important.",

This response to SLN input decreases with advancing age but can be rekindled by a concurrent central depression or an upper airway infection (Daly 1997 ) .

The severity of apnoea is defi ned by its duration, the degrees of associated oxygen desaturation and bradycardia, and the type of therapeutic intervention provided, from minimal stimulation to total respiratory support. The assessment of the apnoeic patient consists of the nose-to-diaphragm then the head-to-toe approach. Apnoea of prematurity is differentiated from periodic breathing, a repetitive series of pauses in breathing separated by a crescendodecrescendo pattern of breaths. Periodic breathing in normal preterm infants is considered benign, but it can be associated with hypocarbia, hypoxia and CNS hypoxia/ischaemia and with a fall in sub-glottic airway volume (Khan et al. 2005 ; Rigatto 1986 ). Conditions resulting in apnoea, including structural lesions (Brazy et al. 1987 ) , are considered before a diagnosis of idiopathic apnoea is made (Fig. 47.9 ). Upper airway contact with food or with gastric contents can result in apnoea, but episodes of gastroesophageal refl ux do not appear to be temporally linked to apnoea. In animals, prior upper airway exposure to acid can alter the response to subsequent mechanical loads (Sant'Ambrogio et al. 1998 ). Thus, the clinical impression that the two are related may be indirect. Pre-existing anaemia exacerbates the apnoeic response to SLN stimulation in animals and is important in postoperative apnoea (Cote et al. 1995 ) . However, blood transfusion therapy for apnoea of prematurity is debated.",

Conditions that can enhance apnoea are avoided. Hyperoxia can diminish recovery from SLN stimulation in lambs and, with altered carotid chemosensitivity, will increase apnoea (Al-Matary et al. 2004 ). Careful attention is paid to nasal patency (secretions, proper prong size and attachment of nasal continuous airway positive pressure [NCPAP] device), environmental temperature, correct neck posture (neck fl exion) and abdominal distention (air in the stomach, correct positioning of gastric tube, a tight diaper forcing abdominal contents into the chest). Apnoea and bradycardia or bradycardia alone during feeding is usually a benign condition that responds to cessation of the suck/swallow stimulus. Input or \"error\" neural afferents Fig. 47 .7 Afferent interactions and the motor response hierarchy. This diagram illustrates how factors infl uencing motor pattern may interact. Sudden decreases in any excitatory input can alter the balance affecting the outputs to the heart, airway smooth muscle and laryngeal and diaphragmatic muscles producing a more protective pattern ( right side of diagram). The motor response determining expiratory glottic closure is seen as being determined primarily by the central drive/status, amplifi ed secondly by decreased or error signals in neural afferent inputs and amplifi ed thirdly by input from carotid body stimulation. Thus, increased carotid body stimulation can amplify an existing pattern. By contrast, a sudden decrease in carotid body input can trigger a switch to a protective pattern. This provides a possible explanation for the proposed roles of both increased and decreased carotid body inputs in the genesis of apnoea with glottic closure. CNS central nervous system, CSN carotid sinus nerve, HR heart rate, Airway SM airway smooth muscle, PCA E expiratory posterior cricoarytenoid, TA E expiratory thyroarytenoid of prematurity is refl ected in the main forms of therapy, namely, peripheral tactile stimulation, xanthine therapy and respiratory airway support (Table 47 .2 ). Xanthine therapy primarily enhances central drive and treats central apnoea (Table 47. 3 ), while NCPAP therapy maintains airway stability and thus prevents mixed apnoea (Miller and Martin 2004 ) . However, caffeine therapy enhances breathing peripherally by improving diaphragmatic function, while NCPAP therapy enhances central drive by increasing airway vagal feedback and decreasing oxygen saturation variability that may stabilise carotid body feedback.",

            "text": "Despite appearing as a 'simple' therapy, NCPAP requires care in its application and excellent bedside monitoring and nursing (Hutchison and Bignall 2008 ) . Laboratory and clinical studies strongly support the use of a modern NCPAP device (Hutchison and Pantalitschka et al. 2009 ). Weaning from NCPAP is little studied. In general, when an infant is receiving <30 % supplementary oxygen, a switch to high-fl ow nasal cannulae can be made. The advantage of nasal cannulae lies in their ease of use. The disadvantages are that the airway pressure they generate is not monitored and there may be increased infectious risks. Severe apnoea can warrant invasive mechanical ventilation but involves the complications of 'endotrauma' (Hutchison and Bignall 2008 ) . There is interest in non-invasive positive pressure ventilation (NIPPV) for apnoea, and larger trials are awaited (Hutchison and Bignall 2008 ; Pantalitschka et al. 2009 ). Since coordination between the upper airway and pump muscles is critical, NIPPV is applied synchronously with the central outputs to the breathing muscles (Jounieaux et al. 1995 ) ; this may be diffi cult during sleep. Caffeine therapy with a loading dose of 20 mg/ kg followed by 5-6 mg/kg/day produces therapeutic serum concentrations (8-20 mcg/L) independent of the patients' gestational age between 24 and 35 weeks and of their renal and liver functions over wide ranges (Leon et al. 2007 ). Thus, monitoring of serum caffeine concentrations is unnecessary if the recommended dosing is used. Tachycardia with caffeine can result from a pharmacodynamic effect. It resolves with cessation of therapy despite a normal serum concentration. Slightly higher and signifi cantly higher caffeine dosing regimens have been used. The latter regimen increased successful weaning from a ventilator (Steer et al. 2003 ) . Concerns about the extensive use of caffeine relate to its action as an antagonism of adenosine, a body-wide mediator of vasodilatation, which is involved in neurodevelopment. However, a controlled trial of early postnatal administration (<10 days) of caffeine versus placebo found that those receiving caffeine in recommended doses had less bronchopulmonary dysplasia (by 10 %) and improved cognitive outcome (by 5 %) (Schmidt et al. 2007 ; Schmidt et al. 2006b ). Adenosine blockade may still be problematic. Caffeine therapy has been linked to necrotising enterocolitis, albeit weakly. Preterm infants are susceptible to white matter injury and thus at increased risk when cerebral blood fl ow is low (Darnall et al. 2006 ) . If an infant on caffeine therapy develops hypocarbia during ventilatory support, any hypocarbia-associated decrease in cerebral perfusion may be aggravated.",

They seem to do the most unreasonable things with their respiration . . .-Kenneth Cross, 1954    47.3.1.2.1 Defi nition and Types of ApnoeaApnoea of prematurity is associated with physiological characteristics and pathological conditions found in the preterm infant born at <37 completed postmenstrual weeks. Its incidence is inversely related to gestational age(Henderson- Smart 1981 ). Brief cessations of airfl ow lasting a few seconds are common in sleep and may represent a transient return to fetal life. Apnoea demanding attention and meriting the clinical diagnosis of apnoea of prematurity is that lasting 15-20 s or that accompanied by bradycardia, cyanosis or pallor. Apnoea is categorised intoCNS controller status Integration / Pattern generation / Coordination pattern formation / Motor outputs Fig. 47.5 Breathing control. This diagram of the central control of breathing shows its functions both in enabling ventilation with gas exchange and the simultaneous maintenance of airway patency and respiratory system homoeostasis. The central generation and formation of motor breathing patterns involve integration of all sensory inputs in a hierarchical manner different types. Central apnoea (incidence ~10-25 %) is a lack of tidal airfl ow accompanied by a lack of pump muscle activity (with or without an open glottis). Obstructive apnoea (~10-20 %)is an absence of tidal airfl ow accompanied by upper airway obstruction, which can commence in expiration and continue despite pump muscle activity and in the subsequent neural expiration. Mixed apnoea (~50-75 %) is both central and obstructive apnoeas occurring serially, usually in that order. Bradycardia (heart rate <100/min) usually follows the onset of apnoea of prematurity. Oxygen saturation values fall (<85 %) and can produce cyanosis. An associated pallor can indicate the occurrence of a dive refl ex response with preferential blood fl ow to the heart, brain and adrenals but diminished blood fl ow to other important organs, e.g. the gut. The newborn brain is more tolerant than the adult to hypoxia, but if apnoea is ongoing, death results.",

This diagram shows the spectrum of breathing patterns used in daily life including coordination with complex acts such as swallowing and coughing. A centrally controlled pattern switch can rapidly alter the breathing patterns from ones typifi ed in expiration by a more open glottis to ones characterised by a more closed glottis. This occurs transiently in airway volume maintenance, airway protection and speech and is determined by central drive/status and afferent inputs. Expiratory laryngeal closure increases as central drive decreases. It is postulated that in mixed apnoea a switch from central apnoea to obstructive apnoea accompanies a progressive decrease in central drive and that this may be enhanced by a decrease in airway volume during central apnoea with an open glottis Martin 2008 ).
