In this study investigate an adaptation of the model. Since several restricting measures have been imposed by the Italian government at different times, starting from March 8th 2020, we propose a modification of SEIRD by introducing a time dependent transmitting rate. In the numerical results we report the maximum infection spread for the three Italian regions firstly affected by the COVID-19 outbreak(Lombardia, Veneto and Emilia Romagna). This approach will be successively extended to other Italian regions, as soon as more data will be available.",

The SIR model and its later modifications, such as Susceptible-Exposed-Infected-Removed (SEIR) [2] are commonly used by the epidemic medical community in the study of outbreaks diffusion.In these models, the population is divided into groups. For example, the SIR model groups are: Susceptible who can catch the disease, Infected who have the disease and can spread it, and Removed those who have either had the disease, or are recovered, immune or isolated until recovery. The SEIR model proposed by Chowell et al. [3] considers also the Exposed group:",

Some examples about the Chinese outbreak can be found in [5, 4, 6] . Concerning the Italian situation, which is currently evolving, it is possible to model the introduction of restricting measures by introducing a non constant infection rate [7] . In this paper we propose to represent the infection rate as a piecewise function, which reflects the changes of external conditions. The parameter R0, which is proportional to the infection rate, becomes a time dependent parameter R t which follows a different trend each time the external conditions change, depending on the particular situation occurring in that period. For example, if new restrictions are applied to the population movements at time t 1 , we can hopefully argue that R t starts to decrease when t > t 1 .",

This study considers Lombardia, Veneto and Emilia Romagna regions for which the largest amount of meaningful data have been collected in the GitHub repository[8].The purpose is to develop a model calibration and simulation method to be eventually extended to all the other Italian regions reached by the epidemic spread. All computations are performed using Matlab R2019b 2,9 GHz Intel Core i7 quad-core 16 GB ram. The method consist of two main steps:\u2022 Identification. In this step the model parameters are estimated by means of the trust-region-reflective algorithm implemented in the lsqnonlin matlab function.\u2022 Simulation. This step applies the SEIRD-SEIRD(rm) models with the identified parameters in order to monitor the process for a longer time (up to 240 days). The differential system is solved applying the ode45 matlab function with the following initial condition: S(0) = N ,E(0) = I(0) = I init ,R(0) = D(0) = 0 where the value I init corresponds to the Infected individuals in the first measurement day.",
