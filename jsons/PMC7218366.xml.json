Contact with respiratory secretions from virus-infected individuals is currently known to be the main route of transmission, although there are reports of virus transmission via aerosol droplets and physical contact [5]. However, it is not known whether the novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) can also be transmitted by blood transfusion. Patients with haematologic diseases such as aplastic anaemia may require frequent blood transfusions; as such, it is critical to ensure that all donations are from clearly healthy people as few people are ready to donate blood currently. Notwithstanding the urgent requirement of blood, it is critical to know whether the SARS-CoV-2 virus can be transmitted by blood transfusion because many individuals may be asymptomatic carriers and may donate blood. Although SARS-CoV-2 RNA has been detected in serum or plasma from infected patients, there are no data or cases suggesting the risk of transmission of SARS-CoV-2 via blood transfusion [6].",

His bone marrow was pan-cytopenic at presentation (10% of normal); his condition did not improve in response to immunosuppressive therapy with anti-thymocyte globulin and cyclosporin. He underwent multiple transfusions in preparation for an allogeneic haematopoietic stem cell transplantation. In February 2020, he presented at an outpatient clinic with petechiae and epistaxis. He was admitted to the haematology department for platelet transfusion and supportive care. At the time of admission, his vital signs were stable and he had no fever; his general condition was good, and he presented with no evidence of infection and was classified as having an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status of 1. His initial complete blood count included a WBC count of 270/mm3 (absolute neutrophil count, 30/mm3), Hb of 8.1 g/dl and a platelet count of 7,000/mm3. Immediately upon admission, he was transfused with apheresis platelets from a presumably healthy donor.",

The platelet recipient was tested for SARS-CoV-2 using real-time reverse transcription (RT)-PCR; the result was negative. The patient did not show any symptoms of infection, and there was no evidence of pneumonia on chest computed tomography. Three more tests for SARS-CoV-2 were performed; all of the results were negative (Fig. 1\n).

Meanwhile, the European Center for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) suggests a precautionary deferral from donation of blood for 21 days after any possible exposure to confirmed patients [9].
