These derangements result from intestinal inflammation and mucosal barrier disruption, leading to fluid, electrolyte, and protein loss as well as endotoxin and bacterial translocation into the blood stream. Neutropenia reflects neutrophil margination and sequestration in the intestinal tract, with left shift and toxic changes commonly observed. Strong ion acidosis characterized by hyponatremia and hyperlactatemia also is common, although a hypoproteinemic alkalosis occasionally may occur.1 Hemoconcentration and plasma volume contraction occurs secondarily to fluid sequestration and loss via the intestines. Lower than expected total protein (especially albumin) concentration, considering the relative erythrocytosis and estimated degree of dehydration, occurs frequently in horses with acute colitis and indicates protein loss from the diseased bowel. Hypocalcemia often is observed in horses with hypoalbuminemia and reflects the high proportion of protein-bound calcium in circulation. Ionized (unbound) calcium, which better reflects physiologic calcium homeostasis, usually is normal. Clinicopathologic derangements can vary in severity between cases, depending on the degree of intestinal damage and, in 1 study, severity of electrolyte loss, hemoconcentration, and prerenal azotemia all were predictors of survival.2\n",

This diagnostic test can be particularly helpful in identifying strangulating lesions early in the course of disease (hours), during which horses may display signs of severe abdominal pain but still have normal hematologic and biochemical profiles.",

            "text": "It has been suggested that hyperlactatemia in horses should be categorized by the physiologic mechanism of excessive lactate production as a means to potentially increase its utility as a diagnostic and prognostic test.9 Type A hyperlactatemia occurs in response to inadequate tissue perfusion and oxygenation and is observed in horses with dehydration, hypovolemia, and hypoxemia. Type B hyperlactatemia is produced by inflamed and/or ischemic tissues and is observed in horses with inflammatory or strangulating intestinal lesions. Although type A hyperlactatemia generally responds rapidly to restoration of tissue perfusion (often through volume replacement and fluid therapy), type B hyperlactatemia persists until the underlying inflammatory or ischemic condition is corrected. Many horses with inflammatory or ischemic intestinal lesions also are dehydrated and volume-contracted, and increased lactate concentrations in these patients likely represented simultaneous type A and type B hyperlactatemia. Applied clinically, these concepts support serial measurement of blood lactate as a means to identify the source of hyperlactatemia and provide useful information regarding severity and prognosis for survival. This was corroborated by a prospective observational study of horses presenting for gastrointestinal disease, in which a rapid reduction in blood lactate concentration in response to correction of dehydration and restoration of perfusion (type A) was associated with increased survival, whereas persistently increased blood lactate or lactate concentrations that increased in the face of supportive therapy (type B) were associated with more severe intestinal lesions and poorer survival outcomes.9 This also is true for peritoneal fluid, in which lactate concentrations that remain increased in the face of medical therapy is suggestive of a strangulating or severely inflamed lesion in horses presented for colic.10\n",

The severity of hypoproteinemia and hypoalbuminemia may be of prognostic value and was found positively correlated with nonsurvival in a retrospective study examining horses with weight loss despite good appetite.23 RDC, a complication of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) treatment, is associated with particularly marked protein loss, often resulting in plasma protein concentrations less than 5.0 g/dL and albumin concentrations less than 1.5 g/dL. Although any NSAID is thought to be capable of causing RDC, phenylbutazone, a nonselective cyclooxygenase inhibitor, frequently is implicated. Prolonged administration of phenylbutazone, at 8.8 mg/kg, orally every 24 hours, to 12 healthy adult horses resulted in consistent hypoalbuminemia in 1 clinical trial. Neutropenia also was observed (likely due to marginalization and sequestration in inflamed sections of bowel), and 2 horses developed clinical colitis.24 The combination of phenylbutazone and flunixin increased the risk for ulcerative damage to the intestinal tract and created severe gastric ulceration and fatal colitis in 1 prospective study.25 Serial monitoring of albumin concentrations is advisable in horses receiving NSAID administration and a diagnosis of RDC should be strongly considered in horses that develop hypoproteinemia and hypoalbuminemia during treatment. This diagnosis is supported further by observing localized right dorsal colon wall thickening on transabdominal ultrasound (Fig. 1\n).",

Increased hepatic enzyme activity often is a result of secondary liver disease from toxemia, hypoxia, and so forth, and hepatic function remains normal in most horses with these disorders. Primary liver disease most commonly occurs from toxic, infectious, or metabolic causes and may progress to loss of function and clinical signs of hepatic failure. Liver (hepatobiliary) failure occurs when this system has lost some or all of its functionality. Failure generally occurs when greater than 70% of hepatic function is lost and this can be determined by clinical evidence (eg, jaundice, photosensitization, and central nervous system signs) of liver failure, along with abnormal liver function tests, such as bile acids, ammonia, and so forth. It is critical to remember that liver enzyme activities are not indicators of hepatic function! Interpretation of biochemical results is always best made in combination with anamnesis and a thorough clinical examination. Clinical examination, biochemical test results, ultrasonographic findings, and, if indicated, liver biopsy are best used in combination to determine the importance of the liver disease, possible causes, proper treatments, and prognosis.",

From a clinical perspective, biochemical results can be helpful in narrowing the differential diagnoses for liver analyte changes and, when evaluated over time, help predict prognosis. Biochemical enzyme testing, especially GGT activity, also can be used to identify subclinical hepatotoxin exposure, such as during outbreaks of pyrrolizidine alkaloid toxicity.29 Enzyme testing can be useful in determining treatment duration, for example, serial GGT measurements to determine duration of antimicrobial treatment of bacterial cholangiohepatitis. Equine liver-specific enzymes include sorbitol dehydrogenase (SDH), glutamate dehydrogenase (GLDH), and GGT, which reflect hepatocellular injury (SDH and GLDH) and cholestasis, biliary necrosis, or hyperplasia (GGT), respectively. AST, lactic dehydrogenase (LDH), and ALP also reflect hepatocellular (AST and LDH) and biliary (ALP) disease, but these enzymes are not liver-specific28\n,\n30\n,\n31 (Table 1\n). Increased activities of SDH, GLDH, and AST occur with even mild acute hepatocellular injury, and the magnitude of the enzyme increase may not correspond to the functional status of the liver. SDH is released from the cytosol of the hepatocyte and has a short half-life (approximately 12 hours). Thus, repeated SDH measurements can be helpful in determining resolution or progression of acute hepatocellular disease.28 The clinical use of SDH measurements for detection of liver disease is affected by its instability in shipped or nonfrozen stored samples. Samples that are refrigerated may be relatively stable for up to 24 hours.32 GLDH is located in the mitochondria of hepatocytes, and activities are abnormally high in many horses with acute hepatocellular disease. The calculated sensitivities of increased GLDH activity for the detection of hepatic necrosis and of hepatic lipidosis were 78% and 86%, respectively, in 1 study.31 GLDH is more stable and has a slightly longer half-life than SDH (see Table 1). The improved stability of GLDH makes it a recommended test for detecting acute hepatocellular disease when sample shipping is required. Horses with severe chronic fibrosis (cirrhosis) occasionally may have SDH and GLDH activities within normal reference intervals.",

Rarely, a horse without liver disease has a positive bilirubin reading on the urine test strip. Increased unconjugated bilirubin concentration is a moderately sensitive test for liver failure but lacks specificity because increases also may occur with anorexia and hemolysis or, on rare occasions, may be seen in a healthy horse.31 The latter condition may be caused by a congenital deficiency in glucuronyl transferase, and affected horses can maintain total bilirubin concentrations of 9 mg/dL or greater.45\n",

The marked decrease in total protein and albumin concentrations between days 1 and 3 also is common in horses with colitis due to ongoing protein-losing enteropathy.

Other unmeasured anions, such as d-lactate or acids accumulating from the severe prerenal azotemia, also may have been present to help explain both the strong ion difference and the metabolic acidosis.\u2022Hyperlactemia often is present in horses with acute severe colitis as a result of hypovolemia and endotoxin/cytokine effects on global tissue perfusion (type A) with additional lactate production from the local damage to the bowel wall (type B).

The increased AST activity was a result of both muscle and liver disease.\u25cbThe marked increase in SDH (>30 times the upper reference limit) and milder increase in GGT (slightly >3 times the upper reference limit) with 11% of the total bilirubin being direct bilirubin suggest that hepatocellular injury is more severe than cholestasis.\u25cbThe normal SDH activity on day 5 reflects both the rapid improvement in the disease and the short half-life of SDH.

The greater decrease in CK activity during 5 days of hospitalization is due to the shorter half-life (hours) compared with AST (days).\u2022Negative energy balance with hypertriglyceridemia: miniature horses are at increased risk for developing hypertriglyceridemia, hyperlipemia, and hepatic lipidosis in response to anorexia. The increase in circulating lipids reflects increased mobilization of fat stores as well as decreased clearance/metabolism of lipids by the liver.

Dehydration is further supported by the USG of 1.025. Venous pH and creatinine and lactate concentrations all normalized rapidly in response to intravenous crystalloid fluid therapy.\n",
