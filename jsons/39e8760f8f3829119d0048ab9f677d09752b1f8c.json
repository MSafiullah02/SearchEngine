            "text": "The coronavirus disease 2019 has resulted in a global pandemic of acute respiratory illness. [1] [2] [3] As of April 27, 2020, there were 2,954,222 COVID-19 confirmed cases and 202,597 deaths reported worldwide. 3 In the United States (US) alone, COVID-19 has spread to all 55 jurisdictions with 957,875 total confirmed cases, 128,673 hospitalizations, and 56,386 deaths. 4,5 As COVID-19 continues to spread and case numbers rise, health systems have strained to keep pace with demands for hospital and critical care services, challenging hospitals to provide high-quality patient care while managing potentially scarce resources. 6 Given these concerns, it is imperative that healthcare systems are able to predict increased utilization and proactively plan effective resource allocation, including when and how much to expand access to hospital beds, intensive care unit (ICU) beds, and ventilators. 7, 8 Many studies have reported on the basic susceptible-infected-recovered (SIR) model to forecast how potential COVID-19 cases might impact the capacity of healthcare systems. [9] [10] [11] [12] [13] [14] [15] [16] [17] [18] [19] However, these studies have several limitations: models using national and international infection projections to provide insights for other countries, states, or regions do not: (a) take into consideration variation in transmission and infection rates based on local population characteristics and spatial differences; (b) apply control measures for the type and timing of medical and behavioral interventions including social distancing, border control, and stay at home policies; (c) account for local community resource availability; or (d) adjust for the ability of regional hospital systems to transfer resources between facilities and repurpose spaces for COVID use. Additionally, despite their widespread application in the COVID-19 pandemic, basic SIR models were not developed to forecast hospitalizations, resulting in uncertainty about their accuracy. 19 In response to the need for actionable data insights, investigators from the Center for Outcomes Research and Evaluation (CORE) at Atrium Health in Charlotte, North Carolina developed a web-based application, or 'app', that embeds COVID-19 forecasting models, developed using local data, to guide the health system's proactive pandemic response. The COVID-19 Utilization and Resource Visualization Engine (CURVE) app helps system leaders have access to the forecast predictions and observed utilization, alongside existing and surge capacity. Here we present our decision support app as an example for other healthcare systems as COVID-19 pandemic planning efforts are likely to continue for the foreseeable future.",

The D2 aspect of the model accounts for the stay-athome intervention implemented in North Carolina and imperfect detection of COVID-19 cases to estimate latent prevalence. The SIR-D2 model was fit to prevalence data from the greater Charlotte region, representing the health system's primary Charlotte market area. The model is more fully detailed by Turk et al. 20 Determining hospitalization rate In order to forecast hospital resource demand, we needed to first determine rates of hospitalization. The hospital rate p is the rate per person per day at which COVID-19 positive persons transition from an infected state to an implied hospitalized state. We conjecture the hospitalized state mediates the transition from the infected to the removed state in an SIR-D2 model. If we assume an average illness duration of 14 days, 21 then by a simple binomial argument, we can solve for the proportion of cases requiring hospitalization. Conversely, for a given proportion of cases requiring hospitalization specified in the app, again assuming an average illness duration of 14 days, we solve for the rate. This rate is then multiplied by the prevalence of COVID-19 positive people at time t, to give us the incidence of hospitalization at time t. The equation to calculate the hospital rate p is as follows:",

The CURVE app provides information based upon local infectious patterns and allows for frequent updates as new forecast or health system data becomes available. By predicting utilization in the context of up-to-date local resources, such as hospital beds, ICU beds, and number of ventilators, it also provides a critical monitoring function (e.g. alignment of model predicting and observed bed statistics). Furthermore, health system leaders can adjust variables in the CURVE app to further explore different scenarios. Because this pandemic trajectory is expected to be highly depending on public policy and community behaviors, we present best-, moderate-, and worstcase scenarios, so that leaders can compare side-by-side the range of possible impacts on hospital plans. The reality of this variability can be seen as the observed hospitalizations for COVID-19 positive patients significantly flattened after April 6, 2020, and the trajectory of hospital census shifted from the moderate-to best-case scenario according to Table 3, Table 4 , and Figure 4 . In some cases, the user will have no idea as to a plausible value for the hospitalization proportion. One approach to determine a reasonable value is to plot the actual hospital census counts versus the date and modulate the hospital proportion until the predicted hospital census curve is parallel to the trend in the actual counts. Then add an offset to the predictions so that the curve provides a good fit to the actual counts. An offset that minimizes the RMSE is the difference between mean actual counts and the mean predictions. For a more refined approach, it is simple to write a routine in R that iterates through a sequence of possible hospitalization proportions, their corresponding offsets, and then select the hospital proportion that gives the smallest RMSE.

A more nuanced approach as the pandemic progresses would not assume one overall hospital proportion and use local linear trends. Importantly, the pandemic behavior has evolved such that deterministic models or models not built to be responsive to local data will have poor fit with observed hospitalizations. Beyond providing a userfriendly and adaptable platform for hospital resource forecasting, the CURVE app also addresses a critical gap for health systems to have locally relevant, updated information. Other models and apps provided guidance to predict surge timing and health system demand requirements due to COVID-19; however, these are mostly built on national-and state-level data, are not updated frequently, and do not have actual trends of health system data that most accurately reflect local reality. 6, 8, 19 Our CURVE app addresses these shortcomings by relying upon modeling built on local data that is updated three times a week based upon observed infection and utilization rates. It is likely that more advanced models (e.g. Seasonal Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average (SARIMA), or Bayesian generalized additive model) will be required as the pandemic behavior continues to evolve. The CURVE app allows for these more advanced models to easily be consumed and available to leaders.",

This local response to social distancing, while immediately apparent in the CURVE app, would not be available to health system leaders relying on models that are neither built on local data nor with frequent recalibration to local trends. Whereas, in the CURVE app, leaders are able to immediately gain these 'on the ground,' local insights -indeed, in this case, that means shifting from a tracking on the moderate-to the best-case scenario.",

While healthcare utilization for non-COVID-19 illness declined early in the pandemic due to canceling of all in-person elective care, 25 this demand is also expected to surge back over time and increasingly become a contributor to overall health system resource consumption. [26] [27] [28] There are some limitations and scope conditions that should be noted. First, although the CURVE app was developed for healthcare systems to insert local data using either csv files or through direct connection to their enterprise data warehouse, users still require R and R Shiny proficiency to modify or to add more tables, charts, or graphs. Second, in order to provide reliable, locally relevant forecasts, users must have access to local data and modeling expertise with frequent recalibration of the model to local context. If such changes are not monitored and accounted for, projections could be taken out of context, leading to erroneous conclusions.",
