In order to aid in prognosis, several prediction models have been developed using various methods and tools including machine learning.

[8] Typically, in machine learning several algorithms are tested on data and performance metrics are used to select the best performing algorithm. We tested five commonly used supervised machine learning algorithms in healthcare research (logistic regression, support vector machine, K neighbor classification, random forest and gradient boosting) to compare algorithm performance efficiency. Logistic regression is best suited for a binary or categorical output. It tries to describe the relationship between the output and predictor variables. [9] In support vector machine (SVM) algorithm, the data is classified into two classes based on the output variable over a hyperplane. [9] The algorithm tries to increase the distance between the hyperplane and the most proximal two data points in each class. K Nearest Neighbors (KNN) is a non-parametric approach that decides the output classification by the majority class among its neighbors. [10] The number of neighbors can be altered to arrive at the best fitting KNN model. For our model, we selected 20 nearest .

The final prediction came out of the cross-validated estimate. As our data was imbalanced (only 2% output were with the condition against 98% without), we applied an oversampling technique called synthetic minority oversampling technique (SMOTE) to enhance the learning on the test data. [13, 14] The performance of the algorithms were evaluated for discrimination, calibration and overall performance. Discrimination is the abillity of the algorithm to separate out patients with the mortality risk from those without, where as calibration is the agreement between observed and predicted risk of mortality. An ideal model should have the best of both discrimination and calibration. We tested discriminaiton with area under the receiver operating characteristics curve (AUC) and calibration with accuracy and Matthews correlation coefficient.

Accuracy is a measure of correct classification of death cases as death and survived cases as survived. [15] Matthews correlation coefficient (MCC) is a measure that takes into account all four predictive classestrue positive, true negative, false positive and false negative. [16] It is considered a better measure than accuracy for unbalanced data. Brier score simultaneously account for discrimnation and calibration. [15] A smaller Brier score indicates better performance. In addition, the gradient boosting algorithm was used to estimate the relative contributions of the predictors and draw the variable importance plot. [17] The statistical analyses were performed using Stata Version 15 (StataCorp LLC. College Station, TX), Python programming language Version 3.7 (Python Software Foundation, Wilmington, DE, USA) and R programming language Version 3.6.3 (R Foundation for Statistical Computing, Vienna, Austria).
