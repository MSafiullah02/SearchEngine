It would be desirable for manufacturers of US equipment, transducer covers, US gel and cleaning/disinfection consumables/equipment to collaborate further with US practitioners and patient representatives to improve standards. Additional research studies on the susceptibility of pathogens to practicable, low/non-toxic and affordable disinfection measures are needed, and how these can be best applied in the context of US.",
