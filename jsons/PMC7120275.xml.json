Most hotels have a high quality of the building and hygienic standard. They have single and double rooms, most of them with separate bathrooms and toilets, which is of the utmost importance as it facilitates isolation and care. They also have laundry facilities and kitchens, and most have wings that can be shut down. These are qualities that are approaching the requirements of an isolation department.
