We speculate that this difference is likely because of the higher number of antibiotics given to the allogeneic HSCT population. In our study, we found that antibiotics with anaerobic coverage was associated with a decrease in relative gut abundance of BPG bacteria from post\u2010transplant week 1 to post\u2010transplant week 4. Kidney transplant recipients usually receive a preoperative antibiotic for surgical prophylaxis and a Pneumocystis jiroveci prophylaxis, but do not routinely receive broad\u2010spectrum antibiotics with anaerobic coverage so differences in antibiotic regimens may explain the dichotomy in the relative gut abundance of BPG bacteria between the two populations. We also found that gender and steroid maintenance therapy were associated with a lower relative gut abundance of BPG bacteria, which could have also contributed to the dichotomy. With respect to gender, little is known about the differences in the relative gut abundance of BPG between men and women. A recent study by Gao et al noted differences in the gut microbiota in obese individuals stratified by gender12 so it is possible that gender may contribute to the differences in relative gut abundances of BPG bacteria, which may have implications for immune system modulation beyond viral infections.",

While our limited data suggest the stability of the relative gut abundance of BPG bacteria in subjects who did not receive antibiotics, the relative gut abundance of BPG bacteria may have changed over the course of time in the setting of antibiotic usage, which we did not account for in our survival curve analyses. In addition, we used the cutoff of 1% relative gut abundance of BPG bacteria, which was utilized in the allogeneic HSCT recipient population.5 Notably, there was a significance difference in the proportion of HSCT recipients and in the proportion of kidney transplant recipients with less than 1% relative gut abundance of BPG bacteria and whether this cutoff is also relevant for the kidney transplant population is unknown. In order to address this concern, we evaluated both a bottom quartile cutoff as well as a median cutoff and we did find an association between high relative gut abundance of BPG bacteria and decreased risk for respiratory viral infections using the bottom quartile cutoff. Another limitation is that respiratory viral panels were performed by clinicians on a for\u2010cause indication basis unlike BK virus and CMV virus screening which was performed routinely per protocol. Not all subjects with respiratory viral symptoms were screened using the respiratory viral panels, which may have influenced our results. Furthermore, subjects may have asymptomatic long term respiratory viral infections prior to transplantation and whether our detection was the result of a new infection or asymptomatic colonization is not known. We also note that our study evaluated upper respiratory viral infections while the Haak et al study assessed lower respiratory viral infections, so whether our data applies to lower respiratory viral infections in the kidney transplant population is unknown. Given the limited number of outcomes, we did not perform multivariable analyses so it is possible that other factors may have confounded the results.",

We find that antibiotics with anaerobic coverage are associated with a decrease in the relative gut abundance of BPG bacteria and we also report an association between the relative gut abundance of BPG bacteria and the risk for development of respiratory viral infections in kidney transplant recipients. Our results are preliminary in nature and require replication in a larger cohort of kidney transplant recipients. In particular, we did report a trend toward significance of the association between the relative gut abundance of BPG bacteria and CMV viremia, which would need further validation for the CMV viremia finding as well as for CMV disease. Our study examined the relative gut abundance of BPG bacteria, but future studies examining the absolute gut abundance of BPG bacteria and/or fecal butyrate concentrations may provide more insight into the relationship between BPG bacteria and development of viral complications. Nevertheless, if our findings are confirmed, our data support therapeutic options in the form of modulating the gut microbiota for decreasing viral infection rates.",

A point in blue represents an individual fecal specimen from the 231 specimens from the 78 patients in the No Abx Group and a point in magenta represents an individual fecal specimen from the 279 specimens from the 90 patients in the Abx Group. The line represents a LOESS curve with 95% confidence intervals indicated by the shaded bands. Panel C. Box and whisker plot with the relative gut abundance of BPG bacteria on the y\u2010axis and the fecal specimen post\u2010transplant week on the x\u2010axis for the 54 subjects in the Paired No Abx Group. In each box and whisker plot, the line represents the median, the edges of the box plot 25% and 75%, the whiskers 1.5 times the median, and points represent outliers. The P value was calculated using the Wilcoxon signed\u2010rank test. Panel D. Box and whisker plot with the relative gut abundance of BPG bacteria on the y\u2010axis and the fecal specimen post\u2010transplant week on the x\u2010axis for the 22 subjects in the Paired Abx Group. In each box and whisker plot, the line represents the median, the edges of the box plot 25% and 75%, the whiskers 1.5 times the median, and points represent outliers. The P value was calculated using the Wilcoxon signed\u2010rank test. Panel E. Box and whisker plot with the relative gut abundance of BPG bacteria on the y\u2010axis and the fecal specimen post\u2010transplant week on the x\u2010axis for the 6 subjects in the Paired Abx Group who received antibiotics with anaerobic coverage. In each box and whisker plot, the line represents the median, the edges of the box plot 25% and 75%, the whiskers 1.5 times the median, and points represent outliers. The P value was calculated using the Wilcoxon signed\u2010rank test",
