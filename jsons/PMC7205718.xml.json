The whole-genome sequence of 2019-nCoV was first released on January 10, 2020 [4]. 2019-nCoV has a wide range of infection to mammals, including humans. This characteristic of transmission leads to the possibility of transmission from animals to people. The 2019-nCoV, known as severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is highly transmittable and could lead to mild to severe respiratory tract infections [5]. The spread of 2019-nCoV has drawn great attentions and concerns worldwide, since 2003 humans have faced two coronavirus-related crises [6]. Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) broke out in 2003 and the Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus (MERS-CoV) emerged in the Arabian Peninsula in 2012 with a fatality rate of 35% [7].",

The main protease (3CL protease) is a key enzyme in the processing of polyproteins pp1a and pp1ab. ORF1a and ORF1ab are cleaved by papain-like protease (PLpro, nsp3) and 3C-like protease (3CLpro, nsp5) to produce the nsp [10]. Due to the important function of SARS-CoV 3CL protease, it is considered as an active target for the antiviral drug. Many 3CL protease inhibitors have been reported over the past decade [11] and a variety of inhibitors were found through screening and structure-based design [12]. PLpro is an indispensable enzyme in the virus replication and infection of the host, and also has been an important target for coronavirus inhibitors.",

The spike plays a crucial role during the virus\u2019 entry to the host cells [14]. S protein, a type I glycoprotein, on the surface of the virus, can assist virus to bind to host acceptor, which has attracted great attention because of its function in receptor binding. The receptor binding domain (RBD) of spike protein is in charge of the binding to host. 72% of the amino acid sequences in the RBDs from SARA-CoV and 2019 nCoV are identical. However, as to 2019-nCoV, the rigid prolyl residues is replaced with a distinct loop with flexible glycyl residues [15]. A unique phenylalanine F486 in the loop can penetrate into a the hydrophobic pocket of (ACE2) [16], may play the key role in acceptor recognition. Nsp12 is a viral RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp), together with co-factors nsp7 and nsp8 possessing high polymerase activity. Four functional proteins in 2019-nCoV: main protease (3CLpro), RdRp, PLpro, and spike were all studied as the targets of potential drugs. Up to now, there is no approved special antiviral drug available to be used against COVID-19. The fastest way to find drugs anti-2019-nCoV is to screen drugs which were commonly used in clinic.",

Chloroquine was found to be efficient on SARS-CoV-2 [18,19]. The mechanism of chloroquine is inhibiting quinone reductase 2, a structural similarity of UDP-N-acetylglucosamine 2-epimerases which is involved in the biosynthesis of sialic acids. The possible interference of chloroquine with sialic acid biosynthesis could account for the broad antiviral spectrum [19]. Chloroquine can also impair early stage of virus replication by interfering with the pH-dependent endosome-mediated viral entry of enveloped viruses as well as the post-translational modification of viral proteins. But the mechanism of action of chloroquine in anti-2019-nCoV is not clear.",

The crystal structure of COVID-19 main protease in complex with an inhibitor N3 (PDB ID: 6LU7, chain A) [35] was chosen as the model of 3CL protease, and the inhibitor N3 was removed. The ligand N3 (N-[(5-methylisoxazol-3yl)carbonyl]alanyl-l-valyl-n\u223c1\u223c-((1R,2Z)-4-(benzyloxy)-4-oxo-1-{[(3R)-2-oxopyrrolidin-3-yl]methyl}but-2-enyl)-l-leucinamide) was used as a contrast. Recent studies highlighted that SARS-CoV-2 genes share <80% nucleotide identity and 89.10% nucleotide similarity with SARS-CoV genes [36,37]. The X-Ray Structure of PLpro of Human Coronavirus Papain-Like Proteases was used as the model of 2019-nCoV PLpro (PDB ID: 4OVZ, chain A) [38]. The ligand P85 (N-[(4-fluorophenyl)methyl]-1-[(1R)-1-naphthalen-1-ylethyl]piperidine-4-carboxamide) was used as a contrast. The SARS HCoV solved structure (PDB ID: 6NUS, chain A) was used for binding since it was the most sequelogous solved structure (97.08% sequence identity) to SARS-CoV-2 RdRp. 6NUS is a SARS HCoV non-structural protein 12 (nsp12) solved structure (cryo-electron microscopy) with 3.5 \u00c5 resolution, which was deposited in the protein data bank in 2019 [39]. Remdesivir was a antagonist of 2019-nCOV of RdRp was chosen as a contrast. The model of 2019-nCoV spike glycoprotein (PDB ID: 6VSB, chains A, B, C) [40] was used as the model for molecular docking. 6VSB was spike protein prefusion with a single receptor-binding domain solved structure (cryo-electron microscopy) with 3.46 \u00c5 resolution. The ligand NAG (N-acetyl-D-glucosamine) of 6VSB was used as a contrast.",
