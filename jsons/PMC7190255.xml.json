Most notably, the I-PASS Study Group implemented a structured, highly reliable communication tool for resident physicians termed I-PASS (ie, illness severity, patient summary, action list, situation awareness and contingency planning, and synthesis by the receiver).6,7 After implementing I-PASS handoffs, medical errors decreased by 23%, and preventable adverse events decreased by 30%.8 However, such handoff communication interventions have involved resident or nurse handoffs and transfers within a single physical location, with direct person-to-person interactions.1,9",

Annually, it has ~3,500 annual inpatient admissions and sees ~7,500 patients, most requiring ongoing treatment in inpatient and outpatient settings for complex medical diagnoses. The Affiliate Program at St. Jude allows more children access to pediatric oncology care closer to patient homes. Currently, 8 clinics, located throughout the Southeast and the Midwest, are affiliated with St. Jude and contribute 35% of the patients enrolled in St. Jude clinical trials. This project focused specifically on children with solid tumors in 2 of the 8 clinics. Pediatric oncology patients with solid tumors may receive treatment at St. Jude in Memphis, Tenn., or an affiliated clinic. Depending on the type of treatment required, patients may travel at varying intervals between Memphis and an affiliated clinic with different clinical staff at each site, sharing the responsibility of care for such \u201cshared patients.\u201d When patients with solid tumors receiving active therapy arrive at their current treatment site, the providers may or may not be specifically aware of what occurred during previous visits at other sites or if any changes were made to patient treatment plans. Patients had a primary care team at each site, consisting of a pediatric oncologist, an advanced practice provider, and a primary nurse. Each site used different electronic medical record (EMR) systems that were not integrated. Affiliate clinic staff had remote electronic access to the St. Jude EMR, but this was not true for St. Jude staff accessing the affiliate\u2019s EMRs. The St. Jude Institutional Review Board approved this quality improvement project.",

We selected only 2 affiliate sites for this pilot study. We started with the St. Jude Solid Tumor team, given the diverse tumor types were associated with a larger variety of patient transitions. The project leaders at each of the 3 sites facilitated this portion of the project. Each team identified their specific barriers to effective communication by using fishbone diagrams exploring cause and effect (Fig. 3). We identified common barriers of incomplete communication and the lack of closed-loop communication. We found that key details were not always included in communication between sites. In some cases, the information went to one person who may have been out of office. In a few cases, communication with the site was overlooked. Developing a structured, closed-loop communication tool delivered by email was considered as a potential method to improve communication. Using a modification of the I-PASS methodology, the team (coauthors) created an email communication tool termed SMART (mnemonic coined by the first author) (ie, a summary of the plan, medications/roadmap, action plan, return visit date, and transfer confirmation). The receiver replies by confirming an understanding of the care plan (Fig. 4). The communication tool was transmitted by secure email. The clinician who saw the patient at the visit before the transition was responsible for sending the SMART communication tool. Each team had an email distribution that included the primary care teams to receive the SMART communication tool. To ensure sustainability, we assigned SMART champions at each site who were tasked to disseminate the information and encouraged feedback. We sent email reminders every few weeks that included any positive feedback from staff.",

An important difference between most previously published studies and the quality improvement project reported here is that the patient handoffs occurred between geographically distant sites, with cancer care delivered at both sites. The St. Jude Affiliate Program structure may be unique; however, as healthcare evolves with the centralization of specialized care in major centers and delivery of care in the patients\u2019 local communities, this type of patient care transition between providers at the main campus and those in remote sites will most likely become more common.",

When providers are positioned in different geographic locations with different time zones, virtual communication can suffer without a shared understanding of the tasks to be performed.14 Email is unidimensional and lacks a shared mental model. Moreover, email communication risks potential time delays. One method to overcome this barrier is to have structured communication delivered within a prescribed time frame, as illustrated in this report. Using a structured template can avoid key content omissions. Another key component to enhancing virtual communication is for the receiver to confirm receipt to the sender, which was an important component of the SMART tool. Closing the loop of communication added to the coordination of care. It confirmed to the sender that the message was received.",

As others have shown, a disconnect may exist between the perceptions of the sender and the receiver. Berendsen et al15 found highly significant (P < 0.001) disagreement in the perceptions of written communication between specialists at a main campus and practitioners at remote sites. Specialists perceived their communication to be timely and complete, whereas the practitioners in the remote sites did not. In contrast, the practitioners considered their availability and communication to be adequate, whereas the specialists at the main site did not. Understanding the process flow of communication from both sides builds trust and aids more effective communication.",
