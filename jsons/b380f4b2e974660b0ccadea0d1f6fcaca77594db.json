Our objective was to obtain a better understanding of LMTs in order to help travel medicine providers develop improved strategies to decrease the number of LMTs and potentially reduce travel-related morbidity. Methods: We defined LMTs as travellers with a departure date of 7 days or fewer from the medical encounter. We analysed the characteristics and health preparation of 12 494 LMTs who presented to a network of US clinical practices for pre-travel health advice between January 2009 and December 2015. Results: LMTs comprised 16% of all travellers. More LMTs than non-LMTs travelled for business or to visit friends and relatives (VFR) (26% vs 16% and 15% vs 8%, respectively; P < 0.0001). More LMTs also travelled for longer than 1 month (27% vs 21%; P < 0.0001) and visited only urban areas (40% vs 29%; P < 0.0001). At least one travel vaccine was deferred by 18% of LMTs because of insufficient time before departure. Vaccines that required multiple vaccinations, such as Japanese encephalitis and rabies, were the most likely to be deferred because of time constraints. Conclusion: Interventions to improve the timing of pre-travel health consultations should be developed, particularly for business and VFR travellers.

A higher proportion of LMTs were business and VFR travellers compared to those who had a consultation more than 7 days before travel. Business travellers may need to take unexpected trips that make timely pre-travel consultation difficult, and VFRs may seek care at the last minute for a variety of reasons including family emergencies. 18 Although the majority of travellers were able to receive at least one recommended travel vaccine, nearly one in five LMTs had a vaccine deferred because they presented for consultation too close to departure, leaving them vulnerable to vaccine-preventable infections. This was especially true for highconsequence infections with high morbidity or mortality, such as JE and rabies-over half of LMTs for whom JE vaccination was indicated and 41% of LMTs for whom rabies vaccination was indicated did not receive the respective vaccination series because of insufficient time. In this study, many LMTs received a single vaccination against JE or rabies. Single-dose vaccination for a multi-administration vaccine may be adequate for boosting preexisting immune responses but is not recommended for primary immunization. It is not known whether the single doses of JE or rabies were the initial vaccine of a series that would be completed after return or were intended to complete an incomplete series. For frequent travellers, the cumulative lifetime risk of exposure to infections such as JE and rabies should be considered and may warrant commencing a vaccine series (to be completed upon return) even if it does not provide protection for the immediate trip. 19 Our findings highlight that LMTs would be an appropriate target group for increased consideration of accelerated vaccination series. [20] [21] [22] In 2018 the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved an accelerated 7-day primary immunization series for the inactivated JE vaccine (Ixiaro). 23 In addition, a two-dose series of intradermal rabies vaccination given over 7 days was found to be non-inferior to the traditional threedose intramuscular vaccination given over 3 or 4 weeks, 24 and 2018 WHO guidelines for rabies pre-exposure prophylaxis now include accelerated vaccination regimens with two doses given at Days 0 and 7. 25 However, the accelerated rabies schedule is not FDA approved in the USA and has not yet been endorsed by the CDC, which may limit its use in the USA.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 607, "end": 609, "text": "18", "ref_id": "BIBREF17"}, {"start": 1869, "end": 1871, "text": "19", "ref_id": "BIBREF18"}, {"start": 2005, "end": 2009, "text": "[20]", "ref_id": "BIBREF19"}, {"start": 2010, "end": 2014, "text": "[21]", "ref_id": "BIBREF20"}, {"start": 2015, "end": 2019, "text": "[22]", "ref_id": "BIBREF21"}, {"start": 2169, "end": 2171, "text": "23", "ref_id": "BIBREF22"}, {"start": 2364, "end": 2366, "text": "24", "ref_id": "BIBREF23"}, {"start": 2510, "end": 2512, "text": "25", "ref_id": null}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Discussion"}, {"text": "One-half of all LMTs travelling to YF-endemic countries received the YF vaccine, while <1% of both LMTs and non-LMTs had the YF vaccine deferred due to insufficient time.

Among GTEN travellers, three of the five most frequently visited countries for VFR LMTs were holoendemic for YF (Ghana, Nigeria and Guinea) so some of these LMTs may not have had immunity by the time they arrived at their destination. Notably, late vaccination was found to be associated with YF infection in some Chinese workers who acquired YF in Angola. 26 If YF vaccination was a country entry requirement, the traveller may not have been in compliance with the WHO International Health Regulations, thereby putting the traveller at risk of refused entry or quarantine. Late vaccination against YF would also mean that serious adverse vaccine reactions such as YF vaccine-associated neurotropic and viscerotropic disease may not present until after the traveller arrived at his or her destination, where accessing medical care may be more challenging than in the traveller's home country.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 700, "end": 702, "text": "26", "ref_id": "BIBREF25"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Discussion"}, {"text": "Overall, LMTs travelled longer than non-LMTs in our study. This finding appears to be largely due to the higher proportion of VFRs among LMTs, since VFRs have been shown to travel longer than other types of travellers. 27, 28 This observation is a concern because the risk of infections increases with travel duration, and LMTs may not be optimally prepared if they fail to complete travel vaccine series. The greater proportion of LMTs travelling exclusively to urban areas is likely a reflection of the fact that VFR and business travellers are more likely to visit urban rather than rural areas. 29, 30 Although 18% of GTEN travellers were unable to receive a travel vaccine due to time constraints, many LMTs received at least one recommended travel vaccine, thus demonstrating that travellers still benefit from a late pre-travel consultation. Vaccination series that provide long-term protection can also be started and completed upon return if the anticipated lifetime risk of exposure is sufficiently high. A consult close to departure also provides opportunities to discuss risk-reduction measures such as the use of mosquito repellents, avoiding animals and the need to urgently seek post-exposure prophylaxis for potential rabies exposures.
