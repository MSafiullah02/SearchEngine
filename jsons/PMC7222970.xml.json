For these higher risk patients, operative mortality rates for LC approach 20%.2 Gallbladder drainage in the form of a percutaneous cholecystotomy tube has been recommended as an acceptable option for these higher risk patients.3 Newer technologies including endoscopic ultrasound-guided drainage and cryoablation are now being offered.4\u20137",

The 2018 revisions of Tokyo guidelines incorporated the Charlson Comorbidity Index (CCI) and American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) classification to account for patient-specific factors.12 Conventional risk assessment scores, such as ASA score, Model for End-stage-Liver Disease (MELD) score, Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation II (APACHE II) score, Albumin-Bilirubin score (ALBI), and Child-Pugh-Turcotte (CPT) score are of limited use. They either include limited number of preoperative factors, focus on a single organ state, or were constructed for other purposes. Thus, there is a need to identify preoperative clinical variables for high-risk patients with acute cholecystitis undergoing cholecystectomy that encompass the concept of frailty.",

One of the most widely used frailty assessment tools is the frailty index from the Canadian Study on Health and Aging (CSHA).13 In 2013, Velanovich described a simplified edition of the CSHA frailty index, which was named the Modified Frailty Index (mFI).14 The mFI was created by mapping the variables in the American College of Surgeons National Surgical Quality Improvement Project (NSQIP) database used to calculate the CSHA score. Several studies have shown that frailty is predictive of morbidity and prolonged postoperative recovery.11,15\u201319 Few studies have been done to evaluate the role of mFI for preoperative risk assessment of patients with cholecystitis. Therefore, the aim of this study was to determine if the mFI was associated with postoperative morbidity and mortality in patients undergoing laparoscopic cholecystectomy for acute cholecystitis.",

Univariable analysis was performed by the chi square and Mann-Whitney U tests for categorical and continuous variables respectively. A backward stepwise multivariable logistic regression analysis was used to identify risk factors for mortality and Clavien class IV complications. Factors that were significant on univariable analysis (p < 0.05) were included in the multivariable model. The impact of each individual frailty component was studied, and the odds of mortality and Clavien class IV complications were calculated for each mFI component. Results from multivariable analysis were reported as odds ratios (OR), 95% confidence interval (95% CI), and p value. Receiver operator characteristic curves (ROC) and an area under the curve (AUC) were generated to measure accuracy of mFI in predicting mortality and Clavien class IV complications. Statistical analysis was performed using SPSS version 26 (IBM). Two-tailed p values of less than 0.05 were deemed statistically significant.

Multiple models exist for calculating frailty, including the Frailty Index of Cumulative Deficits, Fried\u2019s Frailty Phenotype, and the Frailty Index of Accumulative Deficit.20 These models have been noted to have limitations as they are burdened by either increasing complexity or too simplistic which translates to limited predictability. Despite the increasing variety of frailty models, there is no universally accepted frailty definition or components. However, the mFI strikes a reasonable balance and has demonstrated clinical utility in colorectal, pancreatic, hepatic, vascular, and gynecologic surgery.15,21\u201323 Recently, Murphy and colleagues have studied the impact of frailty on outcomes for patients undergoing various emergency general surgical procedures using mFI.11 In their analysis, 14% of patients underwent a cholecystectomy, and high frail patients were more likely to suffer a serious complications (OR 2.7, 95% CI 1.7\u20136.3) and were less likely to be discharged home (OR 0.25, 95% CI 0.19\u20130.33).
