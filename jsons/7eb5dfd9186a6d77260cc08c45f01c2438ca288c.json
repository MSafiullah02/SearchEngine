Rapid detection, differentiation, and quantitation of TCoV are critical to the diagnosis and control of the disease. A specific one-step real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) assay using TCoV-specific primers and dual-labeled fluorescent probe for detection and quantitation of TCoV in feces and intestine tissues is described in this chapter. The fluorogenic probe labeled with a reporter dye (FAM, 6-carboxytetramethylrhodamine) and a quencher dye (Absolute Quencher\u2122) was designed to bind to a 186 base-pair fragment flanked by the two PCR primers targeting the 3\u2032 end of spike gene (S2) of TCoV. The assay is highly specific and sensitive and can quantitate between 10 2 and 10 10 copies/mL of viral genome. It is useful in monitoring the progression of TCoV-induced atrophic enteritis in the turkey flocks.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Abstract"}], "body_text": [{"text": "Turkey coronavirus (TCoV) causes atrophic enteritis in turkeys and outbreaks or cases of turkey coronaviral enteritis occurred and still occurs in the USA [1] , Canada [2] , Brazil [3] , and Europe [4] . TCoV belongs to species Avian coronavirus of the genus Gammacoronavirus in the family Coronaviridae. The genome of TCoV is a linear positive-sense single-stranded RNA encoding three major structural proteins including spike (S), membrane (M), and nucleocapsid (N) protein. The amino terminal region of S protein (S1) containing receptor-binding domain and neutralizing epitopes can determine host specificity and induce the production of neutralizing antibodies [5] . The carboxyl terminal region of S protein (S2) consisting of transmembrane domain is responsible for cell fusion and virus assembly [6] . S gene is a more common target used for coronavirus (CoV) differentiation because S gene is highly variable among different CoVs while M and N genes are more conserved. Within the S gene, the S2 gene is more conserved than S1 gene between different CoVs and between different isolates or strains of the same CoV [7] . Therefore, S2 gene is chosen as a target to detect TCoV and differentiate TCoV from other CoVs.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 155, "end": 158, "text": "[1]", "ref_id": "BIBREF0"}, {"start": 168, "end": 171, "text": "[2]", "ref_id": "BIBREF1"}, {"start": 181, "end": 184, "text": "[3]", "ref_id": "BIBREF2"}, {"start": 198, "end": 201, "text": "[4]", "ref_id": "BIBREF3"}, {"start": 666, "end": 669, "text": "[5]", "ref_id": "BIBREF4"}, {"start": 804, "end": 807, "text": "[6]", "ref_id": "BIBREF5"}, {"start": 1122, "end": 1125, "text": "[7]", "ref_id": "BIBREF6"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Introduction"}, {"text": "There is no cell culture system for TCoV; thus virus isolation is not feasible. Because the sequence information of TCoV is available, reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR)-based methods with high specificity and sensitivity have been developed [7, 8] . Real-time RT-PCR illustrated here uses a pair of TCoV-specific primers targeting a 186 base-pair fragment of TCoV S2 gene and a dual-labeled probe with a reporter dye (FAM) and a quencher dye (Absolute Quencher\u2122) combined with the 5\u2032 to 3\u2032 exonuclease activity of Taq polymerase to increase the release of reporter dye fluorescence in the course of PCR amplification [9] . Quantitative data can be accessed by the standard curve established with serial dilutions of standard RNA. The procedure does not need post-PCR electrophoresis, so the processing time can be significantly reduced and the risks for carryover and cross-contamination between samples can be lessened. In this chapter, the protocol for one-step real-time RT-PCR to detect, differentiate, and quantitative TCoV RNA in the feces and intestinal tissue is presented. In step 1, feces or intestine tissues were collected into RNAlater RNA stabilization reagent. In step 2, TCoV RNA was extracted from feces using QIAamp viral RNA mini kit or intestine tissues using RNAeasy mini kit. In step 3, the extracted RNA was subjected to one-step real-time RT-PCR for detection and quantitation of TCoV in feces or intestine tissues.
