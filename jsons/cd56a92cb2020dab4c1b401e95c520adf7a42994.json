Participants underwent detailed baseline assessment including characterisation of socio-demographics, lifestyle, medical history, and a series of physical measures. The protocol is publicly available 8 . Linkages with HES data permit longitudinal tracking of health outcomes for all participants with conditions recorded according to international classification of disease (ICD) codes. In addition, UKB has produced algorithmically defined outcome data for incidence of key illness, such as MI, through integration of data from multiple sources 9 . The latest update of the COVID-19 data includes test results from 16/03/2020 to 14/04/2020. During this time period, the UK had moved away from community testing and was almost exclusively testing for COVID-19 in hospital settings. Thus, the UKB COVID-19 cohort in this time period comprises participants who were tested for SARS-CoV-2 whilst admitted to hospital, and therefore are likely to have a relatively severe presentation. The cardiometabolic and demographic   factors were selected based on existing reports of their potential association with COVID-19 outcomes 4,10,11 . ACEi/ARBs were considered due to reports of potential mechanistic role of these medications in the clinical course of COVID-19 5 . We used age, sex, and ethnicity (white Caucasian vs non-white Caucasian) as recorded at baseline. BMI was calculated from height and weight recorded at baseline. Smoking status was based on self-report. Hypertension, diabetes, and hypercholesterolaemia were defined through cross-checking across self-report and HES data. A list of ICD codes used is available in Supplementary Table 1. Information on prior MI was obtained from the UKB algorithmically defined health outcomes. ACEi/ARB use was determined from self-report (Supplementary Table 2 ). We created three cohorts: positives (test positive), confirmed negatives (test negative), and the remaining untested cohort ( Figure 1 ). We firstly compared the COVID-19 positive cohort with the combined cohort of COVID-19 test negative and the untested UKB population. In order to investigate possible bias relating to hospitalisation status, we also considered the importance of these exposure variables in two further comparisons: test positives vs test negatives and test negatives vs untested population. We used logistic regression models to elucidate univariate and then multivariate associations. There was no evidence of multicollinearity with inflation factor (VIF) <2.0 for all covariates. We present odds ratio (OR) for each exposure with the corresponding 95% confidence interval (CI) and p-value.",

In global surveillance data, disparities in COVID-19 mortality rates across different countries are striking, but the interpretation of this data is limited by widely differing testing policies, healthcare systems, resources, and infection control policies. In the UK, national audit data demonstrates as many as one-third of COVID-19 patients admitted to intensive care are from black and minority ethnic backgrounds (BME); a rate which is disproportionate to BME's representation among the general UK population 14 . In our study, ethnicity appeared to have specific association with COVID-19 positive status that appeared independent from the often-quoted confounders of cardiovascular and metabolic morbidity that are known to be higher in prevalence in BME cohorts 15 . Having accounted for cardiometabolic morbidity, the possible explanations for this association remain numerous 16 , gravitating around both genetic and social factors: behavioural, cultural, and socioeconomic differences, including health-seeking behaviour and intergenerational cohabitation are all likely to play a role in the strong disparity observed in our study, providing key targets for both further research and public health policy.",

Animal studies demonstrate, that in mice infected with SARS-CoV, oestrogen-deplete status either due to male gender or ovariectomy is associated with higher risk of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), indicating a possible protective role of oestrogen signalling 19 . Men are known to have higher burden of cardiovascular disease than women up to the perimenopausal years; and thus, lower cardiometabolic morbidity among women in the younger cohort has been postulated to contribute to better outcomes.

In our study, we demonstrate the distinct role of obesity from that of associated cardiometabolic diseases; with the major finding that obesity, and not its comorbidities, had independent and specific association with COVID-19 positivity. This is of important relevance, as mechanistic understanding of the reason behind this association may provide therapeutic insight.

As this was the very first release of this data, the COVID-19 positive caseload was low; this dataset is continuously updated and there may be opportunity in the future to consider a wider range of exposures in larger samples. The low number of COVID-19 cases reflects both the UK national testing policy, in accordance with which individuals not requiring hospital admission were not tested, and the novelty of the disease that precludes any sources of long-term data collection. Due to the observational study design, we cannot comment on causal relationships from the results, however, the prospective nature of the study ensures confident temporal separation of exposure and outcome. Finally, the aforementioned testing policy in act during the time of data collection presents a further limitation to the study. Individuals who were infected with COVID-19 will only have been tested if they were unwell enough to present to hospital; the 'positive' cohort thus mostly represents cases of moderate or high severity. Therefore, whilst this selective approach to testing allow inferences regarding associations with more severe manifestations of the disease, the results of the study may not be generalisable to asymptomatic, or only mildly symptomatic patients.",

More detailed characterisation of these associations in larger and more diverse cohorts is warranted, particularly with regards ethnicity. Investigation of potential biological pathways underlying these observed associations may provide insight into the mechanisms by which SARS-CoV-2 causes disease enabling more informed pursuit of potential therapeutic targets. .
