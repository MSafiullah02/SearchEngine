Asthma is a common respiratory condition with reversible airflow obstruction, whereas COPD typically manifests as irreversible or partially reversible airflow obstruction.\u2022Pathologically, asthma and COPD are forms of chronic bronchiolitis with abnormal airway hyperreactivity, varying degrees of smooth muscle involvement, mucus production, and chronic bronchoconstriction. COPD is further distinguished by alveolar destruction leading to emphysema (which worsens air-trapping brought on by bronchoconstriction).\u2022In asthma, the outpatient therapeutic and management goals are to reduce impairment caused by breathlessness, to reduce risks such as respiratory failure, and to maintain drug therapy. Treatment is directed at reducing airway inflammation and reducing bronchospasm. The most common triggers are environmental allergens, air pollution, and viral infections.\u2022In COPD, the outpatient therapeutic and management goals are to reduce symptoms and risks from exacerbations, and to maintain drug therapy. In contrast with asthma, COPD is a disease caused by chronic and often daily exposure to noxious particles or gases. The small airways in COPD are gradually destroyed leading to chronic bronchitis and emphysema.1\n\u2022COPD is typically preventable with removing exposure to the noxious substance. Emphysema is not present in asthma but is a key pathologic feature of COPD.\u2022At present, there is no cure for either of these conditions.\u2022The goals during hospitalization for asthma and COPD are similar: to prevent acute respiratory failure and complications from hospital management.\n",

The authors recommend a 12-day taper as follows: prednisone 40 mg PO \u00d7 3 days, 30 mg PO \u00d7 3 days, 20 mg \u00d7 3 days, 10 mg PO \u00d7 3 days, then stop.

ICS + LABA + LAMA is considered \u2018triple therapy\u2019, which may offer better symptom control compared with dual ICS + LABA therapy.6.Pulmonary clinic referral is indicated for recurrent asthma exacerbations, hospitalizations, or life-threatening exacerbation.
