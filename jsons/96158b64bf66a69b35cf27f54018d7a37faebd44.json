More than 125000 confirmed cases and 4,607 death cases have been recorded around more than 118 countries. Unfortunately, a coronavirus vaccine is expected to take at least 18 months if it works at all. Moreover, COVID -19 epidemics can mutate into a more aggressive form. Day level information about the COVID -19 spread is crucial to measure the behavior of this new virus globally. Therefore, this study presents a comparison of day level forecasting models on COVID-19 affected cases using time series models and mathematical formulation. The forecasting models and data strongly suggest that the number of coronavirus cases grows exponentially in countries that do not mandate quarantines, restrictions on travel and public gatherings, and closing of schools, universities, and workplaces (\"Social Distancing\").",

The COVID-19 has reported being a novel coronavirus of a typical pneumonia since Dec 31, 2019. The COVID-19 started in Wuhan Chinese city. Simultaneously, Both the international world and other Chinese cities have received infected cases. On 11 March 2020, the world health organization (WHO) stated that the global COVID-19 outbreak is a pandemic because of the speed and scale of transmission of the virus. From 118 countries and territories, there are 125,000 cases reported to WHO. Moreover, the number of cases announced outside China has almost doubled 13-folds in the past two weeks and the affected countries' number has almost tripled Wu et al. 2020 ).

The major category of forecasting is qualitative methods, explanatory (causal) techniques and time series algorithms. A time series is a sequence of discrete-time data points listed in time order (Lin et al. 2003) . Several models of time series exist such as moving average (MA), weighted moving average (WMA), and single exponential smoothing (SES). A moving average (MA) is analyzing the data points by averaging the series of data points. A moving average (MA) depends on the assumption of future observation is similar to recently previous observations. Moving average of the next point equals the average of the recent K observation. As K increases, most forecast relies on older data. Mathematically, MA can be computed in the following formula (Box et al. 1970; Yang et al. 2018 ):",

As a result, the number of coronavirus cases compounds at more than 25% per day in countries that do not mandate social distancing. This behavior is consistent across Iran, Italy, Spain, France, and the UK, each measured independently from the date of the first case in that country. Moreover, at a density of approximately 9.7 coronavirus cases per 100,000 inhabitants, Italy mandated on 8 th March 2020 a complete regional lock-down, with movement restrictions applying to about 16 million people (25% of the population of Italy). The following day, on 9 th March 2020, the lock-down was extended to the entire country (100% of the population of Italy). For example, in Egypt, the country has not yet closed its borders. The current population of Egypt is 102,334,404 inhabitants where the confirmed cases ratio is 1.06 case / one million inhabitants. Up to data the death rate is approximately 2% in Egypt. As shown in Fig.17 As shown in Fig.18 , COVID-19 confirmed cases change rate in Egypt steady increases from 12% to 36% in 9 th March 2020 to 14 th March 2020, respectively. However, this change rage has dramatically increased in to 500% and 320% in 6 th March 2020 and 8 th March 2020, respectively. The forecasting model with 95% confidence interval expects that the number of confirmed cases in Egypt will be doubled up to 4-folds in the next month without any sudden raise in the infection change rage. Therefore, the forecasting models and data strongly suggest that the number of coronavirus cases grows exponentially in Egypt as displayed in Fig.19 coronavirus and has severe, life-threatening symptoms. In other words, no regional beds to house patients who are severely ill.",
