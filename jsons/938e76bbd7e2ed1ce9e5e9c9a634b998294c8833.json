With the rapid 24 spread across the globe, many regions were overwhelmed with patients requiring respiratory 25 support [4] [5] [6] . Public health interventions in China provided guidance for other regions in the 26 world on how to face a looming worldwide crisis [7] . After the first identified infection in the 27 United States (US) in late January 2020 and subsequent evidence of community spread, state 28 governments began drastically limiting businesses and issuing stay at home orders. Hospitals 29 began limiting elective surgical procedures following national health guidelines in an effort to: 1) 30 slow the spread of the disease, 2) protect patients and staff from asymptomatic or undiagnosed 31 carriers, 3) conserve personal protective equipment (PPE), and 4) reserve inpatient capacity for 32 the COVID-19 infections [8, 9] . With the World Health Organization (WHO) declaration of a 33 global pandemic on March 11, 2020, elective cases in the US, including hip and knee 34 arthroplasty, began to be postponed indefinitely or canceled outright. The US Surgeon General 35 recommended stopping elective surgery on March 14, 2020. 36",
