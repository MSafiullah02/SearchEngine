Data on pneumonia disease episodes are less complete, but declined from 850,000 in 2000 to 395,000 in 2013 [5]. Despite these impressive reductions, pneumonia remains one of the biggest killers of young children. In 2015, 14% of under-5 deaths in the WHO Western Pacific region were attributed to pneumonia [5]. Other causes of under-5 mortality were mostly concentrated in the neonatal period, including prematurity (16%), intra-partum complications (13%), congenital anomalies (13%) and neonatal sepsis (4%), with injuries (11%) and diarrhea (6%) making substantial contributions in the post-neonatal period [5]. The available data indicate that the majority (>75%) of pneumonia-related deaths occur in six countries; Cambodia, China, Laos, Papua New Guinea, the Philippines and Viet Nam [6].

Despite recent progress, the pneumonia disease burden in Viet Nam remains nearly 10 times higher than in developed country settings like Australia and Europe. In 2015, WHO estimated that acute respiratory infection accounted for 11% of under-5 mortality in Viet Nam; while human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection and malaria combined, accounted for less than 2% [5].

Introduction of the highly effective Hib conjugate vaccine eliminated severe disease (pneumonia, meningitis and epiglottitis) in settings with good vaccination coverage [19], [20], [21]. Since Hib vaccination reduces carriage rates in young children, there is less transmission in the community and therefore unvaccinated individuals benefit as well [20]. By the end of 2014, Hib vaccination has been introduced to 192 countries with 56% of children being fully immunized; full vaccination coverage in the WHO Western Pacific Region was only 21% [22]. In Viet Nam, free Hib vaccination has been included in the National Expanded Program on Immunization since July 2010. At the end of 2013, 59% of Vietnamese infants had received all three doses [4]. In south-east Viet Nam radiological child pneumonia was reduced by 39% after Hib vaccine introduction [21]. Disease caused by non-type B H. influenzae may be increasing in prevalence [19], [23]. A lung aspirate study from The Gambia reported that 20% of positive H. influenzae samples from young children with pneumonia were non-type B [24] and in a follow-on study, H. influenza (all non-type b) accounted for 5% of all bacteria isolated in young children with severe pneumonia [25]\n.\n",

There are more than ninety S. pneumoniae serotypes, but less than 20 serotypes are responsible for more than 70% of invasive disease [28]. The most common serotypes found in the USA were included in the initial 7-valent conjugated pneumococcal vaccine (PCV-7), which reduced pneumonia-related hospitalization by 39% [29]. In South Africa, a 9-valent PCV vaccine (PCV-9) reduced the incidence of invasive S. pneumoniae disease by 83% (65% in HIV-infected children) and all-cause X-ray diagnosed pneumonia by 20% among HIV uninfected children [30]. As observed with the roll-out of conjugated Hib vaccine, benefit also accrued to non-vaccinated children and older adults [31]. In 2007, the WHO recommended PCV in all childhood immunisation programs, but global implementation has been poor. By 2014, PCV was introduced in 117 countries with 31% global coverage [22]. In addition to cost, there were concerns about sub-optimal serotype composition for developing country settings. This has been partially addressed by the newer PCV-10 and 13 conjugate vaccines. PCV-10 also provides protection against non-type B H. influenza\n[28], but in cost-effectiveness trials conducted in Malaysia and Hong Kong, PCV-13 seemed to offer the best value [32]. In Viet Nam, PCV use is advised in national guidance documents, but it is not provided free of charge and coverage is low. Limited data on the etiology of child pneumonia in the WHO Western Pacific region makes it difficult to convince policy makers to fund vaccines for prevention. Given the limitations of etiological studies, indirect evidence should be collected by measuring the impact of programmatic implementation of bacterial conjugate vaccines on the burden of radiographic pneumonia and hospitalizations due to pneumonia in Western Pacific countries.",

An estimated 16 million disease episodes and 195,000 deaths are attributed to pertussis every year; 95% occurring in low and middle income countries [33], [34]. In recent years the numbers of reported cases have increased even in countries with high vaccination coverage [33] with concern about the durability of protection provided by acellular pertussis vaccines [35]. Respiratory pathogens that are currently not vaccine-preventable include S. aureus, Klebsiella pneumoniae and atypical bacteria. An earlier study from Chile found S. aureus to be a common isolate in young children diagnosed with pneumonia (60.5%) [36], but recent studies found it mostly in children at the severe end of the pneumonia disease spectrum. A multi-centre trial conducted in Bangladesh, Ecuador, India, Mexico, Pakistan, Yemen and Zambia found S. aureus in 42% of 112 bacteria isolated from blood and lung aspirate samples in children with WHO-defined \u201cvery severe\u201d pneumonia [37]. Methicillin resistant S. aureus (MRSA) is of increasing concern and often presents with empyema or necrotic pneumonia following influenza [34]. S. aureus, S. pneumoniae, H. influenza, K. pneumonia and Escherichia coli have been identified as the most common bacterial pathogens in severely malnourished children with pneumonia [38]. Non-typhoid Salmonella species have also been recognized as important pathogens causing invasive sepsis with clinical features of pneumonia in malaria and HIV-endemic parts of sub-Saharan Africa [39], but its relevance in other settings has not been confirmed [40], [41]. Group B streptococci and the atypical bacterium Chlamydia trachomatis may infect babies during vaginal delivery and are mainly restricted to the perinatal period [34]; other atypical bacteria are common respiratory pathogens across the age range.",

M. pneumoniae IgM was detected in 57% of serum samples in children with acute respiratory symptoms in Hubei, China [43]. Similar findings from Suzhou identified M. pneumoniae and respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) as the most common respiratory pathogens in hospitalized children [44]. A study in Ha Noi, Viet Nam, found atypical pathogens in 45% (97/215) of pneumonia cases in whom a potential pathogen was identified. Among children with atypical pneumonia, M. pneumoniae was considered the likely pathogen in 87% (84/97) of \u201csevere\u201d cases [42].

            "text": "Globally, Mycobacterium tuberculosis is the commonest cause of death due to an infectious disease and the majority of cases occur in the Asia-Pacific region [45], [46]. Western Pacific countries with high caseloads include China, Viet Nam, The Philippines, Cambodia and Papua New Guinea. High incidence rates are indicative of poor epidemic control and since children develop disease in settings where adults spread the infection, Figure 2\nindicates areas where M. tuberculosis is likely to be an important lung pathogen in children. The WHO estimated that one million children developed tuberculosis in 2014 [47], but case detection is a major challenge [48]. Tuberculosis is rarely considered in young children presenting with acute severe pneumonia, although its presence as a primary cause or co-infection is well documented in these cases [49], [50]. Tuberculosis was diagnosed at autopsy in 11% of HIV-infected and 8% HIV-uninfected children who died from pneumonia in five African countries [51]. Among 270 severe pneumonia cases evaluated in Uganda, around 20% had clinical manifestations suggestive of tuberculosis and 10% were culture-confirmed for M. tuberculosis\n[52]. Unfortunately, service delivery channels for children with tuberculosis are poorly developed in most tuberculosis endemic areas [53]. In China and Viet Nam children (<15 years) represented less than 1% of all reported tuberculosis cases in 2014 [45]. This is well below the estimated global average of 10%. Of 103 children (<15 years) diagnosed with tuberculosis in Northern Viet Nam, most were in the 5-14 year age range [54], suggesting gross under-detection in young children who are known to be most vulnerable [55]. Following a successful proof-of-concept study in 4 provinces [48], the Viet Nam National Tuberculosis Control Program plans to expand community-based contact screening and provision of preventive therapy to all provinces by 2020.",

In Suzhou, China, influenza viruses were found in 17% of positive nasopharyngeal swabs in children with pneumonia [62]. The most effective way to prevent influenza is seasonal vaccination [66], but this is rarely used in Viet Nam; not even among health care workers who are at high risk of contracting and spreading the infection within health care facilities [67]. Maternal influenza vaccination provides protection to newborn babies (49% in a study in South Africa) [68], but vaccine delivery in pregnancy remains controversial in many Western Pacific countries. Avian influenza strains found in wild and domestic bird populations have caused cases of severe pneumonia in China [69]. So far wide-scale epidemic outbreaks have not been recorded, but the risk that a new human-adapted influenza strain with pandemic potential may emerge, requires constant vigilance.",

According to the World Economic Forum, the emergence of new infectious diseases and the rise of drug-resistant infections are now ranked as second only to water crises in terms of potential global impact [92]. Antimicrobial resistance is predominantly driven by excessive antibiotic use, which is a particular problem in Asia given unrestricted access to antibiotics, strong commercial incentives and uncertain disease aetiology with uncharacterized drug resistance profiles. Studies have demonstrated that many children with non-severe pneumonia do not require any antibiotics at all [93]. Asian countries are more likely to follow developed country guidelines than those developed for low income settings [94].
