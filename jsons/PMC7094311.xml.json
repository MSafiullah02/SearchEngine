In particular, the importance of the variance of the population along a phenotypic trait is illustrated by the fundamental theorem of natural selection\n[15], and the breeder's equation\n[21]: the evolution speed of a population along a one dimensional fitness gradient (or under artificial selection) is proportional to the variance of the initial population. Recently, the phenotypic variance of populations has also come to light as an important element to describe the evolutionary dynamics of ecosystems (where many interacting species are considered) [27], [4], [26].",

            "text": "Over the last decade, the issue of Evolutionary Rescue emerged as an important question [3], [10], [17] (see also the seminal work of Luria and Delbr\u00fcck [20]), and led to a new interest in the phenotypic distribution of populations, beyond phenotypic variance. Evolutionary Rescue is concerned with a population living in an environment that changes suddenly. The population will survive either if some individuals in the population carry an unusual trait that turns out to be successful in the new environment, or if new mutants able to survive in the new environment appear before the population goes extinct (see [22] for a discussion on the relative effect of de novo mutations and standing variance in Evolutionary Rescue). In any case, the fate of the population will not be decided by the properties of the bulk of its density, but rather by the properties of the tail of the initial distribution of the individuals, close to the favourable traits for the new environment. A first example of such problems comes from emerging diseases [16]: Animal infections sometimes are able to infect humans. This phenomenon, called zoonose, is the source of many human epidemics: HIV, SARS, Ebola, MERS-CoV, etc. A zoonose may happen if a pathogen that reaches a human has the unusual property of being adapted to this new human host. A second example comes from the emergence of microbes resistant to an antimicrobial drug that is suddenly spread in the environment of the microbe. This second phenomenon can easily be tested experimentally [3], [24], and has major public health implications [9].",

            "text": "Most papers devoted to the genetic diversity of populations structured by a continuous phenotypic trait describe the properties of mutation\u2013selection equilibria. It is however also interesting to describe the genetic diversity of populations that are not at equilibrium (transient dynamics): pathogen populations for instance are often in transient situations, either invading a new host, or being eliminated by the immune system. We refer to [18] for a review on transient dynamics in ecology. For asexual populations structured by a continuous phenotypic trait, several models exist, corresponding to different biological assumptions [11]. If the mutations are modelled by a diffusion, the steady populations (for a model close to (1), but where mutations are modelled by a Laplacian) are Gaussian distributions [19], [6]. Furthermore, [1], [14] have considered some transient dynamics for this model. In the model that we will consider (see (1)), the mutations are modelled by a non-local term. It was shown in [7] (see also [6]) that mutation\u2013selection equilibria are then Cauchy profiles (under some assumptions), and this result has been extended to more general mutation kernels in [8], provided that the mutation rate is small enough. Finally, let us notice that the case of sexual populations is rather different, since recombinations by themselves can imply that a mutation\u2013recombination equilibrium exists, even without selection. We refer to the infinitesimal model [5], and to [25] for some studies on the phenotypic distribution of sexual species in a context close to the one presented here for asexual populations.",

            "text": "In this article, we consider a population consisting of individuals structured by a quantitative phenotypic trait x\u2208I (I open interval of R containing 0), and denote by f:=f(t,x)\u22650 its density. Here, the trait x is fully inherited by the offspring (if no mutation occurs), so that x is indeed rather a breeding value than a phenotypic trait (see [23]). We assume that individuals reproduce with a rate 1, and die at a ratex2+\u222bIf(t,y)dy. This means that individuals with trait x=0 are those who are best adapted to their environment, and that the fitness decreases like a parabola around this optimal trait (this is expected in the surroundings of a trait of maximal fitness). It also means that the strength of the competition modelled by the logistic term is identical for all traits. When an individual of trait x\u2208I gives birth, we assume that the offspring will have the trait x with probability 1\u2212\u03b5, and a different trait x\u2032 with probability \u03b5\u2208(0,1). \u03b5 is then the probability that a mutation affects the phenotypic trait of the offspring. We can now define the growth rate of the population of trait x (that is the difference between the rate of births without mutation, minus the death rate) asr\u03b5(t,x)=1\u2212\u03b5\u2212x2\u2212\u222bIf(t,y)dy. When a mutation affects the trait of the offspring, we assume that the trait x\u2032 of the mutated offspring is drawn from a law over the set of phenotypes I\u2282R with a density \u03b3:=\u03b3(x)\u2208L1(I). The function \u03b3 then satisfies\u03b3(x)\u22650,\u222bI\u03b3(x)dx=1 (we assume moreover in some of the mathematical statements that \u03b3 is bounded, C1, with bounded derivative and that it is strictly positive on I). The main assumption here is that the law of the trait of a mutated offspring does not depend on the trait of its parent. This classical assumption, known as house of cards is not the most realistic, but it can be justified when the mutation rate is small [6] (see also [8]). All in all, we end up with the following equation:(1)\u2202f\u03b5(t,x)\u2202t=r\u03b5(t,x)f\u03b5(t,x)+\u03b5\u03b3(x)\u222bIf\u03b5(t,y)dy. This paper is devoted to the study of the asymptotic behaviour of the solutions of equation (1) when \u03b5 is small and t large and it is organized as follows. In the rest of Section 1 the main results are quoted, first in an informal way, and then as rigorous statements. Section 2 contains the proof of Proposition 1.1 and Theorem 1.2, and finally, in Section 3, Theorem 1.3 is proved.",

Before providing the precise statements of our results (see Subsection 1.3), we will briefly describe them here, and illustrate them with numerical simulations. The numerical simulations presented in Fig. 1\nand Fig. 2\nare obtained thanks to a finite difference scheme (explicit Runge\u2013Kutta in time), and we illustrate our result with a single simulation of (1) with \u03b5=10\u22122, I=[\u22123/2,3/2], \u03b3(x)=140\u03c0e\u2212x220 and f\u03b5(0,x)=\u03932(\u03b5,x\u22121) (see the definition of \u03932 in eq.

This example is guided by the Evolutionary Rescue experiments described in Subsection 1.1, where the sudden change is obtained by the addition of e.g. salt or antibiotic to a bacterial culture.",

Our study is a general analysis of this problem and we do not have a particular application in mind. An interesting and (to our knowledge) new feature described by our study is that the tails of the trait distribution in a population can change drastically between \u201cshort times\u201d, that is 1\u226at\u226a\u03b5\u22122/3 and \u201clarge times\u201d, that is t\u226b\u03b5\u22124: the distribution is initially close to a Gaussian distribution, with small tails, and then converges to a thick tailed Cauchy distribution. This result could have significant consequences for evolutionary rescue: the tails of the distribution then play an important role. Quantifying the effect of this property of the tails of the distributions would however require further work, in particular on the impact of stochasticity (the number of pathogen is typically large, but finite). The plasticity of the pathogen (see [12]) may also play an important role.",

So [min\u2061(1\u2212\u03b5\u2212a2,1\u2212\u03b5\u2212b2),1\u2212\u03b5] is contained in the spectrum of A\u03b5. The claim follows from the fact that the spectrum is a closed set.On the other hand, notice that (for x0\u2208I), 1\u2212\u03b5\u2212x02 is not an eigenvalue, since the potential corresponding eigenfunction \u03b3(x)x02\u2212x2 is not an integrable function on I (remember that \u03b3 does not vanish).Let us now compute the resolvent operator of A\u03b5, that is, let us try to solve the equation(8)A\u03b5f\u2212\u03bbf=g\u2208L1(I). For \u03bb\u2209J, defining p:=\u222bIf(y)dy, (8) gives(9)f(x)=\u03b5\u03b3(x)p\u2212g(x)\u03bb\u2212(1\u2212\u03b5\u2212x2). Integrating, we get(10)(1\u2212\u03b5\u222bI\u03b3(x)\u03bb\u2212(1\u2212\u03b5\u2212x2)dx)p=\u222bI\u2212g(x)\u03bb\u2212(1\u2212\u03b5\u2212x2)dx, and \u03bb belongs to the resolvent set unless the factor of p on the left hand side vanishes. Therefore \u03c3(A)=J\u222a{\u03bb\u2208C:\u03b5\u222bI\u03b3(x)\u03bb\u2212(1\u2212\u03b5\u2212x2)dx=1}.Since for any real number \u03bb>1\u2212\u03b5, the function F\u03b5(\u03bb):=\u03b5\u222bI\u03b3(x)\u03bb\u2212(1\u2212\u03b5\u2212x2)dx is continuous, strictly decreasing, and satisfies lim\u03bb\u21921\u2212\u03b5\u2061F\u03b5(\u03bb)=+\u221e (recall that \u03b3(0)>0) and lim\u03bb\u2192+\u221e\u2061F\u03b5(\u03bb)=0, we see that there is a unique real solution of F\u03b5(\u03bb)=1 in (1\u2212\u03b5,\u221e). We denote it by \u03bb\u03b5.Taking g(x)=0 in (8), we see that \u03bb\u03b5 is an eigenvalue with corresponding normalized strictly positive eigenvector\u03c8\u03b5=\u03b5\u03b3(x)\u03bb\u03b5\u2212(1\u2212\u03b5\u2212x2).\nTaking g=\u03c8\u03b5 and \u03bb=\u03bb\u03b5 we see that the left hand side in (10) vanishes, whereas the right hand side is strictly negative, so that A\u03b5f\u2212\u03bb\u03b5f=\u03c8\u03b5 has no solution and hence \u03bb\u03b5 is algebraically simple.Indeed, it also follows from (10) that the range of A\u03b5\u2212\u03bb\u03b5Id coincides with the kernel of the linear form defined on L1(I) by the L\u221e function 1\u03bb\u03b5\u2212(1\u2212\u03b5)+x2 (which is the eigenvector corresponding to the eigenvalue \u03bb\u03b5 of the adjoint operator A\u03b5\u204e) and hence it is a closed subspace of L1(I). Therefore, \u03bb\u03b5 is a pole of the resolvent (see Theorem A.3.3 of [13]). Furthermore, sinceF\u03b5(1)=\u03b5\u222bI\u03b3(x)\u03b5+x2dx=\u222bI\u03b3(x)1+(x\u03b5)2dx\u27f6\u03b5\u219200, we see that F\u03b5(1)<1 for \u03b5 small enough, and hence \u03bb\u03b5<1.Substituting \u03bb by a+bi in the characteristic equation(11)1+\u03b5\u222bI\u03b3(x)(1\u2212\u03b5\u2212x2\u2212\u03bb)dx=0, we have that the imaginary part is \u2212\u03b5b\u222bI\u03b3(x)(1\u2212\u03b5\u2212x2\u2212\u03bb)dx. Since \u03b3(x)>0, there are no nonreal solutions of (11). \u25a1\nRemark 2.1Note that lim\u03b5\u21920\u2061\u03bb\u03b5=1.\n",

Similarly, since for \u03b5 small enough, \u03bb\u03b5\u2212(1\u2212\u03b5)\u22642(\u03b3(0)\u03c0\u03b5)2, we have(18)\u03b5\u222bI\u03b3(x)(\u03bb\u03b5\u2212(1\u2212\u03b5\u2212x2))2dx\u2265\u03b5min[\u2212x0,x0]\u2061\u03b3(x)\u222b\u2212x0x0dx(2(\u03b3(0)\u03c0\u03b5)2+x2)2\u2265K3\u03b52, where x0 is any positive value in I.For the numerator we have, on the one hand,(19)\u03b52\u222bIf0(x)\u03bb\u03b5\u2212(1\u2212\u03b5\u2212x2)dx\u2264\u222bI\u03b52(\u03b3(0)\u03c0\u03b5)22+x2f0(x)dx, where the right hand side tends to 0 when \u03b5 goes to 0 by an easy application of the Lebesgue dominated convergence theorem (note that the integrand is bounded above by 2(\u03b3(0)\u03c0)2f0(x)).On the other hand, notice that there exists an interval J\u2282I which does not contain 0 such that \u222bJf0(x)dx>0.

This completes the proof. \u25a1\nRemark 2.2If f0(x) is bounded below by a positive number c in a neighbourhood (\u2212\u03b4,\u03b4) of 0, then the lower estimate can be improved using that\u222b\u2212\u03b4\u03b4\u03b5k2\u03b52+x2dx=2karctan\u2061(\u03b4k\u03b5)\u27f6\u03b5\u21920+\u03c0k. Indeed, for \u03b5 small enough\u03b5\u222bIf0(x)\u03bb\u03b5\u2212(1\u2212\u03b5\u2212x2)dx\u2265\u03b5\u222bIf0(x)2(\u03b3(0)\u03c0\u03b5)2+x2dx\u2265c\u222b\u2212\u03b4\u03b4\u03b5(2\u03b3(0)\u03c0)2\u03b52+x2dx\u27f6\u03b5\u21920+c2\u03b3(0). So in this case, for \u03b5 small enough,cf0\u2265c2\u03b3(0)\u03b5K0\u03b52=:K\u03b5 for some constant K independent of \u03b5.\n",

Since the second condition is weaker than the first one for \u03b5 small enough, (23) holds whenever t\u03b5 is such that e\u2212\u03c1\u03b5t\u03b5\u2264cf02K\u03b5, i.e., e\u2212\u03bb\u03b5t\u03b5\u2264(cf02K\u03b5)\u03bb\u03b5\u03c1\u03b5 and \u03b5>0 is sufficiently small. So, (cf02K\u03b5)\u03bb\u03b5\u03c1\u03b5 is also a lower bound in (22), and we finally have|e\u2212\u03bb\u03b5t+e\u2212\u03bb\u03b5t\u222b0t(cf0+\u03c6(s))e\u2212\u03bb\u03b5sds|\u2265(cf02K\u03b5)\u03bb\u03b5\u03c1\u03b5.
