[1] [2] [3] [4] [5] [6] [7] [8] [9] [10] [11] Among these hospital admissions, a small percentage of children would require pediatric intensive care unit (PICU) support. [12] [13] [14] [15] In a Brazilian study of 261 children aged less than 7 years with a clinical diagnosis of pneumonia and/or bronchiolitis who were admitted to the PICU, a viral respiratory infection prevalence of 38.7% was found. 13 44.6% of bronchiolitis cases had viral infection, with respiratory syncytial virus responsible for more than one-third of cases. One quarter of pneumonia cases had viral infection. The overall case fatality rate was 2.7%, and adenovirus showed a significantly higher case fatality rate than RSV. Injected antibiotics were often used in these infections. Risk factors such as prematurity, immunodeficiency and underlying cardiac disease are often implicated but rarely present. Of the patients who died from respiratory viral infection, only one patient had an underlying cardiac disease. In an Australian study, influenza infection was found to cause significant morbidity and mortality in young children admitted to a PICU, most of whom were not currently recommended for annual influenza vaccination. 14 They reported that half of the children had some form of pre-existing morbidity.

Pre-existing conditions such as prematurity and chronic lung disease were only present in children with RSV infection. Asthma did not appear to be a significant risk factor and occurred only in one patient with influenza A infection. These viruses caused both upper respiratory (croup) and lower respiratory diseases (bronchiolitis, pneumonia).
