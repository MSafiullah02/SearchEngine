Abstract J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f Purpose: To analyse the high-resolution computed tomography (HRCT) early imaging features and the changing trend of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pneumonia. Materials and Methods: Forty-six patients with COVID-19 pneumonia who had an isolated lesion on the first positive CT were enrolled in this study. The following parameters were recorded for each lesion: sites, sizes, location (peripheral or central), attenuation (ground-glass opacity or consolidation), and other abnormalities (supply pulmonary artery dilation, air bronchogram, interstitial thickening, etc.). The follow-up CT images were compared with the previous CT scans, and the development of the lesions was evaluated. Results: The lesions tended to be peripheral and subpleural. All the lesions exhibited ground-glass opacity with or without consolidation. A higher proportion of supply pulmonary artery dilation (89.13% [41/46]) and air bronchogram (69.57% [32/46]) were found. Other findings included thickening of the intralobular interstitium and a halo sign of ground glass around a solid nodule. Cavitation, calcification or lymphadelopathy were not observed. The reticular patterns were noted from the 14 days after symptoms onset in 7 of 20 patients (45%).

A halo sign of ground glass around a solid nodule was observed in 12 of 46 patients. Pleural effusion was uncommon. No cavitation, calcification or lymphadenopathy was found in this study.", "latex": null, "type": "figure"}, "FIGREF6": {"text": "The dynamic changes in lesion manifestation were closely monitored by analyzing multiple follow-up CT scans. Although lesion development progressed in a time-dependent manner, we observed that at 3 to 14 days after disease onset, patients exhibited increased lung involvement accompanied by lesion enlargement andJ o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f expansion, or new lesions were observed, indicating a potential progressive stage of the infection. This stage might be critical for treatment intervention and requires close clinical observations. During the reconstruction stage, which occurred at 7 to 31 days after disease onset in our studies, the lesions were absorbed and formed irregular linear opacities. In further analysis, we found that the lesions were absorbed but that patients developed new lesions at 10-18 days. Additionally, mixed and predominantly reticular patterns were noted from 14 day in 7 of 20 patients (45%) and the lesions were completely absorbed only in 2 of 7 patients (28.57%) within 22-31 days after the onset of initial symptoms. Long-term follow-up with CT and concomitant functional studies are required to determine the long-term pulmonary sequelae of COVID-19pneumonia. Several studies have suggested that COVID-19 enters into host cells via cell receptor angiotensin converting enzyme II (ACE2)[13][14][15], and excessive activation of immune cells leads to the production of a large number of inflammatory cytokines, such as IL-6, causing diffuse damage to pulmonary capillary endothelial cells and alveolar epithelium. Though with meticulous treatments, it takes a time for the immune response to build and produce antibodies to suppress virus replication. A large sample study is needed to establish the evolution mechanism of CT characteristics during the disease.", "latex": null, "type": "figure"}, "FIGREF7": {"text": ".-Number in parentheses are percentages.", "latex": null, "type": "figure"}, "TABREF0": {"text": "Number of patients with affected segments in particular lung regionsNote.-Number in parentheses are percentages.", "latex": null, "type": "table"}, "TABREF1": {"text": "Number of sizes of Lesions on the first positive CT Note.-Number in parentheses are percentage Table 4 Number of patients with particular characteristics on the first positive CT J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f Note.-Number in parentheses are percentages.", "latex": null, "type": "table"}}, "back_matter": [{"text": "We express our gratitude to Qihang Chen(Department of Radiology, Beijing Hospital ) for consultation on CT images.
