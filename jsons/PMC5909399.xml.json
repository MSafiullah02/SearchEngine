            "text": "The 2009 influenza A (H1N1) pandemic highlighted the essential role of hospital care of the severely ill in the response to public health emergencies. Early reports from Mexico and Canada of intensive care units (ICUs) filled to capacity with patients with severe respiratory infections helped to calibrate the early, aggressive global public health response.1, 2, 3 The critical care medical community and public health reacted with unprecedented coordination to describe severe disease, to disseminate data on the epidemiology and care of pandemic patients, and to convey the impact of the outbreak on health systems.4, 5, 6, 7, 8 While the worst\u2010case scenario of a 1918\u2010scale pandemic was avoided, there were reports of patients with severe disease stressing critical care services in communities throughout the world.2, 9, 10, 11 These reports show that severely ill patients can divert resources and impact the balance of care delivery even in hospitals where the overall capacity is not exceeded. This problem is particularly acute in resource\u2010limited settings where there is decreased capacity to manage severe illness. While building resource\u2010intensive and highly technological ICUs is not feasible for many parts of the world, much can be done to improve care for severely ill patients in more austere environments. In this review, we discuss the inter\u2010related issues of pandemic influenza, severe seasonal influenza, and severe illness more generally. Given the burden of severe illness in resource\u2010limited settings, it is vital to improve capacity to care for severely ill individuals in these environments.",

These groups included young adults, pregnant women, obese persons, and indigenous persons.13 In low\u2010 and middle\u2010income countries, where laboratory testing for clinical care or for public health surveillance was limited, the full impact of the 2009 pandemic has been harder to measure.19, 20, 21 However, modeling studies estimate that there were disproportionately increased pandemic deaths in resource\u2010limited regions.22 Compared with the Americas, the risk of pandemic respiratory and circulatory mortality was 1\u00b74 times higher in Southeast Asia and 2\u00b74 times higher in Africa.22 These data underscore the importance of improving clinical management of influenza disease in resource\u2010limited settings.",

A 2012 update of this review, limited to randomized controlled trials, controlled prospective cohort studies, and systematic reviews/meta\u2010analyses found only seven pertinent studies, mostly of adults.23 One study found benefit of convalescent plasma infusion for severe illness,24 three studies found no benefit of corticosteroids for severe respiratory disease,25, 26, 27 and three studies had mixed results on the benefit of extracorporeal lung support for severe respiratory disease.28, 29, 30 No study identifying a therapeutic benefit from an intervention was applicable to healthcare delivery in resource\u2010limited settings.",

Yet, the contribution of seasonal influenza to severe illness is substantial, especially in resource\u2010limited settings. A variety of data support this assertion. Among children younger than 5 years of age in sub\u2010Saharan Africa and South Asia, influenza infection and co\u2010infections are commonly identified during hospitalizations for acute lower respiratory infections (ALRI).31, 32, 33, 34 The only systematic review and meta\u2010analysis that estimates the global burden of severe influenza disease was recently published.35 The study, which analyzes only early childhood disease, reports that 99% of influenza\u2010related cases of severe ALRI among children younger than 5 years occur in low\u2010 and middle\u2010income countries, and that 13% of all ALRI in this age group are associated with influenza virus infection. The study dispels the myth that influenza is only a problem in temperate regions. The authors calculated that the incidence rate of severe influenza\u2010associated ALRI in early childhood is similar in developing countries as compared with industrialized, temperate countries (both are around 1\u20132 episodes per 1 000 child\u2010years).35 This pediatric study underestimates the overall burden of severe influenza, as research has demonstrated that influenza mortality among adults is considerably higher than in children.36 In the United States, approximately 100 children die annually from influenza virus infection, as compared with greater than 32 000 influenza\u2010attributable deaths among persons older than 65 years.36 The burden of influenza among adults may be even higher in developing settings. Recent data from South Africa suggest that the risk of influenza mortality among the elderly in that country is greater than in the United States.37 Further, countries with a high prevalence of HIV/AIDS and minimal availability of highly active antiretroviral therapy may also experience substantial risk of influenza mortality among non\u2010elderly adults.38 Thus, beyond pandemic planning and response, it is critical to optimize care of severe seasonal influenza in resource\u2010limited settings.",

The vast majority of severe illness occurs in low\u2010 and middle\u2010income countries,42 yet there are currently little clinical data or evidence\u2010based management guidelines to improve hospital care for patients in these settings.43\n",

This approach also promotes the widespread adoption of research\u2010proven interventions such as low tidal volume lung protective ventilation for ARDS.40, 46 Similarly, several studies suggest that sepsis outcomes may be improved by the use of protocolized sepsis care pathways.47, 48 Syndromic management is therefore an important tool in improving care of severely ill patients.

            "text": "Evidence of the benefit of syndromic management of hospitalized patients in resource\u2010limited settings comes from the WHO Integrated Management for Childhood Illness (IMCI) program. IMCI guidelines were developed using existing clinical evidence and expert opinion to standardize healthcare provider training and care delivery in resource\u2010limited settings.49 The IMCI guidelines are designed to identify children in need of care by presenting signs and symptoms, and they do not require diagnostic tests that are likely unavailable in most austere settings. Studies evaluating training and implementation of IMCI guidelines have shown a substantial impact on improved management and survival related to childhood pneumonia and other common illnesses.50, 51, 52, 53, 54 For example, a cluster randomized trial in Kenya evaluating the efficacy of a multi\u2010faceted quality improvement intervention for the management of severely ill children resulted in improved quality of clinical care when compared with a less comprehensive approach.50 Similarly, in a pediatric outpatient and emergency unit in Malawi, directed trainings based on IMCI to improve triage and emergency care resulted in streamlined healthcare delivery and a 10% decrease in pediatric in\u2010hospital mortality.51 Modifications of IMCI have also been shown to improve pneumonia outcomes when implemented in the community setting.55, 56, 57 Moreover, economic analyses have found IMCI protocolized care to be cost effective and comparable to preventive interventions such as routine childhood pneumococcal conjugate immunization.58 It is important to highlight that clinical management guidelines may have only modest effects on important outcomes in resource\u2010limited settings for several reasons, including an incomplete evidence base and numerous challenges to implementation.59 Further, some studies have shown limited or no effects of knowledge translation activities, such as clinical guideline implementation.60, 61 Nevertheless, even modest treatment effects on a high burden disease can have a massive impact when widely implemented. The IMCI experience demonstrates the potential benefits of syndromic management for persons with severe respiratory infections in resource\u2010limited settings.",

From the few surveys of ICU resources in resource\u2010limited settings, data suggest that many hospitals are ill equipped to dedicate sufficient personnel and supplies required by patients with severe illness.69, 70, 71, 72 Alarming shortages of reliable electricity, clean water, and supplemental oxygen have been reported from hospitals in sub\u2010Saharan Africa and Southeast Asia.73, 74 Developing country health systems may be weak and hospital support from government ministries is often lacking.67 Thus, strategies to improve care delivery in low\u2010 and middle\u2010income countries must address challenges of improving access to care, training and retention of healthcare providers, supply chain management, and strengthening healthcare systems.42 Any new healthcare intervention designed to improve management of severe influenza disease must be integrated into the current health system structure and strengthen healthcare delivery overall if it is to be successfully adopted and remain sustainable.",

Several recent global initiatives have developed guidelines for the syndromic management of severe influenza and other severe illness in resource\u2010limited settings. During the H1N1 influenza pandemic, the WHO assembled a group of experts to generate a document addressing management of severe respiratory distress and shock in resource\u2010limited settings.76 More recently, similar advice was produced by the WHO for the clinical management of novel coronavirus from outbreaks in 2012 in the Middle East (publication pending). The WHO Integrated Management of Adult and Adolescent Illness (IMAI) program, a sister initiative to IMCI, created a comprehensive manual for the care of hospitalized patients by clinicians in district hospitals that includes sections on severe illness management.77 The European Society of Intensive Care Medicine also recently produced sepsis management guidelines targeted to resource\u2010limited settings.78 These largely expert opinion\u2010based documents fill major gaps in management guidelines but require quality clinical research to provide missing evidence and refine best\u2010practice recommendations. A reminder of the importance of evidence generated by studies in at\u2010risk populations was provided by the unexpectedly harmful effect of fluid boluses for Kenyan children with severe infection in the FEAST (fluid expansion as supportive therapy) trial.59\n",

While several recent initiatives now provide long awaited guidance for clinicians in resource\u2010limited settings, a sustainable, global impact on outcomes due to severe influenza and other severe illness will require an ongoing and concerted international effort to implement, evaluate, and refine these guidelines.",
