Hepatitis A represents worldwide around 50% of the total hepatitis cases and although is self-limiting and rarely causing death may incapacitate patients for several months. The causative agent is the hepatitis A virus that has been linked to several waterborne outbreaks [13\u2022]. Hepatitis E, although less frequent than hepatitis A, has a higher mortality rate, particularly in pregnant women. It is the most important or the second most important cause of acute clinical hepatitis in adults throughout Asia, the Middle East and Africa. By contrast, hepatitis E is rare in industrialised countries, but antibody (anti-HEV) is found worldwide. Hepatitis E is principally the result of a waterborne infection in developing countries and is thought to be spread zoonotically (principally from swine) in industrialised countries [14\u2022].",

One example of an emerging disease is the severe acute respiratory syndrome or SARS, reported in November 2002. Although several coronaviruses are known to be spread by the faecal\u2013oral route, there is no current evidence that this mode of transmission plays a key role in the transmission of SARS in spite of the considerable shedding of the virus in stools [15]. Another important zoonotical issue is the case of influenza viruses. Despite human influenza viruses replicate primarily in the respiratory tract, avian influenza viruses, such as the highly pathogenic H5N1, cause generalised infection in birds with replication in the gastrointestinal duct and virus shedding in faeces. However, their potential waterborne transmission remains controversial [16\u2022\u2022, 17\u2022\u2022].",

This is particularly important when molecular micro-methods are applied. Methods for virus concentration from water samples are depicted in Table 2\nand reviewed elsewhere [22\u2022]. A good concentration method should fulfil several requirements: it should be technically simple, fast, provide high virus recoveries, be adequate for a wide range of enteric viruses, provide a small volume of concentrate, and be inexpensive. No single method meets all these requests. Criteria based on the experience and expertise of the user on a given method should be employed to select the most appropriate system. Positively charged filters [23] and glass wool [24] based methods are still among the best possibilities. Sampling large volumes requires a two-step concentration procedure, with polyethylene glycol precipitation [25] and ultrafiltration [26] as preferred procedures for reconcentration of the primary eluates. Additionally, PEG [25] as well as lyophilisation [3] may be used for direct virus concentration in heavily polluted medium size samples, for example, sewage, having this latter method the added advantage of removing substances inhibitory to RT-PCR enzymes if this method is employed for virus detection [27].",

While for the quantification of RNA viruses in clinical samples the use of an internal control based on the detection of the expression of a housekeeping gene is a clear first choice, this is obviously not valid for water samples leading to compromise in the use of an external control. The best candidate for this latter purpose is the use of an encapsidated RNA, such as RNA animal viruses, RNA bacteriophages or armoured RNAs that are pseudoparticles made of target RNAs packaged into MS2 coliphage coat protein [7\u2022\u2022, 43]. However, it is best to avoid the use of viruses that might be present as contaminants in the assayed samples, thus ruling out the use of coliphages or human enteric viruses. The control of a RT-PCR reaction should rely on a ssRNA molecule as similar as possible to the viral target and amplifiable with the same pair of primers under exactly the same conditions and with the same efficiency [7\u2022\u2022, 44\u2022, 45]. Raw values of genome copies must then be adjusted accordingly to the figured efficiencies for better accuracy of the virus titre.
