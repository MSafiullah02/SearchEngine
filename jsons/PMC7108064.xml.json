            "text": "On June 2015, MERS-CoV infection was confirmed in a healthcare provider (HCP) without symptoms of MERS at a university hospital, where MERS-CoV infected patients were hospitalized. A nurse was isolated for 2 weeks after contacting the hemodialysis patient with confirmed MERS without proper personal protective equipment (PPE). After the isolation, real-time reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) for MERS-CoV was done for surveillance prior to returning to work. The result of RT-PCR test reported after 36 hours was positive, but she had no symptoms. During the 36 hours, she continued her work and might have inadvertently exposed coworkers to MERS-CoV. But until PCR result was available, she did not contact the patients. All the HCPs that had contact with the asymptomatic MERS-CoV positive nurse without proper PPE were isolated at home for 2 weeks, and their contact was graded according to timing and closeness of the contact [4]. A grade 1 contact meant that the person contacted the index patient directly or stayed within 2 meters from the index patient and without having personal protective equipment. A grade 2 contact was for the person staying in the same space of 2 meters or more, separated from index patient, but without personal protective equipment. A grade 3 contact had the person staying in the same space of the index patient at different times without personal protective equipment, and possibly contacting the patient indirectly. The symptoms of these persons were monitored by daily telephone.",
