However, ideal data are typically not available; rather there will be an absence of high-resolution epidemiological datasets needed to characterize transmission pathways in key settings, e.g., transmission trees in hospitals, schools, households [2, 3] ). The force of infection in mathematical transmission models is typically estimated using time-series data that describe epidemic growth as a function of time (e.g., [4] [5] [6] [7] [8] [9] ). In fact, during the 2003 SARS (Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome) threat, the 2009 A/H1N1 influenza pandemic, and the 2013-15 Ebola epidemic in West Africa, aggregated case series at the national or district level were the primary sources of data available for model calibration (e.g. [10] [11] [12] [13] ). A better understanding of observed epidemic growth patterns across different pathogens and across temporal and social contexts could prove useful to improve our ability to design disease transmission models, including the important task of forecasting the likely final size of the epidemic (morbidity, mortality impact), as well as to assess the effects of control interventions.",

We illustrate our method using a diverse set of historic and contemporary outbreaks of acute viral and bacterial pathogens, including the recent West African Ebola virus epidemic, focusing on local outbreaks.

This framework could also be useful to assess shifts in epidemic growth patterns resulting from mitigation during an outbreak, as a consequence of population behavior changes or public health control interventions that affect transmission (e.g., increased bed capacity, school closings). We illustrate the approach through simulations and applications to various empirical infectious disease datasets representing directly and sexually transmitted viral pathogens, including Ebola, pandemic influenza, smallpox, plague, measles, foot-andmouth disease, and HIV/AIDS. Our findings indicate significant variability in epidemic growth patterns across pathogens and geographic settings (Table 1 ) and demonstrate high sensitivity of epidemic size estimates to small variations in the \"deceleration\" parameter of our generalized-growth model.",

For instance, the logistic growth model provides a statistical description of a single-outbreak trajectory, inspired from population biology. This model relies on two parameters and follows the equation C'(t) = r C(t) [1-C(t)/K] where C'(t) describes case incidence over time , \"r\" is the intrinsic growth rate ( per unit of time), and K is the expected final epidemic size (total no. of cases). This model assumes an initial exponential growth phase that saturates as the number of cases accumulate, a pattern that implicitly captures a gradual decrease in the at-risk susceptible population owing to behavior changes (e.g., campaigns to educate the population on how to avoid contracting the disease) and/or control interventions (e.g., increasing rate of diagnosis and isolation of infectious individuals). However, epidemic models that assume initial exponential growth dynamics are incompatible for forecasting outbreaks characterized by sub-exponential growth dynamics particularly when the \"deceleration of growth\" parameter is substantially lower than 1.0.",

Various sources of error could confound the reported epidemic growth patterns during the early epidemic phase. For instance, it is well recognized that infectious-disease incidence patterns are prone to underreporting owing to multiple factors including the fact that epidemiological surveillance systems tend to capture more severe cases and often miss asymptomatic or mild cases. Nevertheless, as long as underreporting remains more or less the same (as a constant proportion of true infections), it should be possible to estimate the correct parameters.",

We find evidence for subexponential growth patterns in the majority of the 20 outbreaks we studied, representing both established and emerging viral pathogens with a particular focus on Ebola. We hypothesize that sub-exponential growth may result from highly constrained population contact structures, population immunity, or the early onset of behavior changes or control interventions. Our approach could prove useful to systematically characterize spatial heterogeneity arising from infectious disease spread in specific contact structures, assess shifts in epidemic growth patterns, refine mathematical transmission models, and improve disease forecasting.",

Estimates of p ranged from 0.14 for the Ebola outbreak in Bomi, Liberia (2014), reflecting a slow epidemic growth pattern, to 0.85 for a major plague epidemic in Bombay (1905), 0.95 for the smallpox outbreak in Khulna (1972), and 0.98 for pandemic influenza in San Francisco (1918), consistent with near-exponential growth dynamics (Figure 4-5). The foot-and-mouth disease outbreak in Uruguay at the farm level displayed a low mean estimate of p at 0.4, characterizing a profile of slower growth (Figure 6 and Figure 1). We found evidence for sub-exponential growth in annual incidence data on the HIV/AIDS epidemic in Japan (1985-2012) and New York City (1982-2002), a disease that is largely spread through sexual contact via bodily fluids. The mean estimate of the deceleration parameter p for time series of new HIV/AIDS cases in Japan was estimated at about 0.5 which is consistent with an approximately linear growth pattern (Figure 7) whereas the AIDS case reports in New York City showed slightly faster growth pattern with mean p estimated at 0.57. The wealth of Ebola data available at the district level for the 2013-15 epidemic in West Africa provides a good opportunity to gauge variations in the growth profile of a given pathogen over space. Estimates of p across local Ebola outbreaks varied substantially (mean=0.59, range: 0.14-0.97). The districts of Margibi in Liberia, and Bombali and Bo in Sierra Leone, displayed near exponential growth (p close to 1), while the districts of Bomi in Liberia and Kenema in Sierra Leone displayed particularly slow growth (p near 0.1) (Figure 3). Of particular interest is the shape of the epidemic in the district where the 2013-15 Ebola epidemic is assumed to have originated, in Gueckedou, Guinea. We estimate an intermediate pattern of growth there, albeit with wide uncertainty (p=0.71 95% CI: 0.31, 1.0). Further, Montserrado, the Liberian capital, displayed moderate values of p (0.60 95% CI: 0.46, 0.77) (Figure 8), which is in close agreement with those of Western Area Urban and Western Area Rural in Sierra Leone with mean p at 0.46-0.68 (",

Faithfully capturing the baseline transmission pattern of an unfolding infectious disease outbreak is needed to prospectively quantify the effect of control measures. In particular, different epidemic growth patterns could support different intervention strategies.Perhaps it is not surprising that the daily growth phase of the 1918 influenza pandemic in San Francisco and the weekly growth phase of the bubonic plague epidemic in Bombay in 1905 are close to exponential during several early generations of the disease, consistent",
