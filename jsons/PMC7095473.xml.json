            "text": "Evidence-based clinical guidelines recommend influenza testing in all hospitalized and critically ill patients with acute respiratory illness, including pneumonia (with or without fever) and acute worsening of chronic cardiopulmonary diseases, during periods of influenza activity [2\u20136]. At other time periods, testing is recommended in hospitalized patients with epidemiologic links (e.g., household/institutional contacts, travel history); however, since inter-seasonal outbreaks and sporadic infections also occur, testing in all critically ill patients with acute respiratory illness is advisable in clinical practice. Testing should be considered regardless of time from illness onset, time from hospital admission (i.e., nosocomial infections), host immune status, and vaccination history, because studies have shown that substantial proportions of hospitalized influenza patients (10\u201340%) are seasonal vaccine recipients [6\u20138]. Clinicians should be aware that testing should be performed as early as possible, as timing may have an impact both on test sensitivity (the viral load decreases over time, though prolonged shedding is expected in critically ill patients) and on clinical decision-making, including continuation/discontinuation of antiviral treatment, indication of additional testing and imaging studies, infection control measures, and clinical outcomes [9, 10]. Delayed diagnosis has been associated with higher risks of respiratory and renal failure as well as increased mortality [11].",

            "text": "The virological methods used to diagnose influenza infection have been reviewed in detail elsewhere [9]. Briefly and from a practical perspective, molecular (polymerase chain reaction, PCR) assays are regarded as the gold-standard for diagnosis; antigen-based assays are limited by their low sensitivity (40\u201370%, meaning that a negative test result does not rule out diagnosis; specificity 90\u201395%) [10, 12], and culture and serology are too slow or are retrospective, thus unhelpful in guiding clinical care (though useful in resistance testing and surveillance). Recently, the US Food and Drug Administration (FAD) demoted rapid influenza virus antigen detection test systems from class I to class II, owing to their poor diagnostic performance [13, 14]. The newer digital Immunoassays show improved sensitivity, though they remain less sensitive than molecular tests [12, 14]. Depending on the type of assay, PCR can detect all influenza A subtypes and B lineages with primers that target the conserved regions (e.g., M, NS), or individual HA subtypes using specific primers (e.g., H1, H3, H5, H7). Subtyping information may have implications for treatment (e.g., prepandemic H1N1 is oseltamivir-resistant) and may identify possible novel or avian strains (e.g., H1N1pdm09 and H7N9 were initially \u201cuntypeable\u201d using existing primers) [9]. Since clinical manifestations of influenza are indistinguishable from infections cause by other respiratory pathogens, multiplex PCR platforms that detect a range of common viruses [e.g., influenza and subtypes, respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), parainfluenza virus, rhinovirus] and \u2018atypical pathogens\u2019 (e.g., mycoplasma, chlamydophila, legionella) are increasingly being used in the clinical setting to guide management and infection control [9, 14]. The \u2018turn-around-time\u2019 of these assays varies depending on logistics and workflow [15].",

A randomized controlled trial reported fewer in-hospital antibiotic prescriptions or earlier termination with rapid virological diagnosis [20]. However, the clinical impact and cost-effectiveness of these methods deserve further evaluation [18, 21]. Even using PCR, negative results may occur with nasopharyngeal samples in the case of influenza pneumonia due to differential viral kinetic changes along the respiratory tract (\u2248 10%) [6, 9, 10, 22]. In mechanically ventilated patients, lower respiratory tract samples (e.g., endotracheal aspirates or bronchoscopy specimens) should be collected, since the viral load is typically higher and shedding more prolonged than in the upper airways [6, 22, 23]. In patients who fail to respond or worsen with antiviral treatment especially individuals who have been exposed to antivirals or who are immunocompromised, resistance should be suspected [24]. In these cases, both phenotypic and genotypic resistance assays may be necessary (using baseline and subsequent samples), and consultation with an expert is advisable.",

High C-reactive protein (CRP) levels have been reported in critically ill influenza patients with H1N1 infections, including those with bacterial coinfections, but its discriminatory value is doubtful [28, 29]. Low serum procalcitonin (PCT) levels may be helpful in ruling out bacterial coinfection and may allow earlier antibiotic discontinuation [30\u201334]. In critically ill patients, higher PCT stopping thresholds may be more appropriate (0.5 ng/mL) [35]. Recent research on host response signatures (e.g., transcriptomic profiling) to predict influenza disease progression or to assist differentiation between viral, bacterial, or viral\u2013bacterial coinfections have shown promising results [9, 36\u201340]. The role of immune testing including blood transcriptomic studies [41], while still in its infancy, will be probably relevant for the critical care physician in the forthcoming years. Elucidating the complex interactions of interferons, inflammatory cytokines, neutrophils, and complement/coagulation pathways in severe influenza could inform novel approaches for diagnosis and therapy [42].",

In specific populations such as patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and immunosuppressed patients, corticosteroids also increase mortality. The most compelling evidence comes from a recent systematic review and meta-analysis published in 2019, including 10 studies and 6548 patients; there, corticosteroids were associated with higher mortality, longer ICU stay and higher rates of secondary infections but not days on mechanical ventilation [55]. In patients with concomitant bacterial infection the usefulness of corticosteroids has not been demonstrated [as it has in non-influenza-severe community-acquired pneumonia (CAP)]. Finally, it is not known whether the administration of corticosteroids in acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) after several days of antivirals and with a negative viral test is beneficial or harmful.",

The main individual risk factors were old age and immunosuppression (HIV and medications). Importantly, coinfection was associated with longer ICU stay, and higher 28 days and in-hospital mortality. The main microorganisms found were Streptococcus pneumoniae, Enterobacteriaceae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, methicillin-sensitive plus methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus and Haemphilus. Legionella and atypical agents were also detected. Aspergillus spp. was isolated in a few cases. In a more recent multicenter study of immunosuppressed patients [57], not including HIV, coinfection was not associated with higher mortality than in non-immunosuppressed patients. In the propensity matching analysis, influenza was not associated with mortality in this immunosuppressed population. Coinfection in severe influenza increases mortality in non-immunosuppressed patients but not in their immunosuppressed peers. Aspergillus spp. may coinfect patients with influenza; in fact, in a recent study including seven influenza seasons in non-immunosuppressed patients, influenza pneumonia was a risk factor for invasive aspergillosis. Mortality in patients with aspergillosis was twofold higher than that recorded in patients without this condition [58].",

Many studies have failed to demonstrate a beneficial effect of NIV in severe CAP with hypoxemia; the evidence of its value in influenza is slim but it is still widely used [62]. A recent clinical review stated that NIV has no role in severe respiratory failure and in ARDS related to severe pH1N1 infection, and that transmission to healthcare professionals due to aerosol generation is an additional concern [63]. To date, no RCTs have assessed the use of NIV in influenza; the evidence comes from observational studies. One of the largest conducted so far is a multicenter study involving almost 2000 patients which assessed the usefulness of NIV in patients with acute respiratory failure due to influenza admitted to 148 ICUs using a decision tree analysis [64]. The major findings of the study were: NIV failure was frequent in patients with influenza infection, since one in two patients who initially received NIV eventually failed; ICU mortality was significantly higher in subjects with NIV failure (38.4% versus 31.3%, P = 0.01) than in those receiving invasive mechanical ventilation; and NIV failure was associated with increased ICU mortality [odds ratio (OR) 11.4, 95% confidence interval (CI) 6.5\u201320.1]. Interestingly, SOFA was helpful for decision-making and that extremely sick patients (SOFA \u2265 5) had a higher risk of NIV failure and are not good candidates for this treatment. Taking into account the current literature, NIV should not be used in patients with influenza infection. Experience with high-flow nasal cannula (HFNC) oxygen therapy in influenza is very limited, and no randomized trials have been published. Probably the recommendation of NIV applies to HFNO to avoid delays in starting invasive mechanical ventilation and is restricted to patients with adequate saturation monitoring in areas under critical care supervision and non-severe hypoxemia needing higher oxygen flow rates.",

Mechanical ventilation asynchronies occur often during invasive mechanical ventilation [69]. Once detected, however, a crucial question is how to improve patient\u2013ventilator interaction. To provide better patient\u2013ventilator synchrony, two straightforward approaches should be considered. The first is the optimization of the patient/ventilator adaptation by increasing sedation/analgesia with or without a neuromuscular non-depolarizing agent and with ventilator adjustment or change in ventilator mode [70]. Questions about the use of muscle paralysis were raised after the recent publication of the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute PETAL Clinical Trials Network which showed no benefit in mortality in moderate-to-severe ARDS patients treated with early and continuous cisatracurium infusion [71]. The second strategy is prone positioning, which is gaining popularity because of its positive results for survival, benefits in oxygenation and lung recruitment, and the fact that ICU teams have become more familiar with this procedure [72]. We encourage placement of the patient in the prone position as soon as possible if severe hypoxemia occurs (PaO2/FiO2 ratio is below 150 mm Hg), since this strategy can improve oxygenation through several mechanisms, such as better distribution of ventilation, improved V/Q matching, and right ventricle unloading.",

The recent introduction of technological improvements has increased the use of ECMO (e.g., its latest generation oxygenator that optimizes membrane characteristics in favor of optimal gas exchange, the heparin-coated circuit, and the reduced damage to pumps due to magnetic levitation, etc.). ECMO is life-saving in potentially reversible acute respiratory failure associated with severe influenza A (H1N1) pneumonia that is not responsive to conventional therapies and has been extensively used for severe influenza; however, it remains a very costly, high resourced-intensive therapy, with a mortality rate that remains high. It has been applied all over the world in patients with severe hypoxemia and influenza, but its use has been very heterogeneous. In 2013, a meta-analysis with a limited number of 266 patients receiving ECMO for a median of 10 days found that mortality (mean mortality of 28%) varied widely (8% to 65%) depending on baseline patient features [73]. More recently, in another systematic review and meta-analysis of 13 studies with a total of 494 patients receiving ECMO for severe influenza infection with respiratory failure, overall mortality (37.1%) was much higher than years before, and duration of pre-ECMO mechanical ventilation (in days) was the only statistically significant moderator of mortality identified [74]. Therefore, our recommendation would be that ECMO seems to be a feasible rescue therapy, which needs to be started soon after detecting refractory hypoxemia that does not respond to conventional therapies such as prone positioning. Accurate patient selection at baseline seems to be the most important factor for starting ECMO.",

Aerosol-generating procedures include endotracheal intubation, bronchoscopy, sputum induction, cardiopulmonary resuscitation, and open suctioning of airways [75].",

Isolation precautions for immune competent hospitalized patients should be continued for 7 days after illness onset or until 24 h after the resolution of fever and respiratory symptoms, whichever is longer [75, 77, 78]. Immune suppressed patients may continue to shed virus for prolonged periods of time despite minimal symptoms, often leading to continued infection control measures [75, 78]. Repeat sampling for influenza virus may be necessary in these patients to demonstrate viral clearance prior to discontinuation of isolation [78]; however, local infection prevention and control policies should be followed [77]. In addition, fit-tested N95 masks and airborne precautions for aerosol-generating procedures should be taken. General guidance is until symptoms resolve and longer if immunosuppressed.",
