            "text": "On 20 January, Chinese health authorities announced the human-to-human transmission of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). The number of cases of COVID-19 outside China started to rapidly increase on February 20, with Italy, South Korea and Iran reporting new infections, and the rapid spread in European countries in March ([1]). As COVID-19 spreads around the world, the general population seek information on methods of protecting themselves. This concern and health literacy could be reflected in Google searches. Google searches for flu symptoms have been found as good indicators of influenza outbreaks, and have been applied to estimate national and regional influenza incidence (Ginsberg et al., 2009 Feb 19). Google search trends were also used to predict the national COVID-19 outbreak in China (Li et al., 2020), Iran (Ayyoubzadeh et al., 2020) and Taiwan (Husnayain et al., 2020). In addition to infectious diseases, Google searches have been used to reflect population mental status and behaviors such as major depression (Yang et al., 2010 Oct 28) and suicide (Solano et al., 2016 Dec). This study hypothesized that the search behaviors on health literacy might reflect the spreading speed among different countries. More specifically, we aimed to examine whether google searches for \u201cwash hands\u201d and \u201cface masks\u201d would protect from increased numbers of confirmed cases of COVID-19 among 21 countries.",

We used Google Trends (Trend, 2020) to target two keywords \u201cwash hands\u201d and \u201cface mask\u201d among the 21 countries with differing rates of COVID-19 spread during February 19 to March 10. We confirmed the translation of these two keywords by using both the translation from Chinese and English, with back-translation on Google Translate (https://translate.google.com/), and to examine whether these keyword searches had the most increase in the latest 30 days on Google Trends (Supplement Table S1).",

Another keyword \u201cwash hands\u201d, which is more important and relevant to COVID-19 spread, also increased but not in the magnitude of increase of the search for \u201cface mask\u201d. Google search for \u201cwash hands\u201d indicated not only the promotion of hand hygiene awareness but might also reflect the extent that people proactively engaged in hand washing. The related queries for \u201cwash hands\u201d on Google Trends among the 21 countries included hand sanitizer brands, hand washing steps, and information regarding COVID-19. The increased internet search queries indicated the more people proactively engaged in hand hygiene, which may have had an effect on reducing the speed of COVID-19 outbreak during the following three weeks. Since approximately 19% of the world population washes hands with soap after contact with excreta (Freeman et al., 2014), and environmental contamination by patients with COVID-19 through respiratory droplets and fecal shedding (Ong et al., 2020) suggests the need for strict adherence to hand hygiene.",

Although current available research supports the possibility that severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) could be spreads via bioaerosols generated directly by patients\u2019 exhalation, face masks seem to be ineffective in preventing the dissemination of SARS\u2013CoV-2 from the coughs of patients with COVID-19 to the environment (Bae et al.,). These findings were consistent with our results that hand hygiene is a more effective strategy than wearing a face mask. In addition, the Google searches for \u201cface mask\u201d and \u201cwash hands\u201d would correspond to different implications. The increased search for \u201cface mask\u201d might indicate the increased numbers of people wearing face masks, but also might result from the short supply of face masks in the corresponding country, which would indicate few people were wearing face masks. However, the increased google searches for \u201cwash hands\u201d would simply indicate people engaged more in hand hygiene. In summary, our findings support the experts\u2019 suggestion that even if wearing a face mask is indicated, it is still important to wash hands with soap and water for at least 20 seconds prior to putting on the face mask (Desai et al., 2020), and repeating hand hygiene after touching the outer surface of masks (Bae et al.,).",
