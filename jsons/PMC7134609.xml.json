A total of 48 genes were extracted from the above six genomes and used to train the gene-finding algorithm. Currently, 15 genome sequences of SARS coronavirus (SARS-CoV) strains are available in the GenBank database, of which there are 11 complete and four partial genomes, respectively. The former includes SARS-CoV TOR2 (Accession No. AY274119), Urbani (AY278741), HKU-39849 (AY278491), CUHK-W1 (AY278554), BJ01 (AY278488), CUHK-Su10 (AY282752), SIN2500 (AY283794), SIN2748 (AY283797), SIN2679 (AY283796), SIN2774 (AY283798), and SIN2677 (AY283795), whereas the latter includes SARS-CoV BJ02 (AY278487), BJ03 (AY278490), BJ04 (AY279354), and GZ01 (AY278489), respectively.",

The Z curve method has been used to recognize protein coding genes in the budding yeast genome [14]. A new ab initio gene-finding system for bacterial and archaeal genomes has been developed recently, based on the Z curve method [12]. Here the method with some modifications is used to recognize protein coding genes in coronavirus genomes, which is presented briefly as follows. Suppose that the occurrence frequencies of the bases A, C, G, and T (U) at the first, second, and third codon positions in an ORF are denoted by ai, ci, gi, and t\ni, respectively, where i=1,2,3. The four numbers, ai, ci, gi, and t\ni, are mapped onto a point in a 3-dimensional space Vi with the coordinates(1)xi=(ai+gi)\u2212(ci+ti),yi=(ai+ci)\u2212(gi+ti), i=1,2,3,zi=(ai+ti)\u2212(gi+ci).Then, each ORF may be represented by a point or a vector in a 9-dimensional space V, where V=V1\u2295V2\u2295V3, where the symbol \u2295 denotes the direct-sum of two subspaces. The nine components u\n1\u2013u\n9 of the space V are defined as follows:(2)u1=x1, u2=y1, u3=z1,u4=x2, u5=y2, u6=z2,u7=x3, u8=y3, u9=z3.\n",

            "text": "To train the system, two sets of samples are needed, which are positive samples corresponding to protein-coding genes (seed ORFs) and negative samples corresponding to non-coding sequences. In the Z curve method, essentially, the gene recognition is based on the compositional asymmetry of three codon positions in coding sequences. It was shown that the overall extent of codon usage bias in RNA viruses is low and there is little variation in bias between genes [15]. Coronaviruses belong to the coronaviridae and the G + C content of the published coronavirus genomes ranges from 37% to 42% [7]. Therefore, it is reasonable to deduce that the published coronavirus genomes have similar codon usage. Based on this consideration, it is possible that gene-finding parameters derived from some published coronavirus genomes may be applied to recognize genes in other coronavirus genomes. Because the SARS-CoV genomes are relatively small (\u224830 kb), it is difficult to obtain enough seed ORFs from its own genome. Therefore, we used some other published coronavirus genomes to train gene-finding parameters. Consequently, the genomes of avian infectious bronchitis virus, bovine coronavirus, human coronavirus 229E, murine hepatitis virus, porcine epidemic diarrhea virus, and transmissible gastroenteritis virus, respectively, were used, in which 48 seed ORFs were selected. The detailed information about the 48 seed ORFs is described in Table 1 of the supplementary materials (see: http://tubic.tju.edu.cn/sars/).",

It is a rather difficult problem to produce an appropriate set of non-coding sequences in coronavirus genomes, because the amount of non-coding DNA sequences in these genomes is too few to be used. A method to produce negative samples has been developed previously and it has been shown to be an effective way to solve the problem [12]. The same method is still used in the current study. In this method, a negative sample is just derived from a seed ORF. Generally speaking, if the regular structure of a coding sequence is completely destroyed, it is transformed into a non-coding one. Therefore, the negative sample may be simply obtained by shuffling the corresponding coding sequence sufficiently (20,000 times in current study). The resulting random sequences from all 48 seed ORFs were used as non-coding sequences. The major difference is that the former has some regular structures, whereas the latter is a random sequence. In fact, a random sequence is not a non-coding sequence, but it is a good approximation. As shown below, this approximation generally results in good gene-finding results.",

For more details about Fisher discrminant algorithm, refer to, for example [14]. Based on the data in the training set (including the positive and negative samples), the vector c and the threshold c\n0 are obtained. The decision of coding/non-coding for each ORF and negative sample is simply made by the criterion of c\u00b7u>c0/c\u00b7u<c0, where c=(c1,c2,\u2026,c9)T, u=(u1,u2,\u2026,u9)T, and \u201cT\u201d indicates the transpose of a matrix. The criterion of c\u00b7u>c0/c\u00b7u<c0 for making the decision of coding/non-coding can be rewritten as Z(u)>0/Z(u)<0, where Z(u)=c\u00b7u\u2212c0. Z(u) is called the Z score or Z index for an ORF or a fragment of DNA sequence. Finally, the strategy to deal with overlapping ORFs used here is similar to that described in the previous paper [12].",

It can be seen that the predicted \u2018gene 1\u2019 is questionable, because of its short length and the lack of a start codon. An important structural protein gene (small envelope protein E), which is located from 26117 to 26347, was not predicted by GeneMark.hmm. Moreover, we submitted the same genome sequence several times to the website, however, the prediction results were not identical at all times, indicating that the system is unstable. An important structural protein gene (N protein), which is located from 28120 to 29388, was predicted as \u2018gene 10\u2019 and \u2018gene 11\u2019 (marked with * in Table 1) in some predicted results. Sometimes, \u2018gene 9\u2019 (marked with * in Table 1), a quite conserved ORF in all of the 11 SARS-CoV genomes mentioned above, was not predicted.

To save space, the detailed results are listed in Table 3 of the supplementary materials (see also the discussion below). In addition to the polyprotein chain ORFs 1a and 1b, the program predicts four structural genes coding for the four major structural proteins, i.e., spike (S), small envelop (E), membrane (M), and nuleocaspid (N), respectively, in all the 11 SARS-CoV genomes.

            "text": "To compare the gene-finding result of the system ZCURVE_CoV 1.0 with that of known annotation, the SARS-CoV TOR2 strain is used as an example. The genome of TOR2 strain was annotated manually [8] and the annotated result is listed on the left part of Table 2\n, whereas the annotated result of ZCURVE_CoV 1.0 is listed on the right part of Table 2. As we can see both annotations are in good agreement with each other, except three ORFs. The three ORFs, i.e., ORF4, ORF13, and ORF14 annotated by Marra et al. [8] are not predicted by ZCURVE_CoV 1.0. These ORFs are completely embedded, with a frameshift, within the genes coding for some structural proteins. The absence of the transcription regulating sequences (TRSs) at the 5\u2032 end of these ORFs [8] suggests that they are unlikely to be the protein-coding genes. The principal component analysis performed below further confirms the above conjecture. As mentioned in the Materials and methods section, each ORF is represented by a point in a 9-dimensional (9-D) space. Consequently, the positive samples (genes) and negative samples (non-coding sequences) are represented by two groups of points in the 9-D space, respectively. For the TOR2 strain, the 12 putative genes predicted by ZCURVE_CoV and ORF 4, ORF 13, and ORF 14 are represented by the corresponding points in the 9-D space, respectively. We project the points in the 9-D space onto the 3-D space spanned by the first, second, and third principal axes based on the principal component analysis. The fraction of the first three principal components accounts for about 70% of the total inertia of the 9-D space. Fig. 1\nshows the distribution of the corresponding points in the 3-D space, where green and orange balls represent the positive samples (genes) and negative samples (non-coding sequences), respectively. Blue balls correspond to the genes predicted by ZCURVE_CoV for the TOR2 strain, while red balls correspond to ORF 4, ORF 13, and ORF 14 annotated by Marra et al. [8]. It is clear that the three red balls are located at the side of non-coding sequences, indicating that ORF 4, ORF 13, and ORF 14 are very unlikely to code for proteins.",

The results of multiple sequence alignment for the above six predicted genes coding for non-structural proteins are listed in Fig. 1 of the supplementary materials. For the three ORFs, Sars122, Sars44, and Sars84, the nucleotide sequences are all conserved in the 11 SARS-CoV genomes, indicating that the three ORFs might have crucial biological functions. Mutations in these gene sequences would result in loss of important functions. Therefore, these coding sequences might serve as the candidate targets for designing drugs against SARS. On the contrary, Sars39 is not found in the strains SIN2677 and SIN2748, and a nucleotide mutation occurs at nucleotide position 49, leading to the mutation of Cys \u2192 Arg in the strains BJ01 and CUHK-W1. The rapid mutations occurring in Sars39 imply that it is probably not a key protein for SARS-CoV. For Sars63, two nucleotide mutations are observed at the base positions 38 and 170, leading to amino acid mutations of Glu \u2192 Gly and Pro \u2192 Leu in the strains SIN2677 and BJ01, respectively. See Fig. 1 in the supplementary materials for the detail.",

Four nucleotide mutations, located at 31, 302, 406, and 783, respectively, at three different strains have been detected. The first three variations cause amino acid mutations (Fig. 2). The last substitution is a synonymous codon mutation which does not lead to amino acid change. The point mutations occurring at nucleotide positions 31, 302, and 406, respectively, cause amino acid changes. At the 31st position, G \u2192 A (TOR2) \u21d2 Gly \u2192 Arg. Similarly, at the 302nd position, T (U) \u2192 A (HKU-39849) \u21d2 Met \u2192 Lys; and at the 406th position, A \u2192 C (BJ01) \u21d2 Lys \u2192 Gln. On the other hand, it was reported by Marra et al. [8] that there exist three trans-membrane regions spanning approximately at nucleotide positions 102 \u2192 168 (residues 34 \u2192 56), 231 \u2192 297 (77 \u2192 99), and 309 \u2192 375 (103 \u2192 115), respectively, in Sars274 sequence. Therefore, the mutations occur outside of the predicted trans-membrane regions. Note that the second mutation of amino acid (Met \u2192 Lys) is essential, as reflected by the fact that Met is a relatively strong hydrophilic amino acid, whereas Lys is a strong hydrophobic one. At present, we cannot know whether these mutations cause severe conformational changes in the tertiary structure of this putative protein. The high mutation rate of Sars274 implies that either it might be a relatively unimportant protein for SARS-CoV, or the mutations do not lead to biological function changes dramatically. Finally, for the time being we still cannot rule out the possibility that all or a part of these mutations are caused by sequencing errors.",

Accumulating evidence has shown that SARS is caused by a new coronavirus, i.e., SARS-CoV. A new system to recognize protein-coding genes in SARS-CoV genomes, called ZCURVE_CoV, has been reported in this paper. By applying the program to 11 complete SARS-CoV genomes, six genomes not annotated previously have been annotated, and some problems of previous annotations in the remaining five genomes have been pointed out and discussed. It is shown that the three protein-coding ORFs annotated by Marra et al. [8], i.e., ORF 4, ORF 13, and ORF 14, are very unlikely to code for proteins. In addition to ORF1a, ORF1b, and the four genes coding for the major structural proteins S, E, M, and N, the new system ZCURVE_CoV also predicts 5\u20136 putative genes coding for non-structural proteins. Aligning each of the non-structural gene sequences based on the 11 complete genomes, some mutations have been detected. The biological implications of the mutations have been discussed.",

To visualize the distribution, the mapping points are projected onto the 3-D space spanned by the first three principal axes based on the principal component analysis. The first, second, and third principal vectors are denoted by the X-, Y-, and Z-axes, respectively. The fraction of the first three principal components accounts for 69.59% of the total inertia of the 9-D space.

Blue balls correspond to the genes predicted by ZCURVE_CoV for the TOR2 strain, while red balls correspond to ORF 4, ORF 13, and ORF 14 annotated by Marra et al. [8].
