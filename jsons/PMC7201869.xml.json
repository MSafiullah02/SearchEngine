After 15 minutes at 60\u00b0C, inactivation of the virus in the PBS, 10 percent BSA, and 16 percent BSA solutions was observed (Fig. 1B). Although the virus in 10 percent BSA appeared to be inactivated in 15 minutes, there was a small, yet detectable amount of virus present in one of the triplicate 25\u2010minute samples (Fig. 1B). This outlier may have arisen due to experimental error or the virus may have aggregated thus making it more resistant to inactivation. By 30 minutes, SARS\u2010CoV was inactivated in the 10 percent BSA solution and was no longer detectable for the duration of the experiment (120 min). Fifteen minutes at 60\u00b0C significantly decreased, to near the limit of detection of the assay, the titer of SARS\u2010CoV in the 25 percent BSA protein solution (Fig. 1B). Unfortunately, at 20 minutes, the 25 percent BSA solutions were denatured and rendered them inappropriate for virus titer testing. These results suggest that SARS\u2010CoV inactivation by pasteurization may be effective; however, the rate of inactivation may be dependent upon protein concentration.",

UVC treatment, however, did not inactivate the virus in BSA protein solutions, and the virus was still infectious even after 60 minutes of treatment (Fig. 2A).

We determined that some inactivation of SARS\u2010CoV occurred in 2 and 5 percent BSA protein solutions but to a lesser extent than when no protein was present (data not shown).

With an immunofluorescent antibody assay, Hsueh and associates\n18\n have detected immunoglobulin (Ig)G seroconversion by Day 10 and IgM and IgA seroconversion on Day 11. Wang and coworkers\n19\n determined that SARS\u2010CoV RNA was detectable by quantitative real\u2010time RT\u2010PCR assay as early as 2 days after onset of SARS symptoms in 50 percent of the patient plasma samples they examined. In 75 percent of SARS patients they found peak viral RNA titers detected at 5 to 7 days after symptom onset. These data do not exclude the possibility that (in the event of an outbreak) SARS may be present in the blood of asymptomatic but infected individuals at undetectable levels. Owing to the possibility for SARS\u2010CoV transmission via plasma\u2010derived components, current viral inactivation methods need to be evaluated for effectiveness against SARS\u2010CoV.",

Neoantigens may be formed from partial denaturation of human serum components that may appear foreign to the immune system.\n20\n This could be deleterious, because it may result in the onset of autoimmune disease. We determined that SARS\u2010CoV was inactivated by pasteurization at 60\u00b0C in less than 1 hour; however, protein concentration affected the time required for inactivation. Previously we examined the ability of heat to inactivate SARS\u2010CoV when in DMEM instead of human serum or BSA solutions. We found that 90 minutes at either 56 or 65\u00b0C was necessary to inactivate the virus.\n6\n Yunoki and associates\n21\n examined the sensitivity of SARS\u2010CoV to 60\u00b0C heat and found that the different protein compositions of the samples tested affected the time necessary, yet all samples were inactivated to the limit of detection by 1 hour. Additionally, Rabenau and coworkers\n22\n tested heat inactivation of SARS\u2010CoV at 56\u00b0C for 30 minutes and determined that the presence of 20 percent fetal calf serum protected the virus. We observed that incubation at 60\u00b0C for 30 minutes, however, was sufficient for complete inactivation to the limit of detection. Given that pasteurization of plasma\u2010derived products is usually performed at 60\u00b0C for 10 hours,\n20\n any SARS\u2010CoV present in such products, regardless of protein concentrations and in the presence of stabilizers, should be efficiently inactivated.",

The authors determined that 3 J per cm2 UVA light for 3 to 4 minutes with the addition of 150 \u00b5mol per L psoralen was sufficient to inactivate human immunodeficiency virus, duck hepatitis B virus (a model for hepatitis B virus), and bovine viral diarrhea virus (a model for hepatitis C virus) and that neither psoralen, nor UVA light alone, was sufficient to inactivate these viruses.

We determined that SARS\u2010CoV was resistant to inactivation by octanoic acid treatment, even under the conditions of acidic pH (4.5), elevated temperature (30\u00b0C), a higher concentration (40 mmol/L) of octanoate, and a longer treatment time (24 hr). Based on the work of Lundblad and Seng,\n25\n we exposed both RSV and HSV\u20101 to octanoate as a control. Octanoic acid treatment decreased the titer of RSV, suggesting that our conditions were correct for inactivation. In contrast, Lundblad and Seng\n25\n effectively inactivated HSV\u20101 with octanoic acid at similar conditions, but the octanoic acid was removed with an ion\u2010exchange column, and this may account for differences in the end result.
