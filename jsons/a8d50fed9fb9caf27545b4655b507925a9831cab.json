Numerous reports have demonstrated that an aberrant process of the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway (UPP) regulated by the ubiquitination and deubiquitination systems results in failure of balancing between protein stability and degradation, and this failure can lead to tumorigenesis in various organs and tissues of mammals. The identifi cation of molecular properties for various DUBs is very critical to understand cancer development and tumorigenesis. Therefore, knowledge of DUBs and their association with cancer and diseases is indispensible for developing effective inhibitors for DUBs.

Many studies have analyzed and revealed the roles of proteases, and the research results have been applied to the medical treatment of cancer and diverse diseases. Recent studies have suggested that the human genome encodes a total of 600 proteases [ 1 ] . Human proteases can be divided into fi ve classes according to their catalytic characteristics: serine proteases, threonine proteases, cysteine proteases, aspartate proteases, and metalloproteases. The glutamic proteases are limited to fungal species. Of the 600 proteases, 176 are serine proteases (32 %), 74 are threonine proteases (4 %), 143 are cysteine proteases (26 %), 21 are aspartate proteases (4 %), and 186 are metalloproteases (34 %) according to genomics and bioinformatics research on proteasomes ( Fig. 15.1 ). To the cysteine proteases family, this chapter will focus on cysteine proteases to understand the biological functions of DUBs.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 456, "end": 461, "text": "[ 1 ]", "ref_id": "BIBREF0"}, {"start": 903, "end": 909, "text": "(34 %)", "ref_id": null}], "ref_spans": [{"start": 977, "end": 986, "text": "Fig. 15.1", "ref_id": null}], "section": "Classifi cation of Proteases in Mammals"}, {"text": "DUBs are a subfamily of cysteine proteases and have reversible abilities against E3 ligases, in which they detach ubiquitin molecules from ubiquitinated substrates via their enzymatic activities ( Fig. 15.2 ). This DUB-mediated process, which is the opposite of ubiquitination, is called deubiquitination. Like ubiquitination, deubiquitination can give signals to functional proteins to modulate their activities. Therefore, DUBs are involved in numerous cellular functions including cell cycle regulation, signal transduction, membrane traffi cking, DNA damage response, immune response, and apoptosis or programmed cell death. The major known signal of ubiquitination guides ubiquitinated proteins heading to the 26S proteasome for protein degradation (the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway, UPP), while DUB-mediated deubiquitination can prevent the proteasomal degradation of the substrates. Thus, the orchestration of reversible posttranslational regulations by ubiquitination and deubiquitination affects cellular homeostasis and cell viability, based on not only protein levels, but also on protein functions. It is critical to systemically maintain expression levels and functions of cellular proteins for the healthy cells, tissues, organs, and individuals. Indeed, as we will discuss later in this chapter, the breakdown of coordinated regulation of functional proteins caused by altered activities or abnormal expression level of DUBs can induce severe diseases including cancer. To date, almost 100 human genes encoding DUB enzymes have been identifi ed; these can be grouped into the following fi ve classes according to their properties: ubiquitin-specifi c proteases (USPs), ubiquitin carboxy-terminal hydrolases (UCHs), ovarian-tumor proteases (OTUs), Machado-Joseph diseases (MJDs), and JAB1/ MPN/MOV34 metalloenzymes (JAMMs). This classifi cation can be expanded to six categories, in order to include the recently identifi ed monocyte chemotactic protein-induced protein (MCPIP) [ 2 ] . The DUBs which have been identifi ed so far are listed in Table 15 .1 . Except for JAMMs, which are zinc metalloproteases, all DUBs have conserved domains including Cys, Asp/Asn, and His domains, which are associated with their catalytic activity [ 3 ] .

This is the most reliable way of gaining information about target protein activity, functions, and interaction motifs. The generalization of several 3D structures has emerged from diverse studies in which the molecular key features of DUBs as ubiquitin moieties have been established [ 4 ] . Each DUB subfamily shares similar sequences and structures. The coordinated ubiquitination and deubiquitination of target proteins are mediated by specifi c enzymes. For ubiquitination, successive action of several enzymes is required. For the fi rst step, ubiquitin (Ub), which consists of 76 amino acids, is activated by a ubiquitin-activating enzyme (E1) in an ATP-dependent manner. This is followed by interaction with the ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme (E2). Lastly, the E2-bound ubiquitin is transferred to the E3 ubiquitin ligase. In some cases, E4 enzymes are needed for effi cient ubiquitination. In addition to mono-ubiquitination, additional ubiquitins can be conjugated to the attached ubiquitin to form polyubiquitin chains. In a reversible process, deubiquitinating enzymes (DUBs) detach ubiquitin molecules from ubiquitinated substrates via their enzymatic activities. In this process, ubiquitin chains from proteasome-targeted proteins should be removed, thereby promoting protein degradation and recycling free ubiquitins. Deconjugating ubiquitin in proteasomal processing is mediated by certain DUBs including UCHL5, USP14, and POH1. Through these processes, DUBs generate free ubiquitin molecules, prevent proteasomal degradation of target proteins, and stabilize target proteins In general, most USP family members have six homologue-conserved USP domains and consist of three domains organizing as a palm, a thumb, and fi ngers [ 4 ] . Among them, the fi nger domains interact with ubiquitin. In addition, a number of diverse motifs exist through USPs, and these specifi c domains and structures give unique functions to USPs. USP3, USP5, USP39, USP44, USP45, USP49, and USP51 have the zinc-fi nger USP domain, while the domain present in USP (DUSP) is located in USP4, USP11, USP15, USP20, USP33, and USP48. Moreover, other functional domains are present through different USPs [ 5 ] . It is known that UCHs are small in size and target only small peptides because of their structures, which include a confi ned loop [ 5 ] . The OTU family can be subdivided into three classes depending on their characteristics-otubains (OTUB1 and OTUB2), A20-like OTUs (A20/TNF\u03b1induced protein 3 {TNFAIP3}; Cezanne, Cezanne2, TRABID, and VCPIP1), and OTUDs (OTUD1, OTUD2/YOD1, OTUD3, OTUD4, OTUD5, OTUD6A, OTUD6B, and ALG13). The Josephin family of DUBs also consists of four different subfamilies, including ataxin-3 (ATXN3), ATXN3L, JOSD1, and JOSD2. Unlike other DUBs, the JAMMs have zinc metalloprotease activity and contain an AMSH-LP structure and two conserved motifs that are related to the capacity for cleaving K63-linked polyubiquitin chains [ 5 ] .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 56, "end": 61, "text": "[ 4 ]", "ref_id": "BIBREF3"}, {"start": 348, "end": 353, "text": "[ 4 ]", "ref_id": "BIBREF3"}, {"start": 1803, "end": 1808, "text": "[ 4 ]", "ref_id": "BIBREF3"}, {"start": 2254, "end": 2259, "text": "[ 5 ]", "ref_id": "BIBREF4"}, {"start": 2393, "end": 2398, "text": "[ 5 ]", "ref_id": "BIBREF4"}, {"start": 3014, "end": 3019, "text": "[ 5 ]", "ref_id": "BIBREF4"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Structure of DUBs"}, {"text": "Most vertebrates have a balance that maintains cell birth and cell death through intracellular signaling from various stimuli.

USP2a mainly regulates and stabilizes the fatty acid synthase (FAS) which is frequently overexpressed in malignant tumors [ 7 ] . The deubiquitinating activity of USP2a in FAS regulation may lead to tumorigenesis. In addition, USP2a is associated with Mdm2 and MdmX [ 9 ] . Both Mdm2 and MdmX, known as oncogenic proteins, are negative regulators of p53. Depletion of USP2a enhances both Mdm2 and MdmX protein degradation [ 8 , 9 ] . USP2a overexpression increases the c-MYC level and is able to inactivate p53 in prostate cancer cells [ 10 ] . With these fi ndings, one might expect that USP2a would be strongly associated with tumorigenesis through the regulation of Mdm2 and MdmX and collaboration with c-Myc.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 169, "end": 178, "text": "[ 7 , 8 ]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 303, "end": 308, "text": "[ 7 ]", "ref_id": "BIBREF6"}, {"start": 447, "end": 452, "text": "[ 9 ]", "ref_id": "BIBREF8"}, {"start": 603, "end": 612, "text": "[ 8 , 9 ]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 717, "end": 723, "text": "[ 10 ]", "ref_id": "BIBREF9"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Oncogenic Functions of DUBs"}, {"text": "A recent study has added the function of USP2a expression to cell death by targeting RIP and tumor necrosis factor receptor-associated factor 2 (TRAF2) degradation during tumor necrosis factor (TNF) response, and USP2a consequently promotes the activation of NF-\u03baB [ 11 ] . Although USP4/UNP is associated with the TNF response and activates NF-\u03baB as shown with USP2a, it has a different role, wherein USP4 regulates TAK-1 stability upon TNF response. Interestingly, USP4 deubiquitinates not only TRAF2 but also TRAF6 and leads to the regulation of cell migration [ 12 ] . Further, a genomewide gain-of-function study revealed that AKT acts as a kinase for USP4 phosphorylation and phosphorylated USP4 moves into the cytoplasm from the nucleus. Molecular mechanism studies have shown that USP4 is strongly associated with the transforming growth factor-\u03b2 (TGF-\u03b2) type I receptor (T\u03b2RI) and deubiquitinates and stabilizes T\u03b2RI at the plasma membrane. In addition, USP4 depletion inhibits breast cancer cell migration, which is induced by AKT [ 13 ] . ARF-BP1 is a p53-specifi c E3 ligase that binds to USP4. Through USP4 overexpression, stabilized ARF-BP1 reduces the stability of p53.

In addition, as a herpes virus regulatory protein, Vmw110 is also bound to and stabilized by USP7/HAUSP, and their interaction leads to the regulation of ND10 as a PML nuclear body [ 21 ] . Further, USP7/HAUSP interacts with EBNA1 as an Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) protein and regulates EBNA1 replication [ 22 ] . EBV infection is closely associated with nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC), and the EBNA1 protein disrupts ND10 [ 23 ] . Study of the mechanisms of cellular EBNA1 function showed that EBNA1 is required for binding of USP7/HAUSP to disrupt ND10 [ 23 ] . The tumor suppressor phosphatase and tensin homologue (PTEN) has been studied with cancer progression, and a recent study showed that USP7/HAUSP and PTEN interaction leads to the regulation of PTEN localization [ 24 ] . PTEN ubiquitinated by E3 ligase is translocated and accumulated in the nucleus. However, PTEN is deubiquitinated by USP7/HAUSP and released to the cytoplasm on the PML-RAR\u03b1 signaling network [ 24 ] . The tumor suppressor p53 has been identifi ed as a USP7/HAUSP binding substrate in the nuclear extract of human lung carcinoma H1299 cells (known as p53 null cells) [ 25 ] . The expression of USP7/HAUSP prevents p53 ubiquitination from Mdm2 as a p53-specifi c E3 ligase and increases the p53 protein stability [ 25 ] . The overexpression of USP7/HAUSP induces cancer cell apoptosis, and this phenotype depends on p53 existence in the cells [ 25 ] . Further, USP7/HAUSP can make a complex with p53-Mdm2 and regulates the balancing of p53 expression between normal and stressed cell states [ 26 ] . USP7/HAUSP can elongate p53; however, depletion of USP7/HAUSP also induces upregulation of p53 protein expression [ 27 ] . USP7/ HAUSP stability is regulated by phosphorylation and dephosphorylation via the ataxia-telangiectasia-mutated (ATM)-dependent pathway, and dephosphorylated USP7/HAUSP undergoes the proteasomal degradation [ 28 ] . For example, USP7/ HAUSP is phosphorylated by CK2 as a serine/threonine kinase and leads to stabilization of USP7/HAUSP in a normal state [ 28 ] . The stabilized USP7/HAUSP can enhance Mdm2 and decrease p53 protein expression. In the DNA-damaged state, however, USP7/HAUSP is dephosphorylated by PPM1G as a phosphatase and then degraded, and it decreases the Mdm2 protein and accumulates the p53 protein [ 28 ] . In addition, approximately 60-80 % of phosphorylated USP7/HAUSP exists in human cells [ 28 ] . Thus, USP7/HAUSP expression is reduced to 45 % in adenocarcinoma [ 27 ] . Recently, one study identifi ed a novel gene that is associated with oncogenesis in the breast, called TSPYL5 [ 29 ] . TSPYL5 is frequently overexpressed in breast cancer, and the study showed that an increasing level of TSPYL5 decreased USP7/HAUSP expression and led to the accumulation of p53 ubiquitination [ 29 ] .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 313, "end": 319, "text": "[ 20 ]", "ref_id": "BIBREF19"}, {"start": 503, "end": 509, "text": "[ 21 ]", "ref_id": "BIBREF20"}, {"start": 624, "end": 630, "text": "[ 22 ]", "ref_id": "BIBREF21"}, {"start": 742, "end": 748, "text": "[ 23 ]", "ref_id": "BIBREF22"}, {"start": 874, "end": 880, "text": "[ 23 ]", "ref_id": "BIBREF22"}, {"start": 1094, "end": 1100, "text": "[ 24 ]", "ref_id": "BIBREF23"}, {"start": 1294, "end": 1300, "text": "[ 24 ]", "ref_id": "BIBREF23"}, {"start": 1468, "end": 1474, "text": "[ 25 ]", "ref_id": "BIBREF24"}, {"start": 1613, "end": 1619, "text": "[ 25 ]", "ref_id": "BIBREF24"}, {"start": 1743, "end": 1749, "text": "[ 25 ]", "ref_id": "BIBREF24"}, {"start": 1891, "end": 1897, "text": "[ 26 ]", "ref_id": "BIBREF25"}, {"start": 2014, "end": 2020, "text": "[ 27 ]", "ref_id": "BIBREF26"}, {"start": 2232, "end": 2238, "text": "[ 28 ]", "ref_id": "BIBREF27"}, {"start": 2379, "end": 2385, "text": "[ 28 ]", "ref_id": "BIBREF27"}, {"start": 2645, "end": 2651, "text": "[ 28 ]", "ref_id": "BIBREF27"}, {"start": 2740, "end": 2746, "text": "[ 28 ]", "ref_id": "BIBREF27"}, {"start": 2814, "end": 2820, "text": "[ 27 ]", "ref_id": "BIBREF26"}, {"start": 2933, "end": 2939, "text": "[ 29 ]", "ref_id": "BIBREF28"}, {"start": 3133, "end": 3139, "text": "[ 29 ]", "ref_id": "BIBREF28"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Oncogenic Functions of DUBs"}, {"text": "USP9X/FAM is known as an X-linked deubiquitinating enzyme and the homologue of the Drosophila fat facets gene [ 30 ] .

Therefore, the failure in defending p53 can be linked to cell survival signaling, and partially, to cancer development. Several DUBs are identifi ed as p53 regulating and stabilizing DUBs including USP10, USP29, USP42, and Ub aldehyde-binding protein (Otub1, Otubain 1) [ 52 ] . In normal conditions (unstressed conditions), p53 is located in the cytosol and regulated by Mdm2 E3 ligase for its proteasomal degradation and nuclear export.

Because these factors are activated by stressed condition or physiological signaling, USP29 can also be mediated through external stress signals. USP29, in turn, protects and upregulates p53 by directly deubiquitinating it [ 54 ] . USP42 has also been found to have deubiquitinating activity for p53. During the early phase of response to a stress signal, USP42 preferentially makes up a complex with and deubiquitinates p53, leading to the rapid activation of p53 for cell cycle arrest and p53-dependent transcription [ 55 ] . Otub1 has a somewhat different capacity from other DUBs toward p53. Unlike the catalytic activities of DUBs, the deubiquitinating activity of Otub1 for p53 rescue is weak. Instead, Otub1 has the ability to block the ubiquitin-conjugating activity of Mdm2. The Asp88 residue of Otub1 turns out to be essential for Mdm2 inhibition. Thus, Otub1-mediated stabilization and activation of p53 result from downregulated Mdm2 functions inducing p53-mediated apoptosis and inhibition of cell proliferation [ 56 ] .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 588, "end": 594, "text": "[ 52 ]", "ref_id": "BIBREF51"}, {"start": 1102, "end": 1108, "text": "[ 53 ]", "ref_id": "BIBREF52"}, {"start": 1394, "end": 1400, "text": "[ 54 ]", "ref_id": "BIBREF53"}, {"start": 1690, "end": 1696, "text": "[ 55 ]", "ref_id": "BIBREF54"}, {"start": 2196, "end": 2202, "text": "[ 56 ]", "ref_id": "BIBREF55"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "DUBs Involved in Tumor Suppression"}, {"text": "Another important pathway related to DUB-associated tumor suppression is NF-\u03baB signaling. NF-\u03baB is a transcription factor that induces several downstream genes for cell survival and infl ammation. However, several oncogenic mutations lead to the abnormal activation of NF-\u03baB in cases of many solid tumors as well as lymphoid malignancies [ 57 ] . In many cases, these affected factors are regulated by ubiquitination. Thus, as opposite processes, deubiquitination of NF-\u03baB signaling factors has been considered as a vital mechanism for balancing systemic regulation and potential therapeutic targets. Many works to identify DUBs and substrates for these DUBs, involved in NF-\u03baB signaling, have shown the relevance of several DUBs in NF-\u03baB-associated tumor progression (described in a previous section) or suppression. A classic example of tumor-suppressive DUB is cylindromatosis (CYLD). After the fi rst identifi cation of CYLD as a tumor suppressor, mutations in certain types of cancers, including familial cylindromatosis (FC) and multiple familiar trichoepithelioma (MFT), were found, and a number of studies underlining the molecular mechanisms of CYLD-mediated tumor-suppressive function have delineated the importance and pivotal roles of CYLD in the regulation of the NF-\u03baB signaling pathway [ 58 ] . In addition, various studies using yeast two-hybrid, co-immunoprecipitation, and RNAi-based screening were performed to identify CYLD-regulated substrates of NF-\u03baB signaling components. As a result, it was confi rmed that the deubiquitinating activity of CYLD can regulate several factors of the NF-\u03baB signaling pathway such as TRAF2, TRAF6, and NF-\u03baB essential modulator (NEMO), resulting in negative regulation of NF-\u03baB signaling and tumorsuppressive function [ 59 , 60 ] . In contrast, defi ciency in CYLD leads to increased ubiquitination of target proteins. Further studies using CYLD knockout mice have also supported critical functions of CYLD in tumor suppression, by showing enhanced susceptibility to tumor development [ 61 , 62 ] .

Although there are many inhibitors of cysteine proteases, the effi cacy of these inhibitors is poor due to the diffi culty of targeting these enzymes. The hardship of generating inhibitors specifi c for enzymes is derived from limited specifi city and metabolic instability.

The consequences of proteasome blockade are increased apoptosis and reduced cancer cell survival. Toward the goal of developing proteasome-targeting anticancer drugs and applying to subsequent preclinical and clinical studies, Fig. 15.3 The 26S proteasome. The 26S proteasome is a huge complex of 20,000 kDa in mass. This structure consists of two different large subunits. In the center of the 26S structure, there is a hollow with the 20S core particle, and each end of the core subunit is covered with the 19S regulatory subunits existing \"cap\"-like shape. The 19S regulatory subunit has ubiquitin-binding sites and ATPase active sites that allow entry of substrates into the catalytic core. The 20S core particle provides a chamber for protein degradation numerous biochemical studies have been performed and newly developed proteasome inhibitors have been tested [ 75 ] . The 26S proteasome is composed of a 20S catalytic \"core\" particle forming pore inside and two 19S regulatory \"cap\" subunits located at each end of the core particle ( Fig. 15.3 ) . The 19S subunit recognizes ubiquitinated target proteins destined for proteasomal degradation through its ATPase active sites and ubiquitin-binding sites. For the next step, deubiquitinated targets are transferred to the catalytic core particle for degradation [ 76 ] . Besides direct blockade of proteasome function, there are also further efforts to target components of the 26S proteasome thereby preventing the transfer or degradation process. One example of this effort is b-AP15. This small molecule selectively blocks UCH-L5 and USP14 [ 77 ] . Both UCH-L5 and USP14 are DUBs, components of the 19S subunit of the 26S proteasome; they detach ubiquitin molecules from ubiquitinated proteins targeted to the 26S proteasome. Currently, b-AP15 is being used in preclinical trials; its effective inhibition of proteasomal activity gives a hope that it will be a strong proteasome inhibitory anticancer drug. IU1 is a newly developed USP14 inhibitor. Lee and his colleagues showed that IU1 specifi cally inhibits USP14 activity of the proteasome and thereby enhances proteasomal degradation of the substrates [ 78 ] . Another DUB associated with the 26S proteasome is POH1 (Rpn11). POH1 is localized in the \"lid\" region of the 19S regulatory subunit. Several studies have revealed that POH1 is pivotal for cell survival in certain cancers [ 76 , 79 , 80 ] . In addition, it affects drug resistance to the anticancer drugs in clinical use. There are some debates over whether b-AP15 can block not only UCH-L5 and USP14 but also inhibit POH1.

In addition, UCH-L1 has shown different expression patterns in certain cancers including lung cancer. Based on a recent study on whether several lung cancers and lung cancer cell lines express more UCH-L1 than normal lung tissue, continual efforts to develop UCH-L1-specifi c inhibitors using high-throughput screening have been made. Isatin O-acyl oximes effi ciently inhibit UCH-L1 and tumor growth in lung cancer cells. The importance of the enzymatic activity of UCH-L1 regarding association with diseases has also brought about the development of other specifi c inhibitors for UCH-L1.
