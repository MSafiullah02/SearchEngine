They offer information on a lot of local events\u2014topics that many readers are interested in anyway [6]\u2014and the police is a trusted source of information for many [3]. Currently addressing the German market with the prototype, we have crawled and indexed press releases from the German press portal Blaulicht. In our evaluation, we compare different strategies of formulating search queries given a URL. In a TREC-style setup [5] on 105 topics covering 7 classes of police-related events, we show that even the most simple querying strategy (searching the title of the news article in the titles and bodies of the press releases) substantially outperforms the search facility offered by the press portal itself. It turns out that the best (and more involved) automatic querying strategy implemented in our system achieves precision@1 and nDCG@5 scores of about 0.9\u2014a performance clearly indicating practical applicability.",
