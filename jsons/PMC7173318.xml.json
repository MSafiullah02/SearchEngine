It is also the fourth commonest cause of death globally, accounting for about 3.0 million deaths worldwide in 2016 [2]. Viral infection is one of the most important causes of LRTI [3]. Because of large overlap in symptoms and clinical presentation between bacterial and viral LRTI, antibiotics are inappropriately prescribed to patients with viral infection. This may result in potential risks of antimicrobial resistance with a corresponding financial burden and environmental pollution [4]. Furthermore, inappropriate prescription of antibiotics is even more critical in China, which ranks as the world's most frequent user of antibiotics [5], [6]. Overuse of intravenous antibiotics in patients hospitalized with LRTI constitutes an important part of the inappropriate prescription of antibiotics [7]. In one retrospective study in a teaching hospital in Beijing [8], the median duration of intravenous antibiotics was 10 days (interquartile range 8\u201314 days) among hospitalized individuals with mild to moderate community-acquired pneumonia (CAP). Diagnostic uncertainty regarding the lack of microbiological evidence may be one of the most important reasons.",

It is easy to understand that physicians can safely stop antibiotics as soon as they know the positive viral results for patients with upper respiratory infections or asthma, as demonstrated in the study by Brendish et al. [9]. However, for patients with pneumonia and other kinds of LRTI, most Chinese physicians refer to local clinical guidelines for duration of antibiotics, such as 5\u20137 days for CAP [16], 10\u201314 days for CAP with atypical pathogen [16], 5\u201310 days for AECOPD [17] and 14 days for acute bronchiectasis [18]. Although it is difficult to exclude bacterial co-infection, the knowledge of viral aetiology will help physicians to decide whether to stop intravenous antibiotics earlier [10]. Considering that length of hospital stay for LRTI patients was directly related to duration of intravenous antibiotics, we finally chose duration of intravenous antibiotics as the primary outcome. With the median cost around $225 per hospital-day for patients with LRTI, 1 day less of intravenous antibiotics and 1 day less of hospitalization could save billions of dollars in China.",

Our post-hoc analysis indicated that the cost during hospitalization in the intervention group would be lower than, or at least equal to, that in the control group if the FilmArray Respiratory Panel test cost less than $360. Third, because the proportion of patients who received intravenous antibiotic therapy was high and duration of intravenous antibiotics was relatively long in both groups, extrapolation of our results should be carefully interpreted. Fourth, the study was conducted in general wards, without including patients from ICUs. The effect of POCT needs further rigorous evaluation in patients who are more severely ill, including ICU patients.",
