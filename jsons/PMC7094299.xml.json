            "text": "Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) is a newly described infectious disease and a novel SARS-associated coronavirus (SARS-CoV) has been identified as the causative agent. SARS-CoV possesses a positive single-stranded RNA genome (\u224829 727 nucleotides) encoding at least five structural proteins: spike (S), membrane (M), envelope (E), nucleocapsid (N) proteins [1], [2], [3] and the newly identified ORF3a [4]. The S glycoprotein mediates virus binding to the target cells and subsequent membrane fusion [5]. The N protein binds to a defined packaging signal on the RNA, leading to formation of the helical nucleocapsids [6]. The E protein is a minor yet critical structural component in coronavirus assembly. The M glycoprotein is the most abundant structural protein on the viral envelope; it is a triple-spanning membrane protein with a long carboxyl-terminal tail in the virion interior which interacts with the E and S proteins during assembly [7], hence M protein has been implicated as a key player in coronavirus assembly and budding [7]. Besides, monoclonal antibodies to the M protein of mouse hepatitis virus (MHV), a mouse coronavirus, could neutralize virus infectivity in vitro and protect animals against lethal viral challenge in vivo [8]. Antiserum to M protein was found to contain neutralizing antibody towards SARS-CoV infection in vivo [9]. SARS patients-derived human recombinant antibodies to M protein also efficiently neutralize SARS-CoV infectivity [10] and two immunodominant epitopes (a.a. 1\u201331 and a.a. 132\u2013161) on the SARS-CoV M protein have been recently identified [11].",

To further characterize the structure and functions of SARS-CoV M protein, large quantities of purified proteins are required. Therefore, we aimed at developing a method for mass production of SARS-CoV M protein. Owing to the generally high production yield, ease of virus construction and safety, baculovirus/insect cell expression system was selected for the expression of recombinant M protein with or without histidine (His6) tags. Surprisingly, we found that the expression of SARS-CoV M protein in insect cells triggered early induction of apoptosis, and led to exceedingly low expression level. This is the first report regarding the induction of apoptosis in animal cells by the expression of SARS-CoV M protein.",

            "text": "The recombinant baculovirus expressing the histidine-tagged (His6) N protein (rNH), vBacNH, was constructed previously [13]. To construct the recombinant baculovirus expressing M protein, the full-length gene fragment of SARS-CoV M protein (TW1 strain, GenBank Accession No. AY291451) was amplified by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) from the vector provided by Prof. Pei-Jer Chen (College of Medicine, National Taiwan University) and subsequently subcloned into pFastBac HTb (Invitrogen). The subcloning resulted in the fusion of a His6 tag at the N-terminus of M gene under the control of polyhedrin promoter. Alternatively, the M gene was PCR-amplified and subcloned into pFastBac1 vector (Invitrogen). The resultant plasmids were designated pBac-MH and pBac-M, respectively (Fig. 1\n). For protein expression in mammalian cells, the polyhedrin and p10 promoters in the pFastBac DUAL vector (Invitrogen) was deleted, and replaced by cytomegalovirus immediate-early promoter (CMV-IE) which was PCR-amplified from pcDNA3.0 plasmid (Invitrogen). The gene fragments encoding the M protein with or without His6 tag were PCR-amplified from pBac-MH and pBac-M, respectively and subcloned into the corresponding site downstream of the CMV-IE promoter. The resultant plasmids were designated pBacMam-MH and pBacMam-M (Fig. 1). Similarly, the gene encoding enhanced yellow fluorescent protein (EYFP) was cloned under the control of CMV-IE promoter to obtain pBacMam-EYFP. The recombinant baculoviruses were generated based on these plasmids using Bac-to-Bac\u00ae system (Invitrogen) and designated vBacMH, vBacM, vBacMam-MH, vBacMam-M and vBacMam-EYFP, respectively. The storage, amplification and titration of the recombinant baculoviruses were performed as described [14].",

As shown, the viability of cells infected by wt AcMNPV and vBacNH declined slowly and remained higher than 55% at 3 dpi. Surprisingly, the viability of vBacMH-infected cells started to decrease sharply at 1.5 dpi, and precipitously dropped to \u224820% at 3 dpi, suggesting strong adverse effects of rMH expression on Sf-9 cells. To examine whether the dramatic decrease of cell viability resulted from the His6 tag fused to M protein, we constructed vBacM expressing rM devoid of the His6 tag for infection. Likewise, the vBacM-infected cells exhibited rapid death kinetics and the viability dropped below 20% at 3 dpi.",

In contrast to the soluble rNH, rMH protein was strongly associated with membranes and formed protein aggregates if proteins were boiled at 95 \u00b0C prior to electrophoresis. Only treatment of samples under non-denaturing conditions at 37 \u00b0C could partially alleviate the aggregation problem. Such thermal aggregation was also observed for SARS-CoV M protein expressed in Vero E6 cells and the region (a.a. 51\u2013170) responsible for the thermal aggregation was identified [18].

            "text": "One unusual finding, however, was that expression of rMH in Sf-9 cells resulted in accelerated cell death (Fig. 3A) and high cytotoxicity (Fig. 3B). These phenomena were concomitant with the early emergence of the hallmarks of apoptosis such as cell shrinkage, nuclear condensation (Fig. 4A) and DNA fragmentation (Fig. 4B and C) at 2 dpi, thus confirming the accelerated induction of apoptosis in insect cells by the expression of rMH. The apoptosis was also triggered early by the expression of rM, thus excluding the possibility that the additional His6 tag solely accounted for the accelerated induction. Normally, insect cells infected by wt or recombinant baculoviruses (e.g. vBacNH, Fig. 3A) do not exhibit obvious CPE until 3 dpi [19] because the baculovirus-encoded p35 protein blocks baculovirus-induced apoptosis in insect cells during the early stage of virus infection [20], which is an important strategy to prolong virus replication. The early induction of apoptosis, therefore, interfered with viral gene expression and virus replication and at least partly contributed to the exceedingly low expression level (Fig. 2). Intriguingly, when Sf-9 cells were co-infected with three recombinant baculoviruses individually expressing E, M and S proteins or singly infected with a recombinant baculovirus expressing all 3 SARS-CoV proteins simultaneously, SARS-CoV VLPs (virus-like particles) comprising all three proteins were obtained [21], [22], but no apoptosis was noted. The M protein of other coronaviruses (e.g. MHV) accumulates in the Golgi complex as homomultimeric complexes when expressed alone [23]. However, in combination with the E protein, M protein is retained in the budding compartment and interacts with E protein to assemble into VLPs which are exported from the cell [24]. Similarly, SARS-CoV M protein is a triple-spanning membrane protein and predominantly localizes in the Golgi [25]; it is thus reasonable to hypothesize that when expressed alone, M protein accumulated in the Golgi and jammed the sorting of other cellular proteins, thereby triggering the apoptosis. But when co-expressed with E and S proteins, M protein interacted with other proteins to assemble into VLPs that were released all over in the cytoplasm [22] or bud out of the cells [21], thus no apoptosis was observed.",

Our data again confirmed that M protein, with or without His6 tag, did not induce appreciable apoptosis in the mammalian cells (Fig. 5). However, we found, for the first time, that the expression SARS-CoV M protein triggered early induction of apoptosis in insect cells and led to low expression levels. The discrepancy was probably due to the differences in cell type. Furthermore, the baculovirus-expressed rM and rMH proteins were highly insoluble, difficult to extract from cell lysates and prone to thermal aggregation. These attributes created extra difficulties in the production of full-length M protein using the baculovirus/insect cell expression system. One possible solution to this hurdle is the fusion of a signal peptide and removal of the transmembrane domain (a.a. 21\u201399) [29] while leaving the immunodominant epitopes [11] intact. This concept has been demonstrated feasible as high level expression of SARS-CoV M protein lacking the transmembrane domain in Pichia pastoris was achieved and no apoptosis was reported [30]. However, the glycosylation pattern, a property critical to the M protein activity, necessitates further investigation. Alternatively, SARS-CoV M protein may be co-expressed with E protein and co-purified in the form of VLP.",
