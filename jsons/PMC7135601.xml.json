The provirus is committed to one of three outcomes: latency, controlled growth, or lysis. Latency occurs when the provirus reproduces itself along with the host cell such that all daughter cells contain the viral genetic material. These cells can remain latent or be triggered into one of the other two outcomes at a future time. A classic example of latency is the herpes virus, which can remain dormant until a trigger such as stress activates the virus and a characteristic herpetic skin lesion is produced. In the controlled growth outcome, the host cell is not destroyed but becomes committed to the production of new virions, which are gradually released into the surrounding interstitial space. The last outcome, lysis, involves destruction of the host cell upon release of the newly formed virions. This process is referred to as the cytopathic effect and often results in patterned tissue damage that can be used in the clinical laboratory for identification of the virus (Strodtbeck, 1986, Voyles, 1993).Many of the drugs developed for viral disease also have an effect on rapidly growing cells, which limits their use in the newborn.\n",

Escaping virions in the bloodstream stimulate the production of circulating IgM and IgG antibodies. IgM tends to be produced earlier if the virus is new to the immune system, whereas IgG tends to be produced first if the virus is a repeat challenger. The rise in fetal IgM during intrauterine infection allows fetal or cord blood levels to be used in the diagnosis of congenital viral infection. IgM production peaks early in the infection and rapidly declines. IgG peaks gradually and functions longer than IgM. Both of these immunoglobulins attempt to neutralize the invading virus by binding with the virus to activate complement. This mechanism is designed to prevent virus absorption to host cells (Overall, 1992, Strodtbeck, 1986).",

Infected host cells develop new virus-induced, antigenic determinants on their cell membranes that alert these defenses. The new antigens trigger T lymphocytes to respond along with macrophages and other components of the immune system (Overall, 1992, Strodtbeck, 1986). Activation of the immune response at this point may result in the destruction of some host cells, rather than the virus, by the immune system. In the developing fetus, this can worsen the severity of birth defects associated with specific viral diseases, such as rubella or cytomegalovirus (CMV). For example, neurons coated with CMV may be destroyed by lymphocytes which, when added to the number of neurons undergoing viral lysis, increases the risk for microcephaly.",

Histamine and kinin release results in vasodilation, heat production, and increased capillary permeability. This results in increased temperature (fever) and stagnant anoxia locally, which decreases absorption of the virus because most viruses are susceptible to increased temperature and acidic environments (Strodtbeck, 1986, Voyles, 1993). A side effect of this process is a less-than-ideal environment for the growth of healthy tissue. The final consideration in the newborn\u2019s response to viral infection is the production of interferon. Interferons are highly active proteins produced by virus-infected cells that act upon neighboring cells to prevent the spread of the viral infection. They also are produced by cells of the immune system. Interferons disrupt viral infectivity in a variety of ways that are still being studied. Newborn interferon production appears to be decreased via one pathway and normal via the other (Strodtbeck, 1986). Despite the deficiencies of the newborn immune system to viral attack, only a few of the hundreds of viruses known to cause human disease actually result in infection of the fetus or newborn (Overall, 1992).",

Congenital viral infections occur when an infected mother transmits the virus across the placenta to the fetus. Theoretically, all viruses are capable of causing congenital infections, but most do not (Overall, 1992). This may be attributable in part to maternal and placental immune defenses that protect the fetus or to the nature of the maternal illness. Most viral infections in pregnancy are mild respiratory or gastrointestinal infections that do not pose a serious threat to the health of the fetus (Overall, 1992). The viruses implicated in congenital infection are cytomegalovirus, herpes simplex virus, rubella (German measles), and varicella (chickenpox) (Overall, 1992, Smith, 1993).

            "text": "Each year significant neonatal morbidity and mortality occur as a result of viral infections. The presence of a developing immune system inexperienced in response to viruses in a rapidly growing host make the newborn especially vulnerable to viral disease. The effects of viral infection are varied and range from no symptoms to mild or severe disease. Although the newborn immune system is capable of mounting a defense to the virus, the response often is inadequate for preventing infection. The outcome of viral infection depends upon the specific virus, the gestational age of the newborn at the onset of infection, and the severity of the infection. In addition to limited specific antiviral drug therapy, many of the available drugs are not recommended for use in newborns. Several new therapies are being tested and show promise; eventually they may lessen the severity of disseminated disease and minimize the long-term sequelae. Until such time, the major thrusts of management of neonatal viral disease are prevention of the infection and supportive care for the acutely ill newborn.",
