They are divided into three genera, A, B and C within the family Orthomyxoviridae, based on the antigenic properties of the viral nucleoprotein. Influenza B and C viruses principally infect humans, usually causing mild illness in children, and undergo only gradual antigenic variation (Wright and Webster, 2001). By contrast, the influenza A viruses are maintained in a vast natural reservoir in wild waterfowl and shorebirds, from which they emerge to cause disease in domestic poultry, horses, pigs and humans. Their ability to infect the human respiratory tract and the periodic emergence of antigenically novel agents through genomic reassortment enable the influenza A viruses to cause worldwide epidemics with high morbidity and mortality (\u201cpandemic influenza\u201d).",

            "text": "The emergence of new pandemic subtypes of influenza A virus occurs through two pathways. The first is for an avian virus to infect and cause disease in a human (\u201cavian influenza\u201d) and evolve during the course of illness to become transmissible from person to person. The second is made possible by the multipartite genome, which permits a circulating seasonal agent to acquire new HA and NA genes through reassortment (\u201cantigenic shift\u201d), when a cell is co-infected by a seasonal virus and either an avian virus or one that has adapted to a mammalian host, such as pigs. Novel viruses emerged several times during the 20th century. In 1918, an avian H1N1 virus acquired the capacity for efficient respiratory transmission, resulting in a catastrophic pandemic. As the H1N1 virus continued to circulate, the progressive accumulation of mutations in the H1 and N1 genes permitted antigenically \u201cdrifted\u201d variants to return and re-infect the same populations, causing recurrent outbreaks of illness (\u201cseasonal influenza\u201d). In 1957, a new reassortant virus appeared in which the two surface glycoproteins of H1N1 were replaced by avian H2 and N2. A second reassortment event produced H3N2 influenza in 1968, after which the H2N2 virus soon ceased to circulate.",

A seasonal variant of the H1N1 virus reappeared in 1977, apparently through an accidental laboratory release, and it continues to circulate along with the H3N2 virus, both in humans and in pigs. Because an influenza A virus with a novel HA has not entered the human population since 1968, the emergence of a new pandemic strain is likely. Such a virus might obtain its HA from an agent such as the avian/swine reassortant H2N3 that has been detected in the USA (Ma et al., 2008), or from any of several purely avian strains that have infected humans during the past decade (see below).",

The current armamentarium of licensed anti-influenza medications consists of four drugs: two adamantanes, amantadine and rimantadine (Fig. 2\n), and two NA inhibitors, the oral drug oseltamivir (Tamiflu\u00ae) and the inhaled medication zanamivir (Relenza\u00ae) (Fig. 3\n) (De Clercq, 2006). Because their licensure was obtained based on studies in healthy adults with uncomplicated seasonal influenza, little is known about how these drugs should be used to treat severe disease. In particular, only anecdotal information is available on the treatment of fulminant H5N1 virus infections with oseltamivir. Therapy of severe influenza is made even more challenging by the rapid emergence of drug-resistant viruses, especially during treatment with the adamantanes, and by the lack of an approved parenteral medication that can be administered to patients incapable of swallowing or inhaling a drug. The only other licensed drug with anti-influenza activity, ribavirin (Virazole\u00ae), has been used to only a very limited extent to treat severe infections (see below) (Fig. 4\n).",

The presence of these two competing activities on the virion surface appears to have come about because sialic acid coupled to galactose is present not only on respiratory epithelial cells, but on a variety of molecules in respiratory mucus and even on oligosaccharide components of the HA itself. NA is therefore needed to minimize the binding of HA to \u201cdecoy\u201d receptors, so as to enable virions to reach their target cells and to depart from them at the end of the replication cycle. If NA is genetically deleted from an influenza A virus, the initiation of infection is drastically inhibited, and nascent virions clump together and are unable to spread through a cell monolayer (Matrosovich et al., 2004, Wagner et al., 2002). Because HA and NA must work in tandem to achieve efficient infection, reassortant viruses with new combinations of these genes may not replicate efficiently.",

The HA of the currently circulating H3N2 and H1N1 viruses binds preferentially to sialic acid coupled with an \u03b1(2,6) linkage to galactose, which is present on cell-surface glycoproteins throughout the human respiratory tract, helping to explain why seasonal influenza occasionally develops into primary viral pneumonia (Ibricevic et al., 2006, Nicholls et al., 2007). By contrast, avian viruses make use of \u03b1(2,3)-linked sialic acids, which until the occurrence of viral pneumonia in patients in the 1997 Hong Kong H5N1 outbreak were thought to be absent from human respiratory epithelium. Recent studies have shown that, while \u03b1(2,6)-linked sialic acids predominate from the nasal cavities down to the bronchi, \u03b1(2,3)-linked sialic acids are present on bronchiolar lining cells, type II pneumocytes and alveolar macrophages, providing a possible explanation for the predominance of lower respiratory tract symptoms in H5N1 patients and the rapid development of ARDS (Ibricevic et al., 2006, Shinya et al., 2006, van Riel et al., 2006).",

Young children experiencing their first bout of influenza tend to shed virus longer than persons who are reinfected by the same viral subtype, but they generally suffer no ill effects (Sato et al., 2005). However, seasonal viruses can also cause severe disease in very young infants, elderly people and those with immunodeficiency, cardiopulmonary disease or other chronic illnesses; in the United States, influenza A virus infections are responsible for nearly 40,000 deaths every year.",

Limited studies have shown that while patients with uncomplicated influenza stop shedding virus in nasopharyngeal secretions by the third day of illness, virus can often be detected 5\u20137 days or longer after symptom onset in more severely ill hospitalized patients (Ison et al., 2003, Leekha et al., 2007, McGeer et al., 2007, Nicholson et al., 2000, Treanor et al., 2000).

Limited patient studies indicate that, in contrast to seasonal influenza, signs of lower respiratory tract involvement are more prominent than upper respiratory tract symptoms, and viral titers are higher in pharyngeal than nasal secretions (De Jong et al., 2006). The illness progresses rapidly to acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and multiorgan failure, in a pattern reminiscent of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) (Ng et al., 2006). Diarrhea is also common, and a few patients have presented with only severe diarrhea and/or neurologic changes that progressed rapidly to lethal encephalitis, with pulmonary disease either developing late or absent (Apisarnthanarak et al., 2004, De Jong et al., 2005a). Clinical laboratory and pathologic findings include leukopenia, marked lymphopenia with low T-cell counts, thrombocytopenia, hemophagocytosis, hepatic central lobular necrosis and acute renal tubular necrosis.",

Because the latter cells give rise to new squamous type I pneumocytes following most types of lung injury, their loss through viral infection could lead to ARDS. Severe illness may also reflect more intense and widespread viral replication than occurs in seasonal influenza. A number of other factors may also contribute to the heightened virulence of the H5N1 virus, including greater suppression of host type I interferon responses by the NS1 protein (Garcia-Sastre, 2006), more efficient function of the RNA polymerase (Salomon et al., 2006) and altered activity of the PB1-F2 protein (Conenello et al., 2007). Enhanced viral replication is reflected in high titers of virus in nasopharyngeal or pharyngeal secretions and the presence of viral RNA in the spleen, small and large intestines and cerebrospinal fluid and in the blood of fatal cases, as detected by PCR (Buchy et al., 2007, De Jong et al., 2005a, De Jong et al., 2006, Uiprasertkul et al., 2005). In the series of patients studied by De Jong et al., extensive viral replication was accompanied by high levels of cytokines and chemokines (IP-10, MCP-1, IL-8, IL-6 and IL-10) in the plasma (2006). Titers were proportional to the pharyngeal viral load, and were highest in fatal cases.",

Primary human macrophages infected with a 1997 Hong Kong virus produced significantly more TNF-\u03b1 and interferon-\u03b2 than cells infected with H3N2 or H1N1 seasonal viruses; the response profile was similar to that induced by lipopolysaccharide (Cheung et al., 2002, Seo et al., 2002). Recent H5N1 isolates also induced much stronger secretion of IP-10, IFN-\u03b2, IL-6 and RANTES than an H1N1 virus in primary human bronchial epithelial cells and type II pneumocytes (Chan et al., 2005). However, studies in knockout mice have given contradictory results, either showing that the absence of a TNF-\u03b1 or IL-6 response does not reduce mortality (Salomon et al., 2007) or that animals lacking a functional TNF-\u03b1 receptor suffer a milder illness (Szretter et al., 2007). In any case, there is no evidence that the intense inflammatory response seen in H5N1 cases should be regarded as the cause of illness, because glucocorticoid treatment did not improve the outcome of infection in mice and has not altered the course of fatal illness in humans (Arabi et al., 2007, Carter, 2007, Salomon et al., 2007). Although it has been suggested that the intense inflammatory response seen in H5N1 influenza constitutes a form of immune dysregulation or \u201ccytokine storm\u201d (Osterholm, 2005), it may simply be a consequence of severe and extensive viral infection.",

(1998) demonstrated that normal human immunoglobulin (IVIG) contains sufficient anti-influenza antibodies to protect mice from lethal pneumonia when inoculated intranasally up to 8 h after infection with an H3N2 virus (1998). F(ab\u2032)2 fragments were equally active, indicating that protection was based on neutralization, rather than on Fc-receptor-bearing cells or complement. More recently, Lu et al. (2006) showed that a single injection of purified F(ab\u2032)2 fragments derived from immunoglobulin of hyperimmunized horses protected mice against a lethal H5N1 virus challenge. A murine monoclonal antibody (mab) targeting a conserved site on the HA of H1 and H2 viruses protected mice against both agents (Okuno et al., 1994), and mabs to H1, given either intact or as Fab fragments, prevented lethal H1N1 infection in SCID mice (Mozdzanowska et al., 2003, Palladino et al., 1995). Humanized mabs also prevented death when given to mice up to 3 days after an otherwise lethal H5N1 virus challenge (Hanson et al., 2006). Similarly, fully human mabs developed using immortalized B cells from Vietnamese H5N1 survivors protected mice when administered up to 72 h after H5N1 virus challenge (Simmons et al., 2007). Although HA is the most important target of the antibody response, pooled serum from mice immunized against the NA of a seasonal H1N1 virus cross-protected mice against an H5N1 virus, suggesting that persons previously infected with an H1N1 virus will be partially resistant to H5N1 (Gillim-Ross and Subbarao, 2007, Sandbulte et al., 2007).",

This change has been attributed to the availability of over-the-counter amantadine (Hayden, 2006), the licensure of memantine, an amantadine derivative used to treat Alzheimer's disease (Shah, 2006), and the use of amantadine to prevent H9 viral infections on poultry farms in China (Cyranoski, 2005).

Because of its multiple mechanisms of action, ribavirin is able to inhibit a broad range of RNA and DNA viruses, and resistant viruses are rarely observed (see Leyssen et al., 2008).",

Aerosolized ribavirin also reduced the duration of fever in young children with influenza, but sometimes caused bronchospasm (Knight and Gilbert, 1987, Rodriguez et al., 1994). In contrast to the licensed anti-influenza drugs, ribavirin is available in intravenous form. When delivered in that manner, ribavirin eliminated virus from two patients and produced improvement in a third with severe influenza or parainfluenza virus infection (Hayden et al., 1996). However, the drug's clinical utility may be limited by the risk of hemolytic anemia, and its teratogenic properties proscribe its use in pregnant women.",

In ferrets infected with the same isolate, 5 mg/kg/day started 4 h after inoculation prevented death, but 25 mg/kg was required if therapy was delayed until 24 h postchallenge (Govorkova et al., 2007). Recent WHO guidelines recommended that the standard regimen of oseltamivir be used to treat patients with confirmed or strongly suspected H5N1 infections (Schunemann et al., 2007, World Health Organization, 2006). However, the report also noted that severely ill patients might benefit from higher doses (300 mg/day) and/or a 7\u201310-day course of therapy, but that prospective studies would be required to establish benefit. A multi-center study was initiated in Asia and the US in June 2007 to compare standard vs. high-dose regimens of oseltamivir (150 mg/day vs. 300 mg/day for adults with normal renal function) for 5 days or 10 days of therapy for severe seasonal and avian influenza (clinicaltrials.gov identifier: NCT00298233).",

Depending on the specific mutation, a virus may become resistant to oseltamivir, but remain sensitive to zanamivir (Gubareva et al., 2001, Moscona, 2005a, Moscona, 2005b, Moscona, 2008). The first step in the development of resistance is often a mutation in HA that reduces its affinity for sialic acid. Probably because a proper balance of HA/NA activity is required for the maximally efficient spread of virus among respiratory epithelial cells, resistant viruses that arise during the course of drug treatment usually replicate to lower levels in vitro and have a diminished ability to cause disease and be transmitted among ferrets (Carr et al., 2002, Herlocher et al., 2002, Herlocher et al., 2004, Z\u00fcrcher et al., 2006). However, when reverse genetics methods were used to introduce certain resistance mutations into H5N1 viruses, the agents retained their replication capacity and virulence (Yen et al., 2005a, Yen et al., 2005b, Yen et al., 2006, Yen et al., 2007).",

Oseltamivir-resistant H5N1 viruses have also been recovered from a few patients in Southeast Asia. Virus recovered from a girl who was treated first with a prophylactic, then with a therapeutic dose of oseltamivir and survived infection showed a resistant subpopulation, while viruses recovered from two other patients who died despite the early initiation of oseltamivir therapy showed a critical mutation in the NA active site (De Jong et al., 2005a, De Jong et al., 2005b, Le et al., 2005).

Efforts to model this approach in vitro and in vivo have employed combinations of adamantanes and NA inhibitors. Thus, the passage of H1N1, H3N2 and H5N1 viruses in the presence of amantadine or oseltamivir resulted in the acquisition of drug resistance, but when the procedures were repeated in the presence of both drugs, no changes were detected (Ilyushina et al., 2006). When rimantadine was tested in combination with zanamivir, oseltamivir or peramivir, all three combinations showed synergistic activity against H3N2 and H1N1 isolates (Govorkova et al., 2004). In mice infected with an H5N1 virus sensitive to both oseltamivir and amantadine, combination therapy produced an additive benefit: oseltamivir alone gave 30% and amantadine alone gave 60% survival, but combination treatment increased the rate to 90% (Ilyushina et al., 2007). Combination therapy also significantly decreased viral titers in the lungs and prevented spread to the brain.",

Currently available antiviral therapies were developed with the aim of reducing the impact of seasonal influenza, rather than to treat life-threatening disease, but the emergence of the virulent H5N1 virus has forced the world to take another look at influenza and begin to approach it with the seriousness it deserves. New and better antiviral therapies are needed, both to deal with the next pandemic and to reduce the toll of illness and death produced every year by seasonal influenza. Fortunately, current efforts show promise of achieving this goal.",

The virion core contains eight RNA genome segments encapsidated by nucleoprotein (RNPs) and embedded together with associated polymerase (P) molecules in a matrix of M1 proteins. After binding to sialic acid\u2013galactose linked to a cell-surface glycoprotein or glycolipid, the virion is taken up in an endocytic vesicle, where acidification triggers a conformational change that bring viral and endosomal membranes together. Acidification also produces a flow of protons through the M2 ion channel into the interior of the virion, causing the RNPs to dissociate from the M1 matrix and be released into the cytoplasm. They are then transported to the nucleus, where a viral polymerase complex performs transcription and genome replication. The resulting mRNAs move to the cytoplasm and are translated, producing new RNP protein components that are transported back to the nucleus to associate with nascent genome segments. The exit of new RNPs from the nucleus is aided by the viral NS2 (nuclear export protein, NEP). Meanwhile, nascent HA, NA and M2 molecules pass through the Golgi apparatus and undergo glycosylation before moving to the cell membrane. HA is also cleaved to form two chains linked by a disulfide bond. Virion assembly occurs as RNPs and M1 proteins associate with cytoplasmic tails of HA and NA. Successful release of new virus particles requires that NA cleave sialic acid from galactose on the cell surface or on adjacent virions to prevent HA binding.",
