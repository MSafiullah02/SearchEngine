Invasive devices such as central venous catheters (CVCs), indwelling urinary catheters, and ventilators expose the patient to additional risks for infection. Most facilities have implemented infection prevention \u201cbundles\u201d designed to prevent these device-associated HAIs. Due to the success seen in reducing HAIs, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) issued new guidelines. After October 1, 2008, hospitals no longer receive additional payment for cases in which selected conditions were not present on admission, which include CVC-associated bloodstream infections and catheter-associated urinary tract infections [9]. What this means to hospitals is that claims are paid as though the secondary diagnosis was not present. These \u201cHospital-Acquired Conditions\u201d (HACs) are considered \u201cnever events,\u201d but may still be problematic in transplant recipients. Careful attention must be given to good hand hygiene practices and CVC care, as well as to practices that decrease the risk of catheter-associated urinary tract infection. As a protective measure, patients may also be placed into protective precautions to heighten the awareness of the caregivers to the potential for serious infection.",

            "text": "Whereas the 1991 Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) Bloodborne Pathogens Standard focused primarily on employee protection [10], the CDC and HICPAC have published numerous patient-focused guidelines and recommendations for the prevention of HAIs. Revised in 2007, the Guideline for Isolation Precautions: Preventing Transmission of Infectious Agents in Healthcare Settings 2007 [5] updated and expanded the 1996 Guideline for Isolation Precautions in Hospitals. The transition of healthcare delivery from primarily acute care hospitals to other healthcare settings (e.g., home care, ambulatory care, freestanding specialty care sites, and long-term care) created a need for recommendations that could be applied in all healthcare settings using common principles of infection control practice, but could be modified to reflect setting-specific needs. In this revision, the term \u201c nosocomial infections\u201dwas replaced by \u201chealthcare-associated infections\u201d to better reflect the changing patterns in healthcare delivery. It may be difficult to determine the exact site of exposure to an infectious agent and/or acquisition of infection as patients move through the healthcare delivery system. The SARS experience, and more recently, the experience with Ebola virus disease, highlighted the need to better prepare for new emerging pathogens and focused on the ways minor breaks in infection control technique resulted in infections being transmitted to healthcare professionals. Sections of this guideline were created as evidence mounted that environmental controls could decrease the risk of fungal infections in severely immunocompromised patients. While the Protective Environment (PE) has been found to be of greatest benefit for patients undergoing allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplants, there may be some lessons to be learned from successful implementation in this group of patients. Organizational characteristics (e.g., nurse staffing levels and composition, establishment of a safety culture) are also identified as key components to promote adherence to recommended infection control practices. Combining the universal precautions and body substance isolation precautions, contact with human blood, body fluids, secretions or excretions (except for sweat), nonintact skin, mucous membranes, and contaminated items requires the use of personal protective equipment, as part of standard precautions. Respiratory hygiene/cough etiquette, safe injection practices, and the use of masks during insertion of catheters or injection of material into spinal or epidural spaces via lumbar puncture procedures were added to standard precautions in 2007. Transmission-based precautions are used, in addition to standard precautions, to prevent infections spread by airborne, droplet, and direct contact routes. Certain infections that had required disease-specific isolation precautions are now included under standard precautions.",

Included in this category are epidemiologically significant organisms, such as methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), vancomycin-resistant enterococci (VRE), Clostridium difficile, and respiratory syncytial virus (RSV). Private rooms are recommended, but patients colonized or infected with the same organism(s) may be cohorted together, if necessary. If neither of these options is achievable, the immunosuppressive state of potential roommates should be evaluated. For example, placing a VRE-colonized patient with an otherwise healthy 30-year-old who has a broken leg would be preferable to placing that patient with a postoperative transplant recipient who might become more easily colonized and infected. Contact precautions require gloves and gowns be worn for contact with the patient or potentially contaminated items and areas in the patient room. While the likelihood of transmission to other patients through contact with clothing is remote, caregivers are likely to touch their own clothing (e.g., lab coat pockets) and thus transmit the organism on their hands. The 2006 HICPAC/CDC guideline, The Management of Multidrug-Resistant Organisms in Healthcare Settings, recommends donning gowns and gloves upon room entry and discarding them before exiting the room of a patient with organisms that have been implicated in environmental transmission (e.g., VRE, C. difficile, noroviruses and other intestinal tract agents, and RSV) [4].",

Whereas other isolation categories were designed to prevent the transmission of disease from an infected patient to others, the purpose of protective or \u201creverse\u201d isolation is to protect the highly susceptible patient. Neutropenic precautions are practices designed to reduce microbial contamination in the patient\u2019s environment. Because many infections in immunosuppressed patients are attributable to the patient\u2019s endogenous flora, the use of special environmental precautions is not recommended, except for allogeneic stem cell transplant recipients, for whom a protective environment is necessary to minimize fungal spore counts in the environment and decrease the risk of invasive fungal infections [5]. To reduce the risk of infection, nursing care often focuses on skin integrity, indwelling intravenous devices, and good oral hygiene.",

In 2005, the National Healthcare Safety Network (NHSN) was established to integrate and supersede three surveillance systems at the CDC: the NNIS, the Dialysis Safety Network (DSN), and the National Surveillance of Healthcare Workers (NaSH). Patient-specific event data are entered into this Web-based system by individual facilities but comparative results can be found on the NHSN Web site (http://www.cdc.gov/nhsn) and are published annually in the American Journal of Infection Control. Many states have mandated that HAIs be reported through NHSN to better evaluate the magnitude of HAIs. The public reporting of infection data is state specific, ranging from all infections being reported in Pennsylvania to more limited requirements, such as primary bloodstream infections only. CMS requires reporting of certain HAIs as part of pay for performance initiatives. Healthcare facilities use the standardized definitions created by the CDC, previously in the NNIS program and now in the NHSN [11], to classify HAIs, thereby enabling comparisons to national benchmarks. For device-associated infections, such as ventilator-associated pneumonia, central line-associated bloodstream infection (CLABSI), and catheter-associated urinary tract infections, rates should be calculated (the denominator is device-days and numerator is the number of infections recorded; result is multiplied by a factor of 1000). Rates are thus recorded as the number of infections per 1000 device-days. HAI data are stratified into types of patient care areas (e.g., medical ICU, medical/surgical ICU, and SOT specialty care area) to provide infection rates according to the risk factors of the patient population served [12]. Operative procedure codes available for identification of surgical site infection (SSI) rates include liver, kidney, and heart transplant surgeries. Healthcare facilities reporting HAIs to NHSN can get a standardized infection ratio (SIR) which is calculated by dividing the number of observed infections by the number of predicted (i.e., expected) infections. The number of predicted infections is calculated using infection probabilities estimated from multivariate logistic regression models constructed from NHSN data during a baseline period, which represents a standard population\u2019s infection experience. NHSN provides a p value and 95% confidence intervals to determine the statistical significance of the SIR for the healthcare facility\u2019s HAIs.\n",

Many infections with coagulase-negative staphylococci are related to the increased use of various indwelling central lines. CLABSI is one of the primary infections seen in the immunosuppressed patient, because normal skin flora may colonize long-term access devices. In 2011, the CDC published Guidelines for the Prevention of Intravascular Catheter-Related Infections to help address this issue [13]. The incidence of infection varies with the type and intended use of intravascular devices. The two main device types are short term or temporary devices and those that are used for long-term access. Every device has some advantages and some risks. Attention should be focused on preventing site infections and on providing education for the patients and their caregivers if the catheter is not removed before hospital discharge.",

The use of antimicrobial ointments for catheter insertion sites is no longer recommended, except for hemodialysis catheter insertion sites. Chlorhexidine-impregnated dressings may be beneficial in preventing CLABSI [16]. Daily chlorhexidine bathing may also reduce the rate of CLABSI in intensive care and bone marrow transplantation units [17, 18].

The CDC has three specific definitions of nosocomial pneumonia [11]. No defined incubation period exists when fungal pneumonia is suspected, so the traditional \u201conset of infection 48 hours after admission\u201d standard that separates community-acquired infections from hospital-acquired infections is not valid. The isolation of fungal species from expectorated sputum may not be diagnostic, but clinicians often start antifungal therapy when they are encountered. These isolates could also represent transient colonization or a laboratory contaminant, not necessarily invasive disease [21]. Therefore, comparing fungal pneumonia rates among hospitals is difficult. Because of the ubiquitous nature of circulating fungal spores and of generally higher spore counts outdoors, determining whether a discharged patient who is readmitted with invasive fungal pneumonia acquired the infection while he or she was in the hospital is challenging. Comparative data on the incidence of nosocomial fungal pneumonia are unavailable, and many institutions have attempted to develop their own definitions of hospital-associated fungal pneumonia. Table 46-2 details the case definitions at some of the authors\u2019 institutions; an arbitrary hospitalization of 7 days prior to onset of infection is used to distinguish between hospital- and community-acquired fungal infections. A recent review of construction and renovation-related healthcare-associated fungal infections showed a decrease in number of outbreaks between 2010 and 2014, which may be due to effectiveness of infection prevention measures, or because of the high number of previously reported outbreaks [22].\n\n",

Settle plates, however, may detect fungi aerosolized during medical procedures (e.g., during wound dressing changes), as described in an outbreak of aspergillosis among liver transplant patients [28]. Air sampling methods using calibrated sieve impactors or centrifugal samplers are recommended to provide standardized counts, the results of which are expressed as CFU per cubic meter. Routine air sampling for fungi is not generally recommended. During construction or renovation or in times when isolates of Aspergillus or other fungi are identified in patient cultures, air sampling may be performed to assess the relative level of spores in the environment. Outdoor samples may be collected as appropriate controls.

At the beginning of renovation, airborne particulates and fungal spore counts may be exceptionally high because spores are dispersed into the environment during the demolition process. The Facility Guidelines Institute publishes guidelines for the design and construction of hospital and healthcare facilities [30]. Infection control personnel should be involved from the planning stages through project commissioning. Building owners are required to provide an infection control risk assessment (ICRA) to determine the potential risks of transmission of various infectious agents during the project. The ICRAis conducted by a panel with expertise in infection control and epidemiology, risk management, facility design, construction ventilation, and safety. An ICRA should be conducted during the early planning phase of the project, before construction begins, and continue through project construction and commissioning. Specific construction-related requirements mandated by theICRA should be included in the contract documents. Many state health departments now require theICRA submission before they will issue permits for hospital construction and renovation projects. When construction or renovation activities are planned in or near facilities that handle high-risk transplant recipients, even more strict protective guidelines and monitoring requirements may be established during the planning process [31]. Such guidelines help to define the appropriate barriers and techniques for preventing the spread of dust and debris into other areas of the facility. Construction and housekeeping personnel should be trained in the dangers of aspergillosis, with an emphasis on control measures. Strategies for the prevention of nosocomial aspergillosis will control any other fungi that are transmissible by dust, such as the zygomycetes (e.g., Mucor and Rhizopus species). Infection control interventions to prevent nosocomial aspergillosis were well illustrated during one construction-associated outbreak, in which the incidence of invasive aspergillosis rose from 3.18 to 9.88 cases per 1000 patient-days during the construction period [32]. The control measures that were used included portable HEPA filtration units, the installation of sealed windows and easy-to-clean tiles and shades, and the increased maintenance of the ventilation system. The introduction of portable HEPA filter units was the most important step in this undertaking. After the institution of control measures, the infection rate decreased to 2.91 cases per 1000 patient-days.",

Arnow et al. [34] reported an increase in spore counts of Aspergillus fumigatus and A. flavus, with a mean of more than 1 CFU/m3 associated with the opening of a new hospital. An environmental assessment identified fungal contamination of the carpet, fireproofing material, and ventilation filters. Fungi may contaminate damp areas, discolored ceiling tiles, and peeling wallpaper. Most studies documented decreased indoor spore counts after the institution of appropriate control measures [31, 33]. Sometimes, air sampling is recommended for the assessment of air contamination after construction or HEPA filter changes and as part of an outbreak investigation. Repeat air samples may be collected after an identified source is decontaminated or removed. An environmental audit may also include periodic sampling. The role of fungal typing in the investigation of outbreaks is unclear; multiple fungal strains can cause healthcare-associated infections in one outbreak given the ubiquitous presence of fungi in the environment and the identification of different serial Aspergillus strains by whole genome sequencing within a single patient [35] may limit the application of this epidemiological tool.",

Forty-three outbreaks had been reported, including many nosocomial outbreaks caused by Pseudomonas aeruginosa [36]. HAIs attributed to the use of contaminated water include those caused by Legionella pneumophila P. aeruginosa; Aeromonas, Acinetobacter, Burkholderia, Enterobacter, Flavobacterium, and other Pseudomonas species; T. gondii; and Serratia, Mycobacteria, and Aspergillus species. In 2006, the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) published the Long Term 2 Surface Water Treatment Rule (LT2 rule), which addresses strategies to reduce disease incidence associated with Cryptosporidium and other disease-causing microorganisms in drinking water [37]. Individual state regulations or codes may identify requirements for maintaining hot water temperatures to protect patients from being scalded. Temperatures at the return should ideally be \u2265124 \u00b0F (\u226551 \u00b0C), and cold water temperature at <68 \u00b0F (<20 \u00b0C) in healthcare facilities [3].\n",

The degree of contamination (percent of positive fixtures and quantity of bacteria present) varies significantly from building to building. The type of hot water system, the water temperature, location, and building age all play a role in the colonization of pipes within a facility [43]. The monitoring and control of Legionella species in a healthcare facility require a team effort, in which the microbiology laboratory, infection prevention and control, and maintenance departments must work together to provide a safe environment for high-risk patients. The CDC does not recommend routine environmental culturing for Legionella, but guidelines state that (1) this could be a component of Legionella prevention in healthcare facilities that provide care to transplant recipients, (2) may be appropriate to identify the source of infection as part of an outbreak investigation, and (3) to assess the effectiveness of water treatment or decontamination protocols [2, 3]. No guidelines regarding culturing frequency or acceptable levels of positivity are available. Generally, each facility will establish a policy on environmental monitoring that is dependent on the patient population. Environmental investigation to identify the source of Legionella is recommended when there is an outbreak, defined as one case of definite or two cases of possible healthcare-associated Legionnaires\u2019 disease within a 6-month period [3].\n",

Systems that use holding tanks or heaters that allow water to stagnate in the bottom of the tank provide a reservoir for the multiplication of Legionella species. For immediate control of Legionella in the setting of an outbreak, thermal eradication (superheat and flush) or hyperchlorination of the water supply is recommended [3]. Ongoing control of Legionella could be done with the use of copper/silver ionization systems, which release low concentrations of metal ions into the water distribution system, ultraviolet light sterilization, or maintenance of an elevated water temperature or chlorine content [44, 45]. Point-of-use filters have been found to be effective in eliminating Legionella and could be used without modification or disinfection of the potable water system [46], though are not on the current guidelines. In transplant units, shower heads and tap aerators should be removed, cleaned, and disinfected monthly using a chlorine-based, EPA-registered product; a 1:100 dilution of bleach may be used if no EPA-registered chlorine disinfectant is available [3]. In addition, large-volume room air humidifiers that generate aerosols should not be used unless they are subjected to high-level disinfection and only sterile water is used.",

Disruptions in the water distribution system, such as water main breaks, the use of fire hydrants, floods, and internal maintenance and construction disruptions, may cause changes in water pressure that disrupt the biofilm within the potable water system [38]. When pieces of the biofilm break free and enter the water supply, the water may appear cloudy or dirty. Local water authorities may issue water restrictions in the event of major contamination of the drinking water supply. Establishing water service disruption policies can be helpful for protecting immunosuppressed patients. Substitution of the appropriate bottled water is encouraged for drinking and for mouth care. Ice machine filters may become contaminated, so filters should be changed after restoration of water service [47]. Suspending showering until the water is determined to be safe may be necessary. When service is restored, all fixtures should be flushed until the water appears clear. Tub bathing may be acceptable because little aerosolization of the water occurs during the bathing process. Bed baths or other systems that do not generate aerosols are recommended.",

Intraabdominal and cardiothoracic surgery and manipulation of the urinary tract are the risk factors for enterococcal infection. Reportedly, the severity of illness is one of the main risk factors for the development of VRE bacteremia [66\u201370]. Critically ill patients in the intensive care unit or those with underlying medical conditions, including immunocompromised patients residing on oncology and transplant units, are also at increased risk of colonization and infection with VRE strains. An increased length of hospitalization and antibiotic use contribute to the patient\u2019s risk [70]. Although vancomycin use is a predisposing factor for the acquisition of the organism, any antimicrobial agent that alters the normal gram-positive and anaerobic gut flora may allow VRE to flourish [66, 67]. In Europe, a glycopeptide (avoparcin) that is used in animal feeds has been associated with VRE in animals and humans. Antibiotics with antianaerobic activity have been shown to promote VRE high-density colonization both in animal models and in humans [70]. Both vancomycin and third-generation cephalosporins reportedly are independently associated with VRE prevalence in 126 intensive care units in the USA [71]. Reports have demonstrated the contact spread of the bacteria from patient to patient, both directly and indirectly via the hands of healthcare workers [72, 73]. Contaminated equipment and environmental surfaces are also sources for disease transmission [74].",

When a vancomycin-resistant strain is identified, the infection control department, the patient\u2019s physician, and unit personnel should be notified. Those patients who are colonized or infected should be placed in single rooms, or they may be cohorted with other VRE-positive patients. Because the bacteria may colonize the intestinal tract, patients with poor personal hygiene or fecal incontinence may contaminate the environment with the bacteria. Patients may also contaminate their immediate environment by touching surfaces, such as bed rails, nurse call buttons, and television controls. This type of equipment may not be adequately disinfected after the patient leaves, increasing the risk of transmission for the next patient. The recommendation is that gloves and gowns should be worn when one is entering the room of colonized patients, especially in endemic settings. Some groups report significant decreases in VRE infection and VRE colonization after the institution of enhanced infection control measures in conjunction with judicious restriction of certain antibiotics, such as vancomycin and third-generation cephalosporins [79, 80].",

Patients may be screened for VRE carriage by the collection of rectal swabs or stool for cultures or PCR testing to identify additional cases. This information is useful for determining transmission between roommates or to others on a unit where infected patients have been identified. Despite the institution of contact precautions for carriers, the incidence of carriage may remain about the same [69]. VRE colonization may persist for long periods [82]; therefore, colonized or infected patients may require continuous isolation until their discharge.

Among liver transplant recipients, patients who underwent surgery within the prior 2 weeks were at markedly higher risk for MRSA infection [87]. A review of infections occurring from 1990 to 1998 in another liver transplant center in the USA showed that 23% of organ recipients became infected with MRSA, with significant increases in the incidence and prevalence of patients infected with MRSA over time [88]. The primary sites of infection were the vascular catheter (39%), the wound (18%), the abdomen (18%), and the lung (13%). CMV seronegativity (P = 0.01) and primary CMV infection were significantly associated with MRSA infections (P = 0.005). Although relatively uncommon, donor-derived MRSA transmission has been described following liver transplantation [89].\n",

The authors were able to prove transmission between patients with the use of an immunoblot technique, and they documented clustering in patient rooms with two occupants. Other authors have suggested other patterns of acquisition in situations in which no evidence of transmission to roommates exists [121].

Patient transport outside the unit should be minimized if the patient has diarrhea to avoid contaminating other areas with the bacterial spores. Good hand hygiene is essential.

Staff members must observe proper procedures, and visitors should be encouraged to wash their hands thoroughly before leaving the patient\u2019s room. A dilute (1:10) hypochlorite solution or a product with an EPA-approved claim for C. difficile activity should be considered in units with high C. difficile rates [6]. During outbreaks, environmental decontamination, isolation or cohorting of infected patients, and the limitation of clindamycin have significantly reduced CDD [125]. The use of dedicated patient equipment or of disposables, such as rectal thermometers, may significantly reduce the incidence of CDD in both acute and chronic care facilities and should be used whenever possible [126].\n",

Therefore, the use of the tuberculin skin test (TST) to monitor transplant recipients rarely provides useful information. Important information is provided when conversion from negative to positive tuberculin skin testing occurs, but negative results do not rule out infection. Furthermore, the value of the anergy testing is in question and is no longer recommended to be done routinely [145, 148]. Even when the patient reacts to one of the other antigens and his or her TST test is negative, the patient may still have latent infection or even active TB.

Using PCR, Sawyer et al. confirmed VZV DNA in 82% of air samples collected in varicella patient rooms and in 70% of air samples collected in zoster patient rooms [161]. In a few samples, the virus was detected outside the door of negatively pressurized isolation rooms. Although this may represent a failure of the ventilation system to maintain negative pressurization of the room or of staff members leaving the door to the room open, obviously aerosolization of the viral particles does occur.

In a series of three adult liver transplant recipients who developed varicella hepatitis, one patient died after developing adult respiratory distress syndrome and disseminated intravascular coagulation [162]. The introduction of a vaccine has significantly reduced varicella-zoster morbidity and mortality. Its use has been expanded since 1999 to include HIV-infected children with CD4 percentage of 15\u201324% and adults with CD4 count of at least 200 cells/\u03bcL [163]. There are two vaccines currently available: Varivax, a single-antigen varicella vaccine, and ProQuad, a combination of varicella and MMR vaccines. The latter contains more virus than the former vaccine [164]. Varicellavaccine is contraindicated in the transplant recipients, because it is made from a live, attenuated virus. However, the experience with leukemic children has shown that the vaccine is safe and effective [163]. Some reports have also demonstrated that the live, attenuated vaccine is safe and efficacious in susceptible pediatric kidney transplant recipients [165]. Researchers in that study administered the vaccine at candidacy; the results showed a reduced incidence of varicella after transplantation. There are also some reports of vaccination after transplantation. In one of these, seroconversion occurred in 20 of 31 (64.5%) children; 7 required multiple doses and only minor local skin reactions were observed [166]. The risk that healthy individuals will develop a rash after vaccination and transmit it to an immunosuppressed patient is low, and, therefore, vaccinating susceptible individuals, including healthcare workers, living in the same household with transplant recipients is not contraindicated [164]. The vaccine manufacturer does recommend that healthcare workers who develop vesicles should not care for susceptible individuals. Although some have hypothesized that the vaccine strain of virus may not be capable of causing secondary infections, a few such cases have been documented [167, 168]. The general consensus is that the benefits of vaccination of household contacts of immunocompromised individuals outweigh the very low risk of transmission of the vaccine virus to the transplant recipient. Varicella vaccine is also used in healthy persons as a post-exposure preventive measure, mostly in unvaccinated children, ideally within 3\u20135 days after exposure [169].\n",

Although breakthrough infection aftervaricella-zoster immunoglobulin (VZIG) administration was common, its use ameliorated the severity of the disease. In one study in a SOT pediatric population receiving VZIG (median age of 8 years), 55% developed varicella, but only 4% developed severe disease [171]. The usual dosage is 125 units for each 10 kg of weight, up to a maximum of 625 units. If another exposure occurs more than 3 weeks after the administration of the VZIG dose, an additional dose of VZIG should be administered to provide continued passive immunity [169]. Patients who get monthly high-dose IVIG (>400 mg/kg) are protected if the last dose was given less than 3 weeks before exposure [161]. Because varicella immune globulin could prolong the incubation period by \u22651 week, patients given VariZIG should be monitored for signs or symptoms of varicella for 28 days after exposure. Antiviral therapy should be started as soon as signs or symptoms of varicella occur. Acyclovir\nmay also prevent or attenuate infection after VZV exposure and may constitute a valid alternative, especially in those cases that come to medical attention more than 10 days after exposure. Some authors have advocated using it with VZIG in cases where life-threatening VZV infection is possible, such as in children with renal disease who are receiving steroids [172]. Acyclovir is FDA approved for the treatment of varicella in healthy children. The American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) recommends consideration of acyclovir treatment of individuals at risk of moderate or severe varicella [173]. The value of\nacyclovir as a prophylactic agent in the immunocompromised host is unclear; VariZIG is recommended after exposure of these individuals to VZV. There is limited data to support the use of acyclovir for post-exposure prophylaxis in healthy children [174] though some experts support this approach in immunocompromised patients, particularly if VariZIG is unavailable. \n",

This is based on the average incubation period of 14 days and the knowledge that transmission may occur up to 5 days before and 6 days after the onset of the rash [176]. Susceptible healthcare workers who are exposed to VZV put their transplant recipients at risk, but their furloughed absences also have cost implications and cause disruptions of patient care [177]. Therefore, CDC recommends the vaccination of susceptible healthcare workers if no contraindications are identified [178]. Healthcare workers who receive acyclovir prophylaxis may exhibit a longer incubation period before the development of a rash. Maintaining accurate records of employee data concerning vaccination or a previous history of chickenpox is important. Susceptible employees should be actively encouraged to receive varicella vaccine.\n",

There is variability of onset of infection from year to year as well as between various regions in the USA [185]. For example, in Florida, the RSV season comes earlier and lasts longer [186]. The virus may be spread in nurseries, causing severe respiratory infection in infants who have underlying medical conditions, such as bronchopulmonary dysplasia, congenital heart disease, or prematurity [187]. Viral shedding usually lasts for a week, but this period may be longer in infants who are younger than 1 month of age or in those with pneumonia [188].

Successful cohorting requires the early diagnosis of RSV when the epidemic is starting in the community.

At the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center, influenza was more prevalent among lung transplant recipients than it was among other organ recipients [202]. Secondary bacterial pneumonia occurred in 17% of the patients with influenza. Other complications occurred in three patients, including myocarditis, myositis, and bronchiolitis obliterans. Reports of transplant recipients who received the influenza vaccine but who developed influenza despite vaccination have been published [203]. This is due to the suboptimal response of transplant recipients to protein vaccines, and it raises the question of the use of antiviral chemoprophylaxis in the future. During the H1N1 April 2009 influenza A pandemic, of the reported 237 solid organ transplant recipients with H1N1, 32% developed pneumonia, 16% were admitted to ICU, and 4% died [204]. Organ recipients, their families, and the healthcare providers must realize the importance of receiving the annual inactivated influenza vaccine to reduce the risk of disease transmission. CDC, the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP), and the HICPAC recommended that all US healthcare workers get annual influenza vaccine [205]. The live, attenuated influenza vaccine (LAIV) administered as a nasal spray is not recommended for immunocompromised patients but may be given to close contacts of immunosuppressed individuals, though persons caring for patients in a protective environment should avoid contact with such patients for at least 7 days after receipt ofLAIV [206].",

Several viruses are associated with gastroenteritis, including rotavirus, norovirus, enteric adenovirus, caliciviruses, enteric coronavirus, and astrovirus [210]. Rotaviruses and noroviruses are the most epidemiologically significant agents of the gastroenteritis viruses, causing endemic and epidemic disease throughout the world. In particular, the rotaviruses have been associated with outbreaks in children and in developing countries where they have been associated with high mortality rates [211]. The symptoms often include vomiting, diarrhea, and dehydration. Fever may be present. Dehydration may be severe enough to require hospitalization for intravenous fluid replacement. The incubation period ranges from 1 to 3 days, with symptoms usually lasting less than 1 week. The transmission of rotavirus occurs through the fecal\u2013oral route, with maximum viral shedding in the stool occurring 2\u20135 days after the onset of diarrhea. Nosocomial infections have been associated with the insufficient use of appropriate infection control measures. Rotavirus infections represent between 20% and 40% of the cases of nosocomial diarrhea in children [212, 213]. There has been an association between rotavirus gastroenteritis and rejection of small bowel allograft but this may have been related to decrease in immunosuppressive agents due to diarrhea [214, 215]. In the USA, most infections occur in children between the ages of 6 and 24 months after maternal antibody protection wanes [216]. Infections occur more frequently between October and April. Usually, the virus produces a self-limited diarrhea; however, premature infants and transplant recipients may develop severe disease [210]. Although rotaviruses do not generally cause bloody stool, fecal occult blood loss has been reported in pediatric liver transplant recipients [217].\n",

An investigation in day care centers with rotavirus outbreaks demonstrated the virus by PCR on toys (39%) and environmental surfaces (21%) [217]. Rotavirus may be transmitted to the patients by aerosols. Contamination of inanimate objects occurs not only by feces but also by aerosols generated by bedpan cleaning [211]. Patient-to-patient transmission may result in mini-epidemics within the hospital [210]. Adult contacts of patients with rotavirus may exhibit subclinical illness [213]. Infection control measures should be instituted promptly whenever patients are incontinent or develop diarrhea. Standard precautions are adequate unless the patient is incontinent or diapered; contact precautions should be added in such cases. Good hand hygiene is essential, with glove and gown usage for patient contact if fecal contamination is likely. Cleaning of room surfaces with an EPA-registered hospital disinfectant is adequate for cleaning of surfaces in the patient\u2019s room [5]. The institution of infection control measures interrupted an outbreak in a pediatric oncology ward that was presumed to have occurred through contaminated toys [218]. These included contact precautions, and the daily cleaning of playroom with a dilute bleach solution.\n",

In February 2006, a new vaccine, RotaTeq (Merck and Co.), was licensed in the USA. This is an oral live vaccine which was developed from human and bovine virus and has not been associated with intussusception [220]. It is given in three doses at 2, 4, and 6 months with completed administration by 32 weeks of age. A second vaccine Rotarix (GlaxcoSmithKline) was licensed in April 2008. It is live attenuated oral vaccine and is given to infants in two doses at 2 and 4 months infants. The two vaccines are equivalent. Although the original studies have not shown an association, post-licensure studies did demonstrate low risk of intussusception in certain populations [221], and support for use of the vaccine is universal. Between November 2007 and May 2008, delayed onset and reduced rate of rotavirus infection was observed [222], attributed to the introduction of the rotavirus vaccine. There are no data available regarding the safety and efficacy of this vaccine in immunosuppressed infants. It is believed that infants who live in the same household with immunosuppressed patients can still be vaccinated despite the small risk of transmission of the vaccine rotavirus [219].\n",
