Incorporating these 4 factors, the nomogram achieved good concordance indexes of 0.86 (95%CI 0.81 -0.91), and had well-fitted calibration curves. A novel scoring model, named as CALL, was established, and its area under ROC was 0.91 (95% CI 0.86 to 0.94). Using a cutoff value of 6 points, the positive and negative predictive values were 50.7% (38.9% -62.4%) and 98.5% (94.7% -99.8%), respectively.",

Huang et al [4] first reported clinical manifestations of 41 patients infected with SARS-CoV-2 and observed that ICU patients had higher plasma levels of cytokines compared with non-ICU patients. Chen et al [5] found that the infection more likely affected older males with comorbidities. Wang et al [6] compared clinical parameters of severe and non-severe cases in 138 hospitalized patients. Again, patients who required ICU care were significantly older and more likely to have underlying comorbidities, such as hypertension, diabetes, cardiovascular disease and cerebrovascular disease. However, all above studies were single center and univariate analysis-based studies without considering the influence of confounding factors because of small sample sizes. Therefore, clarifying the independent high-risk factors with multivariate analysis and establishing an accurate prediction of progression of COVID-19 become desirable. In the present study, we used COX proportional regression and nomogram to provide an evidence-based, factors-weighted, highly accurate risk estimation model to help clinicians to better choose therapeutic strategy. To our knowledge, this scoring prediction model is the first nomogram for progressive risk estimation in patients with COVID-19.",

Written informed consent was waived in view of the designated hospital for new emerging infectious diseases. Both FYSPH in Anhui Province and the fifth medical center of PLAGH in Beijing (center two) were assigned as COVID-19 treatment center on January 20, 2020. Patients presenting with severe COVID-19 were excluded. For this retrospective, non-interventional study, we enrolled all patients with confirmed COVID-19 admitted to either of the two centers since January 20, 2020. COVID-19 was diagnosed based on the WHO interim guidance [7] and guidance for corona virus disease 2019 issued by National Health Commission of China [8] . The presence of SARS-CoV-2 in respiratory specimens was confirmed using real-time reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) assay by local district level and municipal Center for Diseases Prevention and Control (CDC), as described previously [4] . The exclusion criteria were primary infection by other pathogens, such as bacteria, fungi, other respiratory virus, mycoplasma, or chlamydia. Comorbidity was defined as having at least one of the followings: hypertension, diabetes, cardiovascular disease, liver disease, asthma, chronic lung disease, HIV infections and malignancy for at least 6 months. Severe COVID-19 was defined as at least one of the followings, respiratory rate \u2265 30 breaths/min, resting oxygen saturation \u2264 93%, PaO2/FiO2 \u2264 300 mmHg or requirement of mechanical ventilation. Progression to severe COVID-19 was development of one or more of the above or worsening of lung CT findings during the observation period. ",

The laboratory parameters, including complete blood count, coagulation profile, liver and renal function, lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) and procalcitonin (PCT) were examined at admission. The O2 saturation was measured by pulse oxygen saturation on room air at rest state and confirmed by blood gas test. Respiratory specimens, including nasal and pharyngeal swabs, or sputum were tested for influenza, avian influenza, respiratory syncytial virus, adenovirus, parainfluenza virus using real-time RT-PCR assays approved by the China Food and Drug Administration. CURB-65 severity score [9] was calculated for each subject. All patients were examined by chest X-ray or CT scan. Clinical outcomes (progression of illness, days to progression, mortality, discharges, and length of hospital stay) were monitored up to March 18, 2020.
