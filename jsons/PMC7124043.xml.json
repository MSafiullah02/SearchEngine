The H1N1 pandemic, SARS, Ebola epidemic, and Zika pandemic are recent global events of public health concern (Fineberg 2014; Dixon et al. 2014; Fauci and Morens 2016). In addition, other local crises such as the US opioid epidemic (US Department of Health and Human Services 2017), have reinforced the need to establish bidirectional communications between clinical practices and public health authorities. As a result, organized healthcare has established and adopted protocols to rapidly handle patients and related risks adequately. It is now common in clinical practices to hear the question \u201chave you travelled abroad recently?\u201d or \u201chave you been to places experiencing a public health emergency?\u201d Furthermore, guidance from public health authorities can be seen posted throughout halls or clinical spaces in practices. These messages and warnings are now also part of electronic health records and patients are questioned and treated accordingly. Public health authorities (federal, state, and local) continue to develop strategies to reach both clinicians and the general public and having the capacity to handle electronic health record data is a high priority for all of them.",

This is not to take away from other traditional public health surveillance approaches and very successful interventions (such as national surveys and water fluoridation), yet in the case of dentistry and biosurveillance, there is plenty of room to grow and integrate.",

This meeting reviewed several aspects of bioterrorism and the dental profession: the nature of biological pathogens and its oral manifestations, what needed to be communicated, how dentists should participate, etc. Dr. Michael C. Alfano described the difficulties that biological pathogens create for clinicians because \u201cthey are so insidious.\u201d While discussing the anthrax mailings after September 11th he pointed out that: \u201c\u2026 early symptoms appeared so they resembled the aches, fever, and malaise of flu so those affected delayed seeking treatment, a delay that has proven fatal in some cases\u201d. Lieutenant Colonel Ross H. Pastel of the US Army Medical Research Institute of Infectious Disease (USAMRIID) listed the \u201cCategory A\u201d pathogens as defined by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, and those are: smallpox, anthrax, plague, botulinum toxin, tularemia, and viral hemorrhagic fever. He also described an outbreak of smallpox in Yugoslavia in 1972 and the measures that had to be taken to control it. Dr. Michael Glick described the oral manifestations of smallpox showing \u201csigns 24 h before skin rash. These oral signs include tongue swelling, multiple mucosa vesicles, ulceration, and mucosal hemorrhaging. Oral signs are also evident in inhalation and gastro-intestinal anthrax. In oropharyngeal anthrax the mucosa appears edematous and congested; there may be neck swelling, fever, and sore throat\u201d.",

Such surveillance\u2014knowing what to look for and whom to report to\u2014is critical and applies not only to suspected bioterrorist agents, but to a list of reportable diseases which has grown to include such entities as West Nile virus and Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS).\u201d Dr. Sigurs O. Krolls presented the response at the local level and he \u201cstressed the importance of communication and the need for redundant systems\u201d, \u201cto keep all the parties informed\u201d. He also posed the question \u201cCan dentists recognize signs and systems of contagious diseases?\u201d, and emphasized that education is essential. Dr. Louis DePaola made several recommendations that can be key in the scope of this paper by saying \u201cdentists can contribute to bioterrorism surveillance by being alert to clues that might indicate a bioterrorism attack. Such surveillance would note if there is an influx of people seeking medical attention with non-traumatic conditions and flu-like or possibly neurological or paralytic symptoms\u2026 or even specific signs of a bioterrorist agent. Patterns of school or work absence, appointment cancellations or failures to appear, could also be indicators.\u201d Dr. DePaola made clear that in cases of limited release of bioterrorist agents, dentists \u201chave little to offer\u201d but \u201ca widespread attack can certainly tap into dental professional skills in recognition, isolation and management\u201d. In addition, Dr. Guay (Guay 2002) lists all the possible roles in which dentists can participate including \u201ceducation, risk communication, diagnosis, surveillance and notification, treatment, distribution of medications, decontamination, sample collection and forensic dentistry.\u201d",

He also acknowledges that one of the advantages of this type of documentation is that it \u201cis much more transportable\u201d. He also recognizes the need for standardized methods for collecting information from dentists. Schleyer and Eisner (1997) defined several scenarios where the COHR is used in a \u201cshared\u201d environment where several healthcare providers interact and information is seamlessly communicated, improving the decisions made by clinicians. Delrose and Steinberg (2000) discuss how the \u201cDigital Patient Record\u201d enhances clinical practice by providing \u201cbetter quality information\u201d to the clinician. Although all of these benefits sound promising and encouraging some still express concern about the lack of standards among different information systems, which translates into communication breakdowns (Schleyer 2003). On the other hand, Heid et al. (2002) list all the steps that are currently being taken by different organizations such as the ADA in order to produce a standardized COHR. Other examples of standardization can be found in a paper presented by Narcisi (1996) where ADA\u2019s participation as a voting member in the American National Standards Institute has allowed EDI or the COHR to be discussed and improved at a national level, now much commonly known as the Electronic Dental Record or EDR .",

This is just one example of how a system could provide assistance in the detection of a bioterrorism incident.",

RODS Lab uses data obtained directly from chief complaints in the emergency departments of hospitals to construct time series and other forms of aggregated data, to characterize the health status of a specific population.

Although, at that time his medical history showed no indication of a systemic disease, the presence of multiple oral vesicles prompted the dentist to make an annotation into the COHR . The system, by using a natural language processing engine, detected the sign and sent this information to a central database. The patient was discharged and instructed to take some support medication to treat the oral ulcers. The next day, the central database pinpointed the presence of an out of the ordinary increase in the number of cases with the same signs and symptoms around that region. When the presence of this peak was detected, the central server sent a request to the dentist\u2019s computer for additional information. One of the requested elements was if there was any use of medication for treating oral ulcers. Fortunately, this information was available. The central database crossed this with the information of other surveillance systems together with the information from other patients that happened to have similar clinical signs and/or symptoms.

The NJDOH utilized their NJ Discharge Data Collection System (NJDDCS) to identify the other cases using ICD-9 billing diagnostic codes. This lead to the identification of 15 cases linked to the practice. Due to the time that had passed since the original cases occurred, there was no chance to use molecular sequencing or matching. As a result of the infection, 12 patients underwent surgery and one died. This is an example, where, in the future, biosurveillance systems could play a significant role in identifying real time or near real time increases of cases (or in an expanded geographical area) that compel further investigation. Again, biosurveillance systems could be of benefit, not only in extreme circumstances (like catastrophic man made public health events), but also as part of ongoing public health activities.",

Goldenberg et al. (2002) described over-the-counter medication sales as a technique for discovering disease outbreaks and stated that their approach may be \u201cmore timely\u201d than traditional medical or public health approaches. Medical cases that result from bioterrorism attacks do not produce symptoms until they have fully developed, so it is likely that different patterns can be detected before the patients start reaching the Emergency Department. In the case of dentistry, Torres-Urquidy et al. (2009) established that using oral manifestations may allow for detecting a bioterrorism event up to 24 h prior to other signals using other forms of surveillance.",
