H. pylori sialic acid-binding haemagglutinin(s) represent a group of such putative cell surface adhesins, proposed to be crucial for the bacterial colonisation of the stomach [4].",

            "text": "Gastrointestinal mucins, high molecular mass glycoproteins which are synthesised and secreted by mucus cells of the human stomach and intestine, show regional variations in composition and expression. The terminal region of O-glycosidically linked carbohydrate chains consist of sialic acid, fucose and N-acetylgalactosamine in addition to galactose and N-acetylglucosamine [5]. An increase in sialylation has been demonstrated for mucosal cells infected with H. pylori\n[6]. A possible association between the occurrence of O-acetylated sialic acids in intestinal metaplasia and H. pylori infection has also been reported [7]. Controversial results on the role of sialic acids and sulfate for H. pylori binding to gastric mucins have been reported. For example, in one study the influence of sulfation of gastric mucins for H. pylori binding to gastric mucosa has been shown excluding the role of sialic acids in haemagglutination inhibition assays [8]. In contrast, H. pylori binding to human gastric mucin in an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay was demonstrated to be at least partly sialic acid-dependent [9]. Also for human salivary mucins the importance of both sialylated [10]and sulfated [10]components as receptor structures for H. pylori adhesion has been reported. In addition, the expression of different binding characteristics depending on growth conditions of the bacteria has been demonstrated. For example, two different sialic acid-binding adhesins were described for agar- and broth-cultured bacteria with the specificities for sialylated glycoproteins and sialylated glycosylceramides [11].",

Fat globule membranes (MFGM-1) were prepared from bovine buttermilk obtained from a butter-making plant of Snow Brand Milk Products Co. Ltd. To remove casein by coagulation, rennet treatment was done at pH 6.2. HR-rennet (0.003% w/v) (Christian Hansen, The Netherlands) was added under mild agitation and then incubated at 30\u00b0C for 27 min until most of the casein was coagulated to form curd. After cutting the curd the mixture was heated slowly for 40 min to a final temperature of 40\u00b0C and kept at this temperature for a further 60 min. Subsequently, the curd was separated from whey containing MFGM using a filter cloth. Prepared whey solution was recirculated through a microfilter membrane (Carbosep M-14; 0.14 \u03bcm pore size, Techsep, France) to remove proteins and carbohydrates from the whey and to concentrate MFGM in the retentate. Diafiltration was performed by concentrating the whey to 30% of its original volume then washing with water 4 times the volume of the retentate under the following operating conditions: flow rate, 600 l min\u22121; trans-membrane pressure, 2 kg cm\u22122; temperature, 50\u00b0C, and lyophilised and used as MFGM-1. This material was delipidated to give MFGM-2 by extraction with chloroform:methanol (1:1) followed by chloroform:methanol (2:1). Glyco-macropeptide (GMP) from bovine milk was prepared from bovine milk as described [13]. Sialyl(\u03b1-2,3)-lactose was prepared from bovine colostrum as described [14].",

By far the best inhibitors were the gastric mucins (compare data in Table 1, Table 2, Table 3). The inhibitory activities of gastric mucins were affected by sialidase treatment indicating the importance of sialic acids of these mucins for the recognition by H. pylori sialic acid-dependent strains. The residual inhibitory activities of the mucins after the removal of sialic acids could be explained by sulfate present in mucin preparations as binding sites for a corresponding adhesin of H. pylori. But obviously the presence of sialic acid residues on the gastric mucins strongly enhances the interaction with H. pylori strains expressing sialic acid-dependent adhesins.",
