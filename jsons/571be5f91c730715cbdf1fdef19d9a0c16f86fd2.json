The mode of infection is caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus entering cells via the human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor, which is expressed predominantly in the lungs but also throughout the cardiovascular system. 1 Thus, while its most virulent manifestation is acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), select reports from Europe and China have demonstrated cardiac injury reflected by elevated troponin concentrations among infected patients. [2] [3] [4] [5] Troponin elevation in these limited case series was associated with worse outcomes in patients hospitalized with COVID-19. 6 However, major gaps exist in our current understanding of the underlying mechanisms by which SARS-CoV-2 affects the cardiovascular system and how such involvement impacts clinical outcomes. First, the range of troponin elevation across different subpopulations based on history of cardiovascular disease (CVD) compared to those without history of CVD is unknown in patients in the United States (US). Second, whether these troponin elevations represent primary myocardial infarction, supply-demand inequity, or nonischemic myocardial injury remains unclear. We sought to explore these two aims amongst a large cohort of patients hospitalized with Covid-19 in New York City.",

Evidence for myocardial injury was more frequent in our patients compared to two recent reports from China, one with 416 patients and the other with 187 patients, which noted prevalence of 20% and 28%, respectively. 2,14 Similar to these smaller reports, we also noted that patients with myocardial injury tended to be older, have a history of CVD, lower hemoglobin values, higher inflammatory markers, and more frequent rates of tachycardia or hypo/hypertension. This observation tends to support a theory that troponin elevation associated with COVID-19 is more likely to be consistent with non-ischemic myocardial injury as opposed to dramatic acute coronary syndrome or myocarditis.",
