A meta-analysis showed that avoiding NMBA was associated with an increased risk of both a difficult tracheal intubation and an upper airway injury [2]. Because these complications could lead to subsequent negative outcomes, such as reintubation or tracheostomy, it is important to examine the effects of avoiding NMBA for urgent tracheal intubation. This is especially true in emergency departments (EDs) in Japan, where using NMBA for emergency airway management is not very common [3] (although we do use NMBA in our ED). Despite the potential benefit of this modifiable intervention, however, it remains unclear whether the avoidance of NMBA is associated with subsequent negative in-hospital outcomes.",

The study\u2019s setting, methods of measurement, and measured variables have been previously described [8, 9]. From the registry, we collected information about adverse events during intubation (including hypoxemia, defined as a pulse oximetry saturation < 90%; hypotension, defined as a systolic blood pressure < 90 mmHg; esophageal intubation; and the presence of an airway injury, defined as any oral, laryngeal, and/or pharyngeal edema, laceration, bleeding, or dental injury related to the intubation procedure); methods, devices, and medications used for airway management; whether intubation was performed during cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR); predictors for difficult intubation (such as an abnormal facial shape, including those due to facial injury and anatomic abnormalities; neck mobility limitations; airway obstruction, except for sputum and glossoptosis; and a mouth opening of less than three finger breadths); the Cormack\u2013Lehane grade [10]; the level of training and specialty of the intubator; and the number of intubation attempts. The number of intubation attempts was defined as the number of insertions of the laryngoscope past the teeth. In the JEAN2 database, the intensivists in our institution were registered as emergency physicians due to the lack of such items for that study. All intensivists in our institution complete a fellowship for emergency physicians and become board-certified emergency physicians.",

To account for potential confounders, we adjusted for age, sex, the performance of cardiopulmonary arrest before intubation, an abnormal facial shape, the presence of an airway obstruction, and neck mobility limitations. We also considered obesity as a potential confounder, and patients with a body mass index \u2265 30 kg/m2 were excluded from analysis because the numbers of these patients were extremely low, especially in the non-NMBA group. A previous study reported an association between reintubation and a higher incidence of tracheostomy [11].

These findings suggest that airway injuries were more likely to develop due to certain mechanisms among the patients with a higher risk for tracheostomy. We a posteriori hypothesized that the variables associated with difficult intubation (i.e., Cormack\u2013Lehan grade, the number of predictors for difficult intubation) resulted in an increased risk of airway injury among these patients. However, the distributions of these variables were similar between the high-risk group and the low-risk group, and the number of airway injuries was quite small (Online Resource 2). We should note that it is possible that this information was inaccurate because the injuries were self-reported. Furthermore, the data we collected may be insufficient for evaluating the extent of soft tissue damage during urgent intubation. For example, information about the amount of time required for intubation and how gently intubation was performed is necessary. In addition, minor soft tissue damage is often unrecognized and unreported at the time of intubation, which presents as vocal cord paralysis or laryngeal edema only after extubation, and unreported airway injuries would also more likely lead to the need for tracheostomy. Further studies are needed to validate the potential effect modification observed in this study.",
