This deterioration was attributed to rapidly worsening ARDS. However, it is also important to identify that the high PEEP, which was originally applied to combat ARDS, could have led to increased intrathoracic pressure, ultimately leading to decreased venous return and cardiac output [11]. Furthermore, in pregnancy, despite hypervolemia, the effect of the gravid uterus on inferior vena cava can compromise venous return, which, in combination with a high PEEP, can precipitate hypotension [12]. And hence, the fact that after delivery, her hemodynamic parameters rapidly improved can be attributed to the reduction in oxygen consumption and effective deliverance of preload, thereby leading to an improvement in cardiac output, and ultimately, in gas exchange. While prone positioning has been shown to reduce mortality in patients with severe ARDS by means of improved lung recruitment, data regarding its utility in pregnancy is sparse [[13], [14], [15]]. Due to this reason, we decided against pronating the patient at the time of her rapid deterioration.",

In a recently published review of 37 pregnant mothers with COVID-19 and their 38 newborns, no vertical transmission was reported. Of these, all neonates with confirmed COVID-19 had been infected after birth, via droplet or contact transmission [10]. In our case, the patient was intubated at the time of delivery, making droplet transmission unlikely. The babies were delivered via C-section, eliminating the possibility of fetal contact with maternal feces, which has been reported as a mode of transmission. During delivery, appropriate sterilization techniques and precautions were utilized, and any maternal contact with the neonates was avoided. Both the neonates were transferred to the NICU immediately after birth. They were not breastfed, and appropriate aerosol and contact precautions were utilized during their handling in the NICU. Twin A tested positive and Twin B tested negative for COVID-19 at 72 h. Due to the reasons above, we believe that Twin A tested positive due to vertical transmission. We acknowledge that there are limitations to our theory. Firstly, the placenta and umbilical cord blood were not tested for COVID-19 and, secondly, vertical transmission would have affected both twins, but Twin B, in our case, tested negative.",

COVID-19 has so far proven to be a highly contagious and lethal infection that can lead to rapidly worsening respiratory failure and death in the general population. Our case reflects that pregnant women are certainly as susceptible, if not more, and, hence, these patients should be closely followed by a multidisciplinary team of physicians. Prearranged plans for urgent delivery and neonatal resuscitation should be put in place, in anticipation of spontaneous labor or sudden maternal or fetal decline. While the vertical transmission of infection has not been reported until now, our case prompts us to think that it could certainly be possible and further research is warranted on the subject.",
