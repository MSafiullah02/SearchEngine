In this paper, we apply the SIR model to simulating the propagation dynamics of COVID-19 on the Cape Verde Islands. It will be done firstly for Santiago and Boavista Islands, ant then for Cape Verde in general. The choice of Santiago rests on the fact that it is the largest island, with more than 50% of the Population of the country, whereas Boavista was chosen because it is the island where the first case of COVID-19 in Cape Verde was diagnosed. Observations made after the date of the simulations were carried out corroborates our projections.",

In the same proportion, the worldwide medical class has faced enormous challenges in the search for cures, which usually takes several months and sometimes years to be found. Nowadays, even with all the technological and biotechnological advancement in the medical and pharmaceutical industry of 21 st century, cures have not yet been found for many diseases; a remarkable and classical example is AIDS (caused by HIV) which has no cure yet even after more than thirty years since the first cases were discovered. Based on estimates, in 2020 the Global Health Observatory (GHO) reported 300 thousand deaths by AIDS per year (see GHO [21] ).",

Applying the optim() function to the least-square problem (4) regarding the observed data at Table 5 , the optimal estimates for parameters \u03b2 and \u03b3 was produced and the results summarized in Table 6 . Figures 3 and 4 suggest that the propagation will be increasing for 89 days, reaching a peak of 5822 infected, and at that point it starts to decrease until it disappears from the Cape Verde. The estimated number for total deaths is highlighted in Figure 8 .",

In order to reduce as much as possible the possibility of having notdetected (unidentified) infected individuals spreading the disease, we strongly recommend increasing the number of tests as much as possible, and extend it to other classes such as old people, individuals with disability or comorbidities and health professionals on the ground. We also recommend randomly screening individuals in society. Besides all this, as a complement, we strongly recommend to continue following all the social distance measures at least up to 35 -45 days, and mitigate them as the number of occurrence decreases.",
