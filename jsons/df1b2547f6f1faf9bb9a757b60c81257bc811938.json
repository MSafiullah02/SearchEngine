Blood samples were collected on the enrollment day, from 2 to 8 days after the onset of illness.

NP-specific binding was detected in all 6 patient samples, whereas M1-specific binding was detected in only 3. In contrast, the IIV PPAb pool only bound to the HA antigen but not to NP or M1. The PPAb from the influenza B virus-infected patient did not bind any of the influenza A virus proteins ( Figure 2A ). We then compared PPAb reactivity to the 3 influenza virus proteins between the A(H1N1)pdm09-infected patients and a group of 15 IIV recipients. Since the precise kinetics of the peripheral plasmablast response in influenza virus infection are not known, the observed reactivity of PPAb samples collected on different days after disease onset might not represent the peak plasmablast response. Therefore, instead of comparing the reactivity to each influenza virus protein directly, we normalized the NP and M1 binding activity to HA reactivity, since HA is the primary antigenic target of IIV. These normalized reactivities provide information about the relative pattern of PPAb responses to different influenza virus proteins. As shown in Figure 2B , the normalized NP reactivity was significantly higher in the A(H1N1)pdm09-infected patients than in the IIV recipients. The mean of normalized binding activity for M1 was also higher in the infected patients than in the IIV recipients, but the difference was not statistically significant, perhaps because of the small sample size and large variability among the infected patients. Taken together, these results indicate that, in addition to a B-cell response to the variable HA, patients infected with A(H1N1)pdm09 developed B-cell responses to the conserved NP that were significantly higher than those mounted by IIV recipients despite the fact that IIV preparations contain large amounts of NP [21, 22] .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 2013, "end": 2017, "text": "[21,", "ref_id": "BIBREF20"}, {"start": 2018, "end": 2021, "text": "22]", "ref_id": "BIBREF21"}], "ref_spans": [{"start": 239, "end": 248, "text": "Figure 2A", "ref_id": "FIGREF2"}, {"start": 550, "end": 559, "text": "Figure 2A", "ref_id": "FIGREF2"}, {"start": 1303, "end": 1312, "text": "Figure 2B", "ref_id": "FIGREF2"}], "section": "Natural A(H1N1)pdm09 Infection Induces B-Cell Responses to Influenza Virus Proteins"}, {"text": "We tested the PPAb samples from A(H1N1)pdm09-infected patients and IIV recipients for their ability to bind full-length HA proteins of 3 influenza A virus strains: the homotypic infecting A(H1N1)pdm09 strain ( pH1), the heterovariant A/ Brisbane/59/2007(H1N1) strain (sH1), and the heterosubtypic avian A/Vietnam/1203/2004(H5N1) strain (H5) and to the HA2 peptide of H5.

In a recent human challenge study with wild-type influenza virus, virus-specific plasmablasts were detected at day 7 after infection [30] . This study did not, however, examine the kinetics of the infectioninduced plasmablast response or the antibody specificities of these plasmablasts. The kinetics of the B-cell response in naturally infected patients is likely to be more variable than the kinetics in volunteers who receive standardized vaccines or who are experimentally challenged with wild-type influenza virus preparations at a prespecified time and dose. This supposition is supported by the report that plasmablast-derived influenza virus-specific monoclonal antibodies were isolated from influenza virus-infected patients 9-31 days after the onset of symptoms [13] . In our current study, we detected substantial PPAb responses in infected patients for several days after the onset of symptoms, although multiple sampling was not performed to identify the peak day. Other limitations of the current study are the lack of randomization in the comparisons of infected versus vaccinated individuals and the seronegative versus seropositive individuals, and the small number and wide age range and underlying diseases of the infected patients examined. The only elderly patient ( patient 1) had substantial PPAb reactivity to NP but not HA; this differed from the response of all the younger patients. We previously reported a weaker plasmablast response in elderly subjects than in younger individuals after immunization with IIV, and HA is the primary antigenic component in this vaccine [31] .

Recently, we reported that LAIV also induces proportionally greater plasmablast responses to NP and variant HA proteins than IIV [17] . Our findings suggest that LAIV immunization recapitulates some distinct qualitative characteristics of wild-type influenza virus infection in terms of B-cell response, but at a much lower magnitude. Thus, wildtype influenza virus and LAIV may induce protective immunity through similar mechanisms that are distinct from those of IIV. Of note, it has been proposed that antibodies targeting conserved virus components, including the stalk domain of HA from the group 1 influenza A viruses [32, 33] and the NP [22] , have potential as the basis of universal influenza vaccines that would offer protection against a broad range of seasonal and pandemic influenza viruses. This is consistent with the data showing that LAIV is superior to IIV in inducing crossprotection [3] . The basis for differences in B-cell responses to influenza virus infection and IIV immunization is currently unknown and should be addressed in future studies that include analyses of immunoglobulin gene sequences and antibody functions of the activated B-cell repertoire at the clonal level [34] and also, of course, T-cell responses.

This information could lead to a new approach for influenza vaccine development that is based on reducing influenza pathogenicity while preserving immunogenicity.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 182, "end": 186, "text": "[35]", "ref_id": "BIBREF34"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "DISCUSSION"}, {"text": "Because of the repeated exposure to influenza virus infection and vaccination, the B-cell response to influenza vaccination is an antigen recall response in almost all individuals [25] , except for very young children who are naive to influenza virus infection and vaccination. Activation of antigen-specific B cells occurs in germinal centers of lymphoid tissues with the help of antigen-specific follicular helper T-cells and results in generation of plasmablasts and switched memory B cells that express high-affinity antibodies [36, 37] . Exposure to a newly emerged strain, such as A(H1N1)pdm09, primes strain-specific B cells and T-cells to generate memory cells that in turn alter the B-cell response to a subsequent vaccination or infection. In the current study, we showed that priming with IIV resulted in diminished strain-specific recall responses to a subsequent IIV immunization, whereas such suppression was not observed in individuals with prior natural A(H1N1)pdm09 infection. LAIV immunization also does not result in detectable differences in the serum antibody and plasmablast responses to IIV or LAIV immunization in the subsequent year [29] . A recent study found that immunization with a live, attenuated avian H5N1 influenza vaccine, which stimulated virtually no serum antibodies, effectively primed the immune system, resulting in a robust serum antibody response to a subsequent immunization with an inactivated H5N1 vaccine including broader cross-reactivity, compared with repeated immunization with the inactivated vaccine alone [38] . In mice primed with a T-cell-dependent antigen, a second immunization with an epitope-matched T-cell independent antigen results in induction of tolerant memory B cells rather than a recall response [39] . A substantial CD4 + T-cell response was detected in volunteers experimentally infected with wild-type influenza viruses [40] . In another human study a specific subset of ICOS + CXCR3 + CXCR5 + CD4 + follicular helper T-cells correlated with the induction of antibodies to IIV in previously primed individuals but not in naive subjects [41] . Thus, deficiencies in the magnitude or functional properties of the CD4 + T-cell repertoire specific for IIV are likely a contributing factor to the reduced B-cell response in repeated IIV immunization. The efficacy of repeated IIV immunization has been an issue of debate for some time [42] [43] [44] [45] [46] . However, this controversy has not previously focused specifically on the generation of humoral immunity in recipients of repeated IIV immunization in comparison to those previously primed by natural infection. Since annual immunization with IIV is common practice, the implication of our findings to the long-term effectiveness of influenza vaccination needs to be carefully evaluated, especially in the context of maximizing protective immunity in vulnerable populations, such as elderly individuals.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 180, "end": 184, "text": "[25]", "ref_id": "BIBREF24"}, {"start": 532, "end": 536, "text": "[36,", "ref_id": "BIBREF35"}, {"start": 537, "end": 540, "text": "37]", "ref_id": "BIBREF36"}, {"start": 1158, "end": 1162, "text": "[29]", "ref_id": "BIBREF28"}, {"start": 1559, "end": 1563, "text": "[38]", "ref_id": "BIBREF37"}, {"start": 1765, "end": 1769, "text": "[39]", "ref_id": "BIBREF38"}, {"start": 1892, "end": 1896, "text": "[40]", "ref_id": "BIBREF39"}, {"start": 2108, "end": 2112, "text": "[41]", "ref_id": "BIBREF40"}, {"start": 2402, "end": 2406, "text": "[42]", "ref_id": "BIBREF41"}, {"start": 2407, "end": 2411, "text": "[43]", "ref_id": "BIBREF42"}, {"start": 2412, "end": 2416, "text": "[44]", "ref_id": "BIBREF43"}, {"start": 2417, "end": 2421, "text": "[45]", "ref_id": "BIBREF44"}, {"start": 2422, "end": 2426, "text": "[46]", "ref_id": "BIBREF45"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "DISCUSSION"}, {"text": "Supplementary materials are available at The Journal of Infectious Diseases online (http://jid.oxfordjournals.org).
