            "text": "The development of shells that protect microbiological systems from a hostile environment yet still allow for exchange of key nutrients was an essential step in the evolution of life [1]. These shells are composed of molecules decorated with both hydrophobic and hydrophilic groups (\u201camphiphiles\u201d) in such a way that in an aqueous environment they assemble into closed, semipermeable shells. An important example are the amphiphilic protein shells that surround viruses [2] as well as many bacteria and most archaea [3]. Cryogenic-based microscopy studies [2] had indicated that these \u201ccapsids\u201d in general are strictly organized, crystallographic structures (usually icosahedral or helical) [4], but this view is being challenged. Thermodynamic studies of viral self-assembly indicate, for the case of the assembly of viruses in solutions with higher protein concentrations, that the interaction energies between capsid proteins (\u201csubunits\u201d) should be no more than a few times the thermal energy at room temperature in order to avoid the production of malformed capsids [5\u20138]. Finite temperature studies also showed that, due to thermal fluctuations, at least some viral capsids are dynamical in nature and that the dynamics plays a role in the life-cycle of the virus [10,11]. Some capsids are even in a molten or \u201cpleomorphic\u201d state [12,13]. Finally, all-atom molecular dynamics (MD) simulations of capsids revealed that they can collapse under the action of thermal fluctuations [19].",

An OPS is defined as a cluster of N orientable and interacting point particles located at ri. An orientation-dependent pair interaction V(ri,ni;rj,nj) acts between particle pairs i and j with a separation vector rij=ri-rj and unit vectors ni and nj describing their orientations [see Fig. 1 (left)]. The oriented pair interaction used in the simulations was V(ri,ni;rj,nj)=Vm(1-e-\u03b1(|rij|-a))2+K|ni-nj|2+K[(ni+nj)r^ij]2.(1)The first term is the Morse pair interaction [22], with binding energy Vm, equilibrium bond distance a, and potential well width 1/\u03b1. The second and third terms are known as the \u201cconormality\u201d and \u201ccocircularity\u201d terms of an OPS system. Together, these two terms are minimized if the two particles have the same orientation and if that shared orientation is perpendicular to the unit vector r^ij that is directed along the separation vector. Only interactions between particles that are nearest neighbors are included, where the set of nearest neighbors can change over time due to thermal fluctuations.",

The latter are disklike groups of either six or five subunits that frequently act as the basic building blocks of a capsid [4,24]. The orientational degrees of freedom correspond to the normals to the capsomers, the depth Vm of the Morse potential to the capsomer binding energy (a few kBT\n[25,26]), and the length scale a to the diameter of a capsomer (a few nanometers [2]). Because the range of the hydrophobic attraction between capsomers is short compared to their diameter, the dimensionless parameter \u03b1a characterizing the width of the Morse potential needs to be significantly larger than one. We used \u03b1a\u22484.621. Next, K is a measure of the bending stiffness of the shell (estimated to be in the range of 102kBT\n[27,28]). Finally, because a large energy penalty is known to obstruct the removal of single capsomers from assembled shells [29], evaporation of particles from the OPS shell is suppressed by a soft fixed-area constraint imposed via the augmented Lagrange multiplier method (see [30], Sec. I).",

If, on the other hand, \u27e8u2(t)\u27e9 increases linearly in time until it reaches R2\u2014which is consistent with particle diffusion\u2014then the shell was assigned to be in a fluid state. Finally, when plots of \u27e8u2(t)\u27e9 showed a random sequence of alternating time intervals of saturation and linear growth for a given simulation run with drastic variations between different runs then the shell was assigned to be in a fluid-solid coexistence state. Examples of these three cases are shown in Fig. 2 for \u03b3=10.6. In the low-temperature solid state, with \u03b2-1=0.1, the shell shape is spherical while in the coexistence regime, with \u03b2-1=0.7, significant large-scale shape fluctuations are visible.

Figure 3(top) shows an example of irreversible collapse induced by thermal crumpling for \u03b3=1847, as indicated by a drastic reduction in volume over time and the production of very irregular shell shapes. In Fig. 3(bottom) this simulation was repeated at a reduced temperature. After a small initial reduction, the shell volume reached a steady state [43]. The low-temperature shell shape is now icosahedral. In Fig. 3(middle), simulations were performed near the critical temperature for collapse.

            "text": "According to TSET, \u03b3 determines the ground-state shape of a thin elastic shell [39] such that for \u03b3 less than a critical value \u03b3B (the \u201cbuckling threshold\u201d) that is in the range of 102\u2013103, the shell has an approximately spherical shape [such as the spherical shape of Fig. 2(bottom)] while for \u03b3 above that threshold, the ground-state shape is approximately polyhedral [such as the icosahedral shape of Fig. 3(bottom)]. As indicated in the phase plot, we find a buckling threshold around \u03b3B\u224375. The discrepancy between the computed and predicted values of the buckling threshold, which has been noted before [45], is a measure of the importance of discreteness effects. To apply TSET to melting, one can combine it with the Lindemann melting criterion (LMC), which states that melting occurs when the rms of the fluctuations of particle displacements exceeds a certain fraction of the equilibrium interparticle spacing a. The LMC is known to work well for melting on flat two-dimensional surfaces [40]. In the regime of harmonic fluctuations, the mean square \u27e8u\u21922\u27e9 of the in-plane fluctuations and the mean square \u27e8f2\u27e9 of the out-of-plane fluctuations can be shown to have the scaling form \u27e8u\u21922\u27e9=(kBT/Y)G\u221eu(\u03b3) and \u27e8f2\u27e9=(kBT/Y)G\u221ef(\u03b3), respectively. The scaling functions G\u221eu(\u03b3) and G\u221ef(\u03b3) are discussed in the Supplemental Material [30], Sec. II. Formally, TSET theory corresponds to the limit of particle shells with N large and a small but with fixed radius R\u223caN1/2. To include discreteness effects, we expanded the three displacement fields in terms of a series of spherical harmonics Y\u2113,m and demanded that the total number of out-of-plane modes N(\u2113max)=(\u2113max+1)2\u2014with \u2113max the maximum value of the quantum number \u2113\u2014equals the number N of particles minus two [46]. For a shell of N=72 particles \u2113max=7 and \u2113max=8 are reasonable choices (since 72 is in the interval between 82 and 92). The corrected scaling function has the same mathematical form as the TSET case but it is larger by an overall constant scale factor in the range of 10\u2013100, depending on the value of \u2113max: discreteness strongly amplifies the effects of thermal fluctuations. The resulting LMC melting temperatures Tm(\u03b3)=Tm0GNu(0)/[GNu(\u03b3)+GNf(\u03b3)] are plotted in Fig. 4 (orange line) with the melting temperature Tm0 for \u03b3=0 treated as a fitting parameter [47]. The resulting fit is reasonable for the range of \u03b3 values over which melting was observed.",

            "text": "According to TSET, elastic shells with large \u03b3 should undergo a collapse transition with increasing temperature [48\u201350]. Physically, this is due to the fact that crumpled shells have a much larger configurational space for shape fluctuations than (nearly) spherical shells so their entropy is much larger as well, while the volume of a crumpled shell with fixed area is correspondingly reduced. For larger \u03b3, the enthalpic cost of crumpling the surface is diminished so a crumpling or collapse transition is to be expected. The collapse of a shell requires overcoming a free energy barrier that according to TSET vanishes when kBT\u03b31/2/\u03ba is about 102 (green dashed line in Fig. 4\n[49,50]). For the crumpling or collapse transition that we observed (red stars), solid shells (but not liquid shells) roughly obeyed this scaling relation except that the value of kBT\u03b31/2/\u03ba had to be decreased by a factor of about 10 (purple line in Fig. 4). We interpret this as a discreteness effect similar to the one encountered for the melting transition. In the range of \u03b3\u223c103\u2212104 the fitted thin-shell elasticity theory (purple line) provides a reasonable estimate for the collapse transition. Small discrepancies with the molecular dynamics simulation (red stars) are attributed to thermally activated escape events over the energy barrier [50]. This is reflected in the middle panel of Fig. 3, where shell volumes exhibit large fluctuations, with some shells undergoing a first-order-like collapse transition (blue time trace), while other shells remained stable over the simulated time interval. In the range of \u03b3\u223c102\u2013103 there is a much larger discrepancy between the thin-shell elasticity and molecular dynamics simulations. For these values of \u03b3 the collapse transition is in the same range as the melting transition. The unbound dislocation pairs that are forming during melting may significantly affect the collapse transition and this effect is not captured in the TSET.",

            "text": "As an example how the phase plot Fig. 4 could be applied to viral capsids, we compared the N=72 OPS with what is known about the phase properties of viral capsids having 72 capsomers. It should be noted that our phase plot corresponds to empty viral capsids, while the effect of osmotic pressure due to the packaged DNA would increase both the melting and collapse temperatures due to the suppression of radial fluctuations as discussed in [49]. In the Caspar-Klug classification of capsids, icosahedral shells with 72 capsomers are known as \u201cT=7\u201d structures [4]. Medically important T=7 viruses are the human polyoma and papilloma unenvelopeded double-stranded DNA viruses, which both have a diameter of about 50 nm [51]. Because the polyoma and papilloma capsids are quite spherical, the value of \u03b3 should, for these two cases, lie below the buckling threshold in Fig. 4. In contrast, two forms of the capsid of the T=7 thermostable DNA bacteriophage P23-45 with diameters of 66 and 82 nm are, respectively, weakly and strongly polyhedral [52]. This progression of T=7 shapes straddling the buckling threshold could be understood within TSET by noting that \u03b3 scales as the square of the shell diameter. According to Fig. 4, in the relevant regime of \u03b2-1\u22431\n[5,6], capsids should be rather unstable in this part of the phase plot: prone both to melting and collapse. In actuality these viruses are known to be quite stable but this is because of a post-assembly maturation process, during which the capsid subunits are linked together by covalent bonds. The initial procapsids of the T=7 viruses, which are not yet bonded together, still could be thermodynamically unstable. Interestingly, the assembly of the procapsids of phages typically takes place on a preformed spherical scaffold that is disassembled during maturation [52]. It is very suggestive that one purpose of the scaffold is to prevent this instability. This could be checked experimentally by a study of the thermodynamic stability of self-assembling mutant T=7 empty shells for which maturation and/or scaffold formation is blocked. Instability of the procapsid of the related, but much larger, T=13 Herpes-Simplex virus should be even more pronounced.",

Three separate simulation runs are shown in each case (orange, blue, and green respectively). Bottom: for low temperatures (\u03b2-1=0.1), \u27e8u2(t)\u27e9 reaches a constant value after a short transient (ordered solid state). Top: for high temperatures (\u03b2-1=1.6), \u27e8u2(t)\u27e9 is proportional to time for the three runs, indicating diffusion (fluid state). Middle: for intermediate temperatures (\u03b2-1=0.7) the mean square displacements curves alternate between intervals where \u27e8u2(t)\u27e9 steadily increases in time and intervals where it is roughly constant (fluid-solid coexistence). The blue curve is partitioned in this manner. Snapshots on the right correspond to the final configurations for the simulation runs in blue color.",

The orange line marks the melting temperature obtained from a combination of the Lindemann criterion and thin-shell elasticity theory (TSET). The red stars mark the onset of irreversible collapse obtained from the simulations.
