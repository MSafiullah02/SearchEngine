For a specific class of CMP processes, which represents a generalization of degree-ordered percolation, we derive a scaling solution on uncorrelated complex networks, unveiling the existence of diverse mechanisms leading to the formation of a percolating cluster. The scaling solution accurately reproduces universal properties of the transition. This finding is used to infer the critical properties of the susceptible-infected-susceptible model for epidemics in infinite and finite power-law distributed networks. Here, discrepancies between analytical approaches and numerical results regarding the finite-size scaling of the epidemic threshold are a crucial open issue in the literature. We find that the scaling exponent assumes a nontrivial value during a long preasymptotic regime. We calculate this value, finding good agreement with numerical evidence. We also show that the crossover to the true asymptotic regime occurs for sizes much beyond currently feasible simulations. Our findings allow us to rationalize and reconcile all previously published results (both analytical and numerical), thus ending a long-standing debate.",

            "text": "Percolation and epidemic spreading are among the most interesting processes unfolding on complex network substrates, and their investigation has attracted a huge interest in the past 20 years [1] [2] [3] [4] [5] . One of the most successful achievements of this endeavor is the realization that the properties of one of the fundamental models for epidemics without a steady state, the susceptible-infected-recovered (SIR) dynamics [6] , can be mapped onto bond percolation [7] [8] [9] . This connection has permitted the application to the SIR model of the powerful tools devised for percolation, leading to a full understanding of this epidemic process [8, [10] [11] [12] [13] . For the other fundamental class of epidemic dynamics, allowing for a steady, endemic state, whose simplest representative is the susceptible-infectedsusceptible (SIS) model [6] , no direct mapping to a percolative framework is available, and theoretical progress has been slower. In the SIS model, susceptible individuals acquire the disease at rate \u03b2 through any edge connected to an infected individual, while infected individuals spontaneously heal with rate \u03bc. The epidemic threshold \u03bb c defines the value of the ratio \u03bb \u00bc \u03b2=\u03bc separating a healthy (absorbing) phase from an endemic one with everlasting activity. Initial work showed that degree heterogeneity leads to disruptive effects on scale-free networks [14] , namely, a vanishing threshold in networks with power-law degree distribution P\u00f0k\u00de \u223c k \u2212\u03b3 and \u03b3 \u2264 3 [15, 16] . Later efforts have shifted toward less heterogeneous networks, those with \u03b3 > 3 [3] .",

            "text": "The quenched mean-field (QMF) theory [17] [18] [19] predicts a vanishing threshold \u03bb c \u2192 0 in the infinite networksize limit for any value of \u03b3 [20] , due to the existence of hubs able to sustain the epidemic for long times only by interacting with their direct neighbors [21] . It was later pointed out that, at the QMF level, the localization of activity around these hubs implies the existence, for small values of \u03bb, of long-lived, but not stationary, states [22, 23] . Important progress in this debate is provided in Ref. [24] , where it is shown that a genuine non-mean-field effect, mutual reinfection among distant hubs, is the key mechanism triggering the appearance of an endemic stationary state for any \u03bb in networks with \u03b3 > 5=2. Numerical evidence corroborates this picture, showing that the position of the effective threshold tends to zero with network size for any \u03b3. However, the decay observed is slower than the one predicted by the QMF theory [24] [25] [26] and, moreover, in contradiction with recent mathematical results derived by Huang and Durrett [27] and Mountford, Valesin, and Yao [28] . An additional puzzling question in this area is the striking disagreement between the exact mathematical prediction for the singular behavior of the prevalence (\u03c1 \u223c \u03bb 2\u03b3\u22123 , apart from logarithmic corrections) [28] and numerical simulations exhibiting a much faster growth. This lack of a precise agreement between analytics and numerics represents one standing issue in our understanding of epidemic processes on complex topologies.",

[29] , and we present a scaling theory for its nontrivial behavior. This theory-which provides a clear understanding of competing physical mechanisms, critical properties, crossover scales, and finite-size effects-is general and can be related with other processes. Second, we apply the results of the first part to SIS dynamics, obtaining in this way for the first time a full understanding of the critical properties of the model. In particular, our theory predicts that the asymptotic behavior in the limit of very large networks (derived exactly in Refs. [27, 28] and reassuringly recovered by our approach) can be observed only for huge system sizes, out of reach for present computer resources. We show instead that, for network sizes that can be currently simulated, a preasymptotic regime holds, whose nontrivial properties are determined, providing a prediction for the finite-size scaling of the SIS epidemic threshold in agreement with (previously unexplained) numerical results. Our work reconciles in a comprehensive way the different theories proposed to interpret the behavior of the SIS model, placing them in the proper context regarding the network size considered, and thus ends a long debate between the physics and mathematics communities.",

In a given network, composed by N nodes, each node i is active with probability p i . Inactive nodes do not play any role apart from determining the topological distances between pairs of active nodes (see below). Each active node i defines a cluster of size 1, associated with an initial mass m \u00f00\u00de i . Starting with these initial clusters, an iterative process takes place whose elementary step is the merging of a pair of clusters into a single one. Two clusters, \u03b1 and \u03b2, are merged in a single cluster if there are at least a node i \u03b1 in \u03b1 and a node j \u03b2 in \u03b2, such that",

The iteration of this procedure converges to a limiting partition of the network that does not depend on the order in which the merging is performed [32] . Notice that if p i \u00bc p and r\u00f0m\u00de \u00bc 1, CMP coincides with random site percolation [1] . It is important to remark that Eq. (1) implies that two clusters merge only if each one of them is within the interaction range of the other: An asymmetric situation, with a massive cluster interacting with a far and small cluster, does not lead to merging. In Fig. 1 , we present a graphical illustration of the mechanism of the CMP process. We stress again that a cluster is defined as a set of (only) active nodes resulting from the iteration of merging events. Nodes in the same cluster must belong to the same connected component of the underlying network, but they do not need to form a connected component by themselves, as is clear from Figs. 1(c) and 1(d).",

Upon increasing k a , above the crossover scale k \u00c3 0 , DOP enters the second regime with an increasing presence of isolated nodes and nodes belonging to small DOP clusters. CMP and DOP behaviors start to diverge at this point, because some nodes, even if they are not directly connected to the DOPGC, are at distance 2 from it and, thus, can join the CMPGC if their interaction range is at least 2. In particular, this situation occurs for all small DOP clusters: As their aggregate degree is k agg \u2265 2k a , they necessarily have a range of interaction r \u2265 2. For this reason, in this regime all N NI nonisolated nodes belong to the CMPGC. This result is clearly verified in Fig. 2 . Notice that N NI =N is finite even well beyond the DOP threshold. In this limit, the formation of the CMPGC is still triggered by the largest DOP cluster (that does not percolate). For any value of \u03b3, there are always nodes in the network with k > k c \u226b k a . They form local clusters with a large interaction range that progressively incorporate other small clusters giving rise to a CMPGC, even if no DOPGC is present.

This long-range interaction gives rise, above a critical value \u03bb c \u00f0N\u00de, to an extensive CMP percolating cluster of active nodes able to reinfect each other at distance and, thus, giving a veritable steady state with finite prevalence \u03c1. The threshold \u03bb c \u00f0N\u00de is intermediate between \u03bb QMF c and \u03bb HMF c and vanishes as a function of N (at odds with \u03bb HMF c ) but more slowly than \u03bb QMF c . Considering finite networks, while for \u03bb c \u00f0N\u00de < \u03bb < \u03bb HMF c a CMP percolating cluster exists and prevalence is finite, for \u03bb QMF c < \u03bb < \u03bb c only small nonpercolating CMP clusters are present.

Infected individuals, on the other hand, become spontaneously healthy again at a rate \u03bc.

In power-law distributed networks, for \u03b3 > 5=2 the epidemic transition is triggered by nodes with a large number k of neighbors (hubs).
