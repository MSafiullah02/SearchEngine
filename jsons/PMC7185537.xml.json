The closest matching template in the PDB was the combined NSP3 Protease-Helicase from Dengue Virus (2WHX) [27]. The protease binding site in this template is poorly defined in the crystal structure with the highest similarity (2WV9) [28], so a second template, from the homologous protease in West Nile Virus (2FP7; exp. value 4 \u00d7 10\u22127) [29] with a bound ligand (Bz-Nle-Lys-Arg-Arg-H; (N-benzoyl-l-norleucyl-6-ammonio-l-norleucyl-N-5-[amino(imino)methyl]-N-[(2S)-5-carbamimidamido-1-hydroxypentan-2-yl]-l-ornithinamide)) was used to generate a homology model specifically for the protease. Since the sequence similarity with the NS3 protease is much lower for this template, a constrained minimization of the peptide-receptor complex was carried out using the AMBER10:EHT force field and the bound peptide removed prior to docking. The RMSD between 2FP7 and the homology model is 0.753 \u00c5 for all common atoms. The binding interactions for both are shown in Fig. 1\n. The GenBank protein sequence A0A0B4ZYV2 was used for the NS5 methyltransferase and RNA-dependent RNA polymerase homology models using the relevant portion of the complete NS5 protein from Japanese Encephalitis Virus (4K6M) [30]. A second homology model for NS5 RdRp was generated using the template structure 2HFZ from West Nile Virus [31]. Protein sequence alignments and Ramachandran plots of the template proteins and the homology modeled ZIKV proteins are available as Supplementary material.",

            "text": "Protein-ligand docking studies were carried out based on homology-modeled structures of Zika virus (ZIKV) NSPB/NS3 protease, based on the crystal structure of Murray Valley encephalitis virus protease, PDB 2WV9 [28]; ZIKV NS5 methyltransferase (MTase), based on the crystal structure of Japanese encephalitis virus methyltransferase, PDB 4K6M [30]; and ZIKV NS5 RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp), based on crystal structures of West Nile virus RdRp, PDB 2HFZ [31] and Japanese encephalitis virus RdRp, PDB 4K6M [30]. Molecular docking calculations for all compounds with each of the proteins were undertaken using Molegro Virtual Docker (version 6.0, Molegro ApS, Aarhus, Denmark) [32], with a sphere large enough to accommodate the cavity centered on the binding sites of each protein structure in order to allow each ligand to search. Standard protonation states of the proteins based on neutral pH were used in the docking studies. Each protein was used as a rigid model structure; no relaxation of the protein was performed. Assignments of charges on each protein were based on standard templates as part of the Molegro Virtual Docker program; no other charges were necessary to be set. Overall, 2263 plant-derived secondary metabolites have been docked. This molecule set was comprised of 384 alkaloids (158 indole alkaloids, 143 isoquinoline alkaloids, 5 quinoline alkaloids, 18 piperidine alkaloids, 14 steroidal alkaloids, and 46 miscellaneous alkaloids), 670 terpenoids (35 monoterpenoids, 153 sesquiterpenoids, 212 diterpenoids, 83 steroids, 51 limonoids, 42 withanolides, and 97 triterpenoids), 1043 polyphenolic compounds (22 aurones, 72 chalcones, 9 chromones, 111 coumarins, 297 flavonoids, 113 isoflavonoids, 69 lignans, 69 stilbenoids, 29 xanthones, and 172 miscellaneous phenolics), and 166 miscellaneous phytochemicals. This in-house virtual library represents a practical selection of phytochemical classes and structural types. Each ligand structure was built using Spartan \u201914 for Windows (version 1.1.8, Wavefunction Inc., Irvine, California). For each ligand, a conformational search and geometry optimization was carried out using the MMFF force field [33]. Flexible ligand models were used in the docking and subsequent optimization scheme. Variable orientations of each of the ligands were searched and ranked based on their re-rank score. For each docking calculation the maximum number of iterations for the docking algorithm was set to 1500, with a maximum population size of 50, and 30 runs per ligand. The RMSD threshold for multiple poses was set to 1.00 \u00c5. The generated poses from each ligand were sorted by the calculated re-rank score. In analyzing the docking scores, we have attempted to account for the recognized bias toward high molecular weight compounds [34], [35], [36], [37]. We have used two different schemes to re-evaluate the Molegro docking scores (Edock): (1) E\u2032 = 6.96 \u00d7 Edock/MW\u2153, which accounts for biasing by dividing by a molecular weight function (MW), where 6.96 is a scaling constant to bring the average E\u2032 values comparable to Edock; and (2) E\u2032\u2032 = Edock\n \u2212 18.3 \u2212 Edock\n \u00d7 NH/125, which reduces the bias by subtracting a contribution from the number of non-hydrogen atoms (NH), where 18.3 is a factor to bring average E\u2033 values comparable to Edock. Histograms of docking scores for each protein target are available as Supplementary material.",

Kuraridin preferentially docked to ZIKV NS2B-NS3 protease placing the diprenyl-substituted A-ring into the hydrophobic cavity and the B-ring also not occupying the active site (Fig. 3B). Although the ligands in Table 2 did show relatively strong docking to ZIKV NS2B-NS3 protease, the docking energies are less than those for other ZIKV target proteins, likely a consequence of the small (42 \u00c53) binding pocket in the protease. Thus, it is unlikely that these ligands will exhibit selective protease inhibition.",

Most phytochemical ligands showed more exothermic docking energies with the ATP site over the RNA site of ZIKV NS3 helicase. For example, the isoquinoline alkaloid cassiarin D showed very strong docking to the ATP site (Edock\n = \u2212150.7 kJ/mol). In addition, cassiarin D showed some docking selectivity toward the ATP site of helicase (Fig. 4\nA). Similarly, the flavonoids 3\u2032-O-methyldiplacone and exiguaflavanone A, and the sesquiterpenoid lactucopicrin docked selectively with the ATP site of helicase. Several other phytochemical ligands (e.g., the aurones kanzonol V, the chalcones angusticornin B, balsacone B, and kanzonol Y, and the lignans hibalactone and kaerophyllin) also showed remarkably strong interactions with the ATP site of helicase. Interestingly, the bis-indole alkaloid 4,4\u2032-dimethylisoborreverine was selective for the RNA site of ZIKV NS3 helicase (Fig. 4B). The intermolecular interactions between the ligands and the helicase protein are illustrated in Fig. 4.",
