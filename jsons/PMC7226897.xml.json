            "text": "The purpose of this chapter is to show the legal and practical relationships between the International Federation of the Red Cross (IFRC) and the World Health Organisation (WHO) during the West Africa Ebola outbreak in 2014. Taking Sierra Leone, Liberia and Guinea as examples, this chapter considers the mandate and functions of the International Red Cross and Red Crescent Movement (IRCRCM) and whether its mandate complements, or otherwise competes with, the infectious diseases and international law framework and regulations. The Red Cross mandate includes the provision of health care to civilians and combatants during conflict and disaster situations.1 This will be described in the first part of the chapter. The Red Cross is not, however, alone in this role. The WHO,2 MSF,3 military actors,4 NGOs and local actors all interlink and, hopefully, coordinate in the preparation for, response to, and rebuilding after the outbreak of an infectious disease.5 Outbreak response will require medical assistance, possibly the participation of Emergency Medical Teams, and a rapid response in the areas of water, sanitation and hygiene, shelter and food.6\n",

            "text": "Kamradt-Scott et al. argue that the Ebola outbreak in Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone proved to be an exceptional outbreak that blurred the lines between health and humanitarian crises. In so doing, it highlighted numerous problems with regard to the coordination of humanitarian disasters that have public health implications of international consequence.7 In that context, this chapter shows the extensive mandate of the IFRC, and provides a critique of an institution that is widely underappreciated in the literature concerning global health, emergency medicine and humanitarian responses. The Red Cross is a unique humanitarian organisation with an arguably-unparalleled operational mandate to provide essential humanitarian protection and assistance to populations in need. The nature of its operations is described in this chapter. This chapter provides an analysis of the relationship between the WHO and the IRCR. It builds on previous work that showed that the ICRC is an international legal person that has an international legal mandate to protect those in need during armed conflict.8 That work examined the governance structure of the Movement and showed that the Red Cross and Red Crescent Movement is an institution with power and authority across multiple humanitarian situations, including disasters, armed conflicts, and other situations of violence.9\n",

            "text": "The WHO and IFRC each take their rights and duties from international agreements signed by States, but their working methods make them very different actors. The National Societies of the Red Cross, such as the Liberian Red Cross Society,10 Red Cross Society of Guinea11 and the Sierra Leone Red Cross Society,12 are auxiliaries to governments and are supported by the IFRC. The IFRC works through the existing networks on the ground in the provision of humanitarian aid and protection. The primary role of the WHO is the attainment by all people of the highest possible level of health.13 In order to achieve this, the functions of the WHO, detailed in Article 2 of the Constitution of the WHO, establish the WHO as the \u2018directing and co-ordinating authority on international health work\u2019.14 Article 2 outlines the WHO relationship with States, the United Nations, specialised agencies, governmental health administrations, professional groups and such other organisations as may be deemed appropriate. As with any international organisation, and the Red Cross Movement, the WHO assists Governments at their request and/ or with their consent. Its activities encompass technical support, the provision of aid, and health care (covering emergency assistance and also the overall improvement of international health). If we were to directly compare the WHO with the IFRC, we could say that the key similarity is the human-focused agenda which can only be realised through a State-centric system and is therefore dependent on consent. The key difference is the working method of each entity, as the IFRC is able to mobilise National Societies and support local actors and work towards health goals identified by the citizens, local groups and regional bodies. The WHO is much more hands-off, as it acts as a co-ordinating authority. We can see, therefore, that the WHO and IFRC have the ability to positively affect the ability of States to respond to infectious diseases, but with very different strategies and approaches; how these approaches compliment or clash (as the case may be) during a health emergency is the focus of this chapter. With this in mind, this chapter shows the relationship between these two institutions and critically appraises the contribution of the IFRC to the Ebola response in 2014. It examines the coordination role of the WHO and the extent to which the IFRC is coordinated by the WHO and, on the other hand, the areas in which it exercises its autonomy and its own legal mandate.",

The National Societies and the IFRC have local knowledge, expertise and resources to provide a first response to an outbreak. Through its networks, it can coordinate with MSF and other NGOs. However, the WHO is responsible for the overall coordination of all responders.15 Within this leadership role, I argue, the WHO must respect the international legal mandate of the IFRC and the roles that it has assumed. The WHO has the benefit of acting on the international stage and being able to speak to all actors, but the IFRC is better placed to manage the specific situation on the ground. Overall the chapter will examine what coordination is done by the WHO via the IHR; what is done by the UNGA; and what is done by the RCRCM. It will show the gaps in coordination and critically appraise the independent contribution that the IFRC makes to the response to the outbreak of infectious disease.",

These international agreements and the governance structure of the Red Cross Movement (from Geneva, to National Societies, to the field) allow the Red Cross to respond to humanitarian situations independently of other actors. This means, for example, that although the WHO may have the power to direct and coordinate activities and policies for global health, the Red Cross can act independently: States can ask for its help directly, it can act through the National Societies of States, and it can establish specific projects through its International Conference, such as the Health Care in Danger project 2011\u20132015.",

The outbreak required international cooperation to treat those already infected and prevent the spread of infection further. As the WHO and IFRC stated,[t]he high mortality rates (over 70% among untreated patients), the exponential escalation of cases in Guinea, Liberia, and Sierra Leone and the potential for the epidemic to spread globally through international travel resulted in a massively scaled and coordinated international response from Emergency Medical Teams.37\n\n",

Globalisation and increased travel and trade within and between countries have resulted in the rapid spread of disease. This was typified by the rapid spread of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) across three continents within weeks in 200359 and by pandemic 2009-H1N1 influenza.60 There is, therefore, an international legal framework including the Constitution of the WHO and the IHRs that seeks to provide an adequate response to outbreaks of infectious diseases.

Secondly, local needs were assessed and as far as possible met by the WHO and its partners. Thirdly, the WHO helped channel the offers of assistance to the respective Ministries of Health. Fourthly, tasking to an ETC location was undertaken by the Ministry of Health with support from the WHO EMT coordination cell. Importantly, this process could only begin once there were sufficient numbers of EMTs offering their assistance; therefore the majority of steps 3 and 4 did not take place until November and December 2014.

The Red Cross provides a counterpart to the more state interest focused international system, which includes the WHO and IHR. The Red Cross was created to provide humanitarian protection and assistance directly to those in need. The Red Cross has an international mandate to provide health care to civilians and combatants during conflict and disaster situations.90 Critically, the Red Cross was designed to reach communities and people in need. It is still subject to the consent of states, whether that is through the Geneva Conventions, Statutes of the Red Cross and Red Crescent Movement, and Headquarters agreements. However, its principles mean that is stays in favour with governments and is able to stay in countries for long periods of time. The ICRC, for example, often maintains a presence long after an identifiable armed conflict has ended. In this way, its reputation and humanitarian mandate set is apart from other organisations and NGOs. In circumstances where, for whatever reason, states decide that they no longer wish for the Red Cross to work within its territory, states might, should they be so inclined, refuse to grant visas to delegates, or perhaps even revoke visas, but this is unlikely.

When an infectious disease affects the human population and the State is unable to stop its spread, there is a number of actors on the international stage with the mandate to react and protect people. To this end, international law provides a global legal framework to regulate and coordinate the international response to infectious diseases, including through the mandate of the International Red Cross and Red Crescent Movement (IRCRCM) and the Constitution of the WHO. Of course, any response to infectious disease needs to be bespoke to the disease but there exist a number of international laws and international institutions to provide global mechanisms by which external actors, States and organisations, can support States threatened by the spread of disease.",

As two actors with international mandates concerning health, they have very different roles. The international community should not be aiming for an ultimate coordinating body to oversee the entire response as organisations have grown up independently of one another and have unique and established relationships with the states and communities that they may serve. Of course, on the international stage, delegates may converse, build relationships, discuss operations, but that it not to say that the best practice would come from an ultimate authority dictating the actions of all possible responders. This is particularly the case with the IFRC and National Societies which have built and nurtured relationships with States and each other for decades in order to develop institutional best practice. The autonomy of the Red Cross to react to an outbreak should be respected and, where beneficial to both the WHO and the Red Cross, it may be part of a multi-institutional operation or response.",
