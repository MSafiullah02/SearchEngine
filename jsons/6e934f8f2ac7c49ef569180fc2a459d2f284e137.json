The previous researches on MES integration rarely considered the problem of system data security access. A three-level data security access mechanism based on the independence of the system administrators, security administrators, and security auditors is proposed which integrated into the MES integration framework to guarantee the business and engineering data security access for the related distributed clients. The principle is using the domain to make the logical isolation for different clients and data sources and applying the pre-defined data sharing rules for safe access. In the proposed MES integration framework model, the data interoperation between MES and the engineering software systems is discussed which includes ERP (Enterprise Resource Management), CAPP (Computer Aided Process Planning), DNC (Distribution Numerical Control), WMS (Warehouse Management System), and SCADA (Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition), etc., the implementation method of personalized data display GUI is discussed as well. The study is based on the KMMES developed by Wuhan KM-Software of China, and it has been deployed in over forty companies from the sections of aerospace, automotive, shipbuilding and other industries.",

In the architecture, the MES belongs to the third layer, i.e., the industrial software layer. By integrating with ERP to obtain product design models, manufacturing processes and production planning information, it can provide the necessary data for DNC, WMS, SCADA, and the other related systems in the workshop. It means that the operating efficiency and performance of the automated production system will be greatly affected if the integration of MES and related systems cannot be solved properly. Therefore, MES integration problems can be transformed into data interoperability management between MES and related business systems.",

Therefore, in a broad sense, indepth research on MES integration objects and integration scope of data interoperability is still lacking or insufficient, especially in the researches on how to incorporate data access security issues in the MES integration architecture. Therefore, the research objectives/questions are: how to establish a more comprehensive MES data interoperability object model, incorporate the distributed data security access mechanism with the MES integration architecture, and then apply the solution in discrete manufacturing sector.",

In terms of MES modeling technology, Witsch [5] developed a novel MES modeling language (MES-ML), which integrates all important and necessary functional views of the MES system; the users can build the interdependence between functional views by MES-ML and then help to create a universal MES system framework model.

For example, Li [3] proposed a three-tier automation system integration scheme based on BPS (Business Planning System)/MES/PCS (Process Control System). The comprehensive functions of this MES were analyzed in detail and were applied in Shanghai Iron and Steel Company. In terms of PLM and MES integration, due to the large differences in the integrated data format, source, scale, etc., Anis [4] proposed to integrate a product design, manufacturing system hardware data, and real-time data generated in the production process to design an intermediary system that resolves syntactic and semantic conflicts. In the integration of various functions within the MES, Jeon [8] introduced a design method of advanced MES (i.e., intelligent MES), by establishing a collaboration mechanism of MES internal functions. It supported the functions improvement and auxiliary management decision-making capability of the MES in data collection and analysis. Anyway, it only analyzed its feasibility by simulation based on the established TO-BE scenario model and AS-IS model.",

For example, Novak [6] believes that intelligent manufacturing systems can use a five-layer pyramid to describe an automated system structure. To support dynamic production scheduling, provide the flexibility of intelligent manufacturing systems, and reduce response time, it presented a way to integrate a production planning and scheduling module within MES. However, the levels and integration methods of software such as DNC/CAPP are not concerned. Cai [7] aimed at the integration of the distributed manufacturing services in virtual factories, and adopted the ontology and constraint-based distributed manufacturing service modeling methods to develop a prototype of the semantic Web system of ManuHub (i.e., Manufacturing Center), which provides a friendly graphical user interface to search for the required services and get the semantic annotations for the manufacturing assets services. Ghielmini [9] and Mourtzis [10] believes that the existing ICT solutions have low interoperability in supporting the distributed manufacturing assets integration for small and medium enterprises. Therefore, they proposed a virtual factory framework (VFF) to solve this problem, including semantic shared data models, virtual factory managers (VFM), and so on. Mourtzis [11] proposed an integrated quality monitoring method to support cloud manufacturing in virtual factories. Iarovyi [12] proposed an open, knowledge-driven MES architecture by adopting the base-of-breed method, which can effectively support MES to intelligently expand functions and performance, improve MES application quality, and reduce configuration costs and system downtime.",

(3) The CAPP system sends the products manufacturing methods, processes, and the required types of manufacturing assets (such as machine tools and equipment, etc.) to the MES, i.e., how the products are processed, the processing steps and their operations and the required processes equipment (e.g., tools, fixtures, gauges, and accessories, etc.). (4) MES will feedback on the execution status of the parts processing to CAPP so that the process planners can refer to the execution information of the process task when they design new manufacturing processes or execute processes change design. (5) The MES sends the CNC machining instructions in the CAM to the DNC system according to the production plan, and then the DNC system downloads the cutting program to the CNC machine. (6) DNC needs to feedback the equipment information to the MES (information of the parts being processed by the machine tool, processing status, processing start time and estimated end time). (7) The MES sends the materials and quantity information of the currently processed parts to the WMS. After the processing is completed, it is stored in the warehouse and the completed part information is entered into WMS/ERP. ( Fig. 2 . MES integration object model interacts with SCADA. On the one hand, when the MES is scheduled for production, it is necessary to obtain the status of manufacturing assets from SCADA (whether the equipment is normal, whether the operators are on the job, whether the inventory is sufficient, etc.), and pass the processing parameters to the processing equipment and testing equipment; on the other hand, MES sends statistical analysis data of workshop equipment to the SACADA and then the management staff can access the information by graphical viewing tools.",
