In addition to appropriate post-exposure prophylaxis, the prevention of plague relies on careful infection prevention practices. There is presently no commercially available vaccine against plague. Patients suspected of plague should be placed immediately into droplet precautions, with access to the patient room restricted to essential staff. Gowns, gloves, surgical masks, and eye protection should be worn by all staff. Aerosolizing procedures should be kept to an absolute minimum and avoided if possible. As noted before, negative pressure isolation with N95 masks is not necessary for plague, although infections that may present similarly to pneumonic plague (e.g., severe coronavirus infections such as SARS or MERS) may require negative pressure rooms or PAPRs, thus requiring a higher level of protection while diagnostic testing is underway. Following 48 hours of therapy with appropriate antibiotics and with clear clinical improvement, patients with both nonpneumonic plague and pneumonic plague may be removed from isolation [73] (Table 6 .3).

Similar to plague, it has a natural small-mammal reservoir of rabbits and rodents. Also similar to plague and anthrax, tularemia occurs in a primarily respiratory form (pneumonic tularemia) and in a primarily cutaneous and lymphatic form (ulceroglandular tularemia). The United States and the former Soviet Union developed biological weapons that could disperse F. tularensis in the mid-twentieth century [42] , and there remains a concern that F. tularensis could be used as an agent of bioterrorism. F. tularensis can survive in soil, water, and animal carcasses for many weeks. Chlorination of water prevents its spread through water contamination. As few as ten organisms may be sufficient to cause human disease [74] . Human transmission most often results from tick and flea bites, animal handling, ingestion of contaminated food and water, and inhalation of aerosols. Unlike plague, there is no direct human-to-human transmission.

In Europe, the incidence of tularemia is considerably higher, with over 1000 cases per year in Hungary and the Czech Republic and over 4000 cases per year in Sweden and Finland.

Based on the site of initial infection and presenting syndrome, tularemia may be described as primary pneumonic, typhoidal, ulceroglandular, oculoglandular, oropharyngeal, or septic. Ulceroglandular tularemia is the most common form of the infection, typically following with a week of a vector bite or animal contact. A majority of patients present with fever (85%), with chills (52%), headache (45%), cough (38%), and myalgias (31%) occurring in many. Other nonspecific constitutional symptoms occur with variable frequency, such as chest and abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea. The hallmark lesion is a tender papule at the site of initial inoculation which subsequently ulcerates, with painful enlarged lymphadenopathy proximal to the ulcer. This lesion may clinically resemble a plague bubo, and plague must be considered in the differential diagnosis. A purely \"glandular\" form, with lymphadenopathy but no visible ulcer, can occur as well. In cases of ingestion of contaminated material, an exudative pharyngitis and tonsillitis may develop, with subsequent pharyngeal ulceration and cervical lymphadenopathy. Inoculation of the eye will lead to oculoglandular tularemia, also with accompanying cervical lymphadenopathy. Cases of systemic tularemia without clinically apparent lymphadenopathy are known as typhoidal tularemia. Fever, diarrhea, shock, and meningeal signs are typical (Figs. 6.5 and 6.6). Pneumonic tularemia results from the inhalation of aerosolized organisms or from hematogenous spread from other sites of infection. Following the inhalation of the organism, patients may suffer initially from nonspecific fever and chills, followed by a dry or minimally productive cough, pleurisy, dyspnea, and subsequently hemoptysis. Respiratory symptoms were absent in nearly half of patients in a recent series from Finland, however [78] . Pleural effusions are common and may be unilateral or bilateral. Pneumonic tularemia can progress rapidly to acute hypoxemic respiratory failure, disseminated intravascular coagulation, rhabdomyolysis, and eventually multiorgan failure [9, 74] . Virtually any organ may be involved in severe tularemia, including peritonitis, pericarditis, appendicitis, osteomyelitis, and meningitis, although such presentations are less frequent than the more \"classic\" forms.
