The more likely the virus transmitted by large droplets, the more likely that hand hygiene will reduce transmission. Hand hygiene may not be beneficial if small particle aerosol is the main route of transmission. There is evidence that tens of times greater quantities of virus are required for virus infection by intranasal drops than with aerosols [4] . Meanwhile, intranasal infection disease was milder than natural acquired disease; the duration of cough was also shorter.",

Hand hygiene is of course a highly defensible measures, as SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV, and influenza virus can survive on surfaces for extended periods [5] . Another closely related human coronavirus, 229E, remained infectious on surface materials common to public and domestic areas for several days [6] . However, the cost of following this recommendation would be considerable, especially when extending the scope of measure to all people with risk of infection around the world. Furthermore, it should be noted that individuals may venture into crowds under the false illusion that hand hygiene can prevent them from acquiring or transmitting SARS-CoV-2 if we overemphasize hand hygiene, increased cases of COVID-19 would result. Additional studies are needed to determine whether hand hygiene is effectively to SARS-CoV-2 control.",
