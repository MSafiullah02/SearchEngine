The clarified wastewater was mixed with dextran and polyethylene glycol (PEG), and the mixture was left to stand overnight at 4\u00b0C in a separation funnel. The bottom layer and the interphase were then collected drop-wise, and this concentrate was added to the pellet from the initial centrifugation.

The extraction of viral RNA was done using the NucliSENS miniMAG semi-automated extraction system with magnetic silica carried out following manufacturer's instructions (bioMerieux, Marcy l'Etoile, France) with however slight modifications. The lysis phase was prolonged to 20 minutes, and brief centrifugation (2000 \u00d7 g, 1 min) was used to pellet the sediment; subsequently, magnetic silica beads were added to the cleaned supernatant.

Molecular grade water was used as the negative control. c) a published nested RT-PCR for SARS-CoV-2 targeting the spike region (Nao et al., 2020). cDNA was synthesized from 5 \uf06dl of sample RNA, using SuperScript III Reverse Transcriptase (ThermoFisher Scientific), 0.5 \uf06dM of the reverse primer (WuhanCoV-spk2-r, Table 1 ) and a 50 min reaction at 50 \u00b0C (20 \uf06dl final volume). First PCR reaction was performed by adding the reaction mix (Dream Taq polymerase and buffer from ThermoFisher Scientific, 0.4 \uf06dM of primers WuhanCoV-spk2-r and WuhanCoV-spk1-f) directly to the whole volume of synthesized cDNA. The used PCR conditions were as follows: 95\u00b0C for 1 min; 35 cycles of 95 \u00b0C for 30 sec, 56 \u00b0C for 30 sec, and 72 \u00b0C for 40 sec; final extension 72 \u00b0C for 5 min. Nested PCR (primers NIID_WH-1_F24381 and NIID_WH-1_R24873) was performed in a total volume of 50 \u00b5l using 5 \u00b5l of first PCR product, with the same conditions applied for the first PCR and 45 cycles. All reactions were performed in duplicate. For standard curve construction, the targeted region, coupled with a T7 promoter, was synthetized and quantified by Eurofins Genomics (Germany), and tenfold dilutions were used for curve construction. In vitro synthetized RNA using the standard curve DNA as a template was used as an external amplification control to check for PCR inhibition. All amplifications were conducted on a QuantStudio 12K instrument (Thermo Scientific). Molecular biology water served as a non-template control.",

Both the published and newly designed SARS-CoV-2 specific primer sets detected bands of the expected size and were confirmed by sequencing. In contrast, only unspecific products were detected with a broad range assay for coronavirus. Upon comparison of broad range primers with SARS-CoV-2 genome, we noted that they showed only 77.1 to 91.3 % nt identity, which explain why these were not able to amplify the novel coronavirus. No positive results were obtained by real-time RT-qPCR, therefore no quantitative data could be provided for the positive samples. This may be related to the sensitivity of the RdRp assay used in this study. Indeed, in recent comparative studies, the sensitivity of this assay was shown to be low compared to others developed by WHO referral laboratories (Etievant, 2020). In particular, the limit of detection (LOD) of this assay was estimated at 316 viral genomic equivalents per reaction by Nalla and coworkers (2020) and above 500 genome copies per reaction by Vogel et al. (2020) as well as in our hands (data not shown), suggesting that virus concentration was below the LOD of the assay. However, the external inhibition control associated to this assay was useful to confirm the acceptable levels of PCR inhibitors, all samples being below the acceptability criterion (median inhibition 29.1%, range 8.7%-51.4%).",

This approach will allow obtaining a rough estimation of the total number of subjects excreting the virus, by integrating -as done by Wu and co-workers in samples taken in the United States (Wu et al., 2020) -the available information on viral shedding rates, WWTPs loads, and virus concentration in wastewaters. Moreover, the environmental surveillance will be extended to the collection of wastewater samples available in the Department of Environment and Health of the Italian National Health Institute, that were collected throughout Italy in the framework of different projects on enteric viruses. Such monitoring will provide a picture of the SARS-CoV-2 circulation across the different regions of Italy and over time, to better understand the virus circulation, as provided by wastewater-based epidemiology (WBE) and compare it to the clinical data. Samples collected before the reporting of the first known Italian case on February 21 will also be tested, to possibly infer when SARS-CoV-2 first appeared in Italy.",

            "text": "Pastorino et al., 2020). Similar results were obtained byBat\u00e9jat et al. (2020)  and byWang et al. (2020). Moreover, the effectiveness of thermal treatment at 56\u00b0C for virus inactivation was reported for SARS-CoV(WHO, 2003). To confirm that heat inactivation did not negatively affect virus detection, seeded experiments were performed using a surrogate virus (Mengovirus), confirming that no significant loss of RNA signal was recorded in heat-treated samples (data not shown).With the used protocols, SARS-CoV-2 RNA was first detected with a weak amplification signal in an influent sample from Milan WWTPs (Lombardy, North Italy) collected on February 24 th from signal, on February 28 th from the plant B, with both targets (ORF1ab and spike genes). In the influent samples taken from the WWTP in Rome (Latium, Central Italy), SARS-CoV-2 was detected in both sampling dates (31 st of March and 2 nd of April) and both pipelines, C1 and C2, using the newly designed primer sets specific for SARS-CoV-2. The analysed sequences showed, for both ORF1ab and S partial gene regions, 100% identity with the first SARS-CoV-2 sequence detected in Italy (MT066156), isolated on 30 th January 2020 from a Chinese touristby the Institute \"Lazzaro Spallanzani\" (INMI, Rome). Given the high level of conservation of the two analysed regions, 100% identity was also detected with several sequences in GenBank and with all the other Italian SARS-CoV-2 genomes deposited in Gisaid. Significantly, on February 24 th and 28 th , when the samples positive for SARS-CoV-2 were collected in Milan, COVID-19 infections were still limited in Italy, the first Italian autochthonous SARS-CoV-2 positive case having been reported only a few days earlier, on February 21 st . On February 28 th , the total number of SARS-CoV-2 positive patients reported in all Italy was only 888, with 531 (57%) in Lombardy, the most affected region in the country. However, at that time, the vast majority of cases in Lombardy were recorded in the provinces of Lodi, Cremona and Bergamo (182, 123, and 103 cases, respectively). In comparison, in the province of Milan (an even larger area compared to the metropolitan area served by the selected WWTPs) only 29 cases had been reported (Dipartimento della Protezione Civile, Bulletin 28.02.2020). These results provide evidence of the sensitivity of environmental surveillance for the detection of ongoing outbreaks in the population. Virus detection in sewage, despite the low incidence of reported human infections, may be associated with the ability of sewage surveillance to estimate after careful epidemiological models, mild, subclinical, or asymptomatic cases. These infected individuals shed viruses into local sewage systems and contribute to virus circulation while remaining substantially undetectable by clinical surveillance, a phenomenon known as the of the iceberg of viral diseases (hospitalized patients or laboratory diagnosed cases). In contrast, monitoring of urban wastewaters makes it possible to capture the full extent of the diseases at a community level. As regards to the influent samples collected in Rome, SARS-CoV-2 was detected on March 31, when the epidemic had spread considerably in Italy. In that date, a total of 77.635 SARS-CoV-2 infections had been reported in Italy, of which 3.095 in Latium Region and 2.186 in the province of Rome (Dipartimento della Protezione Civile, Bulletin 31.03.2020), with about 85% of them being active cases (Assessorato alla Sanit\u00e0 e all'Integrazione Socio Sanitaria della Regione Lazio;Ministero della Salute, Bulletin 31.03.2020). Given the spread of the virus, with such several excreting patients (symptomatic and asymptomatic), the detection of the viral RNA in the tested samples is not surprising and, consistently, the samples taken two days later, on the 2 nd April, at the same WWTP were still positive for SARS-CoV-2 RNA.",
