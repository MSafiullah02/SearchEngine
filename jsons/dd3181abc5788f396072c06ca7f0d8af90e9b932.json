            "text": "Chronic hepatitis C (CHC) is a worldwide healthcare problem due to the increasing number of affected individuals [1] . Interferon-based therapy schemes prove the most effective in CHC treatment [2, 3] . The discovery of impact of host IFNL3 (IL28B) genotype in combination with virus genotype on treatment outcome was a milestone in the development of antiviral therapy strategies [4] [5] [6] . The wide range of studies has proven the association of IL28B gene polymorphic variants rs12979860 and rs8099917 with the antiviral therapy efficiency in patients with chronic hepatitis C (virus genotype 1) as well as spontaneous viral clearance [7, 8] . Interestingly, this association shows ethnical diversity [9] . However, the obscurity of exact molecular mechanism underlying such association was the significant drawback for further investigations. The discovery of a previously unknown transcript which expression in hepatocytes was activated by hepatitis C virus exposure has lead to the significant progress in the field [10] . A recently discovered dinucleotide polymorphic variant ss469415590 was shown to cause a frame-shift mutation creating an open reading frame -IFNL4 (interferon lambda 4) gene [10, 11] .",

Genotyping for IFNL4 gene ss469415590 was performed using the amplification-refractory mutation system (ARMS) PCR [17] . Primer design was conditioned by several factors. Firstly, high sequence homology between IFNL gene subfamily needed to be taken into the consideration. Secondly, the sequence of ss469415590 flanking region is able to form hairpin loops and dimers with \u0394G up to \u22124.7 Kcal mol -1 . Therefore, additional mismatches were introduced in the targetspecific primers to avoid dimer formation. The primers sequences were IFNL4\u0394G: TCC TTT ACA CGG TGA TCG CAG C, IFNL4TT: TCC TTT ACA CGG TGA TCG CAG AA, and IFNL4com: TGA TTG ACC CTG AGC CTG CG. Conditions for amplification were as follows: initial denaturation at 95\u00b0C for 5 minutes, 30 cycles of 30 seconds at 95\u00b0C, 30 seconds at 62\u00b0C, and 30 seconds at 72\u00b0C, followed by 5 minutes of final extension at 72\u00b0C. The amplification products of 299 bp were visualized on 2% agarose gel with ethidium bromide staining. In order to confirm the accuracy of the developed genotyping method, genotypes of random samples were re-determined via Sanger sequencing. DNA sequencing was performed by standard dideoxynucleotide chain-termination method using BigDye\u00ae Terminator v3.1 Cycle Sequencing Kit and ABI Prism 3110 Genetic Analyser (Applied Biosystems, USA). Genotyping for IL28B gene rs12979860 was performed by a PCR-based restriction fragment length polymorphism assay using Hpy8I restriction enzyme as described previously [18] .",

IFN-\u03bb4 most closely resembles IFN-\u03bb3, but these proteins share only 29% amino-acid identity, and, compared to IFN-\u03bb3, IFN-\u03bb4 is only weakly secreted [10, 21, 22] .",

            "text": "There are some crucial characteristics in the antiviral activities induced by type III (\u03bb) IFNs. First, in contrast to type I IFNs, which receptors are broadly expressed in virtually all somatic cells, type III IFN receptors are predominantly expressed by non-hema- tologic cell types, especially cells of epithelial origin such as bronchial epithelium, gastrointestinal epithelium, and keratinocytes [12] . Second, viral infection studies in several mouse models have shown that type III IFNs play a more prominent role than type I IFNs in mediating antiviral protection against certain types of viruses which preferentially infect gastrointestinal and/or respiratory epithelium [23] . Early clinical trials of recombinant IFN-\u03bb1 for the treatment of chronic hepatitis C indicate that its antiviral effects are similar to recombinant IFN-\u03b1, but it induces fewer adverse effects due to the more limited range of cells which express IFN-\u03bb R1 [24, 25] . The exact mechanism of IFN-\u03bb4 level influence on hepatitis C antiviral treatment efficiency is yet to be discovered. However, several hypotheses call for further investigation. According to the first hypothesis IFN-\u03bb4 production may have an impact on interferon-stimulated genes (ISG) expression. IFN-\u03bb4 signaling is proven to occur through the IFN-\u03bb receptor complex, consequently inducing ISGs expression via the Janus kinase-signal transducer and activator of transcription signaling pathway [22] . Individuals who carry IFNL4-\u0394G allele may express low levels of IFN-\u03bb4 protein that induces low, but persistent ISGs expression in the liver, which makes hepatocytes refractory to stimulation by IFN-\u03b1 [10, 22] . It was shown, that these individuals have higher basal levels of ISG expression and are less likely to respond efficiently to PEG-IFN\u03b1 and ribavirin therapy [11, 14] . These findings show the importance of discovering new treatment targets for hepatitis C therapy, avoiding IFN-\u03b1 pathway.",
