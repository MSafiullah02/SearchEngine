Laboratory results showed leukocytosis (20.22 x 10 9 /L, normal 4.0 -10.0 x 10 9 /L), elevated liver enzymes (AST= 54 IU/L, normal < 32 IU/L; ALT= 68 IU/L, normal < 33 IU/L; GGT=87 IU/L, normal 5 -35 IU/L) and D-dimer elevation (14.2 mg/L, normal < 0.5 mg/L). left fronto-temporal lobes.

Despite initial symptomatic treatment, the patient rapidly worsened her condition, rapidly developing cough and then severe headache about 2 weeks after the onset of symptoms. Chest CT-scan revealed typical subpleural ill-defined ground glass opacities of COVID-19 infection. Laboratory results showed leukocytosis (18.32 x 10 9 /L, normal 4.0 -10.0 x 10 9 /L), high level of CRP (170.8 mg/L, normal < 5 mg/L) and Ddimer elevation (2.36 mg/L, normal < 0.5 mg/L). Non-contrast brain CT and MRI revealed large hemorrhagic infarction in the left temporal lobe. CT venogram and MR angiography showed cerebral venous thrombosis (CVT) of the left transverse sinus. Discussion COVID-19 is a pandemic infection caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2. When symptomatic, COVID-19 is known to typically present with systemic and respiratory manifestations (6,7). COVID-19 can also cause hyperactivation of inflammatory factors and damage to the coagulation system causing D-dimer and platelet abnormalities. It increases the risk of abnormal blood clotting leading to deep vein thrombosis or pulmonary embolism (4-6). Central nervous system symptoms or diseases have recently been reported (1,2,8). However, these are the first reported cases of CVTs associated with COVID-19 infection.",
