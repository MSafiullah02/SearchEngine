A pastor\u2019s experience of vocational risks like precarious finances, church conflict, and rural isolation, as well as vocational rewards like deepened faith in God, collaborative relationships with church members, and respect by colleagues and superiors such as bishops, depend not only on the presence of God, but also the commitments and practices of institutional systems within which they work, not only congregations, but also denominational institutions.",

These middle administrative bodies (such as dioceses or synods) are both the \u201cbody of Christ\u201d and modern bureaucracies. As such, they are hybrid structures with inherent tensions between communal norms such as equality, transparency and respect, and institutional demands such as a hierarchy of authority, effectiveness, efficiency and sustainability. As well, a diverse mosaic of inner-city/rural, large/small, majority-Anglo/majority-ethnic, working-class/white collar, theologically conservative/progressive congregations in the same body may strain a judicatory\u2019s capacity to support pastors serving vulnerable churches (Cafferata 2020). Although earlier research has documented a gender gap among clergy in compensation, full-time placements, attainment of higher-level leadership positions, and acceptance of their leadership, we still do not understand whether access to judicatory, as well as congregational support, differs among men and women pastors serving congregations that eventually close (Zikmund et al. 1998; Price 2009).",

This point of church crisis and vocational vulnerability offers a unique opportunity to examine whether career challenges such as spiritual or emotional stress, health issues, or access to resources such as financial or spiritual support from a judicatory differ among women and men. Further, it enables us to examine how the demise of their congregation subsequently affects the vocations of men or women clergy, for example, whether they are equally able to secure their next position and experience satisfaction with their new ministries and lives.",

For example, the Episcopal Church lost almost a quarter of its members between 1986 and 2010 (Goodhew 2017). Old-line Protestant churches like those in this study are becoming older and more fragile as congregations fail to replace themselves with newer generations (McKinney 2012; Funk and Smith 2012). Economic displacement associated with the Covid-19 pandemic may accelerate this trend.",

Serving when a church\u2019s future is threatened by congregational aging, declining income, culturally shifting neighborhoods, and the inability to replace leaving or dying members with young families is even more so (Bendroth 2018; Berry et al. 2012; Darling et al. 2004; Ellison et al. 2009; Francis and Brewster 2012; Gledhill 2015; Peyton and Gatrell 2015; Rudgard 2017; Willimon 2013; Wuthnow 1997; United Church of Christ 2015; Gaede 2002; Irwin 2014; Olson 2016). In these demanding circumstances, the \u201cliving human web\u201d of supportive relationships should be important in buffering clergy\u2019s spiritual and emotional stress and nurturing wholeness (Miller-McLemore 2018). A wholistic health approach posits that this \u201cliving human web\u201d of personal and professional support affects clergy health (Proeschold-Bell et al. 2011).",

A transformational leadership style is built on relationships of respect, trust and communality; it is emotionally expressive, inspires motivation for others to participate and contribute, and values the development and mentoring of community members.",

One study found that nearly a third of women pastors view their role primarily as one of empowering laity to implement decisions that laity have made, whereas only 10% of clergy men chose this style (Carroll 2006). Research has confirmed that women leaders are seen as more effective when they exercise both inspirational motivation (seen as agentic) and individual consideration (that is seen as communal) (Zheng et al. 2018). This study therefore expects women pastors may be more likely than men to be disappointed when denominational colleagues and superiors fail to respect their dignity by not accepting their identity, including them as much as their male colleagues in professional work, being fair, understanding them, recognizing them, or, in other words, when judicatories fail to exercise inclusive, transformational leadership.",

For example, managerial literature has shown that women walk a \u201crazor\u2019s edge\u201d in balancing expectations for agentic behavior with cultural expectations for women\u2019s communality such as being caring, participatory, other-serving, and approachable (Zheng et al. 2018). Evaluations of competence are shaped by a leader\u2019s capacity to exercise both agentic and communal behavior; traditional gender expectations assume women\u2019s agency and competence to be lower than men\u2019s, with women being less likely to be perceived as leaders despite the same qualifications; when they succeed, women are more likely than men to attribute it to hard work and less likely to attribute it to innate ability (Ridgeway 2011; Lerchenmueller and Sorenson 2017; Pickett 2019). When things aren\u2019t going well, as in the throes of church closure where there is grief and even conflict about what to do and how to do it, a cultural presumption of male dominance or superiority may be able to buffer the attribution of failure or incompetence to male but not female clergy, especially in denominations such as the Church of England, the Episcopal Church, and others where formal hierarchical leadership has been historically male (Greene and Robbins 2015; Ridgeway 2014).",

Other studies show that women pastors find less support in their work than men. For example, women priests in the Church of England reported overt and hidden congregational hostility to their leadership as well as a lack of respect among colleagues in the wider church such as being talked about behind their backs, openly criticized, belittled in public, overly scrutinized, and not being listened to (Greene and Robbins 2015). They reported being placed in appointments at a higher risk of failure as well as in congregations lacking empathy for the constraints of motherhood and work-life balance. In the U.S., a national study of Methodist clergy found women pastors more likely than men to report occupational stress, hostility of church environment and perceived stress (Wespath 2019). In the Episcopal church, men reported greater assistance from Bishops in their job search than women, and gender inequalities persist in income, access to senior positions, and the ability to achieve work-life balance (Price 2009).",

This was true as they served their closing churches, and also 1\u20133 years after their churches closed. As well, the study also found significant gender differences in vocational concerns and trajectories after churches close. Not only are men more likely to find a position in a timely manner than women, with the difference greatest among pastors in a call system (not United Methodist). Women are nearly twice as likely as men to believe that the experience of closing a church affected their job search, that is, to perceive a kind of stigma. This is akin to research findings that women managers and executives in secular occupations perceive persistent gender bias in access to vocational rewards such as esteem, inclusion in decision-making, mentoring and networking, and opportunities for advancement.",

In medicine, one study showed that after a patient death, female surgeons experience a greater drop in referrals than male surgeons; after a bad experience with one female surgeon, male surgeons are less likely to refer to any female surgeons. There are no such spillovers to men after a bad experience with a male surgeon (Sarsons 2017). An executive consultant, Joelle Emerson, remarks that, \u201cIf women make one mistake, their career gets stalled\u2026 Men are able to make multiple mistakes and not suffer career consequences\u201d (Lublin 2018).

As well, difficulties women pastors may have experienced in finding their next job such as a lengthier search, or not finding a position at all, which are correlated with mental health, appear to be eased by satisfying relationships with denominational officials, new and current ministries and others such as family, friends and colleagues. In the long run, if faith in God and the living human web of current relationships are strong, the stress of closing a church and a difficult job search appear to be mitigated for both women and for men.",

For this, scholars may look not only to women\u2019s preference for inclusive, transformational leadership but also to structural answers such as cultural bias against female leadership, lack of institutional norms that reflect a commitment to equality and justice for men and women, or theological/geographic/economic cleavages that weaken the capacity of judicatories to understand, trust, or support women pastors in difficult cures. Many judicatories are also historical bureaucracies with inertia or \u201cbenign neglect\u201d of past injustices and inequalities. Judicatories led by hierarchical authorities such as bishops run the risk of exercising authority over clergy and congregations in accordance with church law but lacking compassion that transformational pastors of both genders value and expect of their leaders.

Thus, this research confirms previous studies among clergy and other professions showing gendered differences in access to valuable vocational supports and resources. This matters to clergy wellness because respect from peers and denominational superiors decreases untoward personal and vocational consequences such as worsened health, the experience of a tragic \u201cGood Friday\u201d or \u201cHoly Saturday\u201d closing process, financial stress, or an extended or unsuccessful congregational job search. Satisfaction with relationships with current denominational officials when serving in a new call, as well as with new ministries and family life are associated with better well-being following a church\u2019s closure. Although the wider church is a sacred community like the congregations that comprise it, its structure as a historical bureaucracy risks compromising its theological commitment to and institutional embodiment of gender equality and justice. How it negotiates those challenges will matter for the increasing number of men and women called to serve and possibly close a church in the coming years.",
