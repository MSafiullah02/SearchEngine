The nation that experienced severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) in 2003 will never drop its guard against emerging infectious diseases. Since then, there has been substantial progress in the construction of a national public health system and hospitals for infectious diseases.10 The web-based direct disease reporting system which allowed the Ministry of Health (MOH) to get information on public health emergencies directly from grassroots-level health professionals may be considered as a demonstration of an enhanced surveillance system. In addition, when the first human case of avian influenza was reported in 2005,11 the influenza surveillance system was expanded to include 197 sentinel hospitals and 63 public health laboratories in all provinces.

Under the direction of the State Council, the NRPC was led by the MOH, with the involvement of 33 different ministries. Eight task forces were formed to oversee all prevention and response strategies for the emerging pandemic. These types of intersectoral collaboration were also mirrored at provincial and local levels. Importantly, a special scientific advisory committee (SAC) was set up to provide technical support for evidence-based policy-making. In answering the call of the MOH, scientists from the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention (Chinese CDC) succeeded in establishing real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-based diagnostic kits within 72 h of the genetic sequence being provided by the US Centers of Disease Control and Prevention.",

The first confirmed case (a traveller from North America returning to Sichuan province) was reported on 11 May 2009.12 All close contacts of that case on the same flight were immediately informed and put under medical observation for 7 days. The same approach was taken for other \u2018imported\u2019 cases, although this meant a huge amount of work at certain cost.

The first \u2018local\u2019 cluster of 50 confirmed and 69 suspected cases without any clear links to international travel was reported in Guangdong province on 18 June, 38 days after the detection of the first \u2018imported\u2019 case.15 A discussion was organized by the SAC on a possible adjustment of the control strategy. Given that the \u2018local\u2019 transmission was still quite limited and the schools in China would soon start the summer break, the SAC suggested that the containment strategy should be continued until July, which would significantly reduce the speed and scale of community outbreak. This suggestion was endorsed by the MOH and then at the level of the NRPC. To support this decision, the Ministry of Education decided to start the summer break at the beginning of July, approximately 10 days ahead of the usual schedule, and asked schools to cancel all unnecessary group activities during the summer holidays. This decision, together with the public health campaign at the community and public transport level, might allow China to experience 2 additional months of low pandemic activity. From May to August, a total number of 3779 cases were reported in China, and 885 were \u2018imported\u2019 cases (Fig. 1\n). Mathematical modelling estimated that a reduction of 93% of new cases was achieved by the containment strategy during the first 90 days.16\n",

Meanwhile, a large body of clinical data from China and abroad showed that most H1N1 cases were mild. The NRPC thus shifted its strategy from containment to mitigation, with an emphasis on reducing the pandemic impact. On 10 July, the Government removed H1N1 from its list of quarantinable diseases. Accordingly, on 30th September, the MOH decided on a major policy change in disease reporting: case-based surveillance of all H1N1 cases was replaced by sentinel surveillance of patients with influenza-like-illness (ILI), event-based surveillance of clusters of ILI, and case-based surveillance of laboratory-confirmed hospitalized cases.",

Antivirals were also provided to high-risk close contacts, including pregnant women, persons with severe chronic medical conditions, children aged <5 years, elderly people aged \u226565 years, and healthcare workers. During the initial 2 months, 82.3% of confirmed H1N1 mild cases were administered oseltamivir (72.4% within 48 h of the onset of illness).18 Since July, when the mitigation phase started, China focused on managing and treating patients with severe illness (Table 2\n). Antiviral production and distribution were accelerated to prepare for the pandemic\u2019s peak. Patients were treated in designated hospitals to make optimal use of healthcare resources. Antivirals were recommended to those with severe or high-risk infections.20 Other innovative treatments, such as Chinese traditional medicine and antiserum therapy, were also introduced. The use of Chinese traditional medicine treatment was recommended in the Chinese guidelines for the treatment of H1N1. In a prospective multicentre clinical trial leaded by Chen Wang and Bin Cao, the efficacy and safety of a Chinese traditional therapy, Maxingshigan\u2013Yinqiaosan, in the treatment of H1N1 was evaluated in 2009. The results showed that the Chinese herb mixture reduced fever as well as oseltamivir in mild cases of H1N1.21 In addition, the Chinese Government strengthened the treatment capacity of low-income provinces through additional investments in medical facilities and stockpiles.",

The vaccination campaign offered vaccines free of charge for all recipients and was voluntary. The campaign was first started among doctors, nurses, border staff and 200,000 performers taking part in the official celebrations. Subsequently, the campaign was extended to the priority population according to the MOH guideline for vaccination against pandemic H1N1. The priority group included healthcare workers, frontline public servants, schoolchildren and people with chronic diseases, particularly in the badly affected regions. When the vaccine became more abundant, the campaign was extended to any interested persons aged \u22653 years old.27 On 11 December 2009 and 7 January 2010, the vaccination campaign was extended to pregnant women and children aged 6\u201335 months. Children aged 6\u201335 months were eligible for two doses of the vaccine, each with 7.5 \u03bcg of haemaglutinin. Vaccination was offered at the routine childhood immunization sites and also at the provisional sites for mass vaccination. All vaccine recipients or their guardians provided written informed consent and completed a brief medical history to identify persons at higher risk or with contraindications.28 Pandemic vaccine production and inoculation may not only have prevented millions of people from getting H1N1 infection and protected those high-risk vaccinees from severe complications or death, but also contributed to social stability and prevention of public panic to a degree. In Beijing, 72% of schoolchildren, 60% of healthcare workers and other high-risk groups were immunized as of March 2010, and the high vaccine effectiveness of 87% in school-age children28 showed that mass vaccination formed an immune barrier in the Beijing population and lessened school outbreaks.",
