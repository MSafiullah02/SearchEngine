            "text": "Cancer immunotherapy including vaccine therapy is a promising modality for cancer treatment, but few patients show its clinical benefits currently. The identification of biomarkers that can identify patients who will benefit from cancer immunotherapy is thus important. Here, we investigated the potential utility of the circulating cell-free DNA (cfDNA) integrity-a ratio of necrotic cell-derived, longer DNA fragments versus apoptotic cell-derived shorter fragments of Alu gene-as a biomarker of vaccine therapy for patients with ovarian cancer. We analyzed plasma samples from 39 patients with advanced or recurrent ovarian cancer enrolled in clinical trials for personalized peptide vaccinations. We observed that (1) the cfDNA integrity was decreased after the first cycle of vaccination, and (2) the decreased levels of cfDNA integrity were correlated with vaccine-induced immune responses; i.e., decreased cfDNA integrity was observed in 91.7% and 59.3% of the IgGpositive and negative patients, respectively (p = 0.0445). Similarly, decreased cfDNA integrity was observed in 92.9% and 56.0% of CTL response-positive and negative patients, respectively (p = 0.0283). These results suggest that the circulating cfDNA integrity is a possible biomarker for cancer vaccine therapy.",

The cancer vaccine consisted of 31 CTLepitope peptides, and a maximum of four peptides was selected from among the 31 peptides based on each patient's HLA-A locus types and pre-vaccination immunity to the peptides; we thus refer to it as the \"personalized peptide vaccination\". Although promising results such as the improvement of overall survival in the vaccine-treated group were obtained, only a limited number of patients received a clinical benefit from the vaccine [6] [7] [8] [9] [10] [11] .

The physiological cell death of normal cells is mostly apoptosis, whereas pathologic tumor cell death is mainly necrosis [19] . Apoptotic cell-derived DNA fragments are generally < 200 bp in length, whereas necrotic cell-derived DNA fragments are more random in size and contain longer sizes of DNA (~ 200-400 bp) [20] . The circulating cell-free DNA (cfDNA) integrity, calculated as the ratio of the longer DNA fragment concentration to the shorter DNA fragment concentration, has been investigated in the efforts to find biomarkers for the diagnosis of various cancers [21, 22] . The Alu element, which is the most abundant repetitive element in the human genome, is frequently used in these efforts, and it is the most reliable target of DNA integrity [21, 22] . We conducted the present study to investigate the possibility of using the circulating cfDNA integrity as a biomarker of vaccine therapy for patients with ovarian cancer.",

It is thus conceivable that the decrease in cfDNA integrity that we observed after the first vaccination was due to an increase of Alu-115. However, the decrease in cfDNA integrity reflected mainly the decrease of Alu-247. One possible reason for this is that a partial conversion of the tumor cells' death from necrosis to apoptosis induced a reduction of Alu-247. The effect of this conversion was less on the Alu-115 levels since Alu-115 reflects the total plasma cell-free DNA (including both apoptosis-and necrosis-derived DNA). There are many studies regarding cfDNA integrity as a biomarker of various cancers for diagnosis and prognosis [21] [22] [23] . In their study of ovarian cancer, Zhang et al. reported that plasma levels of patients with a long Alu fragment (Alu-219) and cfDNA integrity were significantly higher than those of the benign-disease and healthy control groups [23] .",

[24] analyzed the pre-vaccination levels of the plasma cfDNA integrity of patients with metastatic colorectal cancer treated with a combination of a cancer vaccine and chemotherapy as the first-line therapy, and they reported that the progression-free survival of the patients with low levels of plasma cfDNA integrity was significantly longer than that of the high cfDNA integrity group [24] . In that report, only the prevaccination levels of cfDNA integrity are discussed; there is no information regarding post-vaccination values. Our present investigation thus provides the first report regarding alterations of circulating cfDNA integrity during a peptide vaccination.",
