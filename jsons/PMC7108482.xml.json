This SELDI peak was observed previously in another proteomic study, under similar experimental conditions, and was identified as SAA (2). In a recent study by Yip et al.(3), the intensity of a SELDI peak at m/z 11695, which was identified as SAA, was significantly higher in the SARS patient group than in the control group. A similar increased peak was also found in pediatric patients with SARS (4). All of these studies suggested that SAA is useful in the diagnosis of SARS.",

Unfortunately, the degree of similarity of the symptoms between SARS and control group participants and the time point of blood collection had not been considered in these studies. From the perspective of infectious disease diagnosis, we are not trying to differentiate healthy persons from infected patients; rather, we are trying to identify the disease causing the symptoms in patients presenting with similar symptoms (5). Bearing in mind the above issues, we recently attempted to profile and compare the serum proteomes of 39 adult patients in the early stages of SARS infection and 39 adult non-SARS patients who were suspected cases during the SARS outbreak period (6). We found specific SELDI peaks in the sera of the adult SARS patients; however, the peaks corresponding to SAA were not identified as SARS-specific features. This led us to question whether SAA is a useful biomarker for the diagnosis of SARS.",

In our SELDI dataset, obtained with the same ProteinChip type and binding conditions, there were 3 SELDI peaks with similar m/z values (mean values): m/z 11681, m/z 11526, and m/z 11439. Spearman rank correlation analysis showed that the normalized intensities of these 3 peaks correlated highly with the serum concentration values obtained by ELISA (all correlation coefficients >0.9; all P values <0.0005; Table 1 ). Such high correlations strongly suggested that the SELDI peaks at m/z 11681, m/z 11526, and m/z 11439 were full-length SAA and the des-arginine and des-arginine/des-serine variants at the NH2 terminus.

Consistent with the SELDI data, the serum SAA concentrations were significantly lower in the SARS patient group (P <0.005; Table 1 ). The results from both the SELDI ProteinChip assays and ELISA indicated that serum SAA by itself was not useful in differentiating the SARS patients from the non-SARS patients who were suspected cases during the SARS outbreak period. Because serum SAA was increased in the SARS patients, however, we could not exclude the possibility that it could be used in combination with other serum markers to develop a classification model for SARS diagnosis.",

Regardless of the types of infection, serum SAA concentrations can increase up to 2000 mg/L. The degree of increase may reflect only the severity of the illness and does not indicate the cause. In the SARS patient group, we found that the SAA peaks and the serum concentration correlated significantly with the serum C-reactive protein concentration (Table 1 ), as in other infectious diseases (8). This suggests that the increases in serum SAA were caused mainly by the inflammatory response to SARS infection.",
