We propose a model based on the estimation of twoparameter Weibull distribution conditionally to the features. To achieve this result, we describe a neural network architecture and the associated loss functions that takes into account the right-censored data. We extend the approach to a finite mixture of two-parameter Weibull distributions. We first validate that our model is able to precisely estimate the right parameters of the conditional Weibull distribution on synthetic datasets. In numerical experiments on two real-word datasets (METABRIC and SEER), our model outperforms the state-of-the-art methods. We also demonstrate that our approach can consider any survival time horizon.",

This branch of statistics which emerged in the 20 th century is heavily used in engineering, economics and finance, insurance, marketing, health field and many more application areas. Most previous works and diverse literature approach time-to-event analysis by dealing with time until occurrence of an event of interest; e.g. cardiovascular death after some treatment intervention, tumor recurrence, failure of an aircraft air system, etc. The time of the event may nevertheless not be observed within the relevant time period, and could potentially occur after this recorded time, producing so called right-censored data. The main objective of survival analysis is to identify the relationship between the distribution of the time-to-event distribution and the covariates of the observations, such as the features of a given patient, the characteristics of an electronic device Supported by Smart Occitania, ADEME and ENEDIS. or a mechanical system with some informations concerning the environment in which it must operate. The Weibull distribution could be used as lifetime distributions in survival analysis where the goal would be to estimate its parameters taking account the right-censored data. Several previous works focused on the estimation of a Weibull distribution with right-censored data (see Bacha and Celeux [1] , Ferreira and Silva [2] and Wu [3] ).",

            "text": "Among the first estimators widely used in this field is the Kaplan-Meier estimator [4] that may be useful to estimate the probability that an event of interest occurs at a given point in time. However, it is limited in its ability to estimate this probability adjusted for covariates; i.e. it doesn't incorporate observations' covariates. The semi-parametric Cox proportional hazards (CPH) [5] is used to estimate covariate-adjusted survival, but it assumes that the subject's risk is a linear function of their covariates which may be too simplistic for many real world data. Since neural networks can learn nonlinear functions, many researchers tried to model the relationship between the covariates and the times that passes before some event occurs, including Faraggi-Simon network [6] who proposed a simple feed-forward as the basis for a non-linear proportional hazards model to model this relationship. After that, several works focused on combining neural networks and survival analysis, notably DeepSurv [7] whose architecture is deeper than Faraggi-Simon's one and minimizes the negative log Cox partial likelihood with a risk not necessarily linear. These models use multilayer perceptron that is capable to learn non-linear models, but it is sensitive to feature scaling which is necessary in data preprocessing step and has limitations when we use unstructured data (e.g. images). There is a number of other models that approach survival analysis with right-censored data using machine learning, namely RandomForest Survival [8] , dependent logistic regressors [9] and Liao's model [10] who are capable of incorporating the individual observation's covariates. This paper proposes a novel approach to survival analysis: we assume that the survival times distribution are modeled according to a finite Mixture of Weibull distributions (at least one), whose parameters depends on the covariates of a given observations with right-censored data. As Luck [11] , we propose a deep learning model that learns the survival function, but we will do this by estimating the Weibull's parameters. Unlike DeepHit [12] whose model consists on discretizing the time considering a predefined maximum time horizon. Here, as we try to estimate the parameters, we can model a continuous survival function, and thus, estimate the risk at any given survival time horizon. For this purpose, we construct a deep neural network model considering that the survival times follow a finite mixture of two-parameter Weibull distributions. This model, which we call DeepWeiSurv tries to estimate the parameters that maximize the likelihood of the distribution. To prove the usefulness of our method, we compare its predictive performance with that of state-of-the art methods using two real-world datasets. DeepWeiSurv outperforms the previous state-of-the-art methods. ",

The aim of this experiment, is to check if DeepWeiSurv can handle data in highly censored setting for different survival time horizons. For this purpose, we apply the same experimental protocol as before, but changing the censoring threshold. We do this for some values of t c far below than that used in the previous experiment (t c = t MET ABRIC = 8940). This values, expressed in quantiles 3 , are carefully selected in order to have a significant added portion (compared to that of the adjacent value that precedes) of censored observations. As an observation may change from a censored status to an uncensored status by changing the threshold of censorship and vice versa, for each value of censoring threshold time t c we therefore have a new set of observed events",

Each curve in Fig. 5 represents the scores calculated for a given censoring threshold t c in different survival time horizons t ST H in x-axis. We can notice that the average score decreases when t c decreases which is expected because we have less and less of uncensored data which means that it becomes more and more difficult to model the distribution of survival times.

In addition to the fact that Weibull distributions are known to be a good representation for this kind of problem, it also permits to consider any survival time horizon given a censoring threshold. Experiments on generated databases show that DeepWeiSurv converges to the real parameters when the survival time data follows a mixture of Weibull distributions whose parameters are a simple function of the covariates. On real datasets, DeepWeiSurv clearly outperforms the state-of-the-art approaches and demonstrates its ability to consider any survival time horizon.",
