Recent bacterial or viral infections have been known to cause strokes by increasing cardioembolism as well as arterio-arterial embolism. 15 16 Another study looking at activated partial thromboplastin time-based clot waveform analysis(CWA) in COVID-19 patients concluded that CWA parameters demonstrate hypercoagulability that precedes or coincides with severe illness. 17 Multiple reports of pulmonary embolism are currently available in the literature. 18 Autopsy and pathology findings are scarcely available, but recent autopsy findings suggest thrombotic microangiopathy in multiple organs especially in the lungs. [19] [20] [21] No autopsy reports of the brain are available at the time of this writing. With this evidence, the most plausible mechanism of early cerebrovascular accidents could be hypercoagulability leading to macro and micro thrombi formation in the vessels. Other 22 Outside transfers should be minimized, and even the ones that need transfer should have an infectious screening before the transfer. 22 A dedicated neurology hot-spot along with a mobile CT unit for COVID-19 patients with stroke-like symptoms is beneficial. 23 Clinically stable patients after thrombolysis can be monitored on non-intensive care units. 23",

A computed tomography (CT) of the head was performed for altered mental status which demonstrated loss of gray-white differentiation at the left occipital and parietal lobes, consistent with acute infarct (figure 1a). CT of the chest demonstrated bilateral peripheral patchy airspace opacities and diffuse ground-glass opacities, characteristic for atypical pneumonia/viral infection from COVID-19 (Figure 1b). Electrocardiogram (EKG) was within normal limits. Blood work was significant for leukocytosis with lymphopenia. Urine analysis was within normal limits. C-reactive protein was elevated to 26mg/dl (0-0.4mg/dl). D-Dimer was not checked during the hospital course. COVID-19 Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) detected the virus. Blood and urine cultures did not yield any growth. A repeat CT of the head demonstrated progressive large acute infarct of the left MCA territory with hyperdense appearance of left MCA vessels consistent with acute thrombus. The patient was deemed not a candidate for thrombolysis or neuro-intervention due to poor functional status. The patient was treated with aspirin and other supportive measures. No abnormal heart rhythm was noted on telemetry monitoring. The family eventually chose for comfort measures and terminally extubated the patient. Patient 2 83-year-old female with a past medical history of frequent urinary tract infections, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, diabetes mellitus type 2, neuropathy presented to ED with fever, facial droop, slurred speech, and reduced oral intake. Initial vital signs were significant for temperature of 101.4, HR of 94, blood pressure (BP) of 172/64, saturating 94% on room air. The examination was significant for left facial droop and slurred speech with no other significant neurological deficits. National Institute of health stroke scale(NIHSS) was calculated to be 2. Blood work was significant for leucopenia with lymphopenia. Urine analysis was within normal limits, chest X-Ray showed bilateral peripheral opacities. CT head was negative for any acute changes. CTA of head and neck demonstrated no large vessel occlusion, focal moderate stenosis of right MCA (Figure 2a), and incidental pulmonary ground-glass opacities in bilateral apices. COVID-19 was suspected given the fevers and CT findings. COVID-19 PCR detected the virus. D-DImer and other inflammatory markers were not checked. CXR progressively worsened with bilateral infiltrates (Figure 2b). Urine and blood cultures did not yield any growth. No arrhythmias were noted during the hospitalization. On day-3 of hospitalization, the patient developed left-sided hemineglect, worsening left-sided facial droop with left hemiparesis. The speech was normal. NIHSS was calculated to be 16. Repeat CT of the head demonstrated a new moderate hypodensity in the right frontal lobe representing acute infarct (Figure 2c). The patient was deemed too high risk for thrombolysis or neuro-intervention. A CT angiogram was planned prior to starting Integrellin but her respiratory status worsened requiring intubation and mechanical ventilation. Soon after, the family decided to withdraw care. altered mental status and Left-sided weakness. The family denied history of fever or cough but reported that the patient has been falling frequently in the past week. The patient was intubated for airway protection and code stroke was activated. Vital signs in ED were significant for Temp of 100.2, HR 101, BP 130/77, Examination was significant for left hemiplegic and aphasia. NIHSS was calculated to be 36. CT Head revealed acute right MCA stroke (figure 3a). CTA of head and neck demonstrated occlusion of the right internal carotid artery at origin and incidental bilateral patchy apical lung opacities (Figure 3b). CT perfusion demonstrated 305 cc core infarct in the right MCA distribution and 109 cc surrounding ischemic penumbra (Figure 3c). The patient was deemed not a suitable candidate for any acute neuro-intervention due to large core infarct. Considering characteristic CT findings the patient was tested for COVID-19 PCR which detected the virus. Laboratory data on admission demonstrated leukocytosis with lymphopenia, elevated d-dimer (13966 ng/ml DDU) along with elevated Lactate Dehydrogenase (712 U/L) and elevated C -reactive protein(16.24 mg/dl). Patient's hospital course was complicated by acute kidney injury and progressively increasing oxygen requirements. On the third day of admission, her family chose for terminal extubation with comfort measures.Patient 4An 88-year-old female with a past medical history of hypertension, chronic kidney disease, and hyperlipidemia presented to ED with a transient 15-minute episode of right arm weakness and numbness along with word-finding difficulty. Vital signs on presentation were within normal limits. The initial neurological examination was normal. Code stroke was activated. CT head did not show any acute findings. EKG showed normal sinus rhythm. Thrombolysis was deferred, and she was admitted with a diagnosis of transient ischemic attack. As the patient complained of mild shortness of breath with dry cough, Covid-19 PCR was sent which detected the virus. D-Dimer (<880 ng/ml) was elevated to 3,442ng/ml, other inflammatory markers were elevated. Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) showed an acute infarct in the left medial temporal lobe(Figure 4a).Magnetic resonance angiogram (MRA) of head and neck revealed mild stenosis of the right M1 Avula et al. 9",

Further studies are urgently needed for comprehensive understanding neurological pathology of COVID-19 and its effects on the nervous system. TREATMENT IMPLICATIONS COVID-19 pandemic necessitates extra measures to be taken to provide the care for stroke patients along with measures aimed at minimizing the spread of the infection. Some of the challenges we encounter with acute stroke patients are their inability to effectively communicate due to speech problems, altered mental status, inadequate history, because of the limitations of visitors by hospital policies, etc. Khosravani. et al. proposed a Protected Code Stroke (PCS) concept during this pandemic which provides a framework for key elements like screening guidelines, PPE, and crisis resource management 22 .
