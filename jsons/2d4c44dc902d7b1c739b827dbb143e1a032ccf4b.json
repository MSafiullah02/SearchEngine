Thus, critical care is contemplating approaches that are considered useful in cancer medicine and other clinical fields such as respiratory medicine, to inform clinical trials in sepsis and ARDS. However, the challenges with precision medicine in the critically ill could be related to the classic paper by Geoffrey Rose; \"Sick Individuals and Sick Populations\" [3] . The key principle is that individual and population approaches to improving health achieve different aims: the individual approach aims to protect susceptible (high-risk) patients, whereas the population approach aims to reduce the group level incidence of or outcome from diseases. In this short perspective, after discussing the rationale for current definitions, we discuss whether the heterogeneity and precision medicine concepts could inform future studies in sepsis and/or ARDS.",

ARDS is defined as acute onset hypoxemic respiratory failure despite a positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 5 cmH 2 O or greater, with non-cardiogenic pulmonary edema evidenced by bilateral chest opacities. With this definition, stages of mild, moderate, and severe ARDS based on severity of hypoxemia, were associated with significantly higher mortality and increased median duration of mechanical ventilation in survivors [2] . Sepsis is defined as life-threatening organ dysfunction caused by a dysregulated host response to infection, with organ dysfunction defined as an increase in the sequential organ failure assessment (SOFA) score of 2 points or more [4] . Septic shock was defined as a subset of sepsis in which profound circulatory, cellular, and metabolic abnormalities are associated with a greater risk of mortality than with sepsis alone. Patients with septic shock can be clinically identified by a vasopressor requirement to maintain a mean arterial pressure (MAP) of 65 mmHg or greater and serum lactate level greater than 2 mmol/l in the absence of hypovolemia [5] . With this definition, sepsis and septic shock were associated with significantly higher mortality, compared to uncomplicated infection [1] . The predictive validity for mortality categories could potentially inform clinical care and trial design. For example, worsening ARDS severity has been aligned with treatment options, with severe ARDS aligned with need for neuromuscular blockade, prone position and extracorporeal support [6] .",

When risk factors for the illness or outcome are reported, the unstated (and likely incorrect) assumption is that these risk factors confer similar risk to individuals in a population, which is often overlooked during design, conduct and interpretation of studies [7] . Variation in the risk of illness or outcome is generated either as a random phenomenon, or due to measurable differences in biological characteristics in patients [8, 9] , resulting from genetic and/or environmental influences. It is challenging to discern the relative contribution of each of these influences on outcomes in a critically ill patient with ARDS or sepsis. For contextualization to ARDS and sepsis patients, heterogeneity could be categorized into patient, illness biology and treatment response level differences.",

The answers to these questions rely on understanding the determinants of susceptibility amongst individuals to the illness (risk of illness) and the illnessrelated outcomes (risk of outcome). For example, as sepsis is infection-related organ dysfunction, the risk factors for sepsis would include risk factors for infection and risk factors for developing organ dysfunction in the context of infection. The risk factors for developing organ dysfunction in the context of infection are poorly understood. The risk factors for infection include age with an inverted parabolic distribution with highest risk at extremes of age; male sex; ethnicity with black race and Asians having a greater risk; and presence of one or more comorbidity [10] .",

Identifying -and understanding -the genetic factors underlying predisposition may lead directly to tractable therapeutic targets in the host [13] . Several strong associations with susceptibility to infections have been discovered (e.g., human immunodeficiency virus [HIV], West Nile virus [WNV], tuberculosis, malaria, influenza, meningococcus) [14] [15] [16] , but these tend to be highly pathogen-specific. Whether there is general genetic susceptibility to sepsis, or even more broadly to a deleterious response to sterile injury, remains an open question. However, several lines of evidence suggest that responses to critical illness are likely to exhibit heritable variation in human populations. First, the consensus in critical care medicine, supported by many years of clinical and animal model research, is that organ failure seen during critical illness is complex, driven by immune-mediated injury and alterations in bioenergetics [17, 18] , alongside individual predisposition discussed as patient heterogeneity. Second, immune phenotypes tend to be strongly heritable, and numerous genetic associations for both autoimmune and infectious diseases have been discovered. Importantly, many of these disease associations are pleiotropic [19] . Hence, variation in the host responses to severe systemic injury is likely to be in part genetically-determined. Finally, and most directly, the results of the Genomic Advances in Sepsis (GAinS) and GenoSept studies have discovered some genetic associations with outcome in sepsis [20] , which will be important candidates for further biological investigation.",

A simple example for the impact of time on treatment effect is the relationship between time to antibiotic treatment and outcome. In a cohort study, Seymour et al. highlighted that in patients who had the 3-hour Surviving Sepsis Campaign Bundle (blood culture, antibiotic therapy and measurement of lactate) completed within a 12-hour period, every extra hour taken to complete the bundle was associated with a significant increase in mortality [36] . Similarly, the treatment effect of drugs has been shown to vary with illness severity, using activated protein C trials in sepsis and effect of PEEP in ARDS [37] as examples. A related concept in this context is heterogeneity in treatment response, which is a crude omnibus test for differences in responses to Agglomerative hierarchical clustering based on Ward's method using pan-leukocyte transcriptome using microarray. The study showed that a 140gene expression signature reliably stratified patients with sepsis to the four endotypes. The study also reported biomarkers for each endotype to facilitate clinical use: Mars1 = BPGM and TAP2; Mars2 = GADD45A and PCGF5; Mars3 = AHNAK and PDCD10; Mars4 = IFIT5, NOP53 IL: interleukin; sTNFR1: soluble tumor necrosis factor receptor; IFN : interferon gamma; ANG1/2: angiotensin; PAI-1: plasminogen activator inhibitor-1; DYRK2: dual specificity tyrosine phosphorylation regulated kinase 2; CCNB1|P1: cyclin B1 interacting protein 1; TDRD9: tudor domain containing 9; ZAP70: zeta chain of T-cell receptor associated protein kinase 70; ARL14EP: ADP ribosylation factor like GTPase 14 effector protein; MDC1: mediator of DNA damage checkpoint 1; ADGRE3: adhesion G protein-coupled receptor; E3BPGM: bisphosphoglycerate mutase; TAP2: ATP binding cassette subfamily B member transporter 2; GADD45A: growth arrest and DNA damage inducible alpha; PCGF5: polycomb group ring finger 5; AHNAK: AHNAK nucleoprotein; PDCD10: programmed cell death 10; NOP53: ribosome biogenesis factor treatment and illness-related outcomes arising from all factors contributing to heterogeneity and stochasticity of risk. This has been illustrated using simulation of sepsis and ARDS RCTs [38] and by using completed RCT data from intravenous immunoglobulin trials in sepsis [39] . As the risk of death changes in a trial population, the differences in mortality between the intervention arm and the usual arm also changes. This could potentially highlight a risk of outcome-specific subgroups within ARDS and sepsis who are likely to benefit the most from the intervention.",

Thus, in the context of sepsis and ARDS, stratified medicine (enrichment) of clinical trial populations is a potentially viable strategy, as differential biological mechanisms and the technical ability to prospectively identify patient subsets exist. For example, in children with septic shock, using a 100-gene profile and serum protein biomarkers, it is possible to identify two patient subsets, with different outcomes, and differential responses to corticosteroid treatment [41] . Similarly, in adults with septic shock, corticosteroid responders can be identified using a three-biomarker panel [42] . Similarly, ARDS subsets, which respond differently to ventilator and fluid management, have been identified using data from completed ARDS trials [32, 33] .",

In itself, this is purely an exercise of academic interest, but where a common biological mechanism can be found, there is a reasonable chance that some current or future therapy might have a different effect in patients belonging to a given subgroup -this essentially is the definition of a disease endotype [43] . The process of identifying endotypes is conceptually identical to the approach taken by our medical forebears: a syndrome becomes a disease when the underlying mechanism is thought to be known.

It is therefore important to consider carefully what criteria must be met for this enterprise to proceed. Differential response to therapy is probably too high a bar in critical care medicine, because in many cases the fundamental problem is that we lack specific diseases and therapies for those diseases. Thus, a major aspiration of this field is that, by better understanding the underlying biology, we may be able to create or repurpose drug treatments to modulate the host response to injury. At present, however, efforts to achieve this goal have failed. Aside from heterogeneity, this is not necessarily because of lack of understanding of the molecular mechanisms involved, but due to the complex interplay of many mechanisms contributing to the final outcome; targeting one particular mechanism may not yield the desired treatment benefit. Progress in identifying distinct disease processes in critical illness should not be held back by this limitation.",

If the number of tests performed is faithfully reported, these approaches can provide convincing evidence that a given grouping is biologically real. Clinical plausibility is an extension of this concept. Biological plausibility has obvious limitations: there are many real subgroupings of any population of patients.

Furthermore, the cancer-free survival amongst patients with relapse and/or refractory tumors is not impressive and super-responders to targeted chemotherapy may be a much smaller cancer population than previously considered [48] . For example, a recently published phase II multicenter RCT enrolled 741 adult patients with any kind of metastatic solid tumour refractory to standard of care. From this population, 40% of patients had at least one molecular alteration that matched with one of the 10 treatment regimens and 195 patients were randomized to receive experimental treatment specific for pathway mutations or standard of care. There were no differences in efficacy or adverse event endpoints between the intervention and control arms [49] .
