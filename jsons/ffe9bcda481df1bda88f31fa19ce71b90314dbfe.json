To re-start the world economy again it will be important to ease travel restrictions as soon as possible. Whilst travel restriction measures that significantly interfere with international traffic may be justified at the beginning of an outbreak, since they allow countries time to implement effective preparedness measures based on careful risk assessment, they should be based on a reasoned scientific evaluation of the available evidence on their possible effectiveness. They should also be time-limited and reconsidered and revisited on a regular basis as better information on both the effectiveness and the socio-economic impact of the measures emerges. Thus an open debate is now required on when and how they need to be lifted. This debate could usefully be framed in the context of the International Health Regulations.",

Is it that the advice was considered wrong or that the advice was inconsistent with the public perception that closing borders was a \"sensible\" thing to do? 2. Given that countries have unilaterally made decisions to close down international travel, how can we get better science and evidence into decisions about lifting these restrictions as the outbreak resolves so that international trade and the global economy can start to recover? It seems inevitable that countries will move at different speeds to these decisions, reflecting the different evolution of the outbreak in each country. Promoting a risk-based approach to lifting the travel restrictions that might vary from country to country could provide a way forward but it will need a degree of international coordination to avoid a random, possibly chaotic, certainly confusing, and probably ineffective process. This coordination should come from WHO in line with the mandate given to WHO by the member states through the IHR. Countries with still very few cases and potential to arrest and eliminate the few cases that they have, should not open up travel without very strict quarantine for arrivals. This could reduce the conflict between science-based advice and political decision making.",

Should there be, within the spirit of the recent G20 statement [G20, 2020], international cooperation facilitated by WHO to ensure testing capacity is made available in a managed way to countries as and when they need it most? Indeed, the WHO the 7 th April certified the first two PCR tests [WHO, 2020c] and advice on the use of point-of-care tests [WHO, 2020d] The majority of persons who have been infected SARS-CoV-2 recover and appear to be immune and non-infectious [To KK-W et al. 2020 ] although recurrence have been reported but need further confirmation [Zhou L et al. 2020 ]. We do not know for how long such J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f 5 immunity lasts but neutralizing antibodies was found more than two years after infection with SARS-CoV [Wu LP et al. 2007] . A validated, specific and sensitive test to detect SARS-CoV-2specific-IgG is urgently required to support countries' efforts to control the outbreak. There is currently no evidence to recommend serology as an immunity passport and we do not have any long-term data about how effective and long-lasting immunity might be but there will undoubtedly be pressure to implement such measures. It would be helpful if this was coordinated to ensure a consistent approach globally, with consistent standards and requirements, and such an approach is also clearly within WHO's IHR mandate.",

            "text": "avoid unnecessary interference with international traffic and trade'. The IHR are focussed on public health events where 4 key considerations are present [WHO, 2005]: 1. Is the public health impact of the event serious? 2. Is the event unusual or unexpected? 3. Is there a significant risk of international spread? 4. Is there a significant risk of international travel or trade restrictions? In the case of COVID-19, the answer to all the above questions is 'YES' and this is what led to the Emergency Committee recommending to the Director General in January that COVID-19 constituted a Public Health Emergency of International Concern. Within the IHR the declaration of a PHEIC opens up the possibility for WHO to make Temporary Recommendations on measures that should be implemented to help bring the event under control. The COVID-19 Emergency Committee made a wide range of recommendation to the Director General but the Committee specifically stated \"The Committee does not recommend any travel or trade restriction based on the current information available\".",
