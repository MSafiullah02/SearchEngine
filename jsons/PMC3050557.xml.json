Azo coupling of (+)-12 with 4-chlorobenzenediazonium chloride followed by reduction of the resulting aryl azo compound with Zn in acetic acid afforded triaminopyrimidine (\u2212)-13. 2-Propanol was selected as the co-solvent over ethanol due to the formation of side products from reaction with ethanol.16 Cyclization of (\u2212)-13 with triethyl orthoformate in the presence of catalytic acid provided chloroguanine (\u2212)-14. Careful monitoring of the reaction time was necessary to prevent substitution of the 6-Cl group with ethanol, which formed an inseparable byproduct.17 Chloroguanine (\u2212)-14 was refluxed in 0.33 M NaOH for 2 h to produce 5\u2032-homocarbovir (\u2212)-3a in 60% yield (Scheme 4\n).

We envisioned a route that required minimal modification from our method to (\u2212)-3a and (\u2212)-3b. Cyclopentenol (\u2212)-7 was treated with 3-oxo-3-(2,2,2-trifluoroethoxy)propanoic acid 8 under Mitsunobu conditions to form allyl 2,2,2-trifluoroethyl malonate (\u2212)-15 in high yield with the expected inversion of configuration at C-4\u2032 (Scheme 5\n). Pd(0)-mediated decarboxylative rearrangement of allyl 2,2,2-trifluoroethyl malonate (\u2212)-15 proceeded with complete diastereo- and regio-control. The retention of configuration during this process is again noteworthy. Reduction of (+)-16 with 2 equiv of diisobutylaluminum hydride (DIBAL-H) yielded the desired alcohol (+)-17. With the new C-4\u2032 stereochemistry established, construction of the chloroguanine base proceeded as described for the synthesis of the syn-1,4-disubstituted cyclopentene derivative. Chloroguanine (+)-20 was synthesized in five steps from alcohol (+)-17.",
