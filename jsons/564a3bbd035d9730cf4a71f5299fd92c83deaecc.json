To our delight, functionalization at the benzylic position occurred as expected, affording a, b-unsaturated carboxylamide 2a in a 23% yield ( Table 1 , entry 1). Control experiments showed that this reaction proceeded with similar results in the absence of AgOAc, while the reaction did not occur without KOAc (Table 1 , entries 2e4). Then, various Lewis acids were screened in this reaction ( Table 1 , entries 5e9). When one equivalent of PbCl 2 was used as the Lewis acid, the yield of product 2a increased to 55% along with some amount of sulfide product 3a (Table 1 , entry 9). The effect of the base on the reaction was screened with various bases. The results of this screening indicated that potassium acetate and sodium acetate are the most favorable bases for this reaction ( Table 1 , entries 9e11 and details in supporting information). When the reaction was carried out in air or under O 2 atmosphere, the yield of product decreased (Table 1 , entries 12e13). In contrast, under N 2 , the reaction afforded product 2a in a 65% yield ( Table 1, entries 14) . This indicated that the oxidizing reagents hindered the reaction from proceeding. The effect of temperature on the reaction was subsequently investigated, which showed that temperatures either above 160 C or below 150 C were not suitable for this reaction ( Table 1 , entries 14e17). Finally, optimized reaction conditions of PbCl 2 (1.5 equiv) and KOAc (1.5 equiv) in DMSO at 156 C in a sealed tube under N 2 for 13 h gave the product 2a in 77% yield and 3a in 12% yields, respectively (Table 1 , entry 17). Interestingly, when Ac 2 O was used instead of PbCl 2 , sulfide product 3a was obtained in 50% yield (Table 1 , entry 18).
