Why are they important specifically to American dentists?",

It is the operational research capacity that often is in short supply in these deprived communities and nations. That constitutes a major barrier to moving any development agenda forward. Governments, businesses, academic institutions, philanthropies or even organized communities of advocates can move forward only with a better and stronger body of research evidence, if but to avoid the pitfalls of wasteful spending of scarce resources.

If health professionals can and will organize themselves to address this issue of global health and associated health research and training, they could be effective and normative role models for others.

By advocating for a greater investment in global health research and associated capacity building for research (that is, strengthening the research labor force and providing adequate research infrastructure) in a manner that is inclusive of oral health research, this nation will be able to generate and share data that will enable and drive strategic and evidence-based interventions to enhance health and oral health. There is much to be learned from the experiences of other countries, both industrialized and developing, in that issues of health and science know no geographic borders. The United States will benefit as it does now from the research findings reported by scientists abroad or by teams of scientists that include the U.S. scientific community. Our future depends on such flexibility to work across countries and to pool expertise with others in a free and open-access environment. Only through international collaboration will dentistry achieve its highest potential. This is not a new idea; it was articulated explicitly in the American Dental Association's 2001 report \u201cFuture of Dentistry: Today's Vision, Tomorrow's Reality.\u201d6\n",

Whether joint symposia are organized, global congresses are planned or collective action is undertaken to sustain oral health expertise at global levels, the U.S. dental community already has come together and is learning from innovations occurring globally.

Science is the bridge between countries that can make the difference. Science can enable people to work together effectively for common and mutual benefit, removing the barriers of inequality, moving toward social justice globally and finding new ways to prevent, diagnose and treat diseases, not only in the world's poorest countries but also in our own as well. As Michael Leavitt, secretary of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, testified before the Senate Appropriations Subcommittee on Labor, Health and Human Services, Education and Related Agencies in May, \u201cHealth holds a special place as a foreign-policy tool. It is a universal and fundamental desire of all people, and is a common concern among almost every electorate in the world.\u201d7 Secretary Leavitt should be lauded for his leadership in helping to establish the Latin American Health Initiative, which will begin in 2008, in no small part because oral health care and oral disease prevention are among the services provided in this inaugural health services package.",
