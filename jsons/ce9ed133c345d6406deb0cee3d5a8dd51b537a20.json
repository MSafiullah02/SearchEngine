            "text": "The central government of the Socialist Republic of Vietnam and Hanoi's municipal authorities are enthusiastically embracing a series of plans and policies for the capital city to create a sustainable megacity. This state imaginary privileges 'modern' mobilities, championing highways, a bus rapid transport system, and an elevated metro, while so called 'traditional' means of moving around the city such as motorbikes, bicycles, or cyclos are being strongly discouraged and increasingly marginalised. For example, Hanoi officials are implementing a step-wise ban on motorbikes from downtown streets by 2030, while the majority of the urban population travels by motorbike, with about five million motorbikes plying the city's streets. While such an approach not only creates mobility injustice for lower socio-economic residents of the city as a whole, it threatens to undermine the livelihoods of thousands of informal motorbike taxi drivers (locally known as xe \u00f4m). In this article I engage with the emerging mobility injustice literature to explore how state discourses regarding urban modernisation are impacting the possibilities for Hanoi's xe \u00f4m drivers to maintain access to city streets and viable livelihoods. These drivers must negotiate emerging and often conflicting state policies, their enforcement, as well as new app-based competitors, all of which challenge the equitable distribution of motility and produce important frictions. Nonetheless, xe \u00f4m drivers draw on their agency and creativity during their daily routines to push back, while also creating new narratives regarding their vital role in maintaining neighbourhood security. We thus see how marginalised individuals are counteracting policies they consider unjust, even when this urban agenda is embedded in a politically socialist context.

Negotiating the curve of a new narrative. 1 The Master Plan was designed by a consortium including the New York Architect Firm, Perkins Eastman, and two Korean firms Posco E&C and Jina Architects, along with the Vietnamese Institute of Architecture, Urban and Rural Planning, and the Hanoi Urban Planning Institute (Lamster, 2011). While a positive feature in itself, it should be noted that the proposed green corridors may lengthen distances and time between key services with respect to mobility. 2 There is an important body of work regarding informal motorbike taxi drivers focusing on cities in sub-Saharan Africa (see Evans et al. 2018 for a review). Far less research has been completed in Southeast Asia, but see Oshima et al. (2007) and Sopranzetti (2017) regarding motorbike taxi drivers in Bangkok, and Karis (2013) concerning migrant xe \u00f4m driver experiences in Hanoi.

            "text": "In the urban metropolises of the Global South, informal transportation options such as minibuses, tuktuks, cyclos (trishaws) and motorbikes, with flexible fares, timetables, and routes enable those with limited financial means to access services and employment, and to move goods for themselves or smallscale businesses. With limited large-scale, planned transportation schemes, these alternatives are often the only means by which millions of people can travel on a daily basis, making a major contribution to urban mobility (Evans et al., 2018 ). Yet increasingly, such means of transportation are being seen as outdated and obsolete, failing to fit modern urban transportation ideals, with policies being implemented to restrict their operations (Eidse et al., 2016; Doherty, 2017; Sopranzetti, 2018) . Such policies increase mobility injustice for lower socio-economic residents in Global South cities, as well as for the operators of these vehicles themselves (Evans et al. 2018 ). This paper focuses on such tensions in Hanoi, the capital of the Socialist Republic of Vietnam. In a city with a rapidly changing urban form, I examine the degree to which contemporary transportation plans and policies are creating mobility injustice for a specific category of road-users, the city's informal motorbike taxi drivers, locally known as xe \u00f4m ('hug vehicle'), and how these individuals attempt to adapt and respond.",

            "text": "In August 2008, Vietnam's Prime Minister Nguy\u1ec5n T\u1ea5n D\u0169ng announced that the official territory of Hanoi would increase three-fold overnight, also resulting in a doubling of the city's population to 6.2 million inhabitants (Prime Minister of Vietnam, 2008) . This was an initial step in a concerted drive by Vietnam's central government and Hanoi's municipal authorities to create a mega-city that would be prosperous, 'civilised and modern' (\u0111\u00f4 th\u1ecb v\u0103n minh, hi\u1ec7n \u0111\u1ea1i) (Coe, 2015) . Yet while aiming for a population of over 10 million by 2030 -compared with 7.7 million in 2019 -the authorities also want Hanoi to be the world's first 'sustainable city'. To meet this goal, and despite concerns raised by Vietnamese architects over the process, lack of local input, and design flaws, the 'Hanoi Capital Construction Master Plan to 2030 and Vision to 2050' was approved by the Prime Minister in July 2011 (VietnamNet, 17/7/2009; Socialist Republic of Vietnam, 2011) . Promoted by a slick advertising campaign, this plan was designed with foreign consultants from the US and South Korea, and now guides the city's 'sustainable development' and changing urban form. It aims to fashion a sustainable mega-city by preserving a significant amount of J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f green space, with 60 percent of urban land allocated to green corridors and 40 percent to urban development (S\u00f6derstr\u00f6m 2014) . Satellite cities in the enlarged city-region are a key feature, along with plans for rapid mass transport infrastructure. 1 As part of this city makeover, the municipal government is implementing a bus rapid transit system and an elevated metro system (Nguyen, 2017) . After numerous delays, the first metro line, for which construction began in 2011, is expected to start operations sometime in late 2020. The government is also designing new transportation corridors and investing heavily in highways and expressways (despite the contradictions this might imply vis-\u00e0-vis creating a more sustainable city). These transportation plans have entailed the destruction of house and shop-fronts, the widening of traditional alleyways, and the reorganisation of neighbourhoods. Moreover, critics claim that \"there is very little inter-connectivity between [metro] platforms and other transportation nodes\" and a \"lack of coherence and vision in the transport policy calls into question its ability to solve mobility problems\" (Leducq and Scarwell, 2018: 74) . Gibert and Pham Thai Son (2016: 33) add that \"the metropolitan authorities have come up with new priorities, beginning with the need for traffic fluidity, which reveals the rise in power of a neofunctionalism perspective concerning urban planning in Vietnam today\" (see also Schwanen 2018) . As a telling materialization of this approach, despite the fact that over five million motorbikes ply the city's streets as opposed to only half a million cars, the Hanoi People's Council has proposed to ban motorbikes from downtown streets by 2030 ( BBC News, 4 July 2017; Hansen, 2017) .",

I then track the specific plans and policies that are shaping mobility options in Hanoi, before turning to introduce the daily spatial practices of the city's informal motorbike taxi (xe \u00f4m) drivers. 2 Here I analyse their daily routines, and the mobility injustices these individuals face due to state policies, as well as police procedures and new app-based competitors. I also draw attention to the daily actions that xe \u00f4m drivers undertake to maintain their place on the street, as they push back against what they believe to be state-endorsed injustices, while also out-smarting their new competitors. Finally, I highlight the means by which xe \u00f4m drivers in the city are attempting to shift the narrative around their profession. This paper draws on 76 semi-structured interviews with independent xe \u00f4m drivers (not linked to an appbased company), undertaken during 11 months of fieldwork between 2016 and 2019, completed by myself and/or my Vietnamese female research assistant. These interviews focused on driver livelihoods, their everyday routines, the challenges they face due to changing municipal policies, and their perceived roles in their local neighbourhoods. Of these 76 drivers, 74 were men and two were women, a fairly representative proportion of xe \u00f4m in the city, with women drivers being uncommon. 'Ride-along' interviews (Kusenbach 2003) were undertaken with eight additional male xe \u00f4m drivers in 2017. During these rides a smartphone application was used to map the route and photos were taken of decision making points (cross-roads, roundabouts etc.). Informal interviews were completed with the drivers as they drove or immediately afterwards (while showing them the photos just taken) to gain information on decision making points. Additional semi-structured interviews were also completed with 26 motorbike drivers working for app-based firms (at that time UberMoto and GrabBike, before UberMoto was acquired by Grab in 2018), and a further five semi-structured interviews were conducted with urban planners and planning academics. Finally, 52 conversational interviews with Hanoi residents focused on their opinions and use of independent xe \u00f4m and app-based motorbike taxis, bringing the total number of interviews for this research to over 160.",

As such, Cook and Butz (2018) conceive mobility justice as focusing on fair access to motility across society, as well as unprejudiced institutional decision-making processes. More specifically, Sheller (2016: 15) explains that: \"Mobility may be considered a universal human right, yet in practice it exists in relation to class, racial, sexual, gendered, and disabling exclusions from public space, from national citizenship, and from the means of mobility at all scales\". With a focus here on xe \u00f4m drivers in Hanoi, exclusions based on class, gender, age, and technological savviness are particularly salient, as is the local political context. Yet, to suggest that mobility injustice exists in a world of vastly unequal power is rather obvious, with the balance tipped structurally in favour of those with the largest holdings of economic and symbolic capital (Bourdieu, 1984) . Thus, I argue that a core value of the mobility injustice concept is to highlight hidden inequalities, while also being a call to action. Vukov (2015: 113) notes \"the need to call into question the disciplining and policing of embodied movement that goes into legitimizing normative forms of movement\". Nonnormative modes of mobility often disrupt the plans and goals of those in positions of power, which can result in rapid responses by such power-holders, furthering mobility injustice (ibid.).",

The People's Council Deputy, Nguy\u1ec5n Ti\u1ebfn Minh, argued that: \"Some 70 per cent of traffic accidents are related to motorbikes, which proves that motorbike drivers are those at the highest risk of road accidents\" (cited in Vietnam News, 5/7/2017).",

            "text": "Given the fact that there is about a 10:1 ratio of motorbikes to cars, this degree of involvement of motorbikes in accidents is perfectly logical, perhaps even low, and makes a rather weak argument for their ban. Other reasons given for the ban have included congestion (Vietnam News, 5/7/2017) and pollution (Al Jazeera, 29/7/2018). While Hanoi's streets are congested with motorbikes, cars, and buses, and one could argue that Hanoi has reached 'peak motorbike', replacing motorbikes with cars and buses is unlikely to ease congestion in the near future. 3 Pollution is also a questionable rationale for specifically targeting 4-stroke low-cc motorbikes while coal-fired power plants, heavy industry, seasonal agricultural burning, and even strong winds bringing pollution from Chengdu and Chongqing in southwest China have all been found to be important causes of the city's pollution woes (Al Jazeera, 29/7/2018). This will not be the first time that the municipal authorities try to implement a ban on motorbikes; the last attempt was in the early 2000s but authorities were forced to backtrack as the public transport system could not meet the increase in demand (The Economist, 7/7/2017). This time, the decree includes a focus on developing multimodal public transportation to serve 50-55 per cent of residents' needs in the central urban area, and 40 percent in satellite areas by 2030, while motorbikes are being gradually limited in specific city areas and will be banned in inner districts by 2030 (Socialist Republic of Vietnam, 2017; Vietnam News, 5/7/2017). These steps are very much in line with Vietnam's northern neighbour, where over 30 Chinese cities have restricted or banned motorbikes -with an associated drastic increase in the sale of cars (South China Morning Post, 13/2/2004). The decree for Hanoi also plans similar restrictions on electric bicycles and cyclos, while cars will require automatic toll collection equipment to be installed for inner city areas -without regulation of their polluting power -and taxi numbers are to be increased (Socialist Republic of Vietnam, 2017). 4 While state officials are pinning their hopes on the new bus rapid transit system and the still to be completed elevated metro system to fill the gap, a former World Bank official has noted: \"There is no evidence from the experience of other cities that just building new transit lines creates a shift in demand toward transit away from individual vehicles like motorcycles and cars. This is especially true when the use of individual means of motorized transport have been prevalent over many years, as is the case in Hanoi\" (Bertaud, 2011: 11) .",

While state newspaper articles often cite 'widespread consultation' with regards to a specific new policy, this commonly refers to state ministries and ministerial-level agencies producing feedback on government plans. As state employees, these officials know better than to rock the boat. S\u00f6derstr\u00f6m (2014: 72) adds: \"Masterplanning in Hanoi can thus be seen as an aesthetic and political exercise, but it can also be seen as a useful smoke-screen behind which real development takes place\". In a similar vein, Albrecht et al. (2010: 28) add: \"Decision-making processes are extremely discreet. Their mysteries and protagonists are known and controlled by just a handful of individuals\u2026This Vietnamese cocktail is subtle and effective. It is conciliatory regarding the past, holds society firmly in the present and allows the new economy to develop\". Moreover, 'elected' government officials usually have a non-renewable four year mandate, so they often focus on short term development projects and have little interest in longer term visions. While direct contestations over city plans are on the rise, such acts require those involved to have a great deal of patience and courage. 5 4 In comparison, see Zhang et al. (2014) regarding how a number of municipalities in China are currently revisiting previous restrictions on bicycles and electric bikes. 5 Regarding such contestations see Gillespie and Nguyen (2019) on how Hanoians used social media and street protests in 2015 to voice their concerns regarding a tree-felling dispute. As the authors note, these protests \"disrupted the government's expectations about who can participate in urban governance\" (ibid.: 978). Also see S\u00f6derstr\u00f6m and Geertman (2013) for details of how international non-state actors have started to expand and influence discussions on public space use in Hanoi. Wells-Dang (2012) also considers how informal networks have helped provide channels for creative advocacy, while Kerkvliet (2019) investigates the rise of public political criticism.",

This campaign, which includes the clearing of street stalls, motorbike parking, and even motorbike ramps, was initiated in Hanoi in early 2017, with its policing fluctuating since then (Vietnam News, 17/5/2017). Nonetheless, it tends to be strictly enforced in certain locales like tourist areas and around marketplaces, which are the ideal locales for xe \u00f4m drivers to wait for customers. A 52 year old driver waiting outside the city's main dried goods market \u0110\u1ed3ng Xu\u00e2n (Figure 2 ) explained: \"The new law to clear the roads and sidewalks affects our work a lot. I know that we're now breaking the law by waiting here, but we still have to earn a living. We can't do anything except suffer from it\" (interview, 2017). This xe \u00f4m driver's comments highlight how rights to certain public spaces and livelihoods in Hanoi are directly impacted by such policy initiatives, underlining the fact that \"the ability to stay in place is just as if not more important than access to unfettered mobility\" (Montegary and White, 2015: 4).

Stillerman, 2006) .

The current Master Plan and related transportation and other 'development' policies mean that inequitable mobility is likely to increase in the near future, especially when the motorbike ban is fully enforced. This push for a certain vision of modernity not only undermines the informal livelihoods of thousands of independent xe \u00f4m drivers, but is destabilising time-honoured, relevant forms of local cultural behaviour based on solidarity, trust, and compassion. As a result, complex, organic social relationships that appear to be beneficial to neighbourhood security and well-being and that shape a specific urban texture are being disrupted. Or, put another way, the Vietnamese state appears to be throwing the baby out with the bath water.",

Yet, with their everyday, micro-level, spatial practices, independent xe \u00f4m drivers do resist dominant mobility paradigms with flexible and creative approaches. They warn friends of police blocks, navigate around the city to avoid fines and bribes, and imitate GrabBike drivers to reach a broader customer base. Xe \u00f4m drivers build trust with customers, neighbours, and shop keepers, many of whom they have known for years, in very local and situated ways, while remaining highly mobile, navigating the city with their vehicles and bodies, and transgressing geographical and social boundaries (see also Sopranzetti 2018) . Concurrently, they have also succeeded to some degree in creating a new narrative regarding their rights to certain spaces. I thus suggest that 'micro counter-spaces' are being shaped via their actions, opening up space for alternative narratives to be heard and acknowledged by a range of actors. Yet, will they be able to take this further?",

Such an exhibition has yet to occur and the 2020 Coronavirus outbreak throws these livelihoods into an even more tenuous situation. Nonetheless, there is still hope that in their low-key, daily decisions, manoeuvers, and unexpected actions, these independent xe \u00f4m drivers will continue to adapt to maintain their livelihoods and access to the city, while contesting and subverting elements of the dominant urban planning model being put forward by powerful actors.",
