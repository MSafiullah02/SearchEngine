Adverse ocular effects in humans have received considerable attention and evaluations for chemically induced ocular toxicity are commonly performed, but usually in species other than rodents. The albino rat is a less than ideal model for retinal toxicity because of the problems encountered with phototoxic retinopathy, the lack of pigment within the pigment epithelial layer, and a relatively high incidence of spontaneous retinal lesions. However, rodents have become popular in the study of glaucoma because of their ready availability, relative low cost, short life spans, and amenability to experimental and genetic manipulation. Toxicity and carcinogenicity studies in rats typically include the microscopic examination of a single histological section of each eye. This can only be considered a screening procedure for overt ocular toxicity. When a chemical is considered likely to have ocular toxicity, additional evaluations in other species should be considered.",

As the vesicle approaches the surface ectoderm, it involutes to form the optic cup. The inner (inverted) layer of the optic cup will develop into the retina, the nonpigmented ciliary epithelium, and the posterior iris epithelium, whereas the outer layer becomes the retinal pigment epithelium (RPE), the pigmented ciliary epithelium, and the anterior iris epithelium. Contact of the optic vesicle with the surface ectoderm stimulates the formation of the lens placode, which invaginates to form the lens vesicle. By day 14, the lens vesicle has separated from the surface ectoderm and remains in the optic cup. In the separated lens vesicle, the posterior epithelial cells differentiate and elongate to become primary fibers, leaving epithelium only on the anterior surface. From these anterior epithelial cells, secondary fibers develop continuously over the lifetime of the rat (Figure 16.1\n).",

Although melanosomes form in the pigment epithelium of the fetus, they disappear several weeks after birth in albino rats. Along with the pigment epithelium, the adult retina is composed of several different types of neurons (photoreceptors, horizontal, bipolar, amacrine, and ganglion cells) and one type of specialized glial cell (M\u00fcller) organized into three distinct cellular layers. The neuronal cells and the M\u00fcller glia arise from a common pool of multipotent retinal progenitor cells. The sequence of development of these cell types is well conserved across the vertebrate species. Although there is considerable overlap in the production of retinal cell types at any time point, during embryogenesis, ganglion cells are generated first, followed by cone photoreceptors, horizontal cells, and most of the amacrine cells. Generated postnatally are the bipolar neurons, M\u00fcller glia, the remaining amacrine neurons, and most rod photoreceptors. The retina also contains astrocytes, endothelial cells, and microglia; however, these arise from separate lineages.",

It consists of laminated fibers formed by modified epithelial cells and enclosed by a capsule. A simple cuboidal epithelium is present beneath the capsule on the anterior and equatorial surfaces. The cells at the anterior pole are relatively inactive. Lens epithelial cells in the germinative zone of the peripheral equatorial region undergo mitosis, and their progeny are displaced posteriorly into the transitional zone, where they begin to differentiate into cortical fiber cells of the lens substance, a process regulated by a fibroblast growth factor gradient. Fiber differentiation results in distinct molecular and morphologic changes, e.g., exit from the cell cycle, elongation, loss of cytoplasmic organelles and nuclei, and accumulation of crystallin proteins. The proteins of the lens are typically organ and species specific. The nuclear bow comprises remnants of nuclei that are lost in the process of fiber formation. The tips of the differentiating fibers eventually join to form the anterior and posterior suture lines visible by slit-lamp biomicroscopy. Because the small diameter of the globe necessitates a high dioptric power of the lens, the size of the lens relative to that of the eye is remarkably large in rats compared to humans.

From there, as in other species with a holangiotic vascular pattern, symmetrically arranged retinal arteries (approximately six) radiate to the equator, supplying two layers of capillaries to the inner retina: one in the outer plexiform layer and one in the inner plexiform layer. The choroid is supplied by branches from two long posterior ciliary arteries, one nasal and one temporal, and several short posterior ciliary arteries. These vessels form arterioles and capillaries (choriocapillaris) directly beneath the Bruch\u2019s membrane. The choroidal circulation nourishes the outer retina (RPE and photoreceptor cells). Anteriorly, the main ciliary vessels divide dichotomously and form the major arterial circle of the iris. The major arterial circle gives rises to arteries supplying the iris and ciliary body. In the region of the ciliary body, and prior to the formation of the major arterial circle, each long posterior ciliary artery communicates with the arterial component of the corneoscleral vascular circle. This limbal vascular plexus is also supplied externally by the anterior ciliary arteries, providing a potential collateral blood supply to the anterior segment analogous to that of primates. Blood is drained from the eye chiefly by four vortex veins, located just posterior to the equator on the dorsal, ventral, nasal, and temporal sides.

Highly irregular in shape, it is unified medially and subdivided laterally by three clefts, through which pass the optic nerve and several extraocular muscles. It closely apposes the orbital venous sinus. The gland weighs 290\u2013360 mg (0.07\u20130.08% of body weight) in 18 week old rats. A single excretory duct originates at the hilus and opens on the outer (nasal) side of the third eyelid. The gland is a branched tubuloalveolar gland without distinct intralobular ducts. Alveoli are lined by columnar cells with numerous clear cytoplasmic vacuoles and round basal nuclei; the alveolar lumina appear empty or contain yellow-brown wispy strands or laminated concretions of porphyrin secretion. Two types of secretory cells are distinguishable based on size and shape of secretory granules. Type A cells are more numerous and contain large secretory vacuoles, whereas type B cells contain abundant mitochondria and packets of smooth endoplasmic reticulum. Flattened myoepithelial cells are situated between the secretory cells and the basal lamina surrounding the alveoli, but are not easily distinguished in histological sections. The secretory product of the Harderian gland consists primarily of lipids (wax esters), which are released into the lumen by the process of exocytosis (merocrine-type secretion); the Harderian gland is the only mammalian gland known to secrete lipid by this method. Epithelial cells also produce and secrete porphyrin. The production of indoleamines is a function the Harderian gland shares with the pineal gland and retina. Of the major head and neck glands of the rat, the Harderian gland has the highest density of lymphatics (Figure 16.10\n).",

Capture of light results in the isomerization of 11-cis-retinal to all-trans-retinal, the formation of photoactive visual pigment, and activation of the transduction cascade. Bleaching of the visual pigment increases the calcium conductance of the vesicular membranes and promotes the diffusion of calcium to the intracellular space, where it acts on the cell membrane, reducing its permeability to sodium and promoting hyperpolarization. The signal generated is transmitted to the bipolar cells and then the ganglion cells, which create action potentials along their axons and relay the information to the central nervous system. Horizontal cells receive an excitatory synaptic input from the cones and make an inhibitory output back onto the cones. Amacrine cells receive a direct excitatory input from bipolar cells and make inhibitory inputs back onto the axon terminals of the bipolar cells.

Microvilli on the surface of the pigment epithelium invest and phagocytose the distal tip of the photoreceptor outer segments. These internalized disks contain the molecules that are recycled and subsequently redelivered to the photoreceptor cells.

In the young rat, lens proteins are largely soluble and the lens absorbs little UV radiation; indeed, the absorption spectrum in the eye of juvenile rats resembles that of the aphakic eye. In the aging rat, there is an increase in the concentration of insoluble proteins and a decrease in soluble proteins, resulting in increased density of the nucleus. Increased nuclear density results in optical discontinuity between the cortical region and the nucleus, recognizable on slit-lamp biomicroscopy. Lens fibers within the aged nucleus show decreased affinity for eosin compared to the cortical fibers, resulting in a pale lens center in hematoxylin- and eosin-stained sections. Other age-related changes in the rat lens include the development of small vacuoles associated with the anterior and posterior suture lines and the presence of irregularly swollen lens fibers with finely granular cytoplasm in the anterior cortex\u2014recognized as segmental striations originating in the periphery and forming an arcuate pattern on slit-lamp examination.",

The location of light-induced retinal damage tends to mirror the light path, with more severe damage being seen in the posterior pole than in the peripheral retina. Rats exposed to a 12 h light:dark cycle at 32 footcandles show thinning of the outer nuclear layer of the central superior retina (midway between the ora ciliaris retinae and the optic nerve). From the normal 12 layers at 6 months of age, the cellularity shows progressive reduction to 10, 8, or 6 nuclei or less by 9, 18, and 24 months, respectively. More intense exposure to light\u2014related to increased time of the light cycle or increased intensity of light\u2014or elevated body temperatures may lead to almost complete loss of the photoreceptor and outer nuclear layers. Retinal capillary diameter increases and there is thickening of the basement membrane. With time, the inner nuclear layer will also disappear and capillaries may invade the vitreous and the lens. Albino rats are more susceptible than pigmented strains because melanin in the RPE and uveal tract limits light fluxes in the retina; however, pupillary dilatation can override the protective effect of melanin. Interpretation of toxicity studies may be confounded if photoreceptor loss due to light exposure is exacerbated by test articles that cause mydriasis (Figure 16.24, Figure 16.25\n).",

It acts during the G phase of the cell cycle, permitting normal DNA synthesis, but preventing mitosis. Some of these cells undergo degeneration and necrosis. Because the cells in the equatorial zone have the shortest intermitotic time, they are affected first, leading to disorganization of the nuclear bow and lens fibers. Triparanol, a blood-cholesterol-lowering agent that inhibits cholesterol synthesis, also induces cataracts in rats. It causes a 10-fold increase in lens sodium content with hydration and swelling of the lens fibers. Following cessation of treatment, the cataracts are reversed as new fibers are laid down in the periphery, excess Na+ and water are pumped out, and K+ levels are returned to normal. Sodium selenite induces nuclear cataract in 4\u20136 days if given to suckling rats before completion of the critical lens maturation period at approximately day 16. Sodium selenite appears to alter lens epithelial metabolism, resulting in calcium accumulation, calpain activation, and proteolysis and precipitation of crystallins in the nucleus. Cataracts are also experimentally induced in rats by feeding a diet containing high levels of galactose. Galactose is phosphorylated to galactose-6-phosphate or reduced by aldose reductase to dulcitol. Because dulcitol is not further metabolized, it accumulates in the lens and exerts a strong osmotic force, drawing water into the lens. The excessive hydration of the lens produces the initial vacuolization and opacification. However, continued feeding results in an irreversible mature nuclear cataract.",

Taurine plays an important role in maintaining photoreceptor cell structure and function. In the rat, more than half of the retinal store of taurine is located in the photoreceptor layer, and depletion causes degeneration of these cells in rats as well as cats. Retinal taurine deficiency induced by vigabatrin, a GABA-transaminase inhibitor used to treat seizures, causes peripheral outer retinal disorganization and widespread cone degeneration in rats. Taurine transport antagonists, such as guanidinoethyl sulfonate, inhibit taurine uptake by the pigment epithelium and produce photoreceptor cell degeneration.
