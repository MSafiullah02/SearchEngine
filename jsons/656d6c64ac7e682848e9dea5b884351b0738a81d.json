Recommendations 88 continue to evolve in terms of practice guidelines and many state and consensus guidelines 89 recommend minimizing non-urgent procedures and patient contact in order to conserve personal 90 protective equipment and limit patient and physician exposure. 1 She underwent wide local excision with 5.0 mm margins with a resulting 3.0 cm wide by 7.5 cm 130 long defect. The wound could not be easily approximately with digital pressure (Fig 4) . In order to avoid a flap or graft closure and to eliminate her need for a future suture removal, we decided 132 to use the ARS device. The skin around the defect was cleaned and dried. An ARS strip was 133 applied to the middle portion on each side of the wound (Fig 5) . A 2-0 nylon retention suture was 134 used to suture through the central holes of the ARS device using a simple interrupted pattern.",

First, the ARS device, which is approximately 30 thousandths of an inch thick,169    slightly elevates the suture above the skin surface. This eliminates the problem of ingrown170    sutures, which would significantly complicate patient removal. Ingrown sutures can lead to 171 complications such as increased patient pain, wound bleeding, incomplete suture removal and 172 possibly wound dehiscence. 7 Second, the large bite retention suture, over the course of two 173 weeks of retention, will gradually stretch out, making it easier to get the scissors underneath the 174 circle of suture. In our case, the patient had only large scissors but was still able to easily cut the 175 retention suture.176Other techniques for wound closure can also be considered which have decreased in-office 178 follow up such as topical adhesives or fast absorbing gut suture. We believe that use of these 179 alone without the ARS device would not provide effective closure for wounds under high180 tension. Previous studies have found similar cosmetic outcomes between cyanoacrylate and fast 181 absorbing gut for closure of linear wounds on the face, but other studies found fast absorbing gut 182 was superior to cyanoacrylate for linear closures of high tension wounds on the trunk and 183 extremities. 8,9 The use of fast absorbing gut is limited by tensile strength which is maintained for 184 about five days leading to an increased risk for wound dehiscence especially on fragile skin 185 under tension. The high inflammatory tissue response to fast gut should also be considered as 186 this can be distressing to patients and affect the cosmetic outcome. 8 In contrast the to ARS, other 187 adhesive closure devices such as Clozex, (Clozex Medical Inc; Wellesley, MA) and Zip Surgical 188 (Strkyer Corporation; Kalamazoo, MI) are meant to provide only superficial wound support. 189 They are meant to be used on wounds that have tension reduced with some other closure 190 technique (e.g. standard buried absorbable sutures, barbed sutures or retention sutures). We have 191 not done cases in which we combined the ARS with Clozex, Zip Surgical or other superficial 192 closure device. When we have omitted superficial absorbable sutures, we have successfully used 193 acrylate glue for superficial wound support. Acrylate glue has the added benefit of reduced 194 wound exudate to reduce wound care.195 196We have used the ARS on over 50 wounds with no cases developing a contact allergy or 197 intolerance to the adhesive. We advise most patients keep the wound clean and dry post-198 operatively. Patients routinely tell us that the device is well-tolerated and gives them a sense of 199 security that the skin will not tear.

Over the next few months, as dermatologic surgeons 209 adjust to the constant changing of our practice due to COVID-19, we hope that the method 210 outlined in this case series give providers and patients additional tools for wound closure.
