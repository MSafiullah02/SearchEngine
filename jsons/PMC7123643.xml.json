Alkylating agents can cause mutations not unlike those produced by radiation. These mutations occasionally lead to transformation. One form of cancer that may arise is a relatively rare type of acute non-lymphocytic leukemia (ANL). Highly treatment resistant cases appear as early as 2 years following initial therapy and peak around 5 years after exposure to alkylating agents. The risk of osteosarcomata may be elevated after the treatment of childhood cancers with alkylating agents.",

The drug also has therapeutic activity against multiple myeloma, and indolent B-cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma that has progressed within 6 months of treatment with a rituximab containing regimen. For these conditions, bendamustine has strong efficacy as well as low cross-resistance with other alkylating agents and fludarabine. The agent causes DNA damage that leads to cell death via several pathways, including apoptosis and mitotic catastrophe. A standard dose is 100\u2013120 mg/m2 body surface area, administered intravenously over a period of 30\u201360 min, for chronic lymphocytic leukemia on days 1 and 2 of a 28-day cycle up to six cycles, for non-Hodgkin lymphoma on days 1 and 2 of a 21-day cycle up to eight cycles.",

It yields the inactive, mono-functional alkylating metabolites 2- and 3-dechloroethyl-ifosfamide and produces the toxic byproduct chloroacetaldehyde.

It is caused by drug metabolites that agonize AMPA/Kainate Receptors and induce cellular acidification in cortical neurons. The metabolite chloroacetaldehyde may lead to the formation of chloroacetic acid and then to S-carboxymethylcysteine (SCMC) after conjugation with the amino acid cysteine. S-carboxymethylcysteine can account for about 80 % of the administered dose of ifosfamide (K\u00fcpfer et al. 1996), which is then further degraded metabolically to thiodiglycolic acid (TDGA) (Hofmann et al. 1991).

The drug may also be used in the treatment of metastatic melanoma and is effective against mycosis fungoides. Temozolomide is available in capsules and is taken orally. The initial dosage is determined based on body height and weight. The typical dose for the first treatment cycle is 150 mg per day taken for five consecutive days, with each treatment cycle lasting 28 days. The number of treatment cycles depends on patient tolerane for the drug and its effectiveness in treating the cancer. The maximum tolerated dose is 1000 mg/m2/cycle in both children and adults.

It was first tested as a potential central nervous system anti-tumor agent in the early 1960s and displayed substantial activity in both intracerebral and intraperitoneal leukemias, as well as activity in solid tumors.",

Due to the affinity of PtII for sulfur binding, platinum drugs can bind to Glutathione, Metallothionein, and serum Albumin. Therefore, the cellular thiol levels are associated with drug resistance.increased resistance to apoptosis. The kinase PKB (Protein Kinase B, AKT) promotes cell survival and down-regulates apoptosis. An elevated activity of PKB associated pathways protects cells from apoptotic death induced by cisplatin. c-ABL is a member of the SRC family of non-receptor tyrosine kinases, which also carries a DNA binding motif. Nuclear c-ABL activity can be stimulated by cisplatin and acts to transmit DNA damage signals. Because c-ABL tyrosine kinase has a role in cisplatin mediated activation of apoptosis, a reduction in its activity can confer cisplatin resistance. The P53 pathway can partially mediate cisplatin cytotoxicity. Many tumors harbor defective P53 and are deficient in this pathway.enhanced repair of platinum-DNA adducts. Cisplatin-DNA adducts are removed primarily by the nucleotide excision repair mechanism. High levels of nucleotide repair proteins in cancer cells can mediate resistance. The favorable clinical response of testicular cancer to cisplatin reflects, in part, its intrinsically low levels of the nucleotide excision repair proteins XPA and ERCC1/XPF. DNA Polymerase \u03b7 is a lesion bypass polymerase that aids tumor cells to gain resistance against cisplatin based chemotherapy. It allows cells to reduplicate DNA across cross-link lesions such as 1,2-d(GpG) cisplatin adducts (Pt-GG).\n",

The main uses include ovarian carcinoma, lung cancers, and head and neck cancers. The agent possesses tumoricidal activity similar to that of its parent compound , but is more stable and less toxic.

In this organoplatinum agent, the platinum atom is complexed with 1,2-diaminocyclohexane (DACH) and with an oxalate ligand as a leaving group. After displacement of the labile oxalate leaving group, active oxaliplatin derivatives (such as monoaquo- and diaquo- 1,2-diaminocyclohexane platinum) alkylate macro-molecules, forming both inter- and intra-strand platinum-DNA cross-links, which result in the inhibition of DNA reduplication and transcription, and in cell cycle non-specific cytotoxicity. The 1,2-diaminocyclohexane side chain may counteract alkylating agent resistance. Oxaliplatin is typically administered by infusion every 2 weeks in combination with fluorouracil and leucovorin for the treatment of advanced colorectal cancer (until the disease progresses or unacceptable toxicity sets in) or for the adjuvant treatment of stage III colon cancer in patients who have undergone complete resection of the primary tumor (12 cycles over 6 months). For this malignancy, oxaliplatin in combination with 5-fluorouracil/folinic acid (5-FU/FA) has increased the response rates from 15 % for 5-fluorouracil alone to over 40 %, although the increases in overall survival rates are modest.

However, transplatin is characterized by a reduced capability to form bifunctional adducts in double helical DNA, and cannot produce DNA 1,2-intra-strand cross-links. Trans-platinum compounds may have value in the treatment of tumors that have developed resistance to cis-platinum compounds.",

Today, chemotherapy is used for all stages of this tumor and testicular cancer is curable in most patients with rates of nearly 80 %, survival being primarily due to effective chemotherapy.

The survival benefits of both regimens are comparable. Neutropenia is more common with EP, while neuropathy and adverse dermatologic effects occur more frequently with BEP.Complete responses are achieved less frequently for patients with intermediate and poor risk germ cell tumors, in whom four cycles of bleomycin, etoposide, and cisplatin (BEP) remains the standard of care. Attempts to improve outcomes by intensifying the BEP regimen (increased cisplatin dose, replacement of bleomycin with ifosfamide, high-dose chemotherapy with autologous stem cell support) have not demonstrated any advantage but have been associated with more intense toxicities.Fewer than 10 % of patients suffer relapses. For those, second- and third-line programs also have curative potential. They include standard doses of 3-drug combinations based on ifosfamide and cisplatin (plus either vinblastine or etoposide or paclitaxel). High-dose salvage chemotherapy has been used since the late 1980s, but was initially limited by high mortality rates. This prompted the addition of growth factor support or autologous stem cell support. At least two high dose cycles are considered necessary to achieve a benefit.

Mithramycin A has been under study for the treatment of testicular cancer, Ewing sarcoma, and chronic myeloid leukemia. Mithramycin A also inhibits bone degradation, which in turn lowers blood calcium. Thus, it is used to treat hyper-calcemia and hyper-calciuria associated with a variety of advanced cancers. Plicamycin is given through intravenous infusion over a period of 4\u20136 h.\n",

The risk for cardiotoxicity is high in patients who have been given cumulative anthracycline doses above 550 mg/m2. It may occur at lower cumulative doses if anthracyclines are given in combination with agents like taxanes or trastuzumab (anti-ERBB2), and possibly also in conjunction with COX-2 inhibitors. The adverse effects include the loss of myofibrils, dilation of the sarcoplasmic reticulum, cytoplasmic vacuolization, swelling of the mitochondria, and increased numbers of lysosomes. The main mechanism of anthracycline dependent cardiac toxicity is the induction of apoptosis. Cardiomyocytes are more susceptible than other tissues because they exhibit low levels of Catalase and readily undergo inactivation of GSH-PX1 (Selenium-Dependent GSH-Peroxidase-1) after drug exposure. Protection from the cardiotoxicity of anthracyclines can be achieved by slow infusion (48\u201396 h), provision of antioxidants (flavonoids), and administration of iron chelators such as dexrazoxane (ICRF-187, ADR 529) <Zinecard, Totect>. According to the American Society for Clinical Oncology (ASCO), the use of dexrazoxane is recommended in",

Extravasation during administration results in severe local tissue necrosis.The use of liposomes as carriers is an approach to decrease anthracycline related cardiac toxicity. Liposomal PEGylated forms of daunorubicin have been designed to increase the amount of drug delivered to tumors and decrease the peak distribution to the heart and gastrointestinal mucosa. This formulation preferentially accumulates in the tumor vasculature, resulting in a sustained targeted release of free daunorubicin in the tumor micro-environment. Peglyation increases the half-life of the liposome through inhibiting its phagocytosis by the reticuloendothelial system.

The drug is an intercalator and a Topoisomerase 2 inhibitor that prevents DNA reduplication and ultimately inhibits protein synthesis. It also generates oxygen free radicals, resulting in the cytotoxic peroxidation of cell membrane lipids. Like many other genotoxic agents, doxorubicin activates the binding of P53 to DNA, likely inducing apoptosis in this manner. P53 activation also contributes to the induction of the p21\nCIP1/WAF1 gene product, which is a strong inhibitor of Cyclin-Dependent Kinases (CDKs) involved in the G1/S transition of the cell cycle.

Doxorubicin is also indicated as a component in the adjuvant therapy for women with axillary lymph node involvement of breast cancer.Liposomes are multi-lamellar lipid particles suitable for drug delivery. They improve doxorubicin penetration into tumors and decrease drug clearance, thereby increasing the duration of therapeutic drug effects. This form may exhibit an improved toxicity profile due to the lower concentrations of free doxorubicin to which non-transformed tissues are exposed. Liposomal PEGylated doxorubicin hydrochloride <Doxil, Dox-SL, Evacet, LipoDox, Caelyx, Doxilen> is a formulation, in which a doxorubicin containing liposome is surrounded by a layer of polyethylene glycol (PEG). Liposomal PEGylated forms of doxorubicin may be indicated for the second-line treatment of ovarian cancer (disease progression or recurrence after platinum based chemotherapy), multiple myeloma (in combination with bortezomib), AIDS-related Kaposi sarcoma (after failure of prior systemic chemotherapy), high grade glioma or glioblastoma or secondary brain tumors, and head and neck squamous cell carcinoma. An intermittent 3-weekly schedule is appropriate, and the maximum tolerated dose is 60\u201390 mg/m2. Hypersensitivity may occur in up to 10 % of patients.Liposomal doxorubicin citrate (TLC D-99) <Myocet> is a liposome encapsulated form of the doxorubicin citrate salt that does not contain polyethylene glycol. The disposition of doxorubicin when administered as Myocet reflects that of the liposome and differs substantially from plain doxorubicin. The formulation improves the drug penetration into tumors and decreases drug clearance, thereby increasing the duration of therapeutic drug effects. It may have benefits in the treatment of breast cancer.Doxorubicin-HPMA conjugate is a co-polymer conjugate of doxorubicin and the water soluble polymer N-(2-hydroxypropyl) methacrylamide (HPMA). Conjugation with HPMA improves the therapeutic effects of doxorubicin, by promoting drug accumulation inside tumors, while decreasing systemic toxicity.An extracellularly tumor-activated prodrug (ETAP) incorporates both a tumor specific recognition site and a tumor selective enzymatic activation sequence. It is unable to enter healthy cells but is proteolytically activated by Peptidases that are rather selectively secreted by cancer cells. Doxocycline delivery to tumors can be improved by coupling it to ETAPs. The bicyclic peptide CDCRGDCFC (RGD-4C) selectively binds to Integrins \u03b1V\u03b23 and \u03b1V\u03b25, which are highly over-expressed in invading tumor endothelial cells. A distinct tumor specific sequence is the tripeptide D-Ala-Phe-Lys that is recognized by the tumor associated protease Plasmin, an important factor of tumor invasion and metastasis. An aminocaproyl residue is incorporated as a spacer between the two peptide sequences, whereas a self-eliminating 4-aminobenzyl alcohol spacer is inserted between the Plasmin substrate and doxorubicin. This prodrug is designed to have Plasmin dependent cytotoxicity for endothelial cells and some tumor cells, but it requires improvements in water solubility and bioavailability (de Groot et al. 2002).L-377,202 is an extracellularly tumor-activated prodrug characterized by a covalent linkage of doxorubicin to N-glutaryl-[4-hydroxyprolyl]-Ala-Ser-cyclohexaglycyl-Glu-Ser-Leu. In the presence of prostate cancer cells that secrete the serine protease PSA (Prostate Specific Antigen), the peptide moiety of L-377,202 is hydrolyzed to release doxorubicin or Leu-doxorubicin, the latter being freely diffusible and activated to doxorubicin inside the target cells. L-377,202 is considerably more toxic to PSA expressing tumor cells than to PSA negative normal or tumor cells (Denmeade et al. 1998).The extracellularly tumor-activated prodrug N-succinyl-Ala-L-Leu-L-Ala-L-Leu- doxorubicin (CPI-0004Na) is a tetrapeptidic derivative of doxorubicin. CPI-0004Na does not undergo hydrolysis in the blood nor does it enter cells, but it is activated by tumor Peptidases to give N-(L-Leu- doxorubicin), which eventually diffuses inside the cells. CPI-0004Na is substantially less toxic than doxorubicin due to its lower accumulation in the heart and other untransformed tissues (Trouet et al. 2001).Doxorubicin-magnetic targeted carrier complex consists of doxorubicin bound to microscopic beads of activated carbon and iron (magnetic targeted carriers). With the placement of a magnet on the body surface overlying a tumor site, this carrier complex delivers doxorubicin preferentially to the tumor, thereby prolonging the duration of the therapeutic effects while decreasing its systemic toxicity.\n",

Before the next ensuing chemotherapy administration, patients should return to pre-treatment bowel function without requiring anti-diarrhea medications for at least 24 h. Intestinal biota play essential roles in carbohydrate metabolism, vitamin production, and the processing of bile acids, sterols, and xenobiotics. Thus, the removal of gastrointerstinal bacteria is not recommended for patients already challenged by neoplastic growths and chemotherapy. In addition, elimination of symbiotic gastrointestinal flora increases the chances of infections by pathogenic bacteria, including enterohemorrhagic Escherichia coli and Clostridium difficile. Inhibitors of \u03b2-Glucuronidases prevent this conversion and diminish irinotecan gut toxicity.\n",

The allele TA7 (*28 variant) is expressed at lower levels than other alleles. Gilbert syndrome (Gilbert-Meulengracht syndrome), is the most common hereditary form of increased unconjugated blood bilirubin, based on the autosomal recessive inheritance of the reduced activity allele of UGT1A1. During chemotherapy, homozygous patients effectively receive a larger than expected dose of irinotecan because the drug is not cleared as fast as in non-carriers of this allele. Hence, Gilbert syndrome is associated with a high incidence of severe diarrhea and neutropenia in patients who are treated with irinotecan. Genetic testing can predict this toxicity before chemotherapy administration and can allow dose adjustment.

The drug exerts its anti-neoplastic properties by binding to and inhibiting Topoisomerase 2, which prevents the religation of cleaved DNA molecules, resulting in the accumulation of strand breaks, the inhibition of DNA reduplication, and apoptotic cell death. It acts primarily in the G2 and M phases of the cell cycle. Etoposide is used in combination chemotherapy, mainly to treat refractory testicular cancer following unsuccessful standard treatment and in first-line treatment for small cell lung cancers. It also has use in the treatment of chorionic carcinoma, Kaposi sarcoma, malignant melanoma, and lymphomata. A phosphate salt improves the drug properties because the water solubility of etoposide phosphate lessens the potential for precipitation following dilution and during intravenous administration.

The cytotoxicity of the prodrug etoposide phosphate is lower than of etoposide, which may be due to the necessity for conversion to the active moiety by dephosphorylation.

Cancers can become resistant to antifolates by amplification of dihydrofolate reductase or decreased affinity of Dihydrofolate Reductase for methotrexate. Other potential causes of resistance are slow rates of thymidylate synthesis and lack of polyglutamation within tumor cells.",

            "text": "\n5-Fluorouracil <Adrucil, Fluoroplex, Fluorouracil> has its principal use is in colorectal cancer and pancreatic cancer, in which it is the established form of chemotherapy. For good-risk patients, 5-fluorouracil is usually given intravenously (infusion is superior to bolus injection) at 15 mg/kg for 5 days. After rest for 1 day, 7.5 mg/kg are then given every other day for 4\u20135 doses. A new course of treatment is repeated after an interval of 4 weeks. For poor-risk patients, the dose of 5-fluorouracil is reduced or 4 doses of 15 mg/kg/day are given as a course, whereafter treatment is stopped.Cream preparations of 5-fluorouracil <Efudex, Fluoroplex, Carac> are used for the topical treatment of multiple actinic or solar keratoses. Efudex 5 % strength is administered to treat superficial basal cell carcinomata. The most common adverse effects include reversible pain, itching, burning, soreness, scaling, rash, irritation, dryness, swelling, inflammation, tenderness at the injection site. Less commonly (10\u201330 % of patients), increased sensitivity to sunlight, discoloration of the skin, or scarring can arise.Floxuridine (5-fluoro-2\u2032-deoxyuridine-5\u2032-phosphate, 5-FUDR monophosphate) <FUDR, FUDR-MP> is a fluorinated pyrimidine monophosphate analog of 5-fluorouracil that was synthesized by Duschinsky. The goal was a reduction in the toxicity of 5-fluorouracil that arises when the drug is converted to a ribonucleotide. It competes with 2\u2032-deoxyuridylate for Thymidylate Synthase and thereby blocks thymidylate synthesis. The resulting lack of thymidylate consecutively impairs DNA synthesis. This agent is metabolized to fluorouracil and other derivatives that can be incorporated into RNA and inhibit the utilization of preformed uracil in RNA synthesis. 5-FUDR, but not 5-fluorouracil, is incorporated preferentially into colon carcinoma compared to normal colon (Mukherjee et al. 1963). Floxuridine is usually given rapidly at twice the dose of 5-fluorouracil. It first gained U.S. FDA approval in 1970.Dihydropyrimidine Dehydrogenase represents the initial rate-limiting step in the catabolism of the pyrimidines uracil, thymine, and 5-fluorouracil. Doxifluridine (5\u2032-deoxy-5-fluorouridine) is a fluoropyrimidine derivative and oral prodrug of 5-fluorouracil, designed to circumvent the rapid degradation of 5-fluorouracil by Dihydropyrimidine Dehydrogenase in the gut wall and liver. The agent is converted into 5-fluorouracil by Pyrimidine Nucleoside Phosphorylase.5,10-methylenetetrahydrofolate (MTHF) is a folate based biomodulator that stabilizes the covalent binding of the fluorouracil metabolite 5\u20135-fluoro-2\u2032-deoxyuridine-5\u2032-O-monophosphate (FdUMP) to its target enzyme, Thymidylate Synthase. The binding results in enzyme inhibition and depletion of the essential DNA constituent thymidine triphosphate (TTP). Tumor cell death ensues . 5,10-methylenetetrahydrofolate, as the active form of folate, does not require metabolic activation and may exceed the chemotherapeutic effects of fluorouracil with lower toxicity.Tegafur (5-fluoro-1-(oxolan-2-yl)pyrimidine-2,4-dione, tetrahydrofuranyl-5-fluorouracil) is a prodrug that is gradually converted to fluorouracil by Cytochrome P450 in the liver. Tegafur competes with uridine triphosphate, thus inhibiting RNA and protein synthesis.Tegafur-uracil (UFT) <Ftorafur, Tefudex, Ufur, Uftoral> is a formulated oral agent consisting of a combination of the 5-fluorouracil prodrug, tetrahydrofuranyl-5-fluorouracil, and uracil (1:4). Because of its higher concentration in the combination, uracil saturates the uracil reducing enzymatic activity of Ddihydropyrimidine Ddehydrogenase, thereby inhibiting first pass hepatic metabolism of 5-fluorouracil and permitting its administration as the orally bioavailable prodrug tetrahydrofuranyl-5-fluorouracil. Tegafur-uracil was developed in Japan during the 1980s. The drug has been administered on a continuous daily basis for 6\u201365 months at 300\u2013400 mg per day in divided doses (metronomic dosing), in cycles of 5 days dosed at 300 mg/m2 per day followed by the weekend off, or in cycles of 28 days dosed at 300\u2013600 mg/m2 per day followed by a week off.S-1 was developed in Japan. It is an anti-pyrimidine preparation composed of tegafur combined with two modulators of 5-flurouracil activity, 5-chloro-2,4-dihydroxypyridine (CDHP) and potassium oxonate, in a molar ratio of 1:0.4:1. 5-chloro-2,4-dihydroxypyridine is a reversible inhibitor of Dihydropyrimidine Dehydrogenase, the liver enzyme responsible for rapid catabolism of 5-fluorouracil into inactive metabolites. Potassium oxonate preferentially localizes in the gut and inhibits the enzyme Orotate Phosphoribosyl Transferase, which is the major enzyme responsible for 5-fluorouracil activation. Thus it decreases the activation of 5-fluorouracil in the gut and the associated gastrointestinal toxicity. S-1 is orally more active than 5- fluorouracil.Capecitabine (5\u2032-deoxy-5-fluoro-N-[(pentyloxy)carbonyl]-cytidine) <Xeloda> is a fluoropyrimidine carbamate with nearly 100 % oral bioavailability. As a prodrug, capecitabine is metabolized by the liver to 5\u2032-deoxy-5-fluorocytidine and subsequently to 5\u2032-deoxy-5-fluorouridine (5\u2032-dFUR). 5\u2032-deoxy-5-fluorouridine is converted to 5-fluorouracil by Thymidine Phosphorylase, which is present in amounts 3\u201310-fold higher in neoplastic tissue compared with untransformed tissue. A typical daily oral dose is 1250\u20132000 mg/m2. It is split into morning and evening intake (within 30 min after a meal) for 2 weeks, followed by 1 week of rest to complete a cycle. Capecitabine may be used in mono-therapy or combination chemotherapy. It is indicated for the adjuvant treatment of Dukes C colon cancer41 following the complete resection of the primary tumor, as first-line treatment of metastatic colorectal carcinoma, for metastatic breast cancer after failure of prior anthracycline containing chemotherapy (combination with docetaxel), for metastatic breast cancer resistant to both paclitaxel and anthracycline containing chemotherapy or resistant to paclitaxel and contraindicated for anthracycline therapy. The safety profile of capecitabine is superior to that of 5-fluorouracil, with less diarrhea, stomatitis, nausea, alopecia, and grade 3\u20134 neutropenia, but a higher incidence of hand and foot syndrome and hyperbilirubinemia (typically unconjugated bilirubin). Care needs to be exercised when capecitabine is co-administered with CYP2C9 substrates. Patients receiving concomitant oral coumarin derivatives should have their anticoagulant response closely monitored. The phenytoin dose may need to be reduced when given simultaneously with capecitabine.\n",

The rate of blood clearance generally is 1st order with a half-life of 10\u201320 min and ranges between 500 and 1500 mL/min. 5-fluorouracil enters cells by a carrier mediated transport mechanism and by facilitated diffusion (however, alterations of 5-fluorouracil entry into cells are not responsible for either natural or acquired resistance). In contrast to 5-fluorouracil, the entry of fluorodeoxyuridine (FdUrd) into most neoplastic cells involves the saturable but non-concentrative mechanism for the facilitated diffusion of nucleosides. Fluorouridine and FdUrd, released from 5-fluorouridylic acid and 5-fluorodeoxyuridylate by Phosphatase action, exit the cells via this same facilitated diffusion transporter (Fig. 2.45). Thus, agents that affect this transporter may affect 5-fluorouracil cytotoxicity42.\n",

The anabolic path, in which 5-fluorouracil is incorporated into nucleotides, is the mechanism of carcinostatic action.

Clofarabine is a prodrug that gains entry into cells primarily by nucleoside transporter mechanisms. Nucleoside transporters are specialized proteins located in the cell membrane that mediate the uptake and release of nucleosides and nucleoside analogs. Clofarabine is efficiently taken up via the equilibrative transporters hENT1 and hENT2, and the concentrative transporter hCNT247. The abundance of nucleoside transporters on a tumor or host cell may be a major determinant of the amount of nucleoside or nucleoside analog that is taken up into a particular tissue type. At higher concentrations and longer exposure times, the slightly lipophilic agent clofarabine also enters cells by passive diffusion across lipid membranes.",

Removal of the phosphates by 5\u2032-Nucleotidase is a prerequisite for the cellular export of clofarabine.
