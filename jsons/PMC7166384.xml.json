The screen yielded several different penton base partners, among them BAG3 protein. The common structural feature of identified penton base partners is the WW domain, one of several domains known to promote physical interaction between proteins [Sudol, 1996]. Indeed, BAG3 is the only member of the BAG family that contains a WW domain, which is located in the N\u2010terminal part of the protein (Fig. 1B). WW domains of 25\u201340 amino acids contain a high proportion of hydrophobic aromatic and basic residues, two highly conserved tryptophanes at both ends and one invariable proline. These domains bind to short poly\u2010proline motifs that differ from other poly\u2010prolines such as ligands of the SH3 domains. Several classes of such poly\u2010proline ligands of WW domains are known [for review, see Macias et al., 2002] and one of them, PPxY (proline\u2010proline\u2010amino acid\u2013tyrosine) appears twice in the N\u2010terminus of all sequenced penton bases.",

            "text": "The membrane overlay technique was initially used to confirm the interaction uncovered by the library screen. The lysate of BAG3\u2010transfected HeLa cells contained two major bands revealed with anti\u2010tag antibody (Fig. 1C, left panel). The larger protein recognised by antibody against BAG3 tag migrated with an apparent molecular weight of \u223c80 kDa rather than 64 kDa expected for BAG3; anomalous BAG3 mobility have already been noted by Lee et al. 1999. The C\u2010terminal BAG3 deletion mutant (BAG3\u0394C, apparent MW of 50 kDa), synthesised in larger amount than full\u2010length protein, ran at the level of 60 kDa. Both BAG3 proteins were able to attach subviral Ad3 dodecahedral penton bases particles recognised by anti\u2010Dd antibody (Fig. 1C, right panel). The band observed above the 36 kDa MW marker in Figure 1C, is probably a proteolysis product containing the BAG3 N\u2010terminal WW domain since it is able to interact with base protein (Fig. 1C, right panel). The bands visible above BAG3 are recognised by anti\u2010Dd antibody in the non\u2010transfected cells (Fig. 1C, lane c) and they might represent other cellular proteins interacting with the penton base. The thin band running at the level of complete BAG3 in lanes DC and of control possibly represents the endogenous BAG3 protein. The control blot treated with anti\u2010Dd antibody alone did not show any bands (not shown). BAG3\u2010 or penton base\u2010transfected cells were then immunoprecipitated with anti\u2010c\u2010myc tag antibody recognising overexpressed BAG3. The first membrane, developed with anti\u2010BAG3\u2010HRP antibody, showed correct immunoprecipitation of BAG3 (Fig. 1D, lanes BAG and BAG + Base). Revelation of the second membrane with anti\u2010base antibody demonstrated that the Ad2 base protein was immunoprecipitated together with BAG3 protein (Fig. 1D, lane BAG + Base). In the absence of BAG3, penton base protein alone was not immunoprecipitated. Finally, to determine if this interaction exists under more physiological conditions, lysates obtained from cells infected with Ad2 for 40 h were immunoprecipitated with the antibody recognising endogenous BAG3. The antibody brought down penton base protein (Fig. 1E), which shows that penton base expressed during Ad2 infection is indeed in the complex with the endogenous BAG3. This last experiment confirms the BAG3\u2013penton base interaction during infectious viral cycle.",

To explore whether a similar mechanism applies to the interaction with BAG3, the experiment was performed using two mutants of the Ad2 base protein, namely \u0394PY1 and PY2mut. The former had the first PPxY motif deleted while the latter retained both motifs but had a second proline of the second PPXY changed to alanine (see diagram Fig. 2A). The rationale for this last mutation is based on studies identifying this residue in the PPxY motif as indispensable for interaction with WW domains [Chen et al., 1997; Pirozzi et al., 1997]. In cells co\u2010transfected with penton base or the base mutant genes and with the BAG3 expression plasmid, the BAG3 immunoprecipitated the native form of the penton base protein and the PY2mut, but not the base devoid of the first PPXY motif (Fig. 2B, compare lanes BAG + Base and BAG + PY2mut with the lane BAG + \u0394PY1). Of note, the synthesis of N\u2010terminally deleted base protein is always somewhat impaired (results not shown). This result suggests that also for BAG3 the first PPxY motif in the penton base is involved in the interaction.",

It was thus of interest to determine if the ternary complex can be formed by BAG3 bearing both partners simultaneously. For this, HeLa cells were transfected with both c\u2010myc\u2010tagged BAG3 and Ad2 penton base\u2010coding plasmids. Cell lysates were immunoprecipitated with anti\u2010c\u2010myc, anti\u2010Hsp70 or anti\u2010base antibodies. Interestingly, both anti\u2010c\u2010myc and anti\u2010Hsp70 antibodies brought down both tagged and endogenous BAG3 (arrowheads in Fig. 3A). Both base protein and endogenous Hsp70 were pulled down together with BAG3.

The mechanism of the penton base transfer to the nucleus is not clear since its sequence does not display an obvious NLS. However, the nuclear transfer of the penton base was confirmed in our hands upon the expression of the base protein alone in HeLa cells, under conditions of both transfection and virus infection (Fig. 5A). When BAG3 was expressed in the presence of the penton base, a significant portion of GFP\u2010BAG3 was observed in the nucleus (Fig. 5B, see panels Merge). Since this protein is predominantly displayed in the cytoplasm in the absence of Ad infection (see Fig. 4B), these observations suggest that the penton base protein, when expressed together with BAG3, is able to transfer the attached BAG3 to the nucleus during its own nuclear transport. Similar behaviour of BAG3 and base proteins was observed upon virus infection, with a remarkably high concentration of BAG3 in the nucleus of Ad2\u2010infected cells (Fig. 5C). Fig. 5D shows the simultaneous expression of BAG3 and penton base protein in the infected cells. Taken together these experiments show that by virtue of an interaction with a viral partner capable of efficient nuclear translocation, BAG3 co\u2010chaperone is transported into the nuclei of penton base\u2010expressing cells, thus acquiring a new localisation upon Ad infection.",

HeLa cells depleted of BAG3 using siRNA technique (Fig. 6A, left panel) were infected with the adenovirus carrying the luciferase gene, Adluc. This recombinant virus is unable to replicate in HeLa cells but translocates the virus genome to the cell nucleus and allows luciferase expression, which permits the quantification of virus entry. Depletion of BAG3 appears to be deleterious to virus entry (Fig. 6A, right panel). Next, BAG3\u2010deleted cells were infected with Ad5 and analysed for the amount of progeny virus produced, taking the penton base production as a measure. During Ad replication penton base is one of three structural viral proteins produced in large amounts (the other two being the hexon and the fibre). BAG3\u2010deleted cells showed reduced virus replication, which was demonstrated by the significantly lower amount of penton base protein synthesised, as observed within the first 24 h of infection (Fig. 6B). This effect is much less pronounced at 48 h, which might result from the high multiplicity of infection used in this experiment. Together, these experiments suggest that interaction of the penton base with BAG3 is implicated in the first stages of Ad infection\u2014virus entry and nuclear translocation.",

To better understand the effect of the base protein on BAG3 co\u2010chaperone activity, proteins derived from two different adenovirus serotypes were used\u2014Ad2 penton base and Ad3 dodecahedron, a virus\u2010like particle consisting of 12 bases [Fender et al., 1997].

It seems therefore, that in the presence of penton base and also, conceivably, upon Ad infection, the co\u2010chaperone activity of BAG3 is detoured from the Hsp70 system toward viral life cycle.

This protein is also implicated in the escape of the virus from endosomes [FitzGerald et al., 1983]. In addition, since viral proteins are synthesised in the cytoplasm they have to travel to the nucleus where the assembly of Ad progeny virions takes place. It can thus be inferred that during its life cycle the penton base is involved in the host cell in a plethora of interactions that permit virus cell entry and release from endosomes, as well as viral protein synthesis, folding, oligomerisation, nuclear transport and finally virion assembly. We thought that localisation studies could be of help in elucidation of BAG3 involvement in virus life cycle. The well\u2010studied member of a BAG co\u2010chaperone family, BAG1, localises to both, the cytosol and nucleus [Nollen et al., 2000; Frebel et al., 2007].

As BAG3 is unable to form a ternary complex containing both penton base and Hsp70 (Fig. 3A), it appears that the interaction with Ad penton base is sufficient to result in the nuclear transfer of BAG3.

            "text": "BAG3 has been reported to interact with enveloped viruses. Rosati et al. 2007 showed that BAG3 modestly suppresses transcription from the long terminal repeat (LTR) of HIV\u20101, through inhibition of interaction of p65 subunit of NF\u2010\u03baB with the LTR. The C\u2010terminal fragment of 167 amino acid residues of BAG3 was mapped here as potential p65\u2010binding domain. The observed suppression level was two\u2010 to fourfold only. In contrast, Varicella\u2010Zoster virus (VZV) replication is strongly facilitated by the BAG3 [Kyratsous and Silverstein, 2008]; ORF29p, a latency\u2010associated VZV protein, interacts with BAG3 and BAG3 depletion with siRNA inhibits virus replication. BAG3 devoid of WW domain was still able to bind viral protein. Similarly to our observations made for the adenovirus, BAG3 was located in cytoplasm of non\u2010infected cells and was re\u2010distributed to the nucleus upon VZV infection. In case of VZV, reduction of BAG3 level resulted in marked decrease in virus titre. In contrast, the spread of another herpesvirus, HSV, was completely unaffected by BAG3 depletion (op. cit.), even that recent data indicate on the positive effect of BAG3 on HSV replication at low multiplicity of infection [Kyratsous and Silverstein, 2008]. Interestingly, still another herpesvirus, EBV, via its EBNA3A oncoprotein, was able to induce mRNA of several chaperones, among them that of BAG3 [Young et al., 2008]. Further, BAG3 suppression with RNAi resulted in inhibition of a respiratory virus SARS\u2010CoV replication [Zhang et al., 2010]. Thus BAG3 appears to be involved in several facets of host\u2013virus interactions.",
