Based on genetic and antigenic analyses, coronaviruses are divided into three major groups. Groups I and II contain mainly mammalian viruses, while group III contains avian viruses, including avian infectious bronchitis virus (Gonz\u00e1lez et al., 2003 \u25b6). In all coronaviruses the replicase gene covers two thirds of the genome. It consists of two large open reading frames (ORFs): ORF1a and ORF1b (Brierley et al., 1989 \u25b6). The two ORFs are connected by a \u22121 ribosomal frameshift and encode two replicase polyproteins which are processed into 15 or 16 matured nonstructural proteins to achieve viral genomic replication, assembly and maturation (Graham et al., 2008 \u25b6; Ma et al., 2010 \u25b6).",

            "text": "As one of the first replicase proteins to be translated and processed, the precise mechanism of action of nsp2 is an attractive target for virological studies. Site-directed mutations in either the nsp1/nsp2 or nsp2/nsp3 cleavage sites allowed virus replication, as did mutations in the papain-like proteinase (PLP) domain of nsp3. Moreover, deletion of nsp2 in MHV and SARS-CoV resulted in viable mutant viruses, albeit with a slight attenuation of viral growth and RNA synthesis (Denison et al., 2004 \u25b6; Graham et al., 2005 \u25b6; Graham & Denison, 2006 \u25b6). Although it has been reported that nsp2 is not necessary for corona\u00advirus replication and transcription, its low similarity in sequence and structure implies that it might function in host interplay. When tested by yeast two-hybrid matrix analysis, a large number of interactions between SARS-CoV nsp2 and other viral proteins were discovered in SARS-CoV (Pan et al., 2008 \u25b6; von Brunn et al., 2007 \u25b6). Furthermore, expression of MHV nsp2 from alternative locations could not complement the modest growth defects caused by nsp2 deletion, indicating that the timing and/or interactions resulting from expression between nsp1 and nsp3 might be crucial for the function of nsp2 and for optimal replication (Gadlage et al., 2008 \u25b6). In the work of Marne and coworkers, MHV nsp2 appeared to be more efficiently recruited to the replication\u2013transcription complex (RTC) than other nsps and to be contained in rigid protein\u2013protein interaction networks in the RTC (Hagemeijer et al., 2010 \u25b6). In addition, prohibitin 1 (PHB1) and PHB2, two proteins involved in mitochondrial bio\u00adgenesis and intracellular signalling, have been identified to interact with SARS nsp2 in vitro (Cornillez-Ty et al., 2009 \u25b6). To gain a better understanding of the structural details and functional mechanism of coronavirus nsp2, we have determined the crystal structures of the N-\u00adterminal domain of IBV nsp2 (Yang et al., 2009 \u25b6) and SARS-CoV nsp2 (unpublished work). Here, we report the successful cloning, overexpression, purification and crystallization of IBV nsp2 and the preliminary characterization of selenomethionyl-derivative IBV nsp2 crystals by X-ray analysis.",

The forward PCR primer for IBV nsp2 was 5\u2032-CG GGA TCC ATG GCT TCA AGC CTA AAA CAG GGA GTA TCT CCC AAA CTA AG-3\u2032, containing a BamHI restriction site (bold), and the reverse PCR primer 5\u2032-CCG CTC GAG TTA GTG GTG GTG GTG GTG GTG GCC TGC TTT GCA AAC CAC-3\u2032 was designed with a XhoI restriction site (bold). The PCR conditions were 30 cycles of 30 s at 367 K, 30 s at 328 K and 2 min at 345 K. Digested PCR products were inserted into a BamHI/XhoI-digested pGEX-6p-1 vector (Amersham Biosciences). After transformation into Escherichia coli Top10, positive clones were confirmed by DNA sequencing. The final protein product contained five additional residues (GPLGS) at the N-terminus and a 6\u00d7His tag at the C-terminus, with a theoretical molecular mass of 76 180 Da.",
