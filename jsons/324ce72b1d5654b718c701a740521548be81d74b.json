The phase of early detection and containment of focal cases, previously related to travelers to areas at risk, becomes associated, with the beginning of community transmission in Brazil, with strategies to prevent deaths and the development of more serious cases in risk groups: the so-called mitigation phase. In this phase, the identification of the source case becomes more unlikely, and the tracking of contacts becomes more difficult.",

Perhaps one of the most important lessons, the early social distancing has the greatest potential to delay the maximum expected case advance.",

Likewise, the Brazilian Ministry of Health considers this strategy of elective surgery postponement in different centers.
