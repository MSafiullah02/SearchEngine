The S protein of PEDV is a type 1 transmembrane envelope protein and consists of the S1 and S2 domains. The S protein is responsible for the viral entry via specific binding of the S1 domain with the cellular receptor, fusion and interaction of the S2 domain with host cellular membrane, and for induction of neutralizing antibodies in the host (Bosch et al. 2003) . The M and E proteins are associated with virus assembly via interacting with S and N proteins (Klumperman et al. 1994) . The primary role of N protein is to pack the viral genomic RNA into viral particles (Spaan et al. 1983 ).",

            "text": "Since late 2010, however, new PEDV variants with evidence of increased virulence have been isolated in several countries. The novel PEDV variants attack neonatal piglets regardless of their vaccination status or maternal immunity, which derived from CV777-based vaccination or preexisting historic PEDV infection (Sun et al. 2012; Chiou 2015; Stevenson et al. 2013) . Factors underlying the potential pathogenesis of the PEDV outbreaks and the high mortality in piglets include the mutation of the virus (Chiou et al. 2015; Pasick et al. 2014) , the lacking of maternal antibodies for protection of the piglets, and the slower turnover rate of enterocytes (5-7 days) of the neonatal piglets as compared to postweaning pigs (2-3 days) (Jung and Saif 2015a; Straw et al. 2006 ).",

These variants caused severe watery diarrhea in pigs of all ages and high death rate in neonatal and suckling piglets. Based on the phylogenetic analysis of full-length sequences of the S gene of PEDVs isolated in China, both G1 and G2 strains are concurrently isolated. While China G2 PEDV strains share 96-99 % homologies to the CV777-based vaccine strain, the China G1 PEDV strains only share 93-95 % similarity to the CV777based vaccine strain as well as China historic PEDV strains. These China G1 PEDV strains present several nucleotides insertions and deletions in the S gene (Li et al. 2012) . Comparing the G1 PEDV strains with the CV777-based vaccine strain, there are two to three amino acid mutations in the neutralizing epitope SS6 and one to eight amino acid differences in the CO-26 K equivalent epitope (COE) domain (499-638 aa) in the S protein.

No PEDV vaccines were available in the USA as well. After the first outbreak, PEDV quickly spread throughout the USA, then to nearby countries, including Canada (Song et al. 2015; Pasick et al. 2014 ). The US PEDV strains distributed both in G1 and G2 groups. The strains causing severe outbreaks exhibit high similarity to G1 PEDVs and are designed as S non-INDEL strains. The S non-INDEL PEDV strains were most closely related to China PEDV strains of CH/ZMZDY/11 and AH2012 in G1 group. Later after the outbreak, variants of US PEDV strains are isolated and are clustered in G2 in the phylogenetic analysis. As compared with the original US G1 PEDV strains, the US G2 PEDV strains contain insertions and deletions in S protein and are designed as S INDEL strains. Based on the full-length S gene analysis of PEDVs, the US S non-INDEL strains in G1 shared 99.8-100 % homology to each other and shared 96.6-97.1 % homologies to other PEDV G2 strains from North America. The S INDEL and original S non-INDEL strains are suggestive co-circulating and could have been introduced simultaneously in North America (Anastasia et al. 2014 ).",

However, there were no well-documented reports for PEDV in Europe during the past decades; most of the countries have not implemented active monitoring for this particular disease (23). Recently, several European PEDVs variants, such as PEDV/GER/L00719/214 and PEDV/GER/ L00721/2014 from Germany, FR/001/2014 from France, BEL/15 V010/2015 from Belgium, and some isolates from Portugal and Italy, have been isolated and studied. They shared high identity (99 %) with the USA/OH851 strain (S INDEL; G2) and the Chinese AH2012 strain, but less similar (97.1 %) to the historic isolate, CV777, which isolated from Europe (Grasland et al. 2015; Theuns et al. 2015; Dennis Hanke et al. 2015) .",

It had been demonstrated that current available vaccines, CV777 and the attenuated PEDV DR13 vaccines, might not be able to fully protect piglets against the infection or control disease progression due to the high genetic diversity of new variants of global PEDVs. A new generation of PEDV vaccine is therefore urgently in need.",

As compared with mock-infected Vero cells (a, c), typical CPEs in PEDV-infected Vero cells are characterized by cell fusion and syncytial formation under the light microscopy (b) and distinct cytoplasmic signals under the immunocytochemistry staining (d) outbreaks, the global PEDVs have been divided into two major groups according to the phylogenetic analysis of S gene of PEDV. Group 1 (G1) comprises global new variants of PEDVs and US S non-INDEL strains in North America; group 2 (G2) is composed of CV777 and DR13 vaccine strains, historical PEDVs isolated in Asia and Europe before the recent outbreaks, and the emerging US S INDEL PEDVs. The G1 strains isolated from the USA, China, and Asia PED-affected piglets show high sequence identities to each other(Chiou et al. 2015;Chen et al. 2014;Pasick et al. 2014;Temeeyasen et al. 2014;Vui et al. 2014). These novel G1 PEDV strains are suggested to share a common ancestor. The G2 PEDV strains are suggested being less virulent and are reported circulating in Europe, the USA, and AsiaDennis Hanke et al. 2015).",
