The virus was identified in an endotracheal aspirate specimen, and the microarray results were confirmed by specific polymerase chain reaction and serological analysis for HPIV-4. Conventional clinical laboratory testing using an extensive panel of microbiological tests failed to yield a diagnosis. This case suggests that the potential severity of disease caused by HPIV-4 in adults may be greater than previously appreciated and illustrates the clinical utility of a microarray for broad-based viral pathogen screening.",

In the Unexplained Deaths and Critical Illnesses Project study from 1995-1998, a putative infectious agent was identified only 39% of the time, despite extensive laboratory testing [1] . Thus, there is a need for new approaches to the identification of pathogens in this setting. Here, we describe a case of human parainfluenzavirus type 4 (HPIV-4) infection in an immunocompetent adult who presented with rapidly progressive respiratory failure. Extensive conventional microbiological testing for infectious agents was unrevealing. The causative pathogen was finally identified in a sample of endotracheal aspirate using the Virochip (University of California, San Francisco), a pan-viral DNA microarray that is designed to detect both known and novel viruses on the basis of sequence homology [2, 3] . To our knowledge, this is the first report of respiratory failure from HPIV-4 in a healthy, immunocompetent adult.",

Microarray evidence of HPIV-4 was confirmed by PCR of amplified cDNA from the patient's endotracheal aspirate followed by sequencing. Previously published primers [5] [6] [7] [8] were used to amplify segments of the HPIV-4 genome corresponding to the nucleoprotein, phosphoprotein, and matrix genes. New primer sets were also designed to amplify conserved regions within the genes coding for the fusion protein (RUBULA-F1: 5 -TTGCWGGDGTDGYKRTWGG-3 ; RUB-ULA-R1: 5 -TTTGCWGGDGTDGYKRTWGG-3 ) and large protein (PI2-F1: 5 -GAGTAATGAGCATGGTTCAAGGAG-3 ; PI2-R1: 5 -CAGGAAGCTTGAGTACATTCACCTA-3 ). The RUBULA-F1 and RUBULA-R1 degenerate primers were derived from ClustalW sequence alignment of the fusion genes from parainfluenza 4a, parainfluenza 4b, and mumps viruses, whereas the PI2-F1 and PI2-R1 primers were derived from the sequence of the HPIV-2 large protein gene. Each reaction contained 5.0 mL of 10\u03eb PCR buffer (Invitrogen Corporation), 2.0 mL of 50 mmol/L MgCl 2 , 1.0 mL of 10 mmol/L deoxyribonucleoside triphosphates, 1.0 mL of forward primer and 1.0 mL of reverse primer (10 pmol/mL each), 1 mL of Platinum Taq DNA polymerase (Invitrogen Corporation; 5 U/mL), and 5.0 mL of template cDNA. Cycling parameters were as follows: 5 min of initial denaturation at 94\u040aC followed by 40 cycles of denaturation (30 s at 94\u040aC), annealing (45 s at 50\u040aC), and elongation (60 s at 72\u040aC), with a final extension at 72\u040aC for 8 min. Appropriate positive and negative controls were included with each reaction, and amplified PCR bands of the expected size were sequenced on an ABI PRISM 3700 DNA Analyzer (Applied Biosystems).

Traditional methods of microarray analysis include visual inspection and hierarchical clustering [13, 14] . Visual inspection involves examination of the viral identities of the oligonucleotides with the highest intensities, whereas hierarchical clustering uses a set of microarrays to group oligonucleotides with similar intensity profiles to identify patterns that may correspond to a particular virus. Neither visual inspection nor hierarchical clustering detected a convincing viral signature on the microarray. Thus, we used a new data analysis method, the z-score metric, which has been implemented in our laboratory for identifying weak viral signatures. The z-score metric estimates the statistical significance of individual oligonucleotides on the microarray. Manual inspection of the top 100 viral oligonucleotides ranked by z-score revealed a possible paramyxovirus signature, because 6 paramyxoviridae oligonucleotides were among the top 100 with zscores ranging from 2.21-3.71 ( figure 2B, 1-6) . Four of the oligonucleotides were derived from human parainfluenzavirus 4a, 1 from human parainfluenzavirus 4b, and 1 from simian parainfluenzavirus 5, a close relative of HPIV-4. The 6 oligonucleotides mapped to 4 different regions in the HPIV-4 genome, corresponding to the nucleocapsid protein, phosphoprotein, fusion protein, and large protein ( figure 2A and 2B) .",

Thus, it is not surprising that we were still able to detect HPIV-4 from a specimen collected on day 4 after hospital admission (which corresponds to \u223c14 days after symptom onset). Nosocomial infection with HPIV-4 is a remote possibility, although a study of patients who received a diagnosis of acute viral pneumonia in the intensive care unit revealed that nearly all of these illnesses (11 [92%] of 12) were community acquired [16] . Moreover, the patient's HPIV-4-specific IgG antibody titer was already elevated at 1:128 by day 3 after hospital admission, making a nosocomial infection with HPIV-4 extremely unlikely. Despite extensive microbiological testing, no other pathogen was identified in the patient's case.

Diagnosis of HPIV-4 infection is problematic because HPIV-4 is difficult to isolate in viral cultures, and standard commercial direct fluorescent antibody panels available in most clinical virology laboratories include only HPIV-1, -2, and -3 [18] . In rare instances, HPIV-4 has been shown to cause severe respiratory disease in children [17] [18] [19] and immunocompromised individuals [20] , but hitherto, it has not been associated with acute respiratory failure in healthy, young adults.

The major viral proteins include the nucleocapsid protein (NP), phosphoprotein (P), nonstructural V protein (V), matrix protein (M), fusion protein (F), hemagglutinin-neuraminidase protein (HN), and large protein (L). The locations of the 6 paramyxovirus oligonucleotides used to detect HPIV-4 on the microarray are mapped onto the \u223c15 kB genome (B). The corresponding z-score for each oligonucleotide is indicated in parentheses. Five regions of the HPIV-4 virus obtained from a sample of the patient's endotracheal aspirate were sequenced (a-e, black areas), 4 of which are within previously sequenced regions of the genome (gray areas; C). Below each sequenced region is its percentage of nucleotide identity to the corresponding HPIV-4a sequence in the GenBank database.",
