A specific spike protein enables this virus to bind to human cells, and a thorough understanding of its 3dimensional structure is therefore critical for developing effective therapeutic interventions. However, its structure may continue to evolve over time as a result of mutations. In this paper, we use a data science perspective to study the potential structural impacts due to ongoing mutations in its amino acid sequence. To do so, we identify a key segment of the protein and apply a sequential Monte Carlo sampling method to detect possible changes to the space of low-energy conformations for different amino acid sequences. Such computational approaches can further our understanding of this protein structure and complement laboratory efforts. arXiv:2005.07550v1 [q-bio.BM] 1 May 2020",

Much research has been devoted to understand the mechanism by which the virus attacks human cells (e.g., Hoffmann et al., 2020; Zhang et al., 2020) . Such a scientific understanding is critical to the ongoing development of therapeutic interventions and vaccines for COVID-19, see, e.g., Amanat and Krammer (2020) for a review of efforts to date. Proteins play key roles in facilitating the entry of viruses into cells, and specifically for SARS-CoV-2, the spike (S) glycoprotein that protrudes from its viral membrane (Walls et al., 2020) . Genome sequencing of SARS-CoV-2 has shown that this new coronavirus has moderate genetic similarity to the SARS-associated coronavirus (formally SARS-CoV) that caused the 2002-2003 outbreak, having between 75-80% of their genetic material in common (Lu et al., 2020) . In particular, both SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 utilize a spike protein to bind to the ACE2 (Angiotensin Converting Enzyme 2) receptor in human cells (Ou et al., 2020) . Laboratory work has now shown that the 3-dimensional (3-D) structures of these two spike proteins are broadly similar; however, they are sufficiently different such that antibodies for SARS-CoV are not effective against SARS-CoV-2 (Wrapp et al., 2020) .",

A broad consequence of this discovery, that has been verified in the subsequent decades of laboratory experimental work, is that similarities in amino acid sequences often correspond to similarities in 3-D structure (Krissinel, 2007) . However, laboratory techniques for determining protein structure are laborious and cannot be applied to all possible amino acid sequences of interest, e.g., in drug design applications (Khoury et al., 2014) . Further, the atomic coordinates of amino acids sometimes cannot be ascertained, and will thus be missing data in the published 3-D structures (Brandt et al., 2008) . Thus, to complement laboratory work, there has been much interest in developing computational methods to tackle the protein folding problem, that is, to predict the 3-D structure of a protein based on its amino acid sequence (Friesner et al., 2002) . While much progress has been made in the past five decades towards improving the accuracy of such computation-based structure predictions (Dill and MacCallum, 2012) , the protein folding problem is still considered unsolved in general. The most successful competitor to date, as assessed by the most recent biannual blinded protein folding competition in 2018 known as CASP13 (Critical Assessment of Structure Prediction) 1 , was the deep learning method AlphaFold developed by Google's DeepMind team (AlQuraishi, 2019).",

            "text": "We briefly summarize the timeline of key milestones in the scientific understanding of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein, to provide context for the contribution of this paper. Using modern RNA sequencing technology, scientists were quickly able to determine the original first known SARS-CoV-2 genome , including the amino acid sequence of its S protein, by early January 2020. On the basis of this sequence and its similarities with related proteins, including previously-determined 3-D structures of SARS-CoV and MERS, preliminary 3-D structure predictions of the SARS-CoV-2 S protein could be generated using computational methods 2 . Subsequently, thanks to worldwide attention and rapid research efforts, a UT Austin laboratory was the first to release a 3-D structure of the SARS-CoV-2 S protein in mid-February 2020, using cyro-EM techniques (Wrapp et al., 2020) . A limitation was that several segments of the protein were not successfully determined, and thus missing from the published structure. Nonetheless, this ground-breaking work verified that it is a key segment of the S protein, known as the receptor-binding domain (RBD), that has the ability to bind with human ACE2 when the RBD is in its \"open\" state. Further, Wrapp et al. (2020) showed that in comparison with the corresponding RBD of the SARS-CoV S protein, the two have noticeable similarity in their overall structures, but they have significant deviations in some local segments. In particular, their binding sites are sufficiently different such that SARS-CoV antibodies cannot recognize SARS-CoV-2. By early March 2020, the 3-D structure of the RBD of the SARS-CoV-2 S protein, in a structural complex bound together with ACE2, was also published via laboratory efforts (Yan et al., 2020) .",

It is also well-known, however, that viral genomes mutate over time with varying rates (Drake, 1993) . Mutations underlie, for example, why the prevalent strain of influenza may be difficult to predict when designing the annual flu vaccine (Cohen, 2017) . Mutations are changes in the viral genome that occur as the virus replicates; possible results of mutations include changes in the amino acid sequence of its proteins -via additions, deletions, or substitutions of individual amino acids (Sanju\u00e1n et al., 2010) . Thus, scientists continue to pay close attention to variations in sequenced SARS-CoV-2 genomes over time (Tang et al., 2020) . At the time of this writing, among sequenced SARS-CoV-2 genomes there have already been two amino acid substitutions observed in a key segment of its S protein RBD, as we shall subsequently detail. Therefore, there is concern about the impact of such mutations on the protein structure, and in turn on the binding ability and infectiousness of SARS-CoV-2 as it continues to evolve worldwide (Jia et al., 2020) . It is infeasible to use laboratory-based structure determination to study all potential sequence mutations, thus we may instead use computational methods to assess the potential structural impacts and complement laboratory efforts.",

This sequence may be compared to that the SARS-CoV S protein, which is overall slightly shorter at 1255 amino acids long, with its corresponding RBD located from amino acids 316 to 508. The two RBDs share 144 (74%) of their amino acids in common, and the SARS-CoV-2 RBD has one extra amino acid (Valine) inserted at position 483. It is also worth noting that there are existing known protein sequences with higher degree of similarity to SARS-CoV-2 than SARS-CoV: the S protein of the bat coronavirus known as RaTG13 has an amino acid sequence that matches 97% of the SARS-CoV-2 S protein. Thus RaTG13 S may be even more structurally similar to SARS-CoV-2 S; however, there is no 3-D laboratory-determined structure currently available for RaTG13 S in the PDB. To visualize, Figure 1 lays out the RBDs of these three sequences in an optimally aligned fashion that shows their matching, or conserved, amino acids using the blue shaded colors. There are 20 amino acid types, with each being represented by its one-letter abbreviation. The dash symbol (-) indicates the position where SARS-CoV has one fewer amino acid compared to SARS-CoV-2 and RaTG13.

Specifically, it is standard practice to use backbone atoms for RMSD calculations, which are the N, C, C \u03b1 , and O atoms that are common to all 20 amino acid types and link adjacent amino acids together. The side chains are functional groups extending from the C \u03b1 atom and are unique for each of the 20 amino acid types. That is, we may equivalently say that an amino acid substitution implies that a change in the side chain has occurred at that position. Based on the SARS-CoV-2 S protein sequence and previously known structures in the PDB, researchers at University of Washington used their Robetta structure prediction suite (Kim et al., 2004) to build a preliminary 3-D structure prediction for the entire SARS-CoV-2 S protein 3 . Subsequently, 3-D structures were laboratory-determined and also became publicly available in the PDB: the accession codes are 6VSB for the full standalone SARS-CoV-2 S protein (Wrapp et al., 2020) , and 6LZG for the structural complex of the RBD bound together with the ACE2 receptor (Yan et al., 2020) .

In contrast, the 6LZG PDB structure (chain B is the SARS-CoV-2 RBD) has a continuous and complete set of RBD atomic coordinates. The Robetta RBD structure prediction has an RMSD of 0.933 to the available atomic coordinates of 6VSB, and an RMSD of 2.411 to 6LZG. However, if the segment 444 to 491 in 6LZG is ignored in the calculation, the RMSD drops to 1.208. Thus, the Robetta prediction is quite accurate for most of the RBD structure; however, it has difficulty with the segment that includes the positions 469 to 487 noted in Figure  2 . This result highlights a limitation of current computational approaches: it is still challenging to build accurate predictions for segments that have little sequence similarity with existing proteins in the PDB. Therefore, further advances in computational methods for structure prediction continue to be needed.",

Positions where the two protein sequences are conserved are indicated by the circles, while the square markers indicate positions where the amino acid types differ. From the plot, it can be seen that there are two distinct segments with high RMSD values between the two RBDs: the first is the five amino acids before the gap of missing coordinates in the SARS-CoV structure, and the second is the segment 469 to 487 as indicated by the dashed lines, where we previously noted a low level of sequence similarity. It can also be observed that while there are many sequence differences in the segment 437 to 461 as well, these have less of an effect on structural difference. In Yan et al. (2020) , the authors also note that while there is overall similarity between the two RBDs, there are non-trivial differences in the positions where the RBDs forms chemical bonds with ACE2. In particular, positions 474 and 486 of the SARS-CoV-2 RBD were identified as binding sites, where there is substantial structural dissimilarity with the SARS-CoV RBD. Since this structural comparison reveals that 469 to 487 is likely a critical segment affected by amino acid substitutions, we will focus in this paper on the potential impact of mutations to this segment. Indeed, this is also a segment where the SARS-CoV-2 sequence is noticeably distinct from its closest known related sequence RaTG13, with 4 of the 22 substitutions in the RBD occurring this segment; resulting structural differences here may partially explain its inability to infect humans. Using BLAST (Altschul et al., 1997) on the nr sequence database on April 23, 2020, we find that there are already two amino acid substitutions observed within the segment 469 to 487 among existing SARS-CoV-2 genomes. These are shown in Table  1 , along with the RaTG13 and SARS-CoV sequences for this segment. Further, the BLAST results show that there are otherwise no prior sequences in the entire database, besides these four, that share more than 10 amino acids in common with this segment of SARS-CoV-2. Thus, we may emphasize that the 3-D structure of this segment would be challenging to predict using computational methods that leverage the availability similar sequences in the PDB, as evidenced by Robetta (Section 2.2). For these challenging segments, sampling-based methods can be used to more effectively explore the space of plausible 3-D structures. Thus in what follows, we assess and quantify the structural uncertainties associated with mutations of this segment, assuming the rest of the SARS-CoV-2 S protein is held fixed. To do so, we will use an energy function to guide the sampling, for each of the five sequences identified in Table 1 . A powerful method for this purpose is via sequential Monte Carlo, which we motivate and review next.",

The goal then is to draw samples (conformations) from the high-density regions of \u03c0(x), or equivalently from the low-energy regions.

Further, the energy landscape is highly multimodal and rough due to the numerous pair-wise atomic interactions within the protein.

We provide a brief overview of the SMC methodology presented in Wong et al. (2018) that is adopted here, and the interested reader may refer to that paper for details. The key idea is to sequentially sample the angles of x one amino acid at a time, and this provides a natural incremental distribution for SMC where each particle is a partially constructed conformation. At the i-th SMC step, we sample from the conditional distribution of amino acid i in the sequence, given the previously sampled amino acids, 1, 2, . . . , i \u2212 1. That is, we sample (\u03c6 i , \u03c8 i , \u03c9 i , \u03c7 i ), conditional on (\u03c6 1:i\u22121 , \u03c8 1:i\u22121 , \u03c9 1:i\u22121 , \u03c7 1:i\u22121 ) when i > 1, according to an incremental energy function \u2206H(\u03c6 i , \u03c8 i , \u03c9 i , \u03c7 i |\u03c6 1:i\u22121 , \u03c8 1:i\u22121 , \u03c9 1:i\u22121 , \u03c7 1:i\u22121 ). The incremental energy helps to (a) rule out the possibility of atomic clashes, and (b) ensure that the segment connects properly with the two fixed ends of the rest of the protein. The pool of partial conformations is expanded and then filtered at each step to ensure that a diverse set of low-energy particles is maintained. A secondary filtering step is embedded to handle the sampling of the amino acid side chains. The final output of the SMC sampler is a set of sampled conformations for the input sequence, that can be considered to represent the low-energy space of (1). Thus analysis of these SMC samples can yield insight into the differences between the conformational spaces corresponding to the different input sequences.",

Nonetheless, this is common practice in the bioinformatics literature on loop modeling (e.g., Soto et al., 2008; Tang et al., 2014; Wong et al., 2017; Marks et al., 2017) , and likewise we expect this approach to yield useful information here.

This relates to Figure 2 : the segment 469 to 487 had large structural differences between the PDB structures of SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2, likely due to the large number of amino acid differences in that segment as well as other parts of the sequence. Our analysis shows that if only this segment of SARS-CoV was substituted into SARS-CoV-2, keeping the rest of the sequence fixed, there would likely still be a large difference between the 3-D structures within that segment.",

Since the segment from 469 to 487 is sampled with the rest of the protein held fixed, the panels show close-ups focusing on the protein backbone for that region of the 3-D structure, along with the nearby amino acids to which this segment is connected. The five lowest energy conformations are shown with different color strands, as indicated in the figure. Some structural variability can be observed within these low-energy samples for each sequence, indicating the SMC sampler is successful at discovering distinct conformations with similarly low energy values. Much greater structural variability can be seen between SARS-CoV-2, RaTG13, and SARS-CoV overall than between the three SARS-CoV-2 variants.",

            "text": "In this paper, we used sequential Monte Carlo to investigate the possible effects to the 3-D structure of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein due to mutations in its amino acid sequence. SMC is potentially a powerful technique for this purpose, as it is effective at sampling conformations with low energy for the segment of interest. Thus, by comparing the sampled conformations for several sequences, the method can help detect changes to the low-energy regions of the 3-D conformational space as a result of the amino acid differences among the sequences. Our results are consistent with the observed differences between the known 3-D structures for the specific variants of SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV in the Protein Data Bank, and also provide some preliminary intuition about the potential role of mutations that are being observed in SARS-CoV-2. Given the current public health concern posed by COVID-19 as a result of the SARS-CoV-2 virus, potential effects of mutations to key viral proteins are of high importance, as structural changes may affect the efficacy of ongoing medical developments. Thus, our work here highlights one problem where sampling methods and data scientists can have an important role. We view this paper as a foray into the area that combines data science with structural biology for COVID-19 research, that we hope can spur further statistical and scientific investigations. Thus we list some limitations of the current study along with potential directions to take. First, there may be other interesting ways to summarize and compare the SMC samples from different sequences. Here, we extracted the 20000 conformations with the lowest energies and treated them equally; for example, all the samples might be kept and weighted according to energies for a more comprehensive analysis. Second, here we only investigated one segment of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein, amino acids 469 to 487. If mutations occur in different locations of the sequence, it could be useful to simultaneously sample conformations for multiple disjoint segments together, e.g., Tang et al. (2015) . Third, we took the energy function as given as in Wong et al. (2018) . Different energy functions could be tried to provide further insights. Fourth, we note that this work is inherently exploratory in nature: insights about a protein's conformational space discovered in this way would require solid scientific corroboration to have a solid biological basis. Thus our work is consistent with the role of computational methods for protein folding that was noted in the Introduction: computation can complement and help provide focus to ongoing medical and scientific efforts. Table 1 , the conformations of the five SMC samples with the lowest energy are displayed in these close-ups (colored in order of ascending energy: grey, turquoise, yellow, blue, orange). A portion of the fixed part of the protein is visible: the white strands where this segment connects to the rest of the protein, along with some nearby helices and sheets.",
