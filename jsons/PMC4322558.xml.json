This hierarchy is defined largely by two prospectively separable subsets of cells that generate colonies containing only one or both lineages (myoepithelial and/or luminal) of cells that make up the bulk of the normal mammary gland structure. The bipotent, clonogenic, progenitor-enriched basal cell fraction also contains putative human mammary stem cells identified in xenotransplantation assays [2,3]. The ability of human mammary cells to be propagated both in vitro and in vivo at limited densities is known to be markedly enhanced by the presence of fibroblast \u2018feeders\u2019 [2,4,5]. These and many other studies have shown that fibroblast interactions are important to the growth of mammary epithelial cells [6-12]. However, a comprehensive characterization of the mechanisms by which fibroblasts regulate the growth and functional organization of normal mammary epithelial cells has been lacking.",

They have previously been used with success to identify mediators of Ras oncogene-induced senescence, suppressors of p16 gene expression, genes that regulate cell migration and cell survival genes in mammary cells [13-16]. This type of investigation is nevertheless dependent on a source of cells that can be obtained in large numbers and readily transfected. Because primary normal mammary epithelial cells, even those derived from human mammoplasties, do not satisfy either of these requirements, we sought an alternative in a clonal diploid isolate of hTERT-immortalized cells [17] that we found remains dependent on fibroblast stimulation for its rapid growth when cultured at low density. By combining automated imaging with siRNA screening of these cells, we identified 43 signal-transducing receptors and secreted factors with functionally validated roles in mediating the in vitro growth of primary normal human mammary epithelial cells.",

Cells were counterstained with Oregon Green 488 or Alexa Fluor 546 phalloidin (Invitrogen) and DRAQ5 nuclear staining prior to imaging on a confocal laser scanning microscope (Nikon Instruments, Melville, NY, USA). For calcein acetoxymethyl ester (calcein AM) and ethidium homodimer 1, 21-day Matrigel cultures were stained unfixed for 20 minutes and counterstained with Hoeschst 33342 (Invitrogen). Immunofluorescence staining of cells in three-dimensional Matrigel cultures cultured for 3 weeks was performed with primary antibodies to E-cadherin (E-cad; Calbiochem, San Diego, CA, USA), GM130 (BD Biosciences), CD49f (STEMCELL Technologies) and Alexa Fluor 680\u2013conjugated secondary antibodies (Invitrogen) and imaged on a Nikon confocal laser scanning microscope. Colonies were counted at five discrete, randomly chosen positions per well using a Nikon confocal laser scanning microscope. Only discrete, well-separated structures were counted. In the cases where two colonies touched or merged, both colonies were ignored for counting purposes. For caspase 3 staining, three-dimensional Matrigel cultures were formalin-fixed and paraffin-embedded, and sections were stained with caspase 3 antibody (Cell Signaling Technology, Danvers, MA, USA). To quantify the proportion of structures with wild-type epithelial organization and polarization, RNAi-treated samples were scored and compared to wild-type localization (see Additional file 1: Figure S7 and Additional file 2: Figure S8A) for examples of each category. For CD49f, the presence of a single basement membrane type of immunoreactive structure was considered the wild type. For GM130 immunoreactivity, wild-type polarization was deemed to be signal-localized between the edge of the colony and an unstained lumen. Lack of polarization would be reflected in the indistinguishable staining patterns between the outer and inner cell layers.",

Lipofectamine 2000 transfection reagent (Invitrogen) was diluted in MEBM and incubated for 5 minutes prior to mixture with an equal volume of prediluted siRNA in MEBM. Complexes were allowed to form for 20 minutes before they were added directly to the cells at a final concentration of 30 nM siRNA and 0.3 \u03bcl of transfection reagent per well. The control wells were static in position and were composed of Lipofectamine alone, siControl-3 and a siRNA pool targeting PLK1. The entire 96-well plates of these controls were staggered throughout the duration of this screen to allow for statistical correction of plate positional effects. After an additional 4 days of growth, cells were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde and stained with 1 \u03bcg/ml 4\u2032,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI) prior to being imaged on an IN Cell Analyzer (GE Healthcare Bio-Sciences, Pittsburgh, PA, USA) using the 10\u00d7 lens objective (numerical aperture, 0.45) with charge-coupled device pixel binning. Twenty-one fields per well were collected using HQ360/40 excitation and HQ535/50 emission filters with a multi-bandpass dichroic filter (Q505lp; Chroma Technology, Bellows Falls, VT, USA). For each image field, a single focal plane was captured using a hardware (laser/photodetector) autofocusing algorithm, which estimated the surface area on which the cells were lying. An image segmentation and postprocessing software workflow was developed using CellProfiler [21]. Cell counts per well produced in the Cell Profiler image analysis were further processed using quantile normalization to correct for data distributional differences induced by factors such as time-dependent stain degradation and other plate-handling artefacts. Quantile-normalized data were then analysed using statistical linear mixed effects regression models to compare cell counts under the siRNA condition with counts under the control condition, adjusted for technical artefacts of well position and plate effects, thereby yielding plate-normalized growth effect estimates for each siRNA. Well position effects were assessed by screening additional plates containing the same control condition in all wells. Plate effects were assessed by using multiple plates for each condition, thereby allowing for adjustment of plate-to-plate variability in the statistical model. The model-estimated cell count under the siRNA condition was then divided by the model-estimated cell count under the control condition to produce an overall measure of relative effect. Measured effects were ranked from smallest to largest, and the latter (those reducing cell growth by 75% or more) were selected for further study. Enrichment network analysis was performed as previously described [22] using the Reactome Functional Interactome plugin in Cytoscape v2.8.1 [23,24].",

Relative hazard estimates for cases with high versus low gene expression were obtained using a Cox proportional hazards model with the binarized expression variable and stratified by integrative cluster (IntClust) breast cancer subtype groups to mitigate for the nonproportional hazards exhibited between various IntClust groups. Expression variables were binarized at the 15%, 25%, 50% and 75% quantiles, and Akaike information criteria (AIC) were calculated using a Cox model containing the binarized expression variable. The binarization cut point was chosen as the quantile yielding the minimum AIC value. In the case that the minimum and maximum AIC values differed by less than 3.0, the median expression level was used as the cut point to ensure adequate case counts within the breast cancer subtype groups. To identify potential instances of interaction between expression level and breast cancer subtype (high versus low expression showing improved survival in one subgroup and poorer survival in another subgroup), a Cox model with binarized expression, IntClust subgroups and their interaction terms was fitted and compared to a Cox model containing IntClust subgroups only, yielding an omnibus test of survival difference due to the biomarker. P-values across all 46 fitted models were adjusted for multiple comparisons using the method of Benjamini and Hochberg [26], and significant findings after adjustment for multiple comparisons were identified. To guard against the issue of changing hazards over time and nonproportional hazards between IntClust subgroups, each binarized biomarker was tested using the G-rho rank test procedure stratified by IntClust subgroups and setting \u03c1 = 1 to place heavier weight on earlier time point observations [27]. P-values from all 46 G-rho tests were adjusted for multiple comparisons, and genes with low false discovery rates were identified.",

The immunoreactivity of inner cells with antibodies to the luminal marker protein MUC1 suggests that differentiation is multilineage. A key element of three-dimensional mammary differentiation is the death of cells forming the lumen of spherical acini. This was observed using calcein AM and ethidium homodimer 1 staining of unfixed three-dimensional cultures (Figure 1B). As with primary bipotent mammary epithelial progenitors [3], 184-hTERT-L9 acini exhibit squamous differentiation of the inner cells in three-dimensional Matrigel cultures, which is appreciable by the morphology of the inner cells stained with phalloidin (Figure 1B).

The primary screen was used for initial hit identification, and multiple secondary screens focused on transmembrane and extracellular protein encoding genes were used to reconfirm and explore the genes implicated (Figure 3A). For the primary and secondary screening assays (Figure 3A), a layer of freshly irradiated murine NIH 3T3 cells was left to adhere for 24 hours prior to addition of a low density of 184-hTERT-L9 cells. After an additional 24 hours, these co-cultures were robotically transfected with the siRNA pools. Although two cell types were present in the assay, two features of the assay were used to bias the primary screen RNAi responses to the epithelial cells. First, the transfection conditions used for the epithelial cells were not capable of efficiently inducing RNAi transcript/protein knockdown in irradiated fibroblast cells (Additional file 5: Figures S3B and S3C), even with species-specific siRNAs (murine \u03b2-actin for NIH 3T3 cells, human GAPDH for IMR-90). The reduced capacity of irradiated versus nonirradiated fibroblasts to mediate RNAi was further demonstrated (Additional file 5: Figures S3A and S3D) using universally cell-lethal positive control siRNA (siTOX; Dharmacon) and siRNA to PLK, showing that irradiation abrogates the functional effects of these positive controls (Additional file 5: Figure S3D), although irradiated fibroblasts are still capable of executing cell death programs. Second, the siRNA library used is human-specific, whereas the fibroblasts are mouse-derived, so any siRNAs entering the cell would be of reduced effectiveness. It is important to note that, in order to confirm that growth effects were related to gene activity in the epithelial cells, all subsequent secondary screen revalidation experiments were carried out either in feeder-free conditions or with transfection into epithelial cells undertaken before placement onto a feeder layer. To quantify cell growth, we counted the number of nuclei per well 4 days after transfection with automated image recognition in duplicate assay plates [21]. In the co-culture conditions we used, changes in total nuclear count reflected the number of epithelial cells present, irrespective of the fixed number of nondividing feeder cells present per well (Additional file 6: Figure S2A).\n",

Of these 388 genes, 140 (36% of those retested) were considered reproducible in that they produced the same magnitude of growth reduction upon reassessment in the secondary screen (Figure 3C) in one or both clonal cell lines.

For this purpose, cells were grown in BPE as opposed to co-culture with irradiated feeder cells to reduce interfering mRNA signals. We found that 47 (33.6%) of 140 of the siRNA pools achieved statistically significant mRNA silencing (adjusted P < 0.05 by Benjamini-Hochberg analysis) (Additional file 7: Table S2C), and these were designated as the target genes for further study.",

(2) We tested growth inhibition using independently designed lentiviral short-hairpin RNA (shRNA) constructs for each of the 47 target genes.

Stably growing clones could not be isolated from 29 shRNAs covering 24 genes, suggesting the inability of these cells to grow upon gene silencing of these genes (verified by qRT-PCR in short-term culture; see Additional file 7: Table S2D), even with BPE present in the medium. Even among the stable clones derived, fibroblast-dependent growth was reduced. In total, 34 (72.3%) of 47 of the transmembrane and/or extracellular space protein encoding transcripts appeared to be required for epithelial cell growth, as determined by siRNA pool deconvolution and/or by knockdown with a second gene RNAi method (shRNA) (Additional file 6: Figure S2B and Additional file 7: Table S2C).",

We observed that there was an inverse correlation (Additional file 8: Figure S4B (rank correlation \u22120.954) and Additional file 9: Figure S5 (rank correlation, \u22120.959)) between caspase activity and the rate of cell increase (determined as AUC over time). We verified that cell proliferation measured by high-content live cell imaging as AUC over time was positively correlated with the fraction of cells in S-phase, which we determined by EdU incorporation (Additional file 8: Figure S4A (rank correlation, 0.735)). The relationship between caspase activation and proliferation was similar, regardless of whether the epithelial cells were grown in feeder-free conditions (Additional file 8: Figure S4B) or with a feeder monolayer (Additional file 9: Figure S5) (feeder to no-feeder rank correlation, 0.892; P < 1 \u00d7 10\u22125 in randomization test).

Notably, a number of guidance factors required for neuronal development are necessary for fibroblast-driven mammary epithelial cell growth [40,41]. Also enriched are clusters of genes involved in axon guidance, signal transduction through protein kinase cascades, intracellular ion homeostasis, GPCR signalling and cell migration (Additional file 10: Figure S6B).

Using short- and long-term cultures (with defined media and no BPE supplements) in Matrigel assays, we sought to determine which of the 47 gene transcripts identified as modulating epithelial cell growth in the co-culture assay were also required for three-dimensional growth and differentiation. First, using acinar formation in short-term culture as a growth measure (that is, counting three-dimensional structures formed after plating cells at low density, as in a two-dimensional colony-forming assay), we determined the requirement for each gene using siRNA knockdown. As siRNA transfection complexes cannot effectively penetrate Matrigel, we transfected cells in culture for 48 hours prior to harvesting and replating them in Matrigel [45]. We determined that siRNA silencing was effective for up to 10 days in Matrigel cultures of 184-hTERT-L9. The number of acini compared to a nontargeting siRNA control was enumerated after 8 days in culture (Figure 5). All but four genes (ADCY4, PCDHB13, KCNJ5 and FLOT2) showed significant (P < 0.001 with Dunnett\u2019s adjustment) reductions of growth in three dimensions, and three genes (HSD17B2, PROCR and SNN) showed more than tenfold reductions in the number of acini. We noted that, despite having the greatest effects on three-dimensional growth, PROCR (31.6-fold decrease in three dimensions; 95% confidence interval (CI), 14.0 to 163.8) and HSD17B2, a transmembrane-linked enzyme required for oestrogen and testosterone steroid biosynthesis (27.3-fold decrease in three dimensions; 95% CI, 10.0 to 163.9) were consistently in the third or fourth quartile of effects on two-dimensional growth in both the primary and secondary two-dimensional screens in comparison to the final 47 target genes.

Among the three genes showing the greatest effects on acinar formation, SNN, HSD17B2 and PROCR (Additional file 7: Table S2C), the shRNAs inhibited growth to a degree precluding derivation of stable clones for all but PROCR.

In transgenic mouse models, overexpression of each of these individual LPA receptors (LPAR1, LPAR2 and LPAR3) under the control of the mouse mammary tumour virus long terminal repeat (MMTV-LTR) promoter led to the formation of late-onset mammary carcinomas [46]. However, our screen of nontransformed human epithelium did not initially identify a role for either LPAR1 or LPAR2 in mammary epithelial cell growth. To verify this, we used siRNA pools to silence LPAR1, LPAR2 and LPAR3 expression in 184-hTERT-L9 cells prior to plating the cells in colony-forming assays. In keeping with the primary siRNA screen results, LPAR3 was required for mammary epithelial cell growth, with moderate growth effects in the colony-forming assay identified when LPAR2 was silenced (Figure 7A). Additionally, in three-dimensional culture conditions, silencing of LPAR1 or LPAR2 did not affect acinar formation, whereas we observed a complete abrogation of three-dimensional growth when LPAR3 was silenced in 184-hTERT cells (Figure 7B).\n",

The strategy employed was to transduce primary epithelium\u2013enriched, but otherwise unsorted, cells obtained from dissociated reduction mammoplasties (see the Methods section for details) and to assay the luminal and basal cell epithelial lineages by scoring colony types in colony-forming assays [10,47-50]. All of the shRNA constructs tested produced statistically significant silencing of the mRNA transcript of interest in epithelial cells (Additional file 7: Table S2D). Transduction efficiency in unsorted primary tissue, as gauged by green fluorescent protein (GFP) expression from the pGIPZ lentiviral vector backbone, was 28.3% (95% CI, 20.2% to 36.1%). Three patient samples were evaluated in technical duplicates for each target gene to compare the effect of the target shRNA to that of a nonsilencing control shRNA. The total number of colonies produced from both luminal and myoepithelial progenitor cells was used to calculate the fraction of surviving colonies (see the Methods section for details) after silencing of the target genes (Figure 8). The high patient-to-patient variability in primary epithelial cell growth is a feature that constrained the quantitative assessment of primary cell growth effects; for example, LPAR3 did not show a statistically significant growth difference. Nevertheless, the data showed a range of quantitative effects on colony formation of cells derived from primary epithelium, with more than two-thirds of the genes exhibiting a median decrease in colony formation and two genes showing a statistically significant decrease in surviving fraction (GPR39 and NTN1; 2.19-fold and 3.33-fold decreases, respectively).\n",

The silencing of all but four of the genes (ADCY4, PCDHB13, KCNJ5 and FLOT2) decreased three-dimensional acinar formation to a level comparable to that seen with PLK1 silencing (which is essential for mitosis). Intriguingly, we have shown that LPAR3 is required for two-dimensional and three-dimensional mammary growth. Given the established importance of LPAR1, LPAR2 and LPAR3 in mammary tumourigenesis, we wanted to confirm that LPAR1 and LPAR2 are indeed irrelevant for growth of normal epithelium (as determined in the primary genetic screen). Colony formation in two-dimensional assays and three-dimensional acinar formation within Matrigel still occur upon silencing of LPAR1 and LPAR2, suggesting that they are not required for the growth of normal, nontransformed epithelial cells. LPAR3 has a greater binding affinity for 2-acyl-LPA with unsaturated fatty acids, whereas LPAR1 and LPAR2 are more responsive to saturated acyl chains [63]. With responsiveness to a similar ligand, it is possible that compensatory redundancy exists between LPAR1 and LPAR2.",

The requirement for long-term cultures (21 days) and the lethality of the shRNAs for SNN and HSD17B2 precluded analysis of these two genes; however, reduction of PROCR in long-term cultures was associated with absence of lumen formation and disorganized epithelial growth. We quantified the relative effects on epithelial organization and lumen formation and observed that disordered differentiation was also present for two axonal pathfinding associated genes, EFNA4 and NTN1, and for LGALS1 (Additional file 1: Figure S7, Figure 8), with differential effects on polarization and epithelial organization. PROCR has been implicated as a receptor for protease-cleaved substrates in breast cancer migration [64] and as a marker of colony-forming cells in malignant cell lines [65]. Here we show for the first time, to our knowledge, a role in growth and differentiation of primary breast epithelium. Loss of NTN1 causes disorganization in the terminal end buds, an effect that is proposed to occur through the loss of cellular adhesions [66]. It has also been shown that implantation of NTN1-secreting pellets into mammary glands during pregnancy increases the number of alveolar structures that develop [67]. In the present study, we show a role for NTN1 in both luminal and bipotent progenitor cell growth in that it was required for colony formation in our in vitro assays.",

We sought to determine if expression of these genes correlated with any of the breast cancer subtypes. Significant, nonrandom differences in expression distribution across the 10 METABRIC datasets was seen for 40 of the 47 genes, with several genes (for example, RIPK2, EFNA4 and TMEM9B) differentially expressed in breast cancer subtypes with high proliferation. Furthermore, we were able to demonstrate independent prognostic significance for CD79A (with elevated expression improving survival in two of the ten METABRIC subtypes) and SERPINH1 (with elevated expression decreasing survival in three of the ten METABRIC subtypes). The possible roles of these genes in the tumour subtypes studied requires future functional studies in representative models; however, it is notable that all of the genes studied here are accessible by virtue of solubility or membrane location, making them a practical choice for intervention.",
