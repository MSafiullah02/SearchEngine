Gnotobiotic mice are axenic mice that are inoculated with a cocktail of one or more known non-pathogenic microorganisms. The fetus inside the mother is sterile and gains microbiota during birth from mother's vagina; therefore to produce GF animals surgical procedures like hysterectomy rederivation are employed. GF mice are maintained in isolators under very strict handling procedures to keep them germ-free.",

GF mice exhibited significant higher turnover rates of DA, NA and 5-HT in the striatum as compared to control counterparts [7]. In a similar study, DA level in the brain was found to be roughly twice in GF than in control mice [32]. This finding was consistent with those in which GF mice displayed increased locomotor activity compared to control counterparts [7], [33]. In contrast, a study reported that the DA, NA, and 5-HT turnover rates were increased in the brainstem, striatum, and medial prefrontal cortex of control mice than in the GF mice, suggesting an increased monoaminergic neurotransmission in the normal mice as compared to the GF mice [34]. Similarly, GF rats exhibited a decreased DA turnover rate in the striatum, hippocampus, and frontal cortex compared to control rats [35]. Interestingly, enzymes responsible for the conversion of tyrosine to DA i.e. tyrosine hydroxylase and DOPA decarboxylase, their synthesis or inhibition is controlled by GMBA [36]. Therefore it is plausible that commensal microbes control brain DA levels, which is depleted in PD. Further, brain tyrosine level is controlled by GM as GF mice had lower tyrosine than normal mice [32].",

Gene expression of NGFI-A, a protein essential for synaptic plasticity, was significantly reduced in prefrontal cortex and striatum of GF mice indicating decreased synaptic plasticity in the striatum of GF mice. Expression levels of proteins involved in synaptogenesis (synaptophysin and PSD-95) in the striatum were remarkably increased in GF mice as compared to control mice. However, no such dissimilarities were found in frontal cortex and hippocampus. Further, microarray analysis revealed significant differential expression profiles of 23 genes in the striatum of GF mice as compared to normal mice. This significant control of GM over striatal synaptogenesis and gene expression could have a role in PD pathology [7].",

Numerous reports now suggest the neuroprotective activity of minocycline in PD. Minocycline prevented neurodegeneration of nigrostriatal dopaminergic neurons and also blocked DA depletion in the striatum and nucleus accumbens in MPTP mouse model of PD [39]. In-vitro, minocycline conferred neuroprotection against the tyrosine hydroxylase immunoreactive neurons using rotenone-induced toxicity in primary dopaminergic cultures [40]. Using fruit fly as a model for PD several studies have reported that minocycline has anti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties and that it conferred potent dopaminergic neuroprotection [41], [42]. Clinically, minocycline was assessed as a potential drug candidate for PD in Phase II trials and is being considered for Phase III trials [43].",

Overall, minocycline has shown to significantly improve disease conditions like rheumatoid arthritis and vascular complications, suggesting that the commensal bacteria contribute at some level to disease development [46], [47], [48]. Minocycline has the ability to rebalance the dysbiotic GM by reducing the Firmicutes/Bacteroidetes ratio [48].

GM and probiotics potential of producing vitamins with antioxidant properties is another interesting research venue which has now been demonstrated to be beneficial for PD pathology. For example; Higher consumption of Vitamin E was associated with a lower risk of PD [56], [57]. It also protected dopaminergic neurons in the SNpc, prevented DA loss and showed protection against paraquat toxicity [58], [59]. Vitamin D3 supplementation prevented the deterioration of the Hoehn & Yahr stage in PD patients [60] and Vitamin D was beneficial in animal (in-vivo) and cell culture (in-vitro) models of PD [61], [62], [63]. Prolonged administration (6 months) of riboflavin show improved motor capacity in PD patients [64]. Low intake of vitamin B6 was associated with an increased risk of PD [65]. Human GM has the potential to synthesize vitamin K and most of the water-soluble B vitamins, such as biotin, cobalamin, folates, pantothenic acid, nicotinic acid, pyridoxine, riboflavin and thiamine [66]. Particularly, probiotic strains like lactobacilli and bifidobacteria are highly capable of producing potential antioxidants, vitamins, and bioactive molecules [reviewed in Ref. [67]] [68], [69], [70], hence are capable of limiting excessive amounts of free radicals, leading to attenuation of several diseases associated with oxidative stress and may be PD too. Recently, a clinical pilot study has shown that a regular intake of fermented milk beverage containing Lactobacillus casei Shirota can significantly improve constipation and bowel movement in PD patients. Since gastrointestinal dysfunction, like constipation, directly contributes to the morbidity of PD patients and exacerbates the clinical scenario, use of probiotic might offer relief from the complications [71].",

For example, chronic and idiopathic constipation are commonly co-morbid in PD patients and can be associated with colonic and anorectal dysmotility [73]. Several case reports suggest the beneficial role of FMT in treating constipation in addition to marked improvement in non-GI symptoms in patients with neurological disorders [74]. Such reports have tweaked the interest of researchers in investigating and identifying the underlying mechanisms as to how GM connects to the pathogenesis of PD. Proposed mechanisms behind FMT benefits include direct communication via the vagus nerve, changes in neurotransmitter metabolism, immune activation, production of neuroactive metabolites and neurotoxins [5], [74], [75], [76]. Since most of the PD patients have gastrointestinal dysfunction, innervation of the gut by the autonomic nervous system (ANS) has provided a novel investigation tool. The ANS connects the gut and the brain, and vagus nerve serves as a major pathway for relaying the signals in GMBA. This autonomic input from the gut is connected to the limbic system of the brain, which includes the hippocampus, the amygdala, and the limbic cortex. Limbic cortex is of importance since it regulates motor functions, which are impaired in PD. The connection between the limbic system and ANS is a critical factor underlying between gut health and brain & behavior [77]. Recently, it was found that fecal transplant from PD patients exacerbated motor impairment with reduction in Lachnospiraceae and Ruminococceae in recipient mice model of PD. Interestingly, same genera were significantly reduced in fecal samples from PD patients [27].",

H. pylori has also been proven to reduce DA levels in the areas of the brain controlling locomotion [88]. It is possible that H. pylori might not have a direct involvement in PD pathogenesis, but its presence in GIT and systemic circulation could affect the advancement and treatment strategies of PD, likely by initiating inflammation and autoimmune responses [89], [90], [91]. Working on similar mechanism other infectious agents like a virus (encephalitis, AIDS, coronavirus) [92], [93], [94] and bacteria [95], [96], [97], have been found in PD patients and could have a causal link.",

Another study showed that common soil bacteria like Streptomyces venezuelae could also act as a source of toxicity and contributor to dopaminergic neurodegeneration [100]. Most recently, a study analyzed the antibody titers against some common infectious pathogens in the serum of PD patients and normal controls. They found that the infectious burden of cytomegalovirus, Epstein-Barr virus, herpes simplex virus type-1, Borrelia burgdorferi, Chlamydophila pneumoniae and H. pylori were associated with PD. Both bacterial burden and viral burden were independently associated with PD. The study provided strong evidence to the hypothesis of microbial underlining of PD etiology [101].",

Systemic exposure of epoxomicin in rats led to neurodegeneration in the SNpc and other regions in a pattern similar to that found in PD. Additionally, neurodegeneration was accompanied by the intracytoplasmic Lewy body-like inclusions which were positive for \u03b1-synuclein and ubiquitin [102]. Using fish as a model, epoxomicin caused a reduction in spontaneous movement, selective loss of dopaminergic and noradrenergic neurons, and formation of Lewy bodies in the CNS, a pattern similar to PD [103]. These findings demonstrate that epoxomicin is an effective dopaminergic neurotoxin as it can induce the pathological features of PD.",
