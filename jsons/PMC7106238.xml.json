            "text": "The nucleocapsid (N) protein is encoded by the 9th ORF of SARS-CoV. The same ORF also codes for another unique accessory protein called ORF9b, though in a different reading frame, whose function is yet to be defined. The N-protein is a 46 kDa protein composed of 422 amino acids (Rota et al., 2003). Its N-terminal region consists mostly of positively charged amino acids, which is responsible for RNA binding. A lysine rich region is present between 373 and 390 amino acids at the C-terminus, which is predicted to be the nuclear localization signal. Besides that, a SR-rich motif is present in the middle region encompassing 177\u2013207 amino acids. Biophysical studies done by Chang et al. (2006) have suggested that this protein is composed of two independent structural domains and a linker region. The first domain is present at the N-terminus, inside the putative RNA binding domain. The second domain consists of the C-terminal region that is capable of self-association. Between these two structural domains, there lies a highly disordered region, which serves as a linker. This region has been reported to interact with the membrane (M) protein and human cellular hnRNPA1 protein (Fang et al., 2006, Luo et al., 2005a, Luo et al., 2005b). Besides, this region is also predicted to be a hot spot for phosphorylation. Hence, in summary, the N-protein can be classified into three distinct regions (Fig. 1\n), which may serve completely different functions during different stages of the viral life cycle. A similar mode of organization has been reported for other coronavirus nucleocapsid proteins.",

Using a site-directed mutagenesis approach, the sumoylation motif has been mapped to the lysine residue 62, which is present in a putative sumo-modification domain (GK62EE). Their data further suggests that sumoylation may play a key role in modulating homo-oligomerization, nucleolar translocation and cell-cycle deregulatory property of the N-protein. Further experimental support regarding sumoylation of N-protein came from another independent study carried out by Fan et al. (2006) wherein they have demonstrated an association between the N-protein and Hubc9, which is a ubiquitin conjugating enzyme of the sumoylation system. They have also mapped the interaction domain to the SR-rich motif, which is in agreement with the earlier report. However, they failed to detect the involvement of the GKEE motif in mediating this interaction (Fan et al., 2006).",

Later on, from results obtained in our laboratory as well as by other researchers, it is now clear that the N-protein is a substrate of multiple cellular kinases. First experimental evidence for the phosphorylation status of the N-protein came from the study done by Zakhartchouk et al. (2005) wherein by 32P orthophosphate labelling, they were able to observe phosphorylation of adenovirus vector expressed N-protein in 293T cells. Further studies done in our laboratory clearly confirmed this observation. Majority of the N-protein was found to be phosphorylated at its serine residues (although the involvement of threonine and tyrosine residues could not be detected, they may be occurring in vivo). In addition, using a variety of biochemical assays, it was proved that, at least in vitro, the N-protein could get phosphorylated by mitogen activated protein kinase (MAP kinase), cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK), glycogen synthase kinase 3 (GSK3), and casein kinase 2 (CK2). Also, this data provides preliminary indication regarding phosphorylation-dependent nucleo-cytoplasmic shuttling of the N-protein (Surjit et al., 2005). Whether these events actually bear any functional significance in vivo, remains yet to be established.",

            "text": "In contrast to the N-protein of many other coronaviruses, the SARS-CoV N-protein is predominantly distributed in the cytoplasm, when expressed heterologously or in infected cells (Surjit et al., 2005, You et al., 2005, Rowland et al., 2005). In infected cells, a few cells exhibited nucleolar localization (You et al., 2005). As reported by You et al. (2005) the N-protein contains pat4, pat7, and bipartite-type nuclear localization signals. It has also been predicted to possess a potential CRM-1 dependent nuclear export signal. However, no clear experimental evidence could be obtained regarding the involvement of these signature sequences in regulating the localization of the N-protein. Interestingly, studies done in our laboratory revealed that the majority of N-protein localized to the nucleus in serum starved cells. This phenomenon could be reproducibly observed both in biochemical fractionation as well as immunofluorescence studies. In addition, treatment of cells with specific inhibitors of different cellular kinases such as CK2 inhibitor and CDK inhibitor, resulted in retention of a fraction of the N-protein in the nucleus, whereas GSK3 and MAPK inhibitor had very little effect. Further, N was found to be efficiently phosphorylated by the cyclin\u2013CDK complex, which is known to be active only in the nucleus. The N-protein was also found to associate with 14-3-3 protein in a phospho-specific manner and inhibition of the 14-3-3\u03b8 protein level by siRNA resulted in nuclear accumulation of the N-protein. Although these experiments are too preliminary to conclusively provide any answer regarding the intra-cellular localization of N-protein, nevertheless they do provide substantial clues regarding the physical presence of the N-protein in the nucleus, under certain circumstances, which may be a very dynamic phenomenon. Another study done by Timani et al. (2005) using different deletion mutants of the N-protein fused to EGFP, showed that the N-terminal of N, which contains the NLS 1 (aa 38\u201344) localizes to the nucleus, whereas the C-terminal region containing both NLS 2 (aa 257\u2013265) and NLS 3 (aa 369\u2013390) localizes to the cytoplasm and nucleolus. Using a combination of different deletion mutants, they concluded that the N-protein may act as a shuttle protein between cytoplasm\u2013nucleus and nucleolus. Taken together, all these results further suggest that the N-protein per se has the physical ability to localize to the nucleus. Whether this localization is regulated through phosphorylation mediated activation of a potential NLS or piggy-backing by association with another cellular nuclear protein or through any other mechanism remains to be established.",

While testing the packaging of an RNA bearing GFP fused to SARS-CoV packaging signal into this particle, they observed that the presence of the N-protein is an absolute requirement. However, the N-protein was not essential for the assembly of the empty particle per se. Further, by performing a filter binding assay using recombinant N-protein, they were able to identify two independent RNA binding domains in the N-protein; one at the N-terminus (1\u2013235 aa) and the other at the C-terminus (236\u2013384 aa).

            "text": "Initial studies done in our laboratory using a yeast two-hybrid assay revealed that N-protein is able to self-associate through its C-terminal 209 amino acid residues (Surjit et al., 2004a, Surjit et al., 2004b, Surjit et al., 2004c). A parallel study done by He et al. (2004) using the mammalian two-hybrid system and sucrose gradient fractionation also proved the ability of the N-protein to self-associate to form an oligomer. They further mapped the interaction region to 184\u2013196 amino acid residues, encompassing the SR-rich motif. However, there were some discrepancies regarding the interaction domain mapped in these two studies. Later on, extensive biophysical and biochemical analysis done by Chen lab (Yu et al., 2005, Yu et al., 2006) and Jiang lab (Luo et al., 2005a, Luo et al., 2005b, Luo et al., 2006) have enriched our understanding of the oligomerisation process of the N-protein. In summary, the SR-rich motif does possess binding affinity, but this is specific for the central region (211\u2013290 aa) of another molecule of N-protein, instead of the SR-rich motif itself. The C-terminal region (283\u2013422 aa) possess binding affinity for itself and to associate into a dimer, trimer, tetramer or hexamer, in a concentration-dependent manner. The essential sequence for oligomerisation of the N-protein was identified to be residues 343\u2013402. Interestingly, this region also encompasses the RNA binding motif of the N-protein, which prompts us to speculate that there might be mutual interplay between RNA binding and oligomerisation activities of the N-protein. Further, the oligomerisation was observed to be independent of electrostatic interactions and addition of single strand DNA to the reaction mixture containing tetramers of the N-protein promoted oligomerisation. Thus, it has been proposed that once the tetramer is formed by protein\u2013protein interaction between nucleocapsid molecules, binding with genomic RNA prompts further assembly of the complete nucleocapsid structure.",

(2005) proved that mutation of the sumoylation motif in the N-protein leads to cell cycle arrest. Work done in our laboratory has shown the inhibition of S phase progress in cells expressing the N-protein (Surjit et al., 2006). Further, we have observed down-regulation of S phase specific gene products like cyclin E and CDK2 in SARS-CoV infected cell lysate, which suggest that the observed phenomenon may be relevant in vivo. In an attempt to further characterize the mechanism of cell cycle blockage induced by the N-protein, several biochemical and mutational analysis were carried out. The results thus obtained demonstrated that the N-protein directly inhibits the activity of the cyclin\u2013CDK complex, resulting in hypophosphorylation of retinoblastoma protein with a concomitant down-regulation of E2F1-mediated transactivation. Analysis of RXL and CDK phosphorylation mutant N-protein identified the mechanism of inhibition of CDK4 and CDK2 activity to be different. Whereas the N-protein could directly bind to cyclin D and inhibit the activity of CDK4\u2013cyclin D complex; inhibition of CDK2 activity appeared to be achieved in two different ways: indirectly by down-regulation of protein levels of CDK2, cyclin E, and cyclin A, and by direct binding of N-protein to CDK2\u2013cyclin complex. Nevertheless, the mechanism of cell cycle deregulation in vivo, if any, remains to be understood.",

Nevertheless, pretreatment of cells with IFN blocks SARS-CoV infection (Spiegel et al., 2005, Zheng et al., 2004). Based on this observation, Palese lab has studied the IFN inhibitory property of different SARS-CoV proteins, which revealed that ORF3b, ORF6 as well as the N-protein have the ability to independently inhibit IFN production through different mechanisms. The N-protein was found to inhibit the activity of IRF3 and NFkB in host cells, resulting in inhibition of IFN synthesis. IRF3 activity was also blocked by 3b and ORF6 proteins, but inhibition of NFkB activity was a property unique to the N-protein. In addition, 3b and ORF6 proteins were able to block STAT1 activity through different mechanisms (Kopecky-Bromberg et al., 2007). All these data suggest that SARS-CoV may employ multiple factors to check the activity of host immune system and N-protein may be one of the major partners in this process. It may be possible that these different factors act independently during different stages of viral life cycle. In that case, regulatory activity of the N-protein will be as indispensible as its structural activity.",

This may be attributed to the localization of N-protein inside the viral envelope, which will not be accessible to the antibody during infection. It is noteworthy that the most effective SARS-CoV structural protein that can induce neutralizing antibody production is the S-protein (Buchholz et al., 2004). The S antibody could block viral infection with 100% efficiency.

As reported by the authors, fusion with calreticulin specifically enhanced the efficiency and significantly reduced the titre of challenging vector (vaccinia virus). The authors have proposed that N-protein may be the logical choice as a target antigen in the event of S antibody dependent enhancement (ADE) of infection. However, ADE phenomenon has not been observed during spike-mediated vaccination (Buchholz et al., 2004). Another study done by Wang et al.

Although they report the production of some B-cell and T-cell responses against N-protein, however stringent immune response was obtained for the S- and M-proteins, thus scaling down the choice of N-protein as a suitable candidate vaccine (Wang et al., 2005). A similar plasmid mediated vaccination approach has also been reported by Zhao et al. (2004) wherein they have immunised mice with the DNA construct (pCI vector) expressing the N-protein. They too have reported the generation of a robust B-cell and T-cell immune response in animals. Another group of workers have also reported successful use of the N-protein as a DNA vaccine. They immunised mice by intra-mucosal injection of the N-protein expressing plasmid vector and were able to obtain specific humoral and T-cell responses (Zhu et al., 2004).",

By using overlapping synthetic peptides spanning the N-protein, they have identified dominant helper T-cell epitopes in the nucleocapsid protein of SARS-CoV. Immunization of mice with peptides emcompassing these dominant TH-cell epitopes resulted in strong cellular immunity in vivo. Priming with the helper peptides significantly accelerated the immune response induced by the N-protein. Further, by fusing with a conserved neutralizing epitope from the spike protein of SARS-CoV, two of the TH-cell epitope bearing peptides assisted in the production of higher titre neutralizing antibodies in vivo, in comparision to spike epitope alone or its mixture with TH epitope of N. Thus, it is practically possible to generate a better immune response by using a fusion of N- and S-protein. However, the TH epitopes identified in their report is specific to mouse. Therefore, TH epitopes identified in that study will not be useful for human. Nevertheless, their data provides useful information for the design of peptide-based anti-SARS-CoV vaccines.",

            "text": "It is a significant achievement for the research community that within a short span of time, we have been able to obtain more or less a clear understanding regarding the structural and functional properties of the N-protein. However, it is a fact worth mentioning that all the studies done here were performed with in vitro experiments, using recombinantly expressed N-protein, in isolation. So at present, all we can conclude is that, the N-protein per se has the physical ability to perform the above described functions, in other words N-protein does bear the necessary signature sequence or motifs or conformation to perform these functions under suitable circumstances. Whether a similar event is recapitulated in vivo during viral infection, will be dependent on several criteria: (i) net effect of other viral factors on the activity of N-protein, (ii) net translation and turn over rate of N-protein, (iii) a conducive intra-cellular milieu, and (iv) net modulation of an already skewed cellular pathway by other viral factors. Hence, it will be interesting to re-evaluate the properties of N-protein in a SARS-CoV infection model. However, owing to the limited user friendliness and accessibility of an infection system, probably we still have to resort to in vitro systems for further analysis of the characteristics of N-protein. One of the better experimental system has already been established by the Chang lab (Hsieh et al., 2005), wherein all the structural proteins were co-expressed to form VLP in 293T cells. If this system can be further improved to optimise the rate of synthesis of these different proteins to a near in vivo level, it will at least enable us to study the net effect of the N-protein with respect to other viral proteins. Further establishment of a replicon system may also be helpful. In addition, some of the interesting preliminary observations reported by several laboratories need to be elaborately analysed. To begin with, the reported interaction of the N-protein with genomic RNA packaging signal needs to be further characterised and mapped. Since the oligomerisation domain and the RNA binding regions of the N-protein overlap with each other, the suggested possibility of regulated genome incorporation and capsid assembly should be further characterised with the aid of a replicon system or a particle assembly system. In addition, the reported ability of the N-protein to modulate different cellular pathways should be further characterised in the particle assembly system or at least in the presence of other viral accessory proteins.",

It has been shown to bind NFkB response element of COX2 promoter and enhance COX2 gene expression. This activity may be further empowering the N-protein to manipulate the entire gene expression programme of the infected cell. Therefore, studies should be initiated to elaborately analyse this phenomenon. It seems to deserve so much attention because another study done by Palese lab has proved the ability of the N-protein to inhibit NFkB activity, which results in inhibition of IFN synthesis. Further, Liao et al. (2005) have reported the activation of NFkB by N-protein in Vero E6 cells and He et al. (2005) failed to detect any change in NFkB activity in the same cells. Therefore it needs to be clarified whether N enhances NFkB activity and if yes; whether upregulation of COX2 transcription by direct DNA binding is a property specific to that promoter or it is a global phenomenon. In such a scenario, there may be complicated crosstalk between the ability of N-protein to deregulate the expression of COX2 and IFN in infected cells.",
