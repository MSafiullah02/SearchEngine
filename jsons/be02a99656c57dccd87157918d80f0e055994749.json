Based on a nanomechanical analysis of the structure and motions of atoms and molecules at multiple scales, we report sonified versions of the coronavirus spike protein of the pathogen of COVID-19, 2019-nCoV. The audio signal, created using a novel nanomechanical sonification method, features an overlay of the vibrational signatures of the protein's primary, secondary and higher-order structures. Presenting musical encoding in two versions -one in the amino-acid scale and one based on equal temperament tuning -the method allows for expressing protein structures in audible space, offering novel avenues to represent, analyze and design architectural features across length-and time-scales. We further report a hierarchical frequency spectrum analysis of five distinct protein structures, which offer insights into how genetic mutations, and the binding of the virus spike protein to the human ACE2 cell receptor directly influence the audio. Applications of the approach may include the development of de novo antibodies by designing protein sequences that match, through melodic counterpoints, the binding sites in the spike protein. Other applications of audible coding of matter include material design by manipulating sound, detecting mutations, and offering a way to reach out to broader communities to explain the physics of proteins. It also forms a physics-based compositional technique to create new art, referred to as materiomusic, which is akin to finding a new palette of colors for a painter. Here, the nanomechanical structure of matter, reflected in an oscillatory framework, presents a new palette for sound generation, and can complement or support human creativity.",

            "text": "Protein molecules consist of 20 naturally occurring amino acid building blocks that are assembled into hierarchical structures across various length-scales [6] [7] [8] . Proteins are usually classified by their structural organization, from primary structure (also known as the sequence of amino acids), secondary structure (local folded geometry: e.g., beta-sheet or alpha-helix), as well as tertiary and quaternary structure (overall folded arrangement). More broadly, the folded structure of proteins, encoded by the sequence of DNA, determines material function and failure in the context of disease or injury [8] [9] [10] [11] [12] [13] [14] . This biomaterial organization is reminiscent of the way by which musical compositions can be described, starting from basic harmonic waves (for instance a sine wave), different timbres (overlaying harmonic waves modulated in pitch, volume, and other measures, over time), melodies, chords and multiple chords and melodies played together and against each other. The integrated perspective on all aspects of these assemblies, processed simultaneously through the human auditory system, provides an efficient approach for our brains to understand complex data structures in soundwhat humans commonly perceive as \"music\" [15] . In sonification, we exploit this skill, and use sonification to translate complex data into audible sounds [16, 17] .",

The basis to mapping each of the 20 amino acids onto a unique musical tone is the distinct vibrational spectrum of the molecules as explained in these references: [2, 17] . In fact, since each of the amino acids has a unique vibrational spectrum, we may distinguish each of them by its unique sound, or timbre, which is reflected in the overlay of all modal frequencies. Since the eigenmodes are orthogonal, energy does not spill from one mode to another, which implies that they are a fundamental way to understand the vibrational spectrum and sounding of a molecule or assembly. Since each amino acid features a distinct audible expression, defined by their unique profile of molecular vibrations, we can assume that they can be assigned a particular musical \"note\" or tone. In this framework, the primary sequence of amino acids defines the note sequence played, which is augmented by the other components [19, 20] The next higher level of organization of a protein is the secondary structure, reflecting the local organization of the 1D chain into helices or sheets (or other structures). We incorporate information about the secondary structure associated with each amino acid in the translation step by affecting the duration and volume of notes. During the translation process from protein to music we use the DSSP algorithm to compute the secondary structure from the protein geometry file and sequence [13, 22] . As presented in earlier work [19, 20] the method of transpositional equivalence is used to scale the frequencies to the audible range, however, while maintaining the accurate ratio of frequencies in the signals generated.",

Unlike the insertions described in the previous section, the insertions now added are played on top of the primary notes reflecting the primary and secondary structure of the protein. The resulting complex overlapping melodies represent a kind of counterpoint argument in musicthe concept where notes are played against notessuch as used widely by J.S. Bach [28, 29] . Counterpoint is a powerful means to manifest references of closeness in a time sequence coded manifestation of signals. It is also the basis for pleasantness of music, whereas a balance of repetition and variation is a foundational structural element.

Representative audio signals are included as Supplementary Material (comparison_5i08-6vsb.wav), where the distinction is clearly audible, between 5 distinct protein conformations (the order of tones is as depicted in Figure 4B to 4D, repeated twice overall, representing a total of 10 tones). This example illustrates how the audible system is capable to quickly discern differences in the spectrum, and hence, the vibrational context of a protein structure. This method to assess vibrational changes can be useful to investigate the impacts of sequence changes, or to screen for effects across a very large number of protein data. Figure 4C shows the normal mode vibrational frequencies of three protein complexescomparing scenarios of the virus spike protein attached (6PDB ID m17) with proteins without the virus spike protein (PDB IDs 6m18 and 6m1d) (for a detailed discussion of these protein confirmations, see [35] ). Figure 4D shows the frequency spectrum of the audio signal. It can be clearly recognized how the attachment of the virus spike protein with the human cell receptor changes the frequency spectrum, and it can also be clearly heard. You can hear the transition between the attached state vs. the unattached state between the third and fourth tone, respectively. Notably, when looking at the frequency spectrum, the binding of the virus to the ACE2 receptor leads to a lowering of the frequency spectrum.",

An arpeggio is a way to play the notes of a chord in succession, rather than sounding them simultaneously.

When applied in this context, human composers may intersect with the compositions generated by alone, forming a new axis of intersection across scales and species. The focus on proteins is motivated since they are the most abundant material component of all living things: Especially their motion, structure and failure in the context of both normal physiological function and disease is a foundational question that transcends academic disciplines and can be a footing to explore fundamental nanomechanical questions.",

The approach allowed us to extract new musical compositions of the coronavirus spike protein as one way to represent nature's concept of hierarchy as a paradigm to create function from universal building blocks, and exploring the vibrational complexity of a large protein design.

A virus' genome hijacks the host cell's protein manufacturing machinery, and forces it to replicate the viral genome and produce viral proteins to make new viruses from it. In light of this nature of viruses, the work explores the fine line between the emergent beauty of life and death as opposite poles, an aspect also critically important for nanomaterials and human health. As one listens to the protein we find that the intricate design results in interesting and actually pleasing, relaxing sounds. The reason for this is that the virus spike protein represents a complex, beautiful design (see also Figure 1 ). Of course, the intricate protein principles at the basis of the virus do not at all convey the deadly impacts this particularly protein is having on the world. From another vantage point, the pleasing aspect of the music shows the deceiving nature of the virus when it enters the cells by binding to exterior receptors, in order to hijacks our body to replicate. The pleasant sounds represent an analogy for the nature of the virus to deceive the host and exploit it for its own multiplication, emerging as the residue after the transactional infections that diminish or kill the host.",

In materials science, a pair of atoms may be subject to singular forces near a crack tip [37] . In many systems, a complex structure of a composition of building blocks may solely exist for the purpose of a single, unique, singular note, one of the significant deep foundational questions of many forms of art. Specifically in the context of music, when played alone that note would not have particular exposition. It is only in the context of the whole piece that it stands out. In proteins, we can see a similarity to this singular perspective in point mutations, where certain changessuch as point mutationsare particularly relevant.",

The novel coronavirus is believed to enter human cells via the ACE2 receptor on the exterior of cells [18, 35] . ACE2 is an enzyme attached to the outer surface of cells found in our lungs, heart, arteries, kidney, and intestines (whereas one of its natural role is blood pressure regulation). One possible engineering task could be to create a protein molecule, through counterpoint composition, that binds more easily to the virus spike, hence shutting down the pathway of infection. An analysis of the mechanism of interaction between ACE2 and the spike protein can perhaps provide useful insights, and the intersection of these two proteins could be subject of future experimentation in musical space. Not only could this be tackled using human writing, but could also be performed using AI models, as demonstrated in earlier work [2, 20] . The data depicted in Figure 4C clearly demonstrated that the binding of the virus spike protein to the human cell leads to an audible change in the sounds generated.",

It also forms a physicsbased compositional technique to create new art, referred to as materiomusic, which can be explained akin to finding a new palette of colors for a painter. Here, the nanomechanical structure of matter, reflected in an oscillatory framework, presents a new palette for sound generation. A summary of the new palette of sounds, specifically the 20 amino acid tones, are summarized graphically in Figure 6 . The bio-nano-science of molecular motions can hence offer several avenues of future investigation and applications in the interrelated fields of science, art and engineering.

The image provides a direct visualization of the various secondary structure motifs that make up the protein, which in turn fold into complex shapes. All this information is incorporated into the musical expression of the protein. The plot in panel A shows amino acid residues that are close to each other in brighter red colors, providing an overall image of the protein's 3D folded structure. Panel B depicts the connectome as reported in [31] , and rendered via the neuPRINT server [39] , showing the similarity of folding concepts in the neural network design in the brain. Panel C shows a plot with only the closest neighbors highlighted, with distances less than 4.5A. Panel D depicts, schematically, how the overall folding geometry is coded in that way.
