However, the 2\u20135 year event- or progression-free survival for patients with relapsed or refractory NHL ranged from about 31\u201353% in selected series with lower figures generally observed for patients with primary refractory disease, transformed lymphomas, or high-risk features prior to transplantation (high LDH, bulky disease, extranodal involvement).3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12 Similarly, the 3\u20135 year actuarial disease or event-free survival for patients with relapsed or refractory HD ranged from 32 to 64% in selected series with lower figures generally observed for patients with primary refractory disease or high-risk features at the time of transplantation including \u2018B\u2019 symptoms, elevated LDH levels, chemotherapy resistance, bulky disease and decreased performance status.13,14,15,16,17,18,19 The chief cause for treatment failure in the majority of these studies was disease progression or relapse, meaning that 50% or more of patients who received autotransplants for relapsed or refractory NHL or HD had relapses of disease.",

            "text": "New strategies designed to reduce the incidence of relapse after autotransplantation must take the following considerations into account: (1) the limited hematopoietic reserve during the early post-transplant period; (2) the temporal and anatomic patterns of relapse; and (3) the mechanisms responsible for lymphoma cell resistance to high-dose chemotherapy. In two representative studies, the median time to relapse or progression was 4 months for NHL patients and 5 months for HD patients. Only about 10% of relapses in both groups occurred 2 years or more after transplant.12,13 In addition, about two-thirds of the relapses involved sites of prior disease. The precise mechanisms responsible for resistance to high-dose chemotherapy are unknown, but presumably they include those which are thought to operate in lymphomas that recur after conventional-dose regimens. These mechanisms include up-regulation of P-glycoprotein,20,21 up-regulation of bcl-2 expression,22,23,24 and mutation of the P53 genes.22,24 The latter two mechanisms may block the induction of apoptosis by a variety of important anti-neoplastic drugs. Indeed, the induction of apoptosis by the alkylating agents typically used in high-dose regimens (eg melphalan) is highly dependent upon the presence of wild-type P53 genes.25 These facts imply that in order to decrease relapse rates after HDT, additional treatment must be rendered early after recovery from HDT and should include the sites of prior disease. Administration of non-cross-resistant chemotherapy may be important in this effort.",

            "text": "With this background, two clinical protocols were developed which contained several treatment modifications designed to address some of the problems which were identified above. First, the high-dose chemotherapy regimen was modified from the standard BEAM regimen (BCNU/etoposide/cytarabine/melphalan) by the substitution of gemcitabine for cytarabine and etoposide. Compared to cytarabine, gemcitabine has equivalent anti- leukemic activity in murine and human pre-clinical leukemia models and a longer intracellular retention time while displaying a lack of cross-resistance to doxorubicin, etoposide, cyclophosphamide, melphalan, cisplatin, and methotrexate.26,27,28 Gemcitabine also has single agent activity in heavily pre-treated patients with relapsed HD and NHL.29 Additionally, etoposide was given at a higher dose level in combination with cyclophosphamide for pre-transplant cytoreduction and stem cell mobilization. Second, during the early post-transplant period (approximately weeks 4\u20138) when hematopoietic recovery might be incomplete, patients were scheduled to be treated with agents considered to have limited effects on marrow function: patients with B cell NHL were assigned to receive the anti-CD20 monoclonal antibody rituxan in combination with GM-CSF while patients with HD and T cell NHL were assigned to receive low-moderate dose involved-field radiation to sites of pre-transplant involvement. The rationale for adding GM-CSF to rituxan was to potentially augment antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC) through enhanced effector cell recruitment and activation.30,31,32,33 The third innovation was to utilize a series of consolidation chemotherapy treatments at 3, 6, 9 and 12 months post transplant when hematopoietic recovery might be more complete. The regimen for months 3 and 9 was dexamethasone-cyclophosphamide-etoposide-cisplatin-gemcitabine (DCEP-G) and the regimen for months 6 and 12 was dexamethasone-paclitaxel- cisplatin (DPP). The DCEP-G regimen was modified from DCEP which was originally developed for the treatment of patients with relapses of myeloma after autotransplantation.34 This regimen produced major responses (>75% reductions in paraprotein levels) in 41% of patients with relapsed myeloma. In addition, equivalent responses were observed for patients with both plasmacytic and plasmablastic histologies, suggesting that this regimen might also be active for patients with other aggressive lymphoid neoplasms. To permit inclusion of gemcitabine, a novel agent with single agent activity against advanced NHL and especially HD,35 the doses of cyclophosphamide, etoposide, and cisplatin were attenuated from the original DCEP. Paclitaxel was utilized because responses to tubulin-active agents do not appear to depend on the presence of wild-type p53,25 and paclitaxel is a potent inducer of bcl-2 phosphorylation which leads to inactivation of this anti-apoptotic oncogene.36 Furthermore, the administration of paclitaxel alone to patients with relapsed or refractory NHL resulted in overall response rates of 17% (140 mg/m2) or 25% (200 mg/m2) and an overall response rate of 44% when combined with moderately high-dose cyclophosphamide.37,38,39 Therefore, it was anticipated that the DPP regimen might be active against residual alkylator-resistant lymphoma cells which remained after high-dose therapy. In this paper, we describe the outcomes of 55 patients with advanced aggressive NHL and HD who were offered the series of post-transplant consolidation treatments outlined above.",

            "text": "To address the problem of high relapse rates after autotransplantation for relapsed or refractory NHL or HD, we attempted to introduce a series of post-transplant consolidation treatments. Early after transplantation, relatively non-myelotoxic treatments were administered: rituxan combined with GM-CSF for patients with B cell NHL and involved-field radiation for patients with HD or T cell NHL. Later after transplantation, patients were eligible to receive DCEP-G alternating with DPP at 3, 6, 9 and 12 months. Several conclusions can be drawn for this experience. First, post-transplant consolidation treatments are feasible and generally well-tolerated. Twenty-five of the 26 patients with B cell NHL who survived long enough to receive rituxan + GM-CSF, completed all four infusions and none had serious infusion-related toxicities. In addition, myelosuppression was mild and infrequent. However, two of the patients who received the rituxan infusions, later developed complications: bronchiolitis obliterans (1 patient) and a demyelinating encephalopathy (1 patient) which was consistent with progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy although JC virus DNA was not detected by in situ hybridization. The occurrence of these unusual complications of HDT, which may be linked to infections, highlights the need for close monitoring of patients who receive post-transplant therapies with immunosuppressive potential. Indeed, another study of adjuvant rituxan after autotransplantation revealed delayed immune recovery but no apparent increase in post-transplantation infections.42 None of the eight patients who received post-transplant involved-field radiation had late-stage infections but one patient developed restrictive lung disease, highlighting the need for close monitoring of pulmonary function in those patients who receive post-transplant radiation to the chest.",

The event-free and overall survival figures for the cohort of patients with B cell NHL were no better than published results due to the relatively high rates of relapse and treatment-related mortality in this series. These causes of treatment failure may be due in part to patient selection given the relatively high proportion of patients (42%) who were transplanted with primary refractory disease. Nonetheless, the apparent failure of post-transplant consolidation therapy to delay or prevent relapse in this cohort of challenging patients with advanced B cell NHL may indicate that the post-transplant chemotherapy regimens were largely ineffective or that re-growth of lymphoma was too rapid for the treatments to be completed. Indeed, six of the 15 patients (40%) who received post-transplant chemotherapy had relapses and of the 15 patients treated, only nine (60%) were able to receive three or more courses of consolidation chemotherapy.",

Eight of the 10 patients (80%) received three or more courses of consolidation chemotherapy.

The 2-year EFS for the current cohort was significantly better than the historical cohort after adjustment for previously identified independent prognostic factors.13 These factors included disease status at transplant (minimal vs bulky), remission status (refractory vs relapsed), and administration of post-transplant involved-field radiation. However, the possibility remains that the observed difference could be due to other factors such as the use of gemcitabine in the GBM conditioning.
