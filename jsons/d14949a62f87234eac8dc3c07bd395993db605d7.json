The 28 exceedance and K-means cluster analysis demonstrated that census tracts in the northeastern, 29 eastern, southeastern and northwestern regions of the county are at highest risk. The results of 30 age-based estimations of hospitalization rates showed the western part of the County might be in 31 greater need of hospital beds. However, cross-referencing the vulnerability model with the 32 estimation of potential hospitalized patients showed that part of the County has the least access 33 to medical facilities. 34 Conclusion: Policy makers can use this planning tool to identify neighborhoods at high risk for 35 becoming hot spots; efficiently match community resources with needs, and ensure that the most 36 vulnerable have access to equipment, personnel, and medical interventions. 37 Introduction 38 The outbreak of the novel Coronavirus was first reported in Wuhan, China but has since 39 spread to almost every country in the world. The highest number of cases and deaths, as of this 40 writing, has been reported in the U. S. [1] Within the 50 states, there is an apparent disparity in 41 the number and causes of infections and their spread within each state. However, what is 42 common to all cases reported thus far, is the rates of mortality and hospitalizations that appear to 43 be highest among relatively older populations and populations with underlying medical 44 conditions that facilitate morbidity due to COVID-19 [2-8]. 45",

Using 133 the detailed variables in the census data, education in this study was defined as the percent of the 134 population with high school diplomas or higher degrees. Due to the importance of age in the 135 vulnerability to COVID-19, both median age and the percent of the population in decadal age136 intervals were calculated. The percent of the population below the poverty line was chosen as the 137 main economic variable, and the household density was calculated by dividing the total number 138 of households by the area of each census tract. 139 Two measures of vulnerability to flooding were defined, using data from Hurricane 140 Harvey that had severe impacts on Harris County in 2017: i) the ratio of the number of 141 households that filed damage claims based on Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) 142 data [35] to the total number of houses in each tract, and ii) the ratio of the wetted areas (with 143 water depth greater than zero) during Hurricane Harvey in a census tract to the total area of the 144 tract (the specific methodology for this approach is described in [36]). 145 Locations and types of medical facilities including nursing facilities, federally qualified 146 health centers, hospitals, rural health clinics, urgent care centers, and Harris County Health 147 System facilities were obtained from the Health Resources and Services Administration (HRSA) 148 query data explorer tool [37], Harris County Health System [38], and the Homeland 149 Infrastructure Foundation-Level Data (HIFLD) database [39]. The Microsoft Bing Maps 150 Platform APIs [40] was used to estimate the drive time from the centroid of each tract to all of 151 the available medical facilities nearby. ArcMap was used to extract the coordinates of both 152 origins (centroids) and destinations (medical facilities), and the minimum travel time in minutes 153 was then recorded for each tract in Microsoft Excel. 154 The underlying conditions that might affect the vulnerability to COVID-19 (arthritis, 155 asthma, high blood pressure (HBP), cancer (except skin cancer), high cholesterol, chronic kidney 156 and heart diseases, COPD, diabetes, poor physical and mental health, and stroke); as well as 157 census tracts in Harris County. Census tracts without data are clearly identified in all figures. 164 As noted before, ambient conditions such as temperature and humidity could affect the 165 spread of COVID-19; however, in this study, an ambient gradient in Harris County was 166 neglected as the spatial change over the County is expected to be minimal. Three indicators of air 167 database [42]. For ozone, the 8-hour average concentrations were calculated using IBM SPSS 170 (version 26) for all of the available monitoring stations (40) and compared with the 70 ppb 171 standard established by the United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). The number 172 of exceedances of the EPA standard for each monitoring station over the period of 2000-2019 173 was then calculated. Interpolation tools in ArcMap were used to convert the median measured 174 concentration for each station to a continuous raster to overcome the spatial sparsity in 175 measurements. The generated raster was then used to calculate the concentration of ozone for 176 each census tract using the zonal statistics tool in ArcMap. One particular station (695: UH 177 Moody Tower) was removed from the ozone calculation due to its extremely low temporal 178 resolution compared to the other stations. Similar approaches were taken for NO 2 (hourly 179 measurements for 21 stations with 100 ppm standard) and PM 2.5 (averaged daily data for 12 180 Environmental releases from various sources to air, water, soils in Harris County were 182 obtained from the United States Coast Guard National Response Center database [43]. The total 183 number of emissions, pollution spills, or contaminant discharge events that occurred during the 184 period between 2000 and 2020 for each zip code was extracted from the database by combining 185 different years, filtering the actual events for Harris County, and removing redundant data points. 186 The spatial join tool in ArcMap was used to convert the total number of events in each zip code 187 to a summed total number of events for each census tract. The resulting value was added to the 188 number of leaking petroleum storage tanks (underground and aboveground tanks) reported by the 189 Texas Commission on Environmental Quality (TCEQ) [44] in the tract. A hazardous sites 190 shapefile was developed by merging two databases: the EPA Superfund Enterprise Management 191 System database [45], and the Texas Commission on Environmental Quality (TCEQ) GIS 192 database [44]. From the latter source, the locations of municipal solid waste sites/landfills were 193 acquired. The Near tool in Arcmap was used to calculate the distance between the centroid of 194 each census tract to the nearest aforementioned hazardous sites. A second environmental variable 195 was defined as the sum of the total number of dry cleaners, petroleum storage tanks (all 196 underground and aboveground tanks), and sites that are part of an Industrial and Hazardous 197 Waste Corrective Action (IHWCA) program located within each census tract; data for those was 198 obtained from [44].

The COVID-19 hospitalization rates for the two Trauma 272 Service areas Q and R (comprising the southeast region of Texas) are 7.86 and 9.84 per 100,000 273 persons [48]. It is noted that predicting the risk of infection, morbidity, and mortality rates in 274 Harris County requires a more extensive dataset and would involve considerable uncertainty due 275 to limited knowledge of the SARS-CoV-2 virus and the relatively limited number of tests that 276 have been administered thus far. In this study, the distribution of COVID-19 by sex and age was 277 the only metric considered for predicting the risk of hospitalization, morbidity, and mortality in 278 Harris County. This is mainly due to limited access to health information for individuals in the 279 County, such as comorbidities and the unknown effect of underlying medical or other lifestyle 280 conditions on the risk of infection and potential complications from COVID-19. 281 According to the data obtained from the New York Department of Health and Mental 282 Hygiene [49], the morbidity rates (using the reported number of cases) observed in New York 283 City (NYC) were 171.46, 1554.45, 2529.03, 2552.64, 2976.74, and 1687.8 per 100,000 284 All rights reserved.

            "text": "based on the age distribution (this is higher than the reported 82 deaths in Harris County as of 487 Limitations 489 A number of limitations are noted that should be considered when interpreting these 490 results. First, data was lacking for some of the variables for a number of census tracts in Harris 491 County; the CDC's 500 Cities dataset [41] is such an example. The analysis findings might 492 change if a Houston-specific dataset is used. However, the downside is that the approach would 493 not incorporate County level considerations. Second, and most important (this generally is true 494 of numerous other COVID-19 studies), granular sub-county data about COVID-19 cases, 495hospitalizations, and deaths are lacking (at the zip code or census tract levels). It would be 496 essential to have such granularity to validate/compare projections based on determinants against 497 actual morbidities and mortalities. Using morbidity, hospitalization, and mortality rates reported 498 in other regions places undue levels of uncertainty in the findings that would be substantially 499 reduced when such data are available, or a national surveillance system [60] is in place. 500In this novel project, we develop a planning tool that can help identify populations at 502 higher risk of infection, morbidity, and mortality from COVID-19 at the census tract level. These 503 findings can guide the allocation of scarce resources, and thus, are relevant to policymakers at all 504 levels of government. Effectively using the results from the planning tool to inform actions could 505 mean the difference between suppressing the virus and allowing it to re-emerge. Studies, for 506 example, would be needed to validate projections and findings. However, to do so, sub-county 507 incidence, hospitalization, and mortality data describing COVID-19 cases in Harris County 508 would be needed. In comparison, it is noted that studies that map the geospatial spread of 509 coronavirus from Wuhan to neighboring communities are starting to emerge[59,60], and similar 510 efforts need to be launched in the US. The application of geospatial methods to case data, 511 enables significantly more rigor in understanding the confluence of various factors that jointly 512 increase vulnerabilities and reduce resilience to COVID-19 spread, impact, re-emergence in new 513 hot spots or on a seasonal basis. While geospatial indices exist [61,62], they are not tailored to 514 the unique features of this virus. Lastly, the findings from geospatial analyses such as this study 515 enable public health departments to efficiently and equitably allocate resources such as testing, 516 contact tracing, and medical interventions to areas in greatest need. 517Competing Interests 519The authors have no competing interests. 520This research was funded by the Hurricane Resilience Research Institute (HuRRI), an 522 interdisciplinary research institute at the University of Houston focused on resilience to natural 523 disasters and RAPID grant # 1759440 and grant # 1840607 from the National Science 524Foundation.
