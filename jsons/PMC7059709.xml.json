The first vaccine candidates were based on further research conducted by groups at the University of Queensland, Rochester University, the U.S. National Cancer Institute (NCI) and Georgetown University with contributions from other PROs such as the DKFZ [9\u201315]. These research groups then licensed their Intellectual Property (IP) to MedImmune, GlaxoSmithKline (GSK) and Merck, Sharpe & Dohme (MSD) for further development and clinical testing for efficacy and safety. Except for the licenses acquired from the NCI, these were all exclusive licenses, allowing the licensee to exclude others from making, marketing or selling the patented material MedImmune and GSK later formed a vaccines alliance and shared their IP with each other. In 1997, the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office initiated patent interference proceedings between research groups in Queensland, Rochester, the NCI and Georgetown. As part of the dispute settlement the non-exclusive licenses provided by the NIH were turned into co-exclusive licenses in 2007. Both MSD and GSK had already cross-licensed their IP to each other, guaranteeing themselves unhindered access to the HPV vaccine technology and securing their market positions [16\u201318]. In 2006 and 2007, the European Medicines Agency approved two prophylactic HPV vaccines: Gardasil\u00ae (MSD) and Cervarix\u00ae (GSK).",

Recognizing the human right to the enjoyment of the highest attainable standard of health, the international community has committed to providing \u201caccess to affordable essential medicines and vaccines for all\u201d [20\u201323]. However, in 2014, only 1.2% of females 10\u201320 years of age in Africa and 1,1% of the same population in Asia had been fully immunized, despite accounting for 70% of all HPV-related cancer cases [24\u201326]. As of June 2018, only seven African and two South-East Asian countries have implemented national immunization programs for HPV [27], indicating that immunization coverage fails to meet global needs even 12 years after the first vaccines became available. The reluctance of country governments to include HPV in national immunization programs has been associated with the high price of the vaccines, especially for states in transition that do not qualify for support mechanisms such as GAVI [26, 28\u201330]. However, the production costs for HPV vaccines are estimated to be as low as 3 USD for affluent and 0.60 USD per dose for less affluent markets respectively [31], and by 2014, HPV vaccine sales had already amounted to a total of USD 14.1 billion, recouping the investment made by the pharmaceutical companies fivefold [32]. Prolonging the status quo, recent patent applications filed by GSK are likely to delay market entrance of cheaper generic products until 2020 [31, 33].",

While such formal transfer of intellectual property constitutes a relevant and easily targeted knowledge exchange mechanism, it is far from the only one [41, 42]. Bradley, Hayter and Link formulate a broader concept of technology transfer, which includes the traditional licensing pathway through the PRO\u2019s Technology Transfer Office (TTO) as well as informal transfer mechanisms such as collaborations and informal exchange of knowledge [43]. Exploring these less codified forms of communication and emphasizing the role of the originator scientist, Perkman et al. have proposed the concept of academic engagement, any \u201cknowledge related collaboration\u201d by scientists at PROs with private entities [44]. Both technology transfer and academic engagement are set within the broader framework of knowledge generation and diffusion, comprehensively and famously conceptualized in the Triple Helix. In this model, knowledge is exchanged across institutional boundaries through an overlay of formal and informal, explicit and implicit communications between the private, academic and government spheres [41\u201345]. To encompass all avenues of communication, the term \u2018knowledge exchange\u2019 will be adopted for this paper.",

The institutions in India we identified through our literature search were exclusively private companies, which were engaging with PROs from the U.S. and European clusters. We used a purposive sampling strategy, aiming for diversity with regards to the geographical region, kind of research collaboration, as well as gender and age of the scientist.

Often in contrast to these \u201cacademic channels\u201d [66], studies discussed the protection of IP through patents and the subsequent licensing of the protected technologies [65, 67, 74]. Two papers, in particular, explored the conflict between publishing and patenting knowledge [66, 67]. They concluded that peer-reviewed publications function as a signal to the academic community that research is scientifically valuable. Individual scientists, their institutions, as well as early-stage spin-off companies, tend to signal their academic legitimacy through publications. Patents, on the other hand, signal commercial value and are thus preferred by pharmaceutical and biotech companies as well as spin-offs that are already commercially exploiting their technology. A more recent study, however, found that patents and commercial success also translate into academic prestige, indicating a shift towards a more positive view of industrial engagement among the academic community [68]. It was also reported that some PROs provide financial incentives to scientists engaging in patenting and commercialization [68]. The only study from the African continent described that in Tanzania, public sector scientists avoided filing patents because the patent enforcement mechanisms were perceived to be too weak to adequately protect the IP disclosed in the patent application [76].",

These studies show that the knowledge exchange strategies used by networks vary with the network development stage. They often begin with informal, personal contacts initiated by scientists working at PROs, for example at conferences. Once a rapport is established, a formal framework is negotiated between the partners and with the involvement of the PRO\u2019s TTO. The further the network progresses, the more trust is established and contractual routines are relaxed. Informal transfer of implicit knowledge between the partners then becomes possible. During the more advanced stages of network development, patentable IP may be produced and transferred formally.

Nonetheless, as indicated above, participants believed that only exclusive licenses would provide enough security about return on investment to convince pharmaceutical companies to develop a technology. This suggests that they believe the promotion of access to the resulting product would necessarily lead to relevant losses of revenue.\u201cYou could have exclusive versus non [exclusive licenses], and some people, you know, won\u2019t deal with you unless they have an exclusive license because they want to protect their development process, too. So, it is a give and take on both sides and I think that it\u2019s usually, you know, it\u2019s a business decision.\u201d (Dr. Jones)",

Instead of licensing, the scientists may initiate spin-off companies, which are either established through the TTO or with the support of other funders.

In other medical fields, universities are increasingly exploring the implementation of public health-sensitive licensing practices [99, 100] and a set of global health sample clauses extracted from successful agreements can be found on the website of the Association of University Technology Managers [101]. Our results indicate a number of ways in which the implementation of public health-sensitive knowledge exchange strategies could be promoted. First, the scepticism regarding the implementation of public health-sensitive transfer practices among PRO scientists appeared to be based on an incomplete, industry-friendly understanding of the commercialization process. This suggests that education and training on drug development and transfer strategies may enable scientists to be more self-determined and informed when engaging with biomedical and pharmaceutical enterprises. Medical curricula, in particular, should include unbiased education on drug development. Second, institutional policies, or national legislation, should mandate public health-sensitive knowledge exchange in publicly funded research. This study also suggests additional avenues for promoting access to medicines that may be worth exploring. For example, informal exchanges, mature spin-offs looking to sell to a larger firm, or paid positions on advisory boards may be leveraged to promote access to medicines. This could possibly be achieved through institutional or regional standards of conduct for spin-offs or informal communications. Moreover, legal capacity building at the level of PRO TTOs could further strengthen the position and self-determination of PROs and individual scientists when engaging with private partners, whose legal presence appears to be perceived as overwhelming. Lastly, projects such as the University Report Card that monitor universities\u2019 global health practices and evaluate stewardship of IP, could promote transparency and commitment to these issues [102].",

There is also a risk of social desirability bias, which we aimed to minimize in the conduct of the interviews. The interviews were conducted in German and English, data thus had to be analysed across different languages and quotes had to be translated, possibly affecting the research results. In addition, most interview participants were male; the female perspective on the issues under study, therefore, remains underrepresented. We also chose to focus on the role of the inventor scientist and used a case study of successful commercialization. Building on our research, future studies should include TTO professionals and private actors; and include scientists with less experience in private engagement to triangulate different perspectives. Limitations of the systematic review include that the screening process could not be conducted in duplicate due to resource constraints.

We thus suggest that until a delinked model of medical research alleviates the conflict between public and private interests altogether, education of medical students and researchers on the processes, power relations, and financial realities of knowledge exchange and drug development, as well as improved institutional and legal backing, could be key in improving the success of public health-sensitive knowledge exchange strategies.",
