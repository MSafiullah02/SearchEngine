This propensity for interspecies transmission justifies close examination of members of this family. Porcine hemagglutinating encephalomyelitis virus (PHEV), the focus of this study, is a swine coronavirus in the genus Betacoronavirus and related to other Betacoronavirus 1 species, including bovine coronavirus (BCoV), human coronavirus OC43 (HCoV-OC43), equine coronavirus (ECoV), and canine respiratory coronavirus (CrCoV). PHEV-associated disease was first described in Canada in 1957 in nursery pigs exhibiting vomiting, anorexia, constipation, and severe progressive emaciation (9). PHEV can produce vomiting and wasting disease (VWD) and/or encephalomyelitis, with mortality rates reaching 100% in neonatal pigs. Both clinical forms may occur simultaneously within a herd during an outbreak (10). Clinical PHEV was subsequently reported in Belgium (11), China (12\u201314), Argentina (15), South Korea (16), and the United States (17). More recently (2015), PHEV was associated with a case of influenza-like respiratory disease in 2015 in show pigs at a county fair in Michigan (18).",

In contrast, information regarding the epidemiology or ecology of PHEV in contemporary farms is nearly entirely absent; even the seroprevalence of PHEV in most countries, including the United States, is unknown. To begin to address this shortfall, a serum IgG enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) based on the amino terminal portion (S1) of the PHEV spike protein was developed and evaluated under experimental conditions. Thereafter, the PHEV S1 ELISA was used to estimate the seroprevalence of PHEV in sow herds in the United States.",

Antibody testing is an accurate, efficient, and cost-effective method to collect population data, but laboratory throughput and antibody cross-reactivity between porcine coronavirus species can be problematic. Previous studies reported PHEV antibody detection by hemagglutination-based assays, virus neutralization (VN) tests, ELISA, and immunochromatographic-based tests (28\u201331), but their diagnostic performance under experimental or field conditions have not been assessed. Like all coronavirus, PHEV possesses four structural proteins: spike glycoprotein (S), nucleocapsid protein (N), small membrane protein (E), and transmembrane glycoprotein (M). In addition, similar to other Betacoronavirus 1 species, PHEV possesses a layer of envelope-associated glycoproteins (hemagglutinin-esterase) (2). With the exception of the intractable and well-documented cross-reactivity between TGEV and PRCV (32), serological differentiation among porcine coronaviruses can only been achieved by utilizing the S1 domain as the antigen in species-specific antibody tests (33). Therefore, in the present study, the PHEV S1 protein was used as antigenic target instead of more conserved proteins (S2 domain, N, and M), because it contains major antigenic determinants distinct from those of other coronaviruses. The PHEV recombinant S1 protein was expressed under native (soluble) conditions using a eukaryotic (mammalian) expression system to preserve essential conformation and/or glycosylation-dependent epitopes and then used in an indirect ELISA for IgG antibody detection in serum samples.",

Seroprevalence represents cumulative exposure to infection, and given the long duration of specific antibodies, it is less affected by seasonality or short-term fluctuations in transmissions than other parameters. This study confirms that PHEV is endemic in U.S. swine herds, with PHEV seroprevalence slightly higher in U.S. states with a higher pig density, i.e., Iowa, North Carolina, and Minnesota. The high seroprevalence of PHEV in sow farms juxtaposed with the general lack of reported clinical cases of VWD suggests a scenario in which clinical signs are either unrecognized and/or piglets are fully or partially protected against PHEV through lactogenic immunity. Further research is needed to better understand the ecology of PHEV in commercial swine herds and the role of lactogenic immunity in the protection of piglets against PHEV. Regardless, given their proven ability to mutate, recombine, and colonize new niches, maintaining a level awareness concerning the potential impact of porcine coronaviruses on animal health, public health, and the food supply would be prudent.",
