This contribution from Peter Keller's celebratory publication on the occasion of his 20th presidency of the International Association of Scientific Experts in Tourism (AIEST) picks up on this assumption and discusses the touristic development and enhancement of strategic pricing over the past ten years of Swiss tourism. In the first section of this paper, empirical evidence of the development of Swiss tourism over time and a discussion of its challenges are presented. The second section addresses the postulated value-based pricing concept, including practical examples from Swiss tourism over the past ten years. The third section offers a conclusion, which discusses the relevance of strategic pricing as a means to strengthen competitiveness with respect to future terms.",

Source: BFS, BAKBASEL in SECO 2013, p. 18 With three slumps in demand and two growth periods, a rough cyclical trend is visible during the considered time period. Peter Keller wrote his paper \"Strategic pricing policy as a chance for Swiss tourism\" (2003) during the second slump in demand, which was initiated by 9/11 and the SARS virus. Ten years later, Swiss tourism faced the third slump in demand, which mainly affected Alpine tourism to a severe degree. The financial and economic crisis of European countries has led to a massive reduction of incoming tourism from European countries as very important nearby markets for Swiss tourism. Reasons for this decline include the reduction of available income as well as the appreciation of the Swiss Franc, which led to a decrease in demand for Swiss tourism services.",

For the nearby markets, the number of overnight stays in a hotel accounted for 33% of the total demand in 2009 and for 27% in 2012. With this development in mind, the changing travel behaviour of the new growth markets compared to the nearby markets bears big consequences. Most notably, the touristic hotspots in Swiss cities and some destinations in the Alps are very popular for short visits with guests from the new growth markets. A one-week ski holiday in the Alps, how- Arrivals have increased by 25% since 1990, but the number of overnight stays in hotels decreased by 4% within the same time span. The consequence of these developments is a shorter duration of stay, also due to the trend towards short trips by Swiss guests and the strengthening of the Swiss cities as touristic destinations (BFS 2014/ BAKBASEL 2012a).",

The tourist vendors thereby hope to improve the customer relationship. An example might be a student rate for the mountain railways. Regional-related price differentiation: At the core of this price-setting strategy are geographically diverse market segments. The respective price therefore depends on the origin of the buyer. By specifying prices in the respective currency of the guests' countries of origin or by setting specific exchange rates, an alternative regional price differentiation can be achieved. In this way, price differentiation is less evident and therefore better accepted by all customers. Season-related price differentiation: The price with this price-setting strategy depends on the time of purchase or consumption. Seasonal prices for hotel rooms are a well-known example. Performance-related price differentiation: The final price is determined in consideration of the concept of customer needs. An illustrative example could be VIP tickets for cable railways, which guarantee the customer priority access and a parking lot next to the infrastructure. Quantity-related price differentiation: Here the focus lies on the willingness to pay. The price varies depending on the quantity demanded, as it is, for example, in the case of price deductions. Bundle-related price differentiation: With this price-setting strategy, one price is offered for a whole bundle of products. A price deduction for the cable railway after the second overnight stay in a hotel is an example illustrating this strategy.",

            "text": "In December 2013 the Swiss Tourism Organization started a marketing campaign called \"Pay what you want\" to assess the willingness of customers to pay for a two-night stay. The guests could decide how much they wanted to pay for their second overnight stay. The intention behind the marketing campaign was to increase the occupancy rate before Christmas time and to try out an innovative pricing-model, which in this case was a special form of individual-related price differentiation (Schweiz Tourismus 2013; Tagesanzeiger 15.02.14) . A form of regional price differentiation is applied in the destination of Gr\u00e4chen, which offers a fixed exchange rate of 1.35 CHF/EUR instead of 1.20 CHF/EUR. With this price differentiation, guests from countries utilising the Euro should be attracted by an especially low-priced offer (Gr\u00e4chen 2013). Price differentiation in a seasonal sense is already well established in the hotel industry due to seasonality, weekday rates, duration of stay and room categories. Hotel guests as well as flight passengers are very used to seasonal price differentiation (Michel/Pf\u00e4ffli 2009, S. 30 ). An example of performance-related price differentiation is the VIP-ticket offered for the mountain railway in the destination of Flims/Laax (Flims Laax 2014) . Swiss hotels also try to have some sort of price differentiation by offering quantity discounts and packages, for example an offer of \"4 nights stay and 3 nights pay\" during the off-season. Actions such as selling ski passes to hotel guests at the low price of CHF 25 from the second overnight stay onward, which was done in the destination of Engadin, can be cited as an example of bundle-related price differentiation (Engadin -St.Moritz 2014).",

Today's booking platforms possess market power as best-price sellers and benchmarking instruments. Price differentiation has become more and more difficult under this restriction, even though booking platforms in the EU are no longer able to claim the best-price guarantee in contractual agreements with the hotel industry. This frequently used practice is now prohibited because it leads to distortions of competition (htr 20.12. 2013). The application of a strategic pricing policy on a destination level is limited due to a wide variety of booking channels. Managing each booking channel is very timeconsuming for a touristic supplier.",

Thus, innovative and qualitative touristic products are a precondition for successful Swiss tourism at a given price level. However, the relevance of human capital for tourism as a service industry has to be highlighted. Peter Keller has already pointed to the problem of touristic jobs with respect to their attractiveness (Keller 1996) . Nevertheless, for Swiss tourism, a high quality of service, well-educated employees as well as stable framework conditions are essential to be successful in the future.",
