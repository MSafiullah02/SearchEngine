Today, however, boundaries of (Organic) Chemistry and Biology have been blurred as knowledge and techniques are quickly interchanged and adopted. Natural Product Chemists analyze newly sequenced genomes for clues to previously undiscovered bioactive molecules or biosynthetic pathways. Biologists identify molecules, which regulate signaling events, during cell development and control interactions among species. Synthetic Organic Chemists rely on biological assays to guide the design of molecules to be used as ligands tightly binding to enzymes and protein receptors. Various techniques of Physical Organic Chemistry and Molecular Biology are applied to enzymes and other biomolecules to gain some understanding of their structures, functions and mechanisms of action at levels earlier accessible only to small molecules.1\n",

It is found in rearrangement reactions, protein functions, enzyme reactions or across proton channels and pumps. Many experimental and theoretical reports, as well as book chapters and reviews, have been devoted to PT along H\u2010bonds.47 Tunneling (a quantum effect of going through and not over an energy reaction barrier),[48] transport in water molecules[49] or hopping (or \u201chop\u2010turn\u201d or Grotthuss mechanism)[50] are the currently accepted proton relay modes. Interestingly, examples of PT, occurring without engaging H\u2010bonds, have recently been encountered.51 Investigations have also focused on PT processes in the excited state (ESIPT).52, 53\n",
