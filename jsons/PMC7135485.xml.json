However, the four patients identified as having non-pneumonic SARS were among a group of 33 positive by the authors' ELISA, of whom 26 were also positive by nucleocapsid western blot. Thus, 22 samples turned out to be positive for antibodies against SARS virus nucleocapsid protein, but negative for antibodies against SARS virus spike protein.",

            "text": "This high rate of false-positive samples, as the authors qualified them, is difficult to explain because serum samples from patients with OC43 and 229E human coronavirus infections are not cross-reactive with SARS virus.2 Therefore, since SARS-virus structural proteins have shown close sequence identity with those of other viruses, how can the authors be so conclusive with regard to samples that are double-positive by spike and nucleocapsid western blots? Is a second antigen really sufficient to draw such a conclusion, or could it be that spike western blot also led to some false-positive results? The large number of serum samples from non-pneumonic patients that were reactive with SARS virus nucleocapsid protein sheds doubt on the ability of western blotting with SARS virus spike protein to identify truly positive samples, since no clear proof of its specificity over the corresponding blot with nucleocapsid protein has been provided.",
