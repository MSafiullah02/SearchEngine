A child born in 1900 had almost a 10% chance of dying between the ages of 1 and 4, often as a result of pneumonia or a diarrheal disease [2]. But with improvements in nutrition, housing, sanitation, hygiene, and the availability of safer food and water, the average life span increased tremendously. The discovery of antibiotics in the mid-twentieth century has also contributed to the increased estimated life span. With such phenomenal progress being made in combating illness, Surgeon General William H. Stewart informed the United States Congress in 1969 that it was time to \u201cclose the book on infectious diseases\u201d [3]. However, when declaring such a victory, he never could have predicted the increase in emerging, re-emerging, and antibiotic-resistant infectious diseases that were witnessed in the subsequent 30 years [4]. This has led to growing concern regarding new and re-emerging infectious diseases.",

At age 47, he observed that a mold, Penicillium, had inhibited the growth of bacteria, which led to the subsequent identification of penicillin [10]. This discovery was a tremendous advancement in public health. It gave the world a \u201cmiracle drug\u201d and spawned research that resulted in a vast array of other antibiotics [7]. The life expectancy in the United States and Western Europe had increased by at least 30 years in the last century due to such improvements in public health, one major reason being the use of antibiotics to treat childhood infections.",

However, even today, over one-third of the world's population is still exposed to M. tuberculosis, which in most cases gives rise to asymptomatic, latent TB [18].

But following these health successes, the public health systems of the world were dealt a harsh blow in the early 1980\u2019s, with the advent of AIDS [12], followed by an increase in multi-drug resistance tuberculosis (MDR-TB) and other drug-resistant infectious diseases. WHO reports approximately two million deaths due to TB worldwide each year, many of which could have been prevented with appropriate drugs. Moreover, there are an estimated 450,000 new cases of MDR-TB every year, which may be a conservative number due to inadequate surveillance [15]. Worse yet, WHO estimates that each person with MDR-TB infects up to 20 other people on the average during his or her lifetime.",

The emergence of XDR-TB is a prime example of the need for strong health systems to improve public health security, since the emergence of drug-resistant pathogens is essentially a man-made problem. According to the WHO, from January 2005 to March 2006, 221 cases of MDR-TB were identified at the district hospital in Tugela Ferry, Kwa Zulu-Natal Province, South Africa [26]. Many of these patients were found to also be infected with HIV.

One of the primary reasons for migration of populations is the urge to enter the cash economy, along with the international demand for both skilled and unskilled workers in a globalizing marketplace [2]. With the movement of populations, comes the movement of their microbial agents. The effects of deforestation, along with associated land use changes and human resettlement, have also contributed to changes in diseases like malaria and its vectors throughout the tropics [44]. Similarly, high-rise housing structures in Hong Kong, a direct effect of urbanization, were found to be hot spots for SARS infections and AIDS [45]. Air travel has shortened the time necessary to travel across the globe, besides increasing the number of environments to which all people are exposed. The globalization of the food market has also accentuated the movements of pathogens from one place to another. A prime example of this was an outbreak of cholera in the US that was traced to imported frozen coconut milk and alfalfa sprout seeds that had been contaminated with Salmonella\n[2].",

However, bacteria, by virtue of both their rapid growth rate such that favorable mutations become very rapidly selected, and their access to a wide range of genetic material through horizontal gene transfer, have developed resistance to all known classes and groups of antibiotic agents by a plethora of mechanisms [47]. A variety of reasons can be cited for abuse of antibiotics, but often antibiotics are prescribed before the causative agent of an infection has been properly identified, and therefore, the most appropriate medication is not prescribed.",

The frequency and geographical range of some plant and animal infectious diseases have reportedly changed over recent years, at least partly in response to climate change [54]. These changes are expected due to changes in the frequency or distribution of floods, heat waves, and droughts [53]. Other less direct effects of climate change are on the ecosystem as a whole, in addition to water and food supplies [55]. Studies on infectious diseases due to climate change have mainly focused on the El Ni\u00f1o/Southern Oscillation, the strongest variability in weather currently observed on earth. Climate changes due to El Ni\u00f1o have been found to be related to the incidence of malaria in South America, Rift valley fever in East Africa, Dengue fever in Thailand, hantavirus pulmonary syndrome in the southwestern United States, childhood diarrheal disease in Peru, and cholera in Bangladesh. Currently, the WHO estimates that climate change-induced risk of various health outcomes will double by the year 2030 based on the projected increase of greenhouse gases [56]. The geographic distribution of disease-propagating vectors will also change with warmer climates, as recently noted with the \u201cTiger mosquito\u201d, Aedes Albopictus. This mosquito transmits the Dengue and Chikungunya virus and is normally associated with tropical climates [57], but is now present in southern Europe, where an autochthonous case of Chikugunya has recently been documented [58], [59]. A northward expansion in Europe of the vector for bluetongue, Culicoides imicola, has also been noted [60].",
