After an initial draft 13 of the questionnaire designed, it was validated in 2 steps. Firstly, the study instrument was sent 14 to researchers and professionals from medical backgrounds (pharmacists and physicians) to give 15 their expert opinion with respect to its simplicity, relativity and importance. Secondly, a pilot16 study was conducted by selecting a small sample of health care professionals (n = 40) who gave 17 their opinions on making the questionnaire simpler and shorter. Participants from all healthcare 18 professions were selected for the pilot study. Reliability coefficient was calculated by using The questionnaire consisted of questions assessing demographics, information source, 1 knowledge, attitude, practice toward COVID-19 and perceived barriers to infection control 2 practice (Supplementary file 1). Demographic characteristics included were gender, age, 3 profession and experience, and one item regarding source of information about COVID-19. 4 Knowledge section comprised of 14 items and each question was responded as Yes, No and I 5 don't know. The correct answer was marked as 1 while wrong answer was marked as 0.

Of note that, 87.68% (n=363) HCPs utilized social media as main source of 17 information followed by radio & television (45.89%, n=190) and seniors/other colleagues 18 (42.51%, n=176) (Fig. 1, Supplementary file 1).

HCPs should consult reliable sources such as guidelines and reports published by important as in this global pandemic, there is also a pandemic of misinformation regarding 1 COVID-19; a serious concern might lead to xenophobia in the world as already warned by 2 scientists and WHO officials [6]. 3 Current findings of good knowledge (93.2%, n=386) among HCPs is in line with findings of 4 Giao et al and Shi et al who reported that 88.4% and 89.51% participants respectively have 5 sufficient knowledge regarding COVID-19 [8].

Despite of a prioritized global 14 health emergency and availability of easily accessible sources provided by both national(NIH,   15    Islamabad)) and international (WHO) healthcare authorities, these findings have shown 16 knowledge gap among HCPs[6].17Interestingly, Chi-square analysis revealed, pharmacists (94.7%, n=179) have higher knowledge 18 than physicians (93.3%, n=112), and nurses (90.5%, n=95) but results were insignificant 19 (P=0.383) (Table I). On contrary, Bhagavathula et al reported that physicians have higher 20 knowledge compared to pharmacists [6]. Possible speculation could be that there are disparities 21 of knowledge among HCPs. In addition to doctors, pharmacists also actively involved in seeking 22 information owing to their active role in improving treatment outcomes of COVID-19 patients. Findings demonstrated highly positive attitude (mean 8.43) of HCPs towards COVID-19. 1 Possible explanation is that good knowledge among HCPs might lead to positive attitude towards 2 COVID-19. This is also augmented by positive linear correlation between knowledge and 3 attitude found in present study. Giao et al and Bhagavathula et al also reported that majority of 4 HCPs have positive attitude towards COVID-19 [6,8]. Interestingly, participant's attitude didn't 5 differ statistically (P>0.05) by age, gender, experience and job. Giao et al also found that attitude 6 level regarding COVID-19 didn't have any association with age (P=0.151), gender (P=0.129), 7 and experience (P=0.453) but found statistically significant association with occupation/job [8]. 8 Of 414 participants, 88.7% (n=367) had positive practice (score=5-6) in following precautions to 9 avoid COVID-19 (",

On the other hand, 31.6% (n=131) and 36.7% (n=152) participants believed that not 19 wearing a mask, and no hand washing is not any barrier in infection control(Fig. 3,20 Supplementary file 1). These findings are important and should be addressed by Government and 21 policy makers to establish effective policies focusing aforementioned barriers to control infection 22 and ultimately spread of disease. Pearson correlation tests revealed a statistically significant positive linear correlation as follows: -practice (r = 0.174, p value = .004) (Table III, Supplementary file 1). This 3 correlation could be explained by Reasoned action theory. This theory states that a person's 4 intention to a specific behaviour is a function of their attitude towards that behaviour [10].
