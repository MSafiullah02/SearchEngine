            "text": "Respiratory infections have long been recognized as a worldwide health problem and a major cause of morbidity and mortality, with infants and young children especially susceptible.1, 2 Among these infections, community\u2010acquired pneumonia (CAP) is the predominant cause of childhood morbidity and mortality, causing nearly 1.2 million deaths each year in children <5 years old.3 In 2015, pneumonia killed 920 136 children under the age of 5 years, accounting for 15% of all deaths of children of this age group.4 Most of these deaths occur in developing countries. In China, there are an estimated 21.1 million new cases of pneumonia annually in children <5 years old.5 Globally, the incidence of pneumonia has probably decreased due to the introduction of pediatric pneumococcal vaccines and Haemophilus influenzae type b (Hib) conjugate vaccines over the past three decades, as well as the decreased rate of smoking in most countries.6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11 Respiratory viruses are the etiological agent in almost one\u2010third of CAP cases. Globally, it is estimated that 100 million cases of viral pneumonia occur annually.12 The known causative viral pathogens in childhood pneumonia reported are mainly seasonal influenza A and B viruses (IVA and IVB), respiratory syncytial viruses (RSV), parainfluenza viruses 1\u20103 (PIVs 1\u20103), adenovirus (ADV), and human rhinovirus (HRV).13, 14, 15 Advances in molecular detection techniques have facilitated the identification of several novel respiratory viruses, such as human metapneumovirus (HMPV), human bocavirus (HBoV), and human coronavirus.16, 17, 18, 19 More recently, Mycoplasma pneumoniae (M. pneumoniae) has been recognized as the pathogen responsible for mild to severe lower respiratory tract infections in older children.20 Several factors such as age, underlying disease, and environment have a substantial influence on epidemics and outbreaks of respiratory viruses and M. pneumoniae. However, although there have been several reports that pathogen distribution varies by season and location, data on the etiology and epidemiology of pneumonia in children in developing countries are still insufficient, particularly in China.",

Nucleic acid\u2010based detection methods such as polymerase chain reaction (PCR) are more sensitive than the antigen detection tests including immunochromatographic and immunofluorescence assays26; however, these are cost prohibitive in many clinical settings, particularly in developing nations, such as China. For the reasons of economic level, project funds limitation and difficulties in PCR procedure, DFA is routinely used in the study for the diagnosis of respiratory virus infections in our country. The advantages of DFA include a relatively low cost, rapid results (same\u2010day results can be obtained) and simultaneous detection of multiple viral pathogens.27 We utilized DFA that provides alternative a fairly reliable detection rate especially during the early phase of the disease.28 Using PCR method, a study done in KSA found that 63% of the samples were positive for viruses.29 Using DFA method, Albogami found a detection rate of 24%.30 In our study, viruses are identified in 33.5% of children presented with CAP. This difference in detection rates for viral pathogens might be attributed to different detection methods, study design, and geographic areas.",

The incidence of M. pneumoniae infection has ranged between 7% and 58.3% across different studies.31, 32 In this study, M. pneumoniae infection occurred predominantly in the fall and winter seasons, and the 2015 winter peak of M. pneumoniae overlapped with the ADV peak, particularly in September\u2010December. The annual incidence of hospitalization for CAP with single M. pneumoniae infection was 32.4 cases per 100 children <14 years of age. The rate of M. pneumoniae pneumonia hospitalization estimated from data from the second Affiliated Hospital of Dalian Medical University in 2012 was 12.2 cases per 100 children <14 years of age, which is lower than the rate for this study. This difference might be attributed to the year of analysis, differences in the populations studied, and the outbreak and prevalence of M. pneumoniae over a larger area. The prevalence of pneumonia with M. pneumoniae infection was 25.2% (378/1500) in hospitalized children aged 5 years or younger, while in children aged >5 years was 7.2% (108/1500), which is consistent with the report of Korppi et al33 that children aged <4 years had a higher hospitalization rate with community\u2010acquired M. pneumoniae than children >5 years of age (67% vs 4%). Most previous reports have indicated M. pneumoniae as having had a higher attribution in children >5 years of age with CAP, which is inconsistent with the results of the present study. This may be for the reason that the quantity of children <5 years was more than children >5 years of age (1169 vs 331) in enrolled 1500 cases. According to the age gradation, the pneumonia with M. pneumoniae infection in hospitalized children aged >5 years was 32.6% (108/331), higher than the children aged 5 years or younger (32.3%, 378/1169) (Figure 3).",

Second, owing to the weak diagnostic techniques, we did not include CAP patients with bacterial infection who needed bacterial culture, which restrained the research of pathogen spectrum. Third, the detection of viral pathogens with the use of nasopharyngeal swabs could have represented infection limited to the upper respiratory tract; no attempt was made to collect samples from the lung by transthoracic needle aspiration considering the difficulty in obtaining appropriate lower respiratory tract specimens from children. In addition, only hospitalized children with CAP were studied and a study on outpatients might have given different results. Finally, although our multicenter study allowed for the investigation of diverse populations with standardized procedures, our findings may not be representative of the entire Chinese pediatric population and may not be generalizable to other settings.",

Despite advances in microbiological diagnostic tests and prevention measures, pneumonia remains the main cause of death globally from infectious disease in children <5 years old. This study systematically investigated the frequency of nine respiratory etiologies of CAP in children ranging in age from 6 months to 14 years at a multicenter level. M. pneumoniae, RSV, and ADV were the most commonly detected causative agents identified. Effective antiviral vaccines or treatments, particularly for RSV and influenza virus infection, could have a mitigating effect on pneumonia in children.
