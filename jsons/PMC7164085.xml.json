            "text": "Coronavirus N proteins are phosphoproteins [30, 32]. The N protein of all coronaviruses, including the SARS\u2010CoV, contains an RS\u2010rich motif (Fig. 1) that likely provides potential phosphorylation sites for multiple cellular kinases [32]. We predicted that N proteins, due to their similarity with cellular SR proteins in the RS\u2010rich motif, may serve as a substrate of SR protein specific kinases. To study phosphorylation of SARS\u2010CoV N protein RS domain, we overexpressed FLAG\u2010tagged N protein and the RS\u2010deleted mutant (N\u0394RS) in HEK293 cells. Transfected cells were incubated with [32P]orthophosphate for labeling. Anti\u2010FLAG immunoprecipitation of the full\u2010length N protein from the cell lysate revealed a 32P\u2010labeled band at approximately 52 kDa (Fig. 2A, lane 1), similar to previous reports [42], indicating that the SARS\u2010CoV N protein was phosphorylated in vivo. However, inefficient labeling of N\u0394RS (Fig. 2A, lane 2) suggested that the RS motif is the major phosphorylation site for the SARS\u2010CoV N protein in cells. We next examined whether the SR protein kinase SRPK1 can phosphorylate the N protein within its RS\u2010rich motif. Full\u2010length N and N\u0394RS were each fused to glutathione S\u2010transferase (GST) and subjected to in vitro phosphorylation using purified SRPK1. Figure 2B shows that only full\u2010length N protein was phosphorylated by SRPK1. However, neither another SR protein kinase, Clk1, nor protein kinase A was able to phosphorylate the N protein in vitro (see supplementary Fig. S1). To avoid the possibility that inefficient phosphorylation of N\u0394RS resulted from its improper folding, recombinant GST\u2010N\u0394RS protein was analyzed by CD spectroscopy. The CD spectrum of purified N\u0394RS suggested that this truncated protein still adopted an ordered conformation (Fig. 2C) and was also similar to that of the full\u2010length N protein (data not shown). Taken together, these data suggest that the RS\u2010rich region of the SARS\u2010CoV N protein is possibly phosphorylated by SRPK1.",

To determine which serines might be the major phosphorylation sites, we made a series of serine to alanine substitution mutants and investigated their phosphorylation using SRPK1. As shown in Fig. 2D, increasing the number of alanine substitution gradually decreased the phosphorylation level of the N protein. This result indicated that multiple serines are phosphorylated, and was consistent with the observations made for other SR proteins [43]. However, because N\u20108A was much poorly phosphorylated compared to N\u20106A (Fig. 2D, lanes 3 and 4), S203S204 might serve as the primary site of SRPK1\u2010mediated phosphorylation.",

Coronavirus N proteins are primarily distributed throughout the cytoplasm, with a higher concentration within nucleoli [21, 35, 39] and, thus, have the potential to interfere with ribosome biogenesis or translation in host cells. To test whether the SARS\u2010CoV N protein plays a role in translation control and whether phosphorylation modulates its activity, we performed an in vitro translation assay. Using a firefly luciferase reporter, we titrated recombinant GST\u2010N or GST\u2010N\u0394RS protein into the reticulocyte lysate. Both the protein level and activity of the luciferase were measured, which may directly reflect the translation activity because luciferase mRNA levels were similar between treatments (Fig. 3, bottom). The GST\u2010N protein suppressed luciferase translation in a dose\u2010dependent manner but this translation suppressive effect was attenuated upon phosphorylation by SRPK1 (Fig. 3). GST\u2010N\u0394RS or GST control had no significant effects on translation of the luciferase mRNA. Therefore, the SARS\u2010CoV N protein might possess translation suppression activity that requires its RS motif and, thus, could be modulated by phosphorylation.",

His\u2010tagged N protein was used to avoid dimerization caused by GST. Recombinant His\u2010N protein was subjected to in vitro phosphorylation by SRPK1. Figure 4A shows that His\u2010N was 32P\u2010labeled after phosphorylation and protein phosphatase treatment removed 32P phosphates (Fig. 4A, lanes 2 and 3). Moreover, phosphorylation resulted in slight mobility shift of the N protein (lane 2), possibly indicating its stoichiometric phosphorylation. Next, electrophoretic mobility shift assay showed that nonphosphorylated His\u2010N bound an approximately 110 nucleotide RNA probe with an apparent dissociation constant of 52.9 nm, comparable to that reported previously [45, 46]. Moreover, His\u2010N appeared to form oligomers in a concentration\u2010dependent manner (Fig. 4B,C). The phosphorylated N protein also bound this RNA probe and its dissociation constant was determined to be 66.7 nm, which was similar to that of nonphosphorylated N protein (Fig. 4C). However, formation of high\u2010order N protein RNP complexes appeared to be impaired when the N protein was phosphorylated (Fig. 4D). Chemical crosslinking of the N protein confirmed that phosphorylated N was less capable of forming oligomers than the nonphosphorylated one (Fig. 4E). Therefore, it is likely that phosphorylation of the RS motif interferes with oligomerization of the N protein.",

Both mutants showed a higher tendency towards SG localization than the wild\u2010type N (Fig. 5A), suggesting that SG localization of the N protein primarily resulted from its hypophosphorylation. Moreover, the N\u2010terminal (NNT) but not the C\u2010terminal (NCT) part of the N protein appeared to be responsible for granule localization (Fig. 5A). We apparently reasoned that the N\u2010terminal domain contains the RS motif and confers RNA binding ability [10, 22] and is therefore capable of forming granules. Next, we evaluated SRPK1\u2010mediated RS motif phosphorylation in modulating SG localization or retention of the N protein. FLAG\u2010tagged N protein and HA\u2010tagged SRPK1 were transiently coexpressed in HeLa cells. In the presence of overexpressed SRPK1, the N protein was unable to localize to SGs, even after arsenite treatment of the cells (Fig. 6, white arrows). However, SRPK1 overexpression could not disperse RS deletion or alanine substitution mutants to the cytoplasm (N\u0394RS and N\u201014A; Fig. 6). Under this condition, PABP1, similar to N\u0394RS and N\u201014A, showed a granular pattern (Fig. 6, lower panel), indicating that SG assembly is not disturbed by overexpression of SRPK1. Therefore, phosphorylation of the RS motif might diminish N protein oligomerization (Fig. 4) and thereby prevent its aggregation in SGs.",

            "text": "The RS domain is a characteristic feature of cellular pre\u2010mRNA splicing factors [27, 29]. Several viral proteins also contain various numbers of repeated RS dipeptides. The transactivator E2 protein of cutaneous papillomaviruses has a relatively long RS domain, which functions to recruit cellular splicing factors for cotranscriptional splicing regulation [47]. The core protein of hepatitis B virus (HBV) has an arginine\u2010rich domain at the C\u2010terminus that bears a few RS dipeptides. The HBV core protein can be phosphorylated by SRPK1 and SRPK2 [48]. Similar to the HBV core, coronavirus N proteins contain a short RS\u2010rich motif (Fig. 1) and the SARS\u2010CoV N protein might be phosphorylated by SRPK1 (Fig. 2). We have examined whether the SARS\u2010CoV N protein plays a role in pre\u2010mRNA splicing due to the presence of the RS motif but, so far, we do not have any evidence to support this hypothesis (data not shown). In the present study, we provide evidence that the SARS\u2010CoV N protein could suppress translation at least in vitro (Fig. 3). The potential role of the N protein in translation control might correlate with its localization in the cytoplasmic SGs (Fig. 5) and is also in line with recent reports that coronavirus infection could cause translational shut\u2010off in host cells and that the SARS\u2010CoV N protein may execute this activity via its interact with elongation factor 1\u03b1 [18, 44]. Although coronaviral N protein largely forms helical nucleocapsids with the viral RNA genome during infection [10], how it participates in translation control in host cells and whether it has any substrate specificity or functions under certain cellular conditions remain to be studied in the future.",

Our data show that multiple serine residues within the RS motif could be in vitro phosphorylated by SRPK1 (Fig. 2). The SARS\u2010CoV N protein is primarily distributed in the cytoplasm, coincident with the cellular localization of SRPK1. Coexpression of SRPK1 could modulate cellular localization of the N protein, suggesting that the N protein is a substrate of SRPK1 in cells (Fig. 6). Phosphorylation of the transmissible gastroenteritis virus N protein also occurs on a moderately conserved serine within the RS motif, although which kinases could phosphorylate this serine is as yet unknown [33]. In the present study, we provide evidence that SRPK1\u2010mediated RS motif phosphorylation influences the biochemical and biological activities of the SARS\u2010CoV N protein. First, the potential translation suppression activity of the SARS\u2010CoV N protein might be modulated by phosphorylation (Fig. 3). Moreover, phosphorylation may also impact on its oligomerization, cellular localization and perhaps RNP complex formation (4, 5, 6, 7). The questions of whether SRPK1 phosphorylates the SARS\u2010CoV N protein in cells particularly during viral infection and where this phosphorylation occurs remain to be answered.",

However, other evidence indicated that the RS motif interferes with SARS\u2010CoV N protein multimerization but this activity requires its C\u2010terminal domain [26]. Our data show that RS motif phosphorylation partially impaired N protein multimerization (Fig. 4). Perhaps such phosphorylation modulates the balance between N protein self\u2010association and dissociation, which thereby impacts on its cellular functions. Multimerization of the N protein is necessary for nucleocapsid formation and assembly of the viral particles [42]. Thus, whether phosphorylation of the RS motif in virions could modulate N protein function in encapsulation of genomic RNA remains to be investigated. Moreover, we observed that deletion of the RS motif greatly enhanced association of the SARS\u2010CoV N protein with cellular RNPs (Fig. 7). Perhaps RS motif phosphorylation prevents nonspecific binding of the N protein to cellular RNP complexes and thus aids viral genome packaging into capsids; this possibility also remains to be tested.",

Subsequently, viral nucleocapsids are transported to the budding sites in the Golgi region for viral particle formation. Although overexpressed, most coronavirus N proteins are located in the cytoplasm as well as in the nucleolus [34, 35]. Nevertheless, the SARS\u2010CoV N protein does not localize substantially to the nucleolus [36, 50], as also observed in the present study (Fig. 5). It has been proposed that the signals for nuclear and nucleolar targeting of the SARS\u2010CoV N protein are poorly accessible to the nuclear import machinery due to phosphorylation regulation or conformational constrains [36, 50]. Nevertheless, the present study has revealed for the first time that overexpressed SARS\u2010CoV N protein might localize to SGs in HeLa cells (Fig. 5). Such an SG localization pattern was enhanced by deletion or phosphorylation site mutations of the RS motif and was obvious in stress\u2010treated cells (Fig. 5). SGs contain mRNPs whose translation is temporarily blocked [40]. Therefore, the N protein may sequester cellular mRNPs in SGs and inhibit their translation, possibly during viral infection. Nevertheless, the evidence demonstrating that RS motif phosphorylation reduced oligomerization of the N protein and prevented its aggregation in SGs is likely to be in accordance with the attenuation of its translation suppression activity.",
