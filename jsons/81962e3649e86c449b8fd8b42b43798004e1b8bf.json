Others have similarly implicated ACE (angiotensin-converting enzyme) inhibitors. 2, 3 The underlying hypothesis is that these drugs facilitate massive infection by upregulating the ACE2 enzyme, which in its membrane-bound form is used by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-Cov-2) to enter pulmonary cells. Hypertension, coronary artery disease, and diabetes mellitus are associated with severe course in COVID-19. 4 Because ACE inhibitors/ARBs are often used to treat these conditions, the increased risk may be partly due to adverse drug effects.",

The database includes information concerning dispensed drugs to individual patients from the Swedish Prescribed Drug Register during 5 years preceding admittance.

We describe fraction of patients on ACE inhibitors, ARBs, and ACE inhibitors or ARBs in different strata, including sex, focus of infection, age category, and year of admittance. \u03c7 2 and Wilcoxon rank-sum tests were used to assess the distribution of age and 30-day mortality between ACE inhibitors and ARB users/nonusers in the various strata.",
