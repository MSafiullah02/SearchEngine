It is worth emphasizing that pulmonary function tests do not diagnose specific diseases. Different diseases cause different patterns of abnormalities in a battery of pulmonary function tests. These patterns allow us to quantify the severity of respiratory disease, which enables us to detect disease early and characterize the natural history and response to treatment. It is important to remember, however, that these conclusions are based on inferences, not specific proofs. The accuracy of our inferences depends on a complete knowledge of the physiologic basis of the functions tested, properly validated equipment, and appropriate protocols. The purpose of this chapter is to describe these pulmonary function tests, reviewing briefly their physiologic basis, their equipment and protocol requirements, and their clinical results.",

Arterial oxygen desaturation is a much better indicator of the probability of a high risk associated with a surgical procedure (e.g., the need for prolonged postoperative mechanical ventilation) than is spirometry.2\n4.Many government agencies (e.g., the Social Security Administration) require results of spirometry to quantify impairment in patients who claim disability caused by chronic bronchitis or emphysema, as well as pneumoconioses, pulmonary fibrosis, and other pulmonary disorders.5.Spirometric results, including peak flow rates, are extremely useful in assessing the effectiveness of treatment in asthmatic patients. These simple tests are equally valuable for quantifying the effects of treatment in patients with other forms of chronic airflow obstruction, as well as many forms of restrictive disorders.6.Spirometry can be very sensitive for evaluating progression of disease, especially if baseline values, or results obtained early in the course of the illness, are available for comparison. Variation in the range of normal is so large that changes in serial test results are much more sensitive than a single value for detecting abnormal function. For example, changes in forced vital capacity were found to be predictive of survival time in idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis.3\n7.Spirometry is an excellent screening test for detection of chronic airflow obstruction, localizing and grading a critical orifice in the central airways, but may also be useful in detecting restrictive disorders.\n",

The resulting curves permit the determination as to whether the subject has a normal ventilatory reserve or an abnormal pattern characteristic of obstructive, restrictive, or mixed ventilatory abnormalities. None of these patterns is specific, although most diseases cause a predictable type of ventilatory defect. Spirometry alone cannot establish a diagnosis of a specific disease, but it is sufficiently reproducible to be useful in following the course of many different diseases. In addition, the results of spirometry make it possible to estimate the degree of exercise limitation due to a ventilatory defect (e.g., maximal voluntary ventilation [MVV] can be predicted from the forced expiratory volume in 1 second [FEV1])4 and to identify the type of patient likely to develop ventilatory failure after pneumonectomy.5, 6\n",

Tests can be performed with a simple recording spirometer, which is inexpensive enough to be standard equipment in a physician's office or the diagnostic laboratory of a small clinic or hospital. Recommended criteria for acceptable performance standards for equipment have been published.7 Although normal values have been established in a spectrum of subjects of different sex, age, size, and ethnic background, few have been reported using the standards of the American Thoracic Society (ATS).8, 9, 10, 11 Many samples are deficient in older subjects.

The measurement incorporates the early, effort-dependent portion of the curve and enough of the midportion to make it reproducible and sensitive for clinical purposes. Forced expiratory volume (FEV) measurements taken at 0.5, 0.75, 2.0, and 3.0 seconds add little information to the FEV1 measurement. The forced expiratory volume exhaled in 6 seconds (FEV6) is useful, however, because it closely approximates FVC, has been shown to be a valid alternative to the conventional FEV1/FVC, and is easier for patients with severe airflow obstruction to attain.14 In addition, the end of the test is more clearly defined, permitting more reliable correspondence between measured and referenced values.15 Furthermore, as demonstrated by Swanney and associates,15 the degree of airflow obstruction, reflected in the FEV1/ FEV6 obtained from spirometry, can serve as an independent predictor of subsequent decline in lung function; it may therefore be used to detect smokers at higher risk for developing chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD).15\n",

When the FVC is decreased by an interstitial process or by chest wall restriction, and the airways are normal, the FEVt/FVC ratio is increased. (The FEVt/FVC ratio may also be increased in subjects who fail to make a maximal effort throughout the expiratory maneuver.) The absence of an increased ratio in patients in whom one would expect the ratio to be increased suggests the presence of concomitant airway obstruction. Absolute flow may be increased initially, probably because of outward traction of increased elastic forces on airway walls. However, because flow is volume dependent, it eventually decreases in restrictive disorders without airway obstruction, although precise quantification for the various types of pure restrictive disorders is not available. Examining exhaled volumes and flows as a percentage of predicted values may facilitate interpretation of the spirogram in patients with mixed ventilatory defects.",

Nevertheless, the ease of measuring peak flow with an inexpensive, small, portable device20 has made it a popular means of following the pattern of airflow obstruction on an ambulatory basis. For example, the test is used to monitor patients suspected of having occupational asthma and those who seem insensitive to the severity of bronchospasm. When a maximal effort is made, peak flow is largely a function of the caliber of large airways; it is also influenced by the transient flow caused by expulsion of air from compressed central airways. For these reasons, peak flow is abnormally decreased only in moderate to severe airway obstruction.",

These values are plotted on the two axes of an x-y recorder or computer monitor (Fig. 25-6\n). As summarized in Figure 25-1, analysis of these curves has contributed to the basic understanding of the mechanical events that limit maximal exhalation. Maximal flow clearly depends on lung volume: for every point on the lower two thirds of VC, a maximal flow exists that cannot be exceeded regardless of the effort exerted by the subject.

The flow-volume curve and FEV-time curve are mathematically interchangeable; either one can be derived graphically, or by computer analysis, from the other. This relationship can provide an internal check on the accuracy of the tests. Spirometric values can be computed from flow-volume curves.

When more than 50% of the VC has been exhaled, the curve then follows the usual flow-volume envelope to RV. In patients with stridor, particular attention should be paid to the configuration of the inspiratory portion as well as the expiratory portion of the flow-volume curve. Lesions located in the trachea within the thorax cause decreased airflow particularly during exhalation; during inhalation, the posterior tracheal membrane is pulled out by negative intrathoracic pressure, so increased effort increases airflow rates and the inspiratory limb of the flow-volume curve can appear normal. Conversely, tracheal lesions located outside of the thorax cause decreased airflow during inhalation; during inhalation, the tracheal membrane is sucked in and is usually associated with stridor. It is possible to estimate the diameter of a stenotic lesion by analysis of the flow-volume curve with an accuracy of \u00b11 mm (eFig. 25-1), but the length of the flow-limiting segment must be confirmed by computed tomography (CT) scan to plan surgical correction, if required. Because a critical orifice located at the thoracic outlet is not affected by pressure above or below the lesion, airflow is limited equally during both inhalation and exhalation.32 Similarly, if a lesion is fixed and not altered by surrounding pressures, whether intra- or extrathoracic, airflow should be limited equally during inhalation and exhalation.",

Abnormally decreased flows support the diagnosis of an obstructive ventilatory defect, suggesting that the decreased VC is due to an increased RV (as in asthma, chronic bronchitis, and emphysema). Normal values for airflow make an obstructive ventilatory defect unlikely and suggest that a decrease in VC may be due to a decreased TLC. Restrictive ventilatory defects (e.g., pulmonary fibrosis, resection of lung tissue) decrease VC by decreasing TLC. Thus the finding of decreased VC alone is inadequate and nonspecific to assess decreased ventilatory reserve. Performance of complete spirometry (i.e., FVC and its subdivisions as well as VC) adds clarification of the mechanism and the severity of a ventilatory defect. Measurement of RV provides convincing proof of the presence or absence of overinflation or underinflation of the lungs.",

Both methods use a physiologically inert gas that is poorly soluble in alveolar blood and lung tissues, and both are most often used to measure functional residual capacity (FRC), the volume of gas remaining in the lung at the end of a normal expiration. In the open-circuit method, all exhaled gas is collected while the subject inhales pure oxygen. By assuming values for the initial concentration of nitrogen in the lungs (alveolar nitrogen fraction varies slightly with the respiratory quotient but is assumed to be approximately 0.81) and, for the rate of nitrogen elimination from blood and tissues (about 30 mL/min), measurement of the total amount of nitrogen washed out from the lungs permits the calculation of the volume of nitrogen-containing gas present at the beginning of the maneuver (Fig. 25-9\n). In the closed-circuit helium dilution method (Fig. 25-10\n), the theory is similar. The subject rebreathes a gas mixture containing helium, a physiologically inert tracer gas, in a closed system until equilibration is achieved. If the volume and concentration of helium in the gas mixture rebreathed are known, measurement of the final equilibrium concentration of helium permits calculation of the volume of gas in the lungs at the start of the maneuver.",

If a pneumotachygraph is used to measure volume, attention must be paid to the effects of viscosity changes in the exhaled gas, because it contains a progressively decreasing concentration of nitrogen. The open-circuit method shares several disadvantages with the closed-circuit method: it does not measure the volume of gas in poor communication with the airways (e.g., lung bullae); it assumes that the volume at which the measurement was made corresponds to the end-expiratory point on the spirometry tracing used to calculate expiratory reserve volume and inspiratory capacity (needed for the computation of RV and TLC from the measured FRC); and it requires a long period of reequilibration with room air before the test can be repeated. Measuring spirometric volumes immediately before measuring FRC as a combined, continuous sequence can eliminate the assumption of a constant or reproducible end-expiratory volume. This can be achieved with appropriate valves connected to the mouthpiece, which are available in many commercial systems.",

The removal of carbon dioxide results in a constant fall in the volume of gas in the closed circuit, as oxygen is consumed and the subject produces carbon dioxide. An equivalent amount of oxygen is therefore introduced as an initial bolus or as a continuous flow. In either case, it is important that the subject be \u201cswitched into\u201d the system at the end-tidal point.

Although the lung volume calculated from the single-breath nitrogen washout test of distribution is reported rarely, the TLC calculated from measurement of Dl\nCO is used commonly in many pulmonary function laboratories.

By Boyle's law, pressure times the volume of the gas in the thorax is constant if its temperature remains constant (PV = P\u2032V\u2032). At end-expiration, alveolar pressure (Palv) equals atmospheric pressure (P) because there is no airflow; V (thoracic gas volume) is unknown (eFig. 25-5). Then, the airway is occluded and the subject makes small inspiratory and expiratory efforts against the occluded airway. During inspiratory efforts, the thorax enlarges (\u0394V) and decompresses intrathoracic gas, creating a new thoracic gas volume (V\u2032 = V + \u0394V) and a new pressure (P\u2032 = P + \u0394P). A pressure transducer between the subject's mouth and the occluded airway measures the new pressure (P\u2032). It is assumed that the mouth pressure (Pmouth) equals Palv during compressional changes while there is no airflow at the mouth, because pressure changes are equal throughout a static fluid system (Pascal's principle). Accordingly,(2)PV=P\u2032V\u2032=(P+\u0394P)(V+\u0394V)\n(3)0=P\u0394V+\u0394PV+\u0394P\u0394V\n(4)If \u0394P<<P, then \u0394P\u0394V\u22480\n(5)V=\u2212\u0394V\u0394PPwhere P equals atmospheric pressure minus water vapor pressure (in mm Hg), assuming that alveolar gas is saturated with water vapor at body temperature; \u0394V equals change in thoracic gas volume; and \u0394Pmouth equals change in Pmouth, which is equal to the change in alveolar pressure (\u0394Palv). Then the thoracic gas volume is calculated as follows:(6)V=\u2212\u0394V(mL)\u0394Palv(cm H2O)\u00d7(P\u221247 mm Hg)(1.36 cm H2O/mm Hg)If a closed plethysmograph is used, \u0394V is detected measuring increased plethysmographic pressure with a sensitive pressure transducer. If plethysmographic pressure is displayed on the x-axis and Pmouth Palv is displayed on the y-axis of an oscilloscope (Fig. 25-12\n), the slope of the line (\u03b1) can be measured during panting efforts against the closed airway:(7)V=(P\u221247 mm Hg)(1.36 cm H2O/mm Hg) \u00d7 box calibration(mL/cm)\u03b1\u00d7pressure calibration(cm H2O/cm)\n(8)V=970\u00d7box calibration\u03b1\u00d7pressure calibration\n",

At the start of inspiration, thoracic gas volume enlarges, and Palv (previously at atmospheric pressure) becomes subatmospheric throughout inspiration; thus alveolar gas occupies a larger volume. This decompression of thoracic gas is equivalent to adding a small volume of gas to the plethysmograph, so its pressure increases (as measured by a sensitive pressure transducer).

Thus the test may not be practical for the routine evaluation of patients with restrictive ventilatory defects but may be of great value in the assessment of various obstructive ventilatory defects, including those with isolated bullae or advanced emphysema, to determine whether patients will benefit from resection of nonfunctioning or very poorly functioning lung tissue.

To maintain a sustained inspiration at a volume of three fourths of TLC with the mouth and glottis open, the muscles of inspiration must maintain a pleural pressure of approximately 12 cm H2O below atmospheric pressure (Ppl = \u221212 cm H2O). Under conditions of no flow and pressures at the mouth, alveoli, and atmosphere are equal: Pl = 0 \u2212 (\u221212 cm H2O). If the muscles of inspiration relax, allowing the chest wall to recoil inward, Ppl rises from \u221212 to 0 cm H2O and Palv from 0 to +12 cm H2O at the instant before flow begins. This example illustrates two of the principles that underlie measurement of lung recoil: (1) the pressure required to expand a lung to any volume is equal to the recoil pressure at that volume, and (2) under conditions of no flow, with the glottis open, Palv and Pmouth are identical. It is easy to measure Pmouth; absolute lung volume can be measured by any of a variety of methods already discussed; and the change in volume can be measured easily with a spirometer.

Compliance therefore is usually reported as the slope of the curve at the point 0.5 L above FRC. However, when this convention is used, the value expressed for lung compliance is influenced by the determinants of FRC, rather than simply by the relationship between lung volume and distending pressure. Another value commonly calculated is the coefficient of retraction (lung elastic recoil pressure at TLC divided by TLC). Normal values are available for both compliance and the coefficient of retraction, although the great variability of these measurements limits their utility in individual patients. Because lung compliance is so dependent on lung volume (compliance can fall by 50% with resection of one lung, for example, even though the elastic properties of the remaining lung are unaltered), its variability can be somewhat reduced by correcting it for height, predicted TLC, or measured FRC.69\n",

From published data in normal lungs and in patients with emphysema, they calculated specific lung elastance (change in lung elastic recoil pressure to produce a given fractional change in lung volume) for normal and emphysematous lungs. They found that specific lung elastance and the change in specific elastance with lung elastic recoil were increased in patients with emphysema compared with normal subjects. They speculated that this finding probably represents two distinct abnormalities in the elastic properties of emphysematous lungs: (1) an increase in resting length of alveolar walls, accounting for hyperinflation (TLC); and (2) a decrease in extensibility of alveolar walls once they become stressed (specific lung elastance). Surprisingly, these studies found no correlation between either of these factors and FEV1. They concluded that the change in elastic properties of the lungs in emphysema does not appear to account for flow limitation in this disease. Furthermore, because of the decreased extensibility of emphysematous lungs, they also suggested that these emphysematous regions are not only poorly perfused but also poorly ventilated; therefore they speculated that emphysema per se may not seriously disturb ventilation-perfusion relationships.70f\n",

These authors attributed the decreased Dl\nCO to errors related to inhomogeneity of ventilation and increased physiologic dead space. They attributed the severe, fixed expiratory airflow limitation to intrinsic disease of the bronchioles. They speculated that bronchiolar obstruction caused dynamic hyperinflation and gas trapping, leading to chronic loss of lung elastic recoil through unknown mechanisms, despite the absence of macroscopic emphysema. Thus the combination of increased TLC plus spuriously reduced Dl\nCO may be mistaken for emphysema; in such cases high-resolution lung CT scanning may help to clarify the source of lung hyperinflation as resulting from bronchiolar disease.",

They suggested that this phenomenon develops because of expiratory flow limitation (i.e., inability to increase flow beyond a limit at a given lung volume). The phenomenon of expiratory flow limitation has been studied extensively in COPD patients both at rest and during exercise.85, 86 Flows observed during tidal breathing in COPD patients often exceed the maximal expiratory flow-volume envelope.84, 85 This pattern has been termed \u201cnegative-effort dependence\u201d and is attributed to abnormal compressibility or collapse of the airway walls; in this situation, tidal breathing involves less expiratory force, less collapse of highly collapsible airways, and slightly greater flow than seen with a maximal forced expiratory maneuver.",

Most reports indicate that TLC does not change with exercise,86, 87 but others have found that TLC does increase.88 In addition, this approach assumes that the patients can make a truly maximal inspiratory effort during exercise. In fact, some COPD patients are not able to perform these maneuvers during exercise.2.Maximal expiratory airflow depends on the volume and time history of the preceding inspiration.89, 90 However, the previous volume and time history always differ between tidal breathing and maximal inspiration. Therefore assessment of flow limitation by comparison of tidal and maximal flow-volume curves may lead to erroneous assumption of abnormal airway collapsibility, even if the measurements are made plethysmographically.3.In nearly all reports, the tidal and forced flow-volume loops were obtained from measurements of expired gas volume at the mouth. The assumption is made that both loops develop at the same lung volume when, in fact, the forced loop may be at a smaller volume due to gas compression during the forced maneuver. Such gas compression artifacts can be avoided by measuring volume with a body plethysmograph, as suggested by Ingram and Schilder.91\n4.Exercise may result in bronchodilation and other changes in the mechanical properties of the lungs, which may affect both the tidal and maximal flow-volume curves.86\n5.Evaluation of expiratory flow limitation has also been studied by comparison of tidal flow-volume curves with partial flow-volume curves, thereby keeping the previous volume history constant. Although theoretically appealing, this approach often neglects the effect of the previous time history (which affects both partial and maximal forced flow-volume curves)89, 92 and is not practical in most patients with COPD at rest, let alone during exercise.\n",

Typical results consist of a decreased VC, little or no reduction in expiratory airflow, and relative preservation of MVV. Early in the development of an interstitial lung disease, before development of decreased lung volumes, volume-corrected flow (i.e., flow divided by the total lung capacity, to account for lung size) and FEV1/FVC ratios are increased. These increased airflow rates result from the increased force causing outward traction on airway walls. Thus airway diameters become larger than normal relative to lung volume, so airflow rates are increased. Because of the increased flows relative to lung volume, the usual flow-volume curve in restrictive defects is tall and narrow (see Fig. 25-15). With time, as the disease becomes more severe, lung volumes decrease, as reflected by a decreased VC. If the disease can be reversed, volumes return to normal first, then volume-corrected flows, and then the FEV1/FVC ratio.98, 99, 100\n",

The subject inspires a single breath of pure oxygen from RV to TLC (inspiratory VC maneuver); nitrogen concentration at the mouth during exhalation is measured with a nitrogen analyzer or mass spectrometer. At end-inspiration, the dead space is filled with oxygen that has just been inspired (see eFig. 25-9). At the beginning of the subsequent expiratory VC maneuver, the nitrogen meter continues to record 0% nitrogen, because the first gas to leave the lungs is from conducting airways\u2014the so-called anatomic dead space (phase I) (see eFig. 25-9). Subsequently, the nitrogen concentration increases in a sigmoid curve upward and reflects mixing of gas from dead space and alveoli (phase II). The slightly sloping plateau in phase III reflects the almost constant nitrogen concentration in alveolar gas. If inspired oxygen is distributed evenly to all alveoli so each has the same nitrogen concentration, then phase III of the nitrogen tracing is almost horizontal (alveolar plateau). However, if inspired oxygen is distributed unevenly (as happens to a small extent even in healthy subjects), then the end-inspiratory nitrogen concentrations are not equal throughout the lung. The concentrations of exhaled nitrogen from different alveoli are not recorded as a horizontal line; the first portion of phase III usually contains a lower nitrogen concentration than the last portion.",

The single-breath nitrogen washout test has abnormal results in both restrictive and obstructive ventilatory defects. Presumably, this reflects its sensitivity to abnormalities in the mechanical properties of the lungs. Even though interstitial pulmonary fibrosis or emphysema may affect the lung diffusely, the process is never distributed homogeneously. Thus some regions of lung fill and empty more slowly than others, resulting in abnormal single-breath nitrogen test results. Why, then, is a test of distribution indicated in clinical evaluations? First, in mild disease, spirometry and clinical evidence may be equivocal, but tests of distribution may provide a more sensitive indicator of the presence of disease and the response to treatment. Second, not only is the test sensitive, but the degree of abnormality of the single-breath nitrogen washout test results is generally proportional to the amount of underlying lung disease. Third, the degree of abnormality of the test results may give an indication of the difficulties to be expected in gas exchange. When the closing volume (phase IV) is elevated above FRC, it is likely to be associated with atelectasis and hypoxia, particularly when narcotics or hypnotic drugs depress the drive to ventilation. Finally, in patients with suspected upper airway obstruction, a test of distribution of ventilation (e.g., single-breath nitrogen washout) may be the only way to assess whether there is associated disease of the airways distal to the carina.",

The \u201cend-tidal\u201d modification112 of the steady-state method does not require arterial blood samples but suffers from even more sources of error. Both approaches to the estimation of diffusing capacity really reflect ventilation-perfusion abnormalities in the lungs more than characteristics of the alveolar-capillary surface and functioning pulmonary capillaries. Marshall122 has reported another modification of this method, in which mixed venous Pco\n2 was computed by an equilibration method that avoids arterial puncture but may be too imprecise for use in the Filley equations (Equations 21 and 22) at rest.",

Rebreathing continues for 30 to 45 seconds at a controlled rate of 30 breaths/min (to ensure mixing between lung and reservoir). The volume of RV plus reservoir, multiplied by the change in carbon monoxide concentration, equals the carbon monoxide volume transferred. Mean capillary Pco is neglected. Mean alveolar Pco is calculated from the same equation used in the single-breath method. The rebreathing method for measuring Dl\nCO is more variable and requires considerable patient cooperation, but it is less influenced by abnormalities in distribution of ventilation and is easier to use during exercise than the steady-state or single-breath technique.

Distribution of ventilation-perfusion ratios is evaluated with six inert gases of varying solubility dissolved in saline and infused intravenously and concurrently at a constant rate. Under these circumstances in the steady state, the amount of any gas exchanging between alveoli and pulmonary capillary blood is identical to that exchanging between alveoli and atmosphere. For each compartment, the quantity of gas is a function of the ventilation-perfusion ratio and the blood-gas partition coefficient for the gas in question, expressed as a fraction of that in the mixed venous blood. For the lung as a whole, the mixed arterial concentration is a blood flow\u2013weighted mean of the values for several compartments, and the mean expired level is similarly a ventilation-weighted mean of the compartmental values. These parameters are measured directly, together with the cardiac output and the minute volume of ventilation. They are used to calculate the corresponding mixed venous and alveolar concentrations and then a distribution of ventilation-perfusion ratios that is compatible with the arterial and alveolar concentrations of all gases concurrently (eFigs. 25-17 and 25-18).",

Generally there is good agreement among the values obtained on unknown samples by the different instruments used by laboratories enrolled in quality-control programs (SD = 0.014 pH unit has been obtained in more than 800 laboratories).207 This remarkable accuracy depends on the integrity of the differential permeability of the glass membrane to hydrogen ions. The permeability may be altered by the deposition of protein or by the development of cracks on the membrane surface. Proper quality control requires that pH calibration be checked at one point before each series of pH determinations and at two major points every 4 hours. A number of standard phosphate buffer solutions are suitable for routine calibrations and are available commercially. Protein contamination of the membrane can be minimized by flushing the electrode with a cleaning solution at regular intervals (every 10 samples) and by taking care to follow injections of blood with injections of saline (not distilled water).",

Carbon dioxide was then selectively absorbed, and the change in volume permitted calculation of the content of the blood sample of the two gases. These tedious and technically demanding methods gave accurate values for the content of the two gases in blood. Determination of pressure required measurement of the content of the gases in plasma alone, after separating plasma from red blood cells in a closed system. Alternatively, back-calculation of pressure could be made by measurement of blood hemoglobin content combined with measurements and calculations of the quantities of the gases transported in the cells and proteins of blood.",

The principle of the oxygen electrode differs from that of the pH and Pco\n2 electrodes in that the oxygen electrode measures a current generated by the presence of the relevant molecule, rather than a potential difference. The device consists of platinum and silver electrodes placed in potassium chloride solutions, a polarizing voltage of 0.5 to 0.6 volt, and an electrolyte bridge to complete the circuit. Oxidation takes place at the silver electrode, where silver reacts with chloride ions to form silver chloride. This reaction produces electrons, which are consumed by the reduction of oxygen at the platinum electrode. The flow of electrons (current) is thus proportional to the concentration of oxygen at the platinum electrode (eFig. 25-21).",

The magnitude of the difference is usually 3% to 4%, depending on the electrode diameter, the nature and thickness of the membrane, and the flow of the sample around the electrode. A correction factor is sometimes introduced into the calculation of arterial Po\n2 when gases are used for calibration. These factors, however, may not be related linearly to Po\n2, resulting in errors when high oxygen pressures are measured, as in samples obtained from a patient to whom pure oxygen is given to estimate the magnitude of a right-to-left shunt. The simplest approach would seem to be calibration of the electrode with solutions, rather than gases. This is probably true, but large differences have been found for the same instrument using samples of different test solutions equilibrated to the same Po\n2.213 In general, the more the oxygen-carrying capacity of the solution approximates that of blood, the smaller is the error. Thus the large interinstrument variability of oxygen pressure values reported for blind samples tested in a quality-control program may not reflect the variability that would be achieved if all tests were run with blood equilibrated to the appropriate oxygen tensions. For a single machine, the range of repeated measurements of Po\n2 in blood is 3.0 mm Hg for Po\n2 values from 20 to 150 mm Hg.210 In normal seated adult subjects, the predicted arterial Po\n2 can be obtained from Mellemgaard's data197 with a SD around the regression line of approximately 6.0 mm Hg:\n",

Aneurysm formation, thrombosis with loss of radial arterial pulse, and permanent median nerve neuropathy caused by hematoma have all been reported as complications of brachial cannulation. On the other hand, the literature associated with left heart catheterization states that percutaneous cannulation of the brachial artery is as \u201csafe and effective\u201d as surgical cutdown and arteriotomy.216\n",

This degree of vasodilation is achieved by warming the skin to 42\u00b0 C. The increase in temperature causes local vasodilation and displaces the hemoglobin dissociation curve to the right. Thus the oxygen pressure is increased for any blood oxygen pressure, partially correcting for the losses of oxygen between the arterioles and the skin surface.",

Not surprisingly, transcutaneous Po\n2 most severely underestimates arterial Po\n2 when skin perfusion is decreased from hypotension. Arterial Po\n2 was also underestimated in infants treated with tolazoline for pulmonary hypertension, possibly because the general peripheral vasodilation caused by the drug exceeded the effect of the preferential local vasodilation intended from local heating of the skin. These problems have not prevented the application of this noninvasive device for regulating oxygen therapy or ventilatory assistance to infants with neonatal respiratory distress syndrome, for monitoring apnea, for sleep studies, or for analyzing the impact of nursery procedures on oxygenation. The technique is not as well accepted for estimating Po\n2 in adults, in whom the greater thickness of skin impairs oxygen diffusion. Carter and Banham236 reported that transcutaneous electrodes for measuring Po\n2 and Pco\n2 during exercise in adults with a variety of pulmonary disorders were reliable, provided the electrodes were kept at a slightly higher temperature (45\u00b0 C) and the work rate intervals were gradual to allow for the slow response time. Unfortunately, most other workers have failed to confirm these findings,237 although the technique appears reliable for measuring the direction of change in arterial Po\n2 in adult patients performing exercise238, 239 or during sleep studies.",

The measurement of carbon dioxide during the respiratory cycle is called capnometry, and the display of the analog waveform is called a capnogram (eFig. 25-24). This measurement can be made using an infrared spectrometer, which is widely available. Care must be taken to calibrate the instrument regularly and to avoid interference by nitrous oxide, acetylene, and carbon monoxide.240 A mass spectrometer can be used to measure all the respiratory gases (carbon dioxide, oxygen, and nitrogen) as well as many anesthetic gases. This device is very rapid but very expensive. It is used most commonly in pulmonary and exercise laboratories and in operating rooms where sample gases from several patients may be tested in sequence. Capnography is valuable in detecting successful tracheal intubation versus esophageal intubation and in monitoring cardiopulmonary resuscitation. Capnography is also useful in detecting a variety of problems in ventilated patients, including an obstructed endotracheal tube, a disconnected airway, ventilator malfunction, severe pulmonary hypoperfusion, and pulmonary embolism.241, 242, 243\n",

In these situations there is an increased difference between arterial and end-tidal carbon dioxide, and the end-tidal level does not plateau. When wasted ventilation is increased because of regional increased ventilation relative to perfusion (e.g., restrictive or obstructive ventilatory defects, parallel dead space, or pulmonary vascular obstruction), differences between arterial and end-tidal carbon dioxide are also increased. In these situations the alveolar plateau is present but abnormally reduced. The shape of the waveform may be diagnostic of pulmonary vascular obstruction (eFig. 25-26).",

In their study these criteria were not useful for distinguishing patients with asthma from those with other forms of chronic airway obstruction in a clinically defined population. Furthermore, when applied to a patient population, they resulted in selection of the most obstructed patients (a contradiction of the definition of reversibility). Instead, these authors suggested that the difference in FEV1 before and after bronchodilator administration (expressed either as an absolute value or as a percentage of predicted FEV1) appeared more appropriate as an expression of reversibility. Their study indicated that, when one compares results from two different bronchodilator studies, careful attention must be paid to the definitions of patient populations, the definitions of obstruction and reversibility, the degree of obstruction present, and the methods used to calculate bronchodilator response. Jain et al258 studied 321 physician-diagnosed asthmatic patients and found a significant proportion had increased RV and abnormal RV/TLC ratio in the presence of normal FEV1/FVC ratio and no significant bronchodilator response.",

Because many patients with asthma or other forms of airway disease do not respond initially to \u03b2-adrenergic agonists, particularly at low doses, it is worth considering evaluation of reversibility after administration of ipratropium bromide aerosol (36 \u00b5g). However, the maximal effect of ipratropium bromide may take 30 to 45 minutes. Furthermore, many patients with reversible airway obstruction do not respond to a standard clinical dose of either class of dilator, but airway obstruction still reverses completely if they are treated with larger doses. Thus, in some patients with airway obstruction who have never been treated before and who do not respond to a standard clinical dose of inhaled dilator, we often administer a cumulative dose-response protocol. Spirometry is measured before (baseline) and 15 minutes after administration of progressively increasing doses of albuterol (180 \u00b5g) or ipratropium bromide (36 \u00b5g) aerosol. The aerosol is administered every 15 minutes until a maximal increase in FEV1 or FVC is attained or limiting symptoms are reached. In this time interval, both agents produce at least 80% of their maximal response, and most patients respond maximally after receiving 8 to 10 puffs.",

Similarly, in a small number of patients suspected of having occupational asthma, specific challenge with agents found in the workplace may be useful in the diagnosis.

The response to mannitol is reduced by corticosteroid therapy and may disappear within 6 to 8 weeks. Thus mannitol responsiveness may be able to predict the risk for a clinical flare during reduction of the corticosteroid dose.

For example, in a patient with a localized bulla who is being considered for surgical resection of the lesion, it is important to show that the bulla, and not intrinsic airway disease or emphysema, is responsible for the pulmonary function abnormalities and disability. An exercise study can quantitate the disability caused by the bulla or associated disease. Physiologic studies relating Raw and  to static Pl can differentiate the effects of loss of lung elastic recoil from those of intrinsic airway disease. Radioisotope perfusion lung scans, pulmonary angiograms, and thin-section CT scans can determine whether the vascular defects are localized (i.e., bullae) or diffuse (i.e., emphysema). These studies may also indicate whether the bulla is compressing normal lung tissue. This possibility can be confirmed by a shunt study to determine whether compression of normal lung tissue by the bulla is having a shuntlike effect on arterial Po\n2. Radioisotope ventilation lung scans also help determine whether the ventilatory defects are localized (i.e., bullae) or diffuse (i.e., emphysema). The single-breath Dl\nCO is useful for detecting decreased numbers of pulmonary capillaries, reflecting the presence of pulmonary emphysema. Measurement of \u201ctrapped gas\u201d by comparison of TLC measured by single-breath gas dilution and by body plethysmography should provide an estimate of the size of the bulla. This same multipronged approach may be useful for evaluating patients with advanced emphysema before consideration for possible surgical treatment (see later discussion).",

They extended their analysis from LVRS to previously published data on mechanical properties of the lungs in patients with alpha1-antitrypsin deficiency, COPD, and asthma. In each of these diseases, a major determinant of airflow limitation is the ratio of residual volume to total lung capacity (RV/TLC). Their analysis suggested that RV/TLC determines the improvement in pulmonary function following surgical treatment of emphysema. Regardless of the underlying disease, impaired airflow appears to be due to the mismatch between the size of the lung and the size of the chest wall; surgical resection of lung tissue improves the matching. Fessler and Permutt also suggested that their analysis can be used to guide patient selection for LVRS.",

            "text": "This analysis demonstrates that, regardless of the cause of increased RV (emphysema, increased airway closing pressure, or a normal lung contained in a chest wall that is too small), LVRS improves FEV1. The level of RV/TLC is of greater importance than the specific cause of the increased RV/TLC ratio. Furthermore, there is little difference in improvement in FEV1 whether the surgeon removes completely nonfunctional lung tissue or tissue with the same function as the lung left behind. The implications for selection criteria are straightforward: if increased FEV1 is the goal of LVRS, then the optimal candidates are those with the highest RV/TLC. Finally, the critical factor in comparing outcomes among patients, procedures, or centers is the amount of lung removed, which cannot be estimated accurately by weighing the resected specimens. Fessler and Permutt280 suggested that the best measurement of the fraction of lung resected may be derived from the ratio of residual volumes: 1 \u2212 RVA/RVB, where RVA is the residual volume before LVRS and RVB is the residual volume after LVRS. Several studies have examined the mechanisms responsible for improved function in these patients. Fessler and associates281 studied 78 patients and found that the results supported their model, as discussed previously; that is, RV/TLC is an important predictor of improvement in FVC because it reflects the mismatch in size between the hyperinflated lungs and the surrounding chest, and increased FVC is an important determinant of increased FEV1 after LVRS. Ingenito and associates282 performed an elegant study of 37 patients undergoing LVRS and found that increased FEV1 (increased by 28% \u00b1 44%) correlated closely with increase in maximal flow of 78% \u00b1 132%. The increased expiratory flow was largely due to increased lung recoil pressure, and FEV1 improved without changes in small airway conductance, airway closing pressure, or lung compliance. These results support the Fessler and Permutt concept that \u201cresizing of the lung to the chest wall\u201d is the primary mechanism by which LVRS improves function. In another study, Mineo and colleagues283 showed dramatic improvement in right heart function during exercise following LVRS; furthermore, the improvement in right ventricular ejection fraction during exercise correlated closely with the change in RV/TLC ratio, also supporting the Fessler and Permutt theory.",

They argued that an imbalance between hyperinflated lungs and a relatively small rib cage was primarily responsible for abnormal respiratory muscle function in patients with COPD; therefore reducing the volume of the lungs improves the match between the lungs and rib cage, and thereby the capacity of the respiratory muscles to generate pressure. They noted that most patients undergoing LVRS show improved expiratory flow and less hyperinflation and air trapping. These effects result from increased lung elastic recoil and better matching of lung and rib cage size, which also leads to decreased respiratory pressure required for tidal breathing and decreased cost of carbon dioxide removal. The mechanisms responsible for these benefits include improved alveolar ventilation, decreased operating lung volumes, decreased dynamic positive end-expiratory pressure, and decreased dynamic lung and chest wall stiffness. According to Laghi and Tobin, the surgery also improves the length-tension relationship of the respiratory muscles. They also noted improved coupling between inspiratory effort and output of the diaphragm, which correlated closely with improved 6-minute walk test results.",

In their cohort of 199 subjects with a mixed ventilatory defect, using the adjusted FEV1 percentage predicted, they classified 33% with severe or very severe obstruction, whereas, using the unadjusted FEV1 percentage predicted, they classified 76% in this category.296 They also showed that the correlation between the adjusted FEV1 percentage and RV/TLC was better than with the unadjusted FEV1percentage. Because this work has not been validated, there is no widespread consensus on its use in clinical practice; however, it is important for the clinician to be cognizant of the possibility of overestimating the severity of obstruction in a patient with a mixed physiologic defect.",

These studies should include exercise tests, especially when signs of pulmonary hypertension are absent and radiographic methods fail to demonstrate obstruction of large pulmonary arteries. In fact it is important to make the diagnosis of pulmonary vascular obstruction before the development of pulmonary hypertension if possible. Measurements of Vd/Vt may be normal at rest but increased during exercise, indicating ventilated but poorly perfused regions of lung. The diagnosis of pulmonary vascular obstruction may be made by Vd/Vt measurements during exercise provided that no  abnormalities exist as a result of restrictive or obstructive ventilatory defects. Pulmonary vascular obstruction may cause abnormalities in Vd/Vt\nonly during exercise, for several reasons. At rest, poorly perfused regions may be poorly ventilated; during exercise, ventilation may increase if deep breaths overcome smooth muscle constriction in peripheral airways.297 At rest, bronchial blood flow may maintain normal carbon dioxide output from a poorly perfused region; during exercise, the collateral blood flow may not be able to increase proportionately to ventilation. At rest, narrowed pulmonary arteries may perfuse poorly ventilated regions; with exercise, blood flow may fail to increase as much as the ventilation.",

It also increases the risk from anesthesia and surgical procedures, especially for procedures involving the upper abdomen and thorax. Obesity also complicates life for individuals with pulmonary disease because it increases the work of breathing. Obesity also increases the symptoms and adverse physiologic consequences of airway obstruction. Because of the increased extrathoracic mass, these patients are forced to breathe at low lung volumes, where airway diameters are decreased. The increased work of breathing at low lung volumes and reduced airway diameters interacts with the increased work of breathing due to increased extrathoracic mass. These factors are particularly troublesome, especially if the obese patient develops even mild airflow obstruction.301Obesity is also often associated with sleep disorders and impaired regulation of ventilation. In general, obesity limits exercise tolerance, and it makes physical conditioning more difficult to attain and maintain.

Colebatch and coworkers309 showed that the index of curvature in the exponential expression of lung elastic recoil (see \u201cLung Elastic Recoil\u201d section) increases with age. They concluded that this change was related to increased alveolar size. These findings were confirmed by Knudson and Kaltenborn,310 and morphologic studies have confirmed the increased alveolar dimensions. The effect of age on airflow rates depends on whether the data are based on cross-sectional studies or longitudinal studies. Burrows and associates311 found that the progressive decline in FVC and FEV1 did not begin until the middle 30s, and that the subsequent decline in FEV1/FVC was linear with age, independent of FVC, similar in men and women, and much less severe than that described in cross-sectional studies. Gelb and Zamel312 reported decreased maximal flows but no change in lung elastic recoil pressure or Raw with age, suggesting that airway collapsibility increased with age. More recently, Babb and Rodarte313 confirmed work by Janssens and coworkers,314 indicating that decreases in maximal expiratory airflow and in the minimum pressure needed to generate maximal flow in older subjects were due to decreased static lung elastic recoil compared with that in younger subjects. VC decreases with age, whereas RV and closing volume increase with age,315 suggesting that lung emptying is limited with increasing age because of airway closure (see earlier discussion).316 MVV decreases approximately 30% between 30 and 70 years of age, probably as a consequence of decreased maximal respiratory pressures, decreased distensibility of the total respiratory system, decreased lung elastic recoil, and impaired coordination of the respiratory muscles.",

Healthy persons can sustain respiratory patterns requiring 40% of Pdimax for long periods without fatigue. When a patient must increase the Pdi/Pdimax ratio to overcome a resistive load, endurance decreases in proportion to the resistive load (eFig. 25-27). Normal subjects can inspire with varying degrees of diaphragm and rib cage contraction. Thus Pdimax may be decreased because of marked recruitment of the rib cage during the test.

Their results were comparable to those obtained in other studies using transcutaneous phrenic stimulation. They were highly reproducible in all the subjects. EMG data provided evidence of bilateral maximal stimulation. CMS is a nonspecific method and may stimulate various nervous structures. Co-contraction of neck muscles, including the sternomastoid, was present, but its influence in the CMS-induced Pdi appeared minimal. The method appears to avoid the pain of transcutaneous phrenic stimulation and the potential danger of needle stimulation of the phrenic nerves. However, subsequent studies showed that CMS stimulated many muscles of the upper thoracic cage as well as the diaphragm.

When the EMG is analyzed over two limited frequency ranges (<50 Hz and >150 Hz), the power spectrum shifts to the low-frequency range as the diaphragm fatigues. This change precedes failure of contraction, and it therefore may be useful to predict decompensation of the respiratory muscles.

Acute hyperinflation (as in asthma) may cause a mechanical disadvantage of the diaphragm by shortening muscle fibers. In addition to changing muscle fiber length, hyperinflation also causes a mechanical disadvantage by changing the shape of the diaphragm.

The surface area of the dome also becomes smaller on the side of the graft compared with controls.329 This effect results from mediastinal displacement toward the graft, due to the lesser lung elastic recoil of the native (emphysematous) lung and greater lung elastic recoil of the graft. The disparity in elastic recoil may be increased if the graft is infected or undergoes rejection. It has also been suggested that mediastinal shift toward the graft may reflect dynamic hyperinflation of the native lung. Such dynamic hyperinflation seems unlikely because single-lung transplants do not show flow limitation during tidal breathing except during maximal exercise.330 Mediastinal displacement is usually counterbalanced by equal expansion of the rib cage on the side of the graft. Compensatory expansion of the rib cage on the graft side is not always sufficient to accommodate expansion of the contralateral hyperinflated lung.

Compared with healthy controls, transplant patients have shorter time to exhaustion, greater acidosis in quadriceps during knee-extension exercise, decreased type I fibers, and markedly decreased mitochondrial oxidative capacity.335, 336\n",

Although measurements of ABGs may be used to predict the likely oxygenation of pulmonary patients at altitude, more objective information may be obtained from a hypoxia-altitude simulation test. Berg and associates340 approached altitude simulation directly and studied patients with COPD [FEV1 0.97 L (\u00b131.3%)] in a hypobaric chamber to simulate a commercial jet aircraft cabin at the equivalent of 8000 feet altitude. When breathing supplemental oxygen by nasal cannula at 4 L/min, the mean arterial Po\n2 increased from 47.4 \u00b1 6.3 mm Hg to 82.3 \u00b1 14 mm Hg (n = 18). Supplementation of oxygen by 24% Venturi mask caused arterial Po\n2 at 8000 feet to increase by 12.7 \u00b1 3.8 mm Hg; a 28% Venturi mask caused arterial Po\n2 at 8000 feet to increase by 19.7 \u00b1 8.2 mm Hg. Compared with ground level, oxygen at 4 L/min (by nasal cannula) increased mean arterial Po\n2 by 9.9 \u00b1 12.6 mm Hg; 24% and 28% Venturi masks did not cause mean arterial Po\n2 to increase above ground-level values.

They found that resting arterial Po\n2 was much lower than predicted by an equation, and that arterial Po\n2 fell further with light exercise.

The findings from spirometry can provide clues that concomitant restriction is present; however, for assessment of restriction, lung volumes must be measured.\u25aaIn patients with reversible mild airway disease, the results of pulmonary function tests may be normal because the disease is dynamic and patients with mild airflow obstruction may spontaneously return to normal.\u25aaThe diffusing capacity measurement is used to determine defects of the alveolar-pulmonary capillary unit. A defect in the diffusing capacity alerts the physician that oxygen transfer, the alveolar-capillary membranes, and/or pulmonary capillaries may not be normal, and further evaluation of the underlying cause of this defect should be pursued.\u25aaMethacholine provocation testing is used to identify whether abnormal airway responsiveness is present.

Because of the resistances down the airways from alveolus to mouth, the Paw decreases to the point where Paw = Ppl (+20 cm H2O, which is called the equal pressure point [EPP] because Ppl = Paw). Between the alveolus and the EPP, the airways are not compressed, but distal to the EPP there is compression and airway narrowing, because Ppl exceeds the pressure within the airways.

Bottom, The subject makes a forced expiratory effort starting at the same volume as in the top and middle panels (Pl = Palv \u2212 Ppl = +16). In this instance, the expiratory effort is markedly increased, reflected by the increased Ppl (+50 cm H2O) and Palv (+66 cm H2O). However, the flow generated is still only 6.5 L/sec because the increased effort succeeds only in compressing the airways more, dissipating the increased driving pressure across the increased resistance offered by the more narrowed airways; thus flow is maximum for this particular lung volume.",
