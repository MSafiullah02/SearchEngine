Thus, measuring and what is more further analysis of energy efficiency and its prediction can be managed by monitoring the software development process. Before going deep into the software development process metrics let\u2019s define what is the measurement itself. The history of measurement can be divided into two generations. The first generation is the Personal Software Process (PSP) - self improvement process that helps developers to control, manage and improve the way they work. This method can be called as invasive as it requires the direct involvement of participants in the data collection process. Users of the-invasive method should create and print forms in which they log their effort, size and defect information. One obvious downside of this invasive approach is the high overhead cost it entails. The developers should often switch between development tasks and metrics collection tasks, which imposes a high cognitive burden to the developers while the second generation of measurements, non-invasive measurements, do not require manual intervention of the participants during metrics collection [4]. The main aim of the successful use of a non-invasive measurement system is to support the developers, the development process optimization and maintain the data privacy. Innometrics is one of the promising software development process data collection systems with automatic data collection and transfers to the server for further data analysis. It allows the developers and managers to be aware of the process strength and weaknesses based on the data from the developers performed. The crucial insights are visualized concerning the metrics and analysis. The benefits of such system can be counted as real-time process analysis on a daily basis, the system can be accustomed to different levels of company sizes and audits of the software development process and development itself can be monitored at the same time.",

It\u2019s a widely known and used framework that allowed to easily update our apps. As the two applications have been merged, there was no need to add the auto update functionality to the Innometrics Transfer. After implementing this functionality, the process of quickly iterating on versions became much quicker and it allows to become more agile when responding to user feedback [5, 6, 11, 16, 24]. Let us stress that the use of an open source application appears particularly suited as it enhances the reliability and the adoption of the system, as evidenced in several existing works [7, 9, 12].",
