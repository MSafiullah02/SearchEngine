The major structural proteins of coronavirus include phosphorylatednucleocapsid (N) protein, peplomeric spike (S) glycoprotein, and transmembrane or membrane (M) glycoprotein. Spike protein contributes to the distinctive peplomers on the viral surface and contains neutralizing and group-specific epitopes. Spike protein is highly variable among different coronaviruses while M and N proteins are more conserved among coronaviruses between different antigenic groups [2].",

In addition, bovine coronavirus (BCoV) was demonstrated to cause experimental enteric infection in turkey [9]. Therefore, close relationship between TCoV and BCoV was previously reported and TCoV was placed in an antigenic group as BCoV [10, 11]. Although the sequence data revealed divergence of S genes among TCoV, IBV, and BCoV [12\u201314], there is still a need to detect and differentiate them accurately and quickly. Polymerase chain reaction ( PCR) assay has been an important approach for detecting many veterinary important microorganisms with the distinct advantages of high sensitivity and specificity. This chapter describes a multiplex PCR assay to detect and differentiate TCoV, IBV, and BCoV in a single reaction [15].",

The sense primer N103F and antisense primer N102R common to both TCoV and IBV were designed according to the conserved regions of N gene sequences. This set of primers specified a 356-bp sequence corresponding to nucleotide position 445 to 801 of TCoV N gene. The sense primer S306F and antisense primer S306R specific to TCoV were designed according to the variable regions of S gene sequences among these viruses. This set of primers specified a 727-bp sequence corresponding to the nucleotide position 2019 to 2745 of TCoV S gene. The sense primer S3 and antisense primer S6 specific to BCoV were designed according to the variable regions of S gene sequences among these viruses. This set of primers specified a 568-bp sequence corresponding to the nucleotide position 1488 to 2055 of BCoV S gene.The suggested ratio of RNApure reagent to sample is 10:1. Excess amount of RNApure reagent has no negative impact. The lower ratio (5:1) in this step is intended to obtain higher concentration of viral RNA in the final supernatants. If the upper aqueous phase after centrifugation at step 5 is more than half of the total volume, there is not enough RNApure reagent added. The appropriate reagent amount may be adjusted. Chloroform is applied at 150 \u03bcl for every ml of lysate.The sample mixture with chloroform at this step can be stored at \u221270 \u00b0C or lower than \u221270 \u00b0C before proceeding to the next step.Optional: Invert the tube for 5\u201310 min for air-drying of RNA pellet is a helpful tip to completely remove any residual ethanol that may interfere with the following RT reaction.It is critical to make sure that the jellylike RNA pellet is completely dissolved into solution by repeat pipetting. The volume (50 \u03bcl) of DEPC-H2O may be adjusted according to RNA pellet size for appropriate RNA concentration. Concentration can be estimated by taking 1 \u03bcl of the RNA solution into 1 ml of water. Read at 260 nm. 1 OD260 = 40 \u03bcg. The RNA quality can be further examined by OD 260/280 and 260/230 ratio. The ratio of 260/280 about 2.0 is considered as pure for RNA, while 1.8 is considered pure for DNA. The expected 260/230 ratio is around 2.0 to 2.2 for pure nucleic acid. If the ratio is appreciably lower, it may indicate the presence of protein, phenol, or other contaminants with strong absorption near 280 or 230 nm. RNA should be stored at \u221270 \u00b0C or lower than \u221270 \u00b0C.The synthesized cDNA in the RT reaction can be stored at \u221220 \u00b0C or lower than \u221220 \u00b0C until used. RNase H digestion to remove the RNA templates from the cDNA:RNA hybrid molecule is optional. The RNase treatment may increase PCR sensitivity for long templates. The target products (356, 568, and 727 bp) of this multiplex PCR are not considered long. The benefit of this RNase digestion is likely limited.For routine practice in the laboratory for large number of samples, 25 \u03bcl reaction can be applied with reduced cost of reagents.Result interpretation:TCoV positive: two PCR products, a 356-bp band, and a 727-bp band.IBV positive: one PCR product of 356 bp.BCoV positive: one PCR product of 568 bp.Negative: no PCR product.One limitation of this multiplex PCR should be noted. When both TCoV and IBV are present in the sample, the IBV-positive PCR product at 356 bp is overlapping with one of the two TCoV PCR products. The result of two PCR product bands at 356 and 727 bp reflects a confirmed diagnosis of TCoV positive but does not rule out the presence of IBV. This concern is alleviated by tissue tropism of IBV. Turkey enteric infection by chicken respiratory IBV has never been reported. Accordingly, the presence of IBV in turkey intestines (the test sample) is not likely. Any such concern should be further evaluated by a separate PCR specific for IBV [16]. On the other hand, IBV-positive result is able to exclude the presence of TCoV.\nThe sensitivity of this multiplex PCR is 4.8 \u00d7 10\u22123 \u03bcg of TCoV RNA, 4.6 \u00d7 10\u22124 \u03bcg of IBV RNA, and 8.0 \u00d7 10\u22122 \u03bcg of BCoV RNA. The specificity had been evaluated against Newcastle disease virus, Marek\u2019s disease virus, turkey pox virus, pigeon pox virus, fowl pox virus, reovirus, infectious bursal disease virus, enterovirus, astrovirus, Salmonella enterica, Escherichia coli, and Mycoplasma gallisepticum with negative results that have no PCR products.\n",
