            "text": "The entry of two dengue virus (DENV) serotypes into Vero cells was analysed using biochemical inhibitors, dominant negative mutants of cellular proteins involved in endocytic pathways, fluorescence microscopy and infectivity determinations. By treatment with dansylcadaverine and chlorpromazine and overexpression of a dominant negative form of the Eps15 protein, a clathrin-mediated endocytosis for productive DENV-1 internalization into Vero cells was demonstrated whereas the infectious entry of DENV-2 in the same cell system was independent of clathrin. Treatment with the inhibitors nystatin and methyl-b-cyclodextrin, as well as transfection of Vero cells with dominant negative caveolin-1, had no effect on DENV-2 virus infection. It was also shown, by using the K44A mutant and the inhibitor dynasore, that dynamin was required for DENV-2 entry. Consequently, the infectious entry of DENV-2 into Vero cells occurs by a non-classical endocytic pathway independent of clathrin, caveolae and lipid rafts, but dependent on dynamin. By contrast, DENV-2 entry into A549 cells was clathrin-dependent, as previously reported in HeLa, C6/36 and BS-C-1 cells. Our results conclusively show, for the first time, a differential mode of infective entry for DENV-1 and DENV-2 into a common host cell, Vero cells, as well as alternative entry pathways for a given serotype, DENV-2, into different types of cells.",

            "text": "Dengue virus (DENV) is an enveloped, positive singlestranded RNA virus belonging to the genus Flavivirus, family Flaviviridae, responsible of the most prevalent arthropode-borne viral infection in humans. There are four antigenically related serotypes (DENV-1 to DENV-4), which cocirculate in tropical and subtropical regions around the world between their vectors, the mosquitoes Aedes aegypti and A. albopictus, and the vertebrate hosts. DENV human infection can be manifested either by the benign self-limited febrile illness called dengue fever (DF) or by the severe and potentially fatal disease named dengue haemorrhagic fever/dengue shock syndrome (DHF/DSS) (Gubler, 2002) . Primary infection induces protective immunity only against the infecting serotype, and secondary infection with other serotype appears to be one of the risk factors to develop DHF/DSS through an immunopathological process of antibody-dependent enhancement (ADE) (Kliks et al., 1989; Rothman, 2004) . The failure to maintain programmes for controlling the mosquito vector has caused the global re-emergence of this infection, turning DENV into a public health problem. Currently, it is estimated that the virus is endemic in more than 100 countries, producing about 50 million infections each year (Gubler, 2002) .",

            "text": "Despite the increasing incidence of DENV as a human pathogen, there are no antiviral agents or vaccines for treatment or prevention, and little is known about the DENV multiplication cycle. In particular, the initial steps leading to DENV entry into the host cells for primary infection are presently very poorly understood. The events involved in virus entry comprise virion binding to the cell surface receptors followed by internalization into the cytoplasm. The envelope E glycoprotein has been identified as the DENV protein involved in both attachment and internalization, representing a key determinant for infection. By contrast, the identity of the cellular receptor interacting with E glycoprotein is, at present, controversial. Several recent reports have implicated a long list of receptor candidate molecules, including a wide diversity of proteins and heparan sulfate proteoglycans (reviewed in Acosta et al., 2008a) . A probable reason for this complexity may be the ability of DENV to replicate in a wide spectrum of cells (Diamond et al., 2000) , suggesting the possibility of divergent receptors according to the type of host cell. A plausible mechanism emerging from these conflicting data is a multistep process consisting of the sequential interaction of E with at least two target molecules: an abundant attachment receptor to concentrate virus particles on the cell surface and facilitate the subsequent interaction with a high affinity second receptor of protein nature which mediates virus internalization. According to the cell type, heparan sulfate and the lectin DC-SIGN have been proposed as putative primary receptors (Mart\u00ednez- Barrag\u00e1n and del Angel, 2001; Lozach et al., 2005) .",

            "text": "Upon receptor binding, enveloped viruses exploit two main pathways for internalization of the nucleocapsid into the cytoplasm: membrane fusion at the cell surface (pH-independent) or within intracellular vesicles after endocytosis (pH-dependent) . Earlier studies showed by electron microscopy observation that DENV-2 penetrated directly into the cytoplasm of human monocytes, mosquito and BHK cells by fusion of the virion envelope with the plasma membrane at physiological pH (Hase et al., 1989; Lim and Ng, 1999) whereas the formation of low pH-induced syncytia in DENV-2 infected cells was also published (Randolph and Stollar, 1990) . More recent reports have provided evidence that uptake of DENV-2 virions in HeLa, mosquito C6/36, BHK-15, and BSC-1 cells occurs through receptor-mediated endocytosis, dependent on intravesicular low pH for membrane fusion activity (Krishnan et al., 2007; van der Schaar et al., 2007; Acosta et al., 2008b; Mosso et al., 2008) , similarly as it was observed for other members of Flavivirus (Mizutani et al., 2003; Nawa et al., 2003; Chu and Ng, 2004; Chu et al., 2006) .",

Additionally, there are no reports addressing the functional entry mechanism utilized by serotypes other than DENV-2. The clinical characteristics associated with the distinct serotypes cannot be precisely defined, but diverse epidemiological studies have reported that DENV-2 caused more severe disease than DENV-1 (Vaughn et al., 2000; Nisalak et al., 2003; Balmaseda et al., 2006) . Thus, the knowledge of the virus-cell interactions leading to successful infection for different DENV serotypes may help to understand their varying in vivo pathogenic profile.",

To this end, cells were infected and incubated at 4\u00b0C for 1 h to allow virus attachment. Then, cells were washed with PBS at 4\u00b0C and shifted at 37\u00b0C to permit internalization of the bound particles. At various times after the shift, a series of infected cultures were treated with proteinase K to remove adsorbed virus whereas internalized virus remained protected inside the cell; after inactivation of the enzyme, suspensions of infected cells were plated on Vero cell monolayers to quantify infectious internalized particles by plaque formation. Another series of cultures were treated with PBS after each time of temperature shift and a similar infectious centre assay was performed to quantify total cell-associated virus (membrane-bound and internalized virions). The percentage of PFU resistant to proteinase K treatment in comparison with control PBS treatment was calculated for each time point. As shown in Fig. 1A , at the beginning of the temperature shift, most DENV-2 particles were detached from cells by proteinase K, but when the time of incubation at 37\u00b0C increased virus became rapidly resistant. After 60-90 min of incubation, 88-94% of virus was resistant to proteinase K treatment in comparison to control treatment, indicating a successful internalization of infectious virions. A similar profile in time and amount of internalized virus into Vero cells determined by the infectious centre assay was obtained for DENV-1 (data not shown).",

Consequently, the kinetics and rate of virus internalization were tested in cells non-pre-incubated during 1 h at 4\u00b0C, a condition previously chosen to separate adsorption and internalization processes. Vero cells were infected with DENV, immediately incubated at 37\u00b0C, and at different times the amount of internalized virus particles was determined by proteinase K treatment and infectious centre assay as described above. The curve of virus internalization in these assay conditions was comparable to that obtained with 1 h of preincubation at 4\u00b0C (Fig. 1B) . A slight difference in the number of infectious internalized virus was initially detected, probably due to the lack of synchronization for penetration of pre-adsorbed virions. But, after 30 min at 37\u00b0C, the amount of proteinase K-resistant virus penetrated into the cell was similar for both assays. Thus, the effect of inhibitors on virus internalization was measured by protease treatment and infectious centre assay after 1 h of DENV infection at 37\u00b0C.",

Treatment of Vero cells with ammonium chloride and concanamycin A before infection and during the first hour of infection at 37\u00b0C significantly reduced the amount of internalized virus for both serotypes, with maximum effect at a concentration of 50 mM and 50 nM respectively ( Fig. 2A) . This low pH requirement was also assessed by inhibition of viral yield (Fig. S1A ) and viral antigen expression detected by immunofluorescence assay (Fig. 2B) . However, no inhibitory effect on virus multiplication was detected when ammonium chloride was added 1 h after infection, confirming that this compound effectively blocked an early event during the virus entry process (Fig. 2B) . Furthermore, no virucidal effect of ammonium chloride was detected when the virus was pre-incubated with the compound before infection (Fig. S1B ) neither virus adsorption was affected (Fig. S1C) . Similarly, lack of effect on virion inactivation and adsorption was detected with concanamycin A (data not shown). To ensure that the drug concentrations used effectively increased the pH of intracellular vesicles in Vero cells we performed acridine orange staining. Untreated cells showed the typical cytoplasmatic orange fluorescence of the acid compartments, A. Cells were treated with ammonium chloride or concanamycin A and infected with DENV-1 or DENV-2. After 1 h internalization in the presence of the drugs, extracellular virus was inactivated with proteinase K and the cell pellets were plated onto Vero cells to determine internalized virus by an infectious centre assay. Results are expressed as percentage of internalized virus with respect to a control without drug treatment. Each point shows the mean \u03ee SD of two independent experiments. B.

Additionally, the involvement of clathrin for DENV-2 entry to mosquito C6/36 cells (Acosta et al., 2008b; Mosso et al., 2008) , human HeLa cells (Krishnan et al., 2007) and BS-C-1 cells (van der Schaar et al., 2008) has been recently reported. To address the involvement of a clathrin-mediated pathway in DENV-1 and DENV-2 entry to Vero cells, we analysed the effects on virus infection of chlorpromazine and dansylcadaverine, two pharmacological inhibitors of this pathway (Chu et al., 2006; Leppert et al., 2007; Zheng et al., 2008) . A dose-dependent inhibition of DENV-1 internalization ( Fig. 3A ) and production at 48 h post-infection (p.i.) (Fig. 3B ) was obtained in Vero cells treated with both compounds during the first hour of infection, with a maximum reduction of virus internalization to 33% and 29% of control values at concentrations of 50 mM chlorpromazine and 500 mM dansylcadaverine respectively. Surprisingly, neither chlorpromazine nor dansylcadaverine treatment produced any inhibitory effect on DENV-2 infection ( Fig. 3A and B ). By the contrary, a significant increase in the number of DENV-2 internalized virions and PFU released from infected Vero cells was detected when clathrin-dependent endocytosis was blocked (values higher than 100% of control in Fig. 3A and B). The internalization of TRITC-labelled transferrin, a ligand known to enter into the cell by clathrin-mediated endocytosis, was used as a functional control assay to assess that the action of the inhibitors was effectively exerted on receptor-mediated endocytosis from clathrin-coated pits. In control cells a dotted fluorescence pattern inside the cell cytoplasm was observed, while cultures treated with chlorpromazine exhibited a widespread fluorescence only at the cell surface, indicating that transferrin uptake was efficiently arrested (Fig. 3C) . A similar staining pattern was observed after treatment with dansylcadaverine (data not shown). Consequently, results obtained with biochemical inhibitors suggest that DENV-1 entry to Vero cells occurs through clathrin-dependent endocytosis but DENV-2 would use another endocytic route.",

The dominant negative mutant of the clathrin coat-associated cellular protein Eps15 named EH29 specifically interferes with clathrin-coated pit assembly at the plasma membrane without affecting clathrin independent endocytic pathways (Benmerah et al., 1999) . Vero cells were transfected with GFP-tagged versions of the dominant negative mutant EH29 (GFP-EH29) and the control construct that does not affect clathrin-mediated uptake (GFP-DIIID2) (Benmerah et al., 1998) . Twenty-four hours post transfection, cells were infected with DENV-1 or DENV-2 for 1 h at 37\u00b0C and then processed to detect GFP expression and internalized viral antigen by indirect immunofluorescence staining. When Vero cells were transfected with the control construct GFP-DIIID2 both DENV-1 and DENV-2 virions were internalized in endocytic vesicles exhibiting a speckled virus antigen staining within the cytoplasm (Fig. 3D) . A similar pattern was observed in mutant GFP-EH29 transfected cells after DENV-2 infection, indicating that DENV-2 was capable of entering Vero cells when clathrin-mediated uptake was blocked (Fig. 3D) . In contrast, a slight and disperse red fluorescence at the cell surface, demonstrative of a blockade in virus entry, was detected in GFP-EH29 transfected and DENV-1-infected cells, providing additional strong evidence that DENV-1 internalization into Vero cells occurs Fig. 3 . Entry of DENV-1 into Vero cells requires clathrin-mediated endocytosis while entry of DENV-2 is clathrin-independent. A. Cells were treated with chlorpromazine or dansylcadaverine and infected with DENV-1 or DENV-2. After 1 h internalization in the presence of the drugs, monolayers were treated with proteinase K and the cell pellets were plated onto Vero cells to determine internalized virus by an infectious centre assay. B. Cells were treated as in (A) and infected with DENV-1 or DENV-2. Virus yields were quantified at 48 h p.i.

Expression of the dominant negative mutant did not significantly affect infection with DENV-2 as indicated by the similar signals for merge images in dominant and control transfected cells (Fig. 3E ). The data for the 24 h infection were quantified by scoring cells positive for viral antigen in 250 cells with comparable levels of transgene expression. The DENV-2-positive cells represented 92.9% and 92.7% of transgene-expressing cells in GFP-EH29 and GFP-DIIID2 transfected cells respectively (Fig. 3F ). When the same experimental procedure was performed after DENV-1 infection, the ability of Vero cells to be productively infected with this serotype was blocked when clathrin dependent endocytosis was interrupted by the dominant negative mutant transfection, reducing the percentage of DENV-1-positive cells from 75.1% of GFP-DIIID2 transfected cells to 16.6% of GFP-EH29 transfected cells ( Fig. 3E and F). In conclusion, all these data confirm that DENV-2 is capable of entering and causing a productive infection in Vero cells lacking a functional clathrin-mediated endocytosis whereas the infection of Vero cells with DENV-1 requires this endocytic pathway.",

Caveolae are vesicles arising from specialized lipid rafts and associated to the protein caveolin (Pelkmans, 2005) .

            "text": "To determine if any step in DENV-2 entry before trafficking to the acidic vesicles was sensitive to perturbation of lipid rafts, we evaluated the effects on virus infection of nystatin and methyl-b-cyclodextrin. These sterol-binding drugs sequester cholesterol by extraction, in the case of methyl-b-cyclodextrin, or by complex formation at the membrane, in the case of nystatin, blocking the lipid raftdependent entry pathways (Ilangumaran and Hoessli, 1988; Anderson et al., 1996; Pelkmans et al., 2001) . Since this class of compounds can also modify the lipid bilayer of the virus envelope leading to virus inactivation, we first analysed the virucidal effect of nystatin and methyl-b-cyclodextrin by incubation of DENV-1 and DENV-2 suspensions with different concentrations of the compounds during 1 h at 37\u00b0C. Then, samples were diluted and remaining infectivity was titrated by PFU in Vero cells. The sample dilution effectively reduced the drug concentration to be incubated with the cells at least 100-fold to assess that any titre reduction was only due to cell-free virion inactivation. As seen in Fig. 4A , methyl-bcyclodextrin exerted a dose-dependent inactivating activity against DENV-1 and DENV-2 virions as a probable consequence of envelope alteration by its interaction with cholesterol. Nystatin exerted an inactivating effect against DENV something lower than methyl-b-cyclodextrin (data Fig. 4 . DENV-2 entry into Vero cells is independent of caveolae/lipid-rafts but is dependent on dynamin. A. DENV-1 or DENV-2 suspensions were incubated at 37\u00b0C with various concentrations of methyl-b-cyclodextrin. After 1 h remaining infectivity was determined. B. Vero cells were pretreated with nystatin or methyl-b-cyclodextrin. Then monolayers were washed with PBS and infected with DENV-1 or DENV-2 in culture medium without serum. After 1 h internalization, cultures were treated with proteinase K and the cell pellets were plated onto Vero cells to determine internalized virus by an infectious centre assay. Results are expressed as percentage of internalized virus with respect to a control without drug treatment. C. Cells were untreated (control) or treated with 100 mM nystatin or 5 mM methyl-b-cyclodextrin. Then cultures were incubated with FITC-labelled cholera toxin. D. Cells transiently transfected with the constructs GFP-cav-1 wt, GFP cav-1 DN or GFP-cav-1 Y14F were infected with DENV-2. After 24 h infection cultures were fixed and immunofluorescence staining was performed. E. For quantification of samples shown in (D), 250 transfected cells with similar levels of GFP expression were screened and cells positive for viral antigen were scored. F. Vero cells were treated with dynasore, infected with DENV-1 or DENV-2 in the presence of the drug and then processed as in (B). G. Cells transiently transfected with the constructs GFP-dyn II wt or GFP-dyn II K44A were infected with DENV-2. After 24 h infection cultures were fixed and immunofluorescence staining was performed. not shown). Based on these results, the treatment conditions to test the effects of the drugs on DENV infection were chosen to affect lipid raft organization of cell membrane but without a direct contact between drug and virions. Thus, Vero cells were pre-incubated with increasing concentrations of nystatin or methyl-b-cyclodextrin. Then, monolayers were extensively washed and infected with DENV-2 or DENV-1, probed as a negative control, in the absence of compound. The pretreatment with the drugs neither affected DENV-2 internalization (Fig. 4B ) nor DENV-2 production in Vero cells at 48 h p.i. (data not shown). As expected for a virus using clathrin-mediated endocytosis (Fig. 3) , DENV-1 internalization was not affected by both inhibitors at the tested concentrations (Fig. 4B) . The positive control for the effectiveness of cell treatment with these drugs on lipid raft/caveolae pathways was performed assaying the entry of FITC-labelled cholera toxin, a marker of internalization through this route, after a similar treatment to that used for virus entry assay. Untreated cells showed a clear dotted perinuclear cytoplasmic fluorescence due to the accumulation of the toxin in the endoplasmic reticulum and Golgi apparatus; whereas the treatment with nystatin or methyl-bcyclodextrin resulted in a diffuse green fluorescence pattern indicative of the impairment of toxin incorporation (Fig. 4C) . The blockade of cholera toxin entry showed that functional lipid rafts were destroyed by drug treatment, while the lack of inhibitory effect on DENV-1 infection indicated that the drug concentrations were not as high to affect other endocytic pathways, like the clathrinmediated endocytosis. Consequently, it is valid to conclude from these experiments with pharmacological inhibitors that DENV-2 entry is independent of lipid rafts/ caveolae. To address the lack of caveolae-mediated endocytosis in DENV-2 infection of Vero cells in a complementary manner, the impact of the expression of dominant negative mutants for caveolin-1, the major structural protein of caveolae, was next studied. The fusion of GFP at the N-terminal domain of caveolin-1 sequence inhibits the functionality of this protein acting as a dominant negative mutant named GFP-cav-1 DN, while the GFP fusion at the C-terminal end does not affect the protein (GFP-cav-1 wt) (Pelkmans et al., 2001) . More recently, a new form of dominant negative mutant named GFP-cav-1 Y14F was generated by a point mutation that prevented caveolin-1 phosphorylation (Coyne and Bergelson, 2006) . Vero cells were transfected with the wild-type and both mutant forms of caveolin-1, and 24 h post-transfection cells were infected with DENV-2. After 24 h of infection, cells were fixed and analysed for GFP expression to quantify transfected cells and for immunofluorescence staining against DENV-2 antigen to detect infected cells. As shown in Fig. 4D , the expression of the dominant negative mutants of caveolin GFP-cav-1 DN and GFP-cav-1 Y14F had no effect on the infection of cells with DENV-2. The percentage of infection in transgene-expressing cells, determined by scoring cells expressing viral antigens, was similar in cultures transfected with the three caveolin-1 constructs (Fig. 4E) , and thereby strengthened our conclusion that DENV-2 entry was independent of caveolae-mediated endocytosis. As expected, the dominant negative mutants of caveolin did not affect the entry of DENV-1 into Vero cells (Fig. S2A and B) .",

            "text": "Altogether, these results denote a route of infective entry for DENV-2 into Vero cells through an endocytic pathway independent of clathrin and lipid rafts/caveolae. In recent years, certain viruses were reported to use similar routes not fully characterized (Sieczkarski and Whittaker, 2002b; Quirin et al., 2008; Rojek et al., 2008) . In particular, the participation of dynamin is not clearly elucidated in non-clathrin, non-caveolar pathways (Conner and Schmid, 2003; Cao et al., 2007) . Dynamin is a GTPase essential for pinching off vesicles in clathrinand caveolae-dependent endocytosis. To probe if dynamin is involved in DENV-2 entry into Vero cells the effect of dynasore, a recently developed dynamin inhibitor (Macia et al., 2006) , was evaluated. Although the infection of Vero cells with DENV-2 was not clathrin-or caveolin-dependent, treatment with dynasore before and during virus infection significantly reduced DENV-2 internalization (Fig. 4F) , as well as virus production at 48 h p.i. (data not shown). As a positive control, we determined that the internalization of DENV-1 was inhibited by dynasore treatment (Fig. 4F) . To confirm the participation of dynamin in DENV-2 entry into Vero cells the GFPtagged versions of the wild-type form of dynamin II GFPdyn II wt and the dominant negative mutant GFP-dyn II K44A were used (Damke et al., 1994; Oh et al., 1998; Sauvonnet et al., 2005) . Vero cells were transfected with both constructs and after 24 h of transfection cells were infected with DENV-1 or DENV-2. At 24 h p.i., cultures were processed for immunofluorescence. Cells expressing similar levels of GFP-tagged wild-type and mutant forms of dynamin were selected and those stained for viral antigen were scored. As seen in Fig. 4G , DENV-2 multiplication was affected in cells expressing the dominant negative mutant, with percentages of infection in GFP-dyn II wt and GFP-dyn II K44A transfected cells of 87% and 16% respectively (Fig. 4H) . The expression of mutant dynamin also significantly reduced the infection with DENV-1 in the same cell line: in GFP-dyn II wt transfected cells the percentage of infection was about 70% whereas in cells transfected with GFP-dyn II K44A only 15% of cells were infected ( Fig. S2C and D) . Thus, we can conclude that the infective entry of both serotypes DENV-1 and DENV-2 into Vero cells is dependent on dynamin functionality.",

            "text": "The non-clathrin non-caveolar endocytic pathway for DENV-2 internalization into Vero cells was further characterized by investigating the possible involvement of the cellular cytoskeleton in this process. To address the role of actin network in DENV-2 entry, we analysed the effects of two drugs, cytochalasin D and latrunculin A, which disturb microfilament integrity by actin depolimerization (Rojek et al., 2008) , and a third compound, jasplakinolide, which acts by inducing a rigid stabilization of the actin polymer and a blockade of the microfilament dynamics (Rojek et al., 2008) . No inhibition was observed on DENV-2 multiplication after treatment with these compounds (Fig. 5A) . The lack of effect of actin-disturbing agents on DENV-2 entry was also assessed in an internalization assay, as shown in Fig. 5C for cytochalasin D, although the effectiveness of the compound to destroy the typical pattern of the actin microfilaments as bundles of thin fibers was observed by staining with FITC-labelled phalloidin (Fig. 5D) . Then, data with the different types of inhibitors allowed conclude that the structure and dynamics of the actin microfilaments are not involved in the endocytic DENV-2 entry to Vero cells. Additionally, these results represent the first evidence towards the probable exclusion of macropinocytosis or phagocytosis as possible mechanisms of DENV-2 internalization. Although neither macropinocytosis nor phagocytosis is frequently involved in virus entry, they have been reported as an alternative access for some viruses in certain cells (Mar\u00e9chal et al., 2001; Clement et al., 2006; Amstutz et al., 2008) . These two well-known endocytic routes for cell entry independent of clathrin and caveolae are strictly dependent of the F-actin network (Swanson and Watts, 1995) . We intended to obtain further evidence about the role of macropinocytosis by using amiloride, an inhibitor of the Na+/H+ exchange at the plasma membrane (Swanson and Watts, 1995) , but this compound exerted virucidal activity against DENV-2 inactivating cell-free virions (data not shown). The functionality of the microtubule cytoskeleton for DENV-2 infection of Vero cells was studied by cell pretreatment with nocodazole and colchicine, both inhibitors of microtubule assembly through binding to tubulin (Hamel, 1996) . The effect of these compounds on microtubule organization was verified using a monoclonal antibody to tubulin. The staining pattern observed as a network of tubules radiating from the perinuclear region to the cell periphery was transformed, after treatment with 30 mM nocodazole (Fig. 5D ) or 200 mM colchicine (not shown), into an arrangement of condensed amorphous aggregates in the cytoplasm. The destabilization of the microtubule network by nocodazole or colchicine treatment during virus entry caused a significant reduction in virus production (Fig. 5B ) as well as in virus internalization (Fig. 5C) , suggesting the requirement of the structural integrity of the microtubule network for efficient DENV-2 entry to Vero cells.",

The treatment of A549 cells with ammonium chloride, chlorpromazine, dansylcadaverine and nystatin was performed in the same conditions of incubation time and drug concentrations as previously described for Vero cells. The assayed range of concentrations was sufficient to induce essen-tially the same effects on the endocytic pathway in A549 cells in comparison to Vero cells, as determined by the corresponding staining markers (Fig. S3) . After drug treatment, cells were infected with DENV-2 and further incubated for 48 h, when supernatants were titrated by plaque formation on Vero cells. A dose-dependent and significant reduction in DENV-2 infection was detected in A549 cells when endosomal pH was increased by ammonium chloride pretreatment, indicating that a low pH-dependent endocytic route of entry is also used by DENV-2 in this mammalian cell line (Fig. 6A) . A similar level of dosedependent inhibition of DENV-2 infection was determined in A549 cells treated with both inhibitors of clathrinmediated endocytosis, chlorpromazine and dansylcadaverine ( Fig. 6B and C) . Accordingly, lipid rafts/caveolae were not required for the infection of A549 cells with DENV-2 since no inhibitory effect was detected by nystatin treatment (Fig. 6D) . These results indicate that the entry of DENV-2 into A549 cells was dependent on clathrin-mediated endocytosis and, consequently, differed from the pathway followed by the same viral serotype in Vero cells, as shown in Fig. 3 .",

In addition, infection assays in the presence of entry inhibitors quantitatively confirmed the results from the internalization assays, showing a concomitance in the levels of virus yields or viral antigen expressing cells for DENV-1 and DENV-2 with the proposed route of entry. Interestingly, a consistent and significative increase in DENV-2 yield was observed when infection was performed in the presence of the two inhibitors of clathrin-mediated endocytosis, chlorpromazine and dansylcadaverine. One possibility is that the clathrin pathway would be a non-infective route of entry for DENV-2 in Vero cells and, consequently, when it is blocked there is an enhancement in the utilization by DENV-2 virions of the infective non-clathrin pathway, leading to a higher production of infectious virus. Further research is required to ascertain this hypothesis or any other one to explain the results shown in Fig. 3A and B. In comparison, it has recently been shown that papillomaviruses could be internalized without inducing productive infection (Selinka et al., 2007) and, concomitantly, the inhibition of clathrin-and caveolae-mediated endocytosis led to an increase of human papillomavirus infectivity through a proposed alternative endocytic mechanism (Spoden et al., 2008) . Therefore, the increased infectivity of DENV-2 in cells with disturbed clathrin endocytosis may represent an additional support for usage of the nonclassical route.",

By contrast and in accordance with our results, Umashankar et al. (2008) demonstrated efficient membrane fusion by DENV-2 in cholesterol-depleted insect cells.

To address this question, we used methyl-bcyclodextrin to treat separately either DENV-2 suspension or Vero cells prior to virus infection, and experimental conditions (concentration and time of exposure to the drug) were optimized to avoid a general perturbation of membrane properties. Clearly, our studies demonstrate that the drug-induced release of cholesterol from virion membranes correlated with a dramatic loss of infectivity whereas cholesterol depletion of cell membranes did not affect subsequent virus infection. Thus, this virucidal activity of cholesterol depleting drugs, also reported for other flaviviruses (Aizaki et al., 2008) , may induce a false inference about the role of cellular cholesterol-rich microdomains for fusion and infection. In fact, the abovementioned reports of Reyes-del Valle et al. (2005) and Lee et al. (2008) did not analyse the virucidal activity of methyl-b-cyclodextrin against DENV-2. At present we do not know how the presence of cholesterol in the lipid viral envelope, acquired during the budding process, affects virion infectivity. It will be interesting in future studies to analyse at what stage the virus multiplication cycle is blocked after infection with methyl-b-cyclodextrininactivated DENV virions.",

            "text": "At present, the mechanistic basis of the different clathrin-dependence between DENV-1 and DENV-2 for entry into Vero cells cannot be fully understood. A different receptor usage may determine the consequential route of entry. A comparative study for DENV-1 and DENV-2 receptor in Vero cells has not been performed, but in human liver HepG-2 cells two different proteins, the laminin receptor and GRP78, were identified as DENV-1 and DENV-2 specific receptors respectively (Jindadamrongwech et al., 2004; Thepparit and Smith, 2004) , and also a higher saturation of infection was found for DENV-1 respect of DENV-2 (Suksanpaisan and Smith, 2003) . Another factor that may affect DENV entry is the presence of sugar molecules on the viral surface. The utilization of the two potential N-linked glycosylation sites of E (Asn-67 and Asn-153) has been determined for only a limited number of strains and the heterogeneity among circulating virus populations remains uncharacterized (Bryant et al., 2007) . Diverse phenotypic changes, such as fusion activity, tropism, virulence and morphogenesis, have been associated with the lack of glycosylation at one or both sites, with a variable behavior in mosquito or mammalian cells (Guirakhoo et al., 1993; Johnson et al., 1994; Bryant et al., 2007; Mondotte et al., 2007) . Further studies are needed to reveal if E glycosylation is related to the endocytic via utilized for DENV entry. Finally, after binding, both serotype virions need to be exposed at intravesicular low pH for functional entry (Fig. 2) , in accordance with the conformational transition reported for DENV-2, DENV-3 and DENV-1 E glycoprotein under acidic conditions that allow membrane fusion (Kuhn et al., 2002; Modis et al., 2004; Stiasny and Heinz, 2006; Nayak et al., 2009) . However, differences between the DENV-1 and DENV-2 E post-fusion conformations were reported (Nayak et al., 2009) . Interestingly, van der Schaar et al. (2008) found distinct requirements in the endocytic trafficking for two strains of the serotype DENV-2 in BSC-1 Fig. 7 . Endocytic pathways utilized by DENV-1 and DENV-2 to infect different cell lines. DENV-1 infection of Vero cells occurs through a classical clathrin-mediated dynamin-dependent endocytosis, while infection of this same cell line by DENV-2 takes place through a non-classical endocytic pathway independent of clathrin, caveolin-1 and lipid-rafts, but dependent on dynamin. This entry route differs from the clathrin-mediated pathway followed by DENV-2 to infect A549 cells and, as previously shown, to infect C6/36 cells (Acosta et al., 2008b; Mosso et al., 2008) , HeLa cells (Krishnan et al., 2007) and BS-C-1 cells (van der Schaar et al., 2008) . cells: by real-time imaging strain S1 particles fused from within Rab7-positive late endosomes whereas virions of strain NGC fused from Rab5-positive early endosomes. This may reflect a different pH threshold for fusion, a hypothesis that must be also evaluated among DENV serotypes. van der Schaar et al. (2008) also reported that the majority of DENV-2 particles had fused from acidic vesicles within 17 min p.i., in accordance with our results showing inhibition of DENV-1 and DENV-2 entry after 1 h of infection by the pH-rising effect of ammonium chloride and concanamycin A ( Fig. 2A) . Future experiments will allow to locate the precise vesicular pH for fusion of both DENV serotypes by monitoring the kinetics of low pH-dependence for entry into Vero cells and the kind of acidic organelle where fusion takes place.",

            "text": "An understanding of DENV entry into cells will not only extend our understanding of entry mechanism but also help to exploit new targets for antiviral therapy. The blockade of DENV entry into the host cell is an interesting antiviral strategy because it represents a barrier to suppress the beginning of infection (Altmeyer, 2004; Perera et al., 2008) . In particular, the studies about the anti-DENV activity of sulfated polysaccharides indicated that virus binding and internalization were blocked by this class of compounds . A differential susceptibility of DENV serotypes to polysulfates was observed: DENV-2 was the most susceptible serotype whereas DENV-1 showed very weak inhibition (Lin et al., 2002; Talarico et al., 2005; . These variations may be ascribed to the differences in virus-cell interactions during entry of DENV-1 and DENV-2 into Vero cells here reported. The simultaneous cocirculation of the four DENV serotypes in diverse regions from Asia and America makes mandatory the requirement for a potential antiviral agent to be reactive againtst all serotypes. Therefore, the elucidation of the precise mechanism of internalization for DENV serotypes will provide the opportunity to identify the adequate target for development of effective therapeutic agents.",

Effect of ammonium chloride on DENV multiplication, viral particles infectivity, virus adsorption and intracellular vesicle acidification. A. Cells were treated with increasing concentrations of ammonium chloride and infected with DENV-1 orDENV-2. Virus yields were quantified by plaque assay at 48 h p.i. B. Suspensions ofDENV-2 virions were incubated at 37\u00b0C with various concentrations of ammonium chloride. After 1 h samples were diluted and remaining infectivity was determined by plaque formation assay. C. Vero cells were treated as in (A) and infected with DENV-2 at 4\u00b0C. After 1 h adsorption in the presence or absence of the drug cells were disrupted and cell-bound virus was determined by plaque formation assay. In (A), (B) and (C) results are expressed as percentage of virus multiplication with respect to a control without drug treatment. Each point shows the mean \u03ee SD of two independent experiments. D. Cells were left untreated (control) or treated with 50 mM ammonium chloride or 50 nM concanamycin A. Then, samples were stained with acridine orange.
