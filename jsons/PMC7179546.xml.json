Transfection of 21-nt small interfering RNA (siRNA) molecules into mammalian cells results in degradation of the target gene mRNA and silencing of its expression [2]. The application of RNAi has had a significant impact in probing gene function and now promises to provide new strategies in the development of novel therapeutics and antivirals. The versatility of RNAi makes this technology particularly attractive in the pursuit of antiviral therapies directed against viral diseases, including the many viral diseases of livestock, and has been successfully applied to inhibit replication of some human and other animal viruses, including HIV-1 [3, 4, 5, 6], hepatitis C virus [7, 8, 9], hepatitis B virus [10], poliovirus [11], foot-and-mouth disease virus [12], transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV) [13], bovine viral diarrhea virus [14], porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus [15], and classical swine fever virus [16, 17], both in vitro and in vivo.",

            "text": "Porcine hemagglutinating encephalomyelitis virus (PHE-CoV) was first isolated in 1962 in Canada from suckling piglets with encephalomyelitis [18, 19] and can now be isolated from swine worldwide. Subclinical infections among swine are frequent [20, 21]. PHE-CoV causes encephalomyelitis, vomiting or wasting disease in suckling piglets. When piglets younger than 3 weeks are infected with PHE-CoV, their mortality rate ranges from 20 to 100%. Pigs older than 3 weeks show no obvious clinical signs [22]. PHE-CoV is a member of the antigenic group II of coronaviruses, along with bovine coronavirus (BCV), human coronavirus (HCV) strain OC43, turkey coronavirus (TCV), and mouse hepatitis virus (MHV). Members of this group possess five structural proteins: nucleocapsid (N), membrane (M), small membrane (sM), spike (S) and hemagglutinin-esterase (HE). HE is associated with granular projections located near the base of the typical large bulbous peplomers and displays hemagglutinating (HA) activities [23], Open reading frames (ORFs) potentially encoding non-structural (ns) proteins, including replicase polyprotein (R), have been identified. The number and size of R genes differ between coronavirus species, and they are important for RNA replication and transcription [24]. S possesses antigenic determinants that trigger the immune response for the production of antibodies that neutralize virus infectivity and inhibit HA activity [25]. S is a large, multifunctional protein that forms large petal-shaped spikes on the surface of the virions, and plays a central role in the biology and pathogenesis of coronaviruses [26], The availability of the complete genome sequence of PHE-CoV (GenBank accession No. NC_007732) enables the design of siRNA aimed at PHE-CoV. We designed specific siRNAs to target the S and R genes, in order to test whether RNAi could selectively target PHE-CoV viral RNAs. This study provides not only an experimental basis for the development of a new anti-PHE-CoV strategy, but also a new approach for studying PHE-CoV infection and replication.",

Three primers were synthesized (JiKang, Shanghai, China) for quantification of the PHE-CoV genome in real-time PCR: 5\u2032-AGCGATGAGGCTATTCCGACTA-3\u2032 (NFP primer), 5\u2032-TTGCCAGAATTGGCTCTACTACG-3\u2032 (NRP primer), and 5\u2032-FTTC-CGCCAGGCACGGTACTCCCP-3\u2032 (TaqMan probe). The target region of real-time RT-PCR was nucleotides 29344-29569 of the N protein gene of PHE-CoV. PHE-CoV-infected PK-15 cells, as well as culture supernatants, were collected 48 h after viral infection. Total RNA (100 ng) was extracted and purified using TRIzol LS Reagent (Invitrogen). PCR was used to amplify the N gene with NFP and NRP primers under conditions of 94\u00b0 for 3 min, then 40 cycles of 94\u00b0 for 30 s, 60\u00b0 for 30 s, and 72\u00b0 for 60 s, with a final extension at 72\u00b0 for 7 min. The PCR product was gel-purified using the Agarose Gel DNA Extraction Kit (Roche) and then cloned into pGEM-18T vector (Promega Corp., Madison, Wisc., USA). The resulting plasmid, pT-N, with the correct sequence confirmed by direct sequencing, was selected as a quantitative standard for the determination of the viral RNA copy number. Real-time PCR was performed with the ABI Prism\u00ae 7000 Sequence Detection System using a QuantiTect\u2122 Prob PCR Kit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany) under the conditions of 95\u00b0 for 3 min, followed by 40 cycles of denaturation at 95\u00b0 for 30 s, annealing, and extension at 60\u00b0 for 30 s.

            "text": "Porcine hemagglutinating encephalomyelitis (PHE) is an infectious disease that mainly affects pigs younger than 3 weeks. Even if an infected pig survives the diseaseassociated immunopathology or the toxicity of the drug treatment, PHE can acutely affect its growth. Increasing research attention has been focused on PHE because infection rates have increased in some countries [31, 32, 33, 34]. PHE is caused by PHE-CoV, a virus that has only one known strain and is the only known CoV that is neurotropic in pigs [25, 35, 36]. The virus spreads via peripheral nerves to the CNS, its main propagation site [37]. Nerve cells are the primary target for viral replication. Because the regeneration capacity of nerve cells is weak, once these cells are damaged, pathology will remain even if the virus is eliminated. The study of PHE-CoV replication and the control or inhibition of this infection is of great significance because, currently, no effective preventative measures or cures for this disease exist. Recently, the replication of various viruses, including many coronaviruses, have been shown to be effectively inhibited in vitro or in vivo by knockdown with 21- to 25-base-pair (bp), sequence-homology-driven siRNAs [26, 38, 39, 40]. siRNA therapy can inhibit different levels of viral function, including transcription and translation [41]. Very effective and rapid silencing of a target gene can be achieved using in vitro transcribed siRNAs transfected into mammalian cells [16]. In the present study, we designed four 21-bp siRNA molecules against the PHE-CoV S and R genes, prepared these siRNAs by in vitro transcription, and tested the efficiency of RNAi on viral replication by assessing CPE, IFA, HA, TCID50 and RT- qPCR. Our results demonstrate that these four siRNAs were highly capable of inhibiting viral RNA genome replication.",

            "text": "PHE-CoV is a member of the Coronaviridae family, whose gene expression involves a series of complex transcriptional, translational, and post-translational regulatory mechanisms [42]. After receptor-mediated entry, the replicase polyprotein, encoded by ORFs, 1a and 1b, which comprise approximately two-thirds of the genome (beginning from the 5\u2032 end), is the first viral protein to be translated. The translation of the replicase polyprotein involves ribosomal frameshifting to the \u22121 frame immediately upstream of the ORF 1a translation termination codon (GenBank accession No. NC_007732) [43]. Many studies have shown that siRNAs that target the R gene can efficiently inhibit viral replication [13]. In addition, similar to other coronaviruses spike proteins, the PHE-CoV spike glycoprotein contains two non-covalently associated functional subunits, S1 and S2 (GenBank accession No. AY078417, NC_007732). It is thought that the binding of the S1 subunit to its cellular receptor induces conformational changes in S2, which leads to the fusion between viral and cellular membranes and, thus, viral entry [44]. Variations in S proteins between strains of coronaviruses are responsible for differences in host range and tissue tropism [45]. Based on this knowledge, we chose the S and R genes as the RNAi targets, and our results demonstrate that these two key genes are important for PHE-CoV replication.",

Hence, the replication kinetics of PHE-CoV in PK-15 cells were studied by CPE, HA and TCID50 assays prior to siRNA transfection, and viral proliferation was shown to peak at 48-72 h post-infection (data not shown). Based on this information, the cell cultures for IFA, viral titration and RNA extraction were harvested at 48 h postinfection. The result of CPE analysis showed that virus-produced CPE was not observed at 56 h post-infection in cells treated with SR1, SR2, SS1, or SS2. To further examine the level of viral inhibition, we tested the viral titers in infected cells by TCID50, and showed that siRNAs caused an approximately 93- to 494-fold decrease in virus yield. Additionally, further analysis confirmed that the efficient inhibition of viral replication in this study was due to viral RNA degradation. We designed a pair of primers specific to the N gene of PHE-CoV and showed by real-time PCR that approximately 53-91% less viral RNA existed in the cells transfected with the siRNA compared to the control cells, which verified that the suppression of infection occurred at the RNA level. In fact, because the pair of primers designed for amplifying a region within the N gene could amplify the same regions within the PHE-CoV RNA genome and subgenomic mRNAs (except the shortest one) simultaneously, the reduction in viral RNAs suggests that not only the viral genome RNA itself but also all of the transcripts required for viral structural protein expression decreased [13].",

In vitro transcribed SS1 and SS2 siRNAs were effective in reducing viral replication; however, the S1 subunit of the spike glycoprotein is not an essential structural protein and is prone to high mutation rates as the virus evolves in host populations [47]. To ensure that SS1 and SS2 could be used in a wide range of virus strains, we evaluated the cross-inhibitory capabilities of these siRNAs by conducting multiple alignments of S gene sequences from PHE-CoV strains based on their availability in GenBank. Our results showed that SS1 and SS2 could cover 67% (4/6) and 100% (6/6) of PHE-CoV strains, respectively (data not shown), indicating that additional studies should be conducted to search for siRNAs with the widest cross-inhibitory effects on a range of PHE-CoV strains.",

To circumvent this problem, the replicase genes of PHE-CoV, which are highly conserved among different strains, were targeted by SR1 and SR2 [13]. Our results demonstrated that both siRNAs could block viral replication with very high efficiency. Our study was performed utilizing infection with the HEV-67N strain, whose sequence is not available in GenBank; however, our study implies that the sequence identity of SR1, SR2 and the HEV-67N strain should be 100% because RNAi is highly sequence-specific and requires 100% identity for clearance of virus from cell culture between the target and targeting sequences [11, 17, 48]. Application of only one siRNA that is 100% identical to the sequence from the infecting virus or more than one siRNA sequence targeting different conserved regions of the gene are ways to overcome the lack of knowledge of the target sequence. However, additional studies should be performed to confirm this hypothesis both in vitro and in vivo.",
