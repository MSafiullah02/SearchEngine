Candidate SARS-CoV vaccines have been successfully tested in animal models and in clinical trials. The lack of specific therapies against SARS necessitates molecular approaches for selecting attractive targets to facilitate the design of novel vaccines and antiviral agents against SARS-CoV infections (Groneberg et al. 2005; Han et al. 2006; van den Brink et al. 2005; ter Meulen et al. 2004, 2006; Poh et al. 2009).",

Given that this glycoprotein plays a crucial role in viral virulence and pathogenesis, its functions have been extensively characterized, and it is probably the most important viral target for vaccine design (Du et al. 2009). Containing intracellular, extracellular and transmembrane domains, the spike protein is classified as a type 1 transmembrane glycoprotein that is responsible for virus binding, fusion and entry (Simmons et al. 2004; Zhang et al. 2004; Zhou et al. 2004). Of particular interest and importance is the S1 unit which constitutes one of the two subunits of the extracellular domain. This domain is responsible for binding of the virus to its main receptor, angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), present on susceptible cells (Li et al. 2003; Babcock et al. 2004). Moreover, CD209L (L-SIGN) and DC-SIGN also facilitate cell entry of SARS-CoV (Jeffers et al. 2004; Shih et al. 2006). SARS-CoV spike is selectively recognized by pulmonary surfactant D and activates macrophages (Leth-Larsen et al. 2007).",

Protein samples of both batches were then analyzed by SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting using the human monoclonal antibodies to SARS-CoV spike. Among the 16 antibodies, the antibody designated pgG103-057C03P01 detected a single distinct band of ~180 kDa compatible with the glycosylated spike ectodomain in the total cell lysate and pellet of HL-CZ cells transfected with SARS-CoV spike, but not in the corresponding samples of cells transfected with pcDNA3.1 control. With the pgG103-057C03P01 antibody, Western blotting also revealed intense SARS-CoV spike bands in both the lysate and supernatant of spike-transfected human embryonic kidney HEK293T cells. These immunoblot results were further confirmed by using spike polyclonal antibody IMG-541 (Imgenex) which detected a weaker spike protein band (Fig. 18.1).\n",

Whether a cell is permissive for viral infection may be dependent on the state of cellular differentiation. For example, permissiveness for human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) infection is linked to repression of the viral major immediate early promoter (MIEP). In HCMV, monocytes represent a site of viral latency in HCMV carriers, and reactivated virus is only observed upon differentiation into macrophages. Histone deacetylases (HDACs) are involved in MIEP repression in nonpermissive cells, since inhibition of HDACs induces viral permissiveness and increases MIEP activity (Murphy et al. 2002). HDACs modulate MIEP transcriptional activity by affecting the acetylation of transcriptional factors as well as histones. A related protein, HDAC6, regulates formation of the HIV-mediated fusion pore. Binding of the HIV gp120 protein to CD4-positive permissive cells increases the level of acetylated \u03b1-tubulin. Overexpression of active HDAC6 inhibits tubulin acetylation, thus preventing HIV-1 envelope-dependent cell fusion as well as infection without affecting the expression of other HIV-1 receptors (Valenzuela-Fern\u00e1ndez et al. 2005).",

Many cellular processes depend on cytoskeletal rearrangements. Villin 1 is a structural protein regulated by increased intracellular calcium that in turn binds to actin, and contributes to the formation of microvilli in the small intestine. Cytokeratins are part of the family of keratins consisting of about 20 different proteins that comprise intermediate filaments in almost all epithelial cells. These filaments form the internal infrastructure of cells and are vital for maintaining cellular integrity. Disruption of such features affects cellular flexibility, tensile strength and interaction with other cellular components (Glass et al. 2006). Infection of animal cells by a number of viruses generally results in CPE. In lytic viral infections, there is a profound impairment of cell structural integrity, and inhibition of host protein synthesis related to widespread destruction of the intermediate filament network, e.g. proteolysis of cytokeratins K7 and K18 by the adenovirus late-acting L3 proteinase (Zhang and Schneider 1994). The collapse of this network (including vimentin and lamin), coupled with suppression of new keratin synthesis to restore the damaged filament network, contributes to CPE. In SARS-CoV infection, these microtubule networks may become disrupted, making it conducive for subsequent viral release, partially attributed to the spike protein.",

            "text": "Another noteworthy upregulated transcript (~5-fold) is ICln mRNA which encodes a 42-kDa chloride channel regulatory protein essential in regulating cell volume, and which interacts with the specific platelet integrin \u03b1IIb\u03b23 through the KVGFFKR motif on platelet membranes (Larkin et al. 2004). Treatment with the specific channel protein inhibitory agent, acyclovir, culminates in inhibition of platelet aggregation and integrin activation. It is also noteworthy that the SARS-CoV protein 3a upregulates fibrinogen expression in lung epithelial cells, congruent with observations of SARS patients with thrombocytopenia, and suggesting dysfunctional coagulation and activation of the fibrinogen pathway (Tan et al. 2005).",

            "text": "This is the first report documenting SARS-CoV expression in the human HL-CZ cell line that triggers a cascade of host transcriptional responses involving a wide repertoire of genes belonging to key functional classes including inflammation, immunity, cell signaling and trafficking. Intriguingly, most of the transcriptional factors upregulated in response to spike transfection are zinc finger proteins. In contrast to live SARS-CoV infection, this study provides comparative insights into the host transcriptomic effects of the spike protein when expressed alone in relevant human cells, thus shedding light on its specific roles during viral infection. These data indicate that SARS-CoV spike expression significantly modifies the regulation of numerous genes in HL-CZ cells, reiterate its importance in SARS pathogenesis, and further justify it as a key target for vaccine development. Such studies can enhance our understanding of the \u201cinfectomics\u201d of viral infections in different human and mammalian cell types. More in-depth analyses of the individual genes may be conducted by quantitative real-time RT-PCR to verify the microarray data, and by using gene-knockout animal models to further explore their specific roles in SARS-CoV infection in vivo.",
