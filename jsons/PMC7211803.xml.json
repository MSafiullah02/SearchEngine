As per this prediction model, India may have nearly a million confirmed cases by the end of May 2020. This may be controlled if the climatic conditions and Government of India policies become favorable to control the virus.",

In 2020, approximately 8.5% of the Indian population are age 60 years and older, whereas this number is more than 23% in Italy.7-8 COVID-19 is fatal in older patients, and therefore the fatality rate of India is lower as compared with that of other countries as of April 3, 2020.",

Although this disease appears to be well controlled in India till now, the recent dramatic increase in new cases and deaths outside of India, especially in Europe and the United States, indicates that the COVID-19 eruption may have tragic results globally if mitigation measures are not implemented in time. The study of the COVID-19 outbreak pattern of China may help in controlling the disease in other countries. As per the pattern of China, it may be understood that the effect of this disease in India will be at peak during the third and fourth weeks of April 2020. It is essential to discuss that these predictions are made on the basis of a comprehensive study of China. The strategies to reduce/control COVID-19 cases include a national lockdown of 21 days, public transport control, specialized medical support for affected populations, and others. If these measures are strictly followed, then results may be different.",
