The PRRS virus (PRRSV), the causative agent, is classified in the genus Arterivirus of the family Arteriviridae (Cavanagh, 1997), and has antigenically and genetically distinct two types\u2014European genotype (type 1) and North American genotype (type 2) (Meng et al., 1995, Nelson et al., 1993). The genome of PRRSV is a single-strand, positive-sense RNA of approximately 15 kb in length, which contains at least ten open reading frames (ORFs) (Conzelmann et al., 1993, Johnson et al., 2011, Snijder and Meulenberg, 1998). The ORF1a and ORF1b occupying 80% of the genome encode two viral replicase polyproteins\u2014pp1a and pp1ab. The pp1a is processed into ten nonstructural proteins (Nsps) including Nsp1\u03b1, Nsp1\u03b2, Nsp2 to Nsp6, Nsp7\u03b1, Nsp7\u03b2 and Nsp8, while the pp1ab is cleaved into Nsp9, Nsp10, Nsp11 and Nsp12 which are recognized to be involved in viral genome transcription and replication (Bautista et al., 2002, den Boon et al., 1995, Fang and Snijder, 2010, Snijder and Meulenberg, 1998, van Dinten et al., 1996).",

            "text": "Among the putative Nsps encoded by the ORF1b region of PRRSV, the Nsp9 is considered to possess RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) activity that plays an important role in viral replication. This protein contains a RdRp domain in its C-terminal portion that is critical for its polymerase activity and viral genome transcription (Beerens et al., 2007, Fang and Snijder, 2010). Our recent studies uncovered that Nsp9 and Nsp10 together not only affect the Chinese highly pathogenic PRRSV (HP-PRRSV) replication and growth in vitro and in vivo, but also contribute to its fatal virulence for piglets (Y. Li et al., 2014). Obviously, the Nsp9 is the most important protein contributing to the replication and virulence of PRRSV. To date, limited evidence is known about the roles of Nsp9 in the regulation of PRRSV replication. A recent literature indicated that the interaction of Nsp9 with endogenous cellular annexin A2 is beneficial for PRRSV replication in MARC-145 cells (J. Li et al., 2014). Our latest work showed that the interaction of Nsp9 with cellular retinoblastoma protein (pRb) contributes the replication of genotype 2 PRRSV in vitro (Dong et al., 2014). Therefore, further exploring the interaction of Nsp9 with host cellular proteins is necessary for fully understanding the mechanisms associated with the replication regulation and pathogenesis of PRRSV.",

These proteins share eight conserved motifs (I, Ia, Ib, II, III, IV, V and VI) in the DExD/H helicase family (Choi and Lee, 2012, Zonta et al., 2013), which are considered to be involved in RNA binding and decay, ATP binding and hydrolysis. The DEAD-box RNA helicase 5 (DDX5) has been shown to affect viral RNA replication by interacting with viral helicase in hepatitis C virus (HCV) (Goh et al., 2004), and severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) (Chen et al., 2009).

The interactions between viral RdRp and host cellular proteins have been recognized in some viruses (Chen et al., 2009, Goh et al., 2004, McBride et al., 1996). A previous study on equine arteritis virus (EAV) showed that a cytosolic host protein factor with a molecular mass in the range of 59\u201370 kDa is essential for the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) activity of viral replication/transcription complex (RTC) (van Hemert et al., 2008). As an important RdRp of PRRSV, the Nsp9 is involved in the replication and transcription of viral genomic and subgenomic RNAs. Recent studies have indicated the role of Nsp9 in the replication of PRRSV by interacting with host cellular proteins (J. Li et al., 2014, Dong et al., 2014). However, more studies are required to uncover a possible network of host cellular proteins interacting with this nonstructural protein in the PRRSV replication.",

In the present study, we first screened that porcine cellular DDX5 interacted with the Nsp9 of PRRSV by using the yeast two-hybrid method, and further confirmed this interaction in both HEK293 cells and MARC-145 cells by Co-IP assay. Our results implicate that DDX5, as a typical RNA helicase, might provide additional activities to facilitate the accomplishment of viral genomic replication and transcription although PRRSV can encode own RNA helicase, the Nsp10 with helicase activity. Recently, DDX5 has been shown to interact with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) Rev protein that plays a part in the late phase of HIV-1 replication and to facilitate the export of unspliced viral mRNAs from nucleus to cytoplasm in infected cells (Zhou et al., 2013).",

Recent studies have demonstrated that DDX5 could interact with the core protein, NS3 and NS5 of Japanese B encephalitis virus (JEV) during viral infection. Since NS3 and NS5 of JEV can bind to 3\u2032UTR of viral RNA that may be involved in the first round of viral protein translation and RNA replication, further research indicated that DDX5 binds to the JEV 3\u2032UTR to enhance viral replication but not viral protein translation (Li et al., 2013). Thus, we propose that the interaction between DDX5 and Nsp9 might regulate the replication of PRRSV via forming a complex binding to the 3\u2032UTR of viral genome, which needs to be further confirmed.",

Our results showed that DDX5 co-localized with Nsp9 in the cytoplasm with a perinuclear pattern in HEK293 cells, MARC-145 cells and PAM cell line, and meanwhile it co-localized with Nsp9 in PRRSV-infected MARC-145 cells and PAMs, suggesting that endogenous DDX5 might diffuse from the nucleus to the cytoplasm in PRRSV-infected MARC-145 cells.

The exact mechanism concerning this role, however, needs to be further explored.
