There is a constant need for information as new organisms emerge, existing ones develop resistance to current drugs or vaccines, and there are changes in epidemiology and prevalence. In the twenty-first century, obtaining this information has never been more important. Population migration, and the relatively low cost of flying, means that unfamiliar infectious diseases may be brought into industrialized countries. An example of this was an outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), which was first recognized in 2003. Despite modern technology and a huge input of money, it took months for the agent to be identified, a diagnostic test to be produced, and a strategy for disease reporting and isolation to be established.",

In March 2009, the first case was reported in Mexico; by June 2009, over 22,000 cases had been reported in 70 countries, thus fulfilling the criteria for a pandemic. Challenges ensued with decisions about treatment and then the distribution and administration of specific vaccine. More recent examples include the discovery of Corona virus Mers CoV which emerged predominantly from the Middle East in 2012 and spread to many countries. In 2014 there was an Ebola outbreak in West Africa which lead to cases being transferred to Europe and the USA.",

First, managing detainees or police personnel who have contracted a disease and may be infectious or unwell, and second, handling complainants of assault, includingpolice officers, who have potentially been exposed to aninfectious disease. The latter can be distressing for those involved, compounded in part from an inconsistency of management guidelines, if indeed they exist.",

Therefore, it is prudent to pre-empt such situations before the consultation begins by obtaining either written or verbal consent from the detainee to allow certain pieces of information to be disclosed. If he/she does not agree, then the HCP must decide whether withholding relevant details will endanger the lives or health of those working within custody or others with whom they may have had close contact (whether or not deliberate). Issues of consent and confidentiality are discussed in detail in Chap. 10.1007/978-3-030-29462-5_2.",

For victims of violent or sexual assault, a more open-minded approach is needed (see also Chap. 10.1007/978-3-030-29462-5_3). If the assailant/suspect is known, then it may be possible to make an informed assessment of the risk of certain diseases by ascertaining their lifestyle and where possible by asking permission to test for certain diseases. If, however, the assailant is unknown, then this is not possible and so it is best to assume they are infected.

Where a route of transmission was identified, in 64.6% cases the mode of transmission was through heterosexual exposure. Men who have sex with men accounted for 14% of the cases. However, only 36% had information about the associated exposure. None the less the data presented suggests that the number of cases of acute hepatitis B inPWID has remained low in 2016. Periodic surveys in PWID show that the hepatitis B prevalence is around 1 in 500 [9] This is thought to be in part due to increased awareness, and self-reported hepatitis B vaccine uptake. In 2016 about 75% ofPWID reported having hepatitis B vaccine, but this level is no longer increasing. Uptake is especially low in younger age groups and amongst new injectors [8].",

In March 1995, a live-attenuated vaccine was licensed for use in the USA and a policy for vaccinating children and susceptible healthcare personnel was introduced. In the summer of 2002 in the UK, GlaxoSmithKline launched a live-attenuated vaccine called Varilrix. In December 2003, the Department of Health, following advice from the Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation (JCVI), recommended that the vaccine be given for non-immune healthcare workers who are likely to have direct contact with individuals withchicken pox. Any healthcare worker with no previous history of chicken pox should be screened for immunity, and if no antibodies are found, they should receive twodoses of vaccine 4\u20138 weeks apart.

As adults, being exposed to natural disease from infected children boosts immunity and protects the adults from developing shingles.

Factors pertinent to the overall upswing included the emergence of HIV, the increasing numbers of immigrants from countries with a high prevalence of tuberculosis, and perhaps more significantly, the stopping of categorical federal funding for control activities in 1972. The latter led to a failure of the public health infrastructure for TB control. Since 1992, the trend has reversed as the CDC transferred most of its funds to tuberculosis surveillance and treatment programs in states and large cities. In 2017 9093 cases were reported to the CDC giving an overall TB rate of 2.8 cases/100,000 persons. More than 50% of all TB was reported in four states (California, Florida, New York and Texas).

The earliest case was believed to have originated in the Guandong province of China on 16 November 2002. The causative agent was identified as a new Corona virus\u2014SARS-CoV [77, 78]. By the end of June 2003, 8422 cases had been reported from 31 different countries with a total of 916 deaths. Approximately 92% of cases occurred in China (including Hong Kong, Taiwan and Macao). The case fatality rate varied from <1% in people less than 24 years old, to over 50% in persons 65 or older. On 5 July 2003, the WHO reported that the last human chain of transmission ofSARS had been broken and lifted the ban from all countries. However, they warned that everyone should remain vigilant, as resurgence ofSARS was still a possibility and this indeed proved the case with reports ongoing until May 2004. Since then, there have been no further reported cases. Knowledge about the epidemiology and ecology of SARS-CoV and the disease remains limited; however, the experience gained from the previous outbreak enabled the disease to be contained rapidly\u2014reflected in the few cases reported since December.

The officer reported the injury immediately to the HCP who encouraged the puncture to bleed and washed the area well with soap and water and applied a plaster. Details of the incident were recorded along with a medical history of thepolice officer and details of vaccinations received. The police officer reported that he had not had any hepatitis B vaccine. He had no underlying health concerns.The HCP spoke with the detainee who admitted injecting drugs and to sharing needles. He last shared a needle more than 3 months ago and had no other risk factors. The HCP asked if the detainee was willing to provide a sample of blood which would be tested for hepatitis B, HIV and hepatitis C. The detainee agreed and signed a consent form which was countersigned by the HCP and an independent police officer. Ten mLs of clotted blood was taken from the detainee which was given to thepolice officer involved who took it to the designated hospital. A 10 mL clotted sample of blood was taken at the hospital from thepolice officer as a baseline blood to be stored.Testing of the detainee\u2019s blood revealed the following:HBs Ag positiveHCV antibody positiveHIV antibody/Ag negativeBased on these findings and the unvaccinated status of thepolice officer\u2014HBIG was administered into the gluteal region along with the hepatitis B vaccination in to the deltoid region. Arrangements were made to follow up thepolice officer to receive two further doses of hepatitis B vaccine at 4 and 8 weeks. Further screening for hepatitis C RNA at 6 and 12 weeks and for HCV antibodies at 12 and 24 weeks. A test for HBsAg would also be conducted at 24 weeks.A detainee was arrested and brought into custody. Whilst filling in the risk assessment form the Custody Sergeant became aware that the detainee was on medication for pulmonary TB.The HCP was asked to examine the detainee and established that the diagnosis of TB had been made 3 weeks ago.The detainee had been prescribed isoniazid and rifampicin for 6 months with ethambutol and pyrazinide for the first 2 months. She reported that she had taken her medication every day for the last 20 days. This was evidenced by the number of tablets that had gone from the supply given.
