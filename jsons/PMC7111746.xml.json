Etiologic diagnoses of pneumonia are not so easy to determine or so accurate as is sometimes implied. In addition, proof of the cause of pneumonia is not obtained in most cases. There is a great deal of overlap in the radiographic appearance of pneumonias caused by different organisms. Imaging is usually poor at predicting the broad category (eg, bacterial vs viral) of infectious agent, let alone the specific agent. Preexisting lung disease may not only predispose to pulmonary infection but also modify the appearance of pulmonary consolidation. Furthermore, because the lungs can respond to a diverse disease processes in only a limited number of ways, it is common for the radiographic features of both acute and chronic infectious pneumonia to overlap considerably with many noninfectious lung diseases. Such noninfectious lung diseases are identified as pneumonia mimics in this article.",

With decreasing maternal antibody levels, viral pneumonia occurs at a peak between 2 months to 2 years of age. Bacterial infections become relatively more common in older children from 2 years to 18 years of age.5 The lung response to an infective antigen seems to be more age-specific than antigen-dependent (ie, bacteria vs viral). Therefore, lobar and alveolar lung opacities are more common in older children and are more frequently caused by bacterial infections, whereas interstitial opacities are seen in all age groups, and are relatively nonspecific as to the type of causative organism.6, 7\n",

This imaging can be supplemented with other views such as lateral decubitus or other imaging modalities as the circumstances warrant. Decubitus views are not useful when an entire hemithorax is opacified because layering fluid cannot be identified without any adjacent air. The main use of US is to identify, quantify, and characterize a parapneumonic effusion/empyema, as well as provide image guidance for drainage and identify residual collections after treatment.8, 9 Operator availability and expertise are important factors in making US a useful tool for evaluating pulmonary infection. Although intrapulmonary fluid-filled cavities and even lung abscesses within consolidated lung can be identified on US, CT provides a more global view of the disease process. CT is often used to further evaluate: (1) suppurative lung complications and to differentiate these from parapneumonic effusion/empyema; (2) patients with recurrent or chronic pneumonia and concern for an underlying lesion; and (3) immunocompromised children with noncontributory or confusing chest radiographs and clinical findings that could be secondary to lung infection.5\n",

            "text": "Close attention to CT technique is crucial for imaging evaluation of pneumonia in pediatric patients. CT with low radiation dose technique should be carefully performed in all cases. Eighty to 120 kVp with weight-based low milliampere-seconds coupled with radiation dose modulation techniques is appropriate in most children for evaluation of pneumonia. Multiple CT image acquisitions are usually not needed and the scan field of view should be tailored to the area of interest (especially if following a specific lesion serially over time) to further decrease the overall radiation dose.10 Occasionally, it may be useful to acquire additional expiratory scans to assess air trapping, which is an early imaging finding associated with small airway disease. In this situation, often at least 1 or both CT acquisitions can be obtained using a high-resolution CT (HRCT) gap technique. To obtain optimal CT imaging at peak inspiration and close to expiratory residual volume, controlled ventilation (CViCT) in infants and young children (\u22645 years old) or spirometer-controlled CT in older children may be needed.11 Young children have little intrinsic tissue contrast. Therefore, intravenous contrast is almost always needed for CT imaging of infection especially if mediastinal delineation is required. The exception is when HRCT is used only for evaluating lung parenchymal and airway disease. Breath-holding is usually desirable but can be adapted on a case-by-case basis depending on the needs of the study and the ability of the child to cooperate. However, for the study to be interpretable, gross patient motion should be absent. Sedation or anesthesia may be required in infants, young children, or children with intellectual disability. Delays between induction of anesthesia and scanning need to be minimized to prevent the potential for lung atelectasis with anesthesia. The anesthesiologist needs to pay close attention to techniques for preventing atelectasis or recruiting lung before the CT imaging.12\n",

Their study showed that lung parenchymal, pleural, and lymph node inflammatory abnormalities can be characterized by MR imaging in children with lung infection. Therefore, MR imaging might potentially be used to further evaluate suspected, acute complications of pneumonia.13 Children with chronic lung conditions and recurrent infection, such as cystic fibrosis, who are often subjected to substantial radiation exposure from repeated CT studies, would benefit the most from MR imaging evaluation of the lungs instead of CT. Although MR imaging may not provide as much detail compared with CT especially with early, small or subtle changes (Fig. 1\n), there are promising indications of a role for MR imaging in pulmonary infection.13, 14, 15\n",

Pleuritic chest pain in lower-lobe pneumonia is sometimes referred to the abdomen and may be mistaken clinically for an acute abdominal condition. Acute focal pneumonia is most often caused by bacterial infection with streptococcus pneumonia. Other causes of acute focal pneumonia are summarized in Box 1\n. The chest radiograph of acute focal pneumonia usually shows a dense, typically more peripheral airspace opacity, which may appear segmental, lobar, or spherical (Figs. 3 and 4\n).21, 22, 23 In a febrile child with a spherical density on a chest radiograph, the most likely diagnosis is a round pneumonia but the possibility of an underlying neoplasm may be considered. Round pneumonias tend to be solitary, have well-defined borders, and are often located in the perihilar region or posteriorly in the lungs. The radiograph should be carefully scrutinized for features of consolidation such as air bronchograms as opposed to those of a mass such as vascular/airway displacement or bony erosion. A second view such as a lateral radiograph may be helpful because a round pneumonia is often less masslike in appearance on an orthogonal view. This is one of the few scenarios in which radiologic follow-up after about 2 weeks may be useful to document interval resolution of acute pneumonia.22 Acute respiratory distress may be secondary to an intrathoracic mass causing airway or lung compression, especially when there is complete opacification of a hemithorax on radiographs (Fig. 5\n). Intrapulmonary masses including both benign and malignant entities may present clinically with acute superinfection. In addition, other conditions or anatomic variants may be mistaken for pneumonia when a chest radiograph is obtained in a child with a fever and respiratory symptoms.Box 1Causes of acute focal pneumonia in children\nUsualStreptococcus pneumonia\nUncommon\nBacteria: Hemophilus influenzae type B, nontypable H influenza, Staphylococcus aureus, group A streptococcus, Mycoplasma pneumoniae, Chlamydia pneumoniae\n\nRare\nBacteria and mycobacteria: Francisella tularensis, Mycobacterium tuberculosis, Meningococcus, enteric bacteria\nViruses (usually lobular): RSV, parainfluenza, adenovirus, human metapneumo virus\nFungi: Histoplasma, other systemic fungi\nData from Fisher RG, Boyce TG.

Lipoid pneumonias are typified by mild, subacute, or chronic clinical findings with accompanying marked radiographic changes. Chest radiographs of children with lipoid pneumonia typically show bilateral parahilar ill-defined, airspace opacities. In a series of 7 pediatric patients, CT showed dense consolidation surrounded by ground-glass opacity with a geographic lobular distribution.33 Within the dense consolidations, areas with relatively low attenuation were identified in only 1 patient. Therefore, low-density consolidation in the posterior lungs is an infrequent CT finding in the diagnosis of lipoid pneumonia in children (Fig. 15\n). Interlobular septal thickening in areas of ground-glass opacity (ie, crazy paving pattern) has also been described in children with lipoid pneumonia.33 Lipoid pneumonias may be complicated by superimposed infection especially with atypical mycobacteria. Slow recovery usually takes place with cessation of the oil administration. There may be residual scarring/fibrosis especially with animal rather than vegetable oils.34, 35\n",

            "text": "Foreign body aspiration can also result in pneumonia. Accidental aspiration of both organic and nonorganic foreign bodies is a cause of childhood morbidity and mortality, requiring prompt recognition and early treatment to minimize the potentially serious and sometimes fatal consequence. Eating is the most common circumstance during which it occurs, with small food items being the most common foreign bodies aspirated. Coughing, choking, acute dyspnea, and sudden onset of wheezing are the most common symptoms. Clinical signs of foreign body aspiration have low positive predictive values. Chest radiographs are the initial imaging modality for patients with clinically suspected tracheobronchial aspiration of a foreign body. Chest radiographs may show air trapping, atelectasis, a radiopaque foreign body (rare), or be normal (Fig. 16\n).36 When the routine inspiratory chest radiograph is unhelpful or confusing, inspiratory and expiratory radiographs (in a cooperative child) or bilateral decubitus views (in a younger child unable to follow breathing instruction) are useful in confirming focal or unilateral air trapping. In selected cases, CT (possibly integrated with virtual bronchoscopy) may be considered to exclude a foreign body. CT evaluation may avoid bronchoscopy or provide the exact location and postobstructive complications of the foreign body before bronchoscopy.37 An underlying chronic unrecognized airway foreign body should be considered among other causes of recurrent or chronic pneumonia, particularly in the pediatric population (see Fig. 16).",

It is best classified from the anatomic pattern, as focal, interstitial, with hilar lymphadenopathy, or with cysts, cavities, or spherical masses. Spherical masses, with or without cavitations, are often features of an infectious cause. Infectious causes and mimics of this pattern are summarized in Boxes 9 and 10\n(see Fig. 16; Fig. 18, Fig. 19, Fig. 20\n).42 Obstructive atelectasis may both mimic and predispose to chronic pneumonia. It may have many underlying causes, including foreign body, mucoid impaction, narrowed bronchus, and extrinsic bronchial compression by cardiovascular anomalies, lymphadenopathy, tumor, or postpneumonic inflammatory changes. Anomalies of the lung, mediastinum, and diaphragm that may mimic an acute or chronic pneumonia pattern include atypical thymus, diaphragmatic eventration and hernia, tracheal bronchus, lung hypoplasia, and congenital bronchopulmonary malformations (BPMs).20 Several of these lesions, such as the BPMs, predispose to recurrent or chronic infection but differentiating an infected from uninfected lesion may be difficult or impossible on imaging.

The most common radiographic manifestation of neonatal pneumonia is bilateral coarse perihilar reticular densities with possible scattered airspace opacities (Fig. 21\n). Solitary lobar consolidations are uncommon.47 There is an association between group B streptococcal pneumonia and an ipsilateral diaphragmatic hernia.48 Chest radiographs in group B streptococcal sepsis can mimic the diffuse ground-glass opacity seen in surfactant deficiency disease. However, the presence of this finding in a full-term infant or the presence of cardiomegaly or pleural effusions may help to differentiate group B streptococcal infection from surfactant deficiency disease.49\n",

Such pulmonary nodules are often clustered peripherally and can show poorly defined margins, cavitation, or a surrounding halo of ground-glass opacity (CT halo sign) (Fig. 22\n). The CT halo sign is a nonspecific finding and represents either hemorrhage around a nodule or neoplastic or inflammatory infiltration of the lung parenchyma.

This condition usually occurs in the context of chronic airway infection causing inflammation. Bronchiectasis is nearly always diagnosed using HRCT. The main diagnostic features of bronchiectasis on HRCT are: (1) internal diameter of a bronchus that is wider than its adjacent pulmonary artery; (2) failure of the bronchus to taper peripherally; and (3) visualization of bronchi in the outer 1 to 2 cm of the lung zones (see Fig. 17; Figs. 27 and 28\n). A wide variety of factors predisposing to the development of bronchiectasis have been identified, including hereditary (cystic fibrosis, ciliary dyskinesia), infective, immunodeficiency (antibody deficiency), obstructive (intrabronchial foreign body), and systemic causes. Causes most commonly associated with bronchiectasis are childhood infections, including pneumonia, pertussis, complicated measles, and tuberculosis (eg, Mycobacterium tuberculosis and Mycobacterium avium complex).79, 80, 81\n",

Restriction of lung parenchymal expansion and subsequent negative pressure in the pleural space result in filling of the pleural space with pleural fluid (usually a transudate). The diagnosis of a trapped lung implies chronicity, stability over time, and a purely mechanical cause for the persistence of a fluid-filled pleural space. Patients with a trapped lung usually do not experience improvement in dyspnea after thoracentesis. In symptomatic patients, decortication should be considered. The underlying lung parenchyma should be assessed before decortication. If the trapped lung is severely diseased and fibrotic, decortication is unlikely to result in lung reexpansion and the procedure does not provide symptomatic benefit. In contrast, lung entrapment is the result of an active inflammatory process or malignancy in the pleural space, leading to a restricted pleural space. Pleural fluid from lung entrapment is an exudate, and symptoms in patients with lung entrapment typically improve after thoracentesis.83, 85\n",
