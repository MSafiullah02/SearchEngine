For instance, the surgical team has daily operational huddles to discuss how decisions made by the institutional clinical operations team are to be implemented in their area. Clear and regular cascading communication and documentation are necessary for a successful incident command structure.

We have developed a guideline for judicious PPE use (Fig. 1\n). Before the COVID-19 outbreak, our institution had made a decision to add CAPRs to our armamentarium for respiratory protection of healthcare workers. This has allowed us to be in a position to balance types of PPE to be worn by our staff based on availability of supplies. Preferential use of CAPR devices for inpatient and surgical care of strict isolation patients may reduce the use of disposable N-95 masks.",

Access to COVID-19 testing was limited initially until it was allowed to take place outside the public health setting.
