Fig. 16 .1 shows the international warning sign of biohazard. Local languages are to be adopted to ensure the message can be understood. The assignment of an agent to a biosafety level for laboratory work must be based on a risk assessment. Such an assessment will take the risk group as well as other factors into consideration in establishing the appropriate biosafety level. For example, an agent that is assigned to Risk Group 2 may generally require Biosafety Level 2 facilities, equipment, practices, and procedures for safe conduct of work. However, if particular experiments require the generation of high-concentration aerosols, then Biosafety Level 3 may be more appropriate to provide the necessary degree of safety, since it ensures superior containment of aerosols in the laboratory workplace. The biosafety level assigned for the specific work to be done is therefore driven by professional judgment based on a risk assessment, rather than by automatic assignment of a laboratory biosafety level according to the particular risk group designation of the pathogenic agent to be used. Table 16 .3 summarizes the facility requirements at the four biosafety levels.",

While containment is the first-line of defense in combating biohazards, containment alone is not effective in the prevention of reactive hazards. No containment is perfect and breaching of barriers can occur and is what we term accidents. After fires and explosions, the major accident that can occur in chemical processing is the release of a chemical that is hazardous to humans. Recall that one of the green chemistry tenants is to eliminate or reduce the use of toxic chemicals in a process. Benign solvents, such as air, water, carbon dioxide, and low-volatility solvents, such as ionic liquids and molten salt, are preferred. Still, the products we seek or produce are also commonly harmful substances when improperly released. Air and water can become contaminated with chemicals that cause harm. These hazards can be acute (causing immediate and critical harm to people as in the Bhopal accident in India) or chronic (ground-water contamination which can require years and millions of dollars for cleanup).

Spontaneously combusting solids or pyrophoric solids are solids that, even in small quantities, are liable to ignite within 5 minutes after coming into contact with air. Substances and mixtures of this hazard class are assigned to a single-hazard category on the basis of the outcome of the UN Test N.2. Self-heating substances are solids or liquids, other than a pyrophoric substance, which, by reaction with air and without heat supply, is liable to self-heat. Substances and mixtures of this hazard class are assigned to one of two hazard categories on the basis of the outcome of the UN Test N.4. Substances which on contact with water emit flammable gases are liable to become spontaneously flammable or to give-off flammable gases in dangerous quantities.

EPA is striving to learn the causes and contributing factors associated with chemical accidents and to prevent their recurrence. Major chemical accidents cannot be prevented solely through regulatory requirements. Rather, understanding the fundamental root causes, widely disseminating the lessons learned, and integrating these lessons learned into safe operations are also required. EPA publishes Alerts to increase awareness of possible hazards. It is important to review this information and consider whether additional action is needed to address the hazards. The purpose of this Alert is to introduce small-and medium-sized facilities to a simple method developed by the Center for Chemical Process Safety (CCPS), essential practices for managing chemical reactivity hazards, to screen facilities for chemical reactivity hazards. The CCPS preliminary screening method as illustrated in Fig. 16 .3 is a tool to help one identify where chemical reactivity hazards are likely to occur in a facility and may be applicable to a wide range of activities including warehousing, repackaging, blending, mixing, and processing. Many materials used in industrial facilities can pose chemical reactivity hazards. Reactivity hazards may not be as easy to identify as other hazards such as toxicity or corrosivity. A facility is at a higher risk of having an uncontrolled release if not all the existing chemical reactivity hazards are identified. Table 16 .6 shows the typical causes of reactivity incidents. One can infer that chemical reactivity hazards can be categorized as follows: 1. Self-reacting or unstable chemicals. A single-unstable compound can undergo uncontrolled decomposition, rearrangement, or polymerization. For example, organic peroxides can pose fire and explosion hazards. 2. Runaway reactions. Intended reactions of chemicals to produce desired products can become uncontrollable. For example, the reaction of phenol with formaldehyde to produce phenolic resins is subjected runaway. 3. Incompatibilities. Inadvertent mixing of two or more process chemicals may lead to an unintended chemical reaction.",

Reactive chemicals and materials, monomers, resins, peroxides, application interface's batteries and explosives-all have the potential to produce heat by exothermic reactions, these typically are unwanted. If the heat is not removed there is the potential for a runaway reaction. There is the need to understand the likelihood and to assess the impact of \"undesired reactions.\" This can be done in the laboratory on a smaller scale with the aim to simulate the scenario of what can happen in real life on any larger industrial scale. Such an understanding of heat release from chemical reactions and the potential for runaway reactions is vitally important in many branches of the chemical & allied industries. When the heat generated by a chemical process is greater than the possible heat removal, the temperature will rise with perhaps catastrophic effect! An example will be shown at the end of the Chapter to illustrate importance of heat removal. Now, you are equipped with the ability to conduct detailed reactor analysis that can simulate such unknown exothermic runaway reactions, mimicking what can happen on large scale and giving worst-case data; data obtained under zero-heat loss conditions. What happens if a chemical or system self heats? Initially (near onset of self-heating) this reaction will be slow. In chemicals this gives a loss of yield, a shelf life issue. At this stage heat loss is likely to pose little potential of a runaway and an explosion. However should the reaction accumulate heat it will accelerate and as temperature raises the rate of reaction will also increase. If the reaction is not kept under control, a safety problem will occur, which may result in explosion, loss of property, even human injury or death. It is necessary to remove this heat of reaction to control the reaction. To maintain control of the reaction the heat loss must be greater than the heat production. Fig. 16 .4 shows a schematic of a simple-reactor system. Heat-exchanging capability is illustrated with jacket having a \"cooling\" (or \"heating\") fluid passing through. If the reaction mixture volume is constant, we obtain from the first-law of thermodynamics [see Eq. (3.134)] similar to that in Chapter 15,",

The 2015 explosion in the port city of Tianjin, China, for example, shows that improper storage of chemicals (in this case nitrocellulose, and ammonium nitrate) can cause extreme harm. Over one hundred lives lost in the explosion. For all potential runaway reactions, heat loss possibility and environmental conditions are important. Therefore, scale is important. A small vessel will lose more heat than a large vessel due to the available heat transfer area per volume of the reaction mixture; the large vessel is more adiabatic. A reactive material in a smaller vessel will be stable to a higher temperature than the same material in a larger vessel. The same sample may be safe in a beaker or drum -but may runaway in a tanker causing explosion. A battery may be stable as a single unit -but as a battery pack in a black cased Notebook alongside heat-producing electronic components heat output may raise the battery temperature causing disintegration and fire. To simulate the real-life or large-scale scenario, the sample under investigation must be in an environment without heat loss (or gain). The temperature where the heat production exceeds the heat loss is the temperature of no return (TNR). There is not just one TNR, this value will change as heat-loss potential changes.

Certain bacteria, or enzymes can be applied to convert syngas to chemicals similar to sugars. Therefore, gasification has been a well-studied method in thermochemical conversions. However, as expected, the bioconversion efficiency is much lower for gaseous substrates than solid / liquid substrates. Table 16 .12 shows the typical compositions of gases in the syngas as a function of the oxygen addition. In anaerobic conditions, the gasification process is endothermic. Large amount of heat is needed to maintain the high temperature (700\u00b0C -1000\u00b0C) as well as to provide energy for breaking the polymer binds. The benefit of anaerobic gasification is the high heating (or energy) value of syngas. Table 16 .12 shows that the low heating value (LHV) of syngas produced with steam as heating medium is 12-14 MJ/Nm 3 , while it is only 4-6 MJ/Nm 3 for syngas produced by partial burning with air.

The reaction is normally carried out isothermally at 175\u00b0C over a 24-h period. Approximately 45 min after the reaction was started, cooling to the reactor was turned off for 10 min. It was not unusual not to cool in that 10 min or so on period when the normal charge of 3.17 kmol of ONCB was used and no ill effects occurred. The reactor had a safety relief valve with a disk rupture pressure of about 700 psi. Once the disk ruptures, the water would vaporize, and the reaction would be cooled (quenched) by the release of the latent heat of vaporization.",

The GHS label includes the substance name, id, eye-catching pictograms to show the potential dangers, warnings and descriptions on how to handle it. GHS hazard classification also includes three categories: Physical, Health and Environment. As compared with HMIS and NPFA labeling, GHS combined the flammability hazards into physical hazard category while one additional category is added: environmental hazard. Chemical reactivity hazard is defined as a situation where an uncontrolled chemical reaction could result directly or indirectly in serious harm to people, property, or the equipment. As such, the first come into mind of the reactivity hazards is fire and explosion, which usually involves strong exothermic reactions. To safe guard processes and facility, one needs to first identify the threat, or screening for reactivity hazards. When the \"threats\" are identified, one can then find the remediation(s) for the particular \"threats\" by adding barriers or change the design if possible to avoid the \"threats",

Chain reactions can also be very fast so that the reaction may be limited by mass transfer processes.Partial oxidation reactions are important in chemical industry. Pyrolysis and gasification of biomass, for example, are useful technologies in biomass conversion. We frequently do not have reliable reaction rate expressions for chain reactions, but we can compensate for this lack by designing and operating the reactor to manage the overall course of the reaction by properly dealing with mixing, mass transfer, promoters and inhibitors, and the presence of surfaces.An explosion can be defined as a fast, transient, exothermic reaction. It needs exothermicity to generate energy and must be fast to generate this energy very quickly in a transient pulse. We can also distinguish between events in which the reaction propagates at subsonic velocity as an explosion and one in which the reaction propagates with sonic or supersonic velocity as a detonation. Unintended and accidental explosions can occur due to (1) The accumulation of reactive chemicals (gas, liquid, or solid) in confined space; (2) Leakage of \"significant amount\" of reactive chemicals (gas, liquid, or solid) to atmosphere or environment; or (3) Reactor runaway.
