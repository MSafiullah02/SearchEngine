The decentralized nature of these devices coupled with high latency networks renders the centralized parallel SGD [8, 21] approaches infeasible due to high aggregation cost at the central node. Hence, it is imperative to design distributed algorithms that are well suited for these high latency systems. Decentralized learning algorithms [9, 10] operate on local hosts using only the local data partitions but to reduce communication cost, each worker shares information with a small subset of neighbors. As a result, the central bottleneck is effectively eliminated. An example is the hand-crafted virtual ring topology, where each worker only communicates with its two adjacent neighbors.",

For training highly non-linear models with non-convex optimization objectives, this could be problematic as high variance degrades convergence behavior and leads to suboptimal solutions. The fundamental question arises, \u201cfor decentralized parallel SGD, is it possible to learn a topology that provides faster model averaging compared to the hand-crafted counterparts?\u201d. It is well known that the spectral properties of the graph provide a good metrics to measure the connectivity structure of the topology [14]. Based on this, we propose an objective function, optimization of which leads to the topology that provides fast model averaging under constraints such as the number of connections. The direct optimization of the objective function leads to a combinatorial explosion of the search space, thus finding an optimal solution under constraints is intractable. The solution [12] that exists is limited to prime and prime power of the number of direct connections, which hinders its real-world applicability. In this paper, we propose a local search algorithm guided by the objective function to find a topology that leads to fast model averaging.",

To eliminate this central bottleneck, they proposed a decentralized model averaging scheme, where each worker performs model averaging by communicating with their adjacent neighbors. Their solutions [9, 10] use variants of a structured topology based on a Regular Ring Lattice (RRL) graph and link weights are set using the Metropolis-Hastings algorithm [14].

The choice of setting link weights for a fixed graph topology are extensively studied in [2, 11, 18]. The convergence is guaranteed, if the averaging matrix is a doubly stochastic transition matrix and has an eigenvalue of 1 and all other eigenvalues are within a unit circle. Furthermore, convergence is inversely proportional to the magnitude of the second largest eigenvalue [1]. Xiao and Boyd [18] showed for an unweighted graph, the best constant link weights are set based on the spectral properties of the graph.

The LS-R2L and R3L based solution consistently show faster epoch-wise convergence for training deep learning models. The WS based solution provides slightly degraded convergence behavior. Structured topologies, such as RRL and RingRandom, perform worse among all the methods and the differences become more pronounced when increasing the number of workers from 32 to 64. This shows that the averaging matrix generated by topologies exhibiting better spectral properties, provides faster convergence on training deep learning models.

We trained deep learning models on 64 workers using Hastings and Laplacian link weights. The figures show relative performance in the form of relative gain, which is the ratio of training loss for Hastings over the training loss for Laplacian weights. The values less than 1 means Laplacian weights are better than Hastings weights and vise versa for values greater than 1. The Laplacian edge weights provide faster convergence than Hastings edge weights for LS-R2L and R3L graphs, whereas WS and RRL Hastings edge weights provide faster convergence. Overall LS-R2L and R3L with Laplacian edge weights show faster convergence than WS and RRL with Hastings edge weights, as shown in the previous section.\n",

The existing literature on decentralized parallel SGD employs hand-crafted structured topologies. We show through experiments that these solutions exhibit worse convergence properties that lead to a suboptimal model averaging solution. We defined an objective function based on the spectral properties of the graph Laplacian for finding an optimal averaging scheme under constraints. As the objective function is intractable, we provided a local search based solution (LS-R2L) for finding a good solution. The averaging matrix obtained through LS-R2L provides the best convergence behavior on image classification benchmark datasets. As a future direction, it would be interesting to apply these methods in heterogeneous systems, where each link between a pair of workers has a different communication cost.",
