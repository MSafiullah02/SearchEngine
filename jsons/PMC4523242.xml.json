Secondary infections by a different DENV serotype could lead to severe clinical manifestations due to antibody dependent enhancement.

            "text": "DENV RNA encodes a single polyprotein which is processed to yield 3 structural proteins, capsid (C), precursor membrane (prM), and envelope (E), and 7 nonstructural (NS) proteins, NS1, NS2A, NS2B, NS3, NS4A, NS4B, and NS5 (Lindenbach et al., 2007). For viral RNA replication, cis-acting RNA elements encoded within the 5\u2032- and 3\u2032-untranslated regions (UTR), coding regions within the N-terminal capsid protein and the C-terminal envelope as well as the 7 NS proteins are sufficient (for excellent reviews, see Lindenbach et al., 2007, Paranjape and Harris, 2010, Villordo and Gamarnik, 2009, Westaway et al., 2003). To study the cis-acting RNA elements and trans-acting viral and host factors required for replication, subgenomic replicons have been constructed for several flaviviruses, Kunjin (Khromykh and Westaway, 1997), WNV (Alcaraz-Estrada et al., 2013, Shi et al., 2002), YFV (Jones et al., 2005a), DENV2 (Alvarez et al., 2005, Jones et al., 2005b, Manzano et al., 2011, Ng et al., 2007), and DENV4 (Alcaraz-Estrada et al., 2010). Stable replicon expressing cell lines have been used in screening antiviral compounds as potential inhibitors of viral replication (for reviews, see Noble et al., 2010, Sampath and Padmanabhan, 2009). Since flavivirus RNA encodes several enzymes that play important roles in the virus life cycle, in vitro assays have been developed for screening antiviral compounds. For example, in vitro assays for the two-component viral protease, NS2B\u2013NS3pro (Lai et al., 2013, Mueller et al., 2008, Yusof et al., 2000), 5\u2032-RNA methyltransferase catalyzed by the N-terminal domain of NS5 (Dong et al., 2008b, Egloff et al., 2002, Ray et al., 2006) and RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) catalyzed by the C-terminal domain of NS5 (Ackermann and Padmanabhan, 2001, Niyomrattanakit et al., 2010, Niyomrattanakit et al., 2011). These assays have been useful to identify inhibitors of protease (Ezgimen et al., 2012, Johnston et al., 2007, Lai et al., 2013), 5\u2032-RNA methyltransferase (Lim et al., 2011; reviewed in Dong et al., 2008b), and RdRp (Niyomrattanakit et al., 2010, Wu et al., 2011, Zou et al., 2011) by small molecule compounds.",

The virus titers from indirect plaque assays (Fig. 4C, open bars) showed significant inhibition of DENV2 infectivity by AQ at 5 \u03bcM similar to the results shown in Fig. 4, A and B. However, in the direct plaque assay, since AQ was present only during adsorption, the plaque titer at 5 \u03bcM AQ was not significantly different from the titer at 1 \u03bcM and its DMSO control (Fig. 4C, stippled bars). These results indicate that AQ at 5 \u03bcM does not inhibit DENV2 adsorption.

            "text": "Amodiaquine (AQ) was synthesized in 1980s by addition of 4-hydroxyanilino group to chloroquine (CQ). AQ was proven effective against chloroquine-resistant strain (reviewed in O\u2019Neill et al., 1998). The drug was later withdrawn from long-term antimalarial prophylaxis due to its rare but serious side effects, agranulocytosis and hepatotoxicity (WHO 1990, reviewed by Olliaro and Mussano, 2003). Cochrane systematic review in 1996, however, supported the use of AQ for treatment of uncomplicated malaria. Besides, an adverse drug reaction study found no significant difference among CQ, AQ, and sulfadoxine/pyrimethamine antimalarials (reviewed by Olliaro and Mussano, 2003). This impact enforced WHO 1997 to modify its recommendation such that AQ became an optional treatment of uncomplicated malaria (reviewed by Olliaro and Mussano, 2003). AQ regimen for antimalarial treatment is 3 days of 600\u2013800 mg/day in an adult. Pharmacogenetic studies have discovered a genetic trait in patient population who are susceptible to an adverse effect of hepatotoxicity due to AQ linked to polymorphisms of CYP2C8 gene, one of the cytochrome P450s. The genetic variants of CYP2C8 gene, CYP2C8\u22172 and CYP2C8\u22173, were reported to be responsible for defective metabolism resulting in slow clearance of AQ (reviewed by Kerb et al., 2009). The genotypes, CYP2C8\u22172 and CYP2C8\u22173, were recorded in African and Caucasian population with the frequency of 11\u201317%, and 15%, respectively. Dose-adjustments of AQ and increased safety precautions are required for treatment of patients with these polymorphisms in order to prevent the intoxication. Given the anti-dengue efficacy shown in this study, AQ is likely to become a powerful candidate for treatment of DENV infected patients.",

Time-course analysis suggested that the drug was stable and reproducibly inhibited DENV2 infectivity up to 96 h post-infection. We also learned that the viral entry and internalization was partially inhibited by the drug but the major effect of drug occurred at a later stage of the viral life cycle up to 15 h post-infection. This effect of AQ at early stages (adsorption/entry) would be absent in replicon-expressing cells and hence the EC50 values are higher (Table 1 and Fig. 2). AQ was also ineffective to inhibit replication that is already established as seen in the time of addition assays. A previous study showed that DENV2 replication starts 12 h post-infection as suggested by rapid increase of intracellular RNA levels in BHK-21 cells quantified by qRT-PCR (Shrivastava et al., 2011). In this study, we have shown that the drug was less effective when added later than 15 h post-infection as measured by viral infectivity (Fig. 4E\u2013F). Based on our results, we conclude that early stages of virus life cycle including translation, assembly of viral replicase complex and initiation of viral RNA replication could be targets of AQ.",

In the study by Farias et al. (2013), the maximum inhibitory effect was seen between 6 and 24 h of incubation whether the CQ was added at 1 h after infection with no further addition, or CQ replenished after 12 and 24 h after initial addition at 1 h. This inhibitory effect of CQ is past the entry and fusion events, well into translation and initiation of replication phases. Moreover, in our study, we provide evidence showing that the profile of inhibition of DENV by CQ is similar to that by AQ (Fig. 5) as the effect of AQ was lost when added after \u223c15\u201320 h post-infection (Fig. 4E and F).",

            "text": "CQ seems to have diverse antiviral effects depending on the virus. For example, in the HIV-1 infection of primary, or established T or monocytes, CQ did not seem to inhibit entry or production of steady state levels of HIV-1 mRNA but did affect the production of HIV-1 virions (Sperber et al., 1993). CQ has been reported to increase the intracellular pH and interferes with prM to M cleavage at the virion maturation step in DENV2 life cycle but 100 \u03bcM concentration was used in that study (Randolph et al., 1990). CQ has been used in other therapeutic applications. For example, CQ is being used in a randomized controlled clinical study for treatment of dengue in Vietnamese adults (Tricou et al., 2010). CQ has also been to have antiviral activities against HIV-1 (Solomon and Lee, 2009, Sperber et al., 1993) and SARS Coronavirus (De Clercq, 2006, Vincent et al., 2005) as well as for treatment of cancer and arthritic diseases. Moreover, ferroquine (FQ), a CQ derivative structurally similar to AQ, inhibited HCV infection at an early step by interfering with fusion (Vausselin et al., 2013) and had minor inhibitory effects on viral replication and assembly. From the currently available data, we conclude that each quinoline compound interferes at a different stage in flaviviral life cycle. Further studies are required to identify the target and precise step that is targeted by AQ as well as derivatives of the drug that are least cytotoxic for treatment of DENV infected patient population.",
