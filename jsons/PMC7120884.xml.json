This is to be used as a tool to guide the delivery of optimal clinical care for patients with sepsis and septic shock. The ABA criteria for definition of sepsis (see Box 4.1) in the burn patients have been established. However, Mann-Salinas and colleagues have challenged the predictive ability of ABA criteria demonstrating that their multivariable model (heart rate >130, MAP <60 mmHg, base deficit <  \u22126 mEq/L, temperature <36 \u00b0C, use of vasoactive medications, and glucose >150 mg/dL) is capable of outperforming the ABA model [48].\n",
