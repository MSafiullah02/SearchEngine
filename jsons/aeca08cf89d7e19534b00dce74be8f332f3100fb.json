            "text": "Human papillomavirus (HPV) is one of the papillomavirus (PVs) families that is reported to infect skin and mucosa of mammals, aves, and reptiles. [1] [2] [3] [4] The cancer causative agent, which was reported in most cervical cancer cases worldwide and the majority of anal and head and throat cancer cases, is HPV. 3, 5 It is the largest family of PVs that includes more than 150 different strains, of which HPV16 is responsible for half the cervical cancer cases worldwide. 2, 3 There are 15 high-risk HPV strains that are reported in cancer cases, which include HPV16, HPV18, HPV31, HPV33, HPV35, HPV39, HPV51, HPV52, HPV56, HPV58, HPV59, HPV68, HPV69, HPV73, and HPV82. 4, 6 HPV is a nonenveloped double-stranded DNA virus that has two structural capsid proteins, L1 (major capsid) and L2 (minor capsid), responsible for viral entry into the host cell. 4, 7 HPV target the heparin sulfate proteoglycans (HSPGs) of the basal cell epithelium. 7, 8 The L1 capsid protein of HPV is the primary element that recognizes HSPGs. 7, 8 After recognition, conformational changes in L1 mediated by different host cell receptors and chaperones leads to endocytosis of the virion. 1, 6, 7 HPV travels to the nucleus to replicate its DNA through localization in separate host cell compartments, including the endosome, Golgi apparatus, and endoplasmic reticulum (ER). 7, 9 E6 is one of the nonstructural proteins of HPV that was reported to be the causative element of cancer cell proliferation. 10 It binds to   oncoproteins crucial for cancer development like p53 and p105Rb oncoproteins, leading to its degradation. 1, 7, 10, 11 Different viral (E6 associated protein [E6-AP] and E6^E7 splice isoform) and host-cell (HSP90 and GRP78 chaperones) proteins are reported to bind to and stabilize the E6 protein of HPV16, increasing its presence times in vivo. 1 Glucose regulating protein 78 (GRP78), is the master player of the unfolded protein response mechanism in the ER. 12 It is a heat shock protein 70 family member, a chaperone protein, that regulates cell response under unfolded protein load stress. [13] [14] [15] [16] GRP78 is localized in the lumen of the ER bound to and inactivating other enzymes responsible for cell response under accumulated unfolded proteins that include activating transcription factor 6 (ATF6), protein kinase RNA-like endoplasmic reticulum kinase (PERK), and inositolrequiring enzyme 1 (IRE1). 17 Upon cell stress, like a viral infection or cancer, the GRP78 releases ATF6, PERK, and IRE1 due to the accumulation of unfolded proteins leading to inhibition of protein synthesis and enhancement of refolding. 17, 18 Besides this, cell stress leads to the upregulation of GRP78 and subsequently its escape from ER retention, translocating to the cell surface (cell-surface GRP78).",

The retrieved 330 sequences of HPV E6 were represented with the aid of the ESPript 3.0 web server 36 after alignment with Clustal Omega. As shown in Figure S1 , three CxxC motifs are very well conserved among all the HPV E6 sequences. These motifs represent the Zn finger domains present in HPV E6 crucial for its stabilization (homodimerization) and function. 1, 37 Besides this, the motif LxxVxxxDxxxFAxC shows high sequence conservation among the aligned sequences and is surface accessible. This motif lies in the \u03b2-hairpin fold (PDB ID: 4XR8), like the Pep42 model, and is suggested to be the binding site to GRP78.

Interestingly, the N-terminal of the HPV E6 lies near the suggested binding site of HPV E6 (Figure 4B). Further molecular dynamics study is needed to check the contribution of this N-terminal region in GRP78 binding.HPV is the primary causative agent for cervical cancer and other related diseases. The viral protein E6 is the primary oncogenic protein signal that promotes p53 degradation. Preventing such binding is crucial in fighting against, this cancer-promoting, viral infection.GRP78 is said to cause E6 stabilization in vivo among other host cell and viral proteins. Once bound to GRP78, the HPV E6 is stabilized (saved from the degradation through host cell machinery and proteasome degradation pathway). E6 destabilization is reported to be a cancer-preventing strategy. Inhibiting the GRP78-E6 association would help in cancer cessation after the identification of the binding site. The present work suggests the GRP78-E6 binding site using in silico techniques. Further dynamic simulations and experimental work are required to prove our hypothesis; besides, this study paves the way for exploring GRP78-E6 binding inhibitors to fight against this cancer-promoting viral infection.",
