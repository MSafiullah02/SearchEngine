            "text": "Symptoms of viral upper respiratory infection (URI) usually overlap with those of allergic rhinitis (AR), such as nasal obstruction, rhinorrhea, and sneezing. Patients with AR mistakenly believe they have repeated viral infections that manifest as the common cold. Furthermore, it is difficult to differentiate the symptoms of AR aggravation from viral URI symptoms. Although the 2 are clearly distinctive, they share common clinical features. The pathogenetic relation between the 2 conditions is not fully understood. It is theoretically possible that allergen-induced inflammation and mucosal swelling in the nasal cavity and paranasal sinuses of patients with AR may make them more susceptible to viral or bacterial infections.[1], [2] Despite these assumptive inter-relations between the 2 conditions, the role of respiratory viruses as an aggravating factor of AR has not been established. Some previous studies have focused only on the severity of URI symptoms in patients with AR. In 1 cohort study, adult patients with AR showed not only a higher incidence of respiratory infections, especially in the number of severe episodes, but also a longer total duration of respiratory infection compared with adult patients without allergy.3 In contrast, a prospective study has reported that there are no significant differences in the frequency and duration of URI between adult patients with AR and patients without allergy.4\n",

However, to date, the exact pathogenetic role of respiratory viruses present in the upper airway of patients with AR has not been elucidated. Therefore, in this study, as a basic step for better understanding the role of respiratory viruses in the pathogenesis of AR, the detection rate of respiratory viruses in patients with perennial AR (PAR) without URI symptoms was compared with that in control patients, and the symptom severity of AR was evaluated according to the presence of respiratory viruses.",

Briefly, 3 \u03bcL of synthesized first-strand cDNA, 5\u00d7 RV15 primer mix, 2\u00d7 multiplex master mix (Taq DNA polymerase and dNTPs are included), and 3 \u03bcL of 8-methoxypsoralen solution were added. The primer mixes contained the internal control template and the primer pair to validate the PCR. Three reactions (primer mixes A, B, and C) were set up for each sample according to the kit instructions. Specific primer targets for each respiratory virus are listed in Table 1\n. PCR was carried out using the following reaction conditions: initial denaturation at 94\u00b0C for 15 minutes; 40 cycles at 94\u00b0C for 30 seconds, 60\u00b0C for 1 minute 30 seconds, and 72\u00b0C for 1 minute 30 seconds; and a final extension phase at 72\u00b0C for 10 minutes.

It has been reported that the Seeplex detection kit has high sensitivity and specificity comparable to the conventional viral culture. Coinfection was better detected by the multiplex PCR kit than by viral culture and immunofluorescence.14 The overall detection rate of a respiratory virus was higher in patients with PAR than in controls. Specifically, a larger proportion of patients with respiratory virus\u2013positive PAR had multiple viruses in their nasal lavage fluid compared with control patients without allergy. Although the clinical significance of multiple virus detection is debatable, the impaired innate immune response in patients with allergy could lead to multiple viral infections. Some researchers have reported that patients with allergic asthma and/or AR have impaired innate immune responses to respiratory viral infections.[15], [16], [17], [18] Impaired interferon production associated with allergic sensitization may increase susceptibility to respiratory viral infection and compromise viral clearance, leading to long-term viral shedding.",

These results suggest that HRV could play a major role in the pathogenesis of AR or exist for a long period in an inflammatory state. In addition to HRV, the detection rate of PIV was relatively high in nasal lavage samples from the PAR and control groups, showing no significant difference between the 2 groups. This finding may be due to tropism of PIV to epithelial cells.23\n",

However, in this study, there was no statistically significant association between AR symptom scores (TNSS) and the presence of respiratory viruses. This result suggests that patients with respiratory virus\u2013positive PAR might not have more severe allergic symptoms compared with patients with respiratory virus\u2013negative PAR. This result may be influenced by the use of oral antihistamine in the PAR group. Because discontinuation of oral antihistamine was not tolerable for the PAR group, this treatment could not be stopped in these study patients.",

Therefore, this study was still valuable in showing a relation between adult patients with PAR and the presence of respiratory viruses. To the authors' knowledge, there has been no previous study that has investigated the detection of respiratory viruses in patients with PAR who have no evidence of viral URI.
