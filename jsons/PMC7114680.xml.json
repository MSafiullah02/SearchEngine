To help to resolve this issue, it has become important to understand the proportion of infectious diseases potentially transmitted via the airborne route.",

The buoyant exhaled plumes moved an average horizontal distance of 0.4\u20130.5 m. These results have led to some recommendations for the use of such respiratory support procedures to be avoided, which has in turn led to some controversy about the relative risk:benefit ratio of applying a potentially life-saving intervention that may subsequently result in secondary infections in healthcare staff and other patients nearby.52, 53 Hui et al. do point out that their respiratory model has limitations and can only illustrate the movement of air. It cannot and does not attempt to estimate the actual number or sizes of particles that may carry potentially infectious organisms within such airflows. Therefore using these results to preclude the use of such potentially life-saving, respiratory support interventions is premature.",

It is difficult to state a typical resolution, but most relevant calculations run to resolutions of 1\u20133 million elements; for a typical isolation room (of 5 m \u00d7 4 m \u00d7 3 m) the mesh elements are therefore about the size of a house brick.

Flow is described by the Navier\u2013Stokes equation, a mathematical description of the conservation of momentum (Newton\u2019s second law of motion). Since room airflow is turbulent with scales or vortices smaller than the mesh elements, a degree of approximation is required to model these processes through the specification of a turbulence model. As rooms generally include people and equipment it is usually necessary to include equations of energy conservation to simulate the influence of heat sources and temperature gradients on air convection within the space.",

Areas of interest in infection control primarily focus on the transport, deposition and survival of airborne micro-organisms and it is necessary to consider the models and approaches that are specific to this scenario. The behaviour of bioaerosols is generally represented in two ways: as a passive scalar (i.e. a tracer that moves with the airflow; Figure 1) or as discrete particles modelled using an equation of motion, which describes the balance of buoyancy and aerodynamic drag forces; Figure 3). Passive tracers tend to be more suited to respiratory pathogens and have been used in many studies, for example, evaluating how ventilation design and ward layout may reduce TB transmission risks, and showing that the predicted bioaerosol distribution in a hospital ward during a SARS outbreak correlated with the spatial pattern of infections. Particle models are used where pathogens may be carried on larger particles such as shed epithelial skin cells or where the evaporation or the deposition of particles is of interest.1, 85, 86, 91, 92, 93, 94 Both tracer approaches can also incorporate biological factors such as natural decay or inactivation due to decontamination processes. For example, CFD modelling of UV-C irradiation incorporating an experimentally derived decay function into the passive scalar tracer model has enabled the simulation of the behavior of UV disinfection devices at room scale and showed the importance of the interaction of the UV field with the airflow.95, 96\n",

In terms of spatial location, respiratory pathogens, released in the exhaled breath of a patient, are generally modelled using a small zone or point source, with the release characterised by specifying a velocity and pathogen concentration.45, 86, 90, 97, 98 Pathogens released through activity will be dispersed over a much wider area and hence should be released over a representative zone. This approach has been applied in studies of operating theatre ventilation, releasing tracers from the surfaces of people, to demonstrate the effect of factors such as the position of operating theatre lamps and people on the airborne contamination level.87, 99 Application to ward activities such as bed-making has also shown that the specification of the source has a major influence on the results.91 Duration of release is also an important consideration. In the real world, pathogens will not be released continuously into a space, but such transient (or periodic) analysis using CFD simulation adds considerably to the time and cost of the computations. As such, steady-state solutions are favoured by most researchers and the \u2018worst case\u2019 scenario of a continuous release is often presented. It is important that this simplification is recognised when evaluating the results of such simulations. After running the software to calculate the flow and movement of droplets/particles, the results are analysed using various visual and quantitative post-processing techniques. Care is taken to choose the most appropriate diagnostics as the amount of data generated by running such simulations is potentially enormous (Figure 3).",

In the engineering community, it is common practice to employ a physical analogue which has the same geometry as the problem under consideration but the analogue may be significantly smaller or larger. For this analogue to work, the characteristic flow patterns in the model and real-life flow patterns need to be the same or similar. For flows where buoyancy effects are not important, the key quantity is a dimensionless measure, the Reynolds number, which defines the relative strength of inertial to viscous forces in the flow. For sufficiently large Reynolds numbers, such as turbulent air mixing in a well-ventilated space, the mean flows in both the model and the real scenario will be equivalent. For situations where buoyancy forces are important, such as natural ventilation flows, the equivalence is acceptable, providing the Froude number (a dimensionless measure of the relative strength of inertial to buoyancy forces) is matched. When applied to studying flows in hospitals, it is usual to employ 1:10 scale-models constructed out of acrylic, using water as a working fluid (Figure 4\n).101 The advantage of using water as an air analogue is that the water can carry tracer particles (or dye) which can be illuminated and visualised relatively easily. Experiments can be recorded with one or more cameras to capture simultaneous, real-time images from different angles.101\n",

            "text": "The application of tracer gas is the most common alternative approach that can be used to acquire quantitative data on ventilation rates and airflow, as well as having the capacity to be released in such a way as to mimic an infectious aerosolised source.107 Tracer gases (including CO2, N2O and SF6) have been employed in general indoor air studies as well as healthcare-specific scenarios. Among the many examples, studies have included assessing the performance of naturally ventilated tuberculosis (TB) isolation wards using a CO2 tracer, assessing the performance of isolation rooms and operating theatres using N2O and SF6 tracers, and evaluating the effect of the ventilation system on the risk of transmission between patients in ward environments.54, 103, 108, 109, 110, 111 Although this approach gives a better insight into contaminant transport, it has been acknowledged that tracer gases may not fully represent bioaerosols, particularly those released as larger droplets.103, 112 Pioneering work in healthcare ventilation showed that potassium iodide could be applied as a tracer with particles collected on membranes and subsquently visualised.112 Application of this approach to transfer between patients in an isolation ward indicated the need for better airflow control and good agreement with theoretical models.113, 114 Andersson et al. also used potassium iodide to study operating theatre ventilation, showing the role of activity on the airflow distribution in the room.103 Other early work applied in indoor and outdoor air used fluorescent particle tracers, enumerated visually or via electro-optical detection.115 More recent studies have used a range of particle tracers including sodium chloride and latex beads, enumerated directly using optical techniques such as laser particle counters rather than visual or chemical approaches.109, 116, 118 Direct comparison with bioaerosols has also been carried out, evaluating mixing and ventilation rates in an isolation room context measured using tracer gases, against NaCl particles and biological aerosols containing Bacillus subtilis or Staphylococcus aureus bacteria.109, 117 Results have shown good comparison across all tracers indicating that tracer gases and inert particles are both suitable surrogates, certainly for small (<2 \u03bcm) bioaerosols. An important consideration in real or mock-up studies is the safety of researchers and the public exposed to such tracers, which must be carefully assessed. While some tracer gases (CO2, N2O) have health implications at high concentrations, the ability to conduct experiments with live micro-organisms is generally much more challenging. Although some early studies dispersed bacteria in occupied indoor environments and outdoors as part of biological warfare programmes, modern work is restricted to specialist facilities or studies sampling the background microflora in an environment.102, 103, 104, 119, 120, 121, 122, 123\n",

Many require extensive and costly equipment and realistic measurements can only be made at a limited number of points. They are also time consuming, with the need to reduce the tracer to background levels prior to the next experiment. It is therefore important that this is considered in the experimental design and acknowledged in analysing the results and final conclusions. Carrying out such experimental studies in conjunction with CFD simulations can offer a greater insight, enabling the validation of the modelling approach and the evaluation of aspects of the airflow that cannot be captured by the experiments alone.",

Thus, to understand how infectious material spreads through the air it is important to use techniques that enable the air movement to be visualised and quantified in space and time. This rationale is already reflected in the many existing guidelines on general ward infection control, the construction and monitoring of infectious isolation rooms and laboratory biosafety cabinets. These techniques allow the tracking of air movements from potential sources of infection, e.g. human coughs, oxygen masks, door opening/closing. However, such techniques cannot answer the many other relevant questions related to aerosol or airborne infection, such as what proportion of transmission of an infection occurs via the aerosol or airborne route, what proportion of such suspended infectious agents are still viable, and what is the infectious dose to be inhaled to cause disease (not just infection) in any individual for any infectious agent. Yet, effective, accurate airflow visualisation techniques are an essential component to further the understanding of how aerosolised or airborne infection may be transmitted and, equally importantly, how they may be prevented or at least reduced.",
