Although the existence of an anticommons effect (see Glossary) of patents 7, 8 has not been validated by comprehensive empirical data, it is pertinent to reflect on ways to remedy this in the event that facts and cases arise that substantiate such an effect.",

            "text": "In an attempt to deal with any potential anticompetitive effects of multiparty licensing agreements, such as patent pools, both the US antitrust agencies and the European Commission have established guidelines. The US antitrust agencies have developed the Antitrust Guidelines for the Licensing of Intellectual Property (IP Licensing Guidelines)\n[14]. In the European Union, the major competition laws (see Glossary) relating to technology licensing are laid down in the Commission Block Exemption Regulation (EC) No. 772/2004 on Technology Transfer Agreements\n[15] and the Guidelines on the Application of Article 81 of the EC Treaty to Technology Transfer Agreements\n[16]. Recently, the Japanese Fair Trade Commission issued its Guidelines on Standardization and Patent Pool Arrangements\n[17], which apply the same general principles. Close examination of foregoing guidelines, regulations and related decisions provides valuable information on the attitude of the US, European [18] and Japanese authorities towards patent pools. In short, patent pools should avoid creating anticompetitive restraints and will most probably be accepted if they meet the conditions set out in Box 1\n.Box 1Checklist for a patent pool arrangement\n\u2022\nValidity of the patents: a patent is valid from the date of grant until the date of expiration, as defined by law, which is usually 20 years from the date of the filing provided the annual maintenance fees are paid.\u2022\nEssentiality of the patents: a technology or patent is deemed to be essential if there are no substitutes for that technology inside or outside the pool and the technology in question constitutes a necessary part of the package of technologies for the purposes of producing the product(s) or carrying out the process(es) to which the pool relates.\u2022\nIndependent expert: an independent expert identifies and evaluates the essential patents related to the technology.\u2022\nNon-exclusive licenses to the pool: a license is non-exclusive when one or more licensees are granted the right to use licensed technology covered by the patent(s) during the term of the license and when the licensor retains the right to use the licensed technology and the associated patent(s) as well.\u2022\nAlternative technologies: licensees are free to develop and use alternative technologies.\u2022\nGrantback provisions: a licensee should grant the licensor non-exclusive licenses for improvements on the licensed technology. This should be limited to essential patents and be settled on reasonable terms in order not to discourage further innovation.\u2022\nRoyalty allocation formula: royalties are distributed among the licensors according to an agreed allocation formula set forth in the patent pool agreement.\u2022\nFRAND terms: royalties paid to the pool by the licensees should be fair, reasonable and non-discriminatory (the so-called FRAND terms), and licenses granted by the pool should be non-exclusive.\u2022\nSafeguards for sensitive business information: competitively sensitive business information on the licensee is safeguarded in case auditing mechanisms for the management of royalties are established.\u2022\nMechanism for dispute resolution: an independent and, therefore, neutral dispute resolution mechanism in the agreements setting up the pool is desirable.\nThese are based on the guidelines laid down by the US IP Licensing Guidelines and Business Review Letters, the EU Transfer of Technology Guidelines and individual decisions, and the Japanese Guidelines on Standardization and Patent Pool Arrangements.",

The Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD; www.oecd.org) considers the concept of a patent pool to be an interesting one for biotechnology but has some doubts as to whether the technologies and markets for genetic inventions are amenable to patent pools [20]. The medical biotechnology industry is perceived as fundamentally different from the electronics and telecommunications sectors, particularly as the generation of standards, as used in electronics and telecommunications, for the interoperability of electronic devices is seen as a strong incentive for setting up a patent pool. In the absence of this type of standard-driven incentive, dominant players in the biotech industry might be reluctant to join a pool because there is no apparent gain. Additionally, biotech companies rely heavily on their patent portfolio, and foster what has been called a bunker mentality: a defensive attitude focused on self-protection and secrecy [19]. In light of these considerations, the OECD recommends further study [20]. In the meantime, some valuable contributions to the debate, which focus on the importance of standard setting for diagnostic testing, have been reported 21, 22.",

Potrykus wanted to transfer the Golden Rice materials to developing countries for further breeding, and to introduce the trait into the local varieties consumed in developing countries. However, a freedom-to-operate survey initially uncovered 70 patents, belonging to 32 different companies and universities, embedded in Golden Rice. The six key-patent holders were approached, and an agreement was reached that allowed Potrykus to grant licenses, free of charge, to developing countries, with the right to sub-license (press releases 16 May 2000; 22 January 2001; and 14 October 2004; see www.syngentia.com). Consequently, a humanitarian board (HumBo; www.goldenrice.org) was established as a voluntary association to assist in the associated governance and decision making [25]. So far, approximately 20 master licenses have been granted to institutions in developing countries in Asia (Anatole F. Krattiger, personal communication).",

In some cases, such as hereditary non-polyposis colorectal cancer (HNPCC), the disease can be caused by a variety of mutations in one gene, or by one or more mutations in several genes. The diagnosis of HNPCC in a particular family is, in part, based on molecular genetic testing for germline mutations in one of the mismatch-repair (MMR) genes. Typically, patients are being tested for mutations in two or more out of four candidate genes (MLH1, MSH2, MSH6, and PMS2; see review of HNPCC on www.genetests.org). However, other genes involved in the MMR pathway have been reported to be associated with HNPCC (e.g. MLH2, MLH3, PMS1, MSH3, MSH5, MYH; see OMIM entries on http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/query.fcgi?db=OMIM), and the number of genes identified as being involved in familial colorectal cancer is expected to grow. Some of these newly identified genes might soon be included on the shortlist for routine testing, and, as various patents have been filed, it is possible that overlapping patents might occur on the genetic data necessary to test for HNPCC. Should a patent thicket arise, an HNPCC patent pool, encompassing essential genomic patents, could help to eliminate the thicket and render proprietary genomic data more accessible for use. Additionally, such a patent pool should be considered a dynamic model with regard to both size and use, whereby the size and content of the pool will differ over time: competition law requires that additional essential patents, once granted, will enter the pool (e.g. relating to other genes with a role in the same pathology and on particular mutations in those genes) and others will disappear when no longer valid. Furthermore, the granting of licenses to a subset of patents should also be possible. Here, some genetic laboratories offering testing for the clinical condition as a whole might be interested in the entire pool, whereas other laboratories might only be interested in a license to a subset of patents in the pool, a subset of disease genes or mutations (which are of specific interest in view of the geographical heterogeneity of the distribution of mutations), a specific gene, or a particular mutation for the development of an antibody or another therapeutic or research tool. In addition, the licenses granted by the pool should be non-exclusive and non-discriminatory, thereby imposing fair and reasonable conditions and royalty rates.",

Patent pools might constitute the ideal means for raising the visibility and accessibility of smaller or public genetic laboratories and, thus, increase the actual amount of collected royalties, bridging the gap between potential and actual revenue. For example, some laboratories still use in-house methods to test for cystic fibrosis, although several appropriate kits are available commercially. For some genes, the diagnostic method for the detection of mutations is less amenable to the production of a commercial kit, which is presently the case for breast and ovarian cancer, tuberous sclerosis and neurofibromatosis. In such instances, litigation is difficult because data informing on the number of tests being performed are hard to find and legal action is costly; however, the introduction of one-stop licenses, through the establishment of patent pools, might promote a spontaneous registration by the users and simplify the collection of license fees.",

In order for a patent pool to be an effective solution, the right balance has to be achieved between the cost of creating a pool and the prospect of adequate revenue generated by royalties on the end-product. It remains to be seen whether a diagnostic-gene patent pool covering only one disease syndrome will reach such a balance, and to what extent small size pools will prove to be viable. Extending those pools to a wider range of, or to all, genetic disorders could prove to be more useful from an economic or a clearing point of view but might lead to some delicate problems from the perspective of competition law.",
