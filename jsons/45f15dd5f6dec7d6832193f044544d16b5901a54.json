This is because noroviruses have not yet been grown in the laboratory. During the last decade a great deal of information has been gained about the ecology and survival of phages of marine microorganisms (Wommack & Colwell, 2000) . This has provided new information on potential mechanisms of virus persistence that may be useful in understanding the survival of human pathogenic viruses. However, it must be remembered that human enteric viruses are not native to this environment and the relative importance of factors affecting inactivation may be different between the two groups of viruses.",

Temperature is the only well-defined factor with a consistent effect on virus survival. At freezing or near-freezing temperatures, viruses may remain infectious for many months (Lo et al., 1976) . Compared to many other viral groups that infect man, enteric viruses are usually heat stable. Hepatitis A virus, adenoviruses and parvoviruses appear to be the most thermostable enteric viruses (Crance et al., 1998; Brauniger et al., 2000; Gerba, unpublished observations) .",

Certain cations in solution appear to protect some viruses from thermoinactivation, while having the opposite effect on other viruses. Thus, rotavirus SA-11 is more rapidly inactivated by heating at 50 \u2022 C in 2 M MgCl 2 , while reovirus type 1 infectivity is stabilized (Estes et al., 1979) . In contrast, SA-11 infectivity is stabilized at 50 \u2022 C in the presence of 2 M MgSO 4 . At high temperatures, poliovirus type 1 is more stable in seawater than in distilled water (Liew & Gerba, 1980) , indicating that salts in natural waters may have some stabilizing effect on virus survival.",

However, more recent studies on phage indigenous (virioplankton) to the marine environment suggests that they could play a significant role even at depths as great as 200 m (Suttle & Chen, 1992; Wommack & Colwell, 2000) . Even in turbid estuarine waters, a modest effect of sunlight on viral decay can occur at a depth of 2.5 m (Cottrell & Suttle, 1995) . Light wavelengths of <320 (UV-B) have the greatest virucidal effect on virioplankton (Murray & Jackson, 1993) . The effect of bacteriophage viability in seawater is directly proportional to the amount of sunlight (Garza & Suttle, 1998) . A recent study demonstrated that several enteroviruses were inactivated more rapidly in seawater in the presence of sunlight than in the dark (Fujioka & Yoneyama, 2002) . The rate of inactivation was much less in the winter than summer. The double stranded DNA viruses are significantly much more resistant to UV light inactivation than the enteroviruses, because they can use host cell repair enzymes to repair the UV light damage (Gerba et al., 2002) .",

In photodynamic inactivation, the virus is \"sensitized\" to photoxidation by interaction of the viral genome with certain substances . Numerous synthetic dyes and natural substances, such as ligins, fulvic acids, humic acids, and vitamins, may act as photosensitizers. Dyes adsorb radiation and selectively transfer that energy to dissolved oxygen, which is excited to its highly oxidized state. Environmental factors, such as pH, temperature, time, and dye concentration, largely control the sensitization of the virus by the photosensitizer. The length of light exposure and its intensity can also influence the rate of virus inactivation (Gerba et al., 1977b) . The process is not inhibited by dissolved organics and readily takes place in seawater. Damage to the virus is cumulative. A photodynamic antiviral substance has been demonstrated in algae cells (Fukada et al., 1968) , giving support to the idea that photochemical reactions may be important to viral inactivation in natural waters.",

The greater antiviral activity of seawater compared to freshwater appears to be related to the presence of bacteria indigenous to seawater (Fujioka et al., 1980) . A bacterium identified as Vibrio marinus was isolated which exhibited antiviral activity, but unfortunately this activity was lost while maintaining the organism under in vitro conditions (Gundersen et al., 1967) . Another marine bacteria classified, belonging to the genus Moraxella, was isolated from Mediterranean Sea and was able to retain its antivirus activity after passage in the laboratory (Girones et al., 1989) . The virus-inactivating agent could not be separated from the viable marine bacteria, indicating that the active agent(s) either remained associated with the organism, or had a very short lifetime, or both. The antiviral activity of the organism was highly specific for poliovirus. No antiviral activity was found against the other groups of enteroviruses, rotavirus SA-11, or phages of (Toranzo et al., 1982) . Culture filtrates of these organisms gave virus inactivation rates comparable with those obtained with whole cultures suggesting that extracellular products are involved in the antiviral activity. Further studies suggested that viral inactivation takes place by deformation or denaturation of a critical site(s) in the capsid followed by enzymatic degradation (Toranzo et al., 1983) .",

Clays such as kaolinite are capable of sorbing a great variety of inorganic and organic ions or other substances that could inactivate viruses (Gerba & Schaiberger, 1975) . As an example, bentonite clays have been shown to protect viruses against inactivation by ribonuclease by the adsorption of this enzyme to the clay (Singer & Fraenkel-Conrat, 1961) . Another explanation of the protective effect of clay could be the formation of an envelope of clay particles around the virus, which would prevent contact of the virus with virucidal agents (Roper & Marshall, 1978) . Marine sediments and clays also protect viruses against thermal inactivation in seawater (Liew & Gerba, 1980) . Some types of particulate matter in natural waters may also be antagonoistic to viral survival (Gerba & Schaiberger, 1975) . Surfaces such as SiO 2 have little effect on virus survival, but metal oxide surfaces such as CuO, substantially decrease viral infectivity during adsorptionelution (Murray & Laband, 1979) .",
