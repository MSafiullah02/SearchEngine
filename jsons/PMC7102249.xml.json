The RV, once considered a passive conduit of blood and a bystander in disease, is now recognized to play an important role in determining the outcome of many patients admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) [1\u20133]. Acute dysfunction of the RV, irrespective of baseline pulmonary vascular resistance (PVR), has been a well-recognized entity in ICU patients with septic shock and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) [4, 5]. The decompensation of the RV function is detrimental to survival, especially in patients with pulmonary hypertension (PH) who often have compromised RV function at baseline [6]. Despite the better understanding and available therapies for PH, the mortality of patients admitted to the ICU with decompensated PH and right ventricular failure (RVF) remains unacceptably high [7\u201310]. This review will describe the epidemiology, evaluation, and management of patients requiring hospitalization and ICU admission for decompensated PH and RVF.",

Recent literature estimates the prevalence of group 1 (PAH) which is around 15 per million people [12, 13]. Left heart disease is the most common cause of PH and comprises group 2 with an estimated 25\u2013100 % of patients with left heart disease having PH [14]. Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is the most common cause of group 3 PH, with prevalence varying with disease severity. Over 90 % of patients with severe COPD have a mean pulmonary artery pressure (mPAP) > 20 mmHg, and 3\u20135 % have mPAP > 35\u201340 mmHg [15, 16]. Chronic thromboembolic pulmonary hypertension (CTEPH), group 4, occurs in up to 3.8 % of patients suffering from an acute pulmonary embolism (PE) with an estimated prevalence of 3.2 cases per million adults [15\u201317]. Group 5 includes patients with PH from multifactorial mechanisms with an unknown prevalence. As a whole, groups 2\u20135 are more common than group 1 and can progress to RVF conveying a higher mortality risk [18\u201321].\n",

The most frequent causes of decompensation are infection, anemia, trauma, surgery, unplanned modification or withdrawal of pulmonary vasodilator therapy, unplanned withdrawal of diuretics, cardiac arrhythmias, pregnancy, and PE.

RVF secondary to PE has a much better prognosis compared to decompensated PH in a patient with underlying connective tissue disease (CTD) [10].

The height of the jugular venous distention and the quality of the venous wave pattern should be assessed (elevated a vs. v wave). The distance from the sternal angle to the top of the waveform is measured in centimeters, and by convention, the distance between the right atrium (RA) and the sternal angle is added (approximately 5 cm) [24]. Auscultation of the lungs is usually unremarkable unless an underlying condition exists (COPD, pulmonary fibrosis, ARDS). Patients often have tender, palpable hepatomegaly, ascites, and peripheral edema. Cyanosis and digital clubbing may be seen, especially in patients with chronic hypoxemia.

The TR jet or the pulmonary regurgitation jet velocities, in conjunction with an estimated RA pressure, are used to calculate the right ventricular systolic pressure (RVSP). RVSP correlates well with systolic PAP in the absence of pulmonary stenosis and can diagnose PH with a sensitivity of 83 % and specificity of 72 % (Fig. 5) [50, 51]. However, about 10\u201325 % of patients will have an insufficient spectral Doppler profile of the TR jet to measure the RV to RA pressure gradient; in these instances, the presence of right heart chamber enlargement or septal flattening suggests elevated right heart pressures [52, 53].\n\n\n",

Similar response to fluid loading has been described in patients with RVF caused by massive PE [79]. The clinician must exert caution because excessive fluid administration in patients with increased PVR can have adverse effects that are explained by the phenomenon of ventricular interdependence (displacement of the interventricular septum toward the LV leading to decreased LV preload as seen in Fig. 4) and increased RV free-wall tension that result in increased myocardial oxygen consumption and decreased perfusion [80\u201383].

In animal studies, doses > 10 \u03bcg/Kg/min were associated with increased PVR and hypotension [85]. The clinician must be aware of the latter complication that often necessitates vasopressors. Dobutamine is more effective than norepinephrine at improving CO, but it can increase the shunt fraction (venous admixture) affecting oxygenation (PaO2).

Once inhaled, it diffuses across the alveolar capillary membrane into the smooth muscle of the pulmonary vessels and is rapidly inactivated by hemoglobin [131, 132]. iNO decreases PVR, has a neutral effect on SVR, and increases CO [133, 134]. In patients with RVF secondary to ARDS, iNO decreases PAP, increases PaO2 by improving the ventilation perfusion relationship, and may decrease inflammatory cytokine production in the lungs [135\u2013137]. iNO improves oxygenation with lower doses than those required to decrease mPAP, but it can have the opposite effect on oxygenation at higher doses [138]. Small studies have shown that iNO produces hemodynamic improvement in different settings of RVF including those caused by RV infarct, acute PE, post-surgical, post-left ventricular assist device (LVAD) implantation, and cardiac transplantation [139\u2013155]. Complications encountered with the use of iNO include: accumulation of potentially toxic reactive metabolites, rebound PH, and rarely methemoglobinemia [156\u2013161]. Despite reducing afterload and improving hypoxemia in RVF and ARDS, there is no demonstrated survival benefit [162\u2013164]. Combination of iNO and prostacyclin derivatives has been reported with success in the perioperative management of portopulmonary hypertension (PoPH) and in RVF after high-risk cardiac surgery, LVAD insertion, and pulmonary endarterectomy [165\u2013169].",

These drugs act on the prostacyclin receptor (present in platelets and endothelial cells) that produces an increase in cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP), resulting in inhibition of platelet aggregation, relaxation of smooth muscle, and vasodilation of the pulmonary arteries [182]. Prostacyclin derivatives decrease PVR and increase CO and exercise capacity in patients with PAH and have been used successfully in the perioperative setting in cardiac surgery and thoracic transplant [183\u2013194]. In the setting of life-threatening PE, inhaled aerosolized prostacyclin was associated with a transient improvement in pulmonary hemodynamics and gas exchange [195]. In ARDS, inhaled prostacyclins have been associated with important physiologic benefits (improved hypoxemia, lower PAP, and improved RV function and CO) with no systemic hemodynamic effects given the aerosolized alveolar delivery. Unfortunately, there is no evidence supporting outcome benefits and, although controversial, its use should be reserved as a rescue therapy in refractory hypoxemia associated with ARDS [196\u2013198].",

Atrial flutter and fibrillation are the most common arrhythmias in this population, whereas bradyarrhythmias and ventricular arrhythmias are rare except in the setting of cardiac arrest [222]. The RV is very sensitive to abnormalities in cardiac rhythm and synchrony. In RVF, augmented RA contraction and intact atrioventricular (AV) synchrony are important determinants of CO. The augmented RA contractility constitutes a compensatory response to RV dysfunction [223]. Restoration of AV synchrony produced positive hemodynamic results in patients with RV infarct and congenital heart disease [224\u2013229]. AV pacing in patients with right bundle-branch block and RV dysfunction augments RV and systemic performance [230]. Although there are no large-scale studies to support resynchronization therapy in RVF, this intervention could be considered as part of the management.",

A higher number of patients can be considered for heart transplantation after LVAD therapy with a possible benefit in post-transplant survival [231\u2013236]. Although beneficial for the RV in the long term, LVADs can exacerbate or cause new-onset RVF because the decrease in LV end-diastolic volume will shift the interventricular septum to the left, increasing the RV end-diastolic volume, compromising its contractility [237]. Approximately 6\u201310 % of patients with a LVAD will require the implantation of a RVAD [238].",

During delivery, pain, anxiety, raised levels of catecholamine and uterine contractions produce an increase in CO. After delivery, the venous return increases significantly as a result of the involution of the uterus producing a sizeable increase in CO. Patients with normal PVR can readily tolerate these changes through vasodilation and recruitment of pulmonary vessels, whereas patients with PH cannot adapt making them prone to develop acute RVF [249]. Consequently, the mortality rate, albeit lower than in previous times, remains very high ranging from 17 to 28 %, with most complications occurring in the peripartum period [250, 251].",

Recent literature reports a more frequent use of CS and a higher proportion of premature deliveries; this change in practice may be explained by closer surveillance and a lower threshold for intervention in cases of maternal deterioration or fetal distress [251]. A multidisciplinary team including the cardiac anesthesiologist, obstetrician, and neonatologist should be involved if a CS is the chosen route of delivery. The PH patient should undergo close monitoring during the peripartum period with particular attention to arterial oxygenation, cardiac rhythm, and hemodynamics. The use of invasive monitoring devices seems reasonable and should be considered on a case-by-case basis [252, 253]. Successful outcomes have been reported with the use of various pulmonary vasodilators during the peripartum period including epoprostenol, iNO, and combination of sildenafil and epoprostenol [254\u2013259].",

The acute increase in CO at the time of reperfusion cannot be handled by the RV of the patient with PoPH leading to acute RVF [262]. The evaluation of risk, indications for advanced therapy, and contraindications to liver transplant are based on hemodynamic variables including mPAP and PVR. A mPAP > 50 is considered a contraindication for liver transplant, whereas a mPAP <35 is considered safe [263, 264]. Pulmonary vasodilators are used in the management of PoPH to improve hemodynamics. Several small studies report the use of prostacyclin analogs [265\u2013267], ERAs [266, 268\u2013270], and PDE5 inhibitors [268, 271, 272] in the management of patients with PoPH.

            "text": "Left ventricular failure is among the most common causes of RVF [9]. The backflow caused by left heart disease increases LV end-diastolic pressure and RV afterload. Therefore, the treatment of patients with biventricular failure should focus on optimizing LV function through improvement in preload, contractility, and afterload. However, even after optimization of the left heart function, the transpulmonary gradient (mPAP\u2013PCWP) may remain elevated, a phenomena known as \u201cout of proportion\u201d PH that is thought to be caused by an intrinsic abnormality in the pulmonary vasculature [273, 274]. The persistent elevation in PVR is especially important in patients being considered for cardiac transplant or LVAD placement because of an increased perioperative risk and decreased long-term survival after transplantation and the potential need for additional mechanical RV support [238, 275]. Sildenafil has been linked to improved exercise capacity and pulmonary hemodynamics in secondary PH patients with systolic heart failure, but not in patients with diastolic heart failure [276\u2013278]. Prostacyclin analogs have also been used with positive hemodynamic changes [279, 280]. ERAs have not been associated with improved clinical outcomes and may increase the risk of decompensation [281\u2013284]. Nevertheless, more evidence is needed before general recommendations can be made regarding the use of pulmonary vasodilators in this setting.",

Low SVR leads to decreased RV coronary perfusion, myocardial ischemia, and failure. In addition, there is often an increase in PVR causing decreased RV output. An increase in RV afterload or intrinsic myocardial depression may be the dominant cause of RV dysfunction in sepsis [4\u20136, 10]. Given the increased PVR, increasing cardiac output may prove very difficult in patients with PH and sepsis can trigger acute RVF. The management of the septic patient with PH must include early administration of antibiotics and hemodynamic optimization that should encompass the optimization of preload, enhancement of SVR, improvement of CO, and prevention of increase in PVR (as discussed above) [285]. Fluid resuscitation should not be liberal in this population and ideally must be guided by invasive hemodynamic monitoring devices. The use of pulmonary vasodilators in sepsis should be reserved to cases where further decrease in PVR is needed to improve cardiac output and systemic perfusion, keeping in mind that these agents produce systemic effects that could worsen the hemodynamic status.",

Despite the recent advancements in therapy that have improved the quality of life and survival in PH, it still remains a progressive disease that will ultimately have fatal outcomes. Therefore, it is important that the patient\u2019s wishes pertaining to end-of-life care be discussed in a serene environment during the course of the disease. Grinnan et al. reported that the majority of patients with PAH died in the hospital and most of those deaths happened in the ICU [287]. Unfortunately, the ICU may not be the best setting to have this conversation for the first time when decompensation typically occurs rapidly and decisions may need to be made very quickly. Cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) is attempted in 25 % of patients that ultimately die of progression of the disease. The survival of PH patients who arrested and had CPR is quite low (0\u20136 %) compared to the survival from other causes of cardiac arrest, a fact that is not surprising given that chronic disease is associated with poor outcomes after CPR [288, 289]. Moreover, almost every patient that survived had a correctable cause [290]. Recent evidence shows that palliative care services were infrequently utilized in the care of patients with PH [287, 291, 292].",

Careful manipulation of RV preload is required as under- or overfilling of the RV will worsen its contractility. Pulmonary vasodilators have a profound effect on PVR and can be used to increase CO but co-administration of systemic vasopressors and restoration of cardiac output with the use of inotropes are usually required. Mechanical circulatory support is predominately being utilized as a bridge to transplant. Despite the advances in therapy that have improved the survival in patients with PH, realistic expectations should be discussed in the outpatient setting as patients who suffer cardiac arrest have very poor outcomes.
