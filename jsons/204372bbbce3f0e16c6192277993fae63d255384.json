The mucin MUC5B is an important component of the innate immune response and expression levels are associated with the MUC5B promoter polymorphism, rs35705950.

Carriers of the MUC5B T-allele demonstrated upregulated RNA expression of MUC5B in lung tissue 89 20 . The increased MUC5B production in T-allele carriers may therefore protect carriers from adverse events related to airway defense. This may be of particular importance in aging subjects, because mucus production and mucociliary clearance have been described to decrease with natural aging 6, 21 . Decreased mucociliary clearance may underlie the observed age-related increase in the incidence of severe community-acquired pneumonia in the elderly 22 . Similar to previous reports on COVID-19 1 we also observed that severe COVID-19 and death from COVID-19 is predominantly found in the elderly.",

Subsequent research showed that the MUC5B T-allele not only predisposes to IPF but to a variety of chronic progressive forms of pulmonary fibrosis [24] [25] [26] [27] . The key cell in the pathogenesis of pulmonary fibrosis is the alveolar type II (AT2) cell. Recent research showed that ectopic overproduction of Muc5b in AT2 cells in mice cause mucociliary dysfunction and bleomycin-induced pulmonary fibrosis 19 . Interestingly, overproduction in AT2 cells caused worse mucociliary dysfunction than overproduction in club cells in airways 19 .",
