This method is economically viable only for single proteins or pathogens that consist of several proteins. Therefore, researchers have developed alternative computational approaches for predicting T cell epitopes that have significantly decreased the experimental burden previously associated with epitope identification. In practice, using only one computational algorithm to predict CTL epitopes may lead to large numbers of false positives and false negatives. More recently, comprehensive validation using data from several different types of prediction software has proved accurate and has considerably reduced the cost of epitope discovery. However, because the different prediction tools are based on different computational algorithms, their predictions can be different. If we do not choose with care, we can miss the immunodominant epitopes. Therefore, in this study we chose three prediction tools based on different computational algorithms to achieve results that are more accurate.",

            "text": "One of the approaches to finding a new generation of effective and safe vaccines is epitope\u2010based DNA vaccination, which enables focusing of the immune response on important and highly conserved epitopes (27). This approach provides the opportunity to use specific epitopes to shift the immune system toward a Th1\u2010 or Th2\u2010mediated immune response and eliminate unwanted responses. In addition, CTL epitope\u2010based immunization has the advantage of eliciting an immune response only against the protective epitope and avoidance of epitope drift in M. tuberculosis infections (28). Studies of M. tuberculosis in humans have shown that induction of broad T\u2010cell mediated immunity to M. tuberculosis and type 1 cytokines, including IL\u20102, IFN\u2010\u03b3 and TNF\u2010\u03b1, could be essential to TB vaccine design (29). Vaccines based on CTL epitopes represent a logical approach to generating effective cellular immunity in both the prophylactic and therapeutic settings because multiple epitopes can be incorporated into the vaccine design with the goal of inducing broadly reactive responses by multiple CTL clones directed against different epitopes. Multi\u2010CTL epitope DNA vaccines have been reported to induce broad CTL responses against HIV, HBV, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus and others (30, 31, 32). Whereas epitope\u2010based vaccines are limited with respect to HLA polymorphism and population coverage, the use of supertype\u2010restricted epitopes provides a means to address this problem (33).",
