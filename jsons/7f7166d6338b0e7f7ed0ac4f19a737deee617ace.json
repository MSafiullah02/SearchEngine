Since then, the 2019 coronavirus disease (COVID-19) has spread worldwide becoming a pandemic. Beyond the risks strictly related to the infection, concerns have been expressed for the psychological impact that COVID-19 may have, especially on vulnerable individuals with pre-existing mental health conditions. Somatic symptom disorder (SSD) is characterized by a dysfunctional preoccupation with physical symptoms leading to excessive and unnecessary healthcare utilization. Despite being quite common, such condition remains underrecognized. We report a detailed clinical case of a 16 years old adolescent, who presented with a history suggestive of COVID-19 infection and associated psychological distress. Despite testing negative for the presence of SARS-CoV-2, his extreme and persisting health preoccupations required an inpatient admission to the Child and Adolescent Neuropsychiatric Unit. He responded rapidly to a low dose of antipsychotic and an antidepressant. Based on his medical history and current presentation, he received a diagnosis of SSD. When COVID-19-like symptoms occur, we highlight the importance of differentially diagnosing a possible exacerbation of a pre-existing SSD, triggered by fear of being infected.",

Cases were traced back to the Huanan Seafood Wholesale Market with the hypothesis that patients had been infected by a pathogen transmitted by live animals. In early January 2020, a novel coronavirus, the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), was identified as the cause from the analysis of the bronchoalveolar washing fluid of a Wuhan patient (Lu et al., 2020) . On 11 February 2020, the World Health Organization named the SARS-CoV-2-induced illness as the 2019 coronavirus disease . Due to its person-to-person transmission, COVID-19 has rapidly spread worldwide (Rothe et al., 2020) , becoming a public health emergency of international concern requiring an urgent, high-level and coordinated effort to control the outbreak (Cucinotta and Vanelli, 2020) . As of 9 April 2020, over 1.5 million COVID-19 cases have been reported across all continents, resulting in a pandemic, with northern Italy becoming Europe's epicenter, with over 140,000 reported cases (Gagliano et al., 2020) .",

As evidence suggests a particularly unfavorable mental health outcome in COVID-19 frontline responders (Lai et al., 2020) , we register the second case of suicide among female nurses leading the fight against COVID-19 in Northern Italy. Further, due to the emotional impact of COVID-19 pandemic, we may reasonably speculate a higher risk or relapse among people suffering from a pre-existing mental health condition . Patients with a psychiatric disorder are also vulnerable for a number of other reasons. First, having a psychiatric disorder has been associated with a higher likelihood of getting an infection (Seminog and Goldacre, 2013) , possibly due to being cognitively impaired, underestimating the health risk, adopting less stringent self-protection, and having prolonged hospital admissions . Testing positive for COVID-19 would definitely amplify the fears associated with the infection. Second, access to medical care, which may per se be delayed because of the pandemic overloading the health care system, could be particularly difficult for people with mental health problems as a further consequence of discrimination (Li et al., 2018) or challenging clinical presentation (Sartorious, 2013) . Third, the nationwide adoption of regulations progressively restricting people movement and introducing quarantine may result in psychiatric appointments being more difficult to attend, deemed unurgent, or rescheduled following a risk-benefit-based decision.",

He was not taking any medication and there were no known allergies of any type. The first basic assessment in A&E found body temperature of 38 \u00b0C, borderline pulse oxygen unsaturation (SpO2: 97%) in patient with normal haemoglobin (AA), blood pressure of 135/70 mmHg, and heart rate of 100 bpm.

Blood and urine tests were performed, especially to investigate inflammatory markers. No specific alterations were observed, with C-reactive Protein and White Blood Count within normal range. Only an increase in total and direct bilirubin was noted, potentially suggesting the presence of Gilbert's syndrome (Supplementary Table 1 ). Through the day, a peripheral intravenous catheter (PIVC) was used to administer 0.9% saline (sodium chloride (NaCl)) solution for a total of 2000 ml as well as paracetamol for a total of 2000 mg (10mg/ml, 100 ml bis in die (bid)). Brain Computed Tomography (CT) scan, chest X-ray, and urinalysis were unremarkable. At some point, due to increasing preoccupation for his health status, the patient was so agitated that ran outside of the A&E. With support from healthcare staff, he came back to the COVID-19 Triage Unit and was relocated to a single-bed patient room. Despite reassurances, the patient appeared only slightly more relaxed and covered his face with bed sheets. He was observed lying in bed in fetal position.",

His mood was slightly depressed. His affect tended to be dysphoric but remained congruous with the thought content. Severe anxiety evolving in mental confusion and loss of control was also observed, with the patient expressing an unmodulated and misdirected discharge of tension and emotions without concern about consequences. The patient showed a mildly disorganized process of thinking and the thought content revealed worries about his health status tending to a delusional intensity, in the absence of suicide ideas. No hallucinatory behavior was observed. He did not appear grossly impaired on a cognitive basis, with both recent and remote memory preserved. While orientation in space and person was intact, orientation in time was partially compromised, especially with reference to the last few days. The patient showed poor insight and judgment regarding his condition and need for help. The patient's clinical status was reported to have worsened in the few days before the A&E admission also in relation to the need to rearrange his psychology appointments for eating disorder as telephone/video-conference sessions in order not to expose him to unnecessary risk of SARS-CoV-2 contagion. The neuropsychiatrist advised for admission to the inpatient Child and Adolescent Neuropsychiatry Unit for further evaluation, after medical clearance. The antipsychotic Olanzapine was prescribed at the dosage of 2.5 mg bid as provisional treatment plan. On the evening of the same day, the patient was transferred.

Increased healthcare utilization is a significant concern in SSD ( Barsky et al., 2005) , also in light of evidence of limited response to psychopharmacological treatment and use of psychological interventions (Rosic et al., 2016) . Nowadays, this is particularly relevant as such conditions can overload the already affected health care systems. Due to an unexpected relevant world life event and depending on perception of its impact (Bedard-Thomas et al., 2018) , even people not getting the COVID-19 infection, though not life-threatened, may be severely affected by it. When COVID-19-like symptoms occur, clinicians may have to differentially diagnose a possible exacerbation of a pre-existing SSD, triggered by fear of being infected. This is of particular importance as it may help preventing further burden to the healthcare system.",
