The literature on the subject has become much more confused by the variety of names and inadequate descriptions of the species. This fact alone has led to the erection of many uncalled-for new species even by careful workers.",

He has also extended the scope of the Phytopath.?.., Bd. 53, Heft 2 g genus Lachnellula to include some of the species growing on non-coniferous hosts and with septate ascospores.

A more recent attempt is that of NANNFELDT (1932) who based his system of classification on a similar hne. NANNEELDT'S system provides a more compact and convenient ordering of these fungi. NANNFELDT (1932) proposed six families of Helotiales namely Dermateaceae, Phacidiaceae, Orbiliaceae, Hyaloscyphaceae, Helotiaceae and Geoglossaceae. NANNFELDT (1932) accepts the heterogenous nature of the various families of the Helotiales and mentions in his work that some of the families deserve more than family rank. Later workers (TERRIER 1942, VON ARX and MiJLLER 1954) removed the Phacidiaceae and raised it to the rank of a separate order. Similarly, WHETZEL (1945) recognized the importance of stromatic structure and other characters and he formed the new family Sclerotiniaceae which corresponds to NANNFELDT'S Ciborioideae.",

In the case of the apothecial structure of the Scleroderrioideae the inner layers of the excipulum are made up of dark brown plectenchymatous tissue. The outer cells of the ectal excipulum are isodiametric in nature with rather thick cartilagineous walls. The apothecia of Durelloideae are characteristically formed by thick brown walled cartilagineous cells which show definite arrangement in surface view. The inner layers of the apothecia of the Heterosphaerioideae are composed of thin walled hyphae which are gelatinous in nature. The outer cells of the ectal excipulum are short isodiametric with thick cartilagineous walls. The medullary excipulum of the Helotioideae is formed by loosely interwoven thin walled hyphae and the outermost cells of the excipulum are broad with somewhat thickened walls. Perennial fruiting body and the \"textura globulosa\" of the ectal excipulum are the distinguishing characteristics of Encoelioideae. Tribes as Phialeoideae and Ombrophiloideae, whose systematic position is uncertain, are omitted from this discussion.

DENNIS (1962) placed the genus Perrotia Boud. besides Lachnellula Karst. and transferred the entire Trichoscyphelloideae from Helotiaceae to Hyaloscyphaceae on the basis of the presence of excipular hairs. If one gives more importance only to the presence of excipular hairs then Trichoscyphelloideae should be considered as a tribe of Hyaloscyphaceae. But if one gives due consideration to the other characters such as saprophytic or parasitic nature, structure of the sterile layers of the apothecium and especially cina sensu Fuckel as lectotype for the Dasyscypha. SEAVER (1951) following PHILLIPS (1887) placed these hairy inoperculate discomycetes occurring on coniferous hosts in the genus Lachnella Fr. Lachnella Fries cannot be used as a generic name for the Discomycetes, since as pointed out by NANNFELDT (1932) , the type species of Lachnella Fr., Peziza alboviolascens Alb. and Schw., is a Cyphella Fr. and hence Lachnella Fr. must be regarded as a Basidiomycete genus. DENNIS (1949) , however, followed NANNFELDT (1932) in accepting Trichoscyphella Nannf. but used Dasyscypha Fuckel in place of NANNFELDT'S Lachnum Karst., since Dasyscypha antedates Lachnum Karst. and lanceolate paraphyses are not strictly a diagnostic character of Lachnum Karst. as employed by NANNFELDT (1932) . MULLER and AHMAD (1962) convinced by the relationship of brown excipled hairy inoperculate discomycetes e. g. Dasyscypha arida (Phill.) Sacc. with Trichoscyphella Nannf., placed it under this genus. In so doing they enlarged the scope of the genus. DENNIS till 1961 maintained the traditional divisions of these hairy, corticolous, subsessile Helotiales (with obtusely rounded paraphyses, asci with negative iodine reaction and sphaeroidal ascospores in the genus Lachnellula Karst.; with ascospores of any other shape if growing on coniferous hosts in Trichoscyphella Nannf. and if growing on other woody plants \\n Perrotia Boud. But DENNIS (1961) was in error in mentioning the iodine reaction of Lachnellula suecica as negative, because in this species too the pore of the ascus turns blue after iodine treatment. Later, DENNIS (1962) followed BOUDIER (1907) and reunited these genera into one and accepted the generic name Lachnellula Karst. as it antedates every other generic name given to these fungi. So it was possible to eliminate the epithet \"calycina\" Schum. ex Fr., the correct application of which has always been doubtful. DENNIS in his new approach to the genus Lachnellula Karst. includes species with septate ascospores and also species occurring on woody plants other Magnification 50X than the conifers. To avoid confusion we should at first reserve the name Lachnellula Karst. for those species inhabiting coniferous hosts, which more or less exhibit many common features, and unless and until the affinities of the species growing on non coniferous hosts are clearly established, these species should not be included. It is always preferable at this stage to stick to the narrower concept of the genus as referred to by earlier workers. So in the genus Lachnellula Karst. I include those hairy, corticolous, moperculate Discomycetes occurring on coniferous hosts which form a natural group.",

The medullary excipulum is of \"textura intricata\" and it is composed of loosely interwoven, thin walled hyphae. The asci are cylindrical to cylindrically clavate, short stalked and contain eight ascospores. The pore of the ascus shows positive iodine reaction except in a few species. The ascospores are hyaline, continuous, one celled and of various forms, either guttulate or non guttulate. The paraphyses are distinctly cylindrical or filiform with obtuse ends except in a few species, where they are either sublanceolate or spathulate in nature. In some of the species the moniliform filaments are present which are interspersed with the paraphyses. Paraphyses are either empty or with yellow oil globules. The fungus produces cotton-like white or With slightly buff to orange tinged mycelium. The imperfect stage generally develops in a culture in light brown to orange yellow coloured labyrinthiform cavities.

            "text": "Associated with the collection of Lachnellula subtilissima (Cooke) Dennis on Pinus silvestris L., the imperfect form was encountered. It was thought that it might be the imperfect stage of Lachnellula subtilissima (Cooke) Dennis. Cultures from the ascospores and also from the conidial stage were obtained. Both the cultures showed resemblance to each other and produced the same type of imperfect stages on 2 % Malt extract agar. Cultures of other species of Lachnellula Karst. obtained from ascospores produced a uniform type of imperfect stage. They differed from each other only in size and form of the conidia. The details of the imperfect stages are described in the morphological descriptions of the respective species. To assign the form genus for imperfect stages of the species of genus Lachnellula Karst. it was noted from the literature that they closely compare with the following few genera: Cytospora Ehrenb., Cytosporella Sacc, Zythia Fr. and Naemospora Pers. The conidial stages of the genus Lachnellula Karst. differ from Cytospora Ehrenb. and Cytosporella in having light to flesh coloured stromata and in exuding the conidia in masses. They differ from Zythia Fr. in the stromata not being superficial and in the sporophores being verticillately branched. The diagnosis given for the genus Naemospora Pers. fits well and reads: flesh or light coloured stromata, conidia being small, hyaline, continuous, oozing out into bright coloured masses, sausage shaped or ellipsoidal-oblong, borne on simple or verticillately branched sporophores. ALLESCHER (1895) has recorded an imperfect stage on Pinus silvestris L. and has allotted it to the form genus Naemospora and species strobii. For comparison the herbarium material labelled Naemospora strobii All. was examined and it supported the above conclusion. So it was thought desirable to provisionally assign the imperfect stages of Lachnellula species to the existing genus Naemospora Pers. instead of erecting a new form genus to include its imperfect stages whose perfect stages were already known. Authentic herbarium materials of numerous specimens have constituted the basis of this study. The materials collected including type specimens of the species described in this paper are deposited in ETH Herbarium, Zurich. In addition to the above specimens, type specimens from the Botanical Museum Helsinki (Herbarium P. A. KARSTEN) and the National Fungus Collection, Beltsville, U.S.A. (Herbarium G. G.

Characters such as spathulate paraphyses, obtusely rounded apices of the asci and iodine reaction of the ascus apex are useful in differentiating Lachnellula agassizii from Lachnellula calyciformis. Lachnellula calyciformis differs from other related species in the wall structure and negative iodine reaction of the ascus apex. Fusoid ascospores and ascus apex turning blue with iodine are characteristics of Lachnellula subtilissima. Characters such as small size of the ascospores, sublanceolate paraphyses and its habit on the resinous exudation are of use in distinguishing Lachnellula resinaria from the rest of the species.

BOUDIER (1907) and NANNEELDT (1932) treated this small spored form as the type species for their new genera namely Trichoscypha Boud. and Trichoscyphella Nannf. respectively. At that time they considered Cooke's specific epithet \"subtilissima\" as synonym of \"calycina\". So as pointed out by DENNIS the specific epithet \"calycina\" cannot be used on nomenclatorial grounds. Next in turn comes COOKE'S specific epithet \"subtilissima\". 6. Lachnellula minuta sp. nov.",

COOKE (1876) disagreed with REHM'S (1876) decision because he considered blueing of the ascus pore an unreliable characteristic. Later, J. C.

Following four species have been included in this group. Lachnellula arida (Phill.) Dennis, Lachyiellula flavovirens (Bres.) Dennis, Lachnellula fuscosanguinea (Rehm) Dennis, and Lachnellula pini (Brunch.) Dennis. Though the number of the reported species is rather small, there exists considerable confusion and disagreement in naming the species. Many fresh collections and the herbarium specimens were examined except for Lachnellula pini (Brunch.) Dennis. Lachnellula pini is considered to be a parasitic form and it differs from Lachnellula fuscosanguinea in having larger ascospores (after HAHN and AYERS 1934) . The other three species can be differentiated from one another on the basis of wall structure, size of the asci, form and size of the ascospores and cultural characters. One of the strains of Lachnellula arida (Phill.) Dennis (Culture number 4683), isolated from ascospores developed the perfect stage on 2 % Malt extract agar (kept at 4\u00b0C and in the absence of natural light). When the apothecium developed in pure culture was examined for its wall structure and form and size of the asci, it was noticed that the substrate had no effect on the wall structure and so also the size of the asci, form and size of the ascospores and the thickness of the hairs. The measurements of the asci, ascospores and hairs tallied with the other herbarium specimens.",

Dennis and the American material as Lachnellula arida (Phill.) Dennis. SYDOW and PETRAK (1922) and PETRAK (1931) were of the opinion that above mentioned three forms are one and the same and these differences are due to differences in ecological conditions and host relations. PETRAK (1955) after comparing the American specimens with representative European material was convinced of the differences amongst the species and so he reseparated the species. He has given more importance to size and form of the ascospores and number and thickness of the paraphyses. Geographical distribution; Presence of Lachnellula arida (Phill.) Dennis is conclusively proved by the author in Switzerland, Erance, North America and Pakistan. Lachnellula fuscosanguinea is associated with weakened brandies of Pinus montana Mill, at the higher elevation and is considered as weak parasite. It is rather common in Alps. Lachnellula flavovirens also seems to be present only in Europe. Apothecia are olive green coloured, short but distinctly stipitate, scattered or in small groups. Apothecia when dry are closed, with enrolled margins, expanding under the moist, conditions and forming flat saucer like structure. Disc is yellow to orange yellow in colour reaching up to 4-8 mm in diameter. Anatomy of the apothecium: The ectal excipulum is formed of \"textura globulosa\".

Sacc. to Lachnellula Karst. are rather disputable. NANNFELDT (1953) placed the above species in Trichoscyphella Nannf. Later DENNIS (1962) treated it as a species of Lachnellula Karst. Dasyscypha abietis (Karst.) Sacc. differs from the other species of Lachnellula Karst. in the spore form, shape of the asci, and smooth walled hairs. This is the only species with smooth hairs and if included in the genus Lachnellula Karst. will unnecessary extend the scope of the genus. Secondly its cultural characters have not yet been studied. So I prefer at present this species to remain in the genus Dasyscyphus S. F. Gray, from which it differs in not having distinct lanceolate paraphyses and the negative iodine reaction. D. DISCUSSION T he discomycete group named Trichoscyphelloideae (after NANNFELDT 1932) shows more affinities to Helotiaceae in general habit, apothecial anatomy and nature of paraphyses and so its inclusion in Helotiaceae is more justified. DENNIS (1962) on the other hand places Trichoscyphelloideae into Hyaloscyphaceae only because of presence of excipular hairs. This view of DENNIS cannot be accepted. The scope of the genus Lachnellula Karst. should at first be restricted to include this natural group of species occurring on coniferous hosts. If the genus Lachnellula Karst. sensu Dennis is accepted, it might lead to the grouping of unrelated species under the common generic name. So it is preferable to use the above generic name for the species having white, brown or olive green coloured apothecia, hyaline one celled ascospores, filamentous paraphyses, and tuberculated or finely granulated hairs. In this paper the species with smooth hyaline hairs namely Lachnellula abietis (Karst.) Dennis is excluded from the genus Lachnellula Karst. and is redescribed under the former generic name Dasyscypha abietis (Karst.) Sacc. nient and advice. I am deeply indebted to Dr. E. MULLER for his unfailing help, numerous suggestions, careful study of the manuscript and criticism. I owe him my deepest personal gratitude. 1 am grateful to the authorities of the Volkart Foundation, Winterthur, Switzerland, for the award of fellowship and the interest they have shown in my work. I am also indebted to the Trustees of Hindu Education Fund, Bombay, India, and my Indian friends for their financial assistance.",

Seventeen species are described and their important morphological characters figured. These species are arranged in three major groups based on their morphological characters. Lachnellula hyalina Dharne, Lachnellula minuta Dharne, and Lachnellula tuherculata Dharne are new species. Following four new combinations are proposed -Lachnellula calyciformis (Willd. ex Fr.)

(The host Phyllocladus alpinus is not represented in Europe.) Lachnellula gallica (Karst. and Har.) Dennis is only recorded in France and it seems to be rather rare. Lachnellula suecica (de By. ex Fuckel) Nannf. is the most common species found in the Alps and Scandinavian countries and in North America. It has been recorded on a number of coniferous hosts. According toDENNIS (1949) it is uncommon in England. Lachnellula subtilissima (Cooke) Dennis and Lachnellula calyciformis (Willd. ex Fr.)
