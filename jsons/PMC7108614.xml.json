In most instances, an alteration of the cytokine and chemokine network is observed. However, potential effects of viremia on these inflammatory mediators are not fully elucidated. Monocytes and macrophages are not only the prime targets for HIV-1 infection but also a source of inflammatory cytokines and chemokines (3). These key modulators of the immune system play a critical role in recruiting new target cells including CD4+ T cells to the site of infection (4). In the past few years, significant progress has been made to understand the molecular mechanisms underlying the host\u2013pathogen interaction with the advent of microarray technology (5, 6). However, until now we do not know the crucial host factors influencing this host\u2013virus relationship. There are reports about general impact of HIV-1 on host cell gene expression both in patient-derived B and CD4+ T cells as well as in in vitro infected cells (7\u201310). However, the role of HIV-1 viremia on host cell cytokine/chemokine expression has not been studied in detail.",

Two-color flow cytometry was performed on previously frozen PBMC samples. In order to obtain uniform conditions, cells were stimulated with PMA for 24 h prior to staining. As expected, monocytes were primary producers of CCL2. The dot plot analysis clearly indicated a higher production of CCL2 by CD14+ monocytes derived from viremic patients (Fig. 4A). There was a highly significant increase in the percentage of CCL2-producing monocytes in viremic (P < 0.005) as compared with aviremic patients (Fig. 4B). This was also true when flow cytometry was performed using freshly isolated PMBC of HIV-1 patients (Supplementary Figure 2, available at International Immunology Online). Furthermore, we could demonstrate a strong inverse correlation (P = 0.019 and r2 = 0.515) between CD4+ T cells and percentage of CCL2+ CD14+ monocytes (Fig. 4C). These findings suggest that viremic patients with low CD4 T cell counts have a high CCL2 expression which could be a potential marker of disease progression. However, we could not observe a significant statistical correlation with viral load (data not shown) except a tendency toward a positive correlation. The data presented here are based on a small cohort of patients (n = 10, including six aviremic and four viremic). A possible explanation could be that monocytes are not the sole contributors of CCL2 found in serum, and other cells secrete CCL2 that finally comes into circulation. In contrast to CCL2, we could not detect any significant change (P = 0.211) in the expression of the CCR2, the receptor for CCL2, on patient monocytes (Fig. 4D), indicating that viremia had no significant effect on receptor expression.",

This analysis revealed a significant effect of viremia on the mRNA level of CCL2, CXCL10, IFN-\u03b3, GCH1 and CCR1.

Only when viral replication is detected, as found in viremic patients, the host inflammatory response leads to an increase in mRNA expression of specific inflammatory genes. Monocytes from HIV-1 patients have been shown to express more CCL2 when compared with healthy controls (29). In this regard, our flow cytometric analysis of patient-derived PBMC showed a clear increase in the CCL2-expressing CD14+ monocytes in viremic patients. This increase in the percentage of CD14+CCL2+ monocytes inversely correlates with the CD4+ T cell count. Since low CD4+ T cell count is associated with viremia and disease progression, an increased expression of CCL2 in these patients could potentially reflect an additional marker of disease progression. CCL2 is induced in many inflammatory diseases including infection with various bacterial and viral pathogens. Production of CCL2 is not specific to HIV-1. Several other viruses have been shown to induce CCL2 expression. For example, viruses such as human rhinovirus (30), respiratory syncytial virus (31), severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (32) and SHIV (33), the best available primate model of HIV-1 infection, have been reported to induce CCL2 expression. Recently, it has been shown that the recruitment of CD4+ T cells by CXCL10 and 11 produced by HIV-1-infected monocyte-derived macrophages and dendritic cells in lymphoid organs contributes to HIV-1 disease (34). In this regard, in vitro HIV-1 infection of macrophages is already known to activate CCL2 expression and CCL2 may potentially influence HIV-1 pathogenesis (22). We also observed a similar transcriptional regulation in the CCL2 gene in in vitro HIV-1 infection of PBMC obtained from four healthy volunteers. A very recent study using a mouse model of HIV-1 infection demonstrated CCL2 gene induction in brain tissues of infected animals (35). These data suggest that HIV-1 viremia alters the transcriptional program of the host cytokine/chemokine network, and this effect is most prominent with respect to CCL2 expression.",

            "text": "Transcriptional regulation could be translated into production of CCL2 because significantly elevated serum CCL2 concentrations were observed in HIV-1 viremic as compared with aviremic or healthy individuals. Furthermore, we could demonstrate a positive correlation between viremia and serum CCL2. Interestingly, an inverse correlation of CD4+ T cells was associated with more CCL2-expressing CD14+ monocytes. Since CCL2 is a strong lymphocyte chemoattractant, its higher production by host cells upon HIV-1 infection may result in recruitment of more target cells to the site of infection, resulting in higher HIV-1 replication and rapid spreading of the virus (Fig. 5). We can assume that the concentration of CCL2 at the site of infection is much higher than in the periphery; hence, a strong recruitment of CCR2-expressing target cells can be expected. CCR2, the receptor for CCL2, is expressed on the majority of monocytes and to a lesser extent on CD4+ T cells. However, we could not observe any significant effect of viremia on CCR2 expression on these cells, suggesting CCL2 concentration-dependent but surface CCR2-independent recruitment of target cells to the site of infection. Higher CCL2 expression might be at least in part mediated by TNF-\u03b1 since it is a well-known inducer of CCL2, and higher TNF-\u03b1 levels are associated with viremia as reported in many studies. Moreover, prior exposure of monocytes or monocyte-derived macrophages to \u03b2-chemokines has already been shown to enhance viral replication (36). Treatment with the HIV-1 protease inhibitor indinavir reduces the plasma CCL2 level in severely immunodeficient HIV-infected individuals (37). This effect is most likely explained by reduced viral replication due to effective treatment with indinavir. A higher level of CCL2 has been previously reported in HIV-1 patients plasma (38); however, there was no discrimination between viremic and aviremic patients. Here, we report that CCL2 is regulated not only at the protein but also at the mRNA level in HIV-1-infected viremic individuals. The potential role of CCL2 in HIV-1 replication in vitro can be explained in PHA blast model of HIV-1IIIB infection. We observed >2-fold increase in the viral titer after 5 days of post-infection (data not shown), which is in line with previous reports (23, 39). Although we are not providing direct evidence for CCL2 in virus replication, the studies presented here strongly suggest that CCL2 is an integral host factor in HIV-1 pathogenesis, supporting the hypothesis that CCL2 presumably could act as a potential enhancer of HIV-1 replication.",

Our data show a clear correlation between the viremia and host CCL2 gene response. Unraveling the mechanism of increased HIV-1 replication and potential involvement of CCL2 could provide more insight to understand the virus\u2013host relationship, and inhibition of increased CCL2 production may lead to new therapeutic interventions in HIV-1 infection.",
