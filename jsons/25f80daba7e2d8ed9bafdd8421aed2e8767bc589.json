            "text": "of COVIDovid-19 include diarrhea, pneumonia, lymphopenia, exhausted 43 lymphocytes, and pro-inflammatory cytokine production. Immunology is part of the 44 process of clinical evolution, but there are some questions around immunity-basedity 45 protection: (1) why How some infected people have only mild symptoms of the disease or 46 are asymptomatic;? (2) wWhy delayed and weak antibody responses are associated with 47 severe outcomes;? and (3) wWhy the positivity ion molecular tests does not represent 48 protective antibodyies IgG.? Perhaps T cell responses may be thea key to solvinge those 49 questions. The SARS-CoV-2-specific memory T cells persist emerging in peripheral 50 blood and may be capable ofit is able to providinge effective information about protective 51 immunity. The T cells studies can be helpful into elucidatinge the pathways for 52 development of vaccines, therapies, and diagnostics for COVIDovid-19 and for filling 53 these immunology knowledge gaps. , the world is experiencing experiencing athe novel and highly 78 transmissible coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) outbreak, which also with high transmissibility 79 and causes high mortality [1,2]. The SARS-CoV-2 induces a severe acute respiratory 80 syndrome, termed named as COVIDovid-19, in which immunology is part of the process of 81 clinical evolution consisting of with lung tissue damage induced by an inflammatory 82 response, such as a cytokine storm and, macrophages and neutrophils activation [1,2].83 During infection, A few studies have presentedshowed some information about the immune 84 response during this infection attempting to control the infection, which involves is driven 85 to the antibodyies production and lymphocytes T cell activation, but the information is 86 restricted to those hospitalized patients who were hospitalized because they had the virus 87 and were symptomatic. . OverIn the natural course of the disease in history with thosthee 88 hospitalized patients who recovered, s, antibodyies production was shown to increase is 89 increasing after the first weeks of symptoms onset, which is in recovery patients with 90 hospitalization history, with a suggestive positive correlation with disease severity [3,4], 91 while T cells were also are activated; it and seems that memory phenotype also showed an 92 increase has also risen after 14 days of hospitalization[5,6]. However, there are some 93 questions around immunity-basedity protection with respect to who does and does not need 94 hospitalization., and Tthe non-hospitalizedis population is considered as viral host by, 95 carrying the virus around, and contributing collaborating to the spread of the virus virus 96 spread. Also, the other barrier in this outbreak is related to asymptomatic cases, mainly ion 97 health care professionals in the hospital, which could contribute to increase the increase in 98 the number of the cases. The solution to stopping the viral spread appears to has been be 99 direct to social distancing and massive testing, mainly for antibodyies detection.",
