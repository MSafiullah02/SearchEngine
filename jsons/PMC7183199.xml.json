The benefits of self-isolation are substantially increased when initiated earlier in the disease course. For example, when 20% of mildly symptomatic individuals practice self-isolation at 24 h, the peak weekly requirement for ICU beds would be reduced by 48.4% (IQR 46.4 to 50.3%) and delayed by 12 wk (Fig. 1 C and F), relative to no self-isolation.

With an R0 of 2.5, we estimated that about 85% of mildly symptomatic individuals would need to self-isolate within 24 h to avoid exceeding typically available critical care capacity.

Given that 80% of all COVID-19 cases have been classified as mild (11, 12), yet likely spreading the disease, timely self-isolation as well as behavioral avoidance should be considered a key public health consideration (13). This is particularly important, since individuals with mild illness taking symptom-suppressing drugs may reduce their rates of self-isolation, thereby contributing to the spread of disease further. Moreover, timely diagnosis and self-isolation can delay the peak-time of outbreak and hospitalization between 5 and 30 wk, providing the time for additional resources to be rolled out.",

We have focused on the role of self-isolation to slow the epidemic and enable the healthcare system to manage critical care of symptomatic patients and continue non\u2013COVID-19 healthcare activities. Yet self-isolation should be seen within the broader framework of nonpharmaceutical interventions to reduce infectious contacts, including a range of social-distancing policies. Our model does not incorporate social-distancing policies other than self-isolation for lack of adequate parametrization of their effects, yet there could well be important synergies between self-isolation and other social-distancing policies. In the current crisis, China has deployed a range of social-distancing policies (14), and globally, school closures have been widely adopted [in 13 countries affecting 292 million school children as of March 4, 2020 (15)]. In the context of respiratory infections (e.g., influenza), school closure has been shown to reduce visits to the emergency department at the hospitals and slow the progression of the outbreak (16, 17). However, assessing the effectiveness of school closures is challenging, as it may depend on the population setting and the time of implementation (16). Limiting public transportation would also reduce the number of contacts with infectious cases, particularly those with mild symptoms, and therefore impede the spatial spread of the disease. However, this approach requires careful evaluation before implementation as it may indirectly affect access to healthcare and other essential services (18, 19).",

We also assumed that hospitalized patients are effectively isolated and do not transmit the disease to others (e.g., healthcare workers), thereby making hospitalization a perfect isolation setting. Our projections for critical care needs are conservative in two regards. First, we only considered symptomatic transmission in our model. Under the possibility of asymptomatic and presymptomatic transmission (23), self-isolation of only symptomatic cases would be much less effective in mitigating the need for hospitalization and ICU beds. Second, our results correspond to the overall projections at a national level. Geographic disparities and other spatially heterogeneous factors among the US states and counties, combined with stochasticity, would likely exacerbate the imbalance between supply and demand more than we project here. ICU beds may go unused in locations with no or mild outbreak while hotspots are overwhelmed.",

These age groups were chosen based on availability of disease-specific parameters, and also to provide results that are aligned with the age stratification often used for other respiratory infections like influenza (25). Transmission of SARS\u2013CoV-2 depended on an empirically determined age-specific contact matrix for communities and households (26). Newly infected individuals entered an incubation period for an average of 5.2 d before becoming symptomatic (SI Appendix, Table A5). Combining with the estimated average of 7.5 d for the serial interval (27), we calculated an average infectious period of 4.6 d, during which individuals were concurrently symptomatic. Symptomatic cases had an age-dependent probability of developing mild, severe, or critical illness. We assumed that patients exhibiting mild symptoms recover without hospitalization, while severe and critical cases had an age-dependent probability of non-ICU and ICU hospital admissions, respectively. We also assumed that the relative infectivity of mild illness compared to severe and critical illness is reduced by 50% (28).",
