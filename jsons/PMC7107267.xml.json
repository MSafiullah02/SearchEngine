There are many products already available that may be considered alternatives to AGP. However, the efficacy of AGP alternatives in commercial pork production has not been clearly defined, and the results of AGP alternative studies are often inconsistent (Jacela et al., 2009, 2010; Thacker, 2013; Liao and Nyachoti, 2017). This may be due to inconsistent experiment methodology, including differences in health status, genetics, experimental conditions, and diet composition (Allen et al., 2013). This leaves a significant gap in knowledge about the effectiveness of AGP alternatives and the ability to make comparisons or observe trends across studies. To most efficiently identify useful AGP alternatives and apply them in production, it is necessary first to increase the consistency with which studies evaluating AGP alternatives are conducted. Therefore, there is a need for an example protocol with guidelines for AGP alternative studies.",

The pigs were selected from a study evaluating sire lines, thus explaining the larger than normal number of sires represented in the experiment. All pigs used in the experiment came from the same sow source and were weaned at 21 d of age. On day 1 after birth, all pigs were given iron and gentamicin injections. Before weaning, pigs were treated on an individual basis with injectable antibiotics (gentamicin, ceftiofur, or enrofloxacin) as needed. At weaning, pigs were vaccinated for porcine circovirus type 2 and Mycoplasma hyopneumoniae (Circumvent PCV-MG2, Merck Animal Health, Madison, NJ), and ileitis (Porcilis Ileitis, Merck Animal Health). Due to the flow schedule at the sow source, approximately half of the pigs were weaned 4 d prior to the start of the experiment and held at the sow farm while the other half was weaned 2 d prior to the start of the experiment. For the duration of the experiment, pigs were housed in a tunnel-ventilated barn. Each pen was equipped with a 4-space automatic dry self-feeder and nipple water drinker, fully slatted concrete floors, and metal rod penning and gates. Pigs were given ad libitum access to feed and water for the duration of the experiment. An automatic feeding system (Big Dutchman, Holland, MI) was used to deliver a specified amount of feed to each pen. Air temperature in the room averaged 28.5 \u00b0C \u00b1 1.4, 28.7 \u00b0C \u00b1 1.2, 27.1 \u00b0C \u00b1 0.5, 24.5 \u00b0C \u00b1 1.1, 25.8 \u00b0C \u00b1 0.9, 26.5 \u00b0C \u00b1 2.2, in weeks 1\u20136, respectively.",

            "text": "Experimental treatments were arranged in a split-plot design with four dietary treatments evaluated across two group sizes. The dietary treatments included a negative control (NC) with no AGP, a positive control (PC) consisting of the NC diet with either chlortetracycline hydrochloride (phase 1 and 3) or tiamulin hydrogen fumarate (phase 2) added at the expense of corn, alternative diet 1 (ZA) consisting of the NC diet with zinc oxide (ZnO) plus a dietary acidifier (blend of phosphoric, fumaric, citric, and lactic acids; Kem-Gest, Kemin, Des Moines, IA) added at the expense of corn, and alternative diet 2 (DR) consisting of the NC diet with a Bacillus-based direct-fed microbial (DFM; BioPlus 2B, Chr. Hansen, Hoersholm, Denmark) plus resistant potato starch (MSP[RS], MSP Starch Products Inc., Carberry, Manitoba, Canada) added at the expense of corn. Combinations of AGP alternatives were used, rather than single products, to first help satisfy the objective of testing a study design, rather than focusing on evaluating specific products. The specific combinations were chosen based on results from Schweer et al. (2017a) which indicated that AGP alternatives in the categories of zinc/copper, organic acids, and probiotics were most effective. Furthermore, ZnO with an acidifier and a probiotic with a prebiotic likely have modes of action which either compliment or do not antagonize each other. Diets were fed in three phases (Tables 1 and 2) based on a feed budgeting system. When a pen consumed its entire allowance for a phase, feed for the next phase was given to that pen. In this manner, all pens were allowed to consume their entire budget for each phase before moving to the next phase. In order to associate pig weights with phase changes, weigh days were scheduled as close as possible to the first pens finishing their feed budget from the previous phase. Phase 1 was fed from days 0 to 11, phase 2 from days 12 to 24, and phase 3 from days 25 to 41.The first two phases were delivered in pelleted form, and the third phase feed was delivered as a mash. Feed was manufactured at two different commercial feed mills (phases 1 and 2 at the same mill, and phase 3 at another mill). Prior to diet manufacturing, the acidifier, ZnO, DFM, and RS products were hand-weighed on an analytical scale to the proper inclusion level, packaged in individual bags, and delivered to the commercial mill. Mix sheets used during mixing from both feed mills were validated after mixing to ensure that these bags were added to the proper batches. In all phases, the diet containing the DFM was mixed last in order to avoid contamination of the other three diets.",

Not counting the space occupied by each feeder, large pens had 0.41 m2 per pig, and small pens had 0.42 m2 per pig. Sixty pens were utilized for a total of 15 replicates of each diet (eight large groups and seven small groups each), 32 replicates of large groups and 28 replicates of small groups. Pigs were assigned to blocks based on weaning date, sire line, and sex. Pigs held for 4 d or 2 d post-weaning were balanced within block to account for the potential influence of days post-weaning. Since four different sire lines were used, sire line was balanced within block. Mixed-sex pens were used, and sex was balanced within block. A total of 8 blocks were used, and pens were assigned to experimental treatments so that each combination of diet and group size was represented in each block. However, since there were only 60 pens, one block had only four large groups and no small groups.",

A cotton rope was hung in the pen for approximately 1 h, and fluid was extracted from the rope by placing the saturated end into a plastic bag and squeezing out the fluid (Prickett et al., 2008). The resulting fluid samples were transferred to a plastic tube and stored at \u221220 \u00b0C until analysis. Oral fluid samples were analyzed using polymerase chain reaction (PCR) for PRRSV, Influenza type-A virus of swine (IAV-S), porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV), porcine deltacoronovirus (PDCoV), and M. hyopneumoniae. Oral fluid samples were also collected from four pens exhibiting clinical symptoms (coughing, sneezing, lethargy) and tested for PRRSV and IAV-S on day 26. Blood samples were collected from one pig per pen in two pens per dietary treatment (using the same pens as oral fluid collections) for a total of eight blood samples on days 1 and 28. At the end of the trial (day 41), eight pigs per dietary treatment (one pig from each of the large pens) were euthanized for a separate experiment and blood was collected from each. Ten milliliters of blood were collected by jugular venipuncture and centrifuged at 2,000 \u00d7 g for 10 min at 4 \u00b0C, and the resulting serum was stored at \u221280 \u00b0C for later analysis.

Consequently, Bacillus spore counts were much higher than expected, although they were also quite variable (data not shown). In the phase 1 and 2 diets, Bacillus counts in the DR diet were not as high as expected; recovery varied from 20 to 60% of expected when taking into account both the DFM in the premix and the added DFM in the DR diet. Additionally, there was a low recovery of Bacillus in the DR diet from phase 3, but spore counts were elevated in this diet compared to the NC, PC, and ZA diets. The Bacillus product was tested and confirmed to contain viable spores very close to the level specified on the product label (91% recovery). All test products were preweighed and the correct amounts per batch were delivered to the feed mills to ensure they were added at the correct quantity. Evaluation of the mix sheets confirmed that these preweighed bags were indeed added.

Some studies have shown the potential for AGP alternatives to mitigate a health challenge (Bhandari et al., 2008; Gebru et al., 2010; Heo et al., 2010); benefits of AGP alternatives to animal health during a disease challenge would be of great interest to the swine industry. Thus far, the impact of specific AGP alternatives in the presence of particular pathogens is not well understood, and information about health status is mostly absent in published AGP alternative studies (Schweer et al., 2017a). Documentation of the pathogens present in a group of pigs that may influence the outcome of a study will help to build an understanding of how AGP alternatives may perform under varying health conditions. In this study, the collection of oral fluid and serum samples as well as necropsies of pigs that died allowed for the identification or exclusion of critical pathogens, including PRRSV, as influential factors in this group of pigs. Collection and testing of diagnostic samples, especially at the beginning and end of a study, can be used to assess and document pathogen exposure. If clinical signs of illness are observed, additional samples should be collected, based on the symptoms, to characterize the illness. Major changes in health status throughout a trial should be reported. Table 7 outlines examples of potential pathogens of interest and methods of testing for them.",

When considering the RS content of the potato starch product (approximately 78%, DM basis), the DR diet in phases 1 and 2 showed only 62% recovery of expected values of RS. Since these were pelleted, the low recovery could be due to heat and water application during the pelleting process, which can cause starch to gelatinize and increase its susceptibility to degradation by alpha-amylase (Svihus and Zimonja, 2011). When possible, it is crucial to analyze diets for the AGP alternatives being tested to confirm their presence as intended, as these outcomes can influence the interpretation of study results.",

This was facilitated by careful planning and execution of the experimental protocol as well as strict record keeping and observation. The results suggest that group size is an important factor to consider when designing and interpreting AGP alternative studies. As research on AGP alternatives continues, the credibility and impact of future studies will be improved with proper design, protocol implementation, and consistent reporting of pertinent study information and results. Careful consideration of group size, sample size, the study components mentioned above, and how these factors may influence study outcomes will be advantageous to the swine industry\u2019s rate of progress in identifying effective alternatives to growth-promoting antibiotics.",
