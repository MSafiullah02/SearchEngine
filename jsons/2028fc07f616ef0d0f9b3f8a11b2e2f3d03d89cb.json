Several ICU studies suggest this risk is <5% of patients. Previously, the healthcare-associated pneumonia (HCAP) category was used to identify patients who develop pneumonia outside the hospital yet were at risk for resistant pathogens usually associated with nosocomial pneumonia [19] . HCAP criteria were not originally developed for pneumonia and their use has resulted in significant overtreatment with broad spectrum antibiotics and an associated increased mortality [19, 20] . Conversely, ignoring risk factors is associated with undertreatment and adverse outcomes [7] . In a prospective observational study, Shindo et al. found six independent risk factors for pathogens resistant to the usual CAP antibiotics: (1) hospitalization \u22652 days during the previous 90 days, (2) antibiotic use during the previous 90 days, (3) non-ambulatory status, (4) tube feedings, (5) immunocompromised status, and (6) use of gastric acid suppression medications [20] . MRSA risk factors were slightly different but overlapped. Importantly, two or more risk factors are required before the frequency of MDR pathogens justifies empirical broad-spectrum therapy, resulting in far less use while still identifying the majority who would need broad-spectrum therapy. New CAP guidelines will offer an alternative to the HCAP criteria but these will also need validation.",

A community-acquired MRSA (CA-MRSA) clone, distinct from that usually causing nosocomial pneumonia, has emerged as a cause of pneumonia with striking necrotizing features [7] . Antibiotic therapy that also suppresses toxin production provides better outcomes and improved survival, as illustrated in a retrospective study of PVL-positive CAP [14] . Clindamycin and linezolid suppress in vitro formation of PVL, \u03b1-hemolysin, and toxic shock syndrome toxin-1, whereas vancomycin and beta-lactams have no effect. The benefit of clindamycin in MSSA isolates resistant by susceptibility testing is unclear, since the correlation of susceptibility with toxin-suppression activity is uncertain. While preferred treatment for PVL-positive MSSA CAP is still unclear, linezolid appears the most reasonable choice for CA-MRSA CAP in light of its potential to suppress exotoxin and greater eradication in other MRSA clones.",
