Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) is a successful precedent for containment of emerging coronaviruses based on elimination of the primary reservoir. Although the pathogens of SARS and MERS are both coronaviruses, two major factors lead to different control results. First, although the number of human SARS cases is greater than for MERS, most were due to a so-called super-spreader strain. By contrast, all clades of MERS coronavirus are shared by camels and humans, indicating that MERS coronavirus can easily spill-over from camels to infect humans.3 Second, palm civet, the intermediate amplifying host of SARS coronavirus, is an exotic animal that could easily be controlled by banning wild animal trading. However, the intermediate host of MERS coronavirus (dromedary camel) is an important livestock for the Middle East, with key roles in transportation, food, and fabric (wool); thus, it is impossible to eliminate all camels.",

Unfortunately, serological surveys showed a very high prevalence (up to 100%) of MERS coronavirus-neutralising antibodies in dromedary camels.4 Therefore, it seems impossible to eliminate this disease by mass slaughtering of positive animals. Vaccination of camels seems to be the only choice, but no licensed vaccine for camels is currently available, although several vaccines are in development.5 Additionally, GLS-5300 has been reported to also be immunogenic in camels.6 Camels are not used routinely in research and, for most laboratories, it would be hard to attain enough animals and work with them. Moreover, they are too big to study in most biosafety facilities. These limitations restrict vaccination tests in camels.",

If the virus continues to circulate in camels, it might attain new mutations that enable human-to-human transmission, resulting in the generation of super-spreader strains.
