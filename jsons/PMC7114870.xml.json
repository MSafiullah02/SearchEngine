MERS-CoV was first identified in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia in 2012, which is a single and positive stranded RNA virus (de Groot et al., 2013). As of 8th July 2019, 2,428 laboratory-confirmed cases of MERS worldwide, including 838 associated deaths, with a mortality rate of 34.5 %, were reported. Dromedary camels are widely considered as the source of the transmission of MERS-CoV (Hemida et al., 2017). The rate of human transmission among household contacts of MERS patients has been approximately 5 % based on serological analysis (Drosten et al., 2014). However, nosocomial super-spreading events occurred in South Korea in 2015 and the rapid and widespread of MERS-CoV from May to July 2015 raised strong concerns regarding the possible generation of mutations with enhanced sequential human infection (Cho et al., 2016).",

Since the MERS outbreak in South Korea, 13 new viral genomes from 14 infected Korean patients were isolated, and 12 of these genomes were identified to possess a point mutation in the receptor-binding domain (RBD) of the S glycoprotein (Kim et al., 2016a, b; Min et al., 2016). Specifically, 11 of these genomes showed an I529 T mutation in RBD, and 1 showed a D510 G mutation, which exhibits reduced affinity of RBD to its cellular receptor, human dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP4; also known as CD26), compared with the wild type RBD, suggesting that MERS-CoV adaptation during human-to-human spread may be driven to escape from neutralizing antibodies, rather than to evolve for a stronger affinity to DPP4 (Kim et al., 2016b; Park et al., 2016). Therefore, several mAbs against different epitopes within S might be used as a prophylactic or therapeutic agent to avoid the immune escape of the virus.",

In this study, we produced recombinant RBD, S1, S2, and S\u0394TM proteins from insect cells using baculovirus and induced neutralizing antibodies from the mice by immunization with each subunit protein. We developed mAbs by hybridoma technique and several mAbs were selected and characterized for their neutralizing activity against 15 different MERS-CoV S-pseudotyped virus and wild type KOR/KNIH/002. The results of this study are expected to contribute to the development of diagnostic tools of MERS-CoV S mutation as well as for mAb-based therapeutics.",

We selected the 7 mAbs from 77 hybridomas based on the specific binding ability to each S subunit and characterized their neutralizing activity against diverse MERS-CoV S pseudoviruses: six mAbs were developed by S\u0394TM showing specific binding affinity to non-RBD S1, and RBD; the other one mAb was produced by S2 subunit protein immunization. Polyclonal serum developed by S1 showed high neutralizing activity against both EMC/2012 and KOR/KNIH/002 S pseudovirions, which was comparable to S\u0394TM immunization (data not shown). However, we failed to obtain potent neutralizing mAbs from S1-immunized mice under our experimental condition. Our RBD-specific mAbs, RBD-14F8, -23D3, -25E4, -40G7, and -43E4, showed higher neutralizing potency than other non-RBD-binding mAbs (S1-6E6 for non-RBD S1, and S2-14H8 for S2), which is consistent with the fact that most reported neutralizing mAbs are RBD-specific (Pascal et al., 2015; Wang et al., 2018; Ying et al., 2014). The mAbs developed by other groups, CDC-C2, m336, and REGN3051, also bind to RBD and potently neutralize MERS-CoV (de Wit et al., 2018; Pascal et al., 2015; Wang et al., 2018; Ying et al., 2014).

In contrast, the transduction of pseudovirions with the change of V534A in RBD of EMC/2012 was not inhibited by any of our mAbs. Interestingly, two mAbs, RBD-14F8 and RBD-43E4, did not neutralize another pseudovirion with specific mutation in RBD region: RBD-14F8 could not neutralize the pseudovirions with changes in the amino acid residue at 506, 510, and particularly at 509 site (D509 G); meanwhile, RBD-43E4 did not neutralize pseudovirions with the mutation at 529 amino acid residue (I529 T) compared with the EMC/2012 strain S sequence. A single amino acid change in the RBD region was identified in 2015 Korea outbreak patients and it was reported that the mutation of either D510 G or I529 T reduces the viral affinity to human cellular receptor DPP4 (Kim et al., 2016b). In our experiments, lower luciferase activity was also observed in 786O target cells after pseudovirus infection with D510 G or I529 T mutation. The mAb CDC-C2 developed by US NIH possessed binding affinity to RBD and lost neutralizing effect against pseudovirions with mutations at 509, 512, 534, 536, 539, 540, or 542 amino acid residues from EMC/2012 strain S amino acid sequence (Wang et al., 2018). The common amino acid that influences the loss of neutralization between CDC-C2 and our RBD-14F8 mAbs is the 509 residue. S2-binding S2-14H8 showed partial neutralizing activity against all tested pseudoviruses, and non-RBD S1-binding S1-6E6 did not hinder cell entry of the entire tested pseudoviruses at all. More structural data are needed to determine precise epitopes for each neutralizing mAb and the mechanisms by which combining the mAbs might delay viral escape.",

However, symptoms often appear after the peak of viremia; combined neutralizing mAbs therapy would have to be used before the onset of symptoms to be early enough to avoid viremia.

Among 77 hybridomas, selected 15 hybridomas (1 by S1, 11 by S\u0394TM, and 2 by S2) were tested for their neutralizing activity against indicated pseudovirions. Four ten-fold serial dilutions from 1/5 of hybridoma culture supernatant were used for EMC/2012 pseudovirions, and undiluted culture supernatant was used for KOR/KNIH/002 pseudovirions. C. Binding domain of selected mAbs within S protein. Seven mAbs were purified, and each binding region was assessed using ELISA. The value indicates the OD after coating the 96-well plate with each S subunit antigen.",
