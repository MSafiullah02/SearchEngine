Although an almost bewildering variety of infectious agcnts has been reported as causing diarrhoea in calves, few agents have been shown to do so commonly. A convenient rule of thumb is that 5 micro-organisms are both common and proven entero-pathogens in neonatal calf diarrhoea: 2 viruses, rotavirus and coronavirus; the protozoan Cryptosporidium; Salmonella spp. ; and cnterotoxogenic strains of Escherichia coli (ETEC). In addition, mixed infections are common.",

That rotavirus is ever-present in the foal's environment is exemplified by the common occurrence of severe rotavirus diarrhoea in very young foals which have received inadequate colostrum. Foals kept with their dams separate from all other foals usually remain free of rotavirus problems. IHowever, it is common practice to graze young foals, at least in daytime in a nursery paddock, and then move them on when older. This offers potential for a build up of faecal contamination in the nursery paddock and would not be regarded as sound management by cattle farmers. A calf group is retained in one field and calves horn subsequently from separate groups are kept independently, thereby obviating pathogen passage through a succession of susceptible neonates.",

Because rotaviruses are enzootic in all populations, virtually all dams transfer antibody to their offspring. There are important differences both within the ungulate species and between the ungulates and man in the mechanisms of transfer. Human infants acquire the major part of the transferred antibodies in utero, whereas ungulates are effectively born agammaglobulinaemic. Cow colostrum contains antibodies which are predominantly IgG, and are acquired from the circulation and ruminant milk contains only low concentrations of IgC1. IgA predominates in mare colostrum and significant concentrations of IgA produced in the mammary gland continue to be secreted in post-colostral milk. Traditional emphasis has been placed on the importance of early colostral feeding and immunoglobulin absorption to ensure neonatal viability. However, there is good evidence that such absorbed antibodies in circulation offer relatively poor protection against rotavirus infection, in which there is no viraemic phase and infection is confined to gut enterocytes.",
