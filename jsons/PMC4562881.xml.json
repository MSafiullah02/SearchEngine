            "text": "Young children, after the elderly, have the next highest influenza disease burden with pediatric cases representing \u223c1\u20135% of annual influenza deaths [1]. Indeed, influenza-related hospitalization rates in children under 4 years are comparable to hospitalization rates in those over 85 years old [2]. Increased disease burden in young children reflects immune system immaturity, lack of previous influenza exposure, poor hygiene, and high communal contact in schools. Highlighting the high influenza transmission risk in children serological data from Hong Kong during the H1N1/2009 pandemic showed that 43% of children aged 5\u201314 years were infected early in the pandemic compared to \u223c5% of those aged 30\u201359 years [3]. The Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the American Academy of Pediatrics recommend that annual influenza vaccination be extended to all children over 6 months of age [4]. Because they are mostly immunologically naive to influenza young children generally require two doses a month apart to achieve seroprotection [4]. A recent Cochrane review estimated the efficacy of trivalent inactivated influenza virus (TIV) vaccine in preventing influenza at 59% in children over two years old [5]. Neither TIV or live attenuated influenza virus (LAIV) vaccines are indicated for children under 6 months due to poor neonatal immune responses to inactivated vaccines and increased respiratory side effects from LAIV vaccines [6]. This leaves infants under 6 months of age highly vulnerable to influenza infection, making it imperative to identify strategies to better protect this population.",

            "text": "Safety considerations must always be paramount when developing vaccines for young children given their sensitivity to pyrogens and febrile convulsions [7]. For this reason whole virus vaccines are relatively contraindicated in young children and highly purified split or subunit antigens are preferred [8]. This reduces vaccine pyrogenicity but at the expense of reduced immunogenicity. Adjuvants could be used to enhance the immunogenicity of influenza vaccines, however only a very limited number of adjuvants have been tested in young children and there is no guarantee that an adjuvant effective in adults will be similarly effective in neonates. Highlighting the potential difficulties in developing safe and effective influenza vaccines for young children, a split TIV vaccine (Fluvax\u00ae, CSL, Australia) was withdrawn from pediatric use after causing increased febrile convulsions [9], with an estimated three excess hospitalizations with febrile convulsions for every influenza hospitalization prevented [10]. Furthermore, Pandemrix\u00ae, a monovalent inactivated vaccine adjuvanted with AS03 (an emulsion of squalene oil, dl-\u03b1-tocopherol and polysorbate 80) was found during the 2009 influenza pandemic to be associated with an increased rate of narcolepsy among European children aged 4\u201319 years [11]. An MF59-adjuvanted influenza vaccine was recently shown after two immunizations a month apart to induce higher antibody titers than unadjuvanted vaccine in children aged 6\u201336 months [12]. However, no influenza vaccine has yet been shown to be effective and safe for infants under 6 months of age making it imperative to develop an effective influenza vaccine for these very young infants.",

Advax enhanced humoral and cellular immunity in mice to inactivated influenza antigen, translating into improved protection against influenza challenge [22]. This vaccine was safe even when administered to pregnant mice, overcoming pregnancy-associated immune suppression and enhancing vaccine immunogenicity in pregnant dams and with a secondary benefit of enhanced protection of pups via breast milk transfer of influenza-specific IgG [23]. Advax similarly enhanced vaccine protection of adult ferrets against high pathogenicity avian H5N1 influenza [24]. In a clinical trial of a pandemic influenza vaccine it was confirmed in adults to enhance seroprotection with minimal side effects [25]. To date, Advax adjuvant has not been tested in infants. Given the problem of vaccine hyporesponsiveness in young children, the current study was undertaken to test the ability of Advax adjuvant to improve influenza vaccine immunogenicity and protection in neonatal mice. A particular objective was to test whether Advax adjuvant could be used to achieve single-dose influenza protection of neonates, thereby helping avoid the need for two immunizations as currently recommended for influenza protection of young children over 6 months of age [4].",

In all cases, 100% lethality was always observed in control unimmunized infant mice. Mice were infected by intranasal administration of 30 \u03bcl of A/H1N1 virus. A sickness scoring system based on coat condition, posture and activity was used to assess the extent of clinical disease. Mice were evaluated daily and scored for individual symptoms. Ruffled fur (absent = 0; slightly present = 1; present = 2), hunched back (absent = 0; slightly present = 1; present = 2) and activity (normal = 0; reduced = 1; severely reduced = 2) were evaluated.

Although an intramuscular immunization route is often used in adult immunization studies, it is not possible to use this route to administer vaccine to very small pups and hence the subcutaneous (s.c.) route was used. Seven-day-old BALB/c pups were immunized s.c. in the hind limb with 1, 5 or 15 \u03bcg of iH1N1 with or without Advax adjuvant. When they reached 4 weeks of age immunized pups were challenged intranasally with homologous influenza virus. Immunization with iH1N1 alone provided no protection of pups, with rapid weight loss and death by 10 days post-challenge, even at the highest 15 \u03bcg iH1N1 dose (Fig. 1\n). By contrast, complete protection was seen in pups immunized with 15 \u03bcg iH1N1 + Advax adjuvant (100% survival) with the pups continuing to gain weight throughout the challenge period consistent with a lack of clinical disease. Partial protection was also seen in pups immunized with 5 \u03bcg iH1N1 + Advax (60% survival), although the survivors lost \u223c20% body weight before recovering. Immunization with 1 \u03bcg iH1N1 + Advax was not protective (0% survival). This indicated that 7-day-old neonatal mice could be protected with a single high dose of iH1N1 providing it was formulated with Advax adjuvant.",

Immunized pups were bled at 3 weeks of age for measurement of serum anti-influenza antibodies and then challenged at 4 weeks of age with homologous virus. Pups immunized with iH1N1 + Advax had significantly increased serum influenza-specific IgM, IgG1, IgG2a and IgG2b levels 3 weeks post-immunization, whereas pups immunized with iH1N1 alone had low to undetectable levels of all antibody isotypes (Fig. 2A). To compare relative amounts of each antibody isotype in immunized pups, surface plasmon resonance (SPR) was performed using pooled pre-challenge sera from each vaccine group. This revealed that pups immunized with iH1N1 + Advax produce predominantly IgM and to a lesser extent IgG1, but not IgG2a, 2b or 3 (Fig. 2B). This contrasted with the result of previously published studies in adult mice where immunization with iH1N1 + Advax induced IgG2a and 2b as well as IgG1 [22], [23]. This suggests that the 7-day-old pups had a marked Th2 isotype bias to influenza immunization, consistent with data reported elsewhere [26]. A subset of immunized pups from each group were sacrificed 2 weeks post-immunization and the frequency of influenza-specific IgM and IgG antibody secreting cells (ASC) measured by ELISPOT. Consistent with serum antibody, a significantly increased (\u223c3\u20134 fold) frequency of influenza-specific IgM and IgG ASC was seen in the spleens of pups immunized with iH1N1 + Advax versus those immunized with iH1N1 alone (Fig. 2C). When challenged at 3 weeks post-immunization, pups immunized with iH1N1 + Advax gained weight, had minimal clinical disease and had high levels of survival (survival 8/9, 89%, p\n < 0.0001). By contrast, pups immunized with iH1N1 alone, lost weight, had high clinical scores and all succumbed to infection (Fig. 2D).",

Pups immunized with iH1N1 + Advax had significantly higher (\u223c2\u20133 fold) influenza-stimulated recall production of IFN-\u03b3, IL-2, IL-4, and IL-10, but not IL-6 or TNF, when compared to pups immunized with iH1N1 alone (Fig. 3A). Thus although neonates typically have impaired Th1 vaccine responses [27], immunization with iH1N1 + Advax adjuvant was able to overcome this defect and enhance T-cell IFN-\u03b3 production. We next tested by cytokine ELISPOT whether higher cytokine recall responses in Advax-immunized pups reflected an increased frequency of influenza-specific memory T cells. Consistent with the bulk cytokine production data, pups immunized with iH1N1 + Advax had \u223c3\u201310 fold higher frequencies of IFN-\u03b3, IL-2, IL-4, and IL-17 secreting memory T cells when compared to pups immunized with iH1N1 alone (Fig. 3B). Thus, immunization of pups with iH1N1 + Advax adjuvant successfully overcame neonatal immune immaturity at both the B- and T-cell level, resulting in increased influenza-specific serum antibody levels, and increased frequency of anti-influenza memory B cells and Th1, Th2 and Th17 memory T cells.",

We asked, therefore, whether influenza protection in iH1N1 + Advax immunized pups was dependent on memory B- or T-cells. \u03bcMT mice lack mature B cells and ability to make antibody [28]. Hence, to test the role of memory B cells in neonatal protection we immunized C57BL6 wildtype (WT) or \u03bcMT pups with iH1N1 + Advax and then challenged them with influenza virus 3 weeks post-immunization. As previously observed, C57BL6 WT pups immunized with iH1N1 alone lost weight and succumbed to infection, whereas those immunized with iH1N1 + Advax survived and gained weight throughout the challenge period (Fig. 4\n). By contrast, all neonatal \u03bcMT pups including those immunized with iH1N1 + Advax lost weight and died. This indicates that protection of pups with iH1N1 + Advax requires functional B cells and is not conferred by memory T cells alone. Consistent with this result, CD8 T-cell depletion of iH1N1 + Advax immunized WT pups at the time of challenge did not reduce survival, indicating that CD8 T cells were not required for protection of Advax-immunized WT pups (Fig. 4). We next asked whether the inability of T cells to provide protection in \u03bcMT pups reflected an inability of neonates to make cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTL). To address this question we performed in vivo CTL assays post-challenge in WT pup survivors previously immunized with iH1N1 + Advax. Neonatal iH1N1 + Advax-immunized survivors all exhibited a high level of target cell killing indicating that they were able to generate anti-influenza CTL's in response to viral exposure (data not shown).",

For example, an alum-adjuvanted influenza vaccine provided no protection in neonatal mice [29], despite use of a very similar influenza model to the one in the current study. This can be explained by the fact that alum adjuvant has reduced ability to induce IgG production, B-cell affinity maturation and germinal center formation in neonates [30]. The squalene oil emulsion adjuvant MF59 is currently the only adjuvant in an approved human seasonal influenza vaccine. It was recently reported that immunization of neonatal mice at 7 and 21 days of age with MF59-adjuvanted influenza vaccine failed to provide protection or to enhance antibody titers, consistent with a complete lack of MF59 effectiveness in neonates despite it enhancing protection in older infant and adult mice given the same two dose vaccine regimen [31]. This stands in marked contrast to the outcomes seen in the current study where Advax adjuvant induced high serum levels of IgM and IgG1 in 7-day-old mice after just a single vaccine dose and protected them against an otherwise highly lethal influenza challenge. Hence, Advax adjuvant appears unique in its ability to overcome neonatal immune hyporesponsiveness and induce vaccine protection in such young mice.",

            "text": "Neonatal mice did require a higher antigen dose than adult mice for complete influenza protection. Neonatal mice are known to have higher susceptibility to lethal influenza than adults [32], which likely reflects immaturity of both innate and adaptive immune systems and similarly increased neonatal susceptibility to influenza is also seen in human epidemiological data [1]. This high neonatal susceptibility to influenza makes the search for an effective neonatal vaccine strategy imperative. How the influenza antigen requirement required for complete protection of neonates in the current study might translate to doses needed to protect human neonates cannot be predicted in advance of human studies, but it must be noted that the vaccine regimen used in the current study was protective after just a single dose, whereas typically even older human infants require at least 2 doses for seroprotection. The World Health Organization consequently recommends that infants aged 6\u201335 mouths receive two 7.5 \u03bcg doses of split influenza vaccine a month apart. Hence even though a high dose of antigen was needed in the current study for single dose protection of neonates, there should be considerable scope to reduce the neonatal vaccine dose by using a more typical two-dose regimen of Advax-adjuvanted influenza vaccine. For example, in adult mice we have found protection with a two-dose regimen requires as little as one-hundredth the dose required for single-dose protection. In future studies we will confirm whether a two-dose regimen of Advax-adjuvanted influenza vaccine significantly reduces the antigen dose required for neonatal protection.",

Neonatal protection with Advax-adjuvanted influenza vaccine was not dependent on CD8 T-cell immunity as protection was observed even when CD8 T cells were depleted prior to challenge. The fact that T cells were unable to mediate protection in immunized neonates in the absence of antibody was surprising as the T-cell cytokine phenotype generated in immunized pups appeared very similar to the phenotype previously seen in adult mice in which T-cell protection could be demonstrated [22]. This suggested that T cells in immunized pups might have a defect in effector function, e.g. in cytotoxic T lymphocyte (CTL) differentiation. However when in vivo CTL assays were performed post-challenge in surviving iH1N1 + Advax immunized WT pups, high levels of killing of influenza peptide-labeled target cells was seen (data not shown), suggesting the neonatal T cells were indeed able to differentiate into CTLs. The lack of T-cell protection in neonatal \u03bcMT pups could instead reflect slower differentiation of neonatal CD8 T cells into lytic CTL effectors, with delayed CTL differentiation having been shown to be the reason for defective neonatal protection against herpes simplex virus [33]. Furthermore, in contrast to adults, neonatal T cells were shown to fail to proliferate and migrate into the lungs in response to influenza infection, consistent with qualitative differences in neonatal and adult T-cell function [32].",

Impaired antibody production and affinity maturation in immunized neonates have been correlated with impaired expansion of T follicular helper (TFH) lymphocytes, as shown in neonatal mice immunized with tetanus toxoid absorbed to alum adjuvant [34]. Poor neonatal germinal center formation post-immunization has been correlated with a delayed maturation of follicular dendritic cells (fDCs) [35]. Notably, MF59-adjuvanted influenza vaccine failed to induce germinal centers and antibody responses in 7-day-old mice associated with a failure of induction of functional TFH cells [31]. Thus most adjuvants with the exception of Advax are incapable of correcting neonatal immune defects in B-cell function. The central importance of TFH and fDC in optimal neonatal vaccine responses suggests that Advax through a yet to be determined mechanism improve activation and expansion of neonatal TFH cells and/or fDCs.",

This is interesting as Th2 recall responses typically dominate in neonates [36]. Both murine [37] and human [38] newborns have been reported to have impaired IL-17 and IFN-\u03b3 responses, with the latter caused by low dendritic cell IL-12 production [27]. It was therefore surprising that Advax-adjuvanted vaccine induced such a robust IFN-\u03b3 (Th1) recall response in neonates. The mechanism by which Advax overcame the normal neonatal Th2 bias is not known but may potentially be very advantageous. Excess Th2 bias can cause eosinophilic lung immunopathology as has been seen after either SARS coronavirus (SARS)[39], or respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) [40] immunization. A recent study showed formulation of inactivated or recombinant SARS vaccine with Advax adjuvant not only enhanced protection against SARS but also prevented eosinophilic lung immunopathology [39]. Hence, the ability of Advax adjuvant to enhance neonatal Th1 responses and reduce their otherwise overwhelming Th2 bias could be of major benefit for neonatal vaccines particularly where there might be risk of Th2 bias otherwise inducing eosinophilic lung immunopathology.",

Children are highly prone to febrile convulsions and at least one seasonal inactivated influenza vaccine has had to be withdrawn due to excess reactogenicity and pyrogenicity in young children [10]. Although in this study 7-day-old pups received exactly the same Advax dose (1 mg) previously used in adult mouse studies, no adjuvant-related adverse effects were observed. Future dose-response studies will test whether lower doses of Advax can be used for pups. However it was a testament to Advax's safety that pups which weighted just a few grams were able to tolerate the full adult dose. When administered to adult mice, even human sized doses of 10\u201320 mg of Advax did not induce pyrexia (unpublished data). While we had no means to measure temperature in the 7-day-old pups, there was no indication of pyrexia post-immunization, which in neonates would typically be associated with a loss of body weight. Similarly, no adverse effects on pregnant dams or their pups were observed when Advax was administered during pregnancy [23]. Advax has also already been shown to be safe and well tolerated in adult human trials, with no evidence of any potential to induce pyrexia [25], [41].",

There is an ongoing need for an influenza vaccine effective in children under 6 months. The challenge now will be to see whether this promising murine data with Advax adjuvant translates into similar benefits in larger animal models and ultimately in human infants.
