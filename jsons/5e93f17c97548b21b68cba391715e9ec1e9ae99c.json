Health system leaders would clearly see delaying elective procedures as a loss. Additionally, the majority of people exhibit \"time discounting\"-they value a gain received now more than the equivalent gain received later. 5 This is also referred to as hyperbolic discounting because the rate of the discounting changes in time. A person may choose to receive $100 right now rather than $120 one month from now but might reverse that choice when choosing between $100 in a year and $120 in 13 months even though the delay is the same. 6 A hospital administrator, especially one who believes that they have a robust supply chain, might see rescheduling elective cases as a loss today with an uncertain probability of regaining that case in the future. That activates the double intrinsic behavioral pressures of loss aversion and time discounting of a future gain. Even if the facility might still capture that case in the future, because of time discounting, it would not value that future case as much as one done today.",

If there are future problems at the facility, either from lack of resources to perform cases or lack of revenue resulting from deferred cases, hospital leaders have assumed an unquantifiable amount of risk. Personal tolerance of this risk may affect the leader's decisionmaking. Risk-seeking choices and risk-taking choices may involve distinct neural pathways that may be modifiable. 8 Time discounting affects how future gains or losses are valued, and the impact of time discounting may be modulated by motivation. This phenomenon has been implicated in problematic behaviors. 9 Loss of reputation can influence behavior and drive people to contribute to the common good, thus avoiding the tragedy of the commons. 10 Because of time discounting, however, the future loss to the reputation of a facility from not cooperating with restricting cases is less valued.",
