The cDNA clone allows introduction of specific mutations and exchange, deletion, or insertion of genes or gene fragments. Unfortunately, full-length cDNA clones of many RNA viruses have proved difficult or even impossible to clone and amplify in Escherichia coli. Full-length clones have frequently turned out to be noninfectious, possibly due to spontaneous mutations or deletions, which reduces toxicity to E. coli. The cause for the toxicity to E. coli is not known, but it has been observed that artificially introduced deletions; insertions or frame shifts can alleviate the cloning problems (1, 2).",

Upon inoculation of the cDNA to the host cell, the intron is precisely spliced from the precursor nuclear messenger RNA (pre-mRNA) in the nucleus, and a true copy of the viral RNA is transported to the cytoplasm where infection can start. The function of clones with introns requires cloning of the viral cDNA between promoter and terminator sequences, which are active in the host cell. The 35S promoter and NOS terminator are frequently used in plants (see Chaps. 32 and 33 for a description of construction of infectious clones of RNA viruses). Cloning of the viral cDNA in this context also allows inoculation by agroinfiltration, if the transcription cassette is moved to a binary vector (see Chap. 38 for a description of agroinoculation).",

Furthermore, introns are characterized by high U or AU content compared to more GC-rich exons. In the sequence next to the intron, there is a high representation of A and G at the two positions next to the 5\u2032 end of the intron and G at the first positions 3\u2032 to the intron (10). This is shown as a consensus sequence in Fig. 1. Therefore, it is probably safest to insert introns at positions in the virus sequence matching the AG/G consensus.",

Furthermore, it should be noted that the monocot sequences included in the analysis by (10) almost exclusively represent introns from the order Poalis. Some differences have been observed between species within the dicots (9). However, at present there is no evidence that differences in dicot introns are important for their use in virus clones. For example, Arabidopsis introns were used in Tobacco mosaic virus, which efficiently infected two species of Nicotiana (11), and an intron from Solanum tuberosum is spliced in Pisum sativum and Capsicum annuum (1, 6).",

The bands containing the PCR products are cut out of the gel and the DNA is purified from the gel using a gel band purification kit. Spin columns are very efficient and are provided by several commercial suppliers, for example GFX columns (Amersham Biosciences), MinElute and QIAquick (Qiagen), GenElute\u2122 (Sigma), and SpinPrep\u2122 (Novagen).

            "text": "\nIt is likely that sequences surrounding the intron may affect splicing efficiency, and the virus may contain cryptic 5\u2032 and or 3\u2032 splice sites, which can interfere with splicing of the true intron. The presence of cryptic splice sites in the virus sequence can be identified using, for example, the \u2018NetPlantGene Server\u2019 at http://www.cbs.dtu.dk/services/NetPGene/. To prevent cryptic splicing it may be necessary to eliminate either the 5\u2032 or the 3\u2032 splice site. This may be accomplished by silent mutations (Marillonnet et al., 2005). In our experience, cryptic sites do not seem to be a major problem if the goal is to generate an infectious clone because only a fraction of the transcripts need to be correctly spliced to initiate infection. However, insertion of true introns can improve the specific infectivity as demonstrated by Marillonnet et al. (2005). It is also known that sequences in the exon, known as exon splicing enhancers (ESE), are likely to play an important role in plant intron splicing. However, no splicing event in Arabidopsis has yet been shown to be enhancer dependent. For more information see http://www.tigr.org/software/SeeEse/background.html\nPrimers 1FW and 6RV should contain the sequence of the restriction sites SiteA and SiteB, or flank the sites so the restriction sites are contained within the PCR fragments. If the primers contain the restriction sites, the restriction site consensus should be placed at least three nucleotides from the 5\u2032 end of the primer.The length of the annealing sequence will depend on the GC content. It is advisable to use a longer primer for regions with low GC content.Optimal annealing temperature depends on the melting temperature of the primers and the system used. Annealing at 55\u00b0C is usually a good starting point unless one of the primers anneal to a short and very AT-rich region. In this case, the annealing temperature should be lower.The optimal annealing temperature will depend on the primer sequences, but in our experience 55\u00b0C is a good starting point.PCR fragments are most conveniently cloned using PCR cloning kits adapted for cloning PCR products with dA overhangs or blunt ends. Although the PCR products described here contain restriction sites at least three nucleotides from the ends of the fragment, it is sometimes difficult to clone PCR fragments with the aid of such sites.Multiple fragment ligations can facilitate reinsertion of the fragment containing the intron if the restriction sites SiteA and SiteB are not unique in the full-length clone. We have assembled potyvirus clones from up to five fragments with sticky ends in a single cloning step. The amounts of DNA of each fragment are adjusted when the fragments are cut from the agarose gel and can be purified together on a single spin column\n",
