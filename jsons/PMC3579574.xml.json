Unfortunately, we are currently unable to provide vaccines against many clinically relevant lower respiratory tract pathogens, nor are we able to fully predict the identity of future outbreaks. This global vulnerability has been clearly illustrated by several epidemics in recent memory, including the newly emerged coronavirus, SARS-CoV outbreak of 2002, various influenza strain reassortments (H5N1 \u201cbird flu\u201d and H1N1pandemic), and bioterrorism events involving pathogen aerosolization. Thus, there is an urgent and crucial need for the development of broad-spectrum, rapidly acting vaccination strategies.",

Therefore, the lung relies on an intricate network of sentinel dendritic cells, antimicrobial secretions, and resident macrophages for defense. Importantly, immune responses in the lung must be tightly regulated to promote immunity, while avoiding tissue damage associated with either the pathogen or the host response. As such, pulmonary immune responses are quite unique, and as suggested by others, the individual history of specific pathogen exposures to the lungs may contribute to shaping the appropriate ensuing immune responses to subsequent challenges [1], [2], [3], [4]. Here (and elsewhere [5]), we further demonstrate that virus-like particles (VLPs), which are unrelated to the antigen of subsequent challenge, can similarly impact the lung microenvironment, without the associated pathology, thereby shaping future immune responses. Many groups have previously suggested that the lung may provide an important route of delivery for mucosal vaccination [6], [7], [8]. However, the potential for utilizing localized mucosal vaccination strategies in the lower respiratory tract have historically been overlooked, and approaches which elicit tissue-specific immune responses are just beginning to be developed. An FDA-approved tribute to the realization of this strategy is the highly effective Flumist vaccine, which is delivered intranasally, and provides better comprehensive local immunity than injectable versions [9], [10], [11].",

Here, we describe a mechanism by which we can enhance primary local immune responses to antigens without the necessity of specific antigen priming. We achieved this result by intranasally delivering empty virus-like particles (VLPs), which act to modulate the lung microenvironment, and harness and focus immune responses. Recent exploration in the utilization of nanoparticles [12], [13], [14], virus-like particles [15], [16], [17], [18], [19], [20], [21], and viruses which have no mammalian cell tropism, has shown that these platforms are naturally immunostimulatory, and likely utilize evolutionarily conserved cell surface receptors, thereby safely engaging immune signaling pathways without replicating [22], [23], [24], [25], [26]. Furthermore, many of these strategies are currently on the market or undergoing clinical trials, and have already had broad global impact in safely preventing disease [21], [27], [28], [29]. Importantly, virus-like particles can be produced in large quantities, provide a stable product, often are amenable to lyophilization or freeze-drying, and are fiscally economical. These features are especially important for less industrialized nations.",

The small heat shock protein 16.5 (sHsp) from Methanocaldococcus jannaschii (a hyperthermophilic archaeon) is comprised of 24 repeating subunits [30], [31]. These subunits self-assemble to produce an empty cage-like structure, comparable to that of a virus capsid by virtue of the high symmetry and quaternary structure [5], [32], [33], [34]. We have previously shown that sHsp can be genetically engineered to incorporate cysteine residues, thereby providing attachment sites for bioconjugation [33], [35], [36], which we exploit here for the display of a foreign protein, similarly to described strategies [37], [38]. P22 is a bacteriophage capsid which infects Salmonella typhimurium (when intact tail fibers are present) [39], [40]. The P22 used here is devoid of both genetic material and tail fibers, and is therefore composed of only the non-infectious empty viral capsid. We would like to note here that previously we have referred to the sHsp nanoparticles as \u201cprotein cage nanoparticles\u201d or PCN [5]. However, we now find it to be more descriptive to classify both the sHsp and P22 as virus-like particles, given their structural architecture and immunological parallels to other particles described in the literature. Importantly, neither sHsp nor P22 target known mammalian pattern-recognition receptors, nor do they infect mammalian cells. And while the immunomodulatory potential in exploiting non-pathogenic viruses is still in its infancy, others have begun to describe similar successful strategies [24], [25], [26].",

This immunization strategy is advantageous because it accelerates and intensifies the primary immune response, after only a single dose. We further show that conjugating a model antigen (OVA) to sHsp elicits an immune response to OVA which mirrors the response to the sHsp itself. sHsp conjugation also acts to adjuvant OVA, and the local delivery of sHsp and antigen complexes induce potent local IgA secretion in sHsp pretreated mice. Therefore, we show that VLPs (sHsp and P22) can be used as both immunomodulatory agents by pretreating the lung and/or as a carrier of antigens, allowing local immunization of the lower respiratory tract against a pathogen of interest, with a single dose. This platform could be useful for both pre- and post-exposure prophylaxis.",

In a slight modification of the previously described protocol, the supernatants from 2 L of cell culture were combined and concentrated to 10 mL with a 100k MWCO amicon filter (Millipore, Billerica, MA) prior to size exclusion chromatography on a Superose 6 column (GE Healthcare, Piscataway, NJ) so that purification of large amounts of sHsp could be accomplished efficiently. In order to remove residual protein contaminants, additional steps were added to the previous protocol. The fractions containing sHsp from size exclusion chromatography were re-concentrated to 10 mL and purified by anion exchange on a Sepharose Q column (GE Healthcare) using a linear gradient from 300 mM to 800 mM NaCl in 25 mM HEPES Buffer at pH 7.3. Following this, the fractions containing sHsp were dialyzed overnight into 50 mM phosphate, 100 mM NaCl, and 5 mM EDTA, at pH 7.3, concentrated a third time to 10 mL, and re-subjected to size exclusion chromatography using a Superose 6 column (GE Healthcare) with the same buffer. For the S121C sHsp variant protein, tris(2-carboxyethyl)phosphine (Pierce, Rockford, IL) was added to a final concentration of 2 mM during each amicon concentration step prior to the FPLC runs to inhibit disulfide formation between external thiols on sHsp. The sHsp protein concentration was determined via UV\u2013visible spectroscopy using an extinction coefficient of A280 = 0.565 (mg/mL)\u22121 as previously documented [33].",

Instead, one s.c. dose of 100 \u03bcL OVA\u2013sHsp, OVA with sHsp admixture, OVA with alum (10% AlkSO4) admixture, alum alone (10% AlkSO4), or OVA alone (0.57 mg/mL) were injected and antibody titers were measured over time. For influenza challenge studies, 1500 plaque forming units (pfu) A/PR8/8/34 influenza virus were delivered in 50 \u03bcL i.n. In experiments to determine the impacts of residual LPS, mice were similarly pretreated with \u201cLPS-high\u201d P22, \u201cLPS-low\u201d P22, an equal amount of LPS as in the \u201cLPS-high\u201d P22, or sterile pyrogen-free PBS in 50 \u03bcL i.n. All mice were then rested, and subsequently challenged with 100 \u03bcg sHspG41C in 50 \u03bcL i.n.",

Simultaneously, we determined how pretreatment of the lung with a heterologous VLP, P22, affects the subsequent response to antigen challenge. BALB/c mice were pretreated with either P22 or vehicle (PBS) intranasally (i.n.) in five doses and then allowed to rest for 72 h. Mice were then challenged with OVA conjugated to sHsp (OVA\u2013sHsp), OVA and sHsp separately in solution (OVA\u2013sHsp admixture), OVA alone, or sHsp alone. Serum was then collected at a range of timepoints post-antigen challenge for kinetic analysis. We found that mice which had received the P22 pretreatment, followed by a single dose of the OVA\u2013sHsp conjugate, produced high amounts of OVA-specific serum IgG as early as 4 days post-challenge (Fig. 2A). This combination far outperformed any of the other treatment scenarios in both rapidity of antibody production and amount. Interestingly, the next highest antibody producing group, at early timepoints, was those mice that had also been challenged with the single dose OVA\u2013sHsp conjugate, but had been pretreated with vehicle (PBS) only. This group also produced significantly higher antibody titers than the remaining combinations, although the response was delayed by about one day, as compared to those mice which had received P22 pretreatment (P22/OVA\u2013sHsp conjugate). The remaining groups however, did not achieve the same peak titers until day 14 post-challenge, if at all, and equal early responses were delayed by 3\u20134 days (P22/OVA\u2013sHsp admixture) or more (PBS/OVA\u2013sHsp admixture), as compared to the P22/OVA\u2013sHsp conjugate group.

However, we had yet to define the immune response to sHsp itself. Therefore to determine the rate and intensity of the sHsp-specific antibody response we again pretreated mice intranasally with P22, or vehicle. Mice were then rested for 72 h, and challenged with the OVA\u2013sHsp conjugate, the OVA and sHsp admixture, OVA alone, or sHsp alone. We then evaluated the sHsp-specific serum antibody response over 14 days post-challenge (Fig. 3A). We found that after only one challenge dose, all mice exposed to sHsp generated strong sHsp-specific IgG1 responses, which peaked as early as day 5 post-challenge in mice which had been pretreated with P22. Mice that did not receive P22 pretreatment were again two days delayed in the production of similar amounts of sHsp-specific antibody. However by day 7 post-challenge, all groups (except control OVA-only challenged mice) had generated similar levels of systemic sHsp-specific IgG1 in response to a single intranasal dose of sHsp antigen. Thus, the above-described OVA-specific response (Fig. 2) mirrors the accelerated kinetics of the sHsp-specific response, indicating that sHsp facilitates a carrier effect that results in an immune response to OVA that is similar to the response to the sHsp in both onset of antibody production and quantities produced.",

At day 7 post-challenge, we determined the level of OVA-specific serum IgG subclasses, and found that both the conjugated and admixture preparations of OVA elicited high-titer serum antibody O.Ds., while no such response to OVA alone was seen (Fig. 4A). Interestingly however, the OVA\u2013sHsp conjugate promoted accelerated class-switching to IgG2a, IgG2b and IgG3 while only IgG1 was significantly detected for the admixture. To further determine the early events of isotype switching, we pretreated mice with either sHsp or vehicle, and challenged with the OVA\u2013sHsp conjugate, or admixture. At days 0, 4, and 6, serum was collected and the OVA-specific IgG subclasses were determined by ELISA. We found that OVA-specific total IgG and IgG1 production was quicker by about two days in mice that had been pretreated with sHsp and challenged with the conjugated OVA\u2013sHsp (Fig. 4B and C) as compared to the other treatments. The early IgG1 response in this group then translated into an enhanced production of class-switched IgG2a and IgG2b at day 6 post-challenge (Fig. 4D and E). This extent of isotype switching was not fully realized in any other group. Interestingly however, the enhanced class-switching capacity appeared to be more dependent upon the structure of the challenge antigen (OVA\u2013sHsp conjugate vs. admixture) than the pretreatment with sHsp. Mice which had received only PBS pretreatment and had been challenged with the OVA\u2013sHsp conjugate generated significantly higher IgG1, 2a, 2b, and IgG3 titers at day 6 post-challenge than those which were challenged with the admixture of sHsp and OVA (Fig. 4C\u2013E and G). Very little IgG2c was produced at any timepoint (Fig. 4F). Thus, sHsp acts as an adjuvant when mixed with OVA and acts as a carrier when conjugated to OVA, resulting in unexpectedly potent antibody titers as early as 4 days after a single immunization in na\u00efve mice.",

Again, the OVA and sHsp admixture elicited high titer antibody responses, as did the OVA and alum admixture, however, these combinations required more time to produce similar results.

After pre-treatment with sHsp or PBS, and challenge with either the OVA\u2013sHsp conjugate or the admixture, lung lavage fluids contained high levels of mucosal IgA and IgG in only those mice pretreated with sHsp (Fig. 5A and B). Local IgG production was further enhanced by the conjugation of sHsp to OVA (Fig. 5B). Notably, while many of our results demonstrate that the admixed OVA and sHsp preparation does not elicit the same enhancement as the conjugate, here, the admixture is equally potent in initiating mucosal IgA responses (Fig. 5A). sHsp thus serves a dual role\u2014first as an immunomodulatory agent during pretreatment, and second, as an adjuvant for specific antigens. Furthermore, we found that the pretreatment of the lung with sHsp caused an upregulation of the polymeric Ig receptor (pIgR) on lung epithelial cell surfaces prior to antigen challenge (Fig. 5C). Thus, the capacity for the release of local secretory IgA into the airway lumen is enhanced by sHsp pretreatment.",

In both tissues, GC B cells were more prevalent by at least one log in sHsp-primed mice before infection, indicating that the microenvironment within the lung and local lymph node had been stimulated to adjust to the current antigenic exposure. We also found that T follicular helper (TFH) cells were more abundant in both the lungs and TBLNs of sHsp-primed mice (Fig. 7C and D). Thus, germinal center reactions were more easily facilitated within the lungs and local lymph nodes of sHsp-primed mice. Over the course of infection, a clear advantage in GC organization and establishment was observed as both GC B cells and TFH cells retained significantly higher numbers in sHsp-primed mice as opposed to controls. Thus, highly active GC reactions, complete with TFH cell help, were likely facilitating the enhanced antibody isotype switching and elevated antibody production.",

Interestingly, we found that in the lung, plasma cells at day 0, assumedly secreting antibody against sHsp, were markedly more abundant in primed mice. However, the number of cells present rapidly declined over the course of the influenza infection, which may represent profound plasticity in the specificity of the inhabitants of GC areas of the lung (as has been described by others) [48]. In the TBLN, plasma cells were again more numerous before infection in the sHsp-primed mice. However, here, they remained elevated as compared to control mice until the resolution of infection, at which point the plasma cell numbers in the TBLNs of both groups converged. Unlike the lung however, similar trends were followed by both groups in the TBLN. We surmise from this data that sHsp-specific plasma cells in the lung are decreasing, while simultaneously, influenza-specific plasma cells are increasing. Therefore, due to the likely variable rates of influx and efflux, we may not have exclusively quantified the rate of increase in influenza-specific plasma cells due to sHsp priming. What remains puzzling however is how sHsp-specific germinal centers and plasma cells become influenza- or OVA-specific at an accelerated rate when compared to control mice. Given our experimental data, we surmise, as have others [2], that the pulmonary microenvironment adjusts in the context of innate, humoral, and cellular immune responses in reaction to the menagerie of antigenic exposures encountered, which are unique to that individual. Thus, sHsp pretreatment significantly enhances the efficiency of future immune responses.",

We demonstrate here that both sHsp pretreatment, and the conjugation of sHsp to an antigen of interest, provided enhanced immunity, by likely distinct immunological mechanisms. Pretreatment with sHsp elicited the organization of GCs in the lungs and TBLNs, which then functioned to accelerate and intensify the onset of antibody production. Most importantly, pre-priming of the lung with sHsp elicited an enhanced mucosal IgA response, and the upregulation of epithelial pIgR. This response is not dependent upon the physical conjugation of OVA to sHsp, as the OVA and sHsp admixture elicited IgA production equally well. For local BALF IgG production, however while sHsp pretreatment seemed to be the factor majorly responsible for the enhanced antibody titers, the conjugation of sHsp to OVA also contributed. Finally, heterologous VLP pretreatment was equally efficient at eliciting heightened immunity, as demonstrated with P22 pretreatment followed by OVA\u2013sHsp challenge, and sHsp pretreatment followed by influenza challenge. While heterologous immunity has been extensively described in both the context of cross-protective immunity, and inappropriate or harmful skewing, the underlying mechanisms are still incompletely defined [1], [2], [3], [48], [49], [50], [51]. We demonstrate here that pretreatment of mice with non-pathogenic VLPs stimulated immunity through some type of priming, which resulted in a subsequent enhanced response to OVA, and furthermore, facilitated pathogen clearance and decreased damage in response to viral challenge (Fig. 5, Fig. 6 and Ref. [5]).",

In contrast to the conjugation of antigenic peptides to a multivalent scaffold, we present the conjugation of an entire protein antigen to the protein cage surface for in vivo application. Through this approach, it is possible for the conjugated antigen to be seen by the immune system as part of the VLP, and elicits a response similar to that the VLP elicits. As previous work has demonstrated that chemical conjugation efficiency of large unrelated proteins to a viral capsid is inhibited as the size of the protein is increased [38], conditions for the chemical conjugation of the 45 kDa OVA to the sHsp cage were optimized for these proteins. We observed that the attachment position on the sHsp cage, the length of the chemical linker, and the stoichiometry of linker labeling affected the conjugation efficiency.",

Interestingly, while we have utilized sHsp in two scenarios, as a pretreatment, or a vaccine delivery platform, and these scenarios likely are working through distinct immunostimulatory mechanisms, the activities of each are not mutually exclusive, and can in fact, synergize\u2014as the antibody responses to the conjugated OVA\u2013sHsp are enhanced by the pretreatment with either sHsp or P22.",

And as it has been suggested by others, cell surface integrins on antigen-presenting cells likely play a role in recognizing viral capsids [22], [23], [25]. Targeting evolutionarily conserved domains therefore facilitates plasticity in this delivery system, allowing for the utilization of sHsp conjugation with other antigens\u2014especially those which have complicated or precluded the design and manufacture of potent vaccines. Additionally, the complex geometry of the OVA\u2013sHsp conjugate may be impacting the resultant immune responses observed. It has been well demonstrated that the specific geometric display of multivalent antigens significantly heightens immune responses [20], [52], [53], and especially B cell recognition [52], [54], [55], [56], and further, that such displays may even provide enough co-stimulation to break tolerance to self-antigens without the need for adjuvants [55], [57]. Thus the arrangement of the OVA\u2013sHsp conjugate may explain the enhanced class-switching which we observed only in those mice which received the conjugated form of OVA\u2013sHsp (Fig. 4A\u2013G). We therefore demonstrate the utility in displaying a poorly immunogenic antigen as a multivalent array through the conjugation to a VLP platform to elicit enhanced specific immunity.",

Ovalbumin was initially reacted with a commercially available crosslinking reagent, SM(PEG)6, to produce a maleimide functionalized OVA (Aii) with n number of linkers attached. The functionalized OVA was reacted with sufhydryls on the sHsp S121C cage (Ai) to yield an OVA\u2013sHsp conjugate (Aiii). The samples used for in vivo administration were analyzed by SDS-PAGE (B), and Western Blots with detection for either sHsp (C) or OVA (D). The lanes for each panel correspond to: sHsp S121C (i), OVA (ii), OVA\u2013sHsp conjugate (iii), and an unlinked admixture (iv) of sHsp S121C (i) and OVA (ii).",
