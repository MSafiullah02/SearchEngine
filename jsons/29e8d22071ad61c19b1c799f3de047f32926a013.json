            "text": "The etiology of porokeratosis is unknown. An autosomal dominant mode of inheritance has been established for PM, PPPD, disseminated superficial porokeratosis (DSP) and DSAP. The similarities of clinical appearance and histopathology as well as the coexistence of different variants of porokeratosis in one patient or in several members of an affected family make us consider them as different phenotypic expressions of a common genetic aberration. 2 Reed and Leone have proposed a mutant clone of epidermal cells expands peripherally, leading to formation of a cornoid lamella at the boundary between the clonal population and normal keratinocytes in porokeratosis. The tendency for abnormal clones to develop is probably inherited, and additional triggering factors such as ultraviolet light, photochemotherapy and loss of immunocompetence (HIV infection, organ transplantation) lead to clinical manifestation. 2,3 An alternative hypothesis is that an inflammatory mononuclear infiltrate composed of helper T cells, suppressor T cells and Langerhans cells beneath the cornoid lamella may provide a mitotic stimulus for overlying keratinocytes. 4 The optimal treatment procedure must be selected depending on lesion size and localization, and functional and aesthetic requirements. Excision and grafting, cryotherapy, electrodesiccation, dermabrasion and CO 2 laser are all options. 2 Topical 5-fluorouracil is effective in PM, linear porokeratosis and in DSP and DSAP. Oral retinoids have conflicting results. Excellent results were obtained with oral retinoids in some patients with DSAP, widespread PM, PPPD, and linear porokeratosis. With retinoid therapy cytologic atypia has disappeared. Retinoids may have an inhibitory effect on cutaneous carcinogenesis in porokeratotic lesions. 2,10 One must be aware that relapses usually follow several weeks or months after discontinuation of retinoid therapy. 1 The giant porokeratosis lesion on the left hand of our patient was totally excised and grafted. Fifteen of the porokeratosis Mibelli lesions were treated by cryotherapy, and these lesions healed with macular atrophy. Malignancy was not detected by histopathological examination in the excised giant porokeratosis lesion.",

There are few reported cases of cicatricial alopecia due to sarcoidosis, which predominantly affects black women with evidence of intrathoracic sarcoidosis and cutaneous involvement at other sites. [8] [9] [10] [11] Cases of nonscarring alopecia have also been reported, either with localized involvement or with total alopecia. 9 The high incidence of systemic involvement in reported cases indicates that a systemic work-up is needed when scalp sarcoidosis is diagnosed. This entity is usually resistant to treatment. 8 There are no definitive diagnostic tests. A biopsy (skin, preitracheal nodes, or salivary glands) should be performed to obtain histologic confirmation of noncaseating granulomas in addition to pulmonary function tests, electrocardiography, slit-lamp eye examination, and tuberculin /anergy testing. 4, 5 Because sarcoidosis of the scalp may exhibit markedly variable morphologies, we emphasize that sarcoidosis should be considered in the differential diagnosis of plaques or nodules of the scalp as well as both cicatricial and noncicatricial alopecia.",

During the SARS period, N95 masks were recommended by the CDC and World Health Organization (WHO) for use when healthcare workers came into contact with confirmed or suspected SARS patients. They provided at least 95% filtration against oil-free particles and needed to be worn tightly against the face to be effective. It was not surprising to see acne occurring in the regions of the face covered by the masks. Donning of these masks over prolonged periods of time creates a humid \"tropical\" skin microclimate conducive to a flare-up of acne. Alternatively, the flare-up could have been a consequence of simple pilosebaceous duct occlusion due to local pressure on the skin from the close-fitting masks.",
