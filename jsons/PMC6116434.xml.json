Located at chromosome 19q13, the IFN-\u03bb gene family consists of four newly identified members: IL-29 (IFN-\u03bb1 or IFNL1), IL-28A (IFN-\u03bb2 or IFNL2), IL-28B (IFN-\u03bb3 or IFNL3), and IFN-\u03bb4 (IFNL4). IFN-\u03bbs are mainly produced by monocytes, macrophages, DCs, and bronchial epithelial cells in response to viral infections [4]. IFN-\u03bbs bind to a distinct receptor complex (IL-28RA/IL-10R\u03b2) that is primarily expressed by cells of epithelial origin (respiratory, intestinal, and reproductive tract epithelial cells, hepatocytes, and keratinocytes) and myeloid linage [4]. IFN-\u03bbs exert highly circumscribed antiviral effects through intracellular activation of antiviral host factors in the infected cells, similar to the type I IFNs [5]. Accumulating evidence suggests that IFN-\u03bbs have a unique role in regulating innate and adaptive immune responses targeting microbial infections of epithelial cells expressing cognate receptor complexes [4, 6].",

The expression of type I IFNs and type I IFN-inducible genes is significantly increased in patients with SLE, pointing to a role of type I IFNs in SLE pathogenesis [7\u201310]. High levels of circulating type I IFNs and type I IFN-induced cell activation are heritable traits in families with SLE, suggesting that the alleles responsible for a strong type I IFN activation pathway are risk factors for the development of SLE [11\u201313]. While IFN-\u03bbs mediate antiviral functions similar to the type I IFNs [4], the role of IFN-\u03bbs in the development of SLE remains unknown as the IFNL locus was not revealed by genome-wide association studies (GWAS) [14, 15]. In particular, the IFN-\u03bb3 SNPs (rs8099917, rs12979860, and rs4803217) in strong linkage disequilibrium with the IFN-\u03bb4 SNP rs368234815 (TT/\u0394G) have been suggested to influence IFN-\u03bb3 mRNA stability, IFN-\u03bb3/4 expression, ISG levels, and the response to IFN-\u03b1 treatment [16]. The present study was aimed to investigate whether the IFN-\u03bb3/4 genes are associated with SLE susceptibility and disease phenotypes in Taiwanese.",

To investigate the independent association between SLE clinical characteristics and SNP alleles/genotypes, multivariate logistic regressions were performed.

To account for multiple testing, Benjamini and Hochberg\u2019s linear step-up method was carried out using the SAS MULTTEST procedure [19].

For confirmation, another cohort of 182 SLE (100 with nephritis and 82 without nephritis) patients was used for lupus nephritis findings.",

We examined the single-locus association of four candidate SNPs in 831 SLE patients and 1620 healthy controls.

Nevertheless, the association between IFNL3/4 SNPs and SLE susceptibility was not significant after adjustment for sex and age (PFDR > 0.10). Subsequently, we analyzed the association between IFNL3/4 SNPs and SLE susceptibility after stratifying SLE patients based on positivity of lupus nephritis. As shown in Table 2, all minor IFNL3/4 SNP alleles were significantly associated with SLE susceptibility in patients negative for nephritis compared to healthy controls adjusted for sex and age (rs8099917G, PFDR = 0.00177, OR 1.68, 95% CI 1.24\u20132.28; rs12979860T, PFDR = 0.00299, OR 1.58, 95% CI 1.18\u20132.32; rs4803217A, PFDR = 0.00176, OR 1.65, 95% CI 1.22\u20132.23; and ss469415590\u0394G, PFDR = 0.00176, OR 1.70, 95% CI 1.26\u20132.29).

IFN-\u03bbs inhibit neutrophil recruitment and activation, preventing the amplification of inflammation. Furthermore, IFN-\u03bbs could completely halt and reverse the development of collagen-induced arthritis [33].

IFNL3 3\u2032-untranslated region (UTR) SNP rs4803217 significantly influences AU-rich element-mediated IFNL3 mRNA decay. IFNL3 mRNA containing the minor rs4803217A allele is much less stable than that with the major rs4803217C allele. Therefore, the major rs4803217C allele is a high IFN-\u03bb3 producer while the minor rs4803217A allele is a low IFN-\u03bb3 producer [43]. It is reasonable to assume that the most common IFNL3/4 SNP haplotype rs8099917T/ss469415590/rs12979860C/rs4803217C containing the rs4803217C allele is a high producer of IFN-\u03bb3, which is assumed to suppress the development of autoimmune inflammation [33]. We found that the most common IFNL3/4 SNP haplotype containing the rs4803217C allele was significantly associated with the low risk for SLE in nephritis-negative patients, confirming that a high producer of IFN-\u03bb3 may have a protective role against SLE.",

Nevertheless, IFN-\u03bb4 peptide produced from the IFNL4 ss469415590\u0394G allele is a dysfunctional cytokine [22], which may explain the defective HCV clearance in Africans, Europeans, and Asians with the IFNL4 ss469415590\u0394G allele [20, 22\u201324, 44, 45]. On the other hand, the major ss469415590TT allele with a disrupted IFNL4 open reading frame is associated with the increased expression of IFN-\u03bb3 [21, 23, 24]. Our study revealed that the minor rs3682134815\u0394G allele carrier is also a risk for SLE susceptibility in the subset of SLE patients negative for lupus nephritis, indicating that the expression of dysfunctional IFN-\u03bb4 in combination with the low IFN-\u03bb3 production has a role in the pathogenesis of SLE. IFN-\u03bb3 levels have been linked to SLE disease activity, complement, and autoantibody (anti-Ro/SSA) status [46]. In the current study, we found that high levels of IFN-\u03bb3 were significantly associated with high SLEDAI and complement depression. The increased production of IFN-\u03bb3 in SLE patients with a high SLEDAI may reflect an intrinsic mechanism to suppress chronic inflammation. IFN-\u03bb3 levels may be a useful biomarker for SLE disease activity.",

We speculate several possible explanations. First, IFN-\u03bbs possess the highest cytotoxic potential as they induce more robust cell death than type I IFNs and type II IFNs [47]. Kidney cells express the IFN-\u03bb3 receptor and could be very susceptible to IFN-\u03bb-induced apoptosis, leading to necrotic inflammation and kidney injury. Indeed, we have detected both IFN-\u03bb3 (IFNL3) and IL-28 receptor alpha in kidney tissue, suggesting a pathogenic mechanism of IFN-\u03bb3 in the development of SLE nephritis. Second, the high levels of proinflammatory cytokines such as type I IFNs and IL-6 in SLE patients may reverse the anti-inflammatory action of IFN-\u03bbs, which subsequently exacerbates kidney injury under the circumstances of inflammation. Indeed, in patients with chronic hepatitis C (CHC), while the favorable genotypes responsible for high levels of IFN-\u03bb production increase viral clearance, patients with the high IFN-\u03bb-producer genotypes were twice as likely to develop adverse clinical outcomes [48, 49]. Finally, the IFNL3/4 risk SNP haplotype may be in linkage disequilibrium with unidentified causative SNPs and/or may interact with other genes to cause lupus nephritis. Nevertheless, the IFNL3/4 locus at chromosome 19q13 has never been identified to contain risk gene(s) for SLE susceptibility by GWAS [14, 15]. The absence of association of IFNL3/4 SNPs with SLE in previous studies could be explained by our observation that the IFNL3/4 SNPs are a risk factor for SLE susceptibility in the subset of lupus nephritis-negative patients. Further mechanistic studies are needed to pinpoint the precise role of IFN-\u03bbs in the development of lupus nephritis.",
