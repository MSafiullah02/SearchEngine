However, patients suffering from COVID-19 may also present with symptoms of upper respiratory tract infection, such as a sore throat (5\u201314%) and/or rhinorrhea (4%) [7, 8]. Carriers of COVID-19 may shed a heavy viral load into the environment even if they are asymptomatic or present with very subtle symptoms [9, 10]. Recently, anosmia, hyposmia and dysgeusia, which affect patients\u2019 senses of smell and taste, were identified as symptoms of COVID-19, with high prevalence in Europe, Korea and China [11]. Patients who develop a symptom related solely to their sense of smell or taste before developing respiratory symptoms consistent with COVID-19 may seek consultation with otolaryngologists and receive treatment for rhinitis or neuritis. An asymptomatic patient may still have infectious potential, therefore it is important to have a high level of suspicion and adopt safe practices and precautions.",

This alerted the precaution of drug administration and aerosol generating procedures in subsequent outbreak of viral disease and the application of appropriate personal protective equipment for safety of healthcare personnel. At the beginning of the outbreak of COVID-19, all suspected and confirmed cases were admitted to hospital for COVID-19 test and those patients with negative result were discharged. This created a considerable workload to Hong Kong public healthcare system and suspension of non-urgent service. With a large number of the suspected cases returning to Hong Kong from Mainland China, Europe, United States and Asian countries with high prevalence of COVID-19, all people were quarantine at home or isolation camps for observation. Only those with subsequent symptoms after arrival to Hong Kong or suspected history and positive test for COVID-19 were admitted to hospital. This had significantly reduced the congestion in the public healthcare system and preserved the capacity to see those patients in need of treatment.",

Health seminars on COVID-19, which were organized by the infection control team to all hospital staff on daily basis across the whole month, provided a direct platform from which to educate healthcare personnel about the virus, its mode of transmission, the course of the disease, management and the mortality rate. These seminars also enabled otolaryngologists and their nursing staff to share information with the infection control team, particularly regarding proper concepts of infection control in terms of hand hygiene, the donning and doffing of personal protective equipment, the handling of suspected or confirmed cases of COVID-19, contact tracing, the proper disposal of clinical waste and the handling of specimens for any laboratory investigations. This was particularly important, as the OHNS specialty involves a large number of surgical procedures targeting the nose, pharynx and airway, which are performed in clinics, wards and operating rooms. These procedures are often aerosol and respiratory droplet generating.",

During a 6-week period, the OHNS clinic rescheduled more than 2800 cases with no complaints; only a minority of patients wanted to keep their original appointments, whereas more than 95% of patient visits were successfully rescheduled. Drug refills were provided to stable patients without consultation by an otolaryngologist, depending on each patient\u2019s clinical condition, and new follow-up appointments were offered. Patients were triaged at clinic fulfilling the FTOCC criteria: Fever, Travel history, Occupational exposure, Contact history and Clustering phenomenon were segregated and managed in a separate room with surgical mask on while calling the infection control team for assistance.

In our institutes, our group of otolaryngologists also reached a consensus for definitions of several common procedures associated with a potential risk of aerosol generation (Table 1). As a negative-pressure airborne infection isolation room (AIIR) was not available at our clinic, endoscopic procedures were performed in a designated room equipped with an IQAir\u00ae HealthPro\u00ae 100 (Incen AG, Switzerland) . This device contains a HEPA class H13 filtration system that can filter 99.97% of all particles > 0.3 \u03bcm. Additionally, patients were asked to wear a surgical mask at all times before entry to the hospital area, except during the examination to minimize the dispersal of droplet nuclei during patient transfer [12]. In the clinic, all of the fiberoptic endoscopes were labeled with code numbers that were recorded for contact tracing. We strongly preferred to perform endoscopic procedures while wearing high-level personal protective equipment (PPE) (e.g., face shield, N95 respirator, long-sleeved disposable fluid-resistant gown and disposable gloves) (Table 2). From July to December 2019, our clinic performed an average 1890 of fiberoptic endoscopy procedures and 292 rigid endoscopy procedures per month. From February to March 2020, however, the rescheduling of services and very conservative provision of endoscopy examinations reduced the number of fiberoptic and rigid endoscopy procedures to only 134 and 47 per month, respectively, which corresponded to service reductions of 93 and 84%, respectively.\n",

Therefore, healthcare personnel in the ward were required to wear high-level PPE when examining any patients. The number of staff in the ward procedure room was strictly limited to reduce the potential exposure to SARS-CoV-2, and a team of one otolaryngologist with one or two healthcare assistants was preferred. Patients who required urgent consultations with the Accident and Emergency or other clinical departments and presented with fever and respiratory symptoms were subjected to a COVID-19 polymerase chain reaction (PCR) test unless their situation was desperate (Fig. 1). The turnaround time for the COVID-19 PCR test was within 6 h.

Consequently, our department adopted the extended use of PPE such as N95 respirators and protective gowns [14]. Specifically, healthcare personnel used only one N95 respirator and protective gown during the same session of clinical duty, irrespective of the number of patients who were seen, provided that the PPE was not grossly contaminated by blood or body secretions. Face shields were used to protect the contamination of surgical masks or N95 respirators so that extended use was possible. A plastic apron was worn over the protective gown and disposed if it became contaminated, thus eliminating the need to remove the inner protective gown. These PPE-saving measures were required despite the above-described administrative measures intended to reduce patient visits. Using this strategy, the weekly consumption of isolation gowns, N95 respirators and full-face shields decreased from 163 to 59 pieces, 163 to 47 pieces, 163 to 46 pieces, which represented a reduction of 64, 71 and 72% respectively, relative to the initial levels.",

Anesthetists should ensure that the patient is fully paralyzed to facilitate a smooth intubation. Two disposable high-efficiency bacterial and viral hydrophobic filters should be placed in the expiratory circuit of the ventilator. Airway suction must be performed in a closed system during the procedure. Moreover, the apnea technique should be adopted during fenestration of the tracheal wall and insertion of the tracheostomy tube.

Patients with head and neck squamous cell carcinoma were therefore assigned a high priority, followed by those with high-grade salivary gland cancer and undifferentiated nasopharyngeal carcinoma. In contrast, papillary thyroid cancer, which has a much more favorable prognosis and a 10-year survival rate > 90%, was considered a lower priority [21]. Early operations were allocated to the resection of bulky tumors in the larynx or hypopharynx, as this might avoid complete airway obstruction requiring an emergency tracheostomy. Small oral cavity tumors were also prioritized, as a delay in treatment might necessitate a more complex reconstruction (e.g., free flap reconstruction), which would lead to more significant morbidity, a longer operating time and a longer hospital stay. With the available weekly operative list for patients suffering from head and neck cancers, 9 cases were operated in February and March 2020.",

In China, nearly 3400 healthcare workers had contracted COVID-19 and 13 had died by early March 2020 [31].

Accordingly, the number of suspected COVID-19 cases in Hong Kong as of March 29, 2020 was approximately 5798 with only 641 confirmed cases [33]. As we started our contingency plan very early with zealous education of the health care personnel and public, we could attain zero infection rate in our health care workers in the hospitals and no otolaryngologists in Hong Kong were infected. However, the situation could be worsened if outbreaks were not under control in Europe, the U.S.A., Canada, Australia, Southeast Asia and the Middle East. Although the duration of the COVID-19 pandemic cannot be predicted accurately, some experts in Hong Kong claimed that it will not end until a SARS-CoV-2 vaccine becomes commercially available. Therefore, we may need to revise our clinical practice guidelines and protocols for OHNS from the perspective of infection control, as our clinical services cannot be reduced indefinitely in the face of a long pandemic. Tele-consultation provided a good tool to see our patients who could not attend the clinic because of quarantine regulation of Hong Kong, cities lockdown in China or suspension of clinic service in our hospitals. The feedback from patients was excellent as they were very grateful to be seen by their doctors distantly from their home or office through their mobile phones while the hospitals were under intense pressure on manpower and beds in this pandemic. In future practice of ENT, each consultation room would install HEPA filter and electronic endoscopes for nose, throat, and ear examination in order to keep distance from the patients. Negative pressure ventilation should be installed in at least one consultation room to cater for highly suspected or confirmed case of highly infectious viral diseases. Finally, we hope our clinical experiences will be useful to professionals in the specialty of OHNS and related multidisciplinary services during this COVID-19 pandemic.",
