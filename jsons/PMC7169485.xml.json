The beneficial effects of IFN\u2010I are well appreciated in numerous viral experimental models as inducers of antiviral state. Type I interferon is one of the few successful antiviral treatments in therapeutic clinical use, as in chronic hepatitis C infections 2. Viral infections of most somatic cells result in an early synthesis of IFN\u2010I production. Specialized cells called plasmacytoid dendritic cells (pDCs) are the major IFN\u2010I producers 3 and mediate systemic IFN\u2010I responses following viral infections 4. The primary role of IFN\u2010I is to limit initial viral replication and to facilitate subsequent adaptive immune responses. IFN\u2010I is a multifunctional cytokine that positively influences cells of both innate and adaptive immunity and therefore is considered as a bridge that links innate and adaptive immunity (reviewed in 5). With a few exceptions of chronic viral infections 6, 7, most studies agree that IFN\u2010I is protective against acute viral infections. This has been clearly demonstrated in knockout mouse studies, in which mice deficient of functional IFN\u2010I receptors are highly susceptible to viral infections, such as influenza virus 8, encephalitic flaviviruses 9, Schmallenberg virus 10 and lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus 11.",

However, in contrast to the role of IFN\u2010I in response to a viral infection, the effect on the host in the case of bacteria may be either beneficial or detrimental (Table 1). The precise mechanism/s behind this dualistic effect of IFN\u2010I on bacteria is not fully understood, but recent studies have provided some insights into how IFN\u2010I can suppress antibacterial immunity. For example, Teles et al.12 reported that the in vitro induction of IFN\u2010I by human monocytes in response to Mycobacterium leprae promotes the production of the anti\u2010inflammatory cytokine IL\u201010. IL\u201010 together with IFN\u2010I synergistically limits the production of type II IFN (IFN\u2010\u03b3) 12, an important effector cytokine against bacterial infections. In a mouse model of Francisella tularensis and Listeria monocytogenes infections, IFN\u2010I was shown to suppress gamma delta T cell/IL\u201017 responses and a subsequent neutrophil recruitment 13. As both IL\u201017 and neutrophils play an important role in antibacterial immunity (reviewed in 14), IFN\u2010I is highly detrimental to the host during F. tularemia infections. Regardless of differences in reported mechanism/s, it is clear that IFN\u2010I can enhance the host susceptibility to certain bacterial pathogens by suppressing the host's antibacterial immunity.",

Consistent with epidemiology studies, mouse models of viral diseases show enhanced susceptibility to secondary, unrelated viral episodes following primary viral infections 16, 21. While the biological role of partial lymphocyte activation during a primary infection is not yet understood, its consequence, a refractory period of an IFN\u2010I response to secondary infections, has attracted attention due to their clinical implications 5, 16. We showed that an unrelated secondary adenovirus infection following a primary Semliki Forest virus (SFV) infection fails to trigger partial lymphocyte activation for a duration of 5\u20139 days post\u2010primary infection due to IFN\u2010I exhaustion 16. We found that IFN\u2010I levels are below the detection limit at day 1 after a secondary viral infection, and the hosts regain its capacity to mount IFN\u2010I responses 9 or more days after a primary viral infection. Thus, it is likely that IFN\u2010I exhaustion is responsible for the heightened susceptibility to secondary viral infections.",

This is largely due to information gained from the devastating Spanish influenza pandemic of 1918 when the majority of deaths were due to bacterial co\u2010infections or subsequent bacterial infections 22, 23. In the case of the 2009 Swine flu pandemic, 18~34% of influenza episodes admitted to intensive care units worldwide were due to complications caused by bacterial co\u2010infections 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29. Of these cases, Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus pneumoniae were the most commonly isolated bacterial pathogens. These pathogens colonize the upper respiratory tract and nasopharyngeal cavity 30, 31, and it has therefore been hypothesized that influenza infections allow outgrowth of colonized S. pneumoniae or S. aureus and result in mucosal co\u2010infections 32, 33, 34. Such secondary infections occur most frequently at 5\u201310 days after primary viral infections, thus suggesting that a transient immunosuppression may be responsible for the bacterial outgrowth. A mechanism proposed for a synergism between influenza and S. pneumoniae suggests that the antiviral IFN\u2010I response elicited by the primary influenza virus infection enhances the susceptibility of the host to secondary bacterial challenge via suppression of antibacterial immunity 34, 35, 36.",

M. tuberculosis is a clinically important bacterial pathogen that latently infects one\u2010third of the world's population. Negative effects of IFN\u2010I during M. Tuberculosis infection have repeatedly been shown 38, 39, 40, 41. However, with an exception of highly virulent strains 40, M. tuberculosis does not generally induce strong IFN\u2010I responses 42 despite possessing a Toll\u2010like receptor (TLR)\u20109 agonist (DNA\u2010containing CpG motifs), which is a potent IFN\u2010I inducer. This phenomenon has been recently explained, namely the detection of mycobacterial lipoproteins through TLR\u20102 inhibits the TLR\u20109 signalling pathway 42, 43 via depletion of a signalling molecule, IL\u20101R\u2010associated kinase 1, and thereby in turn suppresses IFN\u2010I production during M. tuberculosis infections. This TLR\u20102\u2010dependent negative regulation of the IFN\u2010I response during M. tuberculosis infections is likely to be beneficial to the host by limiting the harmful effects of IFN\u2010I. This inhibitory mechanism may also play a positive role during other bacterial infections as TLR\u20102 recognizes a wide range of bacterial pathogens. What is interesting is that TLR\u20102 signalling impairs TLR\u20107\u2010, TLR\u20109\u2010 but not TLR\u20103\u2010induced IFN\u2010I synthesis 42, 43. This in turn explains why influenza virus co\u2010infections in M. tuberculosis\u2010infected mice impairs bacterial control in an IFN\u2010I\u2010dependent manner 44. Influenza virus generates multiple ligands of pattern recognition receptors during the viral replication cycle, which includes dsRNA (TLR\u20103 agonist) and ssRNA (TLR\u20107 agonist). Thus, influenza virus infections can override TLR\u20102\u2010dependent inhibition of IFN\u2010I responses in M. tuberculosis\u2010infected mice through TLR\u20103 signalling and induce IFN\u2010I responses that ultimately result in outgrowth of M. tuberculosis. These findings provide answers as to why the risk of influenza death was higher among patients with tuberculosis than non\u2010tuberculosis patients during an influenza pandemic 37.",

Severe forms of viral\u2013bacterial co\u2010infections are rare and only seen when the virus itself is highly virulent such as the 1918 Spanish influenza virus 23. In fact, according to the Centre for Disease Control and Prevention, only 29% of fatal cases of patients with H1N1 influenza had bacterial co\u2010infection 45. When the primary viral infection is highly pathogenic, it is difficult to ascertain whether the increased susceptibility is due to suppression of antibacterial immunity or the consequence of viral pathology itself. We hypothesize that severe forms of viral\u2013bacterial co\u2010infection are an exception to the rule and that in most cases, that is, with less virulent viruses, primary infections do not lead to severe secondary bacterial pathology. Thus, there have to exist immune mechanisms that limit secondary co\u2010infections.",

We also know from our previous studies 16 and reports from others 21 that IFN\u2010I deficiency as a consequence of exhaustion occurs after primary viral infections and the host is rendered more susceptible to secondary unrelated viral infections during this transient period of IFN\u2010I exhaustion. Based on these observations, we hypothesize that the host evolved a negative feedback loop mechanism to limit IFN\u2010I production, which is rapid but transient rendering the host less susceptible to opportunistic bacterial infections that are more prevalent than secondary unrelated virus infections. This transient deficiency in IFN\u2010I benefits the host as it does not lower resistance to common secondary bacterial infections (Fig. 1). In support of this hypothesis, IFN\u2010I exhaustion is most likely to be evolutionarily as it appears to be a consequence of all primary viral infections. We and others have shown this to be the case for adenoviruses, alphaviruses, orthomyxoviruses, murine cytomegalovirus and lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus 16, 21. From an evolutionary perspective, there must have been a strong selective advantage to transiently exhaust IFN\u2010I responses after primary viral infections to occur. Thus, it is reasonable to speculate the evolutionary advantage of negative feedback regulation to suppress virus\u2010induced immune responses that are detrimental against secondary bacterial infections.",

It would be interesting to find out whether the outcome of such co\u2010infection experiments would differ if mice undergoing a primary virus infection were challenged with bacterial pathogens at the time of IFN\u2010I exhaustion, 5\u20139 days post\u2010infection. Thus, to provide evidence for the above\u2010outlined hypothesis, all that would be required is to establish correlates of strength of IFN\u2010I response and exhaustion with severity of secondary bacterial challenges. A time course of bacterial infections after primary virus infection and/or poly I:C treatment would provide an answer to this question. Poly I:C, a synthetic analogue of double\u2010stranded RNA, mimics RNA viral infections, but would eliminate potential unrelated viral\u2010induced pathologies affecting secondary bacterial pathologies. It has been shown that poly I:C\u2010treated mice mount IFN\u2010I responses that render the host transiently more susceptible to bacterial infections 41, 46. Evaluation of the severity of bacterial growth, morbidity and mortality should establish whether IFN\u2010I exhaustion ameliorates secondary bacterial pathology.

As pDCs are the principal secretors of IFN\u2010I, the prevailing hypothesis for IFN\u2010I impairment is centred on pDCs 5, 21, 47. pDCs that have been induced to produce large amounts of IFN\u2010I in a primary antiviral response are either depleted, through mechanisms such as NK cell\u2010mediated cytotoxicity 48, 49, or are induced to mature and have to be replaced by haematopoesis, or they acquire a transient state of unresponsiveness and paralysis such as that reported in experiments using in vitro stimulation after in vivo viral infections 50. Although, in our mouse model using avirulent SFV, we did not observe quantitative reduction in pDCs 16, others have reported significant decrease in numbers of pDCs soon after acute or during persistent viral infections 21, 51. Consistent with the above animal data, human patients infected with hepatitis B virus (HBV), hepatitis C virus (HCV) or HIV have decreased numbers of circulating pDCs 52, 53, 54, 55. In addition, patients with HCV infection receiving IFN\u2010I\u03b1 therapy exhibit decreased numbers of pDCs in blood compared with untreated controls 56. Thus, a strong negative correlation exists between the quantity of the IFN\u2010I response and pDC numbers. Recent study by Swiecki et al.51 has shown that pDC depletion during systemic viral infection occurs in an IFN\u2010I\u2010dependent manner through upregulation of pro\u2010apoptotic expressions of Bid, Bim, Noxa and Bax and downregulation of anti\u2010apoptotic Bcl\u2010xl and Bcl\u20102.",

Interestingly, the functional defect of pDCs is limited to IFN\u2010I production because synthesis and secretion of other cytokines such as TNF\u2010\u03b1, IL\u201012 and MCP\u20101 are not impaired 21. Collectively, it is likely that the inability of the host to mount an IFN\u2010I response during the refractory period against a secondary challenge is due to both a pDC intrinsic defect in IFN\u2010I production and an overall reduction in pDC numbers, the consequence being a vastly reduced IFN\u2010I output, which may render the host less susceptible to secondary bacterial infections.",
