It can overcome the drawbacks of the\nsimplex network in which individuals interact only through one network, while in reality\n(same as in epidemic and information spreading), the same set of nodes might interact\nthrough multiple networks with different topologies and dynamical properties.21\u201325 Each layer could have\nparticular features that are different from the rest, which make the multiplex network\ndefine a richer structure of interactions.26 Under the framework of the multiplex network, there has been growing\ninterest in exploring the interplay between epidemic spreading with human response,27\u201333 since it is\nnatural for people to take measures when they become aware of epidemics. Two interdependent\nlayers can be used for modeling different dynamical processes, and the interactions between\nlayers represent the coevolution of the processes. Several works have studied the problem by\nchanging the model of information spreading, such as by considering the information\nspreading process as a SIS model; Granell et al.27 discovered the emergence of a metacritical point where the\ndiffusion of awareness is able to control the onset of epidemics, whereas Guo et\nal.28 replaced the SIS model by\na threshold model and found a two-stage effect on epidemic threshold. Besides, Granell\net al.29 also analyzed\nthe consequences of a massive broadcast of awareness (mass media) on the final outcome of\nthe epidemic incidence, and the results showed that mass media could make the metacritical\npoint disappear.",

In other words, all these\nmodels can be defined as connectivity model, where connections among individuals are\nlong-lived elements.34\u201337\nHowever, with the development of various kinds of social networks, in many cases, the\ninteractions among individuals are rapidly changing and are characterized by processes with\nduration being defined on a very short time scale, such as information diffusion over an\nemail, mobile calls among individuals, and so on.38 Since a time-aggregated representation of network's interactions\nneglects the time-varying nature of real systems,35 it is meaningful for us to model the information layer as a time\nvarying network and to study the effects that information spreading process has on epidemic\nspreading. This scenario is common in reality if we consider the spreading of epidemic\ninformation originating from social media, for example, the spreading of Severe Acute\nRespiratory Syndromes. During this period, people can know about this epidemic from many\nsources, such as television (TV), radios, and Internet. Let us take TV as an example: the\nannouncer can be regarded as an activated node and the connections between him and listeners\nare time-varying, which makes the proper topology of the connections be a time-varying\nnetwork. At the same time, in order to decrease the infection probability, everyone needs to\navoid contacts with strangers. And then, it is obvious that the contagion spreading layer\ncan be treated as a static one. Therefore, in this paper, to fill this gap, a multiplex\nnetwork with two layers is built. Specifically, the information spreading layer is a time\nvarying network generated by the activity driven model,34 and the other one is a static network. We extend the microscopic\nMarkov chain approach (MMCA)27 to derive\nthe epidemic threshold of the model analytically. Compared with extensive Monte Carlo (MC)\nsimulations, the method shows high accuracy for the prediction of the epidemic threshold.\nBesides, by considering different spreading models, namely, the SIS model and the threshold\nmodel, of the time varying network, we explored the interplay between epidemic spreading\nwith information spreading. The results show that the coexistence of antagonistic spreading\neffects raises interesting physical phenomena, such as not only makes the epidemic threshold\nbecome larger but also lowers the density of the final epidemic size. Corresponding to\ndifferent models, the metacritical point and two-stage effects also exist in the time\nvarying cases, which verify again that these phenomena are rooted in the competition\nprinciple of the multiplex network model. Furthermore, we also find that the temporal\nchanges in the topology hinder the spread of awareness which directly affect the epidemic\nthreshold, especially when the awareness layer is the threshold model.",

The\nawareness layer corresponds to the spread of information about epidemics, where individuals\ncan be aware or unaware. Besides, there is a certain probability for the two states\ntransforming between each other. More specifically, aware individuals have a probability of\n\u03b4 forgetting epidemics while unaware individuals can become aware with\nthe probability \u03bb through communication with aware individuals. As an\nimportant way to describe information diffusion process, the activity driven model is used\nto generate the connections among individuals on the awareness layer.34 Meanwhile, on the epidemic layer, there are two categories\nof individuals, i.e., S (susceptible) individuals and I (infected) individuals. Furthermore,\nthe contagion layer, where the epidemic spreading process described by the classic SIS model\noccurs, is a static one. Because of the existence of coupled dynamical processes, it\nproduces three kinds of states for each individual, including US (unaware and susceptible),\nAS (aware and susceptible), and AI (aware and infected), as illustrated in Fig. 1. Under the assumption of the SIS model for the spreading\nof epidemic, a susceptible individual can be infected by an infected neighbor with the\nprobability \u03b2, and at the same time, an infected individual can recover to\nbe susceptible with probability \u03bc. If an individual is infected, it is\nnatural that this individual becomes aware of the epidemic. However, if one susceptible\nindividual is aware of the epidemic, the infectivity \u03b2 can be reduced by a\nfactor, which results from individual's behavioral responses to the presence of the\nepidemic.27 We use\n\u03b2U and \u03b2A to represent the\ninfection rates without and with awareness, respectively. For the sake of simplicity, we\nwill present the results for \u03b2A=0\nin this paper, which correspond to complete immunity for aware individuals.",

As described above, the multiplex network consists\nof two layers with different topology structures. The awareness layer is a time-varying\nnetwork which is generated by the activity driven model, while the contagion layer is a\nstatic network. The activity driven model used for the spreading of information can be\ndepicted as follows:34 first, we consider\nN individuals and assign to each individual i an activity rate ai=\u03b7xi,\nwhich is defined as the probability per unit time to create new contacts with other\nindividuals. The activity potentials xi are assigned according\nto a probability distribution F(x) and are bounded in the\ninterval \u03be\u2264xi\u22641.\nThen, at each time step, with probability ai\u0394t,\neach individual i is activated and generates m connections with other\nrandomly selected individuals. After we build the network, information spreading process,\nwhich is the same as in the classic SIS model, will happen on it. At the next time step, we\ndelete all the edges and repeat the above steps. It is obvious that in the model,\nindividuals do not have memory of previous steps. Since many empirical researches show that\npower-law distribution of F(x) fits the real world\nnetworks,34 in the paper, we make\nF(x) take the form: F(x)\u221dx\u2212\u03b3.\nAs a result of the coupled dynamical processes, it is worth noting that each individual in\nthis multiplex network can only be in one of the three kinds of states: unaware and\nsusceptible (US), aware and infected (AI), and aware and susceptible (AS).

Since at time t individual i can only be in\none of the three states, we denote the probabilities of the three states as piAI(t), piAS(t), piUS(t), respectively. Furthermore, on the\nawareness layer, we define the probability for unaware individual i staying unaware as ri(t); on the contagion layer, we\nseparately define the probabilities for individual i not being infected by any neighbors as qiA(t), qiU(t) if i is aware and unaware.",

(2). When time t\u2192\u221e,\nthere exists an epidemic threshold \u03b2cU\nfor the coupled dynamical processes, which means the epidemic can outbreak only if \u03b2\u2265\u03b2cU.\nBy letting t\u2192\u221e,\nthe probabilities of three states piUS, piAS, piAI\nfulfill the condition that limt\u2192\u221epiUS(t+1)=piUS(t+1)=piUS, limt\u2192\u221epiAS(t+1)=piAS(t+1)=piAS, limt\u2192\u221epiAI(t+1)=piAI(t+1)=piAI. Since\naround the epidemic threshold \u03b2c, the infected probability piAI=\u03f5i\u226a1,\nthe probabilities qiA\nand qiU\ncan be simplified as qiA\u2248(1\u2212\u03b2A\u03a3jbji\u03f5j), qiU\u2248(1\u2212\u03b2U\u03a3jbji\u03f5j), respectively.\nTherefore, inserting these approximations into Eqs. (2) and omitting higher order items, Eqs. (2) is reduced to the following form: piUS=piUSri+piAS\u03b4,piAS=piUS(1\u2212ri)+piAS(1\u2212\u03b4),\u03bc\u03f5i=piUS((1\u2212ri)\u03b2A\u03a3jbji\u03f5j+ri\u03b2U\u03a3jbji\u03f5j)+piAS(\u03b4\u03b2U\u03a3jbji\u03f5j+(1\u2212\u03b4)\u03b2A\u03a3jbji\u03f5j).(3)Afterwards, by analysing the probability piAI(\u03f5i), we can get\n\u03bc\u03f5i=(piAS\u03b2A+piUS\u03b2U)\u03a3jbji\u03f5j.(4)It is clear that piAI+piAS+piUS=1,\nwhere piA=piAI+piAS.\nNoting that piAI=\u03f5i\u226a1,\nwe get piAI\u2248piA\nand piUS=1\u2212piAI\u2212piAS=1\u2212piA.\nHence \u03bc\u03f5i=\u03b2U(1\u2212piA)\u03a3jbji\u03f5j,(5)that is, to say, Eq. (6) can be reduced to \u03a3j[(1\u2212piA)bji\u2212\u03bc\u03b2Utji]\u03f5j=0,(6)where tji are the elements of\nthe identify matrix. Let H be a matrix whose element\nhij equals (1\u2212piA)bji. Then, it\nis obvious that the Eq. (6) has nontrivial\nsolutions if and only if \u03bc\u03b2U\nis the eigenvalue of matrix H. Consequently, the epidemic threshold\n\u03b2c is the one which satisfies \u03bc\u03b2U=\u039bmax,\nwhere \u039bmax is the largest eigenvalue of matrix H, and it is easy to\nget \u03b2cU=\u03bc\u039bmax.(7)",

When the value of\n\u03bc is large, while the value of \u03b4 is small, the value\nof aware probability \u03bb has an obvious effect on the epidemic threshold.\nThe reason is that at this condition, it is easy for the aware nodes to stay in the aware\nstate, while at the same time, the recovery ability of the nodes is strong. These two\neffects lead the epidemics to be difficult to outbreak. Hence, if we increase\n\u03bb, which means that the unaware nodes can become aware more easily, the\nepidemic threshold becomes larger. However, if \u03bc is small and\n\u03b4 is large, it is easy for the epidemics to outbreak. And then, even if\nwe increase \u03bb and nodes become aware with higher probability, the large\nvalue of \u03b4 makes nodes forget the epidemics in a short time, which will\ndecrease the spread speed of awareness. That is why in this case, \u03bb has a\nlittle effect on the epidemic threshold.

H(x) is a Heaviside step function, i.e., if\nx > 0, H(x) = 1, else H(x) = 0. Note that\nsince function qiA(t) and qiU(t) (Eq. (1)) represent the transformation between state\nS and state I, there is no need to change these two functions. Then after the same\nderivation, we can also get the numerical result of the epidemic threshold \u03b2c=\u03bc\u039bmax,(10)where \u039bmax is the same as before, i.e., the\nlargest eigenvalue of the matrix H defined following Eq.

The results show that the agreement between MMCA\nmethod and MC simulations is quite well. Besides, as illustrated in Ref. 28, the two stage effects, which means that there\nexists a sharp like transition for the epidemic threshold at \u03b1\u22480.5,\nalso exists in our model irrespective of the value of \u03b4 and\n\u03bc. Since in our model, the information spreading layer is a time\nvarying network, which is very different from the scale-free network or Erd\u0151s-R\u00e9nyi\nnetwork, the existence of the two stage effects verifies again that the phenomenon does\nnot rely on the structure of the network, but is a result of the coupled dynamical\nprocesses itself. In addition, there is another interesting phenomenon that in Figs. 3 and 6, the\nagreement between the MMCA approximation and the MC simulations seems to degrade as\n\u03bc increases and \u03b4 decreases. Actually, a large value\nof \u03bc and a small value of \u03b4 can lower the final epidemic\nsize and heighten the epidemic threshold. If we focus on the absolute discrepancy between\nthe MMCA method and MC simulations, it seems that the discrepancy is large on the\noccasion. However, from a macro point of view, for example, the error rate which equals \u03b2MC\u2212\u03b2MMCA\u03b2MC,\nwe find the MMCA method always has a good performance whatever \u03bc and\n\u03b4 is since the error rate locates in the range of 0%\u20135%.",

As for the\nactivity driven model, m is a critical parameter for the topology structure of the\nresulting time varying network. Accordingly in the following, we perform many simulations\non the two models by setting m to be 4, 7, 10, and 20. Furthermore, in order to study to\nwhat extent the coupled dynamical processes is affected by varying topology, a new index\nnamed fluctuation ratio is introduced, which is defined as follows: FR(t)=f(t)\u2212f(4)f(4),(11)where f(t) is the\nfinal epidemic size of the coupled dynamical processes when m is set to be t. It is clear\nthat for both models, with the increase in m, the epidemic threshold and final epidemic\nsize become smaller. The reason is that m represents the number of edges each active node\ncan connect, the larger the m is, the denser is the network. As a result, the spreading\nprocess on the dense network is quicker, which makes the nodes become aware easier. This\nwill then suppress the spreading of epidemics. Moreover, the results also show that the\nthreshold model is more susceptible to random changes in the topology of time varying\nnetwork, since the fluctuation of the final epidemic size, as well as the epidemic\nthreshold, is much larger in this case (Fig. 9).",

Regardless of whether\nthe information spreading process is defined as the SIS model or the threshold model, our\nnumerical results of epidemic threshold show high accuracy compared with extensive MC\nsimulations. Specifically, when the information spreading process is the SIS model, the\ncoupled dynamical processes make it difficult for epidemics to outbreak and can also lower\nthe density of the infected individuals.
