Differently, the reproductive number (R0) (the expected number of secondary cases produced by a single infected person in a susceptible population) is estimated between two and three, which is higher than SARS [6, 7] . Furthermore, the transmission of SARS occurs during the symptomatic period [8] . For COVID-19, numerous asymptomatic infections were found among close contacts of confirmed patients, like the report on \"Diamond Princess\" [9] . However, the epidemiological significance of asymptomatic infections is unclear until now. Recent studies indicated that transmission of COVID-19 could also occur from these individuals with no symptoms [10, 11] . However, for now, whether asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 carriers are contagious still remain controversial.",

Also, we analyzed epidemiological and clinical data from 455 contacts who had been exposed to the asymptomatic patient. Primarily, shortages of PPE were common in the early stages. Medical resources were supplied to healthcare workers priorly. Due to these factors, patients and attendants can only wear one mask for a long time, resulting in its ineffective. Besides, we noticed that some patients and relatives wore PPE incorrectly due to the lack of adequate training, which was also possible for hospital staffs.

However, a single sample is difficult to be representative. In the light of \"Zero infection\" for this case, we venture to guess that the viral load of respiratory tract samples in the asymptomatic patient might not be high.
