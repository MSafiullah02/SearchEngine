Synthetic viruses and genetic engineering of pathogens are a reality, with a rapid acceleration of dual-use science. The public availability of methods for dual-use genetic engineering, coupled with the insider threat, poses an unprecedented risk for biosecurity. Case studies including the 1984 Rajneesh salmonella bioterrorism attack and the controversy over engineered transmissible H5N1 influenza are analyzed. Simple probability analysis shows that the risks of dual-use research are likely to outweigh potential benefits, yet this type of analysis has not been done to date. Many bioterrorism agents may also occur naturally. Distinguishing natural from unnatural epidemics is far more difficult than other types of terrorism. Public health systems do not have mechanisms for routinely considering bioterrorism, and an organizational culture that is reluctant to consider it. A collaborative model for flagging aberrant outbreak patterns and referral from the health to security sectors is proposed. Vulnerabilities in current approaches to biosecurity need to be reviewed and strengthened collaboratively by all stakeholders. New systems, legislation, collaborative operational models, and ways of thinking are required to effectively address the threat to global biosecurity.",

Ebola is a category A bioterrorism agent, and the 2014 West African outbreak displayed highly unusual features. [1] [2] [3] For example, Ebola has never occurred in more than one country simultaneously previously, nor in capital cities. 4 Further, two unrelated Ebola epidemics occurred at the same time in West Africa and The Democratic Republic of Congo in 2014, while an outbreak of Marburg virus simultaneously broke out in Uganda. Locals speculated about the origin of the 2014 Ebola epidemic being bioterrorism, 5 ,6 yet this has been ignored in the public health response. Few nations have systematic mechanisms to assess re-emerging or emerging infections for potential bioterrorism, despite acceleration of science and accessibility of means for bioterrorism. An analysis of MERS-CoV shows that the pattern of disease fits with deliberate release, 7 yet this possibility has not been seriously entertained. The geographic spread of the recently emerged H7N9 avian influenza is puzzling. In contrast to H5N1, H7N9 does not correspond to either wild bird flyways or poultry trading routes. 8 The virus contains the same genetic mutations (which confers adaptation to humans), as engineered influenza viruses. 8 Yet this H7N9 has also been assumed to be natural.",

Eating at the salad bar was identified as the risk factor. Health authorities concluded this was a food-borne outbreak, and the cause, unsanitary food handlers. The salad bars were closed down, the outbreak subsided, and the matter would have ended there, but for a local politician, Jim Weaver, who accused a local religious cult of deliberately contaminating salad bars. 13 He went to the media with his claims, but health authorities refuted him, and he was branded paranoid and prejudiced against the religious cult. Six months later, the leader of the cult, Bhagwan Shree Rajneesh, confessed to the attack. Initially, his confession was not believed, but a year after the outbreak the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) found an exact genetic match of salmonella in the cult's laboratories.",

Rajneesh had purchased a ranch for 4,000 followers, and was in conflict with Wasco County over land use, and sought to take control of the County by making enough locals sick so that they would not be able to vote. The restaurant attack was a practice run, with the final plan to contaminate the town water supply before election day. Numerous cult members were involved, including 2 registered nurses. This case was not discussed publicly or written up in medical literature for another 12 years. 14 There are only two explanations for 10 restaurants being simultaneously affected by an identical strain of salmonellaeither a common contaminated ingredient in all affected restaurants, or deliberate contamination. Yet neither explanation was considered, despite Jim Weaver's warning. Even when Rajneesh confessed, he was not believed. This case study illustrates the inability of experts to interpret the data correctly, and the active resistance to considering bioterrorism as a cause. The normal human tendency is to force available facts to fit the dominant paradigm of thinking. Most food borne outbreaks are because of unsafe food handling, and this is the dominant paradigm for a field epidemiologist. Even experts may default to the dominant paradigm and override fact with belief. There is a need to train field epidemiologists to recognize unusual patterns and consider bioterrorism as a possibility. If the possibility is never entertained, it will never be detected. The Rajneesh case would have remained undetected if not for the unsolicited confession. The ridiculing of the 1 person who recognized bioterrorism and the silence around the case for more than a decade illustrate important lessons.",

In 2003, Professor Thomas Butler, a university scientist who had served in U.S. Naval Medical Research Unit, was convicted for illegal transportation of plague to Tanzania, and other charges. 17 The aggressive prosecution of an eminent scientist was met with disapproval from the scientific community. 18 Case studies of insiders show a range of personal motives 19,20 -greed, revenge, divided loyalty, blackmail, ego, work or family problems, or ideology. Insider threat has been traditionally viewed as stealing secrets to give to others, but where scientists are concerned, additional vested interests which could lead to personal gain such as patents on therapeutics, desire for fame, and potential for high impact research publications may all play a role in illegal research.

            "text": "Influenza can affect many species of mammals and birds. H5N1 is a highly pathogenic avian influenza virus which emerged in 1997 and affects birds. It has caused sporadic human cases, mostly in people with close contact with sick or dead birds. Over 386 people have been infected worldwide since 1997. 24,25 H5N1 is not easily transmissible between humans, but the potential of a random genetic mutation which could result in human transmissibility has driven global pandemic planning since 2005. There is an unknown, but real probability that a pandemic may arise from genetic mixing or a random mutation of avian H5N1. It was anticipated in 2005 that the next pandemic virus may be related to avian H5N1. 26 In 2011, two research groups completed research on engineering the H5N1 to make it transmissible in mammals. The rationale was to anticipate and understand the emergence of a H5N1 pandemic virus, and to enable vaccines and treatments. The risks include bioterrorism or a laboratory accident, either of which could spark an unnatural pandemic. These research groups sought to make their methods public in leading journals. 27 The scientific community remains deeply divided about DURC. 28 The opposing view was that the risk of a laboratory accident or bioterrorism sparking a pandemic was unacceptable, and that the benefits were minimal. 29 Influenza vaccines must be exactly matched to a virus to be protective, so creating an engineered virus ahead of a potential pandemic, should a pandemic with that exact virus eventuate naturally, is flawed, as the exact virus which causes a pandemic cannot be predicted. This unpredictability is illustrated the fact that the 2009 pandemic was not the anticipated H5N1, but an entirely different virus, H1N1, rendering all vaccines prepared for H5N1 useless. 29 In 2011, the NSABB initially unanimously recommended censorship of methods for H5N1 DURC, as it was deemed a biosecurity risk. 30 Yet in March 2012, following outspoken objections from scientists engaged in DURC, the NSABB reversed their position, and publication was allowed. [31] [32] [33] Questions have been raised about bias and conflicts of interest within the NSABB in this reversal, and have yet to be satisfactorily resolved. 34 Since then, DURC has accelerated, including engineered H7N9 and creation of a 1918 pandemiclike influenza virus. 35, 36 Inexplicably, the NSABB failed to meet again for more than 2 years, despite acceleration of DURC. 35, 37 The NSABB has further had its charter narrowed, with a reduced focus on DURC, and a reduction of funding. In the same time frame, major safety breaches occurred involving anthrax, avian influenza, and Ebola in the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) laboratories; and unsecured vials of smallpox were found at the National Institute of Health. [38] [39] [40] In July 2014, the NSABB dismissed all remaining members who had been part of the H5N1 controversy. The cumulative effect of these changes is to further erode protections for society against DURC. 41 If other stakeholders such as law enforcement, defense and intelligence agencies have had input into these decisions, they have not had influence. The public debate has narrowly focused on medical research, without acknowledgment of other sectors or input from wider perspectives. Further, there has been no attempt to quantify risks versus benefits of DURC.",

Although we have excellent surveillance systems in many countries, the question about natural or unnatural patterns of disease is not routinely asked in public health. When asked, it is rarely accepted and often vocally opposed. 47 If systems incorporate aberrant pattern analysis as a flag for potential bioterrorism, 7 this could then act as a referral point to security, law enforcement or defense sectors, who are far better equipped to investigate the possibility of deliberate release. In fact, the evidence required to prove bioterrorism cannot be acquired by health authorities. A laboratory isolation of a pathogen or an epidemiologic pattern cannot prove deliberate release-the best contribution that health authorities can make is early identification of aberrant patterns, and referral to law enforcement agencies. As illustrated by the Rajneesh salmonella case, the evidence for bioterrorism was finally obtained by a FBI raid on the Rajneesh laboratories and the finding of the identical outbreak strain in their cultures.

It also often assumes an ideological, political or religious motive, when the example of the insider threat shows that many other motives, including personal gain, may be at play. An important question to consider, particularly when reflecting on the insider threat and lessons from notable cases, is \"Who profits?\" Infectious disease is an industry, with many vested interest groups who could potentially profit from outbreaks. During an infectious diseases epidemic (such as Ebola), health agencies, pharmaceutical companies, researchers and other stakeholders, despite assumed good intentions, all stand to gain from the generation of business around the epidemic. It is na\u00efve to assume that all stakeholders in an infectious diseases emergency are driven universally by altruistic motives. For example, in the Ivins case, which remains unresolved, he shot to prominence as an expert initially assisting the FBI in their investigation of the 2001 anthrax letter bombs in the United States, and had patents on anthrax vaccines. Human nature is universal, and the factors involved in the insider threat as described for crime, apply equally to bioterrorism. 19, 20 It is timely to review simplistic assumptions about motives for bioterrorism, as well as the category A-B-C framework for bioterrorism preparedness, its relevance for current issues and threats, and to preparedness policy.",

The IHR is also underpinned by the assumption of predominantly natural threats, and does not identify bioterrorism as a major threat. It is also somewhat ironic that following the launch of the Global Health Security initiative that the U.S. CDC was embroiled in a series of serious safety breaches involving anthrax, avian influenza, and Ebola. [38] [39] [40] Legislative frameworks for public safety from bioterrorism may also need to be reviewed. It is sobering to reflect that in the Rajneesh case, the salmonella cultures were seized 12 months after the event, and that the Ivins investigation took almost 7 years. What if Rajneesh had been harboring smallpox, instead of Salmonella, in his laboratory? A pandemic or epidemic of a lethal infection would take days to weeks to spread around the world. It poses an unacceptably high risk to society if suspects are in possession of dangerous pathogens (such as Ebola, smallpox, or avian influenza) while investigations drag on for years. Given the reality of the insider threat and the demonstrated resistance of the scientific community to investigation of their own, 18 traditional law enforcement approaches may not be suitable for investigating scientists suspected of bioterrorism. The insider threat must be acknowledged as a serious one in the era of DURC, and the rights of scientists should not outweigh the rights of the public if there is a risk of harm. It may be necessary to consider legislation which allows urgent intervention and precedence of the rights of the community over individual rights for suspected bioterrorism.",

            "text": "Finally, it is clear that systems, thinking, training in public health, legislation, and policies are lagging far behind momentous changes in science in the context of game-changing advances in DURC. The insider threat, conflict of interest, and ethical considerations in dual-use research are poorly addressed, with the debate to date heavily weighing in favor of the rights of scientists. 46 These issues are not the exclusive domain of the health and medical research sectors-all sectors, including the community, health, science, law enforcement, and defense agencies need an equal seat at the table when making critical decisions about biosecurity. There is also a need for revision of human research ethics guidelines around dual-use research, as decisions made in 1 country may impact the rest of the world, and individuals who were not consulted nor consented to the research may be harmed by DURC. 46 Bioterrorism is difficult to recognize, particularly if caused by pathogens that may also occur naturally. Current paradigms of epidemic response do not routinely consider unnatural causes of outbreaks, and need to be reformed. The critical mass and skills required to respond to natural or unnatural epidemics cannot be replicated in nonhealth sectors, necessitating better collaboration between sectors. The ability to respond rapidly to bioterrorism threats once recognized, is further hampered by inadequate legislative frameworks. These problems combine to create major vulnerability in biosecurity within the current environment. Approaches to reducing risk include cross-sectoral training and capacity building in threat recognition, mechanisms for routine referral of aberrant epidemic patterns from public health agencies to law enforcement, better governance of DURC, awareness, and management of the insider threat, use of risk analysis calculations for regulating DURC, and improved legislation to allow rapid intervention for suspected bioterrorism. A quantum change in approach, collective, informed, transparent decision-making, and integrated cross-sectoral models of operation are required to improve global biopreparedness in a dangerous new era.",
