            "text": "proteases are regulated by serpins found in plasma and by non-serpin secreted inhibitors. Distinct mechanisms leading to neutrophil cell death have been described for the granule serine proteases, neutrophil elastase, cathepsin G, and proteinase-3. Granule leakage in neutrophils triggers death pathways mediated by cathepsin G and proteinase-3, and both proteases are tightly regulated by their inhibitor SERPINB1 in a cell intrinsic manner. Although stored in the same types of granules, neutrophil elastase does not significantly contribute to cell death following intracellular release from granules into the cytoplasm. However, heterozygous mutations in ELANE, the gene encoding elastase, are the cause of severe congenital neutropenia, a life-threatening condition characterized by the death of neutrophils at an early precursor stage in the bone marrow. This chapter focuses on recent work exploring the biology of clade B intracellular serpins that inhibit neutrophil serine proteases and their functions in neutrophil homeostasis and serine protease control at sites of inflammation.",

            "text": "Neutrophils are white blood cells with a prominent function in the control of microbes at mucosal surfaces and in tissues. The containment and elimination of bacteria and fungi can be severely affected if too few neutrophils are available or if there is a defect in their ability to reach the infection site. Neutrophils carry a vast repertoire of antimicrobial molecules and enzymes that directly contribute to killing pathogens. While neutrophils are essential to fight bacterial and fungal infections, the presence and death of neutrophils at inflammatory sites has been associated with delayed healing, tissue damage, and pathogenesis of chronic diseases. For these reasons, neutrophils and their potentially harmful granule cargo have been considered a double-edged sword in inflammatory diseases. Neutrophils are now emerging as a central orchestrator of inflammatory responses and their resolution through continuous interactions with components of the innate and adaptive responses (Nathan 2006; Kruger et al. 2015) . In this chapter, the function of the neutrophil granule serine proteases in neutrophil life cycle and their function in host defense and in inflammatory diseases will be reviewed with a special focus on their regulation by intracellular serpins. Neutrophils develop in the bone marrow from hematopoietic stem cells and differentiate progressively through progenitors with more restricted lineage potential known as the common myeloid progenitors and the granulocyte-macrophage progenitors (GMPs). The transcription factor PU.1 is essential for the generation of GMPs. At the GMP stage, the expression of the transcription factors, CCAAT/ enhancer-binding protein-\u03b1 (C/EBP\u03b1) and growth factor independent-1 (GFI-1), appears essential for commitment toward the neutrophil lineage, whereas PU.1 promotes monocyte differentiation (Cheng et al. 1996; Zhang et al. 1997; Dahl et al. 2003) . C/EBP-\u03b1 and GFI-1 promote proliferation of neutrophil precursors from myeloblasts, promyelocytes, and myelocytes, known as the mitotic pool of neutrophils in the bone marrow. These transcription factors are also key for the expression of neutrophil serine proteases and other primary granule proteins such as myeloperoxidase and defensins at the promyelocyte stage. As C/EPB-\u03b1 and GFI-1 levels diminish, terminal granulocytic differentiation to mature neutrophils is under the transcriptional regulation of C/EBP-\u03b5, which controls the expression of secondary and tertiary granule proteins. These stages are also known as the postmitotic pool of neutrophils. Mature neutrophils accumulate in the bone marrow as a large reserve pool that can be rapidly released to the circulation. During the last phase of differentiation, neutrophils start expressing receptors to transduce signals for mobilization to the blood and for effector functions. Once in the blood circulation, neutrophils have a relatively short life span of a few hours. They can sense tissue injury through cytokines, peptides, and lipid mediators secreted and/or presented by endothelial cells. Once firmly arrested on the vascular endothelium, neutrophils migrate into the tissue in a highly directional manner toward the injury site. Recruited neutrophils are highly efficient phagocytes and kill microbes using a broad range of antimicrobial peptides and enzymes. In the absence of inflammation, the neutrophil life cycle ends by efferocytosis, where neutrophils undergo apoptosis and are phagocytosed. Efferocytosis of neutrophils occurs in all tissues but, in steady-state conditions, it occurs principally in the spleen, the liver, and the bone marrow. This form of cell death is important for several reasons (Vandivier et al. 2006) . First, it dampens the production of inflammatory mediators through the production of TGF-\u03b2, for example. Second, and in contrast to necrotic neutrophils, apoptotic neutrophils do not release their highly reactive contents, thus preventing damage to neighboring cells and extracellular matrix proteins. Third, impaired removal of apoptotic cells is associated with autoimmune disease. Last but not least, phagocytosis of apoptotic neutrophils reduces the production of IL-23 by the macrophages. IL-23 induces the production of IL-17 by \u03b1\u03b2 and \u03b3\u03b4 T cells. IL-17, in turn, upregulates G-CSF production by stromal cells leading to increased granulopoiesis (Stark et al. 2005) . Therefore, the removal of apoptotic cells in the periphery sends a negative feedback loop that ultimately regulates neutrophil production in the bone marrow.",

Human neutrophils contain four NSPs with an active catalytic triad: neutrophil elastase (NE), proteinase-3 (PR3), cathepsin G (CG), and the recently characterized neutrophil serine protease-4 (NSP4). NE and PR3 are elastinolytic proteases, and CG has chymotrypsin-like activity, whereas NSP4 is a trypsin-like protease. Azurocidin is encoded by a phylogenetically related serine protease gene, but its catalytic domain is mutated rendering the protease inactive. NSPs evolved from a common ancestor and are phylogenetically related to other serine proteases found in innate immune cells including granzymes and mast cell proteases (Ahmad et al. 2014) . NSPs are conserved in mice, and in contrast to granzymes and mast cell proteases, there is a single mouse homolog for each of the human NSP genes.",

Together with NSPs, primary granules carry myeloperoxidase, lysozyme, and antimicrobial peptides such as \u03b1-defensins and cathelicidin. How each cargo protein ends up in the correct granule appears largely controlled by transcriptional timing (Cowland and Borregaard 1999; Theilgaard-M\u20ac onch et al. 2005 ). As described above, different transcription factors dominate at different phases of neutrophil differentiation and mRNA expression of NSPs is highest in promyelocytes, which is the time where primary granules are formed.",

            "text": "NSPs are synthesized as pre-pro-enzymes and require posttranslational cleavage at the N-terminus and C-terminus to gain their fully mature active form. First, the signal peptide is cleaved by a signal peptidase. The resulting pro-enzymes are then further processed by dipeptidyl peptidase I (DPPI), also known as cathepsin C, which cleaves the N-terminal dipeptide in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and Golgi apparatus before packaging into granules. Cleavage of the pro-dipeptide by DPPI is essential for the enzymatic activity of the NSPs. Neutrophils of dppi \u00c0/\u00c0 mice have no detectable NSP activity, and CG protein is not detectable in neutrophil lysates (Adkison et al. 2002) . The C-terminus of the pro-enzymes is also cleaved before packaging into granules, but the protease responsible for this process has not yet been identified. Mutants of NE and CG lacking the C-terminal peptide and expressed in RBL cell line are correctly routed to granules and are enzymatically active indicating that the C-terminal domain is not required for these functions (Gullberg et al. 1995) .",

Cleavage of the C-terminus of NE appears to promote the routing of NE to granules by two mechanisms: first, the C-terminus contains a putative transmembrane domain that leads to membrane anchoring and leads to targeting to the plasma membrane; second, the cleavage of the C-terminus leads to the uncovering of a binding domain for adaptor protein complex 3 (AP3), which may favor protein distribution to granules (Benson et al. 2003) . The proteoglycan serglycin contributes to the retention of proteases and inflammatory mediators in leukocytes and endothelial cells (Kolset and Tveit 2008) . In neutrophils of serglycin-deficient mice, only NE appeared to require serglycin for proper localization into granules, whereas sorting of CG and PR3 was not affected (Niemann et al. 2007 ). While early studies showed that PR3 localized principally in primary granules (Borregaard and Cowland 1997) , PR3 has also been reported in secretory vesicles and other types of granules, which may explain the more rapid mobilization of PR3 to the plasma membrane (Witko-Sarsat et al. 1999; Loison et al. 2014 ).",

It was thus named monocyte/neutrophil elastase inhibitor (MNEI) and leukocyte elastase inhibitor (LEI). SERPINB1 also inhibits CG and PR3 through the classical serpin complex inhibition mechanism. NE and PR3 target the RCL of SERPINB1 at Cys-344 at the classical P1 position, corresponding to Met-358 of AAT. In contrast, CG and other chymotrypsin-like proteases cleave the reactive center loop (RCL) of SERPINB1 at Phe-343 (Cooley et al. 2001) . SERPINB1 is expressed in most tissues with higher levels in lymphoid organs such as the bone marrow and the spleen as well as in the pancreas and the lungs. In hematopoietic cells, SERPINB1 is expressed in stem cells, all leukocyte lineages, and platelets. SERPINB1 levels are the highest in the neutrophil lineage, where highest mRNA expression is found in the early stages of granulopoiesis and protein levels remain high in bone marrow and blood neutrophils (Benarafa et al. 2002; Missen et al. 2006) .

            "text": "Neutrophil Death in Steady-State Conditions SERPINB1 has emerged as an important regulator of neutrophil survival. A cytoprotective function for intracellular serpins was postulated based on the presence of these inhibitors in cells carrying cell death-inducing granule proteases, such as granzymes (Bird 1999) . In the case of SERPINB1, expression profiling during granulopoiesis supported this hypothesis since mRNA and protein levels of SERPINB1 peaked in promyelocyte and myelocyte stages, which coincided with the high but transient transcription of NSPs and other primary granule proteins (Theilgaard-M\u20ac onch et al. 2005; Benarafa et al. 2011) . The evidence that SERPINB1 is cytoprotective for neutrophil has been elucidated in a series of studies of mice with a targeted deletion of serpinb1a (Benarafa et al. 2007) , the mouse ortholog of the human gene (Benarafa et al. 2002) . In these mice, neutrophil numbers in the bone marrow are approximately 50 % of the levels of wild-type mice. The phenotype is highly penetrant as it is observed in 129S6 and C57BL/6J backgrounds. Circulating blood neutrophil numbers in serpinb1a \u00c0/\u00c0 mice are only marginally lower than in wild-type mice in normal conditions, but a faster decline in circulating neutrophils is observed after myeloablation with cyclophosphamide (Benarafa et al. 2011) . In mice, reduction of neutrophil numbers in the bone marrow is physiologically relevant as it holds over 90 % of mature neutrophils. Indeed, laboratory strains of mice have on average 1 \u00c2 10 6 neutrophils/ml of blood with a total volume of 2 ml; and a mouse femur represents approximately 6 % of the total bone marrow and contains 4-6 \u00c2 10 6 neutrophils depending on the mouse strain. Neutropenia in serpinb1a \u00c0/\u00c0 mice is due to a cell intrinsic survival defect affecting differentiated neutrophils, while the development of mitotic neutrophil precursors is normal (Benarafa et al. 2011) . The mechanism of cell death in the absence of serpinb1a is dependent on CG in steady state in vivo. Indeed, neutropenia in serpinb1a \u00c0/\u00c0 mice was fully rescued by deficiency in CG (Ctsg \u00c0/\u00c0 ). In contrast, NE deficiency had no effect on neutrophil survival in serpinb1a \u00c0/\u00c0 mice (Baumann et al. 2013 ). Competitive stem cell transplantation of irradiated mice showed a survival advantage of wild-type neutrophils over serpinb1a \u00c0/\u00c0 neutrophils but not over Ctsg \u00c0/\u00c0 .serpinb1a \u00c0/\u00c0 double-deficient neutrophils. These mixed bone marrow chimera experiments demonstrated that neutrophil death was cell intrinsic in vivo and support intracellular leakage of granule proteins in mature neutrophils as a mechanism of cell death in the absence of SERPINB1. Importantly, mice lacking one or all three NSPs, as in dppi \u00c0/\u00c0 mice, do not present increased neutrophil numbers in bone marrow and blood. These findings indicate that in homeostatic conditions, neutrophil homeostasis is not critically regulated by NSPs unless the intracellular anti-protease shield is deficient.",

In contrast, the survival defect is fully rescued if neutrophils are concomitantly deficient in CG, indicating that in the absence of serpinb1, CG induce neutrophil death through both caspasedependent and caspase-independent pathways. While CG has been shown to activate caspase-7 (Zhou and Salvesen 1997) , the targets of CG leading to caspaseindependent cell death are not yet know. Interestingly, isolated neutrophils of mice deficient in PR3 (prtn3 \u00c0/\u00c0 ) show improved survival in vitro compared to WT neutrophils and PR3 is found in the cytoplasm of aging neutrophils in vitro. Inhibitory complexes between PR3 and serpinb1 are found in the cytoplasm of aging neutrophils, supporting the notion that granule leakage promotes cell death. In contrast to CG or NE, PR3 directly activates pro-caspase-3 leading to apoptosis (Loison et al. 2014) . Therefore, serpinb1 appears to act at the intersection of death pathways mediated by CG and PR3. It is conceivable that the two proteases function in a cascade because CG deletion alone rescues the cell intrinsic death pathway in serpinb1a \u00c0/\u00c0 mice in vitro and in steady-state conditions in vivo. This hypothesis could be tested in prtn3 \u00c0/\u00c0 . serpinb1a \u00c0/\u00c0 double knockout mice. Alternatively, CG and PR3 could induce neutrophil death through parallel pathways that would enhance each other by depletion of the serpin shield.",

Other infrequent causes of SCN include mutations in adenylate kinase 2 (AK2), the transcriptional repressor (GFI1), and the glucose-6-phosphatase G6PC3 genes (Klein 2011 ). X-linked neutropenia has also been described in a subset of patients with Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome (WAS) carrying activating mutations in the WAS gene (Albert et al. 2011 ). Finally, a significant proportion of SCN cases remain genetically undefined, and with the advances in sequencing technology, new genetic defects leading to SCN will certainly be discovered (Boztug and Klein 2011) .

How mutant elastase leads to neutropenia is not completely elucidated, but the current working paradigm is that the mutated NE protein induces apoptosis in developing neutrophils in the bone marrow via the initiation of the unfolded protein response (UPR) (K\u20ac ollner et al. 2006; Grenda et al. 2007) . NE mutants are predicted to have defective folding as the protein is synthesized in the ER. Misfolded proteins are detected by ER sensors, which trigger the UPR that can ultimately lead to apoptosis. As very large amounts of mutant misfolded NE are produced at the promyelocyte stage, the UPR triggers apoptosis resulting in the absence of differentiated neutrophils in the bone marrow and blood. Genotype-phenotype analysis studies suggest that the pattern of mutations in ELANE is different in patients that develop SCN or CyN (Makaryan et al. 2015) . However, some mutations can lead to both SCN and CyN suggesting that additional disease modifiers may affect the severity of the phenotype (Germeshausen et al. 2013) . Furthermore, about 25 % of mutations leading to SCN, but none to CyN, are associated with the development of myelodysplasia (MDS) and acute myeloid leukemia (AML). However, only a fraction of the patients with these mutations also develop MDS/AML, indicating again that other genetic, epigenetic, and environmental factors contribute to disease initiation and progression.",

In transfection studies, recombinant NE mutants showed variable activity on peptide substrates ranging from the absence of activity, reduction in activity, to a higher activity than wild-type NE. In addition, AAT inhibited all active mutants in vitro (Li and Horwitz 2001) . Because SCN patients have heterozygous mutations in ELANE, it was hypothesized that mutant NE might interfere with wild-type NE. The overall NE activity was tested in blood neutrophils of SCN patients with or without ELANE mutations. In single cell assays by flow cytometry, which are associated with technical caveats such as dye loading standardization, average NE activity was similar in neutrophils of SCN patients and those of normal subjects, but the variation between individuals was greater in the SCN patient group (Germeshausen et al. 2013 ). In the same study, NE activity in lysates of blood neutrophils of a small subset of SCN patients with mutated NE was significantly lower than the activity of neutrophil lysates of SCN patients without ELANE mutation and than that of normal donors. Therefore, ELANE mutations do not appear to be linked with consistently lower or higher NE activity. In addition, elane \u00c0/\u00c0 mice have normal granulopoiesis and neutrophil counts (Belaaouaj et al. 1998) , further indicating that reduced or absent NE activity is not required for neutrophil survival and differentiation. Measurements of CG and PR3 activity and levels of SERPINB1 and SERPINB6 in neutrophils of SCN patients with or without ELANE mutations have not been investigated and may provide additional mechanistic clues on pathways leading to neutropenia.",

Another knock-in mouse expressing the G193X mutation that leads to the truncation of the carboxy-terminal 27 amino acids of the mature NE protein was also generated but similarly showed normal granulopoiesis in steady-state conditions (Nanua et al. 2011) . However, neutrophil precursors of mice carrying the G193X mutation showed reduced proliferation and survival after tunicamycin and bortezomib treatment, which block N-linked glycosylation and proteasome activity, respectively. These effects were associated with endoplasmic reticulum stress and markers of unfolded protein responses suggesting that modulating the unfolded protein response may be of therapeutic benefit.

Most prominently, patients with AAT deficiency develop lung emphysema at a young age (Laurell and Eriksson 1963) . This finding is one of the pillars of protease-antiprotease paradigm of chronic lung disease, where NSPs destroy the lung elastin fibers and other matrix proteins leading to emphysema. Single nucleotide polymorphism that alters the protein sequence of ACT has also been associated with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (Lomas and Silverman 2001) , suggesting that CG may contribute to pathogenesis. SERPINB1 is also found in airway fluids during lung inflammatory disease (Cooley et al. 2011; Davies et al. 2010; Yasumatsu et al. 2006) . Indeed, SERPINB1 can be secreted by an alternative mechanism used by other leaderless cytoplasmic proteins such as IL-1 family members (Keller et al. 2008 ). However, the relative importance of this secreting pathway and the release of SERPINB1 in the extracellular milieu after cell death remain to be established. Because AAT and SERPINB1 are both fast inhibitors of all three NSPs, a role for SERPINB1 in preventing the development and the severity of pulmonary emphysema in aging mice and following cigarette smoke exposure was tested in serpinb1a \u00c0/\u00c0 mice. Serpinb1a was expressed in the lungs of control mice and expression was higher after cigarette smoke exposure. However, stereological analysis of the lungs and lung function tests revealed that serpinb1a \u00c0/\u00c0 mice did not develop early onset emphysema as they aged. In addition, they developed cigarette smoke-induced emphysema to a comparable extent as wild-type mice after 6-month exposure (Cremona et al. 2013 ). These findings suggest distinct functions for the intracellular and extracellular serpins in emphysema development.",

Following up on studies showing increased production of inflammatory cytokines in P. aeruginosa infection of serpinb1a \u00c0/\u00c0 mice (Benarafa et al. 2007 ), a role for SERPINB1 in influenza A virus infection was investigated. After challenge with a high-dose influenza A/Philadelphia/82 (H3N2), the survival of serpinb1a \u00c0/\u00c0 mice was significantly reduced. Sublethally infected animals suffered increased morbidity, delayed resolution of lung injury, and increased immune cell death (Gong et al. 2011) . Importantly, early virus-induced cytokine and chemokine burst and influx of PMNs and monocytes were also normal, and these responses were associated with normal viral clearance in serpinb1a \u00c0/\u00c0 mice compared to wild-type. Whereas initial cytokines and chemokines rapidly decreased in WT mice, TNF-\u03b1, IL-6, KC/CXCL1, G-CSF, IL-17A, and MCP-1/CCL2 remained elevated in serpinb1a \u00c0/\u00c0 mice. Monocyte-derived cells were the dominant immune cells in influenza-infected lungs, and those from serpinb1a \u00c0/\u00c0 mice produced more IL-6 and TNF-\u03b1 when tested ex vivo (Gong et al. 2011) . Because viral clearance was unimpaired, the study highlights the critical role of serpinB1 in mitigating tissue injury, restricting inflammatory cytokine production, and reducing morbidity.",

Neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs) are web of nuclear DNA, histones, and antimicrobial molecules released by neutrophils following stimulation by endogenous and pathogen-associated inflammatory mediators. The generation of NETs, or NETosis, was initially described as the ultimate effort by neutrophils to contain microbes and prevent their dissemination by executing this form of programmed cell death (Brinkmann et al. 2004; Fuchs et al. 2007 ). However, some agonists, such as Staphylococcus aureus, may not require neutrophil death for NET release (Pilsczek et al. 2010) ; and GM-CSF-primed neutrophils release NETs composed of mitochondrial DNA following stimulation with complement C5a (Yousefi et al. 2009 ). In vitro, serpinb1a \u00c0/\u00c0 neutrophils release more NETs than wild-type neutrophils in response to agonists that induce NETs via reactive oxygen species-dependent and species-independent routes (Farley et al. 2012) . These findings suggest that SERPINB1 regulates a conserved portion of the NET release pathway. SERPINB1 was also shown to regulate DNA release from activated neutrophils in vivo following Pseudomonas infection. Yet, despite producing more NETs, neutropenic serpinb1a \u00c0/\u00c0 mice fail to control Pseudomonas infection in the lung and cannot prevent systemic bacterial spreading (Benarafa et al. 2007; Farley et al. 2012 ). On the contrary, increased NET generation in these mice may contribute to increased inflammation and tissue injury as observed during influenza infection (Gong et al. 2011) .",
