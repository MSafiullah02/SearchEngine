            "text": "Coronaviruses (CoV) are enveloped, single-stranded, positive-sense RNA viruses relevant in animal and human health [1, 2]. Historically, CoV infection in humans has been associated with mild upper respiratory tract diseases [1]. However, the identification of the severe acute respiratory syndrome CoV (SARS-CoV) in 2003 [3] and the recently emerged (April 2012) Middle East respiratory syndrome CoV (MERS-CoV) [4], which has been associated with acute pneumonia, redefined historic perceptions and potentiated the relevance of CoVs as important human pathogens. In this sense, the development of CoV infectious clones provides a valuable molecular tool to study fundamental viral processes, to develop genetically defined vaccines, and to test antiviral drugs. However, the generation of CoV infectious clones has been hampered for a long time due to the huge size of the CoV genome (around 30 kb) and the toxicity of some CoV replicase gene sequences during its propagation in bacteria. Recently, these problems were overcome using nontraditional approaches based on the use of bacterial artificial chromosomes (BACs) [5], in vitro ligation of cDNA fragments [6], and vaccinia virus as a vector for the propagation of CoV full-length cDNAs [7, 8].",

            "text": "In this chapter we describe the protocol to assemble CoV full-length cDNAs in BACs using the MERS-CoV EMC12 strain [9] as an example. In this system, the full-length cDNA copy of the viral genome is assembled in the BAC plasmid pBeloBAC11 [10] (Fig. 1), a low-copy-number plasmid based on the Escherichia coli (E. coli) F-factor [11] that presents a strictly controlled replication leading to one or two plasmid copies per cell. This plasmid minimizes the instability problem of several CoV sequences when amplified in high-copy-number plasmids, allows the stable maintenance of large DNA fragments in bacteria [11], and its manipulation is similar to that of conventional plasmids. The cDNA of the CoV genome is assembled in the BAC under the control of the cytomegalovirus (CMV) immediate-early promoter and it is flanked at the 3\u02b9-end by a 25-bp synthetic poly(A) followed by the sequences of the hepatitis delta virus (HDV) ribozyme and the bovine growth hormone (BGH) termination and polyadenylation signals to produce synthetic RNAs bearing authentic 5\u02b9- and 3\u02b9-ends of the viral genome. This DNA-launched system couples expression of the viral RNA in the nucleus from the CMV promoter [12] with a second amplification step in the cytoplasm driven by the viral polymerase, allowing the recovery of infectious virus from the cDNA clone without the need for in vitro ligation and transcription steps. Although some splicing events could occur during the nuclear expression of the viral genome, the efficiency of this phenomenon is very low and does not affect the recovery of infectious virus [5].\n",

All these elements have to be precisely assembled to produce synthetic RNAs bearing authentic 5\u02b9- and 3\u02b9-ends of the viral genome. A detailed protocol for the generation of the MERS-CoV intermediate plasmid, pBAC-MERS-CoV 5\u02b9-3\u02b9, is described next (Fig. 2).Generate by chemical synthesis a DNA fragment containing the CMV promoter [12] precisely fused to the first 811 nt of the viral genome (from the first nucleotide to the restriction site BamHI), flanked at the 5\u02b9- and 3\u02b9-ends by restriction sites SfoI and BamHI, respectively. Alternatively, this DNA fragment could be generated by PCR using two overlapping PCR fragments as template (see\nNotes\n6 and 7). One of these fragments should contain the CMV promoter flanked at the 5\u02b9-end by the restriction site SfoI and at the 3\u02b9-end by the 20 first nucleotides of the genome as overlapping sequence. The second overlapping PCR fragment should expand from the first nucleotide to the restriction site BamHI.The generated DNA fragment is digested with SfoI and BamHI, and cloned into pBeloBAC11-StuI digested with the same restriction enzymes to generate the plasmid pBAC-MERS-CoV 5\u02b9.Generate a second DNA fragment, containing the last 4,272 nt of the viral genome (from the restriction site PacI at genomic position 25,836 to the end of the genome) precisely joined to a 25-nt poly(A) tail, the HDV ribozyme, and the BGH termination and polyadenylation sequences, flanked at the 5\u02b9-end by a multicloning site with the restriction sites selected before (BamHI, StuI, SwaI, and PacI) and at the 3\u02b9-end by the restriction site SfiI. This DNA fragment could be generated by chemical synthesis or by overlapping PCR as described before (see\nNotes\n6 and 7).Digest with BamHI and SfiI the second DNA fragment (containing the multicloning site, the viral 3\u02b9-end followed by the poly(A) tail, and the HDV-BGH sequences) and clone it into the plasmid pBAC-MERS-CoV 5\u02b9 digested with the same restriction enzymes to generate the intermediate plasmid pBAC-MERS-CoV 5\u02b9-3\u02b9 (Fig. 2).After each cloning step, the integrity of the cloned DNA fragments is verified by restriction analysis and sequencing.\n",

These efficiencies are easily obtained by the electroporation method, which is more reproducible and efficient than the chemical methods. Here we described the protocol for preparing electrocompetent DH10B cells from 1 l of bacterial culture. All the steps of this protocol should be carried out under sterile conditions.Inoculate a single colony of DH10B cells from a freshly streaked LB agar plate into a flask containing 10 ml of SOB medium and incubate the culture overnight at 37 \u00b0C with vigorous shaking (250 rpm).Dilute 1 ml of the overnight culture into 1 l of SOB medium pre-warmed at 37 \u00b0C and grow the cells with vigorous shaking (250 rpm) in a 2 l flask at 37 \u00b0C until the OD at 550 nm reaches 0.7 (this can take 4\u20135 h) (see\nNote\n14).Transfer the flask to an ice-water bath for about 20 min. Swirl the culture occasionally to ensure that cooling occurs evenly. From this point on, it is crucial that the temperature of the bacteria not rise above 4 \u00b0C.Divide the bacteria culture in two ice-cold 500 ml centrifuge bottles and harvest the cells by centrifugation at 6,000 \u00d7 g for 10 min at 4 \u00b0C.

Carefully pour off the supernatant and resuspend each cell pellet in 250 ml of ice-cold 10 % glycerol (see\nNote\n15).Repeat step 5 reducing the resuspension volume to 125 ml from each cell pellet.Harvest the cells by centrifugation at 6,000 \u00d7 g for 15 min at 4 \u00b0C.

Arcing is usually manifested by the generation of a popping sound in the cuvette during the electrical pulse. If arcing occurs, wash the cell suspension once more with 100 ml 10 % glycerol and repeat steps 7 and 8.Dispense 100 \u03bcl aliquots of the final cell suspension into sterile, ice-cold 1.5 ml microfuge tubes, freeze quickly in a dry ice\u2013methanol bath, and transfer to a \u201370 \u00b0C freezer.

Alternatively, these sequences together with the HDV ribozyme could be amplified from plasmid pBAC-TGEV 5\u02b9-3\u02b9 that is available from the authors upon request.In general, the cloning of CoV full-length cDNAs in BACs allows the stable propagation of the infectious clone in E. coli DH10B cells. If a residual toxicity, characterized by a small colony phenotype and a delay in the bacterial growth, is observed during the assembly of the infectious clone, we recommend inserting the DNA fragment responsible for this toxicity in the last cloning step to minimize the toxicity problem.Cultures of BAC transformed bacteria should be grown from a single colony isolated from a freshly streaked selective plate. Subculturing directly from glycerol stocks or plates that have been stored for a long time may lead to loss of the construct.LB broth is the recommended culture medium, since richer broths such as TB (Terrific Broth) lead to extremely high cell densities, which can overload the purification system, resulting in lower yield and less purity of the BAC DNA.When other kits are used instead of the Qiagen QIAprep Miniprep Kit, equivalent modifications have to be included to optimize the recovery of BAC DNA.To avoid DNA degradation and unwanted rearrangements owing to culture overaging, it is important to prevent growing the culture up to the late stationary growth phase.The use of a swinging bucket rotor is recommended for the last isopropanol precipitation step to facilitate the further resuspension of the BAC DNA. After washing with 70 % ethanol, air-dry the pellet for only 5 min. Never use vacuum, as overdrying the pellet will make the BAC DNA difficult to dissolve. Carefully remove any additional liquid drop, add 250 \u03bcl of 10 mM Tris\u2013HCl (pH 8.5) (DNA dissolves better under slightly alkaline conditions) and resuspend the DNA overnight at 4 \u00b0C. To prevent plasmid shearing, avoid vortexing or pipetting to promote resuspension of the BAC DNA. Transfer the DNA to a clean 1.5 ml microfuge tube, remove any possible resin traces by centrifugation for 1 min in a tabletop microfuge, and keep the supernatant in a clean tube at 4 \u00b0C. If the purified BAC DNA is not going to be used for a long period of time we recommend storage at \u201320 \u00b0C. Avoid repeated freeze-thaw cycles to prevent plasmid shearing.For efficient cell transformation, bacterial culture OD at 550 nm should not exceed 0.8. To ensure that the culture does not grow to a higher density, OD measurement every 20 min after 3 h of growth is highly recommended.Take care when decanting the supernatant as the bacterial pellets lose adherence in 10 % glycerol.The Qiagen QIAEX II resin can be used to efficiently purify DNA fragments from 40 bp to 50 kb from aqueous solutions and from standard or low-melt agarose gels in TAE or TBE buffers. Other commercial kits are available, but check whether they have been optimized for purification of DNA fragments larger than 10 kb, as most BAC constructs used during the assembly of the infectious clone are larger than 10 kb.The large size of the BAC vectors reduces the ligation efficiency. To increase this efficiency, it is essential to use larger amounts of vector, insert, and T4 DNA ligase than when using conventional plasmids.Most electroporation machines contain programs with defined parameters for transforming specific cell types. In this case, choose the program containing the conditions closest to those described in this protocol.The presence of salt increases the conductivity of the solution and could cause arcing during the electrical pulse, drastically reducing the transformation efficiency. If arcing occurs, use a smaller amount of the ligation reaction in the electroporation or remove salt from the DNA using any commercial kit or by extraction with phenol\u2013chloroform followed by precipitation with ethanol and 2 M ammonium acetate.Plating volumes higher than 200 \u03bcl of electroporated cells on a single plate may inhibit the growth of transformants owing to the large number of dead cells resulting from electroporation. If only small numbers of transformant colonies are expected, it is recommended to spread 200 \u03bcl-aliquots of the electroporated cells on different plates.A mix of small and large colonies indicates that the cloned DNA fragment presents some toxicity when amplified in E. coli. Choose the small colonies, which may contain the correct insert, and always grow the bacteria containing this recombinant BAC plasmid at 30 \u00b0C to minimize the toxicity problem. In this case, we strongly recommend inserting this toxic DNA fragment into the infectious clone in the last cloning step, in order to reduce the manipulation and minimize the possibility of introducing unwanted mutations. Infectious BAC cDNA clones presenting a residual toxicity should be grown at 30 \u00b0C.It is important to avoid overloading the reaction by adding too much bacteria, which may alter the ionic balance of the reaction and inhibit the amplification by the Taq polymerase.We recommend to use this storage method for BAC clones that present a residual toxicity and are not fully stable when amplified in E. coli.The Red recombination system combined with counterselection with I-SceI endonuclease results in an accurate and highly efficient method to introduce insertions, deletions, or point mutations in BAC clones without retention of unwanted foreign sequences.The transfection of BACs containing large inserts into mammalian cells has been optimized in our laboratory and the best transfection efficiencies were provided using Lipofectamine 2000 as transfection reagent.All work involving MERS-CoV has to be performed in a Biosafety Level 3 (BSL3) laboratory, following the guidelines of the European Commission and the National Institutes of Health (NIH) of the USA.Do not add antibiotics to media during transfection as this may decrease transfection activity. A healthy cell culture is critical for an efficient transfection. The use of low passage-number cells is recommended.Use a BAC DNA isolated with the Qiagen Large-Construct Kit since a DNA preparation of high purity is required in the transfection step.Opti-MEM I Reduced Serum Medium is recommended for dilution of the cationic lipid Lipofectamine 2000 reagent prior to complexing with DNA, although other media without serum may also be used. However, owing that some serum-free media formulations can inhibit cationic lipid-mediated transfection, test any new serum-free medium for compatibility with the transfection reagent prior to use. Some media formulations that have been found to inhibit cationic lipid-mediated transfection are CD 293 Medium, 293 SFM II, and VP-SFM.If susceptible cells are directly transfected, incubate them at 37 \u00b0C until the cytopathic effect is observed and proceed to clone and characterize the recovered virus. In this case, optimization of the transfection of the desired cells with the BAC clone using Lipofectamine 2000 should be required. For transfection optimization, use a similar size plasmid expressing GFP. This plasmid is available from the authors upon request.\n",
