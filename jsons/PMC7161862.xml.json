For a small globular protein, all the information on how to gain functional 3D structure is encoded in its amino acid sequence.1, 2 This hypothesis represents a foundation of the \u201cone sequence\u2010one structure\u2010one function\u201d model, which is the cornerstone of modern structural biology.1, 2, 3 This structural rigidity of ordered proteins determined their ability to form crystals, which allowed the X\u2010ray\u2010based determination of 3D\u2010structure of many proteins down to the atomic resolution.4 The protein misfolding phenomenon, when due to the effect of environmental factors or because of the genetic defects (mutations), a polypeptide chain has lost its capability to gain a proper functional 3D structure (i.e., became misfolded), and which has multiple detrimental consequences (such as lost of function, gain of toxic function, aggregation, disbalance in proteostasis, potential cell death, etc.) that constitute molecular basis of various conformational diseases, seems to support this concept.5, 6, 7 However, the recent revelation of countless examples of intrinsically disordered proteins (IDPs) and hybrid protein containing ordered domains and IDP regions (IDPRs) has cast doubt on the general validity of the structure\u2010function paradigm and revealed an intriguing route of functional disorder.8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26\n",

For example, an abnormally highly charged polypeptide with low overall hydrophobicity will not fold, giving rise to an extended IDP (also known as natively unfolded protein), whereas a polypeptide chain with a balanced distribution of polar and hydrophobic residues will choose the folding path at the identical conditions.

Alternatively, the presence of chaperones may reverse the misfolding route and effectively dissolve small aggregates.29 Another important point is that the pathological misfolding of extended IDPs to some extent resembles the process of normal protein folding and assembly, that is, it represents a way from a simple, flexible, and disordered conformation (mostly structure\u2010less polypeptide chain) via somehow more ordered partially folded intermediate(s), to a complex and rigid structure, for example, amyloid fibril. However, the pathological misfolding of a rigid globular protein involves a step of transient disordering and formation of a partially unfolded intermediate, which is followed by the subsequent increase in the order originated from the formation of specific protein aggregates.",

Such under\u2010folded proteins do not have unique well\u2010defined 3D structures existing instead as collapsed or extended dynamically mobile conformational ensembles. In classical structure\u2010to\u2010function paradigm, under\u2010folded entities without unique structure were mostly of academic interest, since they would be typically found at the end of denaturation processes under the highly nonphysiological conditions or as transiently populated folding intermediates. However, in a new view of correlations between protein structure, function, and dysfunction, one can find important implementations of under\u2010folded states for each of the major protein forms, functional and folded, nonfunctional and misfolded, and functional and intrinsically disordered. Here, under\u2010folded protein states serve as important folding intermediates of ordered proteins, or as functional states of IDPs and IDPRs, or as pathology triggers of some misfolded proteins. Based on their origin, conformational ensembles of under\u2010folded proteins can be classified as transient (folding and misfolding intermediates) and permanent (IDPs and stable misfolded proteins; see Figure 2). Permanently under\u2010folded proteins can further be split into intentionally designed (IDPs and IDPRs) and unintentionally designed (misfolded proteins). These different categories of under\u2010foldedness are differently encoded in protein amino acid sequences and play different roles in protein life.

In other words, during these processes, the one\u2010dimensional information encoded in the DNA nucleotide sequence is sequentially transformed into the one\u2010dimensional information of the protein amino acid sequence, which codes for the peculiarities of protein folding, that is, a specific way of gaining unique three\u2010dimensional structure.

However, the unfolded state of a polypeptide chain is entropically favorable, representing a dynamic ensemble of a large number of conformations originating from the main chain rotational isomerization around F and Y angles. Therefore, the possibility of a given polypeptide chain to fold into a compact state is determined by its ability to form numerous intramolecular contacts of different physical nature, to compensate the free energy increase due to the decrease in the entropy component.30\n",

The first stage results in the formation of the fluctuating secondary structure elements. These elements then collapse to form a compact but highly dynamic intermediate with the native\u2010like secondary structure, where the backbone movements are mostly restricted but the mobility of the side chains is still high. At the final stage, the unique 3D\u2010structure is formed by restricting the side chain mobility.38 Therefore, partially folded species with increasing degree of structural complexity were proposed to serve as universal folding intermediates. In a due time, one of these folding intermediate later named the \u2018molten globule (MG) state\u201939 was found in a test tube.40 Other partially folded intermediates [e.g., premolten globule (pre\u2010MG) and highly ordered MG] were later found.19\n",

Since the free energy of unfolded polypeptide chain represents a large \u201chilly plateau\u201d describing the dynamic ensemble of a large number of conformations, and since the number of conformational states accessible by a polypeptide chain is reduced while approaching the native state, the resulting energetic surface is known as the \u201cenergy funnel\u201d model. The conformational ensemble of unfolded conformations is separated from the entrance to the folding funnel by high energetic barrier(s) corresponding to the transitional state(s).30 This barrier is of great importance for the proper protein functioning, as its existence guarantees the structural identity of all the native protein molecules. The ability of native globular proteins to form crystals is the major proof of this hypothesis.27\n",

In this view, the role of under\u2010folded protein species is in helping proteins to fold. As a result, the experimental and theoretical studies on protein folding were traditionally centered on the search for and structural characterization of partially folded intermediates as a route to defining pathways of protein folding.43 There is considerable support for the idea that equilibrium partially folded conformations of a protein molecule can be good models for transient kinetic intermediates in protein folding.19, 44, 45, 46, 47, 48, 49, 50, 51, 52, 53, 54, 55, 56, 57, 58, 59, 60, 61, 62, 63 Therefore discovery and structural characterization of such equilibrium conformational ensembles is believed to considerably facilitate the description of the structural properties of short\u2010lived kinetic (transient) intermediates. The fact that the partially folded forms at moderate guanidinium hydrochloride (GdmHCl) or urea concentrations usually can be obtained only in mixture with native and/or unfolded forms, whereas the acid forms of globular proteins can be studied in pure state, makes partially folded conformations induced by extremely low (or extremely high) pH values very attractive targets for such structural studies.40\n",

One should keep in mind, however, that in this context the term \u201cintermediate state\u201d has a very loose meaning since none of these partially folded forms represents a specific state with unique structure, but each of these forms should be considered as a dynamic conformational ensemble. Therefore, the majority of experimental techniques used for the structural characterization of these ensembles provide observables that are by definition statistical averages over the ensemble of conformations accessible to a protein.

Therefore, in ordered, well\u2010folded proteins, amyloidogeneity\u2010promoting changes cannot happen spontaneously due to the strong prevalence of a stable and unique tertiary structure. Thus, destabilization of an ordered protein favoring partial unfolding and formation of conformational ensembles of partially unfolded molecules is required. Therefore, the first critical step in the fibrillogenesis of an ordered protein is its partial unfolding or destabilization leading to the formation of an amyloidogenic conformational ensemble. Presumably, such a partially unfolded conformational ensemble favors reciprocal and specific intermolecular interactions, including electrostatic attraction, hydrogen bonding, and hydrophobic contacts, which are necessary for oligomerization and fibrillation.6, 7, 34, 195, 196, 197, 198, 199, 202, 203, 204 In line with this hypothesis, most mutations associated with accelerated fibrillation and protein deposition diseases were shown to destabilize the native structure, increasing the steady\u2010state concentration of partially folded conformers.24, 195, 196, 197, 198, 199, 205, 206, 207, 208, 209, 210, 211 However, the aggregation propensity of a protein can be significantly reduced by the stabilization of the ordered structure, for example, via specific binding of ligands.212, 213, 214\n",

            "text": "Obviously, the process of amyloid fibril formation does not represent the only misfolding route. In fact, contrarily to the process of the productive protein folding resulting in the formation of a unique conformation with the specific function, the end products of misfolding may have very different appearances. The morphology of these end products depends on the particular experimental conditions, and misfolded product may appear as soluble oligomers, amorphous aggregates, or amyloid\u2010like fibrils. Any of these three species could be cytotoxic, thus giving rise to the development of pathological conditions. The reason for such a morphological difference is potentially connected to the diversity of the conformational ensembles of partially folded forms favoring protein self\u2010association. In fact, multiple environmental factors, such as point mutations, the decrease in pH, the increase in temperature, the presence of small organic molecules or metal ions, and other charged molecules, might induce structural rearrangements within a protein molecule, shifting equilibrium toward the partially folded conformation(s). As different factors may stabilize slightly different conformational ensembles, the formation of morphologically different aggregates is expected. This idea is illustrated by Figure 5, which represents an idealized model of amyloid fibril formation and clearly shows that fibrillation is a directed process with a series of consecutive steps, including the formation of several different oligomers.246 In this model, various oligomers are comprised of structurally identical monomers and the formation of these oligomers constitutes productive steps of the fibrillation pathway. However, aggregation is known to induce dramatic structural changes in the aggregating protein. Therefore, monomers at different aggregation stages are not identical. In addition, recent studies clearly showed that a given protein could self\u2010assemble into various aggregated forms, depending on the peculiarities of its environment. In fact, the typical aggregation process only rarely results in the appearance of a homogeneous product where at the end of reaction only one aggregates species (amyloid fibrils, amorphous aggregates, or soluble oligomers) is present. More often, heterogeneous mixtures of various aggregated forms are observed.246 Furthermore, each aggregated form can have multiple morphologies and monomers comprising morphologically different aggregated forms can be structurally different. All this suggests that aggregation is not a simple reaction, but a very complex process with multiple related and unrelated pathways, which can be connected or disjoined. However, regardless of the model or pathway considered, the appearance of a large aggregate inevitably involves the formation of some small oligomeric species.246\n",

In turn, the stability of globular conformation also depends on the peculiarities of interactions between protein globule and solvent. Obviously, many factors may affect the efficiency of coil\u2010globule transition (i.e., the efficiency and direction of the process of protein folding), as well as change the efficiency of the shield (interface between the polymer and solvent) and, thus, may modulate stability of a native protein molecule. Basically, point amino acid substitutions, changes in pH, temperature, and numerous other environmental circumstances, may considerably affect the mode of polymer\u2010solvent interactions. Thus, protein misfolding (aggregation) may originate from the changes in relative quality of solvent, which appear either due to the specific changes in protein amino acid composition or because of the solvent composition modifications.",

These ensembles, which are either transiently populated (as in protein folding) or represent stable entities (as in IDPs), define peculiarities of protein folding, represent functional states of IDPs/IDPRs, and mark pathogenic traps originating from protein misfolding and leading to the pathogenesis of the realm of human diseases. Predisposition of a given protein for folding, nonfolding, and misfolding is determined by the peculiarities of its amino acid sequence and by the specific features of protein's environment. Furthermore, although the choice between nonfolding, folding, and misfolding is encoded in a given amino acid sequence, transitions between various types of conformational ensembles are also possible and are controlled by multiple factors, starting from the peculiarities of protein amino acid sequence and ending with specific features of protein environment. For example, IDPs may be forced to fold or misfold via the posttranslational modifications, addition of natural binding partners, or modification of their environment (e.g., changes in properties of solvent, etc.). A destabilizing environment may push an ordered protein to the misfolding route or can awake its dormant disorder for function, whereas the presence of chaperones may reverse the misfolding route and effectively dissolve small aggregates.29\n",
