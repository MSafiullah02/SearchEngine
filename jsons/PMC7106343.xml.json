            "text": "Seasonal circulation of influenza virus is responsible for significant morbidity and mortality, despite preventative programs and practices. In addition, the emergence of novel respiratory viruses such as the Middle East Respiratory Syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) [1] highlights the importance of identifying means to control potentially infectious bioaerosols to reduce risks to healthcare personnel and dissemination within healthcare facilities. Limiting spread of viral pathogens is dependent upon our understanding of key determinants for transmission. A substantial body of experimental data has been generated [2], [3], including the identification of avian influenza A H5N1 viral determinants for mammalian transmission [4], [5]. However, a paucity of clinical studies address outstanding questions on the risk of exposure of healthcare workers to pathogens via the respiratory route. Investigators at the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) have recovered influenza virus and respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) RNA from small (<4 \u03bcm) particles in acute care outpatient environments [6], [7]. Bischoff et al. sampled air emitted from individuals with laboratory-confirmed influenza in the hospital setting, demonstrating the presence of viral RNA in droplet nuclei recovered over 1 m from the patient [8]. These studies underscore the potential insights that may be gained from more extensive studies.",

The instrument was placed 0.5\u20131.0 m from the patient, and air was sampled into phosphate buffered saline with Tween at a flow rate of 250 L/min for four minutes.
