Phylogenetic analysis establishes the evolutionary history and relationship between genes by inferring the common history of the genes. To achieve this, homologous regions (e.g., the coding region of the hemagglutinin (HA) gene), are compared in a multiple sequence alignment. Influenza A viruses have a small segmented genome most of which is protein coding (4). This makes multiple sequence alignment easy when compared to other more diverse and sparsely sampled viruses such as coronaviruses. However, influenza A viruses undergo frequent genetic mixing, termed reassortment, and caution must be used during analyses and interpretation of the whole genomes. Inappropriate analysis and/or dataset design can lead to inaccurate results and erroneous interpretations of the molecular epidemiology of influenza A viruses.",

This provides a framework to understand the diversity of any newly generated sequence data in relation to previous work.While it is always good to start from the largest possible dataset (i.e., all available sequences in public databases), this is usually not feasible due to computational limitations, or in some cases it may not be necessary. In general the criteria below can be used during taxon sampling.\nBLAST search results: Initial dataset size can be reduced using tools such as a BLAST search. BLAST identifies sequences from a database (usually GenBank) that have the highest percentage similarity to the query sequence. It is important to note that the results of a BLAST search may not represent the closest related sequences in terms of phylogenetic relationships. Only a phylogenetic analysis will provide information on the relatedness of gene sequences. Furthermore, the results of a BLAST search are listed by highest similarity and earliest released sequence\u2014if there are 10 BLAST hits with identical percentage similarity, these results will be listed from oldest to newest. Merely choosing the top BLAST hits is therefore not a suitable method for designing a dataset.\nGene segment: When analyzing surface protein genes (HA or neuraminidase, NA) it is essential that you include only the subtype that is under study, or generate individual datasets for each subtype under study. However, in the case of internal gene segments (PB2, PB1, PA, NP, M, and NS), all subtypes of influenza A virus sequences can be aligned together. This is particularly important if one wishes to detect reassortment of gene segments between viruses of different subtypes.\n",

Other areas that may be misaligned include the connecting peptide of the HA, and the NA stalk that may have a deletion. However, it is important that the entire alignment be visually inspected and any misalignments corrected.For nucleotide sequences of protein-coding genes there are three visualization modes: nucleotides: edit an alignment of single bases; codons: edit an alignment of codons in any reading frame; and translation: edit an alignment of inferred amino acids translated using various genetic codes (influenza A virus genes utilize the universal genetic code) (see Note 5).Alignments can be edited by selecting a block of sequences and sliding the block relative to the other sequences wherein gaps will open up behind the block. In addition, sequences and their labels can be edited in a separate window by double-clicking on the virus name.In order to ease visualization of the aligned file use block colors (select \u201cAlignment  >  Use Block colors\u201d).

Common substitution models are implemented in GARLI to calculate the likelihood scores. The model parameters can be fixed or estimated and used to optimize branch lengths, tree topology, and maximize the likelihood. The genetic algorithm used by GARLI to perform maximum likelihood searches is generally faster than PAUP* and, when searches have been run for sufficient length, the likelihood scores should be comparable. GARLI maximum likelihood tree search optimization is faster than PAUP* maximum likelihood analysis but slower than the neighbor joining method described above.\nFor downloading, installation, and basic usage instructions please see the GARLI Web site (see Note 11).The best-fit evolutionary model can also be specified as a \u201cGARLI block\u201d in the NEXUS file; however, the format is different for the PAUP* block described above. For the model from Subheading 3.3 the GARLI block will read (see Note 12) as follows:\n\n3.So replace the PAUP* block in the NEXUS file and rename the file to \u201cH5_align_garli.nex.\u201d4.It is then necessary to modify the GARLI configuration file (garli.conf) to specify the analysis file. The configuration file is in the folder \u201cexample\u201d that is included with the program download. This file can be opened in any text editor.5.On lines 2 and 6 of \u201cgarli.conf\u201d change the field \u201cdatafname  =  rana.nex\u201d to \u201cdatafname  =  H5_align_garli.nex\u201d and \u201cofprefix  =  rana.nuc.GTRIG\u201d to \u201cofprefix  =  H5.nuc.GTRIG.\u201d This specifies the correct analysis file.6.It is also necessary to modify Lines 25\u201331 of the configuration file, specify that the parameters of the evolutionary model have been fixed using the GARLI block:\n\n7.It is advisable to conduct multiple runs of GARLI to ensure that an optimal result is obtained. The default is 2 replicates but this can be increased by modifying \u201csearchreps  =  2\u201d in the configuration file.8.Ensure that the \u201cgarli.conf\u201d file is in the same folder as the GARLI executable.9.Open the Terminal window and cd to the folder containing the executable file \u201cGarli0.96b8.\u201d10.Type \u201c./Garli0.96b8\u201d and the program will begin to run.11.Once completed, the example dataset took about 15 min, the best tree will be saved in the file \u201cH5.nuc.GTRIG.best.tre\u201d in the same folder. In the terminal window, the likelihood of both runs is provided, which should be similar values.12.To conduct an ML bootstrap then simply modify the third last line of the \u201cgarli.conf\u201d file to read \u201cbootstrapreps  =  0\u201d to \u201cbootstrapreps  =  500\u201d or \u201cbootstrapreps  =  1,000\u201d (see Note 13).\n",

            "text": "MrBayes is a program for the Bayesian estimation of phylogeny. Bayesian phylogenetics has been gaining prominence and acceptance in evolutionary science, especially with dramatically improved computational power. Importantly, Bayesian phylogenetics sample many equivalent trees in the tree space in contrast to neighbor joining and maximum likelihood methods, which will produce only a single tree. The phylogenetic tree produced is based on all of these trees, which is known as the posterior probability distribution of trees. This computation is analytically difficult and for large datasets impossible. MrBayes uses a simulation method known as Metropolis-coupled Markov Chain Monte Carlo (or MCMC) to overcome this difficulty.\nFor downloading, installation, and basic usage instructions please see the MrBayes Web site (see Note 14).The best-fit evolutionary model is specified with a \u201cMrBayes block\u201d in the NEXUS file; however, the format is different for the PAUP* and GARLI blocks described above. For the model from Subheading 3.3 the MrBayes block will read (see Note 15) as follows:\n\n3.Replace the PAUP* block in the NEXUS file and rename the file to \u201cH5_align_bayes.nex.\u201d4.Double-click the MrBayes executable file to open the program. At the prompt type \u201cexec H5_align_bayes.nex\u201d to execute the file (see Fig. 7).\n5.The MrBayes block specified one million generations, with trees sampled every 100 generations. Also, the default setting for MrBayes is to conduct two independent runs. This will result in 10,000 trees per run, or a total of 20,000 trees.6.MrBayes will save two types of files for each independent run, the tree files and the run statistics, that have the extensions \u201crun1.t and run2.t\u201d and \u201crun1.p and run2.p,\u201d respectively.7.The Bayesian posterior probability is assessed from these trees after suboptimal trees calculated at the start of the run are discarded. The portion of the trees that are discarded are referred to as the \u201cburnin.\u201d8.Once the analysis has finished running, you will be prompted on whether to continue the analysis or not. First, it is necessary to check whether the two independent runs have converged by looking at the \u201caverage standard deviation of split frequencies\u201d that is provided in the MrBayes window. As the two runs converge onto the stationary distribution, the average standard deviation of split frequencies is expected to approach zero, reflecting the fact that the two tree samples become increasingly similar. A value <0.01 is considered adequate indication that the two runs have converged.9.Alternatively, the program Tracer can be used. Double-click the Tracer icon to open the program. This has the advantage that the burnin can also be determined though visual inspection.10.Click on the \u201c+\u201d sign near the top left of Tracer, this will open another window to select the necessary files. Navigate to the MyBayes folder and select the run statistic files \u201cH5_align_bayes.nex.run1.p\u201d and \u201cH5_align_bayes.nex.run2.p\u201d (see Fig. 8).\n11.Tracer will automatically assign a burnin of 10%. Double-click the burnin value in the \u201cTraces files\u201d box and change this to zero for both files. Select both files in the \u201cTraces files\u201d box and then click on the LnL statistic in the \u201cTraces\u201d box\u2014a graph of both tree likelihoods will appear to the right (see Fig. 8).12.For the example dataset used here, an appropriate burnin is 1,000 (10%) of sampled trees.13.If the two runs have not converged, you can continue the analysis by typing \u201cYes\u201d and then entering an additional 1 million generations.14.If the two runs have converged, then type \u201cNo\u201d and then type \u201csumt burnin=1,000\u201d\u2014or whatever burnin you have determined from visual inspection in Tracer. This will take some time and once completed, a consensus tree with Bayesian posterior probabilities will be saved as \u201cH5_align_bayes.nex.con\u201d (see Note 16) (Fig. 9).\n\n",

There are also many online alignment tools, including those provided at http://align.genome.jp/.Many multiple alignment programs also produce a guide tree that is used to conduct the multiple sequence alignment. This tree is unlikely to be accurate and must not be used to infer phylogenetic relationships or reproduced in publication.The instructions we give here are for the locally installed program; however, the program can also be run from the Web page.To ease the optimization of the multiple sequence alignment, shift all the sequences to the correct reading frame and translate the sequences to amino acids (select \u201cAlignment  >  Alignment type  >  Amino Acids\u201d).If you have loaded a DNA sequence alignment but wish to export the amino acid sequences, these must be converted to amino acid in the sequence inspector window first. Then, in the export file dialogue box, click the \u201cExport alignment as viewed\u201d tab.jModelTest is a Java version of the earlier ModelTest (17). There is also a MrModeltest (18) that was specifically designed for only testing those models that could be implemented in the program MrBayes. Both these programs are faster than jModeltest, but both run from the terminal window and are more difficult to use.jModelTest appears to have a problem loading NEXUS files. If you get an error with a particular file format, then just try a number of different file formats\u2014as is usually the case, FASTA works fine.In comparison, testing 56 models using ML trees took 1 h 20 min in jModelTest. If you reduce the number of substitution schemes to 3 (i.e., 24 models) and use BIONJ trees, the analysis will run in 10\u201315 min.There is an error in the \u201cLset\u201d command output from jModelTest that will cause an error when executing the file in PAUP* and other programs. Rather than having four numbers for \u201cbase  =  (n1 n2 n3 n4)\u201d this should be \u201cbase  =  (n1 n2 n3). To fix this simply delete the last number. A similar error is made with \u201crmat  =  (n1 n2 n3 n4 n5 n6). There should only be five numbers in the \u201crmat\u201d and the last number should be deleted.The instructions given here are for the Mac OS X Intel multithreaded v0.96, which does not have a graphical user interface, but this version is capable of distributing the analysis over multiple processors.In the GARLI block \u201ce\u201d is equivalent to \u201cbase\u201d in the PAUP* block, \u201cr\u201d to \u201crmat,\u201d \u201ca\u201d to \u201cshape,\u201d and \u201cp\u201d to \u201cpinvar.\u201d Details of GARLI configuration settings are available at the following site: https://www.nescent.org/wg_garli/GARLI_Configuration_Settings.Maximum likelihood bootstraps are very computationally intensive and even using GARLI will take days to complete 1,000 bootstraps for a dataset of 100 full-length HA genes.The instructions given here are for the Mac OS X executable. However, this version runs on a single processor and is quite slow. It is therefore preferable to compile the program source code on a UNIX system, as this version is capable of distributing the analysis over multiple processors.MrModeltest writes a MrBayes block, but jModeltest does not unfortunately. Commands for a MrBayes block are explained in detail in the MrBayes manual.If virus names in the NEXUS file are overly long (e.g., \u226520 characters), this may cause the sumt command to hang indefinitely.Extensive scientific literature illustrates the importance of using an appropriate outgroup taxon. As a rule of thumb, the best outgroup is a taxon that falls within the sister group of the ingroup under study. In the above example, for the Asian highly pathogenic avian influenza H5N1 virus ingroup, a low pathogenic H5 virus \u201cSwan/Hokkaido/51/96\u201d is used as an outgroup.\n",
