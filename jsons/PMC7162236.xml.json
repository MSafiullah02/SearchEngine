            "text": "Human primary immunodeficiencies (PIDs) comprise a broad group of inherited disorders characterised by developmental or functional defects of myeloid or lymphoid haemapoietic-derived cells, as well as non-haemapoietic cells involved in protective immunity. More than 150 different forms of PIDs affecting distinct components of the innate and adaptive immune system, such as neutrophils, macrophages, dendritic cells, complement proteins, natural killer cells, and T and B lymphocytes have been described [1]. Clinically, PIDs can be associated with any combination of infectious disease, autoimmunity, auto-inflammatory, allergy and malignancy. The best known PIDs show Mendelian inheritance and first become symptomatic during childhood. However, the field of PIDs is rapidly expanding and PIDs showing non-Mendelian inheritance and/or affecting primarily adult patients is being increasingly recognized. Conventional PIDs are typically seen as rare monogenic conditions associated with detectable immunologic abnormalities, resulting in a broad susceptibility to multiple and recurrent infections caused by weakly pathogenic and more virulent microorganisms. By opposition to these conventional PIDs, nonconventional primary immunodeficiencies as Mendelian conditions manifesting in otherwise healthy patients as a narrow susceptibility to infections, recurrent or otherwise, caused by weakly pathogenic or more virulent microbes are now reported [2]. By now, up to 120 disease-causing genes have been identified. This molecular characterisation of PIDs has helped to increase our understanding of their physiopathology. The study of these diseases has provided essential insights into the functioning of the immune system with the ultimate goal of facilitating diagnosis and treatment.",

The protocol starts from the clinical presentation of the patient; immunological skills are not needed for its use. A list of relevant symptoms and signs from the history and physical examination that should alert any physician to potential PID is given. These are grouped together to form eight typical clinical presentations of PID: recurrent ENT and airway infections; failure to thrive from early infancy; recurrent pyogenic infections; unusual infections or unusually severe course of infections; recurrent infections with the same type of pathogen; autoimmune or chronic inflammatory disease, or lymphoproliferation; characteristic combinations of clinical features in eponymous syndromes; and angioneurotic edema. These presentations lead the user towards different algorithms, which in fact represent the traditional division into antibody, complement, lymphocyte, and phagocyte deficiencies, respectively. The algorithms each are comprised of several steps. This multistage design allows cost-effective screening for PID within the large pool of potential cases in all hospitals in the early phases, while more expensive tests are reserved for definitive classification in collaboration with an immunologist at a later stage.",

However, despite extensive use of broad-spectrum antibiotics for this condition, the clinical response to the treatment is often poor. This fact, together with vast clinical experience connecting AOM with viral respiratory infections, has prompted research into the role of viruses in AOM. To date, ample evidence from studies ranging from animal experiments to large clinical trials supports a crucial role for respiratory viruses in the aetiology and pathogenesis of AOM. In most cases, viral infection of the upper respiratory mucosa initiates the whole cascade of events that finally leads to the development of AOM as a complication. The pathogenesis of AOM involves a complex interplay between viruses, bacteria, and the host's inflammatory response. Recent studies indicate that with sensitive techniques viruses can be found in the middle-ear fluid in most children with AOM, either alone or together with bacteria. Viruses appear to enhance the inflammatory process in the middle ear, and they may profoundly impair the resolution of otitis media. It is important to understand, however, that our increasing knowledge of the importance of viruses in the etiopathogenesis of AOM does not diminish the central role of bacteria in AOM. Therefore, while viruses may explain many of the problems encountered in treating AOM, the ultimate decision on whether or not to treat AOM with antibiotics cannot be based solely on the degree of viral involvement in AOM.",

Although most of the time this entity resolves spontaneously it is associated with morbidity, family dysfunction, antibiotic use and burden on the medical system.

The first obvious step would be to reduce viral infections leading secondarily to OM. In the modern era, the only viral vaccine with proven effect on AOM is the influenza virus vaccine.

The effect of PCV on the reduction of recurrent OM, OM with effusion, the need for ventilation tubes and frequent visits for AOM has been suggested, and the real impact is still being studied. Aiming with PCV at those with established recurrent OM has proved disappointing. PCVs can reduce OM caused by antibiotic-resistant S. pneumoniae but the continued overuse of antibiotics is responsible for the increase in antibiotic resistance in non-vaccine serotypes. A newly developed PCV with an outer membrane protein for Hi (PnPD) is suggested to reduce also OM caused by Hi, but confirmation studies are needed.

            "text": "For the last six years Greece has faced a large number of infections, mainly in the intensive care units (ICU), due to carbapenems-resistant Klebsiella pneumoniae. The proportion of imipenem-resistant K. pneumoniae has increased from less than 1% in 2001, to 23% in isolates from hospital wards and to 53% in isolates from ICUs in 2008. Likewise, in 2002, these strains were identified in only three hospitals, whereas now they are isolated in at least 32 of the 40 hospitals participating in the Greek Surveillance System. Until 2007 this situation was due to the spread of the blaVIM-1 cassette among the rapidly evolving multiresistant plasmids and multiresistant or even panresistant strains of mainly K. pneumoniae and also other enterobacterial species. However, the fact that most strains display MIC values below or near the CLSI resistance breakpoint create diagnostic and therapeutic problems, and possibly obstruct the assessment of the real incidence of these strains. As of 2007, the emergence of KPC-producing K. pneumoniae has been noted in ICUs of some Greek hospitals and has now spread to most hospitals throughout the country creating a countywide outbreak in 2008. In Attikon University Hospital we recently described the ICU outbreak of KPC-producing K. pneumoniae. Twenty-nine patients (admitted from February to December 2008) were colonised mainly in GI tract. Fifteen patients were male (52%) and the median APACHE II was 19. Patients had already long hospital stays preceding ICU admission with a median of 25 (17\u201340) days. In twenty-two of these patients (76%) KPC-producing K. pneumoniae colonisation was definitely ICU-acquired while in 7 (24%) acquisition in other wards or other hospitals was hypothesized. Five of these patients are still hospitalised in the ICU and, of the remaining 24, 11 died (ICU mortality 46%). Ten of the 29 colonised patients were clinically infected. Fifteen infections were documented, mostly BSI (11/15), followed by VAP (2/15) and SSI (2/15). Only 1 patient died from this infection (1/15, 6.7%).",

Currently >12% of E. coli from bacteraemias are resistant to third-generation cephalosporins. Most (>90%) ESBL-producing E. coli produce CTX-M group 1 enzymes (CTX-M-15 or -3); less common are group 9, 9%, and other groups, 1%. Producers have diverse PFGE patterns, but 5 major strains (A-E), and those clustering with them at >65% similarity, belong to the international O25:H4-ST131 clone. This belongs to phylogroup B2 and is uropathogenic, although the complement of virulence genes varies. Strain A is the most widespread UK ST131 variant (isolates referred from >50 laboratories); D is local to one centre; B, C and E are nationally scattered. Strain A produces CTX-M-15 ESBL encoded on a 118-kb IncFII-FIA plasmid, which encodes resistance to 8 antibacterial classes and is related to internationally-disseminated blaCTX-M plasmids. ST131 E. coli producing CTX-M ESBLs also occur outside the hospital. In a Belfast study, 74/135 nursing home residents carried strain A (CTX-M-15) in their gut flora; 60 others had ST131 variants with IncI1 plasmids encoding CTX-M-3 enzyme. The means of spread in Belfast and nationally is not clear. CTX-M ESBL-producing E. coli are isolated from raw meat, but most produce group 2 or 8 enzymes, which account for <1% of ESBLs from E. coli causing infections. Associations with foreign travel have not yet been fully explored. Are we getting what we deserve? Cephalosporin use drives accumulation of resistance mechanisms, but the rise of CTX-M ESBLs in E. coli could not have be predicted. Their dominance reflects expansion of uropathogenic clones and spread of plasmids. The success of these clone/plasmid combinations implies intrinsic/acquired advantages compared with diverse E. coli strains with CTX-M enzymes. However, not all ST131 E. coli are equal, as illustrated by the national vs. local distribution of UK strains A and D, respectively. As prevalence increases, therapeutic options for ESBL producers are increasingly pushed towards carbapenems. On rare occasions, E. coli strain A has developed carbapenem resistance through OmpC loss combined with non-carbapenemase \u03b2-lactamases. The UK sees a few Enterobacteriaceae with carbapenemases (KPC, OXA-48, VIM or IMP enzymes), though rarely in E. coli. Acquisition of a carbapenemase by a pandemic E. coli clone would have immense public health implications.",

The recent emergence of types 027 and 078 of C. difficile has been associated with increased virulence. C. difficile takes advantage of disruption of the normal intestinal flora as caused by antibiotic therapy. The antibiotical class and the antimicrobial resistance pattern of C. difficile influence the development of disease. In The Netherlands, significantly more patients with CDI due to Type 027 used fluoroquinolones (OR, 2.88; 95% CI, 1.01\u20138.20) compared with those who were infected with other PCR ribotypes. Similar as Type 027 CDI, patients infected with Type 078 also more frequently received fluoroquinolones therapy (OR, 2.17; 95% CI 1.06\u20134.44). The risk to develop CDI due to Type 027 was particularly high in persons receiving a combination of cephalosporin and fluoroquinolone (OR 57.5, 95% CI 6.8\u2013483.6). This association was also strongly dependent on the duration of therapy. The use of clindamycin was found as a protective factor. However, the recent detection of clindamycin-resistant C. difficile Type 027 strains in other European countries is an important and worrying development. Since the association of CDI with fluoroquinolones has only been investigated at patient level, a study was performed to investigate the relationship between CDI incidence and the preceding use of different antibiotic classes at hospital level in The Netherlands. Comparisons were made between hospitals where type 027 caused an epidemic, hospitals where only isolated cases of type 027 were observed and hospitals where no outbreak of CDI or type 027 were encountered. In the pre-epidemic period, the total use antibiotics was comparable between affected and unaffected hospitals. Higher use of second-generation cephalosporins, macrolides and all other studied antibiotics were independently associated with a small increase in CDI incidence, but the effect was too small to predict which hospitals might be more prone to 027-associated outbreaks.",

EUCAST develops species specific breakpoints with the basic principle that they cannot divide wild type MIC distributions for target species. This ensures that all microorganisms lacking of resistance mechanisms are uniformly categorised as susceptible, intermediate or resistant. This also warrants a good reproducibility of MIC results. CLSI follows a similar process but they do not produce species specific BPs. Clinical outcome data has been always analyzed following the 90\u201360 rule. This rule states that infections due to susceptible isolates respond to therapy approximately 90% of the time, whereas infections due to resistant isolates respond approximately 60% of the time. Recently, EUCAST has used data mining tools to analyze and interpret clinical outcome data. Data mining models develops a complex statistical analysis including performance measures like sensitivity, specificity, false positive rate and area under the ROC curve which enable to assess whether the results have statistical relevance or they are chosen at random.

At the same time in each unit were evaluated a total of 145 HCW. Each participant underwent a clinical-epidemiologic examination, and oropharyngeal wash (OW) samples were collected for analysis. P. jirovecii colonisation was identified by nested PCR at mtLSUrRNA gene using the external primers pAZ102-E/-H and the internal primers pAZ102-X/-Y in OW samples.

Yet 50 years ago, this inflammatory reaction was suggested to contribute substantially to brain damage. This concept underlies the use of anti-inflammatory agents as adjunctive therapy in ABM. Of all adjunctive treatments in ABM, only corticosteroids have been properly evaluated in clinical trials. These trials recommend corticosteroids in patients with Haemophilus influenzae type B and pneumococcal meningitis (PM). However, adjunctive corticosteroid therapy has several weaknesses such as a narrow treatment window and borderline effects on neurologic sequelae. Thus, there is still the need for additional or alternate adjuvants in the therapy of ABM. Experimental studies using animal models (predominantly of PM) have provided insight into the pathogenic mechanisms underlying brain injury in ABM. It is now clear that the autodestructive inflammatory reaction is initiated by the interaction of bacterial components with host pattern recognition receptors (PRR) like Toll-like receptors (TLR). PRR signaling results in the activation of transcription factors like NF-kB which up-regulate the production of proinflammatory cytokines. Cytokines like IL-1\u03b2 are also potent triggers of NF-kB activation and therefore can exaggerate the inflammatory reaction (via positive feedback loops). As a consequence, great numbers of neutrophils are recruited to the meninges. Activated neutrophils release many potentially cytotoxic agents including oxidants and matrix metalloproteinases that can cause collateral damage to brain tissue. Additionally to the inflammatory response, direct bacterial cytotoxicty has been identified as a contributor to tissue damage in ABM.",

Important issues such us when the implant can be retained (conservative strategy), optimal duration of antimicrobial therapy (AT) or the role of rifampin are yet matter of controversy. In spite of a number of reports, literature appears confusing. Among the limitations of the literature we must emphasize: 1) Different criteria to classify PJI; 2) Different criteria to select for conservative strategy (CS); 3) No description of the initial population from which patients were selected for CS; 4) Very different AT (from 4 weeks to chronic suppressive therapy); 5) Low numbers of patients or short follow-up; 6) Absence of clinical trials. It is not so surprising that the rates of CS success have varied from 0 to almost 100%. The most useful classification to approach PJI was proposed by Tsukayama (1996). In his series 25 out of 35 patients with early PJI managed by a CS (debridement, exchange of polyethylen and implant retention) were cured after 4 weeks of AT. The Spanish group for the study of PJI was constituted in 2003 within the Spanish network for the study of infectious pathology (REIPI), a public funded initiative. Data from 139 consecutive cases of early PJI attended in 10 hospitals were recorded in an online database. 117 cases managed with CS could be analysed (mean follow-up of 2 years). Sixty-seven patients (57.3%) were cured after a mean of 81 days of AT. In 35 (29.9%) the infection was not controlled (or relapsed) after a mean of 84 days of AT, and the implant had to be removed. In other 15 patients (12.8%) the implant was not removed, but suppressive AT was given because of suspected ongoing infection. Results were significantly worse in one hospital. No other factors resulted statistically significant, but there was a trend of worse results for MRSA produced infections (p = 0.06). Time from the symptoms appearance to debridement was shorter in successfully treated cases (median, 7 days) than in failures (median, 10 days); p = 0.08. Good functional results were obtained in patients with successfully CS. In summary, a substantial proportion of early PJI can be managed with CS strategy and a definite (non suppressive) AT. It is difficult to identify patients at higher risk for failure, although MRSA aetiology and longer time until debridement seem to predict failures. Different outcomes in some centres suggest that surgical technique could be an important factor for failure.",

Pacemaker infections correspond to different clinical situations including localised infection in the device pocket, pacemaker leads to systemic infection associated with bacteraemia and lead-associated endocarditis. This latter represents 10 to 25% of all cases of pacemaker infections. The severity of pacemaker related infective endocarditis is sustained by a mortality range between 10 to 20%. Risk factors related to infections of implanted pacemakers are correlated with fever before 24 h before implantation, temporary pacing before implantation and early re-interventions (haematoma, lead dislodgment). In contrast, an inverse correlation is observed between development of infection and antibiotic prophylaxis and implantation of a new system. Data to guide therapy in patients with pacemaker infection are limited and the most appropriate management remains to be determined. According to different series, staphylococci accounted for 60 to >90% of the responsible organisms. Coagulase-negative staphylococci (CNS) are reported as predominant pathogens following by Staphylocococcus aureus. The biofilm production, responsible for bacterial survival, and the emergence of methicillin-resistant in S. aureus and CNS have complicated the management of pacemaker infections. This implies that empiric treatment of suspected pacemaker infection should coverage for staphylococci including methicillin-resistant strains. Streptococci, Corynebacterium spp, Propionibacterium acnes, Gram-negative bacilli and Candida spp can cause occasional infections. The optimal therapy combines complete device extraction (percutaneous ablation or surgical removal during extracorporeal circulation) and prolonged course of antibiotics, in particular in case of multiresistant bacteria. Leaving the device intact is associated with increased mortality and risk of relapsing or persistent infections. In absence of prospective studies, the duration of antibiotic treatment remains to be determined but 1 month has been shown not to be associated with an increased incidence of relapse. Shortest course of treatment (2 weeks) has been proposed in case of vegetations strictly localised to leads without affecting cardiac valves. Antibiotic therapy working alone should be reserved for highly selected patients.",

Children are more likely than adults to acquire shunt infection.

Staphylococci, as skin commensals, are the main causative organisms. Nevertheless, in recent years a change in the epidemiology of microorganisms was observed with an increase of Gram-negative bacteria. Appropriate systemic antibiotics according to the antimicrobial susceptibility testing and surgical removal of the shunt with temporary external cerebrospinal fluid drainage and shunt replacement following the eradication of the infection are the cornerstone of the treatment of cerebrospinal fluid shunt infections. Good compliance with infection control practices, inserion of the catheter under aseptic techniques and short-term perioperative antimicrobial prophylaxis in order to prevent the emergence of drug-resistant subpopulations are important steps in the prevention of shunt infections.",

There were 56 episodes in 54 patients. Thirty-one patients were male (55%) with a mean age of 52 years (\u00b1 16). Forty three (77%) patients had an haematological underlying disease and 13 had solid tumour; 41 (73%) had received previous chemotherapy, 14 (25%) were stem cell transplant recipients (3 presenting with GVHD) and 17 (30%) were neutropenic (<500). In the previous month 52 patients (93%) had received one or more antibiotics (cephalosporins 63.5%, glycopeptides 40%, carbapenems 38.5%, betalactam + betalactam inhibitors 29%, quinolones 19%). Fever >38\u00b0C (71%) and abdominal pain (44%) were the most frequent manifestations, and the diarrhoea was hemorrhagic in 8% of the cases. Most patients (77%) were treated with metronidazole (median 11 days), and the antibiotic therapy was discontinued in 56%. In 5 patients who had recovered from neutropenia, the diarrhoea resolved just by discontinuing the antibiotic therapy. No patient developed toxic megacolon or needed surgery. Three patients (5.5%) had relapses. Overall mortality (<30 days) was 22% (12 patients). Conclusion: The incidence of CD associated diarrhoea in cancer patients has increased significantly in recent years. It is related with important morbidity and mortality. Better strategies to improve its prevention and treatment are needed.",

Clindamycin resistance in Bacteroides is mediated by a macrolide-lincomycin-streptogramin (MLS) mechanism and its frequency differs in different countries in Europe. Resistance to beta-lactam-beta-lactamase inhibitor combinations was studied using amoxicillin-clavulanic acid and/or piperacillin-tazobactam. Increase in resistance was observed to both combinations throughout the years. The same is true for cefoxitine and in the third study several hetero-resistant isolates were found. The occurrence and spread of resistance to imipenem and metronidazole among Bacteroides strains merit special clinical importance. The presence of the cfiA gene is much more prevalent than the expression of the imipenem resistance; however the spread of the cfiA gene among species other than B. fragilis is still very rare. The molecular genetic methods looking for the resistance genes among strains with elevated MICs against these antibiotics prove that resistance breakpoints should be reconsidered. The resistance to moxifloxacin shows great differences in different countries. The lowest resistance rate was observed in the case of tigecyclin.",

Thus, correlation between treatment failure and antibiotic resistance among anaerobes remains difficult to assess. The main discrepancies came from intra-abdominal infections and a worrisome disjunction between surgeon and microbiologist opinions emerged in the 1990's. But, patients in whom primary therapy failed had more resistant strains compared with patients in whom therapy succeeded. In contrast many failures may be due to the lack of isolation of anaerobes from clinical samples! During anaerobic bacteraemia, Salonen et al. demonstrated that mortality increased dramatically from 17% for initially effective treatment to 55% when an ineffective treatment was started. Facing new mechanisms of resistance and global increase resistance to many antibiotics among anaerobes may lead nowadays to a different answer. Clindamycin vs. penicillin studies for the treatment of lung infections pointed out the failure due to \u03b2-lactamase production among Gram-negative anaerobes. We found many reports of failure after clindamycin treatment in osteomyelitis, septic arthritis, brain abscess in presence of clindamycin-resistant anaerobes (Bacteroides fragilis group and Prevotella), probably because when resistance occurs, clindamycin MIC's are high. Similarly, the lack of coverage of an undetected resistant anaerobe allows the selection of an anaerobic strain resistant to the treatment chosen against the associated aerobes such as imipenem-resistant Eghertella lenta or metronidazole-resistant strains of Prevotella or Bacteroides fragilis. The later failures may give opportunity to set up a new metronidazole breakpoint for resistance (MIC > 4 mg/L). The main problem is related to the difficulty to detect some heterogeneous resistant strains, that needs prolonged incubation period on agar medium. This kind of situation is probably the most suitable to correlate the bacterial antibiotic resistance with the failure of the antibiotic treatment. The difficulty to detect heterogeneous resistant strains may explain some failures observed during metronidazole treatment of C. difficile. Clinicians should be encouraged to publish the clinical failures of their first line treatments when associated with a bacterial resistance among anaerobic bacteria.",

CA-MRSA are associated with both skin and soft tissue infections and invasive infections. Recurrent soft tissue infections and infections within the family caused by CA-MRSA isolates are common. CA-MRSA S. aureus isolates containing gene coding for PVL have been associated with serious staphylococcal pneumonia as well as osteomyelitis complicated by subperiosteal abscesses or venous thromboses. In addition to vancomycin, CA-MRSA generally are susceptible to clindamycin and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole. Treatment of superficial skin and soft tissue infections involves surgical drainage of abscesses followed by an oral agent such as TMP-SMX or clindamycin. Minocycline or doxycycline is a consideration for children >8 years old. Empiric vancomycin is typically administered for more serious and invasive infections such as osteomyelitis, septic arthritis, serious head and neck infections or suspected Staphylococcal pneumonia. Clindamycin is efficacious in treating invasive CA-MRSA infections caused by susceptible organisms. Linezolid or daptomycin is another option in selected circumstances. MRI is the optimal imaging modality for assessing children with CA-MRSA osteomyelitis. Aggressive surgical drainage of subperiosteal abscesses or sites of pyomyositis is recommended. Venous thombosis is increasingly recognized as a complication of CA-MRSA osteomyelitis. Anti-coagulation until the thrombus has resolved is recommended. The optimal approach to prevention of recurrent CA-MRSA infections is unclear but a strategy that includes emphasizing personal hygiene, plus/minus antimicrobial soaps, mupirocin to the nose or \u201cbleach baths\u201d is frequently suggested.",

As a human pathogen, GAS pathogenesis research should ideally be shaped by clinical questions arising from either epidemiological or case-based investigation of human disease. In the mid 1990 s, large epidemiological studies pointed to a central role for specific T cell-stimulating superantigens in the aetiology of streptococcal toxic shock. This sparked a series of clinical and laboratory investigations that demonstrated production of superantigens during infection which were indeed capable of triggering massive T cell activation in patients but were unlikely, alone, to account for all the features observed in toxic shock. Genomic, clinical and laboratory-based investigations have identified novel and highly potent superantigens that appear to directly contribute to sepsis pathogenesis and, together, may constitute targets for adjunctive treatments in invasive disease.",

Investigation of patients with invasive GAS infection led to the discovery that GAS produces an enzyme that can cleave and inactivate human chemokines and study of patients with bacteraemia has highlighted a likely role for the causal enzyme SpyCEP in disease pathogenesis; this bacterial surface enzyme has also shown promise as a potential vaccine antigen. Notwithstanding a potential role for individual virulence factors in disease causation, clinical studies have demonstrated that GAS bacteria may persist at the site of infection despite high concentrations of bactericidal antibiotics, and this has been borne out by experimental studies; the reasons behind such persistence are unclear but may include internalisation of GAS by immune cells, formation of biofilm, and antibiotic penetration of necrotic tissues.

S. pyogenes is known to primarily cause disease by activating and modulating host immune responses. The exotoxins with superantigenic activities have been demonstrated to be crucial triggers of excessive inflammatory responses and consequently systemic toxicity, organ dysfunction, tissue necrosis and shock. Another important virulence determinant is the M-protein, which is classically known for its anti-phagocytic properties, and lately, was shown to trigger pro-inflammatory responses as well as induction of vascular leakage and shock. This likely represents important mechanisms contributing to the rapid development of shock and systemic toxicity in patients with severe invasive group A streptococcal infections. The understanding of these infections as hyperinflammatory diseases highlighted the potential of immunotherapy to improve outcome. One such strategy includes the administration of intravenous polyspecific immunoglobulin (IVIG) as adjunctive therapy. The mechanistic actions of IVIG in this setting are believed to include opsonisation of the bacteria, neutralisation of the superantigens and suppression of the pro-inflammatory responses. There is growing evidence to support the use of IVIG in patients with streptococcal toxic shock syndrome. These studies include one observational cohort study based on Canadian patients identified through active surveillance of invasive group A streptococcal infections, and one European multicentre placebo-controlled trial.",

In addition to common viral pathogens, arthropod-borne viruses (transmitted through insect or tick-bite) can cause arboviral encephalitis. In Europe, the most important pathogens responsible for arboviral encephalitis are tick-borne encephalitis virus (TBEV), West Nile virus (WNV) and Sandfly fever virus (SFV). Tick-borne encephalitis (TBE) is the most important flavivirus infection of the central nervous system (CNS) in Europe and Russia. The epidemiology of TBE is closely related to the ecology and biology of ticks. In nature, TBE virus is propagated in a cycle involving permanently infected ticks and wild vertebrate hosts. Virus transmission occurs horizontally between tick vectors and vertebrates, with small mammals serving as virus reservoirs. TBE is distributed in an endemic pattern of natural foci over a wide geographical area focused on central Europe, the Baltic States and Russia. During the past two decades, both new endemic foci and an increase in cases have been reported in many European countries, with the major exception being Austria, which has a high vaccine coverage (>86%). The disease has also been considered outside the traditional endemic areas. Some reports of new endemic areas are attributed to a previous under diagnosis of cases. However, the true nature of this rise is supported by an increase in areas with high awareness of the disease and with well established diagnostic routines. Environmental factors important for sustaining natural foci for tick-borne encephalitis can be modeled with satellite data. These models suggest that climate change is partly responsible for increased incidence in Europe. But, existing methods for risk assessment have limitations. Thus, risk assessment should combine human habits and socioeconomic variables with functional variables in natural foci. West Nile virus (WNV) is a flavivirus that is maintained in a bird-mosquito transmission cycle. Humans and horses are usually incidental hosts. Historically, WNV has been associated with asymptomatic infections and sporadic disease outbreaks in humans and horses in Africa, Europe, and Asia. Although, WN fever was a minor arbovirosis, some cases of encephalitis associated with fatalities were reported in Israel in the 1950 s. However, after few silent decades, the virus has caused frequent outbreaks of severe neuroinvasive disease in humans and horses in Europe and the Mediterranean Basin. Even more, new modes of transmission through blood donations, organ transplants, and the intrauterine route have been reported. In Europe, an enhanced surveillance of WN infection in humans, horses, birds, and vectors may reveal the presence of the virus in different locations. Nevertheless, outbreaks of WN virus remain unpredictable. Further coordinated studies are needed for a better understanding of the ecology and the pathogenicity of the WN virus.",

In his article \u201cDie multilokul\u00e4re, ulcerirende Echinokokkengeschwulst der Leber\u201d (1855) he clarified that the disease is caused by the larval stage of Echinococcus, and is not a form of cancer. It took another 100 years until the natural cycle involving foxes as definitive hosts and rodents as intermediate hosts was described. For many years, AE has been assigned to as a rare disease in Europe restricted to some endemic foci. However, current data suggest that the incidence of AE has significantly increased, and the disease is spreading to the North, West, and East. AE has become an emerging disease in the Baltic countries. Thus, human infections with E. multilocularis have arrived in the \u201ccentre\u201d of Europe. AE is a life-threatening disease, and is characterised by a tumour-like lesion in the liver. The larva can infiltrate the surrounding tissues and metastasize to distant organs. In an attempt to classify the large variety of anatomical findings in AE, the PNM-classification system was developed and serves as a benchmark for standardised evaluation of diagnostic and therapeutic measures. Modern imaging techniques, such as ultrasound, CT or MRI and PET/CT contributed not only to a much better description of the lesions, but also to a judgment upon the activity of the metacestode. The differential diagnosis of AE varies from haemangioma-like lesion of the liver or cancer. The diagnostic skills are limited, and are the reason for frequent misdiagnosis in geographic areas where AE is rather unknown. Continuous treatment with benzimidazoles is the backbone of a lifelong management of AE. However, radical resection is the procedure of choice and should always be strived for. AE is still a rare disease in Europe, but where it occurs, it is often diagnosed too late. Patients are misdiagnosed for months and years, before receiving the correct treatment. At that late stage the disease has progressed, and radical cure of the liver lesion(s) is not anymore possible. Recent reports provided hints for an accelerated larval growth of Echinococcus spp. in the immunodeficient host. A careful monitoring of patients receiving immune-modifying drugs is warranted. The modern clinical management and long-term parasitostatic treatment with benzimidazoles are highly effective. Thus, a higher alertness for the \u201ctumours from the centre\u201d would increase the prognosis of this hepatic disease resembling liver cancer.",

Dirofilariasis is due to the transmission of microfilariae by some mosquito bites (Aedes, Culex, Anopheles, Mansonia, Psorophora and Taeniorhynchus). Usually non pathogenic to humans, these parasites are particularly present around the Mediterranean basin. D. immitis is very rare in humans in Europe, sometimes found in a pulmonary nodule and the heart location is not described. D. repens is more frequent and emerging in humans. Usually, only one larva develops, producing an immature adult worm inside a subcutaneous nodule. Ultrasound examination may suggest the parasitic origin of the lesion before an extraction and a parasitological diagnosis of the worm.

An ocular and subconjunctival location of the worm and a subcutaneous nodule enclosing an immature adult are the commonest clinical forms. Exceptional pulmonary locations are described.

Detection of ESBLs based only on susceptibility testing is not easy due to the variety of \u03b2-lactamases and their variable expression of \u03b2-lactam resistance. Commercially available ESBL detection methods yield at most 90% accurate ESBL identification, since some ESBL-producers may appear susceptible to some ESCs. Therefore, any organism showing reduced susceptibility to ESC should be investigated using ESBL confirmatory tests. These tests should be able to discriminate between ESBL-producers and those with other mechanisms conferring ESC resistance. These phenotypic tests (double-disk synergy test, ESBL Etest, and the combination disk method) are based on clavulanate inhibition and ESC susceptibility testing. They often need slight changes by either reducing the distance between the disks of ESC and clavulanate, the use of cefepime (not hydrolysed by AmpCs), the use of cloxacillin-containing plates (that inhibits AmpC), or by double inhibition by EDTA and clavulanate (masking metallo-enzymes).

Death in hospital or within 30 days of treatment occurred in 19 (10%) patients. The patients received a total of 80 different empirical antimicrobial regimens. We stratified patients by Eron classification. We defined sepsis as presence of Systemic Inflammatory Response Syndrome (SIRS) and severe sepsis as a Standardised Early Warning Score >4. Two Infectious Diseases Physicians (CM and PD) independently judged empirical antimicrobial therapy as inadequate if it did not cover the most likely pathogens for any Eron Grade or if it was oral for Grades 2 to 4. Agreement between raters was 88%. Mortality and inadequate therapy both increased with Eron grade:\n1.No SIRS or co-morbidity: 45% patients, 4% mortality, 10% therapy inadequate.2.Significant co-morbidity but no SIRS: 33% patients, 7% mortality, 41% therapy inadequate.3.Sepsis, with SIRS: 17% of patients, 22% mortality, 40% therapy inadequate4.Severe sepsis: 5% of patients, 50% mortality, 100% therapy inadequate.\n",

The approach to containment and reduction of the global MRSA pandemic is now being discussed. A challenge for this infection is that most persons harbouring MRSA do not exhibit signs of disease and thus in order to detect all potential spreaders of this organism some surveillance must be done. The required level of detection (surveillance through screening) is not known and likely varies with the prevalence of colonisation and disease. For a given MRSA prevalence, the factor that seems most crucial in reducing spread is the percentage of potential isolation days captured. The operational processes that highly influence this are 1) the sensitivity of screening detection (including sites tested and laboratory methods used), 2) the speed at which results of newly detected positive patients are reported from the laboratory (assuming pre-emptive isolation is not employed), and 3) the selection of patient populations who are to undergo screening. Laboratory testing has a major impact on detecting MRSA colonised patients with real-time PCR having a sensitivity of 98% and a possible 2 hour reporting time compared to direct chromogenic agar cultures with a sensitivity of 80% and >24 hour reporting and enriched chromogenic agar testing with a sensitivity of 90% and >48 hour reporting (Am J Clin Pathol, 2009); both reduced sensitivity and prolonged reporting time negatively impacting the success of MRSA timely isolation. We have shown that capturing 33% of MRSA isolation days in a modest MRSA prevalence setting (9 infections/10,000 patient days) with a high sensitivity test having a >24 hour result reporting time did not reduce hospital-wide MRSA disease (Ann Int Med 148:209, 2008). Others have demonstrated that surveillance in an ICU with similar MRSA prevalence, again with a high sensitivity test having 1 day result reporting, did not reduce ICU disease until preemptive isolation was initiated (Crit Care 10:R25, 2006). Finally, we demonstrated that universal admission surveillance and decolonisation capturing 85% of possible MRSA isolation days had a dramatic impact by reducing 70% of all in-hospital infections from MRSA. Future research in this area should focus on better defining those patients that benefit from MRSA screening and the role of decolonisation in these programs.",

While fluoroqinolone resistance and over-use are thought to be driving the epidemic, the ageing population and improved case ascertainment are contributing to the dramatic increase in cases. Other factors may also be important, such as the increase in prescription of proton pump inhibitors. In The Netherlands, since 2005, there has been an increase in prevalence of human CDI with ribotype 078 strains usually found in animals. These infections were in a younger population and more frequently community acquired. There was alarm when it was reported that 20% of retail beef samples in Canada contained C. difficile. The figure is higher in the USA where more than 40% of packaged meats (beef, pork and turkey) from 3 Arizona stores contained C. difficile. Most animal isolates of C. difficile produce binary toxin, and both pigs and cattle harbour PCR ribotype 078 a strain that, like ribotype 027, also produces more toxins A and B, and binary toxin. In the eastern part of The Netherlands where >90% of pig farms are located, >20% of human isolates are now ribotype 078, and human and pig strains of C. difficile are highly genetically related. It has been suggested that the overlap between the location of pig farms in The Netherlands and the occurrence of human ribotype 078 infections involves a common source. That source is likely to be the environment. The upsurge in CDI has prompted diagnostic companies to try to either improve current tests or develop new ones. Laboratory diagnostic methods can be divided into 3 groups; traditional faecal cytotoxin detection (with or without culture), enzyme immunoassays (EIAs) and molecular methods. Faecal cytotoxin detection is specific but lacks sensitivity, culture is sensitive but lacks specificity. New EIAs should find a niche in medium sized laboratories. Current in-house PCR methods have the potential for great sensitivity and specificity but have been available only in larger laboratories. New commercially-available platforms will make this methodology more accessible to smaller laboratories. Whatever method is chosen, it is necessary for the laboratory to have as fast a turn-around-time as possible, particularly in an outbreak situation.",

In the past five-ten years, medical and societal query for a more rapid and refined detection and identification of pathogens and antimicrobial resistance determinants coincided with the expansion of internet-based and remote tools for communication, an unprecedented revolution in laboratory technologies and new financial constraints. The concentration of laboratory workforces into one unique laboratory is one way to address these apparently contradictory issues. The tertiary medical school hospital system in Marseille, a 2-million metropolitan area in France, comprises four hospitals for a total of 3,500 beds. The system had once four microbiology laboratories which have been progressively embedded into a unique, 600,000 acts per year, laboratory which deals with bacteriology, virology and environmental microbiology and hygiene. The medical staff comprises of 17, the ingenior staff of 11, technical staff of 88 and support staff of 13 persons for a total of 129 persons. This organisation allowed reducing labour time for routine microbiology, to develop prospective and sophisticated time-consuming diagnostic methods and to develop advanced diagnostic methods such as molecular methods (real-time PCR-based tests, sequencing, and mass spectrometry identification) and new generation serology. New, sophisticated technologies such as automated serology and mass spectrometry were corner-stones on which to base the constant diminution of routine labour time and the development of time-consuming tasks such as fastidious organisms' isolation. These evolutions paralleled the exponential increase in the ratio of ingeniors in the laboratory. This paradigm allowed for the constitution of large collections of biological specimens for retrospective analyses, the specialisation of every medical senior in one particular field of internationally recognized expertise and the increase in knowledge output in terms of peer-reviewed papers, patents and grants. Implantation of point-of-care in the emergency department, in permanent internet-based connection with the central laboratory, was the last, but not least, evolution of this system.",

It is obvious that infections play a role in the etiopathogenesis of atherosclerosis, stroke and myocardial infarction but the undirected routine antimicrobial treatment is not recommended for these patients but there seems to be subgroups in patients with various cardiovascular diseases which may benefit from antimicrobial treatment.

VX-166 administered by repeat IV bolus (0, 4, 8 and 12 h post-LPS) significantly improved survival in a dose-dependent fashion (p < 0.0001). In the rat peritonitis model, adult male Sprague-Dawley rats (n = 12 per group) underwent caecal ligation and puncture (CLP) and survival was monitored over 10d. Continuous administration of VX-166 by mini-osmotic pump (0.9 mg/kg/h) immediately following surgery significantly improved survival (p < 0.01) from 38% in the control group to 88% in the compound-treated group. Mode of action studies in the rat CLP model confirmed that VX-166 reduced thymic atrophy and lymphocyte apoptosis (p < 0.01), supporting the anti-apoptotic activity of the compound in vivo.

However, over the last decade the R-plasmid paradigm has begun to be challenged. \u2018Resistance islands\u2019 comprising large, chromosomally-integrated spans of alien DNA harbouring multiple antibiotic resistance genes have been identified in the major hospital pathogens methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) and multi-resistant Acinetobacter baumannii, and the food- and water-borne diarrhoeal pathogens Shigella, Salmonella and Vibrio cholerae. In addition, comparative genomics analysis of the archetypal Haemophilus influenzae conjugative resistance element that had spread worldwide revealed that it belonged to a large syntenic family of integrative islands, members of which could be found in at least 15 other \u03b2-and \u03b3-Proteobacteria. With the exception of the A. baumannii island, these elements can be described as classic self-excising, -circularising and -integrative elements. All three functions are mediated by short island-flanking direct repeats and cognate integrase proteins encoded by the islands. In 2006 Fournier et al. described an 86kb A. baumannii island (AbaR1) which harboured 45 resistance genes packaged within a highly mosaic, integron-rich element that had almost certainly evolved via recombination, transposition and integron-mediated cassette capture from an \u2018empty\u2019 ancestral prototype. AbaR1 probably represents a new class of resistance island as it exhibits several features reminiscent of complex nested transposons, suggesting a distinct functional natute. However, despite the widespread distribution of resistance and genomic islands only a minority are known to code for part or all of the conjugative machinery necessary for their dissemination; others have been mobilised by helper plasmids or bacteriophages. Regardless, data on the mechanisms of mobilisation of the vast majority of similar nonresistance islands remain sparse. Importantly, resistance islands may not consists merely of packages of resistance genes.

In many prospective clinical trials it has been shown that a sustained HBV DNA response was correlated with serologic, histologic, or biochemical responses. Despite the recent progress in hepatitis B antiviral treatment, it is shown that antiviral drug resistance is inevitable against many of the nucleoside analogs. The emergence of antiviral-resistant strains of HBV leads to viral and subsequently biochemical breakthrough and may lead to disease progression and increased death. Most of the data on the clinical impact of antiviral resistant HBV came from the data derived from studies of lamivudine therapy. There is limited data on other HBV antiviral drugs like adefovir. It is shown in several studies that treatment of HBeAg-negative chronic hepatitis B with lamivudine effectively suppresses HBV replication and results in biochemical remission and histologic improvement in more than two thirds of patients. However, relapse has occurred in the majority of HBeAg-negative patients after the cessation of therapy. There are several studies to support the occurrence of severe hepatic flares, and liver failure after the emergence of lamivudine resistance. Several studies, where liver biopsies were taken, demonstrated that histological improvement was reduced in those patients experiencing lamivudine resistance. The clinical outcome for patients with antiviral resistance is related to their age, the severity of the underlying liver disease and the severity of the hepatic flares. On the other hand in a different study it was found that long-term lamuvidine treatment was associated with a reduced chance of developing cirrhosis and HCC in patients without advanced disease but, although resistant mutants reduced the benefits from lamivudine therapy, the outcome of these patients was still better than untreated patients. Results of several clinical trials have shown that the addition or substitution of newer antiviral agents can restore suppression of viral replication, normalisation of liver function and reverse histological progression in patients with antiviral resistance. Consequently, well-tolerated, potent therapies that offer a strong genetic barrier against the development of resistance are desirable, since antiviral resistance and poor adherence are key risk factors for treatment failure and subsequent reversal of clinical improvement.",

The behaviour of these two species towards antibiotics is very different: resistance in N. gonorrhoeae is now widespread occuring as both chromosomally and plasmid mediated to a variety of drugs, whereas, besides resistance to sulphonamides, N. meningitidis remains largely susceptible to antibiotics used both for therapy and prophylaxis. However, as in the gonococcus, the resistance to antibiotics of N. meningitidis is also evolving, as documented by the ever higher frequency of strains with intermediate resistance to penicillin in many countries. Transformation has apparently provided both species with a mechanism by which they can increase resistance to penicillin by replacing part of their penA gene, which encodes PBP2, with part of the penA gene of related species that fortuitously produces forms of PBP2 less susceptible to the antibiotic. N. meningitidis is still at this step, whereas N. gonorrhoeae has acquired also mutation in the ponA gene that encodes PBP1, mutation in porin IB, increased expression of efflux pump and the TEM-1 \u03b2-lactamase plasmid. The emergence and the spread of gonococci fully resistant to penicillin since the second half of the 1980 s years led to the recommended use of fluoroquinolones as primary therapy. However, this class of antibiotics became rapidly unefficacious, mainly in Asia, due to the emergence of mutations in gyrA and parC which are able to block the activity of the quinolones on gyrase and topoisomerase IV. Since 2006, CDC no longer recommends their use for treatment of gonococcal diseases. Fortunately, the occurrence of quinolone resistant meningococci, due to mutations in gyrA, is still rare but even if cases are still few they are of great concern for the epidemic potential of this pathogen and the required prophylaxis of contacts.",

The loss of AtlE did not alter the virulence of S. epidermidis in the mouse peritonitis model, whereas it decreased virulence in previously published experiments using an intravenous catheter infection model. Therefore, the mouse peritonitis model was suited to compare antibiotics efficacy against atlE(+) and atlE(\u2212) strains. Our results showed that the loss of atlE did not alter significantly the activity of cloxacillin and vancomycin in the mouse peritonitis model.

The dosages of antimicrobials used were equivalent to the AUC of the human 400 mg MXF IV q.d. and the time above MIC of human 3.375 g PIP/TAZ IV q.d.s. therapy.

This increased resistance can be referred to an enhanced production of the siderophore-binding peptide lipocalin 2 and the reduced availability of iron for Salmonella engulfed by Hfe deficient macrophages. This effect is mediated via stimulation of lipocalin 2-dependent iron export from infected cells since Hfe\u2013/\u2013 macrophages concurrently knocked out for lipocalin 2 are unable to efficiently control the infection or to withhold iron from intracellular Salmonella.

Administration of systemic antimicrobials (with or without inhaled ones), as opposed to placebo or no treatment, in patients with VAT was not associated with lower mortality (OR: 0.56, 95% CI 0.27\u20131.14). Most of the studies providing relevant data noted that administration of antimicrobial agents, as opposed to placebo or no treatment, in patients with VAT was associated with more ventilator-free days and lower frequency of subsequent pneumonia, but without shorter length of intensive care unit stay or shorter duration of mechanical ventilation.",

            "text": "\nHelicobacter pylori causes a chronic infection in the human gastric mucosa (gastritis) worldwide. Man is the natural host of H. pylori. It has been estimated that about half of the world's population is infected. The critical period to obtain the infection is in childhood and early adolescense, although the precise person-to-person transmission routes are largely unclear. Low socioeconomic status and crowded living conditions are risk factors for H. pylori infection. In these conditions the child may easily obtain the infection from an infected mother or infected siblings. H. pylori usually causes a life-long infection, which only rarely disappears unless treated. However, since the early 1900 s, and particularly during the latter half of the century, the prevalence rates of H. pylori infection have clearly decreased in developed countries along with rapidly improving living standars. In elderly people the infection is still common and reflects the high prevalence rates of the infection in their childhood, whereas in the youngest age groups, the infection is rare due to a low rate of childhood infections. In developed countries the rate of new infections in adults is rare, about 1\u20132% per 10 years and thus, the low prevalence of H. pylori at present in the young age groups is not likely to increase during the coming years. In a recent study from Finland, the seroprevalence of H. pylori was about 3% among teenagers and among the 45-year-old subjects the seroprevalence was <30%. In addition to the natural decline of H. pylori infection, the active treatment of the infection in many developed countries has contributed to the rapid disappearance of H. pylori. The prevalence of H. pylori is much higher in developing than developed countries. This is also reflected in developed countries in the higher prevalence rates of H. pylori among children born to parents of foreign origin. H. pylori causes always gastritis and about 15\u201320% of the infected individuals will develop other sequelae such as peptic ulcer disease. However, the rapidly declining prevalence rate of the infection is reflected in the decreasing number of H. pylori positive peptic ulcers in many countries. About one third or even half of infected individuals develop atrophic gastritis, a risk factor for gastric cancer, during decades of the infection. The declining prevalence rates of H. pylori infection have been associated with the declining incidences of gastric cancer later on.",

Some of the tests require invasive procedures (endoscopy) and some others belong to group of noninvasive tests. Usually, the diagnosis of H. pylori infection must be proved at least by two positive tests. The sensitivity and the specificity of the tests is variable. The choice of the tests is dependent not only their invasive or nonivasive character or their sensitivity and specificity, but also on the aim of testing (screening of population, diagnosing of the disease, checkup of the results of treatment). Additional factor influencing the results of testing is the prevalence of H. pylori infection in studied target groups. The accuracy of the tests is lower in a primary health care setting than in a hospital setting owing to the lower prevalence of target disorders among patients consulting the family doctor. Estimation of the pre-test probabilities of the infection in individual patients is needed to achieve high accuracy of test results. Also validation of the tests is essential for different populations as the rate of H. pylori infection varies greatly among different European countries and different ethnic groups.",

After translocation the effector protein CagA is phosphorylated on tyrosine residues restricted to a previously identified repeated sequence called D1. This sequence is located in the C-terminal half of the protein and contains the five amino acid motif EPIYA, which is amplified by duplications in a large fraction of clinical isolates. Tyrosine-phosphorylation of CagA is essential for the activation process that leads to dramatic changes in the morphology of cells growing in culture. In addition, we observed that two members of the Src kinases family, c-Src and Lyn, account for most of the CagA-specific kinase activity in AGS cell lysates. Translocated CagA interacts with the ZO-1 and Jam host-cell proteins causing disruption of the apical junctional complex. Transfection of the cagA gene into polarised epithelial cells induces disruption of cell-to-cell contacts and altered morphology. Strikingly CagA-expressing cells become migratory and invasive penetrating into collagen gel. The study of different portions of the molecule revealed the presence of two distinct functional domains and both are necessary to induce abnormal cell differentiation through interactions with host cell morphogens. Cell polarity and invasion have been suggested to contribute to both early and late stages of cancer formation. These results suggest a mechanism by which CagA may acts at the early stage of tumorigenic progression causing loss of cell polarity, increased cell motility and invasiveness of epithelial cells.",

In 2004, a large chikungunya virus (CHIKV) outbreak emerged in Eastern Africa, spread in West Indian Ocean islands with an unprecedented devastating outbreak in 2005\u20132006, then jumped to India and continued expansion into South-eastern Asia. In 2007, the virus reached Europe. Since the beginning of this outbreak, several million cases of chikungunya virus disease have occurred in autochthonous populations and in travelers who were diagnosed after they returned home from epidemic areas. New clinical entities, including severe to lethal presentations, were reported in complement to classical features, a febrile polyarthritis followed by long-lasting rheumatism. CHIKV which was usually transmitted by Aedes aegypti mosquitoes, has now been repeatedly associated with a new vector, Ae. albopictus (the \u201cAsian Tiger Mosquito\u201d) which has spread in tropical areas previously occupied predominantly by Ae. aegypti, and has dispersed worldwide. Within one year, a single new mutation (E1-A226V) was present in the CHIKV isolates in all places, providing selective advantage for CHIKV transmission by Ae. albopictus. Due to the globalisation of Ae. albopictus, this mutation increases the potential for CHIKV to permanently extend its range into Europe, Americas and other susceptible areas. As CHIKV could spread throughout the world, all physicians should be prepared to encounter this arboviral infection that represent a paradigm for emerging arboviral infections. We present here the different aspects of this reemerging and fascinating disease, focusing on the lessons from the recent large scale outbreaks.",

Such conditions include: persons at the extremes of age; exposure to especially virulent organisms; patients with concomitant illness impairing pulmonary clearance mechanisms; and immunocompromised hosts. Pathogens overcome an array of innate and acquired host defences to successfully invade the host. The known virulence traits of three common respiratory pathogens (Streptococcus pneumoniae, Staphylococcus aureus, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa) will be briefly reviewed. The capsular polysaccharide of pneumococci is the major anti-phagocytic virulence trait but many other factors contribute to disease pathogenesis including the critically important exotoxin known as pneumolysin, bacteriocins, adherence factors, choline binding proteins, lipoteichoic acid, iron, manganese and magnesium transporters, pili, competence and biofilm capacity, and virulence genes that promote invasion and impair clearance once the organism has entered the blood stream. S. aureus is notorious for the numerous A/B type toxins, cytotoxins, and superantigens it generates during the course of invasion. Staphylococci deploy a complex series of quorum sensing signals that coordinate adhesin and invasion genes within biofilms or between planktonic organisms and likely contribute to the success of this pathogen. P. aeruginosa produces an array of extracellular exotoxins and cytotoxins delivered by type III secretion systems. These include elastase, phospholipases C, a series of apoptotic and anti-phagocytic exotoxins, along with an alginate capsule and an unusual and variable LPS structure that participate in microbial invasion. The pathogen expresses at least three interacting, quorum sensing systems to coordinate virulence and biofilm formation. A detailed understanding of these virulence factors is now providing therapeutic options to control these respiratory pathogens. Surface expressed and extracellular toxins of pneumococci have been selected as new vaccine targets. Inhibitory peptides and small molecule inhibitors of quorum sensing and biofilm formation are under investigation for staphylococcal and P. aeruginosa infections. These innovative and non-antibiotic treatment strategies are gaining greater importance as progressive antibiotic resistance threatens the management of these severe bacterial infections in the future.",

Furthermore, animal and human disease has re-emerged in numerous countries which were brucellosis-free, and currently the most important endemic foci include Near East and Central Asia. Complex socioeconomic and political factors may be incriminated for these alterations in endemicity. The complex mechanisms by which Brucella evades immune response and survives intracellularly are progressively clarified. Novel diagnostic techniques as real time PCR may shed light in the life cycle of Brucella inside the human host; preliminary studies have indicated that the pathogen may persist in latent form for years after apparent clinical cure, in asymptomatic individuals. Treatment principles have not evolved significantly. The expert guidelines issued recently under the name of \u201cIoannina Recommendations\u201d support the need for a six-week combined treatment that includes traditional antibacterials and is modified accordingly in serious complications as spondylitis and central nervous system involvement.

PER-1 was first detected in Turkey and was found to be widespread among Acinetobacter spp. and P. aeruginosa. Since then, PER-1 has been discovered in other countries, and most recently found in northern Italy and in Korea. In this study, the presence of PER-1 type ESBL was investigated in caftazidime resistant A. baumannii strains isolated from bloodstream infections by PCR and also the clonal relatedness of the isolates were investigated by Random Amplified Polymorphic DNA (RAPD) and Pulsed Field Gel Electrophoresis (PFGE) in all PER-1 producing A. baumannii strains.",

In this respect, the Mex (for Multiple efflux) systems are of particular interest because of their ability to extrude a wide range of antimicrobials. These polyspecific machineries result from the assembly of (i) a drug/proton antiporter, (ii) a periplasmic adaptor protein, and (iii) an outer membrane gated channel. It is now well established that the constitutive expression of the tripartite pump MexAB-OprM provides P. aeruginosa with a relatively high intrinsic resistance to quinolones, \u03b2-lactams (except imipenem), tetracyclines, macrolides, chloramphenicol, trimethoprim, and novobiocin. This protective mechanism is potentiated by the poor permeability of the outer membrane and activity of another pump, MexXY/OprM, whose expression is induced by substrates targeting the ribosome (e.g., tetracyclines, macrolides, aminoglycosides). Accumulating reports indicate that multidrug resistant mutants up-regulating one or both of these systems are quite common in the clinical setting. Such mutants, which are readily selected by sub-optimal treatments with fluoroquinolones, \u03b2-lactams or aminoglycosides, tend to accumulate various resistance mechanisms without loosing the wildtype pathogenicity of P. aeruginosa. Whether the low resistance levels (MIC \u00d7 2- to 8-fold) conferred by efflux may promote second-step mutants with altered drug targets (GyrA, GyrB, ParC) or derepressed AmpC \u03b2-lactamase has not been confirmed in vitro. In the specific context of cystic fibrosis (CF), a recent study from our laboratory showed that the MexXY/OprM pump can be responsible for much higher resistance levels to aminoglycosides (64- to 128-fold). This increased efficacy of the system partially results from adaptive mutations in the mexY gene. In contrast, subpopulations deficient in MexAB-OprM tend to emerge during long-term colonisation of CF airways. While easily selected in vitro on selective media, mutants overexpressing other Mex systems (MexCD-OprJ, MexEF-OprN, MexGHI-OpmD, MexJK/OprM, MexVW/OprM) have been rarely described in CF and non-CF patients. Some data support the notion that up-regulation of MexCD-OprJ or MexEF-OprN might be detrimental to the virulence of P. aeruginosa. In conclusion, therapeutic strategies based on efflux inhibitors should target the MexAB-OprM and the MexXY/OprM systems in priority.",

After close to twenty years of development and operational research, the diagnostic performance of RDTs is now established in all settings. Meta-analyses have clearly demonstrated equivalence of RDTs over expert microscopy to detect parasites, and clear superiority over routine microscopy. Actually, one of the major reasons that have delayed successful implementation of RDT in endemic areas was the use of poor quality microscopy that has impeded reliable measurement of sensitivity and specificity and undermined confidence of health workers in RDTs. Other factors were poor product performance, inadequate methods to determine the quality of products and a lack of emphasis and capacity to deal with these issues. For the potential of RDTs to be realised, it is crucial that high-quality products that perform reliably and accurately under field conditions are made available and that quality insurance is performed on all steps of the procedure. In achieving this goal, the shift from symptom-based diagnosis to parasite-based management of malaria can bring significant improvement for the management of fever in endemic areas.",

            "text": "Anaerobes form a major part of the commensal microbiota in the digestive tract where they constitute an integral component of the function on mucosal surfaces. In the mouth, teeth create a unique, non-shedding environment for bacteria to attach and to form biofilms. There is an age-related succession order of species in bacterial colonisation of the mouth, and once established, individual anaerobic species tend to remain as members of the oral microbiota. The age-related pattern of the colonisation of anaerobic bacteria is partly connected with the development (or loss) of the dentition. Interactions between different bacteria residing in the same microenvironment influence the composition of the microbiota \u2013 or the development of pathologic conditions. Although commensal bacteria are regarded beneficial to the host, some anaerobic members of the oral microbiota contain characteristics potentially detrimental for the health status of an individual. Molecular means of characterisation have resulted in increased knowledge about the \u201cnormal\u201d microbiota of the mouth and in detection of new species and genera as well as phylotypes, which can be associated with infectious situations in the mouth. Oral infections are multifactorial and polymicrobial in nature, and their aetiologic organisms originate mainly from the oral resident microbiota. The involvement of anaerobes is most obvious in infections of root canals, periodontal tissues, and tissues surrounding erupting wisdom teeth where typical anaerobic findings are Gram-negative rods. In addition, Gram-positive anaerobic cocci and non-spore-forming Gram-positive anaerobic rods are common in odontogenic infections. On some occasions, anaerobes of localised dentoalveolar infections can spread to adjacent tissues and even to the bloodstream, resulting in severe complications in extraoral sites. Interestingly, a relatively limited number of anaerobic species are involved in clinically severe infections, however, microbial findings seem to vary depending on geography. Concomitant with the increase in the number of immunosuppressed patients, the number of opportunistic infections caused by commensal anaerobes may increase. Identification to the species level will help to establish associations between individual anaerobic species and specific disease states.",

The role of anaerobes is particularly unclear, often because the type and severity of the infection is poorly defined, recent antibiotic therapy is unknown, and specimen collection and culture techniques are inadequate. When optimal collection, transport, and culture techniques are used, multiple organisms including aerobes and anaerobes are usually recovered from severe DFI. Interactions within these polymicrobial soups lead to production of virulence factors, such as haemolysins, proteases, collagenases, and short chain fatty acids, which promote inflammation, impede healing and contribute to the chronicity of the infection. To better define the bacteriology of diabetic foot infections, we analyzed our data from a large prospective U.S. multicentre trial of patients with moderate to severe infection that required initial parenteral antibiotic therapy and used optimal post-debridement sample collection, transport and culture procedures. Of the 427 culture-positive specimens (of 454 total), only 16.2% were pure cultures while 30.4% yielded 5 or more organisms. A total of 462 anaerobes (range 0\u20139, average 2.3, per specimen) were recovered from 49% of patients, with Gram-positive cocci (GPC) accounting for 45.5% of all anaerobic strains. Finegoldia magna was the predominant species, recovered from 24.4% of patients (99/406) with Prevotella spp. the second most common (12.3% of patients), followed closely by Porphyromonas spp. (10.3%) and the Bacteroides fragilis group (10.2%). B. fragilis was the predominant species (40.4%, 19 of 47) within the group. A greater proportion of anaerobes were cultured from tissue than from \u2018deep swab\u2019 specimens (5.5 vs. 2.1), especially for Porphyromonas spp. (70% vs. 23%), and Prevotella spp. (72% vs. 23%). GPC and B. fragilis group species appeared more evenly distributed among the 4 specimen types. GPC were present in 37.4% of patients, but are often under-reported in studies, possibly because of the selective media used. LKV agar grows B. fragilis group and Prevotella spp, but not Gram-positive anaerobes or Porphyromonas spp., which could explain why many studies find the B. fragilis group to be the predominant anaerobe. Clostridia were present in 4.9% of our patients. If you look closely, the hidden villains are lurking just beneath the inflamed surface and are not so difficult to find.",

In this talk, matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionisation time-of-flight (MALDI-TOF) mass spectrometry will be presented as a method for species identification. This technology applies protein pattern matching based on mass spectrometry. During the identification process, a mass pattern is generated for each organism. The subsequent comparison of this pattern with a database comprising reference patterns derived from well-characterised reference strains leads to species identification. As examples, the identification of various nonfermenting bacterial strains isolated from clinical specimens in comparison to partial 16S rDNA sequencing will be shown. Moreover, speed, accuracy in comparison to other methods, and inter- and intra-laboratory reproducibility of MALDI-TOF MS-based species identification will be discussed.",
