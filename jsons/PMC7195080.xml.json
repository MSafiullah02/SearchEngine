            "text": "In December 2019, a novel coronavirus infection broke out in Wuhan, China [1]. This virus has spread rapidly across the country and is now a global pandemic [2,3]. The virus is named SARS-CoV-2, and the disease caused by the virus is called 2019 novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) [4]. SARS-CoV-2 belongs to lineage B of genus Betacoronavirus [5], shares 96% homology to a bat coronavirus and 79.6% homology to SARS-CoV at the whole genome level [6], but is less similar to the MERS-CoV [7]. By March 2020, COVID-19 caused by SARS-CoV-2 has more than 82,000 cases in China and more than 1,347,000 all around the world [8]. Pneumonia is its main manifestation, although most cases are mild, but 14% of cases present severe symptoms such as dyspnea, reduced blood oxygen saturation, 5% turn to critical with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and shock [2], 1.4\u20134.3% to death [9,10]. However, due to the abruptness of COVID-19, its rapid increase in the number of infected populations has placed a heavy load on local healthcare systems, due especially to the high requirement for intensive care unit (ICU) and invasive ventilation [11]. As a result, the mortality rate at the center of the national epidemic storm tends to be more severe (7.2\u201315%) [1,12]. After the outbreak, the specialties that usually need to be in close contact with patients or to deal with the airway management, such as ophthalmology [13], stomatology [14], anesthesiology [15], have issued relevant infection control and prevention measures for COVID-19. Therefore, this review summarized the experiences in China, the United States, and Brazil, thus providing practical guidance for otolaryngologists under this pandemic.",

Direct contact, airborne and droplet are the most common transmission routes. Although SARS-CoV-2 mainly invades the lower respiratory tract, nasopharynx and oropharynx have been proved to have virus shedding [20,21]. For otolaryngologists, most examinations and treatments require inevitable contact with upper airway mucosa and face to face position, and any reflex coughing or sneezing during procedures will cause a direct contamination to medical staffs. Some aerosol generating procedures such as nasal endoscopy and laryngoscopy will increase virus infectivity and contribute to working environment contamination up to several days [[22], [23], [24]]. Generally, otolaryngology is in a high-risk level during this pandemic. Since nosocomial transmission has been confirmed and more than 3000 health care personnel have been infected in China during the epidemic [10], it is important for otolaryngologic staffs to enhance personal protection against nosocomial infections based on current experience and lessons learned from SARS epidemic [25].",

Otolaryngologists should pay attention to symptoms. Although common discomforts in COVID-19 patients are fever, cough, shortness of breath and sometimes associated with sputum, fatigue, myalgia, some patients also have regular ENT complaints such as sore throat (13.9\u201360%), rhinorrhea (4\u20136%) and nasal obstruction (4.8%) [1,9,12,27], 2.1% has tonsil swelling and 1.7% has throat congestion [9]. In other countries, such as Brazil, the USA and Europe, COVID-19 has also been associated with other changes such as anosmia and dysgeusia [28,29]. These symptoms in an isolated form also constitute criteria for quarantine. Abdominal pain and skin rash have also been reported, and can be confusing symptoms in countries where dengue, chikungunya and measles are already epidemic [30]. Epidemiological contact history in about 7 days is another key to assess a suspicious infection [17]. Early in China's experience, 72.3% patients had had contact with people in the original city, Wuhan, and 31.3% had shown travel history [9]. However, with rapid global widespread and infection increase in communities, not only travel history but also any contact or staying in an enclosed environment with people who have been confirmed or suspected with respiratory illness in the previous 14 days should be noted. In China, many people have been infected while caring for sick family members, thus infections transmission in families cannot be ignored [16].",

If the procedures is likely to have close contact with respiratory droplets or aerosols caused by involuntary coughing, sneezing and deeply breathing, such as throat swabs, endoscopy for nose and larynx, treatment for nasal bleeding and foreign body in pharynx, in our experience more protection should be utilized, including wearing coveralls inside the gown, water-resistant boot covers, face shield outside the goggle (Fig. 1a), aiming to minimize skin exposure. Double-layer gloves are recommended in case of a tearing accident, while the inner layer can provide greater security while putting off the external equipment. Invasive airway procedures such as tracheotomy are at the highest risk and require powered air purifying respirator (PAPR) to provide seamless resistance to aerosols (Fig. 1b).",

            "text": "Tracheotomy is a routine operation to otolaryngologist [42], but it is an invasive open airway surgery with aerosolization [43]. When patients infected by SARS-CoV-2 undergo the procedure, aerosol mixed with secretions and blood will constitute a high risk to medical staffs, therefore it should be decided and performed with caution. During this epidemic, tracheostomy is most likely to be performed to severe or critical patients who have undergone endotracheal intubation and mechanical ventilation because of unsustainable blood oxygen saturation and long ICU stay. Whether tracheotomy is needed and when is the optimal timing are still controversial issues. Some studies suggest that early tracheotomy (usually 5-7 days after intubation), in patients with respiratory failure can reduce ventilation dead space, airway resistance, sedation usage [44], decrease the incidence of sepsis and mechanical ventilation-related pneumonia [45], reduce duration of mechanical ventilation and ICU stay [46], increase the chance of discharge [47,48]. However, other studies show that early tracheotomy is only beneficial for some selected ICU patients [49], especially for traumatized patients [50,51]. Pneumonia and consequent ARDS are the main problems for COVID-19 patients with intubation [52,53]. For pneumonia, several meta-analyses demonstrate that there is insufficient evidence for early tracheotomy to reduce incidence of mechanical ventilation-associated pneumonia [54,55]. For ARDS, early tracheostomy should not be performed or only performed to limited patients according to some clinical guidelines [56,57]. Once ventilation for more than 2 weeks, the mortality and disability will eventually increase with or without tracheotomy [58]. Therefore, tracheotomy should be evaluated carefully in intubated COVID-19 patients and only be performed with exact benefit expectation. Patients with apparent intolerance to transoral intubation or high muscle load due to increased airway resistance maybe an appropriate indication [59].",
