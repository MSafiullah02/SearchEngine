One is alignment-based methods, in which dynamic programming is used to find an optimal alignment by assigning scores to different possible alignments and picking the alignment with the highest score. Several alignment-based algorithms have been proposed such as global alignment, local alignment, with or without overlap (Gotoh, 1982, Needleman and Wunsch, 1970, Smith and Waterman, 1981, Randic et al., 2011, Randic et al., 2013). Waterman (Waterman, 1995) and Durbin et al. (Durbin et al., 1998) provided comprehensive reviews about this method. However, the search for optimal solutions using sequence alignment has problems in: (i) computationally load with large biological databases and (ii) choice of the scoring schemes (Pham and Zuegg, 2004, Vinga and Almeida, 2003). Therefore, the emergence of research into the second class, alignment-free methods, is apparent and necessary to overcome critical limitations of alignment-based methods.",

One of the most widely used alignment-free approaches is statistical model, in which each sequence is first mapped into an m-dimensional vector according to its k-word frequencies, and sequence similarity can then be measured by distance measures, such as Euclidean distance (Blaisdell, 1986), Pearson's correlation coefficient (Fichant and Gautier, 1987), Kullback\u2013Leibler discrepancy (Wu et al., 2001), Cosine distance (Stuart et al., 2002) among their corresponding vectors. Recently, Ewens and Grant (2005) studied probabilistic properties of words in sequences, deducted the exact distributions and evaluated its asymptotic approximations. When the k-words occurring in biological sequence are estimative probabilities rather than frequencies, they are more easily described by more complex models such as Markov model (Pham and Zuegg, 2004, Hao and Qi, 2004, Wu et al., 2001, Apostolico and Denas, 2008), mixed model (Kantorovitz et al., 2007) and Bernoulli model (Lu et al., 2008).",

It provides a simple way to view, sort and compare various gene sequences with their intuitive pictures and pattern. Randic et al. gave a comprehensive review on these methods (Randic, 2013b, Randic et al., 2003). In order to facilitate comparison of different biological sequences, they transformed graphical representations into some mathematical objects such as E matrix (Yao and Wang, 2004, Liao and Wang, 2004, Song and Tang, 2005), D/D matrix(Li and Wang, 2003, Yao and Wang, 2004, Liao and Wang, 2004, Song and Tang, 2005), L/L matrix (Randic, 2013a, Li and Wang, 2003, Yao and Wang, 2004, Liao and Wang, 2004, Song and Tang, 2005) and their \u201chigh order\u201d matrices (Yao and Wang, 2004, Song and Tang, 2005). Once a matrix was given, they calculated matrix invariants as descriptors of the sequence, such as the average matrix element, the average row sum, the leading eigen value and the Wiener number. But, for long sequences, these methods become less useful because they require complex repetitive computation to get matrix invariants.",

Because it is based on exact direct repeats, the LZ complexity works well with the small DNA alphabet. Unlike DNA sequences, protein sequences and RNA secondary structures consist of more complex alphabets and structure information, which poses more of a challenge for LZ complexity. So Bacha and Baurain, Liu and Wang, Chen and Zhang presented several strategies in which protein sequences or RNA secondary structures were encoded to a new alphabet prior to computation of the LZ complexity (Bacha and Baurain, 2005, Liu and Wang, 2006, Zhang and Chen, 2010, Zhang and Wang, 2010, Chen and Zhang, 2012). Zhang et al. found that the LZ complexity is strongly correlated with sequence length and proposed a normalized LZ complexity for sequence comparison (Zhang et al., 2009). Taking into account a specific kind of the inexact copy in the text, Li et al. generalized the LZ complexity and proposed a new sequence distance measure for sequence comparison (Li et al., 2010). Liu et al. introduced relative LZ complexity to depict the complexity relationship between two sequences (Liu et al., 2012).",

            "text": "This work presented a novel method to compare biological sequence with the revised Lempel\u2013Ziv complexity. Instead of focusing on the total number of components in the exhaustive history, we analyzed the distribution of components themselves. Then we defined transition and extension operations among the revised LZ-word sets and represented them in the operation figure. With the length of operations in mind, we designed an operation measure to estimate the similarity/dissimilarity of two biological sequences. To assess the effectiveness of the proposed method, two sets of evaluation experiments were taken, and its performance was further compared with alignment-based methods. The results demonstrate that the proposed method is efficient, which highlight the necessity for LZ-based method to consider the whole distribution of the components in the exhaustive history. Thus, this understanding can then be used to guide development of more powerful alignment-free for biological sequence comparison.",
