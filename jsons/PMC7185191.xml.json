            "text": "Menkes disease is a rare X-linked recessive disorder of copper transport that is usually fatal in the first few years of life. The link between the disease and copper metabolism was first made by Danks et al. (1), who noted that the brittle hair and the neurological features in Menkes disease are remarkably similar to the effects of copper deprivation seen in sheep raised on copper-deficient soil. Most of the phenotypic features of the disease can be understood as malfunctioning of several copperdependent enzymes caused by a general copper deficiency. The molecular basis of this deficiency has long been proposed to be a copper transport problem. Accumulation (2) and decreased export (3) of copper in cultured fibroblasts from patients with Menkes disease are in agreement with a hypothetical transport defect. The characteristics of the cloned Menkes disease gene (4\u20136) further supported this hypothesis. Analysis of the MNK cDNA sequence revealed the characteristic features of a P-type ATPase. The members of this family of ion-motive ATPases generally translocate positively charged ions across plasma or intracellular membranes in a cycle involving ATP hydrolysis coupled to phosphorylation of a highly conserved aspartic acid residue (7). Other features of MNK include six putative metal-binding domains, and a CPC (Cys-Pro-Cys) motif in a hydrophobic (transmembrane) domain thought to be involved in the translocation of the metal ion. Both these elements are present specifically in the subfamily of heavy metal-transporting P-type ATPases, several members of which have been described in bacteria and shown to play a role in heavy metal transport (8).",

            "text": "In mammals, the closest known family member of the Menkes disease gene is the Wilson disease gene (ATP7B; WND) which is expressed predominantly in the liver (9,10). WND is necessary for biliary excretion of copper and incorporation into ceruloplasmin (CP). Both these functions are impaired in Wilson's disease, leading to accumulation of copper in the liver and other tissues. The cellular localization of both the MNK and WND proteins is unknown. Recently a homolog of MNK and WND was cloned in Saccharomyces cerevisiae (11). This yeast gene, CCC2, encodes a P-type ATPase that is proposed to function in the subcellular transport of copper to a yeast ferroxidase, Fet3p (12). Fet3p has homology to human ceruloplasmin and, like CP, its function is dependent on proper cellular copper distribution and incorporation (13). The parallel between the yeast and mammalian systems, together with the sequence homology shared by MNK, WND and Ccc2p suggest that these three copper P-type ATPases may function similarly on the cellular level. The exact nature of their roles in cellular copper trafficking, however, remains unknown.",

To analyze the specificity of the antibodies, we performed Western blot analysis on cell lysates from different cell lines. In normal human fibroblasts (Fig. 1, lane 3, large arrow), a band of the expected size (\u223c165 kDa) was present, while fibroblasts from a patient with no detectable MNK RNA (4,6) showed no signal (Fig. 1, lane 2). The antibodies did not detect a protein in liver-derived Hep3B cells (Fig. 1, lane 4). These results demonstrate that the polyclonal antibodies are indeed specific to MNK and do not cross-react with WND. MNK and WND expression in the Hep3B cells was also examined by Northern analysis. While WND RNA was abundantly present, MNK RNA was barely detectable (data not shown). The difference between the Western and Northern data in the liver cells is likely to be due to a lower sensitivity of our Western blot analysis. Lane 5 of Figure 1 shows a band in CHO cells in the same size range as in the human fibroblasts, demonstrating that the antibodies can be used in cross-species detection of MNK. A similar Western blot result was previously shown by Camakaris et al. (15) with antibodies that were also generated against the metal-binding domains of human MNK. These results are not surprising since the hamster cDNA is almost 90% identical to the human MNK cDNA (15), while the human WND cDNA is <60% identical to MNK (9,10). Faint larger bands can be seen in the human fibroblasts as well as the CHO cells, and represent non-specific signals due to binding to over-abundant high molecular weight proteins as analyzed by amido black staining of the membranes after Western analysis. Pre-adsorption of the antibodies with the MNK fusion protein did not have an effect on these non-specific bands, while the band representing the Menkes protein was eliminated completely (data not shown).",

Because this band is present in both normal cells and cells from a patient with no MNK RNA, it cannot be a processed form of MNK. One explanation could be that the smaller band represents a protein with significant homology to the Menkes metal-binding region. This homology would have to be higher than the homology with WND which is not recognized by our antibody preparation. Alternatively, this band could represent an artifact caused by non-specific antibody reaction in the fibroblast lysates. However, in the above-mentioned competition experiment, in which the antibodies were pre-adsorbed with the MNK fusion protein, both the MNK signal and the smaller 35 kDa signal disappeared (data not shown), suggesting homology of this smaller protein to MNK. Further investigations will be necessary to clarify the nature of this signal.",

No staining was observed in cells treated with pre-immune serum (Fig. 2A). To confirm the Golgi localization, we compared the staining pattern with that of a known Golgi resident enzyme, \u03b1-mannosidase II (Man II). Panel C in Figure 2 shows staining with a 1/2000 dilution of polyclonal anti-Man II antibodies. The pattern is very similar to that of MNK (Fig. 2A), albeit more intense, reflecting the difference in expression of the two genes. Because the Golgi staining of MNK could reflect the transient passage of MNK through this cellular compartment, we blocked protein synthesis with cycloheximide (10 \u00b5g/ml) and observed no difference in the localization (data not shown).",

            "text": "The Golgi complex is made up of three functionally different subcompartments, the cis-Golgi network (CGN), the Golgi stack (or medial Golgi) and the trans-Golgi network (TGN) (16). The fungal macrocyclic lactone, brefeldin A (BFA), is known to affect these compartments differently and can be used to identify the sublocalization of proteins within the Golgi complex (17,18). We investigated the effects of BFA on the localization of MNK in comparison with Man II, which is known to localize predominantly to the medial cisternae of the Golgi stack in CHO cells based on electron microscopy data (14). The panels on the left (A-E) in Figure 4 show staining for MNK in CHO cells exposed to BFA for 0, 5, 10 and 30, and for 30 min followed by a 1 h recovery in BFA-free medium. The panels on the right (a-e) in Figure 4 show staining for Man II in CHO cells under the same treatment conditions. After 2 min of BFA treatment (not shown), the MNK perinuclear signal was essentially the same as before treatment (Fig. 4A). After 5 min (Fig. 4B), the signal started to show slightly less perinuclear capping. After 10 min (Fig. 4C), a more diffuse signal throughout the cytoplasm was visible with a strong circular staining next to the nucleus. BFA treatment for 30 min (Fig. 4D) stabilized this juxtanuclear staining. These BFA-induced changes are characteristic for proteins that reside in the TGN (17,19). The TGN is functionally connected to the cellular network of microtubuli that originates in the microtubule organizing center (MTOC). BFA treatment causes the TGN to collapse around the MTOC and this is responsible for the juxtanuclear signal described above. In contrast to these BFA effects on MNK localization, the Man II signal is affected very differently by BFA. Fluorescence starts to diffuse in the cytoplasm in a reticular pattern as early as 2 min after BFA induction (not shown). Upon longer exposures to BFA, the perinuclear cap seen in untreated cells completely disappears and the reticular cytoplasmic pattern that emerges after 2 min of BFA treatment becomes stronger (Fig. 4b-d). This pattern of BFA-induced endoplasmic reticulum redistribution of Man II has been reported previously (20) and is consistent with its localization to the medial cisternae of the Golgi stack in CHO cells. Recovery of the cells in BFA-free medium for 1 h resulted in nearly complete restoration of the normal signal in both anti-MNK (Fig. 4E) and anti-Man II (Fig. 4e) stained cells.",

Inhibition of protein synthesis with cycloheximide does not influence the Golgi localization of MNK, indicating that the Menkes protein does not just transiently pass through this subcellular compartment.

It is also clear that MNK plays a role in copper efflux from the cell, based on the reduced efflux kinetics seen in cells from patients with Menkes disease (3) and the increased efflux kinetics in CHO cells overexpressing the MNK protein (15). The TGN is known to play a dynamic role in cellular protein trafficking and is involved in the transport to and from both the plasma membrane and the lysosomal compartment (22,23).

            "text": "MNK localization to the TGN is presumably directed by one or more as yet unidentified targeting signals within the MNK protein. For several proteins, a variety of targeting signals in cytoplasmic and transmembrane domains have been shown to be essential for Golgi retention (24,25), lysosomal targeting (26,27) and Golgi retrieval (28). Modification of these signals by directed mutagenesis has been shown to alter the cellular localization of such proteins significantly (28\u201331). Some proteins, such as furin (30) and TGN38 (28), are known to recycle from the plasma membrane to the TGN, based on the presence of an internalization or retrieval signal within their amino acid sequence (32,33). The involvement of MNK in copper efflux could be explained by targeting from the TGN to the plasma membrane, followed by return to the intracellular compartment through endocytosis, mediated by clathrin-coated vesicles, and based on the presence of a putative retrieval signal in MNK, as suggested by the data of Petris et al. (21). Alternatively, MNK could function directly in copper efflux due to specific targeting of the different MNK isoforms. We and others have shown previously that there is low level alternative splicing in the transmembrane region of the MNK cDNA removing either transmembrane domains three and four, or five and/or six (34,35 and H.A.D., unpublished data). Petruhkin et al. (36) showed that the same regions in the WND cDNA are also alternatively spliced. It is possible that skipping of the transmembrane domains could remove targeting signals necessary for MNK to localize to the TGN, and allowing these MNK isoforms to target to different cellular regions including the plasma membrane and the subcellular organelles. The low levels of the minor isoforms would make it difficult to visualize this phenomenon by indirect immunofluorescence. Studies using constructs of the different MNK isoforms will be necessary to prove this hypothesis. As an alternative to functioning directly in copper export, MNK could be involved indirectly in the efflux process. In this scenario, MNK would transport copper into the TGN vesicles, where it might be incorporated into another protein or small peptide which could leave the cell through the secretory pathway.",

            "text": "The Wilson disease gene product, WND (ATP7B), has a similar dual role in hepatocyte copper homeostasis. Decreased copper excretion into the bile in Wilson disease points to a role for WND in copper efflux from the hepatocyte, while decreased incorporation of copper into CP also suggests a role in subcellular transport. Recently, Dijkstra et al. (37) identified an active copper transport system in the plasma membrane of hepatocytes that they proposed represents the Wilson copper transporter. If the identity of this transport system is confirmed to be WND, this would prove a plasma membrane localization. These authors also presented the possibility that the observed copper transport activity could be due, at least in part, to contamination of the plasma membrane preparations with subcellular organelles. Subcellular localization of WND is therefore not excluded. Given the known similarities between MNK and WND, and considering the data presented here on MNK localization, it seems reasonable to predict that WND will have a similar localization pattern to MNK. Because of its high expression levels in comparison with MNK, localization studies for the Wilson gene product may reveal directly how WND functions in the efflux process. In yeast, a homolog of MNK and WND was cloned recently (11), and is proposed to have a subcellular localization. This yeast copper P-type ATPase, Ccc2p, was shown to provide copper to a yeast ferroxidase, Fet3p (12), that has homology to human CP and, like CP, is dependent on proper copper distribution and incorporation to form the mature ferroxidase. This process of copper-induced maturation of the yeast CP homolog occurs in a post-Golgi compartment (38). There is at present no evidence for a role of Ccc2p in copper efflux. A dynamic interaction between subcellular transport and efflux of copper in yeast based on Ccc2p, as suggested here for MNK and WND, therefore awaits further study.",

This localization is consistent with the proposed role of MNK in intracellular transport of copper for subsequent incorporation into the different cupro-enzymes. Based on the dynamic role of the TGN in cellular protein trafficking, it also helps to understand the role of MNK in copper efflux from the cell, either assuming that MNK participates directly in the dynamic interaction between the intracellular compartment and the plasma membrane, or indirectly through a mediating protein that leaves the cell through the secretory pathway.",

The upstream primer (5\u2032-TGGGTGTGAATTCTGTTACCA-3\u2032) contained the EcoRI site at position 166, while the downstream primer (5\u2032-GGAAGCTTAATTCTTTCCTTCCTCCTTGTC-3\u2032) was engineered with a HindIII restriction site generating an in-frame stop codon. The fragment was directionally cloned downstream of and in-frame to the six histidine residues in the pTRCHisC vector (Invitrogen), and verified by sequence analysis. An amino-terminal histidine-tagged MNK truncated protein of the expected size (57 kDa) was generated in Escherichia coli and purified on a nickel resin column according to the manufacturer's protocol (Invitrogen). Initial immunization of New Zealand white rabbits was performed using 1 mg of the purified fusion protein in 1 ml of Freund's complete adjuvant. Subsequent immunizations were performed with Freund's incomplete adjuvant at monthly intervals, and rabbits were bled 7\u201310 days after each immunization.",
