Owing to lack of improvement, she presented to the emergency room and was found to be hypoxic. Computed tomography showed widespread ground-glass opacities as well as honeycombing of the right lung (Figure 1). COVID-19 was suspected and testing was eventually positive. Within 48 hours she developed profound respiratory failure and required intubation. She also required adrenergic support with norepinephrine. She was started on intravenous azithromycin on March 18. The decision was made to start hydroxychloroquine on March 21; however, it was stopped after 1 dose owing to a QTc of 620 ms with a notched broad T wave (Figure 2A). No ventricular ectopy was present. Serum potassium and magnesium were 4.4 mM and 2.9 mg/dL, respectively. Electrophysiology consultation recommended 100 mg intravenous lidocaine followed by a repeat 12-lead electrocardiogram. This revealed a shortening of the QTc to 550 ms (Figure 2B). It was recommended to restart hydroxychloroquine and begin a lidocaine infusion. The patient was able to complete the course of hydroxychloroquine without an arrhythmic event. Despite receiving a full course of hydroxychloroquine, she remained ventilator dependent and died owing to progressive metabolic acidosis and multiorgan system failure on March 25. By the time hydroxychloroquine was first initiated, she had already been intubated for 72 hours and was in severe respiratory failure. Owing to several similar consults in COVID-19 patients with borderline or increased QTc intervals, we developed a flow chart that addresses QT interval management in order to help clinicians taking care of COVID-19 patients who require chloroquine or hydroxychloroquine with or without azithromycin (Figure 3).",

            "text": "Certainly, the use of combination therapy with azithromycin and chloroquine or hydroxychloroquine in patients with congenital or acquired LQTS must be carefully weighed against the risks. The use of late sodium channel\u2013blocking drugs like lidocaine or mexiletine and careful attention to serum electrolytes, heart rate, and monitoring of QTc intervals may allow administration of a full course of these drugs, even in patients with a prolonged QT interval. Further data will be required to determine if this approach can be safely applied to the majority of COVID-19 patients in need of such therapy.Key Teaching Points\u2022The combination of azithromycin and chloroquine/hydroxychloroquine has been shown in a small number of COVID-19 patients to have effective virucidal potency.\u2022Concerns of QT prolongation and increased risks of torsades de pointes (TdP) with this combination have been raised, since each agent can individually prolong the QT interval, and patients with QT prolongation were excluded from receiving this therapy.\u2022Combination therapy with azithromycin and chloroquine has previously been found to be safe in the treatment of resistant malaria, without reports of syncope or TdP.\u2022The addition of lidocaine or mexiletine may allow this type of combination therapy even in patients who have a prolonged QT interval.\u2022We developed and provided a flow chart to manage the risk of QT prolongation and TdP while treating these patients in the hospital with combination therapy.",
