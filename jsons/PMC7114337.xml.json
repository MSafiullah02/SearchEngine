            "text": "It is well established that the renin\u2013angiotensin system (RAS) is an essential multi-organ endocrine system necessary for homeostatic regulation of blood volume and electrolyte balance, efforts which ultimately contribute to cardiovascular maintenance at tissue and organism levels [1]. Dysregulation of the renin\u2013angiotensin system (RAS) causes several pathophysiological states of which hypertension is most prevalent. The octapeptide angiotensin II (Ang II) exerts its classical effects on mean arterial blood pressure primarily through the AT1 receptor [2]. These include direct vasoconstriction, release of aldosterone from the adrenal cortex, and centrally-mediated blood-pressure regulation [3], [4]. Additional effects of Ang II and the des Asp1 heptapeptide Ang III mediated through activation of AT1 receptors in the central nervous system (CNS) include dipsogenesis, secretion of vasopressin, and changes in reproductive hormone secretion [5], [6]. The brain RAS plays a major role in blood pressure regulation, but there are many aspects of this system that are not yet fully understood [7], [8].",

The binding was considerably greater than that observed for AT1 and AT2 receptors in the rat brain, and was abundant throughout the cerebral cortex, a region where there is little AT1 or AT2 binding. Subsequently, autoradiographic analysis of this binding in the rat brain revealed that this novel binding site, which shows high affinity for Ang III as well as Ang II, but considerably lower affinity for other angiotensin fragments, is widespread [14].",

However, in the majority of the assays of the testis (8 of 12 assays) in the absence of 0.3 mM PCMB, binding did not differ from zero. And, when measurable binding was detectable (579 \u00b1 163 fmol/mg protein 4 of 12 assays), the binding affinity was considerably lower (K\nD\n = 14.8 \u00b1 1.8 nM) than in the presence of PCMB. In the pancreas 6 of the 11 assays were significantly greater than zero (106 \u00b1 49.9 fmol/mg protein) in the absence of PCMB and showed high affinity (K\nD\n = 4.06 \u00b1 0.30 nM) similar to that seen with PCMB, although the SEM, for the B\nmax was nearly 50%. This indicates that under the in vitro conditions of this assay, the binding site in the pancreas may occur in a conformation capable of binding Ang II and Ang III.",

Although previously described as brain-specific, binding assays in tissues not generally considered to be part of the classical RAS had not been done. Herein we report a broader examination of the tissue distribution of this novel binding site in 8 mouse tissues. This novel Ang II/Ang III binding site, which is unmasked by 0.3 mM PCMB in the brain, is also present in the testis, spleen, pancreas, epididymis, and lung, but was not reliably detectable in the heart, seminal vesicles and skeletal muscle. The presence of this novel Ang II/Ang III binding protein in tissues other than the brain suggests that it may mediate or regulate the effects of these angiotensins in these tissues. While the tissues in which this novel Ang II/Ang III binding site are not generally associated with the RAS, there is data to indicate that these tissues have local RAS's [1], [20], [21] and may also be responsive to systemically generated circulating angiotensins.",

Renin and angiotensinogen mRNA are present in mouse testis [23]. In rat however, renin mRNA is readily detectable but angiotensinogen mRNA could only be detected with a high sensitivity assay [23], [24], [25]. Within the rat and mouse testes, renin and renin-like-ir is present in Leydig cells [22], [26], [27], [28]. The testicular angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) variant [22], [29], [30] and Ang II receptors (predominantly AT1) are also found in Leydig cells [31], [32], [33], [34]. It has been proposed that Ang II functions in a negative feedback loop wherein LH stimulated Ang II production [35], [36] leads to inhibition of LH stimulated testosterone production [32]. Angiotensin II is not the only RAS component ascribed with functionality in the testicular RAS. Recent studies have established that Ang (1\u20137) activation of the Mas receptor is necessary for spermatogenesis in mice and rats [37] and that testicular ACE is necessary for capacitation and subsequent fertilization [38], [39], [40], [41], [42]. Thus, this novel Ang II/Ang III binding site could participate in Ang II-regulated male reproductive functions. See also reviews [1], [43], [44].",

While expression of renin and angiotensinogen in the spleen is low [24], [45], [46], the spleen is reported to have a complete RAS, see reviews [1], [20]. High levels of Ang II receptor binding have been found in the red pulp of the spleen [47]. These receptors are of the AT1 subtype [48]. Splenic AT1 receptors might participate in regulation of splenic volume and blood flow [47], [49] or in regulation of lymphocyte function via AT1 receptor activation of cytotoxic T lymphocytes [50], [51]. Ang II stimulates proliferation of lymphocytes in the mouse spleen reportedly via stimulation of both AT1 and AT2 receptors [52]. See also reviews [1], [20]. The density of AT1 receptors in the rat spleen reported by Castren et al., [47] 81.6 fmol/mg protein, is very similar to the density of the novel Ang II/Ang III binding site, 72.9 fmol/mg protein. It remains to be determined if the novel Ang II/Ang III binding site is expressed on red or white pulp of the spleen. Thus its potential functional significance in the spleen remains uncertain.",

Ang II-like immunoreactivity was not detected in islet cells. The density of Ang II receptors in the canine pancreas was relatively low, 15.8 fmol/mg protein [57] and is predominantly made up of the AT2 subtype [59]. In the rat pancreas Ang II receptors were also reported to have a low (15 fmol/mg protein) density, but were observed on islet cell membranes as well as on the exocrine pancreas [60]. This is about \u00bc the density of the novel Ang II/Ang III binding site in the mouse pancreas.

There is evidence supporting a role for both systemic and pancreatic islet RASs in regulation of islet blood flow and insulin biosynthesis [62]. The use of angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs) and ACE inhibitors appears to attenuate or prevent RAS-mediated inflammatory responses, apoptosis, fibrosis, and superoxide anion production in islet cells [63]. A less classical role of the RAS has also been noted: acute diabetes seen in some SARS patients is mediated by ACE2 which functions as a receptor for the SARS coronavirus [64]. See also reviews: [1], [56], [65]. In view of the continuing ambiguities regarding the functionality of the pancreatic RAS and the effects of systemically generated circulating angiotensins on the pancreas, it remains to be determined how the novel Ang II/Ang III binding protein would affect the actions of angiotensins on the pancreas.",

The vasculature of the lung contains a rich supply of ACE [66], [67] making the lung the most integral tissue for the systemic production of Ang II. Renin and angiotensinogen mRNA have been observed in low levels in the rat lung [24], [46], [68]. The predominant Ang II receptor subtype in the lung is AT1 and was initially reported to have a density of 704 \u00b1 60 fmol/mg protein and K\nD of 2.8 \u00b1 0.9 nM [69]. However, a subsequent study showed a much lower density of 128.4 \u00b1 15.7 fmol/mg protein and a K\nD of 0.63 \u00b1 0.05 nM [70]. The novel Ang II/Ang III binding site shows a density below both of those reported for the AT1, (B\nmax\n = 56.9 \u00b1 7.6 fmole/mg protein). Ang II has several functions in the lung including induction of microvascular permeability and subsequent pulmonary edema [71], pulmonary vasoconstriction [72], fibroblast proliferation mediated by AT1 receptors [73], and AT1 mediated apoptosis of alveolar epithelial cells in vitro [74]. A recent study showed that renin released by mast cell degranulation, possibly in concert with concurrent chymase release [75], leads to local generation of Ang II which then promotes bronchoconstriction via the AT1 receptor on bronchial smooth muscle cells [76]. This study highlights the interplay between different tissue types in the functional use of angiotensin II as a paracrine hormone. The novel Ang II/Ang III binding site may mediate more typical actions of angiotensins II and III, or it may participate in novel and complex regulatory pathways in the lung, see also reviews [77], [78].",

The undetectability of the novel Ang II/Ang III binding site in heart was surprising given the preponderance of evidence which attributes a significant direct role of Ang II on cardiac function and pathophysiology, see review [20]. Cardiac tissue has been shown to express ACE, as well as AT1 and AT2 receptors, however expression of angiotensinogen, and renin are still uncertain [20], [44]. In contrast, increased expression of ACE2 has been noted following myocardial infarction, heart failure, and treatment with ACE inhibitors or ARBs [44]. It has been proposed that locally produced Ang II is not responsible for ventricular hypertrophy but may have a significant role in fibrosis induction [21].",

It should be further noted that in the current binding study the cellular fraction used included total cellular membranes, not solely plasma membrane. To address the possibility that this novel Ang II/Ang III binding protein is membrane associated rather than an integral membrane protein, the concentration of NaCl in the assay buffer was increased to 400 mM so as to dissociate membrane-associated proteins from the membranes. Specific binding of 125I-SI Ang II remained constant between control and high-salt treated membranes, suggesting that the novel Ang II/Ang III binding site protein is not a membrane-associated protein, and is instead embedded within the plasma membrane. The cellular localization of this novel binding site as an integral protein of the plasma membrane ascribes it several possible roles: in signaling (as a receptor), as a transporter (to internalize these angiotensins into cells), or as a peptidase that could function as a highly specific angiotensinase that modulates the availability of Ang II and Ang III [13], [15].",

The criteria for inclusion included: tissue distribution in adult mice (present in testis and brain, the tissues with the highest observed binding; see Table 1), cellular localization (plasma membrane integral protein), protein size (approx. 80 kDa) and absence of glycosylation sites [79]. The search returned eight proteins of interest: Cldn 17, Emp1, Fbox2, Maged1, Mmp24, Rxfp2, Septin 3, and St8sia3. These candidate proteins were then arbitrarily scored to determine which best fit the criteria set described above.

Additional correlates between angiotensins and metalloproteinases include ACE/ACE2 and IRAP (AT4 receptor; EC 3.4.11.3) [84], see also reviews [3], [85]. The functions of several brain metalloproteinases have been correlated to pathological sequelae in neuroinflammatory events and to beneficial roles in angio- and neurogenesis [86]. These pathological consequences of metalloproteinase activation are most directly a result of increased blood-brain barrier permeability but also include extracellular matrix (ECM) regulation in Alzheimer's and Parkinson's disease. If the novel Ang II/III binding site is interacting with a metalloproteinase it suggests that there could be other substrates besides Ang II and Ang III whose functionality is affected by this binding site. Future studies, directed at sequence identification of the novel Ang II/Ang III binding protein and characterization of its physiological functions and possible involvement in pathophysiological processes will be needed.",
