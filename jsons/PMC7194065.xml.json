The epicenter of the subsequent SARS-CoV-2 spread was Wuhan, Hubei province, China, with more than 65,000 cases occurring in this area (WHO, 2020a). However, infections have now been detected in more than 110 countries and massive outbreaks are currently ongoing in the United States, Italy, and Spain (WHO, 2020a, WHO, 2020b). Understanding which features of SARS-CoV-2 are essential for infection of human cells should provide insights into viral transmissibility and pathogenesis and might reveal targets for intervention.",

For this, the surface unit S1 binds to a cellular receptor while the transmembrane unit S2 facilitates fusion of the viral membrane with a cellular membrane (Hoffmann et al., 2018, Hulswit et al., 2016, Millet and Whittaker, 2018). Membrane fusion depends on S protein cleavage by host cell proteases at the S1/S2 and the S2\u2032 site (Figure 1\nA), which results in S protein activation (Hoffmann et al., 2018, Hulswit et al., 2016, Millet and Whittaker, 2018). Cleavage of the S protein can occur in the constitutive secretory pathway of infected cells or during viral entry into target cells and is essential for viral infectivity. Therefore, the responsible enzymes constitute potential targets for antiviral intervention.",

However, it is conceivable that the activity of other cellular proteases is also necessary. Thus, the Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus spike protein (MERS-S) is activated by a two-step process: MERS-S is first cleaved by furin at the S1/S2 site in infected cells, which is required for subsequent TMPRSS2-mediated cleavage at the S2\u2032 site (Figure 1A) during viral entry into lung cells (Kleine-Weber et al., 2018, Park et al., 2016, Millet and Whittaker, 2014). A cathepsin B/L-dependent auxiliary activation pathway is operative in many TMPRSS2\u2212 cell lines but seems not to be available in viral target cells in the lung because TMPRSS2-dependent activation of the S protein is essential for robust MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV spread and pathogenesis in the infected host (Iwata-Yoshikawa et al., 2019, Simmons et al., 2005, Zhou et al., 2015).",

Immunoblot of VSV particles bearing S proteins with a C-terminal antigenic tag revealed that all S proteins were readily incorporated into VSV particles. SARS-2-S WT (wild type) was efficiently cleaved at the S1/S2 site (Figure 2B), in keeping with published data (Hoffmann et al., 2020, Walls et al., 2020). Exchange of the S1/S2 site of SARS-2-S against those of SARS-S and RaTG13-S abrogated cleavage, and this effect was also seen when the multibasic motif was deleted (Figure 2B). Moreover, insertion of an additional arginine residue jointly with an alanine-to-lysine exchange at the S1/S2 site did not appreciably increase cleavability. Finally, insertion of the S1/S2 site of SARS-2-S into SARS-S increased S protein cleavability while insertion of the RaTG13 S1/S2 site did not (Figure 2B). These results indicate that the presence of several arginine residues at the S1/S2 site is required for efficient SARS-2-S proteolytic processing in human cells and also confers high cleavability to SARS-S.",

            "text": "We next investigated which protease is required for S protein processing at the S1/S2 site. The S1/S2 motif matches the minimal furin sequence RXXR and is closely related to the furin consensus sequence RX[K/R]R. Therefore, we analyzed whether decanoyl-RVKR-CMK, a furin inhibitor, blocks SARS-2-S processing at the S1/S2 site. Decanoyl-RVKR-CMK inhibited processing of MERS-S, which is known to depend on furin (Gierer et al., 2015, Millet and Whittaker, 2014), in a concentration-dependent manner and had no effect on SARS-S expression (Figure 2C), as expected. Processing of SARS-2-S was also inhibited, indicating that furin cleaves SARS-2-S at the S1/S2 site. In order to determine whether cleavage at the S1/S2 site is required for SARS-2-S-driven cell-cell fusion, we studied S-protein-dependent formation of multinucleated giant cells (syncytia). No syncytia were observed in the absence of S protein expression while MERS-S WT expression resulted in syncytium formation, which was increased upon addition of trypsin or expression of TMPRSS2 (Figure 2D). Expression of SARS-S WT or SARS-S harboring the S1/S2 site of RaTG13-S did not induce syncytium formation in the absence of protease, but modest multikaryon formation was detected in the presence of trypsin or TMPRSS2. In contrast, SARS-S harboring the SARS-2-S S1/S2 site induced syncytia in the absence of protease, and syncytium formation was markedly increased by trypsin and, particularly, TMPRSS2. SARS-2-S expression triggered syncytium formation that was strongly increased by trypsin and TMPRSS2. Syncytium formation was clearly less prominent and required the presence of trypsin or TMPRSS2 when the SARS-2-S S1/S2 site was replaced by that of SARS-S or RaTG13-S. Moreover, deletion of the multibasic motif resulted in a spike protein that was no longer able to induce syncytium formation even in the presence of trypsin or TMPRSS2. Finally, the addition of an arginine residue to the S1/S2 site of SARS-2-S jointly with alanine-to-lysine exchange strongly increased syncytium formation, indicating that viral variants with optimized S1/S2 sites might show augmented cell-cell spread and potentially altered pathogenicity. Thus, the S1/S2 site of SARS-2-S is required for cell-cell fusion, and this process can be augmented by adding basic residues to the S1/S2 site.",

Blockade of SARS-2-S cleavage at the S1/S2 site (mutants SARS-2-S (SARS), SARS-2-S (RaTG), and SARS-2-S (delta)) abrogated entry into the TMPRSS2+ human lung cell line Calu-3 (Figure 2E), in which the cathepsin B/L-dependent S protein activation pathway is not sufficiently available (Park et al., 2016). In contrast, entry into TMPRSS2\u2212 Vero cells, which is known to be cathepsin B/L dependent, was not affected by these mutations (Figure 1E), in keeping with results reported by Walls and colleagues (Walls et al., 2020). Optimization of the S1/S2 site did not increase entry into the cell lines tested; it slightly decreased entry into both Vero and Calu-3 cells, for, at present, unclear reasons. Finally, alterations of the S1/S2 site of SARS-S did not augment entry efficiency. Collectively, these results demonstrate that a multibasic S1/S2 site is essential for SARS-2-S-driven entry into human lung cells while a monobasic site is sufficient for SARS-S.",

Finally, we constructed SARS-2-S variants in which either the multibasic motif was deleted, SARS-2-S (delta), or in which the proline residue preceding the multibasic motif was mutated to arginine and the alanine residue within the minimal furin motif was changed to lysine in order to increase the basic environment at the S1/S2 site, SARS-2-S (opt). All newly cloned spike protein constructs further contained a deletion of 18 amino acids at their respective C terminus as this has been shown to improve coronavirus spike protein incorporation into VSV particles and thus transduction (Schwegmann-We\u00dfels et al., 2009). Further, for each construct an untagged variant as well as a version containing a C-terminal V5 epitope tag was constructed.",

(B) Analysis of furin-mediated S protein priming. Rhabdoviral particles harboring the indicated S proteins containing a C-terminal V5 tag for detection were lysed and subjected to western blot analysis. Detection of vesicular stomatitis virus matrix protein (VSV-M) served as control. (C) Rhabdoviral particles bearing MERS-S, SARS-S, or SARS-2-S equipped with a V5 or HA epitope tag at their C terminus (or no glycoprotein at all, control) were produced in the absence or presence of furin inhibitor (FI, decanoyl-RVKR-CMK; 1 \u03bcM or 10 \u03bcM) and analyzed for S protein processing by western blot analysis. Detection of VSV-M served as control. (D) Syncytium formation assay: Vero or Vero-TMPRSS2 cells were transfected to express the indicated S proteins (or no S protein, empty vector, control). At 24 h post transfection, cells were incubated in the presence or absence of trypsin (1 \u03bcg/mL) for an additional 24 h before they were fixed, stained with May-Gruenwald and Giemsa solution, and analyzed by bright field microscopy (scale bars, 200 \u03bcm).
