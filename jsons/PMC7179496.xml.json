They belong to roughly 200 heart transplant survivors in the province. One had a mild disease course, while the other was inpatient, requiring a protracted hospitalization time due to severe disease, but both recovered. The authors pointed out that the symptoms at onset in these two cases were not dissimilar to those of non-immunosuppressed cases. The first patient had fever and aspecific findings at CT scan, with recovery after few days and showing the same laboratory findings as non-immunosuppressed patients. The second one had immunosuppressive therapy discontinued and was treated with high dose corticosteroids and immunoglobulins. He had a favorable outcome, being discharged without graft loss. The authors concluded that immunosuppression could have possibly decreased the expression of infection, even though transplant patients are all the same exposed to infection because of the elevated efficiency in transmission of SARS-CoV-2.4\n",

In a pool of at least 200 transplant patients, of which ten children being inpatients, three tested positive for SARS-CoV-2, without clinical pulmonary disease and thus showing a favorable outcome. None of the patients followed at this center was reported for presenting pneumonia in this period. For this reason, the author suggests that immunosuppression may not be a predisposing factor for COVID-19, being instead protective and avoiding damage to the tissues, otherwise caused by a dysregulation in innate immune response. Compared to the general population, the author reviewed data on the current outbreak, with the hypothesis that immunosuppressive status, including transplantation and chemotherapy at any age, may not be a risk factor for a more severe disease course or even death. He concluded that the risk factors for a worse outcome, even for immunosuppressed patients, were the same presented in the general population, including an old age, obesity, diabetes, cardiovascular disease, and thus immunocompromised children and adults appear not to have a greater risk for a more severe pulmonary involvement.1\n",

Of 1590 reported cases, 18 had history of cancer, mostly involving the lungs and colon, rectum and colorectum (five patients each), and following breast (three patients), bladder (two patients), adrenal, thyroid cancer and lymphoma (one patient each). Half of this cohort required ICU admission; for them a composite outcome of severe event was considered, that is to say intensive care treatment or death. The remaining patients, that were not admitted to ICU, all recovered, and had a median younger age. The outcome was not related to the current chemotherapy treatment, with four patients in therapy that recovered without a severe course. Overall, 12 patients were cancer survivors in follow-up after primary resection. Compared to patients without cancer, patients with malignancy had an older age, a more likely history of smoking, had more reported polypnea and more severe baseline CT. There were no significant differences in sex, other symptoms at onset, other comorbidities, or baseline x-ray severity.17\n",

Of course, also the role of age and other underlying comorbidities must be taken into account.
