Just like the virus, cancer also does not respect borders and an oncological disease in LMICs often means not having access to adequate treatment. It has become imperative to take global action in the fight against inequality in medical care, a key issue of current medical ethics, so that long-term plans to develop radiation therapy in LMICs do not lose their priority in overcoming the ongoing \"silent crisis\". This pandemic is teaching us that preventive measures and strategies are essential to tackle a health emergency, especially for the implementation of a radiotherapy center that requires adequate staff training. Further delays will result in unnecessary deaths, worsening inequalities and inability to deliver benefits for health, the economy and society. This ongoing challenge requires the concerted effort of all stakeholders and the support of international organizations. If these actions were postponed to the post-pandemic period, there would be the risk of adding to the victims of COVID-19 also the deaths of cancer patients not infected but undertreated.",
