Two expert radiologists with 9 and 18 yr of experience interpreted the images independently. In the case of disagreement between the readings, the two radiologists reassessed the images in order to reach consensus. The laterality of the disease (unilateral vs bilateral), the distribution (peripheral vs central, anterior vs posterior), and the predominant zonal involvement (upper, middle, lower, or diffuse) were recorded. The predominant pattern of involvement in each lobe was assessed and categorized as ground-glass opacity (GGO) or consolidation. When there was a combination of GGO and consolidation, the allocation was divided between them accordingly. The percentage of lobar involvement was scored using the following system: 0, no involvement; 1, <25%; 2, 26\u201350%; 3, 51\u201375%; and 4, >75% involvement [8]. The scores for each lobe were summed to calculate the total lung score (maximum score 20). The final score was multiplied by five to estimate the percentage lung involvement. The presence of other imaging features was also assessed on CT scan images, including interlobular septal thickening, crazy-paving pattern, reverse halo sign, cystic changes, presence of cavitations, lymphadenopathy (defined as lymph node with short axis >10 mm), and pleural and pericardial effusion.",

As the disease progresses, other uncommon findings include pleural/pericardial effusion, lymphadenopathy, cavitation, halo sign, and pneumothorax.
