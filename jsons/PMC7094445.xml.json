            "text": "For over two decades, economic restructuring in advanced capitalist economies has challenged organized labour and with the rare exception of a few northern European countries, labour union density in many advanced capitalist economies has been in a prolonged period of stagnation or decline (Moody, 1997, Fantasia and Voss, 2004, Visser, 2006). In Canada, the percentage of workers covered by unions is double that of the United States but has slowly declined to less than a third of the labour force (Akyeampong, 2004). The central question for many labour activists and researchers continues to be how labour can revitalize itself to maintain a capacity to shape economic landscapes. There has been no shortage of commentary on these questions as an entire literature on labour union renewal has been dedicated to the project for well over a decade (Bronfenbrenner, 2003, Fairbrother and Yates, 2003, Kumar and Schenk, 2006). Geographers have also weighed in on these debates, although the approach has focussed largely on the question of the how labour can (re)organize at scales compatible to that of contemporary capital (Herod, 1998, Herod, 2001, Castree et al., 2004, Tufts, 2007a).",

This departure is antithetical to the narrow \u2018bread and butter\u2019 business unionism which typified much of the post-war compromise industrial relations in Anglo-American economies. Even the staunchest advocates of social movement unionism, however, recognize it remains an ideal rather than actual practice. Moody (2007, p. 237) argues that social movement unionism has lost much of its \u2018unique meaning\u2019 as it now refers to any effort where the union reaches out to the community in an issue based campaign. For this reason, Kumar and Murray (2006) speak of \u2018social unionism\u2019 as a midway point between business and social movement unionism to characterize unions who adopt some of the more innovative strategies, but remain very much integrated into capitalist production.",

I argue that many of the labour renewal strategies currently observed can be interpreted as not only a reaction to, but also constitutive of neoliberalism and the re-scaling of capital and the state (see Jessop, 2002, Brenner, 2004). As an entry point into this discussion, the paper proposes a model of \u2018Schumpeterian unionism\u2019 juxtaposing the ideal-types of \u2018defensive Atlantic unionism\u2019 and \u2018ideal renewed social movement unionism\u2019. I compare four areas of union activity: intra-institutional organizing; extra-institutional organization; labour\u2013management relations; and labour\u2013state relations. Here, Schumpeterian unionism is defined as a model of labour organization that preserves working-class agency by adapting to successive rounds of economic \u2018creative destruction\u2019 (see Peck and Jones, 1994). In keeping with traditional Marxist interpretations of trade unionism, these practices are neither transformative nor revolutionary, but they may sustain labour as a viable economic agent within harsher variants of neoliberalism.",

            "text": "Aside from the labour union renewal literature itself, the conceptual framework is developed from two sources. Its first theoretical inspiration is largely drawn from Jessop\u2019s (2002) political economy of evolving capital\u2013state relations. In a groundbreaking article, Jessop (1993) forwarded the Schumpeterian workfare state (SWS) as a model of state\u2013capital relations displacing the Keynesian Welfare State established in post-War Atlantic Fordist economies. At its core, the SWS model characterized a number of national policies aimed at implementing the neoliberal project (e.g., labour market flexibility, innovation). The SWS model is inspired by Schumpeter\u2019s (1942, p. 83) treatise on economic evolution that centred the process of \u2018creative destruction\u2019 as \u2018the essential fact about capitalism\u2019 that must be understood in order to understand overall economic development. Over a decade, Jessop (2002) refined his initial model to where he speaks of Schumpeterian Workfare Post-national Regimes (SWPR) as the successor to the Keynesian state. The SWPR\u2019s focus is on: economic policies which increase competitiveness in global markets; downward pressure on social wages with limited welfare; the rise of networks of public\u2013private governance; and re-scaled state policy above and below the nation. From a geographical viewpoint, the most significant evolution of Jessop\u2019s model is the integration of how capitalist states re-scale economic policy to global (e.g., policies allowing capital to flow to low wage regions) and sub-national levels (e.g., policies enhancing regional metropolitan competitiveness rather than national economic development). Indeed, it was the initial aspatiality of Jessop\u2019s model that inspired a number of geographers to explore how restructuring of the welfare state was being played out across space at different scales (see Peck, 1996, Peck, 2001).",

For labour unions, the implications of these policies must not be understated as they shape the quantity and quality of jobs delivered by capital and in some cases, challenge the rights of workers to organize effectively (Panitch and Swartz, 2003, Fantasia and Voss, 2004). While in most cases organized labour has been the target of SWPRs, it is problematic to conceptualize labour as outside processes shaping variations of capitalist states. Another approach is to explore how organized labour is changing in response to shifting policies of SWPR and how these responses are in many cases enabling neoliberal state projects operating at multiple scales. While many emergent labour union renewal strategies can still be discussed as a reaction to neoliberal restructuring and the regulatory environment imposed by SWPRs, other emerging union structures and practices can also be viewed as an integral part of contemporary capitalist economies. In other words, it is consistent to consider how unions are implicated in various formations of neoliberal regimes since Schumpeterian economies will inevitably require the consent of Schumpeterian labour. It is within this theoretical framework, that the following discussion of labour union renewal is situated.",

            "text": "Second, the model has been conceptualized through its grounding in a larger empirical project on hospitality sector unionism in Toronto, specifically the experience of UNITE-HERE Local 75 (see Tufts, 2003, Tufts, 2004, Tufts, 2006, Tufts, 2007a, Tufts, 2007b). While a number of campaigns and initiatives of Local 75 may be characterized as Schumpeterian unionism, here I present an examination of the unions response to the 2003 outbreak of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) in Toronto which adversely affected the city\u2019s hospitality sector. The specific case study is the Hospitality Workers Resource Centre (HWRC), a service developed as a response to workers displaced from work by the crisis. The case study demonstrates how the choices unions make can contribute to neoliberal agendas while simultaneously reproducing labour as viable institutions. Further, it demonstrates how \u2018Schumpeterian\u2019 unions are re-scaling their strategies in the midst of global challenges. Grounded theoretical approaches are a huge strength of contemporary economic geography (see Yeung, 1997) and any new theoretical work must remain grounded in real political circumstances of workers\u2019 lives. Abstracting organized labour\u2019s practices too far from the realities of everyday political struggles leads to analyses which are far removed from unionism as it \u2018actually exists\u2019. Following an elaboration and definition of Schumpeterian unionism, I present Local 75\u2019s response to the SARS outbreak to exemplify the model. I conclude with some broader implications for the model with respect to union renewal and the broader labour geography project.",

Defensive unionism attempts to maintain its power largely through servicing collective agreements and protecting the jobs of existing members. When new organizing does take place it is often in the form of blitzing\u2019 worksites (i.e., signing the minimal cards required for a certification vote as quickly as possible) in the union\u2019s core sector and does not guarantee a successful union drive or prepare workers for the difficult task of obtaining the first collective agreement.",

A simple shift of union resources to the recruitment of new members did not always constitute a significant shift from the defensive unionism. A renewed social movement unionism calls for more intensive organizing strategies (e.g., house calls to new members) that built solidarity for long-term struggle against capital (see Bronfenbrenner, 2003). Further, an ideal renewed unionism is not an abandonment of servicing members. Instead, such renewed unionism calls for new approaches to servicing that allow workers to self-organize against an employer through mutual-aid (see Bacharach et al., 2001) and shift any surplus resources created by greater membership participation to organizing new members within and beyond traditional industrial relations frameworks into a broader labour movement (e.g., representing workers by pressuring employers prior to any formal certification).",

            "text": "Schumpeterian unionism, however, is much more grounded in traditional approaches to representing and organizing workers. First, Schumpeterian unions do not adopt a broad-based framework as advocated by commentators arguing that low-wage service workers require new frameworks for bargaining entire occupations and communities rather than the industrial model based on the large single factory worksite (see Clawson, 2003, Wial, 1993, Fudge and Tucker, 2004). Instead, organizing campaigns are strategic and specific targets are identified. Servicing by paid staff is not abandoned, but collective bargaining efficiencies are developed and linked to organizing. For example, collective bargaining is used to exert demands for greater employer recognition of unions and to facilitate organizing (e.g., neutrality agreements with employers). Most important, campaigns and bargaining are increasingly multi-scalar as local initiatives are linked to global struggles in complex ways. Geographers have contributed their own theoretical and empirically assertions as debates are largely focussed on the appropriate scale to organize workers (see Tufts, 2007a, Tufts, 2007b, Sadler and Fagan, 2004). As Savage (2006, p. 650) succinctly notes, however, the mechanisms creating multiple scales of organizing are rarely painless transitions:\u201cThese successes, however, have raised important questions concerning matters of union structure\u2014for instance, should the power to devise strategies rest at the local level so that organizers can develop locally sensitive campaigns, or does it need to be coordinated at a national level so as to be able to match the organizational structure of employers who are increasingly national and/or international in scope, and what kinds of intra-union tensions do such questions spawn?\u201dIn other words, Schumpeterian unionism\u2019s \u2018creative destruction\u2019 of the geographical scale of defensive unionism through shifts of strategic and other organizing resources to new sectors (e.g., office cleaning, hospitality) is just as painful as the processes of \u2018creative destruction\u2019 in neoliberal economies which have restructured through technological innovation and regional and global outsourcing. The re-scaling of union practices is not only a response to the re-scaling of economic practices but also constitutive of these strategies.",

In contrast, the success of recruiting and building power over employers is often directly linked to union engagement with other labour and non-labour organizations in order to build a broad \u2018social movement unionism\u2019 around diverse communities. Again, such broad-based multi-issue coalitions are rarely achieved. And while \u2018Global Unions\u2019 are deemed crucial for organizing large scale neoliberal transnational employers such as Wal-Mart (see Bronfenbrenner, 2007, Gordon and Turner, 2000), transferring resources to institutions which can negotiate and enforce effective global agreements with employers remains a challenge (Stevis and Boswell, 2007). The power of national and sub-national central labour bodies to marshal resources from several unions is uneven as national labour movements differ in history and structure. In the case of the US, there are now two national central labour bodies following the split of the Change to Win coalition from the AFL-CIO in 2005, creating greater, if temporary, solidarity among some unions and divisions among others.\n1\n",

Recent research in the Canadian auto sector has found that unions play a role in facilitating information flows among competing firms within \u2018clusters\u2019 suggesting that restructuring through outsourcing to non-union firms can impede such knowledge transfer (Rutherford and Holmes, 2007). Some unions have adopted strategies which engage new labour\u2013management partnerships as new trade-offs are made between increasing productivity and maintaining job security. \u2018Social partnerships\u2019 are argued to strengthen labour\u2019s position by \u2018trapping\u2019 capital investment in local markets through \u2018high road\u2019 strategies that emphasize training and increased productivity in the workplace (Kelly, 2004). It is the \u2018high road\u2019 model of labour market investment which is advocated by Schumpeterian unions which are less concerned with class-based education. Here, human capital investment through vocational training is advocated for as a means of increasing local competitiveness and preparing workers for future rounds of creative destruction.

Economic development strategies often found labour and the state in a tight tri-partite relationship with local capital to attract international investment through civic boosterism (Harvey, 1989, Hudson and Sadler, 1986). Union leadership was also implicated in the coercive management of dissent against neoliberal states\u2019 restructuring of social contracts as they (paternalistically) defended against capital flight. At the same time, labour surrendered labour market regulation exclusively to the state, failing to organize workers outside of industrial relations regimes which were increasingly hostile to union expansion (Panitch and Swartz, 2003). An ideal renewed social movement unionism emphasized greater social democratic control over investment decisions which will better manage industrial (over) capacity and the creative destruction process. Further, social movement unionism defines union membership in broad terms which are centred on the needs of workers in the margins rather than exclusive formal membership. For example, the Living-Wage Campaigns which emerged in the 1990s in the de-industrialized US, pressured the state and employers to improve working standards for all workers in specified low-wage sectors, not only unionized workers (Luce, 2004).",

There are however, two main differences between its approach to economic development and more defensive unionism. First, there is recognition of the unevenness of the partnerships and for this reason they are often temporary initiatives based on specific issues rather than a long-term cooperative framework. Second, Schumpeterian unions are engaged in a process of seeking out and exploiting new state spaces created by the re-territorialization of states in an increasingly global economy (Brenner, 2004). Such unions re-territorialize their relationship with the state, increasingly to the local level as they look to identify the new points of leverage created by re-scaled state accumulation strategies. For example, Schumpeterian unions are perhaps less concerned with national electoral politics and more concerned with finding new ways to exploit the slippages created when states download responsibilities to scales such as the urban. For unions such as UNITE-HERE, participation in Left political parties at the national and sub-national scale is not abandoned, but there is encouragement to build relationships with municipal politicians (Left and Right) to influence processes such as urban development.",

In this respect, unions situate themselves inside the process of \u2018creative destruction\u2019 rather than profound economic transformation. Schumpeterian unions do not, however, launch campaigns for broad policy reform beyond their sector. Instead, benefits are secured for workers in specific sectors, which can manage the negative effects of restructuring and suppress dissent from marginalized workers who are fortunate enough to belong to unions who can elicit support from the state (e.g., subsidies for training, tax subsidies for employers).",

The impact of 9/11 itself on tourism along with the Iraq-US War, the rapid appreciation of the Canadian dollar, a breakout of BSE (i.e., \u2018mad-cow\u2019 disease) and the August 2003 blackout in north-eastern North America together created what was repeatedly referred to as a \u2019perfect storm\u2019 decimating the local tourism industry. Most important, however, was the timing of the SARS breakout. It occurred during the early spring, a time of year when seasonal tourism-related industry workers are heading back to work after exhausting employment insurance (EI) benefits received over the winter months. In the case of hotel workers who were quickly running to the end of their benefits, there was simply no job to return to.

In interviews with 30 hotel workers facing prolonged periods of underemployment in 2003 and 2004 major themes were identified in their experiences.

The most noted of these were: financial difficulties ranging from the accumulation of debt to eviction; stress associated with re-entry into the job market and changing companies and/or occupations (e.g., interview anxiety); and increased work in other jobs (e.g., two or more part-time low wage jobs as a substitute for lost hospitality employment). Second, when workers did return to hotels (often on a part-time basis) there was significant restructuring of work which included: intensified workloads as employers were hesitant to restore employment levels to pre-SARS levels; new flexible work arrangements including multi-tasking and the performance of front-line work by administrative staff; and extended period of reduced work hours.

The centre demonstrated what unions can do for working people and provided a contact point for non-union workers with the union. Through the training of peer counsellors, Local 75 also developed its leadership capacity by developing activists with skills (e.g., workshop facilitation) which are applicable to union life. The project was also a multi-scalar initiative that required a local union to negotiate with levels of government beyond the national (which was very late in its delivery of funding).

The Toronto and York Region Labour Council also supported displaced workers.

Local 75, networked with other locals through its international union, used these networks as it formulated what such a centre might look like over the longer-term (i.e., a Las Vegas style union culinary training institute). There were, however, some limits to extra-institutional organizing efforts. Other unions, historically competitive with UNITE-HERE, representing smaller numbers of workers in the sector did not lead or participate in the HWRC project. Further, there was some tension at the national scale as a committee of the Canadian Labour Congress (CLC) examining Employment Insurance reform was wary of UNITE-HERE\u2019s call for special extensions for hospitality workers as this contradicted the CLC\u2019s position of broad reforms which would restore accessibility and higher benefits to all workers, a goal more typical of social movement unionism.",

For the first time, hospitality workers made their demands known to the state which is much more experienced in responding to demands for intervention by industrial unions. For example, during HWRC\u2019s operation, the Canadian and Ontario government announced a joint 20% subsidy of Ford\u2019s $818 million flexible re-tooling of its Windsor assembly plant (Lyne, 2004). Such subsidies (which have only grown in the wake of the collapse of the North American auto sector) are largely facilitated through the joint lobbying efforts of powerful multinational corporations and industrial unions (e.g., the Canadian Auto Workers). Such large scale, long-term support for hospitality workers was not secured and the tri-partite HWRC was largely a temporary measure. However, Local 75 did manage to exploit the new state spaces created as nation states re-territorialize their accumulation strategies at the urban scale. As states centre economic development strategies around \u2018creative cities\u2019 with well-developed consumer service economies (Florida, 2002), they must address crises which threaten those related sectors. The investment made by the Canadian state in terms of stimulating tourism activity and the (relatively limited) support given to hospitality workers is evidence of re-scaled policy. Re-territorialization presents urban service workers, who have been largely ignored, with new spaces to secure state subsidies. In return for this state support, the union will play a role in regulating the labour market by managing dissent by providing material gains and sectoral based training for marginalized workers who are increasingly central to urban accumulation strategies.",

Politically, in the case of UNITE-HERE, there are limits to its Schumpeterian unionism as practiced. While UNITE-HERE in general, and Local 75 specifically, have been viewed as successful examples of union renewal (see Schenk, 2005), it is inaccurate to characterize these efforts as any significant movement toward social movement unionism. Instead, union strategies reflect a re-territorialized neoliberal economy and state as they actually exist on the ground. The experience with HWRC did create a space for Local 75 to engage with the state and begin to consider new spaces in which it can shape the development of the accommodation sector in Toronto. The union is, however, participating in the creative destruction process as it advocates turning crises into a skills upgrading opportunity. While this is common, the local and sector specific nature of the union\u2019s demands in this case limit broader social reforms and even the possibility of a shift toward a movement based unionism. UNITE-HERE\u2018s proposal of limited reforms to address the crisis is in keeping with the neoliberal state\u2019s transition away from universal welfare provisions. In the end, these demands for relatively small reforms were not even met and the limited funding for the HWRC was a small investment for the state. Establishing a program that fosters flexibility and shifts the responsibility to adapt to crises to workers is simply a variant of neoliberal labour market policy. While the HWRC had some success, it was largely localized resistance. Instead of arguing for broad changes or \u2018why can\u2019t Canada be more like Sweden?\u2019, the union settled for \u2018why can\u2019t Toronto be more like Las Vegas?\u2019 Such a Schumpeterian approach by UNITE-HERE is expected given that the strategic potential to (re)regulate the local labour market through such a centre and the new spaces for engagement created by the re-scaling of state economic development strategies. Such strategies are, however, unlikely to inspire a mass social movement needed for economic transformation (or even much needed national employment insurance reform). At best, unions can engage new state spaces and the contradictions of urban accumulation and even improve the lives of working people in specific sectors and places, but the dominant economic system is inevitably reproduced.",

First, a key aspect of Schumpeterian unionism emphasized here is the multi-scalarity of union renewal efforts. Schumpeterian unions do not recognize the primacy of any one particular scale, but instead focus on how different scales of worker mobilization or state control can be engaged with to the advantage of workers. In their analysis of the SARS outbreak, Keil and Ali (2007) argue that the same global connectivity which allowed the disease to spread so quickly also allowed international health care professionals to share information and transcended the limits of national based health care systems. Similarly, as the epidemic displaced hospitality workers from Toronto\u2019s migrant and racialized communities, the union similarly marshalled action beyond and below the nation state, soliciting local support to federal officials and integrating \u2018high road partnerships\u2019 practiced in other countries. As Ward (2007, p. 273) reminds us \u201c\u2026the importance of acting at certain scales is always relative and contingent. It does not necessarily become more or less important in the move from the local to the global or from the global to the local.\u201d As a concept, Schumpeterian unionism captures this fluidity and emphasizes how different scales of worker action and engagement conflict with and strengthen each other.",

The above conceptualization of Schumpeterian unionism may be taken as an example of how labour geography might contribute to broader discussions of labour union renewal and the political economy of work. Further, it is an example of how capital\u2013state theory might inform labour geography. If labour geography is to flourish as a viable sub-discipline it will inevitably have to engage with a variety of literatures and approaches to labour studies. Excavating labour agency will remain central to the project, but rigidly applying an agency (an elusive and chaotic concept) litmus test to define the discipline may prematurely isolate labour geography from other research on work.
