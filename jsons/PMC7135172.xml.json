Episteme involves abstract reasoning about idealized, disembodied, universal concepts. Its methods are deduction and generalization; it is the basis for modern science and appears in medicine as the quest for methodological rigor. Its most muscular manifestation is the evidence-based medicine movement. Techne involves a mix of the abstract and the practical. Its goals are the development and testing of \u201crecipes\u201d; it is the basis for modern engineering and appears in medicine largely in the form of numeric reasoning, such as applied statistical inference.",

Taken together, techne and episteme are judgments about how knowledge is to be verified, codified, and expressed, once it has been discovered.1\n",

Indeed, Reed2 found 84 crossover trials in a 7-year search of 3 prominent emergency medicine journals (including Annals)\u2014about 1 per month across all 3 journals. Reed notes that, in a sample of these studies, none explicitly examined the possibility of carryover effects, the most important bias peculiar to crossover designs. We then expect a technical explanation of how to do a statistical test for carryover, accompanied by exhortations to be more careful next time, but instead a review of the main methods for such testing reveals that none of them work. Even worse, the current opinion of experts in the field is that no successful method will be devised.4 The careful application of techne to this issue leads to the conclusion that techne will not be able to help us.",

If Tham's article had been a scientific study of the development of a clinical decision rule to identify patients at high risk for SARS, reviewers would have found it seriously flawed. Their screening tool was put into use 4 days after the first nurses became ill; at that time, there had been only about 10 cases of confirmed SARS at their hospital, not nearly enough to support development of a screening test. It was repeatedly modified during the course of its use. And, even if they had been lucky enough to come up with a decision rule that was highly sensitive, the confidence limits on sensitivity would have been ludicrously wide.",

Reed2 points out that the US Food and Drug Administration has, in effect, done that, although some disagree with their stance.4 A more enlightened approach would be to require that authors (and editors and reviewers) explicitly examine the question of carryover effects. If, on the basis of their knowledge of the domain they believe carryover can be neglected, then they should clearly indicate that the results are contingent on the validity of that assumption; if not, then the crossover design must be abandoned. This will require a degree of subjective insight and judgment (that is, m\u0113tis) that some may find uncomfortable. This discomfort is unwarranted, however. All studies, whether crossover trials or not, contain innumerable unverified and unverifiable assumptions. They may seem less bothersome because many are less obvious, and many we have simply gotten used to, but they are there nonetheless. Reed's article on crossover trials illustrates what an important role this sort of knowledge plays in the research world, even though it is seldom spoken of there.",
