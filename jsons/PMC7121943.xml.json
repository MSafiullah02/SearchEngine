In total, about 3.5 % of the proteins in the PDB carry covalently bound glycan chains and thus can be classified as glycoproteins.

Those proteins are lectins, receptors, toxins, antibodies, microbial adhesins, carbohydrate-binding modules, transporters, but also enzymes involved in their synthesis, modification, and degradation. In the present work, only some of these glycan-binding proteins have been selected; they are lectins, monoclonal antibodies, glycosaminoglycan-binding proteins, and glycosyltransferases. As regards to the carbohydrates, the three-dimensional features of monosaccharides, disaccharides, oligosaccharides, and polysaccharides are covered in the form of databases, without claiming exhaustivity. A collection of annotated NMR data of bioactive oligosaccharides is also available. These databases have been developed with nonproprietary software, and they are opened freely to the scientific community. They are accessible throughout a common portal called \u201cGlyco3D\u201dhttp://glyco3d.cermav.cnrs.fr. Each individual database stands by itself as it covers a particular field of structural glycosciences. Nevertheless, the interconnection of these databases provides a unique opportunity to characterize the three-dimensional features that a given oligosaccharide molecule can take in different environments, i.e., vacuum, crystalline state, or interacting with different proteins having different biological function. To this aim, a common nomenclature has been adopted for the structural encoding of the carbohydrates.",

Recommendations apply to the description of polysaccharides and glycoproteins (Mcnaught 1997). Other types of representations have been developed in glycobiology, favoring pictorial representations that facilitate the visualization of the monosaccharides. This is adequate as the number of basic carbohydrate units found in mammals is limited. Extension to the constituents found in bacterial and plant polysaccharides has also been developed and adopted (Varki et al. 2015). Figure 7.1 presents in a non-exhaustive fashion the results of such an extension, which allows the description of some structural descriptors which were not taken into account previously.",

As compared to nucleic acids or proteins, there are a far greater numbers of monosaccharides. In addition, carbohydrates are frequently found to have branched structures; most of them are tree-like molecules. The prerequisite for a residue-based encoding format is a controlled vocabulary of its residue names. It makes sense to restrict the number of residues to as low as possible. The lack of clear rules to subscribe atoms of a molecule to one particular monosaccharide, and not to its substituent(s), is the main hurdle in encoding monosaccharide names. The variety in nomenclature and structural representation of glycans makes it complex to decide the best form to use. The choice of notation is frequently based on whether the study is focused on the chemistry or on biology. The information content of each representation may vary or highlight a particular aspect as compared to others. While representing a complex glycan structure, chemists prefer to elucidate the structure that includes information about the anomeric carbon, the chirality of the glycan, the monosaccharides present, and the glycosidic linkages that connect them. For others, it is more interesting to visualize the monosaccharides present, and hence a symbolic/diagrammatic notation is favored (Fig. 7.2). \n",

For establishing the 3D database, they all have been subjected to systematic conformational sampling to determine their conformational preferences, using molecular mechanics optimization. Whereas most of the monosaccharides exhibit a fairly rigid ring conformation, some cases exist such as in the case of iduronic acid, idose, and all furanosides where several ring shapes can occur. In these cases, the low-energy conformations are available for each entry.",

In the so-called Heavy Atom Definition commonly used in crystallography, \u03a6 is the torsion angle \u03a6 = O5-C1-O-Cx, and \u03a8 is the torsion angle \u03a8 = C1-O1-Cx-Cx+1, where x is the number of the carbon atom of the second monosaccharide with which the 1\u2192 x glycosidic bond is formed. An alternate definition of use in NMR spectroscopy refers to the hydrogen atoms about the glycosidic bond in a way such as \u03a6H = H1-C1-O-Cx and \u03a8H = C1-O-Cx-Hx. For two monosaccharides linked by a 1\u2192 6 linkage, another parameter (\u03c9) is required describing the orientation about the exocyclic bond C5-C6. Its orientation is customarily described by the torsion angles O5-C5-C6-O6 and C4-C5-C6-O6, which combination defines the so-called gauche-trans (gt), gauche-gauche (gg), and trans-gauche (tg) conformations (Marchessault and Perez 1979). For each disaccharide, an exhaustive search was performed using the MM3 molecular mechanics force field. This gave a complete sampling of the conformational space, yielding the construction of a relaxed adiabatic energy map, which is represented as a function of \u03a6 and \u03a8 torsion angles. In the case of 1\u2192 6 linkages, relaxed adiabatic maps can be established for the three low-energy orientations of the torsion angle \u03c9. Typically, the exploration of each such energy maps indicates the occurrence of 2\u20134 energy minima.",

            "text": "Glycosyltransferases (GTs) constitute a ubiquitous group of enzymes that catalyze the synthesis of glycosidic linkages by the transfer of a sugar residue from a donor to an acceptor (Breton et al. 2012). Acceptor substrates are carbohydrates, proteins, lipids, DNA, and numerous small molecules such as antibiotics, flavonol, steroids, etc. Glycosyl donor substrates are mostly sugar nucleotides, such as UDP-GlcNAc, UDP-Gal, and GDP-Man. However, lipid-linked sugars, e.g., dolichol phosphate saccharides and unsubstituted phosphates, are also utilized. Acceptor substrates are carbohydrates, proteins, lipids, DNA, antibiotic, or other small molecules. Sugar-nucleotide-dependent GTs are often referred to as Leloir enzymes. The transfer of saccharides by GTs is regiospecific and stereospecific with two possible stereochemical outcomes resulting in either inversion or retention of the anomeric configuration of the transferred sugar. Glycosyltransferases display low sequence homology, and they have recently been classified into 90 families (CAZY database: http://www.cazy.org). At the present time, more than 140 GT crystal structures are available that have been grouped in 40 families. Surprisingly, the three-dimensional architectures of Leloir-type GTs are remarkably conserved, and their X-ray structures exhibit mostly two general types of folds, termed GT-A and GT-B. As for the GTs that utilize lipid-phosphate donor substrates, different folds have been observed.",

Three-dimensional structures have been established from X-ray crystallography as listed in http://www.bioinf.org.uk/abs/sacs/ (Allcorn and Martin 2002). Carbohydrate determinants recognized by antibodies are expressed on the cell surface as glycolipids and glycoproteins. In many instances, the minimum carbohydrate epitopes are located at the terminal end of more complex carbohydrate chains, experiencing a wide range of contexts, surface densities, and surroundings. Therefore, antibodies with similar specificities for individual carbohydrate epitopes can exhibit different selective cell profiling depending upon the unique presentation of the carbohydrate on the target cells. As a consequence, anti-carbohydrate antibodies with specificity to oligosaccharides and polysaccharides are of a high importance in immunology and are attractive targets for vaccine design (Pazur 1998). In the present database, the set of high-resolution structures of carbohydrate-antibody complexes is somehow limited. These studies are typically limited to systems involving antibody fragments, such as the antigen-binding fragment (Fab) or variable fragment (Fv), and to small oligosaccharides. Analysis of these complexes reveals general trends about how antibodies recognize different types of carbohydrates. Antibodies which recognize a terminal carbohydrate motif generally feature cavity-like binding sites, where one or more carbohydrate residues are anchored in the cavity by \u201cend-on\u201d extension. Antibodies which recognize an internal carbohydrate motif, as a single repeat of a bacterial polysaccharide, for example, generally exhibit groove-like binding sites or very large cavities which are open at both ends of the site, allowing for \u201cside-on\u201d entry of the antigen.",

This covers almost 250 different proteins. Most 3D structures have been for the time being, obtained for plant and animal lectins. Nevertheless, the number of structural investigations dealing with viral and bacterial materials increases rapidly. Among these structures, 64 % are complexed with a carbohydrate ligand which can be multiforms; i.e., they are monosaccharides, oligosaccharides, glycoproteins, or synthetic glyco-compounds from organic chemistry (Table 7.2). Accurate determination of carbohydrate\u2013lectin complexes remains a nontrivial problem due to the shallow and multichambered binding sites of many lectins. This is nevertheless a requirement to access information about their binding mechanisms in biologically relevant conditions. \n\n",

Only one structure of algal lectin is available at the present time (Ziolkowska et al. 2006). As for structural motifs, there is a strong predominance of \u03b2-sheets. Two such \u03b2-sheets can assemble to form a \u03b2-sandwich, an architecture commonly found in more than half of the entries. These \u03b2-sandwiches exhibit dissimilarities and the location of binding sites shows many variations. For example, the immunoglobulin-like fold of animal sialo-adhesins is very different from the jelly-roll fold of legume lectins. More complex combinations of \u03b2-sheets occur, giving rise to \u03b2-propellers and \u03b2-prisms. Despite the fact that topologies are very different between families, some interesting structural convergences are nevertheless observed. Intracellular animal lectins which are involved in the quality control of glycoprotein synthesis share the same protein fold with legume lectins, now referred to as L-lectin (Loris 2002).",
