As in dealing over time with major stressors such as cancer, we are also advised to hope for the best while preparing for the worst, make our hopes realistic, and align our goals with our core values. Clinicians who work with cancer patients are aware of the particular ways that a serious illness can affect someone who has cared for a parent with cancer, or is vulnerable to anxious depression. We are already seeing ways that COVID-19 can heighten anxiety in those with a history of traumatic isolation, or OCD, or chronic schizophrenia with a need for predictable routines. Such forms of anxiety typically benefit from targeted support, behavioral interventions such as mindfulness and CBT, and/or medication.",

The virus\u2019s rapid worldwide spread engenders a confrontation with our selves, with who we are as a society, and with our assumptions about where we can ultimately place our trust (https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/02/us/coronavirus-apocalypse-religion.html). Many of the questions it raises in these areas have religious, rather than scientific answers. Our spiritual traditions offer insight into who we are: created and/or interdependent, beautiful and broken, both lamenting our suffering and called to respond to the suffering of others. Our spiritual practices connect us with these realities in bodily and collective ways.",
