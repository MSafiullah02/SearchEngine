Rubella virus infection during the first trimester of pregnancy may lead to fetal death or various birth defects, including deafness, cataracts, and heart disease, known as congenital rubella syndrome (CRS) [Best, 2007; Hobman and Chantler, 2007]. Live\u2010attenuated vaccines against rubella virus have been available since the late 1960s [Hobman and Chantler, 2007]. However, globally, at least 100,000 cases of CRS occur each year [Robertson et al., 2003]. S\u00e3o Paulo State is the most populated Brazilian State with a population of 41 million, as of 2010. In order to control rubella and measles epidemics, the measles\u2013rubella (MR) vaccine was introduced into the immunization program in 1992, which was preceded by a \u201ccatch\u2010up\u201d campaign among children 1\u201311 years old [Massad et al., 1995]. Despite this, however, rubella epidemics occurred in 2000/2001 and 2007/2008. The age of rubella onset increased gradually from 1999 to 2008; in the last year, the patients in most cases were 20\u201329 years old.",

The Institute is a member of the Program of Elimination of Rubella and CRS of the Ministry of Health of Brazil. From January 1996 to December 2009, nine amniotic fluid samples, one product of conception, one placental sample, and two blood samples were collected from patients in cases associated with primary rubella infection during pregnancy (CRI). All amniotic fluid samples were obtained at 21 weeks of gestation and 6 weeks after the onset of clinical signs of rubella infection. Samples were also collected from cases with CRS, comprising six blood and eight urine samples (Table I). Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) were separated using Ficoll\u2010Hypaque gradients and suspended in Dulbecco's minimum Eagle's essential medium (DMEM) supplemented with 2% fetal bovine serum (FBS). Urine samples were collected in sterile vessels and neutralized with sodium bicarbonate to pH 7.0. The product of conception and placenta were processed directly for PCR.

The 27 rubella sequences were divided into four genotypes (Figs. 1b, 2, and 3): genotype 1a (seven strains), genotype 1B (four strains), genotype 1G (eight strains), and genotype 2B (eight strains). The homology observed among all sequence isolates and the reference strains ranged from 97.8% to 98.2% for genotype 1a, from 90.0% to 93% for genotype 1G, from 97% to 98% for genotype 1B, and 98% to 99% for genotype 2B. All sequences of genotypes 1a, 1B, 1G, and 2B formed a well\u2010supported cluster in the distance tree and grouped with the reference strains with a significant bootstrap value. RV isolates belonging to genotypes 1a, 1B, and 1G were present in S\u00e3o Paulo during the 2000 and 2001 outbreaks.

Genotype 1G obtained in this study showed a 98% similarity with viruses from Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, that circulated in 1999 (GenBank accession number AJ890443).

Between 1992 and 2000, the incidence of rubella among adults increased markedly, with a steady rise in the detection of CRS cases. In 2000 and 2001, two outbreaks occurred in S\u00e3o Paulo, with incidences reaching 7.1 per 100,000 inhabitants in 2000 and 3.8 per 100,000 inhabitants in 2001 among women aged 20\u201329 years (23.7 cases per 100,000 persons in this age group), with 138 confirmed rubella cases among pregnant women [CVE, 2010]. The accumulation of a large number of susceptible (unvaccinated) individuals led to the occurrence of a rubella epidemic in S\u00e3o Paulo in 2007; in this outbreak, most of the rubella cases involved men between 20 and 29 years of age, which differed from the demographics observed during the outbreak that occurred in 2000. A large number of cases were concentrated in the central west, south, southeast, and northeast of Brazil; there were 8,683 confirmed cases, including 161 cases of pregnant women and 17 CRS cases [Brazilian Health Department, [Link]].

The RV genome was detected in 92% of the samples by RT\u2010PCR. As the clinical diagnosis of rubella is unreliable, rapid laboratory diagnosis of rubella in pregnancy is critical. The risk of congenital infection is usually estimated by establishing the gestational age at the time of maternal infection. However, diagnosis of intrauterine infection is difficult because maternal serology is often inconclusive when infection occurs between the 13th and 20th weeks of gestation [Best, 2007]. The most direct method of diagnosing fetal infection is by PCR, and is therefore essential for early diagnosis, as shown by another study [Andrade et al., 2006].",

            "text": "For phylogenetic analysis, 15 sequences were obtained from viral isolates by using SIRC cell cultures and 11 were obtained directly from clinical samples (i.e., amniotic fluid, conception product, and placenta). Phylogenetic analysis of the 26 sequences obtained during this study showed that at least 4 different genotypes were involved in congenital infections: genotypes 1a, 1B, 1G, and 2B. Our study showed that there was a high incidence of rubella genotypes 1a, 1B, and 1G in pregnant women during the 2000/2001 outbreaks. The first isolation of this genotype in S\u00e3o Paulo was reported by Reef et al. [2002] and persisted until 2007 [Figueiredo et al., 2008; Figueiredo et al., 2011, 2012a, 2012b]. Genotype 1a has also been responsible for the outbreaks that occurred in Myanmar and Mongolia in 2000 [Thant et al., 2006]. Recently, this genotype was found in Japan, Cambodia, and Kazakhstan [Abernathy et al., 2011], but there are no available data for comparison with the 1a strains found in S\u00e3o Paulo (Fig. 4). The genotype 1B found in this study was most similar to an isolate obtained in Israel more than 20 years earlier (GenBank accession number AY968209). In 2001, genotype 1B was found in France, and in 2007, in South Africa [Vauloup\u2010Fellous et al., 2010; Abernathy et al., 2011]. During the 2000\u20132001 outbreak, genotype 1G was also isolated and has continued to persist in Brazil [Icenogle et al., 2011]. It is important to note that genotype 1G exhibited sequence similarity to the 1G strain from Rio de Janeiro isolated during 1996\u20131999 [Donadio et al., 2003]. Genotype 1G is one of the prevalent genotypes of RV in Europe, Asia, and Africa (Fig. 4) [WHO, 2005, 2007; Jin and Thomas, 2007; Caidi et al., 2008; Rajasundari et al., 2008; Omer et al., 2010]. Viruses with genotypes 1G and 1B have been found in the Americas over a 7\u2010year time span, indicating that these viruses were likely endemic [Abernathy et al., 2011]. During the 2007 outbreak, genotype 2B was the predominant rubella strain in Brazil and South America [Icenogle et al., 2011; Figueiredo et al., 2012a]. Genotype 2B viruses were previously known to circulate in Asia and Africa [WHO, 2005, 2007], and after 2006, genotype 2B was introduced to some countries in Europe [Jin and Thomas, 2007; D'Agaro et al., 2010; Vauloup\u2010Fellous et al., 2010] and South America (Fig. 4) [Valinotto et al., 2009]. The fact that genotype 2B was not detected in the Americas before 2006 may indicate importation from Europe or Asia where this genotype is endemic. Genotype 2B found in these countries showed 99% identity with recent isolates from Japan, Argentina, and Brazil.",

More recently, genotype 1E was isolated in cases of congenital infection from France [Vauloup\u2010Fellous et al., 2010]. It is possible that genotype 1E has a greater propensity to cause congenital infections than other genotypes do, but it is more likely that the 1E virus was simply the most prevalent. Vauloup\u2010Fellous et al. [2010] suggested a very wide circulation of genotype 1E, which may well be the most prevalent contemporary genotype worldwide (Fig. 4). Phylogeny showed that the French 1E sequences are interspersed with viruses from other European and American countries, possibly indicating multiple exchanges between these countries. In Brazil, consistent with national reports, genotype 1E virus not was detected [Icenogle et al., 2011]. Interestingly, the epidemiology for RV characterized in S\u00e3o Paulo over a 13\u2010year period showed that genotype 1a was predominant, comprising 44% of total virus strains, followed by genotype 1G (22%), 2B (20%), and 1B (%). The detection of these genotypes coincided with rubella outbreaks in S\u00e3o Paulo from 2000 to 2007. In conclusion, this is the first molecular epidemiological characterization of RVs involved in CRI and CRS in Brazil. Our findings suggest that endemic transmission of RV has been interrupted. Nevertheless, rubella is still endemic in many parts of the world; therefore, it is important to maintain the surveillance system in order to document sustained absence of CRS and to maintain high vaccine coverage.",
