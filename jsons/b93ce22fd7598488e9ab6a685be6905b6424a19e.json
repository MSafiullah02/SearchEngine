The median duration of diarrhea was 3 days (range 1-4) and the median number of evacuations per day was 4 (range 2-6). Abdominal pain was described as diffuse colicky pain in 5 subjects and as difficile. 4 However, in our case series, we recorded GI symptoms at the initial phase of the infection, thus it is likely that new-onset diarrhea is the consequence of SARS-CoV-2 entering intestinal cells through the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2). 5 The prevalence of diarrhea (17.8%) in our patients is remarkably similar to that reported by Sultan et al., 4 in studies from countries other than China (18.3%). 4, 6 Albeit unusual, some of our patients (6%) had GI symptoms as the exclusive manifestation of COVID-19. With respect to the prevalence of abdominal pain, it was considerably high (10%) in our cohort, compared with that reported in the abovementioned meta-analysis (3-6%-5.3%). 4 However, a recent study from England revealed that 9 out of 76 (11.8%) patients were hospitalized, with acute abdominal pain as their main complaint. 7 The pathophysiology of abdominal pain and its relation to SARS-CoV-2 is unknown and needs to be clarified. The prevalence of vomiting and abnormal liver tests is consistent with the results of previous reports.",

Patients with gastrointestinal symptoms also reported significantly higher rates of fatigue (82.6% vs. 40.4%; p=0.0003), chest pain (30.4% vs. 4.4%; p=0.0013), and loss of smell or taste (17.4% vs. 2.2% p=0.018). Fifty-nine patients underwent laboratory testing that included liver enzymes, which were abnormal, compared with normal limits, in 20 (33%) of those patients. Abnormal AST (defined as any value above the ULN) was reported in 16.9% (n=10) of the patients and abnormal ALT in 15.2% (n=9). Two of the three patients that died had liver abnormalities. No other variables, including the presence of gastrointestinal disease, correlated with disease severity.DiscussionIn our Mexican cohort, SARS-CoV-19 was shown to affect the gastrointestinal tract, causing symptoms, which concurs with reports from other parts of the world. Specifically, 1 out of 5 COVID-19 patients may initially present with GI symptoms, the most frequent of which is diarrhea. COVID-19-related diarrhea is multifactorial. Several studies have described the development of diarrhea during hospitalization in a majority of patients, which could have been attributable to other medications or other infections, such as C.",
