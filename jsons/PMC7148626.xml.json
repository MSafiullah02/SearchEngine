            "text": "Astroviruses are enteric viruses first identified in the feces of children with diarrhea. Detection was originally based on a five- to six-pointed star morphology of virions by electron microscopy (EM). However, only about 10% of viral particles display these structures; the remaining 90% of particles have a smooth surface and a size similar to other small, round-structured viruses like picornaviruses and caliciviruses. Thus, accurate diagnostics were difficult to obtain and the true prevalence of astrovirus within a population was difficult to assess. Development of much more sensitive detection techniques like real time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), cell culture RT-PCR, and astrovirus-specific enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISAs) have made detection more accurate and specific, even allowing diagnosis of specific serotypes. Utilizing these techniques, astroviruses have been found in approximately 3\u20138% of children with diarrhea. Astroviruses can also be isolated in a subset of asymptomatic individuals, suggesting that a proportion of infected individuals shed the virus asymptomatically or for some time after the resolution of other symptoms of infection. Asymptomatic carriers may be a major reservoir for astroviruses in the environment and could contribute to dissemination of the virus.",

Human astroviruses are known to survive up to 90 days in both marine and tap water, with survival potential increasing in colder temperatures.

Later that year, Madeley and Cosgrove identified the virus in association with diarrhea in children and bestowed the name astrovirus (from the Greek astron, meaning star) for the star-like morphology of a proportion of viral particles seen by EM (Figure 1(a)\n). Because of genomic similarities, astroviruses were originally thought to belong to either the families Picornaviridae or Caliciviridae. However, the lack of a helicase and use of a frameshifting event during replication (discussed below) distinguish astroviruses so completely that, in 1993, the International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses (ICTV) classified astroviruses as a unique family, Astroviridae, composed of a single genus Astrovirus. Continued investigation into newly discovered astroviruses led to the division of the family into two genera, Mamastrovirus and Avastrovirus, by the ICTV in 2005. ICTV nomenclature abbreviates astrovirus AstV, with a single-letter abbreviation for the species type (i.e., human astrovirus; HAstV; turkey astrovirus; TAstV, etc.). Successive, serologically distinct isolates of astroviruses are named sequentially within that species (i.e., HAstV-1 through HAstV-8).",

While the exact incidences of infection vary from study to study, community-acquired astroviruses are found in 3\u20136% of children with infectious gastroenteritis. In some developing countries, infection rates as high as 20% have been observed. In many cases, astroviruses are the second most commonly detected viral pathogen in young children after rotavirus. Astrovirus infections are identified in up to 2% of asymptomatic individuals. These data may underrepresent actual astrovirus infections, as studies generally survey individuals visiting medical care centers. Because astrovirus disease is generally mild in humans (see the section discussing pathogenesis), hospital cases may represent only a slight proportion of actual infections in the community. In support of this, serological studies have demonstrated that up to 90% of children have been exposed to at least one strain of astrovirus by age 9.",

HAstV-6, -7, and -8 are the least frequently detected, although three to four serotypes of HAstV are often detected in a region at any given time. The differing prevalence of serotypes could be a reflection of severity; perhaps HAstV-1 infection results in a higher frequency of hospital visits than other serotypes and is therefore overrepresented in hospital-based epidemiological studies. Alternatively, serotypes may be restricted by region. For example, one Mexican study identified HAstV-1 as the predominant serotype throughout the country, but HAstV-3 and -8 were prominent in select regions.",

Astrovirus outbreaks have also been associated with high-density environments, including childcare centers, primary and junior high schools, military recruiting centers, elderly care centers, and swimming pools.

Astroviruses have been found in association with most animals examined, although the effect of infection varies with species (see below). While astroviruses were originally identified in humans, they have since been identified in both mammalian and avian species, including rabbits, mice, calves, sheep, piglets, dogs, red-tailed deer, kittens, mink, turkeys, ducklings, chicken, and guinea fowl. At least three serotypes of bovine astroviruses are postulated to exist based on distinct neutralizing antibodies (one in the United States and two in the United Kingdom). In addition, astroviruses have been isolated from mink across Scandinavia, and serological studies have demonstrated that astroviruses were prevalent in chicken flocks in the 1980s as well as in 2001. Interestingly, two very different manifestations of chicken astrovirus infection have been described (see the section on pathogenesis), suggesting that distinct chicken astroviruses may circulate; however, this is yet to be proven. The best epidemiologically characterized animal astroviruses are the turkey astroviruses. Surveillance of turkey flocks in the 1980s isolated astrovirus from 78% of diseased flocks, but only 29% of normal flocks. Astroviruses were the first pathogen detected in many flocks and were most commonly detected in birds less than 4 weeks of age. Similar to human infections, turkey astrovirus was frequently isolated with other pathogens, most commonly rotavirus-like viruses. The early age of infection and the prevalence of co-infections led one group to postulate that astrovirus infection may predispose birds to infection by other viruses.",

Propagation of porcine, bovine, and chicken astroviruses has been successful in their respective host cells in vitro. However, many astroviruses still have not been adapted to propagation in vitro for unknown reasons, while others lose infectivity with subsequent passages and therefore cannot be maintained continuously. This problem has been circumvented in some systems by passing the virus through an animal system, as is the case for the turkey astrovirus, in which highly concentrated virus can be obtained from infected turkey embryos in ovo.",

The plus-strand genome is released into the cytoplasm by unknown mechanisms and ORF1a and -1b are immediately translated by the host machinery. ORF1a is 2.8 kb and encodes a polypeptide of approximately 110 kDa. This polypeptide contains a variety of conserved motifs, including several putative transmembrane domains, a bipartite nuclear localization sequence (NLS), and a serine protease motif. The translated polypeptide is cleaved by both cellular protease(s) and the viral protease into at least five peptides. The actual function of each protein remains largely unknown. The transmembrane domains may localize to the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) membrane to facilitate replication, as all plus-strand RNA viruses have been shown to replicate in association with a membrane. One peptide, NSP1a/4, colocalizes with the viral RNA at the ER membrane; mutations in NSP1a correlate with increased viral titers in vitro and in vivo, suggesting a role for this protein in viral replication.

Intensive research has determined that ORF1b is translated by a frameshift into the \u20131 frame. This frameshifting event is unique among plus-strand animal RNA viruses and requires a highly conserved shifty heptameric sequence (A6C) as well as a downstream hairpin structure. This event, which occurs with frequencies up to 25% in cells, results in an ORF1a/1b fusion peptide. Cleavage near the 1a/1b border releases the ORF1b gene product: the viral RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp). Astrovirus polymerase is a supergroup 1 RdRp, a group which generally utilizes a VPg to initiate transcription. Although a VPg is postulated to exist and a putative VPg genomic linkage site has been identified, its existence is yet to be empirically proven.",

This generates multiple copies of the plus-strand genome as well as a polyadenylated subgenomic RNA (sgRNA) containing short 5\u2032 and 3\u2032 UTRs and ORF2. ORF2 is in the 0 frame and overlaps ORF1b slightly (four nucleotides) in human astroviruses. Production of the capsid protein from a sgRNA not only temporally restricts capsid production to later in the viral replication cycle, but also allows for massive capsid protein expression; it is estimated that sgRNA is produced in tenfold excess of the viral genome by 12 h post infection (hpi). The sgRNA is about 2.4 kb and encodes the single structural protein of approximately 87 kDa. This peptide is cleaved by an intracellular protease to approximately 79 kDa; mutational analyses suggest that this 8 kDa stretch is required for efficient expression of the capsid protein. Individual capsid proteins multimerize spontaneously to form icosahedral structures of about 32 nm (Figure 1(b)). Positive-sense genomes are packaged into these viral-like particles (VLPs), possibly through interactions with the first 70 amino acids of the capsid protein. The virions are released by an unknown mechanism, which may involve cellular caspases, after which the capsid undergoes an extracellular trypsin-mediated maturational cleavage. This increases infectivity up to 105 fold, condenses the virion to approximately 28 nm, and transforms the 79 kDa capsid protein into at least three smaller peptides of approximately 34, 29, and 26 kDa. Computational predictions suggest that VP34 may comprise the core of the virion while VP29 and VP26 form spike-like projections that may be important for viral tropism and receptor binding. This is corroborated by studies suggesting that VP26 is only loosely associated with the virion. These spikes are also thought to be responsible for the star morphology visible by EM (Figure 1(a)).",

            "text": "Examination of nucleotide changes and nonsynonymous amino acid changes from the whole genome and across species suggests that an ancient divergence between avian and mammalian astroviruses occurred approximately 310 million years ago. Mammalian astroviruses split more recently into two distinct clades: human astroviruses and feline/mink-associated astroviruses. Phylogenetic clustering of the human astroviruses together argues against continual human\u2013animal interspecies transmission. It is hypothesized that at least two interspecies transmission events (avian to porcine, porcine to feline) led to the current division of viruses. Further comparison of synonymous mutations by codon usage generates an astrovirus evolutionary pattern which mirrors the evolution of respective hosts, suggesting that recent evolution of the virus may have been in adaptation to the host. As RNA viruses, astroviruses are expected to undergo frequent genetic changes. However, nucleotide changes occur at rates of approximately 5% in human viruses over time, despite the co-circulation of muptiple serotypes within a region. Nucleotide and amino acid comparisons of ORF1a of human astroviruses demonstrate two distinct lineages, known as genogroup I (HAstV-1 to -5) and genogroup II (HAstV-6 and -7). Comparisons of ORF1b or ORF2 lack these distinct groups, leading investigators to postulate that a recombination event at the ORF1a/1b junction occurred before HAstV-6 or -7 diverged.",

Diarrhea occasionally contained undigested food, but never blood. The intestines of infected birds became thin walled, flaccid, and distended. Despite these changes, histological examination suggested that only mild changes occur during infection. A mild crypt hyperplasia and shortening of the villi were noted from 4 or 5 to 9 dpi, and single degrading enterocytes could be identified. However, TUNEL staining suggested that the amount of cell death in infected intestines is similar to control birds. d-xylose absorption, a measure of intestinal absorption, was significantly decreased from 2 to 5 dpi in one study and up to 13 dpi in another. This effect was exacerbated in the presence of another enteric pathogen, turkey coronavirus.

Infected birds develop liver hemorrhage, swollen kidneys, and hepatocyte necrosis. On farms, infection leads to mortality rates of 10\u201325% in adult (4\u20136-week-old) ducks, but can reach 50% in ducklings under 14 days of age. In chickens, infection with the astrovirus avian nephritis virus (ANV) results in discoloration of the kidney, development of renal lesions, and interstitial nephritis by 3 dpi. Pathogenesis is age dependent, with 1-day-old chicks the most susceptible and adult birds the least. ANV infection can result in mortality rates of up to 33%, although rates appear to be strain specific.",

The biphasic infection pattern of young children and the elderly suggests that antibodies are protective during the middle of life. Indeed, serological studies have indicated that approximately 50% of neonates have maternally acquired antibody to HAstV, which wane by 4\u20136 months of age. Children then acquire anti-HAstV antibodies rapidly due to astrovirus exposure. By the age of 9, up to 90% of the population has been exposed to HAstV-1. Furthermore, volunteer experiments demonstrate that astrovirus exposure generally leads to an increase in anti-astrovirus antibody titer. While astrovirus antibodies protected individuals from symptoms associated with infection, virus was identified in the feces, suggesting that such antibodies do not necessarily prevent viral replication. Additionally, immunoglobulin treatment has been attempted as a treatment for severe or chronic astrovirus infection. The results have been mixed and difficult to interpret, as the presence of astrovirus-specific antibodies in the immunoglobulin treatment was not always confirmed.",

Studies have demonstrated that most individuals possess HLA-restricted, astrovirus-specific T cells. When stimulated with astrovirus in vitro, these cells produce tumor necrosis factor, interferon gamma, and occasionally interleukin (IL)-5 but not IL-2 or IL-4. These cytokines are typical of the T-helper-type response thought to be important in controlling viral infections. Individuals deficient in T and B-cell functions are unable to control infection, shedding virus to very high titers (\u22651014 particles ml\u22121) and for extended periods of time (up to 18 months), further supporting the importance of cellular immunity.",

In this model, no increase in T cells (CD4+ or CD8+) could be demonstrated after TAstV-2 infection. Moreover, while infected turkeys produced a slight increase in antibody production, these antibodies were not neutralizing and did not prevent against future infection. However, it was noted that macrophages from TAstV-2 infected turkeys produced significantly higher levels of nitric oxide (NO) both in vivo and upon stimulation ex vivo. Inhibition of NO in vivo led to a significant increase in viral production, while addition of exogenous NO decreased viral production to below the detection limit, suggesting that NO is an important factor in controlling astrovirus infection. The importance of macrophages and their role in astrovirus infection has been corroborated by observations in astrovirus-infected lambs, where EM showed virions within macrophages. Furthermore, it is possible that astroviruses have a mechanism to combat this response, as macrophages in astrovirus-infected turkeys demonstrate a reduced ability to phagocytose.",

            "text": "Because astrovirus infection is generally mild and self-limiting in humans, treatment is generally restricted to fluid rehydration therapy. This can often be accomplished at home; thus, hospital admittance is rare. No vaccine is yet available for humans, and as noted above, immunoglobulin treatment for immunocompromised individuals has been met with varying degrees of success. Additionally, no treatment for astrovirus-infected animals exists. The best solution, therefore, is prevention of transmission, which is best done in humans by conscientious hand and food washing. The stability of astroviruses and their resistance to inactivation make them difficult to eliminate after introduction. This is a significant problem in hospitals, where individuals are generally immunocompromised and therefore more susceptible to infection. One outbreak in a bone marrow transplant ward prompted the hospital to scrub the entire ward with warm, soapy water. However, surveillance of the subsequent inhabitants demonstrated fecal shedding of astroviruses, underscoring the difficulty in removing the virus. This is also a significant problem in commercial farming, where astrovirus infection of animals significantly decreases productivity. Its introduction and maintenance in this environment can mean drastic financial losses. In each of these environments, early detection and thorough disinfection are keys to limiting transmission and controlling infection.",
