            "text": "The mystery of the etiology of Kawasaki disease (KD), a self-limited, systemic vasculitis of children, remains unsolved after 130 years since its original English language description [1] . An infectious cause has long been suspected, because of discrete seasonal peaks [2] , focal epidemics with a wavelike spread of illness [3] , and the acute onset of such clinical features as fever, rash, conjunctival injection, and cervical adenitis resembling other infectious diseases. The peak incidence is in the toddler age group, with only rare cases in adults and in infants !3 months of age, which suggests a ubiquitous agent to which adults are immune and against which young infants are protected by passive maternal antibodies. A study by Rowley et al. suggests an antigendriven immune response to an etiologic agent with a respiratory portal of entry [4] . However, conventional bacterial and viral cultures and serologic investigations have failed to establish an infectious cause [5] [6] [7] [8] . These studies included 2 members of the human coronaviruses (HCoVs), HCoV-229E and -OC43 [5, 6] , a diverse group of RNA viruses that cause respiratory tract disease [9] .",

Using reversetranscriptase (RT) polymerase chain reaction (PCR) with primers that also amplified HCoV-NL63 (GenBank accession numbers NC_005831 and AY518894), the investigators detected viral sequences in respiratory secretions from 8 of 11 patients with acute KD but only 1 of 22 age-matched, contemporaneous control subjects. HCoV-NH and -NL63 have identical sequences in the primer binding sites for the spike glycoprotein gene [10] , and phylogenetic analysis of a 126-bp region in the open-reading frame (ORF) 1a gene [11] shows minimal variation between isolates. Thus, we will refer to these viruses collectively as HCoV-NL63/NH, which was first detected by RT-PCR and culture in respiratory secretions from infants with lower respiratory tract dis-ease in The Netherlands [12, 13] . Our collaborative, multiinstitutional investigation tested the possible association between HCoV-NL63 in the respiratory tract and acute KD by RT-PCR and viral culture of respiratory samples from a larger, geographically and ethnically diverse population.",

Scraped NP epithelial cells were obtained with a Rhinoprobe curette (Arlington Scientific). Cells were eluted into viral transport medium and either were processed directly for RNA isolation or were washed twice in PBS, collected by centrifugation, and stored at \u03ea70\u040aC until RNA extraction. Nasal washes were performed by forceful instillation of 2 mL of sterile saline (0.9% NaCl) into a nostril by use of a syringe and subsequent aspiration of the same nostril to obtain a deep NP sample. All but 2 samples were stored at \u03ea70\u040aC in TRIzol reagent until RNA was extracted; the remaining 2 samples were stored for 1-2 weeks at 4\u040aC before RNA extraction. Five centers (University of California, San Diego [UCSD], La Jolla, California; Vanderbilt University, Nashville, Tennessee; Loyola University, Maywood, Illinois; Northwestern University, Chicago, Illinois; and the AMC) extracted RNA from the samples and either (1) synthesized cDNA followed by PCR or nested PCR and analysis by ethidium-bromide-stained gel or (2) performed quantitative PCR using either a TaqMan probe or SYBR Green fluorescence (Applied Biosystems). Fifteen different primer (and probe) sets had binding sites located in the HCoV-NL63 nucleocapsid protein gene (primer sets A-C [13] , N, O, and R), HCoV-NL63 ORF1b (primer sets D-F and M and primer set P with nested primer set Q [12] ), HCoV-NH ORF1a (primer set J [10] ), and the HCoV-NH spike glycoprotein gene (primer set K with nested primer set L [10] ). Three additional degenerate primer sets (G-I) were designed on the basis of conserved regions of the RNA polymerase and helicase in ORF1b, which are shared by HCoV-NL63, severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)-CoV (Gen-Bank accession number NC_004718), HCoV-E229 (GenBank accession number NC_002645), and HCoV-OC43 (GenBank accession number NC_005147). For details on assay conditions, reagents, and primer sequences, see Appendix A, in the electronic edition (letter code for primer pairs refers to the list in Appendix A). All samples were also tested using primers and probes for either human glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (Applied Biosystems), porphobilinogen deaminase (primer/probe set T), or b-2-microglobulin (primer set U [16] ), to check the quality and quantity of extracted RNA. Each RT-PCR included appropriate positive and negative controls. Positive control templates for HCoV-NL63 PCR were either clinical isolates of HCoV-NL63 RNA [13] (gift from Ron Fouchier, Erasmus Medical Center, Rotterdam, The Netherlands) or Topo-NL63 nucleocapsid protein gene plasmid (gift from Ralph Baric, University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill). The positive control template for the degenerate CoV PCR assays was cDNA from SARS-CoV (gift from Michael Buchmeier and Benjamin Neuman, Scripps Research Institute, La Jolla, California). The sensitivity of the PCR assays was assessed by testing 10-fold serial dilutions of known quantities of either RNA derived from HCoV-NL63 culture supernatants, Topo-NL63 nucleocapsid protein gene plasmid, or PCR products from each primer set.",

[10] . The presence of PCR inhibitors as a possible cause of negative results was excluded by successful amplification of cellular RNA from all samples. The 1 positive sample yielded an amplification product with all of the primer sets used: HCoV ORF1b degenerate primer sets G-I, HCoV-NL63 nucleocapsid protein primer sets A-C, and HCoV-NL63 ORF1b primer sets D-F, as well as with the HCoV-NH ORF1a primer set J [10] . The sequences of the amplification products from the primer sets (for A, C, F, and J, 123 bp, 99 bp, 106 bp, and 215 bp, respectively) matched the sequence for HCoV-NL63. The patient, a 5-year-old Bangladeshi American boy, met 4 of 5 classic clinical criteria for KD. In addition, he had symptoms of an upper respiratory tract infection (cough and coryza). Throat culture for b-hemolytic group A streptococcus was negative. Viral cultures for common respiratory pathogens and monkey kidney cell cultures for HCoV were negative. An NP swab for PCR testing was obtained on the seventh day of illness, before administration of intravenous immunoglobulin and aspirin. The patient responded with complete defervescence, but his respiratory symptoms persisted.

To ensure detection of either virus, degenerate primers were designed (primer sets G-I), and 2 of the primer sets (primer set J and primer set K with nested primer set L) used in our study were identical to the primer sets used to detect HCoV-NH by Esper et al. [10] . The single positive HCoV-NL63 molecular isolate from a patient with acute KD yielded an amplification product with all primers tested, including the HCoV-NH ORF1a primers from Esper et al., making it unlikely that we missed HCoV-NH because of sequence divergence from HCoV-NL63. In all, 12 throat swabs, 2 scraped NP epithelial cell samples, and 1 NP swab were tested using the HCoV-NH ORF1a primers, and 12 throat swabs and 2 scraped NP epithelial cell samples were tested using the HCoV-NH spike glycoprotein primers [10] . Differences in geographic region, definition of cases, respiratory sites sampled, selection bias, and PCR methods may explain the differences between our findings and those of Esper et al. [10] . First, the Esper study included only frozen, archived nasal washes from New Haven, Connecticut, and 6 of 8 samples positive by RT-PCR were collected from January to April of 2004 (F. Esper, personal communication). This suggests the possibility of a CoV outbreak in New Haven that could have caused coincidental infection in children with KD. Arguing against this possibility is that control children sampled within 2 weeks of the patients with KD did not show a similarly high rate of HCoV detection.",

It is possible that sample collection methods affect the rate of detection of HCoV-NL63. In Canada, HCoV-NL63 was detected in 6 (6.5%) of 92 NP swabs versus 8 (2.8%) of 284 throat or pharyngeal swabs collected from patients with acute respiratory tract infections [18] . However, in the case of SARS-CoV, rates of viral detection by RT-PCR did not differ significantly among NP swabs, throat swabs, and NP aspirates [17] .

Esper et al. detected HCoV-NH in 79 (8.8%) of 895 children with respiratory symptoms who were negative for RSV, influenza viruses A and B, human parainfluenza viruses 1-3, and adenovirus by DFA [11] . The detection rate for HCoV-NL63 was highest in children !5 years of age [18] , which coincides with the peak age group for KD. Thus, coexisting HCoV-NL63 infection in children with KD may occur, especially during winter. A wide variety of respiratory viruses have been occasionally isolated from patients with KD [8, 20, 21] . The one patient with KD in the present study who was positive for HCoV-NL63 had prominent respiratory symptoms not characteristic of KD, including copious rhinorrhea and cough. Therefore, this patient had coexisting, symptomatic HCoV-NL63 upper respiratory tract infection.",
