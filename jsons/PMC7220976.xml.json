            "text": "Mechanical ventilation can be live-saving in the neonatal period but is also associated with complications such as bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) and chronic respiratory morbidity [1]. Modes of ventilation that allow synchrony both of the timing and the level of support to the infant\u2019s respiratory effort have been developed. Both proportional assist ventilation (PAV) and neurally adjusted ventilator assist (NAVA) provide support synchronised throughout the respiratory cycle. PAV delivers support proportional to the infant\u2019s respiratory effort. Inspiratory pressure can be delivered in proportion to the change in flow (resistive unloading) and the change in tidal volume (elastic unloading), and the clinician can adjust the amount of unloading used [2]. The support delivered by NAVA is proportional to the electrical activity of the diaphragm, which is reflective of the neural respiratory drive. NAVA uses a specialised nasogastric tube with an electrode array at the distal end which detects the electromyogram of the diaphragm (Edi). The Edi is the signal used to trigger the ventilator and determines the level of support. The delivered pressure throughout each inflation is in proportion to the Edi signal. The clinician can adjust the NAVA level to increase or decrease the amount of pressure delivered per microvolt of Edi detected [3, 4].",

There are no studies in that population comparing PAV and NAVA, and hence the aim of this study was to compare the effect of PAV and NAVA on the oxygenation index in infants with evolving or established BPD. It has been demonstrated in an in vitro study that PAV was associated with a relatively long trigger delay [17]. In studies in adults, longer trigger delays have been found with PAV compared to NAVA [18, 19]. Hence, we hypothesised that NAVA would be associated with a superior (i.e. lower) OI in a crossover study as more of the infant\u2019s respiratory cycle would be supported by pressure support.",

We used the \u201cOI\u201d as the primary outcome as this gives a summary of the effectiveness of each ventilator mode compared to baseline. The mean airway pressure, however, was lower and the FiO2 higher on PAV than on NAVA. As the \u201cOI\u201d is a composite of the MAP and FiO2, then those differences being in the opposite direction resulted in similar \u201cOIs\u201d. The lower MAP on PAV resulted in a higher FiO2 requirement to maintain the same level of oxygenation. The lower MAP on PAV might reflect lower levels of synchrony, a different shape to the airway pressure waveform and/or a longer trigger delay [17\u201319]. The significantly higher \u201cA-a\u201d gradient (i.e. worse) on PAV compared to NAVA is consistent with the higher FiO2 requirement, as is the significantly lower SpO2/FiO2 (ie worse).

PAV as compared to pressure-controlled conventional ventilation has been shown to reduce the OI in infants with respiratory distress syndrome [5] and to reduce the OI, peak and MAP and the work of breathing (as measured by PTPdi) in infants with evolving or established BPD [6\u20138]. Although there have been no randomised controlled trials of PAV in neonates, in adults, PAV versus pressure support ventilation resulted in a shorter duration of intensive care days [9]. NAVA has also been shown to have advantages over conventional ventilation in prematurely born infants. NAVA compared to pressure control ventilation and to pressure-limited synchronised intermittent mandatory ventilation (SIMV) in crossover studies, including those where infants had longer durations on each mode, resulted in lower peak inspiratory pressures (PIP) and a reduction in the work of breathing [10\u201313]. In prematurely born infants with evolving or established BPD, NAVA compared to pressure control ventilation in a crossover study resulted in reduction in the OI, MAP, FiO2 and PIP [14]. There has been one randomised controlled trial of NAVA, which was compared to pressure control ventilation and enrolled infants born between 28 and 36 + 6 weeks gestational age with acute respiratory distress. There was no significant difference in the primary outcome of the duration of ventilation (35 versus 26 h, p = 0.21). There was also no difference in the incidence of BPD, but the study was not powered to detect this [15].",

The OI was not reported, but when targeting the same tidal volumes, the PIP and MAP were higher on NAVA than on PAV with comparable blood gases, although the PaCO2 was statistically significantly higher on PAV than on NAVA, as was also found in our study. The small increase in PaCO2 may be due to the way that NAVA and PAV switch to back up ventilation after an apnoea period or to the amount of unloading during PAV and the NAVA level set. If either were to be used for longer periods, then careful monitoring and adjustment of settings as required would be advised.",

We calculated the \u201cOI\u201d and \u201cA-a\u201d gradients from capillary samples, but this was a crossover study, so each infant acted as their own control. Thus, whilst arterial samples may have been more precise, we suggest that use of capillary blood samples would not have substantially influenced our results. We did not use arterialisation of the capillary samples as there is controversy in the literature as to whether this improves the correlations with arterial results. Furthermore, capillary blood gases have been shown to correlate well with arterial gases if infants are stable and not cardiovascularly compromised [26], particularly at lower levels of arterial oxygenation as in our cohort [27]. Additionally, it has been shown that in infants with congenital diaphragmatic hernia, indices of oxygenation obtained from capillary blood gas samples and changes in these indices over time predict survival, thus suggesting that capillary oxygenation is a valid method of monitoring clinical status [28]. Nevertheless, for future studies, transcutaneous monitoring of carbon dioxide and oxygen levels could be considered. We did not assess the infants\u2019 comfort levels, and this plus assessment of the degree of asynchrony would be useful in future studies.",

Using the manufacturer\u2019s guidelines, the MAP level during NAVA was decreased compared to baseline setting suggesting that the level was appropriate. All of the infants in our study either had or were subsequently diagnosed with BPD, indicating that our inclusion criteria successfully identified those with evolving or established BPD. The wide range of postnatal ages in our study population may have influenced our results, but advantages of PAV and NAVA over conventional ventilation have been demonstrated in infants with a variety of postnatal ages in previous studies. Targeted tidal volumes of between 5 and 7 mls/kg were used, as studies have shown chronically ventilated infants may require 7 mls/kg [29, 30] and in the latter study (30) to reduce the work of breathing. It could be suggested that in babies with BPD 2-hour epochs may not be sufficient to demonstrate changes in oxygenation. Previous studies, however, have demonstrated changes in oxygenation using both modes for shorter epochs of 45\u201360 min [5, 6, 14]. Indeed, we were able to demonstrate improved oxygenation over baseline settings for both PAV and NAVA using 2 h epochs and differences in the two modes with regard to the A-a gradient. In one study [12], 12-h periods were used, but the order was not randomised. Although there were no significant differences in blood gases between NAVA and pressure-regulated volume control (PRVC), neural apnoeas were only seen during PRVC, and less fentanyl was administered during NAVA (12).",
