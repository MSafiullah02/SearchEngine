Subspecialists across multiple disciplines have also used telemedicine to increase access for patients seen in rural clinics. This has been associated with high levels of satisfaction among both patients and their primary care physicians 7 . In a study from the Veterans Administration, patients seeking care from the Greater Los Angeles area rated their satisfaction as \"very good\" to \"excellent\" in 95% of cases 8 . On average, patients saved 277 miles driven, $67 in travel-related expenses, and $126 in missed opportunity costs per telemedicine appointment 8 . Thus, this approach affords potential benefits to the environment and the economic well-being of patients, many of whom may have reduced earning potential in the wake of a pandemic. Medical specialties have recognized the growing need and potential of telemedicine for use in the outpatient setting, telesurgery, and telerounding. While some specialties have initiated telehealth visits successfully [8] [9] [10] [11] [12] [13] [14] , the issue of reimbursement has been noted to be the major barrier to implementation for many 15 . Amidst the COVID-19 pandemic, however, facilitating healthcare access in a safe setting became a priority as cities promoted social distancing. Telemedicine regulatory restrictions have been eased in the US in an effort to promote safety for patients, their family members, and healthcare professionals, and to avoid health care service delays that may compromise future health. As a result, many practices are now finding themselves forced to acclimate to the sudden and broad implementation of telemedicine platforms, and the learning process can frustrate patients, providers, support staff, and the healthcare system.",

The nursing staff calls patients approximately 1 week ahead of their appointment to confirm their preferred method of audiovisual connection. Depending on the device, our staff will send instructions on how to download the necessary applications and access MyChart.com (see eDocument 1). Fifteen minutes before the telemedicine appointment time, a member of our nursing staff calls the patient to confirm connectivity and then completes a review of patient history, medications, and allergies. This information is entered into the chart exactly as during an in-person encounter. The provider is then fully equipped to initiate an efficient telemedicine visit at the scheduled appointment time.",

Access to healthcare services was preserved with the ability to discriminate more accurately which patients required an in-person visit. In addition, involvement of our nursing and office staff within the telemedicine visit structure was instrumental in maintaining 75% of employment hours for our staff. As staff members interface with patients on the telephone to convert in-person visits to telemedicine, they served as important ambassadors for programmatic success.",

Our anecdotal experience is that patients who are older and less educated require significantly more nursing or office staff instruction on how to connect via telemedicine and the recruitment of a younger family member can be very helpful. Flexibility in video connection options has been paramount although the majority have been able to successfully connect via a simple link sent through the Doximity video application function. Review of our Press Ganey scores have remained consistently high during this time especially with regards to patient satisfaction with ease of scheduling appointments, concern of nursing staff toward the patient's problem, satisfaction with his or her provider, and likelihood of recommending our practice to others. We attribute this success in large part to having a comprehensive toolkit which eased the transition for our staff.",

G2012 -Virtual check-in is a brief (minimum of 5 minutes) established patient telephone check-in with a physician or advanced practice provider (APP) to decide whether an office visit or other service is needed. For example, a patient calls with complaints of an acute urinary tract infection. The provider empirically sends treatment to pharmacy and verbally advises the patient to schedule an appointment if symptoms don't respond in 48 hours. The origin for the virtual check-in visit cannot be from a E/M service within the previous 7 days, and cannot lead to an E/M service or procedure within the next 24 hours or soonest available appointment, and this has to be documented for each virtual check-in encounter. Additional documentation requirements include consent for the visit, confirmation of patient identity and established patient status, details of encounter to establish medical necessity, and total amount of time. One can only submit G2012 if a minimum of 5 minutes of direct communication was achieved.",
