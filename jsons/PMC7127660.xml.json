The purpose of having the access coordinators employed regionally allows for greater flexibility during times of crisis, and the advantage of this is outlined in the case report presented. At each hospital the access coordinators facilitate meetings each morning where they discuss daily bed utilization, which supports the plan for the day. The meetings are generally short, lasting about 15 minutes, and information from each unit is brought to the meeting by a charge nurse, coordinator or the manager. Information about discharges, complex cases, and expected admissions is pertinent, as the hospital liaison nurses from the community are also present. The bed meeting ensures that patients from the operating room are accommodated and movement of patients out of the emergency room and intensive care unit is achieved.",
