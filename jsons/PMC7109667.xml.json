In a recent survey of Kansas feedlots, there seemed to be a trend for increased death losses in feedlot cattle over the last decade (Babcock et al., 2006), and BRD was the leading cause of morbidity and mortality in a cross-sectional survey sent to 561 feedlots in 21 states (Woolums et al., 2005). Mortality from BRD and the expense of medicine and labor to treat BRD contribute to its negative economic and animal welfare costs, but feedlot performance and carcass merit also are affected negatively by BRD (Gardner et al., 1999), magnifying its economic consequences.",

Feed intake by stressed calves is low (Galyean and Hubbert, 1995; Cole, 1996), and low nutrient intake likely augments the negative effects of stress on immune function.",

Of the bacterial species, Pasteurella (Mannheimia) haemolytica, Pasteurella multocida, and Histophilus somni (formerly Haemophilus sommus) are of primary concern, with Mannheimia haemolytica serotype 1 being the organism most commonly associated with BRD (Pandher et al., 1998). In addition, viral agents, including infectious bovine rhinotraceitis (IBR), parainfluenza-3 (PI3), bovina viral diarrhea virus (BVDV), bovine respiratory syncytial virus (BRSV), and bovine enteric coronavirus have been associated with respiratory tract disease in feedlot calves (Plummer et al., 2004). Bovine adenovirus serotype 7 infections have been found in commingled calves and may be more common in calves with concurrent infections with other viruses (Fent et al., 2002). In Europe, Mycoplasma bovis is responsible for at least 25 to 33% of all pneumonia cases in calves suffering from BRD (Gevaert, 2006).",

Pulmonary lesions indicative of BRD were present at slaughter in 68% of steers that were not treated for BRD, whereas lesions were present in 78% of treated steers (Wittum et al., 1996a). Similarly, in South African feedlots, Thompson et al. (2006) reported that 42.8% of all animals had lung lesions at slaughter, and of the animals with lung lesions at slaughter, 69.5% had never been treated for BRD. We previously suggested (Galyean et al., 1999) that a valuable tool for monitoring BRD diagnosis and treatment would be evaluation of lung lesions at slaughter. Bryant et al. (1999) provided a method for recording pulmonary lesions at slaughter; however, implementation in commercial settings is not common, and few published research studies have scored pulmonary lesions as an indicator of treatment or diagnosis of BRD. Failure to detect morbid animals using current protocols for diagnosis may be related to predator/prey behavior (Noffsinger and Locatelli, 2004), in that if the animals perceive the personnel handling the animals as predators, they will mask the signs of weakness (e.g., depression, illness, lameness, etc.). Therefore, development and implementation of quantitative measures to detect BRD is critical, and several possible candidates will be discussed in the subsequent sections.",

Other methods include antigen-capture ELISA, virus neutralization, microplate virus isolation, and reverse-transcriptase PCR (RT-PCR) assays (Dubovi, 1996). Viral isolations from blood leukocytes or serum also can be used to identify PI BVDV animals. The time to complete these tests varies among laboratories, but the process can take approximately 10 d. In addition to assay costs, costs associated with sample collection, animal handling, sample shipment, etc. can be significant, and it is likely cost-prohibitive to sample all calves received in a given lot. The IHC test seems reliable, and calves recently vaccinated with modified live vaccines have not caused false positives (DuBois et al., 2000); however, skin biopsy samples cannot be pooled, thereby increasing costs. Larson et al. (2005) suggested using RT-PCR on pooled blood samples (30 animals), followed by an IHC test only on animals represented in the pooled samples that returned positive assay results. This 2-test strategy might be cost effective, but it would increase the lag time in detecting PI BVDV calves and increase the time they would be commingled with other cattle.",

Initial reports suggested that haptoglobin concentration was unrelated to the severity of the case or the need for treatment in feedlot cattle (Wittum et al., 1996b), but subsequent results suggest that haptoglobin may have value for assessing morbidity (Carter et al., 2002). Berry et al. (2004a) reported that serum haptoglobin concentrations may be useful in predicting the number of treatments required by calves, and Wittum et al. (1996b) and Carter et al.

Dietary changes in energy and starch concentration had little effect on acute-phase protein response (Berry et al., 2004a); however, Cu status of the animal may be related to acute-phase proteins before and during an inflammatory challenge (Arthington et al., 2003b).",

(2005) suggested that based on a 45-d postweaning preconditioning program cow/calf producers can realize a $14.00 increase in returns compared with the sale of calves at weaning that are not preconditioned, and that feedlot producers also can benefit from such programs and can afford to pay premiums for preconditioned calves. Roeber et al. (2001) reported morbidity rates (cattle requiring at least 1 hospital visit) of 34.7, 36.7, and 77.3% and mortality of 1.1, 1.1, and 11.4% for cattle that had been subjected to 2 different preconditioning programs in Kentucky compared with auction-barn calves, respectively. Preconditioning calves on ryegrass pastures resulted in greater ADG and decreased feed costs compared with preconditioning in a drylot (St. Louis et al., 2003), but it was not determined whether the improved performance on grass was a result of deceased morbidity or other factors. For pasture-based preconditioning programs, an effective antibiotic regimen and vaccination program should be followed, along with pastures designed for low-stress handling of morbid animals (St. Louis et al., 2003). Preconditioning seems to be a highly effective means of decreasing BRD morbidity, but its application is not widespread. The ultimate value of preconditioning programs is the ancillary benefit of decreased morbidity in the feedlot, which may not be realized by cow/calf or stocker producers. In addition, perhaps improved information flow regarding the background of the cattle will result from the greater national emphasis on individual animal identification and trace-back, which might stimulate the demand for preconditioned calves.",

Passive transfer of antibodies in colostrum is vital for the protection of the young calf against pathogens; however, high concentrations of maternally derived antibodies might interfere with the response to vaccination (Fulton et al., 2004). Zimmerman et al. (2006) reported that a single dose of a modified live vaccine containing BVDV administered at 4 to 5 wk of age stimulated a strong protective immune response to a challenge with virulent type 2 BVDV in calves in the presence of a high concentration of maternal antibodies against BVDV. Similarly, Patel (2005) evaluated a single intranasal vaccination with IBR and suggested the vaccine could provide significant protection in the face of maternally derived antibodies, and that this protection could be prolonged by a booster vaccination. Monitoring both cows and calves is necessary for effective vaccination protocols. Most vaccines used are inactivated (killed) because licensing issues prevent many modified live vaccines from being used on calves nursing pregnant cows. Current practices of vaccinating calves at branding, followed by boosters at or near weaning and at 2 to 4 wk after weaning with inactivated vaccines seem warranted (Fulton et al., 2004).",

            "text": "Castration is often a major stress imposed on newly received intact bulls. In addition, it is common to castrate bulls shortly after arrival at the feedlot at the same time that other stresses are imposed (e.g., vaccinations, horn tipping, restraint, etc.). Daniels et al. (2000) reported that calves that were castrated on arrival had a 92% greater incidence of morbidity and 3.5 vs. 0% mortality compared with those castrated before entering the feedlot. Previously castrated calves gain 0.52 kg/d ADG during a 21-d receiving period vs. 0.21 kg/d for cattle castrated on arrival. Although daily feeding and watering behaviors were not affected by castration, calves castrated before arrival had more feeding and watering bouts per day than calves castrated on arrival (Daniels et al., 2000). Age of castration also is important. As the age of castration gets closer to birth, less weight is lost for the 30-d period after castration (Bretschneider, 2005). Cow/calf producers cite concerns about decreased weaning weight (Lents et al., 2006) as a reason for not castrating bulls; however, Lents et al. (2006) reported that intact bulls did not have an advantage in BW at 6 to 7 mo of age compared with bulls banded at birth or bulls banded at birth and implanted with 36 mg of zeranol. In addition, BW gain at weaning was decreased for at least 30 d when castration was delayed to later than 6 mo of age. Thus, producers concerned about decreased weaning weight because of castration could use estrogenic implants in suckling calves to maximize BW gain (Lents et al., 2006).",

Cattle receiving chlortetracycline gained BW during the period that the antibiotic was fed, whereas the cattle not receiving the antibiotic lost weight during the same period. Including chlortetracycline in the feed near to the time of an outbreak of BRD might prove beneficial, but feed intake must be adequate to provide the proper dose of antibiotic. If feed intake of these cattle is an issue, antibiotics need to be injected to ensure the animal receives a sufficient quantity of the antibiotic.",

The classical work by Lofgreen (1983a), using a combination of long-acting oxytetracycline and sustained-release sulfadimethoxine, showed that morbidity was decreased from 63.3% in control calves to 7.1% in mass-medicated calves. Numerous studies have demonstrated that tilmicosin phosphate is effective for decreasing morbidity of newly received, stressed cattle (Galyean et al., 1995; Cusack, 2004; Guthrie et al., 2004), and preshipping medication programs do not seem to be more effective than arrival medication programs (Duff et al., 2000). Similary, Frank et al. (2002) reported that administration of florfenicol at arrival decreased the incidence of BRD and suggested that prophylactic use of antibiotics may be a means to decrease acute BRD for several days after arrival in the feedlot. More recently, tulathromycin was effective in decreasing the incidence of BRD when given before the onset of symptoms in high-risk cattle (Rooney et al., 2005).",

All isolates tested were susceptible to ceftiofur and sulfachlorpyridazine. Pasteurella haemolytica isolates were resistant to ampicillin, penicillin, sulfadimethoxine, tetracycline, and tylosin. Pasteurella multocida isolates were resistant to sulfadimethoxine, tetracycline, and tylosin. A study conducted in the European Union examined the sensitivity of the major BRD bacteria [M. haemolytica, P. multocida, and H. somni (formerly H. somnus)] to commonly used antimicrobials (florfenicol, tilmicosin, and tulathromycin) using disc-diffusion methods (Montgomery, 2005). Bacterial samples were collected from cattle involved in field clinical studies of respiratory disease. The bacterial isolates included 367 M. haemolytica, 245 P. multocida, and 99 H. somni samples. The 711 different bacterial strains tested showed complete susceptibility to florfenicol, and a number of strains were resistant to or showed intermediate susceptibility to tilmicosin and tulathromycin.

When given a choice among feed mixtures varying in concentrate level during the first week after arrival at the feedlot, stressed calves selected diets with 72% concentrate (Lofgreen, 1983b).

Serum IgG concentrations were greater before and after the challenge in cattle fed the hay-based diets during backgrounding.

Relationships between dietary roughage concentration (DM basis) and receiving-period morbidity, ADG, and DMI were evaluated with mixed-model regression methods. Morbidity (e.g., percentage of calves treated for BRD using visual observation and rectal temperature as a means of diagnosis) decreased slightly as dietary roughage concentration increased [morbidity, % = 49.59 \u2212 (0.0675 \u00d7 roughage, %); P = 0.003]. The ADG and DMI were affected negatively (P < 0.001) by increasing the dietary roughage concentration, and economic analysis indicated that the slightly lesser morbidity noted with greater roughage concentrations would not offset the loss in profit resulting from decreased ADG. Rivera et al.

Dai et al. (1998) reviewed the effects of nutrition on host responses to mycobacteria and concluded that with diseases like tuberculosis, protein malnutrition resulted in the loss of T-lymphocyte functions and cell-mediated resistance. Moreover, they suggested that generation, migration, or maturation of monocytes was negatively affected by protein deficiency, and that secretion of cytokines (interleukin-2 and interferon-\u03b3) by these cells was impaired in protein-deficient animals. Conversely, transforming growth factor-\u03b2 production by macrophages infected with Mycobacterium tuberculosis was increased in protein deficiency, which resulted in immunosuppressive effects. Thus, severe protein malnutrition can result in negative effects on immune function. Protein and energy deficiency are often confounded through negative effects of low-protein diets on energy intake, however, and attributing the effects on immunity noted in many experiments solely to protein deficiency is probably incorrect.",

We further suggested that the effects of dietary CP concentration on immune function needed to be assessed; however, to our knowledge this has yet to be fully accomplished.",

In early weaned calves fed Bermudagrass hay (6.7% CP, DM basis) alone or hay plus soybean meal at 0.175 or 0.35% of BW, ADG and DMI were increased during an 84-d backgrounding period by the supplemental protein, but no difference was found between the 2 supplemental protein levels (Whitney et al., 2006). When challenged with an intranasal dose of BHV-1, calves previously fed supplemental protein had greater average rectal temperatures for d 1, 2, 4, and 5 after the challenge than calves previously fed hay alone. Serum IgG concentrations after the virus challenge were not affected by protein supplementation. Considering the results of Whitney et al. (2006), and our previous observation (Galyean et al., 1999), calves fed greater CP diets might have an increased likelihood of being diagnosed with BRD as a result of elevated body temperature. Nonetheless, our suggestion that additional research is needed on the effects of dietary CP concentration on immune function in stressed cattle still seems to have merit.",

Semba (1999) reviewed the role of vitamin A in immunity and clinical outcomes of various human diseases. The efficacy of supplemental vitamin A in human trials has varied considerably, and trials with lower-tract respiratory infections have not shown marked clinical benefits (Semba, 1999). With respect to BRD, it would be important to provide vitamin A to calves that have a known deficiency or are potentially marginal in vitamin A status, with injection of vitamin A likely being the most rapid means of increasing body stores.

(1995) compared a no-ionophore control diet with diets containing lasalocid at 33 mg/kg, and monensin at 22 or 33 mg/ kg of the dietary DM. Ionophores decreased (P < 0.08) DMI compared with the control diet for the 28-d trial, but ADG and the efficiency of gain were not altered by treatments. Numerically, monensin at 33 mg/kg resulted in a lower DMI than lasalocid at the same concentration. All 3 ionophore treatments decreased the presence of coccidial oocysts. Thus, ionophores might have negative effects on DMI in newly received cattle, but these effects can be moderated by the choice of ionophore or, with monensin, by decreasing the dietary concentration.",

The effects of PI BVDV on transmission of virus and performance may be important in the development of BRD, but more research is needed. Our ability to diagnose BRD is less than optimal, and development of cost-effective, quantitative methods to more accurately detect animals afflicted with or likely to develop BRD would be valuable to the beef cattle industry. Preconditioning programs offer significant potential to decrease the incidence of BRD, and programs should include vaccination for viral agents and castration of bull calves. Metaphylactic antimicrobial programs continue to be an effective management option for high-risk beef calves, but close attention should be given to antimicrobial resistance, and alternative methods for prevention and/or treatment of calves for BRD deserve attention.",

After decades of research, our ability to modify the incidence of BRD through nutritional manipulations seems limited. The same nutritional program applied to different groups of cattle under seemingly similar conditions may result in widely different rates of BRD morbidity. Based on our review, we recommend that the nutrient content of diets for newly received cattle be formulated to adjust for the low feed intake associated with stress. Adding greater concentrations of vitamin E may be beneficial for decreasing BRD, but research results with trace minerals are variable. Diets with increased energy density (e.g., increased concentrate feeds) that are formulated to provide adequate protein and other nutrients are likely to increase ADG and G:F compared with low-energy receiving diets, without substantially altering the occurrence of BRD.",
