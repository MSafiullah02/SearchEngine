These modeller-selected features permit fine-tuned adjustment of oscillations for the purpose of matching a dataset, and periodic forcing terms, in particular, can permit the teasing apart of different contributors to disease incidence. Still, a chicken-and-egg question must be asked: should observed oscillations in the data cause us to construct a model in which periodic behaviour is guaranteed, or should a model written without the expectation of periodicity be permitted to display oscillation, or not, depending on its parameter values and underlying demographics?",

Sustained oscillations in differential equations-based SIR and related models are frequently described using delay differential equations, periodic forcing terms involving sine or cosine functions, and/or age structure. The marvellous 2000 review paper by Hethcote [5] describes seven articles that model sustained oscillation in epidemics, and all seven use one or more of these approaches. It is also frequently the case that modellers keep total population size constant. The sustained oscillation discussion in Hethcote [5] does not refer to models with non-constant population size.",

As a follow-up, he uses [7] to show that stochasticity in model demographics\u2014a staple in any real-world dataset\u2014can sustain oscillations indefinitely. In Chapter 11, Bauch describes models having sustained oscillations as involving either exogenous or endogenous mechanisms. An exogenous mechanism, typically periodic forcing of the transmission term, explicitly introduces oscillations into the model. Endogenous mechanisms instead destabilize the model\u2019s endemic equilibrium. The most frequent examples of endogenous mechanisms are age structure or delay terms. Other examples include stochastic approaches, or a non-constant contact rate of infectious and susceptible individuals.",

Such a model keeps the transmission parameter constant, along with all other parameters that directly represent aspects of smallpox: the basic reproduction number R0, length of infectivity, percentage of deaths due to smallpox. Only the parameters for overall births and non-smallpox deaths in the population vary, their values determined by annual computations based on historical demographic data, with annual values interpolated using straight lines to prevent discontinuous inputs to the system of differential equations. Periodic or quasi-periodic oscillations from such a reduced and simple model can then point to the fundamental ingredients of oscillatory dynamics in disease outbreaks.",

A formula for oscillation period in the autonomous model is analytically determined, and parameter values for the autonomous model are obtained through a combination of wavelet analysis and simulation-based experiments. Ultimately, the analytically determined formula for oscillation period, when computed with the obtained parameter values, is shown to be consistent with demographic data. Overall this study demonstrates that (i) a simple dynamical model with time-varying births and deaths is sufficient to explain sustained periodicity of outbreaks, and (ii) demographic and disease outbreak data can be used to constrain model parameters such as the infection parameter, \u03b2.",

The CDC lists several phases of smallpox infection, along with how contagious an infected person is during each phase [13]. Taking these sequentially, smallpox is most contagious for approximately 14 days, and the total contagious period could be as much as 24 days. This means individuals remain in the I compartment 14 to 24 days; on an annual time scale, individuals remain in I for 14/365 to 24/365 years. Therefore, \u03bc \u2208 [(365/24), (365/14)]. About 30% of infected individuals historically have died of smallpox [18], signifying that about 70% of the individuals who leave I subsequently move to the R compartment. Therefore, set \u03b5 = 0.3\u03bc and \u03b3 = 0.7\u03bc, or set \u03b5 \u2248 0.3\u03bc and \u03b3 = \u03bc \u2212 \u03b5. A word of caution to the modeller: permitting CDC values for infection length to be used for \u03b3 alone, that is letting \u03b3 \u2208 [(365/24), (365/14)], and simultaneously permitting \u03b5 to equal an additional 30% of the value of \u03b3, results in a combined removal rate from I that is higher than indicated by demographic data.",

In particular, the dataset for Hida is 81 years, the dataset for British India is 51 years, and the dataset for Sweden spans only 26 years. Further advantageous for Hida is that it is a relatively small and homogeneous population in a small geographical region. For these reasons, the Hida dataset appears to best lend itself toward this analysis. Hida\u2019s peaks of smallpox incidence are clearest, rising the most in comparison with non-peak years and spanning just one to two calendar years. For contrast, while oscillation is noticeable in the British India and Sweden datasets, it is yet true that smallpox incidence in those regions encompasses a much larger geographical area, so that outbreaks spread spatially and therefore take up multiple years apiece. This smooths and spreads out some of the effects of oscillation. Length of dataset affects the oscillation periods modelled using demographic data, such as in figure 5, where the pattern is quite similar in period lengths for Hida and British India, but the smaller Sweden dataset leads to more variation in period lengths as R0 and \u03bc change.",
