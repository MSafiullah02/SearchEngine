Although the estimated mortality rate of avian influenza A H5N1 virus infection in humans could be as high as 60%, the World Health Organization (WHO) phase of pandemic alert is currently set at 3, due to that there has not been human-to-human or community-level transmission (http://www.who.int/influenza/preparedness/pandemic/h5n1phase/en/index.html). However, the newly created H5N1 virus strains, which are genetically altered, are transmissible among ferrets, and thus may trigger a real pandemic that could potentially result in millions of deaths according to Science Insider3. While it is arguably a bit too late to debate whether regulations or mandatory reviews should be applied to these dual-use studies, in the matter of fact, these viruses that are probably among the most dangerous infectious agents known already exist. Therefore, a top priority at present is to find effective prophylactic or therapeutic agents that would help to control a pandemic of avian influenza A H5N1 viruses.",

Currently, CQ and its hydroxyl form, HCQ, are used as anti-inflammatory agents for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis, lupus erythematosus and amoebic hepatitis. More recently, CQ has been studied for its potential use as an enhancing agent in cancer therapies as well as novel antagonists to chemokine receptor CXCR4 in pancreatic cancer8,9.",

The cell viability was improved both prophylactically and therapeutically in a dose-dependent manner with CQ treatments, and the efficacy of CQ was much higher than that of the potent autophagy inhibitor 3-methyladenine (3-MA) (Figure 1A). Next, we tested the potential therapeutic effect of CQ in a mouse model of live H5N1 infections. We found that when CQ was administered therapeutically at a dose equivalent to that for human clinical use, the survival rate of H5N1 virus-infected mice was improved dramatically (from 0% to 70% at day 8 post infection), and the body weight changes also showed a trend of improvement, but prophylactic application of CQ showed no protective effect (Figure 1B and 1C). We analyzed the lung histopathology in these mice and found fewer infiltrating leukocytes in the CQ therapeutic group, but not in the CQ prophylactic group (Figure 1D). Lung edema, as determined by the increased wet/dry weight ratio of lung tissue, was also significantly reduced by therapeutic CQ treatment, but not by prophylactic CQ treatment (Figure 1E). Taken together, our results demonstrate that CQ, a known autophagy inhibitor that is in clinical use, could efficiently ameliorate acute lung injury and dramatically improve the survival rate in mice infected with live avian influenza A H5N1 virus.",

As a lysosomotropic agent, CQ could prevent endosomal acidification, which might inhibit influenza virus endocytotic cell entry10,11. CQ was therefore proposed to be a candidate prophylactic agent for influenza virus. However, government-sponsored clinical trials have shown insufficient prophylactic effects against influenza infection12, which is consistent with our mouse results. CQ could also inhibit the innate immune responses through TLR signaling pathways and act as novel antagonists to chemokine receptor CXCR4 in pancreatic cancer9,13. We have shown that CQ treatment clearly inhibited the autophagy in mouse lung induced by avian influenza A H5N1 virus while the virus loads and proinflammatory cytokines were not significantly affected (Figure 1F, 1G, Supplementary information, Figure S1). Further studies are necessary to elucidate the precise molecular mechanisms by which CQ ameliorates murine acute lung injury induced by avian influenza A H5N1 virus.",
