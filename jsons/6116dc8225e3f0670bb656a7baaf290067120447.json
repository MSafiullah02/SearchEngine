Finally, on December 2019, for the first time in Wuhan city of China, a new type of coronavirus was identified with a human epidemic after people contracted pneumonia and vaccines and treatments were ineffective, so that named COVID-19 [4] . Depending on the type of coronavirus, symptoms can range from symptoms of common cold to fever, cough, shortness of breath and acute respiratory problems [5, 6] . The patient with COVID-19 may also have a few days of apparently unexplained coughs that affect not only the respiratory tract but also other vital organs of the body such as the kidney and liver. Acute gastrointestinal problems such as diarrhea, acute respiratory failure, coagulation disorders and acute renal failure have also been reported that may require hemodialysis [7] [8] [9] .

After Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) test through the nasopharyngeal swab and radiologic examination, she was hospitalized. The symptoms worsened and she was intubated on the second day. The patient was also pregnant with a gestational age of 34 weeks. The patient did not receive nephrotoxic drugs such as antibiotics before uremia, and when her BUN and Cr increased, the patient's urine became muddy brown and the volume of urine decreased, and we called it Acute kidney injury (AKI). In our urine sedimentation, there were a lot of granular casts along with cellular debris, which was interpreted as ATN. Due to the presence of urinary sedimentation and the presence of granuloma casts in the urine and muddy brown nature of urine, the diagnosis of ATN was more important than urinary toxicity. In spite of using Furosemide, urine output was 600 cc in 24 hours. After hemoperfusion, urine output reached above 2 liters in 24 hours and we entered the polyuria phase . However, Vancomycin was eliminated and Linzolid started for the patient because it is not nephrotoxic.",

The patient's respiratory rate increased to 36 breaths /minute and the patient was intubated. She underwent caesarean section after consultation with a gynecologist. he patient had to undergo dialysis 12 hours before caesarean section. The baby was negative for COVID-19 and was in good health. Due to the low platelet count, the patient entered the operating room with 10 platelet injections. Before surgery Hb was 7.25 mg/dl (Blood Pressure=100/66 mmHg, prothrombin time (PT) =16s, partial thromboplastin time (PTT) = 36s, Pco2=45 mmHg, Hco3=18 mEq/L) After surgery, hemoglobin had reached 7.8 mg/dl, which inevitably received a unit washed packed cell, and hemoglobin is now 9.5 mg/dl. White blood cell (WBC) increased to 7,400 per microliter. On the sixth day of hospitalization, diuresis was established, and the patient's creatinine declined sharply. The patient's creatinine had reached 3 mg/dl and conservative treatment was launched. The patient is still hospitalized due to COVID-19 and is in the recovery phase with fluid control and does not receive medication for her ATN.

Due to low studies in favor of kidney disease and COVID-19, it is hard to make decision in this regard, but what we've seen is the fact that ATN is treated by supportive measure [15] . Maybe routine measures are sufficient, so that kidney replacement therapy is another choice for the treatment of these patients if necessary. Indeed supportive measure can be efficient. So far, no effective antiviral drug was found to treat COVID-19 patients; therefore new drug cannot be named and prescribed without approved results [16] . Various viruses can cause ATN such as Lassa and others [17] , and in our case report, SARS-CoV-2 caused ATN. In pregnant women, the manifestation of chest graph does not differ so that the most common finding in corona-positive patients with pneumonia was GGO [18, 19] . The reported case had GGO in upper right lobe. The clinical manifestation of pregnant women with COVID-19 is the same other non-pregnant women [20] [21] [22] . Given these finding, we did the same and treat like other people. But regarding CT scan, we took it conservatively due to her pregnancy and getting low radiation. Taking chest X-ray was not limited and when it was necessary, we checked it. After delivery and checking the COVID-19 status in the neonate, we found that neonate are resistant to corona virus than of adults because PCR test was negative. Previously, two neonatal cases of COVID-19 have been reported without severe symptoms [23] . The risk of vertical transmission of novel corona virus is low but never reach zero and prevention measure in any levels should be adapted [23, 24] . The exact pathology of AKI in patients with COVID-19 was not known but the role of angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) was reported [25] . We know that AKI is happen infrequent in pregnant women. To prevent the development of AKI in patients with mild renal insufficiency such as increase in creatinine potentially can reduce the likelihood of AKI development. In this regard, we made a decision that the patient should undergo hemodialysis to prevent the development of AKI and fortunately we were successful [26] . In a study by Wang et al., SARS-CoV-2 RNA was found in 53 urine sediments through real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction [27] .",
