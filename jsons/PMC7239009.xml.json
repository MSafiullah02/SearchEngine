Yet we continue to lose biodiversity, locally, regionally, and globally. What is going on? Why is this still happening when apparently nobody wants it to? One possible contributing factor is that the status of biodiversity as a universal \u2018good thing\u2019 has meant that we have not had to think out clearly what exactly we mean by the term, why we need it, what we ourselves lose when biodiversity declines, and\u2014perhaps most importantly\u2014what we are prepared to do to protect it. Contrast the ongoing biodiversity crisis with the climate crisis, where these questions are readily answerable\u2014indeed, quantifiable\u2014and it is easy to see why it is climate change that tends to dominate the headlines and public attention. The aim of this review, therefore, is first to clarify the meaning of the term biodiversity and then to summarize the links between biodiversity and human wellbeing, with a focus on plants, and to assess the major gaps in our current efforts to protect it.",

Fungi are next in terms of species richness, with an estimated 2.2-3.8 million species (Hawksworth and L\u00fccking, 2017).

They then add in associated protists, fungi, and bacteria, giving a final estimate of 1-6 billion species on Earth. They exclude viruses, so their final total is dominated by bacteria, with fungi, protists, and animals accounting for most of the rest. This estimate, and an even higher one (c. 1 trillion species) based on scaling laws (Locey and Lennon, 2016), depend on debatable assumptions and raise the obvious question of how we have failed to detect this additional diversity with the array of methods now available.",

Sequestration of carbon in vegetation and soils offsets some of the carbon dioxide emissions from burning fossil fuels (Houghton, 2020), but vegetation also has immediate impacts on local climates through other mechanisms, including changes in evapotranspiration, albedo, and surface roughness (Li et al., 2020). Regulating services are relatively easy to quantify, but there is usually no simple relationship between plant diversity and the services provided, with monocultures of suitable species serving a similar role. Where a positive relationship between diversity and an ecological function has been demonstrated, or is expected on theoretical grounds, the relationship usually appears to be asymptotic, so only a small proportion of the species present in diverse communities is needed for maximum service provision (Slade et al., 2019). Diversity may be more important when multiple functions and services are considered together, however, since different species will make different contributions to each service. Also, high plant diversity favors high animal diversity, which can, in turn, increase services, such as pollination and recreational bird watching, which depend on this.",

As with regulating services, there is typically no simple relationship between cultural services and biodiversity.

This can be a very useful exercise, but to suggest that this subset of map-able services can represent nature\u2019s many contributions to human welfare is misleading. Recent research has emphasized both the importance of understanding the motivations and values that influence public attitudes towards environmental issues, including conservation, and the evidence that people can and do attribute multiple values to the same thing (Ar\u00edas-Ar\u00e9valo et al., 2017).

It is sometimes suggested that unless values can be expressed in dollar terms, and thus compared with the economic benefits that would flow from an environmentally damaging development, they will be ignored.

In practice, therefore, conservation operates on the assumption that the biodiversity we know best\u2014usually plants, birds, and mammals\u2014can act as an indicator and \u2018umbrella\u2019 for the protection of everything else: including most insects, nematodes, protists, archaea, and never-isolated bacteria. We do not know how accurate this assumption is, but it is currently the best we can do. Increasing the rate of species discovery and description is therefore a key need for the improving the protection of biodiversity. Birds and mammals are well-described globally, but there are still significant gaps for vascular plants in some parts of the world (such as Myanmar), and much larger gaps for almost all invertebrate groups. Moreover, many new and existing species are described from a single location and sometimes a single specimen (Deng et al., 2019). Such point records are little use for conservation planning, for which we need information on species distributions so that we can assess conservation needs and priorities.

Hunting, logging, firewood collection, and the grazing of livestock are the most widespread impacts, but numerous other species are exploited\u2014and often overexploited\u2014locally, for food, medicine, pets, ornaments, and assorted raw materials (Corlett, 2018). In theory, most of these species could be exploited sustainably, but in practice outright bans are usually more easily enforced.

Production can be increased by some combination of cropland expansion and agricultural intensification (Zabel et al., 2019). Most evidence suggests that intensification of existing agriculture is less harmful for biodiversity than clearing additional natural habitats, because even low-intensity agriculture supports fewer species than natural areas. However, this may not be true in long-settled regions with a fine-scale mosaic of cultivated and semi-natural areas, and no large areas of intact natural habitat.

Current efforts with wild plant species are insufficient and, despite some progress, we are still a long way from achieving the 2020 GSPC (Global Strategy for Plant Conservation) target of 75% of threatened plant species conserved ex situ (Sharrock et al., 2018). Conventional seed banks, in which plant species with desiccation tolerant (orthodox) seeds are dried and stored at -20oC, have been the backbone of ex situ plant conservation for some time, but their limitations have become increasingly clear in recent years. Not only do an estimated 8% of all plant species, mostly in the humid tropics, have desiccation intolerant (recalcitrant) seeds that die when dried and frozen, but many crop and wild species have seeds with relatively short (i.e. decades, not centuries) life-spans in standard storage conditions (Colville and Pritchard, 2019). Cryopreservation, usually in liquid nitrogen, is an alternative, both to extend the lives of short-lived orthodox seeds and to enable the long-term ex situ storage of embryo axes, buds, shoot tips, pollen, and other tissues of species with recalcitrant seeds (Pence et al., 2020). These technologies could and should be used more widely for threatened plant species.",

Living collections of growing plants, in contrast, tend to be small, particularly for trees. There is a rather similar situation with animals, although the technologies are more complex, and the current coverage of threatened species is much poorer than with plants. Cryopreservation of sperm, eggs, and embryos is widely used with domesticated animals, but is much less common with wild species, although a number of \u2018frozen zoos\u2019 exist currently (Charlton et al., 2018).

Current indices of functional diversity are based on measurements of the \u2018functional traits\u2019 of species in the community\u2014measurable aspects of an organism that can be linked with its ecological role or fitness\u2014and their application in conservation is based on the assumption that species which do not add to the functional diversity of a community are redundant, and thus deserve a lower conservation priority. While this may make sense when the focus is on the loss of particular function, such as pollination or seed dispersal, a general application of functional diversity in conservation would require that the measured traits are adequate proxies for all ecological functions of a species, which is clearly not true. Phylogeny, in contrast, predicts both known and unknown features of organisms which, in turn, correlate with multiple values of biodiversity (Owen et al., 2019). Phylogenetic distinctiveness\u2014the amount of unique evolutionary history\u2014has therefore become a widely accepted criterion for prioritizing conservation effort. The loss of a phylogenetically isolated species represents the loss of an entire branch of the tree of life. The EDGE (Evolutionarily Distinct and Globally Endangered) program of the Zoological Society of London prioritizes species based on the amount of unique evolutionary history eac h onerepresents (Gumbs et al. 2018). This is then combined with a global endangerment score derived from the IUCN Red Lists to give an EDGE score for each species. EDGE scores have proved particularly useful for identifying and prioritizing little-known species which had previously been overlooked, but the wider application of this approach is currently limited by the need for a robust species-level phylogeny and a near-complete global Red List assessment.",

However, many Aichi targets will certainly not be attained by the 2020 deadline and achievement of the Paris targets is looking increasingly challenging.",

These solutions include the restoration of natural forests, grasslands, and wetlands in order to store carbon and protect biodiversity, as well as urban greening through parks and green roofs. The costs and benefits of these approaches have rarely been rigorously assessed, and there are potential conflicts between carbon and biodiversity if, for example, ancient natural grasslands are planted with exotic tree monocultures (Bond et al., 2019). The potential benefits are large, but there are also substantial risks and trade-offs (Doelman et al., 2020), and it is essential to build-in adequate safeguards to prevent unintended consequences (Veldman et al., 2019). This is another area where research is urgently needed, as well as modeling studies and large-scale field trials.",

We need to turn these negative trends around and 2021 will provide two unique opportunities for doing this. The parties to the Convention on Biodiversity will meet in Kunming, China, for the 15th Conference of Parties (COP15) and the signatories to the Paris Agreement on climate change will meet in Glasgow, U.K., for the 26th Conference of Parties (COP26) of the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC).

The new targets for 2030 need to be clear, ambitious, inspirational, and measurable. A protected area target of 30% by 2030 would be achievable in most countries, with the inclusion of OECMs, but a percentage target risks directing attention away from the need for effective management of high-value sites and will have to be worded very carefully (Visconti et al., 2019). At the species level, the only reasonable goal is zero extinction, which is already the implied or explicit target for conservation in most countries and should be the global target. The development of the IUCN Red List of Ecosystems also makes an ecosystem target possible and, unlike species targets, potentially possible to monitor with remote sensing (Watson et al., 2020).",

One lesson we have all learned from the COVID-19 pandemic is that nature does better without us. All over the world, there were unprecedented declines in air pollution, while wildlife reappeared in areas from which it had been absent for decades. For a few months, we could clearly see some of the damage we have done, and we will continue to do unless we make drastic changes. In 2021, we have an opportunity to set the world on a new course.
