[AASLD clinical insight, April 7 version] The ongoing antiviral therapy for HBV and HCV should be continued, but the initiation of direct acting antiviral therapy for HCV patients may be delayed. The surveillance of HCC in at risk patients may be reasonably postponed for 2 months because the doubling time for HCC is 4-6 months. The liver procedures of ultrasonography or liver biopsy may be postponed in non-urgent cases. The initiation of immunosuppressants in patients with liver disease (e.g. autoimmune hepatitis [AIH], or graft rejection) should follow stringent indications of treatment. The immunosuppressants should be continued in AIH or transplanted patients. Regarding liver transplantation, the donor should be confirmed SARS-CoV-2 RNA negative, while the transplantation should be not delayed for recipients in urgent need.",
