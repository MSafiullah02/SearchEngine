Just as statistical tools have become indispensable in epidemiological investigations and interpretations of epidemiologic data, molecular biology tools today have come to elucidate epidemiologic features of diseases that cannot be easily characterized by conventional techniques. Applied to infectious diseases, molecular biology methods have also come to challenge our traditional notions about the epidemiology of these diseases and have engendered novel opportunities for their prevention and control. This chapter will (1) review definitions commonly used in molecular epidemiology, (2) present an overview of molecular biology methods used to study infectious disease epidemiology, and (3) describe examples of the types of epidemiologic problems that can be addressed by molecular biology techniques, highlighting new concepts that emerged in the process of applying this approach to study bacterial infectious diseases.",

Correspondingly, molecular epidemiology can be defined as \u201cthe study of the distribution and determinants of health-related states, conditions, or events in specified populations that utilizes molecular biology methods\u201d. In molecular epidemiology of infectious diseases, the word \u201cdeterminants\u201d is emphasized. Furthermore, as we learn more about the biology of agents of infectious diseases, it is becoming evident that disease distribution in a community of hosts may be determined not only by factors such as the distribution of contaminated vehicles, host risk characteristics, and environmental contexts in which these diseases occur, but also by a pathogen\u2019s genetic composition.",

They did not discuss the use of these techniques to characterize disease occurrence, distribution, or determinants of disease distribution. Thus, the term \u201cmolecular epidemiology\u201d is often used to describe studies that should be more appropriately called \u201cmolecular taxonomy\u201d or \u201cphylogeny\u201d.

In taxonomy or phylogeny applied to infectious agents, the data that are generated are used to describe properties of organisms and their relationships to each other, based on an inferred model. Molecular epidemiology seeks to identify relationships between the etiologic agent of a disease (organism causing the disease), the host, and the environment in which the etiologic agent and the host reside. Both epidemiology and phylogeny as applied to infectious diseases may describe the distribution of particular genetic attributes of a pathogen over time. However, in phylogeny, the relationships of these genetic attributes over time must be guessed, since past evolutionary events cannot be empirically confirmed. That is, phylogenetic analysis seeks to infer past evolutionary events based on a model from a set of observations made with materials available in the present. Epidemiology focuses on events of the present or the recent past. It uses analytical and empirical study designs to identify factors that predict the relationship of attributes of pathogens to disease distribution in place, person, and time. It attempts to identify factors that determine disease transmission, manifestation, and progression. In molecular epidemiology, the hypotheses that are generated are testable or can be made to be testable empirically when enough study subjects are identified. Finally, epidemiology is always motivated by an opportunity or possibility for intervention and prevention. Thus, an application of a molecular biology technique to type an organism per se does not by itself constitute molecular epidemiology. However, it should be stressed that the disciplines of taxonomy and phylogeny play an important role in the discipline of molecular epidemiology, and this idea is reviewed in detail in a separate reference.(1)",

A numerical designation is assigned to an E. coli strain carrying a characteristic O-polysaccharide that induces an antibody response (e.g., O157). The same strain, if further subtyped based on its flagellar protein (H-antigen), is classified as a \u201cserotype\u201d. It will then be given an O:H designation (e.g., O157:H7). The genus Salmonella is biochemically separated into species and subspecies. They are further subtyped serologically according to their O and H antigens. Unlike E. coli serotypes, Salmonella enterica subsp. enterica (subspecies I) serotypes are given a descriptive name rather than a numerical designation, e.g., S. enterica serotype (or serovar) Typhimurium or S. enterica serotype Enteritidis. Nearly 1,500 serotypes of S. enterica subspecies I are currently recognized.(7) The specific serogrouping or serotyping assays include bacterial agglutination test with a panel of antigen-specific antisera, enzyme-linked immunosorbant assay (ELISA), latex particle agglutination, Western blot (or immunoblot) analysis, or a modification of these tests.",

Another potential problem with this method is that plasmids on prolonged storage of a bacterium can be spontaneously lost, which can affect reproducibility of the typing method. Although plasmid profiles are relatively easy to perform and interpret, it does require a laboratory equipped for basic molecular biology techniques, including DNA extraction, restriction endonuclease digestion, electrophoresis, and photodocumentation of the results.",

DNA fragments separated in an agarose gel are first transferred onto a piece of nitrocellulose or nylon membrane. The membrane is then exposed to a piece of single-stranded DNA (probe) labeled with a molecule that facilitates visual detection of a selected target DNA fragment. The probe will specifically bind (hybridize) to its complementary DNA sequence embedded in the membrane. For example, a nucleic acid sequence or probe ATCGGCGATG will hybridize to a target containing the sequence TAGCCGCTAC. Thus, this probe-based detection of target DNA fragments is called hybridization. If the organism of interest harbors more than one copy of the target DNA sequence in different locations in the chromosome, the membrane will show multiple bands (banding pattern) in a single lane, which can be visually detected. Of course, the number of such visualizable bands will be few and will not be obscured by the other fragments in the membrane, which cannot be visualized because they do not hybridize to the probe. This allows for comparison and interpretation of the band patterns (Figure 2B).",

However, electrophoresis in agarose gels of large pieces of DNA introduces two additional technical constraints. Linear pieces of DNA \u226525,000 bases (25 kilobases or kb) are difficult to resolve by the conventional agarose gel electrophoresis method. They get stuck during migration across the gel matrix. Thus, PFGE was developed in which the orientation of the electrical field across the gel is changed (pulsed) periodically.(16) This allows the DNA fragments to move in different directions, releasing them from the stuck position. The DNA fragment will thus take a path of least resistance along its gel migration toward the positive charge pole.",

Polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-based tests can overcome these limitations. The PCR technology is a powerful and simple molecular biology tool, which is now applied in a variety of ways to genotype microorganisms in taxonomic as well as epidemiologic studies. It should be noted that PCR is only one of several methods called nucleic acid amplification tests (NAAT) used to make multiple copies of a target DNA or RNA of an organism or cells in vitro without culturing the organism or cells. PCR is perhaps the most frequently used NAAT and the most common method applied to subtype microorganisms.

These steps are carried out in a plastic microcentrifuge tube containing a reaction mixture of buffers, nucleotides, primers, heat-stable polymerase, and a sample DNA template. DNA when heated to a sufficiently high temperature will separate into single strands. Separation into single strands of a double-stranded DNA is called denaturation. Thus, in the first step, the sample DNA (template) is usually heated to 95\u2013100\u00b0C. Primers are synthetic single strands of DNA (oligonucleotides) of variable lengths designed to bind (anneal) to specific complementary target sites in a DNA template. They can be custom-made commercially. Primers bind to the target sequences when the temperature of the reaction mixture is decreased from a denaturation temperature to an annealing temperature range (\u223c40\u201360\u00b0C). At about 70\u201375\u00b0C (primer extension temperature), a thermostable enzyme called DNA polymerase will add nucleotides (extension) complementary to the unpaired DNA strand onto the annealed primer. In this way, a DNA segment located between the two annealed primers will be copied. This three-step cycle involves change in temperature only\u2014denaturation, annealing, and extension temperature\u2014which is facilitated automatically by a programmable heating device called thermocycler. Depending on the time applied to each of the steps in the cycle, the type of thermocycler used, and quality of the polymerase, a single copy of DNA can be multiplied to more than a billion copies after 30 cycles in less than 3 h. The amplified product can then be visualized in an electrophoretic gel under UV illumination after staining with ethidium bromide.",

For bacteria, if a clinical specimen is obtained from a normally sterile body site such as blood, cerebrospinal fluid, or deep tissue, and it is obtained in a sterile fashion, PCR assay may be performed directly on the specimen itself. The primer sequences could be designed to bind to sequences that are specific to a target organism (e.g., IS6110 of M. tuberculosis). In this way, DNA targets in an organism infecting non-sterile sites (sputum, urine, stool) could be amplified. Blood, urine, and other tissues may contain products inhibitory to PCR, but if the specimen contains a sufficiently large number of the infectious agent of interest, the desired target DNA could be amplified and detected. If a stored organism becomes contaminated with other organisms, or lose their viability, a PCR test can still amplify DNA from that organism, as long as the DNA material is intact. If the primers are highly species specific, a PCR test can distinguish the target sequences from DNA derived from contaminating organisms, thus precluding culturing the target organism from a specimen.",

Such products will display a band pattern in an electrophoresis gel for each strain. The advantage of this method is that the target nucleotide sequence does not have to be known. The primer sequences are determined empirically until a set that works is found. The final choice of the primer design is based on the generation of reproducible and interpretable band patterns. The major drawback of this test, however, is its reproducibility. Because this technique is based on random sequences of the primers, there is always a risk that contaminating DNA may get amplified. To minimize these nonspecific amplification, the following precautions are taken: (1) DNA templates should be from organisms recovered in pure culture, (2) include a sample in which no template is added (negative control), (3) standardize template DNA concentration in all samples to be tested, and (4) if possible, test all the desired samples in one batch.",

VNTR genotyping has been applied to a variety of bacterial organisms.(57\u201359) A recent variant of this method applied to type M. tuberculosis is called mycobacterial interspersed repetitive unit (MIRU) VNTR, which is based on microsatellite-like sequences scattered throughout the M. tuberculosis chromosome.(60, 61) By using 12 of these MIRU loci, several investigators have demonstrated that the resolution achieved by this typing method is comparable to that of IS6110-RFLP typing method.(62\u201364)",

This membrane then is used as a target for hybridization against PCR products obtained from amplification of the spacer sequences located between the DRs. PCR products used as probes are generated from the total genome of a strain of M. tuberculosis by one set of primers designed to amplify spaces between the DRs in the test strain. If the membrane contains an oligonucleotide representing a spacer sequence also present in the test strain, an amplified product will hybridize to it. This will generate a hybridization matrix, not unlike the microarray discussed earlier. Thus, unlike the previously described PCR-based typing methods, the patterns that are generated and compared are not electrophoretic fingerprints.",

One relatively new method called multilocus sequence typing (MLST) combines PCR assay with sequencing to assign a sequence type designation to a strain. Standardized MLST analysis for most bacterial organisms is based on sequencing a PCR-amplified region from each of a set of unlinked housekeeping genes. For example, with S. aureus, these genes include seven genes: arcC, aroE, glpF, gmk, pta, tpi, and yqiL.(68,69) Each of the amplified segments from these genes shows potential allelic variation in different S. aureus isolates. An MLST clone that is designated as a particular sequence type (ST) is defined as a strain belonging to a set of isolates with identical sequences at each of the seven loci. A methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA) strain designated ST8 (also called PFGE type USA300) has recently been reported to cause widespread community outbreaks of severe skin and deep tissue infections in different regions of the United States.(70, 71) Because this is a sequence-based method, it is highly reproducible across different laboratories, and thus standardized protocols have been developed for several bacterial organisms. Protocols as well as ST designations for these organisms are maintained and accessible at http://www.mlst.net.",

What are the risk factors for infection and transmission in a community and how is the infection maintained in a community of hosts? How and why does a particular strain suddenly emerge to become the predominant strain in a community, and why does it disappear? How is drug-resistant infectious disease prevalence in a community affected by fluctuations in clonal distribution over time in that community? How is the prevalence of spectrum of clinical manifestations (mortality, severe disease, asymptomatic infection) of an infectious disease affected by clonal distribution of a pathogen in a community? Do unique biologic characteristics of a member of a bacterial species contribute to enhanced transmission and hence increased prevalence of that member in a community or institution? How do we use the knowledge we gain about the dynamics of disease transmission to implement effective disease control programs? How do we measure the effect and impact of the intervention made based on the knowledge acquired from the use of a particular laboratory test?

In an outbreak, this would be 100% minus the background disease prevalence for that place. Unfortunately, in places like the United States, it is estimated from surveillance reports that less than 20% of reported cases of foodborne diseases, such as salmonellosis, come from recognized outbreaks.(72) The others are reported from sporadic cases.

In fact, even after recall of the contaminated product, S. Newport strains associated with the summer outbreaks were isolated from two persons. It turns out these two cases occurred in siblings of an older child who had acquired the infection during the outbreak period after ingesting the beef.(74) Thus, salmonellosis in a community could be maintained by person-to-person transmission after introduction into that community by a contaminated product. The plasmid profile analysis, thus, helped not only to estimate an attributable fraction of a risk factor but also to describe the dynamics of community transmission of salmonellosis that would have been difficult, if not impossible, to do by conventional epidemiologic methods.",

This knowledge, while helpful, does not provide a focused intervention option, and often, as we all know, such knowledge does not contribute to long-lasting effective interventions. In the example of salmonellosis in Brazil, however, further stratification of the Salmonella isolates by plasmid profile analysis identified a more specific risk factor related to the isolates themselves. The knowledge that many cases of multidrug-resistant salmonellosis were occurring in specific hospitals in the city brought attention to the need to identify factors within the hospitals that contribute to Salmonella transmission. Today, nosocomial transmission of multidrug-resistant salmonellosis in S\u00e3o Paulo is rare.

While obvious outbreaks do occur in hospitals, very often, clusters of infectious diseases observed in hospitals are difficult to characterize as outbreaks. This is because patients in hospitals have host-related factors (immunosuppression, prolonged antimicrobial drug exposure, underlying illness) that predispose them to infection with \u201cnormal flora\u201d, saprophytes, or recognized pathogens. The distinction among colonization, contamination, and infection becomes blurred and is a frequent topic of discussion among hospital staff. One important question that arises in these settings, therefore, is, \u201cdo these organisms have biologic characteristics that enable them to cause disease or do they cause disease only because of host susceptibility factors?\u201d",

Thus, in hospital epidemiology, another important question is, \u201cdo antimicrobial drug-resistant microorganisms predominate in hospital settings because they are selected by the use of antimicrobial agents, or do they predominate because of distinct biologic characteristics possessed by a limited number of clonal groups that happen to be drug resistant?\u201d Molecular epidemiologic methods are beginning to address these questions.",

            "text": "Given that normal flora and saprophytes found in hospital settings are comprised of a large number of strain types, one would expect drug selection pressure to generate a large number of drug-resistant strains to cause hospital infections. One of the most intriguing observations made recently about drug-resistant bacterial hospital infections, however, is that, despite strong antimicrobial drug selection pressures, most of these infections are actually caused by a limited set of bacterial strains. Most studies found that drug-resistant strains that are isolated from hospital invasive disease sources are comprised of a limited number of strains. In New York, a 2-year survey of vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus faecium (VRE) infections at a teaching hospital found 54 different PFGE subtypes among 182 isolates. One-third of these were accounted for by just two PFGE subtypes.(89) In Tennessee, a similar survey in different hospitals over a 3-year period showed that among 34 different PFGE types, one was responsible for 61% of 106 VRE isolates obtained from seven different hospitals.(90) In Tennessee, the investigators found that the introduction of the predominant PFGE types at different institutions was caused by new patients transferred to these institutions. Thus, these studies suggest that a clonal strain carried by a transfer patient, once introduced into a hospital setting, can rapidly become predominant in that hospital, and that such a mode of transmission is more important than the selective pressures of antimicrobial drugs in establishing a large number of drug-resistant nosocomial infections. Without the genotype data, such a conclusion would be difficult to make. This type of observation also helps to streamline nosocomial infection control practices. In this case, the recommendation based on the observation is to screen transfer patients for VRE before they are sent to a particular ward in the recipient hospital.",

Host factors that enhance the likelihood of development of a clinical manifestation after a bacterial infection could also render such hosts possible new sources of transmission to other hosts. Communities with a high prevalence of persons with HIV infection or AIDS facilitate greater likelihood of transmission of tuberculosis, just because of the greater prevalence of cases of tuberculosis. Thus, host genetic factors that have a similar effect on infection could contribute to enhanced transmission of a disease. Studies that examine host genetic factors that affect disease transmission are just beginning.(91) Of course, in addition to host factors, environment can greatly influence infectious disease distribution, including temperature, weather, season, urbanization, industrialization, and socioeconomic conditions. Such influences on disease transmission and epidemiology of infectious diseases require a separate chapter in itself.

It was hypothesized that since injection drug users, who are normally a high-risk group for tuberculosis, regularly inject themselves with a variety of antigens that stimulate their macrophages to express RNI and hydrogen peroxide, such a practice will eventually select for RNI and hydrogen peroxide-resistant strain of M. tuberculosis to emerge in that risk group. If such a strain infects a non-user, it will cause a rapidly progressive disease because such a host does not carry macrophages making RNI and hydrogen peroxide, which would otherwise control the initial infection with M. tuberculosis. That is, infection/disease ratio increases when one is infected with such a strain. Thus, more people will develop rapidly progressive disease in a community where such a strain is circulating. This would explain the predominance of C strain in New York City. Hence, in this case, a human behavior appears to have selected for a new strain of M. tuberculosis that eventually affected the epidemiology of tuberculosis in New York City.",
