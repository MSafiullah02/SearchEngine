Here we estimate the prevalence of links to lowcredibility information on Twitter during the outbreak, and the role of bots in spreading these links. We find that the the combined volume of tweets linking to various low-credibility information is comparable to the volume of New York Times articles and CDC links. Content analysis reveals a politicization of the pandemic. The majority of this content spreads via retweets. Social bots are involved in both posting and amplifying low-credibility information, although the majority of volume is generated by likely humans. Some of these accounts appear to amplify low-credibility sources in a coordinated fashion.",

To account for the fact that some users might share certain information repeatedly, we provide the same analysis at the level of users, i.e., the percentage of users who shared the corresponding links at least once, in Fig. 1(b) . The results are qualitatively similar. These findings suggest that low-credibility information is not rampant on Twitter, but it does have a volume share comparable with highly reliable sources. We also show the percentage of retweets for different sources in Fig. 1(c) . About 68% of the links to lowcredibility information are shared by retweets. For comparison, this fraction is about 54% for nytimes.com and all URLs together in DS1.

A significantly higher ratio of the volume of low-credibility information is shared by likely bot accounts, compared to the volume of tweets linking to reliable sources and the overall baseline. Since some accounts post multiple tweets with the same link, affecting the bot ratio estimation, we also perform the same analysis at the user level (not shown in Fig. 1) . The bot ratios become 12.1%, 6.5%, 10.6%, and 11.7% for low-credibility, nytimes.com, cdc.gov, and overall links, respectively. The decreases in bot volume ratio compared to the tweet-level analysis suggest that low-credibility links are amplified by hyper-active bots. These results are consistent with previous findings (Shao et al. 2018 ). Let us focus on retweets to characterize the interaction between original posters of links and accounts that amplify the reach of those links. The results for different sources are shown in Fig. 2 . For low-credibility information, although the majority of tweets and retweets are posted by humanlike accounts, we do see a higher-than-normal participation rate of bot accounts in both posting and amplifying the content. We also find that bot-like tweeters attract more bot-like retweeters than human-like tweeters (see highlighted oval in Fig. 2(a) ), despite a majority of human-like retweeters.",
