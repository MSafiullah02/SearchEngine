The measures put in place to combat COVID-19 disease are impressive, with negative consequences and uncertainty in various sectors (3) . In this situation, it is mandatory to reorganize the clinical activity in order to continue providing essential services. The authors of the article highlighted some important key points of managing a breast imaging department during the COVID-19 pandemic (1).",
