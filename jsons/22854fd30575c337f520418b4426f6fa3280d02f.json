Given the high pretest probability for COVID-19, nasopharyngeal swab for the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) was collected, and he was admitted to the medicine floor given concern for viral/bacterial pneumonia. During his hospital course, he was noted to have evidence of bradycardia with intermittent high degree AV block and AV dissociation; ventricular rate was less than 20 bpm (telemetry strips shown in Figures 3   and 4) . He was symptomatic with diaphoresis during these episodes, but remained hemodynamically stable. Pacer pads were placed, however, he did not require transcutaneous pacing. Cardiac biomarkers including troponin I (<0.012 ng/mL; normal range 0-0.034 ng/mL) and NT-proBNP (38.3 pg/mL; normal range 0-125 pg/mL) were normal. Transthoracic echocardiogram showed normal ejection fraction, normal diastolic function, no wall motion abnormalities, and no significant valvular disease (Videos 1-3).

Among 138 patients hospitalized with COVID-19 in Wuhan, acute cardiac injury (defined if the serum levels of cardiac biomarkers were above the 99th percentile upper reference limit or new abnormalities were shown in electrocardiography and echocardiography) was diagnosed in 7% patients and about 16.7 % patients were noted to have cardiac arrhythmias (2) . COVID-19 involvement in the heart has ranged from asymptomatic myocardial injury to acute coronary syndrome, mild to fulminant myocarditis, stress cardiomyopathy and cardiogenic shock; however, the mechanism of cardiac involvement is not exactly clear (3) . Furthermore, underlying cardiovascular disease or risk factors and myocardial injury have been shown to portend poor prognosis in these patients (4) . In this case, we present a patient with moderate COVID-19 infection who showed evidence of transient conduction disturbances with high-degree AV block. High-degree AV block is known to be an uncommon presentation of acute myocarditis in adults, more commonly seen in cardiac sarcoidosis and giant-cell myocarditis (5) . However, our patient did not have any other overt evidence of myocardial involvement with normal cardiac biomarkers and normal echocardiogram, which makes his presentation unusual and interesting. It is possible that COVID-19 may have caused sub-clinical myocarditis leading to a high-degree AV block in this case. ACE2 receptors are abundant in the heart, are present in multiple cell types including macrophages, endothelial cells, smooth muscle cells, and cardiomyocytes (6) . Further, animal models have shown presence of ACE2 receptors in sino-atrial nodal cells in rats (7) and conduction disturbances and ventricular fibrillation have been noted with overexpression of ACE2 receptor in experimental mice models (8) . Hence, another possibility is that isolated involvement of the AV node and infra-Hisian conduction system by SARS-COV-2 may have caused transient high-grade AV block. Whether this block is secondary to direct viral involvement or due to an auto-immune is unknown at this time. Our patient did not have recurrence of these conduction disturbances after he was started on supportive treatment with azithromycin and hydroxychloroquine, which may be due to recovery from viral infection or anti-inflammatory effects of the medications or both.",
