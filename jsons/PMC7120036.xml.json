It has been observed in animal studies that the novel influenza virus A has a high replication rate in lung tissue, with a great capacity to invade the lower respiratory tract in humans, causing especially acute fulminant respiratory failure.",

NIMV was initiated using bilevel positive airway pressure (BIPAP) mode S/T (spontaneous/timed) with a respiratory rate of 15. It had a programmed tidal volume (Vt) of 200 ml exhaled for a 42-kg patient and 300 ml for a 60-kg patient, each infected with influenza A novel associated H1N1 and chronic lung disease. The average volume-assured pressure support (AVAPS) ventilatory strategy was useful in patients with COPD exacerbation, infection, asthma, and those with mild forms of novel influenza A(H1N1) infection. The S/T-BIPAP + AVAPS ventilation strategy allows a fixed preset tidal volume that is maintained constant under inspiratory pressure variations. (BiPAP S/T) with average volume assured pressure support (AVAPS) allows for setting a fixed tidal volume, and the system output automatically adjusts based on variations in inspiratory pressure to ensure the predetermined target value. The initial ventilatory parameters must be programmed in mode BIPAP-S/T + AVAPS with an inspiratory pressure (IPAP) of 18\u201326 cmH2O and a minimum of 12 applications scheduled as well as positive expiratory pressure (EPAP) of 6\u20138 cmH2O for a programmed tidal volume corresponding to 45.5 + 0.91 (height in cmt \u2013 152.4). 8\u201310 ml/kg body weight per patient.

It stated that it is not advisable to use noninvasive ventilation in patients who require respiratory support where there is high suspicion of infection with the new influenza virus A(H1N1) [8]. The reason for this recommendation is the risk of its generating aerosols, which increase the risk of transmission to health care workers. Also, it usually contributes to a poor clinical outcome in these patients. Before deciding to use NIMV, the risk-benefit ratio should be assessed, especially considering certain aspects, shown in Table 15.1.\n",

In the LOVS study, the authors compared 10 vs. 16 cmH2O of PEEP in patients who had low tidal volume. Amato et al.\u2019s patient group was employed as the controls. The EXPRESS study employed the ARDS Network protocol control group and compared PEEP levels of 7 vs. 15 cmH2O. Mortality was similar in the three studies. In the ALVEOLI study clinical outcomes were similar whether lower or higher PEEP levels were used. A recent meta-analysis [19] examined three trials involving 2,299 patients and demonstrated that high PEEP levels was not associated with improved hospital survival. This protective ventilatory strategy has traditionally been associated with reduced mortality. It should be noted, however, that several recent meta-analyses of randomized trials using ventilatory strategies to protect the tidal volume in the lungs demonstrated that it is not the most important parameter. They concluded that the driving pressure is the difference between the plateau pressure and PEEP during controlled ventilation, which is therefore the most important parameter to optimize [20].",

APRV is a time-triggered, pressure-cycled ventilation mode that allows spontaneous breaths throughout the respiratory cycle. It has been widely used in patients with ARDS and has been observed to improve oxygenation. It also reduces the need for sedation and paralysis. During APRV, pressure in the airway is scheduled on two levels called Phigh and Plow and into two periods called Thigh and Tlow. They are analogous to inspiratory pressure, PEEP, inspiratory time, and expiratory time, respectively. There are no conclusive data pertaining to whether APRV improves or worsens the results in patients with lung injury, particularly because the combination of pressure and the controlled mode can produce unpredictable spontaneous breaths and tidal volumes. It is known that high tidal volumes are associated with worse ARDS outcomes [24].",
