However, as the U.S. medical community, and specifically high-level isolation units, began to successfully treat individuals with EVD, nonclinical aspects of EVD care were recognized as equally important in containing the virus and minimizing occupational risks. After the care of EVD patients, the Nebraska Biocontainment Unit identified proper medical waste management and disposal as a crucial component and point of consideration for U.S. health care facilities treating EVD patients.1 An international hazard analysis of critical control points for EVD also emphasized that waste generated from the care of an EVD patient should not be disregarded as a potential transmission route.2\n",

The DOT dictates the regulations for transport of category B infectious substances or regulated medical waste, which can be handled by most waste facilities and landfills throughout the nation so long as the waste is contained in leak-proof, properly marked packaging.3 However, waste contaminated with EVD and some other highly infectious organisms is categorized as category A infectious substances.4 Solids contaminated with category A infectious substances are regulated by government agencies, including the DOT, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, U.S. Department of Labor's Occupational Safety and Health Administration, and Environmental Protection Agency, which does not typically regulate medical waste.4 Minimum criteria are required of facilities to accept category A waste for ultimate disposal. This includes category A agents (UN2814) such as Crimean-Congo virus, Yersinia pestis, and EVD that must be handled and transported under stringent federal regulations and procedures dictated by the DOT Hazardous Materials Regulation (49 CFR Parts 171-180) when transported by air, rail, highway, or water.4 The Nebraska Biocontainment Unit suggested that EVD medical waste management planning should incorporate detailed processes on how to safely handle and remove category A waste from the medical facility, including considerations for increased operational planning and financial burdens.1\n",

The ultimate disposition of the category A waste at the off-site facility must also take into account residuals produced from inactivation.4 Interim planning guidance has been issued as of January 2017, but there is not a mandatory nationwide industry standard established which dictates that all medical waste facilities must be ready to handle category A waste.4\n",

Two surveys were developed\u2014one at the lead-supervisor-management level (lead) and the other at the worker-employee level (worker) and divided into 3 sections: (1) demographics; (2) industry-specific questions on comfortability and willingness to encounter HID scenarios, and current policies and procedures in place to address category A waste; and (3) levels of knowledge, training, resources, and personal protective equipment (PPE) to address HID scenarios. Sections 1 (9 questions) and 3 (6 questions) were identical in the lead and worker pilot surveys, with the only discrepancy being the directive pronoun. Section 2 at the lead level was 63 questions, whereas section 2 at the worker level was only 4 questions because the former asked detailed questions on organizational waste policies and procedures. Survey participants were able to select the link to which survey they felt was more appropriate\u2014worker or lead.

The pilot survey was beneficial in that it highlights the gaps in preparedness in this industry; however, the sample size is limited because of few organizations having any experience with category A waste. In some cases, some organizations made their own determination not to provide services, whereas others were prohibited by their state and local agencies. The rapid change in information and the lack of transmission of information during this time could also have led to the low response. Fortunately, this is also because of the limited number of U.S. patients and incidents that occurred.",

Workers and leads will need to be provided materials, support, and training to ensure the safe management of these wastes. These tools will need to be developed by industry experts, organizations, and the government. Developing the proper management of HID materials now is essential to close the gaps identified in this study so that states and governmental entities can act accordingly based on the regulations and guidance developed, and so the safety of the public is assured. Coordination of efforts and communication of decisions to the waste workers will be key.",
