(1) It has been determined that possibly the mechanism of action of chloroquine is to block the proton pump that prevents the decrease of the pH in the digestive tract, which is important for the metabolism of the plasmodium. (2) Studies have also shown that amantadine, together with chloroquine, is able to enhance the effect against plasmodium falciparum, mainly in chloroquine-resistant strains. (3) Amantadine has been used as an antiviral therapy against influenza A, the mechanism that has been proposed is to block the early stage of viral replication. When the viral particle enters the cell, an endosome is formed, which has an acidic pH of 5. The proton channel (viroporin) is formed by the transport protein M2, which carries protons into the virion. This proton pump is necessary to interrupt the macromolecular interactions that keep the integrity of the virion. Amantadine is able to cross the membrane of the endosome and breaks the hydrogen bridges formed by Ala 30 and Gly 34 (4) in that way it can capture protons preventing them from entering the virion, preventing the release of the viral nucleus into the cell.
