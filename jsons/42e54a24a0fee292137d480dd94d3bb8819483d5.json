            "text": "In today's globally interconnected food system, outbreaks of foodborne disease can spread widely and cause considerable impact on public health. Food distribution is a complex system that can be seen as a network of trade flows connecting supply chain actors. Identifying the source of an outbreak of foodborne disease distributed across this network can be solved by considering this network structure and the dimensions of information it contains. The literature on the network source identification problem has grown widely in recent years covering problems in many different contexts, from contagious disease infecting a human population, to computer viruses spreading through the Internet, to rumors or trends diffusing through a social network. Much of this work has focused on studying this problem in analytically tractable frameworks, designing approaches to work on trees and extending to general network structures in an ad hoc manner. These simplified frameworks lack many features of real-world networks and problem contexts that can dramatically impact transmission dynamics, and therefore, backwards inference of the transmission process. Moreover, the features that distinguish foodborne disease in the context of source identification have not previously been studied or identified. In this article we identify these features, then provide a review of existing work on the network source identification problem, categorizing approaches according to these features. We conclude that much of the existing work cannot be implemented in the foodborne disease problem because it makes assumptions about the transmission process that are unrealistic in the context of food supply networks-that is, identifying the source of an epidemic contagion whereas foodborne contamination spreads through a transport network-mediated diffusion",

Most of this work has focused on the forward problem of understanding and forecasting the diffusion process and its dependence on the structure of the underlying network. However in recent years much work has emerged on the inverse problem of identifying the source of an outbreak spread in a network. This work covers problems in different contexts, including contagious disease infecting a human population; rumors or information diffusing through a social network; adoption of an idea, behavior change, or product in an organizational network; the spread of viruses on the internet; and the transport-mediated diffusion of contaminated individuals between cities. These contexts represent different spreading scenarios that require different modeling approaches for forward dynamics and inverse solutions.",

Network disease propagation models are based on the stages of disease as it infects individuals and spreads across contact links in a host population. Initially the entire population is susceptible to the disease; once any individual is exposed to an infectious contact they become infected and can infect others; from this point they can recover, be removed, become immune, or other variants. These models are referred to as compartmental models due to the disease compartments that individuals move between in illness progression: S-susceptible, I-infected, Rrecovered or removed, etc.",

This is due to the scale-free structure of computer networks, which are extremely heterogeneous with a few nodes having an extremely high number of connections. The spread of computer viruses therefore diverges from classical diseases not due to the contagion model-both are simple contagionbut due to the heterogeneity of the network substrate over which computer viruses spread.",

In this type of model, nodes represent subpopulations, such as cities, and links represent the movement of individuals between subpopulations. Individuals interact in each subpopulation according to assumptions of equal mixing or a local social network structure and disease spreads between these individuals according to a contagion model; this is the reaction process. The movement of individuals between subpopulations is the spatial diffusion process, often modeled over a network as a Markov transition process. Metapopulation models therefore depend both on the local social network structure at each node and on the spatial structure of the environment, transport infrastructures, traffic networks, and other movement patterns over which individuals diffuse.",

Based on basic practical knowledge of food supply networks and the foodborne disease contamination process, in this article we introduce the source identification problem in the context of foodborne disease outbreaks and outline six features that distinguish this problem from source detection in other network contexts due to either practical data limitations or differences in transmission process mechanics. We then use the six features to categorize the existing literature on the network-based source detection problem according to relevance to the foodborne disease context.",

A probabilistic model of the transmission process of contamination spreading through this network is then postulated. In the following, we assume that a foodborne disease outbreak will originate from a single contamination source. This source sends out contaminated products that travel through the network according to the transmission model, resulting in observations of illness at a set of network nodes. The source identification objective is to minimize the error between the model-derived estimate of the location of the source and the true location of the source in the network, given the nodes associated with the observations of illness.",

A large-scale outbreak occurs when contaminated food departs from some source in an early stage of the network that is able to reach downstream nodes in geographically distributed locations. The contamination will eventually make its way to consumers, who develop illness some time after consuming the contaminated food.

Network structural information thus provides a first cut into the source identification problem by enabling the identification of feasible sources. To differentiate between the feasible sources, further dimensions of information available within the network can be leveraged. Each edge contains information about the volume of goods traded between supply network actors.

These methods often assume some variant of the epidemiological model of contagion transmission, including the widely used susceptibleinfected (SI) or susceptible-infected-recovered (SIR) models. However the transmission of contamination through the food supply to people is different from the disease contagion process from people to people. Contamination spreads as contaminated (solid, perishable) food moves through the supply network after being inoculated by the pathogen at the source. As the food is transported through the supply network, the pathogenic quantity will generally remain conserved, meaning it will neither spread to other food items nor decay significantly in infectivity [18, 29] . The former is due to a number of factors including the lack of contact between packaged items, the lack of interaction or mixing between unpackaged items, and the biological insusceptibility of contamination to transmission and decay, i.e. low infectivity and recovery rates. Due to this conservation of contamination, the spreading process in the context of foodborne disease primarily involves the contaminated food being spatially distributed along the network without decaying (i.e., recovery) or growing (i.e., infection) the contamination along the way. Contaminated food items cause infection in people when the food is consumed, but this process does not represent a classical infection dynamics because the contamination is directional (food to human) and largely does not spread between people. Contagion processes represent a different dynamics; if these are applied to the foodborne disease situation, the extremely low infection rate would mean that when individual food items come into contact, the infection will not be transmitted and will die out. The diffusion along the network is the mechanism that moves the contamination forward through the supply chain. To reflect these diffusion dynamics, the foodborne disease contamination spreading process has therefore been modeled as a simple Markov transmission process [14] .",

The time the contamination may spend in storage, both at various nodes along the supply network (e.g., warehouses) and with the consumer after purchase, as well as during the incubation period, can be significant and vary widely-and potentially much more so than the time spent in travel.

The seminal work by Shah and Zaman [34] introduces the measure of rumor centrality, which considers the number of linear extensions between each source and the infected nodes. The method and analytical results concerning detection probability are derived for trees or tree-like graphs; to apply to general networks, a Breadth-First-Search (BFS) heuristic that assumes the contamination traveled across the shortest paths to the observations must be used. Other methods based on betweenness centrality [8] and eigenvector centrality [11, 30] apply to general networks without employing a shortest path heuristic, although the calculation of betweenness is based on shortest path properties.

The temporal category includes methods assuming discrete-time epidemic (SI/R) contagion models based on dynamic message-passing [20] , Bayesian belief propagation, [2] , analytic combinatoric approaches [3] . The analytic-combinatoric method [3] builds on the approach of [20] and [2] by removing the node-independence assumption of [20] and the tree-like contact network assumption that both [20] and [2] are predicated on to compute the exact source probability distribution for general contact network structures. Because the analytical calculations increase exponentially for non-tree-like networks, a computationally feasible Monte Carlo estimation approach is provided and demonstrated empirically to provide comparable results with the analytic method. The approach of [3] applies both to static and temporally evolving networks. A separate approach involves continuous-time Gaussian transmission models [21, 28] . While a continuous-time transmission model is a better approximation for realistic settings, the approach in [21, 28] is limited by being designed for trees and extended to general graphs via a BFS (shortest-path) heuristic. Other temporal methods have been proposed that observe the contamination status of a subset of sensor nodes at user-controlled intervals invoking a Four-Metric approach [33] , Monte Carlo methods [1] , or analytical methods for time-varying networks [15] . A separate approach is based on time-reversal backward spreading, where link weights are set equal to travel time and not spreading propensity [35] . These methods are impractical for the foodborne disease context given the lack of temporal data on times through the network available for solving the problem, as discussed in Sect. 3.6.",

Nonetheless, it is a heuristic approach that considers only a single path to each observation. While this type of approximation may be justified in certain network contexts such as the global air mobility networks the method was designed for, it is not adapted for the structure of food supply networks which are characterized by homogeneity in path lengths and the existence of multiple paths of similar probability (see Sect. 3).

While both methods are developed in the framework of metapopulation reaction-diffusion models, only the multiple paths approach depends explicitly on the dynamical quantities of the SIR model. This generalized effective distance approach for estimating (forward) disease propagation arrival times is therefore a departure point for an improved and analytical approach to the (inverse) source detection problem for metapopulation propagation processes like infectious diseases spreading through global air traffic networks.",
