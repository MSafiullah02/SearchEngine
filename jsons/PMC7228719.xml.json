It is quite possible that there are more than two physiological models and patterns and that L and H represent the extremes of a very heterogenous disease spectrum. Lung US is an invaluable tool in the intensivist's armory which can be used to characterize COVID-19 lung disease and its natural history and individualize ventilation strategies. Prospective research comparing LUS-guided care versus standard ventilatory management of patients with COVID-19 lung injury is needed before any changes in practice are imposed.",

The entire intercostal space is filled with coalescent B line artefact (red arrow); this is consistent with Pattern 1. The right image is a CT thorax demonstrating patches of peripheral ground glass changes (yellow arrow), which would account for the LUS appearances. Note that the majority of the lung is aerated, consistent with the L phenotype. (b): Left image is a LUS in the postero-lateral zone, demonstrating hepatization of the lung (yellow arrow) consistent with a Pattern 2. Note the small anechoic space between the lung edge and the diaphragm, this represents a small parapneumonic effusion (red arrow). The right image is a thoracic CT demonstrating bilateral extensive consolidation consistent with ARDS and the H phenotype. The yellow arrow denotes the area the LUS is performed and the CT changes that account for the LUS appearances.
