S\u2010protein of SARS\u2010like coronavirus can interact with human ACE2 protein and infect human respiratory epithelial cells (Ge et al. 2013). The human cornea and conjunctiva express ACE2 receptor, which can theoretically bind to the 2019\u2010nCoV and cause infection. Our hospital is from the epidemic area. In our hospital, 37 patients of 2019\u2010nCoV infection pneumonia were detected the nucleic acid in the conjunctival sac by real\u2010time RT\u2010PCR. According the Chinese COVID\u201019 diagnosis and treatment (V) (Huang et al. 2020), 12 cases were severe patients, and the others were mild patients. Three cases had conjunctival congestion and other inflammatory appearance. One case of severe patients, which conjunctival sac secretion nucleic acid test was positive by real\u2010time RT\u2010PCR, but this severe patient had no conjunctivitis. The other 36 patients were negative in nucleic acid test of conjunctival secretion.",

The viral load of conjunctival sac secretion of COVID\u201019 patients is relatively low, and we estimate the viral load is directly proportional to the severity of the disease. Whether the 2019\u2010nCoV can be transmitted through conjunctiva is further studied.",
