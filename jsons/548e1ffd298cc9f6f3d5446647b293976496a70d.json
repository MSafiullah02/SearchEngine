It is reasonable to think that cancer patients undergoing chemotherapy, targeted therapy or immunotherapy could have a more aggressive course if positive for Coronavirus disease CoV-2 (COVID-19). Methods. We conducted a literature review on https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/, https://scholar.google.com, www.arxiv.org, www.biorxiv.org, of all articles published using the keywords COVID-19 therapy or treatment and cancer until May 2, 2020. A total of 205 articles were identified and 53 were included in this review. Results. We describe the ongoing COVID-19 therapies that should be known by oncologists and highlight the potential interactions with antineoplastic drugs, commonly used in clinical practice. The main drug interactions were found with tocilizumab, ruxolitinib and colchicine. Conclusions. The literature provides an inconclusive picture on potential preferred treatments for COVID-19 and their interactions with antineoplastic agents. Future clinical trials are needed to better understand the interactions between different drugs in the context of COVID-19 pandemic.",

Thus, during this COVID-19 crisis, cancer patients are regarded as a highly vulnerable group. It was found that within 14 days, anti-cancer treatments were significantly associated with occurrence of severe clinical events in J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f COVID-19 infection (6) . The cancer population subjected to chemotherapy and/or radiotherapy is more exposed to infections in general and, therefore, also to that from Coronavirus primarily due to the effect of the cytotoxic action on the hematopoietic and immune systems with a reduction in the number of neutrophils, the first bulwark of infections, and decreased immune capacity (4) . Although there is no data yet on the risks of contracting coronavirus infection or on the clinical course of the infection during immunotherapy and/or immunosuppressive treatment with chemotherapy. It is reasonable to think, by analogy of what happens in the case of seasonal flu, due to the presence of immunosuppression, that in treated cancer patients, there may be a greater number of complications and the clinical course to be more serious (1) .",

Cardiotoxicity manifests as restrictive or dilated cardiomyopathy or with conduction system abnormalities such as atrioventricular and bundle-branch block (43) . Recently, some doubts It is important also to note that some chemotherapeutic agents or hormonal therapies such as abiraterone require concomitant steroids that are immunosuppressive agents and could weaken anticitokines drugs such as tocilizumab (63) .
