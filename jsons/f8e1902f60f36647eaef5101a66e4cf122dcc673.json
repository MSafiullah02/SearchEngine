The H5N1 influenza virus causes high mortality in domestic poultry and severe disease and death in humans, yet is poorly transmitted from human to human. Most influenza viruses that cause seasonal influenza are highly transmissible but overall have low mortality. Nevertheless, they still cause substantial burden through global spread.",

Clearing lands for agriculture and development, building dams and other land use changes have disrupted animal habitats, displaced animal populations and led to human-animal contact. 5 Humans have also created the perfect scenario for spillover events-large live animal markets selling multiple species of wild and domestic animals in proximity to large populations of densely housed humans who are extensively connected by air, land and water to the rest of the world. Even though spillover events of viruses that have the capacity to kill humans may be rare, the world today has expanded the opportunities for such events.",

As the largest city (11 million) in central China, it is a major transport hub and centre for industry and commerce. It is where the Yangtze and Han rivers intersect and is home to the largest train station, biggest airport and largest deep-water port in central China. About 30 000 passengers fly from Wuhan daily to destinations throughout the world. In 2018, >24.5 million passengers passed through the airport. China's high-speed train network stretched to about 35 000 km by the end of 2019. Bullet trains handled 2.31 billion passenger trips in 2019.",

After initial reassurances that no humanto-human spread was occurring, infections exploded in many locations and the virus has now infected thousands in China and has spread to more than 24 countries-a number that continues to increase.

The greatest danger is posed by pathogens that can spread by the respiratory route, especially if airborne spread occurs. Other factors that make control of a pathogen more difficult include transmissibility during asymptomatic, mild or pre-symptomatic periods. A long infectious period also makes control more challenging. The virus that has emerged in Wuhan combines characteristics that do not bode well for the human population. Based on the first 425 confirmed cases in Wuhan, the mean incubation period was 5.2 days (potential range 2-14 days), the number of cases doubled every 7.4 days, and each case was estimated to infect 2.2 others. 10 This basic reproductive number is similar to an estimate of 2.6 (uncertainty range: 1.5-3.5) reached by researchers with simulated epidemic trajectories using a mathematical model. 11 Modelling results suggest that control measures would need to block >60% of transmission to control the outbreak. 11 Based on observations with SARS and other infections, the basic reproductive number may decrease as people become aware of the threat of infection and change behaviour, but the basic reproductive number must drop <1 to stop the epidemic. The analysis based on the model suggests there will be ongoing sustained transmission in the absence of effective interventions.",
