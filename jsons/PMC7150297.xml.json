An intensive and systematic collection of marine organisms for compounds with therapeutic potential was hampered in the past by the general lack of (1) familiarity chemists engaged in this research had with the marine environment, (2) lack of documented ethno-natural history of marine organisms for medicinal purposes (Scheuer 1988), (3) appropriate collection tools, techniques, and protocols, and (4) access to clinically relevant assays by those who study marine-derived compounds. These problems have largely been overcome.",

Collection by these techniques is limited to a depth of 20 feet (~6 m) or less and is generally inefficient. Scuba, however, allows routine collections to depths of 120 feet (~36.5 m) for 15 minutes of bottom time with no decompression stops. Using mixtures of nitrogen and oxygen (nitrox) or helium and oxygen instead of air allows scuba collections of extended duration and depth (Miller 1979). For example, helium and oxygen mixtures may allow dives to 800 feet (~244 m) or greater, and nitrox mixtures (32% oxygen/68% nitrogen) may double bottom time at depths of 50 to 120 feet (15 to 36.5 m). Mixed gas diving is not routine, however, and only a few sample collectors, mainly professional divers, use it. In general, most marine organisms that have been studied to date have been collected by scuba diving.",

There are several disadvantages to these approaches: it is difficult to photograph the organisms in their habitat; encrusting organisms or organisms that grow in crevices, under ledges or on steep rock faces cannot be easily collected unless the hard substrate that supports the organism is collected as well; dredging and trawling put all collected samples in close contact with each other, therefore, some organisms may chemically contaminate others because of exudations or secretions of various compounds; and the environmental impact of dredging or trawling can be detrimental because the sampling is nonselective and habitats can be damaged or destroyed.",

The cost of this form of collection is obviously much higher than dredging or trawling (approximately double or triple); however, the environmental impact of this form of collection is negligible. ROVs are used extensively by the oil industry for survey and repair of oil platforms, and by marine biologists, geologists, and archeologists for survey of marine biota, geologic formations, or artifacts, respectively; however, the technology has not progressed sufficiently to render the ROVs cost effective in marine sample collection (S. Pomponi, personal communication). In contrast, manned submersibles, as exemplified by those at HBOI, which is located on the southeast coast of Florida, have performed very well in the selective and pin-point collection (and recollection) of deep water marine samples for pharmacological evaluation. The HBOI-Johnson-Sea-Link submersibles, for example, can accommodate up to a total of four passengers, and operate at depths of 3000 feet (915 m); they have an array of collection devices and associated sample storage containers to facilitate collection of organisms displaying a wide range of shapes and sizes, and they have various video and 35 mm cameras for purposes of documentation. Using the manned submersibles, the research group in the Division of Biomedical Marine Research (DBMR) at HBOI, for example, has collected samples at 100 to 3000 feet (30 to 915 m) from the Galapagos Islands, various locations in the Caribbean, Bahamas, Gulf of Mexico, and in the eastern Atlantic at the Canary and Madiera islands.",

            "text": "Because the collection program in the DBMR at HBOI to collect marine macroorganisms has been considered a very good one in the marine field, the collection strategy will be reviewed briefly. For the first several years of the research effort, beginning in 1984, the strategy was to collect representatives of as many shallow and deep water benthic organisms as could be found. As the research program evolved, the effort began to focus more on shallow and deep water sponges, due to their high incidence of biological activity in a variety of mechanism-based and whole cell assays and high abundance (especially as compared with such organisms as tunicates, some bryozoans, and hydroids). Because of the specialized tools available for collecting of deep water samples, an important niche of this sample collection effort has been deep water sponges. Out of approximately 150 described species from deep water environments in the West Indian biogeographic region (Van Soest and Stentoft 1988), the DBMR/HBOI collection contains nearly all these; further, the collection contains at least another 20 to 40 new, undescribed species of deep water sponges. For comparison, the total number of described shallow and deep water species from the West Indian biogeographic region is approximately 600 (Pulitzer-Finali 1986).",

To our knowledge, this is the largest marine sample collection in the world. The number of discrete samples (with unique taxonomy) is probably less than one-third, and is an estimate based on the taxonomic identification to the genera level on less than one-quarter of the samples. (Taxonomic identification of these samples has been driven by biological activity of the respective extracts; inactive samples have not been identified unless the taxonomic identification has been trivial.) Other marine research groups have successfully focused their collection and drug discovery efforts on cnidaria (see discussions on the pseudopterosins and the fuscosides), blue green algae (Moore and Patterson 1988; Moore et al. 1988), and marine-derived microorganisms (Gustafson et al. 1989; Kobayashi 1989; Okami 1988).",

Several general and several selective media are usually used for primary isolation cultures. For example, general media may include Zobell's marine agar (Zobell 1941) or peptone-yeast extract-seawater (Weyland 1969); actinomycete-selective media may include starch-yeast, extract\u2013seawater, chitin-seawater, or glycerol-arginine agar-seawater with trace metals and vitamins added (Nonomura and Ohara 1969) as well as cycloheximide to inhibit fungal growth.

            "text": "\nA controversial facet of marine-derived microorganisms is their putative role with respect to the origin of bioactive natural products from marine macroorganism\u2013microorganisms associations (Ireland et al. 1988). Symbiotic microorganisms have been repeatedly suggested as being the direct or indirect sources of bioactive metabolites in marine sponges (Frincke and Faulkner 1982; McCaffrey and Endean 1985) and other invertebrates, i.e., tunicates (Wright et al. 1990) and bryozoans (Fenical 1991). Symbiotic microorganisms, in the broadest working definition of the term, may be mutualistic or parasitic with the associated host animal and the symbiosis may be obligatory or facultative (Isenberg and Balows 1981). Actinomycetes are ubiquitous in the marine environment (Goodfellow and Haynes 1984; Weyland 1969), and marine invertebrates contain diverse communities of microorganisms (Bergquist 1978; Colwell 1991), including actinomycetes (E. Armstrong, personal communication) and cyanobacteria (Wilkinson 1980). Only several specific examples exist, however, in which secondary metabolites initially extracted and identified from macroorganisms, i.e., sponges, could be produced by fermentation of specific microorganism strains isolated from the respective macroorganism (Stierle et al. 1988; Elyakov et al. 1991). A noteworthy case in regard to marine vertebrates is that of the fish\u2013derived N\u20133 fatty acids, which seem to have great value for preventing cardiovascular disease (Leaf 1985); they may indeed be produced by associated marine microorganisms (Kitagawa et al. 1989).",

Analysis of these reviews indicates that a substantial amount of research has been conducted by chemists in Europe, especially Italy, and in Australia, New Zealand, Israel, Japan, and North America. The greatest number of marine-derived compounds have been isolated from shallow water organisms and their structures published by North American and Japanese researchers, who are located at academic institutions. To our knowledge, a greater number of academic and industrial research groups have become involved in the past several years in the search for biologically active and novel compounds from marine-derived microorganisms, and we expect that this increased effort will be reflected in both the scientific and patent literature in the next several years. Collection sites for the organisms that contain these compounds span the globe and include the Caribbean, Indo-Pacific, Mediterranean, Red Sea, and the Antarctic. Relatively few deep water marine organisms have been investigated, although they appear to be fertile grounds for biologically active compounds. Most shallow and deep water macroorganisms have been collected in tropical and subtropical latitudes, presumably because of milder conditions for sample collection, and because of the greater biodiversity of available organisms (Ricklefs 1973). These factors certainly facilitate the collection of a greater number of different organisms per collecting effort, though sample collection in higher latitudes has also been productive.",

During this time period, most marine natural products were derived from algae > sponges > cnidaria > echinoderms > tunicates > bryozoans > microbes. In part, this trend is related to the relative abundance of the respective organisms; i.e., tunicates, bryozoans, and hydroids are prolific producers of structurally unusual and biologically active natural products. However, these animals are not as abundant as algae, sponges, cnidarians, and echinoderms. With respect to their biosynthetic capabilities of secondary metabolites, algae, sponges, and cnidaria produce a greater proportion of terpenoids than any other compound type; in all three groups of organisms, the second most abundant biosynthetic class of compounds is polyketides. From our own analysis of the compounds reported since 1985, the phyletic distribution of marine natural products is approximately the same. However, the total number of compounds reported from sponges is now about the same as those reported in algae, and there have been significant increases in the number of compounds reported from tunicates and marine-derived microorganisms.",

Therefore, although our own experience has led us to focus our efforts on sponges, we believe it is premature to conclude that there may be preferred organisms for active marine\u2013derived compounds for any particular disease state; further, deep water macroorganisms, marine-derived microorganisms from any environment, and organisms from stressed environments, i.e., hydrothermal vents, anaerobic environments, etc., have not been sufficiently studied in any case.

TLC (for use of TLC in the field, see Norris and Fenical 1985) and 1H NMR (D.J. Faulkner, personal communication) have been used extensively to \u201cscreen\u201d crude extracts and solvent partitions for unusual, and, therefore, interesting patterns. More recently, 13C NMR has been used (Manes et al. 1985; Crews et al. 1986; Adamczeski et al. 1988). The structural elegance and number of the compounds found in various reviews on marine natural products attest to the success of this approach. It should be noted that isolation and structure elucidation of new, structurally complex compounds have provided immense gratification to marine natural products chemists and, indeed, to academic synthetic chemists who thrive on new synthetic challenges.",

Through a marine pharmacology program at the University of California-Santa Barbara (UCSB) and Scripps Institution of Oceanography (SIO), which has been funded for nearly 20 years by Sea Grant/NOAA, over 1200 pure compounds isolated primarily in the laboratories of W. Fenical (SIO) and D.J. Faulkner (SIO) have been evaluated by R. Jacobs (UCSB). Although many of these compounds were isolated based on the antibacterial, cytotoxic, and/or anti-inflammatory activities of the respective extracts, many were isolated based on purely chemical, chemotaxonomic, or chemical ecological interests and also screened by R. Jacobs (Jacobs et al. 1985). The anti-inflammatory properties of manoalide (see Section 5.5.3), for example, were discovered through an essentially chemically driven process. In contrast, the anti-inflammatory properties of the pseudopterosins (Section 5.5.4) and the fuscosides (Section 5.4.3) were discovered from a more activity-directed effort. The chemically driven approach has also served other valid scientific purposes, i.e., the structural information can be used to help solve taxonomic problems associated with a variety of marine organisms (Bergquist and Wells 1983; Fenical and Norris 1975; Lawson et al. 1984; Liaaen-Jensen et al. 1982; Pomponi et al. 1991).",

This approach is predicated on the assumption that agents can be identified that exhibit selective activity toward particular tumor histiotypes, and such selectivity is detectable in long-term, tissue-culture-adapted cell lines (Johnson and Hertzberg 1989).

Arguments against using mechanism-of-action screens as primary screens are that serendipity and pharmacology are lacking, and useful activities may be missed (Suffness et al. 1989). The arguments for whole-cell systems are that general pharmacokinetic problems are addressed; if a compound can't cross a membrane, it will test negative; also, if metabolic activation is required for activity, then it has a chance of occurring in whole-cell systems. In some areas such as immune modulation, whole cell assays, e.g., mixed lymphocyte reaction (MLR), mitogen response, and lymphokine production assays, rather than receptor or enzyme assays, continue to be used routinely by academic, government, and industrial research groups.",

Unfortunately, they were not very successful in finding compounds active against slow growing tumors in humans. Further, these in vivo assays were expensive, time consuming, and relatively insensitive (Suffness et al. 1989). Our experience at HBOI in other disease areas has shown that activity in in vitro antiviral assays does not translate well to in vivo activity, e.g., using Herpes simplex. In contrast, reasonable correlations exist between in vitro and in vivo antifungal activity, e.g., using Candida albicans, and between in vitro and in vivo immune suppressive activity, e.g., using the MLR as the in vitro assay and the graft-versus-host reaction (GVHR) or splenomegaly model as the follow up in vivo assay.",

In our experience, this combined approach has meant selecting extracts for chemical fractionation based on the biological activity profile of the crude extract. However, instead of using a bioassay-guided approach to purify the compounds responsible for the activity of the extract, NMR and TLC are used to isolate the chemically most interesting substances. Ideally, the structurally unusual or novel compounds are also responsible for the activity of the extract. This approach works well when the active compounds are present in high concentration and the assay turnaround time is longer than a couple of weeks. If the concentration is low, as was the case for the ecteinascidins (Wright et al. 1990), structurally complex isoquinoline alkaloids found at a level of 1 mg compound/1 kg of the tunicate,Ecteinascidia turbinata, the active compounds would have been overlooked completely, had a purely chemical approach been employed. This approach is indeed productive with respect to isolating numerous new compounds, at least some of which usually express some of the activity observed for the crude extract, but is obviously not the best method to identify the most active compounds if they are present in low concentration.",

If biologically active compounds are sought (biologically driven approach), mechanism-based, functional whole cell, tissue-based or in vivo assays are used to screen extracts and guide chemical fractionation. In regard to marine natural products, the biologically driven approach is very appropriate because many compounds whose structures have been published have not been thoroughly evaluated for biological activity. Further, as is well appreciated, a new assay redefines an otherwise exhausted compound and extract library into a whole new sample set. The particulars of a biologically driven approach are critical, however, if marine-derived compounds are sought with therapeutic potential. Indeed, discriminating and predictive assays are required to find compounds that will be used therapeutically not within the next year but rather in 5, 10, or 15 years from now!",

Academic and government research groups typically have some expertise or ready access to expertise in marine biology and ecology, sample collection or procurement, sometimes fermentation, isolation, and structure elucidation or synthesis (usually not both), and biological evaluation in a limited number of disease areas. Many industrial concerns usually have expertise in isolation, structure elucidation, synthesis, biological evaluation, process chemistry, fermentation, preclinical and clinical development, patenting, and marketing.

A distinct advantage of working with a pharmaceutical company is the possibility that if a marine-derived compound expresses a suitable profile from the company's point of view, resources and expertise to conduct structure-activity optimization studies may become available to study the compound, and to supply sufficient quantities of optimized compound through fermentation or synthesis for preclinical and clinical studies.

Kishi and his research group (Armstrong et al. 1989a, 1989b and references therein), must be considered quintessential scientific achievements. Palytoxin, a large polyoxygenated metabolite (molecular weight, 2681) obtained from the zoanthid Palythoa toxica and other Palythoa species, posed an extreme challenge; the structure elucidation was achieved by oxidatively degrading the molecule and elucidating the degradation products, which by themselves are larger than many natural products. From a biological activity viewpoint, it is especially noteworthy because it is the most potent nonproteinaceous toxin known, having a minimum lethal dose in guinea pigs of 0.15 \u03bcg/kg (Haddad et al. 1983). (By comparison, the most potent proteinaceous toxin, botulinus toxin A, has a minimum lethal dose of 0.00003 \u03bcg/kg.) In the two-stage mouse skin promotion assay, palytoxin is also a potent tumor promoter, although it fails to induce ornithine decarboxylase in mouse skin and does not bind to protein kinase C (Fujicki et al. 1984). Similar to phorbol ester-type tumor promoters, palytoxin has been found to stimulate arachidonic acid metabolism in rat liver cells (Levine and Fujicki 1985). Palytoxin also acts synergistically with phorbol ester-type tumor promoters to promote prostaglandin release (Levine and Fujicki 1985; Levine et al. 1986) and stimulate histamine release from rat peritoneal mast cells (Ouchi et al. 1986). Further, palytoxin has been found to inhibit epidermal growth factor (EGF) binding through a pathway that is not dependent upon protein kinase C (Wattenberg et al. 1987). Palytoxin is commercially available.",

From incorporation studies, dercitin disrupted DNA and RNA synthesis, whereas effects on protein synthesis were less pronounced; this profile is similar to the known intercalators actinomycin D and daunomycin. Further, the addition of either (calf thymus) DNA or (calf liver) RNA to solutions of dercitin altered the visible spectrum of dercitin in a manner consistent with binding, and equilibrium dialysis experiments revealed that dercitin binding to calf thymus DNA was saturable with an affinity of 3.1 \u03bcM and maximal binding of 0.2 mol dercitin for each base pair. Dercitin was found to relax covalently closed supercoiled \u03a6xl74 DNA with a concentration of 35 nM required for half-maximal relaxation; relaxation was reversible. DNA intercalation by dercitin was not found to be related to affects on topoisomerase II. Dercitin completely inhibited DNA polymerase I/DNase nick translation at 1 \u03bcM; however, the effects of dercitin on enzyme activity appeared to be secondary to changes in DNA conformation.",

The crude extract also expressed cytotoxicity against P-388 and modest immune suppressive activity; however, the cytotoxic properties relegated the extract as a lower priority immunosuppressive lead. Although in vitro P-388 and C. albicans activities were followed, fractions were also tested in the MLR assay. The cytotoxic fractions also exhibited potent immunosuppressive activity, and ultimately discodermolide was isolated from these fractions. Consequently, discodermolide was found to inhibit the in vitro proliferation of cultured murine P-388 leukemia cells with an IC50 of 0.5 \u03bcg/mL and to suppress the two-way mixed lymphocyte response of both murine splenocytes and human peripheral blood lymphocytes at 0.5 and 5 \u03bcg/mL, respectively. Very importantly, the immunosuppressive activity was accompanied by greater than 85% viability of the splenocyte cells at these concentrations (Gunasekera et al. 1990).",

These values are approximately 8-to 20-fold less potent than those that are commonly reported for suppression of murine MLR responses by the immunosuppressive standard, cyclosporine A (CsA). There was no evidence of cytotoxicity for murine splenocytes at discodermolide concentrations as high as 1.26 \u03bcM. Discodermolide was also active in suppressing the two-way MLR of human peripheral blood lymphocytes (PBL) (IC50 = 5.7 \u03bcM), of Con A (IC50 = 28.0 \u03bcM), and phytohemagglutinin (PHA) (IC50 = 30.1 \u03bcM)-stimulated PBL. Discodermolide was not cytotoxic to human PBL at concentrations as high as 80.6 \u03bcM. In a comparison with the standard immunosuppressive agent, CsA, discodermolide was equally effective in inhibiting T-cell receptor (TCR) and accessory cell independent, calcium dependent PMA-ionomycin induced proliferation of purified murine T-lymphocytes, with IC50 values of 9.0 and 14.0 nM for discodermolide and CsA. These findings suggest that discodermolide's suppressive activity reaches beyond T-cell activation via an inhibition of TCR mediated activation or interference with cell-to-cell interaction of B-cells or macrophages. Discodermolide did not significantly suppress the production of IL-2 in PMA-ionomycin stimulated murine splenocytes; however, the expression of the p55 associated IL-2 receptor as measured by fluorescence microscopy and flow cytometric analyses, using 7D4 antibody in these same cells was reduced. Similar results were obtained with PHA-stimulated blast cells obtained from human PBL in which the expression of p55 \u201cTac antigen\u201d (human IL-2 receptor) was evaluated. The p55 receptor in mouse and human normally has low affinity for IL-2 binding (Malek et al. 1986; Waldman 1986). However, this chain associates with an additional cell surface, a 75 kDa (p75) protein to form an IL-2 receptor of high affinity. Before this apparently unique mechanism of action can be ascribed to discodermolide, it would be of great interest to determine if such suppression extends to the high affinity, p55-p75 complex.",

The compound was evaluated in the GVHR splenomegaly assay, using the BALB/c \u2192 CB6F1 (BALB/c \u00d7 C57BL/6J)F1 model. In initial experiments, discodermolide was effective suppressing the GVHR in allogeneic grafted mice at 5.0, 2.5, and 1.25 mg/kg when administered as daily, i.p. injections for 7 days. While the two higher dosages resulted in the greatest suppression of the response (219% and 150%, respectively), these dosages were associated with a degree of morbidity in each group (two out of five and four out of five survivors, respectively). However, the lower dosage groups (1.25 mg/kg) continued to exhibit substantial suppression of their response (93%), but with no associated morbidity. Mice similarly treated with 150 mg/kg of CsA exhibited 80% suppression of the splenomegaly response. In order to determine an endpoint for the in vivo immunosuppressive action of discodermolide, a second dose-ranging experiment was initiated in which mice were treated with 2.5, 1.25, 0.312, and 0.156 mg/kg. Discodermolide suppressed the GVHR at all dosages tested with some morbidity once again associated with the 2.5 mg/kg group. However, all remaining groups exhibited suppression of the response, with the 0.156 group continuing to express 76% suppression. As a comparison, CsA-treated allogeneic grafted mice demonstrated 90% suppression. An endpoint for this suppression by discodermolide has yet to be determined.",

Production of Con A-induced-IL-2 was suppressed only in the highest discodermolide dosage group (5.0 mg/kg), in contrast to suppression of IL-2 by CsA. Discodermolide was also evaluated for its in vivo effect on the primary serum antibody response to the T-dependent antigen, sheep red blood cells (SRBC). Mice were treated with daily i.p. injections of 5.0 mg/kg discodermolide and 150 mg/kg of CsA as a comparative standard. The rather surprising result was that discodermolide did not suppress the SRBC antibody response, even at the highest dosage. By contrast, CsA-treated mice were suppressed in their ability to mount such a response, a result consistent with the known mechanism of action of CsA. This result indicates that the immunosuppressive effect of discodermolide appears not to be of a general nature and, in fact, seems to be unique.",

In later studies (Dale et al. 1989; Dale and Gescher 1989), the bryostatins were found to inhibit the growth of A549 lung cancer cells and to inhibit DNA replication, causing translocation of protein kinase C from the cytosol to membranes, and down regulation of protein kinase C, activity similar to that induced by phorbol esters. However, at relatively high concentrations, the bryostatins blocked their own inhibitory effect and the antireplicative action of phorbol esters. Therefore, the relationship between growth arrest and protein kinase C activities was not viewed as a straightforward one.",

In subsequent land-based assays, the tunicate extracts also exhibited in vitro activity against L1210 murine leukemia and against various RNA and DNA viruses, i.e., HSV-2, vaccinia, influenza (PR8), parainfluenza-3 (HA-1), Coxsackie (A-21), and equine rhinovirus. Three compounds were isolated initially, didemnins A through C (5.30A, 5.30B, and 5.30C), which contained both the antiviral activity and the cytotoxicity of the crude extracts (Rinehart et al. 1981b, 1981c). Structurally related compounds didemnins D and E were subsequently isolated and their structures elucidated (Rinehart et al. 1988). A total of 12 didemnins have been detected (Munro et al. 1987). The didemnins are all cyclic depsipeptides with five or more amino acid units in common. Didemnin D, the largest compound in the series whose structure has been published, contains 12 amino acid units, including standard amino acids (L-Glu, L-Thr, L-Leu, L-Pro), methylated amino acids (D-MeLeu, N,O-dimethyl-L-Tyr), and unusual groups (L-Lac-L-Pro, (3S,4R,5S)-isostatine, and (2S,4S)-hydroxyisovalerylpropionic acid). The isostatine unit was originally thought to be (3S,4R)-statine (Rinehart et al. 1988), and the hydroxyisovalerylpropionic acid was tentatively originally assigned as the 2R,4R-diastereomer and subsequently revised (Ewing et al. 1986).",

Subsequent in vitro studies revealed activity against a broad range of RNA viruses, including Rift Valley fever, Venezuelan equine encephalomyelitis virus, yellow fever, sandfly fever, and a Pichinde virus (Canonico et al. 1982). In vivo activity was demonstrated by didemnin B against lethal challenges of HSV-2 (DNA virus) in the mouse vaginal Herpes model (Canonico et al. 1982; Weed and Stringfellow 1983), and against Rift Valley fever (RNA virus) (Rinehart et al. 1988). Unfortunately, didemnin B was only effective in vivo against Herpes if topical applications were started prior to infection, and was not effective if applied after infection or given intraperitoneally. In general, the didemnins were found to be too toxic and not sufficiently selective for antiviral therapy (Rinehart et al. 1988; Munro et al. 1987).",

Didemnin B also inhibited protein synthesis in normal resting splenic mononuclear cells, but at concentrations much greater than those affecting Con A- and LPS-induced mitogenesis, and did not affect RNA synthesis at microgram/milliliter concentrations. Didemnin B also inhibited splenomegaly in the in vivo Simonsen GVHR at 0.05 to 0.3 mg/kg/day; however, concentrations of didemnin B of \u22650.2 mg/kg/day caused mortality, primarily through adverse effects on hepatic function.",

In another study (Yuh et al. 1989), didemnin B was evaluated in mouse and rat heterotopic cardiac transplantation models and the mouse popliteal lymph node hyperplasia assay and found to possess a low therapeutic index, i.e., doses of didemnin B that prolonged allograft survival or inhibited lymphocyte proliferation were quite toxic, evidenced by significant (reversible) body weight loss. Toxicity due to didemnin B appeared to be cumulative, which was presumed to be related to the lipophilicity and, therefore, accumulation of the compound in certain body tissues. The latter study concluded that the in vitro potency of didemnin B was (unfortunately) not sufficient to predict its efficacy as an immunosuppressant in vivo and that a suitable mechanism of action, i.e., as shown by the clinically used agent, cyclosporine, is highly important.",

Although manoalide and the crude methylene chloride extract from which it was derived demonstrated in vitro antibiotic activity against Streptomyces pyogenes and Staphylococcus aureus (de Silva and Scheuer 1980), it was the analgesic and anti-inflammatory activity of manoalide (Faulkner 1992; Jacobs et al. 1985) and a related series of compounds (Albizati et al. 1987; Kernan et al. 1987) that elicited substantial scientific and pharmaceutical interest.

Manoalide, like hydrocortisone, did not prevent the inflammation response normally induced by arachidonic acid, and it was postulated that the compound might inhibit enzyme reactions that were located upstream from arachidonic acid release and prostaglandin synthesis. This hypothesis was supported, in part, by in vivo time course studies showing that manoalide was most effective when applied within 5 minutes of PMA application, a very early time point considering the normal 3-hour period it required for the inflammatory reaction to manifest itself.",

In one study (de Freitas et al. 1984), manoalide (2 \u00d7 10\u22125 M) was shown to prevent the neurotoxic action of \u03b2-bungarotoxin on rat phrenic nerve-diaphragm preparations when preincubated with the toxin for as little as 25 minutes. In the same study, manoalide inhibited the hydrolysis of phosphatidylcholine by bee venom-derived PLA2, when preincubated with the enzyme for 1 hour. Subsequent studies demonstrated the irreversibility of the reaction and its pH dependence (Glaser and Jacobs 1984, 1986). Manoalide has also been shown to inhibit the activity of PLA2 from other sources, including cobra venom (Lombardo and Dennis 1985), while manoalide blocked the hydrolysis of both phosphatidylcholine and phosphatidylethanolamine by bee venom PLA2.",

A similar reaction occurred when manoalide was incubated with monomeric lysine, cysteine, and tryptophan, but not with their respective N-alpha-amino-blocked analogs. Through a series of straightforward but elegant experiments, a correlation between chromophore production and the specific amino acid residues modified upon binding of manoalide to PLA2 and corresponding enzymatic activity guided the team to this discovery. The results of these and subsequent experiments (Glaser et al. 1988) indicated that of the 11 lysine residues available for modification by manoalide, only three were actually modified upon binding by manoalide to bee venom PLA2. This contrasted with the modification of four of the six lysines present in cobra venom PLA2 (Lombardo and Dennis 1985). Subsequent investigations (Glaser et al. 1989) have revealed a number of structure activity relationships associated with the manoalide molecule and related analogs that may prove useful in determining the exact nature of the binding of manoalide to PLA2. These include the \u03b3-hydroxybutenolide ring system (selectivity for various sources of PLA2), the C-24 aldehyde (the irreversibility of PLA2 binding), and the hydrophobic alkyl regions of the molecule (cooperative binding with the ring system and PLA2 molecule).",

A key component of many inflammatory mediators and growth factors is their ability to bind to cellular receptors that, in turn, stimulate phosphoinositide turnover and Ca2+ mobilization as part of the signal transduction pathway. The major role of PLC in this process includes the activation of phosphatidylinositol\u20134,5\u2013biphosphate (PIP2), which gives rise to inositol 1,4,5-triphosphate (IP3) and 1,2 diacylglycerol (DAG) (Berridge 1983). The IP3 serves as a second messenger and binds to a receptor on the rough endoplasmic reticulum, which causes the release of Ca2+ from intracellular stores. DAG, on the other hand, is the physiological receptor for protein kinase C, an important second messenger enzyme involved in the regulation of cellular proliferation. While manoalide's primary pharmacological action involves inhibition of PLA2 activity, as previously noted, manoalide's less potent, but measureable inhibition of PLC activity prompted further investigations into its role as an antagonist of calcium-mediated, signal transduction-mediated control of cellular growth and regulation.",

Manoalide blocked both the EGF-mediated entry and release of Ca2+ from intracellular stores in a time-dependent manner with an IC50 of 0.4 \u03bcM. However, the production of inositol monophosphate (phosphoinositide metabolism) did not coincide with the EGF-mediated response. Manoalide also blocked the thyrotropin-releasing hormone (TRH)-dependent release of Ca2+ from intracellular stores in GH3 rat pituitary cells (0.5 \u03bcM for 20 minutes or 3.0 \u03bcM for 5 minutes), without concomitant inhibition of the formation of inositol phosphates from PIP2. In addition, manoalide also inhibited the K+\ndepolarization-activated Ca2+ channel in these cells and the activation of the channel by BAY K8644, with an IC50 = 1 \u03bcM. Manoalide also inhibited Ca2+ uptake of murine splenocyes stimulated with concanavalin A in a time- and temperature-dependent manner with an IC50 = 0.07 \u03bcM, thus indicating that at least in the cells examined in the study, manoalide's inhibitory action appeared to involve blockage of the calcium channel.",

Manoalide inhibited the production of prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) in a dose-dependent fashion by PMA-zymosan stimulated murine peritoneal macrophages. The release of leukotriene C4 (LTC4) in murine peritoneal macrophages stimulated with the calcium ionophore A23187 was similarly inhibited. Curiously, LTC4 production was enhanced by manoalide when the same cells were stimulated with zymosan. Both PGE2 and LTC4 production were reduced in resident (unstimulated) mouse peritoneal macrophages, indicating a direct inhibitory effect of manoalide on the cyclooxygenase pathway. Additionally, the release of 3H-arachidonic acid was shown to be partially reduced (37% inhibition) in the presence of 0.05 \u03bcM of manoalide. These results pointed to the possibility that manoalide's mechanism of action appeared to include all of the following:",

Pseudopterosin A (5.32A) contains a 3-O-\u03b2-Dxylopyranose, which is attached to the diterpene group at C-9; pseudopterosins B through D are structurally identical, except that the xylopyranose is monoacetylated at the various hydroxyl moieties.

            "text": "From studies of Caribbean sponge sterols by W. Bergmann and co-workers in the early 1950s (Bergmann and Burke 1956; Bergmann and Feeney 1950, 1951; Cohen 1966), the nucleosides spongouridine (5.33A) and spongothymidine (5.33B) were discovered serendipitously and found to possess antiviral activity. These discoveries aided in the development of antitumor agents and a generation of nucleoside antivirals. Through sporadic synthetic analog efforts to improve the activities of the compounds, cytosine arabinoside (Ara-C) (5.33C) was introduced nearly 20 years later as a clinically useful antitumor agent (Bodey et al. 1969), and nearly 30 years later, adenine arabinoside (Ara-A) (5.33D) was approved for use as an antiviral agent (Buchanan and Hess 1980). Cytosine arabinoside is produced synthetically, currently distributed as Cytosar-U\u00ae and indicated in acute nonlymphocytic leukemia, chronic myelocytic leukemia, and meningeal leukemia (Physicians Desk Reference 1991). Adenine arabinoside is obtained from fermentation cultures of Streptomyces antibioticus and currently distributed as Vira-A\u00ae (Physicians Desk Reference 1991). Through intravenous administration, Vira-A is indicated for the treatment of Herpes simplex virus encephalitis, Herpes simplex infections in newborns, and Herpes zoster virus due to reactivated varicela-roster virus infections in immunosuppressed patients. As an ointment, Vira-A\u00ae is used for the topical treatment of epithelial keratitis caused by Herpes simplex. Subsequent second- and third-generation nucleosides, i.e., acyclovir, AZT and dideoxycytidine, are highly useful antiviral agents and the objects of further medicinal chemistry studies to find even more efficacious and selective compounds.",

If the incentives are great enough, total synthesis of a complex natural product is undertaken; for example, the immune suppressant, FK506 (Jones et al. 1990; Nakatsuka et al. 1990). In contrast, pure didemnin B and bryostatin 1 were obtained for clinical trials from massive field collections of the source organisms Trididemnum solidum (Rinehart et al. 1988) and Bugula neritina (Schaufelberger et al. 1991), respectively. Didemnin B and bryostatin 1 serve well to illustrate a central problem of marine drug development, that of compound supply. While the biological richness of the marine environment is well appreciated, the prospects are usually not good for producing large amounts (kilograms) of marine compounds using field collection of organisms. Only the most abundant marine organisms can be collected in these amounts. An additional complication is the well-established variation in chemistry within a species as a function of geographical location. Thus, only in select cases with highly abundant organisms (i.e., some sponges, bryozoans, gorgonians, or algae) are extremely large-scale collections possible, and even then, environmental consequences can be severe. Therefore, while in some cases it might be possible to produce amounts of marine compound sufficient for preliminary clinical trial (gram quantities) from collection of the source organism, this approach cannot produce quantities needed for extended trials and the market (tens of kilograms).",

Fermentation is a mainstay in the pharmaceutical industry for compound production, in many cases providing supplies of structurally complex antibiotics, antitumor antibiotics, and immune suppressants, which are economically inaccessible by chemical synthesis. Fermentation of marine microorganisms may provide additional benefits outside drug development. An example of this is the culture of thermophilic bacteria isolated from marine geothermal sites (Borman 1991), whose thermally robust enzymes may have potential utility as industrial catalysts for the production of fuels, pharmaceuticals, or specialty chemicals. Indeed, the origin of several bioactive marine natural products isolated from sponges (Stierle et al. 1988; Elyakov et al. 1991) and other macroorganisms (Tamplin 1990) have been traced to microbial symbionts, and reports of success in the culture of these microorganisms are becoming more frequent.",

An illustrative case of such a scenario is available in the case of manoalide (see Section 5.5.3), a compound isolated from the marine sponge Luffariella variabilis (de Silva and Scheuer 1980). Manoalide was found to be a specific inhibitor of phospholipase A2 and C and is currently under development as an anti-inflammatory agent (see Section 5.5.3). The synthesis and evaluation of an extensive series of analogs was undertaken by several pharmaceutical companies and some of this work has been reported in the patent literature as well as the open literature (Garst et al. 1986; Katsumura et al. 1985; Lee 1990a, 1990b; Maullem et al. 1989).

            "text": "Finally, we believe that an important key to realizing the therapeutical potential of marine natural products is patience; the discovery by an academic, government, or industrial research group of a marine-derived compound with a satisfactory biological profile to become a lead compound may occur tomorrow or may not occur for years, and when it is discovered, the optimized compound may take another 10 to 15 years to reach the market. The wait will be worthwhile, both scientifically and commercially, because of the numerous, inevitable spin-offs: the continued discovery and development of biochemical probes or tools, a better understanding of the biology of particular disease states based on the unique biological activities of marine-derived compounds, a better understanding of the marine organisms that produce these compounds and of their respective environments, and advances in spectroscopy and synthesis as a consequence of conducting research on these often complex and structurally unusual molecules.",
