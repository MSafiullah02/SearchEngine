            "text": "Porcine diarrhoea can lead to weight loss and death in piglets. Coronaviruses (CoVs) are a major cause of porcine diarrhoea in pig herds worldwide, leading to important economic losses (Zuniga, Pascual\u2010Iglesias, Sanchez, Sola, & Enjuanes, 2016). Coronaviruses comprise four genera: alpha\u2010, beta\u2010 (lineages A\u2013D), gamma\u2010, and delta\u2010CoVs. The CoV antigen responsible for causing diarrhoea in swine has been identified (Ma et al., 2015). Porcine\u2010transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV), porcine epidemic diarrhoea virus (PEDV), and a natural TGEV deletion mutant porcine respiratory virus (PRCV) are alpha\u2010CoVs. Porcine hemagglutinating encephalomyelitis virus is a beta\u2010CoV, and porcine deltacoronavirus is a delta\u2010CoV. Coronaviruses have high mutation rates resulting in changes in tissue tropism, transmission pathways, and host specificities (Ma et al., 2015). Transmissible gastroenteritis virus is a member of the Coronaviridae family responsible for severe diarrhoea in suckling piglets (about 2 weeks old). It is an enveloped virus with a positive\u2010sense RNA genome of 28.5 kb, that was first reported in the USA in 1946 (Doyle & Hutchings, 1946). Transmissible gastroenteritis virus is currently divided into two distinct genogroups: the Miller cluster and the Purdue cluster (Hu et al., 2015). Transmissible gastroenteritis virus occurs in suckling piglets in swine\u2010producing areas in China (Weiwei et al., 2014). The TGEV genome was first sequenced by the analysis of polymerase chain reaction (PCR) products in 1993 (Chen, Pocock, & Britton, 1993).",

Porcine respiratory virus is an S gene deletion mutant of TGEV first identified in Belgium in 1984 (Pensaert, Callebaut, & Vergote, 1986). Porcine respiratory virus can replicate in respiratory tissues in infected piglets and demonstrates selective tropism with very little replication in intestinal tissues (Wang & Zhang, 2015). Porcine respiratory virus was identified as a TGEV mutant because of their antigenic and genetic relationships, though sequence analysis showed heterogeneity in the S, ORF3a, and ORF3b genes between TGEV and PRCV (Vaughn, Halbur, & Paul, 1995). Sequence analysis of TGEV strains also showed that large deletions or insertions in the ORF3 gene region (Kwon, Saif, & Jackwood, 1998). Given the potential involvement of the TGEV ORF3 gene in virus virulence or tropism, it is necessary to establish a method for its characterization.",

Multiplex nPCR has also been used to differentiate between PEDV and TGEV infections (Jung, Kim, Kim, Kim, & Chae, 2003). In this study, we developed an nPCR\u2010based diagnostic field test for the rapid detection of TGEV infection in farmed pigs. Furthermore, we detected TGEV field strains belonging to Miller cluster in China, and also provided the first evidence for a large deletion in ORF3 resulting in the loss of ORF3a deletion in China.",

Samples were diluted with phosphate\u2010buffered saline to make 10% (v/v) suspensions. The suspensions were vortexed for 1 min and clarified by centrifugation for 10 min at 5,000 g and the supernatants were collected for RT\u2010nPCR. A volume of 30 \u03bcl of viral RNA was extracted from 140 \u03bcl of supernatants using a QIAamp Viral RNA Mini Kit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany), and first\u2010strand cDNA was synthesized with M\u2010MLV reverse transcriptase (Promega, Madison, WI, USA) using Oligo d(T)18 (TaKaRa, Dalian, China), according to the manufacturers\u2019 instructions. Two primer pairs, TGE\u2010ORF3\u2010F1 and TGE\u2010ORF3\u2010F2, and TGE\u2010ORF3\u2010F1n and TGE\u2010ORF3\u2010F2n (Table S1), were designed and synthesized for RT\u2010nPCR according to the corresponding sequence of TGEV strain H16 (GenBank No. FJ755618). First PCR was performed in a total volume of 25 \u03bcl containing 10 ng of cDNA template, 1\u00d7 EmeraldAmp PCR Master Mix (TaKaRa), and a 0.5 \u03bcM concentration of each primer. After initial denaturation at 95\u00b0C for 5 min, amplification was performed for 30 cycles, each consisting of denaturation at 95\u00b0C for 30 s, annealing at 50\u00b0C for 45 s, and elongation at 72\u00b0C for 60 s. Second PCR was performed in a total volume of 25 \u03bcl containing 1 \u03bcl of product of the first PCR, 1\u00d7 EmeraldAmp PCR Master Mix (TaKaRa), and a 0.5 \u03bcM concentration of each primer. After initial denaturation at 95\u00b0C for 5 min, amplification was performed for 30 cycles as the described for the first PCR. The outer span, including primers TGE\u2010ORF3\u2010F1 and TGE\u2010ORF3\u2010F2, was 1602 base pairs (bp), and the inner span, including primers TGE\u2010ORF3\u2010F1n and TGE\u2010ORF3\u2010F2n, was 1417 bp. Fragments containing the full\u2010length TGEV ORF3 gene were amplified from samples using these primers. Furthermore, a pair of primers designated TGEV\u2010d\u2010F1 and TGEV\u2010d\u2010F2 was created to allow the rapid detection of TGEV field strains. PCR products were excised from 1.0% agarose gels, purified using an AxyPrep\u2122 DNA Gel Extraction Kit (Axygen Scientific, Inc., CA, USA), cloned into the pMD18\u2010T, and introduced into Escherichia coli DH5\u03b1 competent cells (TaKaRa) by transformation, according to the manufacturer's instructions. Eight recombinant DNA clones were sequenced by Comate Bioscience Company Limited (Jilin, China) and aligned using the MUSCLE method in MEGA5 software.

All the sequences in this study have been deposited in the GenBank database. The field strains and their accession numbers are shown in Table S3. The identities among the sequences ranged from 98.6% to 99.9%. Phylogenetic tree analysis of ORF3 showed that the eight TGEV ORF3 genes all belonged to the Miller cluster (Figure 1). CH\u2010SY and CH\u2010ZB were closely correlated with Miller M6, which is a virulent TGEV strain, while CH\u2010SH was correlated with Miller M60, which is an attenuated TGEV strain. Previous reports showed that the Purdue cluster also occurred in China (Weiwei et al., 2014). The current results thus indicate that the Miller, as well as the Purdue cluster, exists in Chinese field strains of TGEV. A large deletion (81 nucleotides [nt]) in ORF3 was found in three strains (CH\u2010LNCT, CH\u2010MZL, and CH\u2010SH) (Figure 2a). This may indicate that the ORF3\u2010deleted and non\u2010deleted TGEV field strains were both detected at farm in China.",

The PCR products of TGE\u2010ORF3\u2010F1 and TGE\u2010ORF3\u2010F2 were used as a template. The PCR products of CH\u2010SDRZ, CH\u2010SY, CH\u2010ZB, and CH\u2010BJ were 420 bp indicating no deletion, while those of CH\u2010LNCT, CH\u2010SH, CH\u2010MZL were 339 bp, indicating the presence of the 81\u2010nt deletion (Figure 2b). This result validated the previous sequencing results. Transmissible gastroenteritis virus is difficult to grow in cell culture, and virus lacking 3a replicates particularly poorly in cell cultures (Paul, Vaughn, & Halbur, 1997). We tried to isolate the ORF3a\u2010deleted TGEV virus from samples prepared as above, but unfortunately were unable to do so (data not shown).",

(McGoldrick, Lowings, & Paton, 1999). Similarly, a small plaque variant and two non\u2010pathogenic cell culture\u2010adapted strains of TGEV have deletions or insertions that alter ORF3 (Zhang et al., 2007). These results suggest that the ORF3 region of the TGEV genome is an important determinant for regulating viral virulence (Zuniga et al., 2016). Transmissible gastroenteritis virus strain 96\u20101933 is a virulent variant isolated in England in 1996 (Jones & Paton, 1996), including an intact S gene, but with a deletion in ORF3a. There have been no other relevant reports of ORF3a\u2010deleted TGEV until the current study, which demonstrated an 81\u2010nt deletion in ORF3a. However, the locations of the current and 96\u20101933 deletions differed; gene loss in 96\u20101933 was due to a discontinuity in ORF3a, while the deletion of TGEV ORF3a in the current study was continuous, which has not previously been reported in TGEV.",

The leader RNA\u2010binding site and ORF3a start site were included in the deleted region identified in TGEV the current study (Figure 3), and in the sequences of PRCV\u2010ISU\u20101 (Lai, Welter, & Welter, 1995; Zhang et al., 2007). Previous studies on the genetic structures of PRCV and TGEV revealed two unique characteristics. First, the PRCV S gene lacks nt 621\u2013681, resulting in a smaller S glycoprotein in PRCV than TGEV. Second, TGEV and PRCV differ in the ORF3 region; the leader RNA\u2010binding site (CTAAAC) in PRCV is altered or partially deleted before the ORF3a gene (Wang & Zhang, 2015).",

Sequence comparison showed that TGEV Miller strains had a closer relationship with PRCV\u2010ISU\u20101 compared with Purdue strains. In this study, eight ORF3 sequences belonging to Miller cluster were identified in field strains of TGEV.
