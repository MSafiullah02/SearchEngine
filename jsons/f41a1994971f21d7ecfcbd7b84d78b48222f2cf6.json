Residents were told that their participation is voluntary, and that choosing not to participate in the interview will not affect their performance evaluations. Residents were also ensured that their answers will remain confidential. No resident approached declined to participate, and no incentives were provided for participation. Interviews were conducted and recorded by two general surgery residents. No repeat interviews were conducted. Personal identifiers were not recorded. All the data were collected in accordance with the requirements of our Institutional Review Board after an exemption status was obtained. The interview technique was open-ended with follow-up questions related to the participants' answers and responses. Participants were asked the following two questions: 1. What are your main concerns related to the COVID-19 outbreak? 2. What would you recommend for improving resident preparedness for COVID-19 emergency response? Responses were independently coded, and the resulting nominal data are presented as percentage of responses per category. The Mann-Whitney rank sum test was used to compare ordinal scale variables. A P value of <0.05 was considered statistically significant. Although we did not ask our participants about their level of professional commitment to patient care during this pandemic, all residents self-expressed their readiness to take care of COVID-19 patients despite the risk of personal or familial harm. Their recommendations for preparedness for the response to the influx of COVID-19 patients were to increase testing capacity, ensure adequate personal protective equipment availability, and transition to a shift schedule in order to minimize exposure risk and prevent burnout.",

They suggest evaluating the feasibility of health care workers' family members receiving priority for diagnostic testing, vaccination, and treatment. These measures would be challenging in the current U.S. healthcare climate, given limited testing capacity and lack of vaccines or specific therapies. Clear and supportive conversations about home preparation to minimize family transmission are important to reduce the anxiety of health care workers (4).",

A rotating shift schedule would allow exposed residents periods of self-quarantine without compromising patient care. In later phases of the pandemic, a shift schedule would allow residents infected with COVID-19 to recuperate without risking patient transmission. Indeed, many residency programs in Boston have moved toward a shift-based schedule, in which residents work for 1-2 weeks and then are rotated off for the same amount of time. Residents are discouraged from interacting with off-rotation residents to reduce the amount of resident-resident transmission.",

However, the total number of participating residents is within the range of sample sizes for other resident education studies in the surgical literature. Interviewing a larger group of chief residents from residency programs across the country would be an important next step in generalizing and validating the findings of our study. Second, it is possible that responses to the interview questions may include professional desirability and conformity bias, as residents may have been inclined to provide professionally acceptable responses. By having resident peers conducting the interviews we hoped to minimize the risk of conformity bias. Third, in our study we did not collect participant personal data, such as marital status, living conditions, childbearing responsibilities, and care of their elderly parents.
