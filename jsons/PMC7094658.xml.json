            "text": "The Poxviridae has an extremely wide host range in both vertebrates and invertebrates and possesses a relatively large dsDNA genome (130\u2013300 kb) (Moss, 2001). The family consists of two subfamilies, Chordopoxvirinae (ChPV) or vertebrate poxviruses and Entomopoxvirinae (EPV) or insect poxviruses. Eight genera of ChPV and three genera (EPV A, B, and C, hereafter group A, B, and C) of EPV, have been established based on virus structure and host range (Esposito et al., 2000). Group A [type species, Melolontha melolontha EPV (MmEPV)], has an ovoid virion and infects coleopteran insects. Group B [type species, Amsacta moorei EPV (AmEPV)], also has an ovoid virion but infects lepidopteran and orthopteran insects. Group C [type species, Chironomus luridus EPV (ClEPV)], has a brick-shaped virion and infects dipteran insects (Esposito et al., 2000). Both the MsEPV and AmEPV genomes have been completely sequenced (Afonso et al., 1999; Bawden et al., 2000) and the analysis of their genome organization and gene composition demonstrated a lack of significant co-linearity between them, suggesting an inadequate classification of group B entomopoxviruses (Afonso et al., 1999; Bawden et al., 2000). The sequence and phylogenetic relationships among single genes of several EPVs in groups A and B have been reported. These include spheroidin, a major component of the large crystalline occlusion body that is characteristic of EPVs and absent from ChPVs (Hall and Moyer, 1991; Sanz et al., 1994; Li et al., 1997; Sriskantha et al., 1997; Mitsuhashi et al., 1998; Hernandez\u2013Crespo et al., 2000); fusolin, a spindle protein found primarily in lepidopteran EPVs (Dall et al., 1993; Hayakawa et al., 1996; Mitsuhashi et al., 1997); DNA polymerase (Mustafa and Yuen, 1991; Gauthier et al., 1995); poly(A) polymerase (PAP) regulatory small subunit, 30k virion protein and a 17k ORF (Sriskantha et al.,1997; Crnov and Dall, 1999); thymidine kinase (Lytvyn et al., 1992); nucleoside triphosphate phosphohydrolase I (NPH I) (Yuen et al., 1991; Sriskantha et al., 1997; Li et al., 1998); and the rifampicin resistance protein (Osborne et al., 1996). No genes have been sequenced from group C EPVs except for those reported previously by our laboratory for Diachasmimorpha longicaudata EPV (DlEPV). DlEPV homologues of poxvirus genes that encode putative proteins include DNA helicase, a Drosophila related oligoribonuclease, transcription factor, and other DlEPV-specific sequences (Mwaengo and Lawrence, 2003), DNA dependent RNA polymerase (Lawrence, 2002), and rifampicin-resistance protein (AF159588).",

            "text": "DlEPV was originally found in the poison gland apparatus of the female braconid wasp, Diachasmimorpha longicaudata, which parasitizes larvae of the Caribbean fruit fly, Anastrepha suspensa and other tephritid fruit flies (Lawrence and Akin, 1990). DlEPV is injected into larval hosts along with wasp eggs. The virus then invades and replicates in the hemocyte cytoplasm from which progeny bud into the hemolymph to infect other hemocytes (Lawrence, 2002). Infected hemocytes lose their adhesive property, and undergo apoptosis, and are unable to encapsulate the wasp eggs (Lawrence, 2005). These pathologies do not occur within the wasp where the virus is confined to the cuticle-lined poison gland (Lawrence and Akin, 1990; Lawrence, 2002). Analogous to other endoparasitoid viruses, DlEPV is considered to be a symbiotic agent of the parasitic wasp, because it disrupts normal hemocyte function in the host that results in host immunosuppression and parasite survival (Lawrence, 2005). DlEPV is unique in EPVs in that it does not produce an occlusion body in infected host hemocytes (Lawrence, 2002). Therefore we consider DlEPV to belong to group C of the subfamily Entomopoxvirinae or to a new group that reflects its unique biological property as a symbiotic EPV. Studies are in progress to determine how DlEPV progeny is acquired by neonate wasps or is maintained throughout wasp development.",

The best-characterized viral symbionts of parasitic wasps are the polydnaviruses (PDVs) that possess segmented DNA genomes and are transmitted vertically to wasp offspring through proviral integration in the wasp genome (Fleming and Summers, 1991; see also a review by Kroemer and Webb, 2004). Unlike DlEPV, PDVs do not replicate in their hosts (Webb, 1998; Whitfield and Asgari, 2003). However, some PDV messages are expressed in various host tissues (Le et al., 2003). Several putative genes have been characterized and proposed as part of the PDV immunosuppression mechanism. These include cys-motif, rep, vinnexin, vankyrin gene in the Ichnovirinae subfamily and egf, ptp in the Brachovirinae subfamily (Kroemer and Webb, 2004).",

RNA viruses including reo viruses (Bigot et al., 1995; Stoltz and Makkay, 2000), a cypovirus of D. pulchellus (RV-2) (Renault et al., 2003), and a picorna-like virus have also been discovered from wasps of lepidopterans (see papers in this issue). DlEPV and DlRhV, a rhabdovirus from D. longicaudata (Lawrence and Akin, 1990), coronavirus-like and reovirus-like particles from Psytalia (Opius) concolor (Jacas et al., 1997), and virus-like particles (VLPs) from several Leptopilina sp. parasites of Drosophila sp. (Rizki and Rizki, 1990; Dupas et al., 1996; Morales et al., 2005) have been described in dipterans. Unlike PDVs, these latter viruses apparently replicate in their dipteran hosts but very few of their genes have been sequenced and their methods of transgenerational transmission are unknown.",

Conserved domain (CD) analysis was performed with three DlEPV ORFs not found in poxviruses, to evaluate a possible role of their putative gene products within the context of the DlEPV-wasp-dipteran host interaction. The data indicate that DlEPV is undoubtedly a member of the Poxviridae but this virus also contains non-poxvirus genes, suggesting its possible acquisition of genes from its dipteran host and/or host-related microflora, that probably reflect an earlier evolutionary relationship with dipterans. The phylogenetic relationships identified between DlEPV and other EPVs suggest that DlEPV is different from the group B EPVs and should be classified as a group C EPV since it is pathogenic to its dipteran host and not to its hymenopteran vector.",

Briefly, the gel plugs were melted and about 2.5\u20135 \u03bcg of the released DNA was sheared (sonicated) and the resulting fragments were size fractionated by agarose gel electrophoresis and gel filtration to yield fragments of 1\u20133 kb. Fragments were blunt ended, then cloned into pUC19 and the ligated plasmid DNA was used to transform DH10B competent cells. The transformants were screened by LB agar plate containing 25 \u03bcg/ml ampicillin, oxacilin (25 \u03bcg/ml), and 800 mg/plate each IPTG and X-gal (2%). White colonies were isolated and grown overnight in Terrific broth medium containing ampicillin. Two hundred to 500 ng of plasmid DNA were prepared from the culture by the BioRobot 9600 (QIAgen) and used as template for labeling with ABI Prism BigDye Terminator Cycle Sequencing Ready Reaction kit [Perkin-Elmer Applied Biosystems (ABI), Foster City, CA].

Dye terminator was removed by Sephadex G-50 superfine column (Sigma, St. Louis, MO) in water. The reactions were electrophoresed on an ABI 377 sequencer and the chromatograms were edited with Analysis version 1.2.1 (ABI) and assembled into consensus contiguous DNA sequences (contigs) using a package of Phred/Phrap/Consed software (Ewing and Green, 1998; Ewing et al., 1998; Gordon et al., 1998).",

These homologues had ORFs of similar size to those of DlEPV and E-values of 2.00E\u221203 to 1.00E\u2212127 that demonstrated high homology with the DlEPV ORFs. However, homologues of putative GGT, eIF4A, and \u03bb-Int were absent from the poxvirus protein database. The evidence that the GGT and eIF4A ORFs belong to DlEPV is supported by their presence on the same sequence contig as those ORFs that had a hit to poxvirus proteins in the Blast search (Table 1). The contig (ID#137) containing \u03bb-Int ORF had no poxvirus blast hit (Table 1). However, at least three other ORFs within the same contig showed homology to Plasmodium falciparum putative proteins (data not shown). This eliminates the possibility of bacterial contamination.",

The unrooted NJ trees of the 21 aligned poxvirus sequences for virion surface protein, metalloprotease, putative membrane protein and late transcription factor-3 were similar (data not shown). Therefore the tree for virion surface protein (Fig. 2a) is used as a representative to demonstrate this relationship. The phylogenetic trees of the virion surface protein homologue (Fig. 2a), PAP regulatory small subunit (Fig. 2b), and of the concatenated multiple alignments of all five DlEPV poxvirus-related sequences (Fig. 2c), all corroborate established reports that fowlpox virus occurs in a clade that is the most distant of the non-orthopoxviruses (Fig. 2a). With the exception of the PAP sequences (Fig. 2b), the poxvirus homologues, suggest that DlEPV arose between fowlpox virus and the divergence of the group B EPVs (Figs. 2a and c). In contrast, the phylogenetic tree for the PAP regulatory small subunit showed a slight difference in the relationship of DlEPV to the group B EPVs (Fig. 2b). AmEPV possesses two PAP regulatory small subunit homologues, AmEPV ORF115 and ORF060 (NP 064897 and NP 064842, respectively). The former is closely related to MsEPV PAP regulatory small subunit (MsEPV ORF041, NP 048112) and the latter is closely related to Heliothis armigera EPV (HaEPV) PAP regulatory small subunit (Crnov and Dall, 1999). However the low bootstrap value (49) for the MsEPV ORF041 and AmEPV ORF115 compared to the value (100) for the AmEPV ORF060 and HaEPV (Fig. 2b) along with the value (67) for DlEPV, may indicate that DlEPV PAP regulatory small subunit is more closely related to the AmEPV ORF060/HaEPV group than to the AmEPV ORF060/MsEPV ORF041 group (Fig. 2b). In any event, even the tree derived from the concatenated alignments of the five DlEPV ORFs (including the PAP sequences), confirms the result from the four individual phylogenetic trees (represented in Fig. 2a), that DlEPV is positioned between fowlpox virus and the group B EPVs (Fig. 2c).",

However, the DlEPV GGT possesses only five of the 15 conserved amino acids in the signature sequence of the GGT (Fig. 1g). Amino acid substitution analysis of human GGT revealed that Asp422 and Asp423 (Aspartic acid at positions #422 and 423, respectively) and Ser451 or Ser452 (serine at positions 451 or 452, respectively) are crucial for enzyme activity (Ikeda et al., 1995a, Ikeda et al., 1995b). In a multiple alignment of the DlEPV GGT homologue and 12 GGT sequences from a variety of organisms such as Homo sapiens, D. melanogaster, and Vibrio parahaemolyticus, only the Ser residues were found in corresponding positions, but Asp-422 and -423 in human GGT were instead replaced by Asn and Ser, respectively, in the DlEPV GGT homologue (Fig. 1g).",

The \u03bb-Int is a prototype of a diverse family of tyrosine recombinases that rearranges DNA duplexes by means of conservative site-specific recombination reactions (Campbell, 1992). The \u03bb-Int protein has four highly conserved residues, a tetrad, that includes tyrosine in an active site, which is directly involved in transesterification (Arg212, His308-XX-Arg311, Tyr343) (Argos et al., 1986; Abremski and Hoess, 1992). \u03bb-Int possesses three distinct structural domains: an N-terminal domain (aa residues 1\u201364) responsible for binding to distal arm sites on the phage DNA (Moitoso de Vargas et al., 1988), a central domain (aa residues 65\u2013169) required for high-affinity binding to core-type sites), and the C-terminal catalytic domain (aa residues 170\u2013356) (Tirumalai et al., 1998). The catalytic domain is known to be competent in specifically recognizing and cleaving its cognate core DNA substrates, either as full- or half sizes (Tirumalai et al., 1997). When a 3D structure of the DlEPV \u03bb-Int homologue [predicted by 3D-pssm (Fischer et al., 1999)] is manually aligned with the conserved tetrads in the catalytic domains of \u03bb-Int (PDB entry #, 1AE9A) and Cre (PDB entry #, 1CRXA) tyrosine recombinases, the same tetrad is conserved in DlEPV (Fig. 3\n). The DlEPV \u03bb-Int tetrads align closely with those of \u03bb-Int and Cre recombinases, with the Arg (R)\u2013Arg (R) spacing (78 aa) and Arg (R)\u2013Tyr (Y) spacing (32 aa) of DlEPV integrase homologue falling within the range found in other tyrosine recombinases (Esposito and Scocca, 1997) (Fig. 3). Additionally, the secondary structure of the DlEPV \u03bb-Int homologue consists of a similar number of helices and overall interhelical spacing as do the \u03bb-Int and Cre recombinases (Fig. 3).",

The eIF4A is a prototype helicase of the DEAD box helicase family that consists of eight motifs (I, Ia, Ib, II, III, IV, V, and VI) (Tanner and Linder, 2001). The DlEPV eIF4A homologue has a single amino acid substitution in motif Ib, where the last amino acid is altered from Ile (I) to Met (M), and five amino acid substitutions in motif V (Fig. 4\n). The distances between the N-terminus and motif I (49 aa) of DlEPV and between motif VI and the C-terminus (39 aa) along with the overall arrangement of the motifs, are very similar to those of DEAD box helicases (Nunes-D\u00fcby et al., 1998). Interestingly, the DlEPV sequences in all motifs are almost identical (except for six residues) with those of Drosophila melanogaster (Fig. 4), a cyclorraphous dipteran like the A. suspensa host within which DlEPV is pathogenic (Lawrence, 2002).",

Additionally co-linearity of conserved genes on the genome is significantly reduced or lost in these viruses and it has been suggested that a number of genes are acquired (McLysaght et al., 2003; Gubser et al., 2004).",

            "text": "The presence of DlEPV genes that encode new poxvirus putative proteins, suggests that these proteins likely, play a role in the interactions of the virus with either its wasp vector, the dipteran host, or both. Since GGT, eIF4A, and \u03bb-Int occur in bacteria, Drosophila, phage, and other organisms but not in poxviruses, it is likely that these genes were acquired from other organisms (probably the A. suspensa host and/or microflora) by DlEPV and used in some way, probably to facilitate aspects of viral pathogenicity and/or wasp survival. GGT has been found in many organisms except for viruses (PROSITE ID, PDOC00404). It catalyzes the transfer of the gamma-glutamyl moiety of glutathione to an acceptor that may be an amino acid, a peptide, or water (forming glutamate) (Tate and Meister, 1985). GGT plays a key role in the gamma-glutamyl cycle, a pathway for the synthesis and degradation of glutathione, which is an antioxidant and detoxifying agent (Tate and Meister, 1985). Thus, GGT could be employed to maintain a physiologically stable environment and enhance development of the wasp larva. Indeed, Nappi et al. (1995) have proposed that free radicals released from Drosophila hemocytes kill the Leptopilina sp. parasitic wasps in Drosophila larvae. Also, Li et al. (2003) reported that a major component of VLP, VLP1, from the endoparasitoid Venturia canesens, which has been reported as a non-enzymatic molecule of the hydroperoxide glutathione peroxidase, could function as an antioxidant that reduces peroxide phospholipids and cholesterols within membranes (Ursini et al., 1981; Ursini et al., 1986).",

The PDV genes are then expressed in the host and disrupt the host's immune response, thus protecting the developing wasp (Belle et al., 2002). However, unlike DlEPV, no PDV virion replication occurs in the host. It is not yet known whether portions of the DlEPV genome are integrated into the D. longicaudata wasp genome. However, this phenomenon has also been suggested for other wasp symbiotic viruses (see Reineke and Asgari, 2005), and could be a shared mechanism underlying what we term \u201caccommodative symbiosis\u201d. If such viral integration exists for viruses with non-segmented genomes, like DlEPV, then the integration could (1) prevent the wasp from recognizing the virus as non-self (hence \u201caccommodative symbiosis\u201d) or (2) facilitate the expression of viral genes early in the infection of the host (prior to virus morphogenesis and replication) to protect the wasp egg from encapsulation as suggested for PDVs (Webb, 1998).",

Although the DlEPV eIF4A ORF contained DEAD motifs that were homologous with those of DEAD helicases, the highly significant E-values of the eIF4A hit in the Blast search indicated that the DlEPV ORF encodes a putative protein that is more closely related to eIF4A proteins than to helicases. Furthermore, this close relationship is supported by the predicted secondary/tertiary structure similarities (Fig. 4). eIF4A has been identified as an essential single copy gene in D. melanogaster (Dorn et al., 1993). An alignment of DlEPV putative eIF4A protein sequence to DEAD helicase motifs and D. melanogaster eIF4A revealed a strong similarity between them (Fig. 4), and suggests a common ancestral origin of these proteins. Recent reports on the expression of eIF4A from D. melanogaster in different stages demonstrated the ubiquitous presence of two abundant eIF4A gene transcripts throughout development. However, the levels of the eIF4A protein decreased significantly (40%) only in third instar larvae (Dorn et al., 1993; Hernandez et al., 2004). The third instar is the last developmental stage of fruit fly larvae and is the stage normally parasitized by D. longicaudata females (Lawrence et al., 1976). This raises the question of whether a decrease of eIF4A may be replenished by DlEPV to strengthen the protein synthesis machinery of the host larvae, in order to support virus replication and wasp development. Further studies on the expression and function of these DlEPV genes are needed to clarify their role, if any, in these parasite-host interactions.",
