Current anti-HBV medications have a number of drawbacks, such as adverse effects and drug resistance; thus, novel potential anti-HBV reagents are needed. Selenium (Se) has been shown to be involved in both human immunodeficiency virus and hepatitis C virus infections, but its role in HBV infection remains unclear. To address this, sodium selenite (Na 2 SeO 3 ) was applied to three HBV cell models: HepG2.2.15 cells, and HuH-7 cells transfected with either 1.1 or 1.3\u00c2 HBV plasmids. Cytotoxicity of Na 2 SeO 3 was examined by Cell Counting Kit-8. Levels of viral antigen expression, transcripts, and encapsidated viral DNA were measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, northern blot, and Southern blot, respectively. There was no obvious cytotoxicity in either HepG2.2.15 or HuH-7 cells with <2.5 mM Na 2 SeO 3 . Below this concentration, Na 2 SeO 3 suppressed HBsAg and HBeAg production, HBV transcript level, and amount of genomic DNA in all three tested models, and suppression level was enhanced in line with increases in Na 2 SeO 3 concentration or treatment time. Moreover, the inhibitory effect of Na 2 SeO 3 on HBV replication can be further enhanced by combined treatment with lamivudine, entecavir, or adefovir. Thus, the present study clearly proves that Na 2 SeO 3 suppresses HBV protein expression, transcription, and genome replication in hepatoma cell models in a dose-and time-dependent manner.",

An estimated two billion people, roughly 30% of the world's population, have been infected with HBV, and over 350 million patients have chronic hepatitis B (CHB) [Liaw and Chu, 2009] . Each year, about 786,000 deaths are caused by HBV infection or its associated liver diseases [Lozano et al., 2012] , including hepatic decompensation, cirrhosis, and hepatocellular carcinoma; HBV-infected individuals are at higher risk of all these HBV related diseases [Lee et al., 2013] . Although efficient prophylactic vaccines have been developed for prevention of HBV infection, there is still no cure for existing infection. The current clinical applied therapeutic agents for CHB are mainly immunomodulators and nucleoside/nucleotide analogues, which can be used either separately or in combination [Yuen and Lai, 2001; Papatheodoridis et al., 2008; Scaglione and Lok, 2012; Trepo et al., 2014] . Interferon alpha (IFN-a) is the best-known immunodulator, and controls HBV infection by stimulating the cellular antiviral cytokine expression to inhibit viral replication and by enhancing the host immune responses to eliminate the HBV-infected hepatocytes [Yuen and Lai, 2001] . However, its poor response against CHB, high commercial cost, and various adverse effects (AEs) limit the wide clinical application of this drug.",

These oral antiviral agents mainly target HBV polymerase and reverse transcriptase by rapidly and potently inhibiting their activities. Although nucleoside/nucleotide analogues have fewer AEs, they fail to eradicate HBV covalently closed circular DNA (cccDNA) in the nuclei of infected hepatocytes, which results in viral relapse after stopping the medication [Yuen and Lai, 2001; Trepo et al., 2014] . In addition, the development of drug resistance during therapy also limits the effective application of nucleoside/nucleotide analogues. Some of the most recent drugs, such as entecavir and tenofovir, have been observed to induce only a very low level of drug resistance, but long-term application may still induce expansion of HBV strains with mutations resisting these drugs [Trepo et al., 2014] . Thus, developing novel effective therapeutic approaches and agents is a necessary step against HBV infection.",

            "text": "Selenium (Se) is an essential trace mineral for animals and humans. In addition to antioxidant activity, Se has also shown anti-inflammatory and anticancer properties [Rayman, 2000] . Se functions in either its inorganic forms, such as sodium selenite (Na 2 SeO 3 ) and sodium selenate, or its organic forms, such as the amino acids selenocysteine (Sec) and selenomethionine (SeMet), and multiple selenomolecles as intermediary metabolites [Papp et al., 2007] . Upon absorption, the inorganic salts in their oxidized forms [selenite (Se 4\u00fe ) or selenate (Se 6\u00fe )] can be reduced to selenide (Se 2\u00c0 ) by using reducing equivalents from reduced glutathione and reduced nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH) [Zeng and Combs, 2008] . As a storage mechanism, SeMet can replace normal methionine in protein synthesis, and then be released reversibly by the normal metabolic process as necessary [Schrauzer, 2000] . Sec is probably the most abundant biologically active form of selenium in vivo, and can be specially incorporated into selenoproteins as the 21st amino acid encoded by the UGA codon [Metanis and Hilvert, 2014] . Importantly, Sec might play some important biological roles in vivo, as most of the 25 identified human selenoproteins have shown enzymatic redox function with catalytic or antioxidant activities conferred by Sec [Kryukov et al., 2003; Papp et al., 2007] .",

For some RNA viruses, including coxsackievirus B3 (CVB3/0) (cause of Keshan disease), human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), influenza A virus, SARS coronavirus, and Ebola virus, the absence of Se causes accumulation of mutations in their genome, leads to changes in the virulence-associated genetic structures [Beck et al., 2003; Harthill, 2011] . Viral glutathione peroxidase (vGPx), a selenoprotein with antioxidant activity, has been found to be encoded by some RNA virus such as HIV and hepatitis C virus [Zhang et al., 1999] . In virus-infected cells, vGPx inhibits ROS-induced apoptosis, a host response against infection, and further promotes viral replication [Papp et al., 2007] .",

A similar time-dependent suppression enhancement was also observed in HBV plasmidtransfected HuH-7 cells, with the maximum decrease in viral antigen levels also occurring on Day 4. Compared with the mock-treated control, 2.5 mM Na 2 SeO 3 treatment in HuH-7 cells transfected with 1.1 or 1.3\u00c2 HBV plasmid produced a drop in HBsAg level to 41.16 AE 10.55% and 42.14 AE 10.15% ( Fig.  3C and E) , respectively, and a drop in HBeAg level to 29.73 AE 8.33% and 32.32 AE 9.03%, respectively ( Fig.  3D and F). There was no obvious decrease in 1.3\u00c2 HBV plasmid-transfected HuH-7 cells on Day 1, but at this time point, HBeAg was already significantly suppressed in 1.1\u00c2 HBV plasmid-transfected HuH-7 cells (Fig. 3D) .",

Moreover, the viral transcription level in HepG2.2.15 was quantified using qPCR, and the host gene b-actin was chosen as the internal reference. The result of qPCR (Fig. S1 ) was consistent with northern blot assay (Fig. 4A ). Viral mRNA was inhibited by Na 2 SeO 3 treatment in dose-dependent and time-dependent manners, which was reduced to 49.28 AE 3.82% in the presence of 2.5 mM Na 2 SeO 3 for four days. In HuH-7 cells transfected with 1.1\u00c2HBV plasmids, there was a dose-dependent suppression of viral mRNA by Na 2 SeO 3 (Fig. 4B ). In addition, perceptible repression of HBV transcription was observed from Day 2 of 2.5 mM Na 2 SeO 3 treatment, which also occurred in a time-dependent manner (Fig. 4B) . Na 2 SeO 3 -induced suppression of HBV transcripts also occurred in HuH-7 cells transfected with 1.3\u00c2HBV plasmids. As shown in Figure 4C , suppression was evident with as little as 0.5 mM Na 2 SeO 3 , and progressed in a dose-dependent manner. Na 2-SeO 3 treatment at 2.5 mM caused a dramatic suppression of HBV RNAs from Day 1; however, the timedependent suppression effect was not as clear as in the other two models. This was probably because the RNA amount had already dropped to a very low level, and therefore the effects at the subsequent examined time points were less obvious (Fig. 4C) . In all models, 30 nM ETV treatment produced no effect on HBV transcription levels, because it specifically inhibits protein-priming activity [Jones et al., 2013] .",

            "text": "Hepatitis B virus, a prototype member of Hepadnaviridae family, replicates by a unique protein-primed reverse transcription mechanism [Nassal, 2008] . Infectious virions contain the genome as a 3.2 kb relaxed circular DNA (RC DNA), which is transformed into a plasmid-like cccDNA in the host cell nucleus [Beck and Nassal, 2007] . The two subsets of viral RNAs, namely, the subgenomic RNAs (preS/S mRNAs and HBx mRNA), and the greater-thangenome-length pregenomic RNA (pgRNA) and precore mRNA, are transcribed by cellular RNA polymerase II using cccDNA as the template [Beck and Nassal, 2007] . Although Se has been reported to influence multiple virus infections [Rayman, 2000; Beck et al., 2003; Beck, 2007; Harthill, 2011] , only limited information is available about whether it has any effect on HBV infection. One study has shown significantly lower concentrations of Se in serum from patients with HBV infection compared with healthy individuals [Khan et al., 2012] . Moreover, according to an eight-year follow-up investigation of 130,471 individuals in Qidong, China, Se supplementation via table salt significantly reduced the incidence of primary liver cancer [Yu et al., 1997] . However, none of the available studies showed solid evidence of the relationship between Se and HBV replication. The present study is the first to demonstrate direct inhibitory effects of Na 2 SeO 3 on HBV at the cellular level, using different HBV cell models.",

HBsAg is a hallmark of infection, although HBeAg is usually associated with high levels of viral replication. Although nucleoside/nucleotide analogues can inhibit HBV replication and result in obvious reductions in HBV DNA and HBeAg levels in serum, they have little impact on HBsAg secretion [Scaglione and Lok, 2012] . The present study revealed evident declines in HBsAg/ HBeAg levels with Na 2 SeO 3 treatment in all three tested models (Figs. 2 and 3) . However, it must be noted that the HCMV-promoter driven 1.1\u00c2HBV construct should not allow for the synthesis of HBeAg because of the lack of intact precore region at the 5' end [Nassal, 1992] . And HBeAg detected in HuH-7 transfected with 1.1\u00c2HBV plasmid might be core proteins due to antibody cross reactivity. So, intracellular core protein level was also determined in these models, and the result showed Na 2 SeO 3 treatment obviously reduced core expression in host cell, but not the internal reference protein (Fig. S2) . These results prompted us to further investigate the reason of the viral antigen decreases at the HBV transcription level.",

However, there were dissimilarities in selenite-induced suppression in the three models, possibly due to the differences in their cell lines and HBV-expressing systems. The progressive reduction in HBV DNA displayed a similar trend to the decrease in HBV mRNAs, which indicated that one potential mechanism of Na 2 SeO 3 in suppressing HBV replication is by inhibition of viral transcription. In addition to suppressing viral transcription, Se may also inhibit HBV replication by cytosolic calcium release, which is related to HBx in host cells [Bouchard et al., 2001; Geng et al., 2012] . The hypothesis that selenite inhibits HBV transcription and replication via host and viral factors still needs to be verified, and the potential involved factor (s) need to be identified by further experiments.",

On Day 6, Na 2 SeO 3 , in spite of a higher treating concertation, exhibited similar efficacy to the other drugs. The less potent of Na 2 SeO 3 on inhibiting HBV replication compared to the other tested drugs is probably due to its indirect effect on viral polymerase. However, as Na 2 SeO 3 and the nucleos(t) ide drugs affected different factors in the replication cycle of HBV, their combination showed more efficacy than either treatment alone did (Fig. 6) .",
