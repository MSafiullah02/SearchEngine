            "text": "Acute exacerbation of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease is an important cause of morbidity and mortality. This disease is associated with worsening quality of life and decline in lung function [Seemungal et al., 1998; Donaldson et al., 2002]. Acute exacerbation of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease is triggered by bacterial or viral infection of the airways but the pathophysiological importance of these infectious agents is not fully understood [Melbye et al., 1992; Falsey et al., 1995; Dowell et al., 1996; Soler et al., 1998]. Classical bacteria are usually isolated in 40\u201360% of sputum sampled at the time of acute exacerbation of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease but 20\u201340% of patients with stable chronic obstructive pulmonary disease have also positive sputum cultures suggesting that bacteria may sometimes be innocent bystanders [Sethi et al., 2007]. The role of viruses has been largely investigated with recent reports describing viral infection in 29\u201344% of acute exacerbation of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease events. Using PCR techniques, the most common detected viruses in upper respiratory airway samples of acute exacerbation of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease patients were rhinoviruses, respiratory syncytial viruses, influenza A and B viruses, parainfluenza viruses, coronaviruses, and adenoviruses [Mohan et al., 2010]. Viral infections can also be detected in stable chronic obstructive pulmonary disease patients suggesting that some respiratory viruses may cause persistent low\u2010grade infection contributing to the pathogenesis of the disease [Seemungal et al., 2001; Papi et al., 2006; Mohan et al., 2010]. Only few recent studied investigated the presence of mixed viral and classical and intracellular bacterial infections in sputum samples taken at the time of acute exacerbation event [Soler et al., 1998; Bandi et al., 2003; Papi et al., 2006; Wilkinson et al., 2006a; De Serres et al., 2009]. In the present time, the burden of multiple viral and bacterial respiratory infections as contributors of acute exacerbation of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease remains to be investigated.",

Symptoms were noted as 1 (as usual), 2 (worse than usual), or 3 (much worse than usual). Acute exacerbation was defined as a minor worsening (+1) of at least two symptoms or a major worsening (+2) of at least one symptom for at least 2 days [Seemungal et al., 2001; Sethi et al., 2002]. Patients remained on their regular treatment for the duration of the study. Patients were consulting monthly to record changes in symptoms; medication and lung function and they were asked to contact the study team at each acute exacerbation of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. For each patient a physical exam was performed to assess acute exacerbation of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease severity. Arterial blood gases, chest X\u2010ray, and pulmonary functional tests were performed. Induced sputum was obtained prior to initiation of AECOPD treatment. One week after acute exacerbation of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease event, recovery was clinically assessed and monthly follow\u2010up was resumed. Pulmonary functional tests were performed using a Body box 5500 plethysmograph (Medisoft, Sorinnes, Belgium). Sputum samples collected at the time of acute exacerbation were induced with hypertonic saline at 3%, 4% then 5% concentration delivered by ultrasonic nebuliser as previously described [Papi et al., 2006].",

The detection rates of classical bacterial pathogens and of respiratory viruses by RT\u2010PCR techniques were in agreement with those previously published in recent reports [Melbye et al., 1992; Falsey et al., 1995; Dowell et al., 1996; Soler et al., 1998; De Serres et al., 2009]. However the distribution of type of respiratory viruses appeared to be different from previously published studies with identification of HRV and HMPV as the primary contributors to acute exacerbation while RSV and influenza were infrequently detected during this 1\u2010year pilot study. Potential pathogen microorganisms were detected in 42% of acute exacerbation events demonstrating as previously described the predominance of M. catarrhalis, Haemophilus influenza, and Streptococcus pneumoniae that represented 77% of classical bacteria. No intracellular bacteria were detected at time of acute exacerbation events in patient with chronic obstructive disease (Table II).",

These discrepant results could be explained by the sensitivity of the used techniques and by the design of the study or the temporal epidemiological characteristics. HRV was previously identified as a one of the major contributor of acute exacerbation of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and interestingly our genotyping analyses showed that the geno\u2010group C could trigger acute exacerbation events. Because HRV group C strains are not easily detectable by classical culture techniques; these results indicate the need to use PCR techniques to explore the relationship between virus infections and acute exacerbation of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. In the present study, viral respiratory pathogens were detected by use of a multiplex PCR\u2010DNA and microarray detection assay allowing a rapid and accurate detection of conventional and newly discovered viral respiratory pathogens. Respiratory viruses were detected in 44% of acute exacerbations of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease by multiplex PCR\u2010DNA microarray system, a rate 6.7 higher than those obtained by classical viral detection techniques. However, this qualitative molecular approach was not able to distinguish an ongoing infection from a chronic or persistent viral shedding [Seemungal et al., 2001; Kuypers et al., 2006; De Serres et al., 2009]. Further prospective clinical studies testing the viral load levels at time of acute exacerbation versus stable state are now necessary to differentiate ongoing infection from past or beginning viral infections in acute exacerbation of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease cases.",

In the present study, multiple infections were not related to demographic characteristics, smoking history, lung function or inhaled treatment, in accordance with previous studies [Seemungal et al., 2001; Wilkinson et al., 2006b]. Finally, clinical outcomes of acute exacerbation of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease that were depending on multiple infections were analyzed. Mixed infections (virus\u2013virus or virus\u2013bacteria) were not found to be associated with the severity of acute exacerbation of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease or with an increased risk of recurrence at 3 and 6 months (P > 0.4). A recent study using PCR detection methods for nasal aspirate samples described that acute exacerbation of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease cases of mixed virus\u2013bacterial infections do not appear to be more severe among virus\u2010infected patients [De Serres et al., 2009]. The present study provides additional data on the impact of mixed virus or bacterial infections onto the clinical severity and the risk of recurrence of acute exacerbation that are critical elements in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease management. However, it must be pointed out that the present monocentric study was conducted in a relatively low number of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease patients and acute exacerbation of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease events. Further multicentric studies involving larger population are needed to come to definitive conclusions regarding the clinical impact of multiple infections in acute exacerbation of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.",

This susceptibility could be related to polymorphism of genes encoding CCL1, a chemotactic factor for leukocytes [Takabatake et al., 2006], mannose binding lectin (MBL2) [Yang et al., 2003] or surfactant protein B [Foreman et al., 2008], altering host defense factors against pathogens. Recently, an experimental human model of HRV infection clearly showed the role of HRV as triggering factor in acute exacerbation of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease [Mallia et al., 2011]. A deficient induction of type III interferon\u2010\u03bb by HRV in asthmatic primary bronchial cells and alveolar macrophages was correlated with the severity of HRV related asthma exacerbation [Contoli et al., 2006]. The hypothesis of a lower immunological response against viral infections in acute exacerbation of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease remains to be investigated in further clinical prospective studies.",
