Objective of review: Due to the difficulty of accurate diagnosis and varying practices across the UK, there exist a number of controversial areas and non-standardised practice. These will be highlighted and tackled within this article. Type of review and search strategy: A literature review, last performed in September 2013, searched PubMed citing variations on the areas of controversies with 'tonsillitis', 'pharyngitis' and 'pharyngotonsillitis'from 1956 to present with language restrictions. Excluded articles included those regarding sore throat after tonsillectomy and peritonsillar abscess. Evaluation method: Titles and abstracts were initially screened, and full text of potentially relevant articles obtained. The bibliographies of articles were searched for relevant references. The references were then compiled and reviewed independently by two authors (JB & TB), overseen by the senior author (EK). Results: (i) Diagnosis and investigation: Use of the Centor criteria is inadequate within the secondary care setting. Blood testing is unnecessary in the majority of cases where patients do not require admission, as they are unlikely to change management. (ii) Antibiotics: Antibiotics are likely to be indicated in all those presenting to secondary ENT care, with penicillin being the antibiotic of choice for first-line therapy. (iii) Corticosteroids: Moderate evidence supports the benefit of steroid administration in this patient cohort, advocating a single dose initially followed by reassessment. (iv) Analgesia: Paracetamol and NSAIDs have good evidence of action. Codeine should be used with caution in the paediatric population. (v) Reduced admission rates and early discharge: There is evidence suggesting that a trial of medical therapy prior to admission is beneficial in reducing rates of admission and length of stay. Conclusions: Management of acute tonsillitis within a secondary care setting largely consists of anecdotal or relatively low-quality evidence. Thus, much evidence from management comes from expert opinion or practice within a primary care setting. Management across the UK can also vary greatly. An evidence-based review of best practice has been presented here, but further evidence will be required in the future examining the significance of corticosteroids and antibiotic administration in this patient cohort specifically, ensuring practice is evidence based and clinically relevant.",

In addition, approximately 1-10% of cases are caused by the Epstein-Barr virus (EBV; causing infectious mononucleosis or glandular fever). 2 The more serious clinical cases tend to be bacterial and commonly develop following an initial viral infection. 2 The most common bacterial organism is group A beta-haemolytic streptococcus (GABHS), thought to be associated with 5-36% of tonsillar infections, 3 with other organisms involved including: Chlamydia pneumonia, Mycoplasma pneumonia, Haemophilus influenza, Candida, Neisseria meningitides and Neisseria gonorrhoeae. 2,3 Management of a viral illness is conservative in the majority of cases; bacterial causes are treated more aggressively and in severe cases with hospital admission.

The significance of raised inflammatory markers in those with tonsillitis is debatable, but there is some evidence that their increase is linked to a higher likelihood of streptococcal infection requiring antibiotics. 7 An area of particular controversy regarding blood testing surrounds investigation of infectious mononucleosis (IM). Those with IM are increasingly likely to require hospitalisation, have worsening symptoms and suffer from respiratory distress and/or splenic/hepatic complications (including haemorrhage). Monospot testing is routinely undertaken in hospital practice, but results can be misleading, with current commercially available. Monospot tests quoted to be 70-92% sensitive and 96-100% specific. 8 The gold standard investigation is Epstein-Barr virus serology, but this test is significantly more expensive and is probably unnecessary in the majority of cases. 8 IM is a clinical diagnosis with laboratory investigations used to confirm the diagnosis. 2 Evidence within the literature 9 suggests that the lymphocyte count alone or when used in combination with the total white cell count could be used as a quick screening test prior to monospot or serological testing (level 3/4 evidence). However, it is reported that in the paediatric population or those with strong clinical signs of IM, these methods may be more unreliable.",

The highest levels of evidence within this category comes from a Cochrane review (level 1 evidence) conducted in 2013 examining the role of antibiotics in the presence of GABHS. 14 The review included seventeen trials in its analysis (5352 total participants); 16 compared penicillin with other antibiotic agents (six with cephalosporins, six with macrolides, three with carbacephem and one with sulphonamides), with the final one comparing clindamycin with ampicillin. Study conclusions revealed no strong evidence to show any meaningful differences across types of antibiotic studied. As penicillin is cheap, reliable (no significant resistance to GABHS seen yet), safe for use in those with IM and is well tolerated, it is an appropriate first-line treatment in those with suspected bacterial infection.",

We could find no evidence within the literature comparing the efficacy of intravenous antibiotics therapy compared with oral therapy in the management of tonsillitis within the secondary care setting. Anecdotally, it is presumed that intravenous therapy is preferable to oral administration. Many patients presenting to hospital will be unable to take oral therapy initially, making intravenous therapy more appropriate (level 5 evidence). The study 15 used to validate the treatment algorithm presented in this article (Fig. 1) revealed that a trial of intravenous antibiotic therapy (used in combination with fluid rehydration and steroid therapy) was associated with a significantly reduced rate of hospital admission and length of stay. Although teasing out the exact effect of using the combination of an intravenous antibiotic with steroid will be difficult, what is clear is in the population of patients presenting with inability to swallow with systemic features, the use of an intravenous antibiotic initially and then converting to oral Controversies in the management 371 therapy later is likely to be sound clinical practice (level 5 evidence).",

A Cochrane systematic review and meta-analysis 16 (level 1 evidence) reviewing eight trials in the ambulatory setting (369 children, 374 adults) examined patients given a short course of corticosteroid or placebo (in addition, all patients also received an antibiotic). Results revealed an increased likelihood of complete resolution of pain at 24 and 48 h regardless of GABHS status, and a reduction in the meantime to onset of pain relief by more than 6 h. Interestingly, another Cochrane review only including patients diagnosed with IM revealed an improvement in symptoms at 12 h (versus placebo), but these benefits were not maintained following this time period. 17 The algorithm highlighted within this latter review suggests that in the absence of complications, a single dose of corticosteroid should be considered. This is likely to work effectively as a pain reliever but also, it is hoped, aid early oral intake which should expedite oral therapy and hospital discharge.",
