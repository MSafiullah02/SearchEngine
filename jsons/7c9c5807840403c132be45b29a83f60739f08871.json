Air samples indoor, upwind (10 and 50 m), and downwind (10, 50, 100, 200, and 400 m) of four chicken houses were collected using Andersen-6 stages sampler. The concentrations of S. aureus were determined for every sample site. Isolation of S. aureus from chicken feces was performed according to the standard method. The genetic relationship among the isolates was determined by profiles of PCR-amplified repetitive extragenic palindromic (REP-PCR) elements. The results showed that the concentrations of S. aureus indoor of four chicken houses were higher than those upwind and downwind sites (P < 0.05 or P < 0.01), but there were no significant concentration differences among downwind sites (P > 0.05). The fingerprints and the phylogenetic tree indicated that a part of the S. aureus (55.6%, 10/18) isolates from indoor air had the same REP-PCR fingerprints as feces isolates. Consequently, most isolates (57.1%, 20/35) from downwind 10, 50, 100, 200, even 400 m had the same REP-PCR fingerprints as those from indoor or feces. These data indicated that some isolates from downwind and indoor originated from the chicken feces. However, those isolates from upwind had low similarity (similarity index 0.6-0.87) to those from indoor or feces. Therefore, the isolates upwind were not from the chicken feces or indoor. These results suggest that microbes in chicken feces can be aerosolized and spread indoor and outdoor, especially to downwind of the chicken houses. It should have an important epidemiological and public health significance.",

Alternatively, whether microbes come from animal house may be determined by their sensitivity to antibiotics (Chai et al., 2003; Yao et al., 2007) . However, the efficacy of these methods is limited, usually unable to confirm the ultimate source. Only do the genes are identified in bacteria from animal feces, indoor and outdoor aerosol, shall evidence be sufficient. Therefore, we performed PCR-amplified repetitive extragenic palindromic (REP-PCR) analysis on Staphylococcus aureus, comparing the genetic relationship of different isolates in the current study, in addition to the determination of the concentration of S. aureus inside and different distance outside of four poultry houses. These studies are necessary to resolve the source of microbial aerosols and their spreading path, providing scientific bases for animal disease control and warning.",

            "text": "Feces-2 (1994) . An REP element is a conserved genomic DNA sequence with a consensus sequence of 38 bp containing a 5-bp variable loop between the palindrome stem and six degenerated positions at both ends. The palindromic sequence and the ability to form a frame are the key for it to have high level of conservation. Using one or more pairs of primer, the REP element can be amplified. Upon clustering analysis of the REP-PCR product using computer program, similarity indices can be obtained. In turn, REP-PCR profile can represent the relatedness of bacterial strains. Theoretically, isolates of the same species, same type and identical genetic composition should have specific DNA fingerprints (Ichiyama et al., 1991) . Thus, REP-PCR can be applied to the identification of bacterial species, types or isolates. It has been shown that this method is reproducible and accurate. Vecchio et al. (1995) showed that their PCR products were highly reproducible and stable when trying to distinguish 170 stains of Mycoplasma pneumoniae using RW3A of RepMP3 as primer. Van der Zee et al. (1999) showed that REP-PCR results were similar to pulse field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) analysis. PFGE of large restriction fragment can distinguish many bacteria and yeast pathogens. The identification ability by PFGE can be as high as 87-100%. Echeverrigaray et al. (1999) analyzed 16 strains of commercial yeast strain and classified these strains into three groups. It is evident that REP-PCR is accurate and reliable. Many researchers have used it for bacterial pathogen studies and molecular epidemiology investigation (Francois et al., 2005; Ibenyassine et al., 2006; Jurkovic\u02c7et al., 2007) . Comparing the densities of airborne S. aureus indoor with outdoor (Table 2) , it is clear that there were much more airborne microbes indoor than outdoor at any distance (P < 0.05), which suggests that microbial aerosol forms continuously from birds and feces, accumulates and spread to the environment. In the present experiment, no S. aureus was isolated from downwind 400 m from farms C and D, which might have resulted from the death of microbes under the effect of UV light, temperature and relative humidity (Che, 1986) . It is also possible that long-time sampling might have stressed the microbes resulting in death (Marthi et al., 1990; Stewart et al., 1995) .",

Similarly, isolates downwind were identical to 57.1% (10/18, 55.6%; 4/8, 50%; 3/5, 60%; and 3/4, 75%, respectively for the four farms) those from indoor and feces. In contrast, upwind isolates were more distinct genetically from indoor and feces ones, with similarity indices being 60-87%. In farm A, Upwind10m-1 and Upwind10m-3 were 85.6% similar to Feces-2. Upwind50m-1 and Upwind50m-2 were 78.4% and 77.2% similar to Feces-6, respectively. In farm D, Upwind50m-1 was 74% similar to Feces-9. Upwind50m-2 was 60% similar to Feces-2. Upwind10m-1 and Upwind10m-2 were 87% and 72% similar to Feces-7, respectively. Upwind10m-3 was 82% similar to Feces-9. It can be seen from the figure that the greater the similarity index, the closer is the genetic relationship. Studies have confirmed that isolates with similarity indices greater than 90% are the same species or the same type, being the progeny of one cell. In contrast, isolates with similarity indices between 60 and 87% were genetically distant.",

This suggests that the ambient air outside of these chicken houses can be polluted by airborne pathogens, posing a threat to the health of neighboring human inhabitants and the chickens themselves. In their study on the transmission dynamics of antibiotics-resistant bacteria, Austin and Anderson (1999) pointed out that such transmission may prove difficult to eradicate, ultimately requiring careful surveillance and effective infection control measures. Thus, the use of S. aureus as an indicator to study the origin and spread of airborne pathogens from chicken houses is potentially useful for enhancing public health and understanding the airborne epidemiology of this pathogen.",
