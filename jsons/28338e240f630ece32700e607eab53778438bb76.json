The amount of sRANKL measured by the ELISA used in this study can reflect only the free, uncomplexed forms in human plasma; therefore, the assays may not accurately reflect the total concentrations of sRANKL and OPG proteins in the samples. Altered concentrations of the proteins could also result from fluctuations in the sRANKL:OPG ratio in human plasma, which may contribute to the previous discordant results for detection of sRANKL:OPG in human plasma. In some circumstances, determination of the expression of RANKL and OPG mRNA extracted from osteoblastic cells may provide a more accurate and precise estimate of changes in the RANKL:OPG ratio in metabolic bone disease than do measurements of plasma concentrations (11) (12) (13) (14) .",

To date, most of the assays have focused predominantly on samples taken from Clinical Chemistry 49, No. 12, 2003 nasopharyngeal aspirates, urine, and stools (5, 6 ) . Although detection of SARS-CoV RNA in the plasma of SARS patients has been reported (1 ), the relatively low sensitivity of the ultracentrifugation-based approach for detecting SARS-CoV RNA in plasma has made this assay impractical. Recently we showed that a one-step real-time quantitative reverse transcription-PCR (RT-PCR) assay for the polymerase region of the SARS-CoV genome could detect viral RNA in 75-78% of nonultracentrifuged serum samples from adult SARS patients during the early stage of disease and that the serum SARS-CoV concentrations on admission were of prognostic significance (7 ) . This finding demonstrates that plasma/ serum SARS-CoV quantification may potentially be useful for the early diagnosis of SARS.",

The convalescent sera of these patients were tested for IgG antibody against SARS-CoV with SARS-CoV-infected cells in an indirect immunofluorescence assay (6 ) . All patients were serologically positive for SARS-CoV IgG antibody. As negative controls, blood samples from 15 pediatric patients who suffered from fever and infections other than SARS were collected.

A RT-PCR system specifically targeting the polymerase gene [orf1ab polyprotein; nt 15327-15398; GenBank accession no. AY278554 (10 ) ] of the SARS-CoV genome was designed as described previously (7 ) . The RT-PCRs were set up in a reaction volume of 25 L. The primers and fluorescent probe were used at concentrations of 300 and 100 nM, respectively, and 12 L of extracted plasma RNA was used for amplification. The thermal profile used for the analysis was as follows: the reaction was initiated at 50\u00b0C for 2 min for the included uracil Nglycosylase to act, followed by reverse transcription at 60\u00b0C for 30 min. After a 5-min denaturation at 95\u00b0C, 40 cycles of PCR were carried out with denaturation at 94\u00b0C for 20 s and annealing/extension at 56\u00b0C for 1 min. The sensitivity, linearity, and precision of the assay have been established, as described previously (7 ). We were able to detect down to 5 copies of the synthetic oligonucleotide in the reaction mixture, which corresponds to 74 copies/mL. SARS-CoV concentrations are expressed as copies/mL of plasma/serum. Because no recovery experiments had been done, the reported concentrations (copies/mL) were minimum estimates. A semilogarithmic plot of different calibrator concentrations against the threshold cycles yielded a correlation coefficient (r) of 0.987. The CV of the copy number of these replicate analyses for this amplification system was 16% at 280 copies/mL (7 ).",
