In early January, when we had just learned that a newly discovered disease was spreading in faraway China, only a few thought it would soon be coming to Croatia. Nevertheless, by February, when the epidemic was rapidly spreading in northern Italy, it was already quite likely that it would not bypass Croatia, and on 25 February 2020 the first case of COVID-19 was registered in our country [2].",

Due to extensive property damage, several hospitals had to be evacuated, including the UHID, where there were 86 patients at the moment, including 22 COVID-19 patients, 15 of whom were in the ICU. This additional misfortune has jeopardized the safety of us all, especially the most vulnerable members of our society: children, the elderly and the sick.
