            "text": "Porcine transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV), a member of the family Coronaviridae, is the etiological agent of porcine transmissible gastroenteritis (TGE). Swine of all ages and species were susceptible to TGEV, and infected animals usually show symptoms of vomiting, diarrhea and severe dehydration. As the mortality of infected piglets under 3 weeks can be up to 100% (Garwes, 1988, Mullan et al., 1994) and survived elder pigs usually show growth retardation and low rate of reward to feeding, the annual economic loss due to outbreak of TGE was enormous around the world. Furthermore, TGE usually developed very fast in vivo. Neonatal piglets infected with TGEV may suffer from gastroenteritis within 20 h post-infection and death may happen in 1\u20134 days (Schwegmann-Wessels and Herrler, 2006). However, unlike the foot-and-mouth disease virus (FMDV), there are no quick and potent anti-TGEV therapeutic agents available yet (Brim et al., 1995, de los Santos et al., 2005, Saif, 2004). Previously, two shRNA-expressing plasmids pEGFP-U6/P1 and pEGFP-U6/P2, targeting the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRP) gene of TGEV, had been constructed and found to be with high efficiency of viral inhibition as demonstrated in vitro (Zhou et al., 2007). In the present study, we delivered the two plasmids into mini-pigs to further evaluate their antiviral potential in vivo.",

Twelve full-sib SPF mini-pigs at 25 days old (1.9\u20132.2 kg) raised in SPF animal house in our institute were divided randomly into 6 groups as shown in Table 1\n, in which the groups 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5 were served as non-infection, viral infection alone, plasmid toxicity control, pEGFP-U6/P1 interference and pEGFP-U6/P2 interference group, respectively.

All the shRNA-expressing plasmids were diluted with 0.1 M PBS (pH 7.4) and inoculated into mini-pigs via the precava (superior vena cava) after optimizing the dose of injection plasmids by respectively introducing 1, 2, 3 and 4 mg/10 ml/pig of pEGFP-U6/P1. 24 h after injection, all mini-pigs except those in groups 1 and 3, were infected with 10 ml TGEs-1-infected cell culture (104 CCID50) orally.

In contrast, no TGEV antigen was found in the organs of mini-pigs from the other groups (Fig. 2A\u2013E).

The IIF and RT-PCR analyses (Fig. 2, Fig. 3) indicated that TGEV can replicate in several organs in pigs, but they mainly distribute in swine small intestine, for the amino peptidase N (APN), a TGEV major receptor in pigs, is abundantly expressed in the apical membrane of the small intestine epithelial cells, and which has a bigger quantity and higher activity in small intestine than other organs. Through the APN most of infectious TGEV invade host small intestine epithelial cells and initiate viral replication (Delmas et al., 1992, Rossen et al., 1994, Weingartl and Derbyshire, 1994). In our study, after the plasmids injected into mini-pigs via the precava, the reporter gene EGFP expressed abundantly in small intestine cells (data not shown). It indicated that the plasmids were efficiently delivered into small intestine cells, the target of TGEV, by the method of precava injection. This may be a major reason why a small dose of shRNA-expressing plasmids (3 mg/piglet) could well protect mini-pigs from clinical symptoms and histopathology induced by TGEV infection (Delmas et al., 1992, Rossen et al., 1994, Weingartl and Derbyshire, 1995). The data also suggested that precava injection may be a good choice for treating animals with intestinal diseases as this route uses relatively short distance to reach small intestine from the precava.",

Based on our observations, the background fluorescence in the lung was more abundant than that in the other samples or pure cultured cells (data not shown). Moreover, plasmid expression in lung was poorer than that in intestine (see Section 2 in discussion). So, we concluded that the high background fluorescence in lung hampered the detection of fluorescence emitted by the plasmids. Fortunately, TGEV propagation was also less efficient in lung (the reason discussed in Section 2 above) than that in small intestine (Fig. 3B). Therefore, though the expression of shRNA in lung was not highly active, it was enough to inhibit the same poor propagation of TGEV in lung in the present study.",

(A) All the organs were sampled from the mini-pigs in group 5; (B) all the organs were sampled from the mini-pigs in group 2; M: 50 bp DNA ladder marker; A: mesenteric lymph node; B: lung; C: liver; D: jejunum; E: ileum; F: kidney; G: spleen. A\u03b2, B\u03b2, C\u03b2, D\u03b2, E\u03b2, F\u03b2, G\u03b2 are products of \u03b2-actin gene expressed in these organs; AN, BN, CN, DN, EN, FN, GN are products of the N gene of TGEV in these organs. The TGEV N gene fragments, amplified successfully in all samples in group 2, were undetectable in group 5.",
