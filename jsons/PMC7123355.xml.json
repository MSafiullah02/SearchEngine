Pediatric airway management can be challenging due to the following differences in anatomy compared to the adult airway: larger occiput, large tongue in proportion to the oral airway, more anterior location of the vocal cords and floppy epiglottis (Singh and Frenkel 2013). Prior to intubation, all the necessary personnel and equipment must be readily accessible.

Ideally, the patient should be pre-oxygenated for at least 3 min (Weingart and Levitan 2012). If the patient is adequately breathing, oxygenation can be accomplished through a 100% non-rebreather mask with the rate of oxygen flow as high as possible. Bag Mask Ventilation (BMV) should be initiated in the apneic patients and in those with poor respiratory drive to ensure adequate pre-oxygenation. To further increase the safe apnea time and the success rate of the first intubation attempt, apneic oxygenation is used during rapid sequence intubation (RSI) in adults (Singh and Frenkel 2013; Weingart and Levitan 2012; Mittiga et al. 2015). This entails the application of oxygen via nasal prongs in addition to pre-oxygenation, and acts as an adjunct to pre-oxygenation by providing an oxygen filled pharynx used as a reservoir for alveolar ventilation (Weingart and Levitan 2012). Although the adult evidence shows promise (Singh and Frenkel 2013; Mittiga et al. 2015), pediatric research on this issue is limited (Steiner 2016).",

            "text": "Although uncuffed tubes were previously recommended in pediatrics due to airway narrowing at the glottis and concerns about mucosal injury, evidence suggests that pediatric cuffed endotracheal tubes are safe to use in the pediatric population. The use of cuffed tubes is associated with fewer tube changes, decreased risk of aspiration and allows for higher airway pressures during ventilation without an increased risk of complications (Kleinman et al. 2010a; Weiss et al. 2009; Shi et al. 2016). It is important that cuffed tubes are inflated to no more than 20 cm of water. The size of tube can be estimated by length-based tools or by using the following age-based formulas: age/4 + 3.5 for cuffed tubes or age/4 + 4 for uncuffed tubes (Kleinman et al. 2010a). An endotracheal tube one size above and below the estimated size should also be available, and consideration should be given to using a stylet. Successful placement should be confirmed through direct visualization, CO2 detection, and chest x-ray or ultrasound confirmation in addition to auscultation (Mittiga et al. 2015; Kleinman et al. 2010a; Chou et al. 2015). Cricoid pressure is no longer routinely recommended during rapid sequence intubation as it has been shown to decrease the success of intubation with little effect on the risk of aspiration (Kleinman et al. 2010a; Ellis et al. 2007). If BMV is unsuccessful and intubation is not possible a Laryngeal-Mask Airway (LMA) may be used to provide a patent airway and ventilation support (de Caen et al. 2015a).",

Contrary to previous recommendation to use atropine to mitigate the risk of pediatric bradycardia, evidence to demonstrate this benefit has been lacking (Singh and Frenkel 2013; de Caen et al. 2015a). The most recent PALS guidelines do not support the routine use of atropine during pre-intubation in children (de Caen et al. 2015a). The use of atropine may be considered in children at increased risk of bradycardia (such as in infants under one year of age, when using succinylcholine in children under 5 years of age or in patients receiving multiple doses of succinylcholine) or in those who are bradycardic prior to intubation (Singh and Frenkel 2013).

Etomidate, at a dose of 0.3 mg/kg is an excellent sedative medication for this purpose due to its minimal associated cardiovascular side effects. Given the risk of possible adrenal suppression, etomidate is not currently recommended in the septic patient (Kleinman et al. 2010a; den Brinker et al. 2008; Chan et al. 2012; Bruder et al. 2015). Ketamine is a dissociative sedative agent used at doses of 1\u20133 mg/kg. Ketamine is particularly useful in hypotensive patients or those with severe asthma. Since ketamine does not inhibit spontaneous respirations, it is a useful sedative for difficult intubations. Contrary to previous belief, recent evidence suggests that ketamine is safe to use in children with increased intracranial pressure. (Filanovsky et al. 2010; Hughes 2011). Although commonly used for intubation, the use of propofol in the emergency department should be limited to experienced personnel due to a significant risk of hypotension (Shaw and Bachur 2016; Singh and Frenkel 2013). Other medications such as benzodiazepines and opiates can also be used for sedation in RSI but these may not be as reliable or effective (Singh and Frenkel 2013; Stollings et al. 2014).",

Full recoil should occur between compressions and all efforts should be made to minimize interruptions in CPR. Compressions to ventilation should occur at a ratio of 15:2 until a definitive airway or LMA is present (Atkins et al. 2015). Respirations can be provided by BMV using adjuncts such as naso-pharyngeal or oro-pharyngeal airways to improve oxygenation. If skilled personal are present, tracheal intubation may be attempted while minimizing interruptions to chest compressions. If BMV is unsuccessful and intubation is not possible, ventilation via LMA should be considered (de Caen et al. 2015a).

Early insertion of an intraosseous needle provides timely and effective access during resuscitation; intraosseous medications can be given at the IV-recommended doses.",

In the United States the prevalence of severe sepsis has been rising over the past decade (Ruth et al. 2014; Balamuth et al. 2014), with estimated pediatric hospitalizations due to severe sepsis exceeding 75,000 cases annually (Hartman et al. 2013). Young infants, especially low birth weight neonates, are at the highest risk, and children with co-morbid medical conditions account for more than half the cases. This includes children with chronic lung disease, congenital heart disease, malignancy, and those with conditions impacting the immune system (Hartman et al. 2013). Children with indwelling devices and anatomic abnormalities are also at high risk for bacterial seeding and infection. In North America, the mortality rate from pediatric severe sepsis and septic shock is estimated to be 5\u201315% but approaches 30% in those with comorbid disorders and significant organ dysfunction (Ruth et al. 2014; Hartman et al. 2013; Watson et al. 2003; Kutko et al. 2003; Weiss et al. 2015a).",

The differences between the pediatric and adult response to infection have important implications on the presentation and treatment of sepsis in children compared to older patients (Brierley et al. 2009). First, severe hypovolemia, likely due to a combination of dehydration and increased microvascular permeability, is a hallmark of pediatric septic shock. Therefore, children frequently respond well to aggressive fluid resuscitation. Second, the hemodynamic response to sepsis is significantly different in the two populations (Fig. 8.1). Up to 90% of adult patients present with a \u201chyperdynamic shock\n\u201d, otherwise known as \u201c warm shock\u201d. Despite myocardial dysfunction, cardiac output (CO) is typically maintained by an increase in heart rate and decrease in systemic vascular resistance (SVR). Thus, the adult response to sepsis is characterized by tachycardia, hypotension and a normal, or increased, cardiac output. The predominant cause of mortality in adult septic shock is vasomotor paralysis (when SVR cannot be further increased with vasopressor agents). In contrast, at least 50% of infants and children present with \u201c cold shock\u201d. Although an increase in heart rate is a child\u2019s principal means of maintaining CO, a predominant response to a decreased CO in children is vasoconstriction. Blood flow is redistributed from non-essential vascular beds such as the skin, to essential organs such as the heart, brain and lungs. This increase in SVR maintains a normal blood pressure, even with significant decreases in CO. Hypotension is therefore a late sign in pediatric septic shock, and often signifies impending cardiovascular collapse. Thus, the pediatric response to sepsis is often characterized by tachycardia, normal blood pressure and decreased cardiac output. In children, low CO is most often associated with mortality, in contrast to adults who often succumb to low SVR. It should be noted however, that the clinical presentation of septic shock in children can be highly variable and can include a combination of hemodynamic abnormalities.\n",

Clinical suspicion for septic shock should always supersede reliance on the presence of specific consensus criteria. The diagnosis of septic shock should be made in children with sepsis (SIRS with infection) and signs of inadequate tissue perfusion including any of the following: decreased or altered mental status, decreased urine output (<1 ml/kg/h), capillary refill >2 s (cold shock), cool or mottled extremities (cold shock), diminished pulses (cold shock), flash capillary refill\n(warm shock), bounding peripheral pulses (warm shock), and wide pulse pressure (warm shock) (Brierley et al. 2009). The presence of hypotension, although not necessary for diagnosis, is confirmatory in a child with suspected infection. Although no laboratory test is sensitive or specific enough to be used alone, some experts recommend using lactic acid (a by product of anaerobic metabolism and marker of tissue hypoperfusion) as a diagnostic adjunct. Elevated initial lactic acid levels (\u22654.0 mmol/L), and failure of lactate levels to normalize (<2 mmol/L) or progressively clear with resuscitative efforts may be poor prognostic indicators in pediatric sepsis (Scott et al. 2012, 2016).",

The \u2018first-hour\u2019 therapeutic actions outlined in the ACCM guidelines should be regarded as best practices for emergency department resuscitation (Fig. 8.2).

Repeated 20 mL/kg fluid boluses should be given until markers of tissue perfusion (discussed above) normalize, or signs of fluid overload (lung rales, gallop rhythm, hepatomegaly) develop. Many children require up to 60 mL/kg within the first hour. Recently, a large trial in sub-Saharan Africa demonstrated increased mortality from fluid boluses in children with compensated septic shock (Maitland et al. 2011). Although it is the only study of its kind to date, it highlights the potential for harm if fluid resuscitation is used indiscriminately in children in resource-poor settings with limited availability of mechanical ventilation and vasoactive support. The most recent PALS update maintains, that in resource rich settings, fluid resuscitation remains a key component of goal directed therapy but emphasizes the need for individualized clinical evaluation and frequent reassessments to determine the appropriate volume of fluid resuscitation in every patient (de Caen et al. 2015b, c).

Due to widespread availability and clinician familiarity, dopamine has traditionally been the first line vasoactive agent. However, recent evidence suggests that epinephrine is likely a safer and more effective first choice, especially for those with cold shock (Ventura et al. 2015). According to the most recent ACCM guidelines, peripheral epinephrine is the preferred first line agent for fluid-refractory shock. Thereafter, cold shock should be reversed by titrating epinephrine (or low dose central dopamine), and warm shock reversed by titrating central norepinephrine (or high dose central dopamine). Please see Fig 8.2. Patients with catecholamine-resistant shock often need a variety of vasodilators, afterload reducing agents and/or other vasopressors that should be titrated in an intensive care setting.",

A Cochrane review found there is no high quality evidence from randomized controlled trials to support or refute that specialist teams for neonatal transport reduce mortality or morbidity among newborns requiring retrieval to a newborn intensive care unit (NICU) (Chang et al. 2008). Nevertheless, specialized transport teams are recommended as being the best option for most critically ill infants and children who require inter-facility transport (Whyte and Jefferies 2015). Ramnarayan et al. (2010) found that use of a specialized retrieval team was associated with decreased mortality risk in children transported to a pediatric intensive care unit (PICU). Orr et al. also found that children transported by specialized teams had a lower death rate of 9%, versus 23% for those transported by nonspecialized teams (Orr et al. 2009). They also found that nonspecialized teams who transport children have more significant adverse events including airway issues, cardiopulmonary arrest, sustained hypotension, loss of a crucial intravenous access and equipment failure with deterioration of patient status (Orr et al. 2009). Although the majority of critically ill children benefit from transport by a specialized team once they are stabilized at the referring centre, exceptions to this rule include children with epidural hematomas or bowel ischemia requiring emergent surgery. The relative benefits of immediate transport versus stabilization prior to departure should be carefully weighed in these children.",

Pain assessment tools are widely available and ideally should be used in triage as the first step in pain management (Srouji et al. 2010; Drendel et al. 2011). Early use of pain assessment scores has been shown to increase provision of analgesia and decrease time to provision of analgesia (Boyd and Stuart 2005; Nelson et al. 2004). Measures of pain include physiologic measures (e.g. heart rate and blood pressure), observational and behavioral measures and self-report. Self-report is the gold standard as behavioral measures may also reflect anxiety and fear. Physiologic measures may reflect stress reactions and hence are often used as adjuncts to other pain assessment tools. The Children\u2019s Hospital of Eastern Ontario pain scale is a widely used behavioral scale for younger infants and non-verbal children. Children as young as 3\u20134 years can self-report pain using visual scales such as the Faces Pain Scale (FPS-R), Wong-Baker FACES scale or the OUCHER pain scale. Numerical and 10-cm visual analogue scales are generally reserved for children older than 8 years with cognitive abilities to understand these abstract concepts (Srouji et al. 2010; Drendel et al. 2011).",

Open communication and preparation of the child and family for procedures with explanation of the procedure using non-medical jargon helps to reduce anxiety and fear. Cognitive or psychological measures such as age appropriate distraction techniques (e.g. bubbles, stories, videos and music) are useful adjuncts to reducing anxiety associated with procedures. Other behavioral strategies such as breastfeeding or non-nutritive sucking, kangaroo care (skin-to-skin contact), swaddling/tucking and rocking/holding have also been shown to be beneficial in neonates and young infants (Ali et al. 2016).",

Rigid chest syndrome with inability to ventilate a patient has been reported with large boluses of rapidly administered fentanyl, hence careful titration is necessary (Sahyoun and Krauss 2012).

It has increasingly been adopted by emergency physicians skilled in advanced airway management and cardiopulmonary resuscitation. Safe sedation does require implementation of appropriate sedation guidelines and policies to minimize potential adverse effects (American College of Emergency Physicians 2014). Commonly used agents for minor procedures for anxiolysis with minimal sedative effects include midazolam (PO, IN) and inhaled nitrous oxide. Midazolam has no analgesic effects and hence requires additional analgesics for pain control. Intravenous midazolam is often combined with intravenous fentanyl and, with careful titration, produces more moderate sedation. Inhaled nitrous oxide is blended with oxygen and induces mild to moderate sedation and analgesia and has the advantage of onset and offset within 2\u20135 min. It is often used as an adjunctive agent for more painful procedures. Ketamine (IV, IM) is a dissociative agent characterized by potent analgesic and amnestic effects with relative lack of cardiopulmonary depression. It is a commonly used agent for procedural sedation in children and ideal for intensely painful procedures. Propofol is a deep anesthetic agent with rapid onset and pleasant recovery and is increasing being used in the emergency setting. It has a narrow therapeutic window and may result in significant respiratory depression and hypotension. It can be used alone for painless procedures requiring motion control such as CT scan and MRI, but additional analgesic agents are necessary for painful procedures (American College of Emergency Physicians 2014).",

Generally, use of LET on mucous membranes or end organs such as fingers is avoided, but small amounts applied with a cotton tip have been shown to be safe and effective (Bonadio 1996; White 2004). Pain associated with injection of lidocaine can also be reduced by slow injection, use of a fine needle and buffering with a solution of sodium bicarbonate (1 mL of 8.4% sodium bicarbonate to 9 mL of 1% or 2% lidocaine) (Fein et al. 2012).",

Risk factors for c-spine injury include: altered mental status, focal neurological deficit, neck pain, torticollis, substantial torso injury, predisposing condition (e.g. arthritis, Trisomy 21), diving, high risk MVC (Leonard et al. 2011). Although a detailed discussion about clearing the pediatric cervical spine is beyond the scope of this text, clinical decision rules such as the NEXUS criteria may be helpful to aid in clinical clearance in a cooperative child (Vinson 2001; Michaleff et al. 2012). Plain films in children are about 90% sensitive for C-spine injury, and therefore should be the first imaging modality in alert, non-intubated children who cannot be cleared clinically. (Nigrovic et al. 2012). If the cervical spine cannot be evaluated as normal, it is advisable to keep the patient in a soft collar (or bags besides his/her head if the child is too small for a traditional collar) until detailed imaging (usually MRI) can be performed.",

Based on previous studies, factors that warrant consideration for a CT scan to rule out a clinically important traumatic brain injury in children >2 years old include GCS <15, altered metal status and signs of a basal skull fracture. Vomiting more than once, loss of consciousness for more than five seconds, severe headache or severe mechanism of injury (fall >5 ft, MVC with rollover, ejection or fatality, pedestrian/bicycle without helmet versus vehicle or struck by high velocity object) should also raise suspicion of a possible intracranial bleed (Kuppermann et al. 2007).
