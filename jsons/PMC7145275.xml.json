In some locations, almost 10% of cases have presented with severe respiratory impairment necessitating of intensive care. Despite intensive life support, however, many of the sick have died of this new respiratory viral infection. Beyond fatalities, a greater percentage necessitated admission to hospitals for diagnosis and treatment.

            "text": "These four phases are as follows:\nMitigation: Some of the devastating effects of MCI may be reduced before the event. In fact, useful measures may be posed in action in the affected region before the event happening, in all those events that can be preventable or are realistically announced (i.e., economic and political attempt to mitigate MCI effect local, regional, and national hospital and infrastructure reorganization, activities and personnel redistribution, material supplying, patient and people advising).Planning: A realistic disaster plans involve exercise, practice, and continuous revision. In the impossibility to plan for all contingencies, plans must be relatively general and expandable but must be present. Mutual aid agreements or contracts among existing area associations, institutions, and nations (in a wider context of international entities, i.e., unions or federations) must be established before an actual event, in order to plan and optimize available resources as well as planning for funding and reimbursement. Most medical entities have not anticipated this pandemic, and therefore, planning must begin immediately and the response escalated according to the changing levels of demand/compromise.Response: This phase is generally considered the most important one, but effective and coordinated response greatly depends on the other three phases. The main aspects of the response phase may be summarized as follows:\u2013\u2013 Activation, notification, and initial response: Organizations and personnel involved in response and the potentially affected populations should be notified through effective and trust worth communication channels without generating panic and mass unreasonable and risky behaviors.As well, the different structures must be advised in time and in an appropriate manner to allow them to allocate the necessary resources and to free the necessary beds and rooms to host the sick patients. All these things must be prepared as much as possible before the first wave of sick patients\u2019 arrival.\u2013\u2013 Organization of command and scene assessment: Establishing a command structure is one of the most crucial steps. This must be prearranged and assembled almost immediately, as well as communication nets established. The Incident Command System (ICS) is the only that is in charge to direct and organize the different actions in the affected regions. All different regions or local directors are not allowed to manage the event differently from what defined by the ICS.\u2013\u2013 Search and rescue\u2013\u2013 Extrication, triage, stabilization, and transport: Triage involves providing the most efficient aid to as many as possible and prioritizes victims\u2019 treatment, transport, and/or transfer. Many variables influence the manner in which patients are triaged, transported, and treated: kind of incident, victim number, resources available, infrastructure capability, and the disaster context. Errors in triaging lead to worse outcomes. Health care providers must be familiar with MCI triage concept and trained in performing it. Transport must equitably distribute victims to capable receiving facilities.On the other side, the different structures must be familiar with the necessity of resource allocation during MCI which are deeply different from the normal activity. Operating principles for those charged with performing triage must be established a priori, agreed upon by the health authorities and society, and especially transparent to the general public. In a true MCI, the greatest good must be provided to the greatest number of patients. When there is a 10 to 1 ratio of those in need of life-supporting technologies versus available infrastructure, the sickest may unfortunately be denied care and moved into an expectant category.\u2013\u2013 Definitive scene managementUnique aspect of the pandemic\u2014Surgeons and some ultra-specialistic branches of health system provide a unique service that cannot be performed by other medical disciplines. Therefore, all of them must be secured in a protected environment, minimizing risks of acquiring the disease because critically ill and injured patients will continue to need emergent care.4.Recovery: This last phase is crucial for the affected community. Management of the involved personnel is very important during this phase for critical stress debriefing. Debriefing may teach valuable lessons. It is crucial to obtain as much information as possible from all actively involved participants. If complete and objective criticality analysis is not performed, improvements in future responses are impossible [3].",

            "text": "However, an analysis of the actual characteristics features of the early responses may provoke many criticisms:\nLack of effective presence of national and international agencies for disaster management and of international communication, collaboration, and support. In reality, international organizations in charge in disease prevention and control have published quickly protocols and guidelines (sometimes conflicting with each other as in the case of protective masks for health workers), but they have been implemented very slowly at national level. The lack of coordination of the activities between and within the international and national levels was evident in the first phase.Lack of mitigation phase during which many strategies may have been posed into action to reduce the real impact of the infection on the different systems. Taking into account the evolution of Chinese cases and the progressive spread within the world, there would have been time to organize a mitigation phase.Lack of an effective action planning at international and national level. The action plans have progressively followed. Probably, a well-structured action plan aimed at containing a potential disaster would have created fewer difficulties in managing COVID-19.Lack of national central directed strategies to prevent infection transmission and to timely isolate the more severely affected regions. The epidemic initially spread to those countries that are probably less virtuous in infection prevention and control. In these countries, the problem was handled by policymakers and technicians who did not perceive the real potential of this emergency.Lack of trust worth and objective information to the potential affected people given from the very beginning. The information was immediately conflicting, and social networks giving voice to everyone, which complicated the information transmission chain.Lack of a pre-defined disaster management plan including the need to prevent infected people from entering the emergency departments and to place the triage systems outside the emergency departments from the beginning of the infection outbreak. An infective emergency scenario, such as the present one, can repeat itself. In the coming months, the WSES will try to organize courses which will teach the concept of MCI to infectious disease emergencies, involving all interested professions. In fact, WSES has among its members medical and health professionals from different countries of the whole world who are monitoring and helping to develop actions to prevent and control this pandemic event. As most of them attend emergency areas in hospitals, they are professionals who are also at risk of contracting the disease, and at that moment, no matter the specialty or qualification of each one, they must all be united and focused on fighting this disease.The need to monitor the data on number of patients with related diagnoses before the first case of a patient with this type of disease is identified. If there are anomalies, then specific actions should be taken to identify the cause of this variation. It is essential to avoid any delays in identifying patient 0 or the first patients with this disease.Thousands of health care workers have been infected amid the ongoing coronavirus outbreak, a sign of the immensely difficult working conditions for doctors, nurses, and health care workers in general. They should be instead among those best protected. The infections, along with the deaths of several doctors in China, underscore the deeply challenging, chaotic environment that health care workers face with when toiling on the front lines of an epidemic outbreak. They face long hours, changing protocols, potential medical supply shortages, and risks to their own personal health and that of their loved ones. In every mass casualty event, the health care workers who go to the forefront are the main actors. The lack of national and international action plans forced health workers to work in a situation of extreme unsafety.",
