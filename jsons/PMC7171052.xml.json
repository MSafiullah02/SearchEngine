Studies have indicated that it is a novel coronavirus pneumonia, which was named coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). As of February 24, 2020, the total number of patients has risen sharply to 77,262 in China, with 2595 (3.2%) who have died. The main diagnosis method is the pathogenic results obtained by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR), which proved to be highly homologous with known genetic sequencing. However, the positivity rate is 30\u201350%, due to the influence of individual factors, the onset time, and specimen collection. It is very important to discover the specific information characterizing critically ill patients (Chung et al. 2020; Xie et al. 2020). Therefore, we conducted a retrospective analysis of critically ill patients with COVID-19.",

            "text": "At present, there are no specific drugs for COVID-19, only general supportive therapy and treatment in isolation. For mildly ill patients, the infection usually clears spontaneously. Nevertheless, severe illnesses develop easily, such as acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), multiple system organ failure, or even death. In this study, more men than women and more older than younger individuals made up the group of critically ill patients, and the median (range) age of the 19 patients was 73 (38\u201391) years. Eight (42.1%) patients died and the median duration from ICU admission to death was 2 (IQR: 1\u201310.75) days. These results suggest that sex and age are affecting the risk factors. Patients with a history of underlying disease (high blood pressure or diabetes) are at increased risk of becoming critically ill or dying if they have the COVID-19 infection. These findings are consistent with previous reports (Chen et al. 2020; Huang et al. 2020). The susceptibility of a population to infection by this new virus drives the dynamics of a pandemic. The clinical manifestations include fever, fatigue, and dry cough without phlegm. A few patients have nasal congestion, runny nose, sore throat, and diarrhea (Cui et al.2019; Zhu et al. 2020). Critically ill patients were more vulnerable to dyspnea, hypoxemia, and even ARDS, irreformable metabolic acidosis, sepsis, and coagulation disturbance after just one week (Wang et al. 2020). Our study found that the severely ill patients went to the hospital early, at the first signs of symptoms of fever and cough, and the time from showing symptoms to ICU admission was 6.4 days. At the ICU, 18 cases (94.7%) developed ARDS rapidly.",

As a result, we suspect that the new coronavirus in patients with multiple organ function damage is most likely related to this group. In regards to imaging aspects, 19 cases (100%) showed ground-glass changes on chest CT, which is the best tool to use to evaluate the imaging signs for early diagnosis.",

Patients with a history of underlying disease (high blood pressure or diabetes) are at increased risk of becoming critically ill or dying if they have the COVID-19 infection. Chest CT, lymphocyte count, hs-CRP, and SAA can be used in disease diagnosis. The D-dimer level plays an important role in critically ill patients and it is suggested that D-dimer can be used to monitor change in the condition of severely ill patients. There are certain limitations to this study, in that the number of patients was small and it should be classified as a retrospective study. We hope to have more samples in future to carry out a more comprehensive study and elucidate better means for the clinical treatment of COVID-19.",
