NHF therapy is classed by some countries as an aerosol generating procedure (AGP). A systematic review of AGP and risk of transmission of acute respiratory infections (ARI) to healthcare workers (HCW) reported that more invasive respiratory procedures such as tracheal intubation, tracheotomy and manual ventilation were a significant risk factors for SARS transmission (Tran et al. 2012 ). This was based on a single cohort study during the SARS outbreak in Canada in 2003, which was before NHF was in clinical use (Raboud et al. 2010) . In this study, lack of adherence to infection prevention and control practices was identified as a major contributor for HCW acquisition of SARS. The risk of transmission of ARI associated with AGP is very topical with the current COVID-19 pandemic. Clinicians must choose which respiratory therapies they apply, taking into consideration patient acuity, reduction of escalation, and minimizing virus transmission to healthcare workers.",

It is our hope that this data will inform evidence-based decisions about using NHF, particularly for patients with ARI.",

This was true at both flow rates in the imaging tests, and true when averaged over snort, cough and sneeze in the marker tests. NHF's apparent mitigation of particle generation during vigorous breathing may be explained by particles impacting on the cannula interface. Another possible explanation is that NHF imposes an expiratory flow resistance that increases expiratory time (Mundel et al. 2013 ) and reduces the peak expiratory flow (Spence et al. 2010) . Although NHF contributes to higher nasal velocities (Spence et al. 2012) , patient peak expiratory velocities are lower and particle generation reduced. There is high interpersonal variation in both datasets, with standard deviations typically twice the mean. Besides interpersonal differences in mucosa and air velocity, the air sampling does not capture the entire particle plume.",

However, these quiet breathing measurements were taken over a seven-minute period, and produced 200 to 1000 times lower volumes of oral/nasal fluid than the higher energy respiratory maneuvers of coughing, sneezing and snorting achieved in a 30 second period. Looking at this another way, coughing with no therapy produced 633 \uf06dL/m3 in half a minute i.e. (1,266 \uf06dL/m3/min). Quiet breathing with NHF at 60 LPM produced on average 1.72 \uf06dL/m3 in 7 minutes (0.246 \uf06dL/m3/min). It would take 86 hours of quiet breathing with NHF at 60 LPM times as long to release the same quantity of oral/nasal fluid as a minute of coughing with no therapy (1,266/1.72=5,146 mins or 86 hours).

NHF is a useful therapy for Type 1 Respiratory failure and reducing escalation to high infection risk procedures like intubation. Vigorous breathing without NHF is the worst-case scenario that should drive infection prevention and control measures. The use of NHF, per se, does not increase the risk of generation of infectious airborne aerosols above the risk of patient-generated aerosols.
