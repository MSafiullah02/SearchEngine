Initially, but also at time of writing, governmental approaches on how to respond to the outbreak have varied considerably. Denmark went into an effective lockdown on March 11, followed by Norway the next day (Fig. 1). Schools, universities and sporting facilities were closed, as were nurseries (with exceptions made for parents working in critical sectors of society, including doctors and nurses). The strategy of Sweden has been based on the appeal for a strong personal sense of responsibility to mitigate the viral spread, and the nurseries, kindergardens and schools are kept open. In all three Scandinavian countries, people are encouraged to work from home, and people at high risk of severe COVID-19 due to age or comorbidities are recommended to self-quarantine.",
