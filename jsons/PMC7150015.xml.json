Innate lymphocytes represent a heterogeneous group of cells that include cells lacking receptors for antigen, such as the group of innate lymphoid cells, of which natural killer (NK) cells are the prototypical example. Innate lymphocytes expressing antigen receptors include B1 B cells, natural killer T (NKT) cells, and \u03b3\u03b4 T cells. While innate lymphocytes are relatively rare in circulation and in lymphoid tissues, they are found in mucosal surfaces that represent portals of entry into the body [1].

There are many outstanding reviews of the biology and function of \u03b3\u03b4 T cells. A select few relevant to the topic of this chapter are listed in Table 46.1\n. Briefly, \u03b3\u03b4 T cells express unique T cell receptors (TCRs) that recognize self and foreign antigens in the absence of the requirement for presentation by major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I or class II molecules. This feature leads to a broad range of innate responses against pathogens, as well as recognition of stressed or tumor cells. Subsets of \u03b3\u03b4 T cells are defined by restricted TCR gene usage in addition to expression of various surface molecules and preprogrammed functional responses imprinted prior to their egress from the thymus. \u03b3\u03b4 T cells also express myriad innate receptors, such as toll-like receptors (TLRs), scavenger receptors, and lectin receptors, such as dectin-1, that can directly sense infectious agents. These receptors, along with cytokine receptors, fine-tune sensing and response of \u03b3\u03b4 T cells adapting to the tissue microenvironment. TCR stimulation leads to a variety of functional responses, such as cytolysis, cytokine production, regulatory effects, and even phagocytosis and antigen presentation, that depend on the activation of receptors and coreceptors. \u03b3\u03b4 T cells respond rapidly to external signals, leading to early cytokine responses in a variety of disease settings. Furthermore, they are uniquely positioned at virtually all portals of entry into the body where this type of innate immune response is critical. Indeed, \u03b3\u03b4 T cells, like other innate lymphocytes, are found at all mucosal surfaces and make up a large fraction of the intraepithelial lymphocyte population. They are also recruited to sites of inflammation, tumor growth, or other tissue insults.",

            "text": "In addition to the \u03b3\u03b4 TCR, \u03b3\u03b4 T cells express a variety of non-TCR receptors that affect their function. \u03b3\u03b4 T cells express the NK C-type lectin-like receptors, such as NKG2D, which recognize cellular stress proteins resulting in cellular activation [31], [32]. They also express tumor necrosis factor (TNF) receptor family molecules CD27, CD30, and CD137 [9]. CD27 is a costimulatory receptor to the TCR [33], and CD137 is also expressed on TCR-stimulated tumor-reactive \u03b3\u03b4 T cells [34]. CD28 (of the Ig superfamily) is also a \u03b3\u03b4 TCR coreceptor. The aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR), generally known for its role in homeostasis for mucosal T cells, is also expressed by mouse \u03b3\u03b4 T cells that produce innate interleukin 17 (IL-17) [35], as well as the mouse skin \u03b3\u03b4 T cell subset [36]. \u03b3\u03b4 T cells also express various cytokine receptors that contribute to their activation (IL-2R, IL-15R, IL-23R, etc.) and-fine tune their functional responses. The expression of pathogen-associated molecular pattern receptors has been detected on \u03b3\u03b4 T cells. These include another lectin receptor, dectin-1, a receptor for fungal, plant, and bacterial-derived polysaccharides [37], [38]; the TLRs [20], [39]; CD36 [40]; scavenger receptors [41]; and NOD-like receptors [42]. Though not a focus of this chapter, \u03b3\u03b4 T cells also express a variety of receptors that downregulate their function. Examples include killer cell immunoglobulin-like receptor and leukocyte immunoglobulin-like receptor, B and T lymphocyte attenuator, and programmed cell death 1 receptor, which are regulatory receptors that suppress the function and/or proliferation of the cells [29].\n",

Phylogenetic evidence suggests that they are the progenitors of both \u03b1\u03b2 T cells and B cells [43]. They predate adaptive immunity, so it is not surprising that they retain many innate functions similar to those of monocytes and macrophages. Zebrafish \u03b3\u03b4 T cells both are phagocytic and can present antigen, in addition to their expression of CD8 [44]. We characterized transcript expression in subsets of bovine \u03b3\u03b4 T cells [45], [46], [47]. The primary outcome of these studies was the recognition of multiple transcripts similar to those found in monocyte and macrophage cells, indicating their innate function. As part of these studies, we detected B-lymphocyte-induced maturation protein 1 (BLIMP-1) transcripts in bovine \u03b3\u03b4 T cells [46]. BLIMP-1, also known as PRDI-BF1, is a key regulator in the differentiation of hematopoietic cells into myeloid or B cells [48]; therefore, its detection in a T cell subset was notable at the time. We recognized this significance and further confirmed the expression of transcripts in resting bovine \u03b3\u03b4 T cells and not \u03b1\u03b2 T cells [46]. More recent findings have further confirmed the innate function of \u03b3\u03b4 T cells in the appropriate contexts.",

Effective antigen presentation is required for the initiation of adaptive immunity and is studied primarily in conventional antigen-presenting cells (APCs), such as dendritic cells (DCs), activated macrophages, and B cells. \u03b3\u03b4 T cells express an array of surface receptors, such as scavenger receptors, CD11b, and CD16, that facilitate uptake of particulate antigens [54], [55]. Subsets also express MHC class II and necessary coreceptors for effective antigen presentation to CD4+ T cells [56], [57], [58]. Antigen uptake and presentation to CD4+ T cells were first shown for bovine \u03b3\u03b4 T cells [57]. It was also shown that MHC class II expression and antigen presentation is enhanced in bovine WC1+ \u03b3\u03b4 T cells during viral infection [59]. Similar functions were described for porcine, human, and mouse \u03b3\u03b4 T cells [60], [61], [62]. \u03b3\u03b4 T cells in contact with bacteria can transition from cytokine-producing cells to phagocytic APCs, demonstrating their functional plasticity [63]. The phagocytic capacity of \u03b3\u03b4 T cells is augmented by opsonization [54], [63]. Combined, these studies show that subsets of \u03b3\u03b4 T cells in various species can be induced to present antigens via MHC class II. Clearly, \u03b3\u03b4 T cells have a unique role in innate immunity that is similar in some respects to that of monocytes and macrophages, and further is involved in the subsequent initiation of antigen-dependent acquired immunity.",

Ligation of TCR, in combination with other receptors such as NKG2D and cytokine receptors such as the IL-23 receptor, enhances and directs cytotoxic responses along with cytokine production [68], [69]. Cytotoxicity is a function of \u03b3\u03b4 T cells that is conserved across species [70], [71], [72], [73], [74], [75]. For example, granzyme B, perforin, and FasL are expressed in WC1+ \u03b3\u03b4 T cells from bovine peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs), with FasL expression increasing upon activation of these cells [76], [77]. Perforin expression is also found in bison \u03b3\u03b4 T cells [78]. Perforin and granzyme, FasL-Fas, and the TNF-related apoptosis-inducing ligand pathway are also features of human \u03b3\u03b4 T cells [79], [80]. The cytotoxic activity of \u03b3\u03b4 T cells likely plays an important role in multiple species for optimal immune responses by these cells to a subset of malignant and infected cells.",

These cytokines include those that drive inflammatory responses and contribute to downstream adaptive immune responses as well as cytokines that affect epithelial cell health and tissue homeostasis. Although the number of cytokines produced by \u03b3\u03b4 T cells is large, a few, such as IL-17, IFN\u03b3, and the tissue cytokines keratinocyte growth factor (KGF) and insulin-like growth factor (IGF), are of particular importance in the function of subsets of these cells. IL-17 and IFN\u03b3 are potent activators of cells of the myeloid lineage and contribute to downstream inflammatory responses. In mice, \u03b3\u03b4 T cells are a major source of innate IL-17 early in response to infection [81], [82]. Two populations of \u03b3\u03b4 T cells contribute to the IL-17 response. One is referred to as \u201cnatural\u201d IL-17-producing cells, which acquire effector function prior to egress from the thymus [83]. These cells are found in mucosal tissues and are thought to be early responders to infectious insult. Another population is referred to as \u201cinduced,\u201d and these cells rapidly acquire effector function after egress from the thymus and in response to antigen and cytokine in the periphery [84]. Some reports suggest that although human and large animal \u03b3\u03b4 T cells produce IL-17 (induced phenotype), they may not be a major early source of this cytokine in these species [10], [85]. Although they are clearly protective in most instances and are thought to be important to the early innate immune response, dysregulation of IL-17 production leading to excessive IL-17 can also be pathogenic [86]. KGF and IGF are also produced by tissue \u03b3\u03b4 T cells and are important in maintaining epithelial cell health and effective wound repair responses [87], [88], [89], [90]. Though defined as important in tissue homeostasis, these responses are also important for host defense, since health of the epithelial cell barrier contributes to protection against various pathogens and the creation of homeostatic environment for commensal microbiota.",

In HIV infection, the peripheral subset of human \u03b3\u03b4 T (V\u03b42) cells is severely depleted and does not completely recover, even in patients who have had successful antiretroviral treatment. This deficit may increase the likelihood for secondary infections and could be a critical target for new immunotherapies for HIV patients [94].",

As human \u03b3\u03b4 T cells are preprogrammed for recognition of bacterial phosphoantigens, they are particularly important in protection from Mycobacterium and Legionella infections [97], [98]. Human \u03b3\u03b4 T cells expand during Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium (ST) infection of the intestinal mucosa [99] and are a source of early IFN\u03b3 [100], [101]. Bovine \u03b3\u03b4 T cells also respond to oral ST infection [102]. \u03b3\u03b4 T cells also play a critical role in protection against infection with Brucella sp., which are facultative intracellular bacteria [103]. This appears to be primarily through production of IFN\u03b3, and was found in mice, cattle, and sheep [103], [104]. However, our results showed no contribution of mouse \u03b3\u03b4 T cells to infection with another emerging intracellular pathogen, Coxiella burnetii (unpublished results). Following mucosal infection but not peripheral infection, mouse \u03b3\u03b4 T cells were also found to have a role in downstream memory immune responses to Listeria infection [27]. Thus, \u03b3\u03b4 T cells play an important role in response against many different bacterial infections. This suggests that their specific stimulation may contribute to protection and may potentially replace or at least reduce the need for antibiotics and could be considered as a new target for future vaccine development.",

They respond to and are protective following initial infection with the malaria Plasmodium falciparum, owing to recognition of phosphoantigens produced by the parasite. However, upon subsequent infection, the numbers of \u03b3\u03b4 T cells drop, similar to the situation with long-term HIV infection. Nonetheless, higher numbers of functional V\u03b42 T cells are correlated with greater protection from reinfection with Plasmodium and also increased symptoms upon infection, as they are sources of IFN\u03b3 and TNF-\u03b1 [105]. Similarly, the first instance of bovine IL-17-producing cells was demonstrated and protects against a related parasite [106]. Indeed, in most instances of protection from pathogens, \u03b3\u03b4 T cells are similarly protective in humans and other animals [6]. Common features across species provide a rationale for the use of various animal models to test the role and importance of \u03b3\u03b4 T cells in disease settings of relevance to humans, which will lead to the creation of strategic platforms for \u03b3\u03b4 T-cell-targeted vaccine development.",

Combined with the ability to expand these cells in vitro and their critical roles in a variety of infectious and cancerous disease settings, \u03b3\u03b4 T cells have been the target for new immunotherapeutics [11], [28], [29], [30], [34], [91]. In humans, both TCR and TLR agonists have been studied for their effects on enhancing \u03b3\u03b4 T cell function. Prenyl phosphates and bisphosphonates that directly or indirectly drive expansion and cytokine production in a major subset of circulating \u03b3\u03b4 T cells have been pursued for treatment of certain tumors and infections [29]. Two approaches have been used. In the first approach, \u03b3\u03b4 T cells are expanded to large numbers in vitro and then adoptively transferred to patients. In the second approach, these agonists are given directly to the patient, inducing responses in vivo. The in vivo responses of \u03b3\u03b4 T cells to these agonists are impressive, leading to significant expansion in tissues, such as the lung and production of immune cytokines [107]. Of note, though originally pursued for cancer treatments, the potential application of phosphoantigen stimulation of \u03b3\u03b4 T cells in infectious disease was recently demonstrated in Mycobacterium tuberculosis infection in primates [108]. The application of these therapeutic approaches to stimulate \u03b3\u03b4 T cells is limited to humans and nonhuman primates, since \u03b3\u03b4 T cell responses to the prenyl phosphates are restricted to primate cells. Other therapeutic approaches to increase \u03b3\u03b4 T cell activity have focused on other receptors, such as TLRs and scavenger receptors [19], [20].",

The first source of polysaccharide agonist was Funtumia elastica bark (Yamoa). Yamoa polysaccharides activate \u03b3\u03b4 T as well other immune cells, such as monocytes, and, when given in vivo, enhance protection from infection [110]. Optimal activation or priming of \u03b3\u03b4 T cells by these polysaccharides requires monocytes or macrophages in a mixed in vitro culture. Following our initial characterization of the Yamoa polysaccharides, similar activity was defined in extracts from other plants, including tansy (unpublished), juniper (unpublished), and, most recently, a\u00e7ai [111], [122], [123]. Many of the polysaccharide preparations being tested, except for those generated from a\u00e7ai, were positive in the limulus amebocyte lysate assay for lipopolysaccharides [124]. A\u00e7ai polysaccharide responses are conserved in \u03b3\u03b4 T cells across species, including humans, cattle, and mice [111]. Monocytes and macrophages are also activated by the polysaccharides and are required for optimal responses by the \u03b3\u03b4 T cell. Instillation of a\u00e7ai polysaccharides into the lungs of mice induces dose-dependent IL-12 production, accumulation of myeloid cells, and activation of local DCs and macrophages [111]. It was subsequently shown that prophylactic or therapeutic nasal administration of a\u00e7ai polysaccharides significantly enhances host innate defense responses against the intracellular bacterial pathogens Francisella tularensis and Burkholderia pseudomallei\n[125]. Protection could also be achieved following oral delivery, although responses were more variable. Mechanism of action studies showed that a\u00e7ai polysaccharides enhance IFN\u03b3 expression by \u03b3\u03b4 T cells and NK cells following F. tularensis and B. pseudomallei infections. Inhibition of IFN\u03b3 blocked the protective effect of the polysaccharides [125]. Thus, the stimulation of \u03b3\u03b4 T cells, as well as other innate immune cells, by a\u00e7ai or similar plant agonists and subsequent type 1 T helper cell-associated responses, could have therapeutic applications in bacterial infections.",

Dysbiosis is a condition usually induced by antibiotic use in which the normal flora is disrupted. This state can lead to increased susceptibility to infection and colitis [126]. Mice with dysbiosis were treated with a\u00e7ai polysaccharides to assess whether these polysaccharides could aid in recovery from this susceptible state. When cytokine expression in mesenteric lymph nodes (MLNs) and spleen cells were measured, the feeding of a\u00e7ai polysaccharides induced expression of IL-12 in supernatant fluids from cultured MLN and spleen cells from the treated mice. IL-12 was also detected in the serum of the mice [127]. Expression of IFN\u03b3 was also increased in spleen cells from a\u00e7ai polysaccharide-fed mice, similar to the previous finding using nasal administration [125]. No adverse effects were noted in the a\u00e7ai-treated mice. In a model of chemically induced colitis, mice that were fed a\u00e7ai had a reduced deleterious inflammatory response in the gut [127]. Considering that there are no adverse effects following a\u00e7ai ingestion, this polysaccharide could represent a safe and novel approach to stimulating \u03b3\u03b4 T cells and other innate cells, potentially to promote their innate protective and homeostatic functions at the mucosal surface.\n",

Some of responses were lost in mice lacking functional TLR4 or the innate adaptor protein MyD88. However, neutrophils were still recruited into the peritoneum of these mice following intraperitoneal injection of a\u00e7ai [111]. The role of the \u03b2-glucan receptor dectin-1 was particularly investigated, since IL-12 is produced by immune cells following ingestion of \u03b2-glucans [128]. Our result demonstrated that a\u00e7ai polysaccharides contain appropriate linkages for recognition by dectin-1 using an inhibition ELISA against \u03b2-glucan [127]. Furthermore, a\u00e7ai polysaccharides specifically block binding of anti-dectin-1 antibodies to immune cells in a flow cytometry based assay. Thus, a\u00e7ai polysaccharides bind to multiple innate immune cell receptors, contributing to unique effects of innate and likely downstream adaptive immune responses. A\u00e7ai polysaccharides can be considered as a new mucosal immunomodulator molecule for the regulation of antigen-specific immune response and inflammation.",

One such agonist was determined to be amphotericin B (AmB), produced by Streptomyces nodosus. AmB is a commonly used antifungal drug that has previously been shown to stimulate innate immune cells [129], [130], [131]. AmB induces expression of cytokines in macrophages, mediated by TLR recognition [132], [133], [134]. AmB treatment of bovine PBMCs leads to increased expression of IL-2R selectively on \u03b3\u03b4 T cells, activation of bovine monocytes and NK cells, and enhanced IFN\u03b3 from NK cells [112]. Addition of IL-2 to these cultures induces a robust, antigen-independent proliferation of the treated \u03b3\u03b4 T cells [112]. The agonist activity of AmB is not restricted to cattle, in that similar effects are seen on expression of activation markers and proliferation of \u03b3\u03b4 T cells in humans and mice as well [112]. Thus the response is highly conserved. In a separate study, AmB was shown to increase IFN\u03b3 production in mouse lung cells following in vitro infection and costimulation by avirulent C. burnetii bacteria [127]. AmB also enhances antibody responses against ovalbumin when used as an immunizing adjuvant [127]. Thus AmB has potential both to enhance innate and acquired responses to infection and to function as a vaccine adjuvant.",

When bovine calves are less than a week-old, they have a variable colostrum status, and they experience a broad spectrum of natural scouring and respiratory maladies in their first week to 3 months of life. These symptoms are typically caused by rotavirus, coronavirus, Cryptosporidium, or a combination of virus and parasite infections. Regardless of the cause, the calves are treated with a hydration therapy. If signs of a secondary bacterial infection become apparent, antibiotics are administered. The calves were likely preexposed to a variety of pathogens; this would explain the early disease that occurs when they are housed indoors in clean facilities. With years of data on these occurrences of natural illness in our facilities, our study was directed to test whether early minimal treatments with AmB could potentially be used as a broad-spectrum prophylactic immunomodulator. A dose of 0.25 mg/kg injected intravenously as previously described [112] was used in the study. This is approximately 10-fold less than the doses given to patients for antifungal treatment and was determined to be nontoxic in calves. There were two treated groups (n=12 per group). One group received a single injection of AmB on the day of arrival at our facility (AmB x1). A second group received this initial dose on the day of their arrival and a second dose after 10 days (AmB x2). Thus, for the first 10 days, there were 24 calves treated with one dose of AmB. Health condition was assessed by evaluating each animal\u2019s subjective appearance and attitude, appetite, temperature, pulse and respirations, fecal consistency, and treatments on a scale of 0\u20135. Health condition was assessed for all calves twice daily and was compared to calves acquired in the same 3 months in a 5-year span before and after this experiment that did not receive any treatment. In a given period, the study tallied the number of days the calves had perfect health scores (scores of 0). The calves that received one injection of AmB had improved health assessments in their first 10 days in comparison to calves that received no treatment (Fig. 46.1A\n). The period was then extended to the first 30 days. In this case, the untreated calves were compared to the AmB x1 and AmB x2 groups. Whereas one dose of AmB appeared to benefit in the short term (in the first 10 days), the AmB x1 treatment had no lasting effect. In contrast, calves treated with AmB x2 had longer-lasting positive benefit (Fig. 46.1B). These data suggest that minimal early doses of an innate immune stimulant could benefit the health of livestock for extended periods. This is especially important for cattle that are subject to repeated infections early in life. It also provides proof of principle that broad-spectrum protection against an array of mucosal pathogens can likely be achieved through prophylactic use of an innate immune stimulant.",

Some TCR and TLR agonists that can stimulate \u03b3\u03b4 T cells have already been used extensively for new cancer treatments. Ample data suggest that the cells might also be specifically stimulated to protect from infectious and inflammatory disease. Considering the growing concerns about the use and overuse of antibiotics, it is critical that such novel approaches to counter infectious agents be pursued.",
