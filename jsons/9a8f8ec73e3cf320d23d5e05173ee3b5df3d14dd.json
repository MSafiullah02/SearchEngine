            "text": "A seroepidemiologic study was conducted in North China in 2003 to determine the neutralizing antibody titer of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) convalescent sera. A total of 99 SARS convalescent serum samples were collected from patients from the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region, Hebei Province, and Beijing 35-180 days after the onset of symptoms. The anti-SARS antibodies were detected by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), neutralization assay, and Western blot. Eightyseven serum samples were confirmed to be positive for SARS antibodies. The neutralizing antibody titer of the 87 positive sera was analyzed quantitatively by neutralization assay. The geometric mean titer (GMT) of the 87 convalescent sera was 1:61. The Kolmogorov-Smirnov test showed that the neutralizing antibody titers conform to normal distribution, which suggests that the average anti-SARS antibody level in this study was representative of the convalescent antibody level of the SARS population. This result could be useful for the development and quality control of SARS vaccines.",

As of July 2003, 8,096 cases of SARS had been reported and 774 of the infected patients died. From April to May 2004, China reported nine new laboratory-acquired SARS cases. To prevent future recurrence of SARS, more than a dozen SARS candidate vaccines are under development [Gao et al., 2003; Bisht et al., 2004; Marshall and Enserink, 2004; Yang et al., 2004] . There is an urgent need for an accurate measurement of SARS convalescent serum antibody levels as a reference to evaluate the efficacy of vaccine. Many efforts have been devoted to quantifying SARS-CoV specific antibody titer using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) Shi et al., 2003; Huang et al., 2004] , but the results are not comparable among different studies. In one report, the IgG antibody titer of convalescent serum measured by indirect ELISA was around 1:640 . In another report, the antibody measured was specific to recombinant SARS nucleocapsid (N) protein and the titer was expressed by the logarithm [Liu et al., 2004] . Since standardized reagents for SARS antibody detection have not become available, the data on SARS antibody titer reported from various researchers are not applicable for SARS vaccine evaluation. Neutralization assay measures the ability of sera to neutralize the infectivity of SARS-CoV in cell culture. It is a stable method and does not involve external reagents. To gain a comprehensive understanding of the antibody to SARS-CoV, we report the anti-SARS antibody titer of 87 SARS convalescent sera determined by neutralization assay. It provides important information for the development of SARS vaccine.",

Then the mixture was added to confluent monolayer of Vero cells in 96-well plates and incubated at 378C in a 5% CO 2 incubator for 4 days. On day 4, the presence of viral CPE was checked. The dilution of serum that completely inhibited CPE in 50% of the cells was calculated using the Reed-Muench formula [Reed and Muench, 1938] . Both positive and negative controls were included in each test. Meanwhile, in each assay, the SARS-CoV was re-titrated for its infectivity (CCID 50 /0.1 ml) in parallel.",

ELISA, the most widely used assay, possesses a sensitivity and specificity of over 98% in some reports [Wu et al., 2004] . The objective of this investigation was to provide a profile of anti-SARS neutralizing antibody Of these 87 sera, 86 were double positive for ELISA and neutralization assay, the remaining 1 serum was double positive for neutralization assay and Western blot. titer from convalescent patients, rather than establishing neutralization assay as a diagnostic method for SARS. In our laboratory, a combination of ELISA, neutralization assay, and Western blot were performed on 99 SARS convalescent sera. Using these methods, 87 sera were confirmed to be positive for anti-SARS antibody. The results from the neutralization assay accord with those from ELISA and Western blot. A high level of consistency was demonstrated for ELISA and the neutralization assay (86/87 [98.9%]) for these 87 positive samples, illustrating the high sensitivity and specificity of the neutralization assay. The GMT of anti-SARS neutralizing antibody was quantitated to be 1:61, and the normal distribution of the neutralizing antibody titer was shown by statistical analysis. The neutralization assay could, therefore, become a useful tool for the surveillance of SARS serological epidemiology. It has been demonstrated in a mouse model that the neutralizing antibody elicited by primary infection of SARS-CoV can protect animals from re-infection. In addition, passive transfer of this immune serum to na\u00efve mice can prevent SARS-CoV replication in the respiratory tract . Yang et al. showed that a DNA vaccine encoding the spike (S) glycoprotein of the SARS-CoV induced mice to generate T-cell and neutralizing antibody responses, as well as a protective immune response. They demonstrated that the protection was mediated by a humoral but not a T-celldependent immune mechanism by T-cell depletion and passive transfer of purified IgG. Although more investigations on humoral and cellular immunity are needed in humans, it is reasonable to conclude that human neutralizing antibody is protective against SAR-CoV.",
