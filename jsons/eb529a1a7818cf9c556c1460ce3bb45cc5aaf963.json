Materials and methods: In this retrospective single-center study, we enrolled consecutive patients from February 15, 2020, to March 15, 2020, with laboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 hospitalized in Valduce Hospital (Como, Italy). Multi-modality imaging findings were evaluated and compared. Literature research was conducted through a methodical search on Pubmed and Embase databases. Results: Fifty-eight patients (36 men, 22 women; age range, 18-98 years) were included in the study. Among these, chest US, CXR, and CT were performed respectively in twenty-two, thirty-two and forty-two patients. Lung US findings were consistent with diffuse B lines (100%) and subpleural consolidations (27.3%). CXR showed prevalent manifestations of consolidations (46.9%) and hazy increased opacities (37.5%). Typical CT features included bilateral and multilobar ground-glass opacities (GGO) with (59.5%) and without (35.7%) consolidations having a predominantly peripheral distribution (64.3%). Other imaging features included crazy paving pattern (57.1%), fibrous stripes (50%), subpleural lines (35.7%), architectural distortion (28.6%), air bronchogram sign (26.2%), vascular thickening (23.8%) and nodules (2.4%). Also, enlarged lymph nodes (14.3 %) and pleural effusion (7.1%) were observed. The literature review identified twenty-six original studies supporting our imaging chest findings. Conclusion: The spectrum of chest imaging manifestations of COVID-19 pneumonia upon admission includes Blines and consolidations on US, consolidations and hazy increased opacities on CXR, and multifocal GGO with consolidations on CT.",

At present, Italy is the second most affected SARS-CoV-2 country in the world with 35713 total confirmed cases up to 19 March 2020 [33] . In a setting of high clinical suspicion, due to typical clinical symptoms and previous exposure to other individuals with SARS-CoV-2, a combination of chest imaging elements and repeat laboratory RT-PCR may help to increase the COVID-19 diagnosis. For this reason, it is of crucial importance to define imaging patterns of COVID-19 pneumonia in order to promptly diagnose the viral infection in acute stages and to lead to the correct work-up. We retrospectively evaluated multi-modality imaging hallmarks of 36 patients with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19, during the early phases of the disease. The salient manifestations on CXR were consolidations in fifteen patients and hazy increased opacities in twelve patients with bilateral lower lobe predominant distribution; as reported in the literature review, CXR lacks sensitivity in the early stages of lung disease [16, 27] .",

Our findings were consistent with the collected data described in recent studies. Regarding lesions distribution, we confirmed the bilateral and multifocal lung [9] , and it has been correlated to the hyperemia induced by an acute inflammatory response, expression of temporal changes. Accordingly, different CT manifestations have been associated with the disease progression, based on the physiopathology of the acute lung injury induced by viral pneumonia; of note Jin et al [34] recognized five temporal stages classified as ultra-early, early, rapid progression, consolidation, and dissipation stages. In details, in the ultra-early stage, CT elements may be single or multiple focal GGO, nodules enclosed by GGO, patchy consolidations, and air-bronchogram signs; the early stage is characterized by multiple GGO, patchy consolidations, or a combination of GGO and interlobular septal thickening expression of increased interlobular interstitial edema, alveolar capillary congestion and exudate fluid in alveolar sac [34] . During the rapid progression, there is a worsening of the inflammatory damage corresponding to CT features such as large consolidative opacities and contextual air bronchograms; these findings gradually may decrease in size and density during the consolidation stage. Finally, in the dissipation stage, lesions may be reduced of number and extension, with remaining small ill-defined consolidative opacities, reticular opacities and interlobular septal thickening [34] .",
