Diagnosis of suspected LRT infection in immunocompromised hosts is particularly challenging due to the broad range of viral, bacterial and other infectious and non-infectious etiologies presenting in a similar fashion (Bajaj and Tombach 2017). The rapid detection of infectious causes can lead to diagnostic clarity, targeted and timely therapy and implementation of infection control practices to limit transmission (Kim et al. 2007).",

These multiplex assays significantly increase diagnostic yield (i.e. the number and range of organisms detected) by detecting potential pathogens not routinely identified by traditional methods (Hanson and Couturier, 2016, Ko and Drews, 2017). The BioFire FilmArray Respiratory Panel (FA RP) is one such fully automated method that simultaneously detects 17 respiratory viruses and 3 bacterial targets (Poritz et al. 2011). The FA RP was chosen for this study for its comprehensive list of targets, rapid turn-around time and ease of use. However, the FA RP is currently only approved for nasopharyngeal (NP) specimens with limited data available on its performance using bronchoscopy specimens.",

Thus far, the majority of studies evaluating the performance of the FA RP were done using NP swabs (Andersson et al., 2014, Babady et al., 2018, Butt et al., 2014, Hayden et al., 2012, Kaku et al., 2018, Loeffelholz et al., 2011, Pierce et al., 2012, Renaud et al., 2012, Van Wesenbeeck et al., 2013). Only a few studies have included LRT specimens, such as BAL and BAS, in addition to URT samples. Azadeh et al. found that testing of BAL specimens with the FA RP increased the diagnostic yield in immunocompromised patients with an initial negative NP swab (Azadeh et al. 2018). In the most extensive study to date, Ruggiero et al. evaluated the performance of the FA RP on retrospective clinical and spiked LRT specimens and showed that the FA RP performed very well on these specimen types. Additionally, they determined that the limit of detection (LOD) of FA RP on LRT specimens was either lower or very similar to the LOD on NP swabs for all targets (Ruggiero et al. 2014). However, all of these studies were done on archived samples only and were limited by the small number of LRT samples included and low coverage of FA RP targets in the clinical samples tested. To our knowledge, this is the largest study to date that investigated performance of the FA RP on archived and prospectively collected bronchoscopy specimens.",

While syndromic molecular testing can increase sensitivity for detection of respiratory pathogens, these tests cannot distinguish between colonized and infected patients; therefore it is important to perform these tests only in patients with appropriate clinical indication.

Couturier et al. noted that the LOD of FA RP compared to their lab developed tests was much higher (>2.5 log difference) for AdV than other viral targets (Couturier et al. 2013). However, these studies used an earlier version of FA RP with decreased sensitivity of AdV due to limited coverage of some AdV serotypes [FilmArray v 1.6 package insert]. The FA RP assay has since been revised and the modified FA RP version 1.7 has demonstrated increased sensitivity for AdV and improved AdV serotype coverage (Andersson et al., 2014, Doern et al., 2013). With the updated FA RP version 1.7 used in this study we did not observe any significant differences in the performance for AdV between the 2 multiplex assays. Only 1 of 3 AdV results remained discordant and was considered to be a false negative by FA RP.",
