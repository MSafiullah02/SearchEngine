For infection rates the time between bleeds during the influenza season is expressed as a proportion of the season's duration. For disease the total follow up time during the influenza season is expressed as a proportion of the season's duration. This methodology is chosen to allow comparison of rates during seasons of different duration and to account for differing person follow up time within seasons. An alternative approach whereby each season was assumed to last 5 months gave similar results (data not shown).

We then subtracted the direct measurements of the percentage infected during the second wave (based on data from those individuals recruited after the first wave) to give estimates of infection over the summer wave. Underreporting of illness may affect the observed attributable rate (e.g. if 85% of illnesses are reported in both those infected and those not infected, then the observed attributable rate will be 85% of the true attributable rate). Sensitivity analyses therefore estimated an adjusted attributable rate (ARa) by inflating the observed attributable rate (ARo) by the observed level of underreporting (based on the proportion (p) of expected weekly illness status reports received during periods of influenza circulation. ARa=ARo*(1/p) The rate of PCR confirmed disease in seroconverters was calculated as a measure of how often infection led to confirmed disease.

Similar seasonal influenza infection levels were identified in historical studies from the United States, but these were confined to households with children. 11 These seasonal infection rates are also similar to those measured in rural Vietnam despite markedly different climate, seasonality and social conditions. 12 We found similar infection rates (18%) with highest rates in children during the 2009 pandemic. Other community studies measuring 2009 pandemic infection rates from paired sera are almost exclusively confined to South East Asia, and show similar levels of infection. [13] [14] [15] 17, 18 A meta-analysis of age specific cumulative incidence for the 2009 pandemic from 19 countries (mainly based on comparing population antibody prevalence before and after the pandemic rather than on paired sera from the same individuals) showed a similar overall age standardized rate of 21% with highest rates in children. 16, 19 This figure excluded US and Norway where high vaccination rates distorted results. We show that the 2010/11 pandemic wave was the only season in our study when the highest infection rates were in young adults but found no other community studies using paired sera in countries that experienced this third wave. Infection rates from previous pandemics are largely missing or are limited in interpretation due to large vaccination campaigns. 20 In England a study comparing population serological profiles before and after the first wave of the 2009 pandemic estimated that in London and the West Midlands 21.3% of children younger than 5 years of age, 42.0% of 5-14-year-olds, and 20.6% of 15-24-yearolds were infected with no evidence of infection in older age groups. 7 In other regions, only children younger than 15 years showed a significant increase from baseline (6.3%). Later work showed an increase in serologically defined infection in young adults in the third pandemic wave (2010/11) in England. 21 The consistency of findings from Flu Watch, from historical studies of seasonal influenza in temperate climates and from studies of seasonal and pandemic influenza in South East Asia suggests that frequent influenza infection (affecting in the region of a fifth of the population each year) with highest rates in children is an international phenomenon that is likely generalizable across settings.
