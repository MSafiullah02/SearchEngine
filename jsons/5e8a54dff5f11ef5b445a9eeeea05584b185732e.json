Further, prosocial motivations, including SOCIAL DISTANCING AND MENTAL HEALTH 4 concern for the welfare of others, have also been linked with greater prosocial action [8] and psychological well-being [9] . In the context of social distancing, youth may endorse motives connected with personal autonomy (e.g., not wanting to get personally sick), prosocial action (e.g., not wanting to get others sick), or control (e.g., parental rules, city/state lockdown). Youth motivated by autonomous or prosocial reasons may engage in more social distancing relative to those who are not motivated by these reasons.

Adolescence is a period associated with increased risk for the development of many psychiatric disorders, such as anxiety and depression [10] . Additionally, a number of hormonal and neurobiological changes during adolescence correspond with heightened emotional reactivity and the ongoing development of coping strategies and stress regulation [11, 12] . Simultaneously, adolescence is marked by the increased importance of peer relationships and a greater reliance on peers for social support [13, 14] . Peer interactions help contribute to adolescents' social health by enhancing their sense of belonging and reducing a sense of burdensomeness on others, both of which are considered crucial interpersonal needs [15] . Examining connections between social distancing motivations and mental and social health among youth may provide important insight into potential avenues for reducing the psychological consequences of social distancing among this at-risk population.",
