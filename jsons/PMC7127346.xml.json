Diseases like cystic fibrosis, asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, lung cancer and more could be treated by high-level and long-term expression of the corresponding gene of interest [1], [2], [3], [4], [5]. Furthermore, many pathogens that enter the body through the airways, causing pulmonary as well as systemic diseases like Mycobacterium tuberculosis, influenza and SARS-associated coronavirus (SARS\u2013CoV) could be controlled once appropriate vaccination strategies would be applied [6], [7], [8], [9]. Pulmonary vaccination against air-borne pathogens holds the promise of inducing both systemic and local immune responses, resulting in the induction of IgA mucosal antibodies that can prevent the pathogen's entry at the level of the mucosal surface [10], [11].",

These carriers must be efficient in transfection, safe for human use, protect the DNA from degradation before arriving at the target cell and possibly hold targeting qualities for the specific delivery of the gene to the required cells or tissue. The two approaches for gene delivery are viral and non-viral systems. Although very efficient in transfection, viral gene delivery systems still face safety issues for human use and due to their inherent immunogenicity, are problematic when repeated doses with the same carrier are required. Non-viral delivery systems are generally synthetic agents that are much safer, however, their transfection efficiency in-vivo is limited [12], [13].",

These polymers were extensively evaluated for their ability to deliver a variety of therapeutic agents by targeted and/or sustained delivery, were tested for toxicity and safety in animal models and are currently used in humans for resorbable sutures, bone implants and scaffolds in tissue engineering [14], [15], [16]. PLGA nanoparticles were shown to escape from the endo-lysosomal compartment to the cytoplasmic compartment and release their contents over extended periods of time [17], [18]. These properties rendered PLGA nanoparticles as potential efficient sustained release gene delivery systems. Furthermore, PLGA particles were shown to be taken up by antigen presenting cells (APCs) like macrophages and dendritic cells (DCs), therefore proving their ability to serve as DNA vaccine carriers [19], [20]. In cases where adsorption of DNA on the surface was desired, positively charged agents like cetyltrimethylammonium bromide (CTAB) were used to produce PLG particles that are positively charged at physiological pH. These particles were able to induce higher antibody and cytotoxic immune responses to HIV-1 pCMV p55 gag plasmid in vivo [21], [22], [23].",

The size measurements revealed a polydispersity index lower than 0.2, indicating narrow particle size distributions. The stable particle size and the narrow distribution suggest that the preparation technique is reproducible and results in the formation of uniform particles at both PLGA\u2013PEI ratios. DNA loading did not change particle size for PEI\u2013DNA ratios between 5:1 and 0.5:1. Although particles in the micrometer size range have better lung deposition than nanoparticles [31], it was shown that nanoparticles have relatively higher intracellular uptake compared to microparticles and that in some cell-lines, only nanoparticles were taken up efficiently [14], [32]. The stable nano-size of these particles makes them suitable for uptake by pulmonary epithelial cells and APCs, which is the first step for gene delivery. The zeta potential of PEI\u2013DNA ratio of 5:1 was 52.3 and 53.5 mV for PLGA\u2013PEI ratios 25:1 and 10:1, respectively, while PEI\u2013DNA ratio of 0.5:1 resulted in lower zeta potential values of 36.0 and 32.1 mV (Table 1). These results indicate that the zeta potential was not affected by the PLGA\u2013PEI ratio; however, it was influenced by the PEI\u2013DNA ratio. The positive surface charge of the particles is a result of the orientation of PEI on the surface, since PLGA particles have a negative surface charge. The positively charged particle surface can facilitate adherence to negatively charged cellular membranes, inducing and increasing intracellular uptake.",

Since our initial loading dose was 5 \u03bcg, the accuracy of this assay was high, considering 0.1% of the loading dose is still above the detection limit of the PicoGreen assay. This high and reproducible loading efficiency correlates with efficient surface adsorption that prevents material loss and suggests that even in the PEI\u2013DNA ratio of 0.5:1, there is excess of nitrogen groups from the PEI over the phosphate groups of the DNA. Gautam et al. calculated that a 10:1 N/P ratio corresponds to 1.29:1 PEI\u2013DNA weight ratio using the 25 kDa PEI [26], confirming that at 0.5:1 weight ratio there are still more nitrogen groups present than phosphate. Since we assume the PEI is physically attached to the nanoparticles surface, the exact number of nitrogen groups on the particle surface should be further evaluated in order to determine the exact N/P ratio.",

The late endosomal distribution is visualized by immunostaining for LAMP-1 protein with an Alexa-conjugated secondary antibody (a). It was shown that after 6 h, the rhodamine-labeled DNA (b) is co-localized with the lysosomal signal (c). These results show that the particles were taken up by the lung epithelial cells and the DNA was located in the endo-lysosomal compartment. The culture conditions in the case of Calu-3 cells are of extreme importance since culture at air-interface (removal of apical culture medium one day after seeding) resulted in a morphology more representative of the in vivo situation in comparison to culture under submerged conditions (presence of culture medium on both sides of the cell monolayer) [33], [34]. The fact that the nanoparticles were internalized and the DNA was transferred to the endo-lysosomal compartment despite the presence of cilia and mucus suggested that these particles were suitable to deliver DNA across mucosal surfaces of the lung. GFP protein expression was detected in Calu-3 cells, however, the signal was rather low. The fact that protein was detected suggested that a certain percentage of the particles could escape the endo-lysosomal compartment and DNA was able to enter the nucleus. Since the DNA is directly attached to the PEI on the particles surface and the PEI is more exposed to interaction with the endo-lysosomal membrane than the PLGA, we assume that the endo-lysosmal escape is governed by intrinsic characteristics of PEI. PEI is one of a few polycations that has a high transfection potential due to its intrinsic endosomolytic activity caused by high buffer capacity at virtually any pH. Upon acidification of the endo-lysosome, PEI causes osmotic swelling and subsequent endosomal rupture followed by the escape of PEI/DNA complexes into the cytosol [13], [25]. Since PLGA\u2013PEI nanoparticles delivered the DNA into the cells, escaped the endo-lysosmal compartment and resulted in protein expression, they should be regarded as a new promising DNA carrier for pulmonary delivery. This study evaluated qualitatively the intracellular pathway of the DNA loaded PLGA\u2013PEI nanoparticles, however, quantitative analysis of protein expression in cell culture and using in-vivo models will be further investigated.",

When the PEI\u2013DNA ratio decreased, cell viability increased above 94% for the 1:1 ratio and full recovery was seen at the 0.5:1 ratio. This suggests that cell toxicity was independent on the PLGA\u2013PEI ratio, but was markedly affected by the PEI\u2013DNA ratio. Since an equal amount of DNA was given to all groups, the difference in cell viability reflected the amount of PLGA and PEI delivered. It was previously reported that PLGA particles did not significantly affect the viability of macrophages and DCs, even when loaded with a large number of microspheres and successive microsphere decay where acidic degradation products are formed [20]. However, it was shown in Calu-3 cells that higher PEI\u2013DNA ratio correlates with higher cytotoxicity [35]. The results we present here show that cell toxicity can be reduced by using lower PEI\u2013DNA ratio that will bear the same characteristics and loading efficiency as the higher PEI\u2013DNA ratios. The non-toxic formulations will be further evaluated for their in-vitro and in-vivo ability to serve as DNA carriers for the purposes of gene therapy and vaccination.",
