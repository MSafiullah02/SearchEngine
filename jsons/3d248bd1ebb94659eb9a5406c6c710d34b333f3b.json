Therefore, the availability of reliable forecasts for the number of cases in the coming days is of fundamental importance. We propose a simple statistical method for short-term real-time forecasting of the number of Covid-19 cases and fatalities in countries that are latecomers -i.e., countries where cases of the disease started to appear some time after others. In particular, we propose a penalized (LASSO) regression with an error correction mechanism to construct a model of a latecomer in terms of the other countries that were at a similar stage of the pandemic some days before. By tracking the number of cases and deaths in those countries, we forecast through an adaptive rolling-window scheme the number of cases and deaths in the latecomer. We apply this methodology to Brazil, and show that (so far) it has been performing very well. These forecasts aim to foster a better short-run management of the health system capacity.",

On the other hand, in Brazil, a latecomer, the 100th case was confirmed only on March 14. Hence, the idea is to use, for instance, data from France on February 29 and Spain on March 2 to explain the number of cases in Brazil on March 14.

Column 1 reports the forecasting date, and column 2 reports observed data on cases and fatalities up to date (11 observations). 5 John Hopkins data available at https://github.com/CSSEGISandData/COVID-19 6 Brazilian Ministry of Health data available at https://covid.saude.gov.br/ 7 The selected countries were Iran, Italy, Japan, South Korea and Singapore. Consider, first, the number of cases (top panel). By comparing with observed data, a total mean absolute percentage error of 6.8% is found, with worst case value reaching 22.3%. Now consider accumulated forecasts of the number of fatalities (bottom panel). The total mean absolute percentage error is 10.7%, with a worst case value of 30.1%, somewhat larger figures than those for the number of cases. These statistics reveal two features of the model. It has been performing very well on average. Also, although the model might generate large errors, it is flexible enough to adjust and revise the forecasts to incoming data. Indeed, Figure 3 reports mean absolute percentage errors per forecasting horizon for both number of cases (blue bars) and deaths (red bars), and note that larger errors are concentrated at longer horizons.",

We believe this is a useful tool to inform health management. Nonetheless, structural breaks might worsen forecasts a few days after such breaks. So the use of this tool should complemented with other external information, such as proxies for social distancing, to guide subjective or objective assessments on potential dynamic changes on the pandemic's evolution. We hope to keep improving the model by improving the methodology and incorporating more information. And we aim to keep forecasts, methodology and codes updated on a daily basis at https://covid19analytics.com.br/.
