Current treatment modalities aim to delay the deterioration in lung function, which is mostly responsible for the relatively short life expectancy of CF sufferers; however none have so far successfully dealt with the underlying molecular defect. Novel pharmacological approaches to ameliorate the lack of active CFTR in respiratory epithelial cells are beginning to address more of the pathophysiological defects caused by CFTR mutations. However, CFTR gene replacement by gene therapy remains the most likely option for addressing the basic defects, including ion transport and inflammatory functions of CFTR. In this chapter, we will review the latest preclinical and clinical advances in pharmacotherapy and gene therapy for CF lung disease.",

            "text": "Cystic fibrosis (CF) is the most common lethal autosomal recessive disorder among Caucasians. It is caused by mutations in the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) gene identified by positional cloning in 1989 [1] [2] [3] , which encodes a chloride (Cl -) channel expressed in the epithelia of many tissues. The gene encodes a single polypeptide chain of 1480 amino acids, with a predicted molecular weight of around 168 kDa [1] . The CFTR protein is embedded in the apical membrane of epithelial cells and is made up of distinct structural domains, including two membrane spanning domains (MSDs), two nucleotide binding domains (NBD) containing conserved motifs for ATP binding and hydrolysis, and a regulatory domain (R) [4] . The CFTR protein, a member of the ABC family of proteins, normally functions as a cAMP-activated Clchannel [5] , and has been shown to interact with other ion channels and transporters, such as the amiloride-sensitive epithelial sodium channel, ENaC (recently reviewed by Berdiev et al. [6] ) and the outwardly rectifying chloride channel (ORCC) (reviewed by Kunzelmann, [7] ).",

Mutations in the CFTR gene are grouped into five classes, based on their effect on CFTR protein expression and/or function: Class I-III mutations commonly cause severe disease phenotypes, Class IV and V mutations tend to be associated with milder disease, although not systematically for lung disease which can be highly variable even within identical genetic backgrounds [8, 9] .",

The production of thick, sticky mucus in the lumen of the lung impedes mucociliary clearance [11] , a consequence of which is chronic inflamm ation and recurrent bacterial infections (typically Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Burkholderia cepacia complex), in a self-perpetuating cycle that leads to the progressive destruction of lung tissue [10] .

The PCL also acts as a lubricant between the mucus layer and the mucins tethered to the cell surface to facilitate cough clearance [13, 14] . Finally PCL contains antimicrobial peptides and proteins (e.g., defensins, lysozyme, lactoferrin and anti-microbial surfactant proteins) to fight pathogens [15] . In CF these processes are disrupted, causing dysregulation of liquid movement, and lung infection and inflammation [16] .",

The airway epithelium is thought to regulate ASL volume so that the height of the PCL layer is approximately the same as that of the extended cilia on the cell surface of the epithelium (around 7 \u03bcm) [18] , allowing them to beat efficiently. In CF airways, the ASL volume and hence PCL height is decreased, making the mucus layer sticky and harder to move [18] . The resulting flattening of the cilia prevents them from beating [19] , causing mucus to adhere to cells [14] . Together these events lead to defective mucociliary clearance, initiating the chronic cycle of infection and inflammation characteristic of CF lungs (reviewed by Boucher, 2007 [20] ).",

CF is a good candidate for this technology as it is primarily caused by mutations in a single gene, a normal copy of which could be delivered to patients via topical delivery to the lung, without invasive techniques or surgery. Moreover, a gene complementation approach would directly target the cause of the disease and could correct many aspects of the complex lung pathology. A single therapy to treat the underlying defect could greatly reduce the high therapeutic burden that CF patients currently have to endure. In addition, one therapy might be suitable to treat subjects with a wide variety of mutations, meaning that a single treatment strategy could be relevant to all patients. Proof of principle for both viral and non-viral CFTR gene transfer was quickly established in CF patients [63] and to date, 25 trials have been completed involving approximately 450 CF individuals (see Griesenbach, 2009 [64] ).",

The viral dsDNA genome stably integrates into the genome of transduced cells after its RNA has been reverse transcribed, so expression is likely to last for the lifetime of the cell (approximately 17 months for AECs, [97] ). VSVG-pseudotyped HIV-derived lentivirus carrying the CFTR gene transiently and partially corrected the Cldefect in CF knockout mouse nose for up to 46 days, although pre-treatment with the tight junction opener lysophosphatidylcholine was necessary [98] . There have been attempts to improve the tropism of lentivirus by pseudotyping with envelope glycoproteins from the filoviruses Ebola or Marburg [99] , GP64 of baculovirus [100] , the spike envelope glycoprotein of the SARS virus [101] and the F and HN proteins of SeV [102] . This latter vector, F/HN-SIV, was able to transduce polarised epithelial cells from both the apical and basolateral side and importantly, murine AEC in vivo without the need for pre-conditioning, with gene expression in vivo persisting for at least 17 months, i.e., the lifetime of AECs [97, 103] . This is consistent with gene expression for up to 12 months in mouse nose with GP64-FIV [100] . As with other viruses, it will be important that researchers address the challenge of multiple repeat administrations without loss of efficacy, or find ways of targeting stem cell populations of the airways, to treat the chronic aspects of CF lung diseases.",

The deletion of CpG motifs is one of the latest aspects of plasmid development programmes in the field of CF gene therapy. A common feature of previous trials has been the transient nature of any correction that was measured. Persistence of expression has been improved in preclinical studies by swapping viral promoters such as CMV (cytomegalovirus) for human promoters including UbC (polyubiquitin C) and EF-1\u03b1 (elongation factor 1-\u03b1) [112, 113] . Similarly specificity has been improved in mice using the human cytokeratin (K18) and FOXJ1 promoters which both directed epithelial cell-specific transgene expression in mice [114, 115] .

Following comparison of over 25 different non-viral formulations, concentrated 25 kDa PEI has been selected as a 'Wave 2' product by the UK CFGT Consortium. Additional improvements may also come from the field of integrases, with the recent demonstration that mice treated with integrase-encoding and reporter constructs complexed with PEI expressed the reporter protein longer than those treated with a non-integrase-encoding construct [118] . The only cationic polymers used in clinical trials for CF gene therapy to date have been compacted DNA nanoparticles, which consist of a single molecule of pDNA compacted with a 30-mer lysine polymer covalently linked to polyethylene glycol (PEG) [119] . The advantage of this gene transfer agent is the identification of its receptor for cell uptake, nucleolin [120] and nuclear translocation bypassing the endosomal pathway.

Sumner-Jones et al. ies have attempted to identify modifier genes for different aspects of CF, as reviewed by Collaco and Cutting (2008) [122] . Lead candidates include inflammatory mediators and cytokines [122] , and most recently IFRD1 [123] , as well as gene polymorphisms that affect the response to bacterial infection (beta-defensins [124, 125] , 8.1 ancestral MHC haplotype [126] and IL10 [127, 128] ). In a disease such as CF where many factors influence the course of disease, with different clinical parameters to take into account (lung function, bacterial burden, inflammation), the identification of significant modifier genes will require large population studies. Ultimately this could provide new targets for anti-inflammatory drugs or gene silencing by RNAi strategies [129] to ameliorate disease. Indeed it is likely that gene silencing therapies, including shRNA in pDNA constructs, will be evaluated that are not directly based on modifier genes, but on the general pathophysiology of CF. For example, a reduction in the transcription factor nuclear factor kappa B (NF\u03baB), which regulates many proinflammatory cytokines and plays a central role in the exaggerated innate immune response in CF [130] , or the ER-membrane protein BAP31, involved in blocking misfolded \u0394F508 CFTR [131] , may be beneficial.

However as our understanding of the molecular processes in the CF lung deepens with better preclinical models to evaluate them, it is becoming clearer that early and broad intervention will be necessary to prevent the multifaceted defects that accompany CFTR mutations. Pharmacological approaches are heading into clinical trials at a regular pace, with some preclinical studies showing correction of several major defects. Although the challenges of finding a safe and effective formulation permit only slow progress, gene therapy still provides a great opportunity for an 'all-round' therapeutic intervention.",
