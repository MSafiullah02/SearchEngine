From 23 pets, a cat without clinical symptoms showed positive results for SARS-CoV-2 in oropharyngeal swab using three RT-qPCR assays (negative rectal swab). SARS-CoV-2 was not detected in the remaining pets. Our finding suggests that cats may act as asymptomatic dispersers of SARS-CoV-2, although viral transmission from animals to humans seems unlikely.",

Pangolins, snakes, turtles, hamsters or yaks have been considered as potential intermediate hosts before spreading to humans, but this still remains unclear [1] . According to WHO (May 8, 2020) , there is no evidence that dogs and/or cats can disseminate SARS-CoV-2 and act as source of human infection [2] . Nevertheless, in any new or emerging disease and even more if there are 'knowledge gaps' in the epidemiology, to assess the potential for domestic transmission through pets (especially dogs and cats) is relevant [3] . Our aim was to evaluate, at an early stage of COVID-19 pandemic, the state of infection and in consequence the potential role of transmission of SARS-CoV-2 from companion animals (especially dogs and cats) under a one health approach in La Rioja (northern Spain).",

According to our data, a high prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 RT-qPCR positive cats was observed (1/8; 12.5%). To date, the only prevalence data about animals published worldwide are those from Zhang et al. [7] . They found a 14.7% seroprevalence (but no molecular diagnosis) against SARS-CoV-2 in cats in China. To our knowledge, this is the first European case of SARS-CoV2 RNA detection in an asymptomatic cat, and the second reported in the world, after notification of one similar event in dogs in Hong Kong [8] . The rest of SARS-CoV-2 infections in felines worldwide (Belgium, USA, France and Spain) were symptomatic and mainly showed clinical signs of respiratory and/or digestive disease [9, 10, 11, 12, 13] . Probably, all these cases are also the result of contagions from their owners. Based on these results, it is possible that the number of affected cats living with COVID-19 owners is greater than that published to date, since these animals may be asymptomatic and not detected.",

Our finding suggests that cats may act as asymptomatic dispersers of the virus, although the transmission of SARS-CoV-2 from animals to humans seems unlikely [2] . All cases seem to be related with human transmission through symptomatic or asymptomatic COVID-19 infected people taking care of the animals. So far, all positive findings in pets were 'isolated cases' associated with close contact with humans positive for SARS-CoV-2, circumstance already described in the SARS epidemic in 2002-2003, without any epidemiological significance, considering them as dead-end hosts [14] .",
