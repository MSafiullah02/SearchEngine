The target sequences in TMV RNA were found in a complete TMV genome using the well\u2010known leadzyme motif. To design an active leadzyme, we analyzed the sequences of all available TMV strains. Two putative target palindromic CGAGC motifs were found in the genomic strand of TMV (+)ssRNA, and four in the antigenomic (\u2013)ssRNA) strand (Fig. 1A). The structure of the leadzyme target sites was analyzed using RNA\u2010prediction program mfold to select only those TMV RNA sequences for which a single\u2010strand structure was more likely in a probabilistic model [25]. The sequence (416) 5\u2032\u2010GUUCAAGGGACGAGCAUAUGUACAC\u20103\u2032 (440) was predicted not to be involved in the formation of a stable secondary structure and was used in further studies (Fig. 1B). This sequence is present in all TMV strains. The localization of this motif close to the 5\u2032\u2010end of the TMV genome within the replicase\u2010coding sequence (ORF 1) was an additional advantage. The designed catalytic strand of the leadzyme was a 16\u2010nucleotide RNA (5\u2032\u2010ACAUAUGGAGUCCCUU\u20103\u2032), and its binding to the target sequence results in the formation of the leadzyme motif with a five\u2010nucleotide internal loop (Fig. 1C). The activity of the anti\u2010TMV leadzyme was confirmed in vitro by cleavage of 100\u2010nucleotide TMV RNA using the catalytic strand of the leadzyme and Pb2+ (Fig. 2). The cleavage site occurred before the first residue (between C and G) of an internal loop on a target strand and only in the presence of Pb2+.",

The catalytic RNA strand of the leadzyme and Pb2+ were directly delivered (mechanical inoculation) together with TMV to Nicotiana tabacum cv. Xanti\u2010nc, a hypersensitive local lesion host. To evaluate the optimal Pb2+/RNA ratio for efficient TMV inhibition, Nicotiana tabacum leaves were inoculated with mixtures composed of TMV, catalytic RNA and Pb2+ prepared just before inoculation. TMV genomic RNA is enclosed within the protein capsid, and as a result, leadzyme formation and TMV RNA cleavage is possible only within host cells. RNA was applied at four concentrations of 2.5, 5, 12 and 25 \u00b5m combined with 0.5, 1, 5 and 10 \u00b5m Pb2+. At 4\u20135 days postinoculation, the amount of symptoms of infection manifested as local lesions was compared to that in control plants, i.e. inoculated with TMV alone or with TMV in the presence of RNA or Pb2+ at the same concentrations as indicated above. Control assays, with 16\u2010nucleotide catalytic RNA only or Pb2+ applied in the presence of TMV, were performed to demonstrate the specificity of leadzyme cleavage. For each single assay, at least three plants were inoculated with the same mixtures, for both control and experimental assays. The number of local lesions was the basis for rejecting RNA and Pb2+ concentrations at which disease symptoms were observed to a similar extent as in controls. In further experiments, 2.5 \u00b5m catalytic RNA with 1, 5 and 10 \u00b5m Pb2+ were tested. This corresponds to 0.4, 2 and 4 Pb2+/RNA, respectively (Fig. 3A,B). Coinoculation of TMV and 2.5 \u00b5m RNA with 1, 5 and 10 \u00b5m Pb2+ led to a decreased number of a local lesions (\u223c 15) in comparison with control plants (\u223c 80) (Fig. 3A,B). The results of quantitative local lesion assays were confirmed by RT\u2010PCR analysis. They showed a lower level of TMV after treatment with a two\u2010fold excess of Pb2+ over catalytic RNA (Fig. 3C, lane 3), whereas in control leaves infected with virus alone, TMV was detectable (Fig. 3C, lanes 1 and 2).",

To verify the ability of the leadzyme to efficiently inhibit virus during lasting infection, both RNA and Pb2+ were applied together with TMV at time 0 or 2 and 4 h later after the infection of Nicotiana tabacum cv. Xanti\u2010nc. In these experiments, 2.5 \u00b5m RNA and 5 \u00b5m Pb2+ were used (Fig. 4A,B). Control assays were performed with 2.5 \u00b5m RNA and 5 \u00b5m Pb2+ applied separately with TMV (Fig. 4A, columns 3 and 4). We also tested control plants that were uninfected and treated only with TMV (Fig. 4A, columns 1 and 2). Reduced necrosis due to RNA and Pb2+ application was observed in three independent experiments (Fig. 4A,B). The lowest TMV level was observed when RNA, Pb2+ and TMV were inoculated simultaneously (\u223c 15 local lesions), although delayed leadzyme application also resulted in a significant decrease in infection (on average, 25 local lesions). In control plants, the number of local lesions was comparable, ranging from 80 to 110. RT\u2010PCR analysis of total RNA extracted from inoculated leaves confirmed those observations. Decreased TMV RNA expression was observed in leaves treated with RNA and Pb2+, whereas virus expression in control plants was at a high level (Fig. 5A). A reference RT\u2010PCR with \u03b2\u2010actin primers was performed (Fig. 5A). The strongest TMV inhibition by the leadzyme occurred in coinoculation assays, although there was still a strong effect after 2 h and and a weaker effect after 4 h delayed leadzyme application.",

The therapeutic development of catalytic RNAs has faced many problems concerning stability, activity and delivery of RNA into the cells in vivo[1, 28, 30]. In the last few years, much attention has been paid to RNA interference (RNAi), a dsRNA\u2010guided post\u2010transcriptional gene\u2010regulatory silencing mechanism that exists in virtually all eukaryotes. This evolutionarily conserved process is involved in defense against transposones and viruses [31, 32, 33]. However, there are some problems with inhibition of viral infections with RNAi. To escape RNAi\u2010mediated inhibition, viruses evolved a defense strategy to overcome RNA silencing [34]. Many RNAi suppressors have been identified in plant, animal and insect viruses [34]. The best characterized are potyvirus\u2010encoded helper component proteinase HcPro [49, 50], cytomegalovirus\u2010encoded 2b protein [49] and p25 protein identified in potato virus X [51]. An RNAi suppressor has also been found among members of the Tobamovirus genus (including TMV and tomato mosaic virus) [34, 52]. Suppressors are commonly involved in the enhancement of viral pathogenicity and accumulation of the viruses. It has been shown that these factors act at different steps in the RNAi pathway, e.g. prevention of siRNA production, siRNA binding or spread of the silencing signal [34, 52]. Another important but undesirable aspect of the RNAi process is induction of nonspecific effects by siRNAs. At the mRNA level, this is connected with an \u2018off\u2010target effect\u2019 \u2212 nonspecific degradation of transcripts. At the protein level, dsRNA delivery can activate RNA\u2010dependent protein kinase (PKR), 2\u20325\u2032\u2010oligoadenylate synthetase, the interferon response that leads to the cell death [35, 36]. To avoid these negative RNAi effects, we developed a new, efficient approach. It is based on the formation of the leadzyme motif in trans and hydrolysis of target RNA.",

This model system has several advantages. TMV is a highly infectious (+)ssRNA virus. The symptoms of infection can be easily evaluated (local lesions are countable) and observed in a short time period (4\u20135 days). In the TMV genome, we identified the specific cleavage target for a leadzyme. Two conserved CGAGC sequences were found in TMV genomes. The target sequence near the 5\u2032\u2010end located within ORF 1 encoding viral replicase was further analyzed. We designed and synthesized a catalytic 16\u2010nucleotide RNA strand capable of forming a leadzyme with TMV RNA. It consists of a five\u2010nucleotide asymmetric loop surrounded by two dsRNA regions (Fig. 1C). The leadzyme with the internal loop composed of five nucleotides shows a higher rate of hydrolysis (k\nobs = 1.4 \u00d7 10\u22121 min\u22121) when compared to the \u2018classic\u2019 leadzyme with a six\u2010nucleotide internal loop (k\nobs = 0.70 \u00d7 10\u22121 min\u22121) (Fig. 1A) [15]. High activity of the leadzyme with an asymmetric internal loop with five nucleotides was confirmed by structural analysis of mammalian 5S rRNA [16]. The designed leadzyme showed Pb2+\u2010binding capacity and hydrolytic properties (Fig. 2). A 10\u2010fold excess of Pb2+ over RNA (leadzyme catalytic strand) was used. A main 37\u2010nucleotide cleavage product was observed. We also observed some nonspecific degradation products, which are probably due to the chemical lability of Py\u2013Pu phosphodiester bonds and the lack of higher\u2010order structure in short RNAs [37, 38].",

We assume that inhibition of TMV growth in leaves was due to specific cleavage of TMV RNA (at positions 426 and 427 of TMV RNA). This was manifested by the decreased number of local lesions on infected tobacco leaves treated with catalytic RNA and Pb2+. We found 15\u201335 local lesions in examined assays vs. 80\u2013110 in controls. Reliable proof of TMV RNA hydrolysis came from the RT\u2010PCR experiments. A high rate of infection observed in reference plants treated with only RNA or Pb2+ indicates that neither RNA nor Pb2+ alone can account for TMV RNA hydrolysis. The control experiments with tobacco leaves dosed with catalytic RNA and TMV showed high rates of infection (on both the phenotypic and molecular levels), and demonstrated that the exogenous RNA used in this study performs its catalytic function only in the presence of Pb2+. Therefore, the catalytic RNA alone can serve as a noncatalytic negative control. The optimal activity of the leadzyme in vivo was observed during TMV/Pb2+/RNA coinoculation and with a two\u2010fold Pb2+ excess over the catalytic RNA. This conclusion is consistent with crystallographic data on the leadzyme structure obtained at 1.8 \u00c5. The crystal structure shows two Pb2+ bound to the catalytic core. One of the ions participates in structural changes around the cleavage site, and the other binds near the scissile bond [14].",

            "text": "Both macroscopic observation of tobacco leaves and molecular analysis confirmed the effectiveness of exogenously applied ssRNA for specific inhibition of viral expression. Based on the rate of necrotic symptoms, we estimated that around 70% of TMV spreading was stopped (3, 4), so the hydrolytic properties of short ssRNA could be used in antiviral applications. It is surprising that Pb2+ can be used as a leadzyme activator. The toxic effects of lead have been linked to many human disorders. The normal blood levels of lead in humans range from 0.1 to 0.2 \u00b5m, whereas high levels within the range 0.5\u20135 \u00b5m are known to have deleterious effects on the nervous, renal and reproductive systems [39, 40]. There are many aspects of the effect of lead toxicity on a cell level: protein binding [41, 42], nonspecific RNA hydrolysis at high concentrations [43, 44], and specific RNA hydrolysis due to leadzyme motif formation in cis in cellular RNAs [39]. The toxic effects of lead depend on its dose. In our studies, the optimal activity of the leadzyme in vivo in Nicotiana tabacum plants was observed at 5 \u00b5m Pb2+. No other symptoms except necrosis caused by TMV with both 5 \u00b5m Pb2+ and 10 \u00b5m Pb2+ were seen in tobacco leaves in vivo. Moreover, it was shown that low concentrations of \u2018stressors\u2019 such as Pb2+ or other heavy metals can have stimulating effects on the growth [43], photosynthetic oxygen evolution [46, 47] and metabolic activity [48] of plants.",
