Although the licensing of several WNV vaccines for veterinary use provides a proof of concept, similar efforts on the development of an effective vaccine for humans remain still unsuccessful. Increased understanding of biology and pathogenesis of WNV together with recent technological advancements have raised hope that an effective WNV vaccine may be available in the near future. In addition, rapid progress in the structural and functional characterization of WNV and other fl aviviral proteins have provided a solid base for the design and development of several classes of inhibitors as potential WNV therapeutics. Moreover, the therapeutic monoclonal antibodies demonstrate an excellent effi cacy against WNV in animal models and represent a promising class of WNV therapeutics. However, there are some challenges as to the design and development of a safe and effi cient WNV vaccine or therapeutic. In this chapter, we discuss the current approaches, progress, and challenges toward the development of WNV vaccines, therapeutic antibodies, and antiviral drugs.",

            "text": "Although WNV was fi rst discovered in Uganda in 1937, it had been considered as a minor public health concern until its fi rst appearance in the USA in 1999 [ 12 ] . Since then, it has dramatically spread to all the continental states of the USA and became an endemic disease throughout North America within a few years [ 13 -16 ] . In the USA alone, there have been over 40,000 reported cases of WNV between 1999 and 2014, of which ~45 % were classifi ed as neuroinvasive and claimed lives of nearly two thousand people [ 17 ] . However, the actual WNV burden is likely much higher than previously thought because only about 20 % of infected individual develop a clinical WNV disease [ 13 ] . It has been estimated that over three million individuals have been infected with WNV in the USA, of which about 780,000 had a symptomatic disease [ 18 ] . WNV also has potential to develop unusual clinical manifestations [ 19 -21 ] and may involve in renal diseases [ 22 , 23 ] , myasthenia gravis [ 24 ] , and myocarditis [ 25 ] , suggesting that the range and severity of WNV disease may be even worse than previously believed. Importantly, increasing numbers of WNV outbreaks during the last 15 years have been associated with greater number of neuroinvasive cases and a higher rate of fatalities [ 16 , 17 ] . However, no vaccine or antiviral therapeutic is currently available, which limits current treatments to only supportive care measures, such as intravenous fl uids, antipyretics, respiratory support, and prevention of secondary infections. Considering the worldwide distribution of this virus and evidence of its potential to change in pathogenicity and transmission [ 26 -30 ] , there is an urgent need to develop safe and effective antiviral drugs or vaccines against WNV infection [ 31 ] . Intensive research during past decades has made signifi cant progress in the design and development of several treatment and prevention methods for WNV infection (reviewed by [ 32 -34 ] ). Here, we discuss the current approaches and recent progress toward the development of vaccines, therapeutic antibodies, and antiviral drugs against WNV infection in humans.",

The virus contains a single-stranded, capped, and plus-sensed RNA genome of approximately 11 kb in size. The viral genome encodes a polyprotein precursor, which undergoes posttranslational processing by cellular and viral proteases to generate three structural proteins (capsid [C] , premembrane [PrM] , and envelope [E]), and seven non-structural proteins (NS1, NS2A, NS2B, NS3, NS4A, NS4B, and NS5). The structural proteins form virion structure, whereas the non-structural proteins play essential roles in the replication of viral genome, assembly of virion, and viral pathogenesis [ 36 -38 ] . Thus, the structural and non-structural proteins of WNV may be potential targets for developing vaccines and antiviral therapeutics (Table 1 ) .",

Among these structural proteins, E protein mediates crucial roles in binding to cellular receptors, membrane fusion, and entry of WNV into host cells, making it a key target for the development of vaccines, neutralizing antibodies, and entry inhibitors . Crystal structure analysis has confi rmed that E protein folds into three structurally distinct ectodomains (EDs) termed EDI, EDII and EDIII [ 39 -43 ] . Among these, the EDIII consists of the major neutralizing epitopes and is an antigen of choice to elicit production of neutralizing antibodies [ 43 -46 ] . Based on the structural characterization of antifl aviviral monoclonal antibodies from both human and nonhuman primate, it appears that the epitopes of fl aviviral E protein are more complex and diverse than previously thought [ 47 -50 ] . In addition, mapping of B-cell and T-cell epitopes has led to the identifi cation of many immunodominant epitopes in both structural and nonstructural proteins of WNV [ 51 , 52 ] .",

Such enzymatic functions of NS3 and NS5 have received considerable attention as potential targets for antiviral drug development [ 34 , 54 ] . The NS3 protein contains two distinct functional domains. The N-terminal domain of NS3 (184 amino acid residues) has serine protease activity that requires a polypeptide cofactor NS2B for activation [ 54 , 56 , 57 ] . Recent X-ray crystallographic studies have shown that the conformation of \u03b2-loop of NS2B controls the substrate binding by NS2B/NS3 protease [ 58 , 59 ] . In contrast, the C-terminal domain of NS3 functions as an RNA helicase, [ 67 ] . Besides its function in viral replication , NS5 also plays a role in viral pathogenesis by antagonizing host's interferon response [ 28 ] . Other nonstructural proteins NS2A, NS2B, NS4A, and NS4B form the scaffold for the viral replication complex and also have roles in the replication of viral genome and host immune evasion [ 68 -70 ] . Mutations in NS4B protein may attenuate WNV and other fl aviviruses [ 68 , 69 ] . In addition, a recent successful clinical trial of a hepatitis C virus NS5A inhibitor suggests that targeting non-structural proteins may be an ideal strategy to develop therapeutics against other fl aviviruses, including WNV [ 71 ] . 74 -78 ] . In particular, the C-terminal EDIII of E protein that contains critical neutralizing epitopes is the major target for neutralizing antibodies against WNV infection [ 40 , 44 , 78 , 79 ] . In addition to humoral immune response, cell mediated immunity by CD4 + and CD8 + T cells play critical roles in recovery from WNV infections [ 80 -83 ] . Thus, the effi cient generation of vaccineinduced immunity against WNV may also require activating and shaping of multiple effectors of adaptive immune response by early innate signaling pathways [ 84 -86 ] .",

Since the biology of vaccine-induced immunity and principles in vaccine development and testing have been extensively discussed before, we will not discuss these topics here. Immunization of the laboratory animals and subsequent challenge of those animals with a pathogen under controlled conditions is the common method for early evaluation of vaccine effectiveness. Introduction of three mutations responsible for attenuation of JEV (SA14-14-2) in equivalent positions of WNV E gene further attenuated ChimeriVax-WN02. Similarly, DENV4 vaccine candidate (rDEN4\u039430), attenuated through a 30-nucleotide deletion in the 3\u2032 untranslated region (UTR) of the viral genome , was further engineered to express WNV-NY99 prM and E [ 122 , 123 ] . After preclinical evaluation in mice, geese, and monkeys, rDEN4\u039430 showed strong immunogenicity in the clinical trial [ 94 ] . In addition, a chimeric DENV2 vaccine candidate expressing the WNV NY99 prM and E proteins has been shown to protect mice from infection with WNV NY99 strain [ 124 ] . Another recombinant WNV vaccine based on infl uenza vaccine (FLU-NA-DIII) was developed by cloning DIII of WNV E into the N-terminal region of neuraminidase of infl uenza virus. This vaccine candidate induced WNV-specifi c neutralizing IgG and protected mice against lethal WNV infection [ 125 ] . Similarly, a recombinant adenoviral vaccine vector (CAdVax-WNVII) expressing all three structural proteins (C, prM, and E) along with NS1 of WNV induced neutralizing antibodies in mice [ ",

Another veterinary WNV vaccine using killed virus was also licensed by USDA (marketed by Boehringer Ingelheim as Vetera\u2122 WNV). Recently, an inactivated WNV vaccine (WN-VAX) based on WNV NY99 protects mice against lethal WNV infection and exhibits immunogenicity in monkeys [ 128 ] . In addition to WNV NY99, formalin inactivation of WNV IRS98 strain induces neutralizing antibody and protects immunized geese [ 129 ] . As an alternative to traditional formalin-based vaccines, a novel hydrogen peroxide (H 2 O 2 ) inactivation approach has been recently used to produce a wholevirus vaccine against WNV [ 130 , 131 ] . Mice immunized with H 2 O 2 -inactivated WNV vaccine candidate developed high serum neutralizing titers , and offered complete protection of vaccinated mice against lethal WNV challenge [ 130 ] . One of such H 2 O 2 inactivated vaccine (HydroVax-001) has been recently introduced into phase I clinical trial. Although inactivation of virulent WNV virus strain has been successfully achieved by chemical-inactivation method [ 127 , 129 ] , use of a naturally attenuated Kunjin strain of WNV [ 132 , 133 ] , or chemically synthesized virus by cDNA system [ 134 ] as starting material has also been proposed.",

So far, nearly 50 mAbs have been approved for therapeutics by US FDA, including a humanized mAb Synagis (palivizumab) for preventive use against respiratory syncytial virus ( WNV infection induces a potent humoral immune response, which is essential in controlling viremia and limiting WNV dissemination to the CNS [ 72 , 73 ] .

In addition, WNV patients who received antibodies from the WNV seropositive donors recovered from WNV infection [ 167 -171 ]. These studies not only encouraged the efforts toward the development of human or humanized monoclonal antibodies against WNV, but also led to the discovery of several potent monoclonal antibodies that showed effi cient protection of mice and hamsters from WNV infection [ 172 -175 ] . Among these, a humanized anti-WNV mAb (Hu-E16) that binds to a highly conserved epitope in WNV E protein blocks viral fusion and provide post-exposure therapeutic potential [ 172 ] . This antibody is currently being assessed for its potential use as a WNV therapeutic antibody [ 176 ] . The phase I clinical trial showed that another humanized recombinant antibody targeting E protein of WNV (known as MGAWN1) has a good safety and tolerance profi le in healthy humans [ 177 ], however, the phase II trial to assess its effi cacy in WNV infection failed due to poor enrollment of participants. Besides the development of whole antibody, recombinant fusion proteins are also generated from single-chain antibody fragment of the variable region.

Although the role of ADE in WNV disease in unclear, the development of a therapeutic antibody against WNV should address this potential issue. Another limitation of antibody-based therapeutics is high production cost, which limits mAb scalability. Producing therapeutic proteins, including antibodies in plants, may be a promising solution. Feasibility of this approach has been affi rmed by the successful production of anti-WNV monoclonal antibody Hu-E16 in plants ( Nicotiana benthamiana ) (MAb-pE16) [ 180 , 181 ] .

A general overview of a drug development process is outlined in Fig. 2 . Hit-to-lead is an initial stage in a drug discovery, where small molecule hits are screened and further evaluated to identify promising lead compounds with a therapeutic potential. Recent progress in the development of multiple approaches for designing, screening, identifi cation, and validation of hit compound (reviewed by [ 194 -199 ] ) have witnessed growing interests in the fi eld of drug development. Signifi cant progress in structural and functional characterization of both structural and nonstructural proteins of WNV and other fl aviviruses has facilitated identifi cation of therapeutic targets and hit-to-lead screening. For example, characterization of pseudo-atomic structure of mature and immature WNV [ 35 ], atomic resolution structure of WNV and other fl aviviral protein by X-ray crystallography and nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy [ 39 , 41 , 48 , 200 -203 ] , and structural characterization of binding of a neutralizing monoclonal antibody to E protein of WNV [ 48 ] have greatly increased our understanding of both structural and functional aspects of potential therapeutic targets. Two approaches have been commonly used for small molecule inhibitor screening include target-based approach and cell-based approach. For target-based screening, several methods can be applied, including enzyme activity-based screening, fragmentbased screening, affi nity-based screening, structure-based rational [ 197 , 198 , 204 -207 ] . In contrast, cell-based approaches use viral infection and replication -dependent assays to identify inhibitors [ 208 ] . Each of these approaches presents their unique sets of merits and challenges . For instance, it is generally diffi cult to identify a target and also achieve specifi city by cell-based assay because such identifi ed inhibitors may potentially affect multiple steps of viral infection cycles and may target both viral and host proteins. Although inhibitors identifi ed by cell-based assay may prove useful as antiviral drug candidates, these compounds could also act nonspecifi cally; thus further elucidation of their mechanism of action is required. The target-based approaches are highly effi cient in screening process, however, an inhibitor screened by such method may require further modifi cation for effective cellular permeability and validation for its antiviral activity, selectivity and toxicity by using cell-based assays. In the fi nal stages, lead compounds are selected for in vitro and in vivo pharmacokinetic profi ling, including effi cacy, plasma stability (halflife), exposure, bioavailability, and preclinical toxicity before planning a clinical trial.",

Although aprotinin is a potent inhibitor of fl aviviral protease, this compound was withdrawn from the market in 2008 due to safety issues [ 240 ] . To screen and identify small molecule inhibitors of fl avivirus protease, both high throughput screening and structure-based drug designing have been used. These strategies are based on the identifi cation of allosteric inhibitors that target the interface of NS2B-NS3 protease, or the active site of NS3 protease. The former strategy may overcome nonspecifi city of the latter due to the largely conserved active sites of the human and viral serine proteinases. A number of inhibitors for WNV NS2B/NS3 protease have been identifi ed by in silico docking or high-throughput screen using in vitro enzyme activitybased assays [ 34 , 59 , 206 , 241 -249 ] . However, most of these compounds failed to demonstrate potent antiviral activity in cell culture . Although a few compounds identifi ed by these approaches show anti-WNV activity in cell-based assays [ 62 , 206 , 242 ] , none of the inhibitors has progressed beyond the hit optimization stage. Discovery of NS2B/NS3 protease inhibitors has been hampered largely due to the diffi culties in obtaining co-crystal structures of inhibitor-protease complexes. Moreover, because of the weak binding affi nity of NS2B/NS3 active site due to its fl at and charged nature, the design of potent small molecule inhibitors by structurebased method becomes diffi cult [ 53 , 242 , 250 , 251 ] .",

Several short antiviral peptides (13-16 amino acid residuals) that bind to WNV E protein have been identifi ed by screening of a murine brain cDNA phage display library [ 307 ] . One of those peptides (P9) reduces viremia and fatality after WNV infection in mice. P9 can effi ciently penetrate the murine blood-brain barrier , implying that it may have antiviral activity in the CNS [ 307 ] . Similarly, a peptide inhibitor (WN83) targeting domain II of WNV E protein designed by using a physicochemical algorithm approach potently inhibits WNV infectivity [ 308 ] . Another peptide designed to target domain II of DENV E shows antiviral activity against both DENV and WNV [ 308 ] . In addition, a rational drug design approach has been used to identify a peptidomimetic that mimic NS2B/NS3 protease substrate and inhibits its activity. The mechanism proposed for the peptidomimetic is that NS2B/NS3 cleaves between P 1 and P 1 \u2032 in a peptide substrate consisting of P 2 P 1 P 1 \u2032, where P 1 and P 2 are basic amino acids (Arg or Lys) and P1\u2032 is a side-chain amino acid (Gly, Ser, or Ala) [ 56 , 231 ] . Thus, a preferred peptide substrate contains several positively charged amino acids. A common method for screening peptide inhibitors of NS2B/NS3 protease employs a fl uorophore conjugated peptide substrate containing basic amino acids at the P1 and P2 positions. Cleavage of peptide substrate by NS2B/NS3 protease results in a release of fl uorophore and increase of fl uorescence [ 242 , 243 ] . Several peptide inhibitors of NS2B/NS3 protease have been identifi ed against WNV [ 62 , 309 -311 ] . A novel agmatine dipeptide inhibitor with improved inhibitory activity against WNV NS2B/ NS3 has been recently identifi ed [ 309 ] . In addition, a recombinant peptide called retrocyclin-1 (RC-1) has been shown to inhibit NS2B/NS3 protease [ 312 ] . However, most of these peptides showed poor activity in the cell-based assay and has not been tested for their in vivo effi cacy. Thus, all of the peptide inhibitor of NS2B/ NS3 protease that has been identifi ed so far failed at the early development stages. Potential limitations of this approach include poor pharmacokinetic properties due to charged nature of peptide, lack of specifi city, requirement of intravenous delivery, rapid degradation in plasma, and costly production.",

            "text": "So far, many inhibitors targeting host proteins have been developed and tested against WNV and other fl aviviruses, such as HCV. Host cyclophilin, a family of cellular peptidyl-prolyl isomerases, may serve as a component of fl avivirus replication complex and play a role in fl aviviral replication . Targeting this enzyme by cyclosporine inhibits replication of WNV [ 339 ] . Targeting lipid signaling and metabolism by a bioactive lipid signaling modulator 4-hydroxyphenyl retinamide (4-HPR, fenretinide) also inhibits replication of WNV and other fl aviviruses. Similarly, ribavirin and mycophenolic acid target inosine monophosphate dehydrogenase (IMPDH), an enzyme in purine biosynthesis, and thereby inhibit replication of fl aviviruses [ 342 , 343 ] . In addition, NITD-982 and brequinar that block pyrimidine biosynthesis also inhibit replication of broad range of RNA viruses, including WNV and other fl aviviruses [ 353 , 354 ] . Besides blocking viral genome replication, antiviral targeting of other steps, such as virus maturation, assembly, and viral dissemination into brain has also been suggested and tested against WNV. For instance, inhibitors of alpha-glucosidase I and II, enzymes that play a role in processing of N-linked oligosaccharides of the viral glycoproteins, also inhibit WNV and other fl aviviruses [ 205 , 355 ] . Although the mechanism by which WNV enters the brain is still poorly understood, the two potential routes include axonal retrograde transport (ART) from the peripheral nervous system and direct hematogenous diffusion via a breakdown in the blood-choroid plexus barrier [ 356 ] . Nocodazole, a microtubule inhibitor that blocks ART, delays WNV entry into brain [ 357 ] . The 3\u2032 or the 5\u2032 terminal stem-loop in fl aviviral RNA contains essential cis-acting elements and plays important roles in viral replication [ 358 , 359 ] . Interestingly, a range of cellular proteins have been identifi ed to interact with 3\u2032 stem-loop of fl aviviral RNAs [ 352 , 359 -362 ] , suggesting a potential strategy to design inhibitors targeting this virus-host protein interaction.",

Although a number of WNV veterinary vaccines have already been licensed and are in use for years, human vaccine candidates are still in various stages of development and testing. Some therapeutic antibodies that show excellent effi cacy in small animal models and are currently being tested in clinical trials represent a promising class of WNV therapeutic. Recent technological advancement and increased understanding of the biology of WNV and other fl aviviruses along with structural/functional characterization of viral proteins have provided a solid foundation for the development of small molecule inhibitors as future WNV therapeutics . However, efforts for development of an effective drug for prevention or control of WNV infection in human still remain unsuccessful. Some of the reasons include a low incidence of diseases, low commercial interest by pharmaceutical companies, high cost of mass vaccination, and diffi culties with running clinical trials due to unpredictable and sporadic nature of WNV outbreaks [ 363 , 364 ] . Another challenge for developing successful WNV therapeutics is to ensure safety and effi cacy in target populations that mostly include children, elderly, and immune-compromised individuals. Despite all these diffi culties, the quest for development of effective treatment and prevention methods against WNV infection are likely to be facilitated by recent technological advancement and should continue to meet the public health needs.

This novel property has been used to develop several plasmids DNA (pDNA) vectors that after transfection produce singleround infectious particles (SRIPs), which in turn produce virus-like particles (VLP) containing viral surface proteins without viral genome. This strategy has been used to develop several candidate DNA vaccines against fl avivirus by expressing E and prM proteins in a plasmid vector and forming VLPs. Using this approach, several plasmid -DNA constructs were developed as candidate DNA vaccines against WNV.This type of DNA vaccines encode for singleround infectious particles expressing E/prM [ 107 -109 ], a full-length cDNA copy of attenuated WNV Kunjin strain [ 110 ], or ectodomain of E protein [ 111 ]. Cell culture or animal passage used to be conventional methods to develop live-attenuated vaccines . The advents of genetic manipulation techniques make it feasible to introduce targeted mutations into the viral genome and attenuate viruses. Using this approach, a WNV vaccine (RepliVAX WN) developed by an internal deletion of a region in capsid gene [ 112 , 113 ] has been shown to induce neutralizing antibodies and protective immune responses in mice [ 114 ], hamsters [ 108 ], and nonhuman primates [ 109 ]. RepliVAX WN strongly activates B cell population secreting anti-NS1 IgG antibody and induces prolonged activation of memory CD8 + , CD4 + , and NS1 specifi c plasma cells [ 115 ]. Innate immune signaling pathways, such as TLR3 and MyD88-dependent signaling pathway are involved in strong activation of B cell response, development of germinal center, generation of long-lived plasma cells, and production of antibodies following immunization with RelpiVax WN vaccine [ 116 ]. In addition, another live attenuated WNV vaccine developed by generating mutations in glycosylation sites of E and NS1 proteins induces neutralizing antibodies and protective immune responses in mice [ 117 ]. Similarly, approaches of introduction of mutations in NS4B [ 69 ], NS2A [ 36 ], or E gene that were previously characterized to attenuate JEV-SA-14142 [ 118 ] have also been used to develop attenuated WNV vaccine candidates. Using this approach, a recombinant live attenuated WNV vaccine for veterinary use was developed and licensed in 2004 by Merial (RecombiTEK). This vaccine expresses WNV prM and E proteins in a canarypox virus backbone [ 119 , 120 ]. Using a similar approach, a chimeric vaccine (ChimeriVax-WN02) has been developed by replacing prM and E genes in YFV vaccine strain (YFV-17D) with WNV-NY99 prM and E genes [ 91 , 121 ]. ChimeriVax-WN02 was the fi rst recombinant WNV vaccine candidate tested in clinical trial.",
