Underneath Dr. Li meekly wrote: \u201cYes, I do\u201d. Li returned to work, later contracted the virus from an asymptomatic, infected patient with acute angle-closure glaucoma, manifested disease symptoms on January 10, 2020, and succumbed to the disease on February 7.[1] Li is considered one of the prime whistleblowers of what is now identified as highly infectious disease COVID-19, caused by a new variant of coronavirus 2019-nCoV. He is also the unfortunate first known case of a patient-to-ophthalmologist transmission of the new strain of coronavirus.",

Two weeks later, a new coronavirus, identified through genomic sequencing, was declared to be the culprit.[3] But by then, the horse had already bolted from the stable\u2014before the affected cities were locked down, some of the asymptomatic, infected patients from Wuhan had already begun their travel ahead of the Chinese Lunar New Year, (which is said to be the largest human migration in the world with 3 billion passenger-journeys), thus, spreading the virus far and wide. On January 30, 2020, the WHO declared COVID-19 to be a Public Health Emergency of International Concern and declared it as an epidemic.[4] As on January 21, 2020, there were 282 cases reported from four countries (China, Japan, Republic of Korea, and Thailand), and by March 16, 2020, it has affected 169,610 patients across 157 countries causing 6,518 deaths [Fig. 1].[4] The disease has now been declared a pandemic by the WHO.[4] The disease epicenter has shifted to Europe, with Italy contributing to highest number of cases outside China.[4]",

            "text": "India reported the first case of COVID-19 on January 30, 2020, in the southern coastal state of Kerala in a student who had a travel history to Wuhan, China, followed by two more similar cases on February 2nd and 3rd. Nearly a month later on March 2, 2020, two new cases were reported\u2014one each in New Delhi and Hyderabad. Subsequently, there has been a sharp spurt, with a large group of tourists from Italy and their local contacts and a family with an undisclosed travel history to Italy and some of their contacts having been reported positive, taking the number of cases to 110 across 14 states and Union Territories by March 16 [Fig. 2]. To contain the spread of the disease, the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare (MOHFW) in India has released a travel advisory prohibiting travel from and to China, the Republic of Korea, Islamic Republic of Iran, Japan, Italy, France, Spain and Germany.[5] Those having a travel history from these countries are likely to be quarantined for 14 days.[5] All tourist visas stand suspended until April 15.[5] An intensive awareness campaign has been rolled out, and guidelines for surveillance, contact tracing, quarantine, diagnosis, laboratory tests, and management have been laid down.[5] Routine personal hygiene measures suggested by MOHFW include frequent handwashing with soap and water or use of an alcohol-based hand sanitizer, respiratory etiquette (cover the mouth with tissue while coughing and sneezing with safe disposal), avoiding touching eyes, nose, or mouth, avoiding close contact with people who are unwell or showing symptoms of illness with fever, cough, breathlessness, etc.[5] MOHFW also suggests the use of N95 masks if respiratory symptoms such as cough, fever, or difficulty in breathing, etc., are present.[5] The suggestion is also not to travel to farms, live animal markets, or where animals are slaughtered and avoid mass gathering.[5] Potential challenges in containing the infection in India include suboptimal primary health care facilities, dense population, hesitation in voluntary reporting, delayed reporting, difficulty in implementing quarantine, and difficulty in contact tracing. Lockdown, as implemented in China and Italy, seem to be effective. It is, however, challenging to implement lockdown in India, although Kerala has implemented partial lockdown due to a sudden surge in cases. China has seen a decline in a number of cases recently in the Hubei Province as well as in other parts, possibly due to effective lockdowns. Another possible explanation is that the spread of the virus might have peaked and the transmission is slowing down. The effect of increased temperature on virus survival is not clear at this point in time.[4]",

A small subset of patients may have gastrointestinal symptoms.[9] Although most cases appear to be mild, all admitted in the hospitals have pneumonia with infiltrates on chest X-ray and computed tomography scans show patchy shadows or ground-glass opacities in the lungs.[9] About a third of patients, more likely those with comorbidities, develop acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS).[9] The mortality rate reported is 2%, mostly due to ARDS, acute kidney injury, myocardial injury, and septic shock.[9] The mortality rate has been recently revised to be >3%.[2] Real-time estimation of mortality rate with two statistical models has been estimated to be 5.3\u20138.4%.[10] However, as compared to the other two zoonotic coronavirus infections that have occurred in the last 20 years (SARS and MERS), COVID-19 seems to have higher infectivity but a lower mortality rate.[11] The median age of the patients is reported to be between 49 and 56 years and cases in children have been rare.[12]",

Hence, the proximity between ophthalmologists and patients during the slit-lamp examination and most of the ophthalmic evaluation and treatment procedures (which is much within the range of aerosol transmission) may pose a direct risk. As an ophthalmic consultation involves multiple investigations, the patients are likely to stay for a longer duration in the hospital, thus, increasing the risk of cross-infection to other patients as well as to health care workers (HCWs). The risk is higher with unsuspected asymptomatic patients with subclinical infections.[21] Hence, the American Academy of Ophthalmology (AAO) has issued an alert to ophthalmologists to wear masks for mouth, nose, and eye protection when seeing patients with conjunctivitis with respiratory symptoms and a history of international travel.[22] While tear samples of COVID-19 cases with conjunctivitis have been documented to carry the virus, the presence of 2019-nCoV in tears of affected individuals without ocular symptoms cannot also be ruled out.[322]",
