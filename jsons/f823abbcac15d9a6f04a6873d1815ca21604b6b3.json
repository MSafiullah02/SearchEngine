I was personally well acquainted with the fourth to sixth Chairs, having learned the science of epidemiology from Abraham Lilienfeld, worked closely with faculty on research and teaching in the Department for decades under the direction of Leon Gordis, and then served as Deputy Chair under Jonathan Samet from 2005 to 2008. Each Chair served within the context of the day, whether it was the diseases affecting the population (e.g., the influenza pandemic), the new tools that became available (real-time polymerase chain reaction, whole genome sequencing), or opportunities that arose for new collaborations. Chairs can lead, delegate, find consensus, or even follow their faculty. Each of the Chairs of the Department has left their mark on the Department in different ways. In this review, I highlight what I consider to be the major contributions of each Chair to the Department and to the discipline (see Figure 1 ).",

Welch studied medicine at the Columbia University College of Physicians and Surgeons in New York. Welch next studied bacteriology in Germany and became one of the premier scientists in that field in the United States. He was recruited to Johns Hopkins in 1885, where he served as Chair of the Department of Pathology. He later was named Dean of the School of Medicine and then interim President of the University. Welch was the guiding force behind the establishment of the School along the lines of the German model of \"institutes of hygiene.\" His focus on an \"institute\" suggested the primacy of research over teaching; similarly, he preferred the term \"hygiene\" over \"public health.\" This approach married Kenneth F. Maxcy (1938 Maxcy ( -1954 Philip E. Sartwell (1954 Sartwell ( -1970 Abraham M.

On June 12, 1916 , the Rockefeller Foundation awarded $267,000 to the Johns Hopkins University to establish the School of Hygiene and Public Health, the first such institution in the United States. This somewhat gangly name was a compromise between those advocating a School of Public Health aligned with the English model and an \"institute of hygiene\" based on the German model (1) . The inaugural class consisted of 8 students, admitted in October 1918. Welch, along with his colleague W. H. Howell, founded the American Journal of Hygiene in 1920, which was renamed the American Journal of Epidemiology in 1965 and remains in publication to this day (volume 183 is currently in press), produced by the Department of Epidemiology in conjunction with Oxford University Press.",

After talking over his options on how he might best assist the development of the public health field with Rupert Blue, Surgeon General of the USPHS, Frost was assigned to Baltimore \"on loan\" to the Johns Hopkins University. Frost served as the inaugural chair of epidemiology, appointed as Senior Lecturer in the fall of 1919 and then Professor in 1921. Frost resigned his commission in the USPHS in 1929 (retaining a reserve commission) to devote all of his efforts to the School and the development of epidemiology as a discipline at Johns Hopkins (2).",

He developed many of the methods commonly used in observational epidemiology and the statistical techniques that remain in use today. The body of his work included the ravages of the day-typhoid fever, tuberculosis, influenza, and poliomyelitis. His plan of instruction in \"the natural history of infectious diseases\" included 20-30 lectures outlining principles and field methods, replete with examples, student group laboratory exercises based on manipulating real data using statistical methods linked to epidemiologic principles, a focus on student fieldwork in real-life conditions, critical reviews of the literature, and a thesis project to be conducted by the student under the direction of a faculty member (2) . This vision of doctoral education in the discipline of epidemiology emerged from Frost's experiences of practicing epidemiology while in the USPHS. While the breadth of lectures has grown in number today and the methods greatly expanded, Frost's approach to epidemiology education should be very recognizable to today's faculty and students.",

The Washington County Health Demonstration was founded in 1921 jointly between the School, the Maryland State Health Department, the USPHS, the Rockefeller Foundation, and the Security Cement and Lime Company of Hagerstown. Access for students was difficult, however, due to the distance and the lack of transportation between Baltimore and Hagerstown. As a result, most students attended for only a week's time. This was grossly insufficient for learning how to apply epidemiologic methods in the field. Alternatively, the urban training site, the Eastern Health District, located just blocks from the School, which was financially supported by the Rockefeller Foundation and the USPHS, was geographically positioned to ensure participation by students and eminently successful in providing field training opportunities. While the distance to Hagerstown from Baltimore is now less of a problem, transportation issues continue to hamper our students' ability to take full advantage of this training site.",

As Abe Lilienfeld (the fourth Chair of the department) noted in 1973 (6), his insights into epidemiologic methods were manifold, and his contribution to understanding the epidemiology of infectious diseases was without parallel in his time. While he had a relatively short academic career, his impact on the discipline of epidemiology was immense and has been noted by many historians of public health (1, 2) . (1). The numbers of students and the curriculum slowly grew over time.",

He was Scientific Director of the International Health Division of the Rockefeller Foundation, the American Red Cross, and the Armed Forces Epidemiological Board. In the 1940s he was the recipient of a national award from the National Foundation for Infantile Paralysis to establish the first poliomyelitis laboratory. His work established that polio transmission occurred person-to-person rather than via any suggested vectors (most notably water). One of his gargantuan efforts was editing the fifth edition of Rosenau's Preventive Medicine and Hygiene in 1949 (7); this was the premier textbook in public health and the source of most contemporary epidemiologic methods. Upon his retirement (in 1954) he became Professor Emeritus, a position he held until his death from Parkinson's disease in 1966. As Wood and Wood concluded in their brief biography, \"his epidemiological predictions regarding this disease (murine typhus) were, in many ways, just as remarkable as the classic studies of John Snow on cholera and the Broad Street pump\" (8, p. 166).",

Sartwell is perhaps best known for his seminal 1950 paper entitled, \"The distribution of incuba-tion periods of infectious disease,\" published in the American Journal of Hygiene (10) . He demonstrated that the incubation periods of many infectious diseases show a consistent pattern, using 3 types of observations: known single simultaneousexposure epidemics; known but not simultaneous-exposure epidemics; and unknown outbreaks in which the epidemiologic curve might suggest simultaneous exposure. He originated the use of logarithmic plots of the incubation period and defined the \"estimated median,\" and he showed that the frequency curve of incubation times took the form of a lognormal curve (11) . These observations underlie contemporary knowledge of epidemic theory. We now understand that epidemic curves and incubation periods are quite systematic, whether for infectious diseases or chronic diseases. Sartwell's insights demonstrated a continuing fascination with disease dynamics that have their origins in Frost's and Maxcy's work some 30 years before, and which remain in vogue in contemporary infectious disease modeling efforts. Expanding Sartwell's work on the incubation period, with his student Haroutune Armenian, Lilienfeld showed (12) that the distribution of nontransmissible diseases after common exposures to environmental risk factors also followed a lognormal distribution, with examples including exposure to the atomic bomb and bladder cancer, exposure to dye and the risk of leukemia, etc. After he resigned from the chairmanship due to health problems, he remained actively engaged in research, teaching, and academic administration, serving as Acting Chair of the Department of Behavioral Sciences from 1983 until his death in 1984.",

He set a standard for teaching in the early 1970s, when he was viewed as a teacher's teacher. His 1976 text, Foundations of Epidemiology (13), published by Oxford University Press, was used for decades in many introductory epidemiology courses and was the first comprehensive treatise on the conceptual framework and methods of epidemiology. He was the author of 6 additional textbooks on research methods, cancer epidemiology, developmental disability, and genetic issues in public health. His scientific publications (14) , numbering 155 peer-reviewed publications in a foreshortened career, covered the interpretation of screening tests, cerebral palsy and other congenital malformations, epilepsy and maternal risk factors, cancer (breast, cervical, urinary bladder, lung, skin, stomach), and cardiovascular diseases, among others. The range of his interests and his focus on the development of methods for incorporating epidemiologic investigations into causal thinking and drawing inferences about how risk factors lead to unequal distributions of disease in populations were hallmarks of his contributions to the discipline. . Thus, he personally instructed generations of public health and medical students at Johns Hopkins in the discipline of epidemiology, with considerable wit and humor. Indeed, he probably won more \"Golden Apples\" for teaching excellence from students than any other faculty member in the School, being so honored at each point of eligibility.",

A pediatrician and bacteriologist trained at Johns Hopkins, Maxcy focused on public health despite its \"limited income, insecurity of tenure, administrative burden, and lack of prestige\"! (1, p. 164). At the end of World War I, where he served as a Captain in the US Army Medical Corps, he enrolled in the School of Hygiene and Public Health as a Rockefeller Fellow, and he received his doctorate in 1921. He received mentoring and lifelong support from Wade Hampton Frost. His first position was establishing the Public Health Laboratory for the state of Kansas, with financial support from the Rockefeller Foundation. He joined the USPHS for a period of 8 years, attaining the rank of Surgeon, where he investigated malaria in the South (1). Maxcy was renowned for his work in rickettsial infections in the southeastern United States, most notably the epidemiologic, clinical, and laboratory study of typhus infection. He identified rodents as the natural reservoir of the disease, with transmission to humans via insect parasites. He then was assigned to the Hygienic Laboratory in Washington, DC, the precursor of the National Institutes of Health. At the urging of Wade Hampton Frost, Maxcy left the USPHS in 1929 to accept a Professorship at the University of Virginia. In 1936 he accepted a post at the University of Minnesota as Professor of Public Health and Preventive Medicine, but his tenure was brief, as he returned to Johns Hopkins as a professor of bacteriology and briefly oversaw the Department of Bacteriology upon the death of William W. Ford, the Chair. He then shifted to the Department of Epidemiology in 1938 upon Frost's demise. At Johns Hopkins, Maxcy continued to build the Department, adding faculty and forming links with other departments in the School",

He focused on the new polio vaccine in the 1950s, vaccinating and evaluating vaccine efficacy among children attending the Baltimore City public schools. With the advent of the Asian flu epidemic of 1957, he investigated vaccine effectiveness and concluded that the vaccine was partially effective. In 1958, predating the Surgeon General's Report on Tobacco and Health (released in 1964), he wrote to the Baltimore Sun about the dangers of tobacco smoking with regard to health. In the mid-1960s, to great national attention, he pointed out the association between combined oral contraceptive use and vascular problems in women. These 2 examples clearly demonstrate his vision of the changing landscape of epidemiology and its new focus on manmade risk factors for chronic disease.",

He received his M.P.H. in 1972 and his Dr.P.H. degree in 1974 from the Department of Epidemiology in the School of Hygiene and Public Health at Hopkins. He then joined the epidemiology faculty of the School of Public Health at the American University of Beirut as Assistant Professor, and was later promoted to Associate Professor in 1979. He served as Acting Dean of that school from 1981 to 1983, and was formally appointed Dean from 1983 to 1988 and Professor in 1984. Armenian returned to Johns Hopkins in 1988, where he was appointed Professor of Epidemiology and Deputy Chair of the Department from 1988 to 1993 under Leon Gordis. He taught generations of epidemiologists the case-control method. He is the author of the well-regarded text The Case-Control Method: Design and Applications (16) and coedited with Sam Shapiro Epidemiology and Health Services (17), both published by Oxford University Press. Armenian was a prolific author on epidemiologic methods ( particularly the use of parish and other official records), on the epidemiologic impacts of civil conflict and natural disasters, and on a variety of noncommunicable diseases (cardiovascular, cancer, diabetes, etc.). He was Editor-in-Chief of Epidemiologic Reviews from 1989 to 2002. Armenian resigned from his position in 2008 and became Professor in Residence in the Department of Epidemiology at the University of California, Los Angeles. In addition, he served as President of the American University of Armenia from 1997 to 2010. Jonathan M. Samet (1946-), a Virginia native, became the sixth Chair of the Department of Epidemiology in 1994, following an international search. He completed his A.B. at Harvard College in 1966 and received his M.D. in 1970 from the University of Rochester School of Medicine and Dentistry. He was an intern in medicine at the University of Kentucky Medical Center in Lexington (1970-1971) and did his residency in medicine at the University of New Mexico Affiliated Hospitals in Albuquerque (1973-1975), specializing in pulmonary medicine. He then pursued a Research Fellowship in Clinical Epidemiology at the Channing Laboratory at Harvard Medical School (1975-1978), and he received an M.S. degree in epidemiology from the Harvard School of Public Health in 1977. He joined the University of New Mexico as Assistant Professor of Medicine in 1978, was promoted to Associate Professor in 1982, and was made Professor of Medicine in 1986, when he was appointed Chief of the Pulmonary Division. Samet was recruited to Johns Hopkins in 1994 and named Professor and Chair of Epidemiology. He was granted a joint appointment in the departments of Medicine and Oncology at the School of Medicine. During his tenure at Johns Hopkins, he was the founding director of the Institute for Global Tobacco Control and the founding codirector of the Risk Sciences and Public Policy Institute.",

Advanced epidemiologic methods, examples, and principles are now covered in much greater depth. This new course sequence truly updated the teaching of epidemiology at Johns Hopkins and is now refined annually. In August 2008, Dr. Samet accepted the positions of Professor and Flora L. Thornton Chair of the Department of Preventive Medicine at the Keck School of Medicine, University of Southern California, and Director of the USC Institute for Global Health. David D. Celentano (1951-) served as Acting Chair of the Department of Epidemiology from 2008 to 2009 upon Jon Samet's departure and was appointed the seventh chair of the Department of Epidemiology in September 2009, following an international search. Celentano is the first nonphysician to lead the Department, in some ways reflecting changes in the discipline over time. He is a product of Johns Hopkins educationhis B.A. (1972) was in physiological psychology and his M.H.S. (1975) in mental hygiene, and his Sc.D. degree (1977) was received from the Department of Behavioral Sciences. His dissertation addressed epidemiologic methods for estimating the prevalence of alcoholism in the community. The research was conducted under the direction of Professor George W. Comstock, director of the Training Center for Public Health Research in Hagerstown from 1962 until his death in 1997. Celentano joined the faculty of the Department of Behavioral Sciences in 1978 but taught epidemiology with Dr. Comstock for many years.",
