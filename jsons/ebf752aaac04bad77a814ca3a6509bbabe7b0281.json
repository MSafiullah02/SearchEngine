Numerous efficient methods have been developed for sequence comparison, but challenges remain. In this article, we proposed a novel method to compare biological sequences based on Gaussian model. Instead of comparing the frequencies of k-words in biological sequences directly, we considered the k-word frequency distribution under Gaussian model which gives the different expression levels of k-words.

The search for optimal solutions using alignment-based method encounters difficulties in: (i) computational load with regard to large databases; 12 (ii) choosing the scoring schemes. 27 Because of the critical limitations of alignment method, the emergence of research into alignment-free methods is apparent and necessary. Many alignment-free methods have been proposed, but they are still in the early development compared with alignment-based method. Comparison methods based on k-word frequencies may be the most well-developed alignment-free methods. Reinert et al. 26 studied the statistical and probabilistic properties of words in sequences, with emphasis on the deductions of exact distributions and evaluation of its asymptotic approximations. Word-based methods were recently reviewed by Vinga and Almeida. 27 Among these word-based methods, each sequence is mapped into an n-dimensional vector according to its k-word frequencies. The similarity score between sequences represented in vector spaces is further defined by Euclidean distance, 28 Mahalanobis distance, 29 Kullback-Leibler discrepancy, 30 Cosine distance 31 between their corresponding vectors. Recently, several novel word-based methods have been designed for sequence comparison, such as D2z( 32 ), Gdis.k, 33 D 2 and D 3 . 34 This work presents a novel method for biological sequence comparison based on Gaussian model.

A k-word is a series of k consecutive letters in a sequence. The k-word statistical analysis consists of counting occurrences of k-words in a given sequence. For a sequence s, the count of a k-word w, denoted by c(w), is the number of occurrence of w in the sequence s. The standard approach for counting k-words in a sequence of length m is to use a sliding window of length k, shifting the frame one base at a time from position 1 to m\u2212k+1.

For example, the 3-word frequency histogram of HSLIPAS (Human mRNA for lipoprotein lipase) sequence appears in Figure 1 . The most important things to look at are the symmetry and peak of the curve.

Kolmogorov-Smirnov test is a goodness-of-fit test for any statistical distribution. The test relies on the fact that the value of the sample cumulative density function is asymptotically normally distributed. To apply the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test, the main operations are as follows: (1) calculate the cumulative frequency (normalized by the sample size) of the observations as a function of class; (2) calculate the cumulative frequency for a true distribution (most commonly, the Gaussian distribution); (3) find the greatest discrepancy between the observed and expected cumulative frequencies, which is called the \"D-statistic.\" The Kolmogorov-Smirnov statistic (D) is defined as", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Test for Normality of k-word Frequencies"}, {"text": "where F(x) is a given cumulative distribution function, and F n (x) is a empirical distribution function for n iid observations X i , which is defined as . . , f (w k,n ) with some unknown distribution P and we would like to test the hypothesis that P is equal to a Gaussian distribution P 0 , i.e., decide between the following hypotheses:", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Test for Normality of k-word Frequencies"}, {"text": "The p value obtained by Kolmogorov-Smirnov test tells us whether the data is significantly different from the Gaussian distribution or not. We reject the hypothesis if the test is significant at the 0.05 level. That is to say, if p < 0.05, we reject H 0 , do not reject H 0 otherwise. We also take the 3-word frequencies of HSLIPAS sequence for example and perform Kolmogorov-Smirnov test. Since the p-value is 0.63857, we accept H 0 . In addition, the way Kolmogorov-Smirnov test work is by generating a normal probability plot, 35 it is a graphical technique for assessing whether or not a data set is approximately normally distributed. Figure 2 is the normal probability plot of 3word frequencies of HSLIPAS sequence. The straight line on Figure  2 is the null hypothesis of normality, the points on this plot form a nearly linear pattern, which indicates that the Gaussian distribution is a good model for the 3-word frequencies of HSLIPAS sequence. It is worthwhile pointing out that Kolmogorov-Smirnov test is designed to test a simple hypothesis P = P 0 for a given normal distribution P 0 . But, if we estimated this distribution, N(\u03bc,\u03c3 2 ) from the data f (w k,1 ), f (w k,2 ), . . . , f (w k,n ), formally, Kolmogorov-Smirnov test is inaccurate in this case. There is a version of Kolmogorov-Smirnov test, called Lilliefors test, 36 that tests normality of the distribution by comparing the data with a fitted Gaussian distribution as we did above, but with a correction to give a more accurate approximation of the distribution of the test statistic. The test proceeds as follows: (1) estimate the population mean and population variance based on the data; (2) find the maximum discrepancy between the empirical distribution function and the cumulative distribution function (CDF) of the normal distribution with the estimated mean and estimated variance, just as in the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test, this will be the test statistic; (3) confront the question of whether the maximum discrepancy is large enough to be statistically significant, thus requiring rejection of the null hypothesis. We also take the 3word frequencies of HSLIPAS sequence for example and perform Lilliefors test. First, we estimate the population mean\u03bc = 0.0156 and population variance\u03c3 2 = 0.0066 based on the 3-word frequencies of HSLIPAS sequence. Then, we perform Lilliefors test that the 3-word frequencies of HSLIPAS sequence comes from the distribution N(0.0156, 0.0066).

The name, accession number, abbreviation, and genome length for the 24 genomes are listed in Table 3 . Given a set of biological sequences, their phylogenetic tree can be obtained through the following main operations: firstly, we construct the Gaussian model for biological sequences; secondly, we calculate their similarity degree by using our measure d Nor . Thirdly, by arranging all the similarity degree into a matrix, we obtain a pair-wise distance matrix. Finally, we put the pair-wise distance matrix into the neighbor-joining program in the PHYLIP package. 47 We obtain the phylogenetic relationships drawn by MEGA program (9) . In Figure 6 , we present the unrooted phylogenetic tree belonging to 24 species. Figure 6 shows that our results are quite consistent with the accepted taxonomy and authoritative ones [42] [43] [44] [45] in the following four aspects. First, all SARS-CoVs are grouped in a separate branch, which appear different from the other three groups of coronaviruses. Secondly, BCOV, BCOVL, BCOVM, BCOVQ, MHV, MHV2, MHVM, and MHVP are grouped into a branch, which is consonant with that they belong to group II. Thirdly, HCoV-229E, TGEV, and PEDV are closely related to each other, which is consistent with the fact that they belong to group I. 28 Finally, IBV forms a distinct branch within the genus Coronavirus, because it belongs to group III. Grigoriev 43 found that the mutational patterns in SARS-CoV genome were strikingly different from the other coronaviruses in terms of mutation rates. Phylogenetic analysis based on codon usage pattern suggested that SARS-CoV was diverged far from all the three known groups of coronavirus. 44 Rota et al. 42 found out that the overall level of similarity between SARS-CoVs and the other coronaviruses is low.

Despite the prevalence of alignment-based methods, it is noteworthy that alignment-based method is computationally intensive and consequently unpractical for querying large data sets, which forces the use of some heuristics to reduce the running times, as exemplified by BLAST. Alignmentfree comparison method is therefore of great value as it reduces the technical constraints of alignments. A novel alignment-free method for sequence comparison is proposed in this work. We assume that the frequencies of a given k-word in a biological sequence follows the Gaussian distribution. The similarity between two sequences can be evaluated by the difference between their corresponding Gaussian models. In contrast to the traditional word-based methods based on frequencies of fixed k-words, our method takes distribution information of k-word frequencies into account. In other words, our method has the ability to adjust the background information for similarity measure using k-word frequencies. The test of our methods are to perform similarity search and evaluate the functionally related genes. To evaluate this method, we compare it with alignment-based or word-based methods. The comparison demonstrates that our method, intending to explore kword frequency distribution information, gives more competitive results (Tables 1 and 2 ).
