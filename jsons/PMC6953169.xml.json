Pathogenic treponemes cause multi-stage infections like endemic syphilis, venereal syphilis, yaws and pinta. These infections have many similarities, but they can be differentiated based on epidemiological, clinical and geographical criteria [1\u20133]. Primarily, the pathogenic treponemes can be classified based on the clinical symptoms of the respective disease they cause. Treponema pallidum subsp. endemicum causes endemic syphilis; T. pallidum subsp. pallidum causes venereal syphilis; T. pallidum subsp. pertenue causes yaws; and T. pallidum subsp. carateum causes pinta. Out of these four high morbidity diseases, venereal syphilis is only transmitted by sexual contact; the other three diseases are transmitted by close personal contact [2].",

            "text": "It is estimated by the World Health Organization (WHO) that there are 12 million new cases of syphilis annually and the aggregated cases of yaws, bejel, and pinta (the endemic treponematoses) are approximately 2.5 million globally, although good surveillance data is not available. The infections caused by T. pallidum are characterized by periods of active clinical disease interrupted by episodes of asymptomatic latent infection and may cause life-long infections in untreated individuals [4, 5]. Treponema pallidum is a Gram-negative, motile, spirochete human pathogen. Syphilis is a multistage infectious disease that can be communicated between sexual partners through active lesions or from an infected woman to her fetus during pregnancy [6, 7]. Syphilis has a worldwide distribution (e.g. Africa has a high incidence), affecting every country and continent except perhaps Antarctica [8\u201312]. The stages of syphilis have been divided on the basis of clinical findings that lead to treatment and follow-up. Syphilis chancres may go unnoticed primarily due to their well-documented painless nature and if they are present in those parts of the body that are difficult to visualize (e.g. cervix, throat or anus/rectum) [13]. Furthermore, due to pleomorphic appearance and lack of physician familiarity with the expressions of syphilis, their lesions may be misdiagnosed. Secondary, syphilis may manifest itself through severe rashes that may go unobserved by the patient or may mimic an extensive condition [8]. T. pallidum is completely sensitive to penicillin treatment, despite the use of this antibiotic for seven decades in treating syphilis infections. Standard treatment of uncomplicated syphilis with parenteral Benzathine penicillin G is highly effective at all stages. Many antibiotics\u2019 resistance (e.g Macrolide and Clindamycin resistance) has been reported in several countries [6]. The ongoing high rate of syphilis worldwide, despite the availability of inexpensive and effective treatment, presents the most convincing argument for the need of developing new and potent vaccine against syphilis [14]. Despite the WHO\u2019s Initiative for the Global Elimination of Congenital Syphilis, an intensive syphilis-targeted public health control has been undertaken to reduce the incidence; however, it has not been achieved yet [14]. Specifically, the reasons for failure are multifactorial; some of the responsibility can be attributed to the difficulty in the diagnosis of syphilis and treatment, and lack of access or use of prenatal screening programs [15]. The advancement in the field of genomics and cost-effective sequencing technologies has transformed the human bacterial pathogens study and helped in the improvement of vaccine designing technologies. A new and emerging methodology to get deep insight of the genome of a species or genus is the pan-genomics approach, which was introduced by Tettelin and collaborators in 2005 working with Streptococcus agalactiae [16]. Pan-genome provides us with the complete and non-redundant collection of genes from a species or genus and is composed of three subsets (core genome, shared genome and singletons): the core genome, which is the collection of all the genes commonly shared between all the genomes used as dataset; the shared genome, which contains only the genes shared between two or more strains, which are not present in all strains of the dataset; and, the singletons, which are present only in one strain and are referred to as strain-specific genes.",

The organism has a comparatively small genome and only 55% of T. pallidum\u2019s 1041 open reading frames are recognized to have a biological function, which indicates that it uses host biosynthesis to complete some of its metabolic needs [3]. The DNA-DNA hybridization studies showed homology between DNA of venereal syphilis spirochete and DNA of culturable treponemes (T. phagedenis and its biotypes Reiter and Kazan) was less than 5% identical, but was indistinguishable from DNA of the yaws spirochete T. pallidum [3, 17, 18]. This study led to the reclassification of the agents of endemic syphilis, venereal syphilis and yaws as T. pallidum subsp. endemicum, Treponema pallidum subsp. pallidum and T. pallidum subsp. pertenue, respectively. Genomic sequencing has recognized these subspecies as clonal, but forming distinct genetic clusters [2, 3].",

The subspecies responsible for non-venereal syphilis is Treponema pallidum subsp. endemicum (TEN) and T. pallidum subsp. pertenue (TPE) strains appeared in closely related clusters (Fig. 1). The T. pallidum subspecies strains responsible for venereal syphilis formed different clusters. Additionally, T. pallidum strain BosniaA (subsp. endemicum) was positioned between the clusters of Treponema pallidum subsp. Pertenue and venereal syphilis (Treponema pallidum subsp. pallidum). According to the heatmap, the non-venereal isolates are 100% similar to each other and many of the venereal isolates are 100% similar to each other, but the two groups show some difference (Additional file 1: Figure S2).

However, it may only be the effect of relaxation of purifying selection genes involved in increasing the range of environmental responses. Interspecies genome plasticity may result from several events, of which horizontal gene transfer is particularly important because it can cause the acquisition of blocks of genes (genomic islands, or GIs), producing evolution by quantum leaps [23]. These genes are often flanked by transposases (insertion elements), have altered G + C content and skew, suggesting their acquisition through Horizontal Gene Transfer (HGT), intermediated by phages or recombination [22]. PAIs are important in this context because they represent a class of GIs that carry virulence genes, i.e., factors that enable or enhance the parasitic growth of an organism inside a host [24]. The genome plasticity of all 53 T. pallidum strains was determined by using GIPSy (Genomic Island Prediction Software) on subspecies-based study. The software BRIG (BLAST Ring Image Generator) [25] was used for the circular genome comparison visualization. Some of the other strains from the representing cluster of the dendogram were also used for the circular genome visualization. We found differences in the presence/absence of pathogenicity islands (PAIs) and genomic islands (GIs) on subspecies-based study: four Pathogenicity Islands (PAIs) eight genomic islands (GIs) in subsp. pallidum (Fig. 6); three PAIs and seven GIs in subsp. endemicum (Fig. 7); and, three PAIs and eight GIs in subsp. pertenue (Fig. 8).\n\n\n",

In the last few years, T. pallidum subsp. pallidum (TPA), has been reported as a reemerging pathogen [1, 15]. These three subsp. of Treponema pallidum are so close to each other that they cannot be differentiated serologically, their morphology is indistinguishable and are antigenically cross-reactive [27, 28]. Mostly, the disease phenotype caused by these pathogens can only be distinguished clinically and geographically. The distribution of venereal syphilis is global, non-venereal yaws usually effect kids in hot and/or humid regions of Africa and Asia, endemic syphilis be in dry places like Sahelian Africa and Saudi Arabia [27, 29]. The nature of T. pallidum is highly invasive. It circulates through bloodstream and lymphatics and overruns a wide-ranging of tissues and organs. As demonstrated by the widespread clinical manifestations related to syphilis infections, Treponema pallidum subsp. pallidum crosses placental, endothelial and blood-brain barriers early in infection, the incidence of congenital syphilis and invasion of central nervous system has been observed in almost 40% of early syphilis patients. Though, the understanding of the mechanisms responsible for the widespread distribution capability of T. pallidum is still very limited [30, 31].",

Pathogenicity islands carry the genes related to the virulence, which are essential and characterize a class of Genomics Island [33]. The comparative analysis of PAIs and GIs showed the absence of genes at the subspecies level. We found gene clusters, that are related to amino acid and lipid biosynthesis, belonging to PAIs 2 of T. pallidum subsp. pallidum have not been identified in any PAIs or GIs of T. pallidum subsp. endemicum and T. pallidum subsp. pertenue. It might be possible that these genes help bacteria to execute different modes of infection at subsp. level of T. pallidum. Acyl carrier protein (ACP) synthase (AcpS) catalyzes the transfer of the 4\u2032-phosphopantetheine moiety from coenzyme A (CoA) onto a serine residue of apo-ACP, to convert apo-ACP to the functional holo-ACP. During the biosynthesis of fatty acids and phospholipids, the holo form of bacterial ACP plays a vital role in mediating the transfer of acyl fatty acid. AcpS is therefore an attractive target for therapeutic interpolation. It has been reported that, AcpS enzymes from Mycoplasma pneumoniae and S. pneumoniae may play a crucial role in the acylation of fatty acids derived from human tissues for their lipid biosynthesis, suggesting that AcpS is a more striking antimicrobial target for discovery of novel antibiotics than bacterial fatty acid biosynthetic enzymes [34, 35].",

Notably, the amino acid sequences IASDGGAIKH and IASEDGSAGNLKH in V1 are not only present in high proportion in inter-strain comparison but also were found at a quite high frequency in the populations. The alignment of all amino acid sequences revealed some really stable pattern within each V region of the primary and secondary syphilis samples, particularly the amino acid sequences IASDGGAIKH and IASEDGSAGNLKH in V1 region.

Unlike syphilis, it is said that yaws cannot be transmitted vertically or affect the central nervous system. It is rather limited to skin, bones, joints and soft tissues. In the 1980s, a very limited genetic diversity between these pathogens was established when hybridization experiments were carried out with DNA isolated from yaws and syphilis strains [29]. Our work also showed that genomes of syphilis, yaws, and Bejel treponemes share 97\u2013100% overall similarity, as well as the identical organization. This evidence proposes that small genetic changes in key genes among these organisms could be responsible for the reported differences in disease pathogenesis. Considering the genes in PAIs and GIs, we identified some absence of pathogenicity islands in all subspecies. Genes which are present in pallidum subspecies pathogenicity islands (PAIs) or genomic islands (GIs) are absent in the subspecies endemicum and pertenue. The findings of this analysis are very important, as it can help in the understanding of molecular basis of infections from T. pallidum subsps. Furthermore, the core genes represent the most desirable source for the selection of conserved genes; therefore, characterization of such poorly studied proteins helps in understanding the cellular metabolism, mode of infection and regulation of gene expression of Treponema pallidum. Hence, this study can help to better understand the molecular modes of bacterial infection and are significance for vaccine development for syphilis.",

The extrapolations of the pan-genomes from the complete dataset and all subsets were calculated based on Heap\u2019s Law [20, 51], which was used to calculate whether the pan-genome was open or closed. Heap\u2019s Law is an empirical law represented by the formula n = k*N\u03b3; it describes the number of distinct words in a document (or set of documents) as a function of the document length. In a genetic context, n is the expected number of genes for a given number of genomes, N determines the number of genomes, and the k and \u03b3 (\u03b1 =1-\u03b3) are free parameters that are determined empirically. According to Heap\u2019s Law, when \u03b1 > 1 (\u03b3 < 0), the pan-genome is considered to be closed, and there will be no significant increase in the number of genes with the addition of a new genome. On the other hand, when \u03b1 < 1 (0 < \u03b3 < 1), the pan-genome is open and there will be a significant increase in the number of genes for each newly added genome.",

The islands predictions for three datasets were determined by using GIPSy (Genomic Island Prediction Software) [33]. GIPSy is a multi-step approach that predicts Genomic islands (GIs) and Pathogenicity islands (PAIs). PAIs and GIs predictions are based on commonly shared features such as genomic signature deviation (anomalous G + C content and codon usage deviation), presence of transposase genes; metabolism, virulence, antibiotic resistance, or symbiosis-related genes; flanking tRNA genes; and absence in other organisms of the same genus or closely related species [33]. T. denticola strain ATCC 35405 was used as a non-pathogenic species from the same Treponema genus for GIs and PAIs prediction [54]. The sizes of the islands were compared with all the other strains via ACT (Artemis Comparison Tool) software [55]. PAIs regions were plotted using the software BRIG [25]. Following the curation of the PAIs, the genes of all the islands in each strain were assessed for their presence/absence in all the other strains.",
