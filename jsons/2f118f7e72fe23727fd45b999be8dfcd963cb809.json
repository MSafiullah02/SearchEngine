These terms have to be agreed, and until they have been, opinions can be viewed as speculative. However, Brexit will almost certainly have an impact on the UK's workforce, including the oral health workforce. Two key issues are: will EU nationals who are currently working in the UK wish to remain, and will it become more difficult for EU citizens to come to the UK to work?",

It is therefore uncertain exactly what effect they will have on planning the UK's oral healthcare workforce. Nevertheless, as 16% of dentists currently registered with the Genral Dental Council (GDC) have migrated to the UK from EU countries, this factor must be taken into consideration by workforce planners. However, it is far from being the only factor. This opinion piece therefore describes the current numbers of non-UK EU dentists and DCPs registered with the GDC and poses the question 'will they remain in the UK in the future'? It then comments on the current legislation on recognition of non-UK dental qualifications. It goes on to consider the Migration Advisory Committee's recommendation for dental practitioners, the oral healthcare needs of the population of the UK, who could address them and the implications for the Advancing Dental Care project Qualifications directive), 3 the UK is obligated to recognise the qualifications of EU dentists and, subject to proof of their good standing, register them. A different EC directive applies to DCPs and they have to prove that they have received equivalent training to UK DCPs and produce proof of good standing before they can be registered. This is possibly one reason why far fewer EU DCPs than dentists are registered with the GDC.",

The question therefore arises as to how the GDC will assess EU dentists who wish to register. In future, one possibility is that in order to be registered they will have to pass the Overseas Registration Examination (ORE). However, as the registrar of the GDC has pointed out, this would have financial consequences. 4 A system of mutual recognition of dental qualifications is operated by Australia, Canada, New Zealand and the Irish Republic. 4 Such a system might provide a mechanism for the GDC to recognise dental qualifications gained in other countries, including those of the EU. However, negotiations with the countries concerned and appropriate legislation would be required before this could happen. A third but perhaps unlikely scenario is that, although no longer a member of the EU, it would still accept the Recognition of Professional Qualifications directive. 3",

Those in 'shortage' professions and trades will be given priority of entry to the UK. Disappointingly, in a review of its shortage occupations list (SOL), performed in May 2019, the MAC stated: 'We do not recommend including dental practitioners in the SOL, despite evidence received from stakeholders, as the relative vacancy rate is below average and the ranking of the shortage indicators is middle of the range' . 5 The evidence received by the MAC included a survey of EU registrants, performed for the GDC, which suggested that as many as a third of EU qualified dentists were considering leaving the UK in the next five years 5 and a statement from the BDA which included that many providers of dentistry are having trouble in recruting and that participation rates appear to be dropping in all four countries of the UK and the ageing population has an increased need for complex treatment. 5 The oral healthcare needs of the population of the UK and who could address these needs Logically, workforce planning should consider present and likely future population needs and demands. Reliable, up-to-date, representative data are therefore a prerequisite. At present, in the UK, only Scotland has such data. In England, Wales and Northern Ireland, the last Adult Dental Health Survey (ADHS) took place in 2009, 6 and the last Child Dental Health Survey in 2013. 7 A new ADHS is at the planning stage. However, with the current COVID-19 crisis, it seems unlikely that it could begin before 2021 at the earliest and, judging by previous ADHSs, unlikely that the results would be published before 2023.",

Such task sharing is currently common in countries such as Denmark, Finland, Sweden and the Netherlands, where the ratio of registered dentists to dental hygienists is around 2:1. 9 In the UK, at 31 December 2019, the number of dental hygienists registered with the GDC was 7,535, just under 3,000 of whom were also registered as dental therapists. 1 Thus, in the UK, the present ratio of dentists to dental hygienists is 6:1.",

After the current interim arrangements with the EU have finished, it may well be more difficult for EU dentists and DCPs to register with the GDC, so their numbers may decline. However, other factors such as the economic situation and employment opportunities in their own countries will come into play. Overall, the probability seems to be that the number of EU dentists registered with the GDC will decline and that this will have an impact on oral healthcare workforce numbers.",

In particular, they advise on who could provide care and treatment and how they should be trained. It is currently in the middle of the second phase of its three-year programme and has recently examined evidence from the UK and other countries. The evidence from treatment trends in the NHS GDS and from other countries suggests that there will be an increased need for disease prevention and relatively simple treatment. However, due to the ageing population, many of whom have underlying medical problems, there will also be a need for more complex care and for an oral healthcare workforce which can address this need. Much of the prevention and relatively simple care could be provided by DCPs in general, and dental hygienists and therapists in particular. However, given the relatively small numbers of dental hygienists and therapists at present, it would require a considerable expansion in the number of training places before significant numbers were qualified, and it would take many years for the numbers of UK dental hygienists and therapists to match those of dentists. The current system of payment within the GDS would also need revision, as it does not recognise dental therapists and hygienists as providers. Furthermore, in 2011, for those working in general dental practice in England, over 80% of dental hygienists' income came from private fees, rather than the GDS. 11 It seems unlikely that this has changed since then.",
