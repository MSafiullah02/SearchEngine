MRI showed cerebral and thoracic demyelinating lesions, and lumbar puncture revealed slight pleocytosis and positive oligoclonal bandings. A diagnosis of relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis was established at that time. A sensory relapse followed in 2011. Immunomodulatory therapy with fingolimod was initiated in 2011 and continued until today. Hereunder no further relapses occurred, and no chronic deterioration of neurological symptoms was observed. However, in 2018, cervical MRI revealed a new inflammatory lesion. The patient was under regular clinical and laboratory monitoring (October 2019: Extended Disability Status Scale: 2.0; total lymphocytes 0.73/nL [1.22-3.56]). At no point in time any evidence for the activation of a latent virus disease had been detected.",

Peripheral oxygen saturation (SpO2) was 87% at a respiratory rate of 30/min. Chest CT scan showed bilateral multiple ground-glass opacities with a peripheral lung and subpleural distribution in the upper and lower lobes (Figure). The patient required supplemental oxygen therapy of 5L/min via oxygen mask yielding in SpO2 of 93%. She was transferred to the intensive care unit (ICU) of our University hospital. On admission (day 0), physical examination revealed fever (39.5\u00b0C) and a respiratory rate of 28/min. Laboratory tests showed CRP elevation (2.7mg/dL [<0.5]) and peripheral lymphopenia typical for fingolimod treatment (total lymphocytes 0.39/nL [1.22-3.56], T-lymphocytes [CD3+] 0.31/nL [0.7-1.2], T-helper cells [CD4+] 0.032/nL [0.3-1.4], T-suppressor cells [CD8+] normal). Neutrophil and platelet counts were within normal ranges, but liver function testing revealed a mild elevation of AST (62U/L [<35]) and GGT (65U/L [<40]; ALT and total bilirubin normal). Coagulation parameters were normal apart from D-dimer elevation (1137ng/mL [<500]). Arterial blood gas analysis showed paO2 of 83mmHg, pCO2 of 38mmHg and pH of 7.45. Oropharyngeal swab specimens were positive for SARS CoV-2 (diagnosed using quantitative reverse transcriptase\u2013polymerase chain reaction targeting the RdRp-gene [CT value 21.61]). No bacterial (co)infection or influenza were detected. Fingolimod medication was stopped. Non-invasive ventilation was used to provide oxygen and ventilation support regularly. Over the following two days, oxygenation improved. On day four the patient had a normal respiratory rate, and nasal oxygen supply could be reduced to 2L with SpO2 of 96%. Chest X-ray showed regressive peripheral consolidations in the lungs. No other complications occurred. On day five, we transferred the patient to a normal ward.",

            "text": "Our patient had a severe COVID-19 infection with bilateral interstitial pneumonia demanding non-invasive ventilation and ICU care (Guan et al., 2020). In addition, the patient combined several risk factors potentially associated with a worse outcome in COVID-19, including age, chronic concomitant disorder and immunomodulatory therapy. Nevertheless, the disease course stabilized rapidly without occurrence of further organ manifestation. The implications fingolimod has on COVID-19 are complex. As an immunomodulatory drug, it retains na\u00efve T cells and central memory T cells within the lymph nodes, thereby preventing autoimmune inflammation in the brain (Pinschewer et al., 2011). However, for defending infectious disease antigens, effector memory T cells are pivotal which are less affected by fingolimod treatment (Pinschewer et al., 2011). Thus, despite severe lymphopenia, innate and adaptive immune responses to SARS CoV-2 presumably were preserved in our patient. Pathological key-features of COVID-19 in the lung include pulmonary edema and diffuse alveolar damage with cellular fibromyxoid exudates (Xu et al., 2020). Interestingly, S1P is a potent angiogenic factor that enhances lung endothelial cell integrity. It stabilizes vascular permeability and alveolar flooding in preclinical animal models of acute lung injury (Natarajan et al., 2013). Moreover, increased levels of cytokines were measured in COVID-19 infected patients with severe courses of disease (Huang et al., 2020). In case of a so-called cytokine storm, immunomodulation is a therapeutic option. Taken together, fingolimod may be of value to control severe respiratory disease, and a clinical trial has been proposed in COVID-19 patients (https).",
