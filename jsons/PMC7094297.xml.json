The ability of terrorists to disrupt health care services was seen when unsuspecting victims intentionally were exposed to anthrax in the United States in the fall of 2001. Before that time, anthrax had been considered as the exotic wool-sorters disease [3]. Multiple victims were exposed, and several agencies responded. The agencies were unable to delineate their roles and the responsibilities of each partner. There was not a clear understanding of the chain of command, how to communicate specialized knowledge, or communicate through the media to the general public. Public health officials had difficulty identifying the limits of their own knowledge, authority, and responsibility. In the midst of the chaos, public health nurses were asked to conduct communicable disease investigations, perform clinical tasks, administer mass medication clinics, and communicate with the worried well.",

Infectious diseases caused by a bioterrorist organism are not like a naturally occurring acute event (eg, varicella) that is relatively time-limited. Instead, an intentionally released agent will appear as an index case, then spread to close and secondary contacts over an extended period of time.

Continuing education about the clinical manifestations of biological agents can be obtained readily through print and online sources [11], [12], [13]. For example, the CDC has categorized biological agents according to accessibility, ease of use, potential for social disruption, morbidity, and mortality [11]. Category A, B. and C agents result in diseases not normally seen in everyday public health practice, and the very mention of names such as smallpox, anthrax, and plague raises grave concerns among the public. Nurses are among the most trusted and accessible of all health professionals. Therefore, family, friends, neighbors, patients, and clients frequently ask a nurse for health information about emerging infectious diseases and bioterrorism. The nurse can use or refer the lay public to fact sheets on biological agents that are available through the CDC [13].
