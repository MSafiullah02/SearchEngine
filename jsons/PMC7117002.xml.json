It should be noted that many people sneeze more than once in a cycle of sneezing. However, we only consider sneezing or coughing once for simplification. In fact, the results in the following will show that sneezing or coughing only once may cause long transport distance and high concentration of particles, which implies that sneezing or coughing more than once may cause higher concentration.

Fig. 3\nshows the streamline at the symmetrical plane (Z=1.5 m) during the first respiration period (see Fig. 2(a)). Because of the relatively smaller air flow volume when breathing, the inhaling and exhaling processes have little influence on the room air flow pattern. Fig. 4\ngives the particle concentration at different times when the human is exhaling or inhaling. It is seen that the particle concentration reduces to below 0.001% of the outlet particle concentration within 1.0 m away from the human. The air exchange rate per hour (ACH) for this case is 0.5. Thus, we can imagine that a larger air exchange rate may cause better indoor environment with lower particle concentration and shorter spreading distance of particles.

            "text": "Unlike normal respiration, sneezing or coughing may produce a large amount of particles of droplets, with a diameter of about 10\u2013100 \u03bcm. However, they will split into smaller particles of 1\u20134 \u03bcm in a very short time [2]. Therefore, 1.0 \u03bcm is again adopted as the particle diameter in the simulation. Fig. 3(c) shows the streamline at the symmetrical plane (Z=1.5 m) for an initial velocity V\nem=100.0 m/s (see Fig. 2(b)). It is seen that the large outlet velocity will maintain a much longer distance of particle transport due to the large momentum. Fig. 5\ncompares the simulated flow pattern with the measured one by [2]. The results seem reasonable. Fig. 6\nfurther gives the particle concentration distribution at different times since the sneezing or coughing begins, which indicates that sneezing or coughing may cause long transport distance of particles, although the ventilation air exchange rate is rather large (5 ACH). Comparison of the two different outlet velocities of the sneezing or coughing case indicates that larger sneezing or coughing velocity will cause further transport and higher concentration of the exhaled particles or droplets. Fig. 7\nshows the three-dimensional view of the particle concentration distribution at several different times. The contour zone stands for the particle concentration where the value is larger than 1% of the outlet concentration. If we define \u201caffecting range\u201d as the distance from the patient to where the concentration reduces to the \u201csafe threshold\u201d, and define \u201csafe threshold\u201d as the percentage of outlet concentration that will not cause adverse effect on people, Fig. 7 depicts the \u201caffecting range\u201d of the sneezing or coughing if we consider 1% as the \u201csafe threshold\u201d (in fact, the exact threshold needs careful study). The figure also proves that particles generated during coughing or sneezing may travel a long distance, which may pose adverse effect on human bodies for defending the SARS or other infectious diseases. From the results, good personal habits, that is, covering the nose and mouth when sneezing or coughing, is very important for preventing the transmission of the diseases from human to human.",
