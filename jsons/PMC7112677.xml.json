            "text": "Asthma is thought to affect at least 300 million people of all ages and ethnic backgrounds worldwide (Global strategy for asthma management and prevention, 1995). Between 1 in 5 and 1 in 10 people are affected in Western societies and the prevalence has doubled since 1980 (Umetsu et al., 2002, AIHW, 2005). It is now considered to be an epidemic and results in a massive economic burden to communities. Exacerbations are typically caused by exposure to environmental factors to which the individual is allergic. Although asthma is clearly recognised as an inflammatory condition, our understanding of the mechanisms of pathogenesis remains rudimentary. Clinically asthma is characterised by airway obstruction, wheezing and episodic breathlessness in association with increased sensitivity of the airways to non-specific stimuli (termed airway hyperresponsiveness (AHR)) (Bousquet et al., 2000). Wheezing is a high-pitched whistling or squeaking, which originates from the chest and is made during breathing (Michel et al., 2006). A predominant feature of disease is the acute-on-chronic infiltration of pro-inflammatory activated CD4+ Th2 cells and eosinophils into the airways, which are critical regulators of pathogenesis (Robinson et al., 1993, Kay, 2005). Typical pathogenic features include: IgE production; airway smooth muscle (ASM) and goblet cell hypertrophy/hyperplasia; mucus hypersecretion; eosinophil, neutrophil and mononuclear cell infiltration into submucosal layer of the airways; mast cell and macrophage activation; sloughing of airway epithelial cells; and AHR (Foster et al., 1996, Kumar, 2001, Cohn et al., 2004). Th2 cells and activated inflammatory cells release a range of mediators that damage the mucosal epithelial lining and promote an exaggerated repair response that leads to airway remodelling and chronic disease. Remodelling is the result of structural changes of the epithelium, submucosal layer, ASM and vasculature (angiogenesis) (Bousquet et al., 2000, Vignola et al., 2003). It is thought to be a major contributing factor to the development of AHR, and its progression may lead to fixed airflow obstruction and irreversible loss of lung function (Li and Wilson, 1997, Vignola et al., 2003). Thus, airway inflammation is closely linked to AHR and airflow obstruction and recurring inflammatory insults may result in changes that lead to airway remodelling. The mechanisms responsible for the generation of inflammation and remodelling remain poorly understood but may be induced or exacerbated by respiratory viral infection.",

When compared to subjects with non-infective acute asthma, those with acute asthma and infection had evidence of more severe clinical disease, had a lower mean forced expiratory volume (FEV1 % predicted), were more likely to be admitted to hospital and had a longer median length of stay. An acute neutrophilic infiltrate was observed in induced sputum, with evidence of neutrophil degranulation, unlike the eosinophilic inflammation associated with non-infective asthma (Wark et al., 2002). In addition lactate dehydrogenase was measured as a marker of asthmatic airway necrosis. Those with virus-associated acute asthma had significantly elevated lactate dehydrogenase activity, which correlated closely with the degree of neutrophil influx and airflow obstruction and was an independent predictor of the severity of the acute illness. These results strongly implicate viral infection as a trigger of exacerbations with increased severity and indicate an important role for viruses in modifying inflammation in acute asthma (Wark et al., 2002).",

The precise roles of respiratory viral infection in the development and exacerbation of the different phenotypes of asthma remain largely unknown, however, there is the potential that viral infection may be particularly important in certain phenotypes. Different and customised prevention and treatment strategies may be required for different phenotypes depending on their causes. Targeted anti-viral strategies may be more effective in certain asthma phenotypes for example in severe and neutrophilic asthma, where infectious agents may play a substantial role in pathogenesis (Wark et al., 2002).",

The time of year also plays a role with winter the dominant period for viral infections and wheeze (Heymann et al., 2004). Genetic predisposition may be important and many genes are implicated in susceptibility to asthma including those involved in inflammatory responses, IgE regulation, cytokine and chemokine production, airway function and remodelling (Umetsu et al., 2002). Atopy may lead to adverse responses to infection and childhood wheezing is linked to elevated IgE and sensitivity to at least one inhaled allergen. However, the genetics of Western populations that are experiencing the asthma epidemic remain unchanged and the focus of this review will be on other important factors that are associated with RSV- and RV-associated asthma. These include the age of infection and timing of infection relative to allergen exposure, increased innate susceptibility and adaptive immune, cytokine and chemokine responses, as well as environmental conditions and inhaled bacterial endotoxin.",

Furthermore airway obstruction and AHR is increased in those with RSV bronchiolitis compared to controls (Sigurs, 2002b). A nested case-controlled study also showed that RSV-induced hospitalization correlated with wheezing, LRT infections and asthma during first 4 years of life. The correlation decreased with age and was not significant at 5 years but the association held for increased respiratory symptoms and chronic productive cough at 5\u20138 years in Alaska native children (Singleton et al., 2003). In the Stein study wheezing subjects were significantly more responsive to bronchodilators, which indicates that reduced lung function results from an abnormality in airway tone (Stein et al., 1999).",

Recent studies have found that children hospitalized with RSV have an increased risk of recurrent wheeze up to the age of 13 years, independent of atopy and other asthma risk factors, identifying RSV infection as a potential inducer of asthma. Indeed these subjects have significantly more respiratory symptoms, (43% vs 8% for asthma/recurrent wheezing), sensitization to common allergens (50% vs 28% SPT, 45% vs 26% serum IgE), airway obstruction and AHR at age 13 years compared with controls (Sigurs et al., 2005). Other recent reports have also shown that RSV infection is associated with concomitant respiratory symptoms (wheezing) and subsequent asthma at 2 years of age and that high rates of RSV are isolated from children with recurrent wheeze or asthma (Lazzaro et al., 2007, Lee et al., 2007).

Atopic adults also have Th2 responses to allergens whereas non-atopics have low-level Th1 responses (Ogra, 2004).

Furthermore allergic sensitization and asthma are significantly more common in all age groups in children with a prior RSV bronchiolitis (23% vs 2% and 41% vs 22% of controls, respectively) (Sigurs, 2002a). It appears that the severity of infection may be important and severe infection has been associated with the development of allergic sensitization 3, 6 or 7.5 years after hospitalization (Sigurs et al., 1995, Sigurs et al., 2000). Mild infection, does not appear to be a risk factor for allergic sensitization (Stein et al., 1999, Sigurs et al., 2000).

It has been shown that although RSV infection is the greatest risk factor for wheezing and asthma in subjects with a family history of asthma, asthma does not develop in those without infection or a family history (Sigurs et al., 2000, Sigurs, 2001). This indicates that RSV bronchiolitis is a marker of increased risk of asthma susceptibility. More recently it has been suggested that the host response to infection rather than the nature of the infection itself is the best prognostic indictor for subsequent allergic disease (Everard, 2006a, Everard, 2006b).",

            "text": "Whether RSV infection induces immunological and pathological processes that may lead to asthma may depend on the age at which an individual is first infected. The immune phenotype of early life may lead to enhanced viral replication and Th2-dominated inflammation induced by infection or allergen exposure. Increased levels of IL-4 were detected in RSV infected infants less than 3 months old compared to more than 3 months but the converse was true for eotaxin and there was no difference in MIP-1\u03b2 or eosinophil cationic protein (ECP) (Kristjansson et al., 2005). In mothers infection induced high levels of IFN-\u03b3 and low levels of IL-4 whereas newborn infants produced 4\u20137 times less IFN-\u03b3 and higher levels of IL-4 but at age 3 these levels approached those of their mothers (Mbawuike et al., 2001). The immune response in early life may be involved in the induction of more severe LRT pathology in response to primary infection but infection of older children is not as severe and involves largely URT symptoms. An additional pathological consequence is that viral infections in early life may generate pulmonary inflammation during the development of the lung, small and large airways and immune, inflammatory and neuronal programing (reviewed in Gern et al. (2005)). This may result in altered pulmonary structure and immune responses leading to enhanced pro-inflammatory and Th2-biased immune responses that may precipitate deleterious changes in lung structure and function. Furthermore, the small size of neonatal bronchioles determines that they may become obstructed more readily, which may result in reduced clearance and confer enhanced severity of pathogenic infection in this age group. The combination of these events may have long-term effects on lung function, chronic respiratory inflammation, remodelling, alveolarization and epithelial dysfunction (Gern et al., 2005) and consequently may promote the development of asthma.",

Another alternative explanation for the association of RSV infection in infancy with asthma is that early life infection induces Th1 memory and therefore CD8+ CTL responses, which have the potential to induce pathologic immune responses to reinfection. RSV infection induces viral specific CD8+ cells in infants and the levels of cytotoxic lymphocytes (CTLs) are inversely proportional to IL-4 responses. CTL responses are directly linked to protection against infection, CTL memory is initiated upon reinfection and MHC I CD8+ levels correlate directly with IFN-\u03b3 levels (Mbawuike et al., 2001).",

Established infections are primarily cleared by a combination of Th1 and Th2 cell responses and the balance between the two may be crucial in determining the outcome of infection, the severity of RSV-induced disease and predisposition to asthma. Aberrant responses of either of these subsets may induce pathology. Nevertheless most studies suggest that Th1 responses may result in viral clearance and mild symptoms whereas an aberrant bias towards a Th2 phenotype may lead to more intense RSV-induced disease and promote the development of asthma (Psarras et al., 2004). Indeed individuals with elevated Th2 responses are predisposed to reduced viral clearance and more severe disease compared to subjects with only URT infection independently of age or viral load (Roman et al., 1997, Aberle et al., 1999, Legg et al., 2003, Gern et al., 2006). Early life RSV bronchiolitis results in enhanced IL-4 and IFN-\u03b3 responses to RSV in later childhood (Pala et al., 2002) and IL-4 is the most important stimulus for Th2 development and IgE production. Th2 responses are enhanced during severe disease that develops upon natural infection of RSV-vaccinated infants (Kim et al., 1969, Kapikian et al., 1969) and severe RSV bronchiolitis correlates with elevated humoral Th2 responses, and may be linked with atopy, increased IL-4:IFN-\u03b3 and reduced Th1 (IFN-\u03b3, IL-12 and IL-18) responses. RSV infections may also have persistent immunological effects and induce long-term Th2 memory responses during sensitization to inhaled allergens in childhood (Holt and Sly, 2002a, van Rijt et al., 2005). Other studies have demonstrated that mild bronchiolitis is associated with a shift towards Th1 responses and is usual in most individuals, and also that there is no increase in Th2 responses in severe bronchiolitis (Garofalo et al., 2001). These contrasting results may be attributable to differences in the timing of sampling during infection, the lack of definitive detection of RSV or determination of virus load, age and atopic status of individuals.",

Furthermore treatment of human epithelial cells with TGF-\u03b2, which plays a pivotal role in airway remodelling and asthma, increased RSV replication and TNF-\u03b1 secretion and p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase activation.

Antibody responses to primary infection are ineffective and involve the production of partially neutralising antibodies against the G and F proteins (Psarras et al., 2004) but these responses are reinforced (especially IgG and IgA) upon reinfection.

Angiogenesis is regulated by a balance between pro-angiogenic (vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF), angiogenins, chemokines) and anti-angiogenic (endostatin, canstatin, tumstatin, arresten) factors (Cohen, 2002). Vasodilation of the increased number of blood vessels in response to inflammatory stimuli may lead to edema and inflammation of the bronchial wall (influx of inflammatory cells, including eosinophils and release of mediators), airway narrowing and AHR (Black and Page, 1994, Wilson, 2000, Salvato, 2001, Nomura et al., 2005). Elevated levels of VEGF, bFGF and angiogenins occur in the airways of asthmatics and correlate with increased vascularity, vessel permeability and AHR (Hoshino et al., 2001, Kanazawa et al., 2004, Nomura et al., 2005, Feltis et al., 2006). VEGF influences vascular permeability through the formation of blood vessel fenestrations and vasiculo\u2013vasculo organelles (Dvorak et al., 1996, Esser et al., 1998, Neufeld et al., 1999). VEGF also stimulates endothelial cell proliferation and migration, matrix remodelling, and vasodilation, as well as inhibiting endothelial cell apoptosis and all of these processes are involved in angiogenesis (Neufeld et al., 1999). VEGF also enhances sensitization of the RT to allergens and promotes Th2 inflammation (Lee et al., 2004).",

These cells also occur in the alveoli during the peak of inflammation but leakage into the airway lumen is absent (Jafri et al., 2004). Infection peaks at days 4\u20135 and resolves between days 7 and 9 and cytokines and chemokines (IL-8, MIPs and RANTES) are released by the respiratory epithelium and alveolar macrophages in response to infection. After 3 days NK cells influx into the BALF and are replaced between 4 and 8 days by CD4+ and CD8+ cells which return to pre-infection levels at 21 days (Hussell & Openshaw, 1998). CTLs induced in response to infection contribute to extensive peri-bronchiolar and -alveolar inflammation and are associated with disease symptoms (Ostler et al., 2002). IFN-\u03b3 is important in viral clearance and contributes to pathology and is primarily released by NK cells with levels peaking at day 4. Only low levels of IL-4 and Il-5 are present, however, IL-4, -5, -10, -12, -13 and IFN-\u03b3 are produced in the lungs within the first few days and their relative levels determines the course of disease (Kalina & Gershwin, 2004). IL-10 plays a pivotal role in the development of infection-induced AHR in the absence of allergen exposure (Makela et al., 2002).",

Jafri et al., used Penh to show that airway obstruction and AHR remained for 42 and 154 days after infection, respectively, and that AHR correlated with chronic inflammation which persisted but not in alveoli (Jafri et al., 2004). This supports the concept that RSV disease may induce long-term respiratory changes in children (Stein et al., 1999, Sigurs et al., 2005). However, these studies need to be confirmed by the measurement of lower airway resistance using invasive methods that precisely measure changes in airway and tissue specific function and employ dose responses to spasmogens. Studies using these methods (measurement of respiratory impedance and airway resistance) have shown a lack of long-term effects of RSV infection on lung function (Dakhama et al., 2005c, Collins et al., 2007).",

These effects are substantial and can reverse the protective effect of mycobacterial exposure on AAD (Li et al., 2006). Neonatal RSV infection results in early TNF-\u03b1 release and has long-term adverse effects on the respiratory system. These effects include the induction of AHR, peri-vascular and -bronchial inflammation and subepithelial fibrosis, which are exacerbated by subsequent allergen exposure and involve persistent IL-13 expression and mucus hypersecretion (You et al., 2006). The generation of Th2 responses during immunological development has profound modulatory effects on the balance of subsequent Th1/Th2 responses and promote a marked increase in the Th2 phenotype in adulthood (Chen et al., 2001, Walzl et al., 2001, Culley et al., 2002). The neonatal Th2 bias may result from the types of T cells or dendritic cells present, their environment or a combination of these effects (Nelson et al., 1994, Goriely et al., 2001, White et al., 2002, Bartz et al., 2003).",

This suggests that AAD of adults primed with an infection as neonates is likely to be caused by factors that promote Th2 responses (Culley et al., 2002, Holt and Sly, 2002a). If initial infection is delayed until mice are 3 weeks of age IFN-\u03b3 production increases and upon reinfection, although airway inflammation still occurs, there is a subsequent reduction in the severity of disease with no mucus production or AHR (Culley et al., 2002, Dakhama et al., 2005b). Thus delaying the age of infection until later in life may be an effective strategy for the prevention of RSV-associated asthma.",

Chavez-Bueno et al. (2005) demonstrated that RSV induces acute and chronic disease with features of AAD independently of allergic sensitization or genetic background in mice. RSV infection of BALB/c or C57BL/6 mice in the absence of allergic sensitization led to similar levels of acute airway inflammation, airflow obstruction and AHR and the degree of airway inflammation correlated with AHR. The immune response was surprisingly similar between the two strains and was characterised by virus-dependent release of IFN-\u03b3. Importantly infection and inflammatory responses were not short lived. Acute infection developed into persistent infection that correlated with airway inflammation, which were present 77 days after infection. While virus load and airway inflammation were greatest during the acute phase, chronic infection correlated with chronic inflammation and airflow obstruction. Thus RSV infection can initiate acute events that result in airflow obstruction and possibly AHR and these changes can persist beyond the initial inflammatory response.",

The absence of the CC chemokine receptor 1 (CCR1) in deficient mice leads to reductions in T cells, IL-13, eosinophils, mucus and AHR (John et al., 2005).

IL-5 production leads to eosinophilia, IL-13 to the release of MCP and further Th2-mediated inflammation but IL-10 does not further enhance AHR. If rats are sensitized to extracts of the common household mould Aspergillus fumigatus, which induces eosinophilia and Th2 cytokine release, RSV infection before allergen challenge exacerbates the inflammatory response and AHR that is dependent on viral replication. Infection causes increased expression of MHC II on alveolar macrophages, which may be involved in initiating immune responses to allergens. Persistence of infection is induced and is related to reduced IFN-\u03b3 expression again suggesting that allergic sensitization can affect the progression of RSV infection (Kalina & Gershwin, 2004). Treatment of infected A. fumigatus challenged animals with recombinant IFN-\u03b3 reduced allergic responses and Th1 and Th2 cytokines but not AHR. This suggests that pathological and physiological factors of disease are independent (Hassantoufighi et al., 2007).",

Primary RSV infections induce the expression of chemokines belonging to the CXC (IL-8, MIP-2 and IP-10), CC (RANTES, eotaxin, MIP-1\u03b1, MCP-1 and T cell activation gene-3) and C (lymphotactin) families in the lung.

IFN-\u03b3 is the archetypal Th1 cytokine and its release and signalling through the IFN-\u03b3 receptor during infection are pivotal in controlling the Th1/Th2 response to infection. These processes are essential in moderating eosinophil migration and IFN-\u03b3 and CD8+ cells are crucial for viral clearance. In the absence of IFN-\u03b3 a dominant Th2 response induces eosinophil influx of the lung and AHR (Barends et al., 2003). By contrast, the absence of IL-12 and IL-18 has little effect (Boelen et al., 2002). IL-12 does, however, induce Th1 and suppresses Th2 responses, promotes IFN-\u03b3 production from NK and CD8+ cells, reduces IL-4 and IL-5 production from CD4+ and CD8+ cells and can prevent but is not essential for inhibiting virus-induced eosinophil influx to the lung (Hussell & Openshaw, 2000). IL-12 does not function through CD4+ or B cells and exacerbates disease in mice sensitized to allergen (Openshaw et al., 2003). The removal of CD4+ or the induction of CD8+ cells also eliminates eosinophil influx (Hussell et al., 1997).",

Adoptive transfer of virus-specific CD8+ CTLs which home to the lung eliminates RSV. These cells induce viral clearance through perforin/granzyme-mediated lysis of virus-infected cells (Aung et al., 2001). However, perforin (which is also produced by NK cells), CD95L and TNF are not necessary but IFN-\u03b3 release is crucial for CD8+ T cell-mediated clearance. RSV was eliminated with unchanged kinetics from perforin deficient mice (Aung et al., 2001, Ostler et al., 2002), whereas treatment of mice with neutralising antibody to IFN-\u03b3 or transfusion of IFN-\u03b3-deficient effector CTLs abolished virus control and induced CD8+ T cell-mediated pathology (Ostler et al., 2002). By contrast, high dose primary infection in IFN-\u03b3 deficient mice led to attenuated immunopathology, but only slightly delayed clearance. This suggests that other cells and molecules can partially substitute for CTL-derived IFN-\u03b3 driven virus clearance and further implicates IFN-\u03b3 as a pivotal immune factor in RSV-induced immunopathology and CD8+ T cell-mediated control (Ostler et al., 2002).",

During differentiation the cells are subject to infection-induced modulation and it is likely that the CD8+/CD4+ interaction is occurring concurrently. Similar interactions may take place during allergen provocation in the RT of asthmatics that have the potential to substantially affect T cell phenotype, an effect that may be enhanced upon infection. Thus the complex interactions of CD4+ and CD8+ with infectious stimuli and allergens may be pivotally important in the development of RSV-induced AAD.

            "text": "Studies in mice have suggested that RSV may promote its own infection by suppressing host immunity resulting in enhanced inflammation. The RSV G protein may attenuate innate responses by binding to TNF-\u03b1 (Valarcher & Taylor, 2007) and the induction of cytokine production from monocytes and macrophages through the inhibition of TLR-4-NF-\u03baB mediated signalling (Polack et al., 2005). RSV-specific T cells may play a crucial role in viral clearance and limited evidence suggests that infection may suppress the activation and activity of T cells leading to enhanced viral replication and disease (Harcourt et al., 2006). During suppression the F protein of RSV may downregulate the activity of T cells and cytokine production including the release of IFN-\u03b3 (Kondo et al., 2004, Schauer et al., 2004). RT infection also suppresses CTL immunity through the rapid loss of virus-specific CD8+ memory cells and IFN-\u03b3 release (Chang & Braciale, 2002), which is mirrored in humans by the lack of the induction of immunological memory. This effect may occur during antigen receptor signalling and varies to different extents in different T cell functions (CTL activity, cytokine release). This may result in reduced CTL activity and allow viral persistence but may also enable the maintenance of cytokine responsiveness facilitating further virus- or allergen-associated inflammation promoting enhanced disease. Despite this evidence immune suppression during infection has not yet been observed in humans. These effects may only be present in the lung and are not detectable in the blood (Braciale, 2005) and it is unknown if CD8+ T cells with this phenotype exist in the RT of humans with severe RSV infection.",

            "text": "Rat models of RSV-induced bronchiolitis have also been developed, where rats rapidly clear the virus in a similar manner to the self-limiting infection of human infants (Piedimonte et al., 1999). This model has been used to investigate the alteration of neural networks by RSV infection and infection of infant rats has enabled the analysis of the effects of early life infection (King et al., 2001). A stronger neurogenic inflammatory response develops in the LRT of infant rats than in adult rats during infection, which may explain why bronchiolitis presents in infants but as an URT infection in older subjects. Induction of inflammation involves the upregulation of NK1 in infected lungs (but not NK2 that is expressed on ASM fibres) that are activated by NANCe nerves and mediate substance P induced immunomodulation and neurogenic and cellular inflammation that may lead to edema and obstruction (King et al., 2001, Piedimonte, 2001, Tripp et al., 2002). NK1 receptors are also upregulated on T cells in bronchus-associated lymphoid tissue in response to infection, which may then be attracted into the airways and release pro-inflammatory cytokines in response to neurogenic stimulation by airborne irritants. Recurrent stimulation may lead to persistent cycles of airway inflammation and obstruction. Inhibition of NK1 or the administration of CGRP prevents RSV-induced AHR and may be potential therapeutic targets (Dakhama et al., 2005c). Neurogenic stimulation by RSV infection also induces the release of LTs from mast cells that induce mucus secretion (Wedde-Beer et al., 2002). Another alternative is that infection-induced damage may expose nerve endings and substance P and neurokinin A may then mediate ASM contraction (Jacoby, 2002). Other investigators have shown that RSV infection of rats and ferrets results in increases in cholinergic mediated contraction of ASM and reduced inhibitory NANCe responses (Larsen & Colasurdo, 1999).",

PVM replicates rapidly inducing inflammation leading to mucus plugging of the airways and overt signs of disease from URT symptoms to fatal pneumonia, which is dependent on the administered dose (Domachowske et al., 2004, Easton et al., 2004). Virus replication is associated with an influx of granulocytes and severe inflammatory bronchiolitis. We have recently established mouse models of RSV-like disease using PVM infection of neonates and adults (Hansbro et al., 2007).

A recent study using PVM in wild-type and TLR-4 deficient mice showed that there is no difference in the clinical, functional, histological and virological parameters investigated indicating that PVM infection is independent of TLR-4 signalling (Faisca et al., 2006). Anti-viral therapy with ribavirin alone has little effect, however, treatment with ribavirin in combination with the anti-inflammatory agent and the CCR1 antagonist met-RANTES substantially reduces morbidity and mortality following infection (Rosenberg et al., 2005).",

CD8+ CTLs have a major role in the clearance of primary infection in calves and lymphocyte proliferation is attenuated by infection in vitro (Keles et al., 1998, Antonis et al., 2006), whereas antibody-mediated responses are important in protection against secondary infection. The lumen of the airways become occluded with mucus and inflammatory debris and remodelling events occur that lead to breathing difficulties (Kimman et al., 1989, Viuff et al., 2002). It is likely that similar immune responses are elicited as in human infection with RSV and involve the induction of NF-kB and the generation of pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines. The interaction of viral components (F protein and dsRNA) with TLRs is known to drive the development of the immune response in cattle (reviewed in Valarcher & Taylor (2007)). As in humans and mice there are age-related differences in immune responses to infection in cattle with reduced protective and enhanced inflammatory responses in younger animals. In response to primary infection younger calves have enhanced fever, virus-specific TNF-\u03b1, IL-6 and IFN-\u03b3 release from PBMCs and reduced peripheral blood mononuclear and B cells and virus-specific IgA and neutralising antibody responses (Grell et al., 2005).",

Mutants expressing the membrane-anchored G protein segment have no impairment of replication in the URT but were attenuated at least 10 fold in the LRT and did not induce pathogenic responses in the lung (Maher et al., 2004).

By contrast cleavage of human RSV does not produce tachykinins (Valarcher et al., 2006). Deletion of various parts of the bovine F protein has shown that it is not necessary for proliferation in vivo but deficient mutants promote substantially reduced airway inflammation and eosinophil influx (Valarcher et al., 2006). The F protein is responsible for suppressing lymphocyte proliferation (Schlender et al., 2002), however, there is no effect on the expression of the eosinophil attractants RANTES or MIP-1\u03b1 in the absence of the F protein suggesting that other mechanisms may be involved in the suppression of eosinophil influx in cattle (Valarcher et al., 2006).",

The age of first infection is crucial in determining clinical outcomes and early infection may promote the development of a pro-allergic phenotype. This indicates that delaying the age of infection until later in life may be an effective therapeutic strategy. Infection induces both innate and adaptive immune responses that promote Th2 immunity and eosinophil influx into the lung that may contribute to the development of AHR. The timing of infection relative to allergen exposure and the immune phenotype of the individual may be significant in determining the effects of infection. An interesting novel concept is that RSV infection may induce the development of angiogenesis, which might exacerbate inflammatory exudation, edema and bronchial obstruction in asthma. Other new hypotheses are that RSV may induce immune suppression allowing viral persistence and latent infections that can be reactivated. Neural networks also have the potential to be involved through the induction of neurogenic inflammation.",

RV is implicated in wheeze in 80% of children > 3 years of age and 45\u201380% of adults and is responsible for 60% of cases of asthma exacerbations (Johnston et al., 1995, Nicholson et al., 1997, Atmar et al., 1998, Freymuth et al., 1999, Tan, 2005). Interestingly the peak of severe asthma exacerbations in children occurs shortly after their return to school after breaks and in adults one week later and this coincides with peaks in RV infections in the spring and fall (Longini et al., 1984). Indeed in the fall RV was present in 29% and 52% of children that were asymptomatic or were having asthma exacerbations, respectively (Johnston et al., 2005).",

To investigate this Lemanske et al. (2005) prospectively recruited a cohort of children (285) at risk of asthma based on family history and followed them for 3 years to determine the relationship between viral infections and symptoms of asthma, confirming infective episodes and etiology by PCR on nasopharyngeal aspirates. At 3 years non-infective factors such as exposure to environmental tobacco smoke, the presence of asthma in an older sibling and IgE-mediated food allergies were associated with persistent wheeze. RSV infections were also linked with an increased risk, however the strongest independent predictor of persistent childhood wheeze was an episode of RV infection associated with wheeze (OR = 10, 63%). This suggests that RV infection in infancy is associated with the development of asthma later in life. Others agree and have shown that RV infection is the primary risk factor for wheezing in children under 3 years but that atopy is more important thereafter (Heymann et al., 2004). Other recent studies have also indicated that recurrent wheezing in infants is promoted by RV and possibly to a greater extent than RSV (Lehtinen et al., 2007). A pathophysiological link between RV and asthma is indicated by the tendency of children infected with RV to be older than those infected with RSV (13 months vs 5 months) and an increased frequency to present with atopic dermatitis and blood eosinophilia (Korppi et al., 2004a). In the study by Korppi et al., children (81) hospitalized for wheezing before the age of 2 were assessed by bronchoscopy and had a prior median symptomatic period of 6 months. Of these children 40% were found to be asthmatics by the age of 3 years, and 90% of these were atopic. Early predictors of asthma were atopic dermatitis, specific IgE and inhalant allergy and RV was common during wheezing (58%). Another recent study of infants (192) under the age of 3 hospitalized with bronchiolitis identified RV and RSV in 21% and 30% of cases, respectively (Jacques et al., 2006).",

Corne et al., attempted to investigate this by recruiting couples, one of whom had asthma and determining if the asthmatics were more at risk of developing colds. They found that those with asthma were no more likely to develop colds (10% vs 9% of controls), but they were substantially more likely to develop LRT symptoms associated with these colds (43% vs 17%). This implies that viral infections in asthmatics are more likely to increase LRT inflammation (Corne et al., 2002). Other investigators have shown that asthmatic infants hospitalized with wheezing have a greater chance of testing positive for RV than non-asthmatics, which suggests that asthma sufferers may also be more susceptible to infection (Xatzipsalti et al., 2005). Furthermore, RV infection may be more long lasting in asthmatics and may persists for up to 6 weeks after hospitalization for acute asthma exacerbation and RV-induced AHR may also last for several weeks (Kling et al., 2005).",

Nevertheless reduced IFN-\u03b3 responses in subjects with asthma may promote susceptibility to infection and there is an inverse correlation between IFN-\u03b3 levels and RV persistence and symptoms in asthmatics (Gern et al., 2000).

In subjects with acute RV-induced asthma Wark et al., found that increased serum IP-10 levels but not RANTES or IL-8 was specifically associated with infection and correlated with the degree of airflow obstruction (Wark et al., 2007). These subjects also had less bronchodilatory response (increase in FEV1) to salbutamol compared to non-infective acute asthma, which correlated with levels of IP-10 in serum. IP-10 is a chemokine that binds to CXCR3 and is important in the recruitment of T cells to infected tissues. Increased levels of IP-10 can activate mast cells and cause their migration. Mast cells that are resident in the ASM are specific for asthma and also express CXCR3. Therefore, RV infection of the bronchial epithelium may lead to an early release of IP-10 that sets off a chain of events that enhance pre-existing asthmatic airway inflammation and promotes the migration and activation of mast cells into the ASM thereby worsening bronchoconstriction and reducing the response to bronchodilators.",

The activation of p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase by Rho A has been shown to play an important role in these processes (Dumitru et al., 2006). RV infection of human cell lines relevant to the RT and asthma has demonstrated that the production of many different pro-inflammatory cytokines, chemokines and molecules is induced including; eotaxins 1 and 2, IL-1\u03b2, -4, -6, -8, -16, ENA-78, IP-10, GM-CSF, TNF-\u03b1, RANTES, MCP-1, MIP-1\u03b1 and ICAM-1 (Subauste et al., 1995, Grunberg et al., 1997a, Johnston et al., 1998, Yamaya et al., 1999, Gern et al., 2000, Papadopoulos et al., 2000, Suzuki et al., 2001, Papadopoulos et al., 2001, Hosoda et al., 2002, Konno et al., 2002, Gern et al., 2003, Hall et al., 2005, Edwards et al., 2006). Of particular importance is the increased production of IL-6, -8 and -16 and eotaxin, IP-10 and RANTES, which are released upon RV infection of BECs (Papadopoulos et al., 2004). IL-6 and IL-16 participate in the maturation of B and T cells and eosinophil and macrophage chemotaxis, respectively. RANTES and eotaxin are also powerful chemoattractors of eosinophils and drive airway eosinophilic inflammation (Papadopoulos et al., 2004). IL-8 and ENA-78 and RANTES and IP-10 are potent neutrophil and T cell chemoattractants, respectively (Edwards et al., 2006). IL-8 is also linked with reduced lung function in experimental RV infection, suggesting that chemokines may be involved in asthma exacerbations (Grunberg et al., 1997b). Importantly IP-10 and RANTES are the chemokines released in the greatest quantities from BEC infected with RV (Wark unpublished). Moreover, when BECs were treated with dexamethasone IP-10 was only inhibited at the maximum dose, although RANTES and IL-6 were inhibited at all doses. This is in keeping with experimental findings that moderate doses of ICSs are effective in reducing AHR and infiltration of eosinophils, but do not prevent the accumulation of cytotoxic T cells. Therefore RV infection may induce neutrophil and T cell influx that may exacerbate allergic inflammation and which may be refractive to ICS treatment.",

Asthmatic pBECs allow a significantly greater replication of RV compared to controls. The innate response of asthmatic pBECs to RV is deficient in the release of IFN-\u03b2 (Wark et al., 2005), which promotes susceptibility to infection. This defect directly impairs the ability of the infected host cell to undergo early apoptosis and allows increased virus replication and ultimately cytolysis of infected cells. The defect is the result of altered intracellular signalling and not ICAM-1 expression or viral internalisation. The administration of exogenous IFN-\u03b2 induces apoptosis and suppresses viral replication, which identifies the potential for therapeutic intervention (Wark et al., 2005). As IFN-\u03b2 is released mostly by BECs, little IFN-\u03b2 was detected in the BALF of individuals experimentally infected with RV. Further confirmation of the importance of these pathways was provided when microarray analysis of RV-infected differentiated BECs identified 48 genes that were upregulated and most of which are involved in type I IFN pathways. The expression of these genes could be blocked by anti-IFN-\u03b2 mAB or a dsRNA inhibitor (Chen et al., 2006).",

            "text": "While viral infections initiate lower airway inflammation and asthmatics appear more susceptible these observations do not provide a link that infections increase the severity of AHR or long-term airway remodelling. Infection of pBECs clearly will initiate the release of pro-inflammatory mediators that will enhance the recruitment and trafficking of inflammatory cells to the airways. However, it is unknown whether this will affect remodelling, either directly by influencing ASM or indirectly by affecting other features of remodelling in chronic asthma. To determine if RV infection could directly influence remodelling, in vitro culture models of pBECs and fibroblasts from subjects with mild or moderate asthma and healthy controls have been employed. Fibroblasts have the potential to play a critical role in remodelling and changes in the airway matrix (Holgate et al., 2004). Infection of pBECs and fibroblasts from these subjects does not lead to the release of the known mitogenic factors TGF-\u03b2 or endothelin-1. Culture of fibroblasts with media taken from pBECs that had been infected with RV also did not induce the release of these mediators. There was also no increase in the expression of the contractile protein alpha smooth muscle actin, which may be expressed if these cells develop a contractile phenotype and there was no change in cellular morphology. These results suggest that RV infection does not induce the release of pro-remodelling factors from these cells. However, exposure of fibroblasts to both RV directly and RV conditioned pBEC media did promote inflammation with the induction of inflammatory mediators, similar to those observed in BECs. This observation agrees with the results of Oliver et al., who demonstrated that asthmatic ASM cells released significantly more IL-6 upon infection even though the virus does not replicate in these cells (Oliver et al., 2006).",

Minor group RVs, however, can infect airway epithelial cells of mice by binding to LDLPRs (Dreschers et al., 2007). A recent report (Newcomb et al., 2006), describes a mouse model of minor group RV infection with RV1B. Virus persists in mouse lungs and induces neutrophilic inflammation in the airways involving MIP-2 expression whereas major group RV does not.

Studies in mice show that palivizumab reduces viral load, acute disease and long-term lung function abnormalities (Mejias et al., 2005). In the rat model palivizumab inhibits the invasion of virus particles into the LRT epithelium and the upregulation of the NK1 receptor. This prevents acute neurogenic LRT inflammation and long-term susceptibility to inflammation that is induced by infection (Piedimonte et al., 2000, Piedimonte, 2002). A randomised controlled trial with palivizumab in children achieved a 55% reduction in RSV hospitalization. Reductions were observed in children with (39%) and without (78%) chronic lung disease (IMPACT study, 1998). A recent large prospective case-controlled study of at risk pre-term infants showed that palivizumab also protected against recurrent wheezing (13% vs 26% controls) and physician-diagnosed recurrent wheezing (8% vs 26% controls) independently of confounding variables (Simoes et al., 2007). One drawback is that escape mutants have been detected both in vitro and in vivo (Zhao et al., 2004, Zhao and Sullender, 2005), indicating that preventative strategies should be targeted at multiple epitopes, Because palivizumab is effective in preventing hospitalization in high-risk groups, optimisation of its pharmacokinetic profile, extension of its half-life and increasing its neutralising abilities would produce an even more efficacious preventative strategy for RSV-associated disease. Motavizumab is a derivative of palivizumab and is now in clinical trials. This mAb has a 20 fold increase in neutralising abilities in vitro and its use reduces viral titres by 100 fold and inhibits viral replication in the RT compared to palivizumab in rats (Wu et al., 2007). Further studies are required to establish the application of such mAbs for the prevention of asthma.",

In another small study, children with chronic lung disease who were treated with immunoglobulin 7\u201310 years previously had improved lung function, reduced atopy and RAD events (Wenzel et al., 2002).

This vaccine was developed in the 1960s but not only was it poorly effective it infamously induced more severe RSV-related disease upon natural infection in clinical trials (Kapikian et al., 1969, Kim et al., 1969). The vaccine induced high serum antibody titres that were of low neutralising activity, lymphocytes with an enhanced RSV-specific proliferative response and blood eosinophilia (Openshaw et al., 2001). These observations were repeated in mice given the same vaccine or the G protein of RSV. Enhanced disease involved eosinophilia of the lung (Srikiatkhachorn and Braciale, 1997b, Johnson and Graham, 1999, Tripp et al., 2000) and aberrant CD4+ T cells releasing Th2 cytokines (IL-4, -5, -10 and -13) (Waris et al., 1996, Srikiatkhachorn and Braciale, 1997b, Johnson and Graham, 1999, Tripp et al., 2000). Reduced IL-12 and CD8+ responses were also detected (Waris et al., 1996, Aung et al., 1999). FI-bovine RSV has also been tested in calves and also induces the development of immunopathology, ineffective neutralising antibodies and induced inflammatory responses leading to eosinophil influx into the lung and enhanced IgE production upon subsequent infection (Gershwin et al., 1998, Antonis et al., 2003, Kalina and Gershwin, 2004). As is the case with RSV in mice the FI-bovine RSV did not induce long-term T cell memory (Antonis et al., 2006). Thus it has been proposed that vaccines did not possess sufficient neutralising antibody or CTL responses and on subsequent infection the virus was not cleared but induced a potent Th2 response that exacerbated disease.",

Therefore, experimental live attenuated viruses are being developed for RSV (Karron et al., 2005) for intranasal administration during the first days of life but the immunology underlying their activity is poorly understood. Intranasal delivery would induce systemic and local responses and has the potential to promote protective responses in both the upper and lower airways. Infants (6\u20139 months) have limited immune responses to viral glycoproteins and only highly attenuated virus strains with minimal adverse side-effects can be used in this age group which are particularly susceptible to vaccine-related illnesses. These agents do however induce protective immunity even in the presence of passively acquired antibodies in mice and chimpanzees, which is dependent on CD4+ and CD8+ responses (Crowe et al., 2001). Several cold passaged, temperature sensitive attenuated viruses have been developed that protect against challenge in chimpanzees and induce protective local and systemic immunity in children (Crowe et al., 1995, Karron et al., 1997). These viruses have since been genetically engineered so that they are sufficiently attenuated for use in infants, although their efficacy against infection has not yet been determined (Karron et al., 2005). Genetic engineering is also currently in use to delete non-essential viral genes to produce other live attenuated vaccines or to insert genes to enhance immune responses, for example the insertion of GM-CSF to increase the production of pDCs and macrophages (reviewed in Mayer et al. (2007)). The assessment of attenuated viruses that induce potent protective immune responses with negligible side-effects requires extensive time consuming and expensive clinical trials. Novel prime-boost vaccination strategies with live attenuated and subunit vaccines could be used in combination to further enhance protective immunity.",

This has led to the commercialization of several vaccines, which are protective against infection in calves and their development may have applicability to human vaccines. Further, cattle may be used as the animal model in preclinical human vaccine studies. However, different bovine models have been used with different concentrations of viral inocula and routes of inoculation with passaged virus that does not induce severe disease.

These vaccines are co-administered with CD8+ and Th1 stimulating adjuvants in order to dampen Th2 responses that may be induced by the vaccine and lead to protective Th1 responses (Ellis et al., 2005). Live attenuated bovine RSV vaccines have been developed by passaging virus in cell culture and have recently been commercialized (Vangeel et al., 2006). Unlike FI-vaccines, live attenuated vaccines induce a primed memory T cell response (Antonis et al., 2006) and reduce pulmonary inflammation upon subsequent infection (Miao et al., 2004). They are administered parenterally, have equivalent efficacy as inactivated vaccines and induce protective immunity in calves (Harmeyer et al., 2006, Ellis et al., 2007). These vaccines are now used in quadrivalent therapies to protect against a number of bovine viruses (Salt et al., 2007). Although effective in cattle inactivated or attenuated bovine RSV are not suitable as vaccines for human RSV as they do not induce protection in chimpanzees (Buchholz et al., 2000).",

Nevertheless there are many promising approaches and candidates are being used to develop such vaccines, some of which are in human clinical trials to prevent infection, which if successful may be used in attempts to inhibit the development of asthma. The balance of Th1/Th2 immunity to infection determines the severity of disease where Th1 responses mediate clearance and recovery but Th2 responses induce eosinophilia and more severe symptoms. Strategies to augment Th1 responses during vaccination in early life may be useful in preventing the development of virus-induced asthma. Recent efforts have concentrated on the development of the combination of subunit vaccines with Th1-inducing adjuvants and on the development of live attenuated vaccines. The most promising approaches for developing vaccines in young infants are the use of live attenuated vaccines and recombinant viruses expressing components of target viruses.",

Pleconaril has been assessed in two Phase II clinical trials to determine its efficacy against natural colds (Hayden et al., 2003). Subjects began treatment 1\u20131.5 days after cold symptoms commenced. Those taking Pleconaril had reduced cold symptoms and duration of colds (0.5\u20131.5 days) with few side-effects. An application in the US for FDA approval for use in clinical colds was unsuccessful as it was considered that there was a lack of substantial clinical benefit and concerns about the development of resistant RV mutants.

While ICSs are effective at controlling chronic asthma they do not completely prevent acute exacerbations even in those who achieve good control and are compliant with therapy, with the majority of episodes triggered by viral infection (Reddel et al., 1999). In an attempt to prevent the recurrence of virus-induced wheeze, infants were treated intermittently with ICS or placebo when these symptoms occurred (Bisgaard et al., 2006). Treatment had no clinical effect on acute episodes of wheeze and did not influence whether children went on to develop persistent wheeze (Bisgaard et al., 2006). Another study showed that treatment of acute asthma by increasing ICS dose also did not prevent worsening of disease (FitzGerald et al., 2004). The incomplete effect of ICS in controlling virus-induced asthma was demonstrated best in adult asthmatics using experimental RV infection (Grunberg et al., 2001). Treatment reduced AHR and airway inflammation prior to infection but had no effect on the development of inflammatory changes that were associated with infection (Grunberg et al., 2001). In a systematic review glucocorticoids were suggested to have little effect in RSV disease (Black, 2003) and they also enhance viral replication and mortality in PVM infection (Rosenberg et al., 2005).",

It has recently been shown that early treatment of symptoms of worsening asthma with ICS/LABA, where the LABA has a rapid onset of action and is used to relieve symptoms, does prevent deterioration leading to severe exacerbations (O'Byrne et al., 2005). While these studies did not identify the cause of the acute triggers it is likely that the majority of these were related to virus infection and the combination of ICS/LABAs appear more effective than ICSs alone in preventing exacerbations. In vitro studies demonstrate that treatment of airway epithelial cells with ICS/LABAs has synergistic and additive effects in reducing the release of inflammatory mediators (Edwards et al., 2006). These observations may explain the efficacy of combination therapy and indicate an important role for their use. This may be particularly relevant to children where their value in controlling chronic asthma is not well defined but where AHR is known to persist following viral infection (Xepapadaki et al., 2005). It remains unknown what effect ICS/LABA treatments have on specifically preventing or treating virus-induced asthma.",

            "text": "It has recently been recognised that macrolide antibiotics in addition to their anti-microbial action have important immune modulating effects and reduce the release of inflammatory mediators from airway epithelial cells (Takizawa et al., 1997). Epithelial cells infected with RV and treated with erythromycin, showed reduced expression of ICAM-1, IL-6 and -8 (Jang et al., 2006). Initial clinical studies were, however, not promising; using experimental RV infection, treatment of healthy subjects with clarithromycin had little or no effect on the development of cold symptoms or nasal inflammation (Abisheganaden et al., 2000). However, unlike colds where the host inflammatory response in the airways is relatively mild, in conditions characterised by more intense neutrophilic inflammation, such as cystic fibrosis, macrolides appear to be effective (Ferrara et al., 2005), which has encouraged their use in asthma. In a small randomised controlled trial of infants with RSV bronchiolitis treatment with clarithromycin reduced systemic inflammation acutely and led to few wheezing episodes in the following 6 months (Tahan et al., 2007). In a large multicentre study of adults (278) with asthma, subjects were randomised to receive the ketolide, telithromycin (800 mg/d) or placebo (Johnston, 2006). Those treated with telithromycin had a greater reduction in asthma symptom scores, but there was no difference between the groups in terms of improvement in PEF rate. The trial did not document the presence of virus infection but the results suggest the effect is due to an ability to reduce inflammation in acute asthma. Further studies are required to determine if there is a specific effect on virus-induced acute asthma.",

The recent observations by Wark et al., that asthmatic BECs are more susceptible to infection with RV, which involves a deficient IFN-\u03b2 response, suggests that this may be an important therapeutic target to limit the affects of virus-associated acute asthma (Wark et al., 2005). Several trials have also assessed the role of IFN-\u03b12 treatment (1.5 \u00d7 106\u20134.5 \u00d7 107 IU/d intranasally) in experimental RV colds in healthy volunteers (Scott et al., 1982, Hayden and Gwaltney, 1984). These studies consistently showed a dose dependent improvement in symptom scores and reduced virus shedding, but treatment was associated with nasal bleeding and a lymphocytic nasal infiltrate. A similar response was observed with recombinant IFN-\u03b2 (Sperber et al., 1988). When used to treat natural colds IFN-\u03b12 reduced the frequency of colds but had at best modest effects on symptoms (Monto et al., 1986), while serine IFN-\u03b2 failed to reduce colds or improve symptoms. These modest improvements provide a proof of concept but the clinical benefit is difficult to justify in healthy individuals with mild colds. However, as is the case with the use of macrolides in asthma where the clinical effects of colds are much greater (Corne et al., 2002), efficacy may be more evident. A single case series exists for the use of IFN-\u03b1 (3 \u00d7 106 IU/d) to treat 10 stable but corticosteroid resistant asthmatics (Simon et al., 2003). Treatment resulted in improved lung function and allowed a reduction in oral corticosteroid use. However, side-effects were also common, in the first 4 weeks all subjects experienced a \u2018flu-like\u2019 illness, 9 had nausea and 5 developed headaches. By 5\u201310 months side-effects were less though 1 subject developed leukopenia severe enough to necessitate temporarily ceasing treatment. The benefits of type I IFNs now need to be assessed in the context of treatment of virus-associated acute asthma. Important issues will need to be resolved including the optimum delivery of medication, whether administration should be to the nose or the airway, how soon treatment needs to commence following the development of cold symptoms and how this may influence airway inflammation and AHR in acute asthma.",

Asthmatics are more predisposed to Th2 responses, may be more susceptible to infection and experience more severe LRT symptoms upon infection.

Early-life RSV infections, particularly those that induce severe disease, induce recurrent wheeze and bronchial obstruction and predispose to RAD and potentially asthma that persists into later life. It is possible that persistent infection affects the developing lung and immune system and predisposes to recurring RSV infections, AHR, reduced lung function and respiratory symptoms. Another alternative is that children with reduced lung function, genetic susceptibility or aberrant immune responses may be at increased risk of infection and that RSV disease is a marker of susceptibility to increased respiratory symptoms. Both of these processes may occur under different circumstances. The association with RSV is inconclusive for allergic sensitization, which may involve IgE-mediated allergy and randomised intervention studies are required to confirm this link. The mechanisms involved in RSV-induced asthma include; age of first infection, the timing of infection relative to allergic sensitization, the nature of innate and adaptive immune responses induced upon infection, latent infections and the potential involvement of pathogenetic processes such as angiogenesis and neurogenic inflammation. A combination of human studies and mouse models has been widely used to elucidate the mechanisms of how RSV infection are linked with asthma and novel models of PVM infection may be particularly useful in the future.",

In the absence of a vaccine the different processes involved in the generation of virus-associated asthma and exacerbations could be targeted by specific treatments for individual patients. Several therapeutic options are available and more are emerging. Studies should focus on how established treatments such as with ICS/LABA may modify virus-associated acute asthma and assess novel anti-inflammatory strategies including macrolides or the use of IFNs either alone or in combination to influence the course of disease.
