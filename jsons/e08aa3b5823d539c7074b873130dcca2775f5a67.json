            "text": "The coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic has emerged as one of the greatest challenges faced by humankind in the recent past. People with diabetes and related comorbidities are at increased risk of its complications and of COVID-19-related death. Older age, multi-morbidity, hyperglycaemia, cardiac injury and severe inflammatory response are predictors of poor outcome. The complex interplay between COVID-19, diabetes and the effects of related therapies is being explored. Most patients experience a mild illness with COVID-19, while people with diabetes are at increased risk of severe disease. Optimising glycaemic control and adopting measures to prevent disease spread are critical aspects. The management of mild disease is supportive, while very many immunomodulatory and antiviral therapies are being investigated for the treatment of severe disease. Several of these agents have specific considerations for use in people with diabetes. Since mass population lockdowns are considered a key step in controlling disease spread, it follows that, in addition to the direct vulnerability to severe COVID-19, people with diabetes can be affected by limited access to healthcare, insulin, other medications and blood glucose monitoring equipment. Measures to prevent disease spread at the individual and community level are the key to mitigating the rapidly escalating pandemic, while agents for chemoprophylaxis and vaccines are being explored. People with diabetes should be recognised as a vulnerable group for complicated disease and are at risk during times of disturbed social systems. Strategies are needed to safeguard the health of patients with diabetes during the pandemic. This review summarises the current knowledge and perceived challenges for prevention and management of COVID-19 in people with diabetes.",

Patients with multiple comorbidities need extra caution Continuation of good dietary practices, safe physical activities and regular glucose monitoring should be encouraged Measures such as telemedicine services and drug dispensing for extended durations or by home delivery should be adopted to reduce exposure of diabetes patients while ensuring uninterrupted continuity of care People with diabetes who develop COVID-19 should continue their routine medications unless the illness is severe For severe COVID-19 in diabetes patients, glycaemic control is best achieved with insulin SGLT2 inhibitors are best discontinued unless the illness is mild ACE inhibitors/ARBs should be continued unless contraindications develop or further evidence emerges against their use Individualised decisions should be taken on continuing aspirin and statins Research into pharmacological therapies for treatment and prevention of COVID-19 in people with diabetes is urgently needed Key points tract infections are particularly common [8] . Diabetes is associated with increased morbidity and mortality risk from pneumonia [9] , and hyperglycaemia on admission for pneumonia (>11 mmol/l) predicts poor outcome [9] . During the SARS epidemic in 2002/2003, diabetes was an independent predictor of mortality risk (OR 3.0; 95% CI 1.4, 6.3; p = 0.005) [10] . The presence of comorbidities, including diabetes, also increased mortality risk (independent of age) during the Middle East respiratory syndrome-coronavirus (MERS-CoV) epidemic in 2012 (adjusted HR 3.74; 95% CI 2.57, 5.67) [11] . In another study, diabetes had the strongest impact on mortality risk among MERS-CoV patients [12] . Similarly, among young patients with novel influenza A (H1N1) in 2009, diabetes increased the risk of intensive care unit (ICU) admissions (adjusted OR 4.72; 95% CI 1.81, 12.3) [13] .",

            "text": "Glycaemic control The importance of good glycaemic control during the COVID-19 pandemic is emphasised [49] . As this is a new viral infection, the data are limited and so expert recommendations conform with strategies used in similar epidemics [47] . Patients with mild COVID-19 can be managed with their usual glucose-lowering agents as long as they are able to eat and drink satisfactorily. Patients should adhere to the 'sick day rules' for people with diabetes [50] , and frequent monitoring of capillary glucose is important. Patients who develop severe illness are likely to need treatment modifications. Multiple factors including glycaemic status, haemodynamic stability, nutritional status, renal function, risk of hypoglycaemia, drug interactions and the availability of medications influence the decision making. There are specific concerns in relation to glucose-lowering agents when used in patients with COVID-19 (Table 1) . Metformin may be stopped in patients who are hospitalised and acutely ill, owing to the risk of lactic acidosis [51] . In severe COVID 19 infection, the hypoxic state may further increase the risk of lactic acidosis. Although there are no specific data on sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitor use during COVID-19 infection, it is advisable to withhold these during acute illness because of the increased risk of dehydration and euglycaemic ketoacidosis [52, 53] , as well as difficulties in maintaining usual perineal hygiene. Glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonist (GLP-1RA) therapy should probably be temporarily discontinued in patients with haemodynamic instability (which compromises absorption from subcutaneous sites), renal dysfunction, and gastrointestinal dysfunction (which prevents adequate oral intake). Treatment with GLP-1RAs may cause gastrointestinal side effects, predisposing to volume depletion and aspiration [54] . Dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP4) inhibitors are associated with low risk of hypoglycaemia and are relatively safe across a wide range of renal functions. DPP4 inhibitors added to basal insulin improve glycaemic control without increasing the risk of hypoglycaemia, even among hospitalised patients [55] . However, these agents are likely to be of less therapeutic benefit in patients with severe COVID-19. While patients with mild symptoms could continue DPP4 inhibitors, these should be omitted in acute severe illness and replaced with insulin if this becomes necessary. During a severe illness, fine control of blood glucose is difficult when using sulfonylureas. In such patients, sulfonylureas should be replaced with insulin. Caution with sulfonylureas also needs to be exercised if chloroquine is considered, because of risk of hypoglycaemia with both. Thiazolidinediones (e.g. pioglitazone) are a less favourable option for in-hospital management of acutely ill patients, because of fluid retention and oedema. They are contraindicated in patients with haemodynamic instability, or hepatic or cardiac dysfunction, which may be seen in severe COVID-19 infection [56] .",

For non-critically ill hospitalised patients, subcutaneous insulin therapy with basal or intermediate-acting insulin given once or twice a day, along with mealtime boluses of short-or rapid-acting insulin, is the preferred strategy for glycaemic management [57] . Sliding scale therapy should probably not be practiced as this results in greater fluctuations and poor overall control [58] . For critically ill patients, insulin therapy should be initiated with a glycaemic target of 7.8-10 mmol/l (140-180 mg/dl) [59] . Less stringent glycaemic control with target glucose concentrations >10 mmol/l (180 mg/dl) may be acceptable in terminally ill patients, in patients with severe comorbidities, and in patient care settings where frequent glucose monitoring or close nursing supervision is not feasible. Less aggressive insulin regimens aimed at simply minimising glucosuria, dehydration and electrolyte disturbances may be justifiable in such patients. Although there are no strict guidelines regarding the insulin regimen for glycaemic control in critically ill patients, intravenous insulin infusions and short or rapid-acting insulin boluses may be used. Disease severity, nutritional status, concomitant medications and trend of glycaemic fluctuations should be considered in determining insulin dosage [60] .",

MERS-CoV uses DPP4 to gain entry into host cells [76] . DPP4 inhibition mitigated inflammatory response in experimental studies [77] . It is not known if SARS-CoV-2 uses DPP4 for cell entry. To date, neither benefit nor harm has been shown in humans on DPP4 inhibitors during CoV infections. Therefore, DPP4 inhibitors could be continued, at least in mild cases of COVID-19, while potential benefit in treating CoV infection remains to be studied further [78] . Similarly, GLP-1RAs are known to have anti-inflammatory effects and have shown potential for therapeutic benefit in acute lung injury [79] . However data are limited to experimental models and their benefit, at best, remains speculative.",
