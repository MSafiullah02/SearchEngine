Results: The first outbreak peak was recorded in Japan on April 3 for those infected on March 29. Their R 0 and q were estimated respectively as 3.19 and 99.32% in Wuhan. In Japan, these were estimated around the peak as 2.96 and 99.99%. Discussion and Conclusion: By introducing a very high proportion of asymptomatic cases, the two inconsistent phenomena might be resolved. Especially in Japan, the asymptomatic cases were 60 times higher than those of China.",
