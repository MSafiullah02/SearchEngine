On the basis of morphology alone, a host of viruses have been discovered, e. g. Norwalk agents, rotaviruses, astroviruses, caliciviruscs, coronaviruses and small round virus (srv) particles (27) . Frequently, adenovirus particles were visualised in the diarrhoeal stools. However, their aetioiogical significance was not known, as adenoviruses were isolated in culture from both diarrhoeal cases and matched controls with equal frequency (20, 52) . Soon, it became apparent that most of the adenoviruses visualised in the diarrhoeM stools by electron microscopy, could not be cultivated in the cell culture systems normally used to cultivate adenoviruses (5, 28, 48) . These viruses were referred to as fastidious or enteric adenoviruses (14, 19, 33) .",

Although some strains of E Ads produce an adenovirus-like cytopathogenic effect (CPE) on primary inoculation into these cell lines, they can not be serially passaged in them (8, 10) . Most strains undergo an abortive infection in a very small proportion of cells ( < 1 of 10,000 cells), which can be demonstrated b y specific immunofluoreseent staining (39) . TArIFf' and STRAUS (40) investigated the reasons for the lack of growth of E Ads in K B and Hela cells. Their data suggested an early replicative block in the growth cycle of the virus. However, there is an indication that E Ads express some early synthetic functions as they help adeno associated viruses (a group of defective parvoviruses) to replicate in these cells: these viruses normally require early helper functions from established adenoviruses for their growth.",

However, Graham 293 cells are most widely used for diagnostic work, probably due to their higher susceptibility to E Ad infection. It is a human embryonic kidney cell line transformed b y a type 5 adenovirus (15) . It is likely that early adenovirus 5 gene functions expressed in Graham 293 cells may be providing helper functions for E Ads.

They found variations within laboratories in the growth of different strains, and between laboratories in the growth of the same strains. They Mso found differences in cell line susceptibility to virus growth in different batches of the same cell line obtained from the same company. This may explain the difficulty of growing Ad40 strains in Graham 293 cells by some workers (9, 42) , but not by others (8) . These results suggest that caution should be exercised in comparing the results of various laboratories when different strains of viruses and different batches and types of cell lines are used. Other interesting observations also emerged from the study. Some viruses multiplied in the cells without producing a CPE. This suggests the need for blind passages until a CPE becomes apparent, or the need to look for evidence of growth by specific immunofluorescence. It was also observed that incorporation of trypsin in the maintainance medium and rolling of cultures with tertiary eynomolgous monkey kidney cells enhanced virus growth. Also notable was that Chang cells and 293 cells produced CPE more readily when incubated in stationary culture than in roller culture. These observations should establish guidelines for optimal culture conditions for E Ads.",

(25) and KIDO (24) using a eombination of restriction enzymes have shown the existence of genome variants among Ad40 and Ad41 strains. When 26 Ad40 strains from 3 different, continents were studied, M1 of them had genome profiles typical of Ad40 after analysis with endonnctease SmaI. However, when further analysed with six other enzymes, namely B a m H I , Ecol~I, BglI, XhoI, SstI and t t i n d I I I , at least two different restriction profiles were evident for each enzyme. Nineteen strains had the same combination of profiles for all the enzymes. In the remaining 7 strains there were five other genome types. These variants had a different distribution pattern in different continents. Of particular interest was that strains Dugan and Hovi-X, which are indistinguishable in neutralisation test (10) h~ud different genome profiles with all the restriction enzymes except SmaI. Based on these results, KIDD et al. (25) proposed that Ad40 strains with genome profiles of Hovi-X virus be called Ad40 and its variants be given letter designations such as Ad40a, Ad40b etc.",

The orientations of E Ad genomes were determined by hybridisation with the genome of a type 2 adenovirus. Physical maps constructed in this manner permitted examination of homologies among E Ads and type 2 adenovirus. The data revealed substantiM homology between Ad40 and Ad4t, but considerably less homology between E Ads and type 2 adenovirus, Similarly, ALLA~D et al.

The Ad41 specific clone corresponded to the 5' p o t i o n of early region 1 ~, the region involved in growth restriction in human embryonic kidney cell line. In addition, restriction maps were constructed for six different restriction endonueleases that included the two enzymes, Barn H I and E c o R I used by TAKIFF et al. (41) . The location of fragments less than one kilobase for Barn H I map was at variance with the location of the same in the B a m H I map for Ad41 published by TAKIFF et al. (41) .

In addition, these viruses possess a group-specific antigen, which is located on the interior of the virus capsid. Likewise, E Ads possess type-specific antigens as determined by neutralisation test (10) and type-specific ELISA (42, 43) . In addition, they possess antigens for HA (10).

The reason for this is not clear. Again, the two serotypes cannot be distinguished by haemagglutination inhibition (HI) test (10) or by solid phase immune electron microscopy (SPIEM) (38) . E Ads do not cross-react with established adenoviruses either in neutralisation test or in H I test (10). However, Svn~ssoN et al. (38) observed a one-way cross-reaction between adenovirus type 4 antiserum and Ad40 in SPIEM. Similarly with ncutralisation test and H I test, GAI~Y JR. et al.

In addition, adenovirus particles were visualised within the nucleus of small intestinal mucosal cells in a fatal case of adenovirus gastroenteritis. In the same child, crystalline arrays of virus particles were observed in the small intestinal mucosa which is suggestive of their replication (4:9).",

The incidence of infection varies between 4 and 12 per cent suggesting that they are the most frequent cause of viral diarrhoea next to rotavirus. However, one study stands out with an unusually high isolation rate of 52 per cent (51) . This was conducted in hospitalised children in Baltimore, U.S.A., between October 1980 and the beginning of January 1981 (late fall). This is a period when diarrhoeM diseases are frequently asso elated with unknown aetiologies in this geographical area. This high isolation rate may have been due to the use of more sensitive virologic technique, differences in hospital environment and patient population or the chance occurrence of an epidemic during the study period. Ad40 and Ad41 have been isolated with approximately equal frequency in many studies (I0, 42), although a study conducted in Canada showed a preponderance of Ad40 (8) .",

(Virology 140, 197--200, 1985) studied the homology of DNAs from Ad40 and Ad41 by liquid hybridisation and found it to be 62--69 per cent.. In view of this high homology and the similarity of these two viruses in other properties, e.g. restricted host ceil range, cross-reactivity in immunological assays and association with diarrhoea, VAX Loox and WADELL (personal communication) recommend that Ad40 and Ad41 be placed into a single subgroup F instead of two different subgroups F and G (in accordance with the criteria of subgroup classification for other adenovirus serotypes of subgroups A--E).
