Spatial networks are, however, extremely relevant in our daily lives, and a large body of research exists to show that the distances between nodes greatly influence the cost and probability of establishing and maintaining a link. A random geometric graph (RGG) is the main type of synthetic network model used to mimic the statistical properties and behavior of many social networks. We propose a model, called REDS, that extends energy-constrained RGGs to account for the synergic effect of sharing the cost of a link with our neighbors, as is observed in real relational networks. We apply both the standard Watts-Strogatz rewiring procedure and another method that conserves the degree distribution of the network. The second technique was developed to eliminate unwanted forms of spatial correlation between the degree of nodes that are affected by rewiring, limiting the effect on other properties such as clustering and assortativity. We analyze both the statistical properties of these two network types and their epidemiological behavior when used as a substrate for a standard susceptible-infected-susceptible compartmental model. We consider and discuss the differences in properties and behavior between RGGs and REDS as rewiring increases and as infection parameters are changed. We report considerable differences both between the network types and, in the case of REDS, between the two rewiring schemes. We conclude that REDS represent, with the application of these rewiring mechanisms, extremely useful and interesting tools in the study of social and epidemiological phenomena in synthetic complex networks.",

Despite the important relationship between space and structure, most social network models and empirical analyses of actual social networks are limited to their relational aspects, while the physical distance between network nodes is abstracted. However, in almost all aspects of our life we interact with and through spatial networks of all kinds, from contact networks of friendships and sexual partners to utility distribution networks of transports, power, water, and gas, among others. In the last decade, thanks to the availability of network data in many disciplines, spatial complex networks have also received their share of attention (for an excellent recent review see [3] ), although significantly less than relational complex networks.",

In a similar manner, communities of individuals in social networks are characterized by the fact that their members, in addition to being densely connected, mostly belong to a given geographical area, at least in the case of groups of a limited size [6] . A related effect is the observed negative correlation between phone calls and distance: people that are closer call each other more often [7, 8] .",

Once they are connected, people residing in a limited geographical area may interact more easily and more often for the same reasons. These considerations suggest that the introduction of high-speed, location-independent communication technologies does not completely suppress the role of physical space in social networks. While there is an increasing awareness of the role of physical space in modern social networks, especially in the mobile communication field, there has been comparatively less work on complex network models that take these factors into account [3] . The present paper is a step in this direction.",

In the other models [10, 11] nodes are located in a given metric space and connections between nodes are influenced by the distance separating them. Our proposed model, called REDS, falls within this category and, like several other spatial network models, is an extension of random geometric graphs (RGGs), the canonical spatial network model [3, 12] . The main REDS features were briefly introduced in [13] . The REDS acronym relates to the four aspects of a social system that influence network topology: the social reach, energy, and synergy parameters of the network, and the distance between pairs of nodes. The resulting REDS networks resemble real-life social networks from a statistical point of view. However, standard REDS networks are not small worlds. While they are highly clustered, they have relatively long characteristic path lengths, like lattices. In order to model social processes such as the flow of information or disease in a structured population, it is desirable to rely on a random network model that exhibits tunable analogs of all the major properties of real social networks. Consequently, in this paper we explore how readily \"small-world REDS\" can be constructed through a Watts-Strogatz-style rewiring process [14] , extending and generalizing our first attempts [15] .",

There is an extensive mathematical literature on RGGs, particularly in the context of continuum percolation [3, 12, 16, 17] . In this paper, we generate an N -node RGG with distance threshold, R, distributing the N nodes uniformly at random in the unit space [0,1] 2 and creating an edge between every pair of nodes separated by a distance smaller than R. The average degree is estimated as k = \u03c0NR 2 , while the degree distribution for a sufficiently large number of nodes is approximated by the Poisson distribution with parameter \u03bb =k [16] . The average clustering and the assortativity coefficient values tend to 1 \u2212 3 \u221a 3 4\u03c0 \u223c 0.5865 [16, 17] . Many more properties of RGGs are derived in [12] .",

Understanding diffusion and contagion processes in the real world is of the utmost importance. For instance, ideas, rumors, or viruses all can spread, in different ways, through the same network substrates. It is thus of interest to simulate contagion processes on the family of networks presented here. For this reason, we ran a simple SIS compartmental model on both unmodified and rewired REDS and RGG networks, varying the parameter \u03b2 (probability that a susceptible node at time t may become infected at time t + 1) while keeping \u03bc (probability that an infected node may recover and become susceptible again at time t) constant at 1.0. This implies that recovery is automatic after one simulator time step. All simulations were started by selecting uniformly at random 50 nodes out of 1000 for each network and declaring them infected. The simulation is allowed to run for a minimum of 300 time steps. There are three possible outcomes: (i) the outbreak can die out when there are no infected nodes left, (ii) the infection can still be developing and not have reached a stable prevalence, or (iii) the infection can stabilize at a given prevalence level. We started with a group of 100 REDS networks with N = 10 3 , R = 0.08, and E = 0.124 and 100 RGGs with N = 10 3 and R \u2248 0.05. Model parameter values have been chosen in order to obtain, on average, the same mean degree, i.e.,k = 8, for both network constructions. For each of these networks, we prepared randomly rewired variants, using both standard and conservative rewiring, for rewiring probabilities ranging from p = 1 to 10 \u22124 . For each rewiring scheme and value of the rewiring parameter we built 100 networks. In total we counted 8600 networks, and the SIS model was run 100 times on each one.",

[20] . This is the critical value of the parameter \u03b2 above which an outbreak will be successful and becomes an epidemic. For values of \u03b2 < \u03b2 c , instead, an outbreak will die out. In our case, this shows that REDS networks are consistently more vulnerable to contagion than RGGs. The effect of the two rewiring schemes on \u03b2 c is initially very small, but, as the FIG. 4 . Median outbreak size for REDS (left) and RGG networks (right), using either the standard (top) or conservative (bottom) rewiring method. Each point in the graph is subject to a probability, p, of rewiring for a range of transmission probabilities, \u03b2: Each cell in these heat maps represents the average size of successful outbreaks, i.e., the median size of the final stable population of infected nodes for 100 outbreaks (one outbreak on each of 100 different networks), ignoring outbreaks that fail. Cells shaded gray represent conditions under which all 100 simulated outbreaks failed. rewiring probability p increases and exceeds levels associated with the small-world effect (p \u2248 0.05), we see an increase in \u03b2 c that is more pronounced in the case of standard rewiring. In other words, the network becomes less vulnerable to contagion when edges are randomized to a significant extent, but the smaller increase in case of conservative rewiring indicates that the influence of random rewiring is only partly accounted for by distortion of the degree distribution. An important part is also played by the erosion of other aspects of network structure, which can occur in both types of rewiring.",

For low values of p and supercritical values of \u03b2, the contours are widely spaced, indicating that the outbreak size grows slowly with increasing values of \u03b2. For high values of p and supercritical values of \u03b2, instead, the tightly packed contour lines indicate that the outbreak grows rapidly, spreading widely across the network even for marginally supercritical values of \u03b2. Intermediate values of p in the small-world regime show a \"sweet spot\" that combines a low critical \u03b2 threshold with a large outbreak size. In the case of conservative rewiring, the effect is less pronounced, but the behavior is substantially identical. RGGs seem insensitive to the differences between the rewiring schemes.",

An interesting behavior can be seen in the case of REDS with conservative rewiring in Fig. 5 , where the outbreaks do not simply become easier, as in all other cases.

We find that infections in REDS networks seem to transition from the disease-absorbent state where no outbreak is successful to the epidemic state less sharply, whereas RGGs seem to require a higher infection pressure before this transition can take place. The differences between the two rewiring schemes seem less pronounced in this case than for the network analysis coefficients, with the conservative approach showing only a marginal decrease in the value of \u03b2.

            "text": "In this paper we have considered several aspects of the proposed REDS model, and discussed two methods that allow the introduction of shortcuts within these networks to better mimic the topological properties observed in real social networks. Through the use of a common epidemiological model, we showed that the different network properties derived from the application of the two rewiring schemes yields behaviors that are distinct and interesting, identifying the REDS model as a valid addition to the available types of synthetic networks at our disposal when studying complex social phenomena. The ability to \"tune\" the properties of the network model to such an extent makes REDS appealing for applications in epidemiology where changes in network topology are considered. This flexibility would be instrumental in evaluating how the introduction of long distance links affects disease spread in animal trade networks. An example of this would be the case of the livestock trade network of a developing country, where increased urbanization has introduced, through improved transportation infrastructure, feasible long distance links. In this case, what was essentially a \"mostly local\" market has now become a global one, with interesting epidemiological implications. Using empirical data to tune the parameters of our model could also be useful when approximating other real world scenarios and for comparing its accuracy with existing models present in the literature, but further work is necessary to determine which network measures should be considered. A lot of work has gone into the study of real world network characteristics [21] [22] [23] , but the possibility of creating an ensemble of networks that gradually shift from purely localized to global movements would undoubtedly allow for a better understanding of the influence and effect of this factor, or at least provide an effective null model for comparison. The visible differences between the behavior and properties of REDS and RGG networks clearly show that the former is not simply an extension of the latter, but a completely different and valuable tool altogether.",
