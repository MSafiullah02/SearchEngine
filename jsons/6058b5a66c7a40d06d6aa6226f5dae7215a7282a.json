Illness severity was lower than in non-HCWs. Depression, anxiety, and psychological distress were common in HCWs during the coronavirus disease 2019 outbreak. The strongest evidence on risk factors was on PPE use and decreased infection risk. The association was most consistent for masks but was also observed for gloves, gowns, eye protection, and handwashing; evidence suggested a doseresponse relationship. No study evaluated PPE reuse. Certain exposures (such as involvement in intubations, direct patient contact, or contact with bodily secretions) were associated with increased infection risk.

The proportion of HCWs meeting clinically relevant (that is, moderate or severe) thresholds was 14% to 15% for depression (40, 80) , 12% to 24% for anxiety (40, 46, 80) , 30% to 39% for psychological distress (28, 40, 80) , 8% to 60% for sleep issues (40, 59) , and 29% (36) for a composite mental health outcome. Female sex (28, 40, 80) and direct contact with cases (40, 46, 51, 80) were associated with increased likelihood of mental health issues; effect of HCW role on risk was inconsistent (28, 36, 80) . Methodological limitations included no baseline symptom information, no non-HCW comparison groups, and not controlling for work exposures. One cross-sectional study (843 persons) found a high prevalence of anxiety (34%) and psychological distress (29%) in family members of HCWs (79) .",

One study evaluated risk factors for COVID-19 in 72 exposed HCWs (clinicians and nurses) in Wuhan, China, who had acute symptoms (61). The median age was 31 years, and 69% of HCWs were female; PCR-confirmed COVID-19 occurred in 38.9% (28 of 72 HCWs) . Risk factors were working in a high risk versus general department (relative risk [RR], 2.13 [CI, 1.45 to 3.95] ), suboptimal handwashing before or after patient contact (RR, 3.10 [CI, 1.43 to 6.73 ] and 2.82 [CI, 1.11 to 7.18] , respectively), longer work hours (log-rank P = 0.02), and improper PPE use (RR, 2.82 [CI, 1.11 to 7.18] ). Such procedures as endotracheal tube removal, cardiopulmonary resuscitation, fiberoptic bronchoscopy, and sputum suction were not associated with increased risk. Having a diagnosed family member was associated with increased risk (RR, 2.76 [CI 2.02 to 3.77] ), suggesting that some HCW infections may have been acquired outside the hospital. The study was susceptible to recall bias, it was unclear whether risk estimates were adjusted, and some estimates were imprecise. Another study evaluated 41 HCWs exposed to a patient with COVID-19 and an aerosol-generating procedure for 10 or more minutes at a distance of 2 meters or less (55). Eighty-five percent of HCWs used a surgical mask, and 15% used an N95 respirator. No COVID-19 cases occurred; therefore, it was not possible to draw conclusions about effects of mask type. One other study reported a strong association between N95 respirator use and decreased COVID-19 risk, but had serious limitations (70). Mask use was based on the department worked (not on individual use), departments varied in other infection control measures (such as handwashing), and estimates were very imprecise.",

Exposure during endotracheal intubation was strongly and consistently associated with increased risk for HCW SARS-CoV-1 infections in 6 studies ( Table 1 ) (26, 30, 49, 50, 58, 60) . Of these, 4 studies found exposure during endotracheal intubation to be independently associated with risk (26, 30, 58, 60) . One study (50) found oxygen mask manipulation to be associated with increased risk for infection in a univariate analysis, but 2 other studies (60, 66) found that oxygen mask manipulation or oxygen administration were not independent predictors. Few studies evaluated risks associated with other procedures involving oxygen administration, such as noninvasive positive-pressure ventilation (30, 50, 60) , high-frequency oscillatory ventilation (30) , nebulizer treatment (50, 60), manual ventilation (50), high-flow oxygen (60), or mechanical ventilation (60), and estimates were often imprecise. Other procedures associated with increased risk but only evaluated in 1 or 2 studies each were electrocardiography (50, 60), chest compressions (49, 60), and suctioning before intubation (50). In most studies, direct patient contact was associated with increased risk compared with less direct contact, though some inconsistency was present (26, 33, 41, 49, 57, 58, 62, 66, 72) . Other exposures associated with increased risk for infections in HCWs were exposure of eyes or mucous membranes to patient bodily fluids (60, 64), contact with more severely ill patients (60), contact with a \"super spreading\" patient (26) , closer proximity to infected patients (58, 62, 64, 75) , and contact with respiratory secretions (49, 52). Evidence on the association between duration of contact with patients and risk for infection was inconsistent (52, 60, 64, 66) .",

Four studies found N95 respirators to be associated with decreased risk versus surgical masks in unadjusted analyses (23, 49, 50, 60) . Evidence was inconsistent on the effectiveness of multiple masks versus a single mask (26, 49) . Most studies found an association between use of gloves (49, 50, 56, 58, 60, 65, 66, 72, 78), gowns (41, 50, 52, 56, 60, 65, 66, 78) , eye protection (23, 26, 41, 49, 52, 58, 60, 78) , or shoe covers (26, 78) and decreased risk for HCW infections ( Table 3) . In some studies, individual PPE measures were not included in multivariate models, but information on the degree of correlation between PPE measures was lacking. When evaluated as \"inconsistent use of more than one type of PPE,\" 1 study found a strong, independent association with increased risk for HCW infection (adjusted OR 5.06, 95% CI 5.06 to 598.92) (41). Studies also found full PPE use (gloves, mask, gown, and eye protection) to be associated with reduced infection risk versus partial PPE (33, 56, 65, 78) ; some studies found a dose-response relationship between more frequent or consistent PPE use and decreased risk (26, 33, 41, 78) . Handwashing was associated with decreased risk for SARS-CoV-1 infection in most studies (41, 52, 56, 57, 65, 66, 72) , but there was no association in others (26, 56) , and handwashing was not included in some multivariate models (26, 52) . Nasal washing was not independently associated with decreased risk for infection in HCWs in 3 studies (26, 49, 52) . No study evaluated the association between reuse of PPE and infection risk. One study found perceived inadequacy of PPE supplies associated with increased risk for HCW infections (41). Infection control training and education were consistently associated with decreased infection risk, though this finding was not always retained in multivariate models (Table 3 ) (26, 41, 49, 57, 58) .",

            "text": "This rapid, living review summarizes the evidence on the burden of and risk factors for HCW coronavirus infections. Health care workers account for a significant proportion of infections in these outbreaks. Exposed HCWs may experience a high incidence of infections, particularly for unprotected and repeated exposures, though they appear to experience less severe illness and mortality than non-HCWs, possibly related to younger age and fewer comorbid conditions. Evidence that depression, anxiety, and psychological distress are common in HCWs in the COVID-19 outbreak is consistent with findings from the SARS-1 outbreak (83-90). Evidence on risk factors for coronavirus infections in HCWs is primarily available for SARS-CoV-1, with the strongest evidence indicating an association between PPE use versus nonuse and decreased risk. The association was most consistent for masks but was also observed for gloves, gowns, and eye protection, as well as handwashing. There was evidence that more consistent and full use of recommended PPE measures was associated with decreased risk for infection, suggesting a dose-response relationship, and evidence that N95 respirators might be associated with decreased risk for infection versus surgical masks. Evidence also indicated an association between certain exposures (such as involvement in intubations, direct contact with infected Our findings are generally consistent with prior reviews on risk factors for respiratory infections in HCWs, including PPE use (91) (92) (93) (94) (95) (96) . It differs from prior reviews by including recent evidence on risk factors (including those related to SARS-CoV-2 infections), focusing on coronavirus infections, excluding surrogate markers for transmission risk, evaluating a broader array of potential risk factors, and including a more comprehensive set of relevant studies. In addition, we implemented living review processes to incorporate new evidence on an ongoing basis.",

Many studies on the burden of SARS-CoV-2 infections are case series and epidemiologic evaluations; evaluations of clinical cohorts of exposed HCWs are lacking. Studies on SARS-CoV-2 infections in HCWs that reported mental health or sleep outcomes used a cross-sectional design, did not control for baseline status, and did not include a non-HCW comparison group. Almost all studies on risk factors were retrospective and susceptible to recall bias with regard to PPE use and other factors. Some risk factor studies did not control for confounders, and those that did had limited ability to control for exposure intensity and frequency. Few studies that analyzed risk factors in multivariate models addressed collinearity (97), complicating interpretation for potentially correlated risk factors (for example, use of different types of PPE). Case-control studies did not match cases and controls on such factors as age, sex, or HCW role. Applicability of evidence on SARS-CoV-1 and MERS-CoV infections to SARS-CoV-2 is uncertain, owing to decreased transmission propensity, greater illness severity, or variability in affected populations. Most evidence on SARS-CoV-2 in HCWs is from China; studies from other settings, including those with de-creased availability or use of infection prevention and control measures, are needed.",

Studies evaluating mental health and other outcomes should control for baseline status, include non-HCW controls, and incorporate longitudinal follow-up. Recovered HCWs require evaluation to understand outcomes over time (such as after return to work). For assessing SARS-CoV-2 infection risk factors, studies that prospectively measure exposures, PPE use, and other factors would increase measurement accuracy, reduce recall bias, and enable analyses that minimize confounding. Multivariate analyses of risk factors should account for potential collinearity. Given current limitations related to PPE supply, research on effects of PPE reuse is a priority (98).
