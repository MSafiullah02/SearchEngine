Our findings show that early lockdowns shifts the epidemic in time while, beyond a critical value of the lockdown strength, the epidemic restarts after lifting the restrictions. We investigate the effects of different lockdown scenarios and exit mechanisms by accounting for two fundamental sources of heterogeneity within the model: geography and demography. We consider Italian Regions as separate administrative entities, in which social interactions between age cohorts occur. Due to the sparsity of the mobility matrix, epidemics tend to develop independently in different regions. Finally, we show how disregarding the specific structure of social contacts could lead to severe underestimation of post-lockdown effects, while specific age cohort based measures can sustain the mitigation of rebound effects. Our model is general, and it highlights the effects of key parameters on non-pharmaceutical mitigation mechanisms for epidemics.",

At present, although the World Health Organization (WHO) organizes regular calls for Covid-19 modelers to compare strategies and outcomes, policymakers barely handle the discrepancies between the proposed models. 1 To contain the Covid-19 epidemic, governments worldwide have adopted severe social distancing policies, ranging from partial to total population lockdown [2] . Restrictions have led to a sudden stop of economic activities in many sectors, while the majority of Covid-19 infections affect active population (i.e. the age cohort between 1564 years) [3] .

Our goal is general in nature, since our inspection of geographical mobility and social interactions across age cohorts allows us to focus on two relevant decomposability conditions, under which partial dynamics influence the overall configuration of the system (see, e.g., [5, 6, 7, 8] ). Hence, we analyze how mobility restriction measures and the timing of the lockdown release affect the total fraction of infected, the peak prevalence, and, possibly, the delay of the epidemic. Our analysis identifies two fundamental sources of heterogeneity in the diffusion process: regional boundaries and age cohorts [4] . We show how such dimensions can shape policy interventions aiming at containing the epidemic, irrespective of any detailed quantitative predictions. Then, we point out how disregarding such dimensions would affect exit scenarios.",

Notwithstanding detailed quantitative information and relevant medical issues are not addressed here, our work still reveals how a simple and parsimonious compartimental model based on geographical and age classes uncovers relevant aspects which may help guiding decision makers in balancing the restrictions of the lockdown phase and the timing of its release. First, we show that early lockdowns shift the epidemic in time and that the delay is proportional to the anticipation time with an intensity which grows with the strength of the lockdown. Beyond a critical threshold, the epidemic fully recovers its strength as soon as the lockdown is lifted. Second, we show how the sparsity of the matrix representing mobility flows across administrative regions implies that once the epidemic has started, it then develops independently in different regions. In particular, the sparsity of the inter-regional mobility matrix accounts for the delays observed across regions. Finally, we consider social contact heterogeneity between age cohorts and we find that the structure of social contacts is of primarily importance to estimate post-lockdown effects, that is, age based strategies are a necessary ingredient to mitigate rebound effects.",

Not to mention the difficulties in assessing the impact of variability in social habits during the epidemics [10, 14] . Moreover, especially in the early phases of the epidemici.e. the ones characterised by an exponential growth -different models sharing a given reproduction number R 0 can fit the data with equivalent accuracy (see Sec. 8.1). For these reasons, our aim is to focus on some fundamental qualitative scenarios and not in the detailed predictions, we adapt the SIR model, the most basic epidemic model for flu-like epidemics, to the observed data available in the Italian case.",

We analyze an extensive data set on Facebook mobility data 2 [19] ; our analysis confirms that the lockdown has reduced both the travelled distance and the flow of travelling people. We consider the effects of such lockdown measures on the parameters of our model. Lockdowns are non-pharmaceutical measures; hence the rate \u03b3 is the most unaffected, since it is related to the \"medical\" evolution of the disease. Analogous arguments apply to the rate h of exiting a condition serious enough to be observed and to the probability \u03c1 of being observed by the national healthcare system (although \u03c1 could be influenced variations in testing schemes and alert thresholds). On the other hand, the transmission coefficient \u03b2 can be thought as the product C\u03bb of a contact rate C times a disease-dependent transmission probability \u03bb. Hence, if we assume that the speed of Covid-19 mutation is irrelevant on our timescales, lockdown strategies mostly influence \u03b2 by reducing the contact rate C among individuals.",

Conversely, lifting the lockdown too soon can make epidemic start again and reach values higher than the ones before the release. A peculiar and counter-intuitive effect can be generated if the lockdown is anticipated: in fact, a too early lockdown delays the start of the epidemic without attenuating its severity (see Sec. 8.2). In other words, an early lockdown buys time, but it postpones the problem without mitigating its severity.",

Thus, after t Lock the system stays stationary until the quarantine is released at t Unlock ; at this point the epidemic starts growing again as it was before the lockdown.

While the delay in the beginning of the infection is due to the different interaction among regions, once an epidemic has started it grows exponentially and the intake of external infected people becomes quickly irrelevant (see Sec. 8.6). As a consequence, the growth curves of the epidemic variables should tend to the same shape (see Sec. 8.5). Coherently, looking at the regional info graphics released by the Italian National Healthcare Institute (ISS) [20] , one may notice that they have a similar shape but different starting date (see Fig. 3 ). Such observation can be justified as follows: Italian regions are independent administrative units, where most of the population tend to work inside the resident region [24] . Hence, epidemics propagate from region to region via the fewer inter-regional exchanges (notice that Lombardy is among the Italian regions most involved in international trade connections [25] , hence it appears as one of the most probable candidate for the start of the Italian epidemic). More practically, we estimate these delays by minimizing the distance among the observed curves (see also Sec. 8.4); results are reported in Tab. 2.

Notice that, once an outbreak begins, the epidemic dynamics in a region i is essentially uncorrelated with the epidemic spreading of any other region j = i. Therefore, it could be safe and appropriate to decide the lockdown release time on a regional basis, instead of lifting restrictions throughout Italy at the same time. Indeed, it could be unreasonabile to keep locked the regions where the epidemic started earlier; on the contrary, regions where the epidemic began with some delay could experience a strong rebound when subjected to a premature lockdown lifting. In Fig. 3 we show the effects of lifting the lockdown at both regional (Async) and national (Sync) level in Lazio and Lombardy. Since not only epidemics, but also the ruin of an economy is a non-linear process, the Sync scenario can turn out to be even more disruptive than the epidemic itself (see also Fig. 2 ). Notice that analogous arguments hold -mutatis mutandis -also for the world/countries scenario. Tab. 2). Lower panels: sketch of an Async(hronous) exit strategy (i.e. each region releases the lockdown following its own policy) respect to a Sync(hronous) exit strategy (i.e. the lockdown release follows the same policy, but applied to a nation wide scale ). In particular, t Sync corresponds to releasing the lockdown in all the region after the peak has fallen by 30% , while t Async i corresponds to releasing the lockdown in the i th region after the peak of such region has fallen by 30%.",

Since the transmission coefficient is proportional to the contact rate of individuals, the rates of social mixing among different age classes could represent another important source of heterogeneity. This information has been estimated either through large-scales surveys [23] or through virtual populations modeling [27] . While the POLYMOD [23] matrices have been extensively used to estimate the cost-effectiveness of vaccination for different age-classes during the 2009 H1N1 pandemic [28, 29] , here they are used to support the design of lockdown measures and exit strategies. Hence, to account for age classes, we extend our model by rewriting the transmission coefficient as \u03b2C (see Sec. 8.7), where \u03b2 is the transmission probability of the infection, and C is the sociological matrix describing the contact patterns typical of a given country. For lack of further information, we assume \u03b2 constant among age classes and C as in [23] . To simplify the analysis, we gather POLYMOD age groups into three classes: Y oung (00 \u2212 19), M iddle (20 \u2212 69) and Elderly (70+) (see Tab 3 ). Such aggregation puts together the most \"contactful\" classes (00 \u2212 19), the classes with the highest mortality risk (70+) [20] , and a god approximation of the active population (20 \u2212 69). Fig. 4 shows how the percentage of people with visible symptoms (O) varies once the age class heterogeneity has been added into the model. Notice that, at difference of fig. 2 , fully releasing the lockdown results in a conspicuous rebound of the epidemics, that reaches values even more severe than the pre-exit peak. Thus, models not considering heterogeneities could severely mis-forecast the post-exit dynamics. on the other hand, introducing the age structure in the model allows to set up different exit strategies based on age-targeted policies for dampening a possible upturn of contagion. Specifically, quarantine measures applied to only elderly people may limit the impact of a renewed upward phase, while maintaining lockdown restrictions to all classes except the middle age class (20-69) could be enough to smooth and lessen the propagation of contagion in the post-lockdown phase. Remember that we are using mock-up exit strategies that lead to worst-case scenarios: in real life, community measures and physical distancing, infection prevention and control in the community, personal hygiene habits and face mask usage could strongly contribute to the dampening of the epidemics [21] .",

We reveal how the promptness of lockdown measures has a main effect on the timing of the contagion. Strict social distancing policies reduce the extent of contagion during the lockdown period, but full recover of the contagion occurs once such measures are relaxed. Moreover, we show how local dynamics at regional level can be inappropriately masked when observing the aggregate national system. Regional heterogeneity lowers and widens the curve of the contagion thus determining a shift forward in time for its peak at the aggregate national level. Moreover, by analyzing mobility data, we find that, due to the sparsity of interconnections across regions, contagion develops independently within each region once the epidemic has started. This, in turn, contributes to account for the delays observed in the alignment of the contagion curves across different geographical areas. The independence of regional dynamics allows both to design regional exit strategies almost independently and to maintain -with the appropriate security measures -the movements of goods among the regions. The same reasoning valid for the Italy/regions system can be applied to the world/country system. Finally, we investigate the structure of social contacts to detect the role of different age classes in the spreading of contagion. Both young people (0-19) and elderly people (70+) are the most interconnected classes, and therefore their behavior significantly affects the post-lockdown phase. We show that while confirming quarantine policies only for elderly people can limit the possibility of a renewed upward phase in the contagion dynamics, relaxing the lockdown measures for the middle age class (20-69) can be enough to smooth and lessen the propagation of contagion in the post-lockdown phase.",

In particular, we show how the timeline of post-lockdown measures can benefit from the inclusion of compartmental aspects, such as geographical and age classes. This feature is general, and it can sustain simulations on specific restrictions, such as those targeting specific age cohorts, especially the most fragile (70+), enforcing social distancing while containing the overall burden on the economy.",

On the other hand, slowing down the epidemic implies that lifting the lockdown would bring back the infection. In the left panel of Fig. 6 , we show what happens by releasing the lockdown when the peak is fallen by 30%: stronger lockdowns induce a stronger reprise of the epidemic. An analogous effect can be observed by varying the lockdown time: anticipating the lockdown ameliorates the peak by decreasing its height, but shifts it to later time and retards the end of the epidemic. Contrary to what could be naively expected, an early imposition of the lockdown does not ameliorate the epidemics: in fact, anticipating too much the lockdown just shifts the timing of the epidemics, leaving its evolution unchanged (see Fig. 7 ). This is to be expected every time extreme measures of social distancing are applied in the very early, exponentially growing, stages. In fact, let us consider two countries A and B, having the same number of inhabitants, the same contact matrix, and the same number of infected people. If A and B decide to put a lockdown of strength \u03b1 at time t A and t B , respectively, at time t any quantity y would have grown as y A (t) \u223c y 0 e R0t A e \u03b1R0(t\u2212t A ) and as y B (t) \u223c y 0 e R0t B e \u03b1R0(t\u2212tB) .

On the other hand, for \u03b1 < \u03b1 crit the epidemics decreases; nevertheless, since this happens before a sufficient number of recovered individuals has built up herd-immunization, the height of the peaks after the lockdown lifting are almost unchanged if compared with the no lockdown scenario.

On the other hand, if epidemic is decaying everywhere, then i l 1 \u2200 l = k; thus l =k T kl i l k and equation again decouple, having each region followed Eq. 4 separately. In Tab Tab. 4. Region ordered by simulations using the mobility matrix (left column) and by the delays obtained by rescaling experimental data (right column).",
