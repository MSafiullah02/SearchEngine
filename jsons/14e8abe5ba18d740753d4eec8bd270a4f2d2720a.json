In Australia, human, animal and ecological health are managed by separate sectors with limited communication. This study aims to explore how professionals in these fields perceive a One Health approach to zoonotic disease surveillance, aiming to identify the challenges to the implementation of an integrated system in Australia. Using a qualitative research method, ten semistructured interviews were conducted with academic experts to gain insight into the possibility of developing an integrated surveillance system in Australia. A thematic analysis of the data was undertaken. Findings showed the absence of a clear definition and subsequent vision for the future of One Health act as a barrier to interdisciplinary collaboration, and that siloed approaches by different sectors restrict the ability for professionals to work collaboratively across disciplines. An understanding of disease transmission was considered by participants to be a necessary requirement for a successful One Health approach. Finally, participants considered political will an essential requirement for the integration of surveillance systems.",

In 2011, the First International One Health Congress was hosted in Melbourne, Australia, where One Health concepts and principles were developed . Also in Australia, the New South Wales health service has achieved enhanced infection control, as well as improved biosecurity procedures, through the implementation of a single reporting system (Adamson, Marich, & Roth, 2011; Uchtmann, Herrmann, Hahn, & Beasley, 2015) . While positive steps in achieving integrated One Health surveillance have been undertaken at both national and global levels, it has been suggested that focusing on the challenges to the implementation of One Health in individual countries, with consideration of their cultural and societal elements, could help enable effective national strategies, and therefore, a strengthened international approach to zoonotic disease control .",

The findings of this study suggest a formal governance body could be established to address emerging infectious diseases and zoonoses in Australia, providing the essential cross-disciplinary communication, information sharing, and bringing together a shared surveillance approach to zoonoses. Based on the participant perspectives of this study, professionals involved in this governance should equally represent human, animal and environmental health, and the policymakers for these areas should be kept informed.",

While an enhanced understanding of One Health principles has seen public health and animal health authorities, and epidemiologists, work together to address zoonotic disease outbreaks, there remain challenges to the implementation of integrated national surveillance. Broadly, this study illustrates how limited collaboration in tertiary and professional settings results in siloed approaches and mentalities across the sectors and acts as a barrier to the development of an integrated human-animal disease surveillance system. The study findings, in conjunction with relevant literature, suggest for a One Health approach to be successfully implemented in Australia a number of priorities should be addressed. ",

The Australian Prime Minister's Science, Engineering and Innovation Council (PMSEIC) reported in 2009 \"it is a matter of when, not if, a lethally catastrophic epidemic will happen\" (Prime Minister's Science, 2009). Australia could benefit by adopting an approach to zoonotic disease control that accommodates industry while enhancing zoonotic disease surveillance, managing each issue with consideration of any wider implications.

Health surveillance in Australia operates at both state and national levels and is the ongoing systematic collection and interpretation of healthrelated data (Australian Government Department of Health, 2016b). Currently in Australia, human diseases, animal infections and matters relating to the environment are monitored and managed by separate sectors with limited information and data sharing, and as such, effective and timely communication between these departments can be inherently compromised (Armstrong, Gillespie, Leeder, Rubin, & Russell, 2007; Australian Institute of Health and Welfare, 2016). Under the Australian National Notifiable Disease Surveillance System (NNDSS), doctors and laboratories are required by law to report certain communicable diseases in humans; however, notifiable diseases differ amongst various jurisdictions (Australian Government Department of Health, 2015; Miller, Roche, Spencer, & Deeble, 2004). Additionally, notifications of animal diseases are collected by a separate government sector and are primarily for the purposes of minimizing adverse impacts on trade (Australian Government Department of Health",
