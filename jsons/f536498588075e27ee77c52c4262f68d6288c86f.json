In contrast, other CoV infections including the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), the Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) and the recent COVID-19 are characterised by a higher pathogenicity in certain human populations and may be lethal. CoV infections were shown to induce an effective antibody response, however in addition to neutralising antibodies also enhancing antibodies were described, e. g., in the case of SARS-CoV [2] and MERS-CoV [3] . Antibody-dependent enhancement (ADE) occurs when antibodies facilitate viral entry into host cells. ADE has been observed for a variety of viruses, most notable flaviviruses [4] . In the case of MERS-CoV, neutralising antibodies bind to the viral envelope protein and mediate viral entry into IgG Fc receptor-expressing cells. In persons infected by SARS-CoV enhancing antibodies and neutralising antibodies may partly counteract each other\u00b4s function. It is still unclear whether common CoV, SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 have related antigens and whether antibodies against one virus may cross-react with the others. In the case, cross-reactive enhancing antibodies exist, the infection with the new SARS-CoV-2 may be enhanced by these pre-existing antibodies against common CoV.",
