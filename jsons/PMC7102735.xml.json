More than three years after the first discovery of MERS-CoV in 2012, fundamental questions related to its epidemiology, pathogenesis, immune responses and optimal treatment remain unanswered. Nevertheless, it is associated with a high rate of mortality and there is no approved antiviral treatment. Host-directed therapies and the repurposing of existing drugs have been proposed as promising strategies for the development of MERS-CoV-specific antiviral therapy [1].",

Originally developed as an antiprotozoal agent, immediate-release dosage formulations of nitazoxanide are licensed in the United States for the treatment of intestinal infections caused by Cryptosporidium parvum and throughout Latin America, India, Bangladesh and Egypt as a broad-spectrum antiparasitic agent. A new extended-release oral tablet has been developed to deliver the drug systemically, and nitazoxanide is being repurposed for use in treating viral respiratory infections. It is presently undergoing Phase 3 clinical development for treating acute uncomplicated influenza [2].",

The concentrations required to inhibit viral replication by 50% (IC50s) are between 0.2 and 1.5 \u03bcg/ml in multiple human and canine cell lines using single-step virus growth with high multiplicity of infection (5 PFU/cell) and multi-step growth with low multiplicity of infection (0.001 PFU/cell). These IC50 concentrations are easily achieved in humans following administration of nitazoxanide extended-release tablets, as peak and trough plasma concentrations during repeated twice daily dosing have been reported to be 4.6 and 0.8 \u03bcg/ml, respectively. Tizoxanide acts synergistically with oseltamivir and zanamivir in inhibiting in vitro replication of influenza viruses, and it exhibits a high barrier to resistance with no decrease in sensitivity to influenza A viruses after passage for 30 days in increasingly sub-inhibitory concentrations of drug [2], [3], [4].",

The broad-spectrum antiviral activity of tizoxanide is attributed to interference with host-regulated pathways involved in viral replication, rather than a virus-targeted mechanism. These pathways may include interferon or mTORC1 signaling pathways [2], [5]. In the case of influenza, tizoxanide ultimately blocks the maturation of viral hemagglutinin at the post-translational stage. It does not affect the neuraminidase glycoprotein (the target of oseltamivir, zanamivir and peramivir) or the M2 protein (the target of amantadine), and it has no effect on viral infectivity, adsorption or entry into target cells [3].",
