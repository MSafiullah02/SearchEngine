None have been systematically tested for validity, perhaps due in part to the fact that there is no gold standard for assessing the common cold. Various laboratory measures used in research (e.g., mucus weight, viral titer, nasal neutrophils, and cytokine assays including IL-1, IL-6, and IL-8) have major limitations, and none are part of clinical practice. The most commonly used symptom severity measures are the Jackson criteria, developed in the late 1950s [8], [9]. A Jackson score is based on a simple sum of severity points (0 = absent, 1 = mild, 2 = moderate, 3 = severe) for eight cold symptoms: sneezing, nasal obstruction, nasal discharge, sore throat, cough, headache, chilliness, and malaise. Discriminative (diagnostic) validity was shown by Jackson et al. [8], [9], using community-acquired and coxsackievirus-induced colds, and later by Gwaltney [10], using rhinovirus. The Jackson scale has several limitations, including lack of systematic assessment of reliability, responsiveness, factorial structure and external validity. Perhaps more important, the Jackson scale does not assess the \u201cfunctional\u201d and \u201cquality of life\u201d domains that are important to most cold sufferers: impairment of activities of daily living, breathing, sleeping, working, and interpersonal relationships.",

Second, WURSS was developed as an evaluative instrument, designed to measure items and domains that change over time. Recognizing the diversity of approaches to instrument development and validation, we tend to follow the conceptual framework described by McDowell and Newell [12] and to use methods advanced by Guyatt and colleagues at McMaster [13], [14], [15]. As there is no gold standard for measuring the common cold, we chose to assess construct validity, in which evaluation of reliability, responsiveness, and importance to patients is complemented by assessment of associations with external measures, all guided by appropriate conceptual frameworks [12].",

Participants had to have a Jackson score of 3 or higher to be enrolled. Time of onset of first symptom was assessed first during phone screening, then again in person at the consent and enrollment intake interview. Consent procedures were approved by the University of Wisconsin\u2013Madison institutional review board's human subjects committee. Following the intake interview, participants were asked to fill out questionnaires every day until they answered \u201cNot sick\u201d two days in a row to the question, \u201cHow sick do you feel today?\u201d We attempted daily telephone contact in order to enhance adherence to protocol.

Assessment of structural stability over time was evaluated by conducting two analyses. First, the 10-dimensional model pattern was constrained to be equal in a confirmatory factor analysis and assessed at four different time periods, two days from start of the study, three days, four days, and five days, the time frame when overall severity change was greatest. The 10-dimensional structure was supported by the lack of significant change in fit indices in this temporal analysis. Finally, the data from all five days were aggregated and a confirmatory factor analysis based on the 10-dimensional structure was derived.",

Comparing WURSS with SF-8 yielded correlation coefficients from \u22120.60 to \u22120.84 (P < 0.001).

The common cold is a syndrome characterized by abrupt onset, short but variable duration, and high diversity of symptomatic presentation. The rapid change over time precludes meaningful test\u2013retest reliability assessments. The subjective nature precludes interpretable interobserver comparisons. The variability of symptomatic and functional presentation and course, as well as the lack of an adequate gold standard, further complicate validity testing. Currently available laboratory measures are inadequate. Upper respiratory infections may be caused by many different agents, including strains of adenovirus, coronavirus, enterovirus, influenzavirus, parainfluenzavirus, respiratory syncytial virus, and now metapneumovirus [28], as well as the prototype rhinovirus. Even the best laboratories still fail to identify etiological agents in anywhere from 25% to 75% of colds tested [29], [30], however. Conversely, about 25% of those with documented infections fail to develop symptoms [31]. Although nasal and throat symptoms are present in most colds, their presence doesn't assure that it is a cold (it could be, for example, allergic rhinitis, or streptococcal pharyngitis), and their absence doesn't rule out the possibility (asymptomatic infection is possible). Other cold-related symptoms, such as cough, feverishness, chilliness, or general malaise are even less sensitive and specific. Severity, duration, and symptom presentation vary greatly among different populations, partially due to variability among the many pathogens, and partially due to differences in host response. The colds in our study, for example, are longer and more severe, with more cough, fever, and aches, than those of several previous studies [2], [3], [4], [32], [33]. Clearly, we are left with a syndrome that is truly an illness (a collection of experienced symptoms) rather than a disease (defined by verifiable biological criteria), using the model first put forth by Kleinman [34].",

Nevertheless, we readily admit the limitations in this approach: Self-assessment is notoriously variable, and occasionally deceptive. Terms that cold-sufferers use may not correspond to scientific understanding (e.g., \u201csinus pain,\u201d \u201cchills\u201d). The lack of a gold standard precludes formal assessment of concurrent or predictive criterion validity, substituting instead the more problematic evaluations of convergent, and construct, validity [12]. Other limitations include the difficulty in recruiting a representative sample, variability in perception, understanding and response among different individuals, and the inherent difficulty in interpreting scales (indices) that are not solidly tied to universally understood reference standards. Additionally, there is considerable potential difficulty in the underlying assumption of equal distancing among the seven severity levels, in the assumptions of normal distributions, and in the assumption of equal item importance implied by our use of unity weighting. Finally, we should note that our sample size is only marginally adequate for many of the purposes at hand.",

The items included use wordings supplied by cold-sufferers, and are reported to be present by most people at some time during their colds. Empirically conducted factor analysis yielded 10 dimensions that are internally coherent, and stable over time. The WURSS-44 correlates to Jackson (illness-specific) and to the SF-8 (general health) better than these two measures correlate to each other. These correlations appear to be stable over time, and are unaffected by covariates such as gender, age, and severity at presentation. Perhaps most important, WURSS-44 demonstrates greater responsiveness than Jackson, while at the same time expanding both the measurement field and the response range. If the WURSS-21 performs as well by itself as the items embedded in the WURSS-44 appear to, it should be able to detect important change with even greater sensitivity, and with only minimal loss of content breadth. We expect WURSS to progress through further stages of development and are open to good ideas, conscientious criticism, or potentially, collaboration.",
