Whatever the pathogen, Donne's musings on being part of a greater whole were not conceived during an epidemic or pandemic, since these words did not exist as nouns in the English language until 1674 and 1832, respectively. 1 In 2020, the quasi-inexorable spread of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has brought the interconnectedness of humankind back to the forefront of many a consciousness. Yet it has not brought clarity to the blurred boundary between epidemics and pandemics. This was made manifest by the WHO's hesitancy over employing the latter designation in March 2020. 2 And while 'expert' epidemiologists have been climbing over themselves to brandish their latest forecasts (a phenomenon I have described as #WillToPunditry), it seems worth asking, are their ways of parsing health phenomena useful? Moreover, if one accepts that the boundaries between disease outbreaks and their political economic determinants/sequelae are blurred, 3 the same question should also be asked of other 'expert' modelers, economists in particular.",

As the Israeli economist Ariel Rubinstein notes: (1) mathematical models are merely fables dressed in formal language (that therefore create the illusion of being scientific) and (2) economics is an academic discipline which tends towards conservatism and helps the privileged in society maintain their dominance. 15 The same can be said for epidemiology, where bourgeois empiricists 16 build fable-models whose assumptions are usually conjured from the standpoint of dominant interests. 17 In the case of Ebola outbreak in West Africa, epidemiologists attributed amplified transmission to local populations' beliefs in misinformation or their 'strange' funerary practices-in essence, diverting the public's gaze from legacies of the transatlantic slave trade (or Maafa), 18 colonialism, 19 indirect rule, 20 structural adjustment 21 and extractive foreign companies as determinants. 14 22 23 These ways of parsing health phenomena are indeed useful for those in protected affluence, since epidemiologists filter out information vital for demonstrating the Global North's complicity in producing planetary health inequities-weakening the disposition of social resistance to such inequity (and demands for reparations) as a result. For the most part, mathematical models of infectious disease transmission serve not as forecasts, 24 25 but rather as a means for setting epistemic confines to the understanding of why some groups live sicker lives than others-confines that sustain predatory accumulation rather than challenge it. 26 27 Similar to the role philanthropy plays in occulting ecnonomic exploitation, 28 29 the modest improvements in well-being offered by the right hand of public health 'science' often disguise what global elites and their looting machines 30 have expropriated with the left. 31 That being the case, the field is in clear need of decolonising; however, it is producing some potentially useful, although structurally na\u00efve, 32 work to support the containment of SARS-CoV-2 within countries. But epidemiology's abetting function as an ideological apparatus can manifest at any time. 33 In the Wall Street Journal article mentioned above, Bendavid and Bhattacharya, both academics based at Stanford University, may have, unwittingly, given the Trump administration the Stanford imprimatur to trade people's lives for profits. As such, does it make sense to speak of such fabulists-given that their models are fables-as experts? 34 The fable-model I would propose prioritizes people's lives and has radical wealth redistribution as its moral.",
