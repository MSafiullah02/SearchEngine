POMs were added to reactions in 100-or 10-fold excess (3 \u00b5M or 300 nM), depending upon the solubility of the POMs. The substrate is 8 amino acids long and contains a cleavage site for the HIV-1 protease between the residues tyrosine and proline. The Reaction rates of additive reactions were compared to buffer controls.

To prevent autoproteolytic degradation of the enzyme, a single amino acid substitution (Q7K) was performed using the QuikChange\u00ae Site-Directed Mutagenesis Kit (Stratagene). This mutation was proposed to stabilize the protein of at least 100-fold without affecting the enzyme activity. 3 Synthesis of POMs: The arsenal of polyoxometalates (POMs) were synthesized according to literature 4-8 and routinely analyzed by IR spectroscopy (KBr pellets).

Cleavage of the substrate leads to a separation of the two groups that results in an increase of S-3 fluorescence. The enzymatic reaction is thus observed by measuring the increase of the fluorescence signal at 485 nm over time with an excitation at 380 nm and a gain of 60. All POMs showed no absorbance at 380 nm in assay concentration and do therefore not interfere with the excitation of the fluorophore at 380 nm. Saquinavir was measured as a standard inhibitor in concentrations of 30 nM. All potential inhibitors were measured in triplicates to obtain a standard deviation. The slope of the linear region of a RFU vs. time plot corresponds to the reaction rate. The mean value of the triplets was compared to a positive control without inhibitor, which was defined as 100 % of the reaction velocity.
