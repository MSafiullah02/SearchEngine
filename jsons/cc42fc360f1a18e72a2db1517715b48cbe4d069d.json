The specificities of such responses are governed by human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-restricted presentation of SARS-derived peptide epitopes. Exact knowledge of how the immune system handles protein antigens would allow for the identification of such linear sequences directly from genomic/proteomic sequence information (Lauemoller et al., Rev Immunogenet 2001: 2: 477-91). The latter was recently established when a causative coronavirus (SARS-CoV) was isolated and full-length sequenced (Marra et al., Science 2003: 300: 1399. Here, we have combined advanced bioinformatics and high-throughput immunology to perform an HLA supertype-, genome-wide scan for SARS-specific CTL epitopes. The scan includes all nine human HLA supertypes in total covering >99% of all individuals of all major human populations (Sette & Sidney, Immunogenetics 1999: 50: 201-12). For each HLA supertype, we have selected the 15 top candidates for test in biochemical binding assays. At this time (approximately 6 months after the genome was established), we have tested the majority of the HLA supertypes and identified almost 100 potential vaccine candidates. These should be further validated in SARS survivors and used for vaccine formulation. We suggest that immunobioinformatics may become a fast and valuable tool in rational vaccine design.",

Coordinated by the WHO, classical measures including case detection, isolation, infection control, contact tracing, and follow-up surveillance have successfully contained the disease; however, the disease has proven resilient and it cannot be excluded that it will resurface given the right conditions. Should that occur, even the best health system would be severely strained if it had to resume and sustain the containment effort implemented in the spring of 2003.

One would therefore expect that an effective vaccine should induce mucosal immunity such as that effected by secretory immunoglobulin A (IgA), which specifically prevents an infectious agent from penetrating the mucosal epithelium, and by cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs), which specifically eradicate infected cells (5) . IgA responses are generally considered the major protective mechanism; however, there are examples of CTLs, not antibodies, being responsible for early control of mucosal infection (5) . Particularly noteworthy, this is the case for the infectious bronchitis virus of chicks, a prototype of the Coronaviridae family, where primary effector CD8 \u00fe CTLs play a critical role in the elimination of virus during acute infection and subsequent control of the infection (6-10).",

Prior to presentation, peptides are generated in the cytosol by limited proteolytic fragmentation of all available protein antigens, translocated to the endoplasmic reticulum, specifically sampled by the MHC molecules and exported to the cell surface, where they await CTL scrutiny. Importantly, the HLA is extremely polymorphic and the peptide binding specificity varies for the different polymorphic HLA molecules (1). It has, however, been suggested that the majority of all major human populations can be covered with three to nine ''HLA supertypes'', where the different members of each supertype bind similar peptides (3). If one knew exactly how peptides were generated and selected, then genomic/proteomic information could be used to predict the outcome of antigen presentation and forecast immunogenicity. Here, we have used advanced immunobioinformatical tools to mimic antigen presentation and, in a highly cost-and timeeffective manner, predicted possible immunogenic epitopes.",

Thus, close to 10,000 binding predictions were made for each of the nine HLA supertypes. Artificial neural networks (ANNs) were used to predict the binding affinity quantitatively when the corresponding data were available [e.g. for A*0201 (11, 12) ]. The performance of the ANNs is high, as the correlation coefficient between predicted and measured binding is 0.85. The remaining HLA bindings were predicted using weight matrices derived from Gibbs sampling sequence-weighting methods with pseudocount correction for low counts as well as differential position-specific anchor weighting (Nielsen et al. manuscript in preparation). These weight matrices were calculated from available nonamer data from the SYFPEITHI and MHCPEP databases with the peptides clustered into the nine supertypes (A1, A2, A3, A24, B7, B27, B44, B58, and B62). The positive predictive value of the matrix-driven prediction has been found to be around 66%, whereas the negative predictive value has been found to be around 97% (Lamberth et al. unpublished observation). Proteasomal processing was predicted using NETCHOP 2.0 (13). NETCHOP 2.0 has been found to be superior to other proteasomal prediction algorithms (14) . Peptides with a NETCHOP 2.0 score below 0.5 (i.e. poorly predicted proteasomal processing) were excluded from further analysis. Finally, we excluded all peptides that did not represent epitopes conserved in all SARS isolates. Figure 1 shows a representative example for a member of the HLA-A3 supertype, the HLA-A*1101 (this haplotype is particularly common in Southeast Asia).",

The interaction of these epitope candidates with the appropriate HLA was subsequently validated in a biochemical binding assay (15) . Briefly, denatured and purified recombinant HLA heavy chains were diluted into a renaturation buffer containing HLA light chain, b 2 -microglobulin, and graded concentrations of the peptide to be tested, and incubated at 18 C for 48 h allowing equilibrium to be reached. We have previously demonstrated that denatured HLA molecules can de novo fold efficiently, however, only in the presence of appropriate peptide (16) . The concentration of peptide-HLA complexes generated was measured in a quantitative enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and plotted against the concentration of peptide offered (15) (Fig. 2) . Because the effective concentration of HLA (3-5 nM) used in these assays is below the equilibrium dissociation constant (K D ) of most high-affinity peptide-HLA interactions, the peptide concentration leading to half-saturation of the HLA is a reasonable approximation of the affinity of the interaction. An initial screening procedure was employed whereby a single high concentration (20,000 nM) of peptide was incubated with one or more HLA molecules. If no complex formation was found, the peptide was assigned as a non-binder to the HLA molecule(s) in question, conversely, if complex formation was found in the initial screening, a full titration of the peptide was performed to determine the affinity of binding.",

            "text": "The resulting binding isotherms were analyzed by one-site hyperbola regression (Prism 1 GraphPad) determining the concentration of HLA employed (3-5 nM, data not shown), the K D of the interaction (Table 1 ) and the goodness of the curve fit (R 2 was always >0.95 and in the majority of cases it was >0.98, data not shown) (15) . In general, intermediate and high-affinity binders have K D s better (i.e. lower) than 500 nM and 50 nM, respectively, and the higher the affinity, the more likely the peptide is going to be a T-cell epitope (17) . Table 1 summarizes the data for HLA-A*0301 and HLA-A*1101. The pep- for the top-ranking peptides, only 22 (or 2-3%) of the 952 combinations involves cross-responses, where a peptide predicted to be a top-ranking binder to one HLA molecule turns out to be a binder to a member of another HLA supertype, i.e. it supports the contention that HLA supertypes effect significant diversification of anti-SARS CTL responses. Conversely, the overlap between different members of the same HLA supertype appears to be extensive. Thus, 13 of the 15 peptides predicted to be good binders to A*0301 were found to bind to another member of the A3 supertype, HLA-A*1101. Similarly, nine of the 15 peptides predicted to be good binders to A*1101 were found to bind to HLA-A*0301 (Table 1) Once all nine supertypes have been tested, we would project to have found well over 100 different vaccine candidates. These would all have been predicted to be successfully processed by the proteasome and biochemically validated for HLA binding. Therefore, there should be a high probability that these peptides are indeed presented to CTLs. Once that occurs, there is an approximately 50% chance of being able to raise a CTL response (18) . Thus, our data do in all likelihood include some 50 CTL epitopes. To identify these from the >100 binding peptides, one could search for the corresponding CTL reactivities in peripheral blood of SARS survivors using robust and reasonably simple technologies such as interferon-g secretion from stimulated whole blood T cells (19) Peptide binders to HLA-A*0301 (top frame) and HLA-A*1101 (bottom frame), sorted according to predicted binding strength, were synthesized and the affinities of binding to A*0301 and A*1101 were determined. The peptide sequence is given in single-letter code and the measured binding affinity is given as the KD. In the near future, the genome of any pathogen can be fully sequenced in a matter of days. The bioinformatics tools currently being developed and perfected will be able to use such genomic information to predict immune epitopes computationally, and the corresponding immunological tools will currently be able to validate these predictions in a matter of weeks to months. We predict that epitope identification in the near future will be as fast as a DNA sequencing in handling whole organisms. With the dissemination of these tools, one could envision that clinicians and scientists anywhere would be able to analyze pathogens of their interest (or agent of bioterrorism, or tumor cell) for the purpose of fast identification of immunogenic epitopes (1) . The timeline of the present SARS epidemic has demonstrated how fast modern science can identify a pathogen and decipher its genome. Using this information in a fast and rational design of vaccines, immunobioinformatics promises to take this development one step further.",

Doing this in an efficient and timely manner would be of considerable importance, and one could suggest that such a strategy should be coordinated by the WHO and included in any future SARS-like effort. Alternatively, one could use the biochemically validated peptide epitopes without further information. Most humans express six different HLA molecules, and it would be highly unlikely that one would have failed to identify at least one CTL epitope in given individual. A vaccine could be formulated as a polytope design where the different peptides are linked together such that the polytope contains one or more peptides for each HLA supertype (20). This would maximize the likelihood that at least one anti-SARS CTL response is raised in any given vaccinated individual. With the number of possible epitopes available here, one could even formulate several different polytopes. Their availability would further increase the chance of generating a multiepitope response and this would reduce the risk of the SARS virus escaping immune attack. These polytopes could be administrated in several different forms such as DNA vaccines, virus-like particles, immune-stimulating complexes (ISCOMs), etc. (20-27). These administration forms are ideally suited to exploit the potential of a fast epitope-identification approach like the one presented here; however,",
