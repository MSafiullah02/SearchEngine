Hence, the emission probabilities of the fifth source combination fit the nucleotide frequencies better. That is, emission probabilities of (0.082, 0.918) and (0.031, 0.969), respectively, correspond better to nucleotide frequencies of (4, 46) and (0, 3), respectively, than using joint emission probabilities of (0.077, 0.923) for both. Hence, one could expect a higher probability for the fifth source combination.",
