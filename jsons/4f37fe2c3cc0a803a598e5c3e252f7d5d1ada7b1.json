Its usefulness for determining cell counts in canine and feline intracavitary effusions has not yet been studied. Objectives: The objectives of this study were to evaluate the analytical performance of the Sysmex XT-2000iV for cell counts in effusions from dogs and cats, and to assess correlation with an impedance counter and concordance with diagnoses based on cytologic findings. Methods: Effusions (43 pleural, 23 peritoneal, 6 pericardial) were analyzed from 32 dogs and 34 cats. Total nucleated cell count (TNCC), HCT, and RBC count were determined on the Sysmex and compared with those obtained on an impedance counter (Hemat 8, SEAC). Imprecision, linearity, and limit of detection were determined for the Sysmex. An algorithm was designed using quantitative and qualitative data from the Sysmex to classify the effusions and the results were compared with diagnoses based on cytologic findings. Results: Intra-assay and interassay coefficients of variation on the Sysmex were variable. Linearity of TNCC was Z0.993 for dogs and cats, with the exception of effusions from cats with feline infectious peritonitis, which had delta (D) TNC values 4 3.0. In comparison with the Hemat 8, a proportional error was found for TNCC on the Sysmex. Effusion classification based on the algorithm was concordant with that obtained by cytologic examination in 43/72 (60%) samples. Discordant results usually were due to the misclassification of cells with similar morphology (such as mesothelial and carcinoma cells) in Sysmex scattergrams. Conclusion: The Sysmex XT-2000iV provides a precise and accurate TNCC and has moderate concordance with cytologic findings for classifying canine and feline effusions. Although microscopic examination of effusions is necessary to achieve an accurate diagnosis, the Sysmex can provide preliminary information that may be helpful to cytopathologists.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Abstract"}], "body_text": [{"text": "Effusions are a relatively common manifestation of a wide variety of pathologic processes characterized by altered production and/or removal of fluid in a body cavity. The generally adopted classification system discriminates transudates, modified transudates, and exudates based mainly on protein content and total nucleated cell count (TNCC) . 1 This classification is not a diagnosis per se, but is useful for establishing differential diagnoses and for patient management. Usually, transudates develop as a response to increased prehepatic hydrostatic vascular pressure or decreased oncotic pressure; modified transudates can develop from long standing transudates, or can be caused by increased hydrostatic pressure or noninflammatory stimuli; and exudates result from increased capillary permeability occurring during inflammation. 1 Neoplastic, hemorrhagic, and chylous effusions are characterized by variable and overlapping protein concentrations and TNCCs, but have specific cytologic features that are used in their differentiation. Cytologic examination of effusion fluid is usually performed to evaluate the type and morphology of cells present and to look for a possible etiology. Thus, both enumeration and classification of cells in effusions are important in the diagnostic process.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 337, "end": 343, "text": "(TNCC)", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 346, "end": 347, "text": "1", "ref_id": "BIBREF0"}, {"start": 838, "end": 839, "text": "1", "ref_id": "BIBREF0"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Introduction"}, {"text": "The TNCC can be determined using manual or automated methods. Manual methods (eg, using a hemacytometer) are imprecise, time consuming, and labor intensive. 2 Consequently, an accurate, precise, expeditious, easily performed, and cost-efficient method would be an attractive alternative, especially if it could also provide information about the cell types present in the effusion. However, using automated methods, debris can be counted as cells, and protein-rich fluids may clot and obstruct the instrument. 3 Automated differential cell counts are not usually performed on effusions in veterinary laboratories, because microscopic evaluation has been considered necessary for accurate identification of cell type. 1 In human pathology, instruments that use immunophenotyping to identify cells can reliably perform total and differential counts in body fluids. 4, 5 The Sysmex XT-2000iV is a veterinary hematology analyzer that provides total and differential counts by combining flow cytometry (laser) and impedance technology. RBC and platelet counts are based on impedance, while the WBC count (corresponding to the TNCC) is based on laser methodology and is measured in the DIFF and BASO channels. 6 The DIFF channel classifies cells based on complexity and nucleic acid content. The BASO channel classifies cells based on volume and the complexity of cellular residues produced after contact with an acidic reagent that collapses all the nucleated cells except basophils. The Sysmex also calculates a delta (D) WBC (ratio between DIFF and BASO counts), which should be close to 1. 5 The Sysmex has been validated for canine and feline blood samples 7 ; however, we are unaware of studies on its use to analyze effusion fluid. In 1 study, flow cytometric analysis with the ADVIA 120 was assessed for obtaining a preliminary classification of effusions in dogs and cats. 8 The aims of the present study were to assess the analytical performance of the Sysmex XT-2000iV for cell counts in canine and feline effusions by evaluating imprecision, linearity, and agreement with counts obtained on an impedance counter.

HCT and RBC count on the Sysmex were precise and accurate in both species, based on the CVs, linearity results, and a negligible LOD. Platelet counts were not evaluated in this study because they are not accurate in fluids other than blood due to the presence of cellular debris that can be erroneously counted as platelets by the instrument. 6 The TNCC is one of the main parameters used to classify an effusion. 1 In this study, the precision and linearity of TNCCs in effusion fluid were acceptable 15 except for samples from cats with FIP, which, based on evaluation of 1 sample, likely clotted when mixed with the BASO reagent. The clots were probably too large to be aspirated by the instrument; however, because analysis of these samples did not obstruct the machine or require particular cleaning procedures. However, clotting precludes evaluation of cell counts in the BASO channel, and DIFF counts are thus probably more accurate in these cases. We hypothesize that clotting resulted from a high content of fibrin and globulins in the effusions, characteristic of FIP. 3, 12, 13, 16 In the present study, all 6 cases of FIP were correctly classified by the very high DTNC, suggesting this parameter may have high diagnostic specificity for FIP; however, this result should be confirmed and the cut-off verified by further studies.

However, the quantification of cell populations in effusions has a secondary importance in classifying fluids, when compared with the TNCC and the identification of neoplastic cell populations. In ad- dition, the Sysmex graphically displays the cells in scattergrams, which allows visual assessment of cell morphology, cellular density, and distribution of predominant cell types. Thus, scattergrams patterns rather than differential cell counts were used in the diagnostic algorithm, even though evaluation of scattergrams may be more subjective. Leukocytes in effusions appear in a cytogram similar to leukocytes in peripheral blood, although effusions often have different relative cell numbers. For example, chylous effusions had a large cell population in the lymphocyte region of the TNCC-DIFF scattergram and neoplastic round cells were found in a similar region of the TNCC-BASO scattergrams as that where neoplastic lymphocytes are found in dogs with chronic lymphocytic leukemia. 17 A major problem was the presence of cells in effusions that are not usually found in blood, such as mesothelial and epithelial cells. Reactive mesothelial cells and neoplastic epithelial cells resulted in similar scattergrams characterized by widely dispersed cells in the region where voluminous cells having high nucleic acid content would be expected (region of intense fluorescence DIFF signal and a high forward scatter BASO signal). Thus, the scattergrams did not allow us to differentiate between carcinoma cells and reactive mesothelial cells, similar to what was reported in a previous study with the ADVIA 120. 8 This was not surprising since the morphology of these cells is often similar. 18 To facilitate the interpretation of information generated by the Sysmex XT-2000iV we designed a diagnostic algorithm based on evaluation of numerical data and subjective assessment of the scattergrams. Application of this algorithm provided highly repeatable results and substantial interobserver concordance. 10 In only 10 samples did discordance between observers result in a false positive or false negative diagnosis of neoplasia. When the consensus interpretation of Sysmex data was compared with the consensus interpretation of cytologic findings, moderate concordance (60%) was found. 10 A limitation of the study was that the cytologic classification was based only on the morphology of the cells, ie, the cytopathologists were not provided any other data from the sample (ie, color and turbidity, total protein concentration, TNCC). These data usually are essential for classifying effusions and would have provided a ''gold standard'' for comparison with the Sysmex; however, the focus of this study was on cell type and morphology. Lack of biochemical and macroscopic data likely resulted in many of the discrepancies between the diagnosis based on cytologic findings and the Sysmex data, for example, in identifying chylous effusions. Similarly, discrepancies between automated and microscopic classification of transudates and reactive/inflammatory conditions likely resulted from lack of knowledge of the TNCC by the cytopathologist rather than from true misclassification.
