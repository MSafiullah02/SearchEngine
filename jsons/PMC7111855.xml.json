In addition to variation in the in vivo pathogenicity, the two viruses replicate differently in vitro as well (Pedersen, 2009). Infection of feline peritoneal macrophages by FIPV results in more infected cells, a higher titer of viral progeny, more efficient spreading to other susceptible cells and greater sustained infection than FECV (Stoddart and Scott, 1989). Similar findings have also been demonstrated in feline peripheral blood monocytes (fPBM) (Dewerchin et al., 2005).",

Recently, the integrity of the 3c gene has been found to be correlated with the outcome of infection (Balint et al., 2012, Chang et al., 2010, Pedersen et al., 2012, Vennema et al., 1998). Deletion of the 3c gene has been observed in many FIPV isolates (Vennema et al., 1998) and naturally FCoV-infected cats (Chang et al., 2010, Pedersen et al., 2012). In cats that are asymptomatically infected with FCoV, nearly all of the 3c genes were intact. In contrast, most of the 3c genes of FCoVs from FIP cats harbored point mutations and/or insertion/deletion mutations that led to a truncation of the 3C protein. The 3C protein has been suggested to be related to intestinal tropism (Chang et al., 2010, Pedersen et al., 2012) and the truncated version of open reading frame (ORF) 3abc has been demonstrated to play a role in the efficient macrophage/monocyte tropism of type II FIPV (Balint et al., 2012).",

In contrast, in isolates from the 90 FIP cats, 67 (72.2%) were found to be infected with at least one FCoV strain that harbored a mutated 3c gene (Table 3).

In ferret coronavirus, which is similar to FCoV, the mutation of a 3c-like gene is correlated with systemic infection (FIP-like disease manifestation) (Wise et al., 2010). However, in transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV) in pigs and CCoV in dogs, mutations in this gene have been suggested to be related to attenuation of the viruses (Decaro et al., 2007, Horsburgh et al., 1992, Sanchez-Morgado et al., 2004, Zhang et al., 2007). To the best of our knowledge, there is only one study involving the characterization of a 3C-related protein. In TGEV, this protein has been demonstrated to be a membrane-associated glycoprotein that is primarily distributed in the ER/Golgi (O\u2019Connor and Brian, 1999). In this study, the pattern of the distribution of the 3C protein is similar to that of the 3c-related protein in TGEV-infected cells. We failed to detect the 3C protein through Western blotting, a similar result to that reported for the 3C-like protein of TGEV. Low abundance or fast degradation could be the reason for this result for both proteins (O\u2019Connor and Brian, 1999).",

A similar finding has been reported recently using a recombinant FIPV (rFIPV) strain DF-2 that harbored a truncated ORF3abc. The replication of rFIPV strain DF-2 with intact ORF3abc was lower in the Fcwf-4 cells by approximately 0.5 log PFU/ml and was significantly decreased in feline monocytes when compared to rFIPV DF-2 with truncated ORF3abc (Balint et al., 2012). In this study, using exogenous expression of the 3C protein, we were able to narrow down this decreased viral replication to one gene. These findings strongly indicated that the 3C protein could be a virulence-suppressing factor during FCoV infection and might play an important role in the pathogenesis of FIP.",

The possible reason for this transient alteration could be due to the heterogeneity of the cells used in this study. Since only 50% G418-resistant cells were expressing the 3C protein and the virus strain NTU156 we used to monitor the replication was a relatively fast growing one (6 h/replication cycle) (Lin et al., 2009), the viruses produced from cells without the 3C protein expression may hence masked the effect at the later time point.",

Other than its role in physiology, autophagy has also been shown to play a role in the regulation of viral replication. Many viral proteins have been determined to be detected by autophagy machinery, and viral replication has been shown to be decreased due to the degradation of viral proteins by autophagy. Hence, some viruses have evolved mechanisms that interfere with autophagy pathways to prevent the clearance of the infection (Dreux and Chisari, 2010). In contrast with this role in host defenses, some viruses have been found to utilize autophagy machinery as a site for replication, and the activation of this pathway thus facilitates viral replication. Due to the importance of the autophagy pathway in innate viral defenses, the involvement of the 3C protein with autophagy was determined. However, treatment with both an autophagy inhibitor and autophagy inducer did not significantly rescue viral replication in 3c-expressing cells (Fig. 4B). This indicates that the inhibitory effect of the 3C protein is mediated by pathway(s) other than autophagy.",

An intact 3C protein may play a role in similar pathways and maintain the symbiosis of virus and host. Additionally, various cellular pathways have been shown to be crucial in the life cycle of different CoVs, including endosomal proteolysis (Qiu et al., 2006, Regan et al., 2008), the mitogen-activated protein kinase signal transduction pathway (Cai et al., 2007), GBF1-mediated ARF1 activation (Verheije et al., 2008), LC3-1-positive ESEMsome (Reggiori et al., 2010) and the ubiquitin\u2013proteasome system (Raaben et al., 2010). It is also possible that the 3C protein interferes with these pathways and hinders viral replication. Identification of the underlying mechanism(s) of 3c might elucidate the pathogenesis of FCoV infection and occurrence of FIP. Knowing the pathways or machineries that the 3C protein interacts with in host cells will help us determine effective antiviral agents to block the viral life cycle and clear FCoV infection.",
