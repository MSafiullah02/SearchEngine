            "text": "Today, the rapid outbreak of Corona Virus Disease 2019 (COVID-19 or SARS-CoV-2) is the leading health issue. There is a paucity of studies investigating the factors affecting immune response to COVID-19. In addition, there has been no detailed report for this immune response. Given the genomic similarity of 79% with Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV), nearly the same reaction to the immune system is expected for COVID-19 [1]. In response to SARS-CoV, both innate and adaptive immune systems are involved. SARS-CoV applies several mechanisms to overcome the immune response. First, it inhibits the rapid expression of interferon type 1 (IFN-1) [2]. IFN-1 is known as the \u201cinitial alarm\u201d upon encounter with the virus that modulates the immune cells to the so-called \u201cantiviral state\u201d. Moreover, SARS-CoV interferes with IFN-1 signaling through inhibition of STAT-1 phosphorylation [3]. The third defensive mechanism of SARS-CoV is immune exhaustion through exaggerated and prolonged IFN-1 production by plasmacytoid dendritic cells (pDCs). This process leads to the influx of activated neutrophils and inflammatory monocytes/macrophages, that in turn, results in lung immunopathology (e.g. acute respiratory distress syndrome) [4]. Finally, the resulted so-called \u201ccytokine storm\u201d further weakens the immune system through IFN-1-mediated T cell apoptosis [5]. In this article, we aim to provide a new hypothesis to describe how the repletion of cellular adenosine triphosphate (c-ATP) can promote immunity against COVID-19. Thereafter, we justify the current knowledge regarding the characteristics of COVID-19 infection by our hypothesis and give several approaches to improve the c-ATP.",

            "text": "Following deactivation of \u201cinitial alarm\u201d, COVID-19 easily proliferates in-situ. Among the passive host-cells, there are exceptions that can react to the COVID-19, the pDCs. They detect the virus by toll-like receptor 7 (TLR-7). Upon attachment to viral nucleic acids, TLR7 induces profound IFN-1 expression. This response recruits other immune cells and causes massive local inflammation [9]. At first glance, this robust immune response is beneficial for the elimination of COVID-19. However, two factors prevent it. First, impairment of IFN-1 signaling results in impairment of immune cell transformation to the \u201cantiviral state\u201d. Therefore, they are not so effective in eliminating existing viruses [8]. Second, persistence profound inflammatory responses may lead to immune exhaustion [4]. The depletion of c-ATP can potentially enhance these detrimental processes in the following ways. In 2016, Rebbapragada et al. demonstrated the effect of ATP in the function of TLR7 by controlling the endo-lysosomal PH. They showed that ATP-depletion can increase the endo-lysosomal PH and improve the efficacy of TLR7. Therefore, ATP-depletion can potentially enhance profound IFN-1 secretion. Secondly, ATP-depletion can potentially prone the recruited immune cells to earlier exhaustion against COVID-19. Therefore, one may conclude that ATP-repletion can prevent the so-called \u201ccytokine storm\u201d and improve the cellular energy to better counteract with COVID-19.",

In line with this hypothesis, Perl et al. have shown that following IFN-\u03b3 stimulation, mitochondrial hyperpolarization and ATP depletion occurs in T-cells that results in apoptosis [10].

This condition may be either due to impairment of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-gamma coactivator-1\u03b1 (PGC-1\u03b1) or age-related accumulation of mitochondrial DNA mutations [12].

Human cells need nutrients (including glucose, free fatty acids, essential amino acids, and O2) to maintain their c-ATP level. The aforementioned illnesses impede the regular distribution of the nutrients secondary to compromising the function and structure of small and large vessels.

The therapeutic effect through the prevention of \u201ccytokine storm\u201d and T-cell apoptosis. There are several approaches to improve c-ATP.

Smoking cessation is the second approach to improve mitochondrial capacity and improvement in c-ATP (as mentioned above). Consuming foods with low specific dynamic action (SDA), as the energetic budget for consuming food, can potentially boost the immune system through improving the c-ATP. In 2016, Luoma et al. demonstrated the effect of low-SDA meals in the up-regulation of the innate immune system in corn snakes [19].
