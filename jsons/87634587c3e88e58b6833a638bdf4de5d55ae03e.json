Most, but not all, isolates collected from Brassica plants in China infected only Brassica plants, whereas those from Japan infected both Brassica and Raphanus (BR) plants. Analyses of the positions of recombination sites in five regions of the genomes (one third of the full sequence) of the many recombinant isolates were fully congruent with the results of phylogenetic analysis, and at least one recombination type pattern was shared between Chinese and Japanese populations. One lineage of nonrecombinant isolates from the basal-BR lineage was found in 2000 in Kyushu, Japan but none in China, and have since been found over the whole island. The sudden expansion of this basal-BR population was strongly supported by calculations showing the deviations from the neutral equilibrium model for the individual geographical lineages with overall lack of nucleotide diversity, and by analysis of mismatch distribution. Our study shows that the recent Chinese and Japanese TuMV isolates are part of the same population but are discrete lineages.",

TuMV infects a wide range of plant species, most from the family Brassicaceae . It is probably the most widespread and important virus infecting both crop and ornamental species of this family throughout the world, and especially threatens cultivated brassicas in East Asia (Provvidenti 1996; Tomimura et al . 2003) . TuMV belongs to the genus Potyvirus . This is the largest genus of the largest family of plant viruses, the Potyviridae (Shukla et al . 1994; Fauquet et al . 2005) , which itself belongs to the picorna-like supergroup of viruses. TuMV, like other potyviruses, is transmitted by aphids in the nonpersistent manner (Hamlyn 1953) . Potyviruses have flexuous filamentous particles 700-750 nm long, each of which contains a single copy of the genome, which is a single-stranded positive sense RNA molecule of about 10 000 nucleotides (nts). The genomes have terminal untranslated regions flanking a single open reading frame. The single large polyprotein hydrolyses itself after translation into at least 10 proteins (Riechmann et al . 1992; Urcuqui-Inchima et al . 2001) . The protein 1 (P1) gene, situated at 5 \u2032 end of the genome, encodes a serine proteinase and is the protein with the greatest between-species variation. Even though P1 enhances amplification and movement of the virus, it is not strictly required for viral infectivity (Verchot et al . 1992; Klein et al . 1994) . The 6K protein 2 (second 6-kda protein) is involved in viral long-distance movement and symptom induction (Restrepo-Hartwig & Carrington 1994) . The viral genomelinked protein (VPg) is a multifunctional protein with several suggested roles in the viral infection cycle; it may act as a primer for RNA replicase during virus multiplication, possibly through direct interaction with the viral RNA polymerase, and it has essential functions in host genotype specificity (Schaad et al . 1997) . The nuclear inclusion a proteinase (NIa-Pro) cleaves the polyprotein (Parks et al . 1995) . The coat protein (CP) is involved in aphid transmission, cell-to-cell and systemic movement, encapsidation of the viral RNA and regulation of viral RNA amplification (Atreya et al . 1991; Dolja et al . 1994) . CP sequences have been studied extensively to assess the difference within and between potyvirus species (Urcuqui-Inchima et al . 2001) .",

It thereby elucidates the processes that underlie the genetic diversity of populations in space and time. We therefore decided that to better understand the evolution of host/virus interactions of TuMV, it was important to determine in more detail the molecular changes that occurred during the evolution of its populations. Our earlier studies have shown that the Asian TuMV subpopulation has probably emerged from the more ancient Eurasian subpopulation (Tomimura et al . 2003 (Tomimura et al . , 2004 . In both regions, Brassica crops are an important component of local agriculture, but in Europe the crops are mostly Brassica species whereas in Asia they are both Brassica and Raphanus species. It is of particular interest to evaluate the impact of recombination in shaping potyvirus populations. However, the structure of potyvirus populations has rarely been analysed at the local scale, so that evolutionary processes determining the population structure of the species are often unknown (Moreno et al . 2004) . Although Japan is close to China geographically, there is no evidence for plant virus migration between China and Japan.",

            "text": "The sequences of 196 isolates, collected worldwide, were obtained from the international gene sequence database and used for the recombination analyses. First, we joined the nt sequences of the P1, part C-terminus of cylindrical inclusion protein (Ct-CI, 3\u2032 terminal 63 nts), 6K2, VPg, NIa-Pro and CP genes of each sequence, and called this its 'concat', namely a concatenated sequence analogous to a contiguous sequence or 'contig'. Phylogenies were calculated from 29 equal slices of the aligned gene sequences. Only those from the region around nt 5501-6500 in degapped sequences, which we call region 12 (R12; see Tomimura et al. 2003) , and which encodes from the Ct-CI to the middle of NIa-Pro nt sequences, gave trees calculated by three different methods [i.e. maximum-likelihood (ML), maximum parsimony (MP) and neighbour-joining (NJ), as described below] that were almost identical to those constructed from entire genomic sequences. The concats were used for evolutionary analyses. The corresponding regions of two sequences of Japanese yam mosaic virus ( JYMV) (Fuji & Nakamae 1999 , one of Scallion mosaic virus (ScMV) (Chen et al. 2002) and one of Narcissus yellow stripe virus (NYSV) (Chen et al. 2003) were used to align the TuMV concats, as blast searches had shown them to be the sequences in the international sequence databases most closely and consistently related to those of TuMV; TuMV P1 genes were more closely related to those of JYMV than ScMV, whereas for some other TuMV regions/genes such as R12 and the remainder of NIa-Pro gene it was the converse, except that the TuMV CP gene was most closely related to that of NYSV. We thus aligned all 196 P1 sequences with those of two JYMV isolates as the outgroup, the R12 + Pro sequences with those of JYMV and ScMV, and the CP sequences with that of NYSV using clustal x (Jeanmougin et al. 1998 ). However, this procedure resulted in some gaps, which were not in multiples of three nts. Therefore, the amino acid sequences corresponding to individual gene regions, together with the appropriate outgroups shown above, were aligned using clustal x with transalign (kindly supplied by Georg Weiller) to maintain the degapped alignment of the encoded amino acids, and then the separate gene regions reassembled to form sequences 3315 nts long. The aligned sequences were checked for incongruent relationships, which might have resulted from recombination, using rdp (Martin & Rybicki 2000) , geneconv (Sawyer 1999) , bootscan (Salminen et al. 1995) , maxchi (Maynard Smith 1992), chimaera (Posada & Crandall 2001) and siscan programs in rdp2 software (Martin et al. 2005) , and phylpro (Weiller 1998 ) and siscan version 2 (Gibbs et al. 2000) programs in the original software. We first checked for incongruent relationships using phylpro and siscan version 2, and then the programs in rdp2, whose analyses were done using default settings for different detection programs and a Bonferroni-corrected P-value cut off of 0.05 or 0.01, and then all isolates that had been identified as likely recombinants by the programs in rdp2 were rechecked using phylpro and siscan version 2, reviewing not just the complete nt sequences but also the synonymous (d s ) and nonsynonymous (d n ) sites separately. In addition, we checked 100 and 50 nt slices of all the sequences for evidence of recombination using the same programs. These analyses also assessed which nonrecombinant sequences have regions that are most closely related to regions of the recombinant sequences, and hence indicate the likely lineages that provided those regions to the recombinants. For simplicity, we call these the 'parental' isolates of recombinants, although they are merely those that include the most closely related regions.",

Then, the programs in the rdp2 package (Martin et al. 2005) were used to confirm whether the RSs detected by the phylpro and siscan programs were likely. Recombination detecting programs can be grouped by their basic assumptions; for instance, bootscan (Salminen et al. 1995) , rdp (Martin & Rybicki 2000) and siscan programs are phylogenetic methods, whereas geneconv (Sawyer 1999) , maxchi (Maynard Smith 1992) and chimaera (Posada & Crandall 2001) programs are substitution methods, and the phylpro program is a distance comparison method (Posada & Crandall 2001) .",

We therefore used siscan to check 50 and 100 nt slices of all Eurasian sequences for evidence of recombination either using all nts, or using those that had ds or dn changes separately. Table 3 summarizes the location of crossover sites found in the East Asian genomes by the seven recombination detecting programs, and Fig. 2 shows the different patterns of RSs in those recombinants together with a list of the sequences in which the various patterns were found. There seemed to be at least 20 RSs in the TuMV genomes and 17 recombination type patterns (A-Q, Fig. 2 ) in the East Asian population. Fourteen of the 20 RSs seemed to be derived from parents from different major lineages (i.e. interlineage RSs), seven RSs seemed to be derived from parents from the same major lineage (i.e. intralineage RSs). Most of RSs were detected by all programs; therefore, we called these 'clear' RSs, but two intralineage RSs at around nts 6121 and 6300 in the VPg gene were only detected by some programs and one of the parents had an RS at the same site, and thus, further analyses will be required to clarify this anomaly. We therefore considered these sites to be 'tentative' RSs or false positives, *Approximately estimated recombination crossover sites detected in the Turnip mosaic virus concat aligned sequences by the recombination detecting programs. Crossover site shows locations of individual genes/regions in 1J genome (Ohshima et al. 1996) . \u2020Recombinant isolates identified by the recombination detecting programs; R (rdp), G (geneconv), B (bootscan), M (maxchi), C (chimaera) and S R (siscan) programs in rdp2, and S S (siscan synonymous site analysis) in siscan version 2 and P (phylpro) programs. The analysis was carried out with default settings for the different detection methods and a Bonferroni-corrected P values cutoff of 0.01. Typical pattern for the detected recombinants is listed. \u2021The reported P-value is for the program in bold type in RDP2 and is the greatest P-value among the isolates calculated for the region in question. \u00a7One of the parents of recombinants showed Z-values greater than 3 in (on analysis of all nucleotidesites in S R of rdp2 program; thus, lower Z-values of one of the parents identified in S S of siscan version 2 program is shown. \u00b6For all isolates, see Fig. 2 . Recombination crossover sites of the isolates (in parentheses) were detected by the programs using 40 entire genomic sequences available from the international gene sequence data bases. For details of the genogroups, basal-BR, Asian-BR and world-B, see Ohshima et al. (2002) . and so recombination type patterns K and M may be artefacts. Two of the different recombination patterns (I and J) were found in many isolates. The other recombination patterns were only found in the genomes from three or fewer isolates. Isolates with patterns I were found in China and Japan, whereas patterns A, C-G, J and O-Q were found only in Japanese isolates and patterns B and L only in those from China. Isolates with pattern N, the mosaic genome pattern with basal-BR sequence, were found in both China and Korea but not in Japan. In summary, the Japanese population seemed to have a greater number of different recombination patterns than the Chinese (Table 4) . Earlier analyses using recombination detecting programs showed that as larger numbers of sequences are obtained and compared, the parents of tentative recombinants are more certainly identified (Tomimura et al. 2004 ). One recombination pattern Q was newly found among East Asian isolates in the present study, and thus, in summary, a total of 45 out of 118 (38%) of the East Asian isolates were found to be 'clear' recombinants. We checked the Fig. 2 Recombination maps of Turnip mosaic virus genomes; the estimated nucleotide positions of the recombination sites (RSs) are shown relative to the 5\u2032 end of the P1 gene using the numbering of the 1J sequence (Ohshima et al. 1996) . The approximate RS positions were estimated from data analysed using the phylpro and siscan version 2 of the original software (Gibbs et al. 2000; Weiller 1998 ) and also rdp (Martin & Rybicki 2000) , geneconv (Sawyer 1999) , bootscan (Salminen et al. 1995) , maxchi (Maynard Smith 1992), chimaera (Posada & Crandall 2001) and siscan in the rdp2 program, together with that published by Ohshima et al. (2002) and Tan et al. (2004) . The wide box shows the P1, R12 + Pro and CP regions sequenced in this study, the narrow box shows the regions not yet sequenced. The boxes in white, grey and black are, respectively, of world-B, Asian-BR and basal-BR group parents as assessed by phylogenetic analysis. The thin line indicates 'tentative' RS that may be false positives (see Results), and the bold line indicates 'clear' RSs. The recombination type patterns K and M may be nonrecombinant (see Results). Recombination type pattern H of Nepalese isolates (NPL4 and 5) is included, and the isolates had interlineage RSs at nt 605 in P1 gene (see Tan et al. 2004). geographical distribution of different recombination patterns and found that isolates with identical recombination patterns tended to be grouped and, when present in different countries, also tended to be grouped within those countries, an indication of founder effects during colonization (data not shown).",

However, the resulting trees were inconsistent, and had poor bootstrap support for some lineages as had previously been found for concat sequences (Tomimura et al. 2004) . We therefore excluded the interlineage recombinant sequences and calculated trees from the concats of the remaining 139 isolates. The trees were obtained by ML, MP and NJ methods, and the ML tree is shown in Fig. 3 . All the trees partitioned most of the sequences into the same four consistent groups as reported earlier: basal-B, basal-BR, Asian-BR and world-B Tomimura et al. 2003 Tomimura et al. , 2004 Tan et al. 2004 ). However, no East Asian isolate fell into the basal-B group, which is sister group to all others in the ML, MP and NJ phylogenies, consists mostly of Eurasian isolates, and is most closely related to the JYMV and ScMV outgroup sequences. The remaining isolates form two major lineages one of B host type isolates, the 'world-B group', and the other of BR host type isolates, mostly from East Asia, and itself forming two lineages, the 'basal-BR group', which includes a few European isolates and the 'Asian-BR group'. The Chinese isolates fell into both the Asian-BR and world-B groups, whereas Japanese isolates occurred in all three groups. Within the world-B and basal-BR groups, there were discrete Asian sublineages. The basal-BR group seemed to be split into at least three sublineages.",

Chinese isolates had fewer different recombination patterns than Japanese isolates, many of which were interlineage recombinants of world-B \u00d7 Asian-BR groups of BR host types. Furthermore, only three of the patterns were unique to China; one isolate with pattern B and L, and two others with pattern N. Thus, the recombination patterns did not yield additional phylogeographical information. Many East Asian recombinant isolates had parents from different major lineages (i.e. interlineage recombinants) with RSs in the middle of P1 genes (Fig. 2) ; therefore, we calculated trees from the concats after discarding the 5\u2032terminal 306 nts of the P1 genes (894 nt from 5\u2032 noncoding region in the genome of original 1J isolate, refer Fig. 2) of each isolate. These trees were calculated for 97 East Asian isolates of known collection year including the nonrecombinants and the intralineage recombinants identified in this study. Figure 4 A shows the ML tree, but all three methods, ML, MP and NJ, partitioned most sequences into the same three consistent groups; basal-BR, Asian-BR and world-B. Many Chinese and Japanese isolates, but not all, seemed to be clustered in country-specific lineages in each of the three major lineages. Some Taiwanese and Japanese isolates clustered into a single lineage in the world-B group (Fig. 4A) . Likewise, the basal-BR group consisted only of Japanese isolates but these split into three sublineages I, II and III, and although there were only a few isolates from Honshu-Hokkaido, they, and the Kyushu isolates, clustered into sublineages of the world-B and basal-BR groups. Star-like phylogenies were seen in basal-BR and Asian-BR groups.",

This indicates that there is selection against most amino acid changes, namely 'negative selection', in most of these regions, although all had a d n / d s ratio in the range reported for most other DNA and plant RNA viruses (Garc\u00eda-Arenal et al. 2001; Rubio et al. 2001) . The largest d n /d s ratio was for the 5\u2032-terminal region of the P1 gene, whereas the d n /d s ratios for the Chinese and Japanese populations and for the different phylogenetic lineages were almost the same in all the genes and concats analysed by the two methods.

Both the '1999-tree' and the '2000-tree' partitioned the sequences into three groups, basal-BR, Asian-BR and world-B, whereas the basal-BR group consisting many Japan/Kyushu isolates appeared after 1999. Temporal information can also be obtained from trees, because if different lineages are evolving at similar rates then the lengths of the branches, or the diversity of different parts of the tree, give an indication of their age. This is probably legitimate for this TuMV data as the paml and mega analyses described above revealed almost no significant selection differences between the lineages except in the Taiwanese population. The nt diversity (average number of nt substitutions per site in each pair of sequence variants) was estimated for each genomic region (P1, 6K2, VPg, NIa-Pro and CP genes), each country population, each lineage and each collection period. These analyses showed appreciable differences between the lineages. The P1 gene was the most variable when all isolates were compared, but not, as would be expected, when different country populations/lineages of the isolates were considered separately (data not shown). The Chinese populations of both Asian-BR and world-B isolates were more diverse than the Japanese populations in most of the genes examined, suggesting that the Chinese populations may be older, although to confirm this it will be necessary to compare nt diversities of the isolates collected in comparable areas of China and Japan. However, when the pre-and post-1999/2000 populations of Chinese isolates were compared, they were found to be closely similar; the later ones from Kyushu were significantly more diverse (data not shown). Interestingly, isolates of the two basal-BR sublineages that appeared in Japan during and after 2000 had less than one quarter the diversity of the Asian-BR and world-B isolates ( Table 6 ). The average year of collection of the pre-and post-1999/2000 populations in China and in Japan was 2 and 4 to 5 years apart, respectively.",

On the other hand, positive values are expected to be produced by balancing selection and a decrease of the population size. We found that the shapes of pairwise mismatch distribution for world-B groups in all subpopulations were similar, and were ragged and multimodal, supporting long-term demographic equilibrium or an insufficient number of samples ( Fig. 5A , C, D, H). On the other hand, the shape of mismatch distribution for basal-BR III group in Kyushu was smooth and unimodal and a good visual fit with the expectation of the sudden expansion model (Fig. 5G) . Likewise, a highly significant values of Tajima's D, Fu & Li's D and F statistical tests supported demographic expansion of the same isolates (Table 6 ). Whereas the mismatch distribution for the Asian-BR and basal-BR II groups in Kyushu were not unimodal, the accumulation of low-frequency mutations was characteristic of nonequilibrium population dynamics (Fig. 5E, F) , and notably, the number of pairwise differences at the peak of the first 'wave' in the distribution was almost similar to that of basal-BR III group of Kyushu, suggesting a recent demographic instability in the Asian-BR and basal-BR II groups of Kyushu. The haplotype diversity in all groups analysed had a value of 1.000 (Table 6 ).",

These isolates were cloned by single-lesion isolations because of the high frequency of mixed infections in the field, not only with other viruses, especially CMV, but also other isolates of TuMV (approximately 2% in Kyushu), which had caused problems when gene sequencing for earlier studies (data not shown).

In addition, there are few reports of phylogeographical studies of plant viruses (Tsompana et al. 2005 ) like that we report here of TuMV from species of Brassicacae in China and Japan. We have collected samples of nearly 300 plants of R. sativus, B. rapa, B. juncea and other crucifers showing mosaic symptoms plants, over the past decade in Kyushu island. However, although many of R. sativus plants reacted positively with TuMV antisera in enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) tests as it is relatively easy to detect TuMV in this species, it was more difficult to find TuMV-infected Brassica plants.

Our earlier studies showed that the mapping of recombinational events as well as phylogenetic relationships were useful for tracing the migration and evolution of TuMV (Tan et al. 2004 ). In the present study, many RSs in the P1 gene of the TuMV genome were similar in the Chinese and Japanese isolates. Although it is not possible to exclude the possibility that the RSs positions coincide with recombinational hotspots, it is also possible that genomes with the same recombination type pattern have a shared ancestor. In fact, from the analysis of the concat sequences, although number of isolates in recombination type patterns is different in each country, the isolates of recombination type pattern I, and nonrecombinants in Asian-BR and world-B groups migrated in both country populations (Figs 2 and 3) and hence probably represent the successful 'founder' TuMVs of East Asia. However, although the recombination type patterns and nonrecombinants did not give additional insights, they were congruent with the relationships indicated by the phylogenetic analyses. Note that some of the conflicting signals attributed to recombinant events may be due to differences in rate of evolution among genes and among lineages.",

Using this measure, it has been found that there is strong negative selection (i.e. selection against change) operating on most animal and plant viruses (Domingo et al. 2001; Garc\u00eda-Arenal et al. 2001) . In TuMV, the P1 gene has the largest d n /d s ratio, whereas the NIa-Pro has the smallest, indicating that different genes are under different selective constraints (Tomimura et al. 2004) . In this study, we looked at the d n /d s ratios of five genes in the populations in each country and district, and found that the values for Chinese and Japanese isolates were almost identical but that for the Taiwanese population was much greater (Table 5) , indicating that constraints in different local population may not be similar. We also tried to estimate d n /d s ratios of each lineage in each country using intralineage recombinant sequences (data not shown), but numbers of isolates available for these analyses were very small (see Fig. 4B ,C), and no worthwhile estimate could be obtained.",

Such star phylogenies were seen in the Asian-BR and basal-BR groups of '1999-tree' and '2000-tree' (Fig. 4B, C) . Furthermore, phylogenetic analyses of isolates collected pre-and post-1999/2000 showed that new lineages of closely related basal-BR II and III isolates appeared around Kyushu after 1999, and the sudden expansion of the isolates in the basal-BR III lineage was strongly supported by the deviations from the neutral equilibrium model for the geographical lineages with overall lack of nt diversity (Table 6) , and by the analysis for mismatch distribution within individual geographical group (Fig. 5) . Mismatch distribution analysis provided evidence of sudden expansion of the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) coronavirus (Yeh et al. 2004) . A combination for high haplotype diversity and low genetic diversity, assessed by mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) markers, is taken as evidence of a recent population expansion after a genetic bottleneck (Grant & Bowen 1998) and this was found for a plant virus, TSWV, using nt sequences (Tsompana et al. 2005) . This combination was especially seen in the basal-BR III group of TuMV population, and this conclusion may also apply to this population, although RNA viruses may evolve faster than mtDNA, and nt mismatches may produce unusually large haplotype diversities. However, it is likely that the results obtained from the population of basal-BR III indicate a sudden expansion after a bottleneck, namely a 'founder effect', confirming other conclusions of our study.",

On the other hand, no nonrecombinant basal-BR isolates, like those found in southern Japan, were found in China. So the question then is from where did the basal-BR lineage in Japan come? It may have originated in Japan, or from the TuMV population in other parts of the world and our existing phylogenetic evidence does not distinguish between these two possibilities. TuMV is transmitted by aphids in a nonpersistent manner but there is no record of seed transmission (Provvidenti 1980) although several potyviruses are. However, the occurrence of TuMV in broad bean (Vicia faba) and in saffron (Crocus sativus) in China (Hu et al. 1996; Chen & Chen 2000) , in Allium ampeloprasum in Israel (Gera et al. 1997) and in Ranunculus (Ranunculus asiaticus) in Italy (Tomimura et al. 2004) indicates that the host reactions of TuMV, including its ability to be seed-borne, may need to be re-examined. The other alternative would be metapopulation events involving colonization and extinction as has been reported for several plant viruses including CMV, tobamoviruses and TSWV (Fraile et al. 1997; Garc\u00eda-Arenal et al. 2000 , 2001 Tsompana et al. 2005) .",

At present, the only effective control of TuMV is through the use of host plant genetic resistance, either conventional or transgenic, or by cross-protection with attenuated strains. Hence, it is very important for us to understand the phylogeography of TuMV population in each country or region. This analysis provides the first demonstration, to our knowledge, of population structuring and species-wide population expansions in a single-stranded plant RNA virus, utilizing a population genetic approach.",
