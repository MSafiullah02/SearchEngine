Chan School of Public Health, Boston, MA, USA health crises, including infectious diseases, can cause heightened psychological distress (Garfin et al., 2020) . We still don't know whether high levels of COVID-19 media exposure can result in amplified anxiety and depression in the general population as well (Holmes et al., 2020) . So, in the current study, we examined the association between media exposure to information about COVID-19 and psychological distress in the general population in China.",

Psychological distress was measured by the Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9) and the General Anxiety Disorder Scale (GAD-7). Besides, we collected respondents' information on demographics, history of mental illness, and social support (based on the Oslo Social Support Scale [OSSS-3]) (Kocalevent et al., 2018) , as well as other COVID-19 exposure covariates by asking respondents whether they were diagnosed with COVID-19; whether they had a history of contact with COVID-19 cases; whether someone close to them was diagnosed with COVID-19; and whether they or someone close to them was working on the front lines of COVID-19 (Table 1) . Multivariate linear regression was used to explain the association between media exposure to information about COVID-19 and psychological distress in the general population after adjustment for covariates.",

The dose-response relationships between COVID-19 media exposure and PHQ-9 and GAD-7 scores are shown in Figure 1. 3 To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study that demonstrates a dose-response relationship between media exposure to information about COVID-19 and psychological distress in the healthy population. The negative effects of repeated media exposure on mental health can be seen in other community crises, including the 9/11 terrorist attack, the Boston Marathon Bombings, and the 2014 Ebola epidemic (Garfin et al., 2020) . Media-fueled psychological distress can engender misplaced help-seeking behaviors that will consume large amounts of health care resources. Our study suggests that it may be true of the COVID-19 epidemic as well and necessitates future actions to buffer the negative effects of repeated media exposure to information about COVID-19. ",
