By the end of May 2009, it had spread to over 40 countries worldwide [WHO, 2009a]. While the classification of this novel influenza virus as a pandemic strain has been debated [Cohen and Carter, 2010; Evans, 2010; Tang et al., 2010], it has prompted a reassessment of recent pandemic preparedness practices [Cordova\u2010Villalobos et al., 2009; Del Rio and Hernandez\u2010Avila, 2009; del Rio and Guarner, 2010; Rizzo et al., 2010; Tay et al., 2010]. An important lesson identified in many retrospective studies was the importance of collecting, analyzing and disseminating high quality surveillance data for informing diagnostic, therapeutic and public health interventions [Cordova\u2010Villalobos et al., 2009; Kumar et al., 2010; Rizzo et al., 2010; Sigmundsdottir et al., 2010; Tay et al., 2010].",

Several real\u2010time reverse transcription PCR (rRT\u2010PCR) assays that have been developed for simultaneous detection of influenza A and B viruses in single\u2010tube format, may fit this purpose [Selvaraju and Selvarangan, 2010; Chen et al., 2011; Huber et al., 2011; Papillard\u2010Marechal et al., 2011; Shisong et al., 2011; Li et al., 2012; Salez et al., 2012]. However, the robustness of these assays has not been characterized extensively on routine clinical samples or proficiency testing materials. A sensitive and specific high\u2010throughput duplex universal influenza A and B rRT\u2010PCR method is described, which was validated on 2,458 clinical specimens and proficiency testing material from the Quality Control for Molecular Diagnostics and the Royal College of Pathologists of Australasia external quality assurance programs.",

In addition, optimizing this assay for a high\u2010throughput platform, the LightCycler\u00ae 480 II, may make it more applicable for diagnostic laboratories with high workloads. The 13 discrepant cases that were undetected by the subtyping assays were likely due to stochastic variations at low viral loads approaching the lower limit of detection of the assays. The quantitative capability of this universal influenza A assay has been demonstrated in a viral load comparison study between influenza A/H1N1/2009, seasonal influenza A/H1N1, and A/H3N2 in Singapore [Lee et al., 2011a].",

This assay also fulfills the ongoing surveillance needs in all phases of pandemic preparedness planning, as recommended by the World Health Organization [WHO, 2005b], and in addition, has demonstrated the potential, at least in silico, to detect the recent reassortant virus, A/H3N2/v.",
