This contradicts the fact that accreditations and standards for medical education and training are regulated at the national level. Are patients living in this country different when they cross State lines? Does the human anatomy or physiology change when crossing the Mississippi River from Missouri to Illinois, or driving across the George Washington Bridge from New York to New Jersey for example? Does a physician really need to have four different medical licenses from Arizona, Colorado, New Mexico, and Utah to treat patients separated by the lines of the Four Corners Monument? Or is lupus (a disease I treat) different if a patient wakes up in an Eastern versus a Western time zone?",

Arguably, the current model of medical licensure in the U.S. restricts patients\u2019 access to care. A physician who is entrusted to practice medicine in one State in the U.S. should be entrusted to do the same all over the country. Needlessly having to apply and go through verification processes for another medical license for a different State entails significant effort, time, and resources that are better invested in taking care of patients. There is no value in contacting medical schools and residency training programs to verify the medical degree and training records when a physician is already licensed and practicing in good standing in another State. This laborious verification process has already been done by the State where the physician is already licensed. Do State medical boards not trust one another or is there a different motivation to keep this illogical bureaucratic process in place?",

A possible solution is to require State medical boards, by a federal mandate, to recognize medical licenses issued by any of the States or territories within the country. Physicians will continue to be required to hold a medical license in good standing to practice medicine. However, this license can be issued from any State regardless of where the physician practices within the country. Maintenance of a good standing license to practice medicine will be through the original State that issued that license. Indeed, this is exactly the case for the Veterans Affairs (VA) health system, the clinical practice within the National Institutes of Health (NIH), and in military hospitals and clinics around the country. A medical license issued by any State allows practice in any health facility affiliated with these aforementioned health systems. Patient care is and should not be different if patients are military personnel, visit the NIH clinics, see their physician at a VA facility, or none of the above. So why not make this borderless medical licensure model a rule rather than an exception? Many millions of Americans receive care at VA or military medical facilities.",
