Human rhinoviruses (HRVs) have been increasingly recognized as serious pathogens that are frequently associated with lower respiratory tract infection, mortality and prolonged shedding [4], [5]. There is a need for effective antiviral therapy in this population, and new therapeutics are under investigation [6], [7]. Defining risk factors for prolonged shedding may provide important information to risk-stratify subjects in antiviral clinical trials with viral load endpoints. Furthermore, risk factors for prolonged viral shedding may inform effective infection prevention practices. The objective of this study was to evaluate viral and host factors associated with prolonged HRV shedding in the upper respiratory tract in HCT recipients.",

Only subjects with respiratory symptoms at the time of first HRV detection in the 100 days post-HCT were included in the current study. Subjects were included only if the end of the viral shedding period could be defined, which was if a negative viral PCR test result occurred within 2 weeks of the last positive test [9].

Among 26 sequenced nasal samples, 69% were species A, and 15% each were species B and C. The median shedding duration did not differ among species (P = .17) (Supplementary Figure S1). Another 45 patients were asymptomatic at the time of first detection of HRV and the median initial viral load of these 45 patients did not differ from that of the 38 symptomatic patients (P = .92). Among the 45 initially asymptomatic patients, 18 subsequently developed respiratory symptoms during the shedding period (time to development of symptoms: median 14 days; interquartile range, 7 to 37 days) but no patient progressed to lower respiratory tract infection.",

Among respiratory viruses, HRV is prone to shed for long periods in transplant recipients [5]. Prolonged viral shedding can potentially contribute to HRV transmission and be of particular concern for infection prevention, although hospital outbreaks have been mainly reported for other respiratory viruses [17], [18], [19], [20], [21], [22].

Viral shedding duration is often used as an endpoint in clinical trials of new antivirals [23], [24], [25], and identifying risk factors for prolonged shedding is thus critical for appropriate stratification of patients in randomized trials. However, data on factors associated with prolonged shedding of respiratory viruses are limited, with the exception of influenza virus in mainly immunocompetent populations and coronavirus in HCT recipients [9], [26], [27]. The present study showed initial high viral load was a risk factor for prolonged HRV shedding in HCT recipients, consistent with our previous study of coronavirus [9].",

We were able to perform sequencing in only two-thirds of patients, primarily due to low viral load. Thus, our ability to detect small differences in shedding duration among HRV species was limited. Quantification of HRV using RT-PCR assays with a consensus HRV primer and probe set may be limited due to the diversity of HRV genotypes; reverse transcriptase digital PCR has shown more accurate quantification [28]. However, the overall performance of RT-PCR appears to be similar to reverse transcriptase digital PCR for most genotypes. Low Ct value, dichotomized at the median, was consistently associated with prolonged shedding in all models. Therefore, different quantification methods are unlikely to significantly impact our conclusion. Finally, we defined the end of shedding as the first negative virus detection regardless of whether patients continued to have respiratory symptoms. It is possible that shedding at viral loads below the limit of detection was present, but we felt that this definition would be more objective than using the duration of symptoms because ongoing symptoms cannot be necessarily attributed to persistent HRV infection.",
