In 1988, the Ministry of Health of the People's Republic of China issued a set of hygienic standards for public places, in which concentration limits of carbon monoxide (CO), carbon dioxide (CO 2 ), inhalable particulate matter (PM 10 ), and bacteria were stipulated. These standards played important roles in improving sanitation in public places as well as controlling the propagation of diseases. Revised versions of these standards, GB 9663-9673-1996 and GB 16153-1996, were promulgated by the General Administration of Quality Supervision, Inspection and Quarantine of the People's Republic of China in 1996. In the revised standards, the concentration limits of formaldehyde were also included.The first hygienic standard for residences, GB/T 16127-1995 \"Hygienic standard for formaldehyde in indoor air of house,\" was issued by the General Administration of Quality Supervision, Inspection and Quarantine of the People's Republic of China in 1995. After that, a series of hygienic standards for other pollutants in indoor air were successively promulgated by the General Administration of Quality Supervision, Inspection and Quarantine and/or the Ministry of Health of the People's Republic of China, including GB/hemolyticus), and GB 18468-2001 ( p-dichlorobenzene). These standards laid good foundations for the establishment of IAQ standard in China.The prevalence of indoor decoration and refurbishment of existing and new buildings since the late 1990s has caused serious indoor air pollution in China due to the extensive use of indoor decorating and refurbishing materials containing large amounts of harmful substances. In order to control indoor air pollution effectively, the Chinese government has greatly accelerated the pace of establishing IAQ-related regulations and standards since 2000.GB 50325-2001 \"Code for indoor environmental pollution control of civil building engineering,\" jointly issued by the Ministry of Construction and the General Administration of Quality Supervision, Inspection and Quarantine of the People's Republic of China on November 26, 2001, took effect on January 1, 2002.", "latex": null, "type": "figure"}, "FIGREF3": {"text": "first national indoor air quality standard (GB/T 18883-2002), released jointly by the General Administration of Quality Supervision, Inspection and Quarantine, the Ministry of Health, and the Ministry of Environmental Protection of the People's Republic of China, came into effect on March 1, 2003.
