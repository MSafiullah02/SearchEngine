After 72 h of infection of Huh-7 cells, Saracatinib exhibited an EC50 of 2.9 \u03bcM and CC50 of more than 50 \u03bcM [44]. Whereas, gemcitabine was shown to be effective against MERS-CoV infected Huh-7 cells with an EC50 of 1.2 \u03bcM and a complete viral depletion at a dose of \u22651 \u03bcM [44]. Inhibitory effect of resveratrol against MERS-CoV was tested using infected Vero E6 cells. After 48 h, cell death was significantly reduced in the treatment group with resveratrol. The study showed that resveratrol inhibited MERS-CoV after entry in the cells and when resveratrol was added at same time of MERS-CoV, there was no difference in cell proliferations and viral titers compared with cells treated after infections [45].",

Moreover, the combination of INF-\u03b12b and ribavirin in Vero cells showed augmentation of action and facilitates the reduction of the doses of IFN-\u03b12b and ribavirin to lower concentrations suggesting possible utility in clinical use [30]. Saracatinib with Gemcitabine had no difference in cytotoxicity compared with Saracatinib alone but was less cytotoxic compared with gemcitabine alone [44]. There were many drugs that were used in vitro and showed effectiveness, however, translating the findings from these studies into clinical trial remains of particular importance especially taking into consideration availability, pharmacokinetic properties, pharmacodynamic characteristics and possible side effects [69].",
