Healthy skin microbial communities are dominated by bacteria with low viral representation 1-3 , mainly bacteriophage. Specific eukaryotic viruses have been implicated in both common and rare skin diseases, but cataloging skin viral communities has been limited. Alterations in host immunity provide an opportunity to expand our understanding of microbial-host interactions. Primary immunodeficient patients manifest with various viral, bacterial, fungal, and parasitic infections, including skin infections 4 . Dedicator of cytokinesis 8 (DOCK8) deficiency is a rare primary human immunodeficiency characterized by recurrent cutaneous and systemic infections, as well as atopy and cancer susceptibility 5 . DOCK8, encoding a guanine nucleotide exchange factor highly expressed in lymphocytes, regulates actin cytoskeleton, which is critical for migration through collagen-dense tissues such as skin 6 . Analyzing deep metagenomic sequencing data from DOCK8-deficient skin samples demonstrated a notable increase in eukaryotic viral representation and diversity compared with healthy volunteers. De novo assembly approaches identified hundreds of novel human papillomavirus genomes, illuminating microbial dark matter. Expansion of the skin virome in DOCK8-deficient patients underscores the importance of immune surveillance in controlling eukaryotic viral colonization and infection.",

These shotgun metagenomics microbial reads were mapped to a multikingdom reference database and compared with similar skin metagenomics data from five representative healthy volunteers (three adults and two children 1, 20 ) . Skin microbiome of healthy adults and children is dominated by bacteria with low viral abundance (8.7% mean phage abundance and 6.4% mean eukaryotic viral abundance; Supplementary Table 3 , also in refs 3, 20 ). By contrast, the skin of DOCK8-deficient patients displayed a significantly higher relative abundance of eukaryotic viruses (mean relative abundance 92.6 \u00b1 9.2, P = 0.00061; Fig. 1b, Supplementary Fig. 1a , and Supplementary Table 4 ). Three DOCK8-deficient patients (patients D8_pt23, D8_pt24, and D8_pt27) with > 25% of metagenomics reads mapping to the bacterial kingdom also had less severe systemic complications associated with DOCK8 deficiency in the first two decades of life. Skin-associated bacterial and fungal communities of DOCK8-deficient patients demonstrated similar diversity and composition when compared with healthy controls, based on shotgun metagenomics, bacterial amplicon (V1-V3 of 16S rRNA gene), and fungal amplicon (ITS1 region) datasets ( Supplementary  Fig. 1b ,c and ref. 19 ).",

Our reference-based analyses revealed a large but variable fraction of unmapped reads (10.3-98.8%, mean 46.7%). To explore our hypothesis that unmapped reads represented novel viral genomes, we performed reference-free de novo assembly of filtered reads from each skin sample after subtracting mapped bacterial and fungal reads. From this large dataset, 10,435 contigs were eukaryotic viruses with high coverage, of which 8,631 contigs were from the Papillomaviridae family. To identify novel viral genomes, all (near-complete) papillomavirus genomes (6-8 kilobase (kb)) were screened against the reference Papillomavirus Episteme (PaVe) database and then clustered at 95%, which resulted in 250 nonredundant HPV genomes ( Supplementary Fig. 3 ). Incorporating these HPV genomes into our reference genome database contributed to a significant increase in mapped reads, from 53.3 \u00b1 20.1 to 72.3 \u00b1 18.8% (P < 2.2 \u00d7 10 \u221216 ). At one extreme, the percentage of mapped reads increased from 1.2 to 92% with inclusion of new HPV genomes, illuminating skin microbial 'dark matter' (Supplementary Fig. 4a and Supplementary Table 9 ). Three additional eukaryotic viral contigs were novel genotypes of singlestranded DNA (ssDNA) Torque teno virus, a genus of Anelloviridae ( Supplementary Fig. 4b) , with 76-82% nucleotide identity with the closest reference genome for the gene used for phylogenetic classification ( Supplementary Fig. 4c ) 21 .",

We overcame the technical hurdle of extracting sufficient biomass for sequencing from noninvasive skin samples and collected a total of 207 skin and nares swabs from DOCK8-deficient patients; within-patient samples were combined based on skin physiology and/or anatomical proximity to achieve sufficient RNA for sequencing (see Methods for details). We generated 31 Gb of rRNA-subtracted, microbial RNA-seq data from four combined skin sites of 26 DOCK8-deficient patients (Supplementary Table 13 ). The majority of viral RNA reads mapped to DNA viruses, mostly Papillomaviridae and Polyomaviridae (Supplementary  Table 14) , which may indicate active viral replication. The relative abundances of the genera of polyomaviruses and papillomaviruses detected in the RNA and DNA datasets were highly similar ( Supplementary Fig. 7a ). The nares of DOCK8-deficient patients revealed colonization with several RNA viral families, including members of Coronaviridae (coronavirus species), Picornaviridae (rhinovirus, enterovirus, and kobuvirus species), Orthomyxoviridae (influenza), and Paramyxoviridae (parainfluenza) (Fig. 4a ). Using reference-free de novo assembly of viral and unmapped RNA reads, we identified contigs with 85-97% identity to distinct reference human rhinovirus (HRV) genomes, in multiple samples from three different patients. From these, we constructed two full genomes of putative novel rhinovirus variant and genotype (Rhinovirus A genome detected in a single patient and a Rhinovirus B genome detected in two other patients), with 89 and 80% nucleotide identity to the closest genotype (A60 and B93), respectively, at the VP1 gene used for phylogenetic assignment ( Supplementary Fig. 7b ). One DOCK8-deficient patient exhibited high relative abundances of rubella virus, whose genome carried signature mutations of the vaccine strain. Among the nine patients who had RNA viruses detected in their nares, five had undergone clinical laboratory testing for respiratory pathogens and three of these five had positive results that directly corresponded to clinical laboratory results (D8_Pt16, D8_Pt19, D8_Pt21). The other two patients had negative clinical tests and notably lower relative abundances (less than 0.5%) of rhinovirus (D8_Pt20) and parainfluenza (D8_Pt20, D8_Pt21).",

Amplicon sequencing data were processed using the mothur pipeline 32 as previously described 19, 31 . Briefly, 16S sequences were preprocessed to remove primers and barcodes and subsampled to 5,000 sequences per sample. Chimeras from PCR artifacts were identified and removed using VSEARCH in mothur 33, 34 . Remaining sequences were classified to the genus level using RDP training set 16. ITS1 amplicon sequences were trimmed to 200 bp and subsampled to 5,000 reads per sample in mothur. Sequences were then classified to genus level using the k-nearest neighbor classifier against an updated custom ITS1 database 35 . Phylotype analysis for both 16S and ITS1 amplicon sequences was performed according to mothur MiSeq SOP (https://www.mothur.org/wiki/MiSeq_SOP).",

To identify divergent papillomavirus genomes, we eliminated the coverage requirement and identified another 183 contigs as likely Papillomaviridae on the basis of contig size (~7 kb) and L1 typing. A similar search for divergent Polyomaviridae returned no additional contigs. From 8,914 Papillomaviridae contigs, we subsetted 3,725 that were within a size range of 6-8 kb, which is similar to the size of an average HPV genome (~7.9 kb). These genomes were masked using an HPV reference downloaded from the PaVe database (ref. 42 and www. pave.niaid.nih.gov) to remove all regions \u2265 500 nt with more than 90% identity by BLASTN. Genomes with \u2265 4,000 nt unmasked were kept, resulting in 2,189 genomes. Papillomaviridae have circular genomes, which is problematic for alignment-based clustering algorithms, so the Mash algorithm 43 was used instead to build a graph of 95% identical contigs that were then clustered using SPICi 44 . This threshold was set to remove redundant genomes but still retain genomes that are distant enough to represent distinct HPV types. This clustering resulted in 208 cluster seeds and 42 singleton genomes, yielding a final pool of 250 nonredundant HPV genomes. Using BLASTN to compare these 250 nonredundant genomes with themselves, we verified that their nucleotide identity between cluster representatives did not exceed 90%.",

However, since rRNA reads represented a significant portion of the data, some of the samples had a very low number of reads (the lowest sample having only 35,331 filtered reads). As a consequence, the assembly yielded a large number of contigs (625,306) with only about one-third passing quality filtration (206,371) (Supplementary Table 17 ). Of these, 122,771 were assigned according to our contig analysis pipeline, and only 24,217 were a hit to a viral genome. Almost all viral contigs were assigned to DNA viruses (mainly Papillomaviridae), in accordance with the high abundance we detected in read mapping from both DNA and RNA data. A total of 1,458 contigs were assigned to RNA viruses. We detected several contigs from the rhinovirus family, in patients D8_Pt16, D8_Pt21, and D8_Pt22. Contigs from patient D8_Pt16 were identified as a variant of Rhinovirus A60, and contigs from patients D8_Pt21 and D8_Pt22 were identified as a variant of Rhinovirus B97. The Picronaviridae study group defines novelty of a rhinovirus genotype by the coding sequence of the conserved VP1 gene, with slight differences between the species; an HRV type should have at least 13% (HRV-A) or 12% (HRV-B) nucleotide divergence from all other HRV types. Nucleotide divergence lower than this threshold has been used to assign new variants of a genotype 49, 50 . With primers designed at terminal contig sequences and cDNA derived from the original patient RNA, we amplified across the gaps, Sanger sequenced, and assembled two complete novel rhinovirus variants and genotypes (~7 kb), as classified by the conserved VP1 protein 49, 50 (Supplementary Fig. 7b ).

All HPV L1 nucleotide sequences of reference HPV genomes (as determined by the International Human Papillomavirus Reference Center) were downloaded from the PaVe database (ref. 42 and www.pave.niaid.nih.gov). All L1 sequences were aligned using MUSCLE v3.8.31 (ref. 47 ) and the resulting alignment was used to construct a maximum-likelihood phylogenetic tree, using FastTree v2.1.9 (ref. 48 ). The tree was visualized with FigTree (http://tree.bio.ed.ac.uk/software/figtree/). SNP analysis of MCV. MCV abundance, subtype, and coverage were determined using Clinical Pathoscope 53 and a database of five complete MCV genomes (U60315, KY040275, KY040276, KY040277, KY040274). MCV-1 SNPs were called against U60315 using Snippy (https://github.com/tseemann/snippy) with default parameters on samples with at least 15 times coverage of the MCV-1 genome (49 samples, 10 subjects). Core SNPs were called using the snippy-core program (244 core SNP positions). A histogram of SNP positions identified uneven SNP coverage, indicative of recombination. Gubbins 54 was used to analyze recombination blocks between MCV-1 genomes and identified one block centered on the MC054L gene, which encodes a putative IL-18 binding protein 55, 56 . Of the two DOCK8-deficient patients who did not display clonal carriage, D8_Pt08 showed two distinct MCV-1 strains, each exclusive to distinct body sites, and D8_Pt15 exclusively carried MCV-1 at two body sites and MCV-2 at three other body sites, demonstrating the potential for localized skin colonization from distinct subtypes. A phylogenetic tree was built based on SNPs outside these recombinant regions.",

The nonparametric Wilcoxon rank-sum test was used to determine statistically significant differences between microbial populations. Unless otherwise indicated, P values were adjusted for multiple comparisons using the Bonferroni or FDR correction (by applying the p.adjust function in R using method = 'bonferroni' or 'fdr'). Statistical significance was ascribed to an alpha level of the adjusted P \u2264 0.05. Similarity between samples was assessed using the Yue-Clayton theta similarity index with relative abundances of HPV species. The theta coefficient assesses the similarity between two samples based on (i) number of features in common between two samples, and (ii) their relative abundances, with \u03b8 = 0 indicating totally dissimilar communities and \u03b8 = 1 identical communities 57 .",
