In healthy rabbits, the nostrils constantly twitch at a rate of 2\u2013120 times per minute, unless the rabbit is at rest (Brewer and Cruise, 1994) or is unwell. The nasal cavity is lined with a protective layer of mucus that entraps foreign particles and bacteria. The mucus also prevents water loss and enhances the sense of smell. The nasal glands secrete serous fluid into the nasal cavity. In the rabbit, there is glandular tissue along the nasal septum and a cluster of glands, collectively known as the lateral nasal gland, occupy the entire wall between the nasal cavity and maxillary sinus (Bojsen-Moller, 1964). The function of these nasal glands is to moisten inspired air, which has a role in thermoregulation. The position of the conchal and maxillary sinuses and the structures of the nasal cavity are illustrated in Figures 1.18 and 5.1. There is no frontal sinus.",

            "text": "\nPasteurella multocida is associated with a number of diseases of rabbits (see Section 14.5.1). Pasteurellosis is not a recognized problem in wild rabbits but is a serious disease in colonies of commercial or laboratory rabbits. In pet rabbits, although P. multocida is found as an opportunist pathogen in many secondary infections, primary pasteurellosis is uncommon. It is usually encountered in situations where there has been increased stress and an increased number of interactions with other rabbits: for example, the newly acquired rabbit that has recently been bought from a breeder or pet shop. Respiratory disease is the most common manifestation. Acute infections and septicaemia occur, especially in young animals, but chronic, insidious recurrent infections are more common in the adult pet rabbit. Rhinitis, conjunctivitis, nasolacrimal duct infections, otitis media, tracheitis and bronchopneumonia can all be caused by P. multocida; however, it is wise to remember that other organisms can be involved. The bacteria can spread to other sites from the nasal cavity where it can reside as a commensal organism. Infection often persists despite mucosal and humoral antibody responses in addition to effusive neutrophilic exudation. The deleterious effect of pasteurellosis on laboratory colonies of rabbits and interference with experimental procedures has resulted in the evolution of expensive \u2018pasteurella-free\u2019 rabbits for use in research. The epidemiology of pasteurellosis is discussed in Section 14.5.1. See Figure 11.1\nfor the many predisposing factors that trigger disease.",

(1983) surveyed the capsular and somatic serotypes of P. multocida found in healthy and diseased rabbits and concluded that while several major serotypes can be differentiated, one (serotype 12A) was predominant in both healthy and diseased individuals. The development of rhinitis and other respiratory tract problems in the newly acquired young rabbit is likely to be due to pasteurellosis. In the older animal, stress or poor husbandry can result in a flare-up of a latent infection. The possibility of disease being due to pasteurellosis does not replace the need for diagnostic evaluation. Poor air quality, caused by high ammonia levels or dusty hay, irritates the respiratory tract and predisposes secondary infection. Ventilation and good air quality are important in disease prevention. Pasteurellosis can be spread between animals and the disease is endemic in most breeding establishments. It often causes problems in premises such as sanctuaries, where several animals are housed in close proximity. A distance of greater than 1.8 m (6 feet) or \u2018sneezing distance\u2019 is needed to control the spread of infection between individuals (Whittaker, 1989).",

Young rabbits that have recently been stressed by weaning, change in routine and transport are often exposed to infection at the breeding establishment where they originated. Rabbits housed with several others in sheds and outhouses are susceptible. In older, individual pet rabbits, bacterial infection is less likely to be a cause of rhinitis than dental disease, which is common. Nasal foreign bodies can cause rhinitis (see Section 11.3). Myxomatosis is another possible cause of rhinitis. Myxomatosis in rabbit colonies can present as rhinitis in association with ocular discharge. Aerosol infection is more likely to give respiratory tract signs than insect spread (see Section 14.6.1). Myxomatosis is progressive and almost invariably fatal.",

Sedation or anaesthesia is usually required to take a deep nasal swab for culture. Culture results do not necessarily illustrate the organism causing the clinical signs; it merely gives an overview of the organisms present. Caution is therefore necessary in their interpretation. Depending on the method of collection of swab samples for culture, contaminants can be present, presenting a false result. Common causes of inaccurate results are failure to clean the external nares prior to sample collection, and failure to insert the swab deeply enough into to nasal cavity. False-positive and -negative results can occur on bacterial culture due to inaccuracies in various laboratory methods of bacterial strain identification.",

Opacity of the conchal sinus indicates the presence of exudate (see Figure 11.2B). Erosion of the ethmoturbinates can be seen on a well-exposed radiograph. However, the presence of P. multocida or other bacterial infection and erosion of the turbinates does not rule out the possibility of an underlying foreign body or perapical abscess. Large abscesses or rhinoliths can form in the nasal passages because of tooth root infection (see Figure 5.12).",

(2010) demonstrated that plain radiography of the rabbit skull had a specificity and sensitivity for finding fluids similar to that of cat and dog radiography, and confirmed that the dorsoventral view was the most consistently useful one. The presence of exudate in the external ear canal does not signify the presence of otitis media. In many pet rabbits, especially lop-eared breeds, it is difficult to visualize the tympanic membrane due to the presence of waxy ear secretion. Post-mortem examination of the ear canal of pet rabbits often reveals the presence of inspissated pus that occludes the external ear canal. The presence of purulent material in the external ear canal does not necessarily signify the presence of pus in the tympanic bulla. Neither does pus in the tympanic bulla always cause otitis interna and vestibular symptoms (see Section 10.4.3). Radiological changes can often be seen as an incidental finding on skull radiographs (see Figure 11.4\n). It seems likely that rabbits with pus in the external ear canal and/or the tympanic bulla will have impaired hearing, although they may appear clinically normal. Some observant owners can detect hearing deficits in their pets and aggression in rabbits has been attributed to deafness when rabbits have been startled by the unheard approach of their owners. Computed tomography scanning or ultrasonographical examination of the area (King et al., 2007) will give more useful and sensitive information.",

Acute upper or lower respiratory infections can be responsive to prompt antibiotic and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory medication. An antibiotic that is unlikely to cause diarrhoea but is effective against P. multocida should be selected. Examples include enrofloxacin, trimethoprim sulpha combinations, tetracyclines, parenteral cephalexin or penicillin. In vitro, most rabbit isolates of P. multocida are susceptible to penicillin, chloramphenicol, tetracycline, erythromycin, novobiocin and nitrofurans with a variable susceptibility to streptomycin, kanamycin, neomycin and sulphonamides. Pasteurella multocida is usually resistant to clindamycin and lincomycin (Manning et al., 1989). More recently Sellyei et al. (2009) demonstrated the increasing resistance of P. multocida isolates from swine and poultry to certain antibiotics (namely, sulphonamides, tetracyclines and aminoglycosides); however, they found third-generation quinolones such as enrofloxacin to be effective. The tendency for the fluoroquinolones to concentrate in the mucosa of the maxillary sinus at levels greater than that found in the blood (Dan et al., 1989) makes this drug a good first choice for treating Pasteurella. Penicillin has been used widely to treat rhinitis in laboratory rabbits (Gaertner, 1991). Concurrent infection with other pathogens such as Bordetella bronchiseptica can affect the response to therapy. Tilmicosin is an effective antibiotic in the treatment of acute pasteurellosis in sheep and has been used to treat rabbits despite the possibility of a fatal adverse reaction to the drug.",

Bulla osteotomy has been suggested as a treatment for rabbits with severe, refractory, chronic otitis media in association with vestibular signs such as head tilt and anorexia (Redrobe, 2000). Two surgical techniques have been described (Redrobe, 2000, Swindle and Shealy, 1996). Chow et al.

Dehydration leads to dry airways, resulting in increased viscosity of secretions, decreased ciliary function, inflammation and degeneration of the mucosa. The inclusion of fresh leafy vegetables in the diet can increase a rabbit\u2019s fluid intake, particularly if they are fed wet (water is left on the vegetables after washing). Water can be added to inspired gases by the use of humidifiers or placing the rabbit in a steamed-up room such as a bathroom, although care must be taken to ensure the rabbit does not overheat. Nebulization is sometimes used as a method of introducing antibiotic, decongestants and other agents directly into the respiratory tract and to loosen secretions and bring relief. Nebulization introduces charged particles into the respiratory tract as an aerosol. In other species, nebulization is used to treat lower respiratory tract disease. Medication introduced by nebulization is unlikely to reach the tympanic bullae or paranasal sinuses or to penetrate thick mucopurulent exudate in rabbits. Mucolytic agents such as bromhexine or N-acetyl-cysteine have been recommended for nebulization in rabbits with rhinitis (Meredith, 2000). In other species, N-acetyl-cysteine is irritating to mucosal surfaces and can inactivate certain antibiotics when it is mixed with them (McKiernan, 1983). Systemic bromhexine (Bisolvon, Boehringer Ingelheim) can be used as a mucolytic in rabbits. In cattle and pigs, when bromhexine is administered simultaneously with oxytetracycline, the antibiotic in the bronchial mucus is considerably increased (product datasheet).",

A high rectal temperature (in excess of 40\u00b0C) is suggestive of heat stroke, and temperatures of 42\u201345\u00b0C are associated with a fatal outcome (Adolph, 1947). The pathological changes in heat stroke include a reduction in blood pressure (secondary to vasodilation), which can result in reduced cerebral perfusion, cerebral ischaemia and oedema (Shih et al., 1984). Reduced perfusion can also affect renal and hepatic function. A metabolic acidosis and electrolyte abnormalities also occur. Treatment is aimed at reducing body temperature, e.g., bathing in cold water, wetting the ears and blowing them with a cold hair-drier and administration of intravenous fluids. The administration of a vasodilator such as acepromazine may be helpful. Close monitoring of acid\u2013base and electrolyte parameters may help guide treatment.

Vitamin E deficiency, coronavirus infection and some bacterial infections such as salmonellosis and pasteurellosis have been recorded as causes of cardiomyopathy in laboratory rabbits (Marini et al., 1999). Tyzzer\u2019s disease not only causes intestinal and hepatic lesions but can also cause a myocarditis resulting in myocardial fibrosis in those animals that survive (Percy and Barthold, 1993). Encephalitozoon cuniculi has been reported as a cause of myocarditis in rabbits (Pakes and Gerrity, 1994). Stress and catecholamines are proven causes of cardiomyopathy and experimental models of the human disease can be provided by keeping rabbits in overcrowded conditions (Weber and Van der Walt, 1975). Myocardial necrosis and fibrosis have been recorded in rabbits anaesthetized with ketamine/xylazine combinations by continuous infusion. Marini et al. (1999) postulated that hypoxaemia and coronary vasoconstriction result in cell death and necrosis. The rabbit has limited collateral coronary circulation and is therefore predisposed to ischaemia induced by coronary vasoconstriction. The authors draw an analogy with rabbits used as models of catecholamine-induced cardiomyopathy in which \u03b1-adrenergic-mediated coronary vasoconstriction occurs. Hypotension and hypoxaemia are further contributory factors.Key Points 11.3Cardiac disease in rabbits\n\u2022Rabbits can suffer from both congenital and acquired heart disease.\u2022Clinical signs can include dyspnoea, exercise intolerance, weight loss and anorexia.\u2022Diagnostic evaluation should include a full physical examination, auscultation, ECG, chest radiography and echocardiography.\u2022Treatment recommendations follow those for other species; please see Table 3.1 for additional information.\u2022In an emergency decompensation situation, oxygenation, and application of 3 mm of isosorbide mononitrate paste to the inner pinna can be life-saving.\n\n",

Aortic arteriosclerosis occurs in rabbits and can cause seizures or vague symptoms such as inactivity and weight loss. Mineralization of the aorta occurs in hypercalcaemic rabbits, usually in association with renal disease that impairs calcium excretion. Mineralization of the aorta is seen radiologically (Shell and Saunders, 1989) and on post-mortem examination. Calcification of the aorta is often associated with calcification of the kidney (see Section 12.5.2). Calcification of soft tissues can be caused by excessive intestinal absorption of calcium, such as in cases of vitamin D toxicity.",

Coronavirus was found in the testicular tissue. An analogy has been made between rabbit coronavirus and feline infectious peritonitis. Clinical signs vary, but infected rabbits are generally pyrexic and many die within 5 days of infection. Pulmonary oedema, pleural effusion and dilation of the right ventricle are found at post-mortem. As in feline infectious peritonitis, hypergammaglobulinaemia is a feature of chronic infection that can be manifested by myocardial degeneration, ascites and uveitis. An enteric form has also been described. At the present time, coronavirus-induced pleural effusion and cardiomyopathy have only been reported in experimentally inoculated rabbits (DiGiacomo and Mare, 1994).
