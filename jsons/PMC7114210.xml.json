            "text": "Non life insurance claims, by nature, are not correlated to financial markets, excepted in case of events like natural disasters, epidemics, or serious economic recession. For example, in 2003, the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) spread across several countries and affected with a delay the insurance industry in different ways. Some areas of impacted insurance operations are clear\u2014event cancellations coverage, travel insurance and life and health policies. This epidemic also slowed down economic exchanges and indirectly caused turmoil in financial markets. More recently, during the financial crisis of 2008, the number of claims covered by credit insurances surged in US, as underlined in a recent report from the IMF (2016). As last example, we mention climate changes. It is already affecting and will over time significantly affect the incidence of natural conditions such as: tropical cyclones; winter storms; wild-fires; hail storms; lightning strikes; droughts and floods. These events are expected to affect significantly property claims to non-life insurers. In parallel, climate change will have a huge economic and social impact and will lead to financial instability. These observations motivate us to study the influence of a potential contagion between the insurance and financial markets on the asset\u2013liability management policy of insurers.",

            "text": "The literature about the modeling and management of non-life insurance company is vast. The starting point of research in this field is the classical Cramer\u2013Lundberg (1903) risk model, in which the arrival of claims is modeled by a Poisson process. Since then, many extensions have been developed and proposed bounds on the insurer\u2019s ruin probability in various frameworks. Later, Bj\u00f6rk and Grandell (1988) and Embrechts et al. (1993) introduced a Cox process in the Cramer\u2013Lundberg model, for the modeling of claim arrivals. Albrecher and Asmussen (2006) studied a Cox process with shot noise intensity. Dassios and Zhao, 2011, Dassios and Zhao, 2012 analyzed the clustering phenomenon of claims, caused by a self-exciting process. Another strand of the literature focuses on the optimization of investment, reinsurance and dividend policies, in a Cramer\u2013Lundberg approach. For example, Browne (1995) showed in a one-dimensional diffusion model that the strategy maximizing the expected exponential utility of terminal wealth also minimizes the ruin probability. Asmussen and Taksar (1997) studied the optimal dividend policy for an insurer. Hipp and Plum (2000) optimized the investment policy of a non life insurer\u2019s surplus, in a Brownian setting. Schmidli, 2002, Schmidli, 2006 instead of maximizing the utility of the surplus or dividends, adapted the investment and reinsurance strategies to minimize the probability of ruin. Kaluszka, 2001, Kaluszka, 2004 examined the optimal reinsurance problem under various mean\u2013variance premium principles. Yuen et al. (2015) considered the optimal proportional reinsurance strategy in a risk model with multiple dependent classes of insurance business. And recently, Yin and Yuen (2015) studied the optimal dividend problems for a jump diffusion model with capital injections and proportional transaction costs. Whereas Zheng et al. (2016) investigated the robust optimal portfolio and reinsurance problem for an ambiguity-averse insurer.",

            "text": "This work studies the optimal proportional reinsurance, dividends and asset allocation for a non-life insurer, in presence of a contagion risk between financial and insurance activities. Drawing on the theoretical and empirical background regarding the market time scale, as in An\u00e9 and Geman (2000) or Salmon and Tham (2007), we build time-changed dynamics with chronometers that are integrated positive Hawkes processes. This approach, inspired from Hainaut (2016d) introduces a nonlinear dependence between assets and liabilities. Hawkes processes developed by Hawkes, 1971a, Hawkes, 1971b and Hawkes and Oakes (1974), are parsimonious self-exciting point processes for which the intensity jumps in response and reverts to a target level in the absence of event. This dynamics is increasingly used in finance to model the clustering of shocks. Empirical analysis conducted in A\u00eft-Sahalia et al., 2015, A\u00eft-Sahalia et al., 2014 or in Embrechts et al. (2011) emphasizes the importance of this effect in stocks or CDS markets. They also underline that clustering is not characterized by a single jump but by the amplification of this movement that takes place over days. Recently, Hainaut, 2016a, Hainaut, 2016b detects self-excitation in interest rate markets. And the paper of (Hainaut, 2016c) analyzes the impact of the clustering of jumps on prices and risk of variable annuities. In this work, Hawkes processes determine the pace of market clocks.",

When the insurer\u2019s margin is positive, the linear correlation is induced by incomes from the insurance activity, reinvested in the financial market.

Starting from this observation, we respectively model financial returns and insurance claims by a Brownian motion and a jump process, observed on distinct random scales of time. This approach allows us to replicate clustering of shocks observed in financial and in insurance markets. It also introduces contagion and random correlation between assets and liabilities. The chronometers measuring the time scales of financial and insurance markets are respectively denoted by \u03c4tS and \u03c4tL. They are positive increasing processes defined as the integrals of two processes (\u03bbtS)t and (\u03bbtL)t on a probability space \u03a9, endowed with a probability measure P and a natural filtration denoted by (Gt)t: (1)\u03c4tS\u2254\u222b0t\u03bbsSds\u03c4tL\u2254\u222b0t\u03bbsLds.

Whereas the moment generating functions of jumps are respectively \u03d5JS(\u03c9)\u2254E(e\u03c9JS) and \u03d5JL(\u03c9)\u2254E(e\u03c9JL). We assume that the couple of intensities \u03bbtS and \u03bbtL obeys to the next dynamics: (2)(d\u03bbtSd\u03bbtL)=(\u03b1S(\u03b8S\u2212\u03bbtS)\u03b1L(\u03b8L\u2212\u03bbtL))dt+(\u03b7SS\u03b7SL\u03b7LS\u03b7LL)\ufe38\u039e(dZtSdZtL). These processes revert respectively at speeds \u03b1S and \u03b1L toward \u03b8S or \u03b8L. The parameters \u03b7LS,\u03b7SS,\u03b7SL,\u03b7LL are constant and positive. This last relation underlines the main features of our approach: contagion, mutual and self-excitation. Indeed, when the clock of the financial (resp. insurance) market speeds up due to a jump of ZtS (resp. ZtL), the chronometer of the insurance (resp. financial) market accelerates proportionally. This also raises the volatility as longer periods, measured on the market time scale, are observed on the same invariable chronological time scale. Another consequence of a jump is an instantaneous increase in the probability of observing a new financial or actuarial shock as \u03bbtS and \u03bbtL are the intensities of point processes ZtS and ZtL. We check by direct differentiation that intensities are the sum of a deterministic function and of two jump processes, (3)\u03bbtS=\u03b8S+e\u2212\u03b1St(\u03bb0S\u2212\u03b8S)+\u03b7SS\u222b0te\u2212\u03b1S(t\u2212s)dZsS+\u03b7SL\u222b0te\u2212\u03b1S(t\u2212s)dZsL,\u03bbtL=\u03b8L+e\u2212\u03b1Lt(\u03bb0L\u2212\u03b8L)+\u03b7LS\u222b0te\u2212\u03b1L(t\u2212s)dZsS+\u03b7LL\u222b0te\u2212\u03b1L(t\u2212s)dZsL. These expressions are useful to find closed form expressions of expected intensities, from which we will infer the conditions guaranteeing the stability of jump processes.

Increasing \u03f52 raises the correlation between \u03c41S and \u03c41L from 0% to 12%. It also speeds up on average the clocks and standard deviations slightly move up. This confirms that a large range of positive correlations may be achieved by introducing mutual excitation in the dynamics of intensities.

            "text": "We develop now the dynamics of markets in which the insurance company operates. We assume that the financial market is composed of two assets: cash and stocks. The risk free rate earned by the cash account is denoted by r and is constant. The stock price, noted St, is a time-changed geometric Brownian motion: (15)dStSt=rdt+(\u03bc\u2212r)d\u03c4tS+\u03c3dW\u03c4tSS where \u03bc and \u03c3 are positive constants and WtS is a Brownian motion. In this approach, only the risk premium depends upon the market time scale. The Brownian motion being a stable process, this relation is equivalent to the following one which emphasizes that the drift and the volatility of stock prices are random and proportional to the intensity of the financial clock: dStSt=(r+(\u03bc\u2212r)\u03bbtS)dt+\u03c3\u03bbtSdWtS. In a certain way, the dynamics of stock prices is comparable to these stochastic volatility models, with a random drift. In our approach, the volatility is indeed mean reverting like in the Heston\u2019s model, except that it is driven by a bivariate self-exciting jump process. Using the It\u00f4\u2019s lemma leads to the following relation for the log-price dlnSt=(r+(\u03bc\u2212r\u2212\u03c322)\u03bbtS)dt+\u03c3\u03bbtSdWtS and from which we infer the stock price (16)St=S0exp(rt+(\u03bc\u2212r\u2212\u03c322)\u222b0t\u03bbsSds+\u03c3\u222b0t\u03bbsSdWsS),=S0exp(rt+(\u03bc\u2212r\u2212\u03c322)\u03c4tS+\u03c3W\u03c4tSS). On the side of liabilities, we consider a time-changed version of a risk process that is the difference accumulated premiums and aggregated claims: Lt=c\u03c4tL\u2212\u2211i=1N\u03c4tLJi before reinsurance. c is the premium rate, Ji are the random claims and Nt is a Poisson process with a constant intensity \u03bb. The statistical distribution of J is not specified but we assume that its moment generating function, denoted by \u03d5J(\u03c9)=E(e\u03c9J), exists. Its probability density function is written \u03bdJ(.). The premium rate is assumed strictly bigger than the expected claims, c>\u03bbE(J). If this condition is not fulfilled, the ruin occurs with certainty. Notice also that the dynamics of liabilities is equivalent to the following one: (17)dLt=cd\u03c4tL\u2212JdN\u03c4tL=c\u03bbtLdt\u2212JdNtb where Ntb is a point process with marks of size J and an intensity equal to (\u03bb\u222b0t\u03bbsLds). Indeed by definition, the probability of observing k claims till (chronological) time t is equal to P(N\u03c4tL=k)=(\u222b0\u03c4tL\u03bbds)kk!e\u2212\u03bb\u03c4tL=(\u222b0t\u03bb\u03bbsLds)kk!e\u2212\u222b0t\u03bb\u03bbsLds=P(Ntb=k). The natural filtration associated to St and Lt is denoted by (Ht)t and the augmented filtration carrying all the information is Ft\u2254Ht\u2228Gt (remember that Gt is the natural filtration of chronometers). In the specification of our model, the claims process is not directly correlated to the financial market. However a dependence appears through the correlation that exists between stochastic clocks driving insurance and financial markets. This dependence is measured by the next proposition that has also an interesting economic interpretation.

Secondly, it depends on the product of the average risk premium of stocks, (\u03bc\u2212r\u221212\u03c32), and of the insurer\u2019s average profit, (c\u2212\u03bbE(J)), that may also be interpreted as an insurance risk premium. If c is equal to the pure premium rate, c=\u03bbE(J), the expected surplus and the covariance are both null. In this case, we do not observe any linear dependence between assets and liabilities. And this despite the fact that the asset price and risk process are clearly not independent by construction. The covariance differs from zero only if the insurance business is profitable on average. The linear dependence is in this case induced by insurer\u2019s incomes that are next reinvested in the financial market.

This point is detailed in a study of Hainaut (2016d) that proposes an approached method to calibrate similar L\u00e9vy process, time-changed by an integrated self-excited subordinator. Here, we only summarize how to adapt this procedure to our ALM framework and refer to the original article for details. The method is based on the premise that intensities remain constant and equal to their asymptotic averages \u03bb\u221eS and \u03bb\u221eL: (19)(\u03bb\u221eS\u03bb\u221eL)\u2254limt\u2192\u221e(E(\u03bbtS|G0)E(\u03bbtL|G0)) as defined by Eq. (10). Under this assumption, lnSt and Lt become stationary processes. The probability density function (pdf) for a given set of parameters \u0398 may then be computed by inverting numerically the moment generating function (18) with a two dimensions Discrete Fourier Transform (2D DFT). The set of parameters \u0398 is next fitted by maximization of the log-likelihood calculated with the numerical pdf. The 2D DFT algorithm is provided in Hainaut (2016d). This study also reveals that despite the bias introduced by the hypothesis (\u03bbtS,\u03bbtL)=(\u03bb\u221eS,\u03bb\u221eL), the fit is of good quality. An alternative approach consists firstly to develop a particle filter to retrieve the sample path of \u03bbtS and \u03bbtL (again we refer to Hainaut (2016d) for a presentation of this filter). And secondly to combine it with a Particle Markov Chain Monte-Carlo method, as explained in Andrieu et al. (2010).",

The premium includes a safety margin, from 2.5% to 20% and the premium rate is such that c=\u03bb\u03c1(1+safetymargin). The initial provision L0, is equal to 5.

The results reported in Table 3\nemphasizes that the gap between the real ruin probabilities and the upper bound varies between 5.52% for a margin of 2.5% to 11.60% for a margin of 12.5%.

The spread between these probabilities of default varies from 1.74% to 3.49%, depending upon the level of safety margin. This spread is due to the limited number of simulations, to the time horizon and to numerical errors generated by the Euler discretization.",

The first line is related to financial operations whereas the second line is the income from insurance activities. If we replace in this last equation dStSt and dLt by their expressions (15), (17), we obtain the following SDE for the surplus: dXt=(rXt+\u03c0t(\u03bc\u2212r)\u03bbtSXt\u2212dt+cqt\u03bbtL)dt+\u03c0tXt\u03c3\u03bbtSdWtS\u2212qtJdNtb where Ntb is a point process with an intensity equal to (\u03bb\u222b0t\u03bbsLds). If the horizon of management is noted T, the insurer optimizes the investment, reinsurance and dividend policies. The criteria of optimization are the discounted utility of dividends distributed over this period and the discounted utility of the terminal surplus. If these utilities are respectively denoted by U1(.) and U2(.), and if the discount rate is \u03b2, the value function of the insurer is defined by the following relation: V(t,Xt,\u03bbtS,\u03bbtL,\u03c4tS,\u03c4tL)=max\u03c0t,dtqtE(\u222btTe\u2212\u03b2(s\u2212t)U1(ds)ds+e\u2212\u03b2(T\u2212t)U2(XT)|Ft).

We will see that this function plays a crucial role in the determination of the optimal reinsurance and investment policy. The optimal ratio of reinsurance is indeed solution of a nonlinear equation that does not admit any closed form expression. However, if we approach the exponential in Eq. (31) by a first order Taylor\u2019s development, we infer that the optimal reinsurance rate satisfies approximately the next relation: \u222b0+\u221eze\u2212Cqz\u03bdJ(dz)\u2248\u222b0+\u221e(z\u2212Cqz2)\u03bdJ(dz)E(J)\u2212CqE(J2)=c\u03bb, from which we obtain finally that (33)qt\u2217\u22481C(t,T)E(J2)(E(J)\u2212c\u03bb),=(1\u03b311r(1\u2212e\u2212r(T\u2212t))+1\u03b32e\u2212r(T\u2212t))1E(J2)(c\u03bb\u2212E(J)). As C(t,T) is strictly negative, the optimal reinsurance rate is proportional to the safety margin on claims size (c\u03bb\u2212E(J)), embedded in the premium rate. Notice that the reinsurance ratio exclusively depends on frequency of claims measured on the insurance market scale and not on the chronological time scale. From this last relation, we also infer that no claim is re-insured if c is equal to the pure premium rate, c=\u03bbE(J). If the premium rate is higher or lower than this pure premium, the reinsurance rate is inversely proportional to the second moment of the claims size. Finally, the optimal reinsurance is independent from the insurer\u2019s wealth. It is a pure deterministic function of time that converges toward 1\u03b32E(J2)(E(J)\u2212c\u03bb) at expiry.",

At the end of the time horizon, the insurance company holds (\u03bc\u2212r)\u03c32\u03b32 of stocks.

            "text": "In many circumstances, working with Brownian motions rather than jump processes allows to obtain analytical results. On the other hand, approaching a claims process by an equivalent Brownian dynamics is often a good approximation, particularly if the number of claims is high. These reasons motivate us to study the case in which the liabilities of the insurance company are driven by the next SDE: dLt=cd\u03c4tL\u2212\u03bbE(J)d\u03c4tL+\u03bbE(J2)dW\u03c4tLL where W\u03c4tLL is a Brownian motion. The scaling property of the Brownian motion allows us to rewrite the liability process as follows: (36)dLt=(c\u2212\u03bbE(J))\u03bbtLdt+\u03bbE(J2)\u03bbtLdWtL from which we infer that the risk process at time t is the following sum: Lt=(c\u2212\u03bbE(J))\u03c4tL+\u03bbE(J2)\u222b0t\u03bbsLdWsL. This expressions reveals that both the average and variance of Lt are proportional to the chronometer of the insurance market: (c\u2212\u03bbE(J))E(\u03c4tL|F0) and \u03bbE(J2)E(\u03c4tL|F0). It is possible to show that the covariance between liabilities and the log prices of stocks is induced by the dependence between clocks of financial and insurance markets. And this covariance is still provided by Proposition 3.1. We will not present all features of this process like the joint mgf of Lt and logSt. However, most of proofs presented in previous sections are easily adaptable to the Brownian case. As previously, \u03c0t, dt and qt denote respectively the percentage of the stocks hold by the insurer, the dividend and the retention level. In the Brownian framework, the dynamics of the surplus is driven by the next relation: dXt=(1\u2212\u03c0t)Xtrdt+\u03c0tXtdStSt\u2212dt+dLt\u2212(1\u2212qt)cd\u03c4t+(1\u2212qt)(\u03bbE(J)\u03c4tL\u2212\u03bbE(J2)\u222b0t\u03bbsLdWsL). If we replace in this last equation dStSt by its expression (15) and dLt by its approximation (36), we infer that Xt is now ruled by the SDE: dXt=(rXt+\u03c0t(\u03bc\u2212r)\u03bbtSXt\u2212dt+cqt\u03bbtL\u2212\u03bbqtE(J)\u03bbtL)dt+\u03c0tXt\u03c3\u03bbtSdWtS+qt\u03bbE(J2)\u03bbtLdWtL. By construction, the Brownian motions WtL and WtS are independent and the correlation is only induced by the stochastic clocks. Then \u03c0tXt\u03c3\u03bbtSdWtS+qt\u03bbE(J2)\u03bbtLdWtL\u223cN(0,\u03c0t2Xt2\u03c32\u03bbtS+qt2\u03bbE(J2)\u03bbtLdt). We can then replace these two Brownian motions by a single one Wt defined on the same filtration as follows dXt=((r+\u03c0t(\u03bc\u2212r)\u03bbtS)Xt\u2212dt+qt(c\u2212\u03bbE(J))\u03bbtL)dt+\u03c0t2Xt2\u03c32\u03bbtS+qt2\u03bbE(J2)\u03bbtLdWt. The insurer adjusts the investment, dividend and reinsurance policy so as to maximize the following objective: (37)V(t,Xt,\u03bbtS,\u03bbtL,\u03c4tS,\u03c4tL)=max\u03c0t,dtqtE(\u222btTe\u2212\u03b2(s\u2212t)U1(ds)ds+e\u2212\u03b2(T\u2212t)U2(XT)|Ft) where U1(y)=\u22121\u03b31e\u2212\u03b31y and U2(y)=\u22121\u03b32e\u2212\u03b32y are the utility from dividends and from the terminal surplus.

The optimal investment policy is given by\n(38)\u03c0t\u2217=\u2212(\u03bc\u2212r)\u03c32C(t,T)1Xt.\nThe optimal dividend is equal to\n(39)dt\u2217=\u22121\u03b31[ln(\u22121\u03b32C)+A+CX+BS\u03bbS+BL\u03bbL]\nand the optimal reinsurance ratio is\n(40)q\u2217=\u2212(c\u2212\u03bbE(J))\u03bbE(J2)C(t,T).\n\n",

If the insurer does not charge any fee above the pure premium, there is not any linear dependence between the asset and liability despite the fact that the asset price and the risk process are not independent by construction. Another interesting feature is that the short term correlation between markets is negligible. In our approach, a delay is induced between the occurrence of an event in one market and the reaction of the other market. In other words, there is well contagion between the insurance and financial markets but the impact is not instantaneous.",
