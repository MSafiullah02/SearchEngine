In the years, many governments around the world have reduced the economic resources to their healthcare systems and the current organisation of our hospitals may not fit present needs. The huge prevalence of the disease requires the distribution of patients according to different levels of interventions from simple medical supervision to oxygen (supplementation or High Flow), to non-invasive ventilation (NIV), to intubation while preserving safety of doctors and nurses.4, 5 Do we have the infrastructure for these purposes? Furthermore, the shortage of ICU beds and the higher mortality among oldest and weakest people pose dramatic ethical questions regarding the triage of the patients with possible need of \u201cSophie's Choice\u201d.6\n",

Other than to provide the healthcare professionals with the proper safety equipment, an appropriate use of available technologies is required.7 Robots, Artificial Intelligence, Big Data Analytics, mobile apps and tele-medicine can be effective resources also in fighting pandemics. In fact, robots have a high potential in different infection-related applications, such as environment disinfection, medications and food delivery, assessment of clinical parameters and security checks.8 For disease prevention autonomous or remote-controlled robots can be deployed for noncontact ultraviolet surface disinfection.9 Mobile robots embedded with temperature measurement sensors (i.e., thermal sensors) and vision algorithms (for facial recognition) may lead to cost-effective, fast and effective screening of population in hospitals and public areas (airports, railway stations, ports, underground stations, etc.).10 Robots may also be deployed to optimise nasopharyngeal and oropharyngeal swabbing in terms of increase of the process speed and protection of healthcare professionals. Another potential area of application is represented by delivery of samples and medicines to infected persons by means of drones or autonomous ground robots.11\n",

We highlight at least three precious lessons:1.\nThe expense in the healthcare field must be considered an investment and not a cost. We must build strong healthcare systems, able to work well in normal and to promptly react in extraordinary times. Let us think of the economic impact produced by the pandemic. How much of the economic losses might have been avoided by previous major investments in healthcare? What is the opportunity cost today of not having done so? We must not repeat the same mistake! Let's invest in research, innovation, technology, organisational models.2.\nIn healthcare we must adopt a strategic approach. There are some answers that even in emergency conditions can be provided (mask production through the reconversion of some production activities, etc.), others not. How to make available in a few days, skills that take years to be trained? We need to redesign the academic programmes for specializations we may require most in the next years (such as respiratory medicine). We need to scan the horizon, trying to forecast \u2013 analysing trends in the population, in the behaviours, in the lifestyles, and in the society, and taking into account the potential large-scale events (although unlikely) \u2013 future scenarios.3.\nWe must have a common systematic approach in the response. The international community must share ways of reacting and common protocols for managing these emergencies. A global effort is required in terms of organisation in collaborative networks, and of implementation of international emergency policies. Our countries seem unprepared: (a) absence of codified procedures and predefined plans to manage events like COVID-19 outbreak; (b) different behaviours between country and country in the way of managing the emergency.\n",
