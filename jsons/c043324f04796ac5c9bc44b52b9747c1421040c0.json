HRV-14 RNA probes and oligonucleotide probes representing conserved sequences in the 5'-non-translated region were labeled with 35S and used to detect infected HeLa or WI-38 strain human embryonic lung cells in cytological preparations. ISH was shown to be specific for detection of HRV on a single-cell basis. Subsequently, in human nasal polyps infected in vitro, both oligonucleotide-and riboprobes produced a strong signal in association with ciliated epithelial cells. In human adenoids infected in vitro, a signal was observed in nonciliated epithelial cells. This study shows that HRV replicates in ciliated cells in the epithelium of human nasal polyps infected in vitro, and the presence of viral RNA in non-ciliated cells of the human adenoid infected in vitro suggests that other cell types may also support rhinovirus rep1 icat ion.",

Using HRV infection of modified organ cultures of nasal polyps and turbinates, Winther et al. [19901 did not observe any damage or cytopathic alterations in the epithelium, both in the fragment of human tissue and in the outgrowing monolayer. On the other hand, Turner et al. [19821 found that 2% of the cells sloughed in the nasal secretions of volunteers with induced colds were ciliated epithelial cells, while none of those cells were observed in the nasal secretions of normal controls. In the same study the presence of rhinovirus antigen was shown in association with sloughed ciliated cells using immunocytochemistry with a polyclonal antibody to HRV-39. Such observations suggest that rhinovirus replication occurs in ciliated epithelial cells. In spite of this evidence, rhinovirus replication in the respiratory epithelium has not been demonstrated, either in ciliated or nonciliated epithelial cells, while the cells are still attached to the epithelium. Previous work using immunofluorescence to localize infected cells in sections of organ cultures of human nasal polyps infected in vitro were inconclusive, mainly because of the presence of non-specific fluorescence [Hamory et al., 19771. The feasibility of using ISH to identify the sites of rhinovirus replication in the respiratory epithelium was examined. The present study was undertaken to develop an in situ hybridization assay for detection of rhinovirus infection in cell cultures and to apply it to human organ cultures of nasal polyp and adenoids infected in vitro.",

At this point, selected slides were incubated with 150 pgiml of bovine pancreatic RNase (CalBiochem, San Diego, CA) in 10 mM tris-HC1 pH 7.5, 1 mM EDTA, for 1 hour at 37\"C, followed by washing with active 0.1% DEPC-PBS for 15 rnin and with 4 changes of fresh PBS, for 1 rnin each, with vigorous shaking. The slides were dehydrated with ethanol, and air-dried. Those to be hybridized with RNA probe were covered with 100 pl of prehybridization mixture consisting of 50% freshly deionized formamide, 1 x hybridization buffer (0.3 M sodium chloride, 10 mM tris-HC1 pH 6.8, 10 mM sodium phosphate, 5 mM EDTA), 4 x Denhardt's solution, 1 pgipl heat-denatured salmon sperm DNA (ss-DNA), 1 ,u.g/pl yeast tRNA, 10 mM DTT, 10 units of placental RNase inhibitor (Calbiochem, La Jolla, CAI, in DEPC-H20, and incubated at 40\"C, for 2-3 hours, in a humidified chamber.

Positive and negative control slides were developed within 3, 7, and 14 days of exposure. When signal to noise ratio was judged to be adequate, all slides were developed with Kodak D-19 developer for 3 minutes at room temperature, followed by a brief wash in water, fixed for 1 min in Kodak rapid fixer, and washed in tap water for 5 min. The slides were stained with toluidine blue or hematoxylinieosin, following standard procedures [Sheehan and Hrapchak, 19801 , and mounted with permount (Fisher Scientific, Springfield, NJ). Definite positive signal of ISH was considered to be an accumulation of silver grains observed in clear association with an underlying visible cell. All slide readings were under masked conditions.

The specificity of this probe in ISH studies confirms our earlier observations in dot-blot experiments (data not shown). This observation indicates dissimilarity of rhinovirus type 14 to the other rhinovirus serotypes and is in agreement with results of nucleotide alignments in the P1 region [Palmenberg, 19891, which corresponds to approximately 80% of our probe. In contrast, the oligonucleotide probes demonstrated cross-reactivity with different rhinovirus serotypes, a finding predicted from earlier studies using slot-blot hybridization [Bruce et al., 19891. The localization of rhinovirus replication in the respiratory tract has been difficult to investigate for several reasons. Firstly, rhinovirus replication in the human nasal epithelium seems to occur focally, rather than uniformly dispersed through the nasal epithelium [Winther et al., 19861 . This may create problems in sampling when random biopsies of the nasal mucosa are obtained. Secondly, the nasal secretions of patients with common colds contain cell-free virions which are free to adhere to the receptors present on the sloughed cells. This is a potential confounder of the distinction between cells with adherent virus and genuinely infected ones.",

It was also demonstrated that focal hybridization signal was in clear association with discrete ciliated cells, many of them sloughing from an apparently healthy epithelium. These in vitro findings suggest that only a small number of ciliated cells of the nasal epithelium are infected, in spite of the large inoculum used, as compared to the inoculum size that is supposed to occur in natural infections. This is in keeping with previous in vivo studies, which employed viral culture of different sites of the nasal epithelium [Winther et al., 19861. Why the infection appears to be so focal in nature is an interesting and important question which remains to be answered. This focal appearance, coupled with an apparently infrequent dispersal to neighboring cells, might be the explanation for the minimal cell damage seen in studies by light microscopy of the nasal mucosa of infected individuals shedding rhinovirus [Winther et al., 19841. Nasopharyngeal tonsils, and other lymphoid tissues along the respiratory and digestive tracts, are able to perform the transport of foreign material from the exterior to the lymphoid cells, by the action of antigen presenting cells located in the epithelium overlying the lymphoid follicles [Richtsmeier and Shikhani, 19871. In the case of viral infections, these cells may represent the pathway for entry in the host, leading to the first contact between the virus and the immune system, as shown for reovirus and M cells of the Peyer's patches of the intestine [Wolf et al., 19811. In the present study, rhinovirus RNA was detected in cells of the adenoid epithelium. Based on their morphological appearance in HE counterstained sections, we can only say that they were not ciliated cells. While combined ISH/ immunohistochemistry studies in order to further determine whether those cells are antigen presenting cells are necessary, this finding suggests that nonciliated cells may support rhinovirus replication.",

Three preparations of cells infected with HRV-14, and hybridized with the sense RNA probe, showed definite signal, but the intensity of the signal, as determined by the number of grains per cell, was approximately lilOth that obtained with the anti-sense RNA probe(Fig. lc).
