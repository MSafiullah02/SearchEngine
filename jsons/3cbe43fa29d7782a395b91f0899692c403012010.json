Among all social groups, the elderly is by far the most affected age group regarding morbidity and mortality. In multiple countries spanning several continents, there are an increasing number of reports referencing the novel coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19) spread among nursing homes. These areas are now recognized as potent hotspots regarding the pandemic, which one considers with special regard. Herein, we present currently available data of fatal COVID-19 cases throughout Hungary, along with the analysis of the co-morbidity network. We also report on viral genomic data originating from a nursing home resident. The genomic data was used for viral haplotype network analysis. We emphasize the urgent need for public health authorities to focus on nursing homes and residential service units worldwide, especially in the care of the elderly and infirmed. Our results further emphasize the recent statement released by the World Health Organization (WHO) regarding the vulnerability among seniors and especially the high risk of COVID-19 emergence throughout nursing and social homes.",

Notably, as the situation evolves worldwide surpassing 2 million cases, there are important aspects to consider. The vulnerability among individuals with underlying medical conditions and specific social groups is now evident, as there are numerous nursing homes around the world currently heavily affected by COVID-19 (Davidson and Szanton 2020; Bedford et al. 2020) .",

However, all age groups are at risk of contracting COVID-19, and seniors face a significant risk in developing a severe illness if they contract the disease due to physiological changes which come with aging and more frequently, underlying health conditions in this particular age group. Recent epidemiological data from Wuhan suggests 5.1 times higher risk of dying in symptomatic elderly patients aged 60 years and above (Wu et al. 2020) , and overall, over 95% of these deaths occurred in those older than 60 years as recent WHO data. Similar to several other European countries, the present Hungarian population shows an aging population pyramid, approximately 19% of the Hungarian population are older than 64 years, or 1.8 million people (HCSO 2020, Fig. 1 ). The very first reported COVID-19 case in Hungary was confirmed on the 3rd of March 2020. During the first 7 weeks of the epidemic, we reached the first 100 fatalities.",

Moreover, the constant movement of visitors, staff, and residents establishes a constant and complex transmission route with the outside community. Among others, outbreaks of respiratory and gastrointestinal infection predominate in this setting, e.g., influenza, rhinovirus, and norovirus infections (Juthani-Mehta and Quagliarello 2010). Today, Hungary has nearly 1100 active nursery homes with approximately 55,000 residents (HCSO 2020), which is a significant risk factor for outbreaks, and should be prioritized by public health authorities.",

According to the CDC reports, higher-risk group includes individuals with chronic lung disease or moderate to severe asthma, individuals who have serious heart conditions, individuals who are immunocompromised (e.g., as a consequence of cancer treatment, tobacco use, bone marrow or organ transplantation, immune deficiencies, poorly controlled HIV or AIDS, and prolonged use of corticosteroids and other immune weakening medications), individuals with severe obesity (body mass index [BMI] of 40 or higher), individuals with diabetes, with chronic kidney disease undergoing dialysis, or even with liver disease (CDC). Although in our data, cardiovascular disorders and diseases dominated, while chronic lung disease was present in negligible proportion, the same content of the above list mentioned by CDC was observed in the Hungarian fatalities as well, a vast part of individuals with multiple comorbidity, which is not surprising among the elderly. A recently published network-based analysis studied host-pathogen interactions (including tissue specificity), the molecular mechanisms of the infection and comorbidities as well, found that SARS-CoV-2 disease module does not directly overlap with any major underlying disease module; however, diseases closest to the COVID-19 proteins include several cardiovascular diseases and cancer, whose comorbidity in COVID-19 patients is well documented (Gysi et al. 2020) .",

The separate clustering and lack of connection between the Hungarian sequences most likely refer to the lack of sequence data. Thereby, the exact source of the nursing home sequence is hard to identify at this stage. However, it does not seem to be part of any abundant European sequence clades and is related at high extent to the Lithuanian sequence. More sequence data from Hungary and more widely from throughout Europe may reveal the exact origin and clustering level of this specific sequence.",

            "text": "Nursing homes play an important role as major clustering hotspots of the epidemic, and this is repeatedly reported by various media sources worldwide. Although published official data regarding nursing homes are only partially available in European countries, according to the report of the London School of Economics, snapshot data from varying official sources shows that nearly half of all COVID-19 deaths (ranging from 42 to 57%) appear to be happening in nursing homes, and at least in multiple European countries (e.g., Italy, Spain, France, Ireland, and Belgium) (https://www. theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/13/half-of-coronavirus-deaths-happen-in-care-homes-data-fromeu-suggests). Despite the limitations of our current knowledge, it is clear that these institutes demand special focus. In an effort to slow down the course of the epidemic, Hungary applied mitigation measures such as promoting social distancing and staying home, in order to reduce the transmission rate and shield the most susceptible elderly population, thereby preventing an over-burden to the health system. Furthermore, Hungary also applied a specific opening hours regime, ensuring daily between 0900 and 1200 h, only those above the age of 65 years are permitted to shop at grocery stores, markets, pharmacies, and drugstores. Consequently, seniors are not allowed to shop beyond this The bigger size of the bubble represents the higher number of cases, and the bolder line represents the more common comorbidities (more frequent co-occurrence of different diseases or disorders) time frame. To our knowledge, this approach is unique and has been neither suggested nor implemented elsewhere.",

This isolation may be applied as a mitigation effort focusing on the isolation of infected individuals, or more importantly, control measures should be applied to avoid the emergence of SARS-CoV-2 among these communities. Our results further emphasize the recent WHO statement regarding the vulnerability of seniors and especially the high risk of COVID-19 emergence in nursing and social homes (WHO 2020).
