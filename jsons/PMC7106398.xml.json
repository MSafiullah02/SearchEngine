The frequency of invasive fungal infection has risen substantially with the increasing numbers of immunocompromised patients, such as those infected with HIV, receiving cancer chemotherapy, immunosuppressive therapy, or treatment with broad-spectrum antibiotics.11 Evidence is mounting that fungi display highly specific adaptations in the marine environment that include the production of unique secondary metabolites.11 The fact that marine organisms contain secondary metabolites different from their terrestrial counterparts in structure and biological activity has led to the hypothesis that marine organisms may contain efficient antifungal compounds with different modes of action and selective antifungal activity compared with human cells.11\n",

In 1982, Canonico and colleagues60 reported that didemnin B has in-vitro inhibitory effects against the viruses causing Rift Valley fever LD50 0\u00b704 \u03bcg/mL), Venezuelan equine encephalomyelitisLD50 0\u00b708 \u03bcg/mL), and yellow fever (LD50 0\u00b708 \u03bcg/mL). In-vivo didemnin B at a dose of 0\u00b725 mg/kg daily in mice infected with Rift Valley fever virus gave a 90% survival rate. Despite its important antiviral activity, didemnin B is cytotoxic and inhibits cellular DNA, RNA, and protein synthesis at concentrations close to those at which viral growth was inhibited, and hence it has low antiviral selectivity and therapeutic index. The didemnins might, however, be modifiable or useful in combination with other antiviral agents to combat such difficult diseases.61 Didemnin B interferes with mitogenic signal transmission such as inhibiting kinases, phosphatases, and elongation factors. Since 1986, didemnin B has been subjected to phase 1 and 2 clinical trials for cancer by different groups, and the consensus is that with the dose schedules used, the drugs provided little efficacy and substantial toxic effects.61\n",

An intriguing strategy has been to identify the true producers of bioactive compounds to find out whether or not they are of microbial origin, based on the fact that most if not all of the marine invertebrates harbour large communities of microorganisms, including bacteria, cyanobacteria, and fungi within their tissues.76 Many studies have successfully provided data to support the involvement of microorganisms in the biosynthesis of natural products isolated from invertebrates. The major breakthrough in the characterisation of the microbial communities associated with sponges involve the application of molecular methods such as fluorescence in-situ hybridisation, with the use of group-specific 16 S rRNA-targeted oligonucleotide probes. This approach has led to the identification of the bacterial communities associated with many marine invertebrates.77\n",
