In general, decisions for which devices, tests, medical procedures, surgical interventions, or programs of care will be used in Canadian hospitals are made based on nonsystematic consideration of a \"convenience set of evidence\" provided by internal advocates or by industry representatives. Few hospitals have adopted an objective, systematic, dispassionate approach to assessing all relevant evidence and economic information to inform which technologies to take up and which to forgo. Despite the existence of external HTA agencies at the national and provincial level, there is still an important gap to be filled by HB-HTA to address contextual issues that are not assessed by external HTA agencies (i.e., competing priorities, local skills and infrastructures, resources, and trade-offs). Moreover, most technologies have not been formally assessed by external HTA agencies before hospitals make",

Further information and additional published and internal HTA reports are available elsewhere [1, . . Currently, the staff of MEDICI includes three part-time positions (director, medical director, health economist) and three full-time positions (one coordinator, one systematic reviewer and methodologist, one research assistant). The three part-time positions also hold other roles, such as teaching university courses and providing clinical services and administrative responsibilities within the university and hospital. Additionally, at any time a number of trainees and visiting researchers contribute to MEDICI activities, including postdoctoral fellows, global health fellows, clinical fellows, medical residents, visiting professors, graduate students (MSc of biostatistics and epidemiology, MSc of applied mathematics, master of library and information sciences), and undergraduate medical and health sciences students. Funding for MEDICI varies annually based on the magnitude and scope of the work requested by the funding partners. Typically, the funders include Schulich School of Medicine & Dentistry, London Health Sciences Centre, St. Joseph's Health Care, Lawson Health Research Institute, internal grants, external grants, and externally commissioned service contracts from other hospitals, clinical specialty societies, and other governmental or nongovernmental organizations.",

The hospitals have gone through a number of changes in CEOs and senior leadership over the years, resulting in changes in institutional management structures and decision-maker accountabilities. As a result, we have provided HB-HTA for a number of different committees and decision-making units within the hospital in order to remain flexible based on demand and tempered by our available human resources and funding flows. At this time, decision-making for health technology uptake and disinvestment is spread across committees and decision-making structures within the London hospitals, typically organized around clinical departmental structures according to budget accountabilities. At the time of writing, there is no centralized intake process or unified decision-making process for all technology requests for the London hospitals, and we see this as an opportunity for formal research.

If the pre-assessment suggests that the payback on comprehensive assessment efforts are likely to be commensurate with the potential magnitude of impact of the technology, and if no relevant up-to-date reviews pre-exist from other HTA agencies (including the Canadian Agency for Drugs and Technologies in Health, Health Quality Ontario, and Ontario Health Technology Assessment Committee), we perform \"de novo\" systematic reviews, meta-analyses, and meta-regressions as the first component of Know4Go. Subsequently, as needed, we determine the contextualized benefit index and local opportunity costs based potentially on local data analysis, economic modeling, sleeper analyses, and a survey of competing priorities. The comprehensiveness of the evidence, economic, sleeper analyses, and trade-off assessments depends on the question at hand, whereby high-stakes decisions receive more time and rigor than low-stakes decisions. In some cases, the evidence and/or economics is so compelling that the Know4Go and decision-making process can be truncated without performing extended analyses. The comprehensiveness and number of reviews conducted also depends on amount of human resources available within MEDICI.",

This result was not too surprising, since we had focused especially on performing evidence-based assessments and sleeper assessments for targeted high-cost drugs in 2006 and beyond. During this period, we also developed an annual request for proposals through the drug and therapeutics committee to receive requests for assessments in a coordinated fashion and to elicit sleeper issues that might not be anticipated in prior assessments. We additionally implemented a 24/7 pager system, whereby special one-off requests for non-formulary drugs could be made, which allowed a core team from the Pharmacy & Therapeutics Committee to screen all such requests for approval or rejection on a case-by-case basis. This proved especially important for effective de-implementation of some high-cost drugs (i.e., aprotinin) and for preventing indiscriminate use of newer drugs. It also served as a \"horizon scanning\" device to foresee the need for upcoming assessments for drugs with increased demand through special request system.",

This study was a retrospective before-after study, likely with many confounders. Association does not prove \"causation\" since many other changes were likely implemented in our hospital within the same time frame as we began developing and implementing Know4Go. In fact, our Know4Go approach to performing evidence-based assessment, costs, other implementation issues (i.e., social, legal, ethical, institutional factors), and trade-offs was a continued evolution and expansion of our earlier approach to evidence-based assessment introduced during the Evidence-Based Prescribing Initiative. As a result, our evolution since 1999 was one of progressively increasing the expectation of comprehensive evidence-based systematic reviews of the evidence. Additionally, it is important to note that Know4Go was not applied in its entirety, or with equal rigor, to all decisions. Due to our limited resources for HB-HTA, we developed a pragmatic approach to prioritizing requests using rapid assessment Know4Go and subsequently assessing subcomponents of Know4Go (at the least, evidence + economics; if pertinent, also assess sleepers and opportunity cost) to address higher-cost or higher-stake drugs more thoroughly than lower-stake and lower-cost drugs. Another concern is that the data from 2004 were incomplete, and we remain uncertain regarding the verity of the drug cost information for that year. Perhaps most importantly, the goal of HB-HTA is not primarily to impact costs. Therefore, a key limitation was that patient outcomes were not measured. These limitations are similar for many assessments of HB-HTA in the literature, and this highlights the need for more rigorous assessments in the future, such as through adequately powered controlled trials in order to establish increased confidence of the range of impacts of HB-HTA on a variety of outcomes such as clinical outcomes, institutional impacts, costs, and return-on-investment.",

The underlying challenge that is germane to this is the ever-present need to \"prove\" the value of the HB-HTA unit, often before gaining approval for continued annual operational funding. This constant need to \"prove\" our worth results in a dual challenge to produce HTA for the hospital proactively while also evaluating the impact of the HB-HTA program and procuring grants to provide funding to expand services and methodologies beyond the core-funded services. This constant need derives from the continual budget shortfall for hospitals in the publicly funded healthcare setting, where demand always exceeds available resources. This growing demand for technology assessments highlights the need for HB-HTA growth, and yet, HB-HTA operating funds must compete directly with direct patient care shortfalls. This is a tough competition to win, given the immediate gratification of offsetting direct patient care shortfalls relative to the more remote and longer-term sustained benefits of an HB-HTA service.",

This challenge is becoming more serious as the volume of evidence and data is growing exponentially, inducing greater efforts to complete evidence syntheses and HTAs. However, decision-makers and academic collaborators who devote in-kind time (with the hopes of publishing quickly) expect ultra-rapid or expedited systematic review timelines. This challenge is compounded by our approach to HB-HTA where multiple options and post-implementation outcomes need to be evaluated to ensure the predicted effects translated to reality in our hospital. This results in multiple layers of research across multiple topics, and insufficient time to publish all assessments in the peer-reviewed literature.

However, we need to understand the risks of premature decision anchoring with rapid reviews, given the evolving understanding about risks of evidence reversals with immature evidence.

The difference in perceived importance of the sleepers for administrators relative to clinicians is collected by survey and the results presented to the stakeholders via radial plots to outline the amount of discrepancy in perception of the relative importance by the stakeholder groups. This systematic and visual approach to addressing the sleepers allows for stakeholders and producers of HTA to come to an agreement up front about what issues underlie the decision at hand and the likely perceived weight of importance of that issue on the ultimate decision to be made. In addition, as the HTA progresses through evidence assessment and economic evaluation, the sleeper domains can be repeatedly discussed and placed into a more informed context in light of the evidence and economic issues. Sometimes the perceived weight of importance of the sleeper domains differs significantly from the point of first \"gut reaction\" to the more informed point of decision-making after the evidence and economic consider- ations have been brought to bear. Furthermore, defining and evaluating perceptions of the sleepers up front, before the evidence review and economic evaluations have been conducted, also allows the scope of the evidence and economic evaluation to consider formal incorporation of sleeper concepts, when relevant.",
