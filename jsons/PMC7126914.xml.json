One of the most important scientific achievements is the use of nanoscale supramolecular aggregates to increase the solubility and stability of lipophilic drugs and to improve their targeted delivery to the source of the disease (Kumari et al., 2010, Patel and Chaudhari, 2012). It should be noted that the number of scientific papers devoted to the development of drug delivery systems (DDS), as well as the amount of funding for these works exceeded that for developing and researching new drugs. One of the purposes of such studies is the search for new non-toxic complexants that are able to protect guest molecules, reduce hydrophobicity, control their reactivity and improve the bioavailability and therapeutic activity of the drug molecule. The purpose of the present review is to introduce a novel unusual DDS \u2013 glycyrrhizic acid.",

GA is an amphiphilic molecule: the hydrophilic part is represented by the glucuronic acid residues, and the hydrophobic part is the glycyrrhetic acid residue (Fig. 1\n). GA has very long history of use. It has been known since ancient times in ancient China, Egypt, Japan (Shibata, 2000). Licorice is widely used in traditional Chinese and Japanese medicine. For the past 50 years the biological and therapeutic activity of GA has been intensively investigated in Asia and Europe (Shibata, 2000, Ming and Yin, 2013, Su et al., 2017), and it was confirmed to be non-toxic (Ming and Yin, 2013).",

And just a few studies contain attempts to understand and explain the mechanism of GA action as DDS. Only in last decades in addition to its own therapeutic activity, a novel unusual property of the GA has been discovered. In particular, the ability of GA to form inclusion complexes with a variety of drugs was demonstrated (Baltina, 2003, Apanasenko et al., 2015, Polyakov et al., 2008, Tolstikova et al., 2009, Polyakov and Leshina, 2011, Polyakov et al., 2013). These complexes show significant advantages over other known DDS. In addition, it was demonstrated the ability of GA to interact with cell membrane and to change membrane properties (Selyutina et al., 2016a, Selyutina et al., 2016b, Selyutina et al., 2014, Selyutina et al., 2017, Selyutina et al., 2015). Cell membrane forms the boundary between extracellular environment and intracellular space, provides cell integrity and implements barrier functions. Thus, understanding influence of drug delivery systems on functional properties of the cells (permeability, elasticity, lipid mobility and cell viability) is of particular interest. In this review we tried to collect and systematize the available data about GA both as biologically active molecule (in vivo and in vitro) and as drug carrier, in the hope of stimulating further discussions about the mechanism of GA action and about perspectives of GA application as a multifunctional drug carrier.",

Also in this work it was established that the mechanism of GA action is not associated with direct inactivation of the virus. Presumably, the effect of GA occurs at the stage of virus penetration. It was shown that glycyrrhizic acid could inhibit the replication of coronavirus SARS in vitro (Hoever et al., 2005). Recent research of the antiviral activity of GA and its various derivatives were carried out on the Vero cell line obtained from the kidney epithelium taken from an African green monkey. It was found that at a concentration of 365 \u03bcM GA inhibits the cytopathic effect (destruction of cells) of the virus in 50% of infected cells. At the same time, the GA concentration at which the cell viability decreases by 50% is more than 24 mM.",

A similar results were obtained for 1000 \u03bcg/ml of licorice extract and ammonium salt of GA. The minimum concentration for which inhibition was observed proved to be non-toxic for the pig's kidney (PS) cell lines and human cervical cancer (HeLa). The ability of GA to inhibit the replication of a number of other viruses is also established: vaccinia virus, herpes simplex virus type 1, Newcastle disease virus, poliovirus type 1, and vesicular stomatitis virus (Pompei et al., 1979, Pompei et al., 1980). These studies were performed in vitro on the human aneuploid cell line Hep2. It has been found that the addition of 8 mM GA to infected cell cultures inhibits both the growth of vaccinia viruses of the first type, Newcastle disease, and vesicular stomatitis, and their cytopathic effect. At the same time, the protection of cell cultures from viral exposure proved to be so effective that there are practically no differences between infected cells treated with GA and non-infected cells upon microscopic observation. Post-treatment (3 h after infection) by 8 mM GA also leads to suppression of virus growth and stops the progression of the cytopathic effect. The effect is also observed at GA concentrations of 4 mM and 2 mM, but is absent at a concentration of 1 mM. Along with this, an irreversible activation of the first herpes simplex virus is observed after treatment of infected cells with 8 mM glycyrrhizic acid in just 15 min. It should be noted that this effect is not observed for other viruses investigated in this work, even when processed up to 3 h. There is also no effect of GA on the first type of poliovirus.",

            "text": "Despite the abundance of studies of GA activity against various unbound DNA and RNA viruses, the mechanism of its antiviral effect remains unclear. It was shown that the effect of GA on herpes virus associated with Kaposi's sarcoma is related to inhibition of the synthesis of viral RNAs (Kang and Lieberman, 2011). The GA effect on the replication of various viruses was found in a number of works (Kimoto et al., 2005, Sekizawa et al., 2001, Baba and Shigeta, 1987). However, the fact that the GA antiviral activity is detected in relation to various weakly interconnected DNA and RNA viruses suggests that the GA effect is associated not only with the effect on the synthesis of RNA. It was established in (Lin, 2003) that when the GA is added 6 h after infection of the cells, no antiviral action is observed. At the same time with the addition of GA immediately after infection and washing of the GA after 5 h, the antiviral effect remains irreversible. Based on this, it is concluded that the GA selectively blocks the penetration of the virus into the cell, since this is a process that takes place approximately the first 5 h after infection. In the case of the virus of the reproductive-respiratory syndrome of pigs, it was shown that the GA action is related mainly to the stage of virus penetration and has little effect on the stages of absorption and release of the virus (Duan et al., 2015). In addition, the authors excluded the direct inhibitory effect of GA on viral particles. It has also been shown in a number of studies that GA and its derivatives prevent the penetration of a number of viruses through the plasma membrane (Lin, 2003, Hoever et al., 2005, Harada, 2005, Crance et al., 1994, Sui et al., 2010). In addition, it was found that the effect of GA leads to a decrease in the fluidity of the cell membranes (Harada, 2005, Wolkerstorfer et al., 2009). It was also established in (Matsumoto et al., 2013) that GA can prevent the spread of the virus by inhibiting the release of viral particles from the infected cell. Summarizing the results of these studies we can conclude that the key feature of GA responsible for its antiviral activity might be its membrane modifying ability. This question will be discussed below.",

            "text": "For a long time, glycyrrhizin is known as a compound with anti-inflammatory activity. A lot of studies were devoted to this issue. They consider the anti-inflammatory activity of GA mainly in terms of inhibiting the main mediators of inflammation, such as TNF-\u03b1, interleukins IL-1\u03b2 and IL-6. It has been shown that glycyrrhizin inhibits its production in vitro. (Matsumoto et al., 2013) A number of studies associate the GA anti-inflammatory activity with its antioxidant activity. In particular, it has been shown that along with other components of licorice extract, glycyrrhizin inhibits the synthesis of NO and inflammatory cytokines in the model of lipopolysaccharide-stimulated microglial cells (Fu et al., 2014, Yu et al., 2015). Also GA, like a number of other terpenic acids, demonstrates antioxidant activity against H2O2 in the cells of human bronchial epithelium (Tsao and Yin, 2015). The protective mechanism of GA is caused by the fact that H2O2 reduces the expression of the regulator of apoptosis Bcl-2, while GA already reverses this effect at a concentration of 8 \u03bcM. Experiments show that GA does not decrease the viability of cells (Matsumoto et al., 2013, Tsao and Yin, 2015), while treatment with H2O2 decreases viability and increases DNA fragmentation in the tested cells (Tsao and Yin, 2015). Pre-treatment with glycyrrhizic acid in this case increases the viability of cells and reduces the fragmentation of DNA. In addition, glycyrrhizin reduces the production of caspase-3 and the oxidation and inflammation factors induced by H2O2 (Tsao and Yin, 2015, Akamatsu et al., 1991). It was demonstrated in (Tsao and Yin, 2015, Akamatsu et al., 1991) that GA significantly reduces the production of reactive oxygen species, in particular, O2\n\u2013, H2O2 and OH radicals, in vitro, by inhibiting neutrophil metabolism. In particular, this is also associated with the anti-inflammatory effect of GA. Another putative mechanism of GA anti-inflammatory activity is associated with inhibition of the synthesis of prostaglandin E2, which is one of the inflammation mediators (Ohuchi et al., 1981). In this study, macrophages were incubated for 20 h in a medium containing different GA concentrations. Significant inhibition of the synthesis of prostaglandin E2 by activated macrophages was observed at concentrations of 0.1 and 1 mg/ml. It was also established that GA in such concentrations is not toxic for macrophages.",

In particular, antiviral action could be associated with degradation of lipid rafts, by GA extracting cholesterol, which makes it difficult to translate the TLR4 receptor into lipid rafts and inhibit the lipopolysaccharide-induced inflammatory response in RAW264.7 cells. TLR4, a membrane protein, belongs to the group of toll-like receptors involved in congenital immunity, is the main receptor of lipopolysaccharides in RAW264.7 cells, and therefore directly regulates the cellular response to bacterial lipopolysaccharides that are a marker of the infection (Matsumoto et al., 2013).",

Hepatoprotective effect against a number of toxic compounds is largely determined by the antioxidant activity of glycyrrhizic acid. Thus, it was shown that glycyrrhizin significantly reduces necrosis and apoptosis of liver cells of rats exposed to titanium dioxide nanoparticles (Orazizadehet al., 2014). Also in this study it was established that GA decreases lipid peroxidation and demonstrates antioxidant activity. It is suggested that a decrease in oxidative stress significantly causes a decrease in apoptosis and necrosis of hepatocytes induced by titanium dioxide. Hepatoprotective and antioxidant properties of glycyrrhizin are also manifested in relation to CCl4 (Huo et al., 2011, Yin et al., 2011, Liang et al., 2015), and a number of other cytotoxic compounds (Wan et al., 2009, Yin et al., 2008, Li et al., 2014, Wang et al., 2012, Hsiang et al., 2015). Some studies suggest a hepatoprotective function of GA including activity against liver cancer at the level of gene expression (Yin et al., 2011, Liang et al., 2015). In particular, it has been shown that GA regulates the expression of genes responsible for apoptosis and oxidative stress in human hepatoma cells (Wang et al., 2012).",

In particular, Nakamura et al. induced the leakage of lactate dehydrogenase and glutamic oxaloacetic transaminase in a monolayer rat hepatocyte culture, treating these cells by CCl4. The leakage of this enzyme is caused by a change in the permeability of the membrane. The addition of glycyrrhizin caused a change in the release of the enzyme. A small changes were observed at glycyrrhizin concentration of 25 \u03bcg/ml, the maximum effect was observed at 200 \u03bcg/ml of glycyrrhizin.

This mechanism is also manifested when SiHa cells derived from cervical cancer material is treated with glycyrrhetic acid (Lee et al., 2008). This mechanism is of interest, since the formation of the mitochondrial pore is involved in various forms of cell damage, as well as apoptosis. The opening of mitochondrial pores causes the depolarization of the transmembrane potential, the release of Ca2+ and cytochrome C, and the loss of cancer cell viability (Mignotte and Vayssi\u00e8re, 1998).",

Low bioavailability is mainly determined by low solubility and low permeability or both. The solubility of drugs intended for oral administration is especially important. A possible way to solve this problem is the use of delivery systems in the form of complexes with highly soluble compounds. In many cases, this allows to significantly reduce the effective dose while preserving the therapeutic effect. The lipophilic drug molecule could pass through the lipid layer due to passive transport (against the concentration gradient), but for this it is necessary to achieve a sufficiently large concentration of the drug compound in the extracellular environment. However \u223c 30% of the released drug compounds are water insoluble. Taking into account that near 85% of the most popular drugs are taken orally, we could say that this trend the most promising.",

            "text": "Various physicochemical methods have been applied to get the evidence of complexes formation between GA self-associates and drug molecules in solid state as well as in aqueous and non-aqueous solutions. Such complexes were investigated by Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy, differential scanning calorimetry, X-ray diffraction and scanning electron microscopy techniques (Lekar et al., 2011a, Yang et al., 2015, Zu et al., 2013, Kong et al., 2017). The physicochemical properties and behavior of GA complexes in solution were characterized by NMR, mass spectroscopy, electrochemical and optical techniques (Baltina, 2003, Apanasenko et al., 2015, Konkina et al., 2015, Polyakov et al., 2005). In particular, changes of the mobility of a drug compound in the presence of GA were studied by 1H NMR spectroscopy to prove a formation of the inclusion complex (Apanasenko et al., 2015, Polyakov et al., 2008). The times of spin\u2013lattice and spin\u2013spin nuclear relaxation (T1 and T2, respectively) are very sensitive to changes in the mobility of molecules (Deese and Dartz, 1982, Bocian and Chan, 1978). Formation of inclusion complex results in decrease of the diffusion mobility of molecules and leads to decrease in the observed relaxation time of corresponding protons. The T2 is inversely proportional to the rotational correlation time and, as a result, depends on the rotational mobility of a molecule. Thus, T2 data could indicate is molecule in free of bound state. In the case of rapid exchange between the bound state and solution, the NMR signal decay in relaxation experiment is mono exponential, in the case of a slow exchange (in comparison with the relaxation time), the kinetics of the decay becomes bi-exponential:It=I1\u00d7exp-t/T21+I2\u00d7exp-t/T22\n",

At the same time, toxicity decreases by 1.7 times, and the amplitude of the therapeutic index increases by 17 times (Tolstikova et al., 2009). Similar action was detected for complexation of glycyrrhizin with other drugs, for example, nifedipine complexes with GA manifested antihypertensive therapeutic effect in a ten-fold reduced dose of nifedipine (Tolstikova et al., 2009, Polyakov and Leshina, 2011).

Some of them are photosensitive, susceptible to oxidation by free radicals formed in the body in vivo, etc. The complexation with glycyrrhizic acid in some cases can significantly improve the stability of the drug substance and protect it from undesirable effects. Thus the effect of various complexants including GA on the oxidative resistance of carotenoid molecules (lutein and zeaxanthin) was investigated (Apanasenko et al., 2015, Polyakov et al., 2013). Zeaxanthin and lutein have an important protective role in the eyes retina of humans and other mammals. The lack of these carotenoids can lead to eyes damage by the short-wavelength visible light and reactive oxygen species. It eventually leads to age-related macular degeneration and results in irreversible blindness. Zeaxanthin and lutein are not produced in the human body and should enter the body with food. But due to low solubility in water and instability of these molecules their practical use of its consumption is very limited. Preparation of supramolecular complexes of these carotenoids with GA, its disodium salt and natural polysaccharide arabinogalactan could minimize mentioned drawbacks and opens prospects for the use of such complexes in food industry and for the drug production. The complex formation of zeaxanthin and lutein was investigated by NMR relaxation, surface plasmon resonance, and optical absorption technique (Apanasenko et al., 2015, Polyakov et al., 2013). The authors have shown that complexes with polysaccharides and GA increase the solubility of carotenoids by more than 1000 times. Also, oxidation resistance of carotenoids in the reaction with ozone, peroxyl radicals and metal ions has been investigated. It was found that resistance to oxidation of lutein and zeaxanthin significantly increases in the complexes with glycyrrhizic acid and arabinogalactan (Fig. 5\n).",

As already discussed, glycyrrhizic acid is an amphiphilic molecule. The process of self-association of GA was studied by various methods. Thus, in (Kornievskaya et al., 2008) the formation of self-associates was proved by the NMR technique. It has been shown that micellization of glycyrrhizic acid occurs in water-methanol solutions with a low content of methanol (20%), whereas micelles do not form when the alcohol content is increased to 50%. The process of micellization and gelling of GA in a water-methanol mixture (20% methanol) was also studied by Petrova et al. (2016). It is shown that micelle formation occurs during hydrophobic interaction of the triterpene part of the glycyrrhizin. Studies of GA self-association by the molecular dynamics also demonstrated that the formation of aggregates occurs due to the hydrophobic interaction between terpenic residues (Zelikman et al., 2015). The study of GA micelles using small-angle scattering methods shows that GA forms rod-shaped micelles with a radius of 1.5 nm and a length of 21 nm, at a concentration of 5 mM in a solvent with pH = 5 (Matsuoka et al., 2015). Mass spectrometry study demonstrates that glycyrrhetic acid, an aglycone of glycyrrhizic acid, also forms self-associates (Lekar et al., 2016).",

So, such glycyrrhetic acid-curcumin hydrogel could be considered as a promising material for liver tumor chemotherapy (Chen et al., 2017). Fluorescence microscopic study of glycyrrhetic acid conjugated with coumarin-based fluoroprobe demonstrated that glycyrrhetic acid is selectively uptaken by liver cancer cells (HepG2 and Chang liver cancer cells). Also, a pro-drug epirubicin-glycyrrhetic acid (inactive form of epirubicin which can be activated by the rich esterase activity of the tumor cells microenvironment) demonstrated better selectivity to liver cancer cell, than free epirubicin (Singh et al., 2018).

            "text": "In addition to solubility enhancement of lipophilic drugs in the complexes with GA, a number of studies indicate the drug permeability enhancement in the presence of GA. It provides broad prospects of applying of glycyrrhizic acid as a multifunctional DDS. It was also established that GA enhance absorption effects of the variety of drugs (Kong et al., 2017, Sapra et al., 2008, Radwant and Aboul-Enein, 2002, Chen et al., 2009, Chakotiya et al., 2016). In view of the fact that the movement of small drug molecules through gastrointestinal epithelium is regulated by the distension and constriction of the tight junctions, observed effects could be connected with the ability of glycyrrhizin to enhance the penetration of molecules into the cells. During transport, the drug molecule must overcome many barriers in the form of monolayered and multilayered membranes. Despite the cellular structures are not all the same, influence factors and the through ways of drugs are similar in different cells. A number of results indicates that GA may enhance the drug penetration into the cells by influencing the cell membrane properties (Selyutina et al., 2016a, Selyutina et al., 2016b, Selyutina et al., 2014, Selyutina et al., 2017, Selyutina et al., 2015, Meteleva et al., 2019). In particular, it was shown that GA could enhance the permeability of erythrocytes and K562 cells for formate ions (Selyutina et al., 2016b, Selyutina et al., 2014, Selyutina et al., 2017). It is suggested that permeability enhancement could be due to GA membrane-modifying activity. To confirm this hypothesis the interaction of glycyrrhizin with palmitoyl-oleoyl-phosphatidylcholine (POPC) liposomes, dioleyl-phosphatidylcholine (DOPC) and dipalmitoyl-phosphatidylcholine (DPPC) bilayers were studied by NMR and molecular dynamic (MD) techniques. NMR study showed that joint action of 0.5 mM cholesterol and 0.5 mM glycyrrhizin leads to the penetration of Pr ions through bilayer (Selyutina et al., 2016a). Also, in the presence of glycyrrhizin 2-fold acceleration of the transport of formate ions through red blood cell membrane compared with the untreated samples was observed (Selyutina et al., 2016b). It may be connected with GA penetration into the lipid bilayer (Selyutina et al., 2016a). GA in water could easily connect to the bilayer surface and then penetrated into that. It is preferably located in the \u201couter\u201d half-layer and could freely exchange between the polar part of half-layer and its hydrophobic interior (Fig. 6\n). During the penetration it could carry a few water molecules inside the bilayer. It could explain observed acceleration of small molecules transport through the membrane (Selyutina et al., 2016a). Observed effects could be connected with GA self-association. For example, the maximum acceleration of the rate of formate-ions exchange through the erythrocyte membrane was noticed at a glycyrrhizin concentration near critical micelle-formation concentration (about 10\u22123 M) (Selyutina et al., 2016b).",

One of the explanations of different types of GA activity, whether antiviral, anti-inflammatory, hepatoprotective or anti-cancer, is the GA membrane-modifying activity (Fig. 8\n). We have demonstrated several examples which illustrate the changes of membrane permeability, fluidity, pores formation and changes of trans-membrane potential by GA. These results are confirmed by the various physicochemical studies of the GA-membrane interaction.",

Solubility enhancement can facilitate the passive transport of drug molecules through cell membrane in supramolecular complex with GA. Permeability enhancement also could be caused by the GA incorporation into the cell membrane and pore formation in the lipid membrane under the action of GA. As a result, in addition to enhancement of the solubility and stability of drugs, glycyrrhizin could also affect their pharmacokinetic properties. In combination with its own biological activity such feature makes GA a perspective multifunctional drug delivery system.",

Most of the papers are devoted to its use as a modifying agent for DDS, increasing its specificity for liver cells. But taking into account the variety of drugs which could be included in supramolecular complexes with glycyrrhizin and observed increase of cell membrane permeability in the presence of GA, and also the GA affinity to liver cells, we can conclude that GA could be used as effective and relatively cheap targeted drug delivery system. In addition, glycyrrhizic acid can be considered as universal nonselective carrier. At this moment a number of in vivo studies have been performed which prove the therapeutic potential of GA as multifunctional DDS for drugs with low solubility and low permeability. Animal studies demonstrate significant enhancement of bioavailability and therapeutic activity of these drugs in the compositions with GA.",
