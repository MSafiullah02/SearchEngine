RSV causes significant mortality in the developing world, resulting in an estimated 200,000 annual deaths in young children globally, in addition to major morbidity (33.8 million episodes worldwide annually) (Nair et al, 2010). Besides, RSV is a leading cause of morbidity and mortality in elderly and immunocompromised individuals (Kwon et al, 2017).",

TLR can trigger cytokine secretion, dendritic cell maturation, and antigen presentation, which in turn can enhance the adaptive immune response (Uematsu and Akira, 2006). Because of this ability to induce innate and adaptive responses, TLR agonists have been explored as antiviral therapeutic agents. TLR3, TLR4, TLR7, TLR8 and TLR9 agonists have been successfully applied to nonhuman primate models of dengue virus and hepatitis B virus (HBV) and in murine models for influenza and herpes simplex virus (HSV) (Boivin et al., 2008; Zhang et al., 2009; Boukhvalova et al, 2010; Sariol et al., 2011; Shinya et al, 2011; Tuvim et al, 2012; Lanford et al., 2013; Lucifora et al, 2018; To et al, 2019). Particularly in the mouse model of RSV, prophylactic treatment with a TLR3 agonist not only reduces viral replication in the lungs, but also results in an amelioration of the clinical illness and a reduction in lung inflammation (Guerrero-Plata et al, 2005).",

The animals were housed in an Animal Facility Biosafety Level 3 (ABSL-3) (UOCCB, ANLIS-Malbr\u00e1n, Buenos Aires, Argentina) in individually ventilated cages and fed with food and water ad libitum for at least 1 week before experimental use at 6\u20138 week of age. Mice received 50 \u03bcl RSV line 19 and A2 (5 \u00d7 106 PFU) or 25% (w/v) sucrose (as described above, viral stocks were suspended in 25% (w/v) sucrose) by intranasal (i.n.) delivery under light general anesthesia (isoflurane) (6 per group). A total of 5 mg/kg of imiquimod (dissolved in water) or a vehicle (water) for control group, was given 1 h p.i. intranasally (i.n.). Mice further received a daily dose of 5 mg/kg of imiquimod until day 4 p.i. Body weights were monitored daily, and groups of mice were culled on day 4 or 8 p.i. Lungs from day 4 were removed, weighed, and used for titration of infectious virus. Briefly, snap frozen lungs were homogenized on ice using glass Dounce homogenizers. Tissue debris was pelleted by centrifugation at 4\u00b0C for 10 min at 300g and supernatants were immediately serially diluted in FBS free medium and titrated by plaque assay in Vero cells. The right lungs from day 8 were used for gene expression studies, and in parallel, the left lung was submerged in Bouin solution for fixation for 24 hr and subsequent histological sectioning and staining. Lung sections were assessed for severity of inflammation by two independent observers, Dr. Mar\u00eda Virginia Gentilini and Dr. Carlos Bueno, blinded to treatment. An index of pathologic changes in hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) slides was obtained accordingly to Zappia et al. (2019). Briefly, 20 consecutive airways per slide were examined at 400\u00d7 magnification and scoring the inflammatory infiltrates around the airways and vessels for severity (0, normal; 1, \u22643 cells diameter thick; 2, 4 to 10 cells diameter thick; 3, \u226510 cells diameter thick). The Inflammatory Index was calculated by dividing the sum of the airway scores from each lung by the number of airways examined.",

As expected from previous studies (Tissari et al, 2005; Han et al, 2014), both HEp-2 and A549 cells did not express a functional TLR7 receptor, since these TLR7 agonists neither induced cytokine production nor triggered activation of the transcription factor NF-\u03baB following stimulation of HEp-2 and A549 cells (Supplementary Fig. 1). In contrast, poly (I:C)-HMW (TLR3 agonist) and Pam2CSK4 (TLR2/6 agonist) activated NF-\u03baB and induced cytokine expression in these cells (Supplementary Fig. 1). Moreover, imiquimod demonstrated identical significant antiviral activity against RSV in HEp-2, A549 cells and in the type I interferon deficient Vero cell line (Table 1 and Fig 2A). These results suggested that modulation of type I interferons and cytokines was not required for the protective effect of imiquimod. Thus, imiquimod transduced intracellular signals that elicit anti-RSV activity independently of an innate response. In this sense, Sch\u00f6n et al. (2006) reported that imiquimod acts not only as an agonist for TLR7 but also as an antagonist for adenosine receptors. Besides, Kan et al. (2012) demonstrated that imiquimod, but not resiquimod, inhibits HSV-1 replication via adenosine receptor A1/PKA pathway, independently of the TLR7 signaling pathway and IFN production. (Kan et al, 2012). Thus, we hypothesize that imiquimod might exert its anti-RSV activity through PKA pathway as well.",

            "text": "To test this suggestion, first we measured the effects of imiquimod in HEp-2 and A549 cells on CREB (cAMP response element-binding) phosphorylation, which is a known direct substrate of PKA (Naqvi et al, 2014). We found that imiquimod treatment increased the amount of p-CREB in total cell lysates, as early as 10 min (Fig. 4\nA). Interestingly, treatment with a selective PKA inhibitor (KT5720) significantly blocked imiquimod-induced phosphorylation of CREB (Fig. 4B), thereby providing additional evidence of PKA activation in imiquimod-treated epithelial cells. However, an adenosine receptor A1 agonist (R-PIA) did not affect imiquimod-induced CREB phoshorylation (Fig. 4B), suggesting that imiquimod might not be triggering CREB phoshorylation through adenosine receptor A1 in HEp-2 and A549 cells. Since KT5720 decreased the imiquimod-induced CREB phosphorylation, we sought to investigate whether KT5720 was able to attenuate the antiviral effect of imiquimod. In concordance with these results, imiquimod failed to inhibit RSV replication in HEp-2 and A549 cells treated with KT5720, whereas imiquimod conserved its antiviral activity in cells treated with R-PIA (Fig. 4C). Given the fact that imiquimod affected the ability of RSV particles to drive the biosynthesis of viral macromolecules, such as gF (Fig.3B), we investigated whether KT5720 was able to reduce the inhibition of gF expression by imiquimod, as well. Interestingly, imiquimod did not decrease gF expression in HEp-2 cells treated with KT5720 (Supplementary Fig. 2). Moreover, taking into account that PKA is one of the major families of eukaryotic cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) receptors, and, therefore, it is activated by cAMP, we hypothesized that elevated intracellular cAMP might decrease RSV titers and gF expression. To test this possibility, HEp-2 cells were infected with RSV in the presence or absence of forskolin, a potent inductor of cAMP production, or the cAMP analog dibutyryl cAMP (dbcAMP), and viral titers and expression of gF were analyzed. We found that both viral titers and expression of gF significantly decreased in HEp-2 cells treated with either forskolin or dbcAMP (Supplementary Fig. 2). Thus, these results suggested that an increase in cAMP levels, wich in turn activates PKA, inhibited gF expression and attenuated viral replication in epithelial cells.",

Interestingly, although Pam2CSK4 and poly(I:C)-HMW activate the innate response in A549 and HEp-2 cells, we do not observe anti-RSV activity of these TLR ligands. In this sense, there is compelling evidence that RSV is able to interfere with TLR signaling pathways. For instance, it has been reported that RSV interferes with TLR7 and TLR9 signaling pathways in human plasmacytoid dendritic cells, and with TLR3 and TLR9 in mice (Guerrero-Plata et al, 2005; Schlender et al, 2005).

This conclusion is based on biochemical evidence of PKA activation (phosphorylation of CREB) in imiquimod-treated epithelial cells. Additionally, PKA inhibition by KT5720 blocks imiquimod-induced phosphorylation of CREB, and importantly, imiquimod antiviral effects and imiquimod inhibition of gF expression, as well. Considering that R-PIA, a selective A1 adenosine agonist, does not affect imiquimod-induced phosphorylation of CREB and imiquimod antiviral activity under our treatment conditions, we cannot exclude the possibility that imiquimod may act as an inverse agonist of another G-protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) coupled to G\u03b1i, or as an agonist of a GPCR coupled to G\u03b1s, present in these cells.",

The development of inhibitors specific to cAMP, PKA and EPAC has enabled researchers to study the importance of this signaling under various cellular conditions, including viral infection (Rezaee et al, 2017; Choi et al, 2018). In this sense, as well as the reported anti-HSV-1 activity of imiquimod as a consequence of its activation of cAMP/PKA (Kan et al, 2012), there are other recent studies on the potential effect of cAMP/PKA and cAMP/EPAC activators or inhibitors on viral replication. For instance, activation of either cAMP/PKA or EPAC/Rap1-dependent signaling has been shown to inhibit HIV-1 replication and cell-to-cell HIV-1 transfer (Hayes et al, 2002; Clemente et al, 2014). On the other hand, selective inhibition of EPAC significantly reduced susceptibility to Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) infections (Tao et al, 2014). Particularly in case of RSV infections, inhibition of cellular EPAC2 protein significantly prevents RSV replication and RSV-induced inflammatory responses in vitro (Choi et al, 2018). Moreover, Rezaee et al (2017) found that the activation of the cAMP/PKA signaling pathway by forskolin and a stable cell-permeable analog of cAMP attenuate RSV-induced disruption of structure and functions of the airway epithelial barrier and, besides, inhibit expression of RSV A2 F mRNA in vitro. Similarly, we have observed that forskolin and an analog of cAMP reduce the amounts of infectious viral particles and affect gF expression in epithelial cells (Supplementary Fig. 2). Taken together, our present study and the described publications highlight cAMP/PKA and cAMP/EPAC pathways as potent modulators of viral infections in vitro, suggesting they could be a promising therapeutic target for viral infections in vivo.\n",

This is particularly important, as some studies have shown that virus-induced pathogenesis and disease severity are positively correlated with viral load (Buckingham, et al, 2000; DeVincenzo et al, 2010; Houben et al, 2010; Torres et al, 2010; De Clercq, 2015; Skjerven et al, 2016). In this sense, imiquimod not only exerts a reduction of the viral titers in the lung, but also a decrease in weight loss and airway inflammation. Interestingly, we also found that imiquimod is able to reduce pro-inflammatory cytokines production in human epithelial cells infected with RSV. Importantly, RSV productively multiplies in these cell lines. However, RSV does not multiply in J774A.1 cells in our experimental settings, and strikingly, imiquimod did not reduce cytokine production in this cell line. Thus, considering these findings, and that the induction of many proinflammatory mediators is virus replication dependent in epithelial cells, we speculate that imiquimod might not directly modulate cytokine production in infected cells, and it probably affects cytokine/chemokine induction in epithelial cells solely as a consequence of its control of viral replication in vitro. Likewise, we hypothesize that the beneficial effect of imiquimod on airway and lung inflammation could be mainly an indirect consequence of imiquimod-suppressed RSV replication. Similarly, it is proposed that imiquimod is able to reduce pulmonary inflammation and weight loss following influenza A virus infection because of its capacity to clear virus during the acute infection phase of infection (To et al, 2019). However, it was previously reported that the immune response to RSV infection in TLR7\u2212/\u2212 mice is more pathogenic compared to wild-type mice, associated with an alteration in T cell and dendritic cell responses (Lukacs et al, 2010). Thus, considering the central role of the TLR7 signaling in the immune response against RSV infection, we cannot exclude the possibility that imiquimod may attenuate the airway inflammation through direct modulation of the immune response via TLR7 signaling as well.",

Thus, these findings together with and our results support imiquimod as a strong candidate for the treatment of respiratory viral infections.
