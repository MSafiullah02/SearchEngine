            "text": "Leukemia is considered one of the most life-threatening cancers today. In 2001, approximately 21 500 deaths (12 100 males; 9500 females) in the United States were attributed to leukemia. Acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL) is a common type of leukemia. At present, chemotherapeutic agents are extremely useful in treating leukemia [1], [2], [3]. Finding novel anti-tumor chemotherapeutic medicine derived from natural materials has become an important research objective and has been the aim of new drug designs [4]. Many natural compounds have already been found to exhibit significant anti-tumor effects. Tea polyphenols can induce HL-60 cells apoptosis [5]. G2-M arrest and antimitotic activity can mediate by casticin [6]. Albatrellus confluens has the ability to inhibit the growth of tumor cells by the induction of apoptosis [7]. Extracts from Narcissus tazetta var. chinensis strongly decreased the survival rate of many tumor cell lines [8]. Lycorine, a natural alkaloid extracted from Amaryllidaceae, has shown various pharmacological and microbiological effects. Researchers had revealed that lycorine can inhibit protein synthesis in eukaryotic cells [9], and acetylcholinesterase activity [10]. In the presence of calprotectin, lycorine was shown to inhibit protein synthesis and cell apoptosis in MM46 cells [11]. Lycorine was found a potent antiviral activity against Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome-associated coronavirus (SARS-CoV) in recent report [12]. Lycorine could effectively arrest the cell cycle at the G2/M phase and induce apoptosis in HL-60 cells [13]. After treatment of human multiple meyloma cell line KM3 with lycorine, typical apoptotic events could be observed, and the results also showed that lycorine was able to block the KM3 cell cycle at G0/G1 phase through the down-regulation of both cyclin D1 and CDK4 [14]. In our previous study, we focused on the significant anti-tumor effects of lycorine. However, the anti-tumor effect of lycorine in vivo remains unknown. Therefore, it is important to determine the therapeutic effect of lycorine on leukemia in an animal model. SCID mice are widely used in cancer research especially in anti-leukemia research and can provide a system model to study the biology of human leukemias and explore the efficacy of novel leukemia therapy programs [15]. Previously, a leukemia model of SCID mice was successfully set up, where human leukemia cells could be detected in the bone marrow, spleen, and lymph nodes of SCID mice in a pattern resembling that of human acute leukemia [16], [17]. In this study, the effect of lycorine on APL in vivo was evaluated in a human leukemia xenograft model (i.e., SCID mice inoculated with HL-60 cells), although such a model would not completely reflect the situation in patients with leukemia.",

SCID mice transplanted with human APL cells displayed a high degree of engraftment and proliferation of human tumor cells among the peripheral blood cells [19]. The percentages of immature granular leukocytes and of monocytes among the peripheral blood cells of mice treated with lycorine were decreased compared with those of the control group (P\n < 0.05), which showed that lycorine not only inhibits the proliferation but also induces the death of tumor cells effectively [13], [14]. When compared with the control group, the ILS values of the groups receiving a low dosage (5 mg/kg/day) and a high dosage (10 mg/kg/day) of lycorine were 30.0% and 34%, respectively, indicating that lycorine had anti-tumor activity [21]. The mean survival time of both lycorine-treated groups was longer than that of the Ara-C treated group, which suggested that lycorine was more effective than Ara-C. The SCID mice that were inoculated with HL-60 cells in the control group developed an infiltration of tumor cells in the liver and in the bone marrow, and peripheral blasts [17], whereas lycorine could alleviate the infiltration of tumor cells and no severe adverse effects were observed with the low or high dosage of lycorine.",
