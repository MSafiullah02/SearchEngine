In particular, the pattern recognition receptors (PRRs) in cells of the innate immune system act as sensors for bacterial and viral nucleic acids (pathogen-associated molecular patterns; PAMPs) and induce the innate immune response by activation of a signaling cascade resulting in the upregulation of inflammatory cytokines, chemokines, and type I IFNs. This will eventually end up in triggering a robust adaptive immune response [6]. Therefore, PRRs represent the ideal target for vaccine adjuvants to initiate and boost an antigen-specific T cell response (reviewed in [7]).",

Synthetic CpG oligodeoxynucleotides (ODNs) are TLR-9 agonists able to induce type I IFNs as well as proinflammatory cytokine production, generating Th1 type cellular and humoral immune responses [12, 13]. Recently, the CpG-ODN was approved for the first time for application in humans, and Heplisav-B, a hepatitis B vaccine containing CpG-ODN as an adjuvant, was approved by the United States Food and Drug Administration [14]. Imiquimod, is a synthetic TLR7/8 agonist, reported to induce an adjuvant activity able to boost antigen-specific humoral and Th1 type cellular immune responses [15, 16]. However, systemic toxicity has been reported and the only TLR7 agonist-based drug approved for clinical use as an anti-tumor agent is the topically applied Aldara cream for patients with precancerous skin lesions [17]. Nevertheless, the field is still open for new adjuvants and in particular for molecules able to elicit a balanced humoral and cellular immune response for potential application in both preventive and therapeutic vaccines.",

Indeed, the cytostastic effect is not specific to cancer cells and may affect all replicating cells, including immune cells, possibly resulting in the impairment of effector T cells and activation of immunosuppressive mechanisms [20]. However, the lymphodepletion caused by chemotherapy can turn into a reset of the immune system as consequence of the rebound replenishment of immune cells [21], with the emergence of competent effector cells also with anticancer activity [22]. Indeed, cancer patients have been shown to respond to influenza virus vaccination during chemotherapy [23, 24] and specific anti-infective vaccination guidelines for patients with hematological malignancies have been designed [25].",

Results in OMA patients showed that none of the adjuvants used in this study was able to induce a statistical significant increased expression in pDCs of the maturation markers compared to the negative control. The only exception was the IMQ that induced an upregulation of HLA-DR molecules in pDCs after the chemotherapy (Fig. 2; Additional file 1: Figure S1). Patients showed a great variable responsiveness to adjuvants and an example of low and high responders is shown in Fig. 2. Similar results were observed in pDCs derived from OT patients. In this setting, the RNAdjuvant\u00ae was the only ex vivo treatment to induce a trend of increased expression of CD80 and HLA-DR compared to the negative control, in pre and post-treatment samples respectively (Fig. 3; Additional file 1: Figure S2).

Concerning the effector T cells (TE), OMA patients pre and post-chemotherapy showed at baseline a significantly higher percentage of cells compare to healthy subjects. The same pattern was observed in OT patients only pre-chemotherapy, while those post-chemotherapy did not differ from the healthy subject. Treatment with adjuvants did not induce any difference compared to negative control. Central memory T cells (TCM) were slightly increased in OT patients pre and post-chemotherapy compared to healthy subjects without reaching a statistical significance; moreover, treatment with adjuvants did not induce any difference compared to negative control in samples from cancer patients. Effector memory T cells (TEM) were significantly increased in OMA patients pre and post-chemotherapy compared to healthy subjects; also in this case, treatment with adjuvants did not induce any difference compared to negative control in samples from cancer patients. Overall, pre and post-chemotherapy samples did not show any significant difference (Fig. 11).",

Only the RNAdjuvant\u00ae induced a statistically significant increased expression of CD80 and HLA-DR in OT patients compared to the negative control, in pre and post-treatment samples respectively. The effects of adjuvants on mDCs in pre-chemotherapy samples from OMA patients showed that RNAdjuvant\u00ae and CpG were able to induce a statistical significant activation of the CD80 and CD86 maturation markers compared to negative samples, respectively. On the contrary, effects on samples from OT patients were not statistically significant. The RNAdjuvant\u00ae induced the strongest activation of CD80 expression in monocytes from cancer patients, pre and post-chemotherapy, compared to negative control and other adjuvants. Poly I:C was the only adjuvant to induce an increased expression of CD86 compared to negative control in monocytes from OMA patients pre-chemotherapy. Overall, the results on activation markers showed that cancer patients are still responsive to adjuvants, each of them used in the present study at the individual optimal concentration. A degree of potency was observed, but the RNAdjuvant\u00ae scored as the most effective adjuvant. Interestingly, cell subtypes analyzed in the study have been shown to have different expression levels for the individual Toll Like Receptors and should be responsive only to the specific ligands. Indeed, mDCs have high expression of TLR3 as well as relative expression of TLRs7 and 8, but no expression of TLR9, and should respond to all adjuvants tested in the study with exception of CpG [42]. On the contrary, pDCs have high expression only of TLR7 and 9 and should respond to all adjuvants tested with exception of Poly I:C [42]. Monocytes, have low expression of TLRs7, 8 and 9 and should moderately respond to all adjuvants tested with exception of Poly I:C. However, if pDCs are present in cell culture, monocytes have been shown to respond also to the TLR9 agonist CpG [43]. According to the latter evidence, it could be predicted that in a context of mixed population (such as PBMCs) the individual subtypes may respond to TLR agonists even when the target TLRs show low expression. Data obtained after chemotherapy protocols including cisplatin or analogues suggested a positive effect on immune cell differentiation and antigen presentation, as observed in the baseline expression of the markers, although the responsiveness to adjuvants appeared to be reduced. The biological mechanisms of such apparent discrepancy need to be further evaluated by increasing the number of samples analyzed.",

The results showed that, at baseline, pre and post-chemotherapy cancer patients have a significantly lower percentage of na\u00efve T cells (TN) compared to healthy subjects. This would suggest that the pathological condition, regardless the chemotherapy, may have an impact on the fraction of T cells available to respond to new antigens. Such a reduction was further induced by treatment with RNAdjuvant\u00ae, while no effect was observed upon treatment with the other adjuvants. Interestingly, colon and lung cancer patients showed a different pattern for the other phenotypes. Indeed, at baseline, while OMA samples showed a significantly higher percentage of TE and TEM compared to healthy subjects, OT patients showed a higher percentage of TCM compared to healthy subjects. For all the latter phenotypes, treatment with adjuvants did not induce a significant change in the percentage compared to the negative control. Overall, no statistical deviation from data in healthy subjects was observed in cancer patients and no difference was observed between samples from cancer patients pre and post-chemotherapy. This is of high relevance, indicating that the pool of effector and memory CD4+ T cells is fully preserved in cancer patients. In particular, effector memory (TEM) and central memory (TCM) cells are capable of circulating in lymphoid (TCM) as well as non-lymphoid compartments (TEM) [44, 45]. Therefore, upon contact with the appropriate antigen, effector memory cells can execute effector functions instantly, whereas central or lymphoid memory cells can rapidly proliferate, expanding and acquiring effector functions.",

Such results suggest that RNAdjuvant\u00ae represents the most potent Th1 inducer to be combined in a therapeutic cancer vaccine formulation. The same adjuvant is also the most potent inducer of pro-inflammatory cytokines as well as of \u03b1 and \u03b2 chemokines, suggesting a great capability of initiating the innate immune response coupled to the ability of recruiting immune cells, especially T cells, for potentiating the effector arm of anti-cancer immunity. Interestingly, the biological meaning of the down-expression of CXCL16 and CCL24 induced by all adjuvants needs to be further investigated in a larger experimental setting. In most cases, although at lower level compared to healthy subjects, cytokine level in cancer patients was significantly high and no statistical difference was observed between pre and post-chemotherapy samples.
