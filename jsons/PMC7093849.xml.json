The search was limited to English language. These searches identified 2359, 1393, and 2339 citations, respectively. The titles of all articles were reviewed by 1 of 2 authors (J.E.E.; D.J.J.), and the relevant articles were reviewed in more detail (ie, abstract and/or full manuscript). To ensure that articles that focus specifically on pregnancy issues were not overlooked, combinations of the following key words were also searched with PubMed: SARS and pregnancy; West Nile virus and pregnancy; and anthrax and pregnancy. For these searches, non-English articles were included, if the abstract was in English. These searches resulted in 25, 15, and 32 articles for SARS, West Nile virus, and anthrax, respectively. The full manuscripts for all of these articles were read and reviewed. Morbidity and Morality Weekly Reports were searched by title on the CDC website (www.cdc.gov/MMWR) with the same 3 keywords (SARS, West Nile virus, and anthrax), which resulted in 10, 107, and 22 MMWR publications, respectively. The summaries from these manuscripts were reviewed, and relevant articles were read and reviewed in full. CDC experts for each of the 3 outbreaks of interest reviewed the manuscript and the references that were cited to identify any potential omissions.",

Therefore, a multifaceted approach to disease control was required, and a wide variety of infection control measures were instituted rapidly.23, 24, 25 In the healthcare setting, infection-control practices were enhanced and included provision of personal protective equipment and training of healthcare workers in respiratory and hand hygiene. Specifically, healthcare workers should wear gloves, gown, mask, and eye protection. These recommendations combine elements of contact, droplet, and airborne infection\u2013control precautions. Additionally, patients with SARS were grouped together and isolated in the hospital. Ideally, SARS patients should be placed in private rooms, which maintain the negative pressure, and the number of healthcare workers who care for the patient and the number of visitors should be limited.26 In some places, specifically designated clinics and hospitals were set up to care only for patients with SARS.23, 24, 27, 28 It is important for healthcare workers to be aware that viremia with SARS coronavirus peaks later in the illness course than other similar-appearing respiratory infections, such as influenza.9 This means that the transmission of SARS may be more likely 8 to 10 days after illness onset at the point at which a SARS-infected patient requires hospital admission and in some cases intubation.",

A nonproductive cough is also common, and shortness of breath generally develops later. The presence of rhinorrhea makes the diagnosis of SARS less likely. Other findings that are characteristic of SARS include lymphopenia and elevated lactate dehydrogenase levels and pulmonary infiltrates on chest imaging. A patient's condition may deteriorate rapidly, exhibiting oxygen desaturation and adult respiratory distress syndrome, and require ventilatory support. In patients with suspected SARS, a workup for known causes of community-acquired pneumonia should be performed, and specimens should be collected for SARS testing. Serum samples from patients with SARS often show appropriate acute- and convalescent-phase immunoglobulin G antibodies with a SARS-specific enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Standard regimens for community-acquired pneumonia should be instituted, and supplemental oxygen should be used as needed. The patient's condition may deteriorate rapidly because of progressive respiratory failure and may require admission to an intensive care unit and mechanical ventilation. Although the antiviral drug ribavirin has been used extensively to treat SARS outside the United States, there are no data that demonstrate its efficacy.34, 35 Because ribavirin is known to be teratogenic and embryocidal in animal studies,36 ribavirin is not recommended for treatment of SARS in pregnant women.",

            "text": "Although there were reports of pregnant women with SARS from several countries, the number of reported cases is too small to permit any definitive conclusions as to whether SARS was more or less severe among pregnant women as compared with nonpregnant women. Among the cases of SARS that have been reported among pregnant women, there were no reports of perinatal transmission of SARS.37, 38, 39, 40, 41, 42 The largest case series of pregnant women with SARS was from Hong Kong; 12 pregnant patients, including 5 pregnant healthcare workers, with SARS were admitted to 5 public hospitals in Hong Kong.41 Three of the 12 pregnant patients with SARS died, for a case fatality rate of 25%. Seven of the 12 pregnant women with SARS were infected in the first trimester, and 5 of the women were infected in the second or third trimester. Among the 7 women who were infected in the first trimester, 4 women had spontaneous abortions, and 2 women had induced abortions. Of the 5 women who were infected later in pregnancy, 3 women underwent preterm cesarean delivery (26-32 weeks of gestation) for worsening maternal hypoxemia; 2 of the 3 women who underwent cesarean delivery subsequently died. Although the number of evaluated patients was small, pregnant women with SARS were more likely to require admission to the intensive care unit, to experience renal failure and disseminated intravascular coagulopathy, and to die than nonpregnant control subjects.38 Follow-up information was reported for the 5 liveborn infants who were born to pregnant women who were infected with SARS during the second or third trimesters. There was no clinical or laboratory evidence of SARS among the infants, despite a systematic search for perinatal transmission that included serial reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction assays, viral cultures, and paired serologic titers.15 There were also cases of pregnant women with SARS from mainland China42, 43 and 2 cases from the United States.37, 39, 40 Notably, 2 of the 8 persons with laboratory-confirmed SARS in the United States were pregnant women.40 A 36-year-old pregnant woman at 19 weeks of gestation had traveled from the United States to Hong Kong and then to Guangdong Province to visit family members. She stayed on the same floor of \u201cHotel M\u201d during the same time as the 65-year-old ill physician who is credited with infecting the other guests. On return to the United States, she was hospitalized for pneumonia and required mechanical ventilation. Serum specimens were positive for the SARS coronavirus antibody. She was delivered at 38 weeks of gestation by cesarean delivery for placenta previa. The infant appeared uninfected by SARS, although specimens were not obtained for testing.37, 39 The second case involved a 38-year-old woman at 7 weeks of gestation who also traveled to Hong Kong during the SARS epidemic. After recovering from her illness, she had a relatively unremarkable pregnancy. At 36 weeks of gestation, she had preterm labor and spontaneous rupture of membranes and underwent an emergency cesarean delivery because of fetal distress. The infant appeared normal, and no virus was detected in stool samples.40\n",

Although the United States was spared relatively during this outbreak, the global response to this outbreak may provide important clues about how to respond to future health threats. During an outbreak of a disease like SARS in which nosocomial spread plays an important role, the implications for a busy obstetric unit that provides urgent medical care on a 24-hour basis to primarily healthy pregnant women and their newborn infants are enormous. Staff from several large obstetric units in Toronto44, 45 and Hong Kong46, 47, 48 provided detailed reports about the challenges that they faced responding to SARS, an emerging infectious disease about which very little was known. In a Toronto hospital, the timing was ideal because the obstetrics unit was able to move into a newly designed facility with separate entrances, elevators, and air handling systems. Staff were instructed to use appropriate personal protective equipment (masks, face-shield or eye protection, gown, non-latex gloves), and all patients and visitors wore masks. In addition, visitors were limited to 1 visitor during labor and delivery, and no visitors were allowed after the delivery. The length of the postpartum stay was decreased, and after discharge women were instructed to stay at home under quarantine for 10 days. All physicians and healthcare workers were asked to observe work quarantine and were allowed to go directly to work and home with minimal contact with the public.44, 45 In Hong Kong, obstetric services were transferred to a hospital that was separate from where SARS cases were being treated. Women were discharged sooner after delivery, and all nonessential obstetric services (such as routine ultrasound examinations and prenatal diagnosis) were suspended temporarily.46, 47, 48 The basic principles of the responses in Toronto and Hong Kong included keeping healthy pregnant women away from potentially infectious SARS cases.",

Because of concerns about the unusual nature and pattern of the illness, the physician contacted the local health department. The health department followed up and found 6 additional cases of similar illness in the area, and further investigation revealed several interesting epidemiologic clues: The patients lived within a 16 square mile area of each other; all of the patients participated in outdoor activities such as gardening in the evenings, and Culex mosquito breeding sites and larvae were found in the patients' yards and neighborhoods. Further surveillance of local hospitals revealed a total of 59 patients who had been hospitalized with a similar illness. Subsequently, West Nile virus was isolated both in birds in this area and in the ill patients.49 The rapid identification and control of this outbreak, which represents the first recognized outbreak of West Nile virus in the Western hemisphere, is a tribute to the astute observations of a front-line clinician combined with the rapid response of the public health system. As described in the editorial accompanying the case series of the 59 patients who were hospitalized with West Nile virus in New York City, \u201cThe discovery that a cluster of cases of encephalitis in the New York City area in the summer of 1999 was caused by the West Nile virus, was a masterstroke of medical detection, combining features of a Berton Roueche story, a Michael Crichton novel, and Alfred Hitchcock's The Birds.\u201d50\n",

The virus was identified originally in the West Nile region of Uganda in 1937.51 A variety of bird species serve as the natural reservoir for the virus, and the virus is transmitted to humans by mosquitoes that bite both birds and humans.52 Since the first reports in 1999, West Nile virus has now spread to at least 41 states and has accounted for >15,000 reported cases.52, 53, 54 Most individuals who are infected with the virus are either asymptomatic or experience a mild illness, typically with symptoms of headache, fever, and rash. A small proportion (approximately 1%) of infected individuals will have severe disease that includes encephalitis, meningitis, or acute flaccid paralysis.52 Laboratory diagnosis is based on serologic evidence; immunoglobulin M (IgM) antibody to West Nile virus can be detected in the blood or cerebrospinal fluid. Because IgM does not readily cross the blood-brain barrier, detection in the cerebrospinal fluid is diagnostic of West Nile virus meningoencephalitis. However, there is some cross-reactivity with other flaviviruses, such as St. Louis encephalitis virus. Despite a variety of antiviral and other agents that have been used empirically, there is currently no known effective treatment for infection with West Nile virus. Therefore, treatment is generally supportive.51, 52\n",

For example, a woman with a history of chronic hypertension and sickle cell trait was diagnosed at 16 weeks of gestation with West Nile virus meningoencepalitis. Her pregnancy was further complicated by superimposed preeclampsia, and delivery was induced at 32 weeks of gestation for fetal growth restriction. At birth, the infant appeared normal and did well clinically, although no serologic testing of the infant for West Nile virus was performed.59 In this case, the mother may have been at greater risk for complications from infection with West Nile virus because of her underlying medical conditions. For example, hypertension may facilitate the passage of the neurotropic West Nile virus across the blood-brain barrier and result in increased rates of menigoenchephalitis.49 It is also likely that the hypertension contributed to the fetal growth restriction, although it is possible that fetal infection with West Nile virus also may have contributed to the impairment of fetal growth.",

At least 5 letters with Bacillus anthracis spores were sent to Florida, New York City, and Washington DC69, 70, 71 that resulted in the contamination of postal facilities, US Senate offices, and other locations and resulted in 22 confirmed or probable cases of anthrax and 5 deaths.72, 73 As a result of the anthrax attacks, >30,000 people received antibiotics for possible exposure to anthrax spores.74 The CDC recommends either ciprofloxacin or doxycycline orally for 60 days for postexposure prophylaxis to B anthracis spores.75\n",

Both the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists83 and the CDC82 recommend that asymptomatic pregnant and lactating women with exposure to B anthracis receive 60 days of antibiotic prophylaxis, as recommended for nonpregnant adults. The antimicrobial of choice is ciprofloxacin, a fluoroquinolone. Although fluoroquinolones are not used generally during pregnancy and lactation because of a possible association with arthropathy in animal studies,84 therapeutic doses of ciprofloxacin are unlikely to pose a substantial teratogenic risk.85, 86 In instances in which the specific B anthracis strain has been shown to be penicillin-susceptible, initiating or changing to prophylaxis with amoxicillin can be considered. Doxycycline should be used with caution in pregnant women because it may cause fetal toxic effects such as defective dental enamel and depressed bone growth. In addition, the use of doxycycline in pregnant women infrequently has been associated with hepatic necrosis.85 However, the risks of anthrax must be balanced against the risks of doxycycline; in some cases, the use of doxycycline in pregnant women may be appropriate.72, 83, 87\n",

Currently, only those military personnel who are assigned to high-threat areas routinely receive the vaccine.88 In addition, the vaccine can be used as an adjuvant to postexposure regimens.72 In terms of safety of vaccine for women of reproductive age, a recent report analyzed pregnancy rates and adverse birth outcomes among women at 2 military bases in Georgia.88 Among 4092 women, at least 3136 women received at least 1 dose of anthrax vaccine. There was no significant difference in pregnancy rates or adverse birth outcomes between vaccinated and unvaccinated women. However, with only 513 pregnancies, there was inadequate power to detect differences in adverse birth outcomes. In addition, the Department of Defense used computerized medical records to conduct a preliminary evaluation of the use of anthrax vaccine in the first trimester of pregnancy. Because of limitations in the medical record system, it was determined that a more systematic evaluation with the use of original medical records would be required before conclusions could be drawn. In the meantime, the Department of Defense policy continues to exclude pregnant women from anthrax vaccination programs.89\n",

SARS and West Nile virus highlight the importance of international travel and commerce in the spread of disease. The identification of West Nile virus highlights the importance of astute clinicians recognizing and responding to unusual disease patterns. All 3 outbreaks highlight the importance of obstetrician-gynecologists and other clinicians keeping up-to-date with new information as it emerges. It is interesting to note that some of the same strategies that were identified by the work of Dr Semmelweis and others, such as hand hygiene, are as effective today for the prevention of the transmission of emerging infections like SARS as they were for the prevention of puerperal sepsis in the 19th century.",

It may be that a patient does not respond to therapy as expected or that additional information that was missed initially begins to emerge (eg, recent travel, sick contacts, unusual pets, hobbies, activities). Unusual patterns of disease, such as atypical patterns of person, place, and time, may be clues to clinicians that a novel disease or intentional act of bioterrorism may be involved. For example, influenza-like illness in the summer (unusual timing of disease) or an outbreak of chickenpox among adults (unusual persons involved) may be clues that point to alternate diagnoses or explanations.90\n",
