In the United States, it is estimated that there will be 13,800 new cases and 4290 deaths from cervical cancer in 2020 [2]. Treatment of women with cervical cancer is largely dependent on the stage of cancer [3]. Hysterectomy-based approach is the surgical treatment of choice for women with early-stage cervical cancer [3]. In the United States, the vast majority of women with early-stage cervical cancer receive hysterectomy (Supplemental Fig. S1). For instance, 82.7% of women with stage T1b(\u22644 cm) disease underwent hysterectomy-based surgical treatment from 2010 to 2016 in the United States.",

Mounting evidence shows that cancer patients are at higher risk for severe illness from Covid-19. For this reason, extra care and caution will be needed when proceeding with surgical treatment for patients with malignancy [9]. An expert panel suggested postponing hysterectomy for 6 to 8 weeks as a possible option for early-stage cervical cancer in a Covid-19 hotspot area [10]. This suggestion is particularly applicable for patients with stage IA2-IIA1 cervical cancer because radical hysterectomy for these cancer stages is likely via laparotomy requiring inpatient hospitalization [11]. At centers heavily affected by this pandemic, inpatient resources may be limited and patients may be at risk of Covid-19 acquisition during hospitalization.",

Of note, this median wait-time for hysterectomy is similar to the 6\u20138 week time-frame suggested by the expert panel for postponing surgery during the Covid-19 pandemic [10].

Additional sensitivity analysis and systematic literature review with meta-analysis enhanced the robustness of study findings. A limitation of the study includes that this is a retrospective study that may have an unmeasured bias. For example, the exact reason for delay from diagnosis to surgery is not retrievable from the archived records. Performance status, medical condition, and socio-economic reasons may have affected the wait-time as well as the survival outcome, and missing these factors limit the interpretation of the study. It is also possible that longer follow-up would elucidate differences in OS, as a prior study found differences in outcomes only after 5 years of follow-up [16]. Most importantly, the sample size of our study is somehow limited raising the potential for type II error as described earlier.",
