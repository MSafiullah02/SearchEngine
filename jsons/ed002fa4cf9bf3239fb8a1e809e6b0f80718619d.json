In this paper, we collate a large data repository containing COVID-19 information from a range of different sources. 1 We use this data to develop several predictors and prediction intervals for forecasting the short-term (e.g., over the next week) trajectory of COVID-19-related recorded deaths at the county-level in the United States. Specifically, using data from January 22, 2020, to May 10, 2020, we produce several different predictors and combine their forecasts using ensembling techniques, resulting in an ensemble we refer to as Combined Linear and Exponential Predictors (CLEP). Our individual predictors include county-specific exponential and linear predictors, an exponential predictor that pools data together across counties, and a demographics-based exponential predictor. In addition, we use the largest prediction errors in the past five days to assess the uncertainty of our death predictions, resulting in prediction intervals that we refer to as Maximum (absolute) Error Prediction Intervals (MEPI). We show that MEPI is an effective method in practice with a 94.5% coverage rate when averaged across counties. Our forecasts are already being used by the non-profit organization, Response4Life, to determine the medical supply need for individual hospitals and have directly contributed to the distribution of medical supplies across the country. We hope that our forecasts and data repository can help guide necessary county-specific decision-making and help counties prepare for their continued fight against COVID-19.",

Not only can it help elucidate the overall impacts of the virus, but it can also help guide difficult policy decisions, such as when to impose/ease lock-downs. While many other studies focus on predicting the long-term trajectory of COVID-19, these approaches are currently difficult to verify due to a lack of long-term COVID-19 data. On the other hand, predictions for immediate shortterm trajectories are much easier to verify and are likely much more accurate than long-term forecasts. Moreover, other predictive efforts have focused on modeling COVID-19 case-or death-counts at the national or state-level, rather than the more fine-grained county-level that we consider in this paper.",

Moreover, comparing different counties based on confirmed cases is difficult since some counties have performed many more tests than others: the number of positive tests does not equal the number of actual cases. We note that the confirmed death count is also likely to be an under-count of the number of true COVID-19 deaths (since it seems as though in many cases only deaths occurring in hospitals are being counted). 2 Nonetheless, the confirmed death count is believed to be more reliable than the confirmed case count.",

Specifically, we have compiled and cleaned a large corpus of hospital-and county-level data from 20+ public sources to aid data science efforts to combat COVID-19. The repository currently includes data on COVID-19related cases, deaths, demographics, health resource availability, health risk factors, social vulnerability, and other COVID-19-related information. In Table 1 , we provide an overview of the county-level and hospital-level data sources in our repository. The full corpus of data, along with further details and extensive documentation, are available on GitHub. Note that similar but complementary county-level data was recently aggregated and released in another study [33] . Table 1 : COVID-19 Data Repository: Overview of county-and hospital-level data sets.

Each bubble denotes the count in a county, a darker and larger bubble denotes a higher death count, and lack of bubble denotes that the count is zero. The top panel captures the extent of the outbreak in a region, while the bottom panel captures the recent trends in the outbreak. The color scale in the two plots is different to better illustrate the respective counts in each plot, but we keep the scales for the bubble size the same to provide a comparison between the extent and recent trend of COVID-19. Overall, Figure 2 clearly shows that the COVID-19 outbreak in the United States is very dynamic both in time and across different regions. The worstaffected regions include the states of New York, New Jersey, Massachusetts, Michigan, and parts of Illinois, Florida, Louisiana, Georgia, Washington, and California. Moreover, the majority of these areas continue to face a substantial COVID-19 burden in early May.",

If the first death in a county occurred less than 5 days prior to fitting the predictor, only the days from the first death were used for the fit. If there is only one day's worth of data, we simply predict the most recent value for future values. We also fit exponential predictors to the full time-series (as opposed to just the most recent 5 days) of available data for each county, but due to the rapidly shifting trends, these performed worse than our 5-day predictors. We also found that predictors fit using 6 days of data yielded similar results to predictors fit using 5 days of data, and using 4 days of data performed slightly worse. To handle possible over dispersion of data (when the variance is larger than the mean), we also explored estimating \u03b2 0 , \u03b2 1 by fitting a negative binomial regression model (in place of Poisson GLM) with inverse-scale parameter taking values in {0.05, 0.15, 1}.

As such, the next goal of the paper is to quantify the uncertainty of our predictions by creating prediction intervals. A common method to do so involves constructing (probabilistic) model-based confidence intervals, which rely heavily on the probabilistic assumptions made about the data. However, due to the highly dynamic nature of COVID-19, assumptions on the distribution of death and case rate are challenging to check. Moreover, such prediction intervals based on probability models are likely to be invalid when the underlying probability model does not hold to the desired extent. For instance, a recent study [35] reported that the 95% uncertainty credible intervals for state-level daily mortality predicted by the initial IHME model [22] , had a coverage of a mere 27% to 51% of recorded death counts over March 29 to April 2. The authors of the IHME model noted this behavior, and have since updated their uncertainty intervals so that they now provide more than 95% coverage (where coverage is defined below in equation (10a)). However, while the previous releases of the intervals were based on asymptotic confidence intervals, the IHME authors have not precisely described the methodology for their more recent intervals.",

Where conformal inference uses the raw errors in predictions, MEPI uses the normalized errors, and where conformal inference uses a percentile (e.g., the 95th percentile) of the errors, MEPI uses the maximum. Furthermore, we only make use of the previous five days instead of the full sequence of errors. The reason behind these alternate choices is because the validity of prediction intervals constructed in this manner relies crucially on the assumption that the sequence of errors is exchangeable. Our choices are designed to make this assumption more reasonable. Due to the dynamic nature of COVID-19, considering a longer period (e.g., substantially longer than five days) would mean that it is less likely that the errors across the different days are exchangeable. Meanwhile, the normalization of the errors eliminates a potential source of non-exchangeability by removing the sequential growth of the errors resulting from the increasing nature of the counts themselves. Since we only use 5-time points to construct the interval, the 95th percentile can be rounded up to the maximum. Figure 3 provides empirical evidence that the exchangeability of the normalized residuals/errors under our 5-day window is indeed reasonable. We rank the errors {\u2206 t+5 , \u2206 t , \u2206 t\u22121 , . . . , \u2206 t\u22124 } in increasing order so that the largest error has a rank of 6. If the errors were exchangeable, then for each of them, the rank has a uniform distribution on {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6}, and in particular has a mean of 3.5. To approximate this numerically, we measure the rank of the errors \u2206 t+k and \u2206 t\u2212j , j = 0, . . . , 4, for each day t between March 27 to April 10, and take an average. Figure 3 plots the results for each of the 6 worst hit counties as well as 6 randomly selected counties (see Section 5.2 for more discussion on these counties). . We rank the errors {\u2206 t+5 , \u2206 t , \u2206 t\u22121 , . . . , \u2206 t\u22124 } in increasing order so that the largest error has a rank of 6. If {\u2206 t+5 , \u2206 t , \u2206 t\u22121 , . . . , \u2206 t\u22124 } are exchangeable for any day t, then the expected average rank for each of the six errors would be 3.5 (dashed black line).",

Since there are over 3,000 counties in the United States, we present results for two sets of counties: In Figure 5 , we present the results for the worst-affected counties in the top panel (a), and for the randomly selected counties in the bottom panel (b). The solid black line denotes the recorded death counts, dashed blue line denotes the CLEP 5-day-ahead predictions, and shaded blue region denotes the corresponding MEPI (prediction interval). The predictions and prediction intervals for a given day t (t = April 11, . . . , May 10) are based on data up to day t \u2212 5. Since the predictions are updated daily to reflect latest trends in cumulative deaths for each county, we do not expect the predictions (the dashed blue lines) to be monotonically increasing over time. From Figure 5 (a), we observe that, among the worst-affected counties, the CLEP appears to fit the data very well for Cook County, IL, and Wayne County, MI. However, our predictor greatly over-predicts the number of deaths in four NY counties on April 19, 20, and 21 (the predictions were made on April 14, 15, and 16, respectively). On April 14, New York City reported 3,778 additional deaths that have occurred since March 11 and have been classified as \"probable\". This change led to a sharp uptick of recorded cumulative deaths in Kings, Queens, Bronx, and New York County on April 14. Due to this reporting lag, our CLEP predicted that the four counties were experiencing exponential growth when they were actually experiencing linear growth. As a result, it greatly over-predicts the number of recorded deaths in the following days.",

In addition, directly comparing other models' forecasting results to our own can be difficult for several other reasons: (1) the predictors mostly make strong assumptions and typically do not involve data-fitting, (2) we do not have access to a direct implementation of their predictors (or results), and (3) their predictors focus on substantially longer time horizons. Keeping these points in mind, we now provide a brief summary of recent work on predictive modeling for COVID-19. Two recent works [36] and [28] have modeled the death counts at the state level in the US. The earlier versions of the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation (IHME) [36] model was based on Farr's Law with feedback from Wuhan data; the Imperial College predictor [28] uses an individual-based simulation predictor with parameters chosen based on prior knowledge. On the topic of Farr's Law, we note that a 1990 paper [24] used Farr's Law to predict that the total cases from the AIDS pandemic would diminish by the mid-1990s and the total number of cases would be around 200,000 in the entire lifetime of the AIDS pandemic. It is now estimated that 32 million people have died from the disease so far. While the AIDS pandemic is very different from the COVID-19 pandemic, it is still useful to keep this historical performance in mind.",

To do this, we translate our forecasts into the COVID pandemic severity index, which is a simple measure of the COVID-19 outbreak severity for each hospital. To generate this hospital-level severity index, we divided the total county-level deaths among all of the hospitals in the county proportional to their number of employees. Next, for each hospital, we computed its percentile among all US hospitals with respect to total deaths so far and also with respect to predicted new deaths in the next seven days. These two percentiles are then averaged to obtain a single score for each hospital. Finally, this score is quantized evenly into three categories: low, medium, and high severity. Evaluation and refinement of this index are ongoing, as more hospital-level data becomes available.",

At a high-level, conformal prediction intervals rely simply on the assumption that the sequence of errors is exchangeable. Roughly speaking, the proof proceeds as follows: The exchangeability of the residuals ensures that the rank of the future residual is uniform in the pool of the residuals. Hence the probability of the future residual being in top s-percentile is no larger than s, thereby obtaining the promised s%-coverage.

We compute a maximum over the past 5 days for the normalized errors (instead of 95-percentile threshold over the entire past for the unnormalized errors). Loosely speaking, both our choices-of normalized errors and looking at only past 5 errors-try to make the errors more exchangeable. Given the dynamic nature of COVID-19 and our adaptive predictors, the prediction errors do not remain exchangeable over a long period. Moreover, given that we take 5 data points to bound the future error, computing a maximum over them is a more conservative choice (e.g., when compared to taking median or a percentile-based cut-off). 8 Normalized vs unnormalized errors: We now provide some numerical evidence to support our choice of normalized errors over the 1 -errors to define the MEPI. Figure 8(a) shows the (unnormalized) 1 errors | y t \u2212y t | of our CLEP for the six worst-affected counties over the same period as Figure 3 (March 27-April 10). We found that in all of these counties, the 1 errors on days t\u22124, t\u22123, t\u22122, t\u22121, t and t+5 do not appear to be exchangeable. Recall that under exchangeability conditions, the expected average rank of each of these six 1 errors would be 3.5. However, for all six counties, the average rank of the absolute error on day t + 5 is larger than 4. This indicates that the future absolute error tends to be higher than past errors, and using the 1 error | y t \u2212 y t | in place of the normalized error \u2206 t can lead to substantial underestimation of future prediction uncertainty.",

On the one hand, the probability in equation (12) is taken over the randomness in the errors, and the time-index t + k remains fixed. This observation, in conjunction with the law of large numbers, implies the following: Over multiple independent runs of the time-series, for a given county and a given time t + k, the fraction of runs for which the MEPI PI t+k contains the observed value y t+k converges to 5/6 as the number of runs goes to infinity.
