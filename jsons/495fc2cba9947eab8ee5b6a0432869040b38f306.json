Adult institutions have been flooded with Covid-19 patients and their radiology departments have significantly reduced their throughput of elective imaging studies. Although children appear to be less clinically-affected by Covid-19, pediatric imaging has also been severely constrained by staff shortages and infection control considerations. As a result, adult and pediatric radiology departments across the world are in the midst of enforced imaging austerity, with ongoing wholescale deferral and rescheduling of planned imaging. The longer population movement controls are deemed necessary, the larger the volume of displaced imaging that accumulates. Radiology departments are likely to be severely restricted for a considerable length of time even after populations are permitted to move more freely again. Bringing radiology back to full function will require a balance of clinical assessment, ethical judgement and logistical planning.",

Safe and efficient 'flattening of the curve' in the case of radiology may however be more nuanced than in a public health setting. Starting this process early will minimize further uncertainty, workload and upheaval for patients and staff. We propose four steps that radiology departments should consider: taskforce formation, review of system capabilities, recovery process design, and creating a clear communication strategy.",

The number of staff deployed in-house will continue to be based on multiple considerations, including IT capabilities, volume of hands-on procedures, required presence for pharmaceutical or contrast administration, oversight of on-site trainees, and the perceived value of \"visibility\" of radiologists at the hospital [1] . These factors will vary widely depending on the patient population being served (adult vs pediatric; multispecialty vs sub-specialty settings). Where the radiology department is part of a group there may be better ability to flex to meet the changed demand, even in the absence of adequate baseline staffing and imaging resources. Before Covid-19, radiologist and technologist staffing already ran considerably below required levels at one of our institutions in Dublin, Ireland. Part of our output optimization now involves reassessing staff capabilities and locations of work to best match them to available facilities and clinical need.",
