            "text": "[SARS-CoV-2; previously known as novel coronavirus-2019 (nCoV- 19) ] causes coronavirus disease-2019 . At the time of publication (April 30, 2020), the COVID-19 pandemic has led to 3,090,445 cases and 217,769 deaths across 209 countries according to World Health Organization data. 1 Older patients with COVID-19, those with underlying pulmonary disease, and those with hypertension, diabetes, or established cardiovascular disease have a worse prognosis than their counterparts without these comorbidities. [2] [3] [4] [5] [6] [7] [8] SARS-CoV-2 infects host cells by binding to human angiotensin-converting enzyme-2 (ACE2), [9] [10] [11] a membranebound enzyme expressed in the lungs, heart, and kidneys (among many other organs). 12, 13 Within the heart, pericytes express the greatest levels of ACE2, although cardiomyocytes and endothelial cells also express ACE2. 14 ACE2 catalyzes the conversion of angiotensin-I and angiotensin-II to angiotensin-(1-9) and angiotensin-(1-7), respectively. 15 Angiotensin-II promotes increased sympathetic tone, sodium and water retention, fibrosis and inflammation through the angiotensin type 1 receptor, whereas angiotensin (1-7) counteracts these effects by binding to the Mas receptor (Fig. 1) . 15 It has been proposed that renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) inhibitors predispose to SARS-CoV-19 infection and worsen outcomes after COVID-19 by upregulating ACE2 expression. 16 Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACE inhibitors), angiotensin receptor type 1 blockers (ARBs) and mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists increase heart, vascular, and kidney ACE2 expression and activity in animals. [17] [18] [19] [20] [21] Chronic treatment with an ACE inhibitor for 6 months was associated with increased plasma angiotensin-(1-7) level and angiotensin-II to angiotensin-(1-7) ratio, whereas no such association was observed in the immediate period after acute ACE inhibitor treatment. 22, 23 Spironolactone treatment increased ACE2 activity and mRNA in human monocyte-derived macrophages from patients with heart failure. 21 Yet others support the hypothesis that RAAS inhibitors and ACE2 counteract angiotensin-II-mediated pulmonary injury in respiratory viral illness. 24, 25 These beneficial effects could be attributable to angiotensin-(1-7) binding to the Mas receptor, which promotes anti-inflammatory signaling. 15 In one study of acid aspiration and sepsis lung injury, ACE2 knockout mice and mice pretreated with recombinant human ACE2 had attenuated lung damage. 26 In the same models, treatment of ACE2 knockout mice with an angiotensin type 1 receptor blocker also protected against lung injury. 26 Administration of recombinant human ACE2 beginning one day before respiratory syncytial virus infection decreased pulmonary immune cell infiltration and attenuated histologic lung injury in mice. 27 Recombinant human ACE2 increased angiotensin-(1-7) and decreased angiotensin-II concentrations in patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome, but was stopped early for futility with no significant difference in the partial pressure of arterial oxygen to fraction of inspired oxygen ratio. 28 These data suggest that ACE2 modulation may protect against lung damage from acute respiratory distress syndrome, but do not address whether ACE2 modulation may salvage lung function after the initial lung insult. Moreover, it is unclear whether the hypothetical benefits of ACE2mediated lung protection outweigh the theorized ACE2mediated increase in SARS-CoV-2 entry.",

Plasma ACE2 activity may not represent enzymatic activity at the tissue level, because angiotensin-II infusion into mice decreases myocardial ACE2 protein level and activity, but increases plasma ACE2 activity. 29 Furthermore, increased plasma ACE2 levels are associated with an adverse cardiovascular prognosis. 30 There may be relevant differences between ACE inhibitors and ARBs, and differences within each class, with respect to their effects on circulating and tissue ACE2. In a cross-sectional analysis of adults taking various antihypertensive agents, on-treatment urinary ACE2 concentrations were increased in patients taking olmesartan, but not ACE inhibitors or other ARBs. 31 Conversely, 2 studies demonstrated higher on-treatment circulating levels of angiotensin (1-7) in patients receiving an ACE inhibitor than an ARB. 32, 33 In spontaneously hypertensive rats, sacubitril-valsartan restored cardiac ACE2 mRNA expression, whereas valsartan did not. 34 Circulating angiotensin-(1-7) may not reflect ACE2 activity in patients receiving sacubitril-valsartan because neprilysin converts angiotensin-(1-9) and angiotensin-I to angiotensin-(1-7).",

Interactions between the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system and coronavirus Disease-2019. The complex RAAS regulates blood pressure, sodium and water retention and plays an important role in the pathogenesis of cardiovascular disease. Angiotensin-converting enzyme converts angiotensin-I to angiotensin-II, which mediates vasoconstriction, sodium and water retention and inflammation through the angiotensin type 1 receptor (red arrows). Angiotensin converting enzyme-2 (ACE2) counterbalances the angiotensin-II/angiotensin type 1 receptor pathway by converting angiotensin-II to angiotensin-(1-7), which binds the Mas receptor to mediate vasodilation and anti-inflammatory effects (yellow arrows). Importantly, the angiotensin-II/angiotensin type 1 receptor pathway leads to cleavage of membrane-bound ACE2 via ADAMS17 (green arrow). Severe acute respiratory coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) binds ACE2 and undergoes endocytosis to infect host cells. As a consequence, SARS-CoV-2 infection decreases membrane-bound ACE2 and impairs the beneficial effects of the angiotensin-(1-7)/Mas receptor axis.",
