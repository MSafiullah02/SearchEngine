These proportions are given in Table 2 . Around 40% of links creations increase the number of triangles in the graph whereas this proportion equals 10% in a random (Erd\u00f6s-R\u00e9nyi) graph with the same numbers of vertices and links. The proportion of inactive links that would create a triangle is very low for Imote data set and the simple random graph. This emphasizes the fact that this is not because more links can create triangles that the proportion P+/tri+ is higher in experimental data: it is on the contrary an intrinsic property of the dynamics. As the proportions of links that could create a triangle are similar in both graphs (f +/tri+ ), this phenomenon is characteristic of real graphs: links creations tend to create triangles in fairly large proportion.",

Their design is justified by the previous observations. First, as the contact and inter-contact are powerlaw distributed (as seen in Section 2.1), those non-trivial empirical distributions should be taken into account when constructing a model of the data. Second, computation of empirical times of correlations show that link creation/removal process is less correlated in time that other graphs properties seen in Sect. 2.2. It is also reasonable to consider that links evolutions are uncorrelated in time. These characteristics justify the use of a simple Markovian (memory-less) link creation/removal process. Finally, we observed that for a given number of nodes, the network can have a large number of possible configurations, some of which are very sparse and others more dense. Thus our model should be able to reproduce this property. The simulation is based on a transition model with Markovian property. For each time step and for each link independently, each link changes its state (active or inactive) using a transition probability depending on the time since the link is in its current state. In addition, the probability of transition is weighted by a probability of acceptance of the new state depending of the experimental distribution for a property of interest such as E(t), V (t), N C (t) and D(t). This is implemented by Rejection Sampling [13] , based on a Metropolis-Hasting algorithm and take into account the target distribution of the graph property. To take into account in the simulations that the average proportion of link creations that yield triangles is larger than for random graphs, a weight is applied on the transition probability to reproduce the correct dynamical transition process concerning triangles.",

A first remark is that the sole contact and inter-contact duration distributions dramatically fail to reproduce the properties. More precisely, the number of connected vertices is strongly over-estimated, the number of connected components is under-estimated, and so is the number of triangles. The non-stationarity in the IMOTE data introduces a much higher variance, yet it does not explain all the differences. Fig. 5 illustrates the way the models work. It is based on the distribution of E(t) and N C (t) and produces qualitatively similar characteristics than the real data set. The probability distribution functions of N C (t) (on the rightmost figure) for the original data (black), and the different models proposed are shown. We can observe that by imposing the distribution of the number of connected vertices improves the accuracy of the simulations.",

The connected components in models (sole inter contact and/or with the introduction of graph property PDF) are much less dense. We believe this is of major importance for communication protocol design and realistic models have to reproduce this property and this yield to the introduction of the number of triangle property (the results is depicted on the rightmost figure of Fig 6) . This time, the density of connected components is comparable to the original data set. Note that introducing the dynamic of triangles also yield to the creation of \"social\" groups like the ones depicted in Fig. 4 .
