Intuitively, \u03b2 0 captures immutable aspects of transmission, e.g., the probability of infection upon contact between susceptible and infectious persons. The mobility function captures the reduction in transmissibility due to reduction in population mobility. We define this relationship, f \u03bb (\u00b7), to be piece-wise linear and monotonic;",

The basic reproductive number is a fundamental quantity that describes the number of secondary cases generated by a single case in an entirely susceptible population, denoted R 0 = \u03b2 0 \u00b7 \u03c4 I where \u03c4 I is the average time spent infectious (in days). We define the time-varying basic reproductive number R 0,t = R 0 \u00b7 f \u03bb (Mobility t ) to account for changes in R 0 due to population behavior changing over time (i.e., mobility patterns). Another quantity of interest is the effective reproductive number R E,t , which accounts for the current state of the infection in the population, R E,t = R 0,t \u00b7 (S t /N ) where S t /N is the proportion of individuals who remain susceptible at time t, and N is the population size. We fit this model to counts of daily deaths (and daily hospitalizations where available) from two public data sources (21, 22) , including observations up to April 25th. We focus our analysis on eight states -New York, California, Washington, Texas, Georgia, Louisiana, Florida, and Massachusetts -selected to balance urban-rural variation and enough observed deaths (and hospitalizations) to fit the model.

Fig. 4 depicts our forecasts of cumulative deaths, hospital occupancy, and the proportion of the population remaining susceptible through December 31, 2020. In all states analyzed, increasing mobility without other changes to behavior is expected to lead to substantially worse outcomes, in size or duration of the outbreak, than maintaining current mobility (see SM for results from additional states). In Florida, increasing mobility even a small amount results in R E,t > 1 inducing a massive secondary outbreak. The timing and extent of the outbreak is determined by the increase 7 .

Our findings suggest that mobility data can be used as a leading indicator of changes in transmission rates, supporting the evaluation of public health interventions.

We also emphasize that the inferred relationship between population mobility and transmission reflects observations of the pandemic ramping up in the U.S. This relationship can change over time, however, through behavioral changes not strictly related to population mobility. For example, if mask-wearing and social-distancing continue, the baseline \u03b2 0 (and thus R 0 ) may be smaller than the pre-intervention \u03b2 0 . Indeed, our simulations show that we must reduce baseline transmission rates with non-mobility behavioral changes to return to even a fraction of pre-pandemic mobility patterns.

A key quantity needed for the W&T method is the serial-interval distribution that describes the time from symptom onset in a primary case to symptom onset in a secondary distribution. The R0 package for the R programming language was used to estimate R E,t (33). In Figs. 13-16 we depict the estimated R E,t over time using a Weibull serial-interval distribution with shape 5.4 and scale 4 (17) . Note that there is a steady decrease in R E,t over time according to the case data. In each of these figures we also plot the estimated R E,t against the percent-change in routing volume. In each state we observe a decrease in R E,t corresponding to a decrease in routing volume. To quantify this relationship we used robust linear regression for the model R E,t = \u03b2Z t +b. We fit the model to the simulated data described above. The resulting best fit lines are shown in Figs. 13-16 and are reported in Table 1 . The coefficients are small but are statistically significant. In Fig. 17 we depict the inferred relationship for three serial-interval distributions with shape parameters 3, 5.4, and 8, (all with scale parameter 4). The relationship between R E,t and routing volume varies with the shape of the serial-interval distribution, growing as the shape parameter increases, similarly to the relationship learned in the main paper. Additionally, the variation differs between each shape indicating a dependence on the overall level of R E,t .",

We test different strengths of the informativeness of this prior by setting different standard deviations. For the 'weak' version, we set the R 0 scale to be 9, corresponding to an upper 97.5 percentile equal to R 0 = 20.9. For the 'medium' version, we set the prior R 0 scale to 6, corresponding to an upper 97.5 percentile equal to R 0 = 14.4. For the 'strong' version, the prior R 0 scale is set to 3, corresponding to an upper 97.5 percentile of R 0 = 8.3. Note that placing a prior on R 0 and a prior on \u03c4 I induces a prior over \u03b2 0 . For average time spent infectious, we see a wide range of evidence in the literature. (18) analyze Chinese cities using a dynamical model and infer that the average time spent infectious is 3.47 days (3.15, 3.73 95% credible interval). (19) examine virologic characteristics of a small sample (n = 12) of patients in the United States and find that average time between first and final positive rRT-PCR test is 16 days (12-21 95% CI). While this does not imply the average time spent infectious is 16 days, it suggests the use of a more diffuse prior on infectious time, \u03c4 I =",
