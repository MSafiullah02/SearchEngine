The novel coronavirus pandemic (COVID-19) is exacerbating this already dire situation and is currently causing a significant increase in the rate of HAIs around the world (2, 3). The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) virus is mainly transmitted through droplets, close contact with infected individuals and contaminated surfaces (4) . This makes healthcare workers (HCWs) a highly susceptible population both for contracting as well as for spreading the virus. The infection prevention and control (IPC) measures to limit or prevent HAIs caused by the SARS-CoV-2 are crucial to combatting this pandemic. Hand hygiene is widely recognized as the most effective and economically viable measure in IPC (5).",

In the USA, it is estimated that around 1.7 million patients are affected by HAIs each year, and that they account for 99,000 deaths, costing hospitals between US$35.7 to US$45 billion (1).

Though all HCWs are exposed at various levels, nurses are evidently at the front lines with the most patient contact. They are the ones responsible for daily patient care, while simultaneously being responsible for protecting patients against HAIs. If their IPC practices, especially their hand hygiene, are suboptimal, nurses become a source of transmission of infections between patients and to themselves. Contaminated hands are one of the main vectors of spreading SARS-CoV-2 (7). It is crucial that nurses adhere to proper hand hygiene in order to reduce HAIs, save money and ultimately, save lives. To achieve acceptable levels of hand hygiene compliance, nursing teams need to be adequately staffed, well trained, and have access to good quality alcohol-based handrub (8) . Adequate hand hygiene would ensure prevention of nosocomial spread not only from patient to patient through contaminated HCW hands, but also from patients to HCWs.",

Adequate staffing is not the only challenge to the HCW population; IPC measures are crucial for keeping HCWs healthy and operational in hospitals.

The economic implications of successful hand hygiene improvement have long been established. It has been demonstrated that these programs cost less than 1% of the HAI-related costs, making them relatively cheap and unequivocally worth investing in (13) . In another study, the net benefit of a hospital-wide hand hygiene program was reported as US$5,289,364, again proving the program's cost-effectiveness compared to the costs generated by HAIs (14) .
