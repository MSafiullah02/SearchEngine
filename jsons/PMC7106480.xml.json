            "text": "Respiratory tract infections are the most common infections worldwide, with an estimate of two to four infections per year in adults [1]. Especially during the colder season respiratory tract infections occur frequently and may cause significant morbidity and mortality in immunosuppressed populations such as oncological patients [2], [3], [4]. The clinical presentation of an infection with respiratory pathogens can range from asymptomatic to severe disease. Considering the broad range of respiratory pathogens it is hardly possible to assign clinical symptoms to a distinct etiology. Hence, molecular diagnostic methods have been established as gold standard and are replacing less sensitive and more laborious traditional diagnostic methods such as virus isolation by culture or direct immunofluorescence [1], [3], [5], [6], [7], [8], [9], [10]. However, the comprehensive investigation of a respiratory tract infection is time- and resource-consuming when applying singleplex PCR. Therefore, multiplex-based test methods for the detection of numerous respiratory pathogens are entering routine diagnostics [8], [9], [11], [12].",

Besides higher test sensitivity the extended spectrum of the RespiFinder Smart22 contributed to the higher positivity rate as Bocavirus and CoV-HKU1 were detected in 7.3% of the samples. A further reason for the difference in the positivity rate is the selective ordering in routine diagnosis. In six (6.3% of the total 96) samples the MLPA method detected an additional pathogen, which is actually included in the range of the RealAccurate Respiratory RT PCR Kit but had not been ordered. The results of five of these samples were confirmed by the reference laboratory. Retesting with the RT PCR method yielded a result in four of the six samples, confirming the higher test sensitivity of the RespiFinder Smart22 for Rhv/Entero. Narrow spectrum diagnostics of respiratory tract infections is considered problematic because of their nonspecific clinical presentation [3]. Therefore, PCR detection of InfA/B, RSV, PIV and in second line hMPV, Rhv/Entero, CoV and Adv is recommended for at-risk patients [21], [22]. Especially in HSCT recipients it is important to accurately and swiftly diagnose respiratory infections because of potential progression to severe complications such as pneumonia and also for hospital hygiene reasons [23], [24], [25], [26], [27].",

The RespiFinder Smart22 showed a TTR of 5 h 56 min for three clinical samples which is consistent with the 6 h indicated by the manufacturer. Since 90.4% of the TTR consist of incubation time the manufacturer recently introduced an updated version of the kit with a reduction of incubation time by 2 h [31]. Thus, reporting results within a working day of 8 h should easily be possible. The TTR of the RealAccurate Respiratory RT PCR Kit was 3 h 26 min which is significantly longer than the TTR of 2 h stated by the manufacturer since independent of the numbers of patient samples already the LC-run lasts 123 min [32]. When analyzing the complete respiratory panel of three samples in parallel, two LightCyclers are needed or, if there is only one machine, incubation time doubles and the receipt of the results is delayed by 123 min. However, if a 96-well Real Time PCR instrument is available three samples can be processed in a single run. The multiplex format of the RespiFinder Smart22 allows analysis of up to 15 patient samples in parallel, underscoring the advantage of multiplex-based methods in comparison to singleplex PCR concerning the factor time [5]. Most important, hands on time (HOT) was more than halved by the MLPA method, which is a significant improvement regarding lab staff time commitment.",
