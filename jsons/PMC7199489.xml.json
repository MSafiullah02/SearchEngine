In the developed world, Kawasaki disease is the most common cause of acquired heart disease in children [1]. The diagnosis of Kawasaki disease is based entirely on clinical features. For classic Kawasaki disease, individuals must have a fever for \u2a7e5 days and either meet at least 4 of 5 criteria-(1) bilateral conjunctivitis; (2) erythema of the mouth or pharynx, strawberry tongue, or stomatitis; (3) polymorphous rash; (4) erythema or edema of the hands or feet; and (5) nonsuppurative cervical lymphadenopathy-or meet at least 3 of these criteria and have evidence of coronary artery abnormalities [2]. Incomplete or atypical Kawasaki disease, in which these criteria are not met, can occur and can also result in aneurysms of the coronary arteries [3]. The etiology of Kawasaki disease is unknown. Laboratory findings are nonspecific, and there are no diagnostic tests for Kawasaki disease.",

Epidemics of Kawasaki disease, with wavelike spread, have been observed in many countries [4]. Epidemics generally occur during winter and spring. Kawasaki disease is rare in infants <3 months old, which suggests the possibility that they are protected from infection by antibodies that are passively acquired from the mother. Likewise, widespread immunity to a common infectious agent may explain the rarity of Kawasaki disease in adults. A history of an antecedent respiratory illness before the onset of Kawasaki disease has been reported [5]. Although many infectious agents have been proposed as the cause of Kawasaki disease, none have been consistently associated with the disease. By using synthetic antibodies, Rowley et al. recently identified an antigen in respiratory epithelial cells and macrophages from children with Kawasaki disease [6]. The origin of this antigen remains unknown.",

            "text": "Human coronaviruses (HCoVs) have attracted renewed interest recently, in part because of the emergence of a novel HCoV associated with severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) [7, 8]. Before the emergence of CoV-SARS, HCoVs were generally thought to cause mild, self-limited infections of the upper respiratory tract. The study of HCoVs has been hampered by the difficulty in propagating these viruses in vitro [9]. To determine whether previously unknown HCoVs are circulating in the human population, we developed genetic probes that target regions of the replicase 1a gene that are conserved among HCoVs, avian CoVs, and mammalian CoVs. The screening of stored specimens of respiratory tract secretions from children <5 years old revealed evidence of a novel HCoV, designated \u201cNew Haven coronavirus\u201d (HCoV-NH) [10]. On the basis of sequence and phylogenetic analysis of the replicase 1a gene, HCoV-NH is closely related to an HCoV recently identified in The Netherlands [11, 12]. One child in our study, a 6-month-old infant who had 2 respiratory specimens test positive for HCoV-NH, was diagnosed with Kawasaki disease. To further investigate the possible association between HCoV-NH infection and Kawasaki disease, we expanded the time frame to the entire period during which we had obtained specimens, and we conducted a case-control study to assess this association.",

If HCoV-NH infection is the cause of Kawasaki disease and is common, it is unclear why the disease occurs in a relatively small number of children. In most individuals, the pathogenesis of Kawasaki disease is likely distinct from the pathogenesis of viral respiratory tract infections. However, Kawasaki disease may result from an abnormal clonal expansion of CD8+ T cells [18] in response to an infectious agent.

The percentage of HCoV-NH-positive control subjects (4.5%) was similar to our previous finding [10]. The selection of control subjects from children with suspected respiratory tract infection would tend to bias the results toward there being no association between HCoV-NH infection and Kawasaki disease\u2014control subjects would more likely be infected with HCoV-NH than would children without symptoms of respiratory tract infection. If this potential bias affected the present study, then the true association would be stronger than we have already shown. The difference in the age distribution between the case subjects and the control subjects was small (mean difference, <1 month), and so it is extremely unlikely that this factor accounted for the difference between the proportions of case and control subjects infected with HCoVNH. False-positive results that are caused by PCR contamination are a concern in any study that uses genomic amplification techniques. To address this issue, appropriate negative controls were included in each set of RT-PCR amplifications, and we required that 2 regions of the HCoV-NH genome be amplified for the specimen to be considered positive. Moreover, for the observed association to have been caused by contamination, it would have been necessary that the specimens from the case subjects were preferentially contaminated\u2014a highly improbable scenario. Each amplicon was sequenced, to confirm the presence of HCoV-NH. Distinct genetic polymorphisms were observed in the HCoV-NH sequences identified in the isolates from the case subjects. This further reduces the likelihood that PCR contamination explains our findings.",
