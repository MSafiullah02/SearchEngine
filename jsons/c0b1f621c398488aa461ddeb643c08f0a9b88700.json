Aortic wall weakness and abnormal aortic hemodynamic profiles predispose these patients to dilatation of the thoracic aorta, which is generally silent but can precipitate aortic dissection or rupture with devastating and often fatal consequences. Current strategies to assess the future risk of aortic dissection or rupture are based primarily on monitoring aortic diameter. However, diameter alone is a poor predictor of risk, with many patients experiencing dissection or rupture below current intervention thresholds. Developing tools that improve the risk assessment of those with aortopathy is internationally regarded as a research priority. A robust understanding of the molecular pathways that lead to aortic wall weakness is required to identify biomarkers and therapeutic targets that could improve patient management. Here, we summarize the current understanding of the genetically determined mechanisms underlying inherited aortopathies and critically appraise the available blood biomarkers, imaging techniques, and therapeutic targets that have shown promise for improving the management of patients with these important and potentially fatal conditions. of aneurysm formation, and risk factors for their progression and complications are different in the 2 areas. Consequently, although there are distinct similarities, it is prudent to consider thoracic and abdominal aortic disease processes separately. Here, we focus on the disease processes of thoracic aortopathy.",

The aorta acts as a conduit for blood by connecting the heart to the major arteries, ensuring blood flow to all the vital organs of the body. Being the most proximal artery to the heart, the thoracic aorta, the portion of the aorta contained within the chest, withstands the highest pressure and wall stresses through >30 million pressure cycles a year. The thoracic aortic wall must therefore function as a robust biomechanical structure, loading and unloading the cardiac volume efficiently and reliably throughout life. To achieve this, the molecular and biomechanical environment of the aortic wall is monitored and stabilized through a complex interplay between vascular wall cells and the extracellular matrix. Unfortunately, this robust homeostatic process can be disturbed through a variety of disease processes, collectively described as thoracic aortopathies, in which the thoracic aortic wall becomes weak and vulnerable. Embryologically, the descending thoracic and abdominal aorta arises from the mesoderm, whereas the aortic root and ascending aorta are derived from the neural crest, leading to differences in gene expression and behavior of vascular smooth muscle cells in each region. 1 Furthermore, the aortic wall composition, mechanisms",

            "text": "Inherited thoracic aortopathies denote conditions in which abnormalities lead to thoracic aortic wall weakness or abnormal aortic hemodynamic profiles, predisposing patients to aortic dilatation, aneurysm formation, and acute aortic complications. Degradation of the components of the thoracic aortic wall can also occur as part of acquired processes, for example, associated with aging or high blood pressure, factors that potentially compound genetically influenced thoracic aortic wall weakness. Patients with inherited aortopathy are at substantially increased risk of acute aortic complications, including aortic dissection or rupture, carrying with it major mortality risk. Because the outcomes from elective surgery are superior to those associated with emergency repair once dissection has occurred, current international guidelines advocate a focus on recognizing those at risk early, regular monitoring with imaging, and prophylactically replacing the diseased aortic segment once a threshold diameter is reached (Table 1 ). [2] [3] [4] [5] [6] [7] [8] Even with these guidelines and robust monitoring, many patients with inherited thoracic aortopathy still experience aortic dissection or rupture while still below the threshold diameter, whereas others may undergo surgery for thoracic aortic aneurysms that are unlikely to dissect or rupture. 9, 10 There is therefore universal agreement that better identification and risk stratification of thoracic aortopathy are urgently required. Indeed, a substantial body of research has been dedicated to exploring and developing novel solutions to this problem. This review summarizes the epidemiology and underlying pathological processes associated with inherited aortopathy, outlines current management strategies, and examines the evidence supporting promising therapeutic targets and emerging biomarkers for these high-risk aortopathies.",

There is also a demonstrable relationship between the number of intact elastin layers and the pressure required to propagate dissection or cause aortic rupture. 16 Elastic fibers are anchored to vascular smooth muscle cells via focal adhesions, as well as being supported by a scaffold of extracellular molecules, including fibrillin, integrins, and collagen. Vascular smooth muscle cells and fibroblasts also maintain the extracellular matrix environment by producing tropoelastin, collagens, and microfibrils, along with proteins that promote medial healing and remodeling, for example, matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) and tissue inhibitors of metalloproteinases (TIMPs).",

In the modern era of regular aortic monitoring and prophylactic surgery, life expectancy has been much improved with reduced rates of acute aortic events ( Table 2 ). 40 Fibrillin-1 is the primary subunit of microfibrils, which are an important component of the aortic wall extracellular matrix. Fibrillin-1 plays a major role in the assembly and support of elastin by promoting adhesion to vascular smooth muscle cells through interaction with lysyl oxidase (encoded by LOX) and fibronectin, as well as enhancing elasticity through its microfibrillar structure ( Figure 2 ). 41 Changes in fibrilin-1 lead to reduced elastic fiber genesis in early life and to reduced elastic fiber adhesion to vascular smooth muscle cells, both of which compromise the biomechanical integrity of the aortic wall. Fibrillin-1 also has a role in maintaining aortic wall homeostasis by binding to latent transforming growth hormone-\u03b2-binding proteins, which sequester transforming growth factor-\u03b2 (TGF\u03b2; Figure 2 ), a molecule implicated in the pathogenesis of a number of inherited thoracic aortopathies.",

Nonsyndromic aortopathy is increasingly recognized as an important clinical entity, seen in up to 89% of aortopathy cohorts. 47 The underlying genetic causes of nsHTAD include mutations in genes encoding members of TGF\u03b2 signaling pathway (TGFBR1, TGFBR2, TGFB2, SMAD3); the structure and integrity of the aortic wall extracellular matrix, including FBN1 (described earlier); COL3A1 and lysyl oxidase (LOX); or those affecting the function of smooth muscle cells, including actin (ACTA2), myosin (MYH11), myosin light chain kinase (MYLK), and protein kinase cGMP-dependent 1 (PRKG1). Taken together, causative mutations can be found in only \u224820% of nsHTAD cases, leaving many without a genetic diagnosis. 32 In probands with a confirmed mutation, many have mutations in FBN1 without meeting revised Ghent criteria to diagnose Marfan syndrome. 47 Furthermore, up to 35% have mutations in SMAD3 and 14% have ACTA2 mutations, whereas pathological mutations in MYH11, MYLK, PRKG1, LOX, and other less well-depicted genes are limited to a smaller number of families. 33, 48, 49 In a cohort of patients experiencing acute aortic events with confirmed pathological mutations, the average age at the time of the event was 41 years, with only 54% having aortic root aneurysms (Table 2) . 32 Those with pathological mutations are more likely to experience aortic intervention or dissection at a young age, particularly those <50 years of age, whereas those >60 years of age are much less likely to carry pathological mutations. 33, 47 In patients with nsHTAD with a pathogenic mutation, many mutations cause disease by affecting the function of vascular smooth muscle cells. 33, 47 Vascular smooth muscle cells are the primary cell of the medial layer, providing contractile stress (tone) and anchoring the elastic fibers of the extracellular matrix, which confers overall stability. The intracellular structure of vascular smooth muscle cells and tone generation are governed by smooth muscle cell-specific \u03b1-actin and myosin, the function of which can be disrupted in the vascular smooth muscle cell mutations, leading to increased cell death, decreased aortic wall tone, and reduced extracellular matrix stability ( Figure 2 ).",

The mechanisms that predispose patients with bicuspid aortic valve to aortopathy are still emerging, with evidence supporting both biomechanical and genetic causes. Multiple studies have demonstrated the important influence that abnormal thoracic aortic flow patterns have on underlying aortic wall TGF\u03b2\u03b2 pathway signaling, elastin breakdown, dilatation location, and the risk of aortic events. 51, 52 There are sex and racial differences in the prevalence of bicuspid aortic valve, with men and white individuals the most likely to be affected. 53 Furthermore, there is clustering of affected individuals within families. Taken together, these strongly suggest the presence of an inherited disease process. Yet, similar to nsHTAD, in the majority of cases, no definite genetic cause can be found. 54 TGF\u03b2 \u03b2pathway mutations, there is an increased prevalence of bicuspid aortic valve, suggesting an inherent link between bicuspid aortic valve formation and thoracic aortopathy in these groups. 55 Furthermore, there is a growing number of reports describing specific mutations in patients with bicuspid aortic valve and aortopathy but without the systemic features of connective tissue disease, for example, ROBO4 and NOTCH1, which affect endothelial permeability and endocardial/endothelial differentiation, respectively, although the link between NOTCH1 and aortic events is not well described. 56, 57 Overall, although bicuspid aortic valve is an independent risk factor for developing a progressive aortopathy, it is clear that the risks are compounded by a spectrum of genetic variants that affect how the thoracic aortic wall develops and remodels. In clinical practice, the ambiguity surrounding the genetic influence on acute aortic event risk can make deciding when to offer familial aortic screening and genetic evaluation challenging.",

Echocardiographic screening of the aorta in first-degree relatives can be a useful and affordable tool for establishing the prevalence of aortic dilatation within the family, both solidifying a diagnosis of an inherited aortopathy and identifying at-risk family members who will require more regular aortic surveillance ( Figure 3) .

In the clinical setting, this genetic testing is best performed when positive results are actionable by adding meaningful prognostic information affecting the patient's medical care and influencing important clinical decisions, for example, the timing of prophylactic aortic replacement surgery. Families should be aware that a clear genetic cause can be found in only \u224820% of cases, which may lead to a degree of uncertainty. 33 In these cases, a robust mechanism for monitoring family members, whether apparently affected or not, will be required because aortopathy may not develop until later in life (Figure 3 ). 58 The majority of commercially available gene panels across the United States and Europe also include targeted sequencing of genes with an association with thoracic aortopathy that is less well established (Figure 3) . Although there is a role for expanded genetic testing, particularly in the context of gene discovery research, prospective counseling on the consequences of uncertain results and follow-up aortic monitoring will be crucial when supporting families in this scenario. Improved understanding of the genedisease aortic risk association and novel gene discovery are going to be vital to improving the care received by these families with inherited aortopathies. To move toward the eventual goal of personalized gene-adapted management, longitudinal international collaboration with the pooling of affected patients will be essential to overcoming the lack of power consequent to the rarity of gene-positive disease. Until then, treatment, management, and counseling of patients with a confirmed inherited aortic disease are based on reducing the risk of acute aortic events through an understanding of biomechanical and biological principles.",

Increased aortic wall circumferential stress is understood to be related to an increase in blood pressure and aortic diameter or a decrease in aortic wall thickness through the Law of Laplace. Expansion of aortic diameter with sustained blood pressure, as with aortic dilatation, increases wall stress and subsequently the risk of acute aortic events. This risk is reflected in the substantial increase in aortic event rate seen in ascending aortic aneurysms >60 mm. Similarly, increased blood pressure caused by raised systemic vascular resistance-for example, coarctation, obesity, or essential hypertensionraises wall stress and consequently the risk of acute aortic events. 35 Likewise, pregnancy is associated with increased cardiac output and hormonal changes that, in the context of aortopathy, can lead to an irreversible increase in aortic root diameter and a higher likelihood of acute aortic events. 59 This risk is reflected in current international counseling guidance that categorizes all inherited thoracic aortic diseases as at least modified World Health Organization risk group II (small increase risk of maternal mortality or moderate increased risk of morbidity) with a reasonable proportion in the highest risk category IV (extremely high risk of maternal mortality or severe morbidity), depending on the condition and degree of prepregnancy aortic dilatation (Table 4 ). 60 Prepregnancy counseling is therefore crucial for women of child-bearing age with aortopathy.",

With noninvasive twodimensional aortic imaging (computed tomography, magnetic resonance imaging [MRI], or ultrasound), aortic compliance can be assessed by the use of strain, the increase in the aortic wall length as a proportion of the baseline length. Strain can be measured in the circumferential and longitudinal directions, with distensibility representing circumferential strain divided by pulse pressure. 62 Alternatively, aortic stiffness can be inferred from how quickly the pulse wave propagates through the aorta, known as pulse-wave velocity, which is measured with applanation tomography or extrapolated from four-dimensional flow sequences on MRI. Aortopathy in Marfan syndrome, Loeys-Dietz syndrome, Turner syndrome, and nsHTAD is associated with increased aortic stiffness. 63, 64 Ex vivo biomechanical testing of dilated aortas demonstrates that increased stiffness appears to be attributable to higher collagen and lower elastin content, making aortic stiffness a proxy marker of wall remodeling, which may be apparent well before aortic diameters begin to increase. 14 Consistently, the aortic stiffness increases with age, and a steep rise in stiffness is seen after 55 years of age, coinciding with the natural decreases in elastin. There is also a strong relationship between increasing diameter and increasing aortic stiffness. In Marfan syndrome, aortic stiffness is increased in those with either dilated or nondilated aortas. More important, reduced longitudinal aortic strain is associated with increased aortic event rates in Marfan syndrome after adjustment for aortic diameter. 62 Larger studies are required to corroborate the role of aortic stiffness in identifying high-risk aortopathy after adjustment for dilatation in connective tissue disorders and bicuspid aortic valve.",

Blood measurement of TGF\u03b2 is an attractive biomarker both for linking to disease progression and as a research tool in measuring effects of TGF\u03b2-modifying treatments (eg, TGF\u03b2 response to angiotensin receptor blocker therapy). Progress toward translation has been hampered by difficulties in reliably measuring active TGF\u03b21 in the blood. Platelets are TGF\u03b21 rich, and degranulation, as occurs in serum preparation and when exposed to high shear stress as part of sampling, can contribute to 90% of TGF\u03b21 levels and therefore mask any changes caused by pathological processes. 75 Optimal blood-taking methodology that reduces the amount of platelet degranulation has been well described, 76 with many studies not reporting venesection techniques or measuring concomitant platelet activation. When concomitant platelet activity is assessed, no difference can be found in plasma TGF\u03b21 concentrations between patients with Marfan syndrome with dilated aortic roots or previous surgery and control subjects. 77 Given the evidence for its role in the progression of aortopathy, active TGF\u03b21 could be a useful marker of disease progression and a guide to effective medical treatment. However, more research is required to ensure reliability (adjusting for platelet activation) and international consistency. Furthermore, because TGF\u03b21 is abundant throughout the body, whether plasma concentrations specifically reflect aortic wall activity and predict disease progression remains to be validated.",

The primary role of these MMPs is to cleave and digest extracellular proteins such as elastin, collagen, and integrins as part of aortic wall repair, remodeling, and homeostasis. Under pathological conditions, the unchecked activity of specific MMPs can be detrimental to the cardiovascular system by causing excess destruction of vascular wall components. Murine studies have specifically implicated MMP-2 and MMP-9 in thoracic aortic aneurysm formation, and they are the most promising targets for translation as markers and potential modulators of disease. 78, 79 Efforts have been made to use MMP-2 and MMP-9 as prognostic biomarkers for thoracic aortic disease severity. Human induced pluripotent stem cell line study of patients with Marfan syndrome demonstrates increased MMP-9 levels compared with reference cell lines. 80 As with TGF\u03b21, translation of MMPs into reliable biomarkers of aortic wall remodeling is attractive. However, blood MMP-9 and MMP-2 concentrations are sensitive to caffeine and the collection method (citrate deemed most stable) and require quick processing (within 2 hours) to prevent artifactual changes in quantification. 81, 82 Appropriately measured plasma MMP-2 concentrations have been linked to increased aortic diameter and repeatably linked to increased aortic stiffness, although no studies to date have made links to outcomes. 83, 84 Given their association with abnormal aortic function and the mechanism of action, MMPs have been a target for translation of medical therapy. Doxycycline, a generalized inhibitor of MMPs, can prevent aneurysm formation and preserve elastic fiber integrity and aortic biomechanics in animal models. 85 However, when translated to human abdominal aortic aneurysms, 100 mg doxycycline over 18 months resulted in a small but significant increase, rather than decrease, in aortic growth rate compared with placebo. 86 Although MMPs appear to play a role in aortic wall pathology, their precise role remains to be determined. Progress may be made by improving our understanding of how MMPs are moderated through their naturally occurring inhibitors.",

            "text": "Vascular medial microcalcification is the pathological accumulation of hydroxyapatite crystals within the media of large arteries and has been strongly linked to adverse cardiovascular outcome. It occurs through multiple mechanisms that are separate from the intimal calcification that occurs in in atherosclerosis. Vascular medial microcalcification is understood to occur via 3 primary mechanisms: calcium deposition on damaged elastin, excess intracellular calcium released by stressed smooth muscle cells into vesicles or through cell death, or pathological osteogenic phenotype switching by vascular smooth muscle cells. 95 Because the presence of medial microcalcification represents ongoing pathological processes, noninvasive detection and quantification could be a valuable marker of aortic wall disease. 18 F-sodium fluoride is a molecular tracer that binds to hydroxyapatite, thus allowing noninvasive detection and quantification of aortic wall microcalcification. 96 A recent study investigating the utility of 18 F-sodium fluoride to predict clinical events in abdominal aortic aneurysms found that patients in the highest tertile of aneurysmal 18 F-sodium fluoride uptake had the quickest growth rate and an increased incidence of surgical repair or rupture. 97 Given the role that medial microcalcification plays in many common end points of pathological change of ascending aortopathy (elastin calcification, vascular smooth muscle apoptosis, extracellular matrix calcium deposition) and the promising results toward abdominal aortic aneurysms prognostication, it would appear to be an ideal candidate for translation in inherited thoracic aortopathy.",

A combination of an abnormal hemodynamic profile and genetic abnormalities leading to aortic wall weakness predisposes these patients to life-threatening aortic dissection or rupture. Current management relies on aortic diameter, along with a few clinical risk factors, to decide on whether surgical intervention is required. However, there is international recognition that better models for predicting and preventing acute aortic events is required. Our understanding of the mechanisms underpinning inherited aortopathies has improved substantially, although major uncertainties still surround the identification and management of some inherited aortopathies, particularly nsHTAD. Continuing to develop large international collaborative research efforts is vital to improving management strategies for imaging, treatment, genetic screening, and counseling of these individuals. Novel therapies and biomarkers of thoracic aortopathies are urgently required. However, thus far, translating improved mechanistic understanding into reliable biomarkers or therapies has proved difficult.",
