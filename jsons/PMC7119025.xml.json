More and more evidences have identified the transmission route of infectious diseases through respiratory droplets in enclosed environments [1], [2], [3]. Li et al. [4] made a multidisciplinary review of the relationship between infectious airborne transmission and ventilation in built environment. They believed that there is a strong and sufficient evidence of the association between spread of infectious agent (including measles, tuberculosis, chickenpox, influenza, smallpox, and severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)) and ventilation and airflow pattern indoors. With the successive outbreaks of SARS, avian influenza and recently A/H1N1 influenza, understanding of infectious aerosol transmission behaviors between occupants in typical ventilation rooms becomes not only important but also emergent.",

Mui et al. [10] investigated transmission of exhaled droplet nuclei between a polluting manikin and a receiver under MV and DV in an empty room. These investigations mainly focus on the dispersion characteristics of exhaled droplets under different total volume (TV) ventilation systems.

            "text": "The main purpose of PV is to provide clean and cool air close to each occupant [11]. If the clean core region of PV airflow could effectively reach the breathing zone of occupants, the inhaled pollutant concentration would decrease significantly [11]. Pantelic et al. [12] found the protective role of PV for an exposed manikin against droplets released from a \u2018coughing machine\u2019 in three distances experimentally. They found that PV combined with TV could both reduce the peak aerosol concentration levels in the breathing zone and shorten the exposure time compared with TV alone. However, when the occupant using PV is infected, the PV airflow would help promote infectious exhaled droplets mixing with TV airflows and would enhance their spread indoors. These could cause a higher infection probability of other people in the same room. Cermak and Melikov [13], [14], [15] studied the transmission of infectious agents between two occupants under different total volume ventilation strategies combined with two types of PV using tracer gas method in a full-scale test room. However, the diameters of exhaled droplets may span a wide range from O(1 \u03bcm) to O(1000 \u03bcm) [16]. In a recent experimental study carried out by Morawska et al. [17], the exhaled droplets for all respiratory activities were most in the mode with diameters below 0.8 \u03bcm. Speech activity produced additional particles in modes near 3.5 and 5 \u03bcm. Whereas Chao et al. [18] reported that the geometric mean diameter of exhaled droplets was 13.5 \u03bcm from coughing and 16.0 \u03bcm for speaking using the same experimental system and interferometric Mie imaging (IMI) technique for droplet size measurement. For fine particles smaller than 1 \u03bcm, tracer gas may be a good surrogate due to the aerodynamic characteristics of fine particles. But for coarse particles, this method may cause significant difference.",

The origin of the coordinate system was selected at the center of the floor plane (Fig. 3\n).

Table 1\nshows the detail of the geometry and center coordinates of the numerical thermal manikins used in this study. Constant heat-flux boundary conditions were set for the skins of the manikins. The front one was a polluting source (denoted as P) which exhaled infected airflow at 6 l/min and 35 \u00b0C [14] through the mouth (20 \u00d7 10 mm) [27] at 45\u00b0 downward [22]. The back one was an exposed person (denoted as E) which inhaled airflow at 6 l/min through the mouth (20 \u00d7 10 mm) at 45\u00b0 upward. Although the breathing rate is various in different studies [20], the experimental results of Rim and Novoselac [28] indicated that breathing of a sedentary manikin has little influence on the airflow field in the breathing zone and it has very small impact on the occupant\u2019s thermal plume. The experimental results of Pantelic [12] also demonstrated that droplets concentrations measured in the breathing zone of a thermal manikin were similar with and without a normal breathing process. Therefore, the fixed breathing rate set in the current simulation instead of transient breathing curve is rational in regard to the evaluation of inhaled concentration of the exposed manikin and spatial distributions of pollutants.",

Generally, IF of UFAD alone for 0.8 \u03bcm particles and 5 \u03bcm particles were slightly higher than that of DV. This is because UFAD is a partial stratified ventilation system. High momentums from swirling diffusers of UFAD enhance mixing of pollutants in the lower region of the room which results in relatively higher concentrations in the occupied zone of the exposed manikin (also shown in Fig. 10). It could be envisaged that weak mixing and strong stratification in the occupied zone is able to restrict lateral dispersion of particles and consequently protect the occupants. For 16 \u03bcm particles, IFUFAD > IFMV > IFDV. UFAD held the highest IF for 16 \u03bcm particles because the upward swirling airflows hinder local deposition and promote mixing of heavy 16 \u03bcm particles greatly in the lower region near the exposed manikin.

When PV airflow rate was 15 l/s each, IF of the exposed manikin was a little smaller than using DV alone. This is because personalized air promotes dispersion of the exhaled particles as well as protects the exposed manikin by direct supply of fresh air in the breathing zone. Whether IF of the exposed manikin would decrease or increase depends on the balance of these two factors, one of which is positive and the other is negative. Fig. 9\nillustrates normalized concentration contours of 0.8 \u03bcm particles in the center plane of x-direction under DV based conditions. It was observed that in stratified DV based conditions using RMP for the polluting manikin could increase particle concentrations around the exposed one greatly. The jet of PV airflow at 7 l/s decayed remarkably before it reached the breathing zone of the exposed manikin. Generally the effect of providing a small flow rate of clean personalized air cannot counteract the increment of concentration in the occupied zone. At the flow rate of 15 l/s, the effect of local fresh air supply almost matched the concentration augment caused by the personalized air of the polluting manikin. Therefore, the IF values in case DV50 + P15 + E15 and DV alone in Fig. 7(b) are comparable. The worst situation appeared if RMP for the polluting manikin opened and for the exposed manikin closed.

One manikin acted as a polluting source and the other was exposed. Particle sizes of 0.8 \u03bcm, 5 \u03bcm, and 16 \u03bcm as well as tracer gas were studied. The main conclusions are as follows:1.Concentrations of tracer gas and particles were nearly uniformly distributed in MV. Intensive deposition effect of coarse particles resulted in a lower concentration level than fine particles and tracer gases. Concentration stratification in DV and UFAD was found for tracer gas and particles up to 5 \u03bcm in the current study. As to 16 \u03bcm particles, the stratification phenomenon disappeared.2.For tracer gas and particles smaller than 5 \u03bcm, the intake fraction (IF) of the exposed manikin was almost an order of magnitude higher in MV than in DV and UFAD. Performance of DV was slightly better than UFAD. However, for 16 \u03bcm particles, IFUFAD > IFMV > IFDV. The stirring effect in the lower zone of the room caused by the swirling supply flow may limit the settlement of 16.0 \u03bcm particles and lead to a longer suspension of them.3.For MV based conditions, in present study when the exposed manikin using RMP the inhaled air quality could be improved. Large airflow rate of RMP performed better than small flow rate. For DV and UFAD based conditions, however, PV has the possibility to increase the intake fractions for tracer gas, 0.8 \u03bcm particles, and 5 \u03bcm particles, which is contrary to the original intention to use PV.4.Momentum of personalized air will reduce R\nC of 0.8 \u03bcm and 5 \u03bcm particles for all the three TV systems. Further, PV enhanced mixing degree of particles under DV and UFAD much stronger than under MV. R\nC did not change a lot for all cases when the total PV airflow increased from 14 l/s to 30 l/s. For 16 \u03bcm particles, the effect of promoting mixing by the personalized air was not obvious for all the cases.5.Application of PV can increase C\nA as well as increase f.
