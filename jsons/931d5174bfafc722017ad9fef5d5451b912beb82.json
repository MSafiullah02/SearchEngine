The phylogenetic tree showed that SARS-CoV-2 was 96.2% identical to bat \u03b2-coronaviruses from lineage B. Also, several studies reported that SARS-CoV-2 uses the SARS-CoV receptor, angiotensin-converting enzyme 2, for entry to target cells. Lung alveolar and small intestine are potential targets for SARS-CoV-2 due to the high expression of the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 receptor. In this review, we focused on the zoonotic \u03b2-coronaviruses and given there is no specific drug or vaccine for coronavirus disease 2019, we reviewed the literature on the therapy options for SARS and Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus infection, in order to discover their possible use in the treatment of SARS-CoV-2 infections.",

In 2003, Holmes reported that the sudden emergence of SARS-CoV did not correlate to mutation or recombination between previous HCoV. On the other hand, genome sequencing and epidemiologic reports demonstrated that SARS-CoV was a new virus which was not similar to known HCoV [7] . However, the genome sequences of human SARS-CoV were similar to animal isolates and in addition, several serological studies confirmed that animal traders had specific antibody (IgG) against the SARS-CoV infection. These results displayed that SARS-CoV was a zoonotic virus and originated from animal and bird species before outbreaks in humans [1] . Moreover, in 2006, Li et al. reported that significant genetic changes occurred in the spike glycoprotein (S glycoprotein) of bat SARS-CoV to infect humans. Finally, the sequence data of SARS-CoV exhibited 87-92% identity with bat SARS-CoV and it was concluded bats were the potential natural reservoir for the outbreak of SARS in 2003 [8] . In fact, exotic animals have transmitted SARS-CoV to humans through intermediate hosts (civet cats and raccoon dogs) and subsequently, person-to-person transmission resulted in the outbreak of SARS-CoV in hotels and hospitals [9] .",

Also, MERS is associated with metabolic syndromes including diabetes mellitus, cardiovascular diseases and obesity. Subsequently, metabolic syndrome can interfere with innate and humoral immune and can render patients more susceptible to infectious diseases. DPP4, CD26 is the receptor for attachment of MERS-CoV to the pneumocytes and epithelial cells of the respiratory tract [15] . Moreover, MERS-CoV has a specific RBD that is 231-amino-acid in S glycoprotein and binds to DDP4 on host target cells. DPP4 affects glucose metabolism, T cell activation, cytotoxic modulation, Review cell adhesion and apoptosis. MERS-CoV RBD comprises the core structure and a RBM. Although the core structures of MERS CoV and SARS-CoV RBDs are highly similar, their RBMs are divergent and lead to different receptor specificities. Also, it was supposed that MERS-CoV transmission from bats-to-humans and then from human-to-human occurred through little or no adaptation in RBD [16] .",

Laboratory mice models showed that the ACE2 expression as the receptor of the SARS-CoV-2 decreases with age. Although this result contradicts with low susceptibility of children to SARS-CoV-2 infection, the lung is protected by ACE2 against SARS, influenza A H5N1 virus, respiratory syncytial virus infections. It can be explained that ACE2 in healthy people and children modulates the renin-angiotensin system via cleaving angiotensin (Ang)-II to Ang-1-7 to prevent severe acute lung failure. Indeed, the severe lung injury arising from a viral respiratory infection is associated with ACE2 deficiency and increasing of Ang II [17, 18] .",

Wei Ji et al. using sequence analysis of different species of coronavirus revealed that SARS-CoV-2 is a recombinant virus between the bat coronavirus and a source-unknown coronavirus, but the possible intermediate host of SARS-CoV-2 is the pangolin [11] . So, these results indicate the outbreak in Wuhan city was a zoonosis disease similar to bat SARS [2, 12] . Moreover, the viral genome sequencing confirmed that SARS-CoV-2 is 96.2% identical to some bat coronaviruses and also more distantly correlated to SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV (about 79 and 50%, respectively). Also, the genome sequencing of SARS-CoV-2 S2 protein confirmed the similarity of 93% with bat coronaviruses.",
