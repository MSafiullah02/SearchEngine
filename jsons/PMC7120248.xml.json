Common aspects of care are those directed at the transplanted organ itself, with regard to monitoring and recognition of early dysfunction, initiation of immunosuppression, and management of surgical complications. Close liaison with the multidisciplinary team, which will include the intensivist, transplant surgeon, transplant hepatologist, anesthesiologist, and \u00adradiologist, is required.",

Lactic acidosis, acute renal failure, coagulopathy (including disseminated intravascular coagulation), and sepsis also represent particular problems. Preoperative optimization will usually require invasive cardiovascular monitoring, fluid resuscitation, vasopressor support, continuous renal replacement therapy (RRT), platelet/coagulation support, cerebral monitoring in grade 3 or 4 coma, and in some cases, intracranial pressure monitoring. The decision to commence intracranial pressure monitoring will be taken on an individual basis depending on the degree of clinical suspicion that raised intracranial pressure (ICP) is present or evolving. Factors favoring this decision are young age, markedly raised arterial ammonia (>150 mmol/L), neurological signs such as clonus, pupillary hyporesponsiveness, or dilatation, and the combination of hypertension and bradycardia. A recent analysis of 58 patients in whom intracranial monitoring was undertaken reported radiological evidence of intracranial bleeding in 10%. In two cases, bleeding was felt to have contributed to the patients\u2019 deaths.4Measures to reduce the risk of raised ICP, and to treat it once suspected, are summarized in Table 53.1. ICH remains a critical issue in the early posttransplant period and may be particularly relevant if immediate graft function is suboptimal.\n",

            "text": "The method of organ implantation may have significant consequences in terms of posttransplant care. The conventional method involves removal of the native liver together with a short section of the inferior vena cava (IVC) above and below the organ, followed by implantation of the equivalent anatomy (\u201ccaval interposition\u201d) from the donor (Fig. 53.1). The \u201cpiggyback\u201d method, in which a cuff of the donor\u2019s IVC with the donor liver draining into it through the three hepatic veins is piggybacked onto the recipient\u2019s IVC, avoids cross clamping and transection of the recipient\u2019s IVC. \u201cSplit liver\u201d grafts are used when it is felt that the donor organ is of sufficient size to provide liver tissue to two patients. The lobe is implanted conventionally; however, a cut surface remains that may bleed or leak bile (Fig. 53.2). Another technique, employed in ALF when it is projected that the insult to the native liver will abate and regeneration occur effectively (e.g., acetaminophen toxicity), is to implant a whole or partial graft as an \u201cauxiliary\u201d adjacent to the native liver. Ongoing necrosis of the native liver with release of cytokines and toxins can promote an ongoing inflammatory response. If a straightforward \u201cduct-to-duct\u201d biliary anastomosis is not possible (for instance in patients with primary sclerosing cholangitis [PSC], or those receiving auxiliary transplants), a hepaticojejunostomy and Roux-en-Y jejunal loop may be formed. This intestinal anastomosis requires rest from feeding for up to 5 days postoperatively. In the case of a donor\u2013recipient mismatch in bile duct diameter, or if the anastomosis is difficult, a T-tube may be inserted at the site of the anastomosis, its stem draining bile into a drain through the abdominal wall. Complex or suboptimal arterial anatomy may lead the surgeon to improvise arterial conduits from donor blood vessels (e.g., iliac), and knowledge of this will permit appropriate vascular investigations postoperatively.\n\n",

These are encompassed in the three phases of LT, namely, hepatectomy, anhepatic phase, and reperfusion. During these phases the portal vein and IVC will be clamped, with consequent reduction in venous return to the heart, and de-clamped following implantation, which is associated with further cardiovascular disturbance due to recovery of pre-load and release of vasoactive substances from the donor organ. Additionally, there will be variable blood loss in the context of coagulopathy with the potential for major transfusion. The proximity of the liver and its venous drainage to the right atrium can lead to surgical interventions and complications above the diaphragm.

In the previously cirrhotic patient, right heart dysfunction in the context of pulmonary artery hypertension may need to be excluded (Fig. 53.3a, b). This requires pulmonary artery catheter insertion, which can provide pulmonary artery pressure (PAP), right ventricular end diastolic volume index (RVEDVI), and calculated right ventricular stroke work index (RVSWI).
