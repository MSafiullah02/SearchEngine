After a period of intense testing within several IRGC projects and empirical analysis of its use in different risk contexts and cultural environments, it is anticipated that a further revised version of this White Paper can offer assistance and guidance to senior risk managers and decision makers as well as risk practitioners outside of IRGC in their daily efforts to identify, assess, manage and monitor risk. An important niche could, for instance, derive from the active transfer and dissemination of this body of knowledge to key actors in politics and society in developing countries and those in transition. Many of these countries are only now starting to formally think about issues of risk governance and IRGC's providing them with relevant information and knowledge could provide valuable insights and, possibly, help them to avoid some of the pitfalls inherent in dealing with risk. A flexible yet harmonised framework might also be of benefit to both the government and industry sectors in OECD countries, since its main thrust is to provide logically coherent and sensible guidance for conducting risk appraisals (including risk assessment as well as concern assessment), for steering risk management and for improving risk governance structures in a variety of risk areas and socio-political cultures. Therefore, this document particularly addresses all those actors who will benefit from more direct cooperation with other stakeholders and from integrated risk governance procedures. Indeed, specifying the role of these actors within an integrated framework of risk governance is one of the main goals of IRGC, and this goal has also inspired the framework presented in this document. While it is clear that each risk field or 'case' under consideration is different in that it requires further specifications and adjustments, it is nonetheless hoped that the framework presented herein can serve as a 'default option' from which one can and should deviate if necessary.",

Risk is understood in this document as an uncertain consequence of an event or an activity with respect to something that humans value (definition originally in: Kates et al. 1985: 21) . Risks always refer to a combination of two components: the likelihood or chance of potential consequences and the severity of consequences of human activities, natural events or a combination of both. Such consequences can be positive or negative, depending on the values that people associate with them. IRGC is not covering all risk areas but confines its efforts to (predominantly negatively evaluated) risks that lead to physical consequences in terms of human life, health, and the natural and built environment. It also addresses impacts on financial assets, economic investments, social institutions, cultural heritage or psychological well-being as long as these impacts are associated with the physical consequences. 2 In addition to the strength and likelihood of these consequences, the framework emphasises the distribution of risks over time, space and populations. In particular, the timescale of appearance of adverse effects is very important and links risk governance to sustainable development (delayed effects).",

These potentials may never even materialise if, for example, people are not exposed to the hazards or if the targets are made resilient against the hazardous effect (such as immunisation). In conceptual terms, hazards characterise the inherent properties of the risk agent and related processes, whereas risks describe the potential effects that these hazards are likely to cause on specific targets such as buildings, ecosystems or human organisms and their related probabilities. Table 1 provides a systematic overview of the sources of risks or hazards that potentially fall within the scope of IRGC's work programme. The purpose of this overview is to lay out the variety of sources of risks rather than to claim that the categories proposed are exhaustive or mutually exclusive (see review of classification in Morgan et al. 2000) . Furthermore, IRGC places most attention on risk areas of global relevance (i.e. transboundary, international and ubiquitous risks) which additionally include large-scale effects (including low-probability, high-consequence outcomes), require multiple stakeholder involvement, lack a superior decisionmaking authority and involve the potential to cause wide-ranging concerns and outrage.",

This term denotes the embeddedness of any risk to human health and the environment in a larger context of social, financial and economic consequences and increased interdependencies both across risks and between their various backgrounds. Systemic risks are at the crossroads between natural events (partially altered and amplified by human action such as the emission of greenhouse gases), economic, social and technological developments and policy-driven actions, both at the domestic and the international level. These new interrelated and interdependent risk fields also require a new form of handling risk, in which data from different risk sources are either geographically or functionally integrated into one analytical perspective. Handling systemic risks requires a holistic approach to hazard identification, risk assessment, concern assessment, tolerability/acceptability judgements and risk management. Investigating systemic risks goes beyond the usual agent-consequence analysis and focuses on interdependencies and spill-overs between risk clusters.",

These transformations are performed with a purpose in mind (normally a benefit to those who initiate them). When implementing these changes, intended (or tolerated) and unintended consequences may occur that meet or violate other dimensions of what humans value. Risks are not taken for their own sake; rather more they are, actively or passively, incurred because of their being an integral factor in the very activity that is geared towards achieving the particular human need or purpose. In this context, it is the major task of risk assessment to identify and explore, preferably in quantitative terms, the types, intensities and likelihood of the (normally undesired) consequences related to a risk. In addition, these consequences are associated with special concerns that individuals, social groups or different cultures may attribute to these risks. They also need to be assessed for making a prudent judgement about the tolerability or acceptability of risks. Once that judgement is made, it is the task of risk management to prevent, reduce or alter these consequences by choosing appro- priate actions. As obvious as this distinction between risk and concern assessment (as a tool of gaining knowledge about risks) and risk management (as a tool for handling risks) appears at first glance, the distinction becomes blurred in the actual risk governance process. This blurring is due to the fact that assessment starts with the respective risk agent or source and tries to both identify potential damage scenarios and their probabilities and to model its potential consequences over time and space, whereas risk management oversees a much larger terrain of potential interventions (Stern and Fineberg 1996; Jasanoff 1986: 79f; . Risk management may alter human wants or needs (so that the agent is not even created or continued). It can suggest substitutes or alternatives for the same need. It can relocate or isolate activities so that exposure is prevented, or it can make risk targets less vulnerable to potential harm. Figure  1 illustrates this larger perspective for technological risks and lists the possible intervention points for risk management (taken from Hohenemser et al. 1983) . Risk assessment and management are therefore not symmetrical to each other: management encompasses a much larger domain and may even occur before assessments are performed. It is often based on considerations that are not affected by or part of the assessment results. In more general terms, risk management refers to the creation and evaluation of options for initiating or changing human activities or (natural and artificial) structures with the objective being to increase the net benefit to human society and prevent harm to humans and what they value. The identification of these options and their evaluation is guided by systematic and experiential knowledge gained and prepared for this purpose by experts and stakeholders. A major proportion of that relevant knowledge comprises the results of risk assessments. However, risk managers also need to act in situations of 'non-knowledge' or insufficient knowledge about potential outcomes of human actions or activities.",

In addition to knowledge gained through risk assessments and/or option generation and evaluation through risk management, the decision-making structure of a society is itself highly complicated and often fragmented. Apart from the structure itself -the people and organisations that share responsibility for assessing and managing risk -one must also consider the need for sufficient organisational capacity to create the necessary knowledge and implement the required actions, the political and cultural norms, rules and values within a particular societal context and the subjective perceptions of individuals and groups. These factors leave their marks on the way risks are treated in different domains and socio-political cultures. To place risk within a context of -sometimes closely interwoven -decision-making structures such as those prevalent in governments and related authorities, in the corporate sector and industry, in the scientific community and in other stakeholder groups is of central concern to IRGC.",

Governing choices in modern societies is seen as an interplay between governmental institutions, economic forces and civil society actors (such as NGOs). At the global level, governance embodies a horizontally organised structure of functional self-regulation encompassing state and non-state actors bringing about collectively binding decisions without superior authority (cf. Rosenau 1992; Wolf 2002) . In this perspective non-state actors play an increasingly relevant role and become more important, since they have decisive advantages of information and resources compared to single states.",

Encompassing the combined risk-relevant decisions and actions of both governmental and private actors, risk governance is of particular importance in, but not restricted to, situations where there is no single authority to take a binding risk management decision but where, instead, the nature of the risk requires the collaboration of, and co-ordination between, a range of different stakeholders. Risk governance however not only includes a multifaceted, multi-actor risk process but also calls for the consideration of contextual factors such as institutional arrangements (e.g. the regulatory and legal framework that determines the relationship, roles and responsibilities of the actors and co-ordination mechanisms such as markets, incentives or self-imposed norms) and political culture, including different perceptions of risk.",

Actors, however, creatively arrange and reassemble signals that they get from the 'real world' providing structure and guidance to an ongoing process of reality enactment. 5 So risks represent what people observe in reality and what they experience. The link between risk as a mental concept and reality is forged through the experience of actual harm (the consequence of risk) in the sense that human lives are lost, health impacts can be observed, the environment is damaged or buildings collapse. The invention of risk as a mental construct is contingent on the belief that human action can prevent harm in advance. Humans have the ability to design different futures, i.e. construct scenarios that serve as tools for the human mind to anticipate consequences in advance and change, within constraints of nature and culture, the course of actions accordingly. The status of risk as a mental construct has major implications on how risk is looked at. Unlike trees or houses, one cannot scan the environment, identify the objects of interest, and count them. Risks are created and selected by human actors. What counts as a risk to someone may be an act of God to someone else or even an opportunity for a third party. Although societies have over time gained experience and collective knowledge of the potential impacts of events and activities, one cannot anticipate all potential scenarios and be worried about all the many potential consequences of a proposed activity or an expected event. By the same token, it is impossible to include all possible options for intervention. Therefore societies have been selective in what they have chosen to be worth considering and what to ignore (Thompson et al. 1990; Douglas 1990; Beck 1994: 9ff.) . Specialised organisations have been established to monitor the environment for hints of future problems and to provide early warning of some potential future harm. This selection process is not arbitrary. It is guided by cultural values (such as the shared belief that each individual life is worth protecting), by institutional and financial resources (such as the decision of national governments to spend money or not to spend money on early warning systems against highly improbable but high-consequence events) and by systematic reasoning (such as using probability theory for distinguishing between more likely and less likely events or methods to estimate damage potential or distribution of hazards in time and space).",

            "text": "Based on these preliminary thoughts, a systematic review of risk-related actions needs to start with an analysis of what major societal actors such as e.g. governments, companies, the scientific community and the general public select as risks that this White Paper takes no stand on the controversial issue of constructivism versus realism of evidence and values (this topic is extensively reviewed in Mayo and Hollander 1991, specific positions in Bradbury 1989; Douglas 1990; Shrader-Frechette 1991b; Wynne 1992; Laudan 1996; Jasanoff 2004) . Whether the evidence collected represents human ideas about reality or depicts representations of reality is of no importance for the distinction between evidence and values that is suggested throughout the document. Handling risks will inevitably be directed by evidence claims (what are the causes and what are the effects?) and normative claims (what is good, acceptable and tolerable?). It is true that providing evidence is always contingent on existing normative axioms and social conventions. Likewise, normative positions are always enlightened by assumptions about reality (Ravetz 1999) . The fact that evidence is never value-free and that values are never void of assumptions about evidence does not compromise the need for a functional distinction between the two. For handling risks one is forced to distinguish between what is likely to be expected when selecting option x rather than option y, on one hand, and what is more desirable or tolerable: the consequences of option x or option y, on the other hand. It is hence highly advisable to maintain the classic distinction between evidence and values and also to affirm that justifying claims for evidence versus values involves different routes of legitimisation and validation. and what types of problems they label as risk problems (rather than opportunities or innovation potentials, etc.). In technical terms this is called 'framing'. Framing in this context encompasses the selection and interpretation of phenomena as relevant risk topics (Tversky and Kahneman 1981; van der Sluijs et al. 2003; Goodwin and Wright 2004) . The process of framing is already part of the governance structure since official agencies (for example food standard agencies), risk and opportunity producers (such as the food industry), those affected by risks and opportunities (such as consumer organisations) and interested bystanders (such as the media or an intellectual elite) are all involved and often in conflict with each other when framing the issue. What counts as risk may vary among these actor groups. Consumers may feel that all artificial food additives pose a risk, whereas industry may be concerned about pathogens that develop their negative potential due to the lack of consumer knowledge about food storage and preparation. Environmental groups may be concerned with the risks of industrial food versus organic food. Whether a consensus evolves about what requires consideration as a relevant risk depends on the legitimacy of the selection rule. The acceptance of selection rules rests on two conditions: first, all actors need to agree with the underlying goal (often legally prescribed, such as prevention of health detriments, or guarantee of an undisturbed environmental quality, for example purity laws for drinking water); secondly, they need to agree with the implications derived from the present state of knowledge (whether and to what degree the identified hazard impacts the desired goal). Even within this preliminary analysis, dissent can result from conflicting values as well as conflicting evidence, and, in particular, from the inadequate blending of the two. Values and evidence can be viewed as the two sides of a coin: the values govern the selection of the goal whereas the evidence governs the selection of cause-effect claims. Both need to be properly investigated when analysing risk governance but it is of particular importance to understand the values shaping the interests, perceptions and concerns of the different stakeholders as well as to identify methods for capturing how these concerns are likely to influence, or impact on, the debate about a particular risk. The actual measurements of these impacts should then be done in the most professional manner, including the characterisation of uncertainties (Keeney 1992; Pidgeon and Gregory 2004; Gregory 2004) .",

Even if there is a common agreement of what should be framed as (a) risk issue(s), there may be problems in monitoring the environment for signals of risks. This is often due to a lack of institutional efforts to collect and interpret signs of risk and deficiencies in communication between those looking for early signs and those acting upon them. The recent tsunami catastrophe in Asia provides a more than telling example of the discrepancy between the capability to have early warning systems and the decision to install or use them.

Public risk regulators often use pre-screening activities to allocate risks to different agencies or to pre-defined procedures. Sometimes risks may seem to be less severe and it may be adequate to cut short risk or concern assessment. In a pending crisis situation, risk management actions may need to be taken before any assessment is even carried out. A full analysis should therefore include provisions for risk screening and the selection of different routes for risk assessment, concern assessment and risk management. This aspect has been called 'risk assessment policy' in the Codex Alimentarius. It is meant to guide the assessment process in terms of assessment and management protocols, methods of investigation, statistical procedures and other scientific conventions used in assessing risks or selecting risk reduction options. A screening process may also be employed when characterising risks according to complexity, uncertainty and ambiguity as we will explain later.",

Correspondingly, identification (i.e. establishing cause-effect link) and estimation (determining the strength of the cause-effect link) need to be performed for hazards and risks separately. The estimation of risk depends on an exposure and/or vulnerability assessment. Exposure refers to the contact of the hazardous agent with the target (individuals, ecosystems, buildings, etc.).Vulnerability describes the various degrees of the target to experience harm or damage as a result of the exposure (for example: immune system of target population, vulnerable groups, structural deficiencies in buildings, etc.). In many cases it is common practice to combine hazard and risk estimates in scenarios that allow modellers to change parameters and include different sets of context constraints. The basis of risk assessment is the systematic use of analytical -largely probability-based -methods which have been constantly improved over the past years. Probabilistic risk assessments for large technological systems, for instance, include tools such as fault and event trees, scenario techniques, distribution models based on Geographic Information Systems (GIS), transportation modelling and empirically driven human-machine interface simulations (IAEA 1995; Stricoff 1995) . With respect to human health, improved methods of modelling inter-individual variation (Hattis 2004) , dose-response relationships (Olin et al. 1995) and exposure assessments (USEPA 1997) have been developed and successfully applied. The processing of data is often guided by inferential statistics and organised in line with decision analytic procedures. These tools have been developed to generate knowledge about cause-effect relationships, estimate the strength of these relationships, characterise remaining uncertainties and ambiguities and describe, in quantitative or qualitative form, other risk or hazard related properties that are important for risk management (IAEA 1995; IEC 1993) . In short, risk assessments specify what is at stake, calculate the probabilities for (un)wanted consequences, and aggregate both components into a single dimension (Kolluru 1995: 2.3f ). In general, there are five methods for calculating probabilities:",

The possibility that the circumstances of the risk situation vary over time in an unforeseeable way and that people will thus make decisions in relation to changing hazards -sometimes they may even change in an unsystematic, unpredictable manner -leads to unresolved or remaining uncertainty (second order uncertainty). One of the main challenges of risk assessment is the systematic characterisation of these remaining uncertainties. They can partly be modelled by using inferential statistics (confidence interval) or other simulation methods (such as Monte Carlo), but often they can only be described in qualitative terms. Risk analysts consequently distinguish between aleatory and epistemic un-certainty: epistemic uncertainty can be reduced by more scientific research 8 while aleatory uncertainty will remain fuzzy regardless of how much research is invested in the subject (Shome et al. 1998 ). Remaining uncertainties pose major problems in the later stages of risk characterisation and evaluation as well as risk management since they are difficult to integrate in formal risk-benefit analyses or in setting standards.",

These three challenges are not related to the intrinsic characteristics of hazards or risks themselves but to the state and quality of knowledge available about both hazards and risks. Since risks are mental constructs, the quality of their explanatory power depends on the accuracy and validity of their (real) predictions. Unlike some other scientific constructs, validating the results of risk assessments is particularly difficult because, in theory, one would need to wait indefinitely to prove that the probabilities assigned to a specific outcome were correctly assessed. If the number of predicted events is frequent and the causal chain obvious (as is the case with car accidents), validation is relatively simple and straightforward. If, however, the assessment focuses on risks where cause-effect relationships are difficult to discern, where effects are rare and/or difficult to interpret, and where variations in both causes and effects are obscuring the results, the validation of the assessment results becomes a major problem. In such instances, assessment procedures are needed to characterise the existing knowledge with respect to complexity, remaining uncertainties and ambiguities (WBGU 2000, 195ff .; Klinke and Renn 2002) .",

The term 'ambiguity' may be misleading because it has different connotations in everyday English language. 9 In relation to risk governance it is understood as 'giving rise to several meaningful and legitimate interpretations of accepted risk assessments results'. It can be divided into interpretative ambiguity (different interpretations of an identical assessment result: e.g. as an adverse or non-adverse effect) and normative ambiguity (different concepts of what can be regarded as tolerable referring e.g. to ethics, quality of life parameters, distribution of risks and benefits, etc.). A condition of ambiguity emerges where the problem lies in agreeing on the appropriate values, priorities, assumptions, or boundaries to be applied to the definition of possible outcomes. What does it mean, for example, if neuronal activities in the human brain are intensified when subjects are exposed to electromagnetic radiation? Can this be interpreted as an adverse effect or is it just a bodily response without any health implication? Many scientific disputes in the fields of risk assessment and management do not refer to differences in methodology, measurements or doseresponse functions, but to the question of what all of this means for human health and environmental protection. High complexity and uncertainty favour the emergence of ambiguity, but there are also quite a few simple and highly probable risks that can cause controversy and thus ambiguity. Examples for high interpretative ambiguity include low dose radiation (ionising and non-ionising), low concentrations of genotoxic substances, food supplements and hormone treatment of cattle. Normative ambiguities can be associated, for example, with pass-ive smoking, nuclear power, pre-natal genetic screening and genetically modified food.",

            "text": "Since risk is a mental construct there are a wide variety of construction principles for conceptualising risk. Different disciplines within the natural and social sciences have formed their own concepts of risk; stakeholder groups, driven by interest and experience, have developed their specific perspective on risk; and, last but not least, representatives of civil society as well as the general public are responding to risks according to their own risk constructs and images. These images are called 'perceptions' in the psychological and social sciences and they have been intensely researched in relation to risk -as have their underlying factors (Covello 1983; Slovic 1987; Boholm 1998; Rohrmann and Renn 2000) . Risk perceptions belong to the contextual aspects that risk managers need to consider when deciding whether or not a risk should be taken as well as when designing risk reduction measures. First of all it is highly important to know that human behaviour is primarily driven by perception and not by facts or by what is understood as facts by risk analysts and scientists. Most cognitive psychologists believe that perceptions are formed by common sense reasoning, personal experience, social communication and cultural traditions (Brehmer 1987; Drottz-Sj\u00f6berg 1991; Pidgeon et al. 1992; Pidgeon 1998) . In relation to risk it has been shown that humans link certain expectations, ideas, hopes, fears and emotions with activities or events that have uncertain consequences. People do, however, not use completely irrational strategies to assess information, but, most of the time, follow relatively consistent patterns of creating images of risks and evaluating them. These patterns are related to certain evolutionary bases of coping with dangerous situations. Faced with an eminent threat, humans react with four basic strategies: flight, fight, play dead and, if appropriate, experimentation (on the basis of trial and error).",

Here, psychologists differentiate between two classes of qualitative perception patterns: on the one hand risk-related patterns, which are based on the properties of the source of risk; on the other hand situation-related patterns, based on the idiosyncrasies of the risky situation (Fischhoff et al. 1978; Slovic 1987 Slovic , 1992 .",

When faced with a new risk or when obtaining new information about a risk, most people try to file this new information into one of the existing drawers. 10 In addition to the cognitive processing of risk characteristics and risk situations, studies have shown that people tend to stigmatise risk sources that are associated with specific dreadful associations (Kunreuther and Heal 2003) . A salient example of stigma is the reaction to products that are deemed to be carcinogenic, although there is often limited, if any, scientific evidence to support this position. The mere suspicion that a substance could cause cancer is often sufficient for generating fear and asking for strict regulatory actions. Stigmatisation leads to a cycle of public outrage and regulatory responses feeding into the process that has been described as social amplification of risk (Kasperson et al. 1988 (Kasperson et al. , 2003 . Stimulated by media reporting, the public's perception of the risk is often amplified in ways that are difficult to explain if one were focusing on the standard elements of any technical risk assessment -probability and direct losses. The problems associated with risk perception are compounded because of the difficulty individuals have in interpreting low probabilities when making their decisions (Kunreuther et al. 2001 ). In fact, there is evidence that people may not even want data on the likelihood of an event occurring. If people do not think probabilistically, how do they make their choices? Psychological research has revealed the following patterns of drawing inferences about probabilities and risks (Tversky and Kahneman 1974; Ross 1977; Kahneman and Tversky 1979; Renn 2004a ):",

These factors are particularly relevant when individuals face a decision that involves a difficult trade-off between attributes or where there is interpretative ambiguity as to what constitutes a 'right' answer.

The first position states that the scientific concepts of risk are the only ones that can claim inter-subjective validity and applicability and, therefore, requires risk managers to obtain an assurance that (erroneous) risk perceptions are corrected via risk communication and education (Cross 1998; Coglianese 1999) . The second position states that there is no overarching universally applicable quality criterion available in order to evaluate the appropriateness or validity of risk concepts. As a result, scientific concepts (often called narratives in this school of thought) should compete with concepts of stakeholders and public groups (Liberatore and Funtowicz 2003) .

IRGC advocates an approach by which the elements of what matters to the different groups when they conceptualise risk should be regarded as equally legitimate factors for inclusion within risk governance (see also Gigerenzer and Selten 2001) . This implies, for example, that if people are willing to accept higher risks when they are in control of them, then this preference cannot be de-legitimised by professional economists who favour cost-effectiveness studies that treat all risks equally. In identifying aspects of concern and worry all groups in society have the same right to raise them and to bring them to the negotiation table. However, the question of the degree to which these concerns are met or violated by risk-bearing activities or events should be primarily answered by those who have the knowledge, skills and/or the experience to measure or estimate the strength of relationships between cause (or dose) and effect. It seems wrong to give equal standing to those who intuitively estimate risks and those who assess risks on the basis of systematic observation, empirical data collection and rigorous modelling, just as it seems wrong to dismiss non-factual perceptions purely because they appear irrational to those with expert knowledge. This said, IRGC wishes to emphasise that the proposed quality distinction between intuition and systematic knowledge does not predetermine a position in the philosophical debate on realism versus constructivism; the argument here is strictly focused on the structure and content of knowledge claims, not on claims about reality representation. 11 This position has major impacts on risk policy making and communication. Policy making needs to, inter alia, organise systematic feedback from society and, equally, to include risk perceptions as an important input to deciding on whether something should be done about a certain risk and, if so, what (Jaeger et al. 2001) . How this can be accomplished is explained in the next section on risk appraisal. Risk communication is also affected, in two ways: first, it is bound to elicit, and enable the exchange of, concerns and conceptual aspects of risk among and between all relevant actors, and, second, risk managers are well advised to ensure that the best available knowledge is widely distributed to those who raise these concerns.",

For society to make prudent choices about risks, it is not enough to consider only the results of (scientific) risk assessment. In order to understand the concerns of the various stakeholders and public groups, information about both risk perceptions and the further implications of the direct consequences of a risk -including its social mobilisation potential (i.e. how likely is it that the activity will give rise to social opposition or protest?) -is needed and should be collected by risk management agents. In addition, other aspects of the risk causing activity that seem to be relevant for characterising and evaluating the risk and selecting risk reduction options should be pulled together and fed into the analysis. Based on such a wide range of information, risk managers can make more informed judgements and design the appropriate risk management options (Clark 2001) .",

The appraisal process is and should be clearly dominated by scientific analyses -but, in contrast to the traditional risk governance model, the scientific process includes both the natural/technical as well as the social sciences, including economics. We envision risk appraisal as having two process stages: first, natural and technical scientists use their skills to produce the best estimate of the physical harm that a risk source may induce (as described in the chapter on risk assessment); secondly, social scientists and economists identify and analyse the issues that individuals or society as a whole link with a certain risk.

Of particular interest in this context are financial and legal implications, i.e. economic losses and liabilities, as well as social responses such as political mobilisation. These secondary implications have been addressed by the concept of social amplification of risk (Kasperson et al. 2001 (Kasperson et al. , 2003 . This concept is based on the hypothesis that events pertaining to hazards interact with psychological, social, institutional, and cultural processes in ways that can heighten or attenuate individual and social perceptions of risk and shape risk behaviour. Behavioural patterns, in turn, generate secondary social or economic consequences that extend far beyond direct harm to human health or the environment, including significant indirect impacts such as liability, insurance costs, loss of confidence in institutions, or alienation from community affairs (Burns et al. 1993) . Such amplified secondary effects can then trigger demands for additional institutional responses and protective actions, or, conversely (in the case of risk attenuation), place impediments in the path of needed protective actions. Secondary impacts, whether amplified or not, are of major concern to those who are obliged to take over the costs or cope with the consequences of being accountable.",

The term 'tolerable' refers to an activity that is seen as worth pursuing (for the benefit it carries) yet it requires additional efforts for risk reduction within reasonable limits. The term 'acceptable' refers to an activity where the remaining risks are so low that additional efforts for risk reduction are not seen as necessary. For purely natural hazards the two terms appear at first glance to be meaningless, since humans have no choice in tolerating or accepting these risks. Human activities, however, do influence the impact of natural hazards through changes in vulnerability and exposure options (such as building codes or zoning laws). Looking into the resulting risks as a function of vulnerabilities, a judgement on tolerability and acceptability with respect to the selection of protective measures becomes meaningful again. The distinction between tolerability and acceptability can thus be applied to a large array of risk sources. If tolerability and acceptability are located in a risk diagram (with probabilities on the y-axis and extent of consequences on the x-axis), the well-known traffic light model emerges 14 (Figure 2 ). In this variant of the model the red zone signifies intolerable risk, the yellow one indicates tolerable risk in need of further management actions (in accordance with the 'as low as reasonably possible' -ALARP -principle) and the green zone shows acceptable or even negligible risk.",

In those cases where there is unanimous agreement about the underlying values and even the threshold of what is regarded as tolerable or acceptable, evidence in the form of risk estimates may be sufficient to locate the risk within the traffic light diagram. A judgement can then best be made by those who have most expertise in risk and concern assessments, in which case it makes sense to place this task within the domain of risk appraisal. The judgement will thus be based on best scientific modelling of epistemic uncertainties and the best qualitative characterisation of aleatory uncertainties. Characterisation also includes an analysis of the concerns associated with different outcomes and the likely secondary implications. It will be helpful for risk managers to receive best expert advice on potentially effective risk reduction measures and other management options that may lead to satisfactory results. It is, however, not the task of the risk appraisal team to make a selection of options, let alone decide on which option should be implemented.",

It is not uncommon for the public to hear expert 1 say that there is 'nothing to worry about regarding a particular risk' while at the same time learning from expert 2 that 'this risk should be on your radar screen'. One way to capture these discrepancies in risk interpretations is to construct an exceedance probability (EP) curve (Grossi and Kunreuther 2005 ). An EP curve specifies the probabilities that certain level of losses will be exceeded. The losses can be measured in terms of dollars of damage, fatalities, illness or some other unit of analysis.",

Science is very familiar with these risks and there is little uncertainty and interpretative ambiguity about dose-effect relationships. Yet there is considerable debate whether smoking is tolerable or not. Being a voluntary activity some countries leave it to the decision of each consumer while others initiate major activities to reduce and even ban smoking. Another example is wearing helmets on bicycles. The statistical data on this subject is rather straightforward; there are no major uncertainties or interpretative ambiguities. Yet many countries do dot want to impinge on the freedom of each cyclist to personally decide whether or not to wear a helmet, while other countries pursue a more paternalistic policy.",

A good example for this third case may be the interpretative and normative implications of global climate change. An international expert group such as the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) has gone through considerable effort to articulate a common characterisation of climatic risks and their uncertainties.

Risk characterisation includes tasks such as point estimates of risks, descriptions of remaining uncertainties (as undertaken for instance in climate change models or risk studies on endocrine disruptors) and potential outcome scenarios including the social and economic implications, suggestions for safety factors to include inter-target variation, assurance of compatibility with legal prescriptions, risk-risk comparisons, risk-risk trade-offs, identification of discrepancies between risk assessment and risk perceptions as well as of potential equity violations, and suggestions for reasonable standards to meet legal requirements (Stern and Fineberg 1996) . The evidence collected and summarised here goes beyond the classic natural science reservoir of knowledge and includes economic and social science expertise. This is also the reason why in the process of risk characterisation an interdisciplinary team of scientists is needed to draw a complete picture of what is known and what is and may remain unknown. In the course of risk characterisation, scientists are asked to design a multi-criteria profile of the risk in question, make a judgement about the seriousness of the risk and suggest potential options to deal with the risk.",

The degree of controversy is one of the drivers for selecting the appropriate instruments for risk prevention or risk reduction. For a systematic analysis of the risk management process it is advisable to focus on tolerable risks and those where tolerability is disputed, for the other cases are fairly easy to deal with. In the case of intolerable risks -and often in the case of tolerable but highly disputed risks -risk managers should opt for prevention strategies as a means to replace the hazardous activity with another activity leading to identical and similar benefits. One should first make sure, however, that the replacement does not introduce more risks or more uncertainties than the agent that it replaces (Graham and Wiener, 1995; Wiener 1998 ). In the case of acceptable risks it should be left to private actors to initiate additional risk reduction or to seek insur-ance for covering potential but acceptable losses (although this does not eliminate the need for all concerned to have sufficient information and resources to do so). If risks are classified as tolerable, or if there is dispute as to whether they are tolerable or acceptable, risk management needs to design and implement actions that make these risks acceptable over time. Should this not be feasible then risk management, aided by communication, needs at least to credibly convey the message that major effort is undertaken to bring these risks closer to being acceptable. This task can be described in terms of classic decision theory, i.e. in the following steps (Morgan 1990; Keeney 1992; Hammond et al. 1999 ):",

Data is provided by statistical analysis, goals are determined by law or statutory requirements and the role of risk management is to ensure that all risk reduction measures are implemented and enforced. Traditional risk-risk comparisons (or risk-risk trade-offs), risk-benefit analysis and cost-effectiveness studies are the instruments of choice for finding the most appropriate risk reduction measures. Additionally, risk managers can rely on best practice and, in cases of low impact, on trial and error. It should be noted, however, that simple risks should not be equated with small or negligible risks. The major issues here are that the potential negative consequences are obvious, the values that are applied are non-controversial and the remaining uncertainties low.

If input variables to decision-making can be properly defined and affirmed, risk characterisation and evaluation can be done on the basis of risk-benefit balancing and normative standard setting (risk-based/risk-informed regulation).

Addressing complex structures of risk agents requires methods for improving causal modelling and data quality control. With respect to risk absorbing systems the emphasis is on the improvement of robustness 15 in responding to whatever the target is going to be exposed to. Measures to improve robustness include inserting conservatisms or safety factors as an assurance against individual variation (normally a factor of 10-100 for occupational risk exposure and 100-1000 for public risk exposure), introducing redundant and diverse safety 15 The terms robustness and resilience have different meanings in different contexts. In most of the natural hazard literature, robustness is one of the main components of resilience. In much of the cybernetic literature, robustness refers to the insensitivity of numerical results to small changes, while resilience characterises the insensitivity of the entire system against surprises. Our suggestion for distinguishing the two comes close to the cybernetic use of the terms. 38 efforts lead to an acknowledgement of wide margins of uncertainty, the man-devices to improve structures against multiple stress situations, reducing the susceptibility of the target organism (example: iodine tablets for radiation protection), establishing building codes and zoning laws to protect against natural hazards as well as improving the organisational capability to initiate, enforce, monitor and revise management actions (high reliability, learning organisations).",

According to IRGC, the management of risks characterised by multiple and high uncertainties should be guided by the precautionary approach. Since high unresolved uncertainty implies that the (true) dimensions of the risks are not (yet) known, one should pursue a cautious strategy that allows learning by restricted errors. The main management philosophy for this risk class is to allow small steps in implementation (containment approach) that enable risk managers to stop or even reverse the process as new knowledge is produced or the negative side effects become visible. The primary thrust of precaution is to avoid irreversibility (Klinke and Renn 2002) . 16 With respect to risk absorbing systems, the main objective is to make these systems resilient so they can withstand or even tolerate surprises. In contrast to robustness, where potential threats are known in advance and the absorbing system needs to be prepared to face these threats, resilience is a protective strategy against unknown or highly uncertain hazards. Instruments for resilience include the strengthening of the immune system, diversification of the means for approaching identical or similar ends, reduction of the overall catastrophic potential or vulnerability even in the absence of a concrete threat, design of systems with flexible response options and the improvement of conditions for emergency management and system adaptation. Robustness and resilience are closely linked but they are not identical and require partially different types of actions and instruments. Genetically modified organisms for agricultural purposes may serve as an example to illustrate the intricacies related to ambiguity. Surveys on the subject demonstrate that people associate high risks with the application of gene technology for social and moral reasons (Hampel and Renn 2000) . Whether the benefits to the economy balance the costs to society in terms of increased health risks, was not mentioned as a major concern of the polled public.",

In the context of terrorism, the risks faced by any given airline, for example, are affected by lax security at other carriers or airports. There are myriad settings that demonstrate similar interdependencies, including many problems in computer and network security, corporate governance, investment in research, and vaccination. Because interdependence does not require proximity, the antecedents to catastrophes can be The more interdependencies there are within a particular setting (be this a set of organisational units, companies, a geographical area or a number of countries, etc.) and the more that this setting's entities -or participants -decide not to invest in risk reduction while being able to contaminate other entities, the less incentive each potentially affected participant will have to invest in protection. At the same time, however, each participant would have been better off had all the other participants invested in risk-reducing measures. In other words, weak links may lead to suboptimal behaviour by everyone. 17 For situations in which participants are reluctant to adopt protective measures to reduce the chances of catastrophic losses due to the possibility of contamination from weak links in the system, a solution might be found in a public-private partnership. This is particularly true if the risks to be dealt with are associated with competing interpretations (ambiguities) as to what type of co-operation is required between different epistemic communities as well as risk management agencies in order to deal with various knowledge and competing value claims.

Indeed, it equally shifts the locus of decision-making from the government regulatory authority to private companies which are as a result required to do their own planning as to how they will meet a set of standards or regulations (Coglianese and Lazer 2003) . This, in turn, can enable companies to choose those means and measures which are most fit for purpose within their specific environment and, eventually, may lead to a superior allocation of resources compared to more top-down forms of regulation. The combination of third party inspections in conjunction with private insurance is consequently a powerful combination of public oversight and market mechanisms that can convince many companies of the advantages of implementing the necessary measures to make their plants safer and encourage the remaining ones to comply with the regulation to avoid being caught and prosecuted.",

First and foremost this means that the four major actors in risk decision making, i.e. political, business, scientific and civil society players, should jointly engage in the process of framing the problem, generating options, evaluating options, and coming to a joint conclusion. This has also been the main recommendation of the EU White Paper on European Governance (EU 2001a) . This document endorses transparency and accountability through formal consultation with multiple actors as a means for the European Union to address the various frames of governance issues and to identify culture-sensitive responses to common challenges and problems. Similarly to the actors determining the governance of a political union, it is obvious that the actors participating in risk-related decision-making are guided by particular interests which derive not only from the fact that some of them are risk producers -whereas others are exposed to it -but, equally, from their individual institutional rationale and perspective. Such vested interests require specific consideration and measures so that they are made transparent and, if possible, can be reconciled. Inclusive governance, as it relates to the inclusion part of decision-making, requires that (Trustnet 1999; Webler 1999; Wynne 2002) :",

It is essential to monitor these processes and make sure that particular interests do not dominate the deliberations and that rules can be established and jointly approved to prevent destructive strategising. Inclusive governance needs to address the second part of the decision-making process as well, i.e. reaching closure on a set of options that are selected for further consideration, while others are rejected. Closure does not mean to have the final word on a development, a risk reduction plan or a regulation. Rather, it represents the product of a deliberation, i.e. the agreement that the participants reached. The problem is that the more actors, viewpoints, interests and values are included and thus represented in an arena, the more difficult it is to reach either a consensus or some other kind of joint agreement. A second set of criteria is thus needed, to evaluate the process by which closure of debates (be they final or temporary) is brought forth as well as the quality of the decision or recommendation that is generated through the closure procedure.",

How can one judge the severity of a situation when the potential damage and its probability are unknown or highly uncertain? In this dilemma, risk managers are well advised to include the main stakeholders in the evaluation process and ask them to find a consensus on the extra margin of safety in which they would be willing to invest in exchange for avoiding potentially catastrophic consequences. This type of deliberation called 'reflective discourse' relies on a collective reflection about balancing the possibilities for over-and under-protection. If too much protection is sought, innovations may be prevented or stalled; if we go for too little protection, society may experience unpleasant surprises. The classic question of 'how safe is safe enough' is replaced by the question of 'how much uncertainty and ignorance are the main actors willing to accept in exchange for some given benefit'. It is recommended that policy makers, representatives of major stakeholder groups, and scientists take part in this type of discourse. The reflective discourse can take different forms: round tables, open space forums, negotiated rule-making exercises, mediation or mixed advisory committees including scientists and stakeholders (Amy 1983; Perrit 1986; Rowe and Frewer 2000) .",

In these cases the process of risk evaluation needs to be open to public input and new forms of deliberation. This starts with revisiting the question of proper framing. Is the issue really a risk problem or is it in fact an issue of lifestyle and future vision? The aim is to find consensus on the dimensions of ambiguity that need to be addressed in comparing risks and benefits and balancing the pros and cons. High ambiguities require the most inclusive strategy for participation since not only directly affected groups but also those indirectly affected have something to contribute to this debate. Resolving ambiguities in risk debates requires a 'participative discourse', a platform where competing arguments, beliefs and values are openly discussed. The opportunity for resolving these conflicting expectations lies in the process of identifying common values, defining options that allow people to live their own vision of a 'good life' without compromising the vision of others, to find equitable and just distribution rules when it comes to common resources and to activate institutional means for reaching common welfare so all can reap the collective benefits instead of a few (coping with the classic commoners' dilemma). 18 Available sets of deliberative processes include citizen panels, citizen juries, consensus conferences, ombudspersons, citizen advisory commissions, and similar participatory instruments (Dienel 1989; Fiorino 1990; Durant and Joss 1995; Armour 1995; Applegate 1998) .",

Who decides whether a risk issue can be categorised as simple, complex, uncertain or ambiguous? It is possible that no consensus may be reached as to where to locate a specific risk. In those cases, a detailed (worst-case) analysis of possibilities of monitoring and surveillance may constitute the only achievable compromise (reversible removal of risk sources etc., timely detection of adverse effects, strength of surveillance systems). The best means, however, to deal with this conflict is to provide for stakeholder involvement when allocating the different risks into these four categories. This task can be located in the phase of screening as the third component of pre-assessment. Allocating risks to the four categories needs to be done before the assessment procedures start. Over the course of further analysis of risks and concerns the categorisation may change since new data and information is being collected that may necessitate a re-ordering of the risk. Yet the risk governance system that is proposed in this document builds upon the need to classify risks at the beginning and allocate them to different routes of appraisal, characterisation, evaluation and management. It seems prudent to have a screening board perform this challenging task. This board should consist of members of the risk and concern assessment team, of risk managers and key stakeholders (such as industry, NGOs and representatives of related regulatory or governmental agencies). The type of discourse required for this task is called design discourse.",

As is the case with all classifications, this scheme shows an extremely simplified picture of the involvement process and it has been criticised for being too rigid in its linking of risk characteristics (complexity, uncertainty, and ambiguity) and specific forms of discourse and dialogue (van Asselt 2005) . In addition to the generic distinctions shown in the graph below, it may for instance be wise to distinguish between participatory processes based on risk agent or risk absorbing issues. To conclude these caveats, the purpose of this scheme is to provide general orientation and explain a generic distinction between ideal cases rather than to offer a strict recipe for participation.",

The field of risk communication initially developed as a means of investigating how best expert assessments could be communicated to the public so that the tension between public perceptions and expert judgement could be bridged. In the course of time this original objective of educating the public about risks has been modified and even reversed as the professional risk community realised that most members of the public refused to become 'educated' by the experts but rather insisted that alternative positions and risk management practices should be selected by the professional community in their attempt to reduce and manage the risks of modern technology (Plough and Krimsky 1987).",

            "text": "In a recent review of risk communication, William Leiss identified three phases in the evolution of risk communication practices (Leiss 1996: 85ff.) . The first phase of risk communication emphasised the necessity to convey probabilistic thinking to the general public and to educate the laypersons to acknowledge and accept the risk management practices of the respective institutions. The most prominent instrument of risk communication in phase I was the application of risk comparisons. If anyone was willing to accept x fatalities as a result of voluntary activities, she or he should be obliged to accept another voluntary activity with less than x fatalities. However, Fig. 4 The risk management escalator and stakeholder involvement (from simple via complex and uncertain to ambiguous phenomena). this logic failed to convince audiences: people were unwilling to abstract from the context of risk-taking and the corresponding social conditions and they also rejected the reliance on expected values as the only benchmarks for evaluating risks. When this attempt at communication failed, phase II was initiated. This emphasised persuasion and focused on public relations efforts to convince people that some of their behaviour was unacceptable (such as smoking and drinking) since it exposed them to high risk levels, whereas public worries and concerns about many technological and environmental risks (such as nuclear installations, liquid gas tanks, or food additives) were regarded as overcautious due to the absence of any significant risk level. This communication process resulted in some behavioural changes at the personal level: many people started to quit some unhealthy habits. However, it did not convince a majority of these people that the current risk management practices for most of the technological facilities and environmental risks were indeed the politically appropriate response to risk. The one-way communication process of conveying a message to the public in carefully crafted, persuasive language produced little effect. Most respondents were appalled by this approach or simply did not believe the message, regardless how well it was packaged, so phase III evolved. This current phase of risk communication stresses a two-way communication process in which not only are members of the public expected to engage in a social learning process, but so are the risk managers as well. The objective of this communication effort is to build mutual trust by responding to the concerns of the public and relevant stakeholders. The ultimate goal of risk communication is to assist stakeholders in understanding the rationale of risk assessment results and risk management decisions, and to help them arrive at a balanced judgement that reflects the factual evidence about the matter at hand in relation to their own interests and values (OECD 2002) . Good practices in risk communication help stakeholders to make informed choices about matters of concern to them and to create mutual trust (Hance et al. 1988; Lundgren 1994) .",

A close communication link between risk/concern assessors and risk managers, particularly in the phases of pre-assessment and tolerability/acceptability judgement, is crucial for improving overall governance. Similarly, co-operation among natural and social scientists, close teamwork between legal and technical staff and continuous communication between policy makers and scientists are all important prerequisites for enhancing risk management performance. This is particularly important for the initial screening phase where the allocation of risks is performed. The second task, that of communicating risk appropriately to the outside world, is also a very challenging endeavour. Many representatives of stakeholder groups and, particularly, members of the affected and non-affected public are often unfamiliar with the approaches used to assess and manage risks and/or pursue a specific agenda, trying to achieve extensive consideration of their own viewpoints. They face difficulties when asked to differentiate between the potentially dangerous properties of a substance (hazards) and the risk estimates that depend on both the properties of the substance, the exposure to humans, and the scenario of its uses (Morgan et al. 2002) . Also complicating communication is the fact that some risks are acute, with severe effects that are easy to recognise, whereas others exert adverse effects only weakly but over a long period of time. Yet other risks' effects only start to show after an initial delay. Finally, it is no easy task to convey possible synergies of exposures to industrial substances with other factors that relate to lifestyle (e.g. nutrition, smoking, use of alcohol).",

This is, of course, an ideal picture that masks the realities of the political context in which risk governance takes place. In particular, the framing of risk is exposed to many institutional and political forces who may wish to jump on the bandwagon of public dissent or media hype in order to push their own interests (Shubik 1991) . Given the potential of risk perceptions to mobilise public outrage and, thus, to make it impossible for decision-makers not to listen, some actors in society may have an interest in orchestrating 'risk events', whereas others might have a major motivation for concealing risks or downplaying their impacts. Most political systems have responded to this manoeuvring by establishing independent risk assessment and sometimes management agencies, expecting that these are less likely to be influenced by public pressures. Although IRGC is well aware of the political context in which risk governance takes place, it cannot provide guidance on how to govern risk debates. What it can and intends to do, however, is give advice on how to base risk governance on the best available knowledge and practice. Such advice addresses, first, the process phases of risk appraisal, management and communication as stated above and, second, the strengthening of institutions and agencies so that they are empowered and resourced to perform their tasks in the most effective, efficient and fair manner. As the European Commission's White Paper on European Governance pointed out, the key ingredients of 'good' governance in this sense are openness, participation, accountability, effectiveness and coherence (EU 2001a: 10) . These requirements are important for all countries but, in particular, for many transitional and most developing countries. Since the IRGC's scope includes offering assistance to these countries, its work includes criteria for how to analyse and improve organisational capacity and 'good' governance practices.",

In a world where 'human capital' -and in particular brainpower combined with inspiration, courage and a strong ability towards implementation -has largely become the life-blood of society's progress and prosperity, it is quite evident that one of the major keys to the successful handling of risk is in people's heads as well. Given the often systemic and global (transboundary, international and ubiquitous) nature of today's major risks, special 'competencies and knowledge' are required. Specialised in-depth expert knowledge in a restricted area or sector may no longer suffice to understand and counteract risks which spread the boundaries of academic disciplines and business sectors, have several layers of effects and are determined by a multitude of often interlinked factors. However, compartmentalised specialisation is what many educational systems still foster. This approach should, in fact, be replaced by one which emphasises risk appraisal and management in education at all levels and which considers risk under a broad and multi-disciplinary perspective. There is a particular need for this in the engineering, architecture and design disciplines where a primarily technical focus should be extended to health, safety and environmental risk. Such a new approach, fostering in fact a 'bird's eye perspective' with regard to risk, should be anchored in national science and education policies and should grow to become part of our scientific and technological culture.",

Each country and, in many instances, different risk domains within a country pursue different pathways for dealing with risk.

Most analysts agree that many of the cognitive factors that govern risk perception are similar throughout the world (Rohrmann and Renn 2000) . In addition, risk management styles are also becoming increasingly homogenous as the world becomes more globalised (L\u00f6fstedt and Vogel 2001) . In spite of the distinct cultural differences among nations and the variations with respect to educational systems, research organisations, and structures of scientific institutions, assessment and management of risks and concerns have become universal enterprises in which nationality, cultural background or institutional setting play a minor role only. This is particularly due to the role of science in proposing and justifying regulatory standards. Research establishments as well as universities have evolved into multinational and cosmopolitan institutions that speak identical or at least similar languages and exchange ideas on world-wide communication networks. 19 Risk management depends, however, not only on scientific input. It rather rests on three components: systematic knowledge, legally prescribed procedures and social values. Even if the same knowledge is processed by different risk management authorities, the prescriptions for managing risk may differ in many aspects (e.g. with regard to inclusion and selection rules, interpretative frames, action plans for dealing with evidence, and others). National culture, political traditions, and social norms furthermore influence the mechanisms and institutions for integrating knowledge and expertise in the policy arenas. Policy analysts have developed a classification of governmental styles that address these aspects and mechanisms. While these styles have been labelled inconsistently in the literature, they refer to common procedures in different settings (O'Riordan and Wynne 1987) . They are summarised in Table 7 .",

The two intermediate and closely linked stages of risk characterisation and evaluation have been placed between the appraisal and management phases and can be assigned to either of them, depending on the circumstances: if the interpretation of evidence is the guiding principle for characterising risks, then risk and concern assessors are probably the most appropriate people to handle this task; if the interpretation of underlying values and the selection of yardsticks for judging acceptability are the key problems, then risk managers should be responsible. In an ideal setting, however, this task of determining a risk's acceptability should be performed in a joint effort by both assessors and managers. At any rate, a comprehensive, informed and value-sensitive risk management process requires a systematic compilation of results from risk assessment, risk perception studies and other context-related aspects as recommended and subsumed under the category of risk appraisal. Risk managers are thus well advised to include all the information related to the risk appraisal in evaluating the tolerability of risks and in designing and evaluating risk reduction options. The crucial task of risk communication runs parallel to all phases of handling risk: it assures transparency, public oversight and mutual understanding of the risks and their governance.",
