A therapeutic trial of antibiotics including levofloxacin was initiated after appropriate cultures were performed. The patient's condition deteriorated over the next 48 h, with respiratory compromise and worsening infiltrates visible on chest radiography, and the patient was transferred to the intensive care unit (ICU) on 13 May 2003. Intravenous ceftazidime was added to the regimen to treat possible Burkholderia pseudomallei infection. The patient was eventually intubated on 15 May 2003 (day 11 of illness) for severe respiratory distress. A PCR of an endotracheal tube specimen was positive for SARS coronavirus, and coronavirus IgM and IgG antibodies were present in blood samples obtained at day 14 of illness. Sputum and blood cultures for bacteria were repeatedly negative. The results of serological testing for mycoplasma, chlamydia, legionella, melioidosis, HIV, and dengue virus were negative. Cultures of secretions from sputum and endotracheal tube suction were negative for respiratory viruses, and smears were negative for AFB.",

The first patient did not come into contact with other patients throughout his hospitalization. The second patient was asymptomatic for TB. A search for possible cross-contamination in the ICU confirmed that there were no patients with TB or anyone suspected to have TB around him during his stay in the ICU. Discussion. TB is the prototype of infection that requires cellular immunity [3] . Coinfection with TB and HIV is well described in the literature [4, 5] . Singapore is endemic for the tubercle bacilli, with an annual reported incidence at 42.2 cases per 100,000 population in 2002 [6] . To our knowledge, these are the first 2 reports of patients with evidence of pulmonary TB occurring with SARS or shortly after treatment for SARS. The occurrence of 2 cases of pulmonary TB in the cohort of 236 patients with SARS far exceeded the incidence in the general population.",

We acknowledge that the presence of diabetes mellitus in the first patient and the use of high-dose methylprednisolone in the second patient might have further compromised their host immunity.
