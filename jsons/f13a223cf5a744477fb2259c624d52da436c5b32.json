            "text": "A novel viral pneumonia originating from China was announced to the World Health Organization on December 31, 2019 (WHO, 2020b). As of March 26, 2020, there were 465,915 confirmed cases and 21,031 confirmed deaths from this coronavirus disease across the globe (WHO, 2020a) . This pandemic has rapidly and profoundly affected every part of daily life, from the way people work, live, shop, socialize, and plan for the future. Although the psychological impact of these changes has been well documented by the media, the mental health care needs of those suffering from this crisis have been relatively neglected . This is surprising, given that research on previous global disease outbreaks has shown that people suffering from pandemic-related anxiety tend to exhibit elevated levels of post-traumatic stress, general stress, anxiety, health anxiety, and suicidality (Chong et al., 2004; Wheaton, Abramowitz, Berman, Fabricant, & Olatunji, 2012; Wu et al., 2009; Yip, Cheung, Chau, & Law, 2010) . Therefore, the Coronavirus Anxiety Scale (CAS; Lee, 2020) was recently created to help identify those particularly affected by the fear and uncertainty of this growing pandemic crisis (see Table 1 ).",

            "text": "The CAS is a 5-item mental health screener designed to efficiently and effectively aid healthcare professionals and researchers identify probable cases of dysfunctional anxiety associated with the COVID-19 crisis (Lee, 2020) . Each item of the CAS taps a distinct physiologically-based fear or anxiety reaction to coronavirus related thoughts or information. It is important to note that coronavirus anxiety has also been referred to as \"coronaphobia\" in this emerging line of research (Asmundson & Taylor, 2020) . The CAS was developed using online data of 775 adults who experienced significant anxiety over the infectious disease outbreak. In the study, the CAS demonstrated solid reliability (\u03b1s = .93 for both an exploratory factor analysis COVID-19 ANXIETY 5 subsample and a confirmatory factor analysis subsample), validity (i.e., factorial and constructrelated), and measurement equivalence across age, race, and gender. CAS scores were found to be correlated with coronavirus diagnosis, impairment, alcohol/drug coping, religious coping, hopelessness, suicidal ideation, as well as attitudes toward President Trump and Chinese food/products. These correlations support the CAS as a measure of mental health because coronavirus anxiety was related to clinically significant disturbances across psychological, interpersonal, and behavioral processes (Lee, 2020) . The CAS exhibited good diagnostic properties (AUC = .94, p < .001) and with an optimized cut score of \u2265 9, it has been able to accurately distinguish between persons with and without dysfunctional anxiety (90% sensitivity and 85% specificity). Although these findings are promising, there have been no other studies to date that examined the reliability of these results. Independent studies investigating the psychometric properties of the CAS are absolutely essential for establishing the scientific legitimacy of this instrument. Thus, the purpose of this study was to examine the reliability and validity of the CAS using an online sample of 398 adults.",

The results supported these expectations with CAS scores being positively correlated with functional impairment, fear about coronavirus, alcohol or drug coping, negative religious coping, extreme hopelessness, and passive suicidal ideation. The only unexpected finding was the lack of correlation between the CAS scores and time spend thinking about and/or watching media about coronavirus. This may due to the fact that the topic of coronavirus saturated media reports when the data for this study was collected (March 23 rd and 24 th , 2020). Despite this one discrepancy, the findings not only support the construct validity of the CAS by demonstrating clear links with indices of maladjustment and distress, but replicate the findings of the original CAS investigation as well.",
