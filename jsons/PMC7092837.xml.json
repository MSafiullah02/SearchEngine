            "text": "Neuraminidases are expressed in many bacteria including Clostridium perfringens (Cp), Streptococcus pneumonia (Sp), and Pseudomonas aeruginosa and in viruses including influenza A and B. Neuraminidases catalyze hydrolytic removal of terminal N-acetylneuraminic acid (Neu5Ac) from a number of glycoconjugates and play a pivotal role in human infection [1], [2], [3]. Viral neuraminidases cleave the terminal Neu5Ac from the cellular receptor to which the newly replicated viral particles are attached, and thus neuraminidases are involved in viral replication namely in the release from host cells [4]. Meanwhile, bacterial neuraminidases function at the initial stages of a pulmonary infection and participate in the biofilm formation, which plays important roles in bacterial growth and colonization [5], [6]. Thus, neuraminidases of pathogenic bacteria and viruses are considered promising drug targets for prevention of infections that cause fatal human diseases such as influenza, bacteremia, sepsis, cholera, food poisoning, and gas gangrene [6], [7], [8], [9], [10]. Several anti-neuraminidase agents such as substrate (Neu5Ac) mimics, cyclopentane, pyrrolidine-based derivatives, ethanesulfonic acid derivatives, and natural compounds are used for drug development [10], [11], [12], [13], [14], [15], [16], [17]. Commercial antibiotics and antiviral agents including oseltamivir (Tamiflu) and zanamivir (Relenza) have been developed to prevent bacterial and viral infections. Even though various commercial drugs are available on the market, emergence of resistance to antibiotics and antiviral drugs resistance mandates the development of new drugs [18], [19], [20].",

CHES binds to the active site of several enzymes including neuraminidase NanB from Streptococcus pneumonia (SpNanB, PDB code 2VW2), papain like protease from severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) (PDB code 4M0W), sulfotransferase (Teg12, PDB code 3NIB), Sirtuin 5 (Sirt5, PDB code 3RIG), and haloalkaloic acid dehalogenase (HAD) phosphatase (PDB code 4YGR); the action inhibits substrate binding and enzymatic activity. These data suggest that CHES may serve a scaffold for new drug development for modulation on an enzyme's function. CHES contains a hydrophilic taurine (2-aminoethanesulfonic acid) moiety and a hydrophobic cyclohexyl groups. The amphipathic properties of CHES raise the possibility of CHES-based development of anti-neuraminidase agents, because the catalytic site of neuraminidases comprises hydrophilic residues (an arginine cluster with three arginine residues and a catalytic aspartate residue) and a hydrophobic pocket [22].",

We obtained a serendipitous complex crystal of the catalytic domain of CpNanI (CpNanICD) with CHES serving as the buffer. Here we report the crystal structure of CpNanICD in complex with CHES (CpNanICD-CHES) at 1.24 \u00c5 resolution.

Two molecules of the CpNanICD-CHES complex were present in an asymmetric unit and the Matthews coefficient (VM) was calculated to be 2.40 \u00c53Da\u22121, which corresponds to solvent content of 48.8%. The structure of the CpNanICD-CHES complex was solved by the molecular replacement method in the MOLREP software using the apo-structure of CpNanICD (PDB code 2VK5) as the search model [26]. Automated ligand building of CHES (ligand ID NHE) in the structure was carried out using the phenix.ligandfit [27]. Cycles of manual rebuilding were performed using Coot software, and subsequent refinement was carried out using Refmac5 and phenix.refine, with the final crystallographic R value of 14.4% (R\nfree = 15.8%) [28], [29], [30]. The composite omit map (mF\no-DF\nc) of CHES contoured at 1.5 \u03c3 was generated by phenix.mtz2map software [30]. The weak electron density regions (residues 691\u2013694) were excluded from the final structure. The Ramachandran statistics were calculated using program MolProbity showing no residues with torsional angles in forbidden areas: 96.4% of the residues were in the favored regions and 3.6% of the residues were in allowed regions [31]. Data collection and refinement statistics are summarized in Table 1\n. Atomic coordinates have been deposited in the Protein Data Bank under accession code 5TSP.",

In the CpNanICD-CHES structure, the hydrophobic pocket (residues I327, F347, F353, W354, and F460) contributes to the stable interaction with the cyclohexyl group of CHES. In human neuraminidases, however, hydrophobic pockets include polar residues (E111 and Q112 in Neu2; E113 and R114 in Neu3; E111 in Neu4). Thus, we predict that the hydrophobic interaction of CHES with human neuraminidases is less stable. In addition, CHES interacts with R285 and D328 of CpNanICD, and this interaction is mediated by one water molecule (W1). On the other hand, the residues corresponding to D328 of CpNanICD (G140 in Neu1, N86 in Neu2, N88 in Neu3, and N86 in Neu4) are not conserved, and the water-mediated hydrogen bonding with CHES may be different in human neuraminidases. Collectively, our data suggest that CHES interacts less favorably with human neuraminidases (Neu1\u2013Neu4) because of a less hydrophobic interaction with the cyclohexyl group of CHES and the absence of water-mediated hydrogen bonding with the secondary amine of CHES.",

After a structural comparison of human Neu1\u2212Neu4 structures, we were able to suggest strategies for modification of CHES to facilitate for the development of new anti-neuraminidase agents targeting CpNanI. CHES contains a sulfonic acid group showing binding similar to that of a carboxyl group in Neu5Ac, oseltamivir, and zanamivir, where it interacts with the arginine cluster in the catalytic site (Figs. S3A and B). Nonetheless, there is a lack of hydrophilic functional groups such as the 6-glycerol side chain, the 4-hydroxyl group of Neu5Ac, the 4-amino group of oseltamivir, and 4-guanidino group of zanamivir. Thus, addition of a glycerol group at C3 of CHES and a hydrophilic group (such as hydroxyl, amino, or guanidine group) at nitrogen (N4) of CHES may replace the water molecule (W1) bridging the hydrogen bonds between CHES, R285 and D328 and may enhance the interaction of CHES with residues of CpNanICD (D291, R285, D328, E539, Y485, and R555) (Figs. 2 and S4). Moreover, introduction of additional moieties into the cyclohexyl ring of CHES was reported to increase the inhibitory effect on SpNanB [17]. Thus, we propose that the additional hydrophobic moieties such as linear hydrophobic groups (hydrophobic pentyloxy substituents) at the C3 position and cyclohexyl substituents (aryl groups of phenyl and benzyl, cycloalkane functional groups of cycloheptyl, and cyclooctyl) of CHES should enhance hydrophobic interactions as well as \u03c0-\u03c0 stacking in the hydrophobic pocket of the bacterial neuraminidase catalytic sites. In addition, we predicted that addition of hydrophobic moieties in the cyclohexyl groups would also block the interaction with human neuraminidases.",
