Transplant coordinators who remain affiliated with transplant units and serve a dual role as donor and recipient coordinators may fulfill each role equally effectively, and this model may have important benefits. However, in terms of one of the most important outcome measures\u2014maximizing the potential from deceased donation\u2014international experience and the balance of evidence suggest that a superior framework involves dedicated donor coordinators based in potential donor hospitals. In some of the countries with the highest deceased donation rates, such as Spain, Portugal, and Italy, there are donor coordinators based in every hospital in the country [5]. They play an important role in increasing and maintaining donation awareness and provide education and support to the staff of potential donor hospitals. Donor coordinators will often help approach the donor family, participate in acquiring consent or authorization for donation, provide help with donor management in the critical care unit, and support the donor family during the process of donation. Donor coordinators will also liaise with legal authorities to facilitate donation and ensure that surmountable legal obstacles do not prevent organ donation. Donor coordinators will then inform organ retrieval teams and coordinate the retrieval process. The responsibility for transporting retrieval teams to donor hospitals and organs to their destinations may rest with the donor coordinator, with the transplant units, or be shared between them. The regionalization of donation services, together with a uniform approach to the travel arrangements, is probably going to improve the quality and safety of the travel services for the donor team [1].",

According to this classification, donors are defined as follows:\nUnacceptable risk includes absolute contraindication, with the exception of some life-saving transplantation procedures in the absence of other therapeutic options on a case-by-case basis.\nIncreased but acceptable risk includes cases where transmissible organisms or diseases are identified during the evaluation of the donor, but organ utilization is justified by the specific health situation of the recipient or the severity of their clinical condition.\nCalculated risk (criteria referring to protocols for elective transplants) includes all cases where, even in the presence of transmissible diseases, transplantation is allowed for recipients with the same disease or with a protective serological status; this risk also applies to donors with documented bacteremia and/or bacterial meningitis provided that the donor was on targeted antimicrobial treatment for a minimum duration of 24\u201348 h.\nNot assessable risk includes cases where the evaluation process does not allow an appropriate risk assessment for transmissible diseases.\nStandard risk includes cases where the evaluation process did not identify a transmissible disease.\n",

However, donor shortage promoted the acceptance of donors up to 50 or 60 [28\u201331]. Using hearts from older donors, the outcome depends on other factors, chiefly ischemic time, which, when longer than 3\u20134 h, is associated with increased early mortality [32\u201337]. Lamour et al. [38] found that a 40-year-old recipient with congenital heart disease who received a 50-year-old donor heart with 3-h ischemic time had a 15 % probability of death within 1 year, compared with a 40 % probability of death within 1 year if that donor\u2019s ischemic time was 5 h. As indicated by the International Society of Heart and Lung Transplantation guidelines for the care of heart transplant recipients [37], donors younger than 45 may be acceptable even with undesirable characteristics such as prolonged ischemic time, recipient comorbidities, and previous recipient operations with hemodynamically destabilizing bleeding. Hearts from donors between the ages of 45\u201355 should safely implant when the projected ischemic time is \u22644 h and the potential recipient does not have comorbidities or surgical issues; donor hearts >55 years should be accepted carefully and balance the pros and cons for the recipient (Table 3.2).\n",

Lietz [48] revealed that ischemic time >4 h and donor death resulting from cerebrovascular accident significantly contributed to poor early posttransplant outcomes. At the same time, it is important to consider that end-stage heart failure presents a significant risk of death while awaiting heart transplantation. The UNOS registry data (in the period 1991\u20131996) reveal that patients with blood group O have a median waiting time of 332 days; the median waiting time for patients >18 years old was 230 days [49]. Bennett et al. [50] outlined that despite the high risk resulting from the heart transplant, there was a clear long-term survival benefit for status I recipients who received older donor hearts. The data described by Lietz [48] are significant: in patients in status 1 (see Table 3.3), 6-month mortality of 70 % was observed when on a waiting list, and the risk of death was 8.5 times higher than that of status 1 patients who received an allograft from donors >40 years old, with a resulting 14 % 6-month mortality; when an older donor heart was implanted, mortality increased 1.6 times but was not statistically significantly different from recipients who received hearts from younger donors.\n",

Direct toxic effects on the myocardium have been described, such as scattered foci of myocyte necrosis, and in some studies, contraction band necrosis, myocarditis, and foci of myocyte fibrosis [53]. These abnormalities may lead to cases of cardiomyopathy. Because intravenous (IV) cocaine is more toxic to the heart compared to non-IV cocaine, ISHLT recommends not accepting hearts from IV cocaine abusers [37, 54].

            "text": "\nCardiac factors:Intractable ventricular arrhythmias represent a definitive contraindication.Valvular heart disease. A bicuspid aortic valve is not contraindicated if the valve function is maintained [37]. A moderate aortic insufficiency, not diagnosed prior to organ retrieval, may cause improper myocardial protection during cardioplegic infusion. Most valvular pathologies in the donor graft are considered a contraindication to heart transplantation; however, there are reports indicating successful bench repair or posttransplant repair/replacement for aortic and mitral valves [67\u201370].Coronary artery disease. Coronary artery disease in the transplanted heart represents a major concern for physicians involved in heart transplant programs. Coronary disease can be unrecognized, due to the lack of coronary angiography in the donor, or known. In both cases, there is a subsequent risk of early graft failure. Considering patients with early graft failure, the prevalence of coronary disease was 22.8 % [71]; moreover, some reports indicate that a transmitted coronary disease may accelerate graft vasculopathy [72, 73]. Grauhan [74] showed that when donor grafts with more than single-vessel disease are used, the risk of early graft failure is elevated; the risk is 6.3 % in donors without coronary disease, 7.5 % in donors with single-vessel disease, and 42.3 % in grafts with double- and triple-vessel disease. In contrast, Marelli et al. [75] reported the transplant of donor grafts with coronary disease in patients who were urgent cases or who would otherwise not have been offered heart transplants due to associated medical risk (alternate recipients, see below); 59 % of the patients received a concomitant coronary bypass procedure. The study reported that in the patients listed in status I, actuarial survival at 2 years was 50 vs. 81.3 % in the \u201calternate\u201d recipients.Donor left ventricular hypertrophy. This is an important risk factor determining early graft failure, particularly when left ventricular donor wall thickness is >14 mm [76].Cardiac tumors. At echocardiography, a myxoma can be diagnosed. A right atrium myxoma can be bench removed, and there is only an embolic risk in the pulmonary circulation (lungs should not be evaluated in this case). When a myxoma is situated in the left atrium, there is a high risk of coronary embolism at the moment of cardiac harvesting when the aorta is clamped [77].Hemodynamic instability. It is well known that donor hemodynamic instability represents an important contraindication to heart retrieval. Hemodynamic instability appears primarily after the \u201ccatecholamine storm\u201d when vasoplegia and hypotension may irreversibly compromise donation. For this reason, there is increasing evidence that the moderation of pathophysiological changes by active management in an intensive care unit can increase available grafts for transplantation, also recruiting donors considered marginal [78\u201380]. This active management is realized through the following approaches:Swan-Ganz catheter insertion for cardiac index and wedge pressure measurements; central venous pressure alone is not a sufficient diagnostic tool for fluid administration monitoring.If vasopressor drugs are needed, vasopressin at 2.4 units h\u22121 may reduce catecholamine administration; high doses of norepinephrine, > 0.2 \u03bcg/kg/min should be avoided. Canadian guidelines recommend vasopressin as a first-choice drug [81].The management of electrolyte disturbances in the Eurotransplant region from 1997 to 2005 increased recipient mortality when donor sodium concentrations were <130 or >170 mmol/l\n\u22121 (BJA).\nAlternate recipient list. An alternate recipient list was proposed by Lacks [82] to transplant heart recipients at high risk and without standard criteria. These patients are coupled to marginal donor organs refused by other centers. The most frequent donor risks for the alternate recipient list were high inotropic doses, left ventricular hypertrophy, and hepatitis C seropositivity. A significant mortality was reported in the alternate recipient list [83\u201385], although other reports show a survival similar to patients in the standard list [86].\n",

However, the ratio can be easily modified by secretions, pulmonary edema, atelectasis, and aggressive donor management (recruitment maneuvers, low tidal volume, PEEP of 15 H2O cm, bronchial aspiration, and bronchoscopy). Direct left and right pulmonary vein blood gas sampling is sometimes very important in reassessing the lungs individually, and partial pulmonary vein oxygen pressure was reported to correlate much more reliably than PaO2 with the outcome in the recipient. By separate sampling of pulmonary vein PaO2, it is possible to harvest at least one lung if the PaO2/FIO2 ratio is much better than in the sample obtained from the arterial peripheral catheter. Sometimes in young donors gas exchanges may be satisfactory also in case of severe chest trauma, but chest CT can show important massive, bilateral pulmonary contusions, pneumopericardium and hemopneumothorax (Fig. 3.1\n).",

It is thought that large amounts of colloid can pass into the extracellular space due to endothelial permeability modification by the inflammatory molecules and can worsen lung function after transplantation by increasing the oncotic pressure. A large quantity of crystalloids may also produce a considerable increase of the central venous pressure and, if prolonged over time, may produce edema of the liver parenchyma and hamper liver graft function after transplantation.

Through experimental studies on pigs, a perfusion solution was developed to prevent edema formation and the loss of lung function. The solution was designated Steen Solution\u00ae (Vitrolife; Gothenburg, Sweden). Steen Solution is an extracellular solution for lung preservation composed of electrolytes, dextran, and albumin. A noteworthy feature of the solution is its high oncotic pressure [99]. The first clinical use of EVLP [100] was described in 2001: the donor was a 54-year-old man who had suffered cardiac arrest due to acute myocardial infarction. The transplantation to a recipient patient with pulmonary emphysema was successful. ELVP has been performed by several lung transplant centers worldwide with good results. At the Toronto Lung Transplant Program, from September 2008 to December 2011, 253 lung transplants were performed with conventional preservation lungs. Primary graft dysfunction grade three at 72 h was recorded in 2 % EVLP vs. 8.5 % control (P = 0.14), and time on mechanical ventilation, extracorporeal life support, ICU stay, hospital stay, and 30-day mortality were not different. Furthermore, similar 1-year survival rates were observed: 87 % for the EVLP group vs. 86 % for the standard group [101].",

Less than 40 % steatosis evaluated on liver biopsy is fundamental to assure the normal function of the implanted graft, but in the absence of other contraindications, a steatosis of 50 % can be considered for the transplantation of the whole liver for special recipients at risk of dropout from the waiting list (HCC patients). Split-liver transplantation, a procedure where one donor liver is divided into two hemilivers for two recipients, is an important tactic for overcoming organ shortage. To date, the principal beneficiaries have been adult/pediatric pairs, and excellent outcomes have been described. However, the criteria for the liver-splitting technique require much more restrictive criteria than for conventional whole livers. Donor eligibility criteria for the split-liver procedure were as follows: age 55 or younger, no cardiac arrest episodes, less than 5 days in intensive care, low inotropic support (dopamine \u22645 mg/kg/min, dobutamine \u226410 mg/kg/min, and no epinephrine or norepinephrine requirement), Na+ \u2264155 mg/L, liver enzymes no more than double the normal, and no macroscopic evidence of hepatic steatosis, or less than 20 % hepatic steatosis if a biopsy was taken, because liver biopsy was not routinely performed. Liver-splitting techniques for two adults are still experimental surgical procedures, and they have interesting results when these restrictive criteria are employed for donors and for particular pairs of recipients in which one is of small size [102].",

Hepatic donors\u2019 acceptance criteria that permit the use of HCV-positive donors without liver disease for HCV-positive recipients are increasing. The short-term results of these transplants do not differ from those obtained in HCV-positive recipients from HCV-negative donors. Recent reviews report studies in liver transplants with HCV-positive donor livers in HCV-positive recipients and showed similar graft survival, patient survival, and hepatitis C recurrence in the recipient and in an HCV-positive hepatic recipient group in whom livers from HCV-negative donors were transplanted [104].

In addition to the contraindications previously mentioned, there are some particular absolute contraindications for a living donor. Donors having macrosteatosis (>20 %) on liver biopsy are rejected. Remnant liver volume cannot be less than 25 %. This is an issue especially when the right lobe graft is large. It is never an issue when the left lateral segment is the proposed graft and is rarely an issue if the left lobe graft is taken. The Human Organ Transplantation Act, in some countries, does not allow unrelated donation; this is to prevent donation under any type of coercion and to avoid any organ trade. The living donor should be between 18 and 55 years of age. A body mass index >30 for the donor is generally associated with a consistent degree of macrosteatosis; donors should be encouraged to reduce weight, and a liver biopsy should rule out liver steatosis >20 %. A liver attenuation index <5 on a plain CT scan is suggestive of steatosis. Such donors are either rejected or, in the absence of other donors, need to reduce weight, and a biopsy should be performed to rule out macrosteatosis >20 % [3]. Donors are also rarely rejected for anatomical reasons. Double artery, double portal vein, or multiple hepatic veins such as a V8 or a V6 can be anastomosed using specific surgical techniques, and these presentations should no longer preclude donation. However, multiple anatomical anomalies, e.g., a portal vein trifurcation with a right bile duct draining the segment IV, double right hepatic arteries in the donor, or multiple right-sided segmental portal vein tributaries draining into the left portal vein, are considered contraindications for LDLT. The majority of biliary anatomy in the donor is acceptable [106].",

Although the use of dopamine as a renal protective agent in the general critical care population is inappropriate, Schnuelle and colleagues demonstrated in a European multicenter trial that donor pretreatment with low-dose dopamine can reduce the need for dialysis after kidney transplantation [107]. Absolute kidney donor exclusion criteria (Table 3.5) shared by the donors of other organs are the same as those for other organs and include HIV infection, malignant neoplasms (including in the central nervous system), sepsis, disseminated infections uncontrolled with antimicrobial therapy (including bacteria, viruses, and fungi), multiorgan failure, and uncommon diseases such as Creutzfeldt-Jakob and those caused by prions such as Kuru. Donors with hepatitis B and C may be accepted for donation to recipients who are carriers of the same viruses. Thus, kidneys from AgHBs carrier donors may be used in AgHBs(+) recipients. Additionally, the use of renal grafts from donors with HCV-positive antibodies in HCV-positive recipients can be considered without apparently increasing major morbidity or mortality. Chronic renal failure is also an absolute renal donor exclusion criterion.\n",

The best indication of the suitability of a pancreas allograft for transplantation is the appearance of the organ at the time of procurement. After completing the surgical maneuvers, the pancreatic parenchyma should be carefully evaluated for its procurement in terms of fat content, edema, or fibrosis and for quality of the vasculature. All aspects of the pancreas should be inspected for injury to the pancreatic parenchyma and for the presence of hematomas, masses, or nodular areas. Most centers avoid transplanting organs with calcifications, extensive fibrosis, fatty infiltration, severe edema, or significant visceral atherosclerosis. Depending from different center policies, pancreas procurement may be cancelled for technical reasons such as abnormal arterial vascularization between the liver and the pancreas, which may occur with a right replacing hepatic artery originating from the superior mesenteric artery and would render a successful and correct split and the transplantation of both organs difficult. Surgical injuries that occur during pancreas procurement may lead to complications after transplantation, impaired function of the allograft, graft loss, or even death of the patient. These injuries may be so dangerous that the pancreas harvesting must be considered an absolute contraindication. In such cases, pancreatic islet transplantation can be considered. Proper procurement and the constant training of surgeons for pancreatic procurement are therefore very important to maintain high-quality pancreas procurement. Some recent reports show that vascular lesions are observed in 16.7 % of pancreatic grafts and suggest that surgical procedures of pancreas procurement may be improved by better surgical training and the standardization of the surgical technique. Some studies have shown that pancreatic allografts have been frequently refused during back-table inspection, partly because of multiple surgical injuries to the artery, veins, and duodenum [108]. Donor age and procurement by centers not performing pancreas transplantations were both found to significantly increase the probability of pancreas refusal. The quality of pancreas procurement may thus be improved by the specific training of surgeons who specifically perform pancreas transplantations.",
