            "text": "March 2020, the World Health Organisation (WHO) declared the rapidly spreading SARS-CoV-2 virus outbreak a pandemic. This novel coronavirus is the cause of a contagious acute respiratory disease (COVID- 19) , which was first reported in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China. [1] [2] [3] As of 17 April 2020, it had infected over two million people and spread to 210 countries and territories around the world. While precise statistics on mortality are being determined, COVID-19 can be deadly with an estimated 1% case fatality rate, and this rate increases dramatically for the elderly and vulnerable who have underlying health problems. 4, 5 The outbreak of COVID-19 has placed an unprecedented burden on healthcare systems in most-affected countries and has resulted in considerable economic losses and possible deep global recession. 6, 7 To date, there is no vaccine or effective treatment. The widely adopted strategy has been the use of Non-Pharmaceutical Interventions (NPIs) such as social distancing and even full lockdown in order to control the spread of the virus and ease pressure on health and care systems. 8, 9 NPIs have been implemented in many countries including China, Italy, Spain, the United Kingdom (UK), and the Netherlands. These measures have been shown to considerably reduce the new confirmed cases in China and South Korea, among others. 8 Key to the success of NPIs is the timing of these interventions and the response of the population, both of which might differ among countries, and could necessitate further interventions in the case of low compliance either nationally or locally. Therefore, we urgently require an objective and quantitative way to monitor population behaviour to assess the impact and response of such interventions. Additionally, we need to monitor for the potential effects of a rebound in cases in the winter months as social distancing measures are relaxed in order to strategise and understand where course corrections are required. Similarly, understanding potential seasonal forcing of COVID-19 will require a good understanding of the effects of different NPIs so they can be factored out.",

To manage the data collected in multiple sensor modalities and mobile devices, platforms such as the open-source RADAR-base (radarbase.org) mobile health platform have been developed. 13 This platform has been used to enable remote monitoring in a range of use cases including central nervous system diseases (major depressive disorder (MDD), epilepsy and multiple sclerosis (MS)) as part of the IMI2 RADAR-CNS major programme (radar-cns.org). 14 In this paper, we explore the utility of the RADAR-base platform as a toolbox to test the effect and impact of NPIs aimed at limiting the spread of infectious diseases such as COVID-19. Specifically, we investigate parameters derived from smartphones including GPS and phone usage, and from wearable Fitbit devices including step counts, heart rate, and sleep patterns, which may be altered by changes in lifestyle due to NPIs such as social isolation.",

The data have been collected for the purpose of finding new ways of monitoring MDD (Spain (150), the Netherlands (103) and the UK (316)) and MS (Milan, Italy (208); Barcelona, Spain (179); and Copenhagen, Denmark (106)) using wearable devices and smartphone technology to improve patients' Quality of Life (QOL), and potentially to change the treatment of these and other chronic disorders. As we focused on country-level behavioural changes in response to the NPIs, we aggregated data collected in Spain and did not focus on analysing differences between participants with MDD and MS (except for a sensitivity analysis described in the Discussion). Passive participant data were collected through a smartphone and a Fitbit device, which included location, activity, sleep, heart rate and phone usage data. These passive data required minimal conscious participant engagement and were collected continuously on a 24/7 basis. In addition to passive data, active data were collected, which required clinicians or participants to fill out forms or questionnaires or perform short clinical tests (e.g. speech, walking, balance tests). All data were managed by the RADAR-base platform.",

This filtering step helped to mitigate the influence of daily outliers caused, for example, by missing data. To facilitate interpretation, we also marked time points of public announcements related to lockdown policies. 17 To examine physical-and social-behavioural changes induced by the lockdowns, comparisons among baseline, pre-, and post-lockdown were carried out using Kruskal-Wallis Tests, where the filtered daily average of features for 20 consecutive days were used for each of the three groups. 18 For the baseline phase, we chose either a 20-day period around one year before the lockdowns, or the earliest stable 20-day period. For the pre-lockdown phase, we chose the period immediately before the first restrictive measure. For the post-lockdown phase, we chose the period following the most recent lockdown. If a significant difference among these three groups was found, post-hoc Dunn test was applied with Bonferroni corrections. 19 Boxplots were used to present the results.

Similarly, maximum distance from home reduced to very low levels by the end of March (z-test statistics = 6\u00b71, p-value < 0\u00b7001) and Fitbit step count (z-test statistics = 5\u00b71, p-value < 0\u00b7001) and heart rate (z-test statistics = 6\u00b72, p-value < 0\u00b7001) decreased.

Participants spent more time at home, travelled much less, and were more active on their phone, interacting with others by using social apps. However, the response across nations differed and may be related to the country-specific implementations of NPIs and perceived degree of risk at the national level. Participants in Spain put a hard stop on daily outdoor activity on the day of their national quarantine. In contrast, participants in Denmark maintained more of their usual daily routine. These findings are also in line with Google mobility reports. 20-24 According to the reports updated on 11 April, Italy, Spain, and the UK saw no less than a 32% decrease for all mobility trends except residential stay, which witnessed over a 19% increase. On the contrary, Denmark and the Netherlands showed more than a 33% increase in mobility trends for parks, in addition to no more than an 11% increase in residential stays. Furthermore, mobility trends to Grocery and Pharmacy witnessed a 4% decrease in the Netherlands and a 4% increase in Denmark. The difference in the changes in the extracted features may reflect difference in communication and implementations of NPIs, population reactions to different coping strategies, and cultural differences.",

This decrease, coupled with an increase in social app duration, could possibly serve as indicators of social distancing. Furthermore, it has been shown that an elevated resting heart rate may suggest acute infections. 25 It would be interesting to infer one's infection by continuously monitoring heart rate, especially when the population remains indoor for a vast majority of the time. Such monitoring provides the possibility to generate early warning signals for symptomatic or presymptomatic respiratory infections, thereby aiding timely self-isolation or treatment. The COVID-19 related questionnaires we are now distributing will allow us to gain a deeper understanding of the relationship between mobile devices derived features including heart rate/activity and the COVID-19 symptoms.",

A dramatic change in unlock duration was observed in Denmark around 11 March 2020 which may be related to the announcement of the pending lockdown on that day and a 185% increase in the confirmed cases in Denmark on the previous day. Another example can be seen just after the mitigation phase was announced in the UK on 12 March, in which social distancing was not strongly recommended, some participants seemed to isolate themselves voluntarily by staying at home for much longer. This observation may also explain the significant difference between the baseline and prelockdown phases and suggests that people may have acted ahead of further government restriction. Furthermore, this is accompanied by a marked loss of weekday/weekend periodic structure pre/post lockdown period (see figure 7 ). Together these observations highlight the potential of remote monitoring to monitor population reactions to interventions.",

            "text": "There are some issues to consider in relation to this work. Firstly, we only used a limited duration of periods (20 days) to compare the behaviour across the three phases. This limitation was because lockdowns had only recently been imposed. However, even with these short periods, we were still able to detect significant differences among the three phases, highlighting the potential advantages of using mobile devices for detecting behaviour changes. Future work will focus on collecting and analysing more data as the project data collection is ongoing. Second, the participants included in this study have different medical conditions (depression or multiple sclerosis), which led to different baseline levels across countries. Nevertheless, as the focus of this study is the changes in the pre-, and post-lockdown phases relative to the baseline, we were still able to identify and compare the changes induced by lockdowns. We also analysed the data collected in Spain split into MDD and MS separately. The trends and the statistical differences in all features remained the same except total sleep duration. The unsplit case showed statistical significance (z-test statistics = -2\u00b74, p = 0\u00b7047), while the split case did not. This was probably due to reduced sample size when split into MDD and MS. Understanding of any artefacts or effects introduced into the RADAR-CNS data by the NPIs will be crucial in RADAR-CNS being able to deliver its aim of identifying signals that predict and prevent MDD and MS. Third, on account of requirements for participants' privacy in the RADAR-CNS studies, location data were purposely obfuscated with a participant-specific random value preventing precise localisation of the participants, which prevented us from taking into account geographic factors within a country. It would be interesting to examine how specific regions react to lockdowns when these data are available in future work. Fourth, limited sample sizes in certain countries and data loss impacted the smoothness of the time series plots. The time series plots for Denmark and the Netherlands showed relatively large variance particularly in the early phase as these sites have only recently begun recruiting. Several dips and spikes in step counts and heart rate were seen in all countries during July and August. This was due to the fact that we had some data loss due to connectivity issues with the Fitbit server during this time. Fifth, we only explored a subset of features that can be derived from smartphones and Fitbit wearable devices. Future work will investigate whether other features offer additional information for a more complete description of lifestyle changes. Finally, national policy and participant acceptability determine what value is placed on privacy and therefore, what level of monitoring is acceptable. At one end of the spectrum, we have seen individual-level contact tracing mobile apps and at the other privacy-preserving approaches that only allow population intervention monitoring. We were able to demonstrate value in the data collected even under strict privacy-preserving conditions.",

            "text": "Using individual-level data from smartphones and wearable devices over a one-year period covering the outbreak and subsequent spread of the COVID-19 pandemic across five European countries, we were able to detect and monitor the physical-behavioural and socialbehavioural changes in response to the NPIs. We found that most participants spent more time at home, travelled much less and were more active on their phone, in particular, interacting with others using social apps. We also showed the different responses across countries with Denmark showing attenuated responses to NPIs compared to other countries. Furthermore, we were able to identify features such as homestay duration, maximum distance from home and step count which varied significantly as the implementation of NPIs. These features could be used as objective measures for evaluating aspects of NPIs performance during their introduction and any subsequent relaxation of these measures. This work demonstrates the value of a generalised open-source platform such as RADAR-base to leverage data from wearables and mobile technologies for understanding behavioural impact of public health interventions implemented in response to infectious outbreaks such as COVID-19. This ability to monitor response to interventions, in near real time, will be particularly important in understanding behaviour as social distancing measures are relaxed as part of an COVID-19 exit strategy. Future work will include utilising participants responses to COVID-19 related questionnaires, together with an expanded feature set to gain more specific understandings into the relationship between mobile devices derived features and the COVID-19 symptoms.
