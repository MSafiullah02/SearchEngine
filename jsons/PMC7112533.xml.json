            "text": "Eimeriosis is caused by pathogenic Eimeria spp. and is considered a universal problem of dairy and beef calves. Clinical eimeriosis (coccidiosis) manifests itself as moderate to severe, and sometimes bloody, diarrhoea, inappetence and lethargy [1]. Chronic or subclinical eimeriosis reduces growth rate and can result in considerable economic losses [2], [3]. As the mere presence of Eimeria spp. is not conclusive for them being the etiologic agents of diarrhoea, an oocyst count of pathogenic species of 500 oocyst per gram of faeces (opg) in calves with simultaneous signs of diarrhoea has been used to indicate eimeriosis for research purposes [4], [5]. The oocysts are formed during gamogony, which with second merogony is the most disruptive stage for the intestine in the Eimeria life cycle [1]. The histopathological lesions during gamogony in the ileum include oedema, congestion, haemorrhage, mucosal ulceration, blunting of mucosal ridges and ulceration of the lamina propria\n[6].",

            "text": "An effective response of the local immune system against the Eimeria sporozoites has been recorded for in vitro models, where macrophages reduce the numbers of sporozoites [7]. One indicator of the innate immune response is the synthesis of the acute phase proteins (APPs) that are synthesised in the liver at the beginning of the acute phase of the inflammatory response initiated by infection, neoplasia or tissue destruction [8]. The initial location or cause of the inflammation cannot be determined with APP measurements, but the magnitude of the increase correlates with the extent and acuteness of the inflammation [9]. Most studies concentrate on the changes in haptoglobin (Hp), serum amyloid A (SAA) and fibrinogen (Fb), the major acute phase proteins in cattle [10]. In calves, research has concentrated on experimental and natural respiratory infections, where the association with the disease and the APPs has been confirmed [11], [12]. Association between diarrhoea and increased APP concentrations or intestinal pathogens and increased APP concentrations has also been studied, but the results are inconclusive [13], [14]. As severe tissue destruction occurs during eimeriosis, the acute phase response would be expected to follow [7].",

The idea of the multiple correspondence analysis is to carry out cross-tabulations of multiple categorical variables simultaneously and explore relationships within a set of categorical variables, resulting in two-dimensional scatterplot summary. In the summary, clusters of points are associated with each other, and clusters furthest from the inter-section of the axes have the strongest internal association [27]. Test values were computed for evaluating variables\u2019 correlation with model dimensions (axes). The test values were considered to be the standardised coordinates and were interpreted as the number of standard deviations from the centre of gravity of the analysis. Absolute test values higher than the threshold value of 1.96 were considered to be statistically significant. For the MCA, the Cryptosporidium findings from immunofluorescence staining were used. The MCA was conducted with XLSTAT (Version 2010.4.01, Addinsoft) software.",

The final variable \u201cSigns of diseases\u201d was generated by combining all the individual signs. For forming eimeriosis severity categories three criteria related with Eimeria infection were assessed: presence of diarrhoea, total oocyst count >500 opg in faecal sample and presence of pathogenic Eimeria species (E. bovis or E. zuernii). If no criteria was met no evidence of eimeriosis was recorded (category 1), if one of the criteria was met the evidence of eimeriosis was considered weak (category 2), if two criteria were met the evidence was considered moderate (category 3), and if all three criteria were met the evidence were considered strong (category 4).",

When building the variable for Eimeria related signs, different cut-off limits for coccidia oocyst counts were investigated. In a cross-sectional study we can expect to find animals harbouring different stages of Eimeria in the intestine, resulting in varying and possibly low numbers of excreted oocysts in the faeces. A relatively low cut-off point at 500 opg of total oocyst count (modified from Mundt et al. [4]) provided the most reasonable categorisation, when combined with the information on the presence of pathogenic or non-pathogenic Eimeria spp. and the presence of diarrhoea.",

Although the Eimeria sporozoites and merozoites exist only briefly in the lumen of the intestine or are intracellular, thus attempting to evade the immune system, they are capable of inducing an innate immune response [7] and also haematological changes [41], revealing a systemic response. Studies exploring the acute phase response and Eimeria are few. A positive acute phase response and a pro-inflammatory cytokine response have been reported in experimentally induced caprine coccidiosis [42], supporting the existence of systemic response at least in experimental studies. In the current study with natural infection in calves, farms with known coccidia problems might have been more likely to participate in the study. However, this possible bias should not affect the relationship between Hp and eimeriosis.",

            "text": "As the decreased Hp concentration was associated only with milder signs of eimeriosis, the association is not probably directly related to the inflammation process, but is more a reflection of Hp's action as a haemoglobin scavenger [43]. Hp exists in blood at very low concentrations, when no inflammation process is in progress [8]. Eimeria merozoites induce haemorrhaging injuries on the wall of the intestine [6], resulting in haemolysis and excessive amounts of haemoglobin in the tissues. Hp binds to haemoglobin, thus decreasing the amount of measurable Hp determined by the haemoglobin binding method used in this study. Arthington et al. [44] discovered an unexpected and unexplained decrease in Hp concentrations when exploring how transporting and commingling calves affects the acute phase response, and initial decrease in Hp concentration was also observed in the early phase of experimental E. coli mastitis [45]. Hp binding to haemoglobin could explain these observations, as minor, haemorrhaging injuries or haemolysis can occur in these stressful situations or in the early phase of inflammation, where vascular permeability increases.",

The calves classified \u201chealthy\u201d had increased SAA concentration, the mean close to the upper reference value of healthy calves [48]. The difference between APP concentrations of healthy and diseased calves is hard to detect when it is small. Our group of \u201chealthy\u201d includes some calves with some of the respiratory infection signs (temperature >39.5 \u00b0C, respiratory rate >40/min, or increased respiratory sounds). The concentrations of SAA, sensitive to inflammation, might be affected by these minor signs of illness, as the models with Hp and Fb functioned despite the slightly indistinct definition of healthy. Absence of apparent disease is not equal to health, as reviewed by Gunnarsson [49], but for simplicity the term was used in this study. Using the current study design the onset, duration and acuteness of the inflammation were unclear, which increased the dispersion of the APP measurements.",
