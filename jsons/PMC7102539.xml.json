It is classified as a type of RNA virus, belonging to the family of coronaviruses, which primarily leads to a respiratory system infection. One of the primary findings for COVID-19 is pneumonia.1, 2, 3 Although the exact origin of COVID-19 remains unknown, the first reported cases were all linked to the Huanan (Southern China) Seafood Wholesale Market where wild animals (such as bats) were sold illegally.2, 3, 4 Evidence has also been found that it can be transmitted from human to human through respiratory droplets, contact and even via fecal-oral transmission.3, 4, 5, 6\n",

The CT features including ground glass opacity (GGO) and mixed GGO, consolidation were evaluated. Lesion size was described as grade 1 (diameter, <1 cm), grade 2 (diameter, 1\u20133 cm), grade 3 (diameter, 3 cm to 50% of the segment), or grade 4 (over 50% of the segment) according to the previously described methods.16 Each segment was reviewed and scored. Then a total pulmonary infiltration score was calculated, that is to say, the sum of scores of all the 18 pulmonary segments was used. The number of affected lung lobes and segments were also counted. The location of the lesion was considered as peripheral if it was in the outer one-third of the lung; otherwise, it was considered as central. Other radiological patterns were also evaluated.",

In our study, 17 out of 149 (11.4%) of our patients had normal chest CT on admission and 12 remained negative 10 days later. This finding suggests that a normal chest CT scan cannot exclude the diagnosis of COVID-19. Therefore, clinicians et radiologists should still suspect patients with typical symptoms, such as fever, cough, lymphopenia, and exposure history, and give them an RT-PCR test.",

Two RT-PCR tests were performed on February 4th and 7th and both results were negative. The CT images of February 7th showed a decrease in density of the pulmonary lesions. On the CT examination of February 15th, the lesions were absorbed and the patient was discharged.
