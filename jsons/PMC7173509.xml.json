At various locations throughout the tract, extraintestinal substances are added to the ingesta. These include saliva that contains electrolytes such as sodium, potassium, calcium, magnesium, chloride, bicarbonate, phosphate, and iodine, mucus, which serves as a lubricant, antibacterial compounds such as thiocyanate and hydrogen peroxide, secretory immunoglobulin A, epidermal growth factor (EGF) and the digestive enzymes \u03b1-amylase, lipase, and kallikrein.

            "text": "The esophagus is a muscular tube that passes through the neck and thorax and connects the oral cavity with the stomach. It secretes a lubricating mucus to aid in the passage of ingesta. The lining epithelium is keratinized in swine, equids, ruminants, rats, and mice and nonkeratinized in carnivores and humans. The epithelial cell turnover rate is 5\u20138 days. The muscularis is striated in ruminants and dogs, smooth in equids (distal third) that are unable to vomit, and variably mixed in other species. Mice and rats, that have primarily striated muscle in their esophagus, are also unable to vomit (Treuting et al., 2011). This is principally due to a limiting fold separating the nonglandular from the glandular stomach and diaphragmatic crura that cannot be contracted independently of each other to allow propulsion of contents. Submucosal mucus glands are present throughout the esophagus in swine, dogs, and humans and at the pharyngeal junction in cats, equids, and ruminants. A serosa is absent in all but the abdominal portion of the esophagus. Because the serosa is composed of collagen, it is crucial in holding sutures. Therefore, esophageal resection is seldom attempted and rarely successful. The strong muscular contractions of the esophagus, together with its poor blood supply and lack of serosa, mean that healing from caustic or penetrating wounds renders a poor prognosis for a functional return to normalcy. Insofar as therapy for caustic toxin ingestion what burns going down will also burn coming back up, so generally speaking induction of vomition is contraindicated (Gelberg, 2013).",

            "text": "The contracted musculature of the upper esophageal sphincter relaxes to permit movement of the swallowed bolus into the proximal portion of the esophagus. After the bolus passes, the sphincter regains its previous tone. Relaxation of the sphincter and subsequent restoration of tone require precise control by regulatory systems that may be disrupted by toxins. When the bolus has entered the upper esophagus, an aborally progressing front of contraction of the circular muscle layer begins at the top of the esophageal body, seemingly as a continuation or extension of the forceful contraction of the upper esophageal sphincter that follows its relaxation (Conklin and Christensen, 1994). A ring of contraction above the swallowed bolus moves down the esophagus, propelling the bolus toward the stomach. While the bolus is still progressing through the mid-portion of the esophagus, the contracted ring of circular muscle that forms the lower esophageal sphincter relaxes and is completely relaxed by the time the bolus reaches the gastroesophageal junction. The bolus traverses the lower esophageal sphincter and drops into the stomach. The proximal stomach (fundus and upper corpus) often relaxes, while the swallowed bolus is still in the esophageal body and has not yet passed the lower esophageal sphincter (receptive relaxation). After the bolus has entered the stomach, the fundus and corpus muscles relax so that a large volume can be stored in the upper stomach without significantly increasing intragastric pressure (accommodation). As the volume in the stomach increases, a subjective sensation of satiation develops (Burks and Villar, 1980). In view of the importance of loss of body weight as a sign of chemical toxicity, it is surprising that so little attention has been devoted to disordered sensory perception of gastric fullness as a mechanism of toxicity.",

Although the cause of ulcers, other than caustic agents and those caused by bacteria that can survive the extremely low pH of the stomach (Helicobacter spp.), is imprecisely understood, conditions necessary for ulcer development include local disturbances or trauma to the mucosal epithelial barrier, normal or high gastric acidity, and local disturbances to blood flow, including stress-induced and sympathetic-nervous-system-mediated arteriovenous shunts leading to ischemia. These physiologic changes allow pepsin and HCl into the submucosa where they cause chemical erosion of the protective epithelium. In addition, exogenous or endogenous steroids and nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) depress prostaglandin (PG) E1 and E2 decreasing phospholipid secretions that are gastroprotective. Gastric ulcers induced by alcohol consumption are dose related with effects ranging from a decrease in mucus production and bicarbonate secretion to leakage of bicarbonate and electrolytes to vascular damage (Rousseaux and Haschek, 2010). Anecdotal evidence suggests that a propensity towards ulcer formation may be hereditable (Gelberg, 2016). A partial listing of ulcerogenic chemicals is in Table 3\n.",

Norepinephrine, adenosine triphosphate, and neuropeptide-Y are vasoconstrictors released directly onto blood vessels by the sympathetic nervous system. Vasoactive intestinal polypeptide (VIP) and substance P may be the primary vasodilator substances released from enteric motor neurons. Calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) and substance P are thought to be released from sensory neurons (Holzer et al., 1994). Capsaicin may cause initial release, then depletion, of the peptide neurotransmitters, substance P, and CGRP. At high concentrations, capsaicin causes neuronal degeneration (Buck and Burks, 1986, Buck et al., 1982b, Holzer, 1991). Topical application of capsaicin to gastric mucosa causes dilation of submucosal arterioles, presumably by initial release of peptides from sensory neurons (Chen et al., 1992). Prior treatment with a neurotoxic (peptide-depleting) dose of capsaicin blocks the vasodilator response. CGRP appears to be the principal neural mediator of gastric mucosal hyperemia (Holzer et al., 1994) and is therefore associated with alimentary mucosal protection (Lippe et al., 1989). The vasodilator and hyperemic effects of CGRP appear to be mediated by nitric oxide (Holzer et al., 1993, Peskar et al., 1991). Endogenous nitric oxide also mediates the vasodilation that accompanies acid secretion (Holzer et al., 1994).",

As a result, large intestinal enterocytes absorb sodium ions more completely than in the small intestine (Spainhour, 2007). The cecal and colonic walls do not have a continuous layer of longitudinal smooth muscle. The proximal 85% of the colon is therefore incapable of peristaltic contractions. Because the circular muscle is intact, rhythmic segmentation is present. Rhythmic segmentation allows retropulsion but not peristalsis allowing the colon to function as a storage organ (Saur, 2010).

Notch pathways are used by cells (i.e., cell\u2013cell communication) to regulate, via their genes, cell differentiation processes that occur during embryonic and adult life. Enterocyte notch pathways influence whether intestinal epithelial stem cells differentiate into cells with secretory or absorptive functions. These pathways involve typical ligand\u2013receptor interactions where the ligand is a transmembrane protein expressed in one cell type that binds with a notch receptor (i.e., notch protein) present on/in the cell membrane of another cell type. This binding interaction results in modifications of gene expression in the cell expressing the receptor, such as facilitating its differentiation into an absorptive enterocyte. This ligand\u2013receptor binding appears to result in cells organizing into groups of cell types as needed for their differentiation into specific tissues and organs. (Gelberg, 2016). A combination of Notch and Wnt signals is necessary for proliferation of enterocyte precursors, but differentiation of cell types is independent of Wnt. Wnt and Notch synergy appears to induce intestinal adenomas (Fre et al., 2009).",

Enteroendocrine (argentaffin, enterochromaffin) cells produce a large variety of hormones that are delivered directly into the bloodstream (Table 4\n). These hormones are generated via posttranslational processing of prohormones. Often, more than one molecular form exhibits biological activity. For example, human progastrin consists of 80 amino acids and is cleaved to two biologically active forms, gastrin-34 and gastrin-17. Even smaller fragments of gastrin retain biological activity. Cholecystokinin (CCK) exists in even more biologically active forms. The 115 amino acid precursor peptide is cleaved by endopeptidases to produce CCK-58, CCK-39, CCK-33, CCK-22, CCK-11, and CCK-8, all of which have CCK activity (Reeve et al., 1986). The C-terminal pentapeptide of CCK is identical to that of gastrin and retains gastrin-like activity. Gastrin and CCK are released from gastric or intestinal mucosa, respectively, by ingestion of food. Gastrin acts in the oxyntic area of the stomach to stimulate acid secretion. CCK acts at the gallbladder to produce contractions that stimulate bile flow into the intestinal lumen thus stimulating pancreatic enzyme secretion. CCK has been proposed as a major mediator of the satiety response that leads to cessation of feeding (Della-Fera and Baile, 1979). Endocrine disrupters and other toxicities resulting from increases or decreases in production, processing, gastrin, or CCK release may have effects on gastric acid secretion, digestion, fat absorption, gallbladder contraction, rate of gastric emptying, growth of gastrointestinal mucosa, or appetite.",

These cells include lymphocytes, macrophages, neutrophils, eosinophils, basophils, and mast cells. Some lymphocytes also occupy spaces between epithelial cells. Follicular lymphoid aggregates, Peyer\u2019s patches, are present in the mucosa. The mucosal immune system is functionally and operationally distinct in several ways from the systemic immune system. In contrast to systemic humoral immunity, IgA is the predominate immunoglobulin generated in the mucosa. Additionally, mucosal lymphocytes have surface markers that are activated relative to the peripheral blood and the systemic immune system.",

Immune mediators may alter local blood flow and vascular permeability, activate or inhibit intrinsic nerves, alter epithelial cell transport, or are cytotoxic. Some of these immune mediators are cytokines, arachidonic acid derivatives, and amines (e.g., histamine and 5-hydroxytryptamine). Cytokines are peptide mediators released from immune and epithelial cells that activate other immune cells to release mediators, induce chemotaxis, or induce phagocytosis. Macrophages and neutrophils are the cell types most often involved in phagocytosis. The phagocytic activity of these cells is linked to the release of a number of catabolic enzymes (acid hydrolases, neutral proteases, acid phosphatase, lysozyme, and peroxidase), along with superoxide free radicals, arachidonic acid metabolites, and other cytotoxic molecules (Shanahan and Johnson, 1994, Tanner et al., 1984). An increase in intestinal macrophages is often present in inflammatory bowel disease (Shanahan and Johnson, 1994). Macrophages are abundant in granulomas and are a hallmark of Crohn\u2019s disease.",

            "text": "Within the mucosa there is bidirectional communication between intrinsic nerves and mast cells. In the guinea pig colon, histamine causes a recurrent pattern of chloride secretion mediated by activation of histamine receptors and stimulation of cholinergic secretomotor neurons (Cooke et al., 1993). Antigen challenge in sensitized animals may result in release of substance P and CGRP from sensory nerves (Castro and Arntzen, 1993). These neurotransmitters can cause mast cells to release histamine. Histamine causes cholinergic motor neurons to induce muscle contractions or alterations in epithelial ion transport (Castro et al., 1994). Mast cell histamine release affects epithelial transport of water and electrolytes via direct actions on epithelial cells and indirectly by effects on intrinsic nerves (Castro et al., 1987). Histamine induces a recurrent pattern of chloride secretion from mucosal crypt cells and contractions of smooth muscle (Cooke et al., 1993). In addition to histamine, 5-hydroxy-tryptamine (5-HT) released from enterochromaffin cells and myenteric neurons, as well as mast cells in some rodents, may contribute to mucosal chloride secretion (Cooke et al., 1991). Chloride secretion results in a net transfer of salt and water to the gastrointestinal lumen (Cooke et al., 1993). The actions of 5-HT appear to be indirect and result from release of acetylcholine that acts directly upon mucosal crypt cells. Evidence indicates that 5-HT can induce electrogenic chloride secretion in human jejunal mucosa by direct effects on crypt cells (Kellum et al., 1994). Both the direct effects of 5-HT and histamine on epithelial cells and the indirect effects mediated by cholinergic motor neurons may be augmented and amplified by prostaglandins and other substances released during immune responses or inflammation (Sidhu and Cooke, 1995).",

Pinocytosis is similar to phagocytosis and is selective or nonselective in transporting liquids into cells depending on the involvement of cell surface receptors. This method occurs in association with M cells and is especially effective in neonates and decreases with age. This process is useful for absorbing immunoglobulins but is exploited by some toxins, bacteria, and other xenobiotics. Cadmium, ferritin, and nutrients utilize this pathway.

In general, the cytochrome P450 oxidative enzymes are the most important in terms of chemical biotransformation. While it is not known if all cytochrome P450 isozymes are present in enterocytes (Gelboin, 1993), it is clear that most isozymes occur in the intestine (Watkins, 1992). Enterocytic cytochrome P450 activity increases as the cells mature during their migration from crypt to villus. Nearly all cytochrome P450 activity is attributable to villus cells. NADPH cytochrome P450 reductase, a necessary component for the activity of all cytochrome P450 enzymes, is constitutively expressed only in villus cells (Traber et al., 1992).

Agangliosis and dysautonomia, malfunctions of the cranial nerves, spinal nerves, ganglia, and/or autonomic nervous system may have profound influences on intestinal motility. There are a great variety of agents that cause these changes ranging from botulinum toxin to inflammatory diseases. Many cases are idiopathic or may be hereditary. In addition, there is a bidirectional neurohormonal interchange between intestinal microbiota and the brain. Thus, alteration of the microbiota may result in changes in the gut\u2013brain axis (Collins et al., 2010). Dysbiosis has effects on early brain development in mice, irritable bowel syndrome, Crohn\u2019s disease, ulcerative colitis, demyelination in multiple sclerosis, hepatic encephalopathy, and psychiatric disorders such as early-onset autism. The interstitial cells of Cajal are of mesenchymal origin and are the pacemakers of the gut. Inflammation, neoplasia, or loss of these cells affect coordinated movement of the alimentary system.",

Enteric neuromediators and gliomediators modulate intestinal epithelial barrier functions such as paracellular permeability, epithelial cell proliferation, and wound healing (Fig. 11\n). Phenotypical changes in enteric neurons and glial cells are present in certain diseases, but the mechanisms are poorly understood. The neurons and glial cells are organized into two plexi; myenteric (Auerbach\u2019s) and submucosal (Meissner\u2019s). Myenteric plexi regulate GI motor function, while submucosal plexi regulate mucosal processes. Each villus and colonic unit is innervated by 70\u201392 submucosal neurons (Song et al., 1995). The enteric nervous system can perform these functions in the absence of the CNS, but the CNS can have an effect on enteric neurons (Fig. 12\n). The enteric nervous system along with the microflora, the immune system, and fibroblasts help maintain the integrity of the intestinal epithelial barrier.",

            "text": "Emesis is associated with rapidly progressive orad propulsion of small intestinal and gastric contents as well as coordinated respiratory, postural, and subjective correlates. Emesis is orchestrated by the diffuse vomiting center in the brainstem that initiates retrograde contractions that typically begin in the mid-portion of the small intestine and migrate orally at a rate of 8\u201310 cm s\u2212 1 (Lang et al., 1986, Stewart et al., 1977). Retching movements begin when the wave of retrograde propulsion reaches the stomach. Immediately afterward, the intercostal and diaphragmatic muscles contract to increase intraabdominal pressure, respiration is reflexively inhibited, and the gastric contents are expelled through the oral cavity. While aspiration of vomitus does not often occur in conscious subjects, it can occur any time, especially in those with impaired consciousness such as those under anesthesia. Aspiration is very hazardous particularly if the vomitus contains toxic substances (petroleum products, caustic materials) in addition to the usual potentially damaging content of acid, pepsin, bile, pancreatic enzymes, and microorganisms. Emesis and nausea, which may or may not accompany emesis, can be elicited by both peripheral and central stimuli. In humans, unpleasant sights or smells may be sufficient to trigger emesis. Activation of dopamine D2 receptors in the chemoreceptor trigger zone or in the vomiting (emetic) center, activation of 5-HT3 receptors at peripheral vagal sensory pathways, gastritis or gastroenteritis, vection sickness, and other causes can initiate emesis. It is presumed that emesis is largely a protective reflex, designed to empty the upper gastrointestinal tract of toxic substances. Induction of emesis remains a mainstay of treatment of acute ingestion of poisons with the exception of caustic agents that burn mucosa. Examples of emetic agents are in Table 5\n.",

Examples include alcohol (Fig. 16\n) and other organic solvents, aspirin-like drugs (Fig. 17\n), bile acids, sodium chloride, and certain constituents of edible plants. High concentrations of ethyl alcohol (> 40%) can cause direct damage to esophageal and gastric epithelial cell membranes. Alcohol disorders the lipids in the outer bilayer of membranes and may increase their fluidity (Geall et al., 1970). Changes in membrane order lead to cell damage that can be measured as a decrease of transmucosal potential difference (Svanes et al., 1982). Bile acids, aspirin, and salicylate exhibit similar effects (Black et al., 1973, Kasbekar, 1973). Aspirin and salicylate can alter production of prostanoids, products of the cyclooxygenase pathway of arachidonic acid metabolism (Fig. 18\n). Exposure of the gastric mucosa to a high concentration of alcohol is associated with increased synthesis of prostaglandins and prostacyclin (Smith et al., 1991). However, the prostanoid substances may help counteract alcohol-induced injury because treatment with indomethacin exacerbates alcohol-induced damage. Other eicosanoids such as leukotriene A4 may participate in alcohol-induced cell damage since inhibitors of leukotriene synthesis reduce the disruption caused by alcohol (French, 1991). Thus, prostaglandins may protect the gastric mucosa from ethanol damage, while leukotrienes contribute to the damage. Depletion of intracellular glutathione (GSH) has also been implicated in alcohol injury to mucosal cells (Hauser and Szabo, 1991, Victor et al., 1991). The levels of GSH decline in proportion to the degree of alcohol injury and treatment with prostaglandin E2 can mitigate alcohol injury. N-ethylmaleimide prevents prostaglandin-induced protection against alcohol injury.",

            "text": "A single alcohol drinking binge causes a rapid increase in serum endotoxin, bacterial translocation from the intestine, and a prolonged increase in circulation of acute phase proteins. The increased endotoxin levels are associated with increased levels of inflammatory cytokines such TNF-\u03b1 and IL-6, and the chemokine (monocyte chemotactic protein) MCP-1 (Bala et al., 2014). Chronic administration of alcohol is associated with enhanced expression of a number of growth factors, including EGF and transforming growth factor-alpha (TGF-\u03b1). These growth factors are thought to protect the gastric mucosa against acute injury and may explain the observation that adaptation of the gastric mucosa to chronic alcohol administration is associated with increased cell proliferation and increased expression of mucosal EGF and TGF-\u03b1 (Tarnawski et al., 1992). The ability of chronic alcohol exposure to lead to hyperregeneration of the gastric mucosa could be responsible for the suspected carcinogenic effect of alcohol (Simanowski et al., 1995). Generation of acetaldehyde, in addition to elaboration of growth factors, has also been implicated suggesting a potential role of gastric mucosal alcohol dehydrogenase (ADH) in the deleterious effects of alcohol on gastrointestinal mucosa. The human gastric mucosa contains three isoforms of ADH, and enzyme activity is inversely correlated with age and is higher in males than in females (Moreno and Pares, 1991, Moreno et al., 1994). However the overall contribution of gastric ADH to metabolism of alcohol and generation of acetaldehyde is thought to be slight (Brown et al., 1995, Gugler, 1994, Levitt et al., 1994).",

The toxic effects of lectins are dependent on their source, species, and dose. Their potential effects range from depression of growth to lethality (Reddy and Hayes, 1989). The toxicity of ingested lectins often involves their binding to the luminal surface of mucosal epithelial cells where they disturb the function of the brush border membrane (Nakata and Kimura, 1985). Binding of lectins to crypt cells is followed by nonspecific inhibition of both active and passive absorption of all nutrients, including water, across the intestinal mucosa. Inhibition of absorption appears to account for growth depression. Lectins can also cause necrosis of intestinal epithelial cells (King et al., 1980). The mitogenic effects of lectins on lymphocytes can be inhibited by several neuropeptides, including VIP, \u03b2-endorphin, and somatostatin. It is not known whether these peptides protect mucosal cells (Krco et al., 1986).",

Mucosal hyperplasia can also be associated with ingested chemicals, such as 2,3,7,8-tetra-chlorodibenzo-p-dioxin (TCDD) and probably other related polychlorinated dioxins (Pohjanvirta and Tuomisto, 1994). TCDD binds to a cytosolic protein called the Ah receptor (Burbach et al., 1992). TCDD binding converts the receptor to its activated, functional form that binds to the DNA of the CYP 1A1 gene for cytochrome P450. Binding of TCDD to the DNA increases the rate of transcription of the cytochrome P450 gene. The intestinal mucosa contains significant levels of Ah receptors and cytochrome P450 CYP 1A1 (Mason and Okey, 1982). TCDD can induce mucosal hyperplasia in some animal species. It has been suggested to exert a disinhibitory effect on gastrin release, which may explain the mucosal hyperplasia (Potter et al., 1983). It also induces a \u201cwasting syndrome\u201d that is characterized by failure of appetite (Pohjanvirta and Tuomisto, 1994). Hypophagia and severe weight loss are the principal signs in most species of TCDD intoxication. Most animals given lethal doses of TCDD die within 2 weeks. Those that live longer often develop tumors (Pohjanvirta and Tuomisto, 1994).",

Antineoplastic agents are used in clinical oncology because the drugs are inherently toxic and are designed to kill host cells (O\u2019Keefe and Harris, 1990). The toxic effects of many members of this class of agents occur in tissues with high growth fractions, such as gastrointestinal epithelium. In general, the alkylating agents, such as nitrogen mustards (melphalan, cyclophosphamide, and chlorambucil) are the most highly toxic to dividing mucosal cells. These agents cause mitotic arrest, cellular hypertrophy, disintegration of epithelial cells, and sloughing of the epithelium. In high-dose chemotherapy protocols they can predispose to bacterial sepsis of the gastrointestinal tract. The nitrogen mustard drugs alkylate DNA and thereby interfere with DNA synthesis and cell division (Chabner et al., 1996). These drugs are most cytotoxic to rapidly proliferating tissues in which a large proportion of the cells are dividing.",

Methotrexate inhibits dihydrofolate reductase and interferes with folate-dependent enzymes required for synthesis of purines and thymidylate. Methotrexate is toxic to all rapidly dividing normal cells including those of the intestinal epithelium. The drug can induce swelling and cytoplasmic vacuolation of epithelial cells within 6 h followed by enterocyte loss and leukocyte infiltration into the submucosa. Mucositis (inflammation) peaks several days after drug administration. Animal studies indicate that methotrexate is extremely toxic to the gastrointestinal tract if elemental liquid diets are the only source of enteral nutrition. It is believed that elemental diets change the pharmacokinetics of methotrexate or further diminish epithelial cell turnover rates (McAnena et al., 1987). Methotrexate-induced gastrointestinal toxicity is also enhanced dramatically in mice by aspirin-like drugs (Badr and Chen, 1985). Interestingly, transgenic mice carrying a mutant dihydrofolate reductase gene display resistance to methotrexate toxicity to the gastrointestinal tract (Isola and Gordon, 1986).",

Two weeks after treatment with BAC, the number of muscle cells in both the longitudinal and circular muscle layers returns nearly to control values. The damage to nerves is more persistent. It has not been determined whether ingested surface active agents penetrate the mucosal barrier to induce nerve or muscle damage.

            "text": "Capsaicin, the pungent ingredient in many hot peppers and paprika, produces striking pharmacological effects on sensory neurons in the gastrointestinal tract and elsewhere (Buck and Burks, 1986). Capsaicin occurs naturally in many pepper plants related to Capsicum annuum, which grows indigenously in tropical America. Capsicum has been used globally in food for 7000 years (M\u00f3zsik et al., 2007) and is especially popular in hot climates where normal dietary intake may reach 1 mg kg\u2212 1 daily (Szallasi, 1995). The popularity of capsaicin-containing foods in hot climates has been attributed to its ability to cause profuse perspiration, termed gustatory sweating (Lee, 1954). A related compound, resiniferatoxin, was first isolated from Euphorbia resinifera, an African plant, but rarely is ingested as food or condiment. Capsaicin activates small diameter sensory nerve fibers in the mucosa and wall of the gastrointestinal tract to induce, especially in the oral mucosa, the sensation of heat, and pungency associated with spicy foods. Activation of sensory neurons by capsaicin promotes release of neurotransmitters from both the central and peripheral terminals of these neurons. The neurotransmitters released are principally substance P and CGRP. The peptides initiate a cascade of proinflammatory events and transmit nociceptive information to the central nervous system (Buck and Burks, 1986). Repeated exposure leads to diminished effects. In high concentrations, capsaicin and related compounds can produce disruption of neural function and eventual destruction of sensory nerves in sensitive species. (Buck et al., 1981, Buck et al., 1982a, Miller et al., 1982a). The neurotoxicity of capsaicin and related compounds appears to be related to blockage of retrograde transport of nerve growth factor (Holzer, 1991, Miller et al., 1982b). The covalent binding of tritium-labeled capsaicin to hepatic microsomal protein is significantly inhibited by reduced glutathione, implying the formation of a reactive intermediate during metabolism of capsaicin (Miller et al., 1983). Cytochrome P450 2E1 catalyzes the conversion of capsaicin to a reactive species capable of covalent binding to tissue macromolecules (Surh and Lee, 1995). However, no long-lasting deleterious effects on gastrointestinal sensory neurons have been documented in humans, even in those who ingest large amounts of capsaicin daily. Animal studies, on the other hand, indicate that intragastric capsaicin, even in moderate doses, can produce changes in gastrointestinal function. For example, intragastric doses of 0.1 mg kg\u2212 1 of capsaicin in dogs produces pronounced excitatory effects on colon contractions (Shibata et al., 1995). The contractile effects of intragastric capsaicin in the colon are inhibited by a muscarinic antagonist implying that a cholinergic neural pathway is involved. It is possible that low intragastric concentrations of capsaicin can activate sensory nerves that signal fullness to the brain and thereby initiate the gastrocolic reflex generally associated with ingestion of a meal (Barber et al., 1987).",

CB receptors are largely distributed in the enteric nervous system (Duncan et al., 2005). Both CB1 and CB2 receptors are on enteric neurons, nerve fibers, and terminals. The CB1 receptor is most dense in the myenteric and submucosal plexi (Duncan et al., 2005, Wright et al., 2008). Enteric ganglia consist of motor neurons, interneurons, and intrinsic primary afferent neurons; CB1 and CB2 receptors are on all of the functional classes of enteric neurons (Izzo et al., 2010). CB1 and CB2 receptors are not present on inhibitory motor neurons containing nitric oxide synthase (Kulkarni-Narfa and Brown, 2000; Coutts et al., 2002, Storr et al., 2004, Duncan et al., 2008).",

            "text": "The most common and usually most serious toxic effects of NSAIDs are damage to the gastrointestinal tract (Carson and Willett, 1993). The gastrointestinal toxicity of NSAIDs is dose related and increases with age over 60 years (Carson and Willett, 1993, Roderick et al., 1993). Fifteen to twenty percent of patients who regularly take these agents develop esophageal, gastric, or duodenal ulcers. Approximately 3% develop bowel hemorrhage or perforation (Lanza, 1993). In equids, and humans, colonic ulcers may occur. NSAIDs increase the risk of lower GI bleeding and perforation similar to that of the upper GI tract (Sostres et al., 2013). While the gastric and duodenal mucosa are the most frequent targets of NSAID toxicity, lesions in other areas of the small intestine and colon occur (Kirsch, 1994). NSAIDs can induce peptic ulcers, petechiae, blood and protein loss into the gastrointestinal lumen, localized strictures, and bowel wall perforation (Bjarnason et al., 1993). The mechanisms of NSAIDs-induced mucosal damage are complex resulting in reduction in mucosal blood flow and direct and indirect damage to epithelial cells (Fig. 18). NSAID-induced mucosal damage follows a 6 h time course: early, neutrophil-independent toxicity and late, neutrophil-dependent toxicity (Nygard et al., 1994). Early changes include alterations in mitochondrial oxidative functions and inhibition of cyclooxygenase (COX). Death is generally from cardiopulmonary disease, terminal cancer, or multiorgan failure (Lanas, 2010).",

Energy depletion leads to disruption of ATP-dependent epithelial cell junctions increasing intestinal epithelial permeability. The increase in permeability and diminution of epithelial barrier functions allow exposure to bile acids, hydrogen ions, and bacteria. Formyl-methionyl-leucyl-phenylalanine (FMLP), a peptide released from bacteria, attracts and activates neutrophils (Granger et al., 1988). Bacteria in the GI lumen increase the ulcerogenicity of NSAIDs (Rainsford, 1989). Activated neutrophils attracted to the mucosal microvessels and lamina propria release reactive oxygen metabolites (ROMs), lysosomal proteases, and leukotriene B4 (Granger et al., 1994). Myeloperoxidase, a hemoprotein peroxidase release by activated neutrophils into the extracellular medium, interacts with H2O2 to form an enzyme substrate complex with great oxidizing potential. Activated neutrophils produce large quantities of OCl\u2212 by means of myeloperoxidase catalyzed oxidation of Cl\u2212 (Granger et al., 1988). HOCl is a powerful oxidizing agent. ROMs and lysosomal enzymes cause direct damage to epithelial cells. Leukotriene B4 released by neutrophils is a powerful chemoattractant for additional neutrophils. In addition, leukotriene B4 causes arteriolar vasoconstriction. As a result of this cascade, gastrointestinal epithelial cells become targets for bile acids, hydrogen ion, ROMs, and lysosomal enzymes.",

            "text": "The other pathway of NSAID toxicity that results in the reduction of mucosal blood flow and damage to epithelial cells is the ability of these drugs to inhibit COX. COX, the first enzyme in the prostaglandin synthetic pathway, converts arachidonic acid to unstable intermediates, cyclic endoperoxides PGG, and PGH. PGG and PGH can be transformed to prostaglandins, such as PGE2, thromboxane A2, or prostacyclin. Blockade of COX reduces formation of these prostanoids and shifts metabolism of arachidonic acid toward the lipoxygenase pathway, resulting in the formation of leukotrienes, most notably leukotriene C4 and B4. There are two major isoforms of COX, COX-1 and COX-2, which differ in their sensitivity to inhibition by individual NSAIDs (Meade et al., 1993). COX-1 is the constitutive form of the enzyme found in healthy tissues, while COX-2 is an inducible form that can be stimulated by several cytokines and inflammatory mediators (Mitchell et al., 1993). Most NSAIDs inhibit activity of both COX isoforms. Inhibition of COX-2 is associated with most of the beneficial effects of NSAIDs, while inhibition of COX-1 is associated with many of their adverse effects. Drugs that preferentially inhibit COX-2 may have fewer side effects than those that inhibit both isoforms (Meade et al., 1993). Inhibition of COX by NSAIDs results in two significant toxicological effects: reduction of formation of prostaglandins and increased formation of leukotrienes. Prostaglandins protect the gastrointestinal mucosa against luminal acid and other aggressive factors (Leung et al., 1989). The protective effects result from the ability of prostaglandins to stimulate secretion of mucus and bicarbonate (Eberhart and Dubois, 1995, Sababi et al., 1995). Reduction in mucosal synthesis of prostaglandins, including prostacyclin, is associated with mucosal damage (Whittle and Vane, 1984). Prostaglandin E2 and prostacyclin are also vasodilators. Blockade of prostaglandin and prostacyclin synthesis may favor vasoconstriction and oppose prostaglandin-mediated tonic vasodilation. Increased metabolism of arachidonic acid by the 5-lipoxigenase pathway in the presence of inhibition of COX is thought to contribute to NSAID-induced gastrointestinal toxicity (Peskar et al., 1986). Leukotrienes C4 and D4 are vasoconstrictors, and leukotriene B4 is a powerful chemoattractant of neutrophils (Bjarnason et al., 1993, Eberhart and Dubois, 1995). Leukotriene B4-stimulated attraction and activation of neutrophils lead to release of lysosomal enzymes and microvascular occlusion. Epithelial cell damage is exacerbated by reduction in mucosal blood flow via a combination of vasoconstriction caused by leukotrienes and occlusion of microvessels by neutrophils (Kitahora and Guth, 1987). Thus, NSAIDs reduce production of protecting substances and increase production of damaging substances. The theoretical advantage of selective inhibitors of COX is their lack of effect on COX-1 and endogenously generated prostaglandins and prostacyclins (Levi and Shaw-Smith, 1994, Seibert and Masferrer, 1994, Seibert et al., 1994). Preservation of prostaglandin and prostacyclin production protects the mucosa via bicarbonate and mucus production, mucosal restitution, and regenerative repair and helps maintain mucosal blood flow. Prostaglandins also decrease secretion of gastric acid by direct effects on oxyntic cell prostaglandin receptors, and lower concentrations of acid at the mucosal surface enhance mucosal restitution (Allen et al., 1993). However, reduction of acid secretion alone is not sufficient to counteract the damaging effects of NSAIDs (Ivey, 1988, Wallace et al., 1993).",

The best characterized of the mucosal sensory emetic pathways involves activation of 5-HT3 receptors at the peripheral ends of sensory nerves (Miller and Nonaka, 1992). 5-HT3 receptors are ligand-gated ion channels that mediate rapid nerve depolarization including sensory nerves. The vagus nerve is dense with 5-HT3 receptors and innervates most abdominal viscera, including the gastric and duodenal mucosae (Ireland and Tyres, 1987). Toxic chemicals can act either directly or indirectly at 5-HT3 receptors to activate sensory nerves or act at other (non-5-HT3) sites on nerve endings. Certain anticancer drugs, especially the highly emetogenic agents such as cyclophosphamide, carmustine, dactinomycin, and cisplatin, interact with mucosal enterochromaffin cells to promote release of large quantities of 5-HT (Miller and Nonaka, 1992). The 5-HT acts at 5-HT3 receptors on mucosal sensory nerves to initiate emetic signals. Bilateral abdominal vagotomy and bilateral splanchnic nerve section completely inhibit emesis induced by cyclophosphamide, nitrogen mustard-N-oxide, and dactinomycin (Fukui et al., 1993). Emesis induced by antineoplastic chemotherapeutic agents can be reduced or prevented by administration of 5-HT3 antagonists, such as granisetron or ondansetron. 5-HT3 antagonists are also effective in blocking emesis induced by irradiation (Smith et al., 1989). However, 5-HT3 antagonists are not effective against other emetogenic substances, such as copper sulfate, protoveratrine, or apomorphine (Andrews and Hawthorn, 1987, Andrews et al., 1988).",

Brainstem 5-HT3 receptors appear to be associated with presynaptic sites and serve primarily to modulate release of neurotransmitters. Presumably, activation of the central 5-HT3 receptors enhances release of proemetic substances, thereby activating the chemoreceptor trigger zone of the area postrema and the nearby emetic center. Several cancer chemotherapeutic agents, most notably cisplatin, appear to act at least in part by effects in the central nervous system that promote release of 5-HT and subsequent activation of 5-HT3 receptors. Combined vagal and splanchnic nerve transections do not completely prevent vomiting in response to peripherally administered cisplatin, whereas emesis is reduced by administration of 5-HT3 antagonists (Miller and Nonaka, 1992).",

Probably the best characterized of such receptors is that for the heat-stable enterotoxin of E. coli (Cohen et al., 1988). The E. coli enterotoxin (Sta) receptor is a novel transmembrane guanylate cyclase with an extracellular toxin-binding domain. It is expressed primarily in the differentiated cells of the villus. Similarly, cholera toxin specifically binds to a GM1-ganglioside receptor located on the enterocyte luminal membrane. Vibrio cholerae enterotoxin is a high-molecular-weight protein complex that binds to receptors that produce ribosylation of the alpha subunit of the Gs GTP-binding protein regulating adenylyl cyclase activity in epithelial cells (Helper and Gilman, 1992, Lai, 1980). This ribosylation prevents the alpha subunit from hydrolyzing bound GTP causing protracted Gs stimulation of adenylyl cyclase leading to sustained elevations in intracellular cAMP (Kimberg et al., 1971). The elevated intracellular cAMP maintains activation of protein kinase A and protein phosphorylation that inhibit intestinal mucosal sodium absorption while stimulating chloride secretion into the intestinal lumen. The sustained activation of adenylyl cyclase results from enterotoxin-induced failure of the Gs regulatory system.",

The enteric nervous system is involved in the mucosal secretory response that produces a large fluid load in the intestinal lumen. Moreover, cholera toxin elicits migrating clustered contractions (also known as migrating action potential complexes) that are also inhibited by drugs that block neural activity. Cholera toxin appears to activate a neuronal pathway from the small intestine to the colon that induces secretion of fluid into the colonic lumen (Nocerino et al., 1995). Persistent activation of adenylyl cyclase results in direct alterations in mucosal fluid and electrolyte transport as well as neurally mediated secretory and propulsive motility alterations.

The gastrointestinal mucosa acts as a barrier to antigen absorption but can itself become the site of hypersensitivity responses. Antigens can enter enterocytes by pinocytosis or by interactions with nutrient transport systems. They can also cross the mucosal barrier by paracellular pathways to interact with immune cells in the lamina propria (Atisook and Madara, 1991). Antigens are usually presented to T-cells by macrophages, B-cells, or enterocytes. The antigen-presenting cells release interleukin 1 (IL-1) which activates T-cells to express IL-2. T-cells, in turn, release a number of interleukins, tumor necrosis factor (TNF-\u03b1), and interferons, including interferon gamma (macrophage activating factor). Activated macrophages in turn release IL-1 that activates immune cells and nerves, IL-6 that activates lymphocytes, IL-8 that attracts neutrophils, colony stimulating factors that activate immune cells, and prostanoid substances (Shanahan and Johnson, 1994). B-cells are stimulated by antigens and interleukins to proliferate and differentiate into plasma cells that synthesize and secrete immunoglobulins (Hoffman and Waston, 1979). Immunoglobulin-E is one of a number of regulators (cytokines, complement C3a) that can activate gastrointestinal mast cells. Mast cells release neurotransmitters (substance P, CGRP), autacoids (histamine), interleukins, chemotactic factors, PAF, and other substances (Fig. 15).",

ROMs are important in inflammation, hypersensitivities, and mucosal ischemia. Activated neutrophils and macrophages are the major sources of superoxide anion radicals, hydroxyl radicals, peroxyl radicals, and hypochlorous acid (Granger et al., 1994). Nitric oxide (NO) is generated by endothelial cells, platelets, neutrophils, macrophages, and neurons (Schemann and Schaff, 1995). ROMs other than NO are generated in the intestinal mucosa primarily in association with phagocytosis by neutrophils and macrophages. Cytokines and related mediators released in association with the immune response activate neutrophils and macrophages and serve as neutrophil chemoattractants. As a result, ROM generation occurs in acute and chronic inflammation. Adverse gastrointestinal responses after chronic exposure to industrial solvents and aldehydes may result from mucosal inflammation (DiPalma et al., 1991). Infiltration of neutrophils and other granulocytes that release ROMs is stimulated by PAF. PAF is formed by a variety of cell types, including endothelial cells, neutrophils, macrophages, and platelets (Lefer, 1989). SOD, desferrioxamine, and dimethylthiourea all result in attenuated increases in mucosal myleoperoxidase by ROM or PAF (Kubes et al., 1990). A role for xanthine oxidase as a source of superoxide radical is indicated by the ability of xanthine oxidase inhibitors, such as allopurinol, to attenuate mucosal myleloperoxidase activity.",

The two major isoforms of NO synthase are a constitutive enzyme that is calcium and calmodulin dependent and an inducible calcium-independent form. The constitutive form is in the endothelium, nerves, and brain. It seems to continuously generate small amounts of NO. The inducible form is in macrophages and probably other tissues such as gastrointestinal and vascular smooth muscle and vascular endothelium (Moncada and Higgs, 1993, Stark and Szurszewski, 1992). When stimulated by appropriate endotoxins, lipopolysaccharides, or cytokines, the inducible isoform can remain active for many hours and large amounts of NO may accumulate. NO is lipophilic and readily crosses plasma membranes to interact with the heme iron of guanylyl cyclase to stimulate formation of cGMP. Increases in intracellular cGMP decrease cytosolic calcium levels, increase potassium conductance, and evoke membrane hyperpolarization in GI smooth muscle cells and nerves (Stark et al., 1991, Tamura et al., 1993). NO relaxes vascular and GI smooth muscle and perhaps functions as a tonic vasodilator and as the major, nonadrenergic, noncholinergic inhibitory neurotransmitter of the enteric nervous system (Boeckxstrens et al., 1991). NO may serve as an important vasoregulator maintaining adequate mucosal blood flow (Stark and Szurszewski, 1992, Toda and Okamura, 1992). NO released by macrophages and neutrophils is toxic to microorganisms and, in excess, to mammalian cells by interacting with iron-containing enzymes essential for cell function. Once released, NO is oxidized successively to nitrite and nitrate. It is destroyed by interaction with superoxide; SOD is protective. NO avidly binds to oxyhemoglobin by interactions with heme iron.",

            "text": "NO protects the GI mucosa, maintains mucosal blood flow, and regulates smooth muscle contractions and propulsion. NO can also cause gastrointestinal toxicity. The dual nature of NO is a function of the two major isoforms of NO synthase. NO produced by the constitutive form of the enzyme produces beneficial effects, while NO produced by the inducible form of the enzyme is often implicated in vascular or epithelial cell injury (Boughton-Smith et al., 1993). NO generated by endotoxin lipopolysaccharide on inducible NO synthase increases vascular permeability and contributes to vascular protein leakage (Boughton-Smith et al., 1993). In trinitrobenzene sulfonic acid (TNBS) induced chronic ileitis in guinea pigs enhanced synthesis of NO promotes neutrophil-associated mucosal injury via increases in myeloperoxidase and loss of serum protein into the inflamed tissue (Miller et al., 1993b). The NO synthase inhibitor, l-NAME, ameliorates this inflammatory response (Miller et al., 1993b). Proinflammatory stimuli suggest that low levels of NO protect the vasculature and mucosa, whereas activation of inducible NO synthase produces large amounts of NO over extended periods of time that result in cytotoxicity (Aiko and Grisham, 1995, Laszlo et al., 1994, Miller et al., 1993a, Salzman, 1995). There is evidence that intestinal injury can lead to activation of inducible pulmonary NO synthase (Turnage et al., 1995). Theoretically, toxic and inflammatory injury to the gastrointestinal tract may be reduced by selective inhibition of the inducible form of NO synthase while maintaining the largely protective activity of the constitutive form of the enzyme.",

However, nitrotyrosine, formed by the interaction of peroxynitrite with tyrosine, can be measured. In experimental ileitis in guinea pigs by TNBS, inducible nitric oxide synthase and nitrotyrosine are localized in large amounts in superficial epithelium encompassing entire villi but not in crypts (Miller et al., 1995). Enteric neurons contain nitrotyrosine and activation of inducible enzyme may be associated with neuronal injury.

Diarrhea induced in rats by castor oil or sodium choleate is blocked by NO synthase inhibitors. Castor oil and bile salts induce mucosal damage, and the damage is intensified by coadministration of NO synthase inhibitors (Capasso et al., 1994). These data suggest that NO mediates, at least in part, the diarrheal effect of these compounds presumably by increasing secretion of fluid into the intestinal lumen. Simultaneously, NO exerts a protective effect on the intestinal mucosa. Bile acids and castor oil directly damage intestinal mucosa and activate the inducible isoform of NO synthase producing large amounts of NO that are linked to production of diarrhea (Gaginella et al., 1995). Administration of NO synthase inhibitors that nonspecifically block both the constitutive inducible isoforms removes the protective effects of NO provided by the constitutive enzyme and exacerbate mucosal damage. Blockade of the inducible enzyme inhibits excessive NO production responsible for diarrhea. Other laxatives such as phenolphthalein and bisacodyl are similarly associated with electrolyte secretion, changes in mucosal structure, and abnormal motility. These drugs induce NO production through activation of inducible NO synthase (Gaginella et al., 1994).",

Neutrophil chemotaxis and activation is a specific mechanism of gastrointestinal toxicity. Enterotoxins and exogenous protein-derived peptides can generate antigens within endosomes of epithelial cells. Constitutively expressed class II major histocompatibility complex (MHC) molecules within these cells can present the antigens to lymphocytes. The class II MHC molecules that permit antigen presentation are expressed on well-differentiated villus enterocytes but not crypt cells (Elson and Beagley, 1994). Antigen presentation by enterocytes is associated with production of cytokines, particularly IL-1, a chemotaxin for neutrophils that activates neutrophils and macrophages. Activation of macrophages results in generation of IL-8, LTB4, and PAF. These substances are strongly chemotactic for neutrophils. Leukotriene B4 increases the number of neutrophils in the area of antigen stimulation and increases local myeloperoxidase activity, a marker for neutrophil infiltration (Mitchell et al., 1993). IL-8 directs neutrophil migration and likely synergizes with IL-1 in mediating neutrophil chemotaxis. Mucosal mast cells, activated by antigen or cytokines, release LTB4 and PAF to add to neutrophil chemotaxis. Once neutrophils have been attracted to the area of damage or sensitization, IL-1, PAF, and macrophage-generated IL-6 and TNF-\u03b1 activate the neutrophils to stimulate release of enzymes, ROMs, and other damaging substances. NADPH oxidase, a neutrophil enzyme that reduces molecular oxygen to superoxide, is activated by TNF-\u03b1, other cytokines, phorbol esters (such as phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate), and fluoride salts of aluminum (Maly and Schurer-Maly, 1995).",

The selective 5-lipoxygenase synthesis inhibitor, ziluten, abolishes leukotriene B4 synthesis and prevents increases in myeloperoxidase activity stimulated by intestinal ischemia and reperfusion injury (Mangino et al., 1994). Heat-shock protein also inhibits leukotriene B4 (Stojadinovic et al., 1995). Rebamipide inhibits chemotaxis and activation of neutrophils but does not affect superoxide production by either the xanthine oxidase or phorbol ester-stimulated NADPH oxidase pathways (Kim and Hong, 1995). The action of rebamipide may result from attenuation of suppression of SOD in addition to diminished chemotaxis and activation of neutrophils. Gamma-hydroxy butyrate diminishes neutrophil accumulation in an ischemia\u2013reperfusion model (Boyd et al., 1994).",

More often they are ingested as a result of direct exposure to pesticides and most often manifest as toxic responses to drugs. Acetylcholinesterase is normally responsible for inactivation of the neurotransmitter acetylcholine at synaptic and neuroeffector endings of cholinergic motor and secretomotor neurons in the enteric nervous system. Inhibition of enzyme activity allows local buildup of acetylcholine at cholinergic sites of neurotransmission and produces classic signs cholinergic crisis. The principal signs of acetylcholine overactivity include excessive segmenting and propulsive contractions in all areas of the tubular GI tract. This increased motor activity is caused primarily by actions of acetylcholine at smooth muscle M3 muscarinic receptors (Caulfield, 1993). Acetylcholine also acts at M1 and M3 muscarinic receptors to increase salivary, gastric, pancreatic, and intestinal secretions. Toxic amounts of acetylcholinesterase inhibitors produce net secretion of large volumes of fluid and electrolytes into the intestinal lumen resulting in profuse, watery diarrhea frequently associated with severe cramping. Natural inhibitors of acetylcholinesterase include physostigmine, also known as eserine, found in the ripe seed of Physostigma venenosum (Calabar bean or chop nut). A number of chemicals that inhibit acetylcholinesterase have been synthesized (Table 6\n). These include neostigmine, edrophonium, and pyridostigmine. Acetylcholinesterase inhibitors such as parathion, malathion, and paraoxon are used as insecticides. Some very potent acetylcholinesterase inhibitors have been synthesized for use as extremely toxic military nerve gases. These include tabun, sarin, and soman. Isoflurophate (diisopropyl-fluorophosphate, DFP) and echothiophate are potent acetylcholinesterase inhibitors that have been used as therapeutic agents (Taylor, 1996).",

The adherent mucus gel enhances surface neutralization of acid by bicarbonate (Allen et al., 1993).

Trefoil peptides are present in high concentrations in the mucus gel of the mucosa. Intragastric administration of trefoil peptides provides mucosal protection against injury by alcohol and NSAIDs (Babyatsky et al., 1996). The mechanism is probably topical, suggesting that trefoil peptides interact with mucine glycoprotein to reinforce the mucus gel layer (Rachmilewitz, 1996). Trefoil peptides may protect against gastric damage induced by Helicobacter pylori. H. pylori penetrate the mucus layer and produce enzymes such as proteases, lipases, and phospholipases, which may degrade and thus deplete mucus (Sarosiek et al., 1988).",

Orally ingested arsenicals are taken up in high concentrations by intestinal epithelial cells and act intracellularly to disrupt energy production and enzyme activity. The surface epithelial cells poisoned with arsenic quickly exfoliate, denuding the villus epithelium. Epithelial rupture leads to exudation of plasma into the intestinal lumen where it coagulates. Movement of large volumes of fluid into the intestine produces distention that initiates propulsive contractions. Within 1\u201312 h of oral ingestion of arsenicals, gastrointestinal discomfort and characteristic watery diarrhea known as \u201crice-water stools\u201d occur.

Acute mercury intoxication is characterized by sloughing of the epithelium and abdominal pain. Acute lead intoxication can produce nausea, abdominal pain, and vomiting. The vomitus may be milky from the presence of lead chloride (Klaasen et al., 1996). Chronic lead intoxication produces gastrointestinal symptoms that are an important sign of exposure, especially in adults. Constipation with severe abdominal pain (lead colic) may be the predominant sign of intoxication. The actions of lead are thought to involve competition with ionic calcium.

It is likely that the toxicities are often unrecognized because the changes in function may be minor or may be compensated by the complex regulatory apparatus that protects vital gastrointestinal functions. Compared to other intoxications, there is a dearth of information about GI toxicology. The gastrointestinal system has a number of structures and functions that are in a delicate balance to effect digestion. Because the alimentary route delivers most xenobiotics, it is exposed to high local concentrations of these agents or their biotransformed metabolites directly or after uptake and biliary excretion. The GI system is quite plastic in adapting to dietary or altered metabolic demand. Crypt cells are highly responsive to stimulation and are affected by pharmaceuticals, microbes, and DNA damaging agents. Significant interspecies and target organ differences exist in both the predisposition to toxicants and carcinogens, making the choice of an appropriate animal model critical. A greater mechanistic appreciation and understanding of toxic gastroenteropathy is needed to facilitate effective treatment (Betton, 2013).",
