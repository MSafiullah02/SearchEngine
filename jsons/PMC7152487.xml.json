            "text": "The origin of electrospinning (ES) as a viable fiber spinning technique can be traced back to the first years of the 20th century. In 1902, J. F. Cooley [1] deposited a patent that disclosed the principle and system to generate powders or fibers using a high-voltage apparatus. From that pioneering work, the technique has been further developed and refined, as documented by many articles elucidating the history of electrospinning [2], [3], [4], for example, the patents deposited in the 1930s by Formhals [5], [6]. However, since the first appearance of this technique, a long time passed before a theoretical study on the jet forming process was made [7], [8]; the characteristic conical shape assumed by the drop was later referred to as the Taylor cone, using the name of its discoverer.",

The mechanism of fiber production is relatively easy and can be summarized as follows. A high-voltage (generally in the order of tens of kV) is applied between an extrusion system (i.e., nozzle) and a collector. A polymeric solution is then fed at a constant flow rate to the nozzle where it starts elongating forming the Taylor cone. The initial ejection from the cone undergoes a chaotic motion and, as the jet travels through the atmosphere, the solvent evaporates leaving behind polymer fibers that are deposited on the collector [11].",

Moreover, an appealing aspect of electrospinning is the high level of fine-tuning granted by the many process parameters that can be modified and that greatly affect the final product. In fact, changes to the final fiber morphology and surface topography and, consequently, characteristics and properties of the electrospun mat, are influenced not only by the processing parameters (e.g., solution feed rate, applied voltage, nozzle-collector distance) and spinning environment, such as humidity and temperature, but also by the material properties, like solution rheology, concentration, viscosity, surface tension, conductivity, and solvent vapor pressure. In this regard, Seyedmahmoud et al. showed the use of statistical methodologies to gain a quantitative and systematic insight about the effects and interactions between the main process parameters and scaffold properties [12], [13]. Thus, the electrospinning process, despite the apparent simplicity, can fabricate complex electrospun fibers whose characteristics and properties, morphology, and microstructure are affected by a high number of parameters.",

            "text": "Moreover, electrospinning technique is also easily adjusted to allow fiber functionalization by the addition of molecules and/or nanoparticles. This, can be achieved in different ways. For example, nanoparticles can be embedded in the precursor solution in a \u201cone-pot route\u201d [19], [20] or following electrospinning [21], by immersing electrospun structures into colloidal solutions. New trends also entail the functionalization of the electrospun nanofibers by a more refined modification of their surfaces to further enhance the material performance. As an example, in the fields of neural and cardiac tissue engineering, the topology of the electrospun nanofibers was modified to super porous or grid shaped [22], [23], [24]; also, in order to guide the growth, apoptosis, and differentiation of cells, nanofibers have been coated or modified with drugs and DNA [25], [26], [27], [28], [29], [30]. Moreover, another great advantage of electrospun fibers over nanomaterials obtained with \u201cclassical\u201d methods is the possibility to control the overall alignment along desired directions or to obtain organized fiber patterns through the use of optimized metal collectors [31]. Thanks to all those advantages, and especially with regard to the high porosity, large specific surface area, and wide material selection, electrospun fibers have been widely utilized in many fields related to biomedicine as tissue engineering, regenerative medicine, and drug delivery devices [32].",

To this aim, standard immobilization procedures have been purposely modified to functionalize nanofiber mats after being bonded into microfluidic channels [88], [91]. In these applications, the non-water-soluble nanofibers could withstand the fluid flow within the channels, dramatically increasing the functional surface area available within the devices. In particular, Yang et al. reported the use of electrospun highly fibrous membranes as a protein-adsorption substrate in microfluidic immunoassays [78]. Resembling enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (e.g., ELISA), microfluidic immunoassays involve the immobilization of the pathogenic antigen on a solid substrate. The substrate is then incubated with the serum that may contain the corresponding primary antibody, which can be captured by the immobilized antigen. A second labeled detection antibody is finally introduced to determine the amount of the primary antibody in the serum. According to this working principle, researchers created a PC nanofibrous membrane, sandwiched it between a glass substrate and a PDMS chip, and evaluated the performance of the membrane for promoting the adsorption of IgG and detecting HIV-specific antibodies from human serum samples. Compared with a commercial track-etched PC membrane having a uniform pore size, the synthetized nanofibers showed higher binding capacity and improved signal-to-noise ratio. Since polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) is a material commonly used for protein adsorption in Western blot analysis, similar results have been obtained embedding a PVDF nanofibrous membrane in a multichannel microfluidic assay [77]. The improved sensitivity of these microfluidic immunoassays can potentially facilitate the diagnosis of other diseases for which the detection is based on antigen/antibody recognition, such as hepatitis, many types of venereal diseases, severe acute respiratory syndrome, and the avian flu virus.",

These include: (1) cancer cell isolation, (2) molecular diagnostics, (3) tumor biology, and (4) high-throughput screening for therapeutics [92]. Concerning the first point, circulating tumor cells (CTCs) detection can be extremely valuable to cancer diagnosis in early stages and treatment choice. In this regard, one of the more active research groups is the team of Prof. Hsian-Rong at UCLA who developed a \u201cNanoVelcro\u201d cell-affinity substrate in which CTCs capture agent-coated nanostructured substrates have been utilized to immobilize CTCs with high efficiency. Based on the unique NanoVelcro working mechanism, the research team has produced and validated three generations of NanoVelcro chips capable of successfully detecting, isolating, and purifying CTCs from blood samples. First, they pioneered a unique NanoVelcro substrate, by using 3D-nanostructured elements\u2014specifically, a silicon-nanopillar array\u2014which allows for enhanced local topographic interactions with nanoscale components of the cellular surface (e.g., microvilli and filopodia) and results in vastly improved cell-capture affinity compared to flat Si substrates. Upon coating with epithelial-cell adhesion-molecule antibody, the system exhibited outstanding cell-capture efficiency in a stationary device setting [93]. Secondly, they further improved CTCs capture efficiency by integrating a lithographically patterned NanoVelcro substrate with an overlaid PDMS mixer to enhance contact frequency between flow-through CTCs and the substrate [94]. Finally, they introduced a next-generation NanoVelcro chip to replace the nontransparent silicon substrate with a transparent one, prepared by depositing electrospun PLGA nanofibers onto a commercial laser microdissection slide, capable not only of capturing CTCs with high efficiency but also enabling highly specific isolation of single CTCs immobilized on the nanosubstrate without contamination by white blood cells. In the presence of different capture agents, these NanoVelcro chips have been used to capture CTCs from several types of solid tumors, including prostate, breast, lung, and pancreatic cancer, as well as melanoma [95], [96], [97].",

Since microfluidics exhibits high sensitivity and accuracy for detecting cancer-specific biomarkers present at low concentrations [92], the quantification of protein biomarkers has also received some attention for the diagnosis and prognosis of cancer [100]. In this framework, a label-free microfluidic immunosensor with femtomolar sensitivity and high selectivity for early detection of epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (ErbB2, or HER2/neu) protein has been developed [101]. Among human epidermal growth factor receptor family, ErbB2 is worldwide recognized as a marker for early breast cancer diagnosis [102], [103]. Thus, this sensor utilizes a uniquely structured immunoelectrode made of porous hierarchical graphene foam modified with electrospun carbon-doped titaniumdioxide nanofibers as an electrochemical working electrode. To detect interfacial changes originating from biorecognition events at the working electrode, electrochemical impedance spectroscopy and differential pulse voltammetry have been used [101].",

In one of this few works, two different polymers, namely PVA and PS, have been used to produce fibers with different diameters and morphologies with the aim to study their effect on fluid mixing within microfluidic channels [104]. An appreciable passive mixing has been demonstrated for mats with more inhomogeneous morphology and smaller fiber diameters (450\u2013550 nm). Additionally, passive mixing can be smartly coupled with the above reported use of electrospun substrates for analyte concentration, immobilization, and/or detection; hence, microanalytical systems can take advantage of this dual functionality and avoid the use of additional mixing structures when already using nanofibers as functional components in their systems.",
