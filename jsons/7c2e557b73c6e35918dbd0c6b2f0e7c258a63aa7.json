The goals of these systems, to facilitate voter registration and increase public confidence in elections, are laudable. They indisputably provide a critical public good. It is for these reasons that understanding the security and privacy posture of the mail-in voting process is paramount.",

Others have quickly capitalized on this data. In 2018, two mobile applications, VoteWithMe and OutVote, were released. These services used information from government records to allow consumers to see whom of their friends and family voted in recent elections by matching the smartphone's contacts to voter files [34] , with the effective end goal of using social pressure to get people to vote. While these apps have lost popularity since the November 2018 election, ballot tracking websites provide very similar information and have renewed this conversation.",

As a result, there is a paper trail that could pin responsibility. While that does not directly protect privacy in and of itself, the fact that any malicious act as a result of this information request could be traced back to the requester is thwarting.

Presumably this is to ensure the highest level of security as to not expose any vulnerabilities of the system. However, this does pose the privacy concern of aggregate voter statistics. As it would be necessary to track ones ballot, the ballot tracking services are made aware of distinct voter actions. These actions can be defined as but are not limited to: whether or not the individual has voted, at what time they voted, where they chose to deposit their vote. While the contents of the ballot might remain secure, the behaviors of voters may not. Similar to Ballot Scout, many tracking services explicitly state that they will not give away your personal information.

If the company were to sell aggregate information that could isolate individuals, it becomes much easier for political entities to interfere with the mail-in voting process. This becomes vulnerable to an attack such as a Membership Attack in which the attacker can determine whether or not a specific individual falls within a subset of the data. For example, an adversary would be able to determine, via membership attack, a set of individuals that do not vote by mail. In a state where vote by mail is the only option, contextual information such as this example becomes very powerful in determining the behavior of voters. Similarly, since party affiliation is publicly known, with the voter actions known of a subset of individuals, the following scenario could occur: Time or location data for mail-in ballots are released or sold to Party A. Party A, via membership attack, isolates and learns that Party B voters tend to deposit their ballots at a certain time or location more frequently. As a result, Party A tampers with deposit boxes in that location for only those specific times to achieve a maximal impact result with minimal effort.",
