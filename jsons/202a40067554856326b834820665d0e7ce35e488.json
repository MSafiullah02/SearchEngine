This paper aims to develop a rapid, low-cost, and sensitive biosensor for IBV detection by using molybdenum disulfide (MoS 2 ). MoS 2 is a 2-D nanosheet which has strong high fluorescence-quenching ability when applied to a dye-labeled antibody (Ab). In this paper, we developed an Ab-functionalized MoS 2 -based fluorescent immunosensor, which utilized the fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) between the MoS 2 and fluorescence dye during the Ab-antigen interaction. The assay was performed on a low-cost cotton thread-based microfluidic platform due to the good wicking property and flexibility. Upon the optimization of assay conditions, the immunosensor demonstrated remarkable sensitivity of 4.6 \u00d7 10 2 EID 50 per mL and specificity with a dynamic linear response range of 10 2 -10 6 EID 50 per mL for IBV standard solutions. The developed immunoassay successfully detected the IBV spiked chicken serum with satisfactory results. The foregoing presents its potential application for on-farm detection.",

            "text": "C ORONAVIRUSES are enveloped, positive-strand RNA viruses of birds and mammals including humans. As a representative of the Gamma-coronavirus genus, the avian coronavirus (AvCoV) infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) may cause highly contagious respiratory disease in chickens and other galliforme birds [1] . IBV spread fast between individuals may cause a morbidity rate of 100% in bird populations which have not been vaccinated [2] . Chickens infected with IBV exhibit the symptoms of mild respiratory such as coughing, gasping, rales, and nasal discharge, and appearing depressed, or severe kidney and oviduct disease [3] , [4] , which may result in a decrease in egg production or quality. Development of affordable and highly sensitive detection methods for rapid monitoring and screening of IBV is extremely important, especially in less-developed countries. The enzymelinked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and polymerase chain reaction (PCR) test have now been used as gold standard for nucleic acid biomarker diagnostics. However, conventional ELISA can only work on a higher concentration of target molecules hence makes the approach not quite suitable for highly sensitive detection, while PCR usually requires expensive reagents and equipment as well as skilled personnel for the complicated process [5] . All these limitations restrict their applications in on-site detection.",

Recently, transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) have gained world-wide attention as a group of 2D layered nanomaterials analogous to graphene owing to their excellent optoelectronics, nanoelectronics, and energy-harvesting properties. TMDs have been widely used in many research including DNA detection, transistors, photodetectors and photovoltaic devices [9] , [10] . Molybdenum disulfide (MoS 2 ) is an emerging material and one of such TMDs that can be synthesized in large scale and directly dispersed in aqueous solution and no treatment of surfactants or oxidation is required [11] , [12] . Moreover, a higher fluorescence-quenching ability than graphene and the hydrophobicity property of surface make MoS 2 become promising material in biosensing platforms and finding various applications [13] - [18] . The hydrophobicity of the MoS 2 surface is a key enabling feature, because it enables strong affinity of protein-surface adsorption [11] . Kong et al. [11] made an aptamer-functionalized MoS 2 biosensor by using the high fluorescence-quenching ability between MoS 2 and dye-labeled single-stranded DNA probe for prostate specific antigen detection. High sensitivity and high selectivity with a detection limit for the PSA of 0.2 ng/mL were achieved. Tuteja et al. [18] reported a MoS 2 -based electrochemical immunosensor for detecting \u03b2-hydroxybutyrate, which is biomarker of subclinical ketosis. The immunosensor is based on the immmunodetection of the anti-\u03b2HBA antibodies immobilized on the MoS 2 -modified electrodes and \u03b2HBA antigen. Geldert et al. [19] developed fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET)-based MoS 2 aptasensor for the detection of the malarial biomarker Plasmodium lactate dehydrogenase (pLDH). Zhang et al. [20] demonstrated a sandwich electrochemiluminescence immunosensor based on MoS 2 for alpha fetal protein detection. MoS 2 nanosheets surface was modified using polyethylenimine (PEI) polymer and gold nanopaticles. The immunosensor was able to analyze AFP in real human serum samples with limit of detection of 1.0 \u00d7 10 \u22125 ng/mL. These research demonstrate the huge protetial of MoS 2 in biosensor applications.",

We developed a single-step immunosensor on cotton thread based on antibody-functionalized MoS 2 for the detection of IBV. The principle is based on a homogeneous FRET immunoassay, the sensing mechanism is shown in Fig. 1 . The distinct quenching property of MoS 2 on the fluorophore during the antigen-antibody reaction was adopted. The antibody (Ab) probes are modified with fluorescent dye labelling (dyed-IBV-Ab) and MoS 2 (MoS 2 -IBV-Ab bioconjugates), respectively. In the presence of IBV, both the dyed-IBV-Ab and the MoS 2 -IBV-Ab bioconjugates will specifically bind with the target IBV due to the antigen-antibody reaction. After binding, the fluorescence of the dyed-IBV-Ab probe is largely quenched owing to the transfer of electrons or energy between the closely connected dye molecules and the MoS 2 . In the absence of IBV, the fluorescence of the dyed-IBV-Ab probe will not change. Therefore, the concentration of the IBV in the chicken blood sample can be quantitatively determined by analysis the fluorescence intensity in an assay.",

The design of the thread network is shown in Fig. 2 . Two individual thread for sample and probe reagent dispensing were split to two streams. One of the two stream was then recombined with knot for mixing. Noted that the length of the split stream should be identical to achieve good mixing ratio between two streams flowing into it through the interwoven knot [21] . The other two streams are used for negative control (dyed-IBV-Ab solution, no IBV presented) and background testing, respectively. A test zones were defined on each branch thread.

A series of concentrations of MoS 2 -IBV Ab, 0.02 mg/mL, 0.1 mg/mL, 0.2 mg/mL and 0.3 mg/mL were carried out while keeping the concentration of dyed-IBV-Ab at 30 \u03bcg/ mL and the reaction time with 10 min.

A significant increase when the concentration of MoS 2 -IBV-Ab goes higher, however, no distinguishable difference is observed for the concentration higher than 0.2 mg/mL. Therefore, 0.2 mg/mL MoS 2 -IBV-Ab was selected as the optimized concentration.

Under the optimized settings, fluorescence analysis for a series of IBV standard solution (from 0 to 10 6 EID 50 per mL, in PBS buffer of pH 7.4) was conducted, the result of which is shown in Fig. 4 (d) .

The transportation of fluidic was investigated firstly by using food color and it was observed that the fluid could reach the test zones within 1 min due to the capillary wicking. In addition, a time duration of 6 min was found to be sufficient for a complete reaction, as shown in Fig. 5 (a) . The reaction time is slightly shorter that conducted in microplate. This may be attributed to the faster kinetics due to the better mixing effect on the thread. A wide range of IBV standard solution was detected. The IBV standard solution ranging from 0\u223c10 6 EID 50 per mL was analyzed by the presented thread immunosensor to obtain the standard curve and calculate the limit of detection. A linear fit of the obtained relative fluorescence intensity difference with respect to varying concentration of IBV standards is plotted in Fig. 5 (b) . The values denote average relative fluorescence intensity difference (n = 3) compared to negative control with standard deviation as error bars. It is shown that a distinct change presents starting from 10 2 EID 50 per mL with a correlation coefficient (R 2 ) of 0.9828. The limit of detection calculated based on 3\u03c3 [33] of the blank is 4.6\u00d710 2 EID 50 per mL. The different fluorescence responses of the test zones on the cotton thread upon the detection of various concentrations of IBV standard solution are shown in Fig. 5 (c) . It is clearly seen that the fluorescence of the dyed-IBV-Ab was significantly quenched for all concentrations of IBV standard solution. With the concentration of IBV increases, the fluorescence is quenched more because more \"sandwich\" complex of dyed-IBV-Ab / IBV / MoS 2 -IBV-Ab are formed, resulting in largely quenched ",
