Therefore, it is an urgent issue that how to manage the sudden outbreak of epidemic effectively and fleetly.

For instance, the probability and intensity of close contacts among roommates is higher than the one among non-roommates, and the same as classmates and non-classmates. In this paper it researched three relations between students to build social relationship network model. These relations are classmates, roommates and playmates. Classmates could be roommates and non-roommates, but non-classmates must be non-roommates. And playmates could be classmates and non-classmates, as well as be roommates and non-roommates. The closeness of relations among students is different and their proportions are shown in table 1. In simulation experiment, these proportions determine the probability distribution of contact objects. The relations of classmates and roommates are confirmed by dorms which students live in. If students live in the same one dorm, they are roommates and classmates. If students live in different dorms, they are non-roommates, and they are classmates when these dorms belong to the same one class, or they are non-classmates. The relation of playmates is not confined to living place. In simulation experiments, it assumed that each student has 0 to 5 playmates, which are randomly generated at the beginning of experiment.

It proves that emergency measure of segregating non-classmates has prevented class 7 from infectious students. From figure 5 (a) (4), (b) (4), and (c) (4), we know that the number of infectious students in the fifth floor decline, and become zero more and more quickly. It could conclude that the emergency measures of segregating nonclassmates and non-roommates could effectively protect students from the spread of H1N1 influenza, and that segregating non-roommates is a much better measure than segregating non-classmates.

Besides, it designed a variety of random parameters in simulation experiments, and two kinds of segregation strategies, and analyzed the results of experiments with different segregation strategies. In the following works, we will build a whole school model using artificial societies on the basis of what we get from this paper to simulate the outbreak and spread of epidemic in school, and to support decision making in emergency management.",
