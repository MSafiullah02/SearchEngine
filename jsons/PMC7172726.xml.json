            "text": "Bovine respiratory diseases (BRD) have etiologies of viruses, bacteria, and Mycoplasma spp. (Fulton,2008, 2009) Viruses included in BRD, either singly or in combination include bovine herpesvirus-1 (BoHV-1), parainfluenza \u22123 virus (PI3V), bovine viral diarrhea viruses (BVDV), bovine respiratory syncytial virus (BRSV), and bovine coronaviruses (BoCV)(Fulton, 2008, Fulton, 2009, Fulton et al., 2011, Fulton et al., 2013, Fulton et al., 2016). The bovine PI3V is a RNA virus in the genus Respirovirus in the family Paramyxoviridae (Chanock et al., 2001). In North America both killed/inactivated and modified live virus (MLV) vaccines are used for control of these viruses (Compendium of Veterinary Products, 2010). Clinicians seeking information on potential causative agents/etiologies often submit samples from cattle such as nasal swabs or blood samples from affected cattle and tissues from necropsy samples to the diagnostic laboratories. Samples may be tested by \u201ctraditional tests\u201d including virus isolation for infectious virus or more often \u201cmodern tests\u201d, molecular tests including polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and in some cases, sequencing of the agent\u2019s genome (Fulton et al., 2016, Fulton and Confer, 2012). Interpretation of such results is important for clinicians and the diagnostic laboratory. Viruses may appear to be similar based on the test used such as infectious viruses from cultures or these from the molecular tests that are homologous based on the product produced using primers. Also there is the dilemma of whether the virus identified is a field virus or a vaccine strain. A recent study utilized samples from cattle with BRD signs after processing with MLV vaccines administered (Fulton et al., 2016). In that study there were isolates of BoHV-1, BVDV, and PI3V that utilized sequencing of the viral genome and found either field strains or vaccine strains. Thus it is important to be able to differentiate viral isolates of field or vaccine origin. Several PI3V strains in the U.S. have been examined using viral sequencing with three types identified, PI3VA, PI3VB, and PI3V C. (Neill et al., 2015)",

Study 3 samples were from an Oklahoma feed yard from cattle with BRD signs and they had received a MLV vaccine at entry to the feed yard. The Study 4 included isolates from cattle using nasal swabs from cattle with BRD signs (Fulton et al., 2016).

PCR primer and probe sets for type B and C were designed that were specific for the respective genotypes (Table 3). The real time PCR primers were designed within the phosphoprotein (P) gene. PCR reactions were assembled using 0.4 \u03bcM of each primer and 0.2 \u03bcM probe in a 25 \u03bcl reaction using the QuantiFast Probe RT-PCR Kit (Qiagen, Inc., Valencia, CA). One microliter of cell culture fluid containing the virus was used as template.

Cattle entering feedlots often have clinical signs of BRD within days of entering the feedlot. With samples submitted to the diagnostic laboratory and tested for viruses, resulting reports may indicate PI3V isolation from cultures or detection by molecular tests. Interpretation of those results is problematic as cell culture isolation or molecular tests will not differentiate field strains from the MLV vaccine strains. An earlier study (Fulton et al., 2016) found that when BoHV-1, PI3V, and BVDV isolates from cattle with BRD signs/lesions were tested using viral genome sequencing, the strains could be separated into field versus vaccine strains. This study adds more specific information on the PI3V strains compared to the prior study (Fulton et al., 2016) as the specific PI3V was identified (OK P 9054 and OK P 7469). This current study follows in line with a prior study where PI3V isolates in the U.S. include PI3V A strains along with PI3V B and PI3V C. (Neill et al., 2015) Several of those strains were included in reference strains in this study (Fig. 1).",

With the finding of PI3V B and PI3V C types in the cattle population, the questions becomes, does the genomic variation affect the antigenic properties? In this study, there was evidence of antigenic variation with antibody titers from calves receiving PI3V A vaccines had lower antibody titers when PI3V C viruses were used in the VNT. These results are similar to a prior study in the U.S. (Neill et al., 2015) these findings are similar to another bovine virus, BVDV with antigenic properties varied among the genotypes of BVDV, BVDV1a, BVDV1b, and BVDV2a.
