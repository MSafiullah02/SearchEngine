Our analysis demonstrates that the PDCoV might be a causative agent of the outbreaks resulting in diarrhoea in pigs in Japan since late 2013. Because the PDCoVs detected in our study were genetically related with those emerging in other swine-producing countries, such as the U.S. and Korea, since 2013, they may represent an invasion from overseas, like the PEDV invasion into Japan. Our findings provide valuable information on the genetic relationships of PDCoV among countries worldwide, as well as the clinical signs and viral distribution of PDCoV in piglets.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Discussion"}, {"text": "Supplementary data to this article can be found online at https:// doi.org/10.1016/j.meegid.2018.03.030.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Discussion"}, {"text": "This work was supported in part by grants from Science and Technology Research Promotion Program for Agriculture, Forestry, PDCoV-inoculated 4 DPI 0/3 2/3 (0.7) 3/3 (3.0) 3/3 (1.7) 3/3 (1.7) 3/3 (1.3) 3/3 (1.0) 0/3 7 DPI 0/3 0/3 0/3 1/3 (1.0) 1/3 (0.3) 2/3 (0.7) 3/3 (1.0) 1/3 (0.3) 27 DPI 0/2 0/2 0/2 0/2 0/2 0/2 0/2 0/2 Negative control 4 DPI 0/1 0/1 0/1 0/1 0/1 0/1 0/1 0/1 7 DPI 0/1 0/1 0/1 0/1 0/1 0/1 0/1 0/1 27 DPI 0/1 0/1 0/1 0/1 0/1 0/1 0/1 0/1 T.
