The supernatant was inoculated onto rhesus monkey kidney (LLC-MK2), human laryngeal carcinoma (HEp-2), Mardin Darby canine kidney (MDCK), and human embryonic lung fibroblast cell monolayers. All cell cultures were incubated at 37\u00b0C, except for MDCK, which was incubated at 33\u00b0C. Cell monolayers were examined daily for cytopathic effect. After 14 days of incubation, a hemadsorption test for LLC-MK2 and MDCK monolayers was performed.

In a recent study27 of patients with very severe exacerbations that necessitated intubation and mechanical ventilation, viral agents were identified in 43% from respiratory specimens obtained via the endotracheal tube. In a study28 of the viral etiology among 17 patients hospitalized with near-fatal asthma (from endotracheal aspiration), 29 patients with acute asthma (from induced sputum), and 14 patients with COPD (from induced sputum) in Singapore, influenza virus was identified in 36% of the subjects hospitalized with AECOPD.

Due to limited resources, patients were recruited every alternate day, although the demographics of these patients were representative of the whole group when compared to our previous study.10 In addition, no patients with a stable state of COPD were recruited as control subjects, and it was thus not sure whether the viruses identified in the NPA were true pathogens or represented \u201ccolonization\u201d or \u201cchronic infection.\u201d Previous studies25\n26\n48 using the PCR technique could identify some viruses (including piconavirus, influenza A and B virus, parainfluenaza 3, and RSV) in the respiratory specimens of stable COPD patients. As the rate of viruses identification in patients with stable-state COPD was much lower than that during AECOPD and most RSV infections in patients with COPD were associated with symptomatic respiratory illness together with measurable immune responses,48 it is highly likely that viral infections play an important role in triggering AECOPD.",

The common viruses were influenza A, coronavirus OC43, and rhinovirus. Viral infections appeared to have no effect on subsequent readmission rates or mortality rate over a study period of 1 year, and there was no difference in the rates of viral infections among COPD patients in different GOLD stages. In recent years, there is growing epidemiologic evidence linking viruses to AECOPD.49 It is worth noting that coronavirus OC43 and rhinovirus are both fastidious to growth, and are not covered by the routine diagnostic spectrum in most service laboratories. Our data have shown that coronavirus OC43 and rhinovirus could also exacerbate COPD. Further studies on the diagnostics, therapeutics, and vaccines for these \u201ctrivial\u201d viruses are needed in addition to exploring the mechanisms of how viruses may induce AECOPD.",
