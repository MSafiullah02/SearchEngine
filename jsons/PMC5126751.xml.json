Men, women, and children of all ages attend Hajj.[1] There is enormous diversity in terms of ethnic origin and socioeconomic status.[2] Because of the sheer number and crowding of people, stampedes have been known to occur. And also, there is an opportunity for the spread of respiratory infections. Travel to Mecca and Madina outside of the Hajj season is referred to as Umrah. More than a million people are present in the holy places of Mecca and Madina at any given point of time, be it Hajj or Umrah. Thus, preventive measures taken for Hajj apply for Umrah as well.[2]",

It falls on a date about 11 days earlier each year. The pilgrims spend the \u201cDay of Arafah\u201d (9th day of Dhul-Hijjah) in Arafah, an empty plain. They commit the entire day to supplication and devotion. In the evening, they move to Muzdalifa. They camp there overnight and offer various prayers.[1213] On the 9th day of Dhul-Hijjah, they return to Mina and throw seven pebbles at a pillar that symbolizes Satan's temptation of Abraham. (The Qur'an describes how Satan tried to persuade Abraham to not ritually murder his son Ishmael, as commanded by God). The pilgrims then sacrifice a sheep, recalling how Abraham sacrificed a sheep that God had provided in place of his son. The meat is distributed to friends, relative, and the poor. Afterward, they return to Mecca and perform a final tawaf and sa'i. They symbolize the completion of the Hajj by cutting their hair.[14]",

PCV13 is a conjugate vaccine while PPV23 is a polysaccharide vaccine. The PCV differs from the PPV in several ways [Table 2]. The PCV13 is effective in infants[32] and has also recently been approved for adults. It induces immunological memory,[32] offers prolonged protection,[3233] has a booster effect,[33] does not induce hyporesponsiveness,[32] is known to reduce nasopharyngeal carriage,[34] and offers herd protection.[34] On the other hand, there is demonstrated efficacy of PPV23 against invasive pneumococcal disease (IPD) in adults, but inconsistent data regarding its effectiveness against CAP.[3536] In two large meta-analyses performed by Huss et al. and Moberley et al. in the year 2009 and 2008, respectively, when the randomized control trials were taken into account there was little evidence for vaccine protection.[3537] Besides, the phenomenon of hyporesponsiveness is seen with revaccination PPV23.[3738] PPV23 and PCV13 act differently. This could be an important consideration while making a recommendation for pneumococcal vaccination for Hajj pilgrims, particularly since some pilgrims travel to Hajj more than once in their lifetime. Another important consideration when making a pneumococcal vaccination recommendation is the fact that PCV13 can be safely coadministered with the influenza vaccine in a patient, though at a different site.[39] PCV13 is currently approved in India for children <5 years of age and adults >50 years of age; in contrast, in Bangladesh, PCV13 is approved for all age groups.",

Pneumococcal pneumonia is the most common type of community-acquired bacterial pneumonia in the US. About 900,000 Americans get pneumococcal pneumonia each year, nearly half of whom require hospitalization.[41] Among adults of 50 years of age and older, there are approximately 440,000 cases of pneumococcal pneumonia each year in the US,[42] with approximately 25,000 pneumococcal disease-related deaths annually[42] Estimates have placed the yearly direct and indirect costs of adult hospitalizations and outpatient cases due to pneumococcal pneumonia in the US at nearly $5 billion.[43]",
