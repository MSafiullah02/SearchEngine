Thus far, modeling of pandemics has focused on either large-scale difference equation models like the SIR and the SEIR models, or detailed micro-level simulations, which are harder to apply at a global scale. This paper introduces a hybrid model for pandemics considering both global and local spread of infections. We hypothesize that the spread of an infectious disease between regions is significantly influenced by global traffic patterns and the spread within a region is influenced by local conditions. Thus we model the spread of pandemics considering the connections between regions for the global spread of infection and population density based on the SEIR model for the local spread of infection. We validate our hybrid model by carrying out a simulation study for the spread of SARS pandemic of 2002-2003 using available data on population, population density, and traffic networks between different regions. While it is well-known that international relationships and global traffic patterns significantly influence the spread of pandemics, our results show that integrating these factors into relatively simple models can greatly improve the results of modeling disease spread.",

            "text": "Modeling of the spread of infectious disease typically falls into one of two categories. Analytically tractable models like the SEIR model are capable of capturing some globally important phenomena like the rate of spread of diseases using few parameters. However, they have a hard time reflecting differences in global spread due to local conditions. For example, it can be difficult to model different rates of spread in countries with different population densities and public health policies of variable strength and coordination. Network-or agent-based models are capable of reflecting details of individual conditions. However, modeling large-scale global disease-spread using such models often runs into methodological problems like overfitting because of the vast number of possible parameters. This paper proposes a granular, network-based hybrid model of disease spread in which individual regions are modeled as nodes in the network, and the spread of disease within nodes is modeled analytically (using a simplified derivative of the SEIR model) with the help of demographic parameters like population density. The properties of the network as a whole, like connectivity, are determined using real data on traffic between regions. We demonstrate the power of this approach by simulating the spread of SARS . One of the key takeaways is that the level of granularity has a significant effect on the success of network-or agent-based simulation models. For example, we show that modeling China as an individual node is unsuccessful, whereas breaking it up into constituent regions gives an impressive match to real infection data on SARS.",

At the same time it is capable of reproducing the important broad flows of disease. However, it is important to remember that exact reproduction of historical data is not the end-goal. Exceptions that do not correspond to real data provide insight into specific local phenomena that influenced the progression of a pandemic, such as an actual timing of the first infected case in a country.",

In the next section we give a brief overview of the most common modeling methodologies, including differential equation models and simulation models, but here we discuss related research more generally. The most closely related to this work can be grouped into two categories. First, several researchers have simulated and analyzed the local spread of SARS in 2002-2003 [20, 23, 50] . In particular, Huang, et al reproduce the situations in Singapore, Taipei, and Toronto individually, and compare with the actual transitions [20] . This also ties in to a significant existing literature on local modeling of historical pandemics, like the Influenza during the First World War (e.g. [6, 26] ). Other examples also abound: Jenvald, et al use a virtual city based on Link\u00f6ping, Sweden, considering the number of schools, age distribution, and household type [21] ; Longini, et al model population and contact processes based on Thailand census data, demographic information, and social network data [25] ; Kelso, et al model a real community in the south west of Western Australia [22, 27] .",

The basic reproduction number, R 0 , is the average number of persons infected by a single infected person when the population has no immunity and no control against the infection [49] . In the SIR differential equation model, the basic reproduction number is given by R 0 = N \u03b2/\u03bb. If one infected person infects more than one susceptible person (i.e., R 0 > 1), secondary infection occurs and the infection spreads.

Deguchi, et al have developed an Agent Based simulation language called SOARS, Spot Oriented Agent Role Simulator [11, 10] for simulating the spread of disease considering modules such as human activities, opportunity for contact between people in a society, disease state, and intervention to control the spread. Network-based models typically represent agents as nodes on graphs and allow the connectivity structure of the graph to determine the possible spread of disease. For example, extending an SIR model to networks would involve allowing a susceptible vertex S to be infected by an infectious vertex I only if S is adjacent to I. Network-based models are useful in that they can reflect social and economic networks. People's behaviors and social contacts build the network and the infection route is on the network.",

Due to its resistance to dryness, it can also be transmitted through air. It is thought that the incubation period of SARS is usually 2-10 days and the average is 5 days [32] . In the pandemic of 2002-2003, most countries reported a median incubation period of 4-5 days, and a mean of 4-6 days. In the incubation period, it is unlikely an infected person will spread the disease through droplet infection. The infectious period is thought to be about two weeks, with its peak from the 7th-10th day after infection [32] . Transmission efficiency appears to be greatest from severely ill patients who are experiencing rapid clinical deterioration, usually during the second week of illness. Maximum virus excretion from the respiratory tract occurs on about day 10 of illness and then declines to 0% by day 23. There are no reports on transmission beyond 10 days of fever resolution [42] . The death rate varies by age group (SARS affects older patients much more severely), but the overall death rate was about 9.6% in the 2002-2003 SARS pandemic, significantly higher than that of seasonal Influenzas. Another notable feature of SARS is that it is believed that \"super-spreading\" events, where a person infects many more than the average rate of infection, are a key component in its transmission. Our model does not deal explicitly with such levels of granularity, which may lead to some outlier predictions in areas where the law of large numbers does not take over.

The model achieves this without using any special parameters that vary in different countries. Populations, densities, and travel data are all taken from the real world. The SARS epidemic started spreading from Hong Kong and immediately reached mainland China. The peak of Hong Kong comes earlier than that of China since the population density is higher. However, the curve decreases from some point because the percentage of susceptible agents in the population decreases and the percentage of Recovered agents increases. Then the number of Infectious agents decreases. After that, the number of infected agents in China increases. Because of its population, the number of infected agents at its peak in China is the largest among the three countries/regions. The peak in Taiwan is slightly delayed because of the time lag in the infection reaching Taiwan. Figure 5 shows the predicted (from the model) and actual number of cases for each of the eight modeled regions. While the fit is good for several of the most important (in terms of number of cases) regions, and therefore the overall numbers are good, there are some discrepancies for some of the regions that had a relatively fewer number of cases. Specifically, the model underpredicts the number of cases for some of the less densely populated provinces of China (Shanxi, Inner Mongolia, and Hebei) and overpredicts for one of the more densely populated regions (Tianjin). There are idiosyncratic events associated with the spread of any pandemic, so it is not entirely surprising that some of the results do not match perfectly. The next section considers anomalies in more detail, where some data is available. But it is important to note that the level of granularity in modeling is very important. Figure 6 shows the difference in the model in two cases: one where the six infected provinces in China are modeled independently, and one where the six provinces are aggregated into one, using aggregated data on population density, travel etc. The figure clearly shows that the more granular model is a much better fit to the data.",

An early, chance outbreak, in a country or region can lead to significantly more cases than expected. Similarly, if a country manages to avoid a case of SARS for longer than predicted by international travel data, heightened awareness and prevention strategies will lead to many fewer cases than expected. For SARS in particular, this factor may be particularly important, because there is considerable evidence that some people infected with SARS are \"super spreaders\" who may affect the trajectory of the spread. While an infected person infects, on average, 1-3 people [32] , some infected people pass the virus to many other people [16] . Although it is not clear what causes someone to become a super spreader, it is suspected that a person who has a chronic illness such as diabetes is more likely to be a super spreader [32] . [16] .",

It turns out that each of these countries experienced its first infection at a much later date than predicted, as shown in Table 9 . Republic of Korea imported the first case in April 25th, Macao imported the first case in May 5th 2003, and Japan was never infected. These countries imported their first cases one or more months after Vietnam, Canada, Taiwan, Singapore and the Philippines.

Other than that, the parameters of the simulation remained the same. Figure 9 shows that the cumulative number of cases from the model then correspond better to real data. Local Considerations Our model trades off adaptability to local conditions for a smaller number of parameters to fit. This can have several effects. Here we discuss two of them, and how they might affect the results. First, if we look at data from seasonal flu cases, we find that Canada typically has a large number of cases, and the United States has the largest number of influenza isolates [46] . Both of these suggest that the local infection coefficient may be higher in Canada and the United States than other countries. Indeed, this could have been an additional factor in the surprisingly large number of Canadian cases. However, the United States was surprising, because, although it imported 27 cases, the infection did not spread locally. This may indicate that the quarantining and isolation measures employed worked effectively.",

When parameters are calibrated to real data on populations, densities, and traffic, we show that the model reproduces many of the key dynamics of the spread of SARS in 2002 and 2003, while remaining parsimonious, and therefore useful for understanding the root causes of why pandemics spread in the way they do. Both the successes and the failures of the simple model provide insights into pandemic spread. For example, it is clear that it is important to model international traffic to understand the pathways of spread. At the same time, for any particular pandemic, individual idiosyncrasies can come into play. For example, the importance of super-spreaders in SARS is reflected in the fact that the time of first infection in a country has a big role in how many people get infected. The other major takeaway from this work is that the level of granularity in the network structure of the model has a significant impact. For example, treating China as one large entity leads to poorer prediction, but at the same time specializing all the way down to cities would end up requiring too much data to accurately calibrate the model, and would probably not provide significantly better prediction.",
