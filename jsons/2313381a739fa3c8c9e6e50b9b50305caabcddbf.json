As the response rate to FDA-approved treatment improved over the past decade, we are facing increasing number of difficult-to-treat patients such as those who have failed prior anti-viral therapy. The role of amantadine in the treatment of CHC remains unclear. Studies thus far have produced conflicting results, and type II error could not be excluded. This review summarized results published in the literature from 1997 to 2003, and reviewed the existing questions and controversies regarding the use of amantadine. Current literature suggests that amantadine is ineffective as monotherapy. Amantadine increased the sustained virologic response of certain treat-ment na\u00efve patients when used in combination with interferon, and may be effective as an adjunct to interferon-based combination therapy in some patients who have failed or relapsed on prior therapy. Factors such as small sample size, patient characteristics, and differences in treatment protocols including amantadine preparation and duration of therapy might explain the conflicting observations of various studies. Further investigations are needed to define optimal dosing and formulation of amantadine, and its appropriate role in management of CHC infection.",

            "text": "Hepatitis C virus (HCV) is a major cause of chronic liver disease and hepatocellular carcinoma, and is the leading indication for liver transplantation. In the US alone, approximately 4 million people are infected, of whom 10 000 die each year as a consequence of HCV-related liver disease [1] . The standard of care for treatment of chronic hepatitis C (CHC) infection has evolved in a stepwise progression over the past 10 years. Interferon-alpha 3 million units (MU), given through subcutaneous injection three times weekly, resulted in sustained virologic response (SVR) in 10-20% of patients, whereas combination interferon-alpha/ribavirin achieved overall response rates approaching 30-40% [2] [3] [4] . Two forms of a newer, longer-acting pegylated interferon-alpha have provided an incremental advantage over standard interferon, and in combination with ribavirin can achieve SVRs between 40 and 80% depending on the HCV genotype [5, 6] . Despite these advances, a significant number of patients fail to respond to the current standard antiviral regimen, especially in patients with unfavourable features such as genotype 1 infection and high viral load, which were the majority of patients in the US with CHC. In the coming years, we will be facing an increasing proportion of such patients and/or treatment failures. While antiviral agents specifically targeting key enzymes of the HCV viral cycle remain under investigation, alternative agents such amantadine may represent important adjunctive treatment options, especially for the growing patient population that have failed prior anti-viral therapy.",

Since this initial report, clinical studies have provided conflicting results on amantadine when used alone, in combination with interferon-alpha, or with interferon-alpha and ribavirin. Most studies suggest that amantadine has little impact on SVR when used alone, and produces at best a modest improvement in SVR when combined with interferon-alpha or interferon-alpha plus ribavirin. In this review we investigate the potential role of amanatidine, in the treatment of CHC based on results published up to end of 2003.",

Early studies showed that amantadine reduced HCV RNA content in cultured peripheral blood mononuclear cells from infected patients [10] , and inhibit the HCV p7 protein, a key component of ion channel formation [11] . Despite this observation, in vitro biochemical assays demonstrated that amantadine failed to inhibit key regulatory enzymes and steps of viral replication, including HCV protease, helicase, ATPase, RNA-dependent RNA polymerase, and HCV internal ribosomal entry site translation [12] . Any effect of amantadine on HCV likely involves an immune-mediated process as amantadine may induce the production of interleukins [13] . Therefore, amantadine may be best used as an adjunct to interferon and ribavirin to produce an additive or synergistic effect [14, 15] . Additional research is needed to determine if amantadine interacts with other host or viral factors, or modulates the host immune system as a basis for its antiviral effects.",

Eighty-nine patients in five observational trials were treated with amantadine 200 mg daily alone for 3-12 months; although a biochemical response was seen in some patients, none achieved a SVR [16] [17] [18] [19] [20] . Six randomized trials were performed to evaluate interferon-alpha and amantadine combination therapy as first-line therapy. Caronia et al. [21] demonstrated in their study of 143 patients that the addition of amantadine to fixed-dose IFNalpha 4.5 MU three times weekly for 12 months had no additional improvement in SVR (18% without amantadine vs 15% with amantadine). In contrast, Mangia et al. [22] found in their open-label, prospective study of 200 patients that the addition of amantadine to fixed-dose IFN-alpha 6 MU three times weekly for 12 months resulted in a statistically significant increase of SVR from 16.8 to 29.3% (P \u00bc 0.036). A recent meta-analysis of individual patient data for these six trials showed that combination interferon-alpha and amantadine appears to be effective, resulting in a pooled SVR of 23.1% (P \u00bc 0.03) [23] . In this meta-analysis, 481 treatment na\u00efve patients were treated with interferon and amantadine and 491 received interferon monotherapy. Baseline characteristics in favour of the interferon-amantadine combination therapy over monotherapy included genotype 1 or 4 (P \u00bc 0.025), high viral load (P \u00bc 0.035), age <40 (P \u00bc 0.023), low ALT level (P \u00bc 0.007) and absent to moderate fibrosis (P \u00bc 0.007). Logistic regression analysis showed interferonamantadine combination therapy (P \u00bc 0.04) in addition to age, genotype and baseline viraemia were independent predictors of response. In the most difficult to treat group (genotype 1 or 4, high viral load), the response rate using combination therapy was 10.5% vs 4.9% in the monotherapy group (P \u00bc 0.08), but response was similar among those with favourable genotype (2 or 3) and low viral load. The most important conclusion, perhaps, was the fact that amantadine did improve the response rate of interferon in treatment na\u00efve CHC patients in this meta-analysis. However, this was still below the SVR with current interferon and ribavirin combination therapy.",

Helbing et al. performed a double-blind study of 246 patients who received interferon-alpha 6 MU three times weekly for 20 weeks then 3 MU three times weekly for the remainder of a 12 month course, with or without amantadine 200 mg daily. The addition of amantadine resulted in a statistically insignificant increase in SVR from 17% to 24% (P \u00bc 0.175) [27] . These trials suggest that amantadine induction therapy is ineffective.",

For example, in the meta-analysis of treatmentna\u00efve patients, a sample size of 500 in each treatment arm was needed to detect the marginal increase in SVR with addition of amantadine [23] . These studies were inadequately powered to detect a small benefit from amantadine. The study by Younossi et al. [36] also has several shortcomings. Although the optimal duration of treatment with amantadine and interferon remains unknown, it is possible that the full antiviral effect of combination therapy was underestimated by the short-course of treatment (24 weeks) , as other studies have demonstrated that a minimum of 48 weeks of interferon is necessary to achieve sustained viral clearance in patients with genotype 1. Amantadine's antiviral effect may be mediated, in part, by unique synergistic interactions with interferon and ribavirin, and therefore may have been underestimated in trials not evaluating triple therapy. Additionally, its effect may have been underpowered by the low ribavirin dose used in this study (800 mg daily). Previous studies have clearly demonstrated that ribavirin exerts antiviral effects in a dosedependent manner, and therefore comparison with studies using higher doses cannot be made. In contrast, both the Brillanti [38] and Adinolfi [39] trials evaluated amantadine as a component of triple therapy for a full 48-week course, and demonstrated impressive increases in SVR compared with the standard combination interferon-ribavirin regimen. The trial by Adinolfi [39] was the best powered to address this question (114 patients), and additionally demonstrated that induction therapy with 4 weeks of daily interferon may have incremental benefit. Amantadine may have an important role as an adjunct to combination interferon-ribavirin therapy in interferon nonresponders, although further prospective, randomized trials are needed to further elucidate the optimal dosing and duration, and identify predictive factors for success.",

Tabone et al. [43] treated 40 interferon relapsers with amantadine monotherapy (amantadine 200 mg daily for 2 months); none of these patients achieved SVR. Carlsson et al. treated both nonresponders and relapsers to interferon/ribavirin combination with triple therapy (interferon 3 MU three times weekly, ribavirin 1000 mg daily, and amantadine 200 mg daily for 24 weeks), finding that 0% and 10% achieved SVR, respectively. This suggested that amantadine has no effect on nonresponders, but may result in SVR in a small number of relapsers to combination therapy [44] . Weeginth et al. randomized 37 patients who responded but relapsed to previous interferon or interferon/ribavirin therapy to either of two triple therapy regimens. All patients received an initial 2 weeks of induction therapy with high-dose interferon-alpha 18 MU three times weekly, ribavirin, and amantadine, followed by 22 additional weeks of ribavirin and amantadine, with or without additional interferonalpha 3 MU three times weekly. None of the patients who received only 2 weeks of induction interferon achieved viral clearance; in contrast, a very high percentage (44%) of patients completing 24 weeks of triple therapy with induction and then standard interferon-alpha achieved SVR (P < 0.001) [45] . This study demonstrated that re-treatment with triple therapy may be highly effective in a small subset of relapsers to previous interferon or interferon/ribavirin therapy who have a non-I genotype and demonstrated a virologic response within 6 weeks of initiating therapy.",

Most drug trials explicitly exclude patients aged over 60, and therefore little data is available to guide standards of care in these patients [48] . This paucity of data is reflected in the original 1997 NIH Consensus Development Statement on Management of Hepatitis C, which did not support the routine use of interferon-based therapy in patients aged over 60 years \u00d4because of incomplete data\u00d5 [49] . Although no formal recommendation is made in the most recent Consensus Statement in 2002, it is clear that controversy remains over the safety and efficacy of interferon-based therapy in this population, and the balance between risks and benefits. Newer regimens using antiviral agents with a favourable side effect profile are needed to provide alternative options for patients in whom interferon or ribavirin may be contraindicated. Amantadine is typically well-tolerated, has few side effects (nausea, lightheadedness, decreased concentration, decreased appetite and anxiety), and rarely causes more serious reactions (agitation, hallucinations, seizures) [50] . Torre et al. treated 23 consecutive treatment-na\u00efve elderly patients with CHC aged over 65 (mean age 70.1) with amantadine monotherapy [20] . Although treatment was found to be safe with few side effects, amantadine failed to achieve either a sustained biochemical or virologic response. In summary, amantadine appears to be safe, well-tolerated medication for the elderly, but is not effective for CHC.",

As highly active antiretroviral therapy has resulted in markedly improved life spans in patients with HIV infection, liver disease has become an increasingly common cause of morbidity and mortality in this population. There are no therapies currently approved by the United States Food and Drug Administration for HIV-HCV co-infection, and the most recent NIH Consensus Development Conference Statement in 2002 recommended that treatment should be considered on a case-by case basis, particularly in those with stable HIV infection and wellcompensated liver disease [51] . Several small trials have suggested that combination interferon-alpha/ribavirin is safe and well-tolerated in these patients, and may achieve rates of sustained viral clearance similar to those of HCV monoinfected patients [52] [53] [54] [55] . Pegylated interferon in this population will likely be superior to standard combination interferon-alpha and ribavirin. Sax et al. performed a pilot study in which nine patients with HIV co-infection on antiretroviral therapy were treated with interferon-alpha with or without amantadine. Neither treatment regimen resulted in SVR, suggesting that the addition of amantadine to interferon has little effect in this patient population [19] .",

Routine chemoprevention and treatment is not currently recommended in this setting in the absence of data [51] . Although the data is limited, small studies have demonstrated that combination interferon-alpha and ribavirin may be effective in some patients, but is poorly tolerated in most, requiring drug reduction or withdrawal [57] [58] [59] [60] . Pilot data presented at the September 2003 American College of Gastroenterology conference suggests that pegylated interferon/ribavirin achieves high rates of sustained viral clearance in those patients who are able to complete 12 months of therapy, but treatment withdrawal occurs in nearly 50% of patients [62] . Clearly, newer regimens with better tolerated agents are needed. Andreone et al. studied nine consecutive patients with recurrent post-transplantation hepatitis C infection by administering triple therapy (interferon-alpha 3 MU three times weekly, ribavirin 600 mg daily, and amantadine 100 mg daily) for 12 months. Unfortunately, the treatment was very poorly tolerated, with two requiring discontinuation within the first 3 months; only one patient was able to complete 12 months of therapy. During treatment, triple therapy did significantly decrease ALT levels below baseline, but only the patient who completed treatment achieved SVR (11%). Histological improvement on liver biopsy was seen in two patients [61] . This suggests that triple therapy with amantadine in posttransplant patients may result in viral clearance, but few are able to tolerate therapy for 12 months.",

            "text": "Our review of the published data suggested that amatadine may have a minor role in the treatment of CHC, although many issues remain unresolved. The optimal formulation and dosage of amantadine, for example, has been poorly studied. Although amantadine hydrochloride has been the primary drug form studied in research trials, several investi-gators have used amantadine sulphate in combination regimens. It is possible that the choice of formulation may affect treatment outcomes. In the meta-analysis of interferon-amantadine combination therapy in treatment na\u00efve patients, there was a significant difference in the response rate among patients who received amantadine hydrochloride instead of amantadine sulphate (P \u00bc 0.02) (64) . The typical dose used in these studies ranged between 100 and 200 mg daily, although it is unknown if higher doses would result in higher efficacy. Major drawbacks of existing data include small sample sizes, widely divergent selections of patients and treatment protocols. Several studies did not stratify patients according to genotypes, a major predictor of response to interferon-based therapy. This may explain some of the differences in results observed in different countries, as genotype distribution is largely regional in nature. In addition, several studies used nonstandard doses of interferon with or without induction, making comparison or pooling of data difficult. However, these studies demonstrate that amantadine is not effective as monotherapy, and poorly effective when used with interferon alone. Amantadine may be useful as a safe, and well-tolerated adjunct to combination interferon/ribavirin therapy in the treatment of some patients who have failed interferon or interferon/ribavirin for CHC infection ( Table 1 ). The major advantage of amantadine is its favourable safety and tolerability profile and low cost. Although it is a weak antiviral agent with indirect effects on viral replication, multiple observational studies and randomized trials suggest that combination regimens with amantadine may significantly increase rates of sustained viral clearance in nonresponders, responder/relapsers, and breakthrough responders to interferon and interferon/ribavirin. In the absence of available therapies which target the HCV viral replication cycle, amantadine may represent a suitable option in the properly selected patient. Larger, randomized trials are needed to further define the role of amantadine in management of hepatitis C infection, particularly in combination with newer pegylated interferon-based regimens, and in special understudied populations such as the elderly, and patients with HIV-coinfection or recurrent HCV following liver transplantation.",
