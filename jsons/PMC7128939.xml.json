A variety of viruses, including influenza viruses, respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), picornaviruses, coronaviruses, parainfluenza viruses and adenovirus, have been associated with different respiratory syndromes in all age groups [3, 4]. However, the aetiology of a large number of ARTIs is still unknown. Although diagnostic methods may be inadequate, this suggests that other respiratory pathogens may remain to be identified.",

            "text": "During recent years, emerging virus infections that are probably associated with anthropogenic, social and environmental changes have been reported in humans and animals [3, 5]. In 2001, researchers in The Netherlands reported the isolation of a previously unidentified RNA virus from children and adults with ARTI [6]. On the basis of morphological, biochemical and genetic analyses, the new virus seemed to be related closely to avian pneumovirus C, which at that time was the sole member of the Metapneumovirus genus, and which was the aetiological agent of an upper respiratory tract disease in turkeys and other birds [7, 8, 9, 10]. The new virus was therefore classified as the first member of the Metapneumovirus genus of the Pneumovirinae sub-family of the Paramyxoviridae family that was capable of infecting humans, and was designated human metapneumovirus (hMPV) [7, 8, 9, 10]. hMPV differs from the pneumoviruses (such as RSV), which also belong to the Pneumovirinae sub-family, in that it lacks two non-structural proteins and has a slightly different gene order [7, 8, 9, 10]. Genotyping studies have determined that hMPV strains can be classified into two main lineages and four sub-lineages, named A1, A2, B1 and B2 [11]. Nucleotide sequence variation between hMPV types A and B is 11.8\u201347.7%, whereas that between the genotypes within each lineage is less [11].",

The incidence of infection in different studies varies from 1.5% to 25%, thus indicating that hMPV is a ubiquitous virus with a worldwide distribution [12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20]. It is interesting to note that detection rates of hMPV have generally been higher in retrospective studies than in prospective studies, an observation consistent with a degree of selection bias. This indicates that large prospective studies are needed in order to clarify the role of hMPV in various clinical conditions.",

However, as the range of antibody titres measured by immunofluorescence assays was higher in individuals aged >2 years than in children aged 6\u201324 months, it is possible that there is a booster effect as a consequence of re-infection with the same or a closely related virus. In addition, studies of samples collected previously have shown that hMPV is not a new pathogen, with serological evidence of human infection dating from 1958 in The Netherlands, and virus isolation during the last 10\u201320 years in Europe and Canada [7, 8, 9, 10]. These findings suggest that hMPV has been in circulation for a long period, but has been recognised only recently because of the development of new diagnostic methods.",

Thus, it is not known whether dual infection by hMPV and RSV is associated with a more severe disease than that observed when a single virus is the aetiological agent. Greensill et al. [26] detected hMPV in 70% of infants with RSV bronchiolitis who required admission to a paediatric intensive care unit for ventilatory support, thus suggesting that hMPV may influence the severity of RSV disease. Similarly, Semple et al. [27] observed that dual infection with hMPV and RSV confers a tenfold increase in the relative risk of admission to a paediatric intensive care unit for mechanical ventilation. Other recent data support this hypothesis, at least for children aged <3 years [28]. In contrast with these findings, but in agreement with other reports [14, 29, 30], there was no evidence of increased disease severity in a small group of children coinfected with hMPV and RSV or influenza viruses [17]. hMPV has also been identified in patients with SARS in Canada and Hong Kong [31, 32], but probably did not increase the pathogenicity of the novel coronavirus identified as the cause of SARS. However, the possibility of co-infection may lead to an underestimation of the percentage of hMPV-positive samples identified in studies in which only samples negative for other respiratory viruses are tested. This means that all clinical samples (not just samples found to be negative for other viruses) must be tested in order to clarify further the epidemiology of hMPV infections.",

In contrast, it has also been reported that hMPV is a frequent cause of ARTIs in otherwise healthy children, but has a marginal quantitative impact on patients with chronic underlying conditions [17]. Large-scale studies over a long period should reveal the true incidence of hMPV infections among patients with underlying diseases. Furthermore, as a case of life-threatening hMPV pneumonia requiring extracorporeal membrane oxygenation has been described in a pre-term infant [35], the importance of considering this newly discovered pathogen as a possible cause of pneumonia in neonates should be emphasised.",

Specimens obtained by bronchoalveolar lavage within 4 days of the identification of hMPV in the nasal secretions of children with an acute episode of respiratory infection have demonstrated that hMPV affects primarily airway epithelium [40]. Infection of the airway epithelial cells results in cell degeneration and/or necrosis, with ciliacytophthoria and round, red cytoplasmic inclusions on a background of haemosiderinladen macrophages, abundant neutrophils and prominent mucus [40]. These findings, especially the red cytoplasmic inclusions, are similar to those seen in infections by RSV, parainfluenza viruses and measles virus. Lung biopsies, performed at least 1 month after a positive hMPV nasal assay, have shown that later stages of the disease caused by hMPV include expansion of peribronchiolar lymphoid tissue, squamous metaplasia, haemosiderin and accumulation of intra-alveolar foamy macrophages [40]. These features indicate chronic/healing airway inflammation, with a degree of concomitant airway obstruction and impairment of the mucociliary escalator, and correlate well with the bronchiolitis and wheezing noted clinically in patients with hMPV infection.",

The fact that most severe cases are found in paediatric patients suggests that naturally acquired infection induces partial protection against the disease. However, it should be emphasised that there is no cross-protection among the different virus strains. A recent report has described a child who suffered from two episodes of hMPV infection during a 1-month period, each caused by a different strain [41]. Moreover, the degree of severity seems to be related not only to age, but also to the strain causing the infection, with a possible link between the A2 strain, which is the most frequent, and severe disease [10].",

Boivin et al.

Two successive studies by Jartti et al. [15, 43] detected hMPV in 10/132 (8%) and 12/293 (4%) children hospitalised for acute expiratory wheezing, which suggests that hMPV may trigger this disease [15, 43]. Our own study found that wheezing was diagnosed in 25.7% of children with hMPV, and in 23.4% of those with RSV infection [17]. However, the fact that hMPV-positive children are older than children who are RSV-positive may explain why, when wheezing is diagnosed, asthma exacerbation is more common in the former and bronchiolitis in the latter, and why hMPV-positive children have less severe disease, as demonstrated by the lower frequency of hospitalisation. Nevertheless, preliminary results concerning the association between asthma and hMPV infections warrant further research, not least because asthma is a difficult clinical diagnosis to make in children aged <2 years.",

In children who were positive for hMPV, Jartti et al. [43] found two chemokines that have been linked to RSV disease, namely interleukin-8, a chemotactic factor mainly for neutrophils, and RANTES (regulated upon activation, normal T-cell expressed and secreted), a chemotactic factor for eosinophils. In comparison to children with RSV infection, the hMPV-positive children had lower concentrations of RANTES and higher concentrations of interleukin-8 in their respiratory secretions [43]. In contrast, Laham et al. [44] found that although both hMPV and RSV were associated with rhinorrhoea, cough and wheezing, hMPV elicited significantly lower levels of respiratory inflammatory cytokines than did RSV. It is, therefore, not known whether hMPV and RSV share a common pathogenic mechanism or cause disease via different mechanisms.",

Although there was no pathological examination in these cases, that fact that no other pathogens were identified suggests that hMPV infection was the cause of death. In agreement with these observations, Van den Hoogen et al. [33] found that hMPV-positive patients aged >5 years had underlying diseases and presented with more severe clinical signs than those generally observed in younger patients. However, a separate study showed that a child aged 5 years with a diagnosis of acute lymphoblastic leukaemia who was infected with hMPV recovered uneventfully [13]. Although studies of immunocompromised individuals have so far been relatively small, they seem to show that the impact of hMPV is similar to that of RSV and influenza virus infections.",

Because of the existence of two hMPV lineages showing significant genetic variability, hMPV detection may be underestimated when inappropriate primers are used. New rapid and sensitive hMPV assays, based on real-time PCR, allow amplification and detection of hMPV in \u22642 h [47, 48, 49].
