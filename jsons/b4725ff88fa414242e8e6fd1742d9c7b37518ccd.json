Hong Kong is a good choice for clinical trials because the subjects are Chinese and protocols in English do not need to be translated.

While 1 in 7 of the population is a millionaire (US $), 0.3 million are on social welfare. 3 Only a small section of the population can afford private health care and the high-priced treatments, so the majority of patients flock to the public hospitals.",

There are many examples in which the US FDA and EMA reached different decisions on the approval of new drugs. For some cancer drugs, the US FDA may give accelerated approval based on the findings from early-phase trials. The laws of Hong Kong make it difficult to order the withdrawal of a drug from the market based on a lack of efficacy, and so unless considered harmful, a drug with little or no efficacy can remain registered. Therefore, in examining new drug applications, the Registration of Pharmaceutical Products and Substances Committee in Hong Kong looks carefully at the clinical trial evidence on efficacy. A new drug needs to be shown as more efficacious than placebo only; it does not need to be more efficacious than existing drugs. The cost of a new drug, however expensive, or its costeffectiveness is never a consideration in the approval process. Applications for new sources of generic drugs go through a quicker approval process, but biosimilar drugs are treated as new drugs.",

This might have been appropriate at a time when clinical trials were done primarily in the United States and Europe, in white study subjects, but had the disadvantage of delaying the introduction of new drugs for several years. When there are many new life-prolonging cancer drugs being introduced, this kind of delay is unsatisfactory. Moreover, many multicenter trials now enroll patients of Chinese ethnicity, or there may be study sites in mainland China. The need to repeat studies from Phases I to III is much reduced nowadays. Since June 2017, China has been a part of the International Council for Harmonisation of Technical Requirements for Registration of Pharmaceuticals for Human Use. New regulations are being introduced and now overseas-trials data are acceptable for registration purposes in mainland China. For example, a new measure was announced in May 2018 to accelerate the registration of drugs for life-threatening diseases through a prioritized evaluation scheme. 13 The scope of local studies is now reduced, although bridging studies, usually on pharmacokinetics, remain necessary because of known differences in body size and composition, and drug-metabolizing enzymes in the Chinese population. Hong Kong, as a part of China, still has a significant role because trial initiation is quicker, and no translation is needed for the protocol or the other trial documents and records (Table) .",
