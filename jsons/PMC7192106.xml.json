            "text": "The recent covid-19 pandemic has significantly put pressure on our healthcare system around the world. The health emergency has changed the organization of health institutions and focused attention on pandemic management. This has led to important changes in the management of patients without covid-19 and resulted in the most difficult access to care with delay in diagnosis and treatment. Vascular diseases including peripheral arterial disease (PAD) require rapid treatment in most cases. The severity of the PAD is assessed through a functional classification (Fontaine or Rutherford). The most severe grades of classifications include critical limb ischemia (CLI). CLI is defined by resting limb pain and non healing wound/ulcers, or gangrene in 1 or both legs.[1]. CLI requires rapid revascularization to avoid tissue loss and amputation. The introduction of the lockdown in Italy from 9 March led to the closure of outpatient activities and prevented early observation of patients with CLI. Furthermore, the fear of contagion led to the underestimation of the symptoms and also delayed access to treatment through the emergency room. For this reason, patients with severe CLI with important septic ulcers and gangrene arrived at our vascular surgery department. For most of these it was not possible to save the limbs and therefore they underwent amputation surgery. We observed that the number of amputations performed in our department in the period between March 9 and April 20 was significantly greater than those performed in the same period last year. In particular, we performed nine amputations during this period compared to five amputations performed last year in the same period. An increase of almost 50%. It is our opinion that the Covid-19 pandemic has led to a poor management of patients with other pathologies and it is necessary to adopt more suitable measures to avoid other serious consequences on the health of citizens. Consequently, it would be necessary to identify paths that allow these patients to have rapid access to treatment with a marked outcome improvement.",
