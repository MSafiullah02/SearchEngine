Health Canada estimated that the outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) resulted in a net cost to their national economy to be between $1.5 billion and $2.1 billion and 916 deaths.6, 7 The potential economic impact of a bioterrorism attack could range from $477.7 million per 100,000 persons exposed (for a an attack using brucellosis) to $26.2 billion per 100,000 persons exposed (if anthrax is used as the bioterrorism agent).8 Of all disasters, pandemics pose the largest risk of having infectious disease implications. It has been estimated that an influenza pandemic could cost between $71 and $166 billion and result in 89,000 to 207,000 deaths in the United States.9 It is essential that the infection prevention profession be involved in emergency management to help mitigate the infectious disease implications of disasters. The purposes of this article are to provide an overview of the historical role of the infection prevention profession in emergency management and describe the proceedings from an Association for Professionals in Infection Control and Epidemiology, Inc (APIC)-sponsored Mini-Summit on Emergency Management conducted in May 2008.",

An APIC Task Force for Bioterrorism Preparedness was created in 1999 to address infection prevention issues related to a biologic attack. Soon after, the Task Force was renamed to the APIC Task Force for Bioterrorism and Emerging Infectious Diseases Preparedness, and its mission was expanded to address emerging infections, such as SARS and avian influenza. In 2005, the APIC Bioterrorism and Emerging Infectious Diseases Preparedness Task Force became an official APIC committee. At this time, the focus of the group expanded once more to include an all-hazards approach, which is in line with standard emergency management principles. The APIC Emergency Preparedness Committee now focuses on creating educational and reference materials related to preventing infection transmission for all types of disasters.",

Examples of other APIC initiatives include conducting a needs assessment to identify educational and planning products desired by APIC members,5 working with Trust for America's Health to assess US hospital disaster preparedness in 2005 and 2007,12, 13 expanding the emergency preparedness component of the APIC Web site, and developing health policy and guidelines related to infection prevention during disasters.14, 15 In addition, numerous educational products and programs have been created in relation to infection prevention in emergency management. In late 2007, APIC Headquarters identified the need to define further the role of the infection prevention profession in emergency management, especially as it relates to the role the APIC as an organization will play in this arena. A Mini-Summit on Emergency Preparedness was planned for early 2008.",

In addition, targeted questions were posed to individual organizational representatives to determine their unique perspective on emergency management and how the APIC might work with them. For instance, representatives from the Department of Homeland Security were asked how the APIC might aid their agency in emergency management activities. Discussion topics included the current status and role of infection prevention professionals in emergency management, challenges and gaps in disaster preparedness, communication needs, and the APIC strengths and opportunities in emergency management. The APIC staff recorded key ideas and findings from the Mini-Summit on flip charts, and attendees clarified points as needed as the meeting progressed.",

Key points from this discussion are outlined in Table 1\n. In essence, the participants thought that there are still a lot of gaps in emergency management that may have infectious disease implications. The most frequently cited concern was the lack of education and compliance with basic infection prevention practice across all disciplines of health care workers, response agency employees, and the general public. Participants stressed that nonhospital-based workers, such as first responders, home health employees, and public health professionals, are most lacking in infection prevention education. It was also mentioned that many nonhospital-based workers lack access to existing communication methods for transmitting infection prevention information, such as the Health Alert Network, which puts them at an even greater disadvantage during a disaster when trying to gain information about preventing disease spread. There was also a concern expressed by the Mini-Summit participants about the lack of expertise about emergency management principles among IPs. If IPs are not familiar with emergency management and understand their role in this process, it will be very difficult for them to provide guidance to noninfection prevention professionals who will look to the IP for advice. Educating IPs on emergency management needs to be a top priority.",

Individual IPs involved in emergency preparedness need to develop relationships both inside their facility/entity and externally with other responding agencies and groups. Participants emphasized that it is vital that IPs become more involved in emergency management at the community level, including consulting with alternate care sites and shelters on establishing or improving infection control programs in these settings. Resources, including IPs' time, will be stretched during disasters. Therefore, IPs need to find innovative ways to implement infection prevention strategies during disasters. Preestablished relationships and infection prevention programs, including those potentially coordinated by noninfection prevention professionals, will help maximize IPs' impact and minimize infection transmission during disasters.",

These partnerships will allow the APIC to make a bigger impact on emergency management at the local, state, and federal levels. A primary focus needs to be on building a greater awareness of the APIC as the preeminent infection prevention organization. This will facilitate individual IP's acceptance in emergency management groups as the expert in infection prevention related to disasters. In addition, a heightened awareness of the APIC among emergency management organizations will allow the APIC to make a larger impact on health policy, which should result in better patient outcomes. The participants emphasized that the Mini-Summit was a great first step in building important partnerships in emergency management and establishing the APIC as the organization to approach when decisions need to be made regarding infection prevention strategies during disasters.",

The need to coordinate message content with the CDC, Department of Homeland Security, and other response agencies was also emphasized. Participants emphasized that a unified message needs to be provided during disasters, and this can best be done through the establishment of partnerships and open communication between the response agencies.",
