While an extended lockdown is highly effective, other measures such as shielding older populations, universal testing and facemasks can all potentially contribute to a reduction of infections and deaths. However, based on current evidence it seems unlikely they will be as effective as continued lockdown. In order to achieve elimination and lift lockdown within 5 months, the best strategy seems to be a combination of weekly universal testing, contact tracing and use of facemasks, with concurrent lockdown. This approach could potentially reduce deaths by 48% compared with continued lockdown alone.",

Since it was first reported from Wuhan, China [1] , it has spread globally causing high mortality, particularly among people with pre-existing conditions. In response to the pandemic, several mathematical models have been used to investigate the spread of COVID-19, along with the effectiveness of interventions to interrupt transmission [2] [3] [4] [5] [6] [7] [8] . However, these studies have largely focused on early dynamics and the impact of control strategies nationally in the initial phase of the pandemic. Far fewer studies have evaluated the potential options for a post-lockdown future after suppressing new transmissions [9, 10] , or modelled spread in metropolitan areas [11] [12] [13] .",

Here we use Transport for London (TfL) data to define a contact matrix between the 33 London boroughs to analyse the evolution of the epidemic, and show the impact that local travel restriction has on the transmission of the virus in the English capital. The suppression of COVID-19 in South Korea and the successful containment in Wuhan suggest that a combination of lockdown and non-pharmaceutical interventions may allow control of the epidemic to be established [9, 10] .

In the context of a novel pathogen, mathematical modelling is fundamental in estimating the short-and long-term effects of possible control strategies, in order to inform national policy decisions. Here we present a comprehensive analysis of transmission dynamics of SARS-CoV-2 in London, integrating data from Public Health England (PHE), NHS and TfL. To our knowledge, no other studies have focused on assessing COVID-19 transmission in London. In our analyses, we confirm that lockdown is a highly effective strategy in reducing infections and mortality, as is clear from empirical data in many countries. Our data show that lifting of lockdown would likely lead to a resurgence of cases, leading to a second peak, as shown by other modelling approaches [10] . However, since lockdown has severe societal and economic implications, we assume that this renders it an unsustainable intervention in the mediumto long-term. We therefore comprehensively assessed a range of potential public health strategies that may be implemented to facilitate lifting of the national lockdown. We find that a strategy that combines continued lockdown with universal testing with case isolation, contact tracing and isolation, and facemask use by the general population is the only scenario with the potential for higher effectiveness in reducing infections, number of deaths and the duration of lockdown, compared to ongoing lockdown with no additional interventions. This strategy can potentially reduce the number of deaths up to 48%, leading to early elimination of the infection from London over an interval of four to six months. At this point, release of lockdown may be possible, though this would have to be followed by sustained measures to prevent importation and contain minioutbreaks where cases are inadvertently imported once virtual elimination is achieved until a vaccine or effective treatment is found.",

Firstly, local, district-level lockdown had little effect on city-wide transmission when implemented after the infection has seeded to other areas or imported from overseas. Such an approach may still be of value if implemented before infections have spread beyond the local level. Second, restricting lockdown to the 60+ age group only results in a reduction of 37% of total deaths within this age group, but has little effect on the younger population. Third, less-stringent social distancing, encompassing encouragement of home-working and avoidance of mass gatherings, with weekly or more frequent universal testing with case isolation has little effect in reducing infections and deaths in the absence of concurrent lockdown.",

Furthermore, the recent observed increase in all-cause mortality during lockdown, which is in part due to individuals dying from other causes warrants investigation. Nevertheless, lifting the lockdown early, in the absence of other robust control measures, would likely lead to a resurgence of cases and deaths, due to new transmission from residual cases and the ongoing risk of importation. This was recently seen in the Hokkaido prefecture in Japan, where its state of emergency was lifted on 19 th March and then reintroduced less than a month later because of a resurgence in numbers of cases.",

However, adherence to such consistent and proper use has been generally poor in prior studies so there is not a strong body of evidence to support effectiveness of their use in practice, beyond use by health care workers [25, 26] . We conducted sensitivity analyses to consider what effects might be possible should adherence to efficacious face covering use be higher than that seen in past research studies, which suggest we should not rule out the possibility of substantial benefits from widespread facemask use.",

Firstly, despite making every effort to obtain the best available data for model parameterisation, some data were lacking in the wider literature. Specifically, additional data on hospital admissions and testing and uptake of interventions would be needed for more precise calibration of mortality and notification rates. The lack of community testing data results in more uncertainty in estimates of the size of the epidemic and the cause of deaths in settings such as nursing homes. Moreover, the recent emergence of SARS-CoV-2 entails the use of important epidemic assumptions, such as the assumed efficacy of the interventions evaluated in the absence of randomised controlled trials evaluating each measure on COVID-19. However, our overall results are supported by observations that the cities with current low notifications and deaths are employing the same measures. Furthermore, we assumed natural history characteristics of COVID-19, however, these are in line with other recent COVID-19 models. [4-6, 8, 10, 13-17, 27] We used UK-specific parameters such as hospital and ICU admissions, and disease assumptions on latency period, time to recovery and asymptomatic infectiousness from a recent analysis by Ferguson et al [27] , which analysed the UK epidemic in detail. This approach ensures consistency in assumptions with this previous work. While we used this previous work [27, 28] as starting points for the calculation of the mortality rates in our model, we obtained different results as we also calibrated the model to local deaths data from the NHS.",

Successful implementation of this approach would require massive scale-up of testing infrastructure, novel contact-tracing strategies, and adherence to case isolation, contact quarantine and facemask use by the general population [29] . The scale and speed of innovation and investment needed will be massive, however, the potential economic gain and human lives saved by such measures would likely be worthwhile, if the need for long-term lockdown can be averted.",
