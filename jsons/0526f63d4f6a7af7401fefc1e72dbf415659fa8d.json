The results indicated a rate of 9.5% for infection and a rate from 0.3% to 0.6%, for death.

To have a suitable plan for COVID-19, forecasting the future confirmed cases are critical. An optimization method, named FPASSA-ANFIS, has been proposed by [22] to model the number of confirmed cases of COVID-19 and to predict its future values using collected data in China.

The SIR epidemic modelling can be done at local (country) level but the autoregressive model can be good to look at overall patterns.

The number of confirmed cases has increased daily in different countries, especially in U.S.A, Italy, Spain, Iran, China and others. The spread of COVID-19 has many dangers and needs strict special plans and policies. Therefore, to consider plans and policies, predicting and forecasting the future confirmed and recoveries cases are critical. The autoregressive time series models are a useful tool to model data over time. However, some of the standard time series models are based on the assumption that the error term or residuals are symmetric (Gaussian). There exist many situations in the real world that the assumption of symmetric distribution of the error terms is not satisfactory. In our methodology, we considered autoregressive time series models based on the two-piece scale mixture normal (TP-SMN) distributions. The results indicated that the proposed method performed well in forecasting confirmed and recovered COVID-19",

            "text": "~ ( ). (see e.g. [39,40].) Because in many real world time series data, classical modelling based on the symmetrical/light-tailed distributions are not satisfactory, in our methodology we have used autoregressive time series model (1) based on asymmetric/heavy-tailed TP-SMN distributions. Therefore we assume the error terms in (1) are distributed as TP-SMN distributions, denoted by ~ -!\"#($, %, &, ') and ~ -!\"#-( ). See details of the proposed distributions and model in refs.[34][35][36][37][38].In this paper we modeled the total number of confirmed and recovered COVID-19 cases in the world by the proposed autoregressive time series model so-called TP-SMN-AR models which includes the symmetric Gaussian and asymmetric heavy-tailed non-Gaussian autoregressive time series models. The various members of the proposed autoregressive models were fitted initially to the historical numbers of confirmed and recovered COVID-19 cases in the world. Then, the autoregressive time series that has the best fit to each of the dataset is selected. Finally, the selected models are used to predict the number of confirmed and recovered COVID-19 cases in the world from 21-Apr-2020 up to 30-Apr-2020, and we measure the differences between the real and predicted values to show the performance of the models. Therefore, the main contribution points of the current study are as follows: an improved autoregressive time series model based on the TP-SMN distributions, and a new efficient predictive model applied to predict and estimate the confirmed and recovered COVID-19 cases in the world using past and current data. Note that a sample copy of the code is available from the authors upon request.2. Modelling the confirmed and recovered cases of the COVID-19 in the worldThe coronavirus (COVID-19) is affecting about 212 countries and territories around the world and two international conveyances. The daily data for COVID-19 in the world are reported by the China NationalHealth Commission (NHC) and World Health Organization (WHO). In this part we fit the TP-SMN-AR time series model to the total confirmed COVID-19 cases from 22-Jan-2020 to 30-Apr-2020 and also to the total recovered COVID-19 cases from 02-Feb-2020 to 30-Apr-2020, in the world.",
