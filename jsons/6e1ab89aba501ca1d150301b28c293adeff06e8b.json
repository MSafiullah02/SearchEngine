            "text": "Background: Hepatocellular damage in acute and chronic HBV infections is considered to be caused by the host's immune response rather than by the virus itself. UPA~'~-SCID mice transplanted with human hepatocytes were infected with HBV to examine whether HBV causes hepatocellular damage in a severely immune-deficient host. Methods: Five uPA+/+-SCID mice were transplanted with human hepatocytes and subsequently infected with HBV. At several timepoints post infection (p.i.), human albumin, HBsAg, HBeAg, and HBV DNA concentrations were measured in plasma. HBV infection and hepatocellular changes were monitored using immunohistochemistry and electron microscopy. Results: HBsAg, HBeAg. HBV DNA levels progressively rose in the weeks p.i. to reach peak values around week 4 (HBsAg >2O, OOO IUlml; HBeAg >750 PEIUlml; HBV DNA >5x1010 coplml). Thereafter, the concentrations of these markers declined. A sigruficant correlation was observed between HBsAg and HBeAg (r=0.9808, P<O.OoOl), HBsAg and HBV DNA (r=0.8710, P<O.OOOl) and HBeAg.and HBV DNA (r=0.9344, P<O.OoOl). There was no correlation between human albumin and any viral marker. Albumin levels remained constant for several weeks but also declined around week 4 p.i, which coincided with the start of a progressive clinical deterioration, ultimately leading to the death of the animals. Mice succumbed on average 50 days p.i., whereas uninfected animals survived for at least an additional 150 days. The livers of 2 long-term infected mice (73 and 88 days p.i.) were morphologically compared with that of an animal sacrificed 4 weeks p.i. (referred to as short-term infection). Compared with short-term infection, human hepatocytes within long-term infected animals had a typical 'ground-glass aspect', showed much more pronounced staining for HBsAg and HBcAg and stained poorly for albumin. Moreover, these human hepatocytes did not proliferate and signs of considerable cell damage and loss were present, which was not the case in the short-term infected mouse liver. Ultrastructural analysis of long-term infected human hepatocytes showed an abundant presence of cylindrical HBsAg structures and Dane.particles, while these structures were much less frequent in short-term infected hepatocytes. Conclusion: Long-term infection with HBV of human hepatocytes residing in a chimeric uPA-SCID mouse causes dramatic intracellular changes and hepatocellular damage, indicating that HBV has endogenous cytopathic effects. The overwhelming staining of human hepatocytes for HBcAg and HBsAg in an immune deficient host is partly reminiscent of fibrosing cholestatic hepatitis in immunosuppressed patients and suggests that cytopathic effects of HBV do not develop in an immune competent host in whom the pathogenesis of liver damage is predominantly immune-mediated.",

End-treatment responders (ETR) were patients with normal ALT and undetectable serum HBV-DNA by Digene assay; non responders (NR) had high ALT and HBV-DNA positivity throughout treatment; sustained viral responders (SVR) had normal ALT and undetectable HBV-DNA during post-treatment follow-up. RE-SULTS. At the end of treatment, PCNA-LI, Nucleolar-index and Ishak grading were significantly reduced and APO-I was significantly increased (Table) . Significantly changes of proliferation and apoptosis scores were observed only in 24 ETR (61%) whereas Ishak grading significantly decreased in both groups of patients (Table) . During 6 3 yr of post-treatment follow-up, 3 patients (1 SVR, 1 NR, 1 relapse) developed HCC with an annual incidence of 0.9%. The proliferative indexes decreased during treatment in all 3 patients and apoptosis increased in 2 patients. CONCLUSIONS. The reduction of liver cell proliferation and the increase of apoptosis during treatment encourage long-term administration of IFN to prevent HCC in HBe-Ag patients. Ezm, f3.4 i2.6",

The fusion protein ECFP-ZNF267 was constitutively localized in the nucleus. Next, we assessed whether ZNF267 contains a transcriptional regulatory domain using a GAL4 based reporter gene system. Full length ZNF267 and various constructs containing deletions in the N-terminal or C-terminal region of ZNF267 were fused with a GAL4 DNA binding domain to transactivate a GAL4 responsive promoter driving luciferase expression. Full length ZNF267 and all constructs encompassing KRAB A domain showed transcriptional repressor activity as compared to GAL4 DNA binding domain alone. In contrast, a construct with a deletion of the KRAB A domain displayed no transcriptional repression. To identify genes negatively regulated by ZNF267, ZNF267 was ectopically expressed in HEK 293 cells, and overexpression was confirmed by RT-PCR and immunoprecipitationlwestem blotting. Full length ZNF267 protein was detected with an approximate molecular weight of 90 kD. Using cDNA microarray analysis, cells overexpressing ZNF267 showed lower expression of MMP-10 (8.6-fold) as compared to cells transfected with a control vector. Differential gene expression of MMP-10 was confirmed by RNase protection assay. In addition, using reporter gene assays ZNF267 repressed MMP-10 promoter activity in a dose dependent manner. In conclusion, ZNF267 as a member of the Kruppel-like family of zinc finger proteins is induced during the activation process of human HSCs and in cirrhotic liver. Our results suggest that ZNF267 as a negative transcriptional regulator of MMP-10 might promote liver fibrogenesis through alteration in matrix degradation in viva Chronic inflammation underlies the majority of liver diseases and is strongly implicated in the pathogenesis of liver fibrosislcirrhosis. NF-kB plays a pivotal role in regulating the expression of inflammatory cytokines and chemokines, however the signalling mechanisms are not clearly understood. We have previously reported that mice lacking the p50 subunit of NF-kB develop more severe inflammation and fibrosis upon chronic injury of the liver.",

            "text": "The current study provides a molecular mechanism responsible for the anti-inflammatory function of p50. Examination of cytokine gene expression in p50 deleted mice revealed a 5-fold higher induction of TNFalpha (TNFa) in activated hepatic stellate cells (HSC) and livers of injured mice relative to wild type controls. Using HSC isolated from p50-I-and WT mice transfected with a TNFa-luc promoter construct we observed a 10-fold increase in promoter activity in p50-I-HSC, which was repressed by co-transfection with a p50 expression vector. Homodmers of p50 can bind to NF-kB sites as a stable complex with the histone deacetylase HDACl which functions as a transcriptional repressor by promoting a condensed chromatin structure. We show that the HDAC inhibitor trichostatin A (TSA) will derepress TNFa transcription in wild type but not p50-deleted HSC however replenishment of p50 in the latter will restore TSA responsiveness. Over-expression of HDACl repressed TNFa transcription in wild type but not in p50 -I-HSC. These data indicate that HDACl inhibits TNFa production via a p50-dependant mechanism in at least one of the key pro-inflammatory and wound healing cells of the liver. This provides a protective mechanism guarding against excessive inflammatory and fibrogenic responses. In conclusion the p50-HDAC1 complex is a critical protective component in the hepatic inflammatory response and as such is a new potential therapeutic target.",

The mean age for patients reporting IDU was 29 yearssignificantly younger than the mean of 44 years for patients with iatrogenicloccupational risk (~5.001) and 38 years for patients with unknown risk (p= .04). 1 of 5 patients with iatrogenic exposure shared a household with IDU; 4 had no other potential risk factors for HCV infection. The medical procedures likely leading to infection were patella transplant for 2, breast augmentation surgery for 1, and intravenous catheter placement for 1 subject. Sequencing of the HCV highly variable region 1 (HVRI) has confirmed that the same donor infected both recipients of the patella transplants. For 7 patients with unknown risk, high risk sexual exposures were frequent: 3 (43%) reported sex with an IDU, 2 (29%) described more than 6 lifetime sex partners, and 3 (43%) described age of first sex < 15 years. HVRl sequencing confirmed sexual transmission in 1 patient whose sexual partner had chronic HCV. For 32 patients with baseline HCV RNA titer results, 20 (62%) were viremic, with median HCV RNA titer of 415, 968 IUlml (range 3, 638 to 8, 333, 333 IUlml) . A greater proportion of women (64%) than men (17%) had undetectable HCV RNA at baseline (p=.Ol). The median baseline HCV RNA titers for patients in the IDU, iatrogenicloccupational, intranasal cocaine, and unknown categories were 456, 651 IUlml, 646, 650 IUlml, 3, 625, 338 IUlml, and 350, 421 IUlml, respectively (NS). Conclusions: For 37 patients with acute HCV, only 54% were IDU. Iatrogenic exposure was the only identified risk factor in 11% of subjects. For patients with unknown risk factors, high-risk sexual behaviors were common. The older age at the time of infection is consistent with HCV being less efficiently transmitted sexually than through IDU. Women Leptin has been shown to be a mediator of hepatic inflammation and fibrosis in non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). Resistin and adiponectin have been shown to be important modulators of insulin resistance, a central factor in the pathogenesis of NAFLD. Aim: We evaluated 1) whether adipokine levels are different among patients (pts) with NAFLD when compared to obese and lean controls, and 2) whether adipokine levels are predictive of steatohepatitis (SH) grade and stage. Methods: 20 controls (10 lean and 10 obese individuals without evidence of liver disease: normal liver tests and no fatty infiltration on ultrasound) and 20 pts with biopsy proven NAFLD (10 with simple steatosis (SS) and 10 with NASH) were prospectively studied. Demographic, anthropometric measurements, DEXA, liver tests, HOMA and CRP were measured in all participants. Leptin, resistin and adiponectin levels were determined by ELISA. Results: Characteristics of participants are summarized in the table. Compared to controls, pts with NAFLD (SS and NASH) were older, and tended to have higher BMI, total and truncal fat, insulin resistance, transaminases, and leptin levels but lower ASTIALT, adiponectin and resistin levels. Compared to SS, subjects with NASH (SH grade 2 2) had higher BMI, total and truncal fat, evidence of insulin resistance, AST, ALT, ASTlALT and CRP levels. Leptin (23.7218.7 vs 56.4222, p 0,001) and resistin (0.8520.31 vs1.3420.39, p 0.006), but not adiponectin (12.223.4 vs 14.7A9.4, p 0.4) levels, were higher in subjects with NASH than with SS. The combination of thoxamine (MTX; M; al-adrenergic agonist), dose-response curves induced by S-nitroso-N-acetylpenicillamine (SNAP) were obtained using 6 cumulative doses of this spontaneous N O donor (10' to 3.10-5 M). 3) In additional experiments using cirrhotic livers, the intrahepatic vascular response to M T X (lo4 M) was tested in the absence and the presence of the PDE-5 inhibitor zaprinast (3.104 M). Results: 1) PDE-5 expression in cirrhotic livers was significantly higher than in normal livers (Fig) .",

The incidence of serious AE's in the infants was also similar in both groups (5/56 [9%] versus 3/59 [~O/O], respectively). CONCLUSION The rate of HBV vertical transmission was significantly reduced in infants receiving HBV vaccine and HBIg whose mothers received lamivudine in the 8 weeks (+/-2 weeks) prior to delivery compared to those whose mothers received placebo. No safety concerns were observed in either the mothers or the infants. Lamivudine is a well-tolerated and effective addition to the current management options available to control the vertical transmission of HBV from mothers to infants. exposures, livers were stained with H&E to evaluate steatosis, inflammation, and necrosis. Other parameters measured include protein levels of CYP2E1 and 2B and mtDNA damage. Steady weight gains were obtained during the 4 wk exposure to alcohol and ETS, indicating adequate nutrition. On average, mice consumed 26 grams ethanollkglday with exposure to FA or ETS having no effect on ethanol consumption. Four weeks of ethanol consumption significantly increased the liverlbody weight ratios in treatment groups with the greatest increase observed in ethanol-fed male mice exposed to ETS (7.1 0.005%) as compared to ethanol-fed male mice exposed to FA (5.9 & 0.002%). There were no pathological changes seen in livers of mice fed control diets with and without ETS. Ethanol consumption induced a mild degree of steatosis and minimal inflammation. However, exposure to ethanol and ETS resulted in significant steatosis affecting up to 60% of hepatocytes across all zones of the liver lobule. Fatty changes were accompanied by increasing foci of inflammation and necrosis. Levels of CYP2El and 2B were induced by ethanol with further increases observed in mice co-exposed to ETS. Similarly, the greatest degree of mtDNA damage was observed in groups exposed to ethanol and ETS indicating a significant oxidative stress in mitochondria. In summary, we have shown using an animal model of hypercholesterolemia, the ApoE-l-mouse, an interaction of two important environmental agents, alcohol and ETS, to induce significant liver pathology. These studies indicate that the ApoE-l-mouse might be a useful model to investigate mechanisms of fatty liver disease, which is a component of several diseases including diabetes, obesity, and alcoholism. Alcohol has been shown to augment or attenuate inflammation depending on acute or chronic administration and the type of stimulation. Lipopolysaccharide (LPS), a ligand of toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4), plays an important role in alcoholic liver disease. TLR4 induced downstream signaling pathways are also triggered by TLR2 ligands. The goal of this studv was to determine the effects of acute alcohol on inflammatory cell stimulation induced through TLR2, TLR4 or their combination.",

Results: In human monocytes that express both TLR2 and TLR4, acute alcohol (25 mM) attenuated induction of TNFa by LPS, the selective TLR4 ligand but not by the TLR2 ligand, PGN. In contrast, alcohol augmented TNFa production when both TLR2 and TLR4 stimulation were present (p<.Ol). Attenuation of TLR4-, no change in TLR2and augmentation of TLR2+TLR44nduced inflammation (20X increase) by alcohol was also seen at the TNFa mRNA level. Alcohol treatment resulted in the same pattern of changes in CHOlCD14lTLR2 cells; it attenuated TLR4-but augmented TLR2+TLR4-induced NFKB activation. Interleukin-1 receptor associated kinase (IRAK), a downstream element of TLR activation, was inhibited by alcohol upon TLR4 but augmented after TLR2+TLR4 stimulation. The inhibitory IRAK-M showed changes opposite of IRAK kinase activity: alcohol increased IRAK-M levels in TLR4-and reduced IRAK-M in TLW+TLRIstimulated monocytes. Mitogen activated kinases were also activated via TLR2 andlor TLR4. We found no changes in TLR2andlor TLR4-induced p38 phosphorylation by alcohol in monocytes. However, TLR4-induced ERK phosphorylation was inhibited by alcohol (p<.O5). In contrast, TLR2+TLR44nduced JNK phosphorylation was increased by alcohol (p<.05). Consistent with JNK activation, AP-1 nuclear binding was increased by alcohol in TLR2+TLR4-but not in TLR2or TLR4-stimulated monocytes. Finally, the JNK inhibitor II prevented alcohol-induced augmentation of TNFa production in TLR2+TLR4-stimulated monocytes. Conclusion: Acute alcohol has different effects on TLRI and TLR2 induced cell activation. Inhibition of TLR4-induced inflammation by alcohol involves reduced IRAK kinase activity and ERK phosphorylation. In contrast, upon TLR2 plus TLR4 stimulation, alcohol augments inflammation via IRAK activity and JNK phosphorylation leading to increased NFKB and AP-1 induction. These differences in TLR2 and TLR4 mediated signals may play a role in inflammatory cell activation in alcoholic liver disease.

Fhit belongs with galactose-1-phosphate uridylyltransferase to the small family of HIT proteins, which bind nucleotides through their characteristic Histidine triad domain. We identified a new HIT protein which is predominantly expressed in the liver,' HintZ. Previously described Hintl and the yeast homolog Hntl, are AMP-NH2 hydrolases, which regulate Cdk7. Hintl is also purported to be a PKC inhibitor, but the results are inconclusive. Our aim was to determine whether Hint2 shares properties with other HIT homologs. Methods: 1) Expression of Hint2 in bacteria and purification by AMP-agarose affinity chromatography. 2) Overlay, immunoprecipitation and phosphorylation assay with PKCs-enriched rat brain preparations. 3) Hydrolytic activity for a range of adenosine substrates. 4) Site directed mutagenesis of the third histidine of the HIT domain (Hint2H149A). 5) Transfection of HEK cells with chimeric constructs of Hint2 with CFP and stable transfection of HepG2 cells with Hint2, HinKH149A and vector. 6) Incubation of HepG2 cells with ethanol or a combination of anti-Fas antibodylactinomycin. 7) Western blots for proteins of the Bcl and caspase families 8) Flow cytometry with annexin V and propidium iodide. Results: In contrary to the cytosolic Hintl, Hint2 was localized into the mitochondria. Hint2-GFP co-localized with Mitotracker, but GFP-HmtZ, remained in the cytoplasm losing its targeting sequence. The best substrate for Hint2 was adenosine-5'-phosphoraminidate.

Hint2 is not a PKC inhibitor, but Hint2 is an AMP-lysine hydrolase and this function depends on the histidine triad domain. This implies that Hint2 may influence the adenylylation of mitochondrial proteins. Finally, overexpression of Hint2 sensitizes hepatocytes to apoptosis suggesting that like Fhit its disruption may play a role in carcinogenesis.

The hepatocellular effect of NAC was investigated after oxidative liver injuEy induced by tert-butylhydroperoxide (t-BHP) or acetaminophen. All mice were injected with 13C-labelled substrates (glucose, oxaloacetate, propionate, acetate, pyruvate, taurine; i.v.) Liver and blood samples were extracted, and IH-, 13Cand 31P-NMR spectra were recorded (Baker DRX 600 spectrometer). Flux of 13C through metabolic pathways was followed up by W-isotopomer analysis. Results. Mice liver GSH levels increased up to a peak of 142% of control using 300 mglkg NAC; higher NAC doses led to 55% impairment in de w o GSH synthesis from (U-13C]glucose. Hypotaurine (HTau), which can be synthesized from cysteine, was hardly detectable in controls. However, liver HTau increased linearly with the NAC doses up to m-fold (r = 0.996; p<O.001). Stimulated HTau formation was not detected in any other organ. Considerable HTau formation in parallel with decreased GSH synthesis due to impaired biosynthetic activity was confirmed in isolated rat hepatocytes after treatment with NAC (1-6 mM, 15 min -7 h). When NAC was investigated concomitantly with GSH-depletion induced by t-BHP, NAC compensated for GSH efflux by stimulating de novo synthesis (p<O.OOl). Furthermore, under oxidative-stress, NAC induced oxidation of HTau to taurine (p<O.OOl). Metabolic flux through pyruvate dehydrogenase, the key enzyme for mitochondria1 energy metabolism, increased to 145% of control (p<O.OOl). Anaplerotic flux through pyruvate carboxylase, responsible for the biosynthesis of amino acids, decreased considerably and was unmeasurable at 600 mglkg NAC. On the other hand, NAC stimulated the anaplerotic pathway through malic enzyme and gluconeogenesis, leading to an increase in the synthesis of glucose from TCA cycle intermediates by 72% (p<O.001). Furthermore, the acetyl-moiety in NAC was responsible for an increased fatty acid synthesis. Conclusions. Altough NAC is potent at replenishing liver GSH, this is in fact limited by an inhibition of flux through pyruvate carboxylase and increased carbon shunting through gluconeogenesis. At doses used in the clinical setting, NAC significantly modifiy metabolic pathways, independent from GSH synthesis, which can be benefial or deleterious in acute liver injury. We believe that the resulting balance between these different metabolic pathways determine the effect of a given NAC dose. (UGT) have been studied for their association with inheritable and mutagen-induced diseases as well as side effects of drugs. Gilbert's disease is characterized by a TATA box polymorphism of the hepatic bilirubin transferase (UGTlA1'28) and leads to unconjugated non-hemolytic hyperbilirubinemia. Irinotecan, an antitumor agent, administered in colorectal cancer patients undergoes glucuronidation by various UGT proteins. Patients with Gilbert's disease have a higher risk of irinotecan side effects which include myelotoxicity and diarrhea. Since patients exhibit signs of severe toxicity in the absence of UGTlA1'28 alleles we proposed that other polymorphisms in the UGTlA gene locus may be of relevance. Methods: SNP-Detection was performed by PCR analysis and DNA sequencing in addition to Taqman 5'-nuclease assays for allelic discrimination genotyping in 382 healthy blood donors and 200 patients with suspected Gilbert's disease. Promoter activity was measured by a luciferase reporter gene assays, and enzyme activity was estimated by in vitro catalytic glucuronidation assays. Results: We identified a novel polymorphism in the TATA region upstream of the UGTlA7 gene with an allele frequency of 461 and 0,39 in healthy blood donors, indicating that thymidine represents the wildtype sequence. The T to G exchange resulted in a 70% reduction of the UGTlA7 promoter activity. Catalytic activity results demonstrated that UGTlA7 is the major isoform for irinotecan glucuronidation with the highest specific activity, which is 5-fold higher than that of UGTIAI. The analysis of 200 patients with suspected Gilbert's disease identified 71 homozygous UGTlA1'28 camers out of whom 97% carried at least one allele of the novel UGTlA7 promoter polymorphism. Discussion: We identify only the second novel functional polymorphism in the UGTlA gene locus, Reduced promoter activity of the UGTlA7 gene leads to a reduced detoxification of irinotecan. The strong association of the UGTlA7 promoter SNP with UGTlA'28 may explain the increased risk of irinotecan toxicity in patients with Gilbert's disease. Therefore, the variant UGTlA7 promoter is implicated as a genetic predisposition for anti-tumor chemotherapy tolerance and can be used as a marker to predict irinotecan-induced side effects . The detection of the benign liver disease designated Gilbert's syndrome is an indicator of a complex metabolic disposition impacting the treatment of colorectal cancer and possibly other drug therapies undergoing glucuronidation by UGTlAl and UGTlA7.

MRP3 is present in the basolateral membrane of several epithelia including hepatocytes and enterocytes. The AIM of this study was to investigate the role of Mrp3 in drug disposition. Because Mrp3 preferentially transports glucuronides we investigated the metabolism and disposition of acetaminophen (APAP). Metabolism of this drug occurs by sulfation, glucuronidation and glutathione conjugation of a CYP450-derived intermediate in the liver. The glutathione conjugate (APAP-GSH) is secreted into bile via Mrp2 while the glucuronide (APAP-GLU) is secreted into the urine. Methods: Wild type and Mrp3-l-mice (both against mixed FVBlN and 129/OLA background) were fasted overnight and the bile duct was cannulated. The animals received a non-toxic dose of APAP (150 mglkg i.v.) after which bile was sampled during 120 min after administration in 10 min intervals. Urine was collected from the bladder at the end of the experiment. Basolateral and canalicular excretion of APAP and metabolites was also assessed in the isolated perfused liver. Results: at 120 min after administration no differences were found in the biliary excretion of unmetaboliied M A P (0.7% of dose), APAP-sulphate (0.2% of dose), and APAP-GSH (16% of dose) between Mrp3-l-and wild-type mice. However, APAP-GLU excretion in bile of Mrp3-l-mice was ten-fold higher in Mrp3-lmice than in wild types (6.1 f . 0.8% vs. 0.6 +-0.2% of dose respectively). Concomitantly, there was 20-fold accumulation of the APAP-CLU in the liver of Mrp3-l-compared to wild types (20.5 2 4.0% vs. 1.0 0.1% of dose respectively). In addition, the plasma APAP-GLU content was more than ten-fold lower in Mrp3-l-mice compared to wild types (5.8 2 3.2% vs. 0.5 & 0.8%) suggesting a strong decrease in basolateral secretion of the glucuronide. In line with these data we found a strong decrease of APAP-GLU content in the perfusate of perfused Mrp3-l-livers compared to wild types. Conclusion: These data demonstrate that the basolateral excretion of APAP-GLU is nearly completely dependent on the presence of Mrp3. We hypothesize that the affinity of murine Mrp3 for APAP-GLU is much higher than for Mrp2, but that in the absence of Mrp3 there is sufficient accumulation in the liver to redirect the APA-GLU to bile via low-affinity transport through Mrp2. Conversely, the main metabolite, APAP-GSH is entirely excreted into bile via Mrp2.

            "text": "Background: The mechanism for acetaminophen (APAP) hepatotoxicity is believed due to the covalent binding of its toxic metabolite, N-acetyl-p-benzoquinoneimine (NAPQI) and/or glutathione (GSH) depletion; however a complete mechanism is not fully known. Previous experiments from our laboratory in cultured mouse hepatocytes demonstrated that GSH depletion using various agents, including APAP, caused sustained JNK activation and a specific JNK inhibitor (SP600125) protected against APAP induced necrosis without altering GSH depletion (Hepatology 2003; 379425-34) . JNK is a member of mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs) which upon activation has been shown to participate in cell death upstream of mitochondria. Objectives: To determine if JNK inhibitor protects against APAP hepatotoxicity in vivo. Methods: C57 BLl6 mice were used for the experiments. They were fasted overnight prior to treatments. 20 mglkg JNK inhibitor (SP600125) or p38 kinase inhibitor (SB202190) was injected intraperitoneally 1 hour prior to 800 mglkg APAP intraperitoneal injection. Blood was obtained at 24 and 48 hours after treatment for ALT measurement. Livers were harvested for histology and GSH measurement. Phospho-JNK was measured by Western blotting of liver extracts. Results: APAP treatment lead to increased phospho-JNK, reflecting activation in 1 hour. Pre-treatment with JNK inhibitor significantly inhibited phospho-JNK formation and reduced ALT elevation caused by APAP at both 24 and 48 hours. Mean ALT after APAP treatment without JNK inhibitor (group I) was 4481.2 2 982.2 and 2233.5 5 1887.0 at 24 and 48 hours respectively. Mean ALT after APAP treatment with JNK inhibitor pre-treatment (group 2) was 122 -C 53.3 and 144.4 2 60.2 at 24 and 48 hours respectively. Mortality rate was 28.6% at 24 hours for group 1 and 0% for group 2. Histology also demonstrated severe centrilobular AASLD ABSTRACTS 277A necrosis in group 1 and almost no necrosis in group 2. There was a 92.0% f 3.5% depletion of hepatic GSH at 2 hours after APAP compared to control in group 1 and 84.6% 2 63% depletion in group 2 (~'0.2, not significant). In contrast to these results, p38 inhibitor (20 mglkg) pre-treatment did not reduce ALT elevation caused by APAP. Mean ALT after APAP'treatment with p38 inhibitor pre-treatment was 3485.5 ? 279.4 at 24 hours and 2858 2 548.1 at 48 hours. The mortality rate in this group was 33.3%. Conclusions: JNK was rapidly activated in association with APAP induced GSH depletion in vivo. Inhibition of JNK markedly protects against APAP hepatotoxicity while inhibition of p38 does not protect. The protection by JNK inhibitor,is not due to alteration of GSH depletion (APAP bioactivation). These findings suggest that activation of JNK makes a major contribution to APAP hepatotoxicity independent of APAP biotransformation and offers promise for a novel treatment strategy.",

Total liver collagen content (hydroxyproline assay) was similar in M E -Iand control animals. Histological analysis revealed slightly less accumulation of extracellular matrix components in MIF -Imice, however morphometric analysis of Sirius Red staining did not confirm these observations. Additionally, there was no significant difference in serum liver enzymes (ALT and AST) between MIF -Iand control mice. Despite reports suggesting that MIF may be involved in various liver diseases, these results suggest that MIF, a proinflammatory cytokine involved in many inflammatory processes, is not critical to the development of hepatic fibrosis. However, h4lF may be involved in other hepatic inflammatory pathways. of cases and are therefore in linkage dysequilibrium. In 80%, all three SNPs occurred simultaneously. The distribution in the HCC group was not significantly altered. These data are in contrast to recently published results in healthy Japanese individuals. Glucuronidation activity of UGTlA3'2 (WllR) and UGTlA3'3 (WllRIV47A) enzymes towards 2-hydroxyestrone was distinctly lower than wild type activity (34% and 56% of wild type, respectively). Additionally, an association of UGTlA3 WllR with the UGTlA7 WO8R polymorphisms and a promoter variant was found in up to 85% of cases. Conclusions: Our data demonstrate evolutionary differences of the frequency of UGTlA3 gene SNPs in Caucasians .and Japanese patients. The hepatic UGTlA3 variants impact the hepatic glucuronidation of 2-hydroxyestrone leading to reduced catalytic activity. Their association with UGTlA7 variants expressed in extrahepatic tissues links reduced hepatic steroid metabolism to extrahepatic xenobiotic metabolism and provides the genetic basis for interindividual changes in drug metabolisms in different compartments. Human drug glucuronidation is therefore characterized by a complex pattern of individual variants.

PatimtslMethods: Cellular immune responses were studied in 50 patients with occult HCV infection (serum anti-HCV and HCV RNA-negativelliver HCV RNA-positive and abnormal ALT andlor GGTP values) and were compared to those of 141 patients with chronic hepatitb C (serum anti-HCV and HCV RNA-positive) and 21 with cryptogenic liver disease (serum anti-HCV and HCV RNA-negativelliver HCV RNA-negative but abnormal ALT andlor GGTP values). Peripheral blood mononuclear cells were isolated and tested for HCV-specific proliferation using recombinant HCV core, NS3, NS4, NS5A and NS5B proteins. In addition, T-cells were expanded in vitro and HCV-specific effector function of T-cells were assessed by flow cytometry-based IFN-gamma secretion analysis. CD8+ T-cells were analyzed by HCV tetramerstaining in HLA-A2+ subjects. Results: Twenty-six out of 50 patients with occult HCV infection had a positive proliferative T-cell response. HCV-specific T-cell responses were significantly more frequent in patients with occult HCV infection (52%) than in the group of chronic hepatitis C (37l141, 26.2%; P = 0.0016, chi-square test) or in subjects with cryptagenic liver disease (1121, 4.8%) (P < 0.001, chi-square test).",

One of the best characterized apoptotic pathway is that mediated by the death receptor Fas. Fas expression has been found to be upregulated on hepatocytes in chronic hepatitis C, particularly in periportal areas. Recently, two polymorphism have been identified in the promotor region of FAS gene, -1377G-A and -67OA>G. We have evaluated the involvement of those variants in the susceptibility to HCV infection and the severity of liver damage in chronic hepatitis C. A cohort of 197 patients with chronic hepatitis C and 100 controls were d y s e d for both polymorphism by Fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) using specific probes and the LightcyclerTM system (Roche Diagnostics). On the other hand, liver biopsies were taken in 167 patients and were classified according to Knodell HAI. We have found that the allele hquenaes and the distribution of both polymorphisms do not di6Fer significantly in the HCV cohort and in the m n h l population. Thus, none of the polymorphisms seems to be related with susceptibility to HCV infection.

We addressed this issue in 3,068 patients with chronic hepatitis C (HIV-IHBsAg-) from 10 centers in 5 countries (Italy, France, Australia, United States and Switzerland) by means of univariate and multivariate logistic regression analysis. Since the center was entered into the model, we identified only variables associated with steatosis andlor fibrosis independently of the participating institution. Steatosis was scored as absentlminimal (4% of hepatocytes), mild (up to 33%), moderate (33-66%) or severe (>66%). Fibrosis and inflammation were scored based on a simplified Metavir scoring system. There were 1,999 males (65.2%); mean age was 44.7 t 11.2, and mean BMI was 25.4 2 3.9. Steatosis was present in 1,561 patients (50.9%) and fibrosis in 2,688 (87.6%).

Although association does not prove causality, this analysis, the largest ever carried out in chronic hepatitis C patients, and the most diverse in terms of geographic and ethnic origin, confirms that 1) presence of liver steatosis is associated with presence of liver fibrosis; 2) age and liver inflammatory activity are two factors associated with both steatosis and fibrosis; 3) infection with HCV genotype 2 may be associated with reduced risk of fibrosis.

Upon complement fixation, the monoclonal antibodies activate opsonization of the immune complexes by neutrophils and macrophages, suggesting that the mechanism of viral clearance includes endocytosis. The ability to prevent HCV infection of liver cells was demonstrated in vitro in a cell-based system for HCV infection. In this system, human hepatoma cell lines are infected with HCV from infected patients. Viral replication is demonstrated by the appearance of (+) and (-) strand HCV-RNA in the infected cells. Adding human monoclonal antibodies to the infectious sera prevents infection of the cell lines. In vivo, both monoclonal antibodies were capable of inhibiting HCV infection of human liver fragments in the HCV Trimeram model as measured by reductions in the mean viral load and in the percentage of HCV-RNA positive mice (nan et al., Journal of Infectious Diseases (2002) 185:153-161 The antiviral action of interferon targets the 5' UTR, which is highly conserved among different HCV genotype, but half of chronic hepatitis C patients do not respond. The virus utilizes these sequences to translate protein by an internal ribosome entry site mechanism (IRES). Development of molecular based therapies that can inhibit IRES function should circumvent the problem related to interferon resistance. We propose that siRNA targeted to the 5' UTR should effectively degrade HCV IRES mRNA and prevent translation of viral protein. Aim: To develop siRNA targets in the 5' UTR and compare their ability to inhibit IRES mediated translation of six major HCV genotypes. Methods: Four different siRNAs targeting the stem-loop 11-111 of HCV 5' UTR was prepared. Intracellular production of siRNA in hepatic cells was achieved using the pSuper-retro vector. As a control plasmid clone expressing siRNA against Epstein-Barr virus nuclear antigen (EBNAI) was used. The effect of siRNA production on IRES mediated translation was investigated using chimeric clones between green fluorescence protein (GFP) and IRES sequences of six different HCV genotypes. Results: The siRNA-73 targeted to stemloop I1 effectively degraded HCV-IRES mRNA and inhibited GFP expression in case of six different HCV genotype clones. Efficient production of siRNA-73 into Huh-7 cells inhibited core protein production from three different full-length infectious clones (pCV-HTC (HCVla), pCV-J4L6S (HCVlb) and pM09.6-T7 (HCV-BK). Intracellular production of siRNAs (174,207 and 245) targeted to stem-loop III of 5'UTR were not very effective and failed to induce RNAi against all HCV IRES clones. Control siRNA (EBNA1) did not inhibit HCV IRES-GFP expression. Conclusions: These invitro studies suggest that siRNA targeted to stem-loop 11 (siRNA73) is highly effective in inducing RNAi against all major HCV genotypes.

            "text": "At the level of the liver acinus, the pathways of ammonia and glutamine metabolism are embedded in a sophisticated structural and functional organization, with considerable impact for the understanding of the liver in ammonia and pH homeostasis. Glutamine synthetase (GS) in liver is restricted to a small perivenous hepatocyte population and plays an important role in the scavenging of ammonia, which escaped the periportal urea-synthesizing comparhnent. Defective ammonia scavenging in liver disease contributes to the development of hyperammonemia. Here, the effect of a single intraperitoneal injection of lipopolysaccharide (LPS) in vivo on glutamine synthesis in rat liver was examined. LPS injection induced expression of iNOS, which was maximal after 6-12h, but returned towards control levels within 24h. At this time point (24h after LPS injection), an about 6-fold increase in tyrosine-nitrated proteins in liver was found and CS protein expression was decreased by about 20%, whereas GS activity was lowered by 40 -50\u00b0/0. GS was found to be tyrosine-nitrated in response to LPS and immunodepletion of tyrosine-nitrated proteins decreased GS protein by about SO%, but had no effect on GS activity. This finding suggests that tyrosine-nitrated GS is enzymatically inactive. In line with this, glutamine synthesis from ammonia (0.3 mmolll) in perfused livers from 24-hours-LPS treated rats was decreased by about 50%, whereas urea synthesis was not significantly affected. The data suggest that LPS impairs hepatic ammonia detoxication by both, downregulation of GS and its inactivation due to tyrosine nitration. The resulting defect of perivenous scavenger cell function with regard to ammonia elimination may contribute to the sepsis-induced development of hyperammonemia in cirrhotic patients. Background: Dietary factors promote obesity and obesity-related disorders, such as fatty liver disease. Natural killer T (NKT) cells are components of the innate immune system that regulate local pro-inflammatory (Th-1) and anti-inflammatory (Th-2) cytokine production by other mononuclear cells. Previously, we noted that NKT cells are selectively reduced in the fatty livers of obese, leptin-deficient oblob mice, and demonstrated that this promotes pro-inflammatory polarization of hepatic cytokine production, exacerbating LPS-liver injury in these animals. We now hypothesize that hepatic NKT cells will also be depleted by diets that induce obesity and fatty livers in wild type mice, promoting Th-1 polarization of hepatic cytokine production and sensitization to LPSliver injury despite persistent leptin. Methods: Adult male C57BL6 mice were fed diets containing either high amounts of fat (50% kcal) or sucrose (48% kcal), or combined high fat, high sucrose (35% of kcal of fat, 40% of kcal of sucrose). Controls received an isocaloric volume of similar diet that contains less fat (11% kcal) and sucrose (12% kcal). Fluorescent antibody cell sorted (FACS) analysis was used to determine the effects of diet on the composition of the hepatic mononuclear cells (MNC) population, as well as to assess MNC apoptosis and intracellular cytokine production. Whole liver cytokine expression was also evaluated by ribonuclease protection assays. Results: As expected, high fat and high sucrose diets induce obesity and fatty livers. Mice fed these diets gain more weight (32% vs 4%, p<0.05), and also develop increased hepatic NKT cell apoptosis (p<O.OOl vs. control). Both high fat and high sucrose diet reduce liver NKT cells (by 26%, p<0.05 and 35%, p<O.Ol, respectively). The combined high fat, high sucrose diet further reduces hepatic NKT cells (by 61%, p<O.OOl). Compared to hepatic T and NK cells from control mice, T and NK cells from high fat, high sucrose fed mice produce 150-2M)% more Th-1 cytokines, such as IFNy and TNFa (both p<O.OOl vs control). Hepatic production of IL-12, a cytokine that inhibits NKT cell viability, is also increased about 2 fold by high fat diets (p<O.Ol vs. control). Mice fed high fat diets also exhibit more liver injury, reflected by 2-fold greater serum ALT level after receiving same dose of LPS as control animals (pc0.05 vs. control). Conclusions: When otherwise normal mice are fed with high fat or sucrose diet, they become obese, develop fatty livers and acquire hepatic innate immune system abnormalities, including increased NKT cell apoptosis. The latter reduces liver NKT cell populations and promotes excessive hepatic production of Th-1 cytokines that promote hepatic inflammation. These diet-induced alterations in the hepatic innate immune system may contribute to obesity-related liver disease. ",

            "text": "and animals were sacrificed to examine liver histology using light and electron microscopic techniques. Results: 1) HBV infection: 20 days after intraperitoneal (ip) injection of HBV in human liver-uPA+'+-SCID mice, their plasma contained HBV DNA (up to copieslml) and high levels of HBsAg (1130 SIN) and HBeAg (663 SlCo). Immunohistochemical analysis of liver tissue obtained 25 days after infection showed a strong nuclear and moderate cytoplasmatic HBcAg staining in most human hepatocytes. HBsAg was visible in the cytoplasm only, with an accentuation near the cell membrane. ultrastructural analysis (EM) revealed the presence of nuclear non-enveloped core partides and Dane particles as well as spherical and cylindrical HBsAg structures in the endoplasmatic reticulum. 2) HCV infection: 2 weeks after ip injection of HCV, the plasma of infected animals contained 2.35~106 IUlml HCV RNA and this level rose to 8x10' IUlml by week 10. A few pl of plasma from these mice (containing 105 IU HCV RNA) was able to infect new human liver-uPA+'+-SCID mice and a similar massive increase of viral load followed. A strong and granular immunohistochemical staining with anti-E2 antibodies showed that almost all human hepatocytes were infected with HCV. No viral particles or tubular structures could be revealed by EM. 3) No virological or morphological signs of HBV or HCV infections were found in infected, non-transplanted SCID mice. Conclusions: Human hepatocytes repopulating uPA+'+-SCID mice can be infected with HBV and HCV. A small animal model is now available to further study different aspects of HBV and HCV infections and to evaluate the in vivo effectiveness of new compounds and strategies to treat these infections. Amantadine, glycyrrhizin, ribavirin and interferon (1FN)-alpha have previously been shown to effectively suppress HAV infection i n vitro or in uivo. However, little is known about how amantadine and other drugs actually work against liver disease. The effect of 6 drugs (amantadine, glycyrrhizin, ribavirin, ursodeoxycholic acid, alcohol, and IFN-alpha) on HAV RNA translation from the HAV internal ribosomal entry site (IRES) was investigated. Methods: We made a bicistronic reporter containing HAV IRES (derived from plasmid-HM175 HAV clone, kindly provided by Prof. S. U. Emerson, NIH, Bethesda, MD). The resulting constructs, termed pSV4O-HAV-IRES and pT7-HAV-IRES, contain a SV40 and a T7 promoter, respectively, that control the expression of a bicistronic message coding for the renilla and firefly luciferases separated by 5\"TR of HAV. Huh-7, C13-3 [Huh-7 cells containing HCV replicon TWA; plasmid pHCVreplbBB7, kindly provided by Prof. Charles M. Rice (Rockefeller University, NY), was used.] or Huh-T7 cells were transfected with 0.4 pg of pSV40-HAV-IRES or pT7-HAV-IRES. 6 h after transfection, cells were washed and culture media with or without the drugs above were added. Luciferase activity was determined 48 h after transfection. Results: Luciferase activities of cap-dependent and HAV IRESdependent translation were 1,000 +/-74 and 63,000 +/-3,100, respectively, in Huh7; 1,100 +I-240 and 32,000 +I-940, respectively, in C13-3; and 3,000 +I-200 and 120,000 + I -14,000, respectively, in Huhl7. Amantadine (50 pglml), glycyrrhizin (100 pglml), ribavirin (10 pglml), ursodeoxycholic acid (10 pglml), alcohol (100 pM), and IFN-alpha (100 Ulml) inhibited HAV RNA translation to 67%, 75%, 92%, 114%, 88% and 53%, respectively. IRES/ cap-dependent translation ratios were 1.0,0.6,0.39 and 0.12 at 0, 10, 50 and 100 pglml, respectively, of amantadine in Huh-7 and they were 1.0, 0.73, 0.55 at 0, 100, 1000 Ulml, respectively, of IFN-alpha. Similar results were obtained with Huh-T7 cells. In C13-3 cells, amantadine more specifically suppressed HAV IRESdependent translation than IFN-alpha. Conclusion: Amantadine and IFN-alpha dose-dependently and more specifically suppressed HAV IRES-dependent translation than cap-dependent translation. Moreover, amantadine suppressed HAV IRES-dependent translation in Huh7 cells containing HCV replicon RNA, in which the IFN signal pathway was thought to be impaired. These results indicate a novel antiviral effect of amantadine against HAV with or without HCV infection. HDV requires the envelope proteins (HBsAg) of HBV for assembly and for subsequent rounds of infection. Lamivudine (LMV) is currently used for the treatment of HBV infections and is also used in patients co-infected with HDV. Prolonged therapy with LMV results in the selection of mutations in the HBV polymerase at rtM204IIV which are associated with concomitant changes in the overlapping envelope gene at positions sI195M or sWl%L/Sl stop. The aim of this study was to investigate the affect of mutant HBsAg proteins encoded by LMV-resistant HBV variants on HDV secretion. Methods: The LMV resistance mutations were introduced into the HBsAg cDNA by site directed mutagenesis. Plasmids (pCI) that express modified HBsAg proteins and a pSVL-construct encoding for a replication-competent HDV were co-transfeded into HUH-7 cells. HBsAg was measured using the chemiluminescence Abbott Prism HBsAg assay. HDV replicative RNA-intermediates and the presence of secreted HDV particles were analysed by Northern blot. The presence of the HDV-specific delta antigen in the cell culture supernatant was assayed by immunoblot. Results: Northern analysis of HDV-specific RNA in the supernatant versus the cell lysate demonstrated that the HBsAg with the mutation sI195M (rtM204V) was able to support HDV secretion. In contrast the HBsAg mutants sW196S (rtM204I) or sW196L (rtM204I) did not efficiently support HDV secretion. In addition, there was a comparable decrease in the amount of the deltaantigen in the presence of the HBsAg mutants with sW196SlL amino acid exchanges. Conclusion: An understanding how newly selected antiviral resistant mutants alter viral interactions is important for the treatment of patients co-infected with HBV and HDV. Clinically relevant HBV mutants selected during antiviral therapy have a differential profile to support HDV secretion, in particular the data confirmed that amino acid position HBsAg 196 is critical for HDV secretion and hence, may indirectly abrogate an underlying HDV infection. The HBsAg mutation at amino acid s1195M was shown to have a minimal effect of HDV packaging and release. Differential support for HDV secretion may have consequences for clinical prognosis as co-infected patients are treated with antiviral agents. Nuclear factor kappaB (NFKB) is one of the key signaling intermediates that is known to regulate multiple cellular pathways that control cell survival and death depending on the stimuli. Viralinduced host cell apoptosis is known to be dependent on NFKB activation. Here we report a novel mechanism of NFKB inhibition mediated by the ORF2 protein of HEV. Human hepatoma cell line (Huh7) and heterogeneously expressed ORF2 protein were used in these studies. Inhibition was found to be tumor-promoting phorbol ester, 12-0-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate (TPA) resistant and unaffected when ORFZ was coexpressed along with a constitutively active mutant of the catalytic subunit of the IKK complex (IKKP). Data obtained shows that ORF2 stabilizes the level of total as well as phosphorylated I K B~, inhibits the assembly of SKP1-Cull-beta-TrCP complex and decreases the formation of ubiquitinated IkappaBalpha (IKBa). Further, ORF2 protein was found to directly interact with full-length beta-TrCP, thus interfering with the ubiquitination machinery. We have further conducted molecular trafficking studies on the ORF2 glycoprotein and its interaction with cytoplasmic beta-TrCP. Experimentally we have shown that the ORF2 protein undergoes cotranslational translocation into the Endoplasmic reticulum (ER) where it induces ER stress followed by an unfolded protein response (UPR) and gets retrotranslocated from the ER into the cytosol. Our hypothesis is confirmed by glycosylation, glucosidase and mannosidase I inhibitors, which systematically blocked dislocation as well as NFKB inhibitory activities of fulllength ORF2. We also proved our point using a glycosylation mutant form of ORF2 which was unable to dislocate and inhibit NFKB activity whereas a glycosylation mutant form of ORF2 deleted of its signal sequence could effectively block NFKB activity despite the presence of inhibitors, thus confirming our initial observations that NFKB inhibitory activity of ORF2 was coupled to its ability to dislocate. This is the first report demonstrating a viral protein exploiting the ER retrotranslocation machinery to inhibit the NFKB activity. The biological significance of the major capsid protein ORF2 in downregulating NFKB activity may have possible roles in viral pathogenesis thus providing an immunosuppressed microenvironment. Background and Aims: The lack of a small animal model of HBV infection hampers the elucidation of pathophysiological mechanisms of this disease. Although transgenic mice which contain HBV DNA produce virus, this production is derived from integrated viral transcription template which is clearly different from the natural infection. We injected a plasmid encoding HBV DNA into nude mice to establish an episomal HBV replication system. The injection led to high levels of HBV replication in the murine liver for over 1 year. Of note is that the transfected liver dearly produced HBV covalently closed circular (CCC) DNA, which appeared to be required for long-term production of HBV in this system. Materials and Methods: pHBV1.5 plasmid contains 1.5fold-overlength recombinant HBV DNA. A plasmid containing mutant HBV DNA carrying stop codon instead of 54Trp of the pol gene was generated from pHBV1.5 and verified by sequencing. Wild-type or mutated pHBV1.5 was injected into adult nude mice through the tail vein with acute circulatory overload. Expression of HBV was examined by Northern blot, immunohistochemistry and CLIA-based detection of serum HBsAg. To examine the levels of virus-associated HBV DNA, serum were treated with DNaseI and then subjected to real-time PCR analysis. PCR detection of CCC DNA was performed according to the procedure of Jun-Bin et al. with some modification. Results: Tail vein injection of pHBV1.5 resulted in expression of the 2.1 kb and 3.5 kb viral transcripts exclusively in the liver and expression of HBc in around 3% of the hepatocytes at 3 days; the expression persisted over 1 year in all mice injected. HBV was secreted into the blood, evidenced by the presence of DNase I-resistant HBV sequence. The density of the positive fraction for HBV DNA was determined 1.21 g/ml. The titers of the virus produced into the circulation are around lo7 copies per milliliter at 3 days after the injection and gradually decreased 2 log throughout the observation. Of note is the finding that CCC DNA, the template of viral replication in natural infection, was produced in the livers and critically involved in the long term HBV production, because disruption of the pol gene of the inoculated DNA resulted in transient expression of both HBs and HBc antigens. Conclusions: Hydrodynamicsbased transfection of HBV DNA in nude mice provides us a long term HBV DNA replication system in vivo. HBV expression and production is generated at lest in part form CCC DNA, which recapitulates human infection. Intentional mutation could be easily introduced in inoculated DNA and mice with various different genetic background could be used; so, this model could provide unique opportunity to investigate HBV biology as well as anti-HBV therapy. Background: Elevation of alanine aminotransferase (ALT) level is commonly seen among patients suffering from severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS). We report the progression and clinical significance of liver derangement in a large cohort of SARS patient. Patients and Methods: Serial assay of serum ALT was followed in patients fulfilled the WHO criteria of SARS. Those with elevated ALT were compared with those with normal liver functions for clinical outcome. Serology for hepatitis B virus infection was checked. Adverse outcomes were defined as oxygen desaturation, need of intensive care unit care and mechanical ventilation and death. Post-mortem examination and viral isolation from liver tissue were performed in selected cases. Results: Two hundred and ninety-four patients were included in this study. Seventy (24%) patients had elevated serum ALT on admission and 204 (69%) patients had elevated ALT during the subsequent course of illness. Majority of patients had ALT levels elevated at day 5-7 from fever onset and ALT peaked at the end of second week. The area under the receiver operator characteristic curve of peak ALT for oxygen desaturation, need of ICU care, mechanical ventilation and mortality were 0.70 (%Oh CI 0.64-0.75; p<O.OOl) and 0.65 (95% CI 0.54-0.76, p=O.O11), respectively. Twenty-eight (9.5%) patients had ALT raised to over 5 times ULN.",

Chronic hepatitis B (n=30) was not associated with worse clinical outcomes. There was no evidence of SARS-coronavirus induced hepatitis found on post-mortem examination. Mitochondria are essential organelles for normal liver function. However, how mitochondrial shape and number are controlled is not fully understood. Over the past five years, research in mitochondrial morphology has advanced rapidly, mainly due to the identification of protein factors involved in mitochondrial fission and fusion. The pathological relevance of these processes becomes clear, as apoptotic cell death evidently involves mitochondrial fission and fusion machinery. Mitochondrial fission is a highly regulated process mediated by a defined set of protein factors. In mammalian hepatocytes, at least two proteins, DLPl, a member of the dynamin family of large GTPases, and the mitochondrial outer membrane protein, hFisl, are required for fission of mitochondria. The cytosolic domain of hFisl contains six 0-helices (01 -a6) that form two tetratricopeptide repeat (TPR) motifs, implicating this region in protein-protein interactions. We previously reported that the overexpression of hFisl induced DLPl-mediated fragmentation of mitochondria in a liver cell line, suggesting that it recruits cytosolic DLPl during mitochondrial fission. In the present study, we further investigated the role of hFisl during mikhondrial fission using truncated and mutated forms of hFisl in cultured hepatocytes. We found the extreme N-terminal region of Wil ( a l ) is required for mitochondrial fission, but that this region is not the site of DLPl interaction. Surprisingly, truncation of this region of hFisl enhanced DLPl interaction with hFisl, indicating that the d-helix of hFisl is a negative factor of DLPl binding. Instead, we found evidence that DLPl interacts with the fourth and fifth helices of hFisl that form the second TPR motif lying adjacent to the outer membrane of mitochondria. These results suggest that the N-terminal region of hFkl plays a role as a negative regulator for DLPl binding at the downstream site. Supporting the hypothesis that the 01-helix of Wil destabilizes the DLPl binding the N-terminal cytosolic domain of hFisl was able to restore mitochondrial fragmentation in cells expressing N-terminally truncated hFisl. These results indicate that the N-temrinal d-helix of hFisl functions as a fission effector domain by regulating the interaction between its second TPR motif and DLPl.

            "text": "Our long-term goal is to understand how hepatocytes establish and maintain their polarity. Our focus is to identify molecules that regulate delivery of newly synthesized apical plasma membrane (PM) proteins to the apical surface. Unlike most simple epithelial cells that directly target proteins from the TGN to the apical PM, hepatocytes use the indirect pathway. Newly synthesized proteins are delivered from the TGN to the basolateral domain where they are retrieved by endocytosis and transcytosed to the apical surface. Work from others and from our lab has shown that direct and indirect apical delivery is dependent on cholesterol and glycosphingolipids. Because MALl and MAL2 have been identified as important regulators of direct and indirect apical PM delivery, respectively, and because they reside in cholesterol and glycosphingolipid-rich domains, they are likely candidates for mediating lipid-dependent apical sorting. Interestingly, hepatocytes lack endogenous MALl expression consistent with the absence of direct apical targeting. Does MALl overexpression reroute apical residents into the direct pathway in hepatic cells? Consistent with previous studies, a subpopulation of overexpressed MAL-1 distributed to detergent resistant membranes in WIF-B cells, but these did not contain known raft markers. Morphologically, MALl was observed mainly at the apical PM and in intracellular puncta. Although these structures contained no known organelle markers, newly synthesized glycophosphatidylinositol-anchored and single spanning apical residents accumulated in these MAL1-posi-tive puncta. The distributions of multi-spanning membrane proteins, basolateral residents and polymeric immunoglobulin A receptor were not affected by MALl overexpression. Because the compartment containing the accumulated apical proteins was resistant to disruption by brefeldin A and only the mature forms of proteins were detected, we conclude the compartment is a post-Golgi structure. However, cycloheximide treatment led to decreased staining of the puncta indicating it is a biosynthetic intermediate. Surface labeling of the apical residents revealed decreased basolateral delivery indicating decreased transcytosis. Together, these results indicate that overexpressed MALl partially reroutes a subset of apical proteins into the direct pathway in polarized hepatocytes. Background: Our laboratory has developed methods for quantifying endocytic processing in living hepatocytes using high resolution, muti-channel fluorescence microscopy by employing fluorescent-labeled ASialoORosomucoid (ASOR) as a model ligand. These assays complement extensive studies we have published on microtubule-based endocytic processing and motility in vitro. Proper endocec processing is critical in various aspects of hepatocyte metabolism as well as for infection by pathogens. Methods: Endosome motility was recorded using live-cell confocal and wide-field microscopy technology at frames rates of at least 1 frame per second with use of 3D deconvolution. Drugs were added at the indicated concentrations after ligand uptake. Fluorescent endosomes were prepared for in vitro assays after intravenous injection of Texas-Red ASOR. Disposable microscope chambers were assembled and coated with fluorescent microtubules. Motility and sorting of microtubule-bound endosomes was initiated with 50 uM ATP. Rab4 green fluorescence protein-labeled mutant and wild type constructs were prepared and used to transfect primary hepatocytes and HuH7 cells. Results: Within 2 min of exposure to ASOR, Hepatocytes and HuH7 cells exhibit fluorescent punctae that traverse the cytoplasm along microtubule tracks. Motility increases up to 10 min after exposure and then decreases, corresponding to a switch from early to late endosomes. During 30-second movies, 134% (+I-14) of the endosomes were motile. Drugs that block endosome acidification reduced motility to 61% (bafilomycin A), 42% (nigericin), 12 Yo (NH4Cl), 14% (monensin). Vesicular fission and fusion were also reduced. In vitro, 38% of vesicles were motile, but effects of the drugs were minimal. Wild type-and GTP (Q67LJ-Rab4 localized to intracellular vesicles that partially overlapped with endocytic ASOR when transfected into hepatocytes or HuH7 cells. GDP (S22N)-Rab4 showed a diffuse localization, and endosomes within transfected cells were capable of microtubule-based motility. Interestingly, wild typeand GTP-Rab4 induced formation of large vesicles that partially overlapped with endocytic ASOR and the acidophilic marker, lysotracker. Conclusions: Blockage of endosome acidification reduces microtubule-based motility by a mechanism that is dependent on cytosolic factors that are absent from purified endosomes. GTP-Rab4 induces the formation of large endocytic organelles. Similar induction of large organelles has been previously observed for both Rab5 and Rab7, and taken together these data suggest a common activity for Rab proteins. ",

This activity of S A M is important for normal liver function, because knockout mice deficient in hepatic SAM display abnormal ' liver regeneration and spontaneously develop hepatocellular carcinoma. How SAM regulates hepatocyte growth is unclear, but since SAM blocks hepatocyte growth factor (HGF)-induced c y a n D1 and D2 expression and DNA synthesis without affecting HGFinduced ERK phosphorylation, the MAPK signaling pathway is probably not the target. Here we show that AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) phosphorylation is increased in mice deficient in hepatic S A M . We also show that HGF and 5-aminoimidazole-4carboxamide riboside (AICAR), the most widely used pharmacological activator of AMPK, induce the phosphorylation and activation of AMPK in hepatocytes, and that high SAM blocks this process. This effect of high S A M on AMPK phosphorylation was prevented by the protein phosphatase inhibitors calyculin A and okadaic acid. We found that, in the presence of both SAM and AICAR, AMPK interacts with PP2A and that calyculin A and okadaic acid blocked this interaction. We also found, that HGFand AICAR-induced AMPK activation stimulated the transport from nucleus to cytoplasm of HuR, a RNA-binding protein that increases the half-life of cell cycle genes such as cyclin A, and that high S A M blocked this process. We further observed that AICAR induced the expression of cyclin A and that high S A M blocked this event. Thus, our results identify a previously unknown mechanism by which hepatocyte respond to HGF as well as how S A M regulates this novel pathway. ",

At present, it is not clear what protein-protein interactions are required to direct these trafficking events. Our previous studies showed that association of potential sorting-proteins with the ASGPR-cytoplasmic domain (CD) was regulated by phosphorylation of the CD by Casein Kinase 2 (CK2). Mass spectrometry and immunoblot analyses identified five of these proteins as the molecular chaperones gp96, HSP70, HSP90, Cyclophilin-A and FKBP. The Aim of the present study was to determine whether any of the adaptor protein complexes ( A n , AP2 or AM), which recognize the ASGPR internalization motif bridging the ASGPR-CD to clathrin, were selectivity associated with this heat shock protein (HSP) complex. Methods and Results: To puriry potential sorting-protein-AP complexes, the ASGPR-CD was expressed as a GST-fusion protein to be used as an affinity-matrix in which its CK2 recognition motif was in the phosphorylated or non-phosphorylated form. Cytosol derived from HUH-7 cells was passed over the matrix and bound proteins eluted in high salt buffer. Isolated proteins resolved by SDS-PAGE were identified by western blot analysis. In addition to the previously identified molecular chaperones, AP2 known to be localized to internalizing or early endosomes, and AM, known to be associated with endosomes recycling to and from the trans-Golgi-network and to plasma membrane, were recovered from the phosphorylated CD matrix. AP3, known to be associated with late endosomes targeted to lysosomes, bound to the phosphorylated and non-phosphorylated CD equally well. AMP, ATP, and the non-hydrolysable ATP analogue AMP-PNP or GTP was added to a crude vesicle fraction prior to co-immunoprecipitation of potential receptor sorting-protein complexes. Unlike most kinases both ATP and GTP can be utilized for CK2 mediated phosphorylation, however, only,ATP markedly increased the amount of APl and AP2 recovered. Disruption of HSP associated with AS-GPR-CD by inhibition of CK2 mediated phosphorylation with tetrabromobenzotriazole, rapamycin treatment, which dissociates the HSP complex from phosphorylated ASGPR-CD thereby altering receptor trafficking, or the addition of anti-HSP70 or HSPSO to the cell lysate prevented AP-ASGPR co-immunoprecipitation. Conclusion: High affinity AF'l and AP2 interaction with the AS-GPR internalization motif requires AP phosphorylation by a kinase other than CK2 and the interaction with the HSP complex mediated by CK2 phosphorylation of the ASGPR-CD. Modulation of the interaction between AF'l and AP2 with the ASGPR-CD HSP complex provides a dynamic regulatory mechanism governing receptor trafficking. The ",

            "text": "Clinic College of Medicine, Rochester, M N Previous work from our laboratory showed that after exposure of rat hepatocytes to a secretory agonist, the hepatocyte plasma membrane becomes permeable to water due to exocytic insertion of aquaporin-8 (AQP8), a water channel protein (J Biol Chem 2002). More recently, we showed that mixed (i.e., apical plus basolateral) hepatocyte plasma membrane fractions contained lipid microdomains (\"rafts\") enriched in cholesterol and sphingolipids (Hepatology 2003). Thus, we proposed the hypothesis that canalicular bile secretion results from the trafficking of vesicles containing functionally related ion, solute and water transporters and channels (i.e., \"flux proteins\") to and from localized lipid microdomains in the hepatocyte membrane. To test this hypothesis further, we isolated lipid microdomains from hepatocyte apical and basolateral plasma membranes and characterized their lipid and protein composition. Methods. We isolated rat hepatocyte couplets and prepared fractions enriched in apical and basolateral membrane vesicles; from these fractions, we further isolated by isopycnic centrifugation detergent-soluble and -insoluble (\"rafts\") fractions. We assayed each fraction for positive (alkaline phosphatase and NalK ATPase) and negative (amino peptidase-N) \"raft\" marker enzymes, and for lipid and protein composition using TLC and immunoblot analysis, respectively. Results. A detergent (Triton)-insoluble band (\"raft fraction\") at the 5/30% sucrose interface in both fractions was enriched for alkaline phosphatase (apical) and NalK ATPase (basolateral), was negative for amino peptidase-N, positive for caveolin-1 (a \"raft\" associated protein) and negative for clathrin (a \"raft\" negative protein). Dot blot analysis using a probe for cholera toxin B (a protein that binds to the \"raft\" associated sphingolipid, GM1) was also enriched in the detergent-insoluble fraction both in the apical and basolateral \"raft\" preparations. As predicted, the Triton-insoluble fraction was highly enriched in cholesterol and sphingolipids. Immunofluorescence staining on freshly isolated hepatocyte couplets for both caveolin-1 and cholera toxin B showed a punctuate distribution on both the apical and basolat-era1 plasma membranes consistent with localized membrane microdomains. Conclusions. These results provide additional evidence for the presence of sphingolipid enriched lipid microdomains on both the apical and basolateral plasma membranes of hepatocytes. The data are consistent with our general hypothesis that these regions may represent target microdomains of both apical and basolateral hepatocyte plasma membranes for exocytic insertion and retrieval of \"flux proteins\" involved in canalicular bile secretion.

Our previous studies using a microscopybased system, indicated that early and late endosomes bind and move bi-directionally along microtubles (MTs) via specific motors and are associated with distinct proteins. In the present study, we devised flow cytometry-based methodology to prepare highly purified fluorescent early and late endosomes, permitting direct biochemical analysis. Methods: Endosomes (pre-sorted) containing fluorescent and unlabeled endosomes were prepared from rat liver 5 min (early) and 15 min (late) after portal venous injection of Alexa-488-ASOR. Unlabeled endosomes were isolated from rat livers without prior injection of ASOR and used as controls. Presorted and control endosomes were assessed for fluorescence on a Modular Flow High-Performance Cell Sorter and their fluorescence intensity was determined. The distribution of control endosomes was used to set the fluorescence threshold that was specific for endosomes that contained Alexa-488 ASOR. In similar experiments, prior to flow cytometry analysis, pre-sort endosomes were labeled with the general membrane marker, Vybrant DiD. Presort and purified fluorescent endosomes were analyzed for DiDmembrane and Alexa-488-ASOR fluorescence to assess colocalization of these two fluors. Endosomes that contained fluorescent ASOR were collected and analyzed for specific proteins by immunoblot. Results: Examination of pre-sort populations of endosomes revealed that DiD labeled a substantial number of endosomes that did not have Alexa-488 signal (-%50%). After sorting based upon Alexa-488 fluorescence, DiD fluorescence colocalized with approximately 99% of Alexa-488 containing vesicles. All proteins examined by immunoblot were in the starting pre-sort endosomes. However, the purified sorted fluorescent early endosomes, were highly associated with ASGPR, Rab4, KIFC2, and KIF5B, while KIF3A, dynactin, dynein and Rab7 were essentially absent. In contrast, purified sorted fluorescent late endosomes were substantially associated with KIFC2, KIF3A, Rab7, dynactin and dynein but not with ASGPR, Rab4 and KIF5B. Conclusions: Highly purified fluorescent endosomes populations can be obtained using flow cytometry, enabling biochemical analysis. Early and late endosomes associate with distinct proteins validating our previous microscopy-based Results. This purification technology can be useful for detailed proteomic analysis of these endosome populations. Pharmacology and Toxicology, Zurich, Swikerland Background: Plasma membranes contain lipid rafts that are biochemically defined by their resistance to solubilization by mild detergents at cold temperature. They can be divided into \"Tritonrafts\", which are insoluble in Triton X-100 and Lubrol WX and \"Lubrol-rafts\", which are soluble in Triton X-100 but insoluble in Lubrol WX. In vivo, the canalicular liver plasma membrane (cLPM) is constantly exposed to bile acid detergents. Hence, the cLPM may contain lipid rafts as protective structures against solubilization by bile acids. Aim: To isolate rafts from purified cLPMs and to analyse them for the presence of established raft marker proteins and canalicular ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporters. Methods: Rafts were isolated from rat cLPM by extraction with either 1% Triton X-100, 1% Lubrol WX, or 8 mM taurocholate (TCA) for 30 minutes on ice and subsequent flotation in sucrose step gradients. 12 fractions were analysed for total protein and alkaline phosphatase (AP), aminopeptidase N (APN) and alkaline phosphodiesterase (APDE) enzyme activities. Additionally, immunoblot analyses were performed for caveolin-1 (cav-1), Mdrl P-glycoprotein (Abcbl), Mrp2 (AbccZ), Abcg5, and the bile salt export pump (Bsep, Abcbll). Results: 5.5% of total cLPM protein was resistant to 1% Triton X-100. The solubility of individual proteins by the three detergents used is summarized in table 1. Conclusions: The cLPM contains lipid rafts. AP resides in \"Tritonrafts\", whereas all other proteins investigated reside in \"Lubrolrafts\". A micellar concentration of TCA has intermediate detergent activity and does not discriminate between \"Lubroland Triton-rafts\". These data suggest that most functional canalicular proteins reside in \"Lubrol-rafts\", indicating that \"Tritonrafts\" play a minor role in hepatic bile formation. cell polarity and epithelial integrity. In Drosophila, loss of function mutations of lgl result in a tumorous transformation of the imaginal discs, with a highly metastatic potential upon transplantation. The relevance of hugl-expression in human tumorigenesis has so far not been investigated.",

            "text": "We evaluated the hugl-1 and hugl-2 transcription in fetal liver, primary hepatocytes and hepatocellular carcinoma cell lines Huh7, Hep3B and HepG2 by RT-PCR. We further established HEK-293 cell lines in which expression of hugl-1 and hugl-2 as fusion protein to GFP or alone is controlled by ecdysone. These cell lines were used for functional tests, such as adhesion and migration assays. Results: While fetal liver, primary hepatocytes obtained from adult patients and hepatocellular carcinoma cell lines Huh7 and Hep3B revealed varying levels of hugl-1 81 -2 transcription, hugl-1 & -2 transcription was lost in HepG2 cells. lmmunfluorescent and live observations of established hugl-l-GFP and hugl-2 clones revealed a cortical localization of hugl-1 &-2 and the GFP fusion protein, which became more pronounced upon cell-cell contact. Upon confluency, hugl expressing cells maintained a flat and contigous cell monolayer with minimal loss of cells to the supernatant, whereby control cultures formed multilayers with increasing loss of cells to the supernatant.Under mechanic stress cell deadhesion was decreased by Soyoin the case of hugl-1 induction and 77% in the case of hugl-2 induction as compared with not induced cells. Interestingly, ecdysone induced hugl expression allowed a long term maintenance of these confluent cultures for over one month without loss of cell viability or the cell monolayer morphology. Hugl-1 induction resulted further in a significant decrease of cell migration in transwell migration chamber assays. Conclusion: Our findings demonstrate that hugl-l&-2 are expressed in fetal liver, human primary hepatocytes and can be lost in hepatocellular carcinoma. Furthermore, hugl proteins significantly increase cell adhesion and reduce cell migration. Further investigations are required in order to determine the biologic and prognostic significance of hugl-1 and -2 expression in human hepatocellular cancer. OC- curring in 4 to 8 minutes. Ring formation was suppressed during incubation in WM and by 3-methyladenine (10 mM), a specific inhibitor of autophagy. After ring formation, mitochondria depolarized after a few more minutes. Initially, rings did not stain with LTR, a marker of acidification. Acidification subsequently occurred after about 3 to 5 minutes, which was sometimes associated with fusion with pre-formed acidic vesicles. After several more minutes, GFP-LC3 fluorescence dispersed but LTR-stained acidic organelles remained. Conclusion: The results indicate that polarized mitochondria are initially sequestered into autophagosomes, followed by mitochondrial depolarization, autophagosomal acidification and fusion with pre-formed lysosomes. MA Liver regeneration has been documented in many mammals including humans. Despite knowledge of the regenerative ability of zebrafish tissues, for example fins and heart, liver regeneration has not been studied in zebrafish. Here we report the successful development of reproducible partial hepatectomy (PH) model for studying liver regeneration in adult zebrafish. Following excision of the ventral liver lobe, we observed proliferation of cells in the cut lobe by staining with antibodies to the proliferative cell nuclear antigen (PCNA). PCNA positive cells were most abundant 48 hours after PH, declining to a nadir by 72 hours. We did not see significant PCNA staining in sham-operated fish. Interestingly we also noticed a slight increase in the number of PCNA positive cells in the uncut lobe of hepatectomized fish, but in none of the lobes of the sham operated animals. By 7 days after the PH, there was gross evidence of regrowth from truncated lobe and histologic analysis confirmed the presence of normal appearing liver cells in the regenerated ventral lobe. In a series of experiments on fish aged 6 months to 3 years we did not see any decline in the regenerative capacity of the liver with advancing age, unlike in mammals. In summary, we have developed a partial hepatectomy model for studies of hepatocyte proliferation in zebrafish. This model will aid our understanding of the regulation of hepatocyte .05 vs saline; n = 6-7lgrp). However, tropisetron did not significantly increase activity in sham rats (saline 827 t 215 vs trop (0.1 mg) 932 2 224 us trop (1.0 mg) 1579 5 372; NS; n = 6-7lgrp). These findings indicate that cholestasis is associated with increased central 5HT3 receptor expression in a brain area implicated in behavioral activation. Moreover, we demonstrate that inhibition of 5HT3 receptor activation improves cholestasis associated fatigue-like behavior in rats. Manipulation of 5HT3 receptor activation may be a therapeutic target to improve fatigue in cholestatic patients. increased prevalence of ClTR mutations as well as decreased CETR function. As proof of concept, we have also shown that induction of colitis with dextran sodium sulfate (DSS) induces bile duct injury in cystic fibrosis (CF) mice. We hypothesized that 1) CFTR dysfunction by reducing PPARa andlor y expression leads to bile duct injury in CF mice, and 2) the mechanism of action of docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) to ameliorate CF pathology is through its effects on increasing PPARa or y expression. Aims: 1) determine if PPARa or y is decreased in the liver of CF mice following DSS, 2) determine whether the protective mechanism of action of DHA is through modulation of PPARa or y, and 3) whether bile duct injury is seen in PPARa knockout mice given colitis. Methods: Heterozygous CF mice were bred and wild type (WT) and CF (UNC exon 10 knockouts) littermates weaned at 21 days to Peptamen. On day 40, mice were fed Peptamen alone (controls) or Peptamen with DSS for 14 days (125 mglday for 5 days and then 85 mglday for 9 days) to induce colitis. Additional mice from these two groups were also given DHA 40 mglday in Peptamen for 14 days. PPARa and y mRNA levels in liver homogenate were determined by RT-PCR, protein expression by western blot (WB), and activity by EMSA. To determine whether a complete absence of PPARa was responsible for the bile duct injury, 5 PPARa knockout mice were treated with 5% DSS in drinking water for 7 days to induce colitis. Results: Both CF and WT control littermates exhibited no difference in PPARa and y by RT-PCR and WB. By EMSA, PPARa activity was decreased in CF control mice by -50% compared with WT littermates. WT mice given DSS showed a 9.5 fold increase in PPARa mRNA (p=0.0004) and an increased nuclear localization by WB, while CF mice exhibited no change in mRNA levels and a lack of translocation from the cytosol to the nucleus. Disruption of the enterohepatic bile acid circulation during biliary tract obstruction leads to profound perturbation of the cholesterol and bile acid metabolic pathways. Several families of nuclear receptor proteins have been shown to modulate this critical process by regulating hepatic cholesterol catabolism and bile acid synthesis through the transcriptional control of cholesterol 7-a hydroxylase (CYP7Al). Hepatocyte Nuclear Factor 6 (HNF-6 or OC-1) is a member of the ONECUT family of transcription factors which activate numerous hepatic target genes essential to liver function. We have previously shown that hepatic expression of mouse HNF-6 mRNA and protein significantly decrease following bile duct ligation. Because CYMAl contains potential HNF-6 binding sites in its promoter region, we tested the hypothesis that HNF-6 transcriptionally regulates CYP7A1. Following bile duct ligation, we demonstrated that diminished HNF-6 mRNA levels correlate with a reduction in CYP7A1 mRNA expression. Increasing hepatic levels of HNF-6 by either infection with recombinant adenovirus vector expressing HNF-6 cDNA or growth hormone treatment leads to an induction of CYP7Al mRNA. To directly evaluate if HNF-6 is a transcriptional activator for CYP7A1, we used deletional and mutational analyses of CYP7A1 promoter sequences and defined sequences -206/-194 to be critical for CYP7A1 transcriptional stimulation by HNF-6 in cotransfection assays. This report demonstrates for the first time that thesHNF-6 protein is a component of the complex network of hepatic transcription factors which regulates the expression of hepatic genes essential for bile acid homeostasis and cholesterolllipid metabolism in normal and pathological conditions. The following authors have indicated they have no relationships to disclose: Ai-Xuan L Holterman, Minhua Wan& Yongjun Tan Pruritus is a common, disabling symptom of unknown etiology associated with cholestasis . Antinociception and pruritus are closely interrelated as activation of pain pathways reduces itch (eg. scratching)and inhibition of pain pathways increases itch. In addition, endogenous opioids play well documented roles in both sensations. Moreover, endogenous opioids have been implicated in the genesis of both cholestatic itch and antinociception and have been presumed to exert their actions within the central nervous system (CNS). However, circulating levels of endogenous opioids are elevated in cholestasis, leading us to hypothesize that these circulating endogenous opioids may contribute to cholestasis associated antinociception. To examine this we used sham and bile duct resected (BDR) mice (male C57BLl6, Jackson Labs) and measured antinociception using 2 validated nociceptive stimuli; mechanical (von Frey microfilament) and thermal paw withdrawal latencies. Withdrawal latencies were recorded at baseline (before surgery) and then daily for days 2 to 7 post-surgery after the subcutaneous administration of saline vehicle, naloxone (10 mgl kg) or naloxone methiodide (10 mglkg; doesn't cross the blood-brainbamer). BDR mice demonstrated significant antinociception using both test paradigms, beginning at day 4 post-surgery and increasing up to day 7. However, cholestasis associated antinociception was reversed completely in the two nociception paradigms by both naloxone and naloxone methiodide administration, indicating that endogenous opioids acting outside the CNS drive cholestasis associated antinociception. To determine whether endogenous opioids act at the level of cutaneous nerve endings or at dorsal root ganglion to induce antinociception, paw thermal withdrawal latency measurements were performed on mice at day 7 post-surgery after the intraplantar microinjection of naloxone methiodide (15 pg in lop1 saline; local effect on cutaneous n m e endings). Local paw injection of low dose naloxone methiodide resulted in a complete reversal of antinociception, in BDR mice, similar to that obtained with systemic naloxone methiodide administration and was without effect in shams. These findings indicate that cholestasis associated antinociception is due mainly to the action of endogenous opioids at cutaneous nerve endings. Given the close association between pain and itch, these findings may have direct implications for cholestasis associated pruritus. Oxidative stress and activation of apoptosis in fetal liver were investigated at term (day 21), whereas hepatobiliary function and the expression levels of some genes involved in it were investigated at 4-wk after birth.",

            "text": "Backmound: The hepatic inflammatory response is associated with altered expression of bile acid transporters and subsequent cholestasis. The putative mechanism underlying inflammationinduced cholestasis is that endotoxins activate the liver macrophages, Kupffer cells, and stimulate the production of proinflammatory cytokines. These, in turn, activate hepatocellular signaling, leading to altered expression of various transporters. The nuclear receptor liver-X-receptor (LXR), which is known to play a central rde in cholesterol and lipid homeostasis, was recently shown to have anti-inflammatory properties in macrophages as well (Joseph et al., Nat Med, 2003) . LXR-activation has proven to be beneficial in models of atherosclerosis and dermatitis. Considering the pivotal role of Kupffer cells in inflammationinduced cholestasis, we hypothesized that activation of LXR with the synthetic agonist, TO901317 (T1317), would reduce the effects of endotoxemia on transporter gene expression in mice. Methods: Mice received T1317 (1-100 mglkglday) or vehicle alone (corn oil) by oral gavage for three days prior to IP-injection with a nonlethal dose of lipopolysaccharide (LPS, 2 pglg BW) or vehicle alone (saline).

At 50 mglkglday, Ntcp suppression was reduced from 83% to 54%, while Mdrlb upregulation was reduced from 541% to 174%. Suppression of bile salt export pump (Bsep) gene expression, however, was not significantly reduced. At 4 hours after injection, expression of the proinflammatory cytokines TNFa, IL-lp, IL-6 and IFNy induced by LPS was not reduced by T1317 nor was the expression of the anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-10. On the other hand, binding activity of NF-KB, an important regulator of Mdrlb expression, was reduced at 8 hours after injection. Summary: T1317 attenuated effects of LPS on Ntcp and Mdrlb expression, but not on expression of Bsep or key cytokines. This was associated with a reduction of LPS-induced NF-KB binding activity. Conclusions: T1317 selectively attenuates LPS-effects on hepatic transporter gene expression, indicating its therapeutic potential as a novel anticholestatic agent in inflammatory conditions. KS Bile-duct ligation (BDL), which is a model of cholestasis, causes bile acids and conjugated bilirubin to accumulate in the liver and blood. Accumulation of bile constituents can cause liver injury, oxidative stress, and inflammation if normal bile flow is not restored. In general, during BDL, the liver upregulates multidrug resistance proteins (Mrps) 3 and 4, which are localized to the basolateral membrane and are thought to aid in the transport of bile acids out of liver into blood. NF-EZrelated factor-2 (Nrf2) is a transcription factor that mediates the induction of genes and is responsive to antioxidants and oxidative stress. Nrf;! is important for regulating the basal and inducible expression of many genes in liver, namely, Nad(p)h:quinone oxidoreductase (Nqol). Because BDL causes oxidative stress and accumulation of bilirubin (an endogenous antioxidant), we hypothesized that BDL 1) activates NrfZ and Nqol expression in liver, 2) Nrf2 activation increases Mrp expression in liver, and 3) increased Mrp expression increases bile acid levels in serum. Wild-type (WT) and Nrf2-null mice underwent sham and BDL surgery, and liver and serum were collected 3 days thereafter. BDL significantly increased mRNA expression of Nqol in livers from wild-type, but not in livers from Nrf2-null mice, suggesting that BDL activates Nrf2 in wild-type mice. In addition, BDL increased mRNA expression of Mrpl, 3, 4, and 5 in livers from wild-type, but not in livers from Nrf2-null mice, suggesting that N f l is important for Mrp induction during cholestasis. Furthermore, BDL also markedly increased the concentration of bile acids in serum from WT mice, whereas the concentration of bile acids was significantly lower in serum from Nrf2-null mice (1681 vs. 297 pmollL), correlating M r p induction and bile acid disposition. Taken together, these data demonstrate that during cholestasis, the transcription factor Nrf2 is activated, and is important for induction of Mrps and bile acid disposition.",

            "text": "Background. LPS (endotoxin) or LPS-induced cytokines have been implicated in the pathogenesis of a variety of liver diseases, including cholestasis. The cholestatic effect of U S is primarily due to cytokine-mediated inhibition of the function and expression of hepatic genes encoding critical proteins involved in bile formation and transport. Pro-inflammatory cytokines, tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-a, interleukin (IL)-lb, and IL-6 are produced mainly by resident hepatic macrophages (Kupffer cells) in response to LPSchallenge. Therefore, counteracting the production of inflammatory mediators by Kupffer cells may provide a new and potent means of attenuating the pathogenesis of inflammation and cholestasis. PPARy (peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor y) agonists inhibit the production of the inflammatory cytokines by activated monocytes. We hypothesize that the PPARy agonist, Rosiglitazone (Rosi) ameliorates LPS-mediated down-regulation of hepatic genes, and can have therapeutic potential in the treatment of cholestasis. Methods: Male C57BLl6 mice were gavage-fed 50 mglkg of Rosi or corn-oil for 3 days. On day 3, the animals were intraperitoneally (IP) injected with 2 mglkg bw of the Salmonella LPS or saline and livers were harvested after 4, 8 and 16 hours. Total RNA was isolated from mouse liver and analyzed by Taq-Man real-time PCR. Binding activities were measured by electrophoretic mobility shift assays. Results: LPS-mediated downregulation of the RNA levels of the bile-acid transporters was reversed by Rosi treatment. Ntcp (sodiumltaurocholate cotransporting polypeptide) suppression was reversed from 85% to 68%, while suppression of Bsep (bile salt export pump) and Mrp3 (multidrug resistance-associated protein 3) was reduced from 50% to 24% and 14% respectively. Interestingly, Rosi had no effect on up-regulation of the liver-expressed cytokines, IL-lp, TNFa, IL-10, IL-6 and IFNy after 4h of LPS treatment, indicating that there might be a cytokine-independent mechanism for the effect of Rosi on LPS-mediated hepatic gene expression. Since the transporter genes are regulated by the retinoid X receptor a (RXRa), we tested the binding activities of RXRa containing heterodimer pairs to canonical DNA sequences. Rosi treatment blocked the LPS-mediated down-regulation of binding activity of the RXRa-containing heterodimers to the canonical DNA elements. LPS-mediated actvation of AP-1 binding activity was reduced by Rosi, whereas, Rosi has no effect on NF-KB binding activity. Summary: Rosiglitazone can ameliorate LPS-mediated down-regulation of hepatic genes involved in bile acid transport. Conclusion: Rosiglitazone can be potentially employed for the treatment of inflammationmediated pathophysiology in acute and chronic liver diseases. Background: Intrahepatic cholestasis after liver transplantation (OLT) is frequently observed, although the mechanism is not understood. The release of inflammatory cytokines such as TNF during acute rejection may be involved since inflammatory cytokines are known to change the expression and activity of hepatobiliary transport systems, leading to a cholestatic phenotype. Hepatobiliairy transport systems mediate hepatic uptake and biliairy excretion of bile salts, organic anions, organic cations, and lipids. In experimental animal studies it has been shown that reduced levels of hepatobiliary transport proteins results in cholestasis. However, nothing is known about alterations in bile salt transporter expression in acute liver rejection in humans.",

Methods: To determine changes in bile salt-and ABC-transporter expression, core needle liver biopsies were studied from: (1) patients who developed an acute liver rejection post transplantation, and (2) patients who had a routine biopsy post transplantation without histological evidence of liver disease. The diagnosis acute rejection was defined as a biopsy proven episode, graded according to the Banff protocol. Indication for liver biopsy was a significant increase in total bilirubin, aspartate aminotransferase, and alanine aminotransferase levels. Immunohistochemistry was used to determine localisation and protein levels of the bile salt export pump (BSEP), phosphatidylcholine translocater MDR3, multidrug resistance transporter MDRl, multidrug resistance associated proteins MRPl, MRPZ and MRP3, and sodium-dependent cotransporting protein (NTCP). Results: Immunohistochemistry was performed on liver biopsies from 11 patients. Canalicular BSEP staining was reduced in livers from patients with high-grade liver rejection compared to the staining observed for patients without signs of liver rejection. MDRl staining was rejection grade dependent increased. In contrast, MRP2 and MDR3 were not changed. Basolateral staining of NTCP was inverse related with the grade of the acute rejection.

Methods: Sixteen women with CLD (9 with primary biliary cirrhosis, 1 with primary sclerosing cholangitis and 6 with chronic hepatitis C) and pruritus were enrolled in the study; age ranged from 42-68 years. Hourly scratching activity (HAS) was continuously recorded for 1 to 2 24 hour periods at baseline and after 4 weeks of treatment in the in-patient setting.

Results: Side effects: hyperbilirubinemia (n=l), consistent with disease progression, and vomiting (n=l). The maximum dose of study drug ranged from 1,200 to 2,400 mg daily. Data from HAS and VAS were available from eleven patients. Eleven t-tests were performed; thus, the two-sided sigxuficance level for each test was 0.05/11 = 0.004 to maintain an overall Type I error level of 0.05. Table.

Asymptomatic hypercholanemia (AH), defined as the presence of total SBA levels above the cutoff value, has been recently described in healthy pregnant women. Aim: to describe clinical and biochemical findings and the outcome of the newborns of patients with ICP and controls. Patients and Methods: 18 patients with ICP, and 28 healthy pregnant women were studied in the third trimester of their pregnancies. Complete medical, obstetrical and perinatal data were recorded. A complete individual profile of SBA, including free and conjugated (taurine and glycine) ursodeoxicholic, cholic, lithocholic (LCA), deoxycholic and chenodeoxycholic acids was performed by capillary electrophoresis. A cut-off value of 10 pM for total SBA was previously determined in healthy non-pregnant women. The control group was divided in normocholanemia and AH. Liver function tests were performed using autoanalyzer. Newborn data were registered weight at birth, Apgar score and gestational age (evaluated by the Capurro method). Results were expressed as mean 2 SD. One-way ANVA with post-hoc tests or non-parametrical tests were used for comparisons. Endotoxin tolerance is characterised by a reduced capacity to respond to endotoxin after an initial exposure. A member of the Interleukin-1 receptor-associated kinase (IRAK) family, IRAK-M is expressed in monocytes and negatively regulates Toll-like receptor signalling. IRAK-M is upregulated in en-dotoxin tolerance. Patients with obstructive jaundice may have low-grade endotoxemia. We aimed to identify the evidences for endotoxin tolerance and the ability of granulocyte monocyte-colony stimulating factor (GM-CSF) to reverse tolerance in these patients.",

In conclusion, the value of SUV ratio provides information for prognostic relevance in patients with HCC before biopsy or surgery.

BackgroundlAims: Telomeric repeat binding factor 1 (TRFI), 2 (TRF2) and TRF1-interacting nuclear protein 2 (TIN2) are involved in telomere length regulation and malignant cells have short but stable telomeres. Recently, there has been increasing evidence concerning human multistep hepatocarcinogenesis emphasizing the preneoplastic nature of the large nodules, which are referred to as dysplastic nodules (DNs) and the shortening of telomeres occurs in the DNs during the early stages of hepatocarcinogenesis. The regulation of these gene expression along with the telomere length was studied in human multistep hepatocarcinogenesis.",

There were 9 normal livers, 14 chronic hepatitis, 24 cirrhosis, 5 large regenerative nodules, 14 low grade DNs, 7 high grade DNs, 10 DNs with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) foci and 31 HCCs. Results: A marked increase in the mRNA levels of TRFI, TRFZ and TIN2 was found in the high grade DNs, DNs with HCC foci and a further increase was observed in HCCs. The TRFl protein expression was also increased according to the progression of multistep hepatocarcinogenesis. The telomere length of DNs and HCCs was inversely correlated with the mRNA levels of TRFl, TRFZ and TIN2 (psO.001). This negative correlation was more evident in the early stages of hepatocarcinogenesis including low grade DNs, high grade DNs and DNs with HCC foci, in which significant telomere shortening occurred. Conclusions: It is suggested that upregulation of TRFI, TRF2, and TIN2 have a negative regulatory influence over the telomere length during the multistep hepatocarcinogenesis, especially the early stages of DNs.

Prognosis assessment in patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) remains controversial since there is no an universal validated model, and although several models have been recently developed, such as Cancer of the Liver Italian Program (CLIP), French classification, or Barcelona Clinic Liver Cancer (BCLC) the most commonly used is the Okuda classification. The model for the End Stage Liver Disease (MELD) is widely used in allocating priorities in patients awaiting liver transplantation but no information is available regarding MELD usefulness in patients with HCC. Aims: To evaluate MELD score in patients with HCC as a prognostic score and its comparison with other classifications: Child-Pugh, CLIP, BCLC, French and Okuda. Patients and Methods: 85 patients (median age 69, range 39-86,73% men) with cirrhosis and HCC diagnosed between November 2000 and September 2003 (follow-up March 2004) were included. According to age, liver status and number and tumour size, several therapeutic strategies were used. Survival was analysed by Kaplan-Meier plots and the log-rank test. Results: Median follow-up was 12 months (range 0.5-39). Median survival was 23.6 months (95%0Ic 20.1-27.1), and the 1-2 and 3 year estimated survival proportion were 70%, 53% y 29, respectively. One patient was lost in the follow-up and 37 died. Nine patients underwent transplantation, 31 percutaneous therapy, 32 chemoembolization, and 25 supportive care. Survival was accurately predicted by all systems (Kaplan-Meier, log rank <0.05 for all the systems). Cumulative survival was significantly different between the three Okuda stages and BCLC stages A to D, but no between CLIP stages. BCLC showed the highest linear trend X2 test (18.61) and MELD the worst (2.35). BCLC resulted better than the other systems (LR X2=32.7, AIC 379.75) and provided the highest independent contribution to a Cox's regression model including all the classifications and removal did significantly reduce the goodness of fit of the model (AIC=391.49, LR X2=32.35). Conclusions: The BCLC staging system provides the best survival prediction in our cohort of patients and is more accurate than Okuda, CLIP and French.

Large and multifocal tumors are prinicipal reasons to exclude patients from liver transplantation (LTx). Patients and Methods: Between 3/98 and 12/04, 76 patients younger than 65 (70) years of age with HCC of any size and number of nodules were treated by repeated transarterial chemoembolization (TACE). Liver transplantation was performed in responding patients. The HCC was confirmed before TACE in 70 of the 76 patients. For embolization lipiodol(20 ml) and mitomycine (10 mg in 20 ml water) were used. Any increase m size and number of nodules was defined as progress. Staging and embolization (mean 5.1 5 3.0 cycles) were repeated every 6 weeks until transplantation. Whole body staging (CT scan andlor scintigraphy) was repeated every 3 months. Results: Of the 76 patients who entered the study 41 responded to treatment (regressive or stable disease). In patients with LTx the 5-year survival was 85 YO, in patients without LTx it was 0% (p=O.O001). One of 38 transplanted patients died with HBV reinfection 9 months after LTx, another one after 50 months with sepsis during hemodialysis. One patient died after 9 months with recurrence, two patients are alive with recurrence. Five-year freedom from recurrence was comparable for patients within (n=13) and beyond (n=25) the Milan criteria: 100 YO versus 85 %, respectively (p=O.255). Recurrences occurred in 3 of those 9 patients who experienced a mild tumor progress after initial response during waiting time despite TACE. Five-year freedom from recurrence for patients with progress-free TACE versus TACE with progress was 100% versus 52% (p=O.OOl). Other potentially prognostic factors (vascular invasion, grading, tumor size, multifocality, AFP) did not influence recurrence. Conclusion: This study demonstrates the possibility of expanding the selection criteria for LTx in HCC patients responding to pretreatment. Recurrence seems to be dependent on the biological behavior of the tumor. TACE may be a tool to distinguish between aggressive and less aggressive tumors. In this respect waiting time may gain a totally new importance. The diagnosis of bile duct cancer remains a challenge since both intraductal brush cytology and biopsy have a low diagnostic yield with sensitivities between 30 and 60%.

HAAH and HoxB7 mRNA levels were measured relative to beta-actin and GAPDH mRNA by quantitative real-time RT-PCR. Results Cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2)-mediated prostaglandin (PG) synthesis has recently been implicated in human cholangiocarcinoma growth, although the mechanisms for this action remain to be further defined. This study was designed to examine the mechanisms by which COX-2-mediated prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) regulates cholangiocarcinoma cell growth and invasion, in vitro. Treatment of human cholangiocarcinoma cells (CCLPI) with PGEz or ONO-DI-004 (selective agonist for PGE2 receptor EP1) significantly increased tumor cell proliferation and invasion, as determined by PH] thymidine incorporation and Matrigel invasion assays (pC0.01). The PGE2-induced cell proliferation and invasion was blocked by the specific siRNA for EPl receptor or selective EPl receptor antagonist ONO-8711 (pC0.01 compared with corresponding control). These findings suggest an important role of EM receptor in COX-2 and PGE2-induced cholangiocarcinoma cell growth and invasion. In addition, overexpression of COX-2 or treatment with PGE2 or EM receptor agonist ONO-DI-004 induced phosphorylation of epidermal growth factor receptor (ECFR) and Akt, which was blocked by the EPl receptor siRNA or antagonist ONO-87ll. The PGE2-induced EGFRlAkt phosphorylation and cell proliferationlinvasion was also blocked by the Src inhibitor PP2 and EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors AG1478 and PD153035. Furthermore, immunohistochemical analysis revealed significantly increased expression of COX-2 as well as EGFR and Akt in human cholangiocarcinoma tissues. These results demonstrate that EPl-receptor transactivates EGFR which subsequently phosphorylates Akt and this signaling pathway mediates COX-2 and PGEZ-induced cholangiocarcinoma growth and invasion. The following authors have indicated they have no relationships to disclose: Chang Han, A Jake Demetris, Tong Wu CD4+CD25+ T-regulatory cells have been demonstrated in several human tumours and probably suppress beneficial tumour-immune responses. We hypothesise that CD4+CD25+ cells infiltrate hepatocellular carcinoma and suppress local T-cell responses and that circulating CD4+CD25+ cells also contribute to the impaired immune responses. Methods: The proportion and phenotype of circulating CD4+CD25+ cells (n=25), tumour-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) (n=12) and tissue lymphocytes from adjacent liver (n=6) were determined using a combination of flow cytometry and immunohistochemistry. Comparison was made with circulating lymphocytes from 48 healthy controls.

However, in patients with multi-focal HCC and a high probability of vascular invasion, the proportion of circulating CD4+CD25+TGFD+ lymphocytes were significantly higher than in healthy controls 55.5% (range 11 -74) and 2.0% ((range 0 -4.9), p=0.003, n=7). CD4+CD25+ Treg cells infiltrating HCC are phenotypically similar to circulating Tregs. Within this population 35% (range 18-65) were TGFP+ . A significant gradient existed between the percentage of CD4+CD25+ Treg cells in HCC and those in adjacent liver tissue (8.7% vs 2.4% respectively, p = 0.014). Tumour-derived CD25+ regulatory cells suppressed autologous CD4+ T-cell (median suppression 65% (range 42-87%)) and CD8+ T-cell responses (53% (range 47-60)). Proliferative responses of circulating lymphocytes from patients with HCC were reduced in comparison to healthy donors, but these could be restored by the depletion of CD25+ cells. In contrast, CD25+ cell depletion was insufficient to restore proliferative responses of TILs. early effector cells (CD27+CD28+CCR7-) and late effector cells (CD27-CD28-CCR7-) with cytotoxic capacity and interferon y production limited to the latter group. We hypothesised that CD8 cells infiltrating HCC would have impaired maturation andlor cytotoxic potential as a result of regulation by CD4+CD25+ T regulatory cells (Tregs). Methods: Phenotype and cytotoxic potential of infiltrating CD8+ T-cells in patients undergoing liver transplantation for HCC were assessed using a combination of flow cytometry (on freshly isolated lymphocytes) and immunohistochemistry (paraffin embed-ded sections). CD25+ T-regulatory cells were freshly isolated from HCC and used in proliferation assays with autologous CD8+ T-cells. IFN y ELISPOT was used to assess peripheral CDE+ T-cell responses to recognised tumour peptides (AFP and MACE) pre and post depletion of CD25+ regulatory cells in HLA-A2+ patients. Results: Infiltrating CD8+ T-cells have a predominantly central memory phenotype (CD27+CD28+CCR7+CD45RO+) with low perforin expression (13% of CD8+ T-cells, range 5-21%). On immunohistochemistry, <5% of CDE+ cells infiltrating HCC expressed intracellular perforin and Granzyme B. In co-culture experiments, HCC-derived Tregs suppressed both proliferation and perforin expression of autologous circulating CD8+ T-cells upon non-specific stimulation. Prior depletion of circulating CD25 + T-cells enhanced CD8+ tumour-specific responses to AFP and MACE peptides. Conclusions: CD8+ T-cells infiltrating HCC have reduced cytotoxic capacity. Tregs within HCC have the capacity to inhibit proliferation and perforin expression in CD8+ T-cells. We suggest that infiltrating CD8+ T-cells in HCC have an impaired capacity for anti-tumour responses. One explanation for this could be suppression by infiltrating CD4+CD25+ cells. Prior Treg depletion may enhance the effects of immunotherapy involving CD8+ cells as effectors. Background: Radiofrequency ablation therapy (RFA) is a new method which can achieve complete coagulation necrosis in small hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) with fewer treatment sessions than percutaneous ethanol injection therapy (PEI), and without critical complications; however, little information regarding the distant recurrence of HCC has been available. The purpose of the present study is to clarify the incidence of, and risk factors for, distant recurrence of HCC after RFA. Methods: We enrolled 131 consecutive patients with small HCC in whom complete tumor necrosis were achieved by initial local ablation therapy (74 by PEI and 57 by RFA) without local recurrence. Twenty-two possible risk factors for distant recurrence were analyzed by means of the multivariate stepwise Cox proportional hazards model. Results: There was no significant difference in cumulative distant recurrence rate between the PEI group and the RFA group (30.3% and 54.2% at one and 2 years, respectively, after PEI, and 15.0% and 43.5%, respectively, after RFA. p=0.4250, log-rank test). Multivariate analysis indicated that the multiplicity of HCC, HCV infection as an etiologic agent of underling liver disease, and habitual smoking were independent risk factors for distant recurrence (p=0.0069, p=0.0271 and p=0.0296, respectively), but the therapeutic modality (PEI or RFA) was not a related factor. Habitual smoking was an independent risk factor for distant recurrence of HCC even in the PEI cases alone (P=0.0487) and in the RFA cases alone (P=0.0456).",

Emiko Mikami, Noriatsu Kunno, Yoshiyuki Uem, Tooru Shimosegawa, Tohoku University, Sendai, Japan BackgroundlAim: Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the most common malignant liver tumor with high recurrent rates. These high recurrent rates are explained by the existence of cirrhotic livers, requiring repeated treatments. Although the majority of HCC patients needs repeated therapy, no data has been available so far about if repeated treatments, especially treatments for tumor-mass reduction, are effective to prolong survival. This lack of data is partly due to the presence of various therapeutic options, which complicate analyses. In this study, we retrospectively analyzed the effectiveness of tumor-mass reduction therapy for prognosis of patients with recurrent HCC. Methods: We analyzed totally 981 patients with recurrent HCC who were admitted to Tohoku University Hospital from December 1989 to January 2004. The method of treatments was designed depending on tumor extension and residual liver function of each individual, with the concept both to obtain the most sufficient locoregional control of tumors and to limit the damage of liver function as little as possible. To analyze the effectiveness of various modalities of therapies with a single criterion, we defined the tumor-mass reduction grade (TMRG) as the following, which was evaluated by dynamic CT or MRI. Grade A no evident HCC lesion is left untreated; Grade B1: more than 50% but not all of lesions is estimated to be treated; B2 less than 50% of lesions of all lesions is estimated to be treated. Subjects were stratified by Child-Pugh classification and assessed according to the number of admission for a series of HCC treatments. Results: In Child-Pugh A, a better survival was obtained depending on the degree of TMRG from first to fifth admission (p<O.OOl), suggesting that patients with Child-Pugh A are benefited from repeated sessions of treatments, without reducing their prognosis. In Child-Pugh 8, on their second admission their survival rates showed difference depending on TMRG (p<O.OOl), although there was no statistical difference on more than third admission. In Child-Pugh C, any mass reduction treatments including even ones on the first admissiondid not bring any benefit for improving survival. Conciusions: Repeated tumor-mass reduction therapies for recurrent HCC are most beneficial in Child-Pugh A patients. In Child-Pugh B patients, just a few occasions of mass reduction therapies may be effective for improving their prognosis. Child-Pugh C subjects should be excluded from any mass reduction therapy. Patients including Child-Pugh B patients who experience several recurrence as well as Child-Pugh C patients may be more benefited from modalities other than any tumor-mass reduction therapies, such as liver transplantation. selection since, in most of them, the two populations were not accurately matched for the known demographic and clinical prognostic factors of HCC. Therefore, to assess whether the viral etiology per se can affect the progression of HCC we performed a multicentric case-control study comparing 110 pairs of cirrhotic patients (MIF: 91/19; median age: 62 years [range: 43-82]), consecutively seen from January 1986 to December 2001, affected by HBV-or HCV-related HCC. Patients were matched for sex, age (within 7 years), center of provenience, tumor stage (according to the Milano criteria), Child-Pugh class, year of HCC diagnosis and, when possible (102 pairs), modality of diagnosis (surveillance, incidental or symptomatic). These parameters and alfa-fetoprotein (AFP) level were also tested as predictors of survival. At entry, 73 patient pairs were in Child-Pugh class A, 30 in B and 7 in C; cancer stage was early in 50 pairs and advanced in 60. AFP levels did not differ between the two groups while HBV patients showed lower ALT levels than the counterpart (P=0.037). or by the combination of clinical, laboratory, and endoscopic signs. The absence of HCC was established by the absence of focalized lesions by imaging techniques and by a AFP level < 10 nglml. Controls included hospital patients without any liver disorder (n=142). All subjects were male, aged less than 75 years, born in Europe of parents born in Europe. The three groups were matched for age and birth country. HCC and cirrhosis patients were supplementary matched for time since cirrhosis diagnosis, in 3 classes (newly detected cirrhosis, cirrhosis diagnosed less than 5 years, cirrhosis diagnosed more than 5 years). Cases and controls were interviewed with a standard questionnaire that included questions about demographic characteristics, subjects' lifetime tobacco use, occupational history. Blood samples were collected on EDTA and a DNA bank was established for all subjects. 39% of the cases were current smokers as compared to 30% among the hospital controls [OR=2.5 (1.2-5.2)]. However the difference was no more significant after adjustment for alcohol consumption [OR=1.4 (0.6-3.2)]. We did not find an excess of smokers among cases (39%) as compared to cirrhosis (40%). Comparable results were obtained using the composite variable pack-years of cigarettes smoking.",

The distribution of GSTs polymorphisms was similar in the three groups. We prospectively identified patients undergoing surveillance with 6 monthly alpha fetoprotein levels and ultrasounds and retrospectively identified patients incidentally diagnosed with hepatocellular carcinoma(HCC) at our hospital in the last ten years. Data was obtained from patient's hospital files. Patient demographics, cause of underlying liver disease, the alpha fetoprotein level and size of the tumour at diagnosis, treatment and survival in the two patient groups were compared. Results: Sixty six patients were diagnosed with hepatocellular carcinoma in the last ten years. Of these patients 12 (18%) were part of a larger ongoing surveillance program and 54 (82%) were diagnosed incidentally. The most common cause of the underlying liver disease in the surveillance group was Hepatitis C (41.6%) and in the incidental group was Hepatitis B (37%) There was no significant difference between the surveillance and incidental groups in regard to mean age at diagnosis (51 years vs. 63 years) although there was a trend towards a significant difference in mean alpha fetoprotein at diagnosis (311 pglL vs. 33,840pglL) (p = 0.07). Tumour s u e at diagnosis was significantly smaller in surveillance versus incidental groups: tumours <5 cm 75% vs. 28 YO; tumours 5-10 cm 8% vs. 52%; tumours > lOcm 17% vs. 20 %. The incidence of multifocal hepatoma was similar between the groups (17% vs. 3225%). HCC treatment (transarterial chemoembolisation, radiofrequency ablation, ethanol injection, resection, chemotherapy, palliation) and the mean survival from diagnosis were not significantly different between the two groups. Conclusion: Patients prospectively followed in a surveillance program had smaller tumours and a trend toward lower alpha fetoprotein levels at diagnosis. Despite multiple treatment modalities utilised in both groups there was no difference in mean survival. Without more effective therapy the benefit of surveillance programs remains unclear. and also weaker elevated in those patients plus hepatic metastasis (median 4.2 pgll, P=O.OOOl). Endoglin serum levels are moderately positive correlated with alpha-fetoprotein. Conclusions: Our results strongly suggest a prognostic and diagnostic potential of endoglin for the development of malignant tumors in chronic liver diseases and severity of liver cirrhosis. The practical implications of endoglin for the prognosis of liver cirrhosis with regard to malignant tumor development and evaluation of severity of liver cirrhosis will be evaluated in prospective studies. University, Suita, Japan BackgroundlAim: Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) with tumor thrimbi in the major branch of the portal vein (FVT) has an extremely poor prognosis. Over 50% of these patients will be dead within 6 months in the natural course and no effective therapy has been reported. Therefore, a new strategy must be necessary for the treatment of these patients. We recently reported the beneficial effects combined intraarterial fluorouracil ( . These findings suggested that IFNAR2 expression in HCC tissues might predict the efficacy of IFNl5-FU combination therapy.

            "text": "The study included 31 patients with HCC and tumor thrombi in the major branches of the portal vein (Vp3 or 4). The unresectable 13 patients were treated with a combination of IFNalpha and 5-FU following the treatment regimen described below. The other 18 postoperative treatment cases were also treated with same therapy for the multiple tumors in the residual liver after surgery. Biopsy samples or operative specimen were obtained from all 31 patients. IFNAR2 expression was examined by immunohistochemistry. Each patient was treated with subcutaneous IFN-alpha and intra-arterial infusion of 5-FU. IFN-alpha (5 MU) was administered on days 1,3, and 5 of every week. Continuous infusion chemotherapy (5-FU, 300 mglmm2lday) through the proper hepatic artery was performed every 2 weeks for 2 weeks. Abdominal CT or MRI was also performed before and after treatment, and once every 3 months. Results: Of these patients, 16 (51.6%) showed objective response [9 (29.0%) showed complete response, 7 (22.6%) partial response], 1 (3.2%) showed no response, and 14 (45.2%) showed progressive disease. Immunohistochemically, IFNAR2 expression was detected in 71.0% (22131). There was significant difference in the overall survival between IFNAR2-positive and negative cases (p<O.OOOl); significant correlation between IFNAW expression and response to therapy (p=0.0002). IFNAR2 expression correlated significantly with the treatment response in univariate analysis (p=0.0002). Conclusion: IFN15-FU combination therapy would be promising for advanced HCC with tumor thrombi in the major portal branches and might be significantly related to IFNAR2 expression. We computed a summary measure of the 5-year cumulative incidence as an immediate assessment of the patient's absolute risk. Results: The patients with cirrhosis have a 3 to 100-fold higher risk of HCC than subjects without cirrhosis depending upon etiology, geographic area and clinical setting (inactive HBV carrier, chronic hepatitis, alcoholism without cirrhosis). Combined data of published studies show that among cirrhotics the highest HCC incidence is associated with HCV infection, about 2 fold higher in Japan than in the West (5-year cumulative incidence of 30% and 17%, respectively), and with hereditary hemochromatosis (5-year cumulative incidence of 21%). In HBV-related cirrhosis, the 5-year cumulative HCC risk is 15% in high endemic areas and 10% in the West. In the absence of HCV and HBV infection, the HCC incidence is lower in alcoholic cirrhotics (5 year cumulative risk of 8%) and in subjects with advanced primary biliary cirrhosis (PBC) (5 year cumulative risk of 4%). There are limited data on HCC risk for cirrhosis of other causes. Older age, male gender, severity of compensated cirrhosis at presentation and sustained activity of liver disease are important predictors of HCC, independent of etiology of cirrhosis. In viral-related cirrhosis, HBVlHCV and HBVlHDV co-infections increase the HCC risk (2-6 fold) as does alcohol abuse (2-4 fold). Conclusions: Irrespective of etiology, the cirrhotic patient has an increased risk of HCC as compared to person without cirrhosis, demonstrating that cirrhosis per se is the major risk factor for HCC development. Among cirrhotics the HCC risk is highest in HCV positive subjects and lowest in alcoholics and subjects with PBC, and it varies substantially according to geographical area. Better knowledge of individual risk factors for HCC in cirrhotics is the basis for disease management and for designing preventive or treatment strategies. There are many patients suffering from recurrence after curative resection of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). To clarify the predictor or risk factors for the recurrence is urgently desired. Interleukin-I8 (IL-18) is a recently described proidammatory cytokine, which has biological functions with Interleukin-12 (IL-12) and includes the activation of natural killer cells, induction of Interferon-?, and Thl cell differentiation. The aim of this study was to investigate whether serum levels of IL-18 was a useful parameter for recurrence of the curatively resected HCC. Methods: The study population consisted of 33 patients who underwent curative resection for HCC. All of them had solitary tumor less than 5 cm in diameter. The follow-up duration was 24 to 52 months after resection. The serum levels of conventional parameters for liver function, values of indocyanine green retention rate (ICGR15) and levels of hyaluronate were examined. Pathological examination of non-cancerous region of the liver was also performed. The relationship between these parameters or post-operative outcome of these patients and serum levels of IL-18 was examined. Results: The serum levels of IL-18 did not correlate well with age, tumor size, tumor stage and other pathological findings.",

Cyclins, cyclin-dependent kinases (Cdks), and Cdk inhibitors (Cdkls) are frequently altered in human cancer. p18\"K4C, a member of the INK4 family among CdkIs, is a potential tumor suppressor gene product. However, the expression of ~1 8 \"~~~ in hepatocel-Iular carcinoma (HCC) remains unknown. The aim of this study was to examine the expression of p18\"K4C in various liver diseases including HCC and to assess its clinical significance in HCC. To that end, we examined the expression of ~1 8 \"~~~ by immunohistochemistry in various liver diseases including 51 HCCs, and also studied the relationship among ~1 8 \"~~~ expression, the phosphorylation of retinoblastoma protein (pRb), and the activity level of Cdk4 and Cdk6. Immunohistochemical analysis revealed the frequent loss of p181NK4C expression in HCC, especially in poorly differentiated HCC. The loss of ~1 8 \"~~~ expression was shown to be associated with a poor prognosis as compared with that associated with ~1 8 \"~~~-positivity. Further, the kinas activity of Cdk4 was found to be higher in p181NK4C-negative HCCs than in pl8lNKY-positive HCCs. However, the level of Cdk6 activity was similar in the two groups of HCCs. In p18INKK-positive HCCs, p18INK4C dominantly interacted with Cdk4 rather than with Cdk6. pRb phosphorylated at Ser 780 was detected more frequently in ~1 8 \"~~~ negative than in pMNKKpositive HCCs. These data suggest that the loss of p181NKK expression may play a role in the differentiation and development of HCC through the upregulation of Cdk4 activity. Increasing evidence has indicated that perturbation of cyclins is one of the major factors leading to cancer. The aim of this study was not only to investigate various cell cycle-related kinase activities in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), but also to analyze the difference of cell cycle-related kinase activity levels between HCC and nontumorous cirrhosis from patients and Long-Evans cinnamon (LEC) rats that are known to develop liver cancer spontaneously. The protein levels of cyclins D1, E, A, and H, and of cyclin dependent kinase 1 (Cdkl), Cdk2, Cdk4, Cdk6, and Cdk7 in HCC and in surrounding nontumorous cirrhosis were determined by Western blot. The enzymatic activities of cyclins D1, E, A, Cdkl, Cdk4, Cdk6, Cdk7, and Weel were measured using in vitro kinase assays. Protein levels and kinase activities of cyclin D1, Cdk4, cyclin E, cyclin A, and Weel in human and LEC rat were significantly elevated in HCC compared with surrounding nontumorous cirrhotic tissues. The enhanced cyclin D1-related kinase activity in HCC from patients and LEC rats was accompanied by the upregulation of Cdk4 activity, but not Cdk6 activity. The kinase activities of Cdk6, Cdk7, and Cdkl did not differ between HCC and surrounding nontumorous cirrhotic tissues from patients and LEC rats. In human cases, the protein levels and kinase activities of cyclin D1, Cdk4, and cyclin E were higher in poorly differentiated HCC and advanced HCC. In conclusion, the increases of cyclin D1, Cdk4, cyclin E, cyclin A, and Weel play an important role in the development of HCC from cirrhosis in human and LEC rat. In addition, cyclin D1, Cdk4, and cyclin E activation may be closely related to the differentiation and progression of human HCC. Stage 1 cases of HCC are more commonly seen by the Gastroenterologists than by Oncologists. The community Gastroenterologists are more likely to refer to a liver transplant center during early stages of HCC than community Oncologists. The community Oncologists are significantly more likely to refer to a surgeon or give systemic chemotherapy compared to the community Gastroenterologists for early HCC. National level large-scale studies are necessary to determine whether such differences in practice patterns affect the outcome of early HCC. Accumulating evidence indicates that the suppressive effects of CD4+CD25+ regulatory T cells are at least partially responsible for the failure of immune-mediated elimination of tumor cells. We previously reported the increase of CD4+CDZ5+ T cells in the liver of patients with HCC, but further examinations remain to be done to determine whether these cells are regulatory T cells or not. Aim: To further investigate the suppressive nature of CD4+CD25+ T cells in the liver of patients with HCC. Patients and Methods: Heparinized peripheral blood and surgically removed liver tissues, or liver biopsy specimens were collected from 25 patients with HCC, 35 patients with chronic hepatitis (CH) or liver cirrhosis (LC) without HCC, and 15 normal donors for living donor liver transplantation. The removed liver tissues with HCC were separated into two parts, the marginal region of tumor (peri-tumor region) and the non-tumor region that was more than 5 cm distant from the tumor margin (nontumor region). Mononuclear cells (MNCs) were separated by Ficoll-gradient. Then various surface markers were investigated by flow cytometry. After T cells and CD4+CD25+ cells were purified from MNCs obtained from blood and pen-tumor regions of HCC respectively, by using immunomagnetic beads, T cells were stimulated with plate-bound anti-CD3 andlor anti-CD28 antibodies with or without purified CD4+CD25+ cells at varying numbers. Proliferation was assayed by measuring [3H]thymidine incorporation. We also investigated the distribution of CD4+CD25+ T cells in the liver with HCC by immunohistochemical staining. Results: We found a significant increase in both the proportion and absolute numbers of CD4+CD25+ T cells in peri-tumor region compared with normal controls (p=O.O11, p=O.OOl) and patients with CH or LC without HCC (p=0.035, p=0.007), but not in unaffected areas of the liver. The distributions of CD4+CD25+ T cells in the liver with immunohistochemical staining are consistent with our results determined by flow cytometry. CD4+CD25+ T cells isolated from peri-tumor regions of HCC displayed phenotype markers characteristic of regulatory T cells (CTLA-I+, CD45RA-, CD69-, and glucocorticoid-induced TNF receptor (GITR)+). Of significance, CD8+ T cells in pen-tumor regions of HCC were inversely proportional to CD4+CD25+ T cells in the same region. Moreover, isolated CD4+CD25+ T cells inhibited autologous CD8+ cell proliferation stimulated with plate-bound anti-CD3 and anti-CDZ8 antibodies.",

It is suggested that these cells inhibit the generation of tumor-specific CD8+ cytotoxic T cell activity and, thereby, contribute to the progression of this malignant disease. Transcatheter arterial chemoembolization (TACE) or q t t r i u m microsphere treatment are used to treat HCC, but little is known about their effects on viral hepatitis. The aim of this study was to determine the effect of cisplatin-based TACE and 9OYttrium microspheres on underlying viral hepatitis in a large cohort of patients with HCC. Methods-Patients diagnosed with HCC in the setting of chronic viral liver disease and treated with TACE or q t t r i u m Therasphere therapy, with at least 3 months of follow-up, were identified. Hepatitis B (HBV) or C (HCV) was diagnosed on the basis of positive serology. TACE patients were treated with cisplatin and gelfoam embolization. Therasphere patients were treated with q t t r i u m microspheres into the hepatic artery. Serial alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and bilirubin levels were collected. Viral hepatitis serology and where available, quantitative viral DNA or RNA titers were recorded before and after TACE or Therasphere treatment, and serial CT scans were obtained to evaluate tumor progression. Patients were separated on the basis of the response to therapy into decreasingktable or increasing tumor size as seen on CT scan within 6 months of the first treatment. A rise in serum ALT above five times baseline was the main criterion for worsening hepatitis. A rise in serum bilirubin twice the baseline was also considered significant. Reactivation of surface antigen or e antigen during treatment, or an increase in at least 1 log10 in quantitative viral RNA or DNA during the first 6 months of treatment was considered significant. Results-52 patients treated with TACE were followed for a mean of 22.0 months. There was a mean of 7.8 TACE sessions over 15.2 months. 39 patients (75%) had decreasedlstable tumor, and 19 had HBV, 28 had HCV and 5 were co-infected. 2 of the 39 (5%) patients with decreasedlstable tumor burden had a sustained increase in serum bilirubin. None had a sustained serum ALT elevation. There was no significant increase in viral load after TACE. 24 patients treated with q t t r i u m microspheres were followed for a mean of 12.0 months. There was a mean of 1.6 sessions. 2 patients (So/,) had increased tumor burden and 22 (92%) had decreasedlstable tumor size. 5 patients had HBV, and 19 had HCV. No patient had a significant elevation of ALT. Conclusion-Neither TACE or q t t r i u m treatment was associated with worsening viral hepatitis in this group of HCC patients. The presence of chronic hepatitis B or C with normal bilirubin should not be an exclusion criterion for the use of these therapies in unresectable HCC patients with or without cirrhosis. Backmound: Non-invasive diagnostic criteria for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) advocated by EASL require either two coincident imaging techniques that demonstrate a hypervascular lesion >2 cm in diameter or one imaging technique with a lesion >2 cm combined with serum AFP level >400 ng/mL. Since the implementation of the MELD system for organ allocation, liver transplants for HCC have nearly tripled and as many as a third of explants are without evidence of HCC.",

Patients' biopsy result and clinical course were compared with the non-invasive EASL criteria for diagnosis of HCC. Results: We identified 118 patients who had liver biopsy performed for evaluation of clinically suspicious HCC. Biopsy positive patients (n=74) had a significantly higher serum AFP levels (median 57 vs. 12, p=0.014) than those with negative biopsies (n=44). Three of eight patients with lesions < 1 cm in diameter were shown on biopsy to have HCC. Mean follow up of 27.5 months for 44 biopsy negative patients revealed ten to later develop HCC. Using the non-invasive EASL criteria, 18 of the 44 biopsy negative patients would have been diagnosed with HCC at the time of biopsy. Overall, of 62 patients meeting the non-invasive EASL criteria for HCC, only 50 were found to have HCC on biopsy or follow up and 8 (13%) would have been falsely diagnosed. No patient developed evidence of tumor spread along the needle track after biopsy. Conclusions: Our data questions the accuracy of the non-invasive EASL criteria for diagnosing HCC, as about one in ten patients who would have been diagnosed with HCC using these criteria turned out not to have HCC on biopsy or follow up. The majority of cases in this series had HCC < 5 cm in diameter, making them candidates for one or other form of potentially curative therapy. Over a third of patients with lesions < 1 cm in diameter were found to have HCC. We recommend routine image-guided biopsy of lesions clinically and radiographically suspicious for HCC to anow adequate treatment planning as the risks of biopsy appear small and the potential benefits significant. Background: Hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection contributes to the development of acute and chronic hepatitis, cirrhosis, and hepatocellular carcinoma. Combination therapy with interferon-@ and ribavirin is the standard treatment for HCV patients but is modestly effective, and no vaccine is currently available. Dendritic cells (DCs) are professional antigen-presenting cells capable of eliciting a strong anti-viral response of naike T cells. We have previously shown that DCs transduced with HCV NS5 protein elicit high levels CTL activity and T H~ type immune response in a murine model. However, the efficacy of vaccination with different HCV proteins, such as HCV core, is unclear. Methods: The DC population in BALBlc mice was expanded by hydrodynamic delivery of naked DNA encoded the secreted form of Flt3L. The CDllc-enriched DC population obtained from the spleen was transduced in vitro with recombinant NS5 protein or Core protein using a macromolecular-based protein delivery system. Mice were inoculated subcutaneously three times at 2-week intervals with NS5-transduced DCs or Core-transduced DCs or non-transduced DCs. Two and 10 weeks following the final inoculation, the CTL activity was assessed in vitro using NS5-or Core-expressing myeloma cells as target cells in a conventional 51Cr-release assay. Additionally, the splenocytes obtained from vaccinated mice were co-cultured with NS5 or Core for 48 hours, and the quantities of IFN-y and IL-4 present in the culture supernatants were determined by ELISA. The percent of cytokine producing cells were quantified by flow cytometric analyses. Results: Relative to mice inoculated with non-transduced DCs, splenocytes derived from mice immunized with NS5-transduced DCs exhibited 3-to 5-fold more NS5 specific CTL activity. These same cells exhibited robust production of IFN-y, but not IL-4, typical of a THY type response when cultured in the presence of NS5; IFN-y production was completely suppressed by anti-CD4 mAb. Importantly, elevations in NS5 specific CTL activity and IFN-y production were maintained for at least at 10 weeks post-vaccination. In contrast, splenocytes derived from mice immunized with Core-transduced DCs exhibited 3to 4-fold more Core specific CTL activity at 2 weeks post vaccination. However, these same cells exhibited no elevated production of IFN-y nor IL-4. Elevations in Core specific CTL activity were not observed at 10 weeks post-vaccination. Conclusion: Vaccination using DCs transduced with different HCV proteins leads to different antigen specific CD4 cytokine responses. The antigen specific T H~ type immune responses elicited by NS5-transduced DCs may be closely related to the sustained vaccine efficacy. These findings may provide important insights into the development of a therapeutic HCV vaccine. correlates better with liver function as predicted by QLFTs than liver biopsy. Patients: QLFTs were measured in 232 patients enrolled in HALT C prior to retreatment. Patients were divided into four quartiles for each QLFT, stratified from best to worst function, and SVR within each quartile was determined. Methods:",

Several studies, including recent data from the HALT-C (Hepatitis C Antiviral Long-Term Treatment Against Cirrhosis) trial (Gastroenterology 2004; 1261015) , have demonstrated that SVR was adversely affected when the dose of either PEGIFN and/or RBV were reduced during the first 12-20 weeks of therapy, particularly in patients with HCV genotype 1. Unfortunately, none of these prior studies contained a large enough sample size to evaluate the impact of dose reducing PEGIFN andlor RBV by variable amounts independent of the other or examined if the decline in SVR was due to reducing or discontinuing one or both of these agents.

At the beginnig of combination therapy, about three months after splenic artery embolization, the mean platelet count was significantly higher than the baseline value (104000 unitslp1-C 15900 SD; P<O.OOl) and a platelet count of at least 80000 unitslpl was reached in all patients. After the first two months of combination therapy the mean platelet count was 93000 unitdpl 2 12000 SD, significantly higher than the baseline value (P<O.001). The end-of-treatment platelet count of the two break-trough patients was 91000 unitslpl and 104000 unitslpl respectively. The end-oftreatment platelet count of the three patients who completed the 48 week course of therapy was 85000 unitslpl, 94000 unitslpl, and BSOOO unitslpl respectively. No any serious side effect was registered after the splenic artery embolization, nor during the combination therapy course. Conclusions: proximal splenic artery embolization was safe and allowed pegylated interferon and ribavirin therapy in a group of thrombocytopenic subjects affected by severe hepatitis C. The improvement of platelet count obtained by this procedure persisted during the whole treatment course, that has been, in three subjects, 48 week long. Demographics of patients with paired biopsies were similar to the intent to treat population. For those patients who had paired biopsies, SVRs were obtained in 9, 16, and 37% in the IFN, and Peg-90 and Peg-180 arms, respectively. Improvements in the inflammatory grade and fibrosis stage were seen in 23.9% and 29.3% of patients, respectively. Fibrosis improvement was 35% in the Peg-180 group, 25% in the Peg-90 group, and 27% for IFN. All measures of virologic response were highly correlated with inflammation and fibrosis improvement. There was a significant improvement (p<.05) in fibrosis from baseline when tested separately for all patients, SVRs, relapsers, and a trend of improvement was present for non-responders (p=.067). Conclusions: Patients with advanced fibrosis and cirrhosis, experience sustained histologic benefit after treatment with IFN. Although the greatest benefit was seen in patients with SVR, relapsers and nonresponders still obtained a moderate histologic benefit. In light of these results suggesting that potential to delay liver decompensation and avoid liver transplantation, the 12 week stopping rule may be reconsidered. for fatigue associated with chronic hepatitis C (CHC).

York, NY Backmound: The lower limit of detection of most polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assays for hepatitis C virus (HCV) RNA is 50-100 IUlmL: The transcription-mediated amplification (TMA) method has the capability to detect s 5 IUImL. Studies have suggested that with interferon and ribavirin therapy, a positive TMA at the end of treatment is strongly associated with relapse, but the significance of TMA with peginterferon and ribavirin combination therapy requires further study. Aim: To assess the predictive value of TMA in patients who are PCR negative after 24 weeks or more of peginterferon and ribavirin therapy. Methods: A chart review was conducted to identify patients who had a qualitative TMA (Bayer) in the setting of negative PCR (Roche Amplicor) at 24 weeks of treatment or later. Patients had between 1 and 6 TMA determinations. All patients continued treatment after the first TMA+ result and were followed for at least 3 months after cessation of therapy. Patients were divided into 2 groups: (1) PCR-ITMA-and (2) PCR-ITMA+. The groups were analyzed for end of treatment (EOT) response, sustained virologic response (SVR), breakthrough, and post-treatment relapse, as defined by PCR testing. Results: Overall, 36 patients were included in this study. Twenty-six patients were PCR-ITMA-and 10 patients were PCR-ITMA+ at 24 weeks of treatment or later. Twenty-one patients (58%) were followed to ? 6 months following cessation of therapy (longer-term data will be presented). The rates of PCR negativity at 2 3 months following cessation of treatment were 20I26 (77%) in PCR-ITMA-and 3/10 (30%) in PCR-ITMA+ patients (p = 0.00s).

Our aim is to further characterise the effect of treatment with interferon plus ribavirin on bone mass and bone turnover in these patients. Patients and Methods: 34 chronic hepatitis C naYve patients (serologically and histologically demonstrated) were enrolled (mean age 41 years; range 25-55; 24 male, mean age 42, range 27-55; 10 female, mean age 40, range 25-51). All of them had elevated serum ALT levels, and they met the current criteria for therapy. With a prospective design, patients were studied on three occasions: Before treatment with interferona (3 MU thrice a week) and ribavirin (1000-1200 mgld) (basal), 24 weeks and 48 weeks after starting therapy. The following examinations were performed each time: BMD, measured by dual x-ray absorciometry at lumbar spine (LS) and femoral neck (FN) (results were expressed as z-score values). Analysis were made for biochemical liver function tests, serum bone Gla-protein (BGP), insulin-like growth factor I, insulin-like growth factor binding globulin type 3,25-hidroxivitamin D (25OHD), intact parathyroid hormone, free testosterone index, and urinary deoxypyridinoline excretion (D-Pyr). Multivariate analysis was performed with a multiple linear regression test. Values were expressed as mean2SD. p<0,05). We found no differences for the rest of parameters between basal values and after 48 weeks of therapy. Positive correlations were found between: BMD in LS and 250HD (r:0,45; p<O,O4), BGP and D-Pyr (r:0,58;p<0,005), D-Pyr and total alkaline phosphatase (r:0.39;~<0,05). Inverse correlations were found between: BMD-FN and serum ALT levels (r:-0.36;~<0,04), BMD-LS and serum BGP (r<-0,40; p<0,04). Conclusions: Our study shows that interferon-a and ribavirin therapy in patients with chronic hepatitis C improves BMD in both LS and FN, and seems to reduce the high bone turnover found in these patients before treatment.

            "text": "Background and Aim: A major side effect of IFN plus ribavirin combination therapy for chronic hepatitis C is ribavirin-induced hemolytic anemia that often leads to the discontinuation of therapy and then to treatment failure. Although the severity of anemia depends mainly on the patient's renal function, no recommendations currently exist for renal function based dosing of ribavirin. The aim of study was to obtain data which may provide insight on the appropriate maintenance dose of ribavirin. Methods: Ninety-five patients with chronic hepatitis C (56 males and 39 females, mean age: 51.6 years) who received IFN alfa-2b and ribavirin combination therapy were included in the analysis. These patients received ribavirin at the dose of 600, 800, or 1000 mglday based on body weight, and the dose was reduced by 200 mglday or discontinued depending on the decrease of hemoglobin levels. Total clearance (CLIF) of ribavirin was calculated according to the method described by Karmar et al. x (1-0.42 x sex)lserum creatinine (sex: 0 for males and 1 for females). Serum ribavirin levels were determined at Week 1,2,4, and 8 of treatment. For the analysis of factors affecting the reduction in hemoglobin levels, the dose of ribavirin by body weight, baseline hemoglobin level, baseline platelet level, baseline serum ALT, and CLlF were examined in multivariate analysis. Results: Of the 95 patients, 17 (17.9%) had the dose of ribavirin reduced and 7 (7.4%) discontinued ribavirin administration. CLlF was distributed widely, ranging from 5.2 to 62.9 Llhr (mean: 15.1 Llhr). Correlation (reverse) between serum ribavirin levels and CLlF was significant only at Week 4. All patients 60 years old or older had CLlF of less than 15 Llhr. The results of multiple regression analysis indicated that baseline hemoglobin level was the factor contributing most to the discontinuation of combination therapy (p=0.070), and CLlF was the only significant factor (p=O.OOl) associated with the reduction in the ribavirin dose. In fact, only 3 of 38 (7.8%) patients with CLlF of 15 Llhr or more compared to 11 of 20 (55%) patients with CLlF of less than 10 Llhr required a reduction of the ribavirin dose. Additionally, in patients with CLlF of less than 15 Llhr, a greater magnitude of change in hemoglobin levels was observed at Week 1 in patients requiring dose reduction (0.34 gldl) than in those who did not Conclusions: CL/F of ribavirin is the factor most influencing the incidence of hemolytic anemia. This suggests that the dose of ribavirin should also be determined based on CLlF. The results also indicate that attention should be paid to early decrease in hemoglobin levels to avoid discontinuation of therapy.

Osteopontin, an extracellular matrix with RGD sequence, is a cytokine crucial for the initiation of Thl immune reaction. Recently, we identified 4 SNPs (nt -155, -433, -616, -1,748) in the promoter region of osteopontin gene, and demonstrated that SNP at nt -433 may be a marker to reflect hepatitis activity in patients with chronic hepatitis C (BBRC 313 1079 (BBRC 313 ,2004 . We postulate that such SNPs might determine the responsiveness of IFN therapy through regulation of Thl immune reaction in chronic hepatitis C patients. The present paper reports this possibility. Patients 6 Methods: Subjects were 76 patients with chronic hepatitis C who received IFN-dblribavirin combination therapy or IFN monotherapy with IFN-j3 injections at 12-h intervals as an induction therapy. Blood was collected from the patients, and SNPs in the promoter region of osteopontin gene were determined using DNA purified from mononuclear cells by INVADER assay. Results 6 Discussion: Alleles of SNPs at nt -443 and -1,748 were analyzed, because 3 SNPs at nt -155, -616 and -1,748 showed linkage disequilibrium with D and 9 greater than 0.937 to each others in our preliminary experiments. Sustained viral response (SVR) was obtained in 43 patients (57%); 86% (6I7) in those with serum RNA levels less than 100 KIUlmL of genotype lb, 40% (16/40) with the levels 100 KIUImL or more of genotype l b and 72% (21I29) with genotype 2a and 2b. The ratio of SVR was 81% (22I27) in patients with alleles of GIA and AIA in SNP at nt -1,748, which was significantly greater than the ratio (43%; 21149) in those with allele of AIA. Similar results were found in intractable patients in which HCV of genotype l b was infected and serum HCV-RNA levels were 100 KIUImL or more; SVR ratio was 75% (9I12) in those with the former alleles, while the ratio was 25% (7/21) with the later allele (p<0.05). Also, the ratios of SVR differed depending on the alleles of SNP at nt -443. The ratio was 86% (19I22) in patients with TIT, which was significantly greater than the ratio (45%; 24/53) in those with CIT or CIC. Such difference was also found when SVR ratio was evaluated in intractable patients (73%: 8/11 vs 28%: 8/29, p<0.05). All patients showing GIA or GIG in SNP at nt 1,748 and TIT in SNP at nt -443 became SVR after IFN therapy, suggesting that positive predictive value of the S N P analysis to estimate the efficacy of the therapy was 100%. Conclusion: SNPs in the promoter region of osteopontin gene may be useful as markers to estimate efficacy of IFN therapy with high positive predictive value in chronic hepatitis C patients. ",

These events may be related to a direct ototoxic effect caused by IFN, autoimmunity, microvascular pathology, or an effect of the HCV virus itself. It is not clear whether individual reports represent rare associations or an important pattern of drug toxicity. Methods: The FDA Adverse Event Reporting System (AERS) was searched using the MedDRA grouping terms of Hearing Disorders NEC and Hearing Losses for reports of hearing loss associated with IFN or Peg-IFN+RBV. Results: We identified 110 unduplicated cases of hearing loss in patients receiving IFN or Peg-IFN+RBV for the treatment of HCV from 1993 to 2004; 66 with standard IFN and 44 with Peg-IFN; of those, 78 were in combination with RBV. Sixty-six were male, 39 female and 5 unknown with a mean age of 49 years (range, 29-72). 50 cases were from the US and 60 were non-US cases. Mean duration of therapy was 5 months (range, 1 day to 20 months). Unilateral hearing loss was reported in 43 cases and bilateral hearing loss was reported in 20 cases. Eleven patients had a previous history of hearing loss. Of the 110 patients, 29 reported some degree of permanent hearing loss following cessation of HCV therapy; of these 17 prematurely discontinued HCV therapy, 6 completed their course of HCV therapy, and 6 are unknown. Conclusions: Although this retrospective analysis was based on spontaneously reported AEs with known limitations for determining causal relationships, these data suggest that non-reversible hearing loss may potentially be an important adverse event related to interferon-based anti-HCV therapy. Thus, the benefit to continued treatment should be balanced against the potential risk that any deficit in hearing may be permanent. ",

The aim of this study was to analyze if iron depletion may improve the rate of response to antiviral therapy. Methods: Twenty patients (19 male and 3 female; mean age 55.0527.03 years) with PCT and histologically proven HCV chronic hepatitis were randomized to undergo (Group 1) or not (Group 2) phlebotomy for iron depletion before antiviral therapy. Patients in Group 1 received 450 ml phlebotomy every two weeks (mean 10.8 sessions, range 6-15) until iron deficiency was achieved as defined by two of three criteria: ferritin 4 0 ng/mL, transferrin saturation <20%, haemoglobin 5 11.5 gldL. Patients in Group 1 (9 males and 1 female, mean age 5122.1 years, range 36-57) had mean urinary porphyrin level 2106.7 2 1870 pg/L (range 204-5263), and mean serum ferritin level 549 2 374.9 ng/mL. All patients in Group 1 were infected by genotype lb. Patients in Group 2 (10 males, mean age 59 t 4.8 years, range 51 -67) had mean urinary porphyrin level 1182 -t 1280 pg/L (range 177-4392), and mean serum femtin level 6905352 nglmL. Eight patients were infected by genotype lb and 2 by genotype 2a. All patients received pegylated interferon plus ribavirin according to the body weight. The patients in Group 1 started antiviral therapy 3 months after the end of iron depletion. Results: In Group 1 basal porphyrin level (2106.72 1870 microg/L) decreased after iron depletion to 518.42370.8 miaoglL (p<0.05). Baseline ALT levels (118244.4 IUIL) dropped to 65.3 2 26.8 lUlL (p<0.02), and GGT levels decreased from 112.9235.7 IUlL to 71.153'1 IUlL (p<0.02) after iron depletion. Viral load was similar before (median 6.4, range 5.9-6.9 log copieslml) and after (median 6.5, range 5.7-6.7) iron depletion. After iron depletion, one patient had porphyrin and GGT levels within the normal range, one patient had normal GGT and one normal ALT. In no case interferon or ribavirin dosage had to be reduced. Sustained virological response was obtained in 3 (15%) of the 20 patients treated, 2 in group 1 and 1 in group 2 , l patient in Group 1 showed a virological relapse three months after the end of therapy. All responder patients were infected by genotype lb. Conclusions: 1) Iron depletion in patients with PCT and chronic HCV infection has a favourable effect both on the metabolic defect and on liver enzyme levels. 2) The observation of similar viral titer before and after phlebotomy suggests that iron depletion does not affect significantly the rate of viral replication. 3) The rate of sustained response to antiviral teraphy is low in patients with PCT and HCV chronic hepatitis 4) Iron depletion doesn't seem to improve the rate of response in these patients.

            "text": "Background Recent in vivo and in vitro studies demonstrate that some variants of hepatitis C virus have a tropism for blood mononuclear cells. In particular, mutations have been described in the internal ribosomal entry site located in the 5' untranslated part of HCV (SUTR) suggesting adaptation to different cell types. The influence of this dual tropism on the natural and therapeutical course of HCV is unknown. Patients and methods 119 nake patients chronically infected by HCV were included; 62 of them were sampled few weeks before a conventional therapy by pegylated interferon-alpha and ribavirin. Plasma and blood mononuclear cells (BMC) HCV RNAs were amplified in the 5'UTR and compared through single strand conformational polymorphism (SSCP), line probe assay and cloning-sequencing. Results Paired plasma and BMC SSCP profiles were different in 54/112 (48%) analyzable cases. Cloning of plasma and BMC SUTRs in 15 patients confirmed that SSCP profiles were different between compartments if more than 4 mutations existed. Among the 54 patients, 27 (24% of the total population) were coinfected by two HCV types or subtypes; one being detectable only in BMC (n=25) or only in plasma (n=2). SSCP-defined compartmentalization was more frequent in former drug users (31/51:60 %) or in multitransfused patients (415: 80%) than in others (19/5634%); less frequent in case of genotype lb: 11/46 (24%) vs 43/66 (65%, p<O.Ol); was not related to viral load, age, duration of infection, or fibrosis score. Among the 62 treated patients, SSCP-defined and genotypic compartmentalizations were more frequent in patients with sustained virological response: 23/33 ( 70%) vs 5/29 (17%; p<O.OOl) and 11/16 (69%) vs 5/46 (11%; p CO.02). This strong relation was independent of the route of infection, plasma genotypes and duration of infection. Conclusion Patients coinfected by HCV strains with differential tropism have a good response to interferon-alpha and ribavirin. This previously unrecognized population of patients with occult coinfection could have mounted a particular immune response to HCV antigens favoring the response to interferon.

Background: Pegylated interferons have recently replaced conventional interferon for treatment of chronic hepatitis C due to their high efficacy in inducing sustained virological response. Objective: This randomized, parallel-group, double-blind trial is designed to assess the efficacy and safety of 24 or 48 weeks of treatment with peginterferon-alpha2b in chronic hepatitis C genotype 4. Patients and Methods: 148 patients with chronic hepatitis C genotype 4 matched for age, gender, duration and stage of liver disease at enrollment were randomly assigned to receive peginterferon alfa-2b ( 1.5 microglkg) once weekly plus daily ribavirin (1000 or 1200 mg, depending on body weight) for 24 (Group A: n=48). 36 (Group B=50) or 48 weeks (Group C: n=60). Liver functions, HCV-RNA titers and viral kinetics were evaluated before, during and after therapy. Liver biopsies and histopathological evaluation are performed before therapy induction and at end of follow-up. The primary treatment endpoint is to achieve sustained virologic response marked by undetectable HCV RNA concentration at the end of 24 weeks of follow-up after cessation of therapy. Secondary end-points are end of treatment virological responses and histological response. Results: In patients infected with HCV genotype 4, sustained virologic response was achieved in 46/60 subjects (76%), 37/50 (74%) and 23/48 (48%) treated with peginterferon-alpha2b and ribavirin for 48,36,24 weeks respectively. Overall 48 and 36 weeks of treatment were statistically superior to 24 weeks (P=0.02). The difference in sustained virologic response rates between 48 and 36 weeks of treatment was not statistically significant (p=0.3).

This is an interim report of a study evaluating the role of IR. Methods: Non diabetic, HCV positive patients between the 18 & 70 positive were enrolled. Liver biopsy was performed within 36 months prior to therapy. Fasting blood sugar (FBS), fasting insulin level (FIL), waist measurement, and weight, was collected at several points during therapy to determine if any could be used to predict sustained viral response (SVR). HOMA score was calculated as (FBS * RL)l22.5. HCV RNA was measured at baseline (BL), and at Week 12 of therapy. Patients were treated with pegylated-interferon alpha 2b and weight-based ribavirin. Fisher's exact test was used to determine if HOMA score predicted who achieved early virologic response (EVR). Resrtlts: 220 (67% M, 33% F) have been enrolled. 74% were GT-I.",

Mean HOMA score was 15.5 and mean fibrosis stage was 1.27 for those in the lowest quartile of HOMA score (63.5 and 2.0 in the highest quartile, respectively). 23% were African-American in the lowest quartile, and 30% were African American in the highest quartile. 79% of those whose BL HOMA score was in the lowest quartile achieved EVR, whereas 66% of those in the highest three quartiles of BL HOMA scores achieved EVR (p=O.164). 68% of those whose BL weight was in the lowest quartile of weight achieved EVR, and 68% of those in the highest three quartiles of BL weight achieved EVR (p=0.582). 58% of those whose BL waist measurement was in the lowest quartile achieved SVR, whereas 72% of those whose waist measurement was in the highest three quartiles achieved EVR (p=O.144). Discussion: Among the common correlates with increasing insulin resistance and decreased responsiveness to interferonlribavirin therapy include age, race, weight, fibrosis stage. Previous work has indicated that insulin resistance is associated with decreased T-cell responsiveness. The question arises is insulin resistance the underlying factor or are these other factors surrogates for the effect of insulin resistance upon T-cells. At this early stage, those who are most insulin sensitive have a trend towards more frequent EVR. This study excludes diabetics and therefore, does not include the most insulin resistant patients. This preliminary data suggests a role for insulin resistance but must be confirmed with complete enrollment with comparisons to other factors known to decrease SVR. (IFN) have been shown to be effective inhibitors of HCV replication in human cell lines carrying HCV replicons. To better define the divergent cellular processes involved in the control of intracellular HCV replication by these agents, we have characterized the anti-HCV profiles of monotherapies and combination therapies with four major types of human interferons and correlated these with host gene expressionlactivity patterns in the HCV replicon cell line, AVA5. Alpha-IFN, beta-IFN, and omega-IFN were equally effective at inhibiting HCV replication, while gamma-IFN was approximately 10-fold more potent. In combination therapies, alpha-IFN and gamma-IFN (Type I + Type I1 IFN) displayed the most enhanced and strongly synergistic antiviral effects. In contrast, antagonistic interactions were observed for combinations of alpha-IFN with either omega-IFN or beta-IFN (two Type I IFN). Microarrays and a functional assay for transcriptionlsignal transduction factor activation were used to analyze gene expressionlactivity patterns in all groups compared to untreated AVA5 cells and the parental cell line, Huh7. AVA5 cells displayed a marked, global, reduction in gene expression and signal transduction factor activity compared to Huh7 cells, indicating a significant alteration in the cellular environment induced by chronic HCV replication. All interferons induced different gene expressionlactivity profiles in AVA5 cells, implying multiple cellular pathways are involved in the antiviral response. Multi-dimensional scaling analysis revealed that these patterns were clearly shifted, to varying degrees, towards the pattern observed in Huh7 cells. The alpha-IFNlgamma-IFN combination produced a gene expression pattern most similar to Huh7. Interferon treatments showed no common pattern of gene expressionlactivity correlated with the anti-HCV activity, although several apparently key candidate genes have been identified. No IFN activation of well-established host antiviral pathways (e.g. Mx, RNaseL, BZ-microglobulin, PK) was consistently observed. IFN treatments generally suppressed the expression of genes involved in apoptosislprogrammed cell death. Simultaneous activation of transcription factors involved in host response to both Type I and I1 IFNs was observed in alpha/ gamma-IFN combination treatments. A general correlation was observed between relative anti-HCV potency of an individual IFN treatment and the ability to restore the cellular environment (e.g. gene expressionltranscriptionlsignal transduction) back towards a 'pre-infection' (e.g. Huh7) status. The characterization of hepatic cellular pathways and processes involved in the control of HCV infection will help to identify new targets andlor markers of effective anti-HCV therapy. 2.However some of these function tend to show significant improvement after 3-6 months of treatment. 3.After the next evaluation we will try to find out whether there is some cognitive improvement in the group of patients with failure of treatment, and a few months after finishing treatment. Background: HCV is a leading cause of morbidity and mortality among patients with HIV infection. However, HIVVIHCV coinfected patients are less likely to be treated for HCV than those with HCV monoinfection. The aims of this study were to determine the proportion of HIVlHCV coinfected persons that were referred for HCV treatment and to determine barriers to HCV therapy in this population. Methods: Consecutive patients with newly diagnosed HCV infection over a 1-year period from 1/1/00 through 12/31/00 were identified by using the computerized patient record system at our medical center. Demographic and follow-up data through 6/30/02 were collected by reviewing electronic medical records. The follow-up time was calculated from the time of diagnosis of HCV until the time of the last follow-up visit. At our medical center, all HCV treatment is performed by the GI service and ID physicians do not treat HCV infection. with HCV monoinfection (p = 0.57).

Strategies to overcome these barriers are needed in order to increase the number of coinfected patients that are treated for HCV infection. week's treatment of chronic hepatitis C can be limited if the treatment is stopped early in patients unlikely to respond. Current stopping rules are based on HCV-RNA measurements. Aims: To determine whether individualised recommendations for stopping treatment can be based on a simple alanine aminotransferase test, also taking into account the cost-per-cure. Method: Individual patient data from 13 randomised controlled trials with interferon alone or combined with ribavirin were analysed. We used multiple logistic regression to investigate the increase in probability of sustained virological response by prolonging treatment from 24 to 48 weeks. This analysis was performed for different patient types, using the following explanatory variables: alanine aminotransferase levels during treatment, age, sex, genotype and presence of cirrhosis. Decisions to continue treatment were based on an increase in sustained virological response of 10% or more, in view of its clinical relevance. If the increase was less than lo%, the cost-percure became decisive with a limit of \u20ac50,000. Results: The probability of sustained virological response increased by less than 10% if treatment was continued up to 48 weeks in patients with genotype 1 or 4 without cirrhosis who had elevated alanine aminotransferase at week 4. The cost-per-cure would exceed \u20ac50,000 for these patients. Sustained virological response rates in cirrhotic patients increased by 1447% if treatment was continued up to 48 weeks. Non-cirrhotics with genotype 2 or 3 did not benefit when treatment continued beyond 24 weeks. Conclusion: Dynamics of alanine aminotransferase and cost-per cure are proposed as useful components for medical decision making about the duration of therapy in chronic hepatitis C. Chronic hepatitis C (CHC) infection is the leading cause of liver disease post renal transplant. Renal transplantation is associated with a significant worsening of liver disease in recipients who are positive for hepatitis C virus antibody (anti-HCV) prior to transplantation. This is an important clinical problem since the prevalence of CHC in patients on long-term hemodialysis ranges from 10% -60%. Moreover, treatment after transplantation is associated with an increased risk of graft rejection. Futhermore, ribavirin is contraindicated in these prior to transplant. Effective treatment of CHC is needed in these patients to prevent the progression of liver disease, particularly in renal allograft recipients and to lower the risk of potential transmission of HCV within hemodialysis (HD) units. Objectives: To determine the treatment responses to interferon (IFN) monotherapy in CHC patients with chronic renal insufficiency (CRI) (creatinine 2 1.6) or end stage renal disease (ESRD). Methods: Thirty-six patients with CRI and 136 patients with ESRD were identilied from a computer database of more than 2500 patients with HCV infection seen at our institution since January 1993. Thirteen of the 36 patients with CRI and 22 of the 136 patients with ESRD underwent treatment with IFN. The outcomes measured were end of treatment response (ETR) and sustained viral response (SVR). Of the 28 patients with ESRD, 23 patients were on hemodialysis and 5 on peritoneal dialysis.",

The mean pretreatment serum HCV RNA by PCR was 844,542 IUIml and the mean pretreatment ALT was 64 UIL. Information on genotype was available in 32 patients. Genotype 1 accounted for 97% of the patients and one patient was genotype 2a. Thirtyseven patients underwent liver biopsy. In 62% no (stage 0) or early fibrosis (stage 1 and 2) was noted; 14% had stage 3 and 24% showed cirrhosis. This was an intention to treat analysis. Twentynine patients were treated with standard IFN and 6 patients with pegylated-IFN. Two patients (6%), one treated with standard IFN and one treated with PEG-IFN, achieved ETR but relapsed after 48 weeks. None of the patients achieved an SVR. Eight patients discontinued therapy because of side effects and 5 patients were non-compliant and lost to follow-up after 4 weeks of therapy. Hence the drop out rate was about 37%. Conclusions: Our data suggest that CHC patients with ESRD and CRI respond poorly to IFN monotherapy in contrast to the observation made by other institutions where the response was as good as in non-renal failure patients. A higher prevalence of AA patient population and predominance of genotype 1 at our institution could explain this poor response. In earlier studies we already could demonstrate a significant correlation between GGT level and treatment response in HCVinfected patients receiving combination therapy. The aim of the present study was to establish in large group of patients whether GGT can be taken as an independent predictive factor beyond the other already established predictive parameters (as for instance, viral load, fibrosis stage, and age).

Backmound: Thyroid dysfunction is frequently seen during interferon therapy in patients treated for hepatitis C or malignant melanoma. Both hypothyroidism and hyperthyroidism might occur. Thus TSH monitoring is required during the course of therapy and discontinuation of the drugs is often neccessary.During interferon monotherapy the prevalence of thyroid dysfunction was < 10%. After introduction of the combination therapy of interferon and ribavirin and more recently of PEG-interferon and ribavirin the prevalence raised. The aim of the studv was to determine the prevalence and the clinical relevance of thyroid dysfunction in patient treated for hepatitis C with different treatment regimes. Furthermore associations of thyroid dysfunction with treatment response, viral genotype and preexisting thyroid autoantibodies were analysed. Patients and Methods: 245 patients treated for hepatitis C in clinical trials with prospective determinations of thyroid function were enrolled. 6 therapeutic regimes were included Interferon alpha (IFN), IFN -1 Ribavirin ( IFN + Riba), Consensus interferon (CIFN), CIFN + Riba, PEG-Interferon (PEG-IFN) und PEG-IFN + Riba. In all cases thyroid function was determined prior, during and after therapy. Thyroid autoantibodies were analysed before therapy and in all cases of thyroid dysfunction during therapy. The results were correlated with the virological response and viral genotype. Results: In 39 out of 245 treated patients (15,9%) thyroid dysfuntion was seen. 16 cases with primary hypothyrroidism, 13 cases with hyperthyroidism and a biphasic dysfunction in 10 cases. Thyroid dysfunction was seen more frequently during PEG-IFN and ribavirin combination therapy (26%). In all treatment regimes sustained virological response was positively associated with the onset of thyroid disease during treatment (p < 0.05). The probability of thyroid disease raised from 20% to 50% if preexisting thyroid autoantibodies were present prior to the antiviral therapy. Only in 2 out of 39 cases the antiviral therapy has to be stopped due to significant thyroid disease. In both cases classical Graves disease with was diagnosed. Long term thyroid hormon substitution was neccessary in 14 out of 39 cases. Conclusions: The current antiviral combination therapy of hepatitis C is frequently associated with thyroid dysfunction. Thyroid dysfunction is more often seen if preexisting thyroid autoantibodies are determiend. On the other hand is the sustained virological response to antiviral therapy positive correlated with thyroid dysfunction.

Decreasing RBV exposure has been suggested to have a negative influence on sustained virologic response (SVR) rates. Here we present analysis of the relationship between the reasons and timing of reductions in RBV dose and SVR rates. Methods: Pooled data from 569 patients with HCV genotype 1 from 2 phase I11 trials ( I n population) randomized to 48wk of PEGASYS 18OmcgIwk and RBV lo00 mgld (body weight <75 kg) or 1200 mgld (body weight 275 kg) were analyzed. Use of erythropoietin to manage adverse events (AE) was prohibited. The RBV dose was reduced to 600 mgld for adverse events (AE) or laboratory abnormalities (LA). 4 categories of RBV exposure during the 48 wk treatment period were created for this analysis: early (before wk 12) and late (after wk 12) reductions due to AEILA, reductions for reasons other than AEILA, and no dose reduction. Results (Table) : The Lymphocytic infiltration and destruction of hepatocytes are characteristic features of chronic Hepatitis C virus (CHCV) infection. The molecular mechanisms underlying chemotactic lymphocyte recruitment are poorly understood but are crucial in determining the course of CHCV. Herein, a biometric multiplex sandwich ELISA was used to characterize the immunomodulatory effects of host response in CHCV patients (n=lO, mean age=44.40). Methods: Serum levels of 3 conspicuous chemokines CXCL8 (IL-a), CCL2 (MCP-1) and CCL4 (MIP-1P) were studied before and after 1 month of treatment with weekly peginterferon alfa 2b injections and daily ribavarin, and compared against 10 healthy controls. A regression analysis was performed to derive an equation from standards that was then used to predict serum chemokine concentrations. A two-tailed student's t test (with threshold of p < 0.05) and correlational clustering (with Pearson's coefficient threshold of p > 0.85) was used to determine if specific responses are associated with and may therefore regulate discrete aspects of disease pathology. Results: In patients, serum chemokine levels were significantly higher (p<0.05) than controls. One month post treatment, both viral titers and overall serum chemokine levels decreased in patients (pc0.05). To assess relationships between changes in cytokine levels and changes in viral titer, patients were divided into 3 statistically distinct subgroups based on change in viral titers. Specific sets of chemokines decreased in each subgroup. Furthermore, using correlational clustering, patients with strong to moderate response to treatment were clustered in one group while patients with weak response clustered separately into 2 minor groups. This demonstrates that a mechanistic link between therapeutic response and host response exists and that the mechanisms of control involved can be elucidated on a patientspecific basis through serum cytokine profiling. Of note, only decrease in serum CCL4 levels correlated with decrease in viral titers in all patients. Decreased CCL4 levels were also observed after one month of therapy in all strong and moderate responders and remained unchanged or were increased in patients with the weakest response to therapy. Conclusions: CCL4 controls leukocyte influx and progresses inflammation. Our data for the first time raises the possibility that CCL4 in part influences an appropriate treatment-induced host response to CHCV infection. Furthermore, it provides us with a potential prognostic marker, while elucidating the chemotactic mechanisms in the pathogenesis and treatment of CHCV. Further studies to evaluate the therapeutic effect of CCL4 neutralization on inflammation control and therapeutic response are warranted. ",

Methods: Hepatitis C patients who were non-responders to a previous course of at least 24 weeks of combination therapy were enrolled.

Conclusions: These data suggest that thymalfasin adds to the efficacy of PEG-IFN2a plus ribavirin in inducing an end of treatment response in patients with HCV who are non-responders to previous combination therapy.

The goal of this study was to clarify the immunomodulatory effects of ribavirin in patients with chronic hepatitis C (CHC). Patients and Methods: Thirty-four adult patients with biopsy-proven CHC were studied. The enrollment criteria included an age between 28 and 71 years, demonstration of CHC by liver biopsy within the previous 6 months, baseline serum HCV-RNA quantified by RT-PCR (Amplicor version 2; Roche) between 68 and 850 KIU, and infection with HCV genotype 2a or 2b. A 24-week regimen of IFN-alpha 2b (6 MU daily for 2 weeks followed by 6 MU thrice weekly for 22 weeks) and ribavirin (a daily dose of 600 mg for body weight < 60 kg or 800 mg for body weight > 61 kg) was given to 17 patients (R+IFN group; 10 men and 7 women with a median age of 50 years (range: 37-69 years) and a median serum HCV-RNA of 410 KIUlml before starting therapy). The other 17 patients (12 men and 5 women with a median age of 50 years (range: 28-70 years) and a median serum HCV-RNA of 370 KlUlml before starting therapy) were treated with a 24-week regimen of consensus IFN (IFN-Con group; 18 MU daily for 2 weeks followed by 18 MU thrice weekly for 22 weeks). HCV-RNA was assessed by a qualitative method (Amplicor version 2; Roche) in serum samples collected in weeks 2,4, and 24, as well as 24 weeks after the end of therapy. Flow cytometric determination of cytoplasmic fFN-gamma and IL-4 expression in peripheral CD4 + T cells was performed, and NK cells were measured in peripheral blood before and 3, 7, and 14 days after the start of therapy. The percentage of IFN-gamma+ and IL-4-(Thl), IFN-gamma-and IL-4+ (Th2), and NK cells was counted by FACS. Results: HCV-RNA was negative in serum specimens after 2,4, and 24 weeks in 6,12, and 14 patients from the R+IFN group, respectively, versus 14, 16, and 14 patients from the IFN-Con group, respectively. A sustained viral response (serum HCV-RNA undetectable at 24 weeks after the end of therapy) was seen in 14 patients (82%) from the R+IFN group and 12 patients (71%) from the IFN-Con group. The percentage of Thl and NK cells peaked on Day 3 and then decreased to near baseline by Day 14, while the percentage of Th2 cells did not change in the R+IFN group. On the other hand, the percentage of Thl cells peaked on Day 14 and the percentage of Th2 cells peaked on Day 3 and then decreased to near baseline by Day 14 in the IFN-Con group. The percentage of NK cells did not change significantly in the IFN-Con group. Conclusions: Our results suggest that ribavirin induces an early immune response by peripheral blood CD4+ T cells and NK cells in CHC patients. This immune response induced by ribavirin might contribute to long-term clearance of HCV-RNA from the serum rather than early clearance. To address the molecular and pharmacokinetic mechanism for enhanced antiviral efficacy associated with pegylated IFN alfa 2b (12kD) and ribavirin. Methods: Serial IFN-stimulated gene (ISG) mRNA expression including PKR, MxA and p56 in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) and HCV dynamics were analyzed using real-time detection PCR in 64 patients infected with HCV genotype lb. Simultaneously, pharmacokinetics of both IFN and ribavirin were analyzed. Patierits were assigned to either \"pegylated\" or \"non-pegylated\" IFN alfa 2b administration group, and both groups received ribavirin for 48 weeks. Results: Sustained viral response (SVR) rate in pegylated and non-pegylated IFN group were 55% and 34%, respectively. In the pegylated IFN group, C, , , of IFN (884 pglml) was found after 12 to 48 h from initial administration, and longer tllz and higher Ch,, were observed (49 h and 190pglml). However, C, , , and AUC estimated from a final dosing were similar to those from an initial dosing (773 pglml and 79 ng hrlml, respectively), suggesting accumulation of IFN was minimal even in pegylated IFN alfa 2b",

In the pegylated IFN group. although peak of ISG's expression was found with a delay of 8 h from administration, the expression from the 2nd day onward were maintained at a significantly higher level (pC0.05). A rapid viral decline (1.9 log) in the 1st phase (24 h) was found in the pegylated IFN group, as observed in the non-pegylated IFN group, in which HCV dynamics demonstrated a biphasic pattern. While, HCV dynamics in the pegylated IFN group was oscinated weekly, for which a decrease of serum IFN concentration was involved. Because of the oscillation, viral decline in the 2nd phase (2 to14 days) was lower in pegylated IFN group. In marked contrast, viral decay in the 3rd phase (from 14-day on) was higher in the pegylated IFN group (0.04 vs. 0.02 loglolday). Viral decline in the 3rd phase, which was found to be significantly related to SVR, was 3-fold higher in SVR than non SVR. Conclusion: Pharmacokinetic improvement by pegylation leads dramatic change in ISG expression pattern. Our data suggests that enhanced clinical effect of pegylated IFN and ribavirin is associated with a higher intracellular expression of ISGs and accumulation of ribavirin concentration in the 3rd phase, in which viral suppression is important for SVR. To date, combination therapy with pegylated interferon alfa (IFN) and ribavirin is the therapy of choice in patients with chronic hepatitis C infection. A sustained virological response (SVR), defined as HCV PCR negativity at the end of therapy and six month later, can be achieved in 42%-52% of patients with genotype 1 infection and in 80% in patients infected with genotype 2 or 3. Nevertheless, little is known about long term maintainence of HCV-PCR negativity. Aim of the study was to evaluate durabilitity of virologic response in patients with SVR to antiviral therapy treated at a single center. Methods: Follow-up data of sustained virologic responders to antiviral therapy treated at the General Hospital Vienna between 1987 and 2002 were obtained. Six of these patients received monotherapy with standard IFN-alfa2a or 2b (RoferonQ , Roche, Basel, CH, IntronAm, AESCA, Traiskirchen, Austria) and 65 standard IFN-alfa in combination with ribavirin. Sixty-one patients were treated with pegylated IFN-alfa2a or PEG-INFalfa2b in combination with ribavirin. Usually, patients are seen at least once yearly at the outpatient clinic. Patients not seen since May 2002 were contacted and asked to come for testing. Qualitative serum HCV RNA was tested by the COBAS AMPLICORQ HCV test, v2.0 (lower detection limit: 50 IUlmL; Roche Diagnostics, Vienna, Austria).",

In particular the ability to tolerate and comply with therapy and to avoid re-infection after completion of therapy needs further study. Methods: Patients attending a drug rehabilitation and naltexone implant clinic (AMPRF) from October 2002 until May 2004 were screened for HCV infection and offered further assessment and treatment. A shared-care model was developed with an AMPRF GP and nurse educator screening patients and providing initial education and testing. A Hepatologist attended the clinic on a fortnightly basis and reviewed patients before a liver biopsy was performed. Treatment was either Rebetron (alpha interferon and ribavirin, n=12) or pegylated interferon and ribavirin (n=15) for 6 months (genotype 2/3) or 12 months (genotypel). Treatment was started and monitored by the GP and nurse educator at the clinic. Viral and host factors influencing sustained viralogical response (SVR, PCR negative 6 months after therapy) were studied. Results: 47 patients had a liver biopsy performed. Metavir fibrosis scores were: 16 with FO, 24 with F1, 4 with F2, and 3 with F3. 20 patients did not meet Australian SlOO biopsy criteria guidelines and were not eligible for government funded therapy. 27 patients have been started on therapy. Only 2 eligible patients were unable to start therapy due to ongoing excessive IDU. HCV genotypes were: 20/47 genotype 1,1/47 genotype 2 and 26/47 genotype 3. End of treatment response (ETR, PCR negative) was 22/26 (85%) and the SVR was 11/16 (69%). Four patients stopped therapy early, 2 for depression and 2 for flu-like symptoms. Only two patients having an ETR re-infected due to unsafe injection practices. 12/25 reported no further IDU, 11/25 occasional or rare IDU and 2/25 regular use of IDU. 16/25 received antidepressant and/or antipsychotic medication. Conclusion: This pilot study of HCV treatment in a shared care naltrexone implant clinic found antiviral therapy resulted in a 69% SVR. This result is comparable to that reported in hospital based clinics in non IDU patients. If further studies confirm these findings HCV antiviral therapy should be offered to this large and currently under treated group.

Patients were divided into 3 groups based on baseline CES-D Score: group 1 with <6, group 2 with 6-15, and group 3 with >15. Antidepressant medications were initiated at the discretion of the clinician with patient concurrence. Results: CES-D scores at initiation of therapy had a mean of 4.6 f 6.1 in females and 5.3 -t 5.6 in males. Group 1 had 29 females and 16 males; Group 2 had 15 females and 5 males; and Group 3 had 4 females and 1 male. Group 1 had 3 start antidepressants at the screening visit, 15 during the first month, 5 in the second or third month, for a total of 21/45 (47%) during HCV therapy. Group 2 had 3 start antidepressants at the screening visit, 6 during the first month, 3 during the second or third month, for a total of 18/20 (90%). In Group 3 all 5 patients started antidepressants at the screening visit. The CES-D scores for treatment weeks 2 through 24 were lower in Group 1 vs. Groups 2 and 3 (pc.005). CES-D scores for weeks 32 to 48 were not different. However, the average CES-D scores during the total treatment were lower in Group 1 vs. Groups 2 and 3 (F=13.7, p<.OOl). Conclusions: Evaluation of depression during treatment revealed that patients who were less depressed (Group 1) at initiation of interferon plus ribavirin therapy had significantly less depression during treatment than those with higher levels of depression at initiation of therapy (Groups 2 and 3). Increased depression in Group 3 occurred despite initiation of antidepressant therapy at the screening visit. Patients with higher CES-D scores prior to HCV therapy developed more severe depression earlier in therapy when compliance with therapy is critical to efficacy. Therefore, consideration should be given to delaying therapy until depression is under control. Close monitoring for depression is important throughout HCV therapy in all groups. Screening for depression prior to interferon plus ribavirin therapy is important in identifying patients at greater risk of depression. Strategies for use of antidepressants and delay of treatment to minimize treatment-related depression in this population needs further study. ",

Results: A total of 111 patients completed therapy. Forty-eight % of patients were of genotype lb. Seventy-two (58%) achieved a SVR. Multivariate analysis of the factors (age, gender, genotype, viral load and IFN dosage) revealed that non-genotype l b (p=O.OOO) and low viral load (p=O.OOO) were independent variables of treatment efficacy. Over a median follow-up of 37 (12-60) months, HCC developed in 10 patients with NR and 5 with SVR. The incidence was significantly higher in patients with NR than that of sustained responders (p=0.0281). Conclusions: These results suggest that successful HCV eradication by using IFN alfa-2b plus ribavirin therapy may decrease the incidence of HCC in patients with HCV-related cirrhosis. Our aim was to examine long term virologic outcome in a group of sustained virologic responders. Methods: We retrospectively identified 147 patients treated at our hospital who had achieved a sustained virological response. We analysed baseline demographics, risk factors for infection, genotypes and treatments received. The durability of virologic response was assessed for all patients. Results: Of 147 patients, 67% were male; 87% Caucasian, 7% Asian and the median age was 39 years. Risk factors included: IVDU (53%); blood transfusion (14%) and tattoo (6%). Genotype was determined in 134 patients: gt 1 (34%); gt 2 (9%); gt 3 (53%); gt 4 (3%) and gt 6 (0.7%). Therapy included 1 treatment course in 122 (84%) patients; 2 in 16 patients (11%); 3 in 7 patients (So/,) and 4 in 1 patient (1%). Treatment consisted of: interferon alone (22%); Peg-interferon alone (2%); interferonl ribavirin (49%) and Peginterferonl ribavirin (27%). Mean duration of therapy was 34 weeks. After a mean follow-up of 119 weeks (range 24-537 weeks) post sustained virologic response, there was no evidence of virologic relapse in 146l147 patients (99%). One patient experienced a virologic relapse at some time between 24-94 weeks after an end of treatment response. Conclusions: Virologic relapse after a sustained virologic response in hepatitis C virus infection is rare. We have shown that, irrespective of genotype and treatment(s) received, the response is maintained up to 10 years with virtually no late relapse. The critical outcome is achieving a sustained response. Virologic follow-up in these patients is of low yield and largely unnecessary. The following authors have indicated they have no relationships to disclose: Lancet (2001) . However, patients with HCV genotype 1 infection have not fared as well. Even with optimum doses of PEG Intron and ribavirin, fewer than 50% of patients achieve a sustained response to treatment. This is a problem of increasing importance since 70% of US. patients with chronic hepatitis C have genotype 1 infection. Patient vovulation and studu desim: 104 previously untreated patients with genotype 1 infection were randomized to receive either either Group 1: PEG-Intron 1.5 mcglkg weekly + ribavirin 12-15 mglkglday for 48 wk or G r o w 2 PEG-Intron 3.0 mcglkg weekly + ribavirin 12-15 mglkglday for 24 wks then PEG-Intron 1.5 mcglkg weekly + ribavirin 12-15 mglkglday for 24 wk. Patients were stratified by the presence or absence of cirrhosis and study region. Treatment was discontinued in patients who had detectable HCV RNA after 24 weeks of therapy. Virological response was defined as absence of detectable HCV RNA by PCR. Results: To date, 49 and 48 patients have been randomized to groups1 and 2 respectively. 70 patients have completed 12 weeks and 36 patients have completed 48 weeks of treatment. Virologic response at week 12 was observed in 72% of patients in group 1 and 82% in group 2. Virological response after 48 weeks of therapy was seen in 65% of patients in group1 and 75% in group 2. 19 patients (13 in group 1 and 6 in group 2) have discontinued therapy due to adverse events or noncompliance. 27% of patients in group 1 and 13% of patients in group 2 have had grade 3 or 4 adverse events. Patient enrollment and follow-up of these patients is ongoing. Conclusions: High dose PEG-Interferon plus weight based ribavirin therapy is tolerated as well as standard doses of PEG-Interferon plus weight based ribavirin. However, there appears to be only a slight increase in efficacy after 12 and 48 weeks of therapy with the higher dose regimen. itself is unknown. This exploratory data analysis describes the correlation between HCV VL and various baseline demographic characteristics of patients enrolled in six pivotal trials for peginterferon a-2a (PEGASYS\") and ribavirin (COPEGUS@).",

HCV RNA VL was measured by Cobas Amplicor HCV Monitor Test, version 2.0 (Roche Diagnostics). The baseline factors evaluated were age, sex, race (white vs black vs other), weight, BMI, hepatic inflammation, hepatic fibrosis. Baseline characteristics were first summarized for each of the three HCV RNA categories as determined by distributions along a continuum: <0.3, 0.3-1.0, and >l.O million copies per mL. Differences in baseline characteristics among the groups were tested using Cochran-Armitage Trend Test. The correlation coefficients were provided along with the p-value for testing R28800@. Results: Statistically significant correlations were detected between baseline HCV RNA VL and age, weight and BMI . However, the strength of these correlations was low, correlation coefficients (R) ranged from 0.16 for age, 0.11 for gender, 0.10 for fibrosis, 0.09 for inflammation, 0.07 for weight, and 0.05 for BMI. Even when all of these factors were incorporated into a linear regression model, less than 10% of the person to person variability in HCV RNA level was explained, R 0.214. Conclusions: HCV RNA levels are higher in persons who are older, male, have more fibrosis and inflammation on biopsy, are heavier and have higher BMI. Nonetheless, most of the person to person differences in HCV RNA levels cannot be explained by sociodemographic and histologic factors. Further research is needed to understand the biologic basis for HCV RNA set points and their role in predicting treatment response. Sustained viral response rates in patients with na'ive CHC treated with Peginterferon alfa-2b (\"PEGINTRON\") and ribavirin have been reported in registration studies to vary from 42% for genotype 1 to 81% for genotypes 2 or 3.

Sustained response rates vary as a function of viral load, genotype, gender, race, duration of treatment and dose of interferon used. The specific mechanisms that determine these differences in response rates observed between individuals that differ for each of these recognized characteristics are not known. Microarray analysis of proteins expressed in matched blood and liver tissue samples of 16 individuals with chronic hepatitis C was preformed.

The microarray data demonstrated that a HCV infection triggers induction of recognized IFN inducible genes in both responders and non-responders. This response is enhanced further in IFN-a treated responders but not in nonresponders. Based upon these data, it can be concluded that: 1.) HCV infection is associated with the expression of IFN inducible proteins, 2.)

Polymyositis has been documented to occur in minority of patients infected with hepatitis C virus infection (HCV). The etiology of HCV related polymyositis in unknown. In addition, interferon therapy of HBV, melanoma and renal cell carcinomas has been reported to cause polymyositis. Interferon is contraindicated in patients with autoimmune diseases and caution is indicated in treating patients with myositis. Myositis occurred in less than 1% of patients in registration studies. We report the development of polmyositis in 9 patients (7 males) treated with combination pegylated interferon and ribavirin therapy for chronic HCV infection. These patients (mean age 2 SD: 48 2 By) were treated with Ribavirin in combination with Pegylated Interferon-a 2b (n=6) or Pegylated Interferon-a 2a (n=3). Eight patients had genotype 1 and 1 had g e n o p 3 HCV infection. Mean pre-treatment HCV RNA was 3 . 5~ 10 IUlml. Polymyositis was suspected in 5 patients with negative viral load after they developed asymptomatic elevations in AST and ALT and subsequently had a CPK checked. Polymyositis was symptomatic in 4 patients with elevation of AST and ALT, 3 of whom had undetectable HCV RNA at presentation. Polymyositis was confirmed by elevations of CPK, aldolase and physical exam in 6 patients, 3 patients had confirmatory muscle biopsy and electromyography. The mean time from start of treatment to diagnosis of polymyositis was 24 weeks (range 5-44weeks). CPK was elevated in all patients with a mean value of 584Ulml. Eight patients completed combination anti-viral tceatment. EVR and SVR was 78% and 67% respectively. One patient discontinued anti-viral therapy at week 5 because of symptoms of polymyositis. Polymyositis resolved in 6 patients. One patient was treated with steroids and azathioprine with resolution and 3 patients have mild residual symptoms not requiring treatment. To our surprise inhibiting the effects of IFNa increased Thl cell development and we find this to be due to an inhibitory effect of IFNa on DC production of IL-12. Studies to define the most potent immunoinhibitory type I IFN are in-progressHence the widely used immunostimulatory type I IFNs can also inhibit the initiation of an immune response and our data suggests that it may be possible to enhance the antiviral properties of these drugs by developing IFNs with enhanced Thl stimulatory effects and reduced effects on IL-12 release.",

There were 33 males, 35 pts were Genotype (G)1, 11 pts G 2 and 14 pts G 3. In order to quallfy, pts must have completed 24 weeks if G2 or C3 or 48 weeks if G1 of either PEG IFN or standard IFN plus ribavirin. Metavir scores were the following: FO (7 pts), Fl (22 pts), F2 (14 pts ), F3 (11 pts) and F4 (6 pts). This trial also examined if any underlying relationship existed between a pts total white blood cell count (WBC) and amino alanine transferase (ALT) levels after cessation of therapy to predict ultimate response or relapse. Results: HCV RNA by PCR taken at 1 and 3 months after completing TX correlated highly with viral loads obtained at 6 months. A total of 13 of the 60 pts (21.6%) with CR relapsed. All of the 3 month HCV RNA measurements were in exact agreement with those taken at 6 months (100% specificity). Only one (G 3) pt who had a CR after 24 weeks of TX became HCV RNA(+) between the 1 and 3 month blood draws (98% specificity). Conclusion: The specificity of the HCV RNA by PCR at 1 and 3 months post HCV TX for pts with a CR is similar to the viral load at 6 months. Based on the results of this data, we feel that SVR can be made with assurance at 3 months post HCV TX. and perhaps as early as 1 month after the end of TX.

Objective: To analyze the financial impact of two different measurement techniques for evaluating the EVR during peginterferon alfa-2b plus ribavirin therapy and to compare the results with the full 48 week course of therapy in genotype 1 naive patients with chronic hepatitis C. Methods: A financial impact model was developed to compare two different strategies of determining EVR and the resultant impact on treatment costs compared with standard 48 weeks course of therapy. Strategy 1: peginterferon alfa-2b plus ribavirin for 12 weeks. Patients with a decline in HCV-RNA >2 logs continue therapy to complete 48 weeks. Strategy 2: peginterferon alfa-2b plus ribavirin for 12 weeks. Patients with HCV Core Ag negative continue therapy to complete 48 weeks. EVR was defined at week 12 as either a decline of >2 logs in HCV RNA levels tested with a quantitative HCV RNA assay (total 2 tests: baseline I weekl2) or undetectable HCV Core Ag at week 12 (1 HCV Core Ag test). Clinical data was taken from multi-center trialsUPlJ, while costs were taken from published literature based on the perspective of the Spanish Health Care System. The basecase scenario assumed that a potential study population of 85,000 people with genotype 1 would be eligible for treatment in Spain. Results: For genotype 1 patients with chronic hepatitis C, testing EVR by HCV Core Ag was the most effective strategy resulting in 58,548 patients reaching SVR and an overall budget of US$1,338 million (USS22,858 per successfully treated patients). Conversely, evaluating EVR by means of quantitative HCV-RNA resulted in 54,094 patients and an investment of US$1,276 million (US$23,589 per successfully treated patient). The incremental cost per successfully treated patient with strategy 2 versus strategy 1 therefore represents US$13,988. Conclusion: Assessment of EVR, specifically by HCV Core Ag test, in genotype 1 chronic hepatitis C patients treated with peginterferon alfa-2b and ribavirin provides an accurate tool for identifying patients with SVR resulting in a lower overall cost. This strategy should be recommended in current clinical practice.

In the next step, we isolated liver cells (hepatocyte, sinusoidal endothelial cell (SEC), Kupffer cell, and hepatic stellate cell (HSC)) from regenerating liver by in situ collagenase perfusion and counterflow elutriation, to determine potential cellular sources of these angiogenic factors after hepatectomy. Proliferation and apoptosis of SECs were also evaluated by proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) staining and the terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase d-uridine triphoshate nick end labeling (TUNEL) assay, respectively. Results: VEGF mRNA expression was increased with a peak at 72 h after hepatectomy, decreasing thereafter. The expression of Ang-1 mRNA was present at detectable levels before hepatectomy and was increased slowly with a peak at 96 h. Meanwhile, Ang-2 mRNA was hardly detected before hepatectomy, but was remarkably induced at 120 h and 144 h. In isolated cells, VEGF mRNA expression was found mainly in the hepatocyte fraction. Meanwhile, mRNA for Ang-1 and Ang-2 was found in the SEC and HSC fractions, but was more prominent in the latter. The PCNA labeling index of SECs increased slowly, reaching a peak at 72 h, whereas apoptotic SECs were detected between 120 h and 144 h. Conclusions: VEGF secreted by hepatocytes may play a key role in SEC proliferation, followed by increased Ang-1, presumably promoting sinusoidal maturation. Thereafter, Ang-2 mainly released from HSCs in the absence of VEGF may contribute to apoptosis of superfluous SECs for cessation of the regenerative process. In conclusion, Ang-Tie system, together with VEGF, plays a critical role in regulating balance between SEC proliferation and apoptosis during sinusoidal regeneration after hepatectomy. However, the VEGF system plays a more important role in the early phase of sinusoidal regeneration, whereas angiopoietinlTie system does subsequently to the action of VEGF. ",

There was a significant increase in tissue necrosis following initial injury that was greater in normal liver than tumor tissue. In normal liver, the peak volume of necrosis was 137.4 (9.8) mm3 and occurred at 3 days, while in tumor tissue the peak was 49.0(3.5) mm3 at 4.5 days (P < 0.001). Increased apoptotic response was noted at 12 hours following injury and remained elevated until 72 hours in tumor tissue. HSP 70 expression with focal hyperthermia was most pronounced in tumor tissue and remained elevated for 72 hours. Increased Kupffer cell activity was more noticeable in normal liver than in tumor. Increased hepatocyte and tumor proliferation was first noted between 48 and 72 hours following focal hyperthermia injury. Progressive microvascular injury was observed following focal hyperthermia application and was greater in normal liver. Conclusion: Focal hyperthermia produces an initial direct lethal thermal injury, followed by a second phase that involves a progression of injury beyond the initial thermal effects. Normal liver and tumor tissue respond differently to focal hyperthermia. In tumor tissue the direct injury is more pronounced, while the progression of injury is more rapid and extensive in normal liver. Alterations in apoptosis, heat shock protein expression, Kupffer cell activity and microvascular injury appear to be important in this progressive tissue injury response.

            "text": "Conclusion: Our data suggests that HCV(+) graft recipients from older donors (150) have higher death rates, graft failures, and more extensive fibrosis post-LT than HCV(-) graft recipients from older donors. Furthermore, we demonstrate that all HCV( +) graft recipients, regardless of donor age, have more advanced fibrosis and thus, worse histological outcomes post-LT, than HCV(-) graft recipients. Historically, liver biopsy has proven reproducibility and reliability to diagnose acute rejection (AR) after liver transplantation (LTx). We hypothesized that the context of recurrent hepatitis C (R-HCV) would significantly erode the diagnostic reliability of liver biopsy for AR. Methods: Two LTx pathologists (PI and P2) from two large volume centers reviewed four sets of blinded slides representing 88 liver biopsies, all of which carried historical diagnoses of mild or moderate AR, R-HCV, or both. Pathologists were informed that all biopsies were obtained between 4 weeks and 6 months after transplantation and given blinded sets, labeled by the transplant era (1993-1994 = 50 biopsies or 2000-2001 = 38 biopsies) and the recipients' HCV status (HCV+ = 38 biopsies and HCV-recipients = 50 biopsies). Readings were transcribed into a database and, after a hiatus of one month or more, each pathologist was asked to score hislher blinded readings for the diagnosis of AR using the following scale: 1 =Unlikely; 2=Possible; 3=Probably; 4=Likely. An experienced clinician (C) also scored blinded printouts of the current readings of both pathologists and of historical readings. The C's scores were then used to compare current interrater agreement and agreement between current versus historical diagnoses. Agreement was assessed by determining frequencies of relative (difference 5 1) and exact agreement (RelAg and ExAg, respectively) and by weighted kappa statistics (wK). Results: C was an excellent interpreter of both P1 and P2 (WK P1 = 0.92; W K P2 = 0.90) ( Presumably, histologic features of recurrent HCV which overlap with those of AR compromises the ability of even highly experienced LTx pathologists to make the diagnosis. If increased intensity of immunosuppression is associated with accelerated posttransplant HCV progression, our results suggest that a decision to treat AR based upon biopsy results alone may be ill-advised. Backaound It has been showed that HCV quasispecies in patients who receive a orthotropic liver transplantation (OLT) is more homogeneous with respect to control patients (1). The fibrosis outcome and relapse severity could be determinated by the quasispecies distribution after OLT.",

HCV quasispecies diversity was analysed in the hypervariable region 1 (HVRl) of the viral genome and assessed by RT-PCR, cloning and sequencing in pretransplantation and posttransplantation serum samples. MEGAZ(2) and SPSS were used to analize the data obtained. Results: There were not statistically differences in the groups when HVRl nonsynonymous substitutions were compared between pretranspalnt and posttranplant serum samples (p=0.39 in gmup I, p=0.062 in group 11). Neither, significant differences were observed when pretransplant serum samples were compared between group I and II (0.06620.051 vs 0.060?0.050, respectively; p=0.82).

Topical testosterone replacement (lTR) has been shown to effectively improve muscle mass and overall well being in patients with HIV. &:Determine if ?TR could improve muscle mass, well being and survival in patients post liver transplant with impending allograft loss due to recurrent HCV. Methods: A retrospective review of patients treated for at least 6 months from January 2000 to October 2003 with testosterone gel 1% (5 grams per day) therapy for muscle wasting (MW) (Group 1). Pre and post treatment albumin, pre-albumin, transferrin, testosterone (free and total), estrogen and luteal hormone (LH) were performed. Drug safety analysis included frequency of acute rejection, cholestasis, malignancy, patient andlor graft loss. Group 2 consisted of patients not treated with testosterone with a similar clinical setting during the same time frame. Results: 14 patients were identified with stage 3 or 4 fibrosis and MW and allograft failure due to recurrent HCV. Group 1 (n=9) included 6 males & 3 females, mean age 51 years. Group 2 (n=5) included 3 males & 2 female, mean age 53 years. Group 1 9/9 pts had subjective improvement in muscle strength, and overall well being.

Purpose: To identify factors predictive of 24 week viral response to PEG IFN alfa-2b plus ribavirin in the post transplant patient with recurrent hepatitis C. Methods: This multi-center randomized clinical trial of OLT patients with histologic recurrent HCV started with PEG IFN alfa-2b 0.5 mcglkglweek plus ribavirin 600 mglday. At week 4, patients tolerating therapy were increased to ribavirin 800 mglday and according to baseline randomization either remained at 0.5 mcgl kglwk (low dose arm) or increased to 1.5 mcglkglweek (high dose arm).

            "text": "Introduction and aim. Early progression to fibrosis is observed in many patients with recurrent hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection after liver transplantation (OLT). It has been suggested that, in immunocompetent patients with hepatitis C, obesity leads to more rapid fibrotic changes in the liver. Overweight and obesity are frequent and early complications of OLT; thus, the aim of this study was to verify the impact of excess weight gain after OLT in relationship to the course of recurrent HCV. Methods. Eighty consecutive patients (54 males; median age 54 years, range 23-67) were studied; minimum follow-up after OLT was 2 years. Forty-eight patients were HCV positive: 27 of them received antiviral treatment with interferon plus ribavirin, started a median of 404 days after OLT. In the remaining 32 patients, disease etiologies were: hepatitis B (N. = 12), alcohol (N. = lo), autoimmune or cholestatic liver disease (N. = 10). The speed of fibrosis development, expressed in fibrosis units per month (FUI mo), was calculated dividing the staging score at the last follow-up liver biopsy (find staging score), by the time interval (median 28 months, range 3-74) elapsed after OLT. Body mass index (BMI) values were calculated one and two years after OLT; the ratio of triglyceride to cholesterol serum levels (TCR) was calculated one year after OLT. Results. Median (751h percentile) BMI values were 25.5 (27.5) kg/m2 and 26.0 (28.5) kg/m2, at one and two years, respectively. The median final staging score was 1 (range 0-6), the median speed of fibrosis development was 0.05 FUlmo (range 0-1.25); however, 16 patients reached a final staging score >2 (of them, 11 belonged to the HCV group). Earlier recurrent hepatitis C (within 180 days after OLT) was associated with a BMI C27.5 kglm2 one year post OLT (25/28 Vs 13/20; p <0.05) and with TCR > L O (11/28 Vs 1/20; p <0.01). In HCV positive patients, a speed of fibrosis development = 0.10 FUlmo or lower was significantly more common when donor age was = 45 years or younger (23/36 Vs 3/12; p<0.02), and recipient BMI two years post-OLT was 28.5 kglm2 or higher (12/36 Vs 0/12; p<0.05). Time to event analysis showed that a low BMI value at 1 year was associated with shorter time to reach a staging score >2 in HCV positive patients (p<0.05) but not in HCV negative patients (p = NS). Conclusions. In the first years post-OLT, fibrosis progression of recurrent HCV is not hastened by post-OLT excess weight gain; on the contrary, grafts of overweight and obese HCV recipients undergo less fibrotic deposition, possibly due to later hepatitis recurrence. Since HCV adsorption is known to be inhibited by low density lipoproteins, the metabolic profile associated with overweight might interfere with HCV binding and entry into the hepatocytes. ",

However-,outcome of HCV-disease in OLT recipients has marked individual variations and remains mostly unpredictable. Goals: to investigate the natural history of recurrent HCV infection and identify variables associated with the severity of allograft injury. Methods: The study included 53 consecutive patients with noncholestatic HCV-recurrence and at least 1 year of follow up.Liver biopsies were performed by protocol every 6-12 months and when clinically indicated.The METAVIR score was used for grading and staging.Severe recurrence was defined as fibrosis >F2 at 1 year or 2F3 at 3 years of 0LT.Statistical tests included Kaplan-Meier and univariate and multivariate analysis by logistic regression.Variables studied included donor and recipients demographics, source of HCV infection, metabolic conditions, OLT for HCC, alcohol history, severity of illness, type of donor, pre-and post-OLT virologic factors, ischemia times, type and intensity of immunosuppression, incidence of cellular rejection and time to recurrence.Results: A total of 206 biopsies where obtained (422 per patient).Actuarial risk of histological chronic hepatitis was 67.5% at 1 year, 87.5% at 3 years and 90% at 6 years of 0LT.Activity grade increased from 1.4?0.9 at 1 year to 2.320.9 at 6 years.Actuanal risk of fibrosis at 1 and 6 years was 14%/70% for F2,8%/46% for F3 and O%/l8% for F4.Mean fibrosis score increased from 1.2 at 1 year to 1.8 and 2.2 at 3 and 6 years respective1y.HCV-recurrence was diagnosed as mild in 27 patients (51%) and severe in 26 (49%). Donor age (mild8421 years, severe:43?12 years) was the only variable significantly associated (p=O.Ol) with the severity of recurrence on univariate analysis, even after exclusion of living donors. Independent predictors of severe recurrence (Cox&Snell R2=0.427) were donor age (OR1.11, p=0.004), immunosuppression with cyclosporine (mild 19%, severe: 81%;Ok 25.7, p=0.003), and OLT for HCC (mild:35%, severe: 65%; OR14.07, p=O.Ol).Conclusions: 1) Assessment of HCV recurrence with protocol biopsies showed that 6 years after OLT chronic hepatits is almost universal and that the majority of patients have fibrosis2F2; 2) In agreement with previous reports, this study showed that donor age is an independent predictor of severe disease.ln contrast, our study did not show a significant association regarding others variables considered to be predictors of severe HCV-disease such as pre-OLT viremia, number of treated rejections, or intensity of immunosupression; 3) Further studies are required to confirm whether use of cyclosporine and OLT for HCC have a negative impact on HCV recurrence The following authors have indicated they have no relationships to disclose: We initiated a randomized study of pegylated interferon alfa2b with or without ribavirin among liver transplant recipients with recurrent hepatitis C who were at least 3 months post-transplantation. The aim of our current analysis was to determine the reasons for screening failure among study candidates. Methods: Liver recipients who attended the transplant clinic were screened for the Treatment of Recurrent C Hepatitis (TORCH) study. We analyzed the study database for failure of fulfillment of the individual inclusion and exclusion criteria. The study had 17 inclusion and 17 exclusion criteria that included age, biochemical, virologic and histologic features, and conditions that could compromise graft or patient survival. Results: Among 244 patients screened, 18 (7%) were enrolled. The most frequently failed criteria are depicted in the Table. Prior post-transplant treatment with interferon, low blood counts and elevated serum creatinine were the most frequent reasons for screening failure. Among 226 patients who failed screening, two patients did not fulfill seven criteria, nine failed six criteria, and seven failed five criteria. Seventy-five (33%) patients failed to fulfill at least three criteria whereas 142 (63%) failed to fulfill at least two criteria. The mean interval between transplantation and screening in patients who received prior interferon treatment was 51 months compared to 25 months among those who had not received prior interferon therapy (p=ns). Thirty-nine of the 149 patients (26%) who had not been on interferon prior to screening received interferon subsequently, during a mean follow up of 12 months. Thus, 116 of the 226 (51%) patients who failed screening received interferon outside the study protocol. Conclusions: Liver transplant recipients who are at least 3 months post-transplantation continue to have sub-optimal laboratory values that compromise their enrollment in interferon based treatment studies. Many such patients receive treatment outside study protocols. Further liberalization of enrollment criteria is needed in this population to ensure adequate recruitment. This study was funded in part by Integrated Therapeutics Research, New Jersey. Introduction: Cholestatic Hepatitis C (CHC), a severe variant of recurrent HCV following transplantation is defined as persistent serum total bilirubin elevation greater than lOmgldl in the absence of extrahepatic biliary obstruction, with histologic findings of portal expansion and ductular proliferation. It is our hypothesis that HCV recurrence with identical clinical and similar histologic findings to CHC occurs in the presence of extra-hepatic biliary obstruction (EBO) and is associated with poor outcomes. The incidence and natural history of this phenomenon remains incompletely described. Methods: We performed a retrospective analysis of all 102 (71 DD and 31 LD) HCV infected patients transplanted at our center between 7/99 and 12/03. All patients with cholestasis post transplantation underwent ultrasound, CT or MRCP, ERCP or PTC, and liver biopsy. ERCP or PTC were used to treat identifiable extrahepatic biliary obstruction (EBO) defined as any anastomotic or ampullary stricture. CHC in patients with and without EBO was defined as a total bilirubin greater than IOmgldl, with liver biopsy evidence of cholestasis, portal expansion and ductular proliferation. Patients with CHC and EBO were compared to CHC without EBO. Results: The overall incidence of CHC was l6%, 11% in DD and 26% in LD ( p = 0.05). The incidence of CHC with and without EBO was not different, and the rate of EBO was not different when comparing DD to LD. However, a greater number of LD developed CHC without EBO. Three year patient survival was significantly lower in CHC with EBO in comparison to CHC without EBO, potentially explained by a delay in initiating anti-HCV directed therapy while treating biliary obstruction. Conclusions: 1) Biliary obstruction in the setting of hep C may create a synergistic effect which becomes irreversible despite treatment of the obstruction. 2) Evaluation for Extra-hepatic biliary obstruction (EBO) should occur when liver biopsy reveals cholestatic hepatitis C. 3) HCV directed therapy should be initiated concurrently or prior to attempting to relieve biliary obstruction.",

However, in 8 patients fibrosis score 53 (portal fibrosis only) there was a HVPG 2 6 mmHg, and in 3 patients all with fibrosis score of 5, HVPG was 5 4 mmHg. In paired biopsies fibrosis score and HVPG increased over time (both p<0.008). Overall, time interval from transplant was not correlated with height of portal pressure, reflecting that not all patients developed significant fibrosis. Conclusions: HVPG correlates with the progression of fibrosis but not with the grade of inflammation, after liver transplantation for HCV cirrhosis. There are some anomalies between degree of fibrosis and HVPG, which may be due to histological sampling. These need to be followed prospectively. HVPG may provide a reliable prognostic parameter and add another index of histological progression for recurrent HCV infection. This could be applied to the non transplant setting. MN We recently showed that fibrocystin (FC), the protein product of PKHDl, the gene mutated in autosomal recessive polycystic kidney disease (ARPKD), is normally expressed in cilia of cholangiocytes. Moreover, we found that the formation of liver cysts in the PCK rat (a rodent model of ARPKD resulting from a mutation in Pkhdl) is associated with morphological abnormalities of cholangiocyte cilia and in the absence of cilia expression of FC (Gastroenterology 2003) . Nevertheless, the relationships among mutations in FC, malformed cholangiocyte cilia, alterations in the topography of FC in cholangiocytes, and hepatic cystogenesis remain unclear. To continue to clarify these relationships, our AIMS were to: (i) develop an in mtro model of cholangiocyte ciliogenesis; and (ii) assess FC expression and intracellular topography during ciliogenesis in this model. Methods: The morphology of cholangiocyte cilia, ciliary length and the number of cells with cilia were examined by confocal, scanning, and transmission electron microscopy in sub-confluent and post-confluent (days 0, 3,5,7,14 and 21) monolayers of normal rat cholangiocytes (NRCs). The expression of FC and the levels of Pkhdl mRNA were analyzed by confocal and immunoelectron microscopy and western blotting, and by RT-PCR, respectively. Results: In sub-confluent monolayers of NRCs, cilia were absent and FC was localized to the cytoplasm. Short cilium (1.2 pm) appeared in -10% of cells at day 3 post-confluence and grew progressively by 0.6 pmlday to a length of 12 pm by day 14. The number of cells possessing cilia increased from 10% (day 3) to 97% (day 14-21). As cilia formed, FC redistributed from the cytoplasm to newly formed cilia. Conclusions: We developed an in vitro model of ciliogenesis in immortalized, nonmalignant normal rat cholangiocytes. Using this model, we observed that: (i) after confluence, cilia progressively develop at the apical domain of cultured cholangiocytes; (5) the intracellular topography of FC changes during ciliogenesis; and (iii) the development of cilia is associated with a redistribution of FC from the cytoplasm to cilia. Our novel model system will allow further clarification of the relationships among FC expression and intracellular topography, ciliogenesis, and ultimately, cholangiocyte cyst formation. were isolated from normal mice and from CFTR-KO mice (CftrtmlUnc) that lack of CFlT, a CAMP-stimulated CI-channels that mediates secretin-stimulated C1-secretion in bile duct epithelium and is defective in Cystic Fibrosis. Fluid secretion was assessed by videoptical planimetry as changes in luminal areas induced by acute administration of UDCA. lntracellular levels of CAMP were mea-sured by radio-immunoassay and expression and membrane translocation of PKC isoforms was assessed by westem blot. Results: UDCA stimulates fluid secretion in IBDU from normal mice in a dose-dependent way (from 0.005 to 1 mM), reaching the maximum effect at the concentration of 0.5 mM (45% increase in fluid secretion vs unstimulated IBDU). The secretory effect was more evident in the presence of HC03-in the perfusion medium. UDCA was unable to stimulate secretion in IBDU isolated from CFTR-KO mice, suggesting that UDCA-stimulated secretory events depend on CFTR activity. UDCA-stimulated fluid secretion was inhibited by PKA inhibitors (H89,lOpM) but UDCA pretreatment did not increased the intracellular levels of CAMP in mice IBDU. Effects of UDCA were blocked by PKC inhibitors (Ro 31-8220 (1pM) and Go 6976 (IpM)) consistent with the known regulatory effects of PKC on PKA-mediated stimulation of C F R In fact, UDCA, a known stimulator of PKC in hepatocytes, induced a clear translocation of PKC-a and PKC-c to the plasma membrane.",

More recently, EBP50 has been shown to be phosphoylated by cdc2 kinase during mitosis and to interact with P-catenin, a nuclear regulatory factor directly linked to specific carcinomas. The present study investigated the effect of EBP50 abundance on cell proliferation. Methods: Human biliary carcinoma cell line (Mz-ChA-1) was stably transfected with a plasmid vector encoding the small interfering RNA (siRNA) of human EBP50 or with an empty vector. EBP50 mRNA and protein were quantified by real time RT-PCR and western blotting, respectively. Phenotype alterations were analyzed by conventional light microscopy. Cell proliferation was measured by incorporation of 5-bromo-2'-deoxyuridine (BrDU) into DNA. Results: Constitutive expression of EBP5O siRNA reduced both mRNA (30 70 of control) and protein (90 YO of control) in comparison with the biliary carcinoma cell line transfected with the empty vector.

Moreover, an increase in cell adhesion to the substratum and a decrease in cell-cell adhesion were identified. Conclusions: In biliary carcinoma cells, loss of EBP5O expression inhibited proliferation and cell-cell interaction. EBP50 represents a potential target of anticancer therapy, as its inhibition may decrease the proliferative and invasive properties of carcinoma cells. role for CCR signaling in CXCR3 CK secretion. Anti-CXCR3 decreased CXCR3 CKs more than either inhibitor of CCRL3.5, but less effectively cross-inhibited CCW. A combination of Met-RANTES+anti-CXCR3 was not more effective in cross-inhibiting than Met-RANTES alone. Conclusions: These results indicate that autocrinelparacrine signaling by CRs expressed on cholangiocytes directly controls the quantities of CKs secreted in response to IFNy+TNFa. Treatment with Met-RANTES alone or Met-RANTES+Anti-CXCR3 at the time of bone marrow or liver transplantation should inhibit autocrinelparacrine signaling through cholangiocyte CCRl,3,5 and CXCR3, substantially reducing peribiliary CK gradients. However, a combination of Met-RANTES+Anti-CXCW would most likely be required to block CCR-and CXCW-dependent chemotaxis of activated effector T cells to bile ducts. Therapeutic inhibition of CRs could abort the immunopathogenesis of NSDC and lead to elimination of effector T cells due to death by neglect. Chronically diseased human liver contains numerous atypical [regenerative] biliary ductular structures the origin of which is uncertain. The BEC of these dudules express markers of immaturity such as neural cell adhesion molecule (NCAM). We hypothesised that these immature ductules fail to progress to functionally and phenotypically mature ducts in vivo because of influence in the cirrhotic microenvironment. Here we determined the ability of immature (NCAM +ve) cells to mature following removal from the cirrhotic environment and culture in a 3-dimensional (3-D) collagen matrix. Methods. Mature and immature BEC were purified from livers of patients with chronic livers diseases (n=6, Primary Biliary Cirrhosis n=3 l Alcoholic Liver Disease n=3) by sequential imunomagnetic separation with HEA125 and NCAM (mature BEC = HEA125+ve I NCAM -ve, immature BEC = HEA125+ve I NCAM +ve). The purified cells were cultured in 3-D collagen matrix for 2-4 weeks in serum free, William's medium in the presence I absence of epidermal growth factor (EGF) l hepatocyte growth factor (HGF) or as monolayers. Cells were analysed for growth responses (PCNA) and for morphological (lumen l duct formations) and phenotypic maturation (CK-19, NCAM, E-cadherin) by PCR. Normal BEC from a donor liver were used as a control. Results. In the absence of added growth promoters both mature and immature BEC formed duct-like structures in 3-D collagen matrix that showed circular cross sectional profile, polarised epithelium and well-defined lumena. In the absence of added growth promoters mature BEC proliferated less than immature cells but both mature and immature BEC proliferated in response to EGF and HGF. HGF induced a well-ordered branching morphogenesis while EGF induced a disordered branching morphogenesis. NCAM was detected in BEC cultured as monolayers but could not be detected following culture of immature BEC for 2 weeks in 3-D collagen matrix. E-cadherin was present in both mature and immature BEC, both in monolayer and 3-D collagen culture but its expression was enhanced in cells stimulated with EGF. HEA125 +ve I NCAM -ve cells from the normal liver failed to express NCAM in collagen gel culture but NCAM was induced on normal BEC cultured as monolayers. Conclusions. Immature BEC from livers of patients with chronic liver disorders spontaneously mature following removal from the cirrhotic environment and maintenance in 3-D collagen matrix. EGF and HGF are potent mitogens and morphogens for mature and immature BEC. EGF enhances expression of E-cadherin by BEC. Cholangiocarcinoma is a tumor of intra-and extra-hepatic bile ducts that is of increasing concern due to its greater frequency and grave prognosis. Ca2+lPKC-dependent signaling regulates cholangiocyte proliferationlloss in response to gastrin and ursodeoxycholate. Gastrin inhibits hyperplastic and neoplastic cholangiocyte proliferation by increasing apoptosis. The D2 dopaminergic receptor agonist, quinelorane, inhibits secretin-stimulated ductal secretion (a marker of cholangiocyte proliferation) through Caz+-dependent activation of PKCy. However, no information exists regarding the role and mechanisms of action of dopaminergic receptor agonists in the regulation of cholangiocarcinoma growth. Aims: (i) To evaluate the expression of D2 dopaminergic receptors in cholangiocarcinoma and quinelorane effects on cholangiocarcinoma growth; (ii) To determine the intracellular events involved in the modulation of cholangiocarcinoma proliferation by quinelorane; and (iii) To determine if quineloraneinduced inhibition of cell proliferation is coupled with increased caspase 3-mediated cell apoptosis. Methods: We determined the expression of D2 dopaminergic receptors in the cholangiocarcinoma cell line Mz-ChA-1 (from human gallbladder). Quinelorane dose-and time-dependent effects on the regulation of cholangiocarcinoma growth were studied by stimulating Mz-ChA-1 cells with increasing doses of quinelorane (10 FM-100 pM) from 24 to 72 hours. The effect of quinelorane (25 pM) on intracellular IP3 and Ca2+ levels was evaluated in Mz-ChA-1 cells. Quinelorane (25 pM, for 24 hours) effect was assessed in the absence or presence of the intracellular Ca2+ chelator, BAPTAIAM. PKCy membranetranslocation (the isoform previously shown to be activated in hyperplastic cholangiocytes by quinelorane) was evaluated. The time course of caspase 3 activation by quinelorane was assessed. Results: Mz-ChA-1 cells express the D2 dopaminergic receptor. Quinelorane inhibited Mz-ChA-1 growth in a dose-dependent fashion (10 pM-100 pM). The inhibitory effect persisted up to 72 hours. Quinelorane increased IP3 and Ca2+ levels. Quinelorane inhibition of cholangiocarcinoma growth was blocked by BAPTAIAM and was associated with increased PKCy membranetranslocation. Quinelorane increased early caspase 3 activity. SummarylConcZusion: The dopaminergic system down-regulates cholangiocarcinoma growth by inhibiting cell proliferation (via a Ca2+-mediated activation of PKCy ) and by increasing caspase 3-mediated apoptosis. Regulation of apoptosis through the D2 dopaminergic receptor may provide a therapeutic option for the treatment of cholangiocarcinoma. The following authors have indicated they have no relationships to disclose: Silvia Taffetani and is associated with biliary dysgenesis characterized by congenital hepatic fibrosis, intrahepatic bile duct dilatation and cyst development. Several animal models of ARPKD have provided insights into pathogenesis of this disease; one of them, the PCK rat is characterized by a spontaneous splicing mutation (IVS35-2A+T) in the orthologous Pkhdl gene, and biliary cystogenesis. Recently, we showed that PCK rats have malformed cholangiocyte cilia and absence of fibrocystin (FC), the protein product of Pkhdl, in cholangiocyte cilia (Gastroenterology 2003) . In addition, we developed a novel rodent model of ARPKDa FC knockout mouse (FC KO)by replacing exon 2 of Pkhdl with a PGK-neo cassette. The AIM of this study was to characterize the biliary phenotype in FC KO mice. Methods: Liver lesions in FC KO mice were assessed by immunochistochemistry (IHC), confocal, scanning (SEM) and transmission electron (TEM) microscopy, Weste m blot and RT-PCR. Results: FC KO mice exhibited liver (100% of mice) and pancreatic (25% of mice) cysts; surprisingly, no kidney phenotype was observed. Liver weights as a proportion of body weight increased with age, and the livers of older mice were characterized grossly by clear fluid-filled cysts. Microscopically, liver lesions were seen in first postnatal week; with age, the number and size of hepatic cysts surrounded by mild fibrous tissue progressively increased. Cells lining cysts were positive for CK-7 suggesting that they originated from bile ducts. By SEM and TEM, cilia in liver cysts of FC KO were shorter by -50% compared to wild type mice. Western blot, IHC and confocal microscopy showed that FC is still expressed in cholangiocytes of FC KO mice suggesting that conditional knockout did not eliminate all spliced forms of FC. Conclusion: The FC KO mouse is characterized by progressive hepatic cystogenesis that resembles the biliary phenotype in human ARPKD. This new model will allow further clarification of the mechanisms of biliary cystogenesis, and assessment of treatment options of inherited polycystic liver disease.

Medications were administered for 24 WKS (HCV GT 2l3) or 48 WKS (HCV GT 1). Tolerability (side effect profile and drop out rate) was determined.Preliminary ETR and SVR data are reported. Results: 281 patients have been enrolled and received at least one dose of medication. 272 patients (141 in LD and 131 in the SD) have received the medications for at least 48 WKS. 911141 (65%) in LD are GTl in comparison to 1021131 (78%) in SD.

There is no difference in adverse events in LD (159) in comparison to SD (168). Conclusion: 1) PEG-IFN a2b (1.0 mcglkglwk) + ribavirin are equally as effective as PEG-IFN a2b (1.5 mcglkglwk) + ribavirin in regards to ETR and SVR. This is true in GT 1 and GT non-1 patients. 2) Medication discontinuations were equal between the two groups.

Overall, Fibrotest had good specificity and adequate sensitivity, while APRI had excellent specificity but poor sensitivity and Foms score had good specificity and intermediate sensitivity. As to PPV, the most important parameter for practical use of these methods, Fibrotest correctly classified around 2/3 of cases in all fibrosis subgroups, while APRI had 100% PPV for advanced fibrosis when >1.5 and Foms score had high PPV for advanced fibrosis when > 6.9 while was in our cases rather inadequate to predict minimal fibrosis using the cut off value C4.2. The % of cases that could be classified by APRI and Foms score was quite low in our series, being a limitation compared to Fibrotest. In conclusion, all the 3 methods have limitations in their ability to predict liver fibrosis. APRI reached the highest PFV but classified the lowest number of cases. Combination of the 3 tests might provide better prediction in the individual case. Plasma Albuferon concentrations were measured by ELISA. HCV RNA was measured using the Amplicor HCV kit (Roche). Gene expression in whole blood was measured using cDNA arrays or semi-quantitative TaqMan PCR. Results: Demographics: 114 subjects in 21 cohorts (93% HCV genotype 1) were enrolled. Mean duration of prior therapy-68 wks. Safety: Albuferon was well tolerated with no discontinuations. Adverse events were transient, and most were mild to moderate. Most common adverse events Trial ALBUFERONTM-A NOVEL THERAPEUTIC AGENT FOR model is a major obstacle in understanding the disease. To address this issue, we developed a mouse model using adenovirusmediated expression of HCV protease in the liver. HCV NS3WA protease was fused to the secreted placental alkaline phosphatase (SEAP) with the NS4A.4B junction and cloned into a replication defective adenovirus vector. A mutant NS3 protease with a Serl39Ala mutation in the active site of the protease fused to SEAP was used as negative control. Intravenous injection of mice with adenovirus encoding HCV protease-SEAP resulted in the expression of the HCV protease in the liver, and protease-dependent SEAP secretion in the blood. There was a 30-to 40 fold increase in SEAP secretion in the serum of wild type compared to mutant HCV protease expressing mice. Dose-dependent steatosis as detected by O i l Red 0 staining was observed in the liver of mice expressing wild type HCV protease. Elevated serum transaminase levels were also observed in mice expressing WT HCV protease. In contrast, mice expressing either mutant HCV protease or the SEAP reporter alone as controls showed minimal From a panel of HCV HMAbs to E2, two antibodies, HCV-A868 and HCV-AB65, recognizing different epitopes, were selected and assessed for their binding characteristics, viral neutralization in an HCV cell culture system and in a small animal model for HCV infection (HCV TrimeraTM Model).

Results: Nod2 mRNA and protein were strongly expressed in human and murine liver mainly in hepatocytes and Kupffer cells. Nod2 mRNA hepatic levels were significantly enhanced in alcoholic hepatitis, in ConAnofluorescence. In vitro, TNFa and IFNy induced a synergistic, dose-and time-dependent up-regulation of Nod2 expression in HepG2. Overexpression of Nod2 in HepG2 induced a 5 fold NFKB activation. At the basic state, we observed a significant decrease of TNFa mRNA levels in liver of Nod2 ko mice. In ConA-induced hepatitis, Nod2 ko mice disclosed a 36 and 45% decrease in serum ALT and AST levels and fewer necrotic areas than wild type mice. Conclusion: Nod2 is expressed in the liver. Its expression is regulated by inflammatory cytokines and enhanced during liver inflammation. Overexpression of Nod2 activates NFKB in hepatocytes. Nod2 ko mice seem to be less susceptible to ConAinduced hepatitis. Taken together, these results suggest that Nod2 may play a role in TNFa-mediated liver injuries. As one the strongest differentially IL6Igpl301STAT up-regulated factors we evaluated SAA2. Therapy with recombinant SAA leads to significantly reduced AST-levels during ConA hepatitis. Additional we found that the neutrophil regulating chemokine KC is strictly IL6Igp130ISTAT3 dependend. Analysis of protein expression by ELISA for mouse KC c o n h e d the STAT3 dependence of the hepatic KC expression. To evaluate the in vivo relevance of KC expression we analysed the effects of IL6 therapy on neutophil activation in the ConA hepatitis. Indeed IL6 therapy leads to a significant reduction of Polymorph-nuclear-Cell infiltration in the liver during ConA hepatitis. Our study show, that the gp130I STAT3 signalling in hepatocytes which is the causal arm of the IL6 induced liver protection trigger the expression of protective genes. The gpl30ISTAT up-regulated proteins SAA2 and KC are mediators of this IL6 triggered mechanisms.

While HCV infection has also been causally linked to ML and MM, cases with both HCC and ML or MM are rare. There are no detailed reports on these potential associations. This study was designed to analyze the clinical features of HCC with ML or MM and to clarify the etiologies of these malignancies in relation to HCV. Methods: Clinical background factors of 38 HCC cases with ML or MM (5 cases from our department and 33 from the Japanese literature) were compared with those of 593 HCC cases without hematological diseases, serving as a control group. All patients presented during the ten year period from 1993 through 2002. The 38 HCC cases were divided into two groups (with ML; 31 cases and with MM; 7 cases) and their clinical features were compared. We also assessed the timing of onset of HCC in relation to that of ML or MM. Result: 1) There were no differences in clinical background factors such as age, gender, HCV positive rate and presence of cirrhosis between the 38 HCC cases with ML or MM and the control group.2) The comparison between HCC with ML and HCC with MM revealed differences in the HCV positive rate; 84% (26/31) and 43% (3/7), respectively, and in presence of cirrhosis; 84% (26/31) and 43% (3/7), respectively (pc0.05). The results for the HCC with ML cases were essentially the same as those of the control group (HCV positive rate; 75% and presence of cirrhosis; 77%), while the rates of HCV positivity and cirrhosis were low in HCC with MM (p<0.05). 3). Four HCC cases with MM were negative for both HBV and HCV, and did not have cirrhosis. Among these four, there were 3 metachronous cases in which HCC was detected during a relatively short period (30-48 months) after intensive chemotherapy of MM. Conclusion: Marked clinical differences were seen between HCC with ML versus with MM. The etiology of HCC with MM appears to be less related to HCV infection, strongly implicating chemotherapy use in some cases.The following authors have indicated they have no relationships to disclose: Michiyo Chiba, Akiko Saito, Yoko Yoshioka, Ikuko Haruta, Katsutoshi Tokushige, Hikaru Nagahara, Hiroaki Okuda, Keiko Shiratori 326 CLINICAL FEATURES AND PROGNOSIS OF HEPATOCELLULAR CARCINOMA IN YOUNG PEOPLE.

However, clinical features of HCC in youth have not been fully studied. We investigated prevalence, clinical characteristics, and prognosis of the young age patients with HCC. A retrospective analysis was performed for HCC patients in our center(September 1994 to March 2004 using the cancer registry data. Among 4234 patients enrolled, the number of patients younger than 30 was 38 (0.9%). We compared the characteristics and survival data of these patients (group I) with those of sex-matched, randomly selected patients with HCC 30 -59 years old (group 11, n = 231) and 60 or older (group 111, n =147). Group I showed the distinct features, compared to group 11 and 111, (1) a low incidence of smoking history (5% vs. 52% vs. 66%, P < 38% vs. 27%, P < 0.001); (5) a larger tumor size (9.4cm vs. 4.7cm vs. 4.4cm, P < 0.001); (6) more frequent application of surgical resection (34% vs. 24% vs. 13%, P < 0.001) and chemotherapy as an initial treatment (21% vs. 4% vs. 3%, P < 0.001); (7) more advanced TNM stage (stage I: I 1 111: Wa: MY = 8%: 26%: 16%: 37%: 13% in group I vs. 11%: 42%: 25%: 9%: 13% in group 11 vs. 12%: 39%: 26%: 10%: 11% in group 111, P = 0.002 ); and (8) a lower grade of Child-Pugh class (class A B: C = 87%: 13%: 0% in group I vs. 46%: 42%: 12% in group I1 vs. 39%: 55%: 6% in group 1111, P <0.001). Median survival of group I was shorter than that of group II(25 mo vs. 46 mo, p = 0.04) but similar with that of group 111 (23 mo). However, in patients with stage I and 11, group I showed the highest survival rate (P = 0.04). In conclusion, our result suggests that young HCC patients tend to have poor prognosis due to advanced tumor stage despite well-preserved liver function and aggressive treatment.The following authors have indicated they have no relationships to disclose: Jeong Hwan Kim, Moon Seok Choi, Yo0 Mee Moon, Joon Hyeok Lee, Kwang Cheol Koh, Seung Woon Paik, Byung Chul Yoo, Jong Chul Rhee 327 SURVEILLANCE FOR HEPATOCELLULAR CARCINOMA EFFECT ON TUMOUR SIZE AND SURVIVAL.

Kyung Woo Park, loong-Won Park, Sang Hyung Cho, Hong Suk Park, Woo ]in Lee, Chang-Min Kim, Do Hoon Lee, National Cancer Center, Goyang, Republic of KoreaBackground: Hepatitis B virus (HBV) reactivation is known to be related with host immune state. Immune suppression, such as systemic chemotherapy could reactivate HBV infection and prophylatic anti-viral therapy before chemotherapy may be necessary in cancer patients with chronic hepatitis B. Transcatheter arterial chemoembolization (TACE) is one of important therapeutic modalities for unresectable hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). TACE is not a systemic chemotherapy, but HBV reactivation after a single session of TACE was reported. However, no any case-control studies about HBV reactivation after TACE were performed. The aim of this study is to evaluate whether TACE aggravates the viral hepatitis in patients with HBV-related HCC. Methods: One hundred thirteen patients with HBV-related HCC and no history of anti-viral therapy who attended National Cancer Center between October 2003 to March 2004 were studied prospectively. Patients treated with TACE were enrolled in the case group (n=69), and patients, who had no history of TACE, waiting for the management were enrolled in the control group (n=20). Baseline and follow-up evaluation including serum HBV DNA quantification using hybridization method, viral marker study, liver function study and tumor staging study were done in both group. TACE was performed according to National Cancer Center protocol, by doxorubicin (20-60mg) and lipiodol(2-20ml), andlor gelfoam embolization. Results: Mean follow-up period was 56 days in case group, 59 days in control group. Three (4.3%) patients of case group and 2 (10%) patients of control group showed HBV reactivation (p=0.334). A Twofold or more increase of serum HBV DNA (copieslml) was detected in 21 (30.4%) patients of case group and 4 (20%) patients of control (p=0.361). Exacerbation of viral hepatitis B, defined by the twofold or more rise of transaminase activities and HBV DNA copies, was found only in 4 (5.8%) patients of the case group but there is no statistical significance (p=0.271). Three patients of them were in spontaneous recovery within further 4-8 weeks, but one patient who had tumor progression showed continuous exacerbation. In univariate analysis on the baseline studies including HBV DNA quantification, HBeAg positivity, elevated transaminase, presence of precore mutant, and tumor characteristics, there were no any significant factors affecting a rise of HBV DNA. Conchsion: There was no differences in a change of HBV DNA activities and in the exacerbation of viral hepatitis between the case and the control groups. This study suggests that TACE using doxorubicin and lipiodol probably does not aggravate HBV hepatitis in patients with HBV-related HCC, although further proof with a large-scale study is necessary.The following authors have indicated they have no relationships to disclose: Kyung Woo Park, Joong-Won Park, Sang Hyung Cho, Hong Suk Park, Woo Jin Lee, Chang-Min Kim, Do Hoon Lee 330 INCIDENTAL HEPATOCELLULAR CARCINOMA IN LIVER Christian Moench, Gerd Otto, Iohannes Gutenberg University, Main; GermanyIntroduction: Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is a common complication in end stage liver cirrhosis.

Patients with increasing AFP were staged repeatedly. Incidental HCC was detected in postoperative histology in 21 (9,2%) patients. The UNOS-Stage of medical urgency at the timepoint of transplantation was MUCl in 1 patient (4,8%), MUC2 in 9 patients (42,9%) and MUC3 in 11 patients (52,3%). Tumor-(T)-Stage was T1 in 8 cases (%,I%), T2 in 7 cases Patients undergoing OLT for end-stage cirrhosis were at a 10% risk for incidental HCC, exceeding the Milan criteria in almost 40%. Although regular performed, staging failed in these patients. However, postoperative mortalitiy is rather based on surgical complications and underlying disease that on tumor recurrence.

Thomas M Grrhardt, Sabine Milz, Sybille Fuchs, Michael Schepke, MartinWolfi Tilman Sauerbruch, Franz Ludwig Dumoulin, University of Bonn, Bonn, Gennany Introduction: In order to assess prognostic factors for further prospective studies we conducted a retrospective analysis of 104 Methods: The following parameters were included in the uni-and multivariate analysis (cox regression model): age, bilirubin, Bismuth stage, C-reactive protein (CRP), resection, photodynamic therapy (PDT) and chemotherapy. Results: The diagnostic workup revealed a hilar tumor with Bismuth-Types I (n=12), 11 (n=16), 111 (n=31) and IV (n=38), respectively; 7 patients were diagnosed with carcinoma of the distal bile ducts. At the time of diagnosis all patients were cholestatic with a median serum bilirubin level of 8.RO resection could be performed. All patients underwent either transpapillary or percutaneous transhepatic biliary drainage. Moreover, 51 patients received an additional palliative therapy (intraluminal photodynamic therapy I PDT n = 33; systemic chemotherapy: n=18). 87/104 patients have died during a median follow up of 7.6 (0.7 -55.1) months and 17 patients are alive at a follow up of 17.3 (7.1-76.9) months. Evaluation for possible prognostic factors showed surgical resection (p=0.015) and low serum C-reactive protein levels at diagnosis (p=O.OOl) as significant factors in univariate regression analysis. Only CRP remained statistically significant in multivariate analysis (p-0.05). Conclusion: In our data CRP has been indentified as a novel prognostic parameter for patients with extrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma. We therefore suggest that CRP should be included as a prognostic parameter in further prospective studies.The following authors have indicated they have no relationships to disclose: Thomas M Gerhardt, Sabine Milz, Sybille Fuchs, Michael Schepke, Martin Wolff, Tilman Sauerbruch, Franz Ludwig Dumoulin EXTRAHEPATIC BILE DUCT CANCER -A RETROSPECTIVE 307A COMBINED INTRAARTERIAL FLUOROURACIL AND ADVANCED HEPATOCELLULAR CARCINOMA WITH TUMOR THROMBI IN THE MAJOR PORTAL BRANCHES CLINICAL RESPONSE AND INTERFERON ALPHA RECEPTOR 2 EXPRESSION.

Smruti R Mohanty, University of Chicago, Chicago, IL; Thomas 1 Layden, Scott 1 Cotler, University ofIllinois at Chicago, Chicago, 1LBackground: The incidence of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) has been increasing in the US over the past decade. The rise in HCC has been attributed to hepatitis C virus (HCV)-related cirrhosis. Recent studies have reported HCC in patients with cryptogenic cirrhosis and nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). Aim: To evaluate the causes of liver disease including cryptogenic cirrhosis in patients with HCC in various ethniclracial groups in a single center experience. Methods: We retrospectively reviewed the medical records of 189 patients with HCC from January 1998 to March 2004, obtained from the tumor registry of the University of Illinois Medical Center, Chicago. The diagnosis of HCC was based on histology or European Association of Study of Liver (EASL) criteria. Demographic data, etiology of liver disease, risk factors for liver disease, Child-Pugh score, tumor size and location, and TNM stage were obtained. Data were analyzed with student's t test or ANOVA for comparisons of means and Chi-square tests with Yates correction and Fisher exact test for categorical variables using SPSS, Version 11(Chicago, IL). Results: The mean age of patients with HCC was 59 2 13 years. Sixty-eight percent of patients in the study population were men, 35% were White, 27% were African American, and 23% were Hispanic. The most common etiologies of liver disease was HCV (41%) and cryptogenic cirrhosis (18%)[Tablel]. Thirty-three percent of patients(11134)with HCC and cryptogenic cirrhosis had histologic or clinical features associated with NAFLD. The patients with cryptogenic cirrhosis were more likely to be Hispanic (P < 0.02). The Hispanic patients also had larger tumor size (P < 0.01) and a higher Child-Pugh score at the time of presentation compared to Whites and African Americans. Conclusions: HCV and cryptogenic cirrhosis were the most common causes of liver disease in our patients with HCC. One third of patients with HCC and cryptogenic cirrhosis had evidence of NAFLD. Hispanic patients with HCC had the highest rate of cryptogenic cirrhosis and had larger tumor size at the time of diagnosis.The following authors have indicated they have no relationships to disclose: Smruti R Mohanty, Thomas J Layden, Scott J Cotler 335 HEPATOCELLULAR CARCINOMA IN HIV-INFECTED PATIENTS AND INFLUENCE OF HIV VIRAL LOAD ON SURVIVAL.

Abhinandana Anantharaju, Peter Seraphin, Sohrab Mobarhan, John Brems, Nikunj Shah, Loyola University Medical Center, Mnywood, IL Background: Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is a rapidly rising solid tumor in the USA. A variety of therapeutic options for HCC are available depending on the size of the lesion and the underlying liver & patient conditions. Most of these options are available only in University hospital settings where hepatologists & liver transplantation are available. The practice patterns between community Gastroenterologists & community Oncologists in the management of early HCC when it is amenable to liver transplantation are unknown. We studied the differences in practice patterns between community Gastroenterologists and community Oncologists in the Midwest. Methods: A one-page questionnaire with a stamped self-addressed return envelope was mailed to 460 community Gastroenterologists and 761 community Oncologists living in the Midwest (Illinois, Indiana, Michigan, & Wisconsin). Recipients were identified from the mailing lists of the American Gastroenterological Association and the American Society of Clinical Oncology. Results: 91 (19.8%) responses were received from the Gastroenterologists, of which, 86 were from the community practitioners. 140 (18.4%) responses were received from the Oncologists, of which, 134 were from the community practitioners.

Christa M Goebel, Joachim Lesske, Susanne Behl, Erich Lotterer, Wolfgnng E Fleig, Martin-Luther-University of Halle Wittenberg, Halle (Saale), Germany Systemic treatment of proven efficacy for advanced hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is not available. Thymophysin is a standardized thymus ultrafiltrate with thymostimulin / thymosin aifa as the predominant active peptide. It has been assigned anti-neoplastic and anti-wasting activity. Based on a previous pilot study from Italy, we investigated its efficacy and safety in a pilot study of patients with advanced HCC. Methods: Between July 2000 and September 2002,48 patients (84% male, median age 68 years) with locally advanced (n=39) or metastasized HCC (n=9) were recruited for the trial. Data allowing evaluation of survival and tumor response were available in 44 patients (Okuda IIIIIIII: n=13/28/3). 24/44 patients had previously been treated with hepatic resection, TACE, RFTA or systemic CTx. Pts. received 75 mg thymophysin S.C. t.i.w. or f.i.w. until progression and were followed up at 6 weeks and then every 3 months (mo) for a median of 11.5 [95%CI: 8.0 -14.91 mo. Primary endpoint was overall survival, secondary outcome parameters were tumor response and time to progression (TIT). Results: 36/44 pts. died during follow-up, 35/36 from HCC or liver failure. Median survival time after initiation of thymophysin was 11.1 [range: 0.4 -42.41 mo for all patients and was dependent on tumor stage and Child-Pughstatus. Survival rates at 1,2 and 3 years were 65.9%, 36.4% and 18.2YO, respectively. Tumor response was graded as CR in 1, PR in 2 and stable disease (SD) in 28 patients (tumor control rate: 70%). The one CR was obtained by RITA of a single HCC nodule remaining after 17 mo of thymophysin. 13 patients (30%) had a primary non-response. Median 'ITP was 6.4 mo (95%CI: 0.9 -11.9 mo). Mild local reactions at the injection site occured in 10 pts. (23%) and were the only side effects observed. Conclusion: Thymophysin appears as a safe and effective treatment of advanced HCC. A randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial is under way.Disclosures: Christa M Goebel -No relationships to disclose Joachim Lesske -No relationships to disclose Susanne Behl -No relationships to disclose Erich Lotterer -No relationships to disclose Wolfgang E Fleig -Cytochemia AG, Ihringen, Germany: Scientific StudylTrial 34s THE EFFECTS OF HEPATIC ARTERY CHEMOTHERAPY ON VIRAL HEPATITIS IN PATIENTS WITH HEPATOCELLULAR CARCINOMA.

Both agents have been associated with adverse effects (AE) that may impact compliance and efficacy. We compared the safety of PEGASYS with PEGASYSlCOPEGUS in patients enrolled in the WINGS trial. Methods: 1280 patients with chronic hepatitis C were randomized 1:3 to 48 weeks of treatment with PEGASYS or PEGASYSlCOPEGUS at 223 US centers. When results from multicenter clinical trials showed superior efficacy of PEGASYSKOPEGUS compared with monotherapy, an additional 602 patients were enrolled in the combination therapy a m s (Fried NEJM 2002, Hadziyannis Ann Intern Med 2004). The primary objective was the relative risk (RR) between the 2 randomized groups of fatigue (Fatigue Severity Scale 24), depression (BDI-I1 ?22), anemia (hgb <lo gldL or 23 gldL decrease), neutrophils (0.5 x 109/L, or clinically significant infections (CSI) requiring treatment through week 12.Results:Patients were predominantly male (69%), Caucasian (82%), aged >40 yrs (82%) with HCV genotype 1 infection (62%, non-1 18%, unknown 20%) and had most commonly acquired HCV through intravenous drug use (41%). 47% of patients were treatmentnaive, 29% had received prior treatment (i.e. had relapselbreakthroughlnonresponse) and the previous treatment status of 24% is unknown.

Dyslipidemia and abnormal insulin metabolism are common in H N infection and often related to anti-retroviral therapy (ART).Thus H N l HCV patients are at increased risk of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), which may also negatively impact response to antiviral therapy. Aim: To investigate the role of insulin resistance (IR) in early virological response (EVR) to combination therapy in HCVl H N co-infected patients. Methods: Baseline characteristics of 101 co-infected individuals who were enrolled into a re-treatment study with pegylated interferon a-2a and ribavirin (HRN004) were assessed. IR was calculated via the homeostasis model assessment (HOMA-IR). Liver biopsies were scored using the modified HA1 for HCV. Univariate analyses and multivariate logistic regression were utilized.Results: 92 patients began treatment, 19 patients discontinued therapy prior to 12 weeks. 73 patients entered this cohort, 31 (43%) demonstrated EVR. 61 (84%) were male, 60 (82%) genotype 1, 29 (40%) were Hispanic, 21 (29%) were African-American and 21 (29%) Caucasian. Mean age was 48.5 years (? 6.4SD), median BMI 25.8 (IQR 24.1-30.1); 34 (47%) were on a protease inhibitor, 70 (96%) had a CD4 count > 200, median 564 (IQR 378-788), 54 (74%) had undetectable HIV viral load, median HCV-RNA was 657x103 IUlml (IQR 438-5011x103). 27 (42%) had HOMA-1R <3.5, with mean cholesterol 172 mgldl (IQR 142-209) and triglycerides 139 mgldl (116-216). Histological analysis demonstrated that 70 (96%) patients had HA1 grade 0-9 and 42 (58Y0) had HA1 fibrosis stage In a logistic regression model, adjusted for protease inhibitor usage, baseline IR was a significant negative predictor of EVR (p=0.029) and cholesterol a positive predictor of EVR (p=0.008). Co-infected patients with genotype 2/3 were significantly more likely to demonstrate EVR (OR=11.3, 95%CI 1.6-79.7, p=0.015) as were Caucasians (OR=5.2, 95%CI 1.1-25.1, p=0.038). No association between EVR and baseline HA1 variables (necro-inflammatory grade and fibrosis stage) was detected. Conclusions: Our data demonstrate that HOMA-IR and cholesterol are significant predictors of EVR in HCVl HIV co-infected patients undergoing antiviral therapy.

Patients showing an HCV RNAdecrease < 2 log at week 12 have a minimal chance to eradicate HCV infection and are therefore considered non responders. Aim: To assess the predictive value of HCV viral dynamics in HCV-HIV coinfected patients treated with interferon + RBV Methods: From an ongoing randomised trial, in patients with CHC and stable HIV infection, aimed to compare the efficacy and safety of pegIFN alfa-2b (1.5 mcg/Kg/week) versus IFN standard (3 MIUl tiw), both in combination with RBV (800 mgld), we assessed the virological response at week 4,8 and 12 of treatment in the first 61-consecutive-enrolled patients who have finished treatment and follow-up periods, and constructed ROC plots with the RNA decreases from baseline at these time points (ARNA 4,8 and 12) to define the best cut-off point of predicted probability for SVR. The duration of treatment was 24 (genotype 2/3) or 48 weeks (genotype 1/4, in case HCV-RNA < 100 IUlmL at week 24). SVR was defined as HCV-RNA < 100 IUlmL 24 weeks after the end of treatment.Results: In an intent-to-treat analyses, SVR was 53% (16l30) in the pegIFN+RBV group and 35% (11/31) in the IFN+RBV group (p=ns). For genotype 1/4 SVR was 37% (7/19) versus 19% (4/21), whereas for genotype 2/3 SVR was 82% (9/11) and 70% (7/10), respectively. As summarised in the table, sensitivity peaks with 100% negative predictive value for SVR were observed for HCV-RNA decrease > 1 log at week 4 and > 3 log at week 12 of treatment. In a stepwise logistic regression analyses also including baseline parameters (HCV RNA, genotype, treatment arm, sex, age, BMI), HCV-RNA decrease at week 12 was the most powerful predictor of SVR. : SVR can be early predicted in HCV-HIV coinfected patients and the rule of 2-log decrease at week 12 is also useful. Monitoring the early response make special sense in this population both to avoid toxicity in non responders and to ensure adherence in all eventual responders.Notes.

Most studies reported these disorders as depressive episodes and thus recommended antidepressant treatment. However, in clinical practice, patients frequently complain of irritability and hostility and cases of mania and bipolar syndromes have been reported with IFN. Aims: To characterize mood disorders (incidence, time course, nature, risk factors and management) occurring during peginterferon plus ribavirin treatment of chronic hepatitis C . Methods: 98 naive patients with chronic hepatitis C (57 males, mean age 42212 yrs) treated with peginterferon-alpha ( 1 9~g / k g / week) plus ribavirin (800-1200 mgld) for 24 to 48 weeks were enrolled in a longitudinal study of mood assessment. They were PREVALENT MANIC SYMPTOMS IN PEGINTERFERON-systematically screened for mood disorders at baseline and during treatment (at week 4, W12, W24, and W48) by a trained psychologist using the MINI (Mini-International Neuropsychiatric Interview, a semi-structured interview that assess psychiatric disorders according to DSM-N criteria) and MADRS (Montgomery-Asberg Depression Scale, that measures intensity of depressive symptoms). In case of the occurrence of psychiatric side effects, patients were referred to a psychiatrist for diagnosis and management. Results: 38 patients (39%) developed mood disorderg (33 (87%) between baseline and Wl2, 5 (13%) between W12 and W24 and none after W24), consisting of major depression with manic features in 17 cases (45%) and irritable manialhypomania in 21 cases (55%). Their occurrence was significantly associated with a past history of depression (p<O.O4) and intravenous drug use (p<O.O06). 24 patients needed to be referred to a psychiatrist. Given the predominance of manic symptoms (mean number of maniac vs depressive symptoms: 5.33 vs 3.63, respectively; Wilcoxon test; t=31.5; z=3.08; p=0.002), patients were treated with an antipsychotic (amisulpride) at a low to moderate dosage (mean dose 160 mg, range 100-600 mg) (19 as initial treatment and 5 after failure of antidepressant treatment). Improvement was observed within 1 to 2 weeks in most patients, allowing the continuation of antiviral therapy in all patients but one (96%). Conclusions: Our findings, showing that IFN-induced mood disorders consist of a mixture of maniclhypomanic and depressive symptoms, differ substantially from those of studies published so far identifying depression as a hallmark of EN-induced mood disorders. They may have important therapeutic implications: when manic symptoms are prevalent, antidepressant may exacerbate these symptoms. Antipsychotic such as amisulpride should rather be used, allowing the continuation of antiviral therapy in the majority of patients.The following authors have indicated they have no relationships to disclose: Laurent Castera, Aymery Constant, Jacques Demotes-Mainard, Patrice Couzigou, Chantal Henry 430 OCULAR SIDE EFFECTS IN CHRONIC HEPATITIS C PATIENTS RECEIVING PEGYLATED INTERFERON (PEG-INF) ARE RELATED WITH SERUM VASCULAR ENDOTHELIAL GROWTH FACTOR (VEGD LEVELS. Raul Andrade, F Jesus Gonzalez, Luis Vazquez, Angel Cilaetti, R Cumurgo, M Garcia-Cartes, Mi Lucena, Hospital Cliniw Universitano, Maluga, SpainPEG-INF associated with ribavirin is currently the standard therapy for chronic hepatitis C. Side effects with combination therapy may be severe and often leads to premature discontinuation. Ocular features in patients treated with interferons appear to be common but usually asymptomatic although severe retinal changes and loss of visual acuity has been described. The &of this study was to determine the presence of ocular alterations during PEG-INF therapy and its possible relationship with the main pro-angiogenic growth factor (VEGF). Methods. Thirty four chronic hepatitis C patients [(18 menll6 women; median age 44.3 years (17-67)] were prospectively assessed during routine treatment with PEG-INF (18 patients with PEG-INF d a , 180 pglw and 16 with PEG-INFdb, 1.5 pglkglw). Complete ophthalmologic evaluation was performed before and at the end of therapy as was serum VEGF levels using a commercially available kit of ELISA (R&D system). Results: Thirteen out of 34 (38.2%) patients were found to develop ocular side effects considered to be of vascular pathogenesis (intraretinal haemorrhage and cotton wool patches; the OSE group). The presence of OSE was irrespective of the type of PEG-lNF employed as well as of the response to therapy. The OSE group had significantly higher serum VEGF levels than the group of patients without detectable side effects (NOSE group) (281 (106-386) vs 117 (83-225) pglml; p=O.O5). These differences increased when VEGF values were corrected by platelet count (1.656 (1.021-2.653) vs 0.820 (0.533-1.217) pg/106 platelets; p=O.ooS).In the OSE group baseline VEGF and VEGFlplatelet values were significantly higher than those observed in the other group (164 sions: In chronic hepatitis C patients treated with PEG-INF, the OSE presumed to be of vascular pathogenic origin, are related to circulating VEGF levels. High baseline serum VEGF levels may predict these particular adverse effects and could be useful to select the population that desenre a close follow-up.

Junichi Yumanaku, Shinichi Suito, Yuji limuro, Tadamichi Hirano, Nobukazu Kuroda, Toshihiro Okuda, Takauki Sugimoto, Jiro Fujimoto, Hyogo College of Medicine, Nishinomiya, Hyogo, Japan Aim: Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is frequently associated with chronic liver disease and develops intrahepatic metastasis.Hence, accurate assessment of liver resection volume (LRV) and tumor free margin. (TFM) is prerequisite for preoperative planning of safe and curative hepatectomy. Besides in cases of living related liver transplantation (LRLT), hepatic venous drainage needs to be estimated to avoid congestion both in liver graft and donor remnant liver. We previously reported efficacy of virtual hepatic resection using novel three-dimensional (3D) image analysis based on portal anatomy. This paper describes validation of our simulation system in HCC cases and its further application to LRLT. Mutm'uls & Methods:In 2001In  -2004 individuals underwent angiographic computed tomography preoperatively. There were 63 patients with HCC and 3 living related donors. Image analysis was performed using 3D image processing software, as reported previously. Briefly, 3D images of portal vein, hepatic vein, hepatic parenchyma, and tumor were reconstructed by volume-rendering technique and overlapped to create integrated 3D images. Clipping of tumor-bearing portal branch prompted calculation of LRV, based on portal perfusion. In addition, TFM was calculated individually. In living related donors, liver graft volumehy was performed in the same fashion. Moreover the simulation algorithm was applied to hepatic venous system to estimate drainage area by hepatic vein branch. At the time of actual operation, LRV and TFM of resected specimens were measured and compared with predicted values. Correlation between predicted and actual LRV was compared with that in historical controls, which used planimetry in1996-2000 (n=80). Results: There was no hospital mortality. Difference between estimated and actual LRV was 4.1 2 47 cm3 (correlation coefficient (r) = 0.91, p < 0.01). In contrast, no significant correlation was shown in historical controls. Difference between predicted and actual TFM was 1.6 ? 3.0 mm (r = 0.86, p < 0.05). In a case of LRLT, drainage areas of inferior right hepatic vein (IRHV) and middle hepatic vein tributaries were estimated individually. Because IRHV accounted for 36% of hepatic venous drainage of the right hemi-liver graft, reconstruction of IRHV was carried out. Conclusions: Our 3D image analysis enabled accurate prediction of LRV and TFM. Hence, the concept of our simulation system warrants safe and curative hepatectomy, especially in patients with HCC and marginal synthetic function. Application of simulation algorithm to hepatic venous system allowed volumetric estimation of drainage area by hepatic vein branch, which may need reconstruction in LRLT.

Mehrdad Nikfajam, Vijayarngnvan Muralidharan, Caterha Malcontenti-Wilson, Christopher Christophi, University of Melbourne, Department of Surgery, Melbourne, Australia Background:The exact mechanisms of tissue destruction by focal hyperthermia are unknown. Clinical and experimental studies suggest a progression of injury after cessation of the initial heat stimulus. This study investigates the mechanisms and time sequence of focal hyperthermia injury in a murine model of colorectal liver metastases. Methods: Focal hyperthermia produced by a Nd-YAG (wavelength 1064 nm) laser source was applied to normal liver and colorectal cancer liver metastases in CBA mice. The extent of direct lethal thermal injury was assessed histochemically by a vital stain for nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NADH) diaphorase immediately following laser application. Tissue injury at subsequent time points was assessed by both NADH diaphorase staining and routine histology to determine the temporal relationship between tissue necrosis and time. Paraffin embedded tissue sections were assessed for apoptosis, proliferation, Kupffer cell response and Heat shock protein 70 (HSP 70) expression. Microvascular damage was assessed at various time points by scanning electron microscopy, Laser Doppler flowmetry and confocal in-vivo microscopy.",

Pache, lean-Charles Duclos-Vallee, Elina Teicher, Henri Bismuth, Denis Castaing, Daniel Vittecoq, Didier Samuel, Paul Brousse Hospital, Villejuij France Patients with a chronic viral hepatitis have a faster evolution to cirrhosis when co-infected with HIV. Since 1998, these patients have been evaluated for liver transplantation. Aim: to determine at what time of their liver disease these patients are referred. Results: between 1.1.1998 and 30.6.2003,102 patients with cirrhosis due to chronic hepatitis B, C andlor D and co-infected with HIV have been seen at our Hepatology Unit. Mean age was 41.657.3 years. Eighty six (84.3%) patients were male. HIV infection was known for 11.424.3 years. Contamination was most frequently due to drug injections. Mean CD4 count was 3895298. Pugh B and 42 (41.2%) Child-Pugh C. The mean MELD score was 17.656.5. Among the 59 patients who were considered as possible candidates for liver transplantation, 17 (28.8%, mean MELD score: 23.4e5.7) died before evaluation or on waiting list, 4 (6.8%) reached again a Child-Pugh A score and were withdrawn from waiting list (no death during follow up) and a diagnosis of advanced hepatocellular carcinoma was made in 1 patient. Fourteen (23.7%) patients had a liver transplantation, Their mean MELD score was 19.426.5. 23 patients are still waiting transplantation. Forty-nine (48%) patients did not meet criteria for a liver transplantation. The most frequent reasons (>loo%) were: Child-Pugh A cirrhosis (69.4%), current alcohol abuse (24.5%), non compliance (18.4%), advanced hepatocarcinoma in 5 patients (10.2%). Conclusions: among the 102 HIV infected patients referred for cirrhosis due to chronic viral hepatitis, 57.8% met the criteria for a liver transplantation, but in 29%, the liver disease was too advanced and these patients died before evaluation or on the waiting list. The Meld score as prognosis indicator should be evaluated, but more specific and sensitive criteria for liver transplantation should be defined in HCV-HIV co-infected patients. HIV coinfected patients should be referred early in the course of the liver disease to a liver transplantation unit.The following authors have indicated they have no relationships to disclose: Isabelle Pache, Jean-Charles Duclos-Vallee, Elina Teicher, Henri Bismuth, Denis Castaing, Daniel Vittecoq, Didier Samuel DONOR PREDICTIVE FACTORS OF HCV RECURRENCE AFTER LIVER TRANSPLANTATION (OLTX).

Gwvanni Battista, Torino, Italy; Rene Adnm, HBpital Paul Brousse, Paris, France; Darius F Mina, Queen Elizabeth Hospitnl, Birmingham, United Kingdom; on behalf of centres contributing to the European Liver Transplant Registry (ELTR)Hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection has become the most common indication for liver transplantation (LT). Graft and patient survival are adversely affected by recurrent infection of the graft. Recent pubfications have described an inferior outcome for recently transplanted HCV patients and have highlighted the impact of advancing donor age on severity of recurrent HCV. The donor age at which a measurable impact on graft and patient outcome can be observed has not clearly been defined. In addition, the impact of donor age on graft and patient survival for non-HCV patients needs to be examined. Methods. We have examined the ELTR to examine the impact of transplantation date and donor age on graft and patient survival for HCV patients (n=4736) and for a comparison group of transplanted alcoholic liver disease patients (ALD, n=5406). Results. For the entire cohort, graft and patient survival of HCV patients was inferior to ALD patients. Since 1987 there has been a steady improvement in the outcome of transplanted ALD patients, an improvement not observed for HCV patients. Liver donor age has increased year on year since 1989. Graft and patient survival for both ALD and HCV cohorts was adversely affected by advancing donor age. Comparison of graft and patient survival for HCV and ALD cohorts was made according to donor age (donor age sub-grouped <20,20-30,30-40,40-50, 50-60 and > 60 years of age). For donors younger than 40 years of age, HCV and ALD recipient graft and patient survival are not significantly different. For donors older than 40, HCV recipient graft survival is inferior to ALD graft survival, an inferiority that increases for each advancing decade of donor age. For donors older than 50, HCV recipient patient survival is inferior to ALD patient survival, an inferiority that increases when the donor age is greater than 60. Conclusion. The results of liver transplantation for European HCV patients are inferior to a comparison group of ALD patients, and have not improved during the past 15 years. Liver donor age has increased significantly during that period. Advancing donor age has an adverse influence on graft and patient survival for ALD and HCV patients, but a significantly greater impact is observed for HCV patients when the donor is older than 40 years.The following authors have indicated they have no relationships to disclose: David J Mutimer, Bridget K Gunson, John Chen, Joaquin Berenguer, Peter Neuhaus, Denis Castaing, Juan C Garcia-Valdecasas, Mauro Salizzoni, Rene Adam, Darius F Mirza 455 PROSPECTIVE EVALUATION OF HEPATIC VENOUS PRESSURE AND EVOLUTION OF RECURRENT HCV AFTER LIVER TRANSPLANTATION.

A Obaid Shakil, Shahid Habib, A Jake Demetris, Mordechai Rabinovitz, Thomas Shaw-Stifleel, Amadeo Marcos, John J Fung, Uniiwrsily of Pittsburgh, Pittsburgh, PA Background and Aims:Hepatitis C viral (HCV) infection in the transplant recipient has an accelerated course. The aim of our study was to determine host, donor and virologic factors that influence disease severity in the liver allograft. Methods: We initiated a prospective follow up study of liver transplant recipients with hepatitis C. The primary end point of our current analysis was the stage of liver allograft fibrosis at one year ( 2 3 months) post-transplantation. Demographic, laboratory and virologic factors were analyzed by univariate and multivariate analyses to determine their association with severe disease. Results: Among 265 HCV positive patients transplanted during the study period, 179 were enrolled. One hundred and twenty one had at least one year of post-transplantation follow up and among them 87 had liver allograft biopsies performed at one year. Twelve patients died within the first year of follow up. Histology revealed mild disease (modified fibrosis stage 0-2) in 38 patients and severe disease (stage 3-6) in 29 patients. The mean recipient age was similar in the two groups, but recipients with severe disease were462 EXPRESSION OF FIBROCYSTIN DURING CILIOGENESIS.

We have hypothesized that CK-stimulated cholangiocytes initiate NSDC by chemoattracting T cells to bile ducts. Indeed, IFNy+TNFa induce immortalized cholangiocytes (ICs) from the BALBIc target strain to secrete CKs that chemoattract activated T cells bearing CCR and CXCR3 receptors. ICs also express both CCR and CXCR3 CRs, but the role of autocrinelparacrine signaling in the generation of peribiliary CK gradients is unknown. Aim:To study the impact of inhibiting CCR1,3,5 and CXCR3 on CK secretion by ICs stimulated with IFNy+TNFa. Methods: Noncytotoxic inhibitors included anti-CXCR3 antibody (1-25 pglml) for CXCR3, and Met-RANTES or AOP-RANTES (10, 50, 100 ngl ml) for CCR1,3,5. ICs were incubated with inhibitors for 30 min before adding recombinant, mouse IFNy+TNFa. After 2 h, IC secretion of the CCR ligand CCL5 and CXCR3 ligands CXCL9, CXCLlO and CXCLll was quantified using ELISAs.

            "text": "In patient with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), indication for the liver transplantation is decided based on the size and number of tumor nodules, and the Milan criteria, a < = 5 cm single nodule or <=3 nodules, each < =3 cm, is the most widely accepted guideline for selection. On the other hand, recent studies have indicated that vascular infiltration is the strongest independent prognostic determinant for HCC patients undergoing liver transplantation. Since, vascular invasion is difficult to identify prior to transplantation, the size and number criteria can be regarded as surrogate markers for vascular invasion. We hypothesized that inclusion of well accepted two tumor markers, i.e., alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) and des-y-carboxy prothrombin (DCP), into the selection criteria for transplantation candidates will increase the accuracy of predicting vascular invasion, and attempted to verify this hypothesis. The study population consisted of 394 consecutive patients with HCC who underwent hepatic resection who had no gross evidence of vascular invasion andlor satellite nodules preoperatively. There were 302 men and 92 women, 261 (66%) of whom had liver cirrhosis, and their median age was 65 years (range: 13-87). Vascular invasion was present in 128 (32%) of the 394 patients. First we used logistic regression analysis to create a model that would predict the absence of vascular invasion based on information on the size and number. The overall accuracy of the model was evaluated by drawing a receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve (Model I). We then created another model that incorporated tumor markers in addition to the size and the number of the nodules (Model 2). At the same sensitivity as the Milan criteria (80.1%), the specificity of Model 1 and Model 2 was 49.3% and 57.0%, respectively. The difference between these two specificities is 7.7 O/u (95% C.I. 2.2-14%). Also difference between area under the curves in two ROC curves were statistically significant (difference 6.1 O h , 95 ' / o C.I. 2.3-10.7 %). In the present population, predictive value of Milan criteria negative for the vascular invasion was 75.8 O h (213/281). If the modified Milan criteria in which the patient must also have an AFP value < 1000 ng/mL and a DCP value of 4 6 0 A.U. were used, the predictive value would increase to 83.9 % (172/205); (p=0.03, McNemar test). Serum AFP and plasma DCP values are easy to measure preoperatively, and they add significant accuracy in the prediction of vascular invasion to the currently used criteria, such as the Milan criteria. We propose more stringent criteria by adding two biochemical tumor markers to assist in patient selection, thereby allowing more equitable allocation of a scarce donor resource. At present, there is no universally accepted system for classification of patients with colorectal liver metastases. We present herewith a new and simple classification system for such patients designed for utility in clinical staging and predicting long-term outcome after surgical resection. Methods: A retrospective review was undertaken of 83 consecutive patients who had undergone partial hepatectomy for colorectal liver metastases between 1981 and 1997. Clinical and pathological features of both primary and metastatic cancers were entered into a multivariate analysis in an effort to determine independent variables helpful in accurately predicting long-term prognosis after hepatectomy.",

Cox regression analysis showed that multiple hepatic tumors (p=O.OlSS, risk ratio= 2.557), hepatic metastatases of more than 5cm in greatest diameter (p=0.0116, risk ratio= 2.803) and resected extrahepatic distant metastases (p=0.0183, risk ratio=3.146) were significant and independent prognostic factors for poor survival after hepatectomy. Using these three variables, we constructed a classification system as detailed below. Thereafter, 81 patients were significantly divided into three groups, Stage 1 to Stage Ill (p=0.0003). The 5-year survival rates of patients in Stage I, 11, 111 were approximately 75%, So%, and lo%, respectively. Conclusions: Our new classification system, similar to the TNM classification system of UICC, is simple and useful for staging patients with colorectal liver metastasis. Introduction: 70% resection of a normal liver is well tolerated but this figure diminishes in the presence of underlying liver disease. This is a common issue in HCC but uncommon in CRMs in part because traditional chemotherapeutic drugs (5-FU) are minimally hepatotoxic. We evaluated the effect of newer chemotherapeutic agents on the development of steatohepatitis, which could affect resection of liver tumors due to diminished hepatic functional reserve. Methods: 39 patients who were sent for resection of CRMs had histologic specimens of the liver available for analysis. 13 patients (NO CHEMO) had received no neoadjuvant therapy, 10 had received 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) only, and 16 (IRI-OXALI) had received irinotecan (13), oxaliplatin (4) andlor carboplatin (1) often in conjunction with 5-FU (15). Blinded specimens were rated for: cellular ballooning, necrosis, and regeneration, microvesicular and macrovesicular steatosis, portal and lobular inflammation, fibrosis and cholestasis. Scores were summated into a liver injury score (LIS). Nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) scores were also determined for each specimen according to established criteria (ballooning, steatosis, and inflammation). Results: No patient had a history of prior liver disease. Mean biopsy scores were: NO CHEMO LIS 5.2, NASH 1.2; 5-FU only: LIS 5.7, NASH 1.1; and IRI-OXALI: LIS 9.8, NASH 2.0. LIS scores are shown in the figure. LIS and NASH scores were significantly higher in the IRI-OXALI group than in the other two groups p=0.027 for LIS and p=0.0002 for NASH (Kruskal-Wallis Test). The difference in scores was due to 5 patients in the IRI-OXALI (2 IRI, 2 OXALI and one patient who received both) who has severe steatohepatitis. There were no statistical differences in scores between NO CHEMO and 5 FU only. Dose, duration of administration, or time from discontinuation of chemotherapy did not impact on biopsy score. The presence of steatohepatitis resulted in alteration of surgical management in several patients. Conclusions: Severe steatohepatitis may be associated with IRI or OXALl in some patients. The effect is not obviously dose related. It may affect the ability to perform large liver resections Therefore, consideration should be Aim: This study assesses Interstitial Laser Thermotherapy (ILT) as an ablative technique for treatment of selected patients with colorectal liver metastases. Method: A series of 80 patients with unresedable colorectal cancer (CRC) liver metastases were selected for ILT treatment using a bare-tip quartz fibre connected to a NdYAG laser source. Treatment was monitored with real-time ultrasound. Tumors were considered unresectable based on their anatomical location or the extent of liver involvement. Patients with extrahepatic disease, more than five liver metastases and tumors greater than 10 cm in diameter were excluded from this study. Results: In the 80 patients, there were 168 liver tumors treated with a median diameter of 5 cm (range 1 -10 cm) without any procedure related deaths. The overall complication rate was 16 per cent, with all cases managed conservatively. Complete tumor ablation was achieved in 67 per cent of patients. Median follow-up was 35 months (range 4-96 months) with 10 patients alive at the end of this period. Sixty-seven deaths occurred and were related to hepatic disease in 55 cases, extrahepatic disease in nine patients and unrelated to malignancy in three others. Three patients were excluded from follow-up after ILT down-staging of tumors that allowed complete surgical resection. The median survival of patients treated by ILT was 35 months, with a five-year survival of 6.7 per cent. Well and moderate differentiation of the primary tumor, the presence of less than three hepatic metastases and treatment of patients with disease recurrence following hepatic resection was associated with improved overall survival (P < 0.05).

Advances have resulted in the reduction of patient morbidity (pain, adynamic ileus, pulmonary dysfunction), enhanced diagnositc accuracy, and reduced length of hospital stay while enabling rapid return to normal activity and work. These advantages have long been recognized in general surgical procedures such as cholecystectomy, foregut surgery (fundoplication, bariatric surgery), donor nephrectomy, and only recently solid organ resection. Though in its infancy, minimally invasive (laparoscopic) hepatic surgery offers the same advantages, however, the feasibility, techniques, safety, and outcomes are largely undefined. We present our institutional experience in the minimally invasive treatment of hepatic neoplasms (benign and malignant), establishing the value of minimally invasive surgery in the armamentarium of liver-directed therapy. Between 7/01 and 5/04 we performed 100 laparoscopic hepatic resections, including: segmentectomy, left lateral segmentectomy (LLat. Seg), hepatic sectorectomy, caudate lobectomy, left lobectomy, right lobectomy, and trisegementectomy (Triseg). Resection was performed for a wide variety of neoplastic lesions: adenoma, focal nodular hyperplasia, hemangioma, portal vein-hepatic vein veno-venous malformation, polycystic liver disease, cystadenoma, adenocarcinoma, neuroendocrine tumor, hepatocellular carcinoma. Six patients had cirrhosis at the time of procedure. Operative time, blood loss, resection margin (malignant tumors), transfusion (tx), length of stay (LOS), bile leaks, infection, pulm complications, and tumor recurrence were assessed. Mean resection margins (malignant tumors) was 11 mm. Only two patients required blood transfusion (caudate, right lobe). Bile leaks resolved spontaneously. Mean follow-up is 14 months (range 1-34). We find laparoscopic liver resection provides a minimally invasive theraputic option in the treatment of hepatic neoplasms.Although not yet directly compared to open resection, our initial review suggests this novel approach is safe and effective in a variety of hepatic diseases. Given these findings minimally invasive hepatic surgery will be a valuable addition to the management algorithm for hepatic neoplasms. ",

Methods: Fifty-four consecutive patients (36 men) with histologically confirmed post-LT HCV recurrence, who were treated with combination interferon and RBV, were prospectively studied. Discontinuation of RBV therapy and indications for discontinuation were recorded. Patient and virus specific variables were also recorded.

Median age was 49.8 years. 21 patients were genotype 1, 5 were genotype 2, 2 were genotype 2 and one was genotype 4. Median pre-treatment viral load was 2.8 million iulml. Median interval between OLT and treatment was 16 months. 15 patients have completed treatment, 11 remain on therapy and 3 were intolerant. Of the patients who completed treatment, 11 were HCVRNA negative at 3 months and remain negative at EOT. 6 months after EOT, 5 remain HCVRNA negative (pending in 6). Of the 11 patients on treatment, 7 were HCVRNA negative at 3 months, 1 was RNA positive and pending in 3. Interestingly, 2 of the 3 intolerant patients developed a sustained response to HCV eradication after 2 months of treatment (both were genotype 2). Improved fibrosis scores, defined as a downstaging of the EOT biopsy by at least 1 stage, occurred in only 1 patient, were unchanged in 3 and worse in 8 patients, of whom 6 were sustained responders. Decompensated liver disease occurred in 3 of these 6 patients of whom 2 were retransplanted and remain HCVRNA negative after a mean follow up of 8 months. Conclusions: Pegylated interferon alfa-2a and ribavirin were well tolerated in this series of patients. Only 11.3% of patients withdrew from therapy. In an intention to treat analysis, sustained HCV eradication occurred in at least 24.1% of patients. However, progressive fibrosis occurred in 75% of sustained responders. This suggests that mechanisms other than recurrent HCV may be responsible for cirrhosis in these patients who, despite successful HCV eradication, remain at risk of developing decompensated liver disease requiring retransplantation. The following authors have indicated they have no relationships to disclose: Sandeep Mukherjee, Joyce Rogge, Lynne Weaver, Daniel F Schafer, Rowen Zetterman more likely to have received organs from older donors. Although most patients were men, recipients with severe disease were more likely to be women and more likely to have gender mismatch. Pre-transplant MELD score was lower in patients with severe disease but Child-Pugh score was similar. The proportion of patients who received T cell depletion therapy as induction immunosuppression (anti-thymocyte globulin or alemtuzumab) was similar in the two groups. Pre-transplant serum HCV RNA levels and HCV genotype distribution was also similar in the two groups. There was no difference in the warm and cold ischemia times and blood product usage. The results did not change when we repeated the analysis after including in the severe group, an additional 9 patients who died between 12 and 48 weeks following transplantation. Older donor age was the only factor found predictive of severe disease on multi-variate analysis. Thirteen had a significant viremic breakthrough (HBV DNA>lOE5 copieslml), (group A, phenotypic mutation). Two of them continued LAM and 11 were treated with a double therapy (ADV and LAM) before OLT. Moreover, 9 patients selected YMDD mutant without a significant viremic breakthrough (<10E5 copieslml) and continued LAM therapy without ADV addition (group 8, genotypic mutation). Results. In group A (mean follow-up: 23 months after OLT), hepatitis B recurred in both two patients transplanted with significant viral load, treated with LAM before OLT and prophylaxed with LAM and HBIG after surgery. None of the 11 patients with HBV DNA 4 0 E 5 copieslml, inducted by ADV therapy before OLT, and treated long-term with a double or a triple prophylaxis after surgery, developed HBV recurrence. In group B (mean follow-up: 29 months after OLT) the HBV recurred in 2 subjects who suspended HBIG post-surgery, and in none of those treated with a combined prophylaxis post-OLT. Conclusions. OLT waiting list suspension and ADV addition are needed in patients with YMDD phenotypic mutation, but no in those with the genotypic mutation. Post OLT long-term combined prophylaxis with HBIG and LAM is effective in both groups and triple prophylaxis could be the surest option in case of phenotypic mutation . ulin (HBIG) and lamivudine (LAM), outcome of orthotopic liver transplantation (OLT) for patients with hepatitis B virus (HBV) has significantly improved. The aim of this study is to evaluate the lamivudine mono prophylaxis post OLT for HBV infection, especially for patients with HBV-DNA negative at OLT. Patients and Methods: OLT recipients with chronic HBV infection received LAM mono prophylaxis without HBIG were analyzed. At our center, patients with HBV-DNA negative at OLT were elected to receive LAM monotherapy since 1994. LAM was given 150mgl day. Liver function tests, HBV-DNA, and serological markers of HBV of these patients were collected. The efficacies of LAM monotherapy on survival after OLT and on prevention of recurrent hepatitis B were analyzed. Results: Among 1378 patients who received OLT from January 1994 to April 2004,130 patients (9.4%) had hepatitis B infection. 67 patients were HBV-DNA negative at OLT without co-infection with hepatitis C virus or Human Immunodeficiency Virus. Of those, 38 patients received LAM mono prophylaxis without HBIG post OLT. Median age was 54 (range 27-68), malelfemale was 29l9. Median follow up after OLT was 63 months (range 5-116). Five patients needed re-OLT, 3 were due to primary non function, 1 hepatic artery thrombosis, 1 delayed graft function. Five patients died from the reasons other than recurrent hepatitis at 5 to 64 month after OLT. One and 5 year patient /graft survival were 95184% and 87177% respectively. HBV-DNA was re-detected in 5 patients (13%) at 1 to 29 month. Recurrent hepatitis B was seen in a patient (3%) at 27 month. This patient is currently on Tenofovir therapy with partial response. There was no significant side effect with lamivudine use. Conclusion: Lamivudine mono prophylaxis after OLT is effective and safe treatment for hepatitis B patients with negative HBV-DNA. Monotherapy without HBIG may provide patients more cost-effective and more comfortable treatment. ",

            "text": "During the past 15 years, outcomes after liver transplantation (LT) of hepatitis B related liver cirrhosis (HBV-LC) was improved with the use of hepatitis B immune globulin (HBIG), and later, lamivudine. The aim of this study was to evaluate the current outcomes of HBV-LC after LT in Korea. From Jan. 1999 to Dec. 2002 among 532 cases of LT (62.8%) were collected from 4 centers. Preoperative active viral replication was noted in 221 cases (66.2%) who had HBeAg (+) or HBV DNA (-1. For prophylaxis of HBV recurrence, combination therapy of HBIG plus lamivudine was most frequently used in 210 cases (62.9%), and secondly, HBIG monotherapy in 124 cases (37.1%). Prophylaxis consisted of HBIG infusion of 10000-20000 IU intraoperatively, 10000 IU per day for seven days postoperatively, and following infusion of 10000 IU per week for three times. After that, hepatitis B antibody titer was checked and maintained > 500 IUlL for HBIG monotherapy or > 350 IUlL for combination therapy. For combination therapy, lamivudine 100 mg PO daily was added for one year or more. Immunosuppressant was calcineurin inhibitor based protocol. One-year survival rate was 81% and three-year survival rate was 69%. Overall recurrence rate was 6.6 % (22/334). The mean time interval to recurrence after transplant was 15.8 (2-40) months. The HBV recurrence rate was 8.3% with preoperative lamivudine therapy vs 5.5% with no therapy, 8.5% with whole grafts vs 6.2% with partial grafts, and 7.4% in active viral replicators vs 4.0% in inactive replicators (p>0.05). The recurrence rate in HBIG monotherapy was 4.0% and 8.1% in combination therapy (p>0.05). The recurrence rate of HB after LT in Korea was 6.6%. These results suggest that LT for HBV-LC was safe with low recurrence rate if providing adequate prophylaxis even in active viral replicators. The following authors have indicated they have no relationships to disclose: Nam-Joon Yi, Kyung-Suk Suh, Dong Goo Kim, Jae Won Joh, Soon II Kim With limited therapeutic options IL-6, a potent mitogen and survival factor for cholangiocarcinomas, activates survival signals via the serinelthreonine kinase Akt. We have recently reported that Mcl-1, a potent anti-apoptotic protein of the Bcl-2 family, is a key survival protein in this cancer. Thus, the AIM of this study was determine if whether IL-6 upregulates Mcl-1 by an Akt-dependent mechansim. Methods: Akt and Mcl-1 expression in human normal liver (n=25), alcoholic liver cirrhosis (n=15), and cholangiocarcinoma (n =33) were determined by immunohistochemistry, and in cholangiocarcinoma cell lines by immunoblot analysis. A novel Akt inbhibor (A443654.3) was employed to inhibit Akt activity. Akt and Mcl-1 mRNAs expression were assessed by real time PCR. IL-6 secretion by CCA cells was quantitated by an ELISA, and its activity blocked with anti-IL-6 neutralizing antisera. Apoptosis was quantitated using DAPI and fluorescence microscopy. Results: Akt and Mcl-1 were strongly expressed in CCA specimens, but only weakly expressed in cholangiocytes from normal liver or patients with alcoholic cirrhosis (a disease control group). Likewise, Akt, phospho-Akt (the activated enzyme), and Mcl-1 were constitutively expressed in all three CCA cell lines, KMCH, KMBC, and W I T cells. The cell lines all secreted IL-6; and anti-IL-6 neutralizing anti-sera serum reduced cellular levels of phospho-Akt and Mcl-1, consistent with an 1L-6 autocrine pathway mediating Akt-dependent Mcl-1 protein expression. The Akt inhibitor effectively blocked phosphorylation of GSK-3beta, an Akt substrate, in a concentration-and time-dependent manner in all three cell lines. More importantly, the inhibitor also resulted in loss of cellular Mcl-1. The Akt inhibitor neither altered Mcl-1 mRNA expression nor or the transcript's half-life. Instead, the Akt inhibitor markedly reduced the half-life of Mcl-1 protein. Cells exposed to the Akt inhibitor were markedly susceptible to TRAIL-mediated apoptosis as compared to vehicle treated cells. In conclusion, our findings demonstrate overexpression of Akt and Mcl-1 in human CCA. The increased Mcl-1 protein appears to be mediated by an autocrine IL-6lAkt signaling pathway that prolongs Mcl-1 protein half life. Akt pharmacologic inhibitors may prove useful for potentiating therapeutic apoptosis in CCA. The principal extrarenal manifestation of autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD) involves formation of liver cysts derived from intrahepatic bile ducts. Autocnnelparacrine factors secreted into the cyst would be positioned to modulate the rate of hepatic cyst growth. The aim of this study was to identify potential growth factors present in human ADPKD liver cyst fluid. Cytokine array and ELISA analysis of human ADPKD liver cyst fluid detected ENA-78, IL-6 (503 2 121 pglml); and IL-8 (4,488 2 355 pglml); and elevated levels of VEGF compared to non-ADPKD bile (649 5 144 pglml vs. 270 pglml max conc.). ADPKD liver cyst cell cultures also released IL-8 and VEGF, suggesting that cystic epithelial cells themselves are capable of secreting these factors. Furthermore, polarized monolayers derived from cpk (+/-) mouse liver cysts, a model for human ADPKD liver disease, show modest apical and robust basal VEGF secretion. Western blotting of cultured human cyst cells and immunostaining of intact cysts demonstrate that CXCR2, an ENA-78 and IL-8 receptor, is expressed at the apical domain of cyst lining epithelial cells. Hypoxia is a known stimulus for IL-8, ENA-78, IL-6 and VEGF secretion. Suggesting the cystic epithelial cells may exist in hypoxic conditions, electron microscopy of the ADPKD liver cyst epithelium revealed morphologies similar to those observed in ischemic bile ducts. These features include elongation, altered structure and diminished abundance of apical microvilli. In conclusion, IL-8, ENA-78, IL6 and VEGF may serve as autocrinel paracrine factors to direct errant growth of ADPKD liver cyst epithelia. Interruption of these signaling pathways may provide therapeutic targets for inhibiting liver cyst expansion. In BDL rats, there is growing information regarding the mechanisms of cholangiocyte proliferation, which is modulated by a complex system of growth factors, neuropeptides and hormones that finely regulate cell growth. Increased CAMP levels enhance cholangiocyte growth, whereas reduced CAMP synthesis decreases cholangiocyte growth. We have shown that: (i) cholangiocytes express the four G-coupled histamine receptors (HlR, H2R, H3R and H a ) ; and (ii) histamine increases normal cholangiocyte prolieration through interaction with the specific histamine receptors, H1 and H2 (regulated by Ga, and Ga, respectively) but not by H3/H4 (regulated byTo understand the role and mechanisms of action of the H3/H4 histamine receptor in cholangiocyte growth, we pose the following questions: (1) Does in mvo administration of the specific H3lH4R agonist (RAMH) inhibit proliferation in BDL rats? and (2) Does in vitro stimulation with the specific H3lH4R agonist (RAMH) inhibit proliferation in isolated cholangiocytes from BDL rats through negative regulation of the CAMP-dependent PKAlERKll2 pathway? Methods: Immediately after BDL, rats were treated by daily IP injections with the selective H3/H4 histamine receptor agonist, (R)-(a)-(-)-methylhistamine dihydrobromide (RAMH, 10 mglKgl ratlday) or NaCl for one week. Proliferation and intracellular CAMP levels were determined. In vitro, pure cholangiocytes from 1 wk BDL rats were stimulated with: (i) 0.2% BSA or (ii) the H3lH4R agonist (10 pM) for 90 minutes. PCNA protein expression and intracellular CAMP levels were determined and phosphorylated PKA and ERKlR levels were measured by immunoblotting.Results: Chronic administration of the specific H3lH4R agonist (RAMH) to BDL rats decreased cholangioctye proliferation and cAMP levels compared to BDL rats treated with NaCl. In vitro, stimulation with RAMH decreased PCNA protein expression and cAMP levels compared to basal. Phosphorylated PKA and ERKll2 were also decreased in cholangiocytes stimulated with RAMH compared to basal. SummntylConclusion: The specific H3lH4R agonist, RAMH, inhibits cholangiocyte proliferation induced by BDL. This inhibition is mediated through negative regulation of the CAMP-dependent PKAIERKlR pathway. Regulation of the increase or decrease in cholangiocyte growth by specific histamine receptors, i.e., H1R and H2R (by increasing proliferation through activation of the Caz+-or CAMP-dependent pathways, respectively) or H3/H4R (by inhibiting proliferation through negative regulation of the CAMP-dependent pathway) may be important in the course of chronic liver diseases. Stromal cell derived factor-1 (SDF-1) is a member of the CXC subfamily of chemokine, and has a unique receptor CXCR4. SDF-1lCXCR4 has been shown to be involved in metastasis and invasion of prostate, ovarian and breast cancers. SDF-1 and TNF-a induced by chronic inflammation around the stonecontaining bile ducts may influence the biological activities of ICC arising in hepatolithiasis. We examined: 1) the expression of SDF-lICXCR4 in ICC with hepatolithiasis, 2) the significance of SDF-llCXCR4 system in the cell proliferation and invasion in ICC cell lines, 3) the regulation of CXCR4 by TNF-a. Methods: Human study: The expression of SDF-1, CXCR4 and TNF-a was immunohistochemically examined in 48 livers taken from patients with ICC with hepatolithiasis and 8 livers with normal bile duct as control. In vitro study: ICC cell lines (HuCCT-1 and CCKS-1) were used for proliferation and migration assay with the stimulation with SDF-1 andlor TNF-a with or without the presence of CXCR4 antagonist (AMD 3100). The regulation of CXCR4 expression by TNFa was determined by Western blot analysis and quantitative RT-PCR. Results: Human study: In the normal livers, SDF-1 was not expressed at all. SDF-1 was expressed weakly in both ICC and biliary epithelium in stone-containing bile ducts in hepatolithiasis. SDF-1 expression was significantly increased in the stromal cells at the invasive front of ICC. The expression of CXCR4 and TNF-a was up-regulated in both of ICC and biliary epithelium in the hepatolithiasis. In vitro study: By administration of SDF-1 (100nglml) migration of ICC cells was up-regulated but proliferation did not change. Both of cell proliferation and migration of ICC cells were up-regulated by TNF-a (tionglml). Combined administration of SDF-1 and TNF-(U increased migration and proliferation of ICC cells significantly when compared with only either of them. Cell migration induced by TNF-a and SDF-1 was suppressed completely by AMD3100. CXCR4 mRNA and protein were significantly up-regulated by TNF-a 8-fold over control in ICC cells. Conclusion: 1) Chronic inflammation in hepatolithiasis increased the expression of TNF-a and CXCR4 in biliary epithelium and ICC. 2) The expression of SDF-1 was significantly increased in the stromal cell at the invasive front of ICC. 3) Proliferation and migration ability of ICC cells were significantly increased after the stimulation of TNF-a and SDF-I. 4) CXCR4 mRNA was up-regulated by the stimulation of TNF-a. Taken together, these findings suggest that SDF-lICXCR4 system and TNF-a may accelerate the proliferation and invasion or migration of ICC arising in hepatolithiasis showing cholangitis. ",

            "text": "Center, ]mcsalem, Israel Background: NKT lymphocytes, a subset of regulatory T cells that recognize CDld-presented glycolipids on antigen presenting cells, have a role in anti-tumor immunity. Glucocerebroside (GC) is a naturally occurring glycolipid that exerts an immune modulatory effect on NKT lymphocytes. Aims: To determine the clinical and immunological effects of administration of GC in a murine model of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Methods: Athymic BalbIC mice (n=lO/group) were sublethally irradiated and transplanted with human Hep3B HCC. Mice were treated by daily intraperitoneal injections of GC (1.5pg in 1OOpl PBS) or PBS (100pl,), and were followed for survival, and tumor size. To assess the immunological effect of GC administration, intrahepatic and intrasplenic lymphocyte populations were analyzed by FACS for NKT, CD4, and CD8 markers; serum cytokine levels were measured by ELISA; and expression of the transcription factors STATI, STAT4 and STAT6 in splenocytes was assessed by western blot. Results: Administration of GC led to significant suppression of HCC. Survival rates were 80% and 50% in the GC-treated and untreated groups, respectively (p<O.O5). Following three weeks of treatment, tumor volume was significantly decreased in GCtreated animals compared with untreated controls (71.41mm3 vs. 129.14 mm3, respectively, p<0.05). FACS analysis of peripheral and intrahepatic lymphocytes revealed an eleven fold increase in intrahepatic NKT lymphocyte number of GC-treated vs. untreated animals (14.64% vs. 1.28%, respectively, p<0.05), and a 43% decrease in peripheral NKT lymphocyte number. The peripherallintrahepatic CD4lCD8 lymphocyte ratio was decreased in GC-treated mice compared to controls (1.63 vs. 1.93, P<0.05), consistent with an increased number of peripheral CDBt T lymphocytes. Serum levels of IFNy were increased in GC-treated animals compared to controls. Expression of STATI, a marker for IFNy activity, was observed in GC-treated animals, but not in controls. An opposite effect was observed in expression of STAT6, a marker for IL4 activity, occurring in untreated but not in GCtreated animals. No differences were noted in STAT 4 expression. Conclusions: GC suppressed HCC in mice, an effect that was associated with altered distributions of regulatory NKT lymphocytes and CD8+ T cells, and a shift towards Thl-type immunity. The beneficial effect of GC suggests that in tumor harboring hosts, NKT cells may contribute to an inadequate anti-tumor immune response. Immune modulation by GC may correct this aberration, thereby promoting an effective anti-tumor immune response. ",
