The proposed framework could be referenced as a basis for future research on the topic. Muntjir et al.

Within this definition, the basic building blocks that the IoT consists of are presented as the sensing objects used in the measurement of metrics such as flow, pressure, temperature position and vibration, and the network that communicates the result to a higher decision-making engine. The same definition applies to the IIoT domain; the only difference is that the IIoT is mostly focused on industrial applications.",

These devices consist of hardware and software components. There could be machine-to-machine communication within the device level, and the various communication protocols are of relevance.

This framework included the needed IIoT architecture while considering the specific hardware, software, security and communication aspects. Within this framework, there was also a consideration in terms of pre-, during and post-implementation aspects and explored the advantages, disadvantages and training in terms of the IIoT.
