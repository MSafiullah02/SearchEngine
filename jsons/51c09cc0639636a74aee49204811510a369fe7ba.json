These results are consistent with previ-ous studies that suggest that non-emergency, primary care ED presentations are not a major determinant of ED overcrowding. 3 1. Gray D. Ministers push for action on emergency wards. The nature of the relation between GP services and ED attendances has never been clearly defined, but it is likely to be complex. Similarly, the nature of ED workloads is also complex, and more than just a matter of the total attendances. 2 In the Journal last year, Cameron and Campbell cited the major causes of access block and overcrowding as being the reduction in hospital beds and aged care facilities, along with changes in workforce and community attitudes. 3 In that issue, the Journal published a series of articles that essentially represented a national audit of responses to ED overcrowding. Only one article described the opening of a GP clinic as a response; the authors noted that this was unsuccessful in reducing access block. 4 Thus, the findings of Hanson and colleagues are neither new nor surpris-Effect of general practice bulkbilling presentations on average daily emergency department presentations, Dawson electorate, Queensland LETTERS ing. Overcrowding is the single most important barrier to quality in ED care. It is a symptom of a serious and growing mismatch between demand and supply for acute healthcare services. Solutions require a whole-of-systems approach. Efforts to improve the flow of patients through acute-care hospital beds are needed, as are strategies to divert some current inpatient flow to communitybased subacute services. There is an important role to be played by GPs in coordinating the management of patients with chronic and complex health problems, to reduce the demand for acute-care admissions to hospital, and in working in partnership with the acute-care sector in coordinating community-based subacute alternatives to hospital care. Such initiatives will only come about if state and Commonwealth governments and health departments work together. Emerging evidence suggests other changes in the epidemiology of asthma in Australia. Rober tson recently reported a 26% decrease in the prevalence of asthma in Melbourne school children between 1993 and 2002, but increased reporting of rhinitis and eczema over the same period. 1 The significance of these findings is difficult to interpret without measures of airway function. A second study supported these results and also observed a small decline in the prevalence of parentreported asthma, but found little change in atopy or airway hyperresponsiveness. 2 Age-adjusted hospital separation rates for asthma decreased by 31.1% in young people and 31.4% in all ages between 1989-90 and 1999-00. 3 There is little evidence of improved management of asthma in the general practice setting. Data published from the BEACH (Bettering the Evaluation and Care of Health) survey of general practice activity indicates a significant reduction in rates of presentation for asthma among children but not adults, with no changes in indicators of severity over time. 4 Our recent research in south-western Sydney, examining uptake of the \"asthma 3+ visit plan\" 5,6 by general practitioners and their patients, is disappointing. It suggests reluctance on the part of both GPs and patients to participate in the plan.",

This is not the case, and the letter by Lontos et al 1 does not state that either. The reason the TGA did not test initially for pulegone was because it is a minor constituent of the essential oil of ground ivy. We did not expect there to be any significant levels of this compound. In fact, we have subsequently confirmed that pulegone was not detectable (limit of detection 5 ppm) in the sample of ground ivy extract provided by Lontos et al.",

In Australia, where we have a well-developed reporting system, there have been several reports of liver problems in patients taking various preparat ions conta ining b la ck coh osh.

The first, and quite critical one, is that we cannot be certain that the patient was given the same herbal materials as those supplied to the Therapeutic Goods Administration (TGA) for analysis. The pharmacist who dispensed the herbal formula for the patient provided the TGA with samples for analysis of each of the five individual extracts in the formula. Documentary evidence supporting the correct identity of the five herbs was supplied in the form of certificates of analysis from the manufacturers of the individual herbal extracts. However, it was not possible to ascertain whether the exact batch of the exact formulation taken by the patient was that which was tested by the TGA.While the title of the article by Lontos et al suggests a \"problem\" with black cohosh, the body of the article makes clear that the causative agent(s) are unknown, 1 MJA on the Internet: http://www.mja.com.au/ None of the Australasian Medical Publishing Company Proprietary Limited, ABN 20 000 005 854, the Australian Medical Association Limited, or any of its servants and agents will have any liability in any way arising from information or advice that is contained in The Medical Journal of Australia (MJA).
