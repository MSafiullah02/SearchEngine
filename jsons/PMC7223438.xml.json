Continuous data elements are expressed as mean (standard deviation [SD]) or median [interquartile range (IQR)] as appropriate. Categorical data elements are reported as proportions. To quantify the extent of the relatedness in case-mix between the development and validation samples, a binary logistic regression model (membership model) was created to predict the probability that an individual record belonged to either sample.22 Independent variables were the predictors and outcome from the prediction model. The discriminative ability of the model was quantified using its C-statistic with lower values indicating similarity between the data sets.",

It was calculated as the logistic regression model intercept given that the calibration slope equals 1 (logit(y)=a + logit(\u0177)).22,23 Where calibration-in-the-large was significantly different from 0, intercept recalibration was performed by fitting a new logistic regression model with an intercept only and an offset term for the linear predictor. Calibration slope reflects whether predicted risks are appropriately scaled with respect to each other over the entire range of possible values. It was estimated from the recalibration model equation logit(y)=a + boverall logit(\u0177).22,24 Loess-based calibration plots were created with predicted risk on the x-axis and observed mortality on the y-axis to illustrate the agreement across the range of predicted risks.23 Discrimination refers to the ability of the prediction model to separate individuals that died and those that survived.

Values between 0.7 and 0.8 are generally considered to reflect acceptable discrimination25 and in the case of this membership model, represent a data set that is somewhat related to the development data set, but not strongly so where a C-statistic of < 0.7 would be expected. This is confirmed by some key differences illustrated in Table 2. Specifically, the development population was younger, had a different source distribution (less from the operating room and emergency department, more from the ward and referrals from other hospitals), as well as higher levels of organ dysfunction upon admission, daily nurse workload, readmission, and ICU mortality. Admitting diagnosis also differed between the data sets with the development sample having a higher proportion of admissions for respiratory issues and a lesser proportion of cardiovascular-related admissions.",

Many potential indicators will not require risk or case-mix adjustment, while this will be needed for most patient-related outcomes such as mortality and length of stay. We caution against use of  simple rank ordering or comparisons of one unit to another since regression models, such as the one we report, provide an estimated risk based on the average of the entire cohort. While our recalibration has reduced the bias across this cohort, estimates for subgroups or individual ICUs will remain biased. As can be seen in our data, it appears that teaching hospitals perform worse than average, community hospitals with high ventilator usage perform better than average, and cardiac units perform much better than average. Nevertheless, this would be a false conclusion since the differences across subgroups must cancel out across the entire cohort. At most, evaluation of subgroups or individual ICU results should only be compared with the average estimated performance and include confidence intervals.3 Models could be recalibrated for specific ICU subtypes but this involves subjective categorization of units and will not resolve the bias for individual ICUs. One randomized trial used quantiles to identify achievable performance levels for groups of units and reported improved performance in individual units.34 Ultimately, we believe that models such as these should be used to monitor performance over time only within individual ICUs. One such approach incorporates risk-adjusted measures into statistical process control methods.35,36",

First, the breadth of the units that submit data to the CCIS allows for testing of both reproducibility (similar ICU subtype groups) and transportability (different ICU subtype groups), and the size of the CCIS data set provided ample statistical power for the required analyses. The TRIPOD framework indicates that a model\u2019s predictive performance should be evaluated in relation to subgroups of interest, such as age or sex, specific settings or population rather than just across all individuals combined, which can mask any deficiencies in the model.19 It is increasingly recognized that the predictive performance of a model tends to vary across settings, populations, and periods,22,31,37,38 which implies there is often heterogeneity in model performance and that multiple external validation studies are needed to fully appreciate the generalizability of a prediction model.22 In this study, we have conducted subgroup analyses for each ICU subtype to evaluate performance in specific ICU patient populations. Another strength is adherence to the TRIPOD guidelines, which include references to appropriate analytic methods and complete reporting of the results.15,22,39,40 Next, both MODS and NEMS are relatively easy to collect, making this prediction tool more apt for risk-adjustment compared with more complex scoring systems. MODS requires only eight routinely collected variables and, in contrast to SOFA, is not dependent on treatment.41 NEMS assesses ICU resource utilization and efficiency that has been validated as a nurse workload measure in large cohorts of ICU patients.42 It is easy to use with minimum inter-observer variability,9,42 but has not been evaluated as a mortality or risk prediction tool.",

Linkage to other data sets containing comorbidity data such as the Canadian Institute for Health Informatics Discharge Abstract Database could resolve this limitation, but we did not have access to identifiable patient information and such linkage was not possible. Another limitation is that, although ICU mortality is a proximal metric that can be used to evaluate quality of care in the ICU and ultimately improve patient outcomes, ICU survival is not a patient-centred goal. We found a low frequency of patients within the range of severity where mortality is over-predicted; however, this would need to be monitored regularly to ensure that results are interpreted correctly. Also, we could not evaluate the burn ICU subtype group accurately because of the low number of deaths. Finally, although there are no published studies on the accuracy of the CCIS data, we previously reported that inter-observer variability in data collection appears to be randomly distributed.43",
