However, the intrinsically slow PCR test requires additional sequencing procedures to differentiate viral phenotypes, which may squander the time needed for quarantine and isolation. Centralized diagnosis systems and expertise are also needed to obtain results from the PCR test. In this study, we report a simple rapid diagnostic kit with an accuracy of >99% and an operation time of <30 min that can differentiate HPAIV from LPAIV and could potentially revolutionize control practices for influenza outbreaks.",

Our rapid and sensitive diagnostic test for the differentiation of HPAIV and LPAIV is based on the fundamental difference in the membrane fusion mechanisms of HPAIV and LPAIV.8, 9, 10 HPAIV and LPAIV show a distinct structural difference in the basic cleavage site of HA, which is a surface glycoprotein of the influenza virus that plays a crucial role in receptor binding and membrane fusion.11, 12, 13 The inactive form of HA (HA0), expressed as an uncleaved homotrimer, can be cleaved by proteases to generate HA1 and HA2, thus exposing the fusion peptide of the conserved cleavage sequence of the stalk domain. This cleavage is essential for HA activation, which eventually leads to membrane fusion under low pH conditions. We recognized that LPAIV contains a monobasic cleavage site that can be cleaved by trypsin\u2010like serine proteases, whereas HPAIV typically possesses a polybasic cleavage site that can be activated not only by trypsin\u2010like serine proteases but also by furin\u2010like proteases. To utilize between LPAIV and HPAIV in the enzyme activities at the cleavage sites, we fabricated a cell\u2010mimetic polymersome (called \u201cFluSome\u201d) containing fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) pair fluorophores (3,3\u2032\u2010dioctadecyloxacarbocyanine perchlorate (DiO) and DiI) that can be fused with the virus membrane (Figure\n\n1\na). Upon fusion, FRET FluSome changes its fluorescence emission from orange (565 nm) to green (504 nm), which enables visual identification of HPAIV or LPAIV.",

HA2 pulls the viral envelope and endosomal membrane together via energy conversion of HA from a metastable high\u2010energy prefusion state to a low\u2010energy membrane fusion state, which mediates the release of viral ribonucleoprotein particles into the cytoplasm (Figure 1b).",

HPAIV can be defined as having multiple basic amino acids at the HA cleavage site, whereas LPAIV has mono basic amino acids. In HPAIV, the number of basic amino acids (arginine and lysine) can be increased by specific mutations or insertions of amino acids at the cleavage site.16 The HA of HPAIV can be cleaved by ubiquitous furin\u2010like endoproteases, which increases the ability of the virus to be infective in extra intestinal and extra respiratory tissues and promotes systemic viral replication.17 By contrast, LPAIV has a restricted tissue tropism because its HA can only be cleaved by trypsin\u2010like proteases, limiting viral replication to the respiratory system.",

The fluorescence intensities were integrated as a function of time. The obtained time traces of the two fluorophores, including all characteristic features of the FRET FluSome event, are depicted in Figure 2g. Influenza virus binds to host cell through sialic acid in natural environment. In this FluSome assay, however, fusion of FluSome and the influenza virus occurs by the fusion peptide within the virus, not by sialic acid.21 Prior to FRET FluSome docking, low and insignificant fluorescence was observed for DiO and calcein. When FRET FluSome approached the surface and docked, a sudden increase in DiO fluorescence occurred, whereas the calcein fluorescence remained unaffected. At the onset of fusion, the calcein intensity transiently increased in conjunction with a small transient decrease in the DiO fluorescence intensity. These changes are caused by the FRET that occurs between the DiO and calcein dyes when the outer leaflet of FRET FluSome starts mixing with the outer leaflet of the pore\u2010spanning membrane (DiO). After this first transient change in DiO and calcein fluorescence, the fluorescence intensity remained at the same level. These fluorescence time traces can be attributed to an intermediate hemifused state. In the hemifused state, the outer leaflets merged, whereas the inner leaflet of the calcein\u2010modified vesicle remained unaffected. Therefore, after the first merging of the outer leaflets, the DiO fluorescence intensity decreased to an intermediate intensity level as the DiO located in the outer leaflet of the vesicle diffused into the pore\u2010spanning membrane. Simultaneously, calcein diffused into the outer leaflet of the vesicle and moved away from the porous surface, which resulted in an increase in the calcein fluorescence intensity (Figure 2g).",

We examined the fluorescence intensity of FRET FluSome at 504 nm upon the addition of the HPAIV or LPAIV from a nasal swab in the presence of furin or trypsin at pH 5.0 (Figure\n\n3\na) In the absence of activated influenza virus, little variation in FRET efficiency was observed, which demonstrated the stability of FluSome. When FRET FluSome was mixed with activated influenza virus, a rapid increase in DiO fluorescence intensity was observed, as shown in Figure 3b, which indicates the fast release of DiO from FRET FluSome. We tested whether FRET FluSome can differentiate HPAIV from LPAIV. DiO emission appeared when HPAIV was treated with furin or with trypsin, whereas it was only observed for LPAIV with the trypsin treatment. We further incubated HPAIV and LPAIV with furin at pH 5.0, trypsin at pH 5.0, furin at pH 7.4, trypsin at pH 7.4, furin + trypsin at pH 5.0, furin + trypsin at pH 7.4, furin + fecal sample at pH 5.0, trypsin at pH 7.4, fecal sample at pH 5.0, and fecal sample at pH 7.4 in 96\u2010well plates, and we determined the fluorescence intensity 30 min postactivation. As reflected by the measured photon flux, FRET FluSome could be completely disrupted by activated influenza virus (Figure 3c). These results demonstrated the potential of using FRET FluSome to detect HPAIV and LPAIV.",

The fusion of activated influenza virus with FRET FluSome was measured by the degree of fluorescence dequenching of DiO. The fluorescence intensity after the addition of Triton X\u2010100 was used to define 100% fusion. FRET FluSome had a mean apparent fusion efficiency of 15% with total FRET FluSome. We first performed experiments to determine the fusion efficiency of i) HPAIV + furin with the addition of FluSome, ii) LPAIV + furin with the addition of FluSome, iii) HPAIV + trypsin with the addition of FluSome, and iv) LPAIV + trypsin with the addition of FluSome at different temperatures and at pH 5.0 and 7.4 (Figure\n\n4\na). The fusion efficiency at 37 \u00b0C was nearly twofold higher than at 25 \u00b0C. The fusion efficiency at 42 \u00b0C was not significantly different from the efficiency at 37 \u00b0C (Figure 4a,i,iii,iv). There was no significant fusion activity for LPAIV + furin with the addition of FluSome at pH 5.0 and 7.4 at any of the tested temperatures (Figure 4a,ii). We next performed experiments on the fusion efficiency of i) HPAIV + furin with the addition of FluSome, ii) LPAIV + furin with the addition of FluSome, iii) HPAIV + trypsin with the addition of FluSome, and iv) LPAIV + trypsin with the addition of FluSome for different concentrations of FluSome at pH 5.0 and 7.4 ( 4b). The results indicate that both concentrations of FRET FluSome resulted in increasing fusion efficiency until 10 mg mL\u22121. Concentrations greater than 10 mg mL\u22121 did not increase the fusion efficiency. Therefore, the optimum concentration of FRET FluSome was 10 mg mL\u22121.",

This docking allowed for rapid distinction between HPAIV and LPAIV. As mentioned above, HPAIV can be activated both trypsin\u2010like serine proteases and furin\u2010like proteases. However, activated LPAIV only needs trypsin\u2010like serine proteases. Regardless of whether the virus is activated, we can identify the virus type by the presence of \u03b1\u2010helices, which were sufficient for crossing cell membranes and delivering the virus to the cytoplasm of cells.22, 23 We fabricated a diagnostic tool called FluSome that included a cell\u2010mimetic structure to mimic the \u03b1\u2010helical conformation of the activated fusion peptide to monitor the fusion of activated influenza viruses. This tool is a single\u2010step detection test using FluSome and direct visualization. Therefore, FluSome is a novel and time\u2010saving diagnostic tool improving the sensitivity comparable to RT\u2010PCR, and this facilitates early preventative procedures for controlling HPAIV outbreaks, which currently depends on time\u2010consuming RT\u2010PCR and genomic sequencing to confirm HPAIV.",
