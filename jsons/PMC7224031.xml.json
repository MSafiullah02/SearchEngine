            "text": "Virus-like particles (VLPs) have emerged as promising nanoparticles, particularly in the field of new recombinant vaccines (Mohsen et al. 2017). Compared with other conventional vaccines such as live-attenuated or inactivated viruses, VLPs can elicit potent antibody and T cell responses in a safe manner since they do not contain genetic material from the virus itself (Andersson et al. 2018). Among the different proteins able to self-assemble as VLPs, the group-specific antigen (Gag) polyprotein has demonstrated a wide applicability in different research areas. These include their use as immunogens (Young and Ross 2006), drug delivery vehicles (Deo et al. 2015), scaffolds for surface antigen presentation (Vidigal et al. 2018), and research surrogates (Buonaguro et al. 2013). A common need in all these applications is the understanding of the production system itself, which is paramount to define the most adequate conditions for VLP production.",

In the frame of initiatives such as Process Analytical Technologies (PAT), the application of new and more sophisticated characterization technologies will be a powerful tool to increase the understanding of how the process conditions influence the quality of the final product. Nanoparticle tracking analysis (NTA) and flow virometry are gaining interest as tools to monitor the production of different particles, including VLPs (Nika et al. 2019; Pereira Aguilar et al. 2019). To date, most of the studies dealing with VLP production are performed with indirect quantification methods based on monomer detection, which hinder the appropriate assessment of the final product and the yields obtained (Haynes et al. 2009; Pillay et al. 2009; Visciano et al. 2011). In addition, the simultaneous production of extracellular vesicles (EV), which frequently fall in the size range of VLPs, is not often considered and may lead to an erroneous estimation of VLP titers. With the aim to deepen in the characterization of the different existing nanoparticle populations, the eGFP was fused in frame to the gag gene from the human immunodeficiency virus serotype 1 (HIV-1).",

            "text": "Considering the information from previous reports, we decided to apply these novel techniques for optimizing the Gag VLP production process using the High Five/BEVS platform. Different methods are available for process improvement, from the classical one-variable-at-a-time approach to more sophisticated statistical design of experiments (DoE) (Puente-Massaguer et al. 2019). So far, VLP production studies have focused either on the former approach (Krammer et al. 2010; Pushko et al. 2017) or on simple factorial designs (Pillay et al. 2009; Pastor et al. 2019), limiting the analysis of higher order effects between the variables influencing VLP production. This is of special relevance since the use of lower or higher MOI than strictly required might reduce the maximum VLP yield obtained or be detrimental to the system, respectively. Here, we applied a response surface methodology (RSM) to evaluate the impact of cell concentration at infection (CCI), multiplicity of infection (MOI), and time of harvest (TOH) on VLP production. To go a step further in process understanding, the inclusion of several responses during process optimization has shown successful results and applicability in different research areas (Pinzi et al. 2011; Honary et al. 2014; Bukzem et al. 2016). Particularly, the three responses considered in addition to VLP production were VLP assembly, baculovirus infection, and VLP productivity. These are of special relevance in processes with recombinant baculovirus since it is desirable to define production conditions encompassing high production yields with an acceptable ratio of correctly assembled Gag in the form of VLPs, but at the same time maintaining high productivities. A multiple-criteria decision analysis (MCDA) was implemented to combine the RSM-optimized responses into a global optimal set of conditions based on two criteria: quantity and quality. The two optimal production conditions were successfully validated, and the quantity optimum was compared with other Gag VLP production strategies using the High Five/BEVS. Finally, the correct formation and morphology of the VLPs produced was characterized using cryogenic transmission electron microscopy (cryo-TEM). The results presented in this work represent an advance with respect to current literature related to Gag VLP production in the High Five/BEVS and provide useful insights into nanoparticle-based process characterization.",

Considering the extent of the exponential phase and the Td, the range for cell concentration at infection was restricted to 0.5\u20132.5 \u00d7 106 cells/mL. Some difficulties were encountered when defining the different levels of multiplicity of infection (MOI) and time of harvest (TOH) since very little information on the use of the BEVS with High Five cells in the Sf900III medium was available. The ranges for both variables were eventually fixed according to previous experience with this system (data not shown) and based on studies of the High Five/BEVS in other cell culture media (Sander and Harrysson 2007; Pillay et al. 2009). The MOI experimental range was fixed between 0.01 and 5 with the aim to screen low and high MOI conditions in the same DoE. In the case of TOH, the boundaries were defined as 24\u201384 hpi. DoE space boundaries did not involve high CCI out of the exponential phase or medium exchange in order to simplify their industrial application, but these conditions were evaluated as a contrast to the optimal conditions obtained as further presented.",

This experimental design was selected among different candidates due to its variance distribution and spatial properties (Cervera et al. 2015a; Guti\u00e9rrez-Granados et al. 2016; Puente-Massaguer et al. 2018). The resulting matrix consisted in 15 experiments including a triplicated center point to account for the inherent variability of the system (Table 1). The different datasets were adjusted to the second-order polynomial functions by the least squares method according to Eq. 3. The statistical significance of the different functions and their associated coefficients was confirmed by ANOVA (Table 1). Each function was used to construct three-dimensional plots for a better comprehension of the synergies between CCI, MOI, and TOH (Fig. 2). As expected, baculovirus infection progressed more rapidly with increasing MOI (Fig. 2a\u2013c). However, the pace of infection decreased when using the same MOI at higher CCI. A similar behavior was observed between VLP production and VLP productivity (Fig. 2d\u2013i). Low MOI required longer TOH to achieve higher VLP yields, whereas higher MOI shortened this period. In both cases, the best production and productivity titers were obtained in the 1.5\u20132.5 \u00d7 106 cell/mL CCI range. TOH also proved to be the most significant variable regarding the amount of GageGFP monomer assembled in the form of VLPs (Fig. 2j\u2013l).

In this case, different independent variable combinations resulted in the optimum condition for each function (Table 2), thus making difficult to define a global optimum condition combining all the different models at once. Therefore, a multiple-criteria decision analysis (MCDA) based on desirability functions was applied in order to determine a global optimum combining the different functions. Every model function was transformed to a dimensionless scale (Eq. 4) and given a weight according to the importance of each response. A higher priority was assigned to VLP production, VLP assembly, and VLP productivity (w = 2), while a lower restriction was assigned to infection (w = 1). Two possible response combinations were considered in the MCDA, the first focused on maximizing product quantity and the second one maximizing product quality. To do this, the VLP assembly function was excluded from the MCDA in the definition of a global optimal condition targeting product quantity. The application of the MCDA for the product quality optimum resulted in a CCI, MOI, and TOH of 1.1 \u00d7 106 cell/mL, 1 pfu/cell, and 33.6 hpi, respectively. The optimum maximizing product quantity was determined as 2.0 \u00d7 106 cell/mL for CCI, a MOI of 2.5 pfu/cell, and a TOH of 69.3 hpi.",

Also, the highest fluorescence yield in the supernatant was achieved with the quantity optimum (2448.6 \u00b1 23.8 RFU) at 69.3 hpi (Fig. 4a). The TOH for the quality optimum condition coincided with the peak of intracellular GageGFP production, but not for the quantity optimum. In all cases, GageGFP production in the supernatant progressively increased with longer TOH, although the intracellular GageGFP levels reached a maximum concentration that subsequently decreased (Fig. 4b). Analysis of the VLP production process of the quantity optimum by flow virometry evidenced that there was a continuous increase in VLP concentration (Fig. 4c). Comparison of VLP production in both optima by means of nanoparticle tracking analysis (NTA) yielded a 10-fold and 4.8-fold increase in production and productivity in the quantity over the quality optimum, respectively. In all cases, the experimental outcome was within the predicted limits (Table 3). Similar ratios of VLPs to total nanoparticles were observed, representing a 9.7 \u00b1 3.1% for the quality and a 9.3 \u00b1 1.1% for the quantity condition. In contrast, analysis of the optima by sucrose cushion ultracentrifugation showed a 4.9-fold increase of GageGFP monomer assembled in the form of VLPs in the quality optimum (64.6 \u00b1 5.1%).

However, multiplying this fluorescence value by the VLP assembly factor calculated by analytical ultracentrifugation (Table 3) allowed to determine the GageGFP fluorescence exclusively attributed to VLPs (323.2 \u00b1 3.1 RFU) and discard that of unassembled GageGFP monomer.

Supernatant characterization of the quality and quantity optima by cryogenic transmission electron microscopy (cryo-TEM) indicated that VLPs were correctly formed in both conditions (Fig. 5).

The first approach consisted in infecting High Five cells at a high cell concentration and MOI. To this purpose, High Five cells were infected at 6 \u00d7 106 cell/mL with a MOI of 5. The second strategy consisted in performing a medium replacement before infection using the quantity optimum. This option was considered as a means to value if the added effort of performing a medium replacement would provide a substantial advantage in VLP concentration. Both conditions were not examined in the DoE in order to avoid the added difficulties required at process level, but were compared with the quantity optimum as a contrast since they have been used in the literature. Baculovirus infection progressed more rapidly after medium exchange than in the original condition but the drop in cell viability was not significantly affected (Fig. 6a\u2013b). On the other hand, baculovirus infection advanced more slowly in the high CCI condition, to the point that cell culture was not fully infected after 72 hpi. Medium exchange before infection increased GageGFP production by 1.3-fold at 69.3 hpi, corresponding to 3168.6 \u00b1 100.2 RFU in comparison with the 2528.0 \u00b1 76.3 RFU achieved in the quantity condition (Fig. 6c\u2013d).

Pillay and co-workers used a factorial experiment to assess the effect of different MOI comprised in the range of 0.1\u20135 in High Five cells (Pillay et al. 2009). They did not identify any significant difference in Gag yield, but here we observed that MOI plays a significant role in VLP production.

To this purpose, two different global optimization strategies were examined by MCDA, one considering the VLP assembly function (therefore with priority on product quality) and the other not (therefore with priority on product quantity). Remarkable differences were encountered between the two optima, achieving a 10-fold higher VLP production in the quantity condition, whereas a 4.9-fold increase in the assembly of GageGFP as VLPs was obtained in the quality optimum. Then, it is evident that High Five cells possess a high capacity to produce GageGFP, but there is a remarkable competition between the formation of VLPs and the release of unassembled GageGFP monomer. The large amount of GageGFP produced, potentially overcoming the capacity of the cell line itself to process all the GageGFP in the form of VLPs, combined to cell membrane disruption could be the reason explaining these results. This could be appreciated even in the quality optimum itself, in which a high cell viability of 92.4 \u00b1 0.6% was measured at harvest (33.6 hpi) (Fig. 3a) and a 64.6 \u00b1 5.1% of the fluorescence in the supernatant was associated to VLPs, meaning that around the 35% remaining was due to unassembled GageGFP monomer. These results emphasize the need to complement the methods most currently used for VLP identification or quantification based on monomer detection with direct nanoparticle assessment techniques, specially using the High Five cell line (Maranga et al. 2003; Pillay et al. 2009; Tagliamonte et al. 2010; Shoja et al. 2013; Monteiro et al. 2016; Fuenmayor et al. 2019).",

Cryo-TEM has recently been highlighted as powerful methodology for nanoparticle characterization as the different specimens can be observed in native conditions (Martin et al. 2016; Maldonado et al. 2016; Gallagher et al. 2018). GageGFP VLPs presented the expected size of 100\u2013200 nm and morphology consistent with immature HIV-1 VLPs, comparable with VLPs produced in Sf9 (Nika et al. 2017) and HEK 293 cells (Venereo-Sanchez et al. 2016). The rod-shaped structure corresponding to the infective form of the baculovirus was also detected. The presence of EVs was observed alongside VLPs, which are known to be produced as way of communication in eukaryotic cells (Ratajczak et al. 2006). EVs were more heterogeneous in size (50\u2013500 nm) and shape compared with VLPs and less electron-dense. These results coincide with the measurements performed by NTA and flow virometry where a remarkable population of non-fluorescent nanoparticles was detected. Future efforts are needed to understand their role in insect cell lines since little information is available.",

Thus, these conditions would be selected in case of designing a VLP manufacturing process. However, if the presence of baculoviruses posed a risk for the final VLP application, the quality optimum provides a 2.7-fold reduction in infectious particles, which would facilitate the downstream process. Difficulties were encountered in the comparison of the VLP titer obtained since most of the studies producing Gag VLPs with the insect cell/BEVS used indirect quantification methods based on monomer detection (Buonaguro et al. 2001; Pillay et al. 2009; Visciano et al. 2011). Nevertheless, when the comparison of nanoparticle production was possible, this optimum condition proved to be superior to Gag VLP production in HEK 293 cells without (Cervera et al. 2013) and with additive supplementation (Cervera et al. 2015a) by 14.4 and 1.7-fold, respectively. Moreover, these conditions proved to be superior to influenza VLP production using the Sf9 (Thompson et al. 2015) and High Five/BEVS (Carvalho et al. 2016) by 6.7 and 25-fold, respectively. The potential of the quantity optimum was also evaluated against other baculovirus infection strategies in this work. Infection at a high CCI using a high MOI resulted in a much lower yield of VLP production probably owing to the scarcity of some nutrients in the medium (Table 4). BV production was also significantly reduced in such conditions. These differences in production could be related to the cell density effect previously described in insect cells with the BEVS (Bernal et al. 2009; Huynh et al. 2013; Huynh et al. 2014). On the other side, medium replacement before BV infection moderately increased VLP production but duplicated baculovirus production. This strategy has proven to be an efficient manner to increase both the yield of recombinant proteins (Caron et al. 1990) and baculoviruses (Carinhas et al. 2009) with the Sf9/BEVS cells and also in mammalian cells (Bollin et al. 2011; Cervera et al. 2015b). In this case, no substantial benefit was obtained, thus indicating that the added efforts required to perform medium replacement might not be advantageous.",
