Node discovery for the spread of an infectious disease is defined as discriminating between the nodes which are neighboring to a missing disease spreader node, and the rest, given a dataset on the number of cases. The spread is described by stochastic differential equations. A perturbation theory quantifies the impact of the missing spreader on the moments of the number of cases. Statistical discriminators examine the mid-body or tail-ends of the probability density function, and search for the disturbance from the missing spreader. They are tested with computationally synthesized datasets, and applied to the SARS outbreak and flu pandemic.",

Hundreds were suffered from a pneumonia-like strange disease, some of which had been dead. Both Chinese government and Chinese media remained silent all the time as to the risk of a possible epidemic. No one in the rest of the world knew there was any real cause for alarm. But in March, local outbreaks of a mysterious disease were reported in Hong Kong and Southeast Asian countries. The World Health Organization (WHO) issued a global alert. Even then, health authorities could not reveal where the disease had come from. This story at the onset of the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) outbreak poses an interesting question. Is it possible to discover the presence of a missing disease spreader from the surveillance records on the cases in other regions? This study addresses such a node discovery problem for the spread of an infectious disease.",

            "text": "The spread of an infectious disease is a stochastic phenomenon in a spatially heterogeneous medium. Many mathematical models of disease transmission [Riley 2007 ] rely on an epidemiological compartment model and a metapopulation network model in formulating stochasticity and spatial heterogene-ity [Dangerfield 2009 ], [Sim\u00f5es 2008 ]. These models are described by a set of stochastic differential equations [Hufnagel 2004 ]. The analysis of the spread includes many tasks from reproduction to prediction. Reproduction of the actual spread [Christensen 2010] , [Isham 2010 ] is essential in understanding the role of a so-called super-spreader [Fujie 2007] , [Small 2006 ] and epidemiological thresholds [Parshani 2010] , [Colizza 2007 ]. This is a forward analysis. An inverse analysis includes estimating the transmission parameters from observation [Walker 2010] , [Keeling 2004 ]. Network profiling estimates the effectively decisive topology of a transportation network which governs the spread [Maeno 2010] . Network inference in a communication network [Rabbat 2008 ] is a similar problem. Statistical learning and computational Monte-Carlo simulation contribute to developing a reliable bio-surveillance system in a noisy environment [Reis 2003 ], detecting abnormal events [Takeuchi 2006 ] as an omen of the outbreak [Lu 2010] , and predicting the spread to aid the health authorities in containing the outbreak [Colizza 2006 ]. None of these, however, addresses the problem. Node discovery problem for a social network [Maeno 2009 ] is discovering a person who does not appear in the logs on communication, but actually influential to others in an organization. The substantial nature of the problem is the same as this. But the mathematical solution should be different entirely because of the difference in the mechanism of the spread.",

The missing spreader may be the place where the first patient appears (an index node) or not (an intermediate node). Its presence impedes the reproduction of the observed spread by an unperturbed mathematical model. The irreproducibility is rather the clue to solve the problem. Two statistical discriminators are invented. Their role is discriminating between the nodes which are neighboring to the missing spreader node, and the rest (non-neighboring nodes), given a dataset. It is a collection of the time sequence data on the number of cases, or on the cumulative number of new cases, at the nodes within the scope of surveillance in the early growth phase of the spread. The network topology and transmission parameters may be given as an input to the discriminators. Or they may be unknown and must be estimated. The discriminators examine the mid-body or the tail-ends of the probability density function of the number of cases, and search for disturbed time sequence data to which the perturbation gives rise. The mid-body discriminator is founded on the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test. The tail-end discriminator is founded on the Chauvenet rejection test. The discriminators are tested with a number of computationally synthesized datasets, and applied to the WHO datasets on the SARS outbreak and on the flu pandemic (H1N1 swine influenza A) in 2009.",

The geographical regions are the nodes n i (i = 0, 1, \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 ). The transportation between two regions is a pair of unidirectional links. The adjacency matrix l, whose i-th row and j-th column element is l ij , determines the network topology. If a link from n i to n j is present, l ij is 1. If absent, l ij is 0.

Figure 1 a, b shows the receiver operating characteristic curves for N = 10 when the missing spreader node n 10 is an index node. The tail-end discriminator works excellently both when \u03b8 is given and unknown. The best performance is R TP \u2212 R FP \u2248 1. The mid-body discriminator is the most suitable when \u03b8 is given. The best performance is R TP \u2212 R FP \u2248 1 for given \u03b8, and \u2248 0.2 for unknown \u03b8. Figure 1 c, d shows the curves for N = 30 when the missing spreader node n 30 is an index node. Figure 1 e, f shows the curves for N = 10 when the missing spreader node n 10 is an intermediate node. Discrimination is not as excellent as that in a, b, but excellent moderately. The best performance of the tail-end discriminator is R TP \u2212 R FP \u2248 0.9 for given \u03b8, and \u2248 0.7 for unknown \u03b8. The best performance of the mid-body discriminator is R TP \u2212 R FP \u2248 0.65 for given \u03b8. The intermediate node and its neighboring nodes look alike as sinks of infected travelers indistinguishably. This is in strong contrast to the index node which is a salient source of them.",

In the simple network in 3.2, this results in m i (t d+1 |\u03b8, 0) \u223c m i (t d+1 |\u03b8, \u03b3 \u2032 ) and v ij (t d+1 |\u03b8, 0) \u223c v ij (t d+1 |\u03b8, \u03b3 \u2032 ), consequently z n \u223c 0 and (z n \u2212 z n ) 2 \u223c 1, rather than eq.(8) and (9). This is confirmed by measuring the moments with the datasets. The measured moments are shown in Appendix C. When a missing spreader node is absent, the moments for given \u03b8 are almost the same as those for the estimator\u03b8. The estimator reproduces the spread accurately. The moments are m i \u2248 0 and v ii = 1. On the other hand, the difference in every moment between neighboring nodes and non-neighboring nodes for the estimator\u03b8 is much smaller than that for given \u03b8 when the missing spreader node is an index node. The difference in m i , and that in v ii are so small that n n can not be distinguished from n a by examining the lower order moments. This is the reason why the mid-body discriminator is not suitable if \u03b8 is unknown. Furthermore, the difference in every moment between neighboring nodes and non-neighboring nodes is particularly small when the missing spreader node is an intermediate node. Discovering a missing intermediate node is a hard problem. Figure 2 a, b shows the curves when the number of data is D = 33. Accuracy is the same as that in Figure 1 a, b . It does not depend on these experimental conditions. Figure 2 c, d shows the curves when the reproductive ratio is r = 8, which is four times larger than the value in Figure 1 a, b . The best performance of the tail-end discriminator is R TP \u2212 R FP \u2248 0.95 for given \u03b8, and \u2248 0.85 for unknown \u03b8. The best performance of the mid-body discriminator is R TP \u2212 R FP \u2248 0.95 for given \u03b8. There is a small degradation in accuracy, but discrimination is still excellent. Figure 2 e, f shows the curves when the fraction is \u03b3 = 0.4, which is four times larger than the value in Figure 1 a, b. The accuracy is the same as that in Figure 1 a, b .",

            "text": "Somehow these tendencies are contrary to the results so far. Recall that the fluctuation term in eq.(19) is discarded in the approximation of eq.(7). The term is more complex than a mere Gaussian white noise because its amplitude includes I i (t), and the ensemble of sample trajectories I i (t) does not obey a multi-variate normal distribution in eq.(1) for large t. Eq. (7) is correct on the average, but the conversion of the higher order moments from \u2206J i (t d ) to I i (t d ) is inaccurately distortive. It is the reason why the tail-end discriminator is only moderately excellent, and the shape of the curve looks awkward when \u03b8 is given. On the other hand, when \u03b8 is unknown, the estimator\u03b8 may be able to make up for the distortion in the higher order moments. The tail-end discriminator with the estimator\u03b8 outperforms the discriminators for given \u03b8. Even if the true parameters are given, adjusting the parameters is rather indispensable for excellent discrimination from \u2206J i (t d ). Substantial improvement of eq.(7) is beyond the scope of this study and for future challenge. Figure 4 a, b shows R TP \u2212 R FP as a function of the discrimination threshold L * or T * when \u03b8 is given. The rising edges of the three curves coincide with each other. L * = \u22123 to \u22123.5, and T * = 1.5 to 2 are reasonable if there is no prior information on the presence or absence of a missing spreader node. If the assumption is grounded well that an index node is missing, there is a distinct optimal threshold L * = \u22124, and T * = 2.1. Figure 4 c, d shows R TP \u2212 R FP when \u03b8 is unknown. Setting L * = \u22123 to \u22123.5 is reasonable. The position of the falling edges of the curves in c, d are different from that in a, b. There is a distinct optimal threshold L * = \u22123.4 for a missing index node. Figure 5 a, b shows the optimal thresholds L * and T * as a function of the transmission parameters r (\u03b1 and \u03b2) and \u03b3. Figure 5 c, d shows the optimal thresholds L * and T * as a function of the number of nodes N . The optimal thresholds depend on r. This means that it is practical to find the optimal threshold experimentally, which is suitable for individual conditions. The dependence on \u03b3 and N is so small that the dependence can be ignored. with \u2206t = 1 is given as a dataset. a, b, the missing spreader node n 10 is an index node, and I 10 (0) = 200. c, d, n 10 is not an index node but an intermediate node, and I 0 (0) = 200.

Guangdong was a spreader which had not been known to the rest of the world in the early growth phase. This is illustrated by an example of the uncovered chains of transmission. Two of the index patients in Toronto in Canada and another three of the index patients in United States stayed a hotel in Hong Kong, where a Chinese nephrologist, who had treated many patients in Guangzhou in Guangdong and become infected, was staying in late February 2 . This implies that China was influential potentially in infecting Hong Kong, United States, and Canada. The large amount of passenger traffic between south China and Southeast Asian countries is supposed to affect the spread in these countries. On the other hand, the disturbance is not evident in the data for European countries. It is highly probable that the discovered signal of perturbation originates in the transmission between China, a missing spreader node, and north Pacific Rim countries.",

It is postulated that the law in eq.(14) holds true for the pandemic. Table 3 shows the calculated test statistics, the mean, variance, skewness, and kurtosis of z i for the 22 regions. The lower order moments averaged over the all regions are m i = \u22120.11 and v ii = 1.3. The entire dataset is not disturbed. The lower order moments tend to be anomalous for United States and Mexico, while the higher order moments are anomalously large for Canada. Irregularly, Japan has large absolute values of both lower and higher order moments. The higher order moments for South American countries tend to be large while those for West European countries are small. This may be related to the seasonality for the tropics and north hemisphere. The estimated values of the parameters are\u03b1 = 0.88,\u03b2 = 0.77 (r = 1.2), and\u03b3 = 0.29. The optimal threshold L * = \u22124.2 is obtained in the experiment for this condition. Perturbation is discovered in the time sequence data for United States, Mexico, Canada, and Japan.

The number from Canada to United States by land is 7 times larger than that by air in 2005. The meta-population network model relies on eq.(14) which is known valid for the world-wide air transportation. The actual heavy land transportation lets the probability of movement across the border deviate from the value estimated in the model. This is supported by the result that the fraction\u03b3 is twice as large as that for the SARS outbreak. The deviation imposes an impact on the speed of the spread at such cities near the border as San Ysidro CA, then inland cities, and finally such cities near another border as Buffalo-Niagara Falls NY [Balcan 2009 ]. The discovered signal of perturbation for United States, Mexico, and Canada could originate in a localized exception to the empirical law for the probability of movement, rather than a missing spreader node.",

On the other hand, the signal discovered by the discriminators satisfies the sufficient condition to ascertain the presence of a missing spreader node incompletely, although it satisfies the necessary conditions. Prior knowledge on the demographic and socioeconomic nature of individual regions makes up for the incompleteness. This is similar to the false positives where the signal identified an early warning for a catastrophe originates in wide classes of impending transitions because the underlying mechanism is understood incompletely [Scheffer 2009 ]. It is also of interest to see if the discovered location of a missing node satisfies the criterion for a strongly influential spreader in the core of the network [Kitsak 2010] . Is it possible to distinguish the presence of a missing spreader node from an anomaly on the parameters mathematically? The solution will be worked out by examining how possible origins of perturbation appear in respective order moments of the disturbed time sequence data, and by finding a suitable backward mapping from the pattern of disturbance to the possible origins. The criterion for discrimination may be a complex function of the preconditions of a mathematical model, experimental conditions, and given datasets, rather than a simple scalar threshold of a test statistic in this study. These issues are for future challenges.",

The performance depends neither on the speed of the spread, on the size of the network, nor on the number of data much. If the cumulative number of new cases is given as a dataset, discrimination is moderately excellent, and interestingly, the tail-end discriminator works more excellently when the parameters are unknown than when they are given.
