The process of payment, which is the essential part of the transaction of smuggling, is not always concluded with the act of smuggling. It may extend well beyond that point. The form and method of payment often reach insidious proportions of exploitation where the smuggler may discourage payment at the outset, making the illegal migrant an easy victim to exploitation and abuse. In many cases, the person seeking to be smuggled into a country illegally welcomes such deferral of payment making the smugglers' business flourish through easier recruitment of candidates for illegal migration. This situation also strengthens the position of the smuggler to tighten his grip on the migrants and use their virtually indentured services for unlawful and criminal activities.",

This Resolution makes mention of smuggling of illegal migrants as an activity that endangers the lives of those smuggled and imposes severe costs on the international community. The United Nations noted that smuggling of aliens can involve criminal elements in many States and condemned the practice of smuggling aliens in violation of national and international law. Resolution 48/102, while urging States to adopt measures to frustrate the objectives and activities of smugglers of illegal migrants, identifies the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) as one of the specialized agencies of the United Nations that could consider ways and means to enhance international co-operation to combat the smuggling of aliens. At the same meeting, the General Assembly of the United Nations adopted Resolution 48/103 on crime prevention and international justice which reaffirmed the importance of the United Nations crime prevention and criminal justice programme and the crucial role the Organization has to play in promoting international co-operation in crime prevention and criminal justice.

Besides these advantages, the MRP also has decided security benefits, such as the possibility of matching very quickly the identity of the MRP owner against the identities of undesirable persons, whilst at the same time, offering strong safeguards against alteration, counterfeit or forgery. Another advantage of the MRP is the fact that the document obviates the need for the passenger to lodge embarkation or disembarkation cards, on the assumption that countries installing automatic reader equipment would accept the data on the passport as sufficient for their clearance purposes. Of course, the MRP had to offer safeguards equal to or better than those of conventional passports and satisfy those control requirements already set by conventional passports and other travel documents in use throughout the world. Also, since it was only natural that a certain number of States would not have wished to issue the MRP or adopt new procedures related thereto, it was expected that a machine readable system and conventional passport procedures would operate side by side for some time.",

The mechanism illustrates the two machine readable lines and surrounding background using a light source. The whole process operates on a principle of \"light absorption\" where the mechanism in the reader uses an optical sensor to measure the presence or absence of light reflecting off the page. The cumulative efforts of this \"imagery\" process and a computer installed in the reader then produces on the screen of the reader, all the information that the inspecting officer requires, such as the passport number, date of expiry of the passport, name of the issuing State, passport-owner's name, nationality, sex, date of birth, and optionally, national ID number. The computer also interrogates simultaneously, a data base containing a list of persons considered undesirable by the State of entry and the results thereof are displayed on the screen momentarily, enabling the inspecting officer to decide whether the bearer of the passport can be admitted to the country.

The care taken by the ISO working group led to considerable time being taken by the working group, compelling ICAO to establish a new group to succeed its Panel on Passport Cards, namely, the Technical Advisory Group on Machine Readable Passports (TAG/ MRP) which met for the first time in 1986.

On the strength of ICAO's new leading role, the Air Transport Committee of ICAO widened the scope of the terms of reference of ICAO to include the development of specifications for machine readable visas and to provide for the Group's membership to include participation by the authorities responsible for visas. Accordingly, the ISO Technical Committee, in the light of ICAO's new role in updating specifications in Doc 9303, adopted a proposal to withdraw ISO Standard 7501, so that there would not be confusion by the introduction of double standards or \"overlapping\" of specifications of ICAO and ISO.",

The required data stored on the integrated circuit chip is the same as that printed on the data page, that is, the data contained in the machine-readable zone plus the digitized photographic image. Fingerprint image(s) and/or iris image(s) are optional biometrics for member States wishing to supplement the facial image with another biometric in the passport. Member States incorporating biometric data in their Machine Readable Passports are to store the data in a contactless integrated circuit chip complying with ISO/IEC 14443 and programmed according to the Logical Data Structure as specified by ICAO. 11 Annex 9 to the Convention on International Civil Aviation, 12th Edition, 2006.",

For instance, when a credit card is used, it is possible to track purchases, discovering numerous aspects about that particular individual, including, food inclination, leisure activities, and consumer credit behaviour. 21 In similar vein, computer records of an air carrier's reservation system may give out details of the passenger's travel preferences, inter alia, seat selection, destination 14 Hoffman (1980), 142. 15 Abeyratne (2001 Abeyratne ( , 2002b Warren and Brandies (1890-1891), at 193. 18 As far back as in 1973 it was claimed that ten reels, each containing 1,500 m of tape 2.5 cm wide, could store a twenty page dossier on every man, woman, and child in the world.

This scheme of things may well give the outward perception of surveillance attributable to computer devices monitoring individuals' most intimate activities, preferences and physical attributes, leading to the formation of a genuine \"traceable society\". 23 The main feature of this complex web of technological activity is that an enormous amount of personal information handled by such varied players from the public and private sector, may bring about concerns of possible \"data leaks\" in the system, a risk that could have drastic legal consequences affecting an individual's rights to privacy.",

United Kingdom and Libyan Arab Jamahiriya v. United States of America regarding the PANAM 103 accident at Lockerbie, Scotland in 1988, where the International Court of Justice requested air carriers to submit to the Court the defendants' flight information and reservation details. See International Court of Justice. News Release 99/36, \"Questions of Interpretation and Application of the 1971 Montreal Convention arising from the Aerial Incident at Lockerbie\" (1 July 1999), online: http://www.icj-cij.org/icjwww/idocket/ iluk/iluk2frame.html (date accessed: 14 July 2000). In a similar vein, Arthur R. Miller describes the significance of airline computer reservation system records when dealing with federal, state, local, and other types of investigations where these dossiers could provide valuable information. See also Miller (1971) at 42. 23 See Scott (1995) at 307; Burnham (1983) at 20. A contrario to the argument supported in this thesis that the advancement of technology directly affects the intimacy of individuals. U.S. Circuit Judge Richard Posner favours the idea that other factors, such as urbanisation, income, and mobility development have particularly weakened the information control that, for instance, the government has over individuals: this denotes that individuals' privacy has increased. See Posner (1978) at 409. 24 The text reads: \"No one shall be subjected to arbitrary interference with his privacy, family, home or correspondence, nor to attacks upon his honor and reputation. Everyone has the right to the protection of the law against such interference or attacks\". See Universal Declaration of Human Rights. Privacy represents different things for different people. 26 The concept per se has evolved throughout the history of mankind, from the original non-intrusion approach, which defended an individual's property and physical body against unwanted invasions and intrusions, then manifesting in whom to associate with, later enlarging its scope to include privacy as the individual's decision-making right, 27 and culminating in the control over one's personal information. 28 Thus, the conceptual evolution of privacy is directly related to the technological advancement of each particular period in history.",

            "text": "The right of privacy, as enunciated by the United States Judge Thomas M. Cooley, was the right \"to be let alone\" as a part of a more general right to one's personality. This idea was given further impetus by two prominent young lawyers, Samuel D. Warren and Louis D. Brandeis, 29 in 1890. 30 Before this idea was introduced, the concept of privacy reflected primarily a somewhat physical property or life. The foundations of \"information privacy\", whereby the individuals would determine when, how, and to what extent information about themselves would be communicated to others, inextricably drawing the right of control of information about oneself, 31 is a cornerstone of privacy. With the development of computer capabilities to handle large amounts of data, privacy has been enlarged to include the collection, storage, use, and disclosure of personal information. 32 The notion of informational privacy protection, a typically American usage, has been particularly popular both in the United States and Europe, where the term \"data protection\" is used. 33 26 See Regan (1995) at 33; Freund (1971) at 182. 27 In this case, the US Supreme Court acknowledged the right of women to have abortions based on the grounds that the federal government could not interfere within her \"decisional privacy\" sphere. See Roe v. Wade, 410 U.S. 113 (1973) . See also Cate (1997) at 49. See also Zelermyer (1959) at 16. 28 In a remarkable case concerning the legality of a national census scheduled by the authorities, the German Constitutional court connected the individual's liberty and the personal data processing of the intended census, to rule that if the individuals do not know for what purposes and who is collecting the data, that situation will eventually create an abdication of the individual's rights to the processor's command, \"which cannot be tolerated in a democratic society\". See Simitis (1995) at 447-448. See also Hoffer (2000) at 8.1; Gavison (1980) . 29 See Cooley (1888), as cited in Warren and Brandeis (1980) at 195. 30 The definition of privacy as the \"Right to be Alone\" is often erroneously attributed to Warren and Brandeis. See Warren & Brandeis. See Cooley (1888) as cited in Warren and Brandeis (1980) at 195 . Additionally the concept of privacy as \"the right to be let alone\", and \"the right most valued by civilized man: was embraced by US courts in the landmark dissenting opinion of Justice Louis D. Brandeis in Olmsted v. United States. See Olmsted v. United States, 277 U.S. 438, 478 (1928) The former Privacy Commissioner of British Columbia, Canada, has asserted that privacy was originally a \"non-legal concept\". See Flaherty (1991) at 833-834. The term \"data protection\" has been translated from the German word Datenschutz, referring to a set of policies seeking to regulate the collection, storage, use, and transfer of personal information. See Bennet (1992) at 13. Self-determination in the right to protect one's privacy was first judicially embraced by the German Bundesverfassungsgericht in 1983. 34 The US Supreme court followed this trend by adopting the principle of privacy self-determination in DOJ v. Reporters Comm. for Freedom of the Press. 35 It must be borne in mind that privacy is not an absolute, unlimited right that operates and applies in isolation. 36 It is not an absolute right, applied unreservedly, to the exclusion of other rights. Hence there is frequently the necessity to balance privacy rights with other conflictive rights, such as the freedom of speech and the right to access information when examining individuals' rights vis-a`-vis the interest of society. 37 This multiplicity of interests will prompt courts to adopt a balanced approach when adjudicating on a person's rights, particularly whose interests of a State are involved.",

Globalization and increased migration across borders is gradually putting an end to the concept of the nation State, although resistance to reality can be still seen in instances where majority or dominant cultures impose their identity and interests on groups with whom they share a territory. In such instances, minorities frequently intensify their efforts to preserve and protect their identity, in order to avoid marginalization. Polarization between the opposite forces of assimilation on the one hand and protection of minority identity on the other inevitably causes increased intolerance and eventual armed ethnic conflict.

One view is that an agency paradigm, which may in some circumstances impute to a state reprehensibility on the ground that a principal-agent relationship between the State and the perpetrator existed, can obfuscate the issue and preclude one from conducting a meaningful legal study of the State's conduct. 42",

In 2002 when Anthrax spores escaped from two military laboratories in the United States, the authorities agreed that the leakage was due to a security lapse. 45 In 2003 a string of such leakages occurred in Asia, this time of the SARS virus. 46 ICAO has been addressing these threats for some time and continues to do so on a global basis, particularly with regard to the impact of unpredictable security measures on passenger confidence in aviation security. There has been much support for this approach because of its value as a deterrent. It has been suggested that States adopt an approach providing for a baseline regime, but with the addition of unpredictable measures, thus achieving a balance between certainty and unpredictability.",

Overt, announced events, in which persons are warned that an exposure has occurred, have taken place in the United States, although most of these were determined to have been hoaxes, that is, there were no true exposures to infectious agents. incorporated in the ePassport is the creation of a public or private entity, is so incorporated in a State document-i.e. the passport, and therefore the State is ultimately liable for defects in the passport. State liability under administrative law can in turn be divided into two limbs: liability for acts of instrumentalities of State; and liability for privatized service providers for whose acts, relating to the provision of technical services, the State would still bear responsibility. The traditional model of administrative responsibility and accountability of the administrative State is based on the premise that Parliament controlled the executive but was in turn controlled by the people. Added to this, the fundamental postulate lay in the overarching principle that the judiciary played its role in keeping instrumentalities and agencies of the State intact. Accountability of the State for its agencies' actions was twofold: one stemming from a statutory power given to that agency by the State; and the other arising from delegation of authority by the State to the agency concerned. In the latter instance, however, the legislature could intervene and share some control of the agency. This gave rise to the inexorable principle that administrative law and judgments of courts on such agencies could be involved only in the former instance, when the State had provided a statutory base for a private agency or entity. In the 1983 British case of O'Reilly & Mackman, 49 the House of Lords limited the circumstances in which a public law remedy, such as a declaratory judgment or injunction, could be brought outside of Section 31 of the Supreme Court Act of 1918, which prescribed instances of legal actions to be brought against the State for an act of its statutory agent. This is notwithstanding the fact that Section 21 of the Crown Proceedings Act 1949 allows the Court in civil proceedings to issue a declaratory order against the State, although there could be no injunction specific performance orders against a State. Furthermore, a later case established that although the claim for judicial review might be brought against the Crown, the Crown's involvement is merely nominal and the ultimate dispute would be between the claimant and the defendant. 50 It is with the 1990 decision in the Factorframe Case 51 where Lord Bridge stated that injunctive relief against the Crown or its officers was not possible.",

There could be two types of privatized service providers: the first being large companies which were once instrumentalities 49 [1983] For a detailed discussion of the legal liability of States and of a privatized service provider see Abeyratne (2004) . of state, which, even after privatization, do not possess potential for undue competition in the market. These would easily transit to a position in which large companies had been private in the first place, and would not be subject to principles of public law. The second category of the privatized service provider is one which has market power and consequent potential for untrammelled competition. In such cases, the State may regulate the provider by bringing it under the administrative purview of a State agency.

The Director General of Telecommunications, established by the Act, can grant licenses to operators of telecom systems. The Director General is also empowered to refer a matter to the Monopolies and Mergers Commission, particularly on issues related to public interest such as pricing.

An initial difficulty that arose was the nineteenth Century control of trade, which was aimed at promoting competition proved counterproductive, resulting in controlling competition. This difficulty was compounded by the early twentieth Century State policy of reluctance to interfere with citizens striking bargains for their benefit. 55 However, after World War 1, some British Governmental measures introduced comprehensive control of market power. 56 British legislators can be proud of three legislative stages of unfair competition control. The first came in the form of the 1948 Monopolies and Restrictive Practices (Inquiry and Control), Act which devolved regulatory responsibility on an 53 From 1912 until 1981 telecommunications are the responsibility of the Post Office. The 1981 legislation represented telecommunications from KP. Services and established British Telecom as a public corporation. 54 Article 15 provides that every airport in an ICAO contracting State which is open to public use by its national aircraft shall likewise be open under uniform conditions to aircraft of all other Contracting States. The like uniform conditions shall apply to the use, by aircraft of every Contracting State, of all air navigation facilities, including radio and meteorological services, which may be provided for public use for the safety and expedition of air navigation services. Article 15 also provides that charges applicable to a foreign carrier for the provision of the air navigation services shall not be higher than those imposed on a carrier bearing the service provider State's nationality. 55 Mogul SS. Co. Ltd. v. McGregor Gow [1892] A.C. 25. See also Sorrell v. Smith [1925] A.C. 700. 56 Committee on Trusts Cmd. 9236 (1918) . agency-the Monopolies and Restriction Practices Commission (MRPC)-a body outside the normal departmental framework. The second stage commenced with the 1956 Restrictive Trade Practices Act which addressed the competitive threat of cartels and the Restrictive Practices Court was established to adjudicate an anticompetitive and privy issues. The third stage took on with the exPANsion of the Monopolies Commission which investigates monopolies issues. Merger irregularities were added to the jurisdiction of the Commission with the Monopolies and Mergers Act of 1968. The 1980 Competition Act which followed gave the Commission power to investigate particular anti-competitive practices. The final stage of the evaluation demarcates choice of institutions to investigate and adjudicate on anti-competitive practices. From an administrative perspective, the citizen has been known to challenge these State instrumentalities, 57 the most notable of which has been the challenge offered to the various governmental institutions created under Statute to define their extent of duty to give reasons for competition legislation. 58 A Government's approach to regulation of a public utility, whether public or privatized, is usually based on the public interest rationale where individual consumer choice will determine the demand and supply for goods and their pricing and quantity. 59 In the United Kingdom, these factors are intrinsically related to transparency, accountability, proportionality, consistency and targeting. 60 The foremost necessity is to establish a strong security culture in every State. For this, there must be a clear definition of State responsibility and accountability brought to bear by a close and unbreakable link between government and industry stakeholders. A security culture would make States aware of their rights and duties, and, more importantly, enable States to assert them. Those who belong to a security culture also know which conduct would compromise security and they are quick to educate and caution those who, out of ignorance, forgetfulness, or personal weakness, partake in insecure conduct. An ePassport must necessarily be the result of efficient and fail-safe organizational arrangements. It should be tested at border control by trained professionals. eGovernment and eID are the bare essentials for State security. The digital economy has also brought much facilitation that helps the world move to paperless processes which result in greater economy and streamlined processes. However, there must essentially be global harmonization in this process. In this regard ICAO has made remarkable progress in advancing its MRTD programme to the level it is at now. If harmonization means ensuring consistency between global practices, standardization means compliance with international Standards. There is no room for doubt that both harmonization and globalization are needed in this context. 57 ",
