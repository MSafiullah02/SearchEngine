The VESV species was identified following the occurrence of outbreaks of vesicular disease in swine in California in 1932 that showed striking similarity to foot-and-mouth disease (Traum, 1936) . Thousands of pigs were destroyed before foot-and-mouth disease virus (FMDV) was excluded as the etiologic agent, and a new virus, designated VESV was associated with the disease.

Primer concentration seemed to cause more variation in the Ct values; with low concentrations such as 50 nM increasing Ct values and high concentrations of the order of 400 nM to 1 M causing false positive reactivity even in the absence of cDNA template (data not shown).

The primers and probe in this study performed efficiently in a one-step assay that had been optimized for the detection of human noroviruses, even though the primer and probe concentrations were higher (400 nM). These data suggest that optimal conditions may vary among laboratories according to the reagents used and the type of thermocycler available, and further optimization should be considered if Ct values are higher than expected with control RNA. Quantitation by the rtRT-PCR assay was accomplished by generating a standard curve with a recombinant plasmid carrying the 176-bp capsid gene target fragment. The presence of subgenomic RNA in the total RNA extracted from virus-infected cells made precise calculation of full-length genome equivalents difficult, so an alternative approach was used to calculate the limit of detection (LOD).
