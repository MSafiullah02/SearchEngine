In this last context, an actor's diffusion behavior depends on the number of other individuals already engaged in the process [5,27,28]. These works have recently been generalized to multilevel networks [29\u201332]. The diffusion of information has also been modeled using game theory, giving players a positive payoff if they spread the information [8,23,33,34]. Moreover, the topological factors that may affect the spreading have been investigated in detail in [27,35,36]. Other applications related to information diffusion, such as finding the influential spreaders [37], maximizing or restraining the information propagation [38,39], predicting the information diffusion on real-world social networks [10,40\u201342], and revealing general patterns of the diffusion of the temporal information [43], have also been studied extensively.",

However, certainly a person's decision on whether or not to transmit a given piece of information relies on many factors, one of them being trust in the sources [44]. In a network context, where spreading takes place using the topological structure, this trust is conceived at the level of individual nodes. In our approach, we consider that the decision whether to transmit a certain piece of information depends on the number of trustable and untrustable acquaintances involved in the process. For example, a person who receives a piece of information from a few untrustable neighbors may decide not to forward it because of the lack of reliable evidence, but the behavior changes if these neighbors are trustable. Within this scenario, an untrustable individual is one that you do not know if you can trust; other meanings could be assigned to untrustability, but this one is the more appropriate in our framework.",

In this paper, we consider an evolutionary game on graphs [45\u201348] to model the trustable and untrustable interactions, and the propagation of the information is abstracted as a modified version of the threshold model [26,27] in which trustable neighbors are given more credit in the decision of activation. Similar to [12,49], each dynamic takes place in a different layer of a multiplex network, thus taking into account the possibility of having different connections between individuals in the trust and information-spreading layers, respectively. Note that the interaction between both layers is limited to the following: each actor has a game dynamics that specifies the state of being trustable or not. This state is visible for the actors in the spreading phase that takes place on the second layer. In this sense, the trust in one layer influences the spreading on the other.",

However, when we start increasing the influence of trustable neighbors, the fraction of active nodes quickly rises, easily covering the whole population. This effect is more important for intermediate values of the temptation b and shorter memory time spans. Taking into account the results in Figs. 2 and 3, it becomes evident that the information spreading is not just a consequence of the fraction of trustable nodes in the stationary state of the trust dynamics, but it must also depend on its transitory states. For example, when b is close to 1, all nodes are trustable in the steady state (s(T)=1), which corresponds to a region in Fig. 2 where the activity cannot propagate, but it does. Therefore, the only possibility is that, during the transitory of the trust dynamics, the number of trustable nodes changes continuously from the initial fraction 50% to a final value (not necessarily in a monotonic way), and it is in these intermediate states when the information spreading achieves its maximum level. Moreover, the fact that the influence \u03b1 can be small for full spreading, unlike in Fig. 2, points to the importance of the whole trust dynamics to explain the spreading, which cannot be understood by just accounting for the fraction of trustable individuals.",

The result is a Trust-Driven Information-Spreading model, on top of a two-layer multiplex network, in which individuals participate in two processes, a trust dynamics in one layer and an information spreading in the other. The influence and distribution of trustable actors affect the diffusion of information, while there is no interaction in the opposite direction, from the spreading to the trust layer. For the diffusion of the information, individuals become spreaders when the influence of their neighbors exceeds a certain threshold.
