PsaA deletion mutants display low ability to adhere to mucosal cells and therefore are less pathogenic [3]. This characteristic may be due to differences in the modulation of pneumococcal adhesins caused by the absence of Mn2+ or Zn2+ in the cell [4]. PsaA is conserved among the 90 described S. pneumoniae serotypes and is also immunogenic, which makes it a good candidate for vaccine formulations. In fact, antibodies produced against PsaA by nasal immunization, using cholera toxin B subunit as adjuvant, were shown to protect mice against nasopharyngeal colonization by S. pneumoniae. This protection can be further increased by the co-administration of PsaA with the pneumococcal surface protein A (PspA), another pneumococcal virulence factor [5], [6]. In another approach, oral immunization of mice with PsaA encapsulated in microspheres induced the production of IgG and IgA and resulted in protection against lung colonization and septicemia with five different S. pneumoniae strains [7].",

These recombinant L. casei are being tested as potential anti-pneumococcal vaccines through nasal immunization of mice, but so far we could not detect significant levels of anti-PsaA IgA or IgG (unpublished data). The failure in stimulating the production of antibodies may be a result of the lack of PsaA or PspA expression in the recombinant L. casei after nasal immunization, due to the absence of the inducer in the host mucosa. For this reason, we decided to use a system that allows the constitutive expression of PsaA in different LAB strains. In this work, recombinant Lactococcus lactis, Lactobacillus casei, Lactobacillus plantarum and Lactobacillus helveticus expressing PsaA were evaluated for their ability to induce systemic and mucosal immune responses in nasally immunized C57Bl/6 mice. Nasal colonization of Streptococcus pneumoniae in these mice was also analyzed.",

L. lactis carrying the constructed vector showed the expression of a protein around 37 kDa reacting against anti-PsaA antibodies, which was not present in extracts from cells carrying the empty vector (\nFig. 2A).

Interestingly, administration of L. casei pT1NX led to an inhibition in S. pneumoniae colonization when compared with the saline group (P\n < 0.01) and expression of PsaA in this strain produced a much stronger effect (P\n < 0.001).

After the fusion to the Usp45 signal sequence, the recombinant PsaA protein was directed to the cell wall in the four LAB assayed, with no protein detected in culture supernatants. In a previous report, expression of PsaA in fusion with the leader sequence from the L. casei cell wall proteinase PrtP also resulted in the localization of the protein in the cell wall and no secretion to the culture media [27]. Since the sequence which specifies PsaA covalent anchoring to the cell surface in its natural streptococcal host is absent from our construct, it seems that this protein has the particularity to be retained in the cell wall in different bacteria.",

L. plantarum and L. helveticus turned out to be better in the development of mucosal and systemic anti-PsaA immune response than L. casei and L. lactis. Pooled saliva from the L. casei PsaA group displayed an IgA induction similar to those found in the L. plantarum PsaA or the L. helveticus PsaA groups (Fig. 3A). However, when nasal or bronchial washes of individual animals in the L. casei PsaA group were analyzed, most of them displayed low or even no detectable levels of IgA, with only one animal producing a high titer of anti-PsaA IgA (Fig. 3A and B). The high titer in this individual may be the cause of the anti-PsaA IgA observed in pooled saliva from the L. casei PsaA group (Fig. 3A). Since L. casei expressed about the same amount of PsaA as L. plantarum and L. helveticus and was also recovered from mice nasal mucosa in the same period, the differences observed among L. casei and the other lactobacilli may reflect differences in their intrinsic adjuvant potential. In another study, Shaw and collaborators have shown that L. plantarum NCIMB 8826 expressing TTFC produced better results in oral immunization when compared to L. casei 393 [37]. In this case, L. plantarum persisted for up to 12 days in mice gastrointestinal tract whereas L. casei remained for about 72 h [37]. The inability of L. lactis expressing PsaA to significantly induce serum IgG or secreted IgA after nasal inoculation could be explained by the low level of expression in this strain compared to lactobacilli. In addition, it was observed that lactococci carrying the expression vector, remained in mice nasal mucosa only 1 day after the inoculation, while lactobacilli could be detected up to 3 days later.",

On the other hand, colonization of S. pneumoniae was significantly reduced in mice immunized with L. helveticus PsaA, when compared with the animals that received saline or L. helveticus pT1NX. A significant decrease in S. pneumoniae colonization is also observed in the group that received L. plantarum PsaA in relation to the group that received saline, but not in relation to the group that received L. plantarum pT1NX. In this case, a possible inhibition effect related to the strain may be taking place. However, it is important to notice that simply inoculation of the L. plantarum strain carrying the empty vector is not sufficient to cause a decrease in S. pneumoniae colonization. Interestingly the group that received L. casei carrying the empty vector displayed a significant reduction in S. pneumoniae colonization and this reduction was more accentuated in the group that received L. casei PsaA. Since the administration of this strain induced low levels of anti-PsaA antibodies, other mechanisms may be causing this reduction. In addition, although a correlation between antibody induction and inhibition of S. pneumoniae colonization was observed when we compared the groups that received L. lactis PsaA, L. plantarum PsaA and L. helveticus PsaA, this correlation is not always maintained when we analyzed the animals individually. Thus, the induction of anti-PsaA antibodies may be only one of the factors contributing to the reduction of S. pneumoniae colonization. Nasal immunization with recombinant PsaA in combination with other pneumococcal proteins and CTB as adjuvant [6] as well as oral immunization with microencapsulated PsaA and CTB [38] were able to induce mucosal and systemic antibodies and protect mice against S. pneumoniae colonization. These studies suggest a correlation between antibody production and inhibition of colonization. In another study using a colonization model in mice, nasal inoculation of S. pneumoniae resulted in mucosal antibody induction that was associated with clearance of the bacteria. However, no correlation was observed between the amount of antibodies detected in the sera or mucosa and the density of colonization of individual animals. In addition, animals with impaired humoral immunity displayed similar densities and durations of S. pneumoniae colonization than their normal counterparts. The authors discuss that other components of the adaptative immune response as well as innate immune response may be the main contributors for pneumococcal clearance in their model [39].",
