In order to minimize resources exhaustion and transmission risks, elective surgery and admissions were canceled or postponed, and entire Departments converted into Intensive Care and Intermediate Care Units. In the massive reorganization of the hospital, our Department of Urology decreased its clinic and surgical load but remained active as a Covid-free, operating service. However, the levels of activity and safety during a pandemic can be undermined by the risk of admitting patients with unrecognized Covid disease in the ward and operating rooms. In fact, hospital-associated transmission was suspected as the presumed mechanism of infection for 41% affected health professionals and hospitalized patients (3). Our objective is to assess the impact of the pandemic and the occurrence and characteristics of Covid-19 in a Covid-free urologic unit in a regional hospital in Northern Italy during the 2020 outbreak.",

Despite available recommendations and guidelines on surgical activity (6, 7, 8) and the implementation of telemedicine to improve screening and protection (9) , the risk of missing a Covid-infected patient in a Covid-free unit remains high. In our experience, 8% of 8 admitted patients after the lockdown were positive or highly suspicious for Covid. The cost of such misdiagnosis can be catastrophic, leading to further spread of the pandemic and to shortcoming and exhaustion of healthcare workers.

Our experience highlights that Covid-19 infection may mimick or overlap to the symptoms and signs of urgent urologic conditions. Primarily, a fever associated to an unrecognized Covid can mislead the assessment of an uncomplicated urinary stone as a septic condition. The rise of both PCR and procalcitonin was not helpful in the differential diagnosis, as previously suggested (10) . Secondarily, although Covid-19 has been associated with a hypercoagulable state (11), a prolonged PT is a common hematologic finding (12) , which might potentially worsen or prolong a hematuria due to an unrelated pre-existing condition.",

Data were compared with that of the same period of 2019 (March 11-April 7, 2019). RESULTS a) Surgical load. A 63% drop in elective surgical abdominal and 70% drop in endoscopic procedures occurred during the 4 weeks after the lockdown, as compared to same time lapse of 2019. Most of them were performed during week 1, due to unvaried operative planning right after the lockdown. From week 2, all abdominal surgery was performed via an open approach; laparoscopic and robotic procedures had to be abandoned due to issues related to the 6 available operating rooms left. Only 16 urgent cases for obstructive uropathy or sepsis (n=12), hematuria (n=3) and renal trauma (n=1) were performed with a 32% reduction. b) Admissions and bed occupation. The rate of bed occupation decreased steadily from week 1 to week 4. The median number of occupied beds decreased from 21 (range 18-23) during week 1 -similar to that of March 2019 -to 8 (range 7-10) during week 4, with a 64% reduction. Beds were occupied by patients with complications from previous month' procedures and patients with urgent conditions, mainly urosepsis and hematuria. Overall admissions were 133 in March 2019 and 39 in March 2020, with a 71% drop.",

            "text": "A 65 years old woman with a history of left partial nephrectomy presented with flank pain associated with a 5mm stone of the right lower ureter: a double J stent was placed. On the day after discharge, the Patient developed fever, initially diagnosed as a septic complication of endoscopic treatment, and later on dyspnea associated with worsening of laboratory parameters. A naso-pharingeal swab confirmed the diagnosis of Covid-19. History revealed that the patient shared the waiting room of a medical facility with a person with cough one week prior to her admission.Patient 2. An otherwise healthy 54 years old man presented with 39\u00b0C fever and cough and a 9mm stone of the upper ureter with mild hydronephrosis at abdominal ultrasound: a double J stent was placed. Despite a negative swab for Covid-19 RNA, the Patient had exertional dyspnea and 92% O2 saturation throughout the hospital stay, worsened during the operation of stent placement and was considered highly suspicious. No exposure history was referred. Patient 3. A 66 years old man with a history of radical prostatectomy and radiation therapy for a pT3b prostate cancer in 2005 was transferred from an outside hospital located in an area with high levels of community transmission for the worsening of recurrent hematuria associated with fever and diarrhea and a Methicillin-resistant Staphyloccus Aureus bacteremia. Chest-x-ray was negative and saturation was 98%. Due to the rise of fever up to 38\u00b0C, a swab positive for Covid-19 RNA was performed, and the Patient transferred to an intermediate care Covid Department where his respiratory symptoms and parameters worsened.DISCUSSION and CONCLUSIONSThe destiny of many surgical departments during the Covid-19 pandemic throughout the world is to face a reduction of their clinical and surgical activity. Our Department experienced an exceptional reduction of 60-70% of surgery, admissions and bed occupation, following a 2-phase phenomenon. During week 1 after the lockdown, surgical loads were comparable to ordinary levels, due to the maintaining of scheduled oncologic cases. Beginning with week 2, a significant drop occurred as the pandemic was spreading in our Province. Even urgent urologic procedures had a 30% reduction, following the pattern observed with acute cardiovascular conditions, such as stroke (4) and myocardial infarction(5). Most likely, patients' concerns of contracting COVID-19 lead to delays in seeking care in the hospital. A stricter medical selection to the admissions of deferrable conditions and the decrease of road traffic injuries might also have played a role.",
