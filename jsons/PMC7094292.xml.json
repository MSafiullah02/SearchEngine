Twenty-seven patients (18.6%) who refused treatment were enrolled as cases and 118 (81.4%) patients who received oseltamivir were controls.

Primary resistance to the neuraminidase inhibitors among wild strains of human influenza viruses A(H1N1), A(H3N2), and B has been uncommon until the recent few years.14 Oseltamivir resistance, which is largely associated with H274Y mutations in neuraminidase gene of influenza A(H1N1) and H5N1 viruses,29, 30, 31 developed in 0.33% to 5.5% of patients following oseltamivir treatment.14, 29, 30, 31, 32 In 2007, H274Y mutants of influenza A(H1N1) Brisbane-like variant, which were first detected in Norway,33 have spread globally and become the dominant seasonal H1N1 virus. Initial bioinformatics analysis and phenotypic antiviral susceptibility tests showed that the H1N1 is susceptible to oseltamivir and zanamivir but resistant to amantadine or rimantadine because of a serine 31-to-asparagine mutation.34 With the dramatic increase in oseltamivir use for treating pandemic A(H1N1) infection, resistance may continue to increase worldwide, including Hong Kong.35, 36 Even with the availability of a safe and effective pandemic A(H1N1) vaccine, antiviral stockpiling remains an important armamentarium for the epidemiologic control of future pandemic.",
