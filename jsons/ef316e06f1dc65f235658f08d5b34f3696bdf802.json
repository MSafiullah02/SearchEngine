The COVID-19 outbreak was believed to have emerged from a seafood market in Wuhan, a metropolis city of more than 11 million population in Hubei province, China. We introduced a statistical disease transmission model using case symptom onset data to estimate the transmissibility of the early-phase outbreak in China, and provided sensitivity analyses with various assumptions of disease natural history of the COVID-19. We fitted the transmission model to several publicly available sources of the outbreak data until 11, February 2020, and estimated lock down intervention efficacy of Wuhan city. The estimated R 0 was between 2.7 and 4.2 from plausible distribution assumptions of the incubation period and relative infectivity over the infectious period. 95% confidence interval of R 0 were also reported. Potential issues such as data quality concerns and comparison of different modelling approaches were discussed.",

It has been declared to be pandemic by WHO on March 11. The outbreak size has surpassed infections caused by two other major coronavirus to date, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) and Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV). It appears the transmission rate of the COVID-19 is the highest in all circulating human CoVs [17] , and the disease is still spreading at fast pace albeit Chinese authorities taking very stringent measures including city lock down with suspending all travel by air, train and highways. The lock down of Wuhan city, the epicentre of this outbreak in Hubei province, took place at 10 am local time on 23, January, 2020. The same strict interventions were used in several other cities in Hubei province and cities in other provinces with high count of secondary input cases. The transmission rate was likely accelerated by the national migration event ChunYun before lunar new year, with enormous traffic volumes from and to Wuhan and other major cities in China.",

Epidemiological reviews, case reports and contact risk histories available provide crucial information for establishing dynamic transmission models to evaluate the basic reproduction number ( R 0 ) of COVID-19. R 0 is defined as the average number of secondary cases in an uninfected population that an diseased person would infect, during the persons' whole infectious window. It is used as a measure of transmission rate for infectious diseases, and containment of an outbreak requires to reduce effective R 0 to below 1. In this paper, we fitted a Poisson transmission model with either symptomatic infection only or potential asymptomatic infection assumptions, together with current knowledge of the disease's natural history of COVID-19, to the case symptom onset time reports available from China CDC website [2] as well as report delay time augmented onset report from daily confirmed case ascertainment available at World Health Organization (http://who.int) [16] and National Health Commission of the People's Republic of China website (http:// www.nhc.gov.cn/). Researchers from several institutions had reported initial modelling results of the early-phase outbreak of COVID-19. Read et al. [13] and Wu et al. [17] relied on traffic data across Chinese cities and international flights incorporated in deterministic SEIR transmission model of infection. Disease natural history was based on early hypothesis of the COVID-19 as well as that of SARS and MERS. Li et al. [9] provided detailed disease onset record of the first 425 confirmed cases and estimates of disease incubation period and serial interval from the contact tracing, and applied these knowledge into renewal equations epidemic model to estimate R 0 . Zhao et al. [18] applied an exponential growth model to fit report rate-adjusted lab-confirmed case report data from Chinese authorities.",

The incubation period (t,t) is the time to develop symptoms after being infected. As Time   0  1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9  10  11  12  13  14  15  16  17  18 19 20 Fig. 1 , the lengths of incubation period are 4, 4, 5, 4 and 3 days for cases 1 to 5. The accurate estimate of these event times from contact history evaluation is important for understanding the natural history of disease. For instance, if we know that there was close contact between cases 1, 2 and cases 4, 5, but case 3 had no contact with all other cases, a patient would be unlikely to transmit the disease before symptom onset. Otherwise, if cases 3 and 4 were in close contact and after hospitalization case 3 was isolated from case 4, it would indicate that the infected case may be infectious before showing any symptom. Such conclusions are, however, very challenging during emerging outbreak investigations, as t i 's are often unavailable for most cases and the contact history between cases can be complex. On the other hand, there is usually delay between symptom onset time, hospitalization time and lab confirmation time. The incidence number of confirmed cases available as daily report usually consists of the lab confirmation time, thus is less accurate for recent infections.",

The probability of observing symptom onset at t given infection at t is where f beta (\u22c5| inc , inc ) is the density function of beta-distribution.

Density functions from other distributions such as log-normal [9] , Weibull [5] or gamma distributions may be used as well, as long as these fit the observed incubation periods of COVID-19. We used beta-distribution since it has finite support that reflects the shortest/longest incubation period without the need to truncate the right tail for distribution with an infinite support. We also assume that latent period (time length between infection and start of infectiousness) is the same as the incubation period, thus the case is only able to infect other people after symptom onset.

Several preliminary estimates of disease natural history and R 0 were available for the COVID-19 outbreak [9, 10, 13, 17, 18] . We assumed inc = 6 and inc = 12 for the beta-distributed incubation period, with a range of 1 to 14 days. The assumed mean incubation is 5.67 days which is similar to the previous literature on SARS and MERS incubation period [7, 8, 15] . The relative infectivity is assumed to be varying over the infectious period (assumed to be 0-10 days after onset) since the patients may reduce their mobility and contact with others with alarming symptoms such as fever, fatigue and coughing. We performed sensitivity analyses by varying the distribution of incubation period and relative infectivity over time. These assumptions are summarized in Fig. 2 , including shorter or longer mean incubation The different parameter assumptions for the modified transmission model where cases may show infectiousness before symptom onset include \u0394 * inf = 24 days after t , and the relative infectivity was assumed to be the highest at or after symptom onset. The incubation period assumptions were the same as the original model. Figure 3 summarizes the assumed incubation and relative infectivity distribution for the modified model.",

We found little impact of the error counts on the estimated model parameters, thus we illustrate our results assuming the error counts were all 0. Assuming no error the reported number of confirmed onset cases was 3442 by 23, January 2020, and number of suspected plus confirmed cases were 8348. Estimated R 0 was 2.31(2.25, 2.38) using confirmation report augmented onset records, from an average of 4940 augmented confirmed cases. Using the repeatedly augmented onset records yielded similar estimates of R 0 and the variance estimate for the 95% CI was obtained by combining the estimates from the repeatedly augmented data, accounting for multiple augmentation variability. Figure 4 shows the time trend of number in observed onset cases, fitted onset cases as well as fitted infected cases each day for all three data sources, respectively. The fitted onset trend matches the observed data well, indicating the assumed parameters for incubation and relative infectivity were reasonable. We summarize the R 0 estimates from sensitivity analyses in Table 1 . Under these scenarios, the estimated values of R 0 fall between 2 and 3, which were in general agreement with modelling literature [9, 10, 17, 18] and China CDC report [2] , despite various data sources and modelling approaches. The estimated R 0 tended to be higher with longer incubation period or with the later development of infectivity peak compared to the baseline assumptions. Shorter incubation period or earlier development of infectivity peak led to lower estimated R 0 , while distribution assumptions with the opposite direction resulted in higher estimated R 0 . The fitted versus observed number of daily onset cases were in good agreement in all scenarios for sensitivity analyses, as the assumptions for either incubation period or relative infectivity in these scenarios were generally close to these in the baseline scenario. The transmission model would be expected to have poor fit to the data if the disease natural history assumptions were very different from the truth.",

We could then estimate the intervention effect parameters with the updated transmission model. Recently published median incubation period in China [4] was estimated to be 4 days with interquartile range of 2-7 days. The shorter incubation period distribution is most close to these findings. Published viral load discoveries in [19] indicated that the levels were highest at or a few days following symptom onset. Observing that the relative infectivity is highly associated to viral load, we felt baseline or earlier relative infectivity assumptions might be more appropriate reflecting recent findings.

This is possible with the updated data thus we fitted models to two data sets separately reflecting the place of onset.

About 68.6% cases outside Wuhan had Wuhan related exposure history and bring the disease to other regions in China [12] . These cases should be treated as input cases in the model and more detailed data are required for further analysis. Thus, we only included results with cases within Wuhan in the main text. The results with cases outside Wuhan region can be found in the supplementary material. Figure 5 shows the model fit to the observed onset curves from 8, December 2019 to 11, February 2020 inside Wuhan Region. Similar to previous results, fitted onset curves matched observed onset curves relatively well.

We have fitted a relatively simple transmission model requiring basic knowledge of disease natural history and daily records of symptom onset to estimate R 0 . Our inferred R 0 fall in the same range as results from other researchers [9, 10, 17, 18] , who performed modelling work using different sources of outbreak data. Our model made the assumption that the outbreak took place in a homogeneous population with random mixing of individuals, which reflects the fact that the majority of the early phase of COVID-19 outbreak occurred in the greater Wuhan area, and the input cases in other cities in China and internationally account for a small proportion of all infected by 23, January 2020. We did not rely on the traffic volume data in the current approach, however, these could be Table 1 Estimated Observed (shown as bars) and fitted (red curve) number of cases with symptom onset over time, and fitted number of infected cases (blue curve) over time from updated data [12] . Results were with shorter incubation period and baseline infectivity assumptions. The purple vertical dotted line indicates the start of lock down intervention modelled as additional factors that affect the hazard contribution from geographical covariates when available. The inferred transmissibility were similar from epidemiological report when using China CDC and the augmented onset record from case confirmation time with potential report delay. Ignoring the report delay may lead to substantial bias for estimating R 0 , as the exponential growth rate of cumulative cases could be a lot higher than reality. We considered potential asymptomatic infectiousness in the modified model. As more recent evidences indicating potential infection without symptom exists [1, 6] , we want to emphasis that these modified assumptions may be crucial to understand not only the disease transmissibility, but to a greater extent in future model to evaluate intervention strategies with sensitive timing components. Nevertheless, there were challenges to the current approach, mainly due to the limited understanding of the emerging COVID-19 outbreak and the lack of full, accurate data. First, the R 0 estimates were sensitive to different assumptions of disease natural history. We rely on accurate quantification from contact history of the current outbreak and knowledge of previous coronavirus outbreaks such as SARS and MERS to formulate reasonable assumptions. Also, whether asymptomatic infection exists for COVID-19 is still unclear yet. From the comparison between model that assumed no asymptomatic infection and the modified one assuming possible infectiousness before symptom onset, the R 0 estimates were about 0.5 higher in the latter results. Updated case reports that indicate potential asymptomatic infection of COVID-19 would be important in making the sensible model assumption. If there is asymptomatic transmission for COVID-19 outbreak, much more stringent intervention efforts such as quarantining all individuals with potential exposure contacts are required, as compared to quarantining only these with exact contact history with confirmed cases. On the other hand, currently reported cases from China CDC may merely be a reflection of the limited resources of available medical services including hospital beds, health care work forces, medical protection equipment and virus RNA testing capability. There could be more cases of infection and death than reported, acting as one of the biggest challenges for transmission modelling. The limited resources not only caused potential underestimated number of cases, but also could lead to additional distortion in the distribution of report delay and relative infectivity.",

Individual level covariates should be incorporated into transmission dynamics, and time-varying effect as well as spatial parameters to modify the local intensity of infection can be estimated when richer data from the outbreak become available. It is especially critical to evaluate the efficacy of traffic ban of the greater Wuhan region and future interventions including quarantine sites or promising medication used to reduce the effective reproductive number of COVID-19. We have included lock down effects in our model with updated data, and it was shown to effectively control the outbreak within 4 to 5 days following the intervention, albeit at massive economical and social costs. It is very unlikely other countries could copy the exact draconian interventions happened in China. It remains utterly important for careful evaluation and implementation of various strategies to control the outbreak.",
