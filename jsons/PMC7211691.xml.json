This pneumonia outbreak was attributed to a novel coronavirus, a lipid-enveloped RNA virus, which was named by the International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV2) [2]. The disease caused by the virus was termed coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19). The virus outbreak presumably originated via a zoonotic transmission linked to the seafood market in Wuhan (China) and later accelerated with human to human transmission, causing the severe subsequent outbreak [1]. Since the original outbreak, SARS-CoV2 has rapidly spread across the world and, in January 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) declared COVID-19 a global public health emergency [3]. By the 21 st of April 2020, more than 2.4 million individuals tested positive for SARS-CoV2, and it had caused more than 165,000 deaths [4].",

However, the lack of specificity, as well as sensitivity for detection of COVID-19, particularly in patients with no or only minor symptoms, must be considered [11,14]. For example, in suspected COVID-19 patients who eventually tested positive on RT-PCR, the reported sensitivity of baseline chest radiographs was reported to be 69% [2]. Consequently, chest radiographs should be performed primarily in patients with moderate to severe symptoms to assess disease progression or diagnose complications [11]. The routine use of chest radiographs, however, is not considered to be indicated in stable, intubated patients with COVID-19 [11].",
