Upon vessel injury, platelets are recruited by adenosine diphosphate (ADP), thrombin, and thromboxane-A2, which connect to their cognate G-protein-coupled receptors and activate integrin inside\u2013out signaling mediated by extracellular signal-related kinases (ERKs) and launch granule secretion. RIPK3 produced in platelets interacting with G13 activates PKB and supports platelet aggregation and spreading on fibrinogen via PKB1 or PKB2 in addition to the second wave of dense granule content secretion in response to thrombin, thromboxane-A2, and clot retraction [56]. The G13 subtype selectively enables thrombin- and TxA2-induced platelet aggregation, but does not influence ADP-primed aggregation. RIPK3 operates independently of its substrate used in cell necrosis and clearance, mixed lineage kinase domain-like pseudokinase (MLKL). Therefore, RIPK3 favors arterial thrombus formation.",

MMP2 is synthesized in higher amounts in CD4+ effector TH1 cells than in TH2 or naive TH0 cells. In addition, TH1 cells can stimulate MMP2 synthesis in macrophages.

Inflammation is indeed observed at all stages of atherogenesis, from initial lesions to fatty streaks, evolved plaques, and end-stage complications, that is, thromboembolism after unstable plaque rupture linked to an excess inflammatory episode [60]. Atherosclerosis is triggered by oxidized LDLs conveying cholesterol. Activated endotheliocytes express adhesion molecules for the diapedesis of circulating leukocytes, activated macrophages, lymphocytes, and smooth myocytes releasing cytokines and chemokines. The procoagulant cytokine increases the synthesis and secretion of fibrinogen, plasminogen activator inhibitor PAI1 (serpin-E1), and acute phase proteins such as C-reactive protein (CRP), thereby amplifying the inflammatory and procoagulant response [61]. Inflammatory cytokines (e.g., IL1, TNFSF1, and CRP) induce the formation of adhesion molecules, provoking a vicious cycle. C-reactive protein supports the production of tissue factor by monocytes and represses that of NO, hence contributing to the creation of a proinflammatory and prothrombotic milieu. Anti-inflammatory drugs can reduce cardiovascular risk [62].",

Owing to this mutual excitation, IL33 potentiates SP-primed TNFSF1 production more than 100-fold in mastocytes. Mastocyte-derived tryptase can cleave extracellular IL33 into its mature active form, which then activates mastocytes, which, in turn, can release soluble IL1RL1 that modulates the effects of IL33. Substance-P also stimulates histamine secretion from mastocytes. Moreover, IL33 and SP upregulate synthesis of both TacR1 and IL1RL1 receptors. In addition, IL3 enhances SP-triggered VEGF release by mastocytes [66]. IL33 also augments the frequency and magnitude of mastocyte degranulation and chemokine production, worsening chronic inflammation, even at low concentrations. The receptors TacR1 and IL1RL1 interfere; TacR1 complexes with IL1RL1 and its coreceptor IL1RAP (IL1R accessory protein); IL33 may participate in complexing TacR1 and IL1RL1 [65]. The stem cell factor receptor (SCFR) also complexes with IL1RL1 and IL1RAP in mastocytes for cross-activation.

Synthesis of hyaluronan and epican is augmented in numerous fibrotic organs. The TGF\u03b21\u2013CD44v6 pathway is implicated in collagen-1 and Act\u03b1 synthesis in pulmonary myofibroblasts [142].

Conversely, CD44v6 sustains ERK signaling, which supports AP1 activity in pulmonary fibroblasts. Hyaluronan produced by hyaluronan synthase HAS2 is required for colocalization of CD44v6 and T\u03b2 R1 and subsequent TGF\u03b21\u2013CD44v6\u2013ERK1\u2013EGR1 signaling, which constitutes a positive feedback loop that links TGF\u03b21 to the myofibroblast phenotype [142].",

In CMCs, overexpressed NDPKc raises cAMP concentration and sensitizes CMCs to isoprenaline, which augments contractility. In NDPKB\u2212\u2215\u2212 mice, NDPKc production remains normal, but long-term isoprenaline exposure causes contractile dysfunction and adverse cardiac remodeling. In ESHF patients, the amount of the NDPKb\u2013NDPKc complex rises, whereas the NDPKc\u2013Gs interaction decays, switching G-protein activation from Gs to Gi2 and contributing to a decrease in the cAMP level. Moderate changes in the Gs/ Gi ratio can determine the G-protein subunit subtypes that tether to NDPKc [171].",

Norrin mimics Wnt, as it can tether and activate frizzled via assembly of a molecular platform consisting of Fzd4, its LRP5\u2013LRP6 coreceptor complex, auxiliary TSpan12, and associated HSPG [211, 212]. It then launches the Ctnn\u03b21\u2014LEF/TCF axis. Norrin maintains the blood\u2013retina and blood\u2013brain barriers and regulates angiogenesis in the eye, ear (cochlea), brain, and female reproductive organs (uterus) [211]. In addition, norrin connects to secreted frizzled-related proteins (sFRPs).",

Sox7, Sox17, and Sox18 are functionally redundant in the developing mouse retinal vasculature (cell differentiation and vessel growth) and maintenance of the mature vasculature [207]. Vascular endothelial-specific deletion of a single SOXF member gene has little or no effect on vascular architecture or differentiation because of the overlapping function of Sox7 and Sox17 and the reciprocal regulation of gene expression. Combined deletion of Sox7, Sox17, and Sox18 at the onset of retinal angiogenesis leads to a dense capillary plexus, with a nearly complete loss of radial arteries and veins, whereas the presence of a single Sox17 allele largely restores arterial identity with vSMC coverage. Indeed, Sox17 plays a major role in vSMC coverage of radial retinal arteries. In the developing retina, expression of all three SOXF genes is reduced in the absence of canonical Wnt signaling mediated by norrin and frizzled-4 but remains unaffected by reduced VEGF signaling after deletion of the NRP1 gene. In adulthood, Sox7, Sox17, and Sox18 also have redundant functions in blood vessel maintenance. At adulthood onset, vascular endothelial-specific deletion of all three SOXF genes causes massive edema, despite nearly normal vascular architecture.",

Conversely, Itg\u03b21BP1 can sequester KrIT1 in the nucleus. Malcavernin is able to sequester KrIT1 in the cytoplasm. PdCD10 may also be involved in the same pathway [190].",
