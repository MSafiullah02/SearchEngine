            "text": "Pseudomonas aeruginosa is a bacterial pathogen capable of causing acute and chronic opportunistic infections, including hospital-acquired pneumonias and chronic, polymicrobial lung infections in individuals with cystic fibrosis (CF) [1\u20135]. During infection, P. aeruginosa produces numerous exoproducts that help it evade the host immune system and procure nutrients from the host environment. Among these products are a family of secreted 2-alkyl-4(1H)-quinolone metabolites (AQs), which exhibit a range of biological activities during infection [6\u201310]. 2-Heptyl-3(1H)-hydroxy-4-quinolone (referred to as C7-PQS) and 2-heptyl-4(1H)-quinolone (HHQ) are two distinct AQ quorum signaling molecules that can regulate expression of virulence factors that contribute to infection [11\u201315]. C7-PQS, but not HHQ, has also been shown to complex with iron and may help P. aeruginosa acquire this critical but limiting nutrient in iron-deplete environments [16]. Another AQ, 2-heptyl-4-hydroxyquinolone-N-oxide (HQNO), is a potent cytochrome b inhibitor that blocks the respiratory chain in both eukaryotic and bacterial cells [8]. Importantly, these different AQs each contribute to antimicrobial activity against microbial pathogens, most notably Staphylococcus aureus, during co-culture and co-infection [7, 17\u201319]. Moreover, it is hypothesized that they significantly contribute to infection, as deletion of an AQ regulator, PqsR, attenuates P. aeruginosa virulence in several in vivo infection models [20\u201323]. However, the precise contributions of each individual AQ during in vivo infection have not been directly tested, and there is a need for analytical tools that can facilitate THE study of these AQs both in vitro and in vivo.",

Anthraniloyl-CoA, along with malonyl-CoA, are then condensed to 2-(aminobenzoyl)acetyl-CoA (2-ABA) by the enzyme PqsD [24\u201329]. 2-ABA can be converted directly into HHQ by the PqsBC complex [24, 26]. While HHQ has several biological functions in itself, it can also be converted by the PqsH mono-oxygenase, encoded at a distal site of the P. aeruginosa chromosome, into PQS [22]. Alternatively, 2-ABA can be further altered by the enzyme PqsL, which is also encoded at a distal site on the P. aeruginosa chromosome, into the unstable product, 2-hydroxylaminobenzoyl acetate (2-HABA). 2-HABA and octanoyl-CoA can then be converted to HQNO via the PqsBC complex [30].",

            "text": "HHQ, HQNO, and C7-PQS can be classified into three general categories: 2-alkyl-4(1H)-hydroxyquinolones (AHQs), 2-alkyl-4-hydroxyquinolone N-oxides (AQNOs), and 2-alkyl-3-hydroxy-4(1H)-quinolone molecules (PQS), respectively. C7-PQS, HHQ, and HQNO are each distinguished by fully saturated alkyl chains that are seven carbons in length. However, variations in alkyl chain length and saturation account for over 50 distinct AQ congeners, several of which are listed in Fig. 1 [31]. It is currently unclear if variation in the alkyl chains of these structures is due to promiscuity of AQ biosynthetic enzymes, or to an as-of-now uncharacterized enzymatic activity in P. aeruginosa, but they clearly alter the biological activity of these metabolites [32, 33]. The precise function of each of these AQs has not been fully characterized, however, due in part to limitations of existing analytical methodology that can identify and quantify each congeners. For instance, PQS production has been studied in previous literature using low-resolution and non-specific thin layer chromatography [6, 7, 34]. However, this method is only suitable for determining qualitative production of PQS congeners and cannot distinguish between co-eluting congeners with varying alkyl chain lengths and saturation. More recent liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) methods have allowed for quantitative analysis of different AQ congeners [7, 31, 35\u201337], although there is still need for more comprehensive LC-MS/MS methods that will facilitate accurate analysis of the broad spectrum of AQs in cell culture and tissue.",

            "text": "The strains used in this study are detailed in Table S1 (see Electronic Supplementary Material (ESM). The wild type P. aeruginosa strain, PAO1, produces a robust range of AQs in cell culture, including C7-PQS, C9-PQS, HQNO, NQNO, HHQ, and NHQ [7, 31, 38, 39]. The PAO1\u2206pqsA strain is a deletion strain that lacks production of AQs, yielding a biologically relevant matrix devoid of AQs [40]. P. aeruginosa strains were cultured from freezer stock onto Luria agar plates and incubated for 18 h at 37 \u00b0C. Five isolated colonies of each strain were used to inoculate 5 mL of Luria broth (LB), representing one biological replicate. Six biological replicates were prepared in LB and incubated at 37 \u00b0C for 18 h. After overnight incubation, LB cultures were diluted in 5 mL dialysed trypticase soy broth media (DTSB) to an OD600 of 0.05 and incubated for 18 h at 37 \u00b0C. DTSB is an iron-deplete media that has been treated with a metal-chelating material, Chelex 100, and then dialysed to remove Chelex 100 and remaining trace metals. This media has been widely used to study iron starvation responses in P. aeruginosa, and has been specifically used to study the impact of iron availability on AQ production [7, 38, 41]. To quantify the impact of iron availability on AQ production, DTSB media was supplemented with either high iron (100 \u03bcM FeCl3) or low iron (0 \u03bcM FeCl3) prior to incubation.",

We next tested whether a C8 column, which would not retain nonpolar AQs as strongly as a C18 column, would reduce the elution times of the different AQs and thus shorten our run time. Using a linear gradient and an Ascentis Express C8 column, we found we could successfully separate the AQ congeners at faster rates than several other pre-existing methods.

PQS molecules demonstrate substantial chromatographic issues, including excessive peak broadening and peak tailing, without the addition of a metal chelator to the solvent system [35, 39]. PQS is capable of coordinating labile iron, which is hypothesized to result in the observed peak tailing [16, 35]. The addition of chelating agents to the mobile phase is thought to mitigate this effect by limiting contaminating metals, as reported previously [35, 39]. As such, EDTA was incorporated into our assay, as recommended in Ortori et al. With the addition of EDTA, we did not observe peak tailing of PQS, as has been previously reported [35, 39]. Ortori et al. recommended measures to prevent source contamination by the non-volatile EDTA, which were followed for the experiments listed herein. These measures included limiting analytical runs to 120 injections or less prior to cleaning the outer sample cone, and using a flow diverter in between data acquisition windows [39]. While Ortori et al. reported slight ionization suppression of the AQs in the presence of EDTA (> 20% reduction in peak area), we observed that the described solvent system was still able to accurately and precisely measure AQs at concentrations well below those observed in bacterial culture (Table 1 and ESM Table S6). Therefore, the solvent system was deemed acceptable. In addition, there did not appear to be any detrimental effects of EDTA on other methods being performed on the shared-access instrument used in these studies, as had been reported in Turnpenny et al.

AQs are known to interact or embed in lipid bilayers, which may account for lower recovery values of some AQ standards, notably C9-PQS and HHQ [44\u201347]. Additionally, as low recoveries were most pronounced at low concentrations, AQ adherence to surfaces during sample preparation may play a role. Low recoveries due to surface adherence can be exacerbated at low concentration [48]. Matrix effects were also variable among the different AQ standards, ranging from 16.0 to 129.5% (Table 2). These results indicate that ionization is impacted for several AQ standards in the presence of the complex cellular matrix. The recovery efficiency and matrix effects observed in this assay preclude accurate quantitation of unknown samples using a calibration curve prepared in neat solvent. As a result, it is highly recommended that matrix matched calibration curves be prepared in cellular matrix (pre-extraction spike) prior to analysis. In doing so, accurate quantitation of AQs will not be adversely affected by matrix effects and recovery efficiency [49, 50].",

The wild-type PAO1 strain and the AQ-deficient PAO1\u2206pqsA mutant were grown in DTSB media and supplemented with either 100 \u03bcM iron (high iron) or with 0 \u03bcM iron (low iron).

Similar to previous analyses, we observed statistically significant increases in concentrations of all AQs in wild type cultures grown in low iron media ranging from 1.2-fold to 3.3-fold.

These six congeners represent only a small portion of the numerous AQs produced by P. aeruginosa, however, and over 50 distinct AQs have been observed in P. aeruginosa cultures [31]. These 50+ congeners can be categorized into three primary AQ groups: PQS, AHQs, and AQNOs. The various PQS molecules are differentiated from one another by the length and saturation of their alkyl chains; the same trend applies for AHQ and the AQNO molecules. Due to the similarity in structure among each respective AQ groupings, we have assumed that the analytical performances of the other saturated and unsaturated AQ congeners will be comparable to those of the six fully saturated authentic standards used to validate this method. This assumption is supported by prior literature, in which saturated and unsaturated AQs were quantified using calibration curves constructed from isotopically labeled C7 AQs [31]. Based on this assumption, we quantified numerous saturated and unsaturated AQ congeners in low iron and high iron conditions using calibration curves constructed for the fully saturated C7 and C9 congeners, the results of which are listed in ESM Table S6. To do so, we compared analyte responses of all altered AQs with chain lengths of 7 or less to calibration curves of the fully saturated C7 congeners, while those of AQs with chains lengths of 8 carbons or more were compared to calibration curves for fully saturated C9 congeners. Chromatograms of saturated and unsaturated AQ congeners are shown in ESM Figs. S2 and S3. For unsaturated AHQ cis and trans forms of the unsaturated congeners eluted at close proximity to one another, forming two distinct peaks with no baseline resolution (ESM Fig. S3). For these congeners, peak areas were integrated as one, comprising the combined areas of both cis and trans forms of the molecule. Relative elution time of AQs with altered alkyl chain lengths or degrees of unsaturation corresponded proportionally to elution times described in Lepine et al. [31]. In total, we quantified 22 AQ congeners with altered chain lengths and/or unsaturated alkyl chains. Average concentrations of unsaturated AQ congeners were greater in low iron cultures than in high iron cultures, ranging from 33 nM to 3.0 \u03bcM in low iron conditions and from <LLOQ to 1.0 \u03bcM in high iron conditions. Average concentrations of fully saturated AQs were also enhanced in low iron, ranging from 25 nM to 1.7 \u03bcM in low iron and from <LLOQ to 1.0 \u03bcM. These results demonstrate that iron deprivation enhances production of all measured AQ congeners and further suggests that AQs may also have a biological function in iron-depleted conditions. It is unclear, however, how these other AQs may contribute to infection in the iron-limiting host environment.",

These studies suggest that AQs play a significant role during lung infections, although little is known about their relative contributions. Mouse models have facilitated the study of acute and chronic P. aeruginosa lung infections [21\u201323]. However, in order to study the impact of individual AQs, there is a need for accurate and precise methods for detecting and quantifying these molecules in tissue samples. As such, we applied the validated method described above to test whether AQs could be quantified in uninfected CD1 mice (n = 10) and mice infected with wild type P. aeruginosa PAO1 (n = 6). Despite high concentrations of AQs observed in cell culture, we did not observe C7-PQS, HHQ, HQNO, or NQNO in any of the infected mice. NHQ, however, was present in concentrations ranging from <LLOQ to 6770 nM. C9-PQS was detected in two of the infected mice, yet levels were below the lower limit of quantitation (ESM Table S7). We compared NHQ concentrations in infected mouse lung to bacterial burden in the lung (ESM Table S8), however there was no strong correlation between bacterial burden and AQ concentrations observed in mouse lungs (R2 = 0.34). Interestingly, HHQ was detected in one of the uninfected mouse lungs at a concentration of 25 nM. It is unclear whether this is due to matrix interference, or whether endogenous bacterial populations in the uninfected lung may have produced HHQ at these concentrations.",

The validation experiments detailed herein are intended to characterize technical properties of the various AQs that have not been previously reported in the literature, including bench-top stability, autosampler stability, and freeze-thaw stability. Moreover, the current method features improved chromatography and coverage of the different quinolone congeners compared to other existing methods. Importantly, we characterized each of these validation parameters in a biologically relevant cell culture matrix comprised of the AQ-deficient P. aeruginosa strain, \u2206pqsA. As demonstrated above, this has helped to identify limitations in bacterial cell extraction that have not been explored in prior works. For instance, we observe that HHQ, NHQ, NQNO, and C9-PQS all exhibit poor recovery values from cell culture in one or more QC concentration. These findings are similar to those reported in Ortori et al. wherein they reported poor recovery of C7- and C9-PQS from sterile media [35, 39]. However, we observe that the blank \u2206pqsA cell culture used in the current report exhibited more complex matrix effects than sterile media, suggesting that the presence of bacterial cells may exert additional confounding effects on analyte recovery and performance. In support of this, recent studies have demonstrated that PQS integrates into the lipid bilayer of P. aeruginosa, and that AHQ molecules readily interact with outer membrane components [44\u201346]. AQNOs, as well, are shown to interact with membrane-embedded cytochrome bc1 complex in P. aeruginosa [47]. We anticipate, therefore, that the ability of these molecules to embed into lipid membranes and/or adhere to surfaces may alter recovery efficiency of AQs from cell culture and other complex matrices, especially at low concentration. Indeed, we observed variable recovery of the AQ congeners when extracted from mouse lung tissue, as well, suggesting that matrix effects are a significant limitation to accurate quantitation. As a result, it is imperative that matrix matched calibration samples are prepared in cellular culture (or otherwise relevant biological matrix) in order to correct for matrix effects and recovery efficiency of the AQ species, and to ensure accurate and precise quantitation of AQs in unknown samples [49, 50].",

It is a clean deletion mutant in a PAO1 background, meaning that it possesses all of the cellular structures and physiology of P. aeruginosa, but produces virtually no AQs. Interestingly, we observed background signal at the retention time and mass transition corresponding to C9-PQS in this matrix. Because the \u2206pqsA mutant is a clean deletion that lacks the requisite enzyme for PQS production, it is unclear what could account for this background signal. It is possible that this signal is derived from contamination in the culture media by wild-type P. aeruginosa, although the presence of this signal across multiple independent biological replicates at consistent signal intensity would suggest this is not the case. Alternately, it may be the result of interference from an unrelated product ion, although further study would be required to verify this. In any case, peak intensity of this transition in blank matrix was less than in LLOQ QC samples (< 25% peak intensity), and the peak intensity of this molecule in blank matrix was roughly 100\u00d7 less than the lowest AQ peak intensity observed in P. aeruginosa wild-type culture. As such, this interference will not dramatically skew analyses of AQs in bacterial culture. By characterizing these analytical performance parameters in cellular matrix, our approach will allow for confident and robust quantification during relevant experimental conditions.",

While stable isotope-labeled internal standards are ideal for quantitative LC-MS/MS assays, synthesizing or purchasing stable isotope forms of each AQ congeners is highly impractical. To circumvent this issue, we used nalidixic acid due to its cost-efficiency, structural similarity to AQs, and similar retention time. By doing so, we are able to precisely and accurately quantitate AQ concentrations in cell culture despite changes in instrument performance over time. We then applied this quantitative method to measure AQs in P. aeruginosa cultures grown in conditions of either high or low iron availability. Previous analyses have demonstrated this phenomenon using semi-quantitative methods [7]. However, the methods used in these previous studies measured only relative concentrations and could not correct for variations in instrument performance. Therefore, the data provided in the present report represents the strongest evidence yet that AQ production is enhanced in low iron, presumably as part of the iron acquisition strategy of P. aeruginosa. We also observed that concentrations of non-traditional AQ congeners are enhanced in low iron conditions as well, which has not been previously demonstrated. While these altered AQ congeners are present at lower concentrations than the fully saturated C7 and C9 forms, studies have indicated that quinolone molecules with altered alkyl chains can exhibit heightened biological activity relative to their fully saturated C7 or C9 counterparts [32, 53]. Therefore, the concentrations of these AQ congeners may not be reflective of their relative biological significance.",

In vitro studies indicate that AQs play a significant role in quorum signaling and electron transport inhibition, and reports have shown that deletion of the AQ regulator pqsR attenuates P. aeruginosa virulence in an acute murine lung infection model [58]. These reports suggest AQs may contribute significantly to disease state. However, there have been no published studies testing the direct impact of AQs during acute or chronic lung infection, to the best of our knowledge. In addition, no analytical methods have been reported that can quantitate all C7 and C9 AQ congeners in lung tissue. While Turnpenny et al. reported a viable, efficient method for quantitation of HHQ and C7-PQS in mouse lung, there is still need of comprehensive methods for the quantitation of AQNOs, C9-PQS, NHQ, and other AQ congeners in lung tissue. To address this gap in knowledge, we applied the LC-MS/MS method described above to quantitation of AQ congeners in lung tissue excised from PAO1-infected mice, to determine whether this method would be suitable to in vivo studies of AQ production and function during lung infection. As described above, we were able to quantify NHQ in homogenized lung tissue. While we did not observe strong correlation between NHQ concentrations and bacterial burden in these mouse lungs, we did observe generally higher concentrations of NHQ in the more densely colonized male mice (ESM Tables S7 and S8). A possible correlation between these two variables in mouse lungs may be more perceptible upon further optimization of this method for analysis in lung tissues. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first reported instance of quantifiable AQs in infected murine lung tissue. However, the relative recovery efficiencies of the different AQs were highly variable across different QC concentrations and were often very low (< 20%). Considering that concentrations of AQs are already hypothesized to be very low in lung tissue as a result of rapid clearance [35], further optimization will be required in order to reliably quantitate each of the AQ congeners in homogenized lung. Attempts to optimize this method for in vivo use were not included in this report, however, as it fell outside the scope of the current study objectives. It should be noted that the non-detectable results for AQs in lung tissue reported in ESM Table S7 is possibly due to a low bacterial burden in the lung tissue assayed, not due to analytical challenges. In these samples, the bacterial burden ranges from 3.5e2 to 1.3e4 CFU (ESM Table S8) as compared to the cell culture studies which were typically 2.5e9 or 1.3e10 CFU/ml, which is 5\u20138 orders of magnitude higher than the bacterial burden in the lung.",

Method validation experiments were performed in a relevant cellular matrix comprised of an AQ-depleted \u2206pqsA P. aeruginosa strain. The validated assay was applied to the quantitation of AQs in cultures of P. aeruginosa grown in either low or high iron conditions, and also to the quantitation of AQs in lung tissue from wild type P. aeruginosa PAO1-infected and uninfected mice. Moreover, we applied this validated method to the quantitation of AQs with altered chain lengths and degree of unsaturation in bacterial culture, which are significantly induced by iron starvation. This method provides framework for future studies of the diverse AQs produced by P. aeruginosa, and how AQ production contributes to the dynamic response of P. aeruginosa to different growth environments. However, the utility of this method for the measurement of AQs in lung tissue is limited, and we highlight the need for optimized protocols for AQ analysis in this matrix.",
