There are no vaccines for human use or antiviral drugs available to prevent or treat infections with any of these viruses. The development of efficacious and safe drugs and vaccines is a pressing matter. Ideally, such antivirals possess pan-bunyavirus antiviral activity, allowing the containment of every bunya-related threat. The fact that many bunyaviruses need to be handled in laboratories with biosafety level 3 or 4, the great variety of species and the frequent emergence of novel species complicate such efforts. We here examined the potential druggable targets of bunyaviruses, together with the level of conservation of their biological functions, structure, and genetic similarity by means of heatmap analysis. In the light of this, we revised the available models and tools currently available, pointing out directions for antiviral drug discovery.",

            "text": "The L-protein is responsible for transcription of the (\u2212)ssRNA and replication of new vRNA. Both these processes occur in the cytosol where newly translated L-proteins can interact with either additional L-proteins to facilitate replication or with newly synthesized vRNA to be assembled into new viral particles. 5 While the size of the L-proteins may vary between families, three subdomains, ie, the finger, palm, and thumb can be distinguished in all L-proteins. The relative orientation of these three subdomains defines the catalytic cavity, which can be attuned to facilitate different stages of replication. 6 All L-proteins recognize highly conserved complementary 3\u2032 and 5\u2032 extremities of the genome segments that either form a double stranded \"pan-handle\" bound by the L-protein or both ends are bound separately to the L-protein. 7, 8 These 5\u2032 and 3\u2032 UTR are acting as promotor and transcription termination signal for the viral polymerase. 9,10 Similar regions were found in influenza viruses, where they also contribute to the activation of several polymerase functions. 11 The endonuclease and RdRp domains of the L-protein are present throughout the bunyaviruses and share functional characteristics and structural similarities with other (\u2212)stranded segmented viruses such as arenaviruses and orthomyxoviruses ( Figure 3A ). 12 The endonuclease domain is responsible for cap snatching, which initiates transcription in all orthomyxoviruses, arenaviruses, and bunyaviruses. The endonuclease cleaves the 5\u2032-end of host mRNAs to acquire primers for viral mRNA transcription. The manganesedependent endonuclease domain of bunyaviruses is located at the N-terminus of the L-protein, with exception of the nairoviruses where it is located more downstream ( Figure 3A) . 13, 14 The aa similarity of the endonuclease domain of species within the four studied bunyaviral families is 50% to 80% conserved, whereas between families, this is 30% to 45%. The degree of similarity with the arena and influenza domains is 28% to 45% and 22% to 38%, respectively ( Figures 3B and   S2 ). However, within the active site of these domains, there are motifs that are highly conserved (H..E/D..PD..E/D). 15 Their crucial function and conserved regions makes such domains a suitable target for antiviral endeavors. Successes have already been achieved against the endonuclease of influenza, confirming this enzyme is indeed a druggable target. 16 Such compounds include endonuclease inhibitors pimodivir/JNJ872 (formally VX-787), which is active against a diverse panel of influenza A virus strains and influenza JNJ5806 (formally AL-794) (J&J/Alios) and S-033188 (Shionogi). 17 This not only shows that the endonuclease is a viable drug target but its conservation among strains and species may also indicate possibilities for the development of pan-bunya inhibitors. However, it is not self-evident that such compounds will be equipotent against all bunyaviruses, since subtle differences remain. is an adenosine nucleoside RdRp-inhibitor currently being developed against filoviruses (e.g., Ebola virus and Marburg virus), also exerts activity against coronaviruses, picornaviruses, paramyxoviruses, flaviviruses, orthomyxoviruses, arenaviruses, and bunyaviruses. 18 GS-5734, a monophosphoramidate prodrug of an adenosine analogue, is being developed as anti-filovirus drug. Its acting range includes also flaviviruses and paramyxoviruses, but not bunyaviruses or arenaviruses. 19 Also favipiravir/T-705 exerts a wide range of anti-RNA-virus inhibition, including some minor activity against bunyaviruses. 20 The antiviral activity of favipiravir is discussed in more detail in Section 4. The similarities between the polymerases of bunyaviruses, arenaviruses, and influenza viruses, ie, their common motifs and similar architecture, could point in the direction of a common ancestor. 6 From an antiviral prospective, this could be a very interesting notion, since a single drug might be able to target them all.",

            "text": "The Bunyamwera virus (BUNV) N-and C-terminal aa's protrude outward from the protein core domain and are able to interact with neighboring N-proteins, causing head-to-tail interactions. 21 This way, these proteins can form ring-shaped tetramers. This multimerization might be a flexible feature though, since it was observed that Schmallenberg virus (SBV) N-proteins form both tetrameric and hexameric multimers. 22 N-N-protein interactions were also found in BUNV and Leanyer virus (LEAV), suggesting this is at least a genuswide conserved feature. 23, 24 The structure of LEAV shows two distinct domains together forming the core domain: an N-lobe and C-lobe ( Figure 5A ). Between these two lobes, a positively charged cleft is formed that can hold 11 nt of ssRNA, which together form filamentous RNPs. The ssRNA is bound to the LEAV N-protein through hydrogen bonds to the backbone and maybe also to the bases. On the surface of the N-protein, there is a hydrophobic region that is suggested to be involved in N-N-protein interactions. 24 (A) (B) The typical two lobed structure of N-proteins was also observed in phleboviruses, but no protruding C-terminal arm observed. These rather appear to be folded back against the protein. 25 Just as in orthobunyaviruses, a strong hydrophobic region was found, which allows interaction with other N-proteins. 26 Even in the sequence dissimilar Uukuniemi virus (UUKV), such N-N interactions have been observed. 27 The hydrophobic region is highly conserved among phleboviruses and is found in a pocket at the N-lobe surface. This allows the typical ring-shaped oligomers to form, but these show variability in size and shape. This indicates structural flexibility of N-protein complexes in combination with RNA. The ring shape was also seen in TOSV N-protein oligomers, but on introducing RNA to such oligomers, a helical RNP was observed. 28 The binding of RNA in this ring-or helical-shaped manner allows it to be concealed. Binding of RNA occurs at the interface of the N-protein N-and C-lobe where a cleft is formed containing a positively charged patch that allows, in case of RVFV, the binding of six RNA bases. Such a hydrophobic patch is conserved among phleboviruses. 25 While the N-protein of hantaviruses has almost twice the molecular weight as the same protein in orthobunyaviruses and phleboviruses, similar structural properties are observed. There are the N-and C-terminal arms and subsequent binding pockets that together regulate N-N-protein interactions, and there is the hydrophobic cleft at the interface of the N-and C-lobes to accommodate RNA. 29 On top of these similarities, there are some additional functionalities attributed to hantaviral N-proteins. It has been demonstrated that trimers of the protein can substitute the eukaryotic initiation factor 4F (eIF4F) cap-binding complex, which is responsible for translation initiation. By taking over the helicase function of eIF4A subunits, binding to initiation complexes like eIF4G and binding to 5\u2032 m7G caps just like eIF4E, it makes eIF4F obsolete. 30 The N-protein facilitates the association of ribosomal protein S19 and the viral mRNA 5\u2032 UTR allowing ribosomes to be loaded onto the mRNA. 31 Furthermore, N-proteins are able to interfere with cellular mRNA decay by associating with processing bodies (P bodies), which are hot spots for cap snatching. 32 Besides these translational-enhancing properties, the hantavirus N-protein has also been found to interfere in host innate immune responses. 33 Nairovirus N-proteins do not share the common N-and C-lobe structure described above. Their N-proteins have a racket shape that consists of a globular (or head) domain and a stalk domain. 34 However, the RNA-binding domains overlap with other functional sites; thus, it seems likely that in an RNA-bound state, the other abilities are inhibited. 37 It was shown that CCHFV N-protein allows cap-independent translation of viral RNA by interacting with eIF4G, but details about these interactions are lacking. 38 The structure of the N-protein of CCHFV seems to be shared by all nairoviruses, since structures of HAZV, Kupe virus (KUPV), and Erve virus (EREV) showed very similar structures, although functionality might slightly vary. 39 Our own aa similarity comparison of the N-proteins shows there is very limited similarity between viral families; this is substantial within families ( Figure 5B ) (Supporting Information). Within hantaviruses, the sequence is especially conserved, from 62% up to 78%.",

This variability is reflected in the wide range of host cell receptors that have been described (see Section 3) and could make it difficult to use these domains as a target for broad-acting antivirals. Moreover, viruses have shown that they can easily mutate their receptor-binding interface to escape the drug pressure and pay little to no cost in fitness to do so. This would quickly lead to the emergence of drug resistant variants, thus rendering antivirals targeting these domains ineffective. The domain that is directed inwards into the virion is able to interact with the N-proteins of the RNP or directly with the RNA. 46, 47 The disruption of these critical interactions could interfere with the viral replication cycle, making them potentially good antiviral targets.",

Bunyaviruses may, depending on the family, viral species, or type of host cell, use different cellular targets for attachment and employ different host entry pathways. For the Phenuiviridae family and a variety of bunyaviruses, the most widely described attachment factor is dendritic cell-specific ICAM-grabbing nonintegrin (DC-SIGN). Mutations or knock down of these molecules result in lower infection rates in vitro. [57] [58] [59] A second attachment factor in these viruses is L-SIGN, another human C-type lectin, which shares a 77% aa sequence homology to DC-SIGN. 60 Even though these factors have not been extensively studied in other bunyaviruses, they are involved in the infection pathway of other viruses such as dengue, Lassa, and hepatitis C virus. [61] [62] [63] It was recently shown that heparan sulfate proteoglycan is also an important attachment factor for the SBV and Akabene orthobunyaviruses (AKAV). 64 Hantaviruses use integrin as receptor for cell entry: \u03b2 1 integrin by nonpathogenic hantaviruses and \u03b2 3 integrin by the pathogenic species in vitro. 65 Cell entry varies between bunyaviruses, with clathrin-mediated, calveolin-mediated, and independent endocytosis all being described in one or more bunyaviruses, depending also on the host cell type. 66, 67 Envelope fusion with the endosomal membrane is thought to be triggered by the acidification of the late endosome, which initiate a conformational change of the viral particle glycoproteins. However, it was recently shown that also potassium channels play a crucial role in this step and thus could be potential druggable targets. 58, [68] [69] [70] [71] In UUKV, this is promoted by the presence of the late endosomal phospholipid bis(monoacylglycero)-phosphate (BMP). 72 Essential histidine residues have been identified in the RVFV Gc-protein by mutational analysis, which serve as sensors for acidification in endosomal lumen and often define the optimal pH value for virus fusion. 73, 74 Hantaviruses depend heavily on cholesterol for membrane fusion. 75 The Puumala virus (PUUV) Gc has shown to be the membrane fusion effector, and it presents a class II membrane fusion protein fold in its postfusion conformation. 76, 77 Such a fold was also observed in RVFV. 78 ",

This could be the bunyavirus alternative to matrix proteins, since the tail domain of the glycoproteins is able to interact with the RNP and initiate assembly of new viral particles. 46, 84 The assembly of RVFV is induced by an interaction between the RNP N-proteins and the viral glycoproteins. This seems to be a nonselective process that results in particles carrying a random amount of genomic segments. 85 It is not evident that this mechanism is the same for all bunyaviruses. In CCHFV, the Gn cytosolic tail directly binds to the RNA to initiate assembly. 86 This could enable a more specific selection of genomic segments. Besides, it was shown that assembly mechanisms depend not only on the virus species but also on the type of cell that is infected. 87 ",

Infection starts with attachment of the virus to the host cell receptors, a process mediated by the viral glycoproteins and endocytosis. Due to a pH drop, the endosomal and viral membrane will fuse, and the genome is released into the cytosol. The viral L-protein catalyzes primary transcription of viral mRNAs, which will translate into new structural proteins and (depending on the species) nonstructural proteins. The three negative-sense vRNA segments are converted into positive-sense cRNA that will serve as template for novel RNPs. These will be transported to the Golgi complex where it will interact with newly translated glycoproteins to commence assembly processes. The new viral particle will bud from the Golgi and will be transported out of the cell alternative would be the CCHFV AP92 or AP92-like strains, which have a moderately reduced virulence compared with the wild-type virus. However, a first lethal case has been reported. 89, 90 This, together with the lack of a detailed virulence and safety studies, makes that in most countries this is still classified as a BSL-4 pathogen.

The drug has also been suggested for the treatment of Ebola infections, and clinical trials have been performed despite concerns of teratogenicity shown in animals. 115 These trials showed favipiravir to be well tolerated and decrease the mortality of patients with the low viral load. 116 Promising data obtained in preclinical experiments, together with positive ",

These RNA segments, together with oligomers of N-proteins, form looped RNP. A single L-protein is bound to each of the RNA segments (Figure 2). The large segment (L segment) encodes the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp), or L-protein, which is responsible for the production of complementary RNA (cRNA) and viral RNA (vRNA).
