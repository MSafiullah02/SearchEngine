On the basis of this information, all types of in-person sexual activity probably carry risk for SARS-CoV-2 transmission. Infected individuals have the potential to spread respiratory secretions onto their skin and personal objects, from which the virus can be transmitted to a sexual partner. Because many SARS-CoV-2\u2013infected people are asymptomatic, HCPs are left with little to offer beyond guidance to not engage in any in-person sexual activity.",

An additional study of semen samples from 38 patients detected the virus by reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction in 6 patients (15.8%) (4). However, the relevance regarding sexual transmission remains unknown. Until this is better understood, it would be prudent to consider semen potentially infectious. Although 1 study failed to detect the virus in urine samples (5), there is evidence that SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acids were detected in a urine sample in at least 1 patient in another study (6). Until this is clarified, urine should also be considered potentially infectious. SARS-CoV-2 RNA has been detected in stool samples, raising concern for fecal\u2013oral transmission (7). It is not clear, however, whether viral RNA detected in stool is capable of causing productive infection. Moreover, these data are moot, given that any in-person contact results in substantial risk for disease transmission owing to the virus' stability on common surfaces and propensity to propagate in the oropharynx and respiratory tract.",

Messaging around sex being dangerous may have insidious psychological effects at a time when people are especially susceptible to mental health difficulties.

Abstinence recommendations may conjure memories of the widespread stigmatization of SGM people during the AIDS crisis. For the population at large, a recommendation of long-term sexual abstinence is unlikely to be effective, given the well-documented failures of abstinence-based public health interventions and their likelihood to promote shame (8).",

Patients can be counseled to engage in sexual activity with partners via the telephone or video chat services. Given privacy concerns, they should be counseled to use secure encrypted platforms. They should also be warned about the risks for sexual partners taking screenshots of conversations and relevant risks and laws regarding sexual extortion. For some patients, including those without internet access and minors at home from school who are in environments unaccepting of their sexual orientation, digital sexual practices may not be feasible. During all conversations, HCPs should express a nonjudgmental stance to encourage comfortable discussion and minimize shame. This is particularly important with minors, because fear of judgment can lead them to withhold information about sexual risk behaviors.",

Though we currently lack data on how long such immunity may last, those who test positive for SARS-CoV-2 antibodies could have relative immunity to the virus. This may allow for the serosorting of individuals for sexual activity, with those testing positive for anti\u2013SARS-CoV-2 antibodies presumed safe to engage in sex together with regard to SARS-CoV-2 transmission, if not for HIV or other sexually transmitted infections. Further research is needed to know if this will be an effective strategy.
