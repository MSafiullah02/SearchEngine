There was also relatively little data on provision of palliative care in community settings, though in two studies a reduction in demand for inpatient care was seen and led to the suggestion to shift resources into the community. 3, 11 Community palliative care can facilitate advance care planning and symptom control and helps prevent hospital admissions among people near the end of life. 14 It is likely that community palliative care may help prevent hospital admissions among people dying from COVID-19 who would prefer to remain at home or in their care home, though this has not been tested. However, the rapid escalation of breathlessness in patients with COVID-19 who develop acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) may make this challenging. 15 Severe breathlessness and respiratory disease are both known to be associated with increased hospital admissions at the end of life. 16 Therefore, rapid community response may be needed to manage advanced disease in COVID-19 if people are to remain at home.",
