In this case, a nutrient load that is discharged at the head of the bay is transported to distant locations and, probably, the water exchange rate of the bay also increases. The nutrient loading that is permissible \u2014 i.e. which the bay can accept \u2014 will then increase due to the increase in the water exchange rate. For water retention rates, the strength of currents is not as important as spatial patterns. For example, tidal currents are dominant in urban coastal areas. However they are oscillatory. Water particles in tidal currents move to the head of the bay during flood tides, but move back to the mouth of the bay during ebb tides. As a result, tidal currents do not substantially transport water particles. In contrast, density currents are clearly weaker than tidal currents, but they flow in one direction continuously and transport water particles more efficiently. As a result, they substantially effect water retention times and ecosystem characteristics.",

In particular, a coastline near an urban coastal area is more complex, due to reclamations and the constructions of harbors, than a natural one. In addition, the uniformity of the bathymetry further lessened as a result of dredging for vessel transport. A computational grid is required to accurately represent such complex geometry and bathymetry. For this reason, the selection of which grid system to use has varied along with the progress of modeling, although the governing equations are not basically different.",

            "text": "In urban coastal areas, density difference plays an essential role for water quality and currents. One of the most important phenomena induced by the density effect is stratification. Once stratification occurs in a coastal zone, surface water and bottom water are isolated. This process is very important when we discuss the distributions of pollutants from the land. Stratification also enhances the increase of phytoplankton in the surface layer and oxygen depletion near the seabed. Moreover, estuarine circulation is induced by density differences in the salty sea water and the river flow. Fig. 3-3 shows a schematic diagram of estuarine circulation. River water runs through the urban area and runs offfrom the river mouth, spreading over the sea surface like a veil since river water has low density compared with saline sea water. To cancel the density difference between the river water and the saline water, a great deal of sea water is entrained into the river water flow. Such a mixing process continues until the river water reaches the same density as the surrounding sea water, resulting in vertical circulation in the bays that is is several to ten times greater than the river flux (Unoki 1998). Thus, estuarine circulation induces seaward currents on the surface and landward currents near the bottom. The speed of the currents is slow compared with the tidal currents, as explained previously. Since estuarine circulations are in a fixed direction, its material transport is very effective over a long time scale in spite of the small magnitude of its velocity.\n\n",

In conclusion, nitrogen and phosphorus showed important differences in the mechanisms by which they cycle in the bay. The regeneration of nutrients and their release from the sediment is an important source for phytoplankton growth and is equal to the contributions from the rivers. Phosphorus in particular is largely retained within the system through recycling between sediment and water.

This index of fecal colif-orm includes not only E. coli but also others. However, it is well known that the majority of the fecal coliform in this area comes from E. coli. Therefore, we use a value of 1000 CFU/100 ml E. coli as the standard for the safety of swimming in the sea. From the calculation results, we can see that durations when the standards are exceeded are very limited, and that most of the summer period falls below the standard for swimming. This result also denotes that the increasing rates of E. coli do not agree with levels of precipitation. Even in small precipitations, E. coli significantly increased.\n\n",

In this spring tide period, tidal ranges can reach 2 m. Small precipitations were measured from August 29th to 30th. River discharge increased with precipitation, reaching 50 m 3/s. The levels of E. coli increased rapidly after the rainfall event, due mainly to discharges from the Sunamachi and Chibaura areas. Near the end of this period of increase, effluent from Morigasaki also reached the Odaiba area. Fig. 3-22 shows the spatial distributions of E. coli from three different times. From this Fig., the E. coli emitted from the Morigasaki area can be seen to have been transported from the lower region of the bay to the Odaiba area. This is because the small amount of river discharge resulted in a thin layer of low-density, highly concentrated E. coli on the surface of the sea, and tended to isolate the E. coli by preventing it from mixing with the water column.\n\n\n",

We applied this model to the Tokyo Bay and simulated water column temperatures, salinity, and nutrient concentrations that were closely linked with field observations. This model successfully captured periods of timing, stratification events, and subsequent changes in bottom water oxygen and nutrients. Our model results also indicated that there were clear differences between the material cycles of nitrogen and phosphorus inside the bay. The regeneration of nutrients and its release from sediment was found to be a source of phytoplankton growth on the same order of importance as contributions from rivers.
