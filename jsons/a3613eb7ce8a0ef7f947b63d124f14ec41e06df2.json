In the case of Bolivia, the less developed nation of South America, national and international cooperation, advise and support, lead to enhance surveillance and early case detection of COVID-19, scaling up the training activities at the healthcare sector and the community for proper education as well as quarantine. In this report, the first 12 confirmed cases were analyzed, showing that most of the evolve positively with no severe disease nor fatalities. Nevertheless, preparedness for a significant epidemic, as is going on in other countries, and the deployment of response plans for it, in the country is now taking place to mitigate the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic in the population.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Discussion"}, {"text": "Preparedness in South America should include the increase in the diagnostic capacity for rapid testing for the virus, including not only imported but also secondary and tertiary cases. It is important to avoid the delay from identification of suspected cases to their confirmation and isolation, in order to affect the possible disease transmission [25] . Also, there is a need for improvement of the volume of personnel trained to run such tests, and to warrant an adequate stock of materials needed to do them. Health authorities should train, equip, and strengthen the diagnostic capacities of hospital laboratories close to infectious disease and emergency departments to reduce the time to deliver results, manage confirmed cases and contacts more rapidly, and preserve strict infection control measures [25] . Finally, in the differential diagnosis with other febrile conditions, especially in Latin America, also coinfections with dengue [75] and with respiratory viruses, such as Influenza and Metapneumovirus [80] [81] [82] , among others, already reported together with SARS-CoV-2, should be considered.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 349, "end": 353, "text": "[25]", "ref_id": "BIBREF24"}, {"start": 809, "end": 813, "text": "[25]", "ref_id": "BIBREF24"}, {"start": 945, "end": 949, "text": "[75]", "ref_id": "BIBREF75"}, {"start": 1018, "end": 1022, "text": "[80]", "ref_id": "BIBREF80"}, {"start": 1023, "end": 1027, "text": "[81]", "ref_id": "BIBREF81"}, {"start": 1028, "end": 1032, "text": "[82]", "ref_id": "BIBREF82"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Discussion"}, {"text": "The main limitation of our study is the lack of long follow up of the patients, but this analysis is a rapid preliminary study for the outbreak assessment in Bolivia, focused on epidemiological and clinical aspects.

More comprehensive contact tracing for these cases should be performed to assess the possibility of community transmission.
