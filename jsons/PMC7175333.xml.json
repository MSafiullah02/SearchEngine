In addition, regulatory approval of drugs for use in humans can be complex for the development of multicomponent nanomedicines.24 Technologies that would allow de novo nanoparticle assemblies in the hosts from materials that are inexpensive, simple, and stable, which bypass these complex biochemical processes and downstream purifications, may be of interest.",

DLnano_LS_GT8 induced stronger humoral responses than corresponding DNA\u2010launched monomeric GT8 (DLmono_GT8) both in mice and guinea pigs, and also uniquely elicited CD8+ T\u2010cell immunity unlike the corresponding protein nanovaccines. We computationally designed alternative nanoparticle scaffolds and utilized different immunogens to evaluate this approach more broadly. Consistent improvements in the induction of adaptive immune responses were observed across multiple constructs, which was further shown to confer significant benefits in protecting mice from lethal influenza challenge. Synthetic DNA/electroporation (DNA/EP) technology can, therefore, be used to direct in vivo assembly of computationally designed nanovaccines, which elicit more potent functional immunological responses. This combination is likely important for rapid development of vaccines and immunotherapies.",

We first evaluated expression, secretion, and assembly of plasmid encoded GT8 constructs in vitro. We engineered the GT8 constructs to incorporate an optimized human IgE\u2010leader sequence34 and found the in vitro intracellular expression of this construct to be strongly enhanced as compared to GT8 constructs without any leader sequence (Figure S1a, Supporting Information). We therefore used the IgE constructs for subsequent experiments. In addition, reducing SDS\u2010PAGE analysis of transfection supernatants supported that both plasmid\u2010encoded GT8\u2010monomer and eOD\u2010GT8\u201060mer could be secreted (Figure S1b, Supporting Information). Lectin\u2010purified protein eOD\u2010GT8\u201060mer eluted as a homogenous fraction by SEC (Figure S1c, Supporting Information).

Reducing SDS\u2010PAGE Western analyses of muscle homogenates 4 d.p.i. with VRC01 (in green) also confirmed in vivo expression of GT8 antigens, even though in vivo expression of DLnano_LS_GT8 was stronger and more consistent than DLmono_GT8 (Figure 1e).

Clusters of gold\u2010labeled macromolecules suggestive of in vivo\u2010launched nanoparticles decorated with multiple copies of GT8 were only observed in mice injected with DLnano_LS_GT8 but not with DLmono_GT8 (Figure 1h; Figure S1h, Supporting Information). In DLnano_LS_GT8\u2010immunized mice, these clusters often had a valency greater than 10 (Figure 1i). We expected some reduction in labeling valency due to both steric hindrance in binding of VRC01 to individual GT8 subunits and limited solvent exposure on nanoparticle surfaces with thin sample sectioning. Quantitative measurements of the orders of clusters in different fields of interests demonstrated that partially formed (orders between 5 and 8) and well\u2010formed (orders no less than 9) nanoparticles were significantly more frequent in mice treated with DLnano_LS_GT8 than with DLmono_GT8, confirming in vivo assembly of these complex nanovaccines (Figure S1i, Supporting Information).",

            "text": "Using immunofluorescence staining with VRC01 (green), we determined that DLnano_LS_GT8 trafficked more efficiently to the draining lymph node and colocalized with the CD35+ follicular dendritic cells (in blue) in contrast with the DLmono_GT8 7 d.p.i. (Figure\n\n2a). This observation is consistent with recent findings on trafficking of recombinant protein nanoparticle vaccines.26 To determine whether improved immunogen trafficking correlated with enhanced adaptive immunity, we followed humoral responses in immunized BALB/c mice. After 7 d.p.i., we found that DLnano_LS_GT8 induced more rapid GT8\u2010directed seroconversion than DLmono_GT8 (Figure 2b). Decoration of the GT8\u2010antigens on the LS nanoparticle core is essential for the observed early response as cotransfection of mice muscles with 1:1 ratio of DLmono_GT8 and DNA\u2010encoded LS core (DLnano_LS_core) did not lead to seroconversion at this timepoint (Figure S2a, Supporting Information). We next examined whether GT8 scaffolded with a simpler multimerization domain, IMX313P, would perform similarly. Heptameric DNA\u2010encoded GT8\u2010IMX313P (DL_GT8_IMX313P) led to limited seroconversion at 7 d.p.i., but the induced antibody titer was 6.9\u2010fold lower than that of DLnano_LS_GT8 (Figure S2b, Supporting Information). Antigen\u2010specific circulating IgMs can play a role in protection from challenge.45 Here, we measured induced IgM responses and found that DLnano_LS_GT8 induced stronger IgM responses than DLmono_GT8 with two immunizations (Figure S2c, Supporting Information). Further, the IgG titers were 1.3\u2010log and 1.8\u2010log higher for DLnano_LS_GT8 with single immunization (Figure S2d, Supporting Information) or two immunizations (Figure 2c), respectively. Consistent with this observation, we found the frequency of CD19+IgD\u2010IgM\u2010IgG+ GT8 antigen\u2010specific B cells in the spleens of mice immunized with DLnano_LS_GT8 to be 5.3\u2010fold higher relative to mice immunized with DLmono_GT8 (Figure 2d), even though relatively few CD19+IgD\u2010IgM\u2010IgG+GT8\u201024mer+GT8\u2010tetramer+ B cells have been recovered per million splenocytes analyzed (Figure S2e, Supporting Information). DLnano_LS_GT8 retained folding and presentation of a key conformational epitope in vivo, as elicited murine antibodies could outcompete VRC01 binding to GT8 in competition of ELISA (Figure S2f, Supporting Information, and Figure 2e). A striking dose\u2010sparing effect was observed for DLnano_LS_GT8. While humoral responses were remarkably attenuated for DLmono_GT8 at 2 and 10 \u00b5g doses (Figure S2g, Supporting Information), DLnano_LS_GT8 given at 2, 10, or 25 \u00b5g doses all induced similar levels of antibody responses (Figure S2h, Supporting Information). Importantly, differences in antibody responses induced by DLnano_LS_GT8 and DLmono_GT8 were probably not solely due to increased antigen expression for DLnano_LS_GT8 (Figure 1e), as DLnano_LS_GT8 still outperformed DLmono_GT8 at less than one\u2010tenth of the monomer dose (Figure 2f).",

(Figure 4c), even though in vivo expression of DLnano_PfV_GT8 was found to be stronger on average than DLnano_3BVE_GT8 by SDS\u2010PAGE analysis (Figure 4d). Functionally, BALB/c mice immunized with DLnano_3BVE_GT8, DLnano_LS_GT8 and DLnano_PfV_GT8 all rapidly seroconverted 7 d.p.i. and mounted stronger antibody responses over the 5 week period than mice immunized with DLmono_GT8 (Figure 4e). In addition, BALB/c mice immunized with two doses of DLnano_3BVE_GT8, DLnano_LS_GT8, and DLnano_PfV_GT8 all developed stronger CD8+ effector memory T\u2010cell responses to the antigenic GT8 domain than those immunized with DLmono_GT8 by IFN\u03b3 ELIspot and ICS assays (Figure 4f; Figure S4d,e, Supporting Information).",

We observed improved induction of binding antibody responses in mice immunized with DLnano_3BVE_HA_CA09 than those with DLmono_HA_CA09 (Figure\n\n6a). Five weeks after the first immunization, we observed significant eightfold improvement in HAI titers in mice immunized with DLnano_3BVE_HA_CA09 than those with DLmono_HA_CA09 (Figure 6b).

Each mouse was intranasally inoculated with 10LD50 homologous H1/California/07/09 virus and was followed up for 2 weeks for weight loss. Any mouse losing more than 20% of baseline body weight would have met the humane endpoint for euthanasia. In this experiment, we observed only mice immunized with DLnano_3BVE_HA_CA09 fully survived the lethal challenge (Figure 6c), whereas 40% (2/5) of mice immunized with DLmono_HA_CA09 or 100% (5/5) of mice immunized with control pVAX backbone succumbed to infections.

Homogeneous in vitro assembly of these computationally designed DLnanovaccines is important for their downstream success, as poorly assembled DNA\u2010encoded LS_HA_CA09 did not elicit similarly potent immune responses (Figure S5f, Supporting Information). Homogeneous in vitro assembly will likely help increase the fraction of more fully assembled nanoparticles in vivo, contributing to the overall immunogenicity of the vaccine. It is in theory possible that the improved immunogenicity described here can be attributed to differences in levels of antigen expression. However, two observations suggest that antigen expression is not solely responsible for improved responses. First, we showed that DLnano_LS_GT8 induced stronger humoral responses than DLmono_GT8 in BALB/c mice at less than one\u2010tenth of the dose (Figure 2f). Second, while DLnano_PfV_GT8 expressed at higher levels in vivo than DLnano_3BVE_GT8 (Figure 4d), DLnano_PfV_GT8 and DLnano_3BVE_GT8 induced similar antibody titers and T cell responses at 25 \u00b5g dose (Figure 4e,f). The exact contribution of nanoparticle assembly, expression, and valency for the induction of optimal immune responses will require further investigation.",

The observation that DLnanovaccines function independently of MBL\u2010complement pathway is likely of interest for clinical translation of such vaccines, as approximately 5\u201320% of human populations have MBL deficiency (plasma MBL < 100 ng mL\u20131).53, 54 The role of T cells in immune surveillance to mediate protection provides a strong rationale for exploring this unique property of DLnanovaccine,55 especially for such diseases as liver\u2010stage malaria,56 influenza for the elderlies,57, 58 and cancer.59 The unique ability for DLnano vaccination to induce CD8+ T\u2010cell responses may be related to its distinct mechanism of antigen uptake and presentation. Antigen\u2010presenting cells, such as macrophages, are known to migrate into the site of EPto scavenge antigens expressed through DNA cassettes associated with apoptotic cells.49 Prior studies observed that co\u2010delivery of DNA vaccines with proapoptotic\u2010mutated Caspase 2 or Fas significantly increased both CD4+ and CD8+ T\u2010cell responses to the vaccine antigens.60, 61 Such distinct mechanism of antigen processing might lead to more efficient cross\u2010presentation to the MHC class I pathway. Additionally, APCs including DCs and macrophages may also be directly transfected with the inoculated DNA cassettes in vivo,62, 63 and the two mechanisms may be synergistic in the induction of CD8+ T\u2010cell immunity. Our findings also demonstrated that DLnanovaccine could improve induced CD8+ T\u2010cell responses by eightfold to tenfold relative to their monomeric counterparts. Given that DNAvaccines can already induce CD8+ T\u2010cell responses in patients to cause histopathological regression of HPV\u2010driven cervical dysplasia,4 the finding is relevant and whether DLnanovaccines can further improve the clinical response rates should be explored.",

A dose of 1 \u00b5g of plasmid DNA, a dose at which we historically would not expect to observe robust seroconversion,64 was able to induce clear functional HAI titers in mice. Fewer immunizations of DLnanovaccine could induce the same, if not higher, titers of antibodies. Given recent advances in the EP technology has improved the potency and consistency of immune responses induced by DNA vaccines in patients,4, 37, 38, 39, 63, 65 it will be important to determine whether DLnanovaccines can also help to reduce doses used in the clinic and lower the number of clinical visits required for vaccination.

Therefore, a method to simplify the process by producing these nanovaccines in the hosts may be relevant. Sample sizes in the study were predetermined by power analyses with results from another set of the pilot studies. All the collected datapoints were included in the final analyses except for a single guinea pig in the DLmono_GT8 group that showed preexisting antibody titers to GT8. All data were collected in at least technical duplicates, and except for the guinea pig and the challenge experiment, all findings were replicated successfully at least once in the study.
