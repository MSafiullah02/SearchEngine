            "text": "Since a color-coding system has been shown to be effective in some industrial environments to identify hazard zones, it could also be useful in the current need for a rapid reorganization of endoscopic departments because of the COVID-19 pandemic. Such a model could contribute to minimizing the risk of contamination and reduce or eliminate wasted time by allowing a fast adherence to new protocols and tasks. Indeed, this operating procedure establishes and identifies the use of colors, signs and signals which should allow for quick recognition of information and hazards in the various work areas. A color code system together with the implementation of new areas and the use of clear visual markers allows a speedy visual search, emphasizes information, shows associations with specific actions and transmits important messages. Furthermore, our method has been shown to be easy to implement, cheap and fast.",
