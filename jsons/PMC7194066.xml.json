Of Note, multiple inflammatory cytokines including IFN-\u03b3 and TNF-\u03b1, have been found to be increased in patients with COVID-19 [2]. These results suggested that SARS-CoV-2 can up-regulate its receptor ACE2 in human host to facilitate their infection and spread. We have detected the serum IFN-\u03b3 and TNF-\u03b1 levels in SLE patients and healthy subjects by using Luminex multiplex assays. Compared with healthy controls, the serum IFN-\u03b3 levels were significant higher in SLE patients (Fig. 1A). Combine with the evidence that up-regulation effect of IFN-\u03b3 on ACE2 expression, the increased levels of IFN-\u03b3 provide another evidence that SLE patients might be inherently more susceptible to SARS-CoV-2 infections.",
