The relationships between virus infections and secondary thrombocytosis were analyzed retrospectively. The blood platelet count and the presence of respiratory viruses were determined for 3156 RTI patients, and 817 (25.9%) cases with platelet \u2265500 \u00d7 10 9 /L were considered as the thrombocytosis group. Compared with the normal group, the detection rates of respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) and human rhinovirus (HRV) were significantly higher in the thrombocytosis group (P = 0.017 and 0.042, respectively). HRV single infection was a risk factor associated with thrombocytosis [odds ratio (OR) = 1.560, 95% confidence interval (CI) = 1.108-2.197]. Furthermore, ST was more likely to occur in younger patients who had clinical manifestations of wheezing and dyspnea and who had been diagnosed with bronchiolitis. Furthermore, the course of disease lasted longer in these patients. ST is associated with viral respiratory tract infections, especially RSV and HRV infections. HRV single infection is a risk factor associated with thrombocytosis.",

The different incidence rates may be explained by the cutoff platelet count, study population (inpatients, outpatients, or both), and median age of the enrolled subjects. Additionally, the platelet count peaked on the 11 th day after the onset of illness. This also supports the findings by other investigators who reported that platelet count in ST peaked during the second and third week of the illness 9,17 . In our cases, the highest incidence of ST occurred in patients who were under two years of age (94.5%), which is consistent with the Mastubara et al. study of Japanese children with thrombocytosis, more than 80% of whom were aged less than two years 18 .

The total virus detection rate was 78.9% (645/817) in patients with ST. RSV (39.5%) was the most commonly detected virus, followed by HRV (22.6%) and PIV (21.8%). From the present data, we found that RSV single infection (especially subtype B) and HRV infection (especially subtype A) were prominent causative agents of thrombocytosis. To our knowledge, our study is the first to find that ST occurrence is associated with HRV infection. In addition, HBoV1 co-infection with other viruses in the mild thrombocytosis group is more common than in the moderate to severe thrombocytosis groups. This may be because this group of patients is frequently co-infected with RSV and HRV. According to the above results, we speculate that increased platelet counts may be indicative of a respiratory tract inflammatory reaction after RSV or HRV infection.",

Reports in the literature show that ST is related to increased endogenous levels of several cytokines, such as thrombopoietin (TPO), interleukin-6 (IL-6), interleukin-8 (IL-8), interleukin-1alpha (IL-1a) and tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-a) [19] [20] [21] . It has been found that during RSV infection, many infants demonstrated RSV-specific cytokine responses, such as increased levels of IL-6 and IL-8 22 . However, ST caused by HRV infection has not been described. Bronchial epithelial cells secrete a wide variety of inflammatory cytokines, including IL-1, IL-6, IL-8, and GM-CSF, and these cytokines are responsible for the development of thrombocytosis following RSV and HRV infections 23, 24 . Furthermore, TPO concentrations usually correlate with CRP levels 25, 26 . Among our thrombocytotic patients, 16.1% (132) had elevated CRP levels; this could indicate that CRP participates in thrombocytosis. Some authors have suggested that anemia may also play a role, and we observed a higher rate of anemia in the thrombocytosis group 5, 7 . Another theory confirmed that the number of megakaryocytes increased and that the pulmonary capillary bed released more platelets due to stimulation by TPO after infection. We believe the specific viral agents that cause RTI induce inflammatory response and circulating cytokines that can then lead to ST and perhaps other hematological disorders.",

More specific studies are needed to further elucidate the inflammatory process involved in viral infection and the specific pathophysiology of thrombocytosis. In summary, research regarding viral respiratory tract infections and thrombocytosis is lacking, and we performed a large sample analysis that linked a specific viral agent to thrombocytosis in this clinical retrospective study. Childhood ST is related to respiratory tract infections, the occurrence rate is approximately 25.9%, and the most common viruses are RSV and HRV, but infections with ADV or IFV seldom cause thrombocytosis. HRV single infection is a risk factor associated with thrombocytosis.
