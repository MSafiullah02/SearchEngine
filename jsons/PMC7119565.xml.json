Investigations of early interactions of virus particles with their receptor sites on the cell surface may provide important insight into host cell tropism and therefore, pathogenicity, and antiviral strategies can be evaluated on the basis of these results. Permanent cell lines are used most often for the investigation of the early steps in the viral life cycle in order to applicate a defined counterpart. However, to answer specific questions, especially with regard to host cell tropism, it will sometimes be necessary to use primary cells in order to mimic the in vivo conditions. Preparation of primary cells, for example lymphocytes, is time-consuming and may often be unsatisfactory due to variable results associated with the quantity and quality of the preparations. Furthermore, rapid cell degeneration can produce misleading results during the course of binding studies.",

Starting with a pool of cells, plasma membranes with a constant quality can be produced and stored for several months. During the binding studies, misleading results due to contamination with intracellular compartments can also be avoided. A simple and rapid method is described now for the preparation of plasma membranes derived from chicken lymphoid cells and chicken primary fibroblasts. The purity of these preparations was confirmed by morphological, biochemical and serological investigations. Their binding activity was tested with infectious bursal disease virus (IBDV) particles and the results were compared to published binding studies with IBDV particles and primary cells (Nieper and M\u00fcller, 1996).",

(1983)with several modifications (see Fig. 1\n). All plastic and cellulose nitrate tubes were soaked in 1 mM EDTA pH 7.0 overnight and rinsed ten times with doubly distilled water before use. The cells, washed three times in the washing buffer described above, were resuspended in a 3-fold (w/v) excess of homogenization buffer (25.0 mM HEPES, 30 mM NaCl, 0.5 mM MgCl2, 1.0 mM dithiothreitol, 1.0 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1.0 \u03bcM pepstatin A; pH 8.0) and kept on ice for 10 min. Thereafter, the cells were disrupted by 30\u201340 strokes in a \u2018tight fitting\u2019 (lymphoid cells) or a \u2018loose fitting\u2019 (CEF) Dounce homogenizer, respectively. Immediately after homogenization restoration buffer was added (25.0 mM HEPES, 0.6 M NaCl, 0.5 mM MgCl2; pH 8.0) in order to achieve a final concentration of NaCl of 154 mM. EDTA was added to a final concentration of 1 mM. After centrifugation (5000\u00d7g, 10 min, 4\u00b0C, SS34 rotor, Sorvall), a 25 ml volume of the resulting supernatant was layered over 12 ml of a 25% sucrose cushion (sucrose was dissolved in isotonic homogenization buffer). After centrifugation (100 000\u00d7g, 1 h, 4\u00b0C, SW28 rotor, Beckman L8-55), plasma membranes forming a white band at the interface were collected, diluted with washing buffer and sedimented by centrifugation (100 000\u00d7g, 30 min, 4\u00b0C, SW41 rotor, Beckman L8-55). They were resuspended in washing buffer and the protein concentration was determined in a microtiter plate assay using BCA protein reagent (Pierce). Aliquots of the membranes were stored frozen at \u221220\u00b0C up to three months.",

Essentially, a phosphate-free buffer system was chosen to be able to characterize the membrane preparations biochemically by marker enzymes most of which release inorganic phosphate. When Tris buffers were used to stabilize the plasma membranes as recommended by Warren (1974), the enzymatic activities were very low in the preparations. Therefore, a HEPES-based buffer (Ferber et al., 1972), pH 8.0 to stabilize the cell membranes (Evans, 1987), was used. An 0.5 mM concentration of MgCl2 was employed in order to stabilize the nuclear membranes during incubation in hypotonic homogenization buffer (Allan and Crumpton, 1970; Ferber et al., 1972) since MgCl2 at higher concentrations led to the aggregation of lymphoid cells. Homogenization with Dounce homogenizers was given preference to the Polytron homogenizers used by Maeda et al. (1983)because their mechanical forces proved to be more gentle for cell disruption. To prevent osmolytic damage of the cell compartments and to conserve the structures and the enzymatic activities in the plasma membranes, isotonic conditions were re-established immediately after homogenization by the addition of restoration buffer. EDTA was added to complex divalent cations as these can lead to aggregations of plasma membranes with the nucleus (Ferber et al., 1972) and also may activate metalloproteases. As a further modification, an additional step of differential centrifugation was undertaken prior to density gradient centrifugation in order to remove cell debris, mitochondria and nuclei from the homogenates. Centrifugation of the membrane preparations in discontinuous sucrose gradients (40, 30, 20 and 10%) showed an increase of plasma membrane-specific enzymes and a decrease of the marker enzyme for the endoplasmic reticulum at lower sucrose concentrations; yields, however, at 10% sucrose concentration was only low. Satisfactory results with regard to purity and yield were obtained by centrifugation of the plasma membranes on a 25% sucrose cushion, in accordance to a protocol described by Perdue (1974).",

The same efficiency of binding was observed with both IBDV serotypes. Plasma membranes derived from CEF bound IBDV particles more efficiently than those derived from lymphoid cells. Binding of the serum proteins was less than 5% of total binding when virus was omitted. Similar results were obtained when a pre-immune serum was used.

Therefore, a protocol was established for chicken cells, based on a method applicable to a wide range of different cell types and tissues, including human fibroblasts and lymphocytes (Maeda et al., 1983).

Using this simple and rapid method a level of purity was achieved which, as indicated by (Na++K+)-ATPase activity, was considerably higher than described for chicken cells before (Perdue and Sneider, 1970). Glucose-6-phosphatase was also enriched, however to a significantly lower extent, indicating traces of endoplasmic reticulum.

Similar results were obtained with two serotypes of Theiler virus and BHK cells and plasma membranes (Fotiadis et al., 1991; Kilpatrick and Lipton, 1991). In the ELISA-like procedure, IBDV particles of both serotypes bound to plasma membranes derived from CEF more efficiently than to those derived from lymphoid cells. These differences were more prominent in in vitro binding studies performed with IBDV particles and avian cells (Nieper and M\u00fcller, 1996). Furthermore, cell and serotype specific differences observed in the in vitro binding studies with isolated lymphoid cells could not be shown with the plasma membrane preparations. In the in vitro studies virus particles of serotype 2 bound to a higher extent than serotype 1 particles. In addition it had been observed that the efficiency of binding of serotype 1 particles to isolated lymphoid cells was in the order bursa of Fabricius, spleen and thymus. These differences can be due to several reasons. (1) The in vitro studies were based on cell numbers. CEF are larger than lymphoid cells; lymphoid cells isolated from bursa of Fabricius and spleen are larger than those isolated from thymus. Cells with a larger surface might express more virus binding sites and higher amounts of protein were present in the test. It might be speculated, therefore, that a larger number of virus particles can be bound. In contrast, the same amount of protein had been used for each cell type in the ELISA study. (2) Immobilization of plasma membranes can lead to alterations of their binding activity (Yic and Lingwood, 1992). (3) The preparation procedure, e.g. the disruption of the native membranes, might result in alterations of virus binding structures. Similar differences have been described with human rhinovirus (Staunton et al., 1989) and murine Moloney leukemia virus (Johnson and Rosner, 1986).",
