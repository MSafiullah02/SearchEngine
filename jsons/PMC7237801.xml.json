Among these treatments, indomethacin (INDO), a potent anti-inflammatory and antipyretic drug acting on COX1/2 enzymes, developed for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis in the 1960s [1, 2] seems to have the potential to become an effective treatment for the patients infected with SARS CoV-2. INDO can be used not only for its antipyretic properties, common to other non-steroidal analgesic drugs, as symptomatic treatment [3, 4], but also to improve oxygenation in patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome [5, 6] and to robustly reduce proinflammatory interleukin-6 levels [7, 8].",

In this recent study, the pseudovirus model that contains the SARS-CoV-2 spike was used (SARS CoV-2 GenBank: MN908947.3). Briefly, African green monkey kidney VERO E6 cells were infected with SARS CoV-2 pseudovirus and treated with different concentrations of INDO (0, 0.1, 1, 5, 10, 50, 100, 500 \u03bcM) or aspirin (0, 0.1, 1, 5, 10, 50, 100, 500 \u03bcM) as control at 48 h post infection. The level of cell infection was determined by luciferase activity in the cell lysates of infected cells at 48 h post-infection (p.i.). INDO was found to possess a remarkable antiviral activity, reducing viral particle production dose-dependently with an IC50 of ~ 1 \u03bcM (i.e. 0.358 mg/L), and selective index of 500, and caused a dramatic reduction relative light unit to zero at 48 h p.i, in VERO E6 cells [16].",

INDO was also found to have significant anticancer activity against a wide variety of cancer cell types, in vitro and in vivo [30, 31]. INDO performs its anticancer activity in different fashions, inhibits proliferation via induction of apoptotic death of tumor cells [29, 31], reduces tumorigenesis by enhancing the immune response [32, 33] and inhibiting the angiogenesis [34] as well. Recently, extensive studies on various cancer cell types including colorectal carcinoma justified the efficacy of INDO to reduce the levels of anti-apoptotic proteins and progressive cell proliferation [35, 36].",

These results suggest that INDO could be considered as a promising candidate for the treatment of SARS-CoV-2 whose potential therapeutic effect needs to be further assessed in a prospective clinical trial.",
