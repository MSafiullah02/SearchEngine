As the disease has spread, cases of COVID-19 have also been found across the whole of China and overseas. Nucleic acid detection of a patient's respiratory secretions identified the source of infection to be a new type of coronavirus, which was been defined as 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) [1]. On 11 February 2020, the WHO officially named the disease caused by the novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) as Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) [2]. On February 22, 2020, China's National Health Commission announced the designation of the new coronavirus pneumonia as Coronavirus disease. The disease is a new type B infectious disease (in accordance with the class A management, Infectious Disease Prevention and Control Law). Although there is considerable overlap between imaging manifestations of different viral pneumonia, comprehensive analysis of clinical features, epidemiology and laboratory examination results are of significance in improving the diagnosis of COVID-19.",

The surface of virus particles is covered in many spines, and the virus particles as a whole resemble a crown, which is the origin of the name \u201ccoronavirus\u201d. Six subtypes have been found; of these, four are less pathogenic and generally lead to mild symptoms after infection; two subtypes can cause severe infections. The novel coronavirus is a new-type coronavirus that has not been previously been found in humans being. It is now considered to be a seventh subtype, but its genes have more than 85% homology with a SARS-like virus in bats. It has been speculated that the pathogenic mechanism of the virus may be that because the 2019-nCoV receptor and SARS-CoV receptor binding region (RBD) structure domain between the amino acid sequence and the prediction of protein structure are highly similar, 2019-nCoV can effectively use angiotensin-converting enzyme 2(ACE2) on alveolar type II epithelial cells as the receptor to invade cells, thus entering the bronchial epithelial cells to replicate and cause disease [3,4].",

The main source of infection is patients infected with the novel coronavirus infection. Patients with asymptomatic infection (incubation period) can also be a source of infection. Infection is mainly spread by respiratory droplets and contact. Exposed mucus membranes and unprotected eyes increase the risk of infection, and the detection of the virus in stool and urine samples from patients also suggests the possibility of fecal-oral transmission. There is a possibility of aerosol transmission under the condition of prolonged exposure to high concentrations of aerosols in a relatively closed environment [[5], [6], [7]].

The main clinical manifestations of the disease are fever, fatigue, and a dry cough, and in severe cases, multiple organ failure [[7], [8], [9]]. Its atypical symptoms may include myalgia and diarrhea. Laboratory tests have shown that the total number of white blood cells in early peripheral blood is normal or has decreased, and the lymphocyte count has progressively decreased; C-reactive protein and serum sedimentation rates were increased in most patients [[7], [8], [9]]. COVID-19 was confirmed by viral nucleic acid detection with strong specificity and poor sensitivity [10]. In order to improve the rate of positive nucleic acid detection, it is recommended to retain sputum and lower respiratory secretions as far as possible and promptly submit them for examination [7]. CT examination serves as the screening and diagnostic basis for COVID-19: chest imaging in the early stage shows multiple plaque shadows and interstitial changes, mostly seen in the peripheral lung and subpleural, and then developed into multiple ground glass shadows and infiltration shadows in both lungs. In severe cases, lung consolidation can occur, presenting as \u201cwhite lung\u201d, with rare pleural effusion and mediastinal lymph node enlargement [6,7].",

It is common in clinical work to find that clinical and imaging findings support the diagnosis of COVID-19 while multiple consecutive nucleic acid tests are negative (Fig. 4\n). It has been reported that up to eight nucleic acid tests have been negative in infected patients before COVID-19 was finally diagnosed. Over-reliance on nucleic acid tests may lead to the misdiagnosis of patients who do in fact have COVID-19. This is not conducive to the control of the epidemic. Preliminary data from a designated virus hospital in Wuhan showed that the CT positive rate of clinically highly suspected cases was \u226590%, while the positive rate of nucleic acid tests was about 40%. This is due to the many factors which affect the nucleic acid test such as the course of infection, viral load, sampling method, detection reagents, and interpretation standards. Reagents in particular greatly affect the detection effect [21]. Therefore, nucleic acid test cannot be a factor in restricting the accurate diagnosis and treatment of diseases. The director of the radiology department of a hospital in Wuhan strongly recommends CT scan as the main diagnostic and screening basis for COVID-19. The \u201cDiagnosis and Treatment Scheme for Coronavirus Disease (Trial Version 5)\u201d [6] specifically formulated clinical diagnosis standards for patients in Hubei Province, and defined suspected cases with pneumonia imaging manifestations as \u201cclinical diagnostic cases\u201d, which reduced the risk of further spread.",

CT tomography, especially high-resolution CT, has no overlapping structural interference and can detect small lesions early. The value of a CT scan for COVID-19 lies in it being: the key technology for detecting the presence of lesions in the lungs; the important basis for the diagnosis and differential diagnosis of COVID-19; detecting important warning signals for patients with negative virus nucleic acid test; an important means to monitor COVID-19 treatment outcome (progression, stability, absorption); an early detection of other complications; the best follow-up method for patients following discharge [23]. As mentioned above, the CT scan occupies an important position in the diagnosis of COVID-19; in clinical work, however, we must perform CT examinations without affecting the premise of diagnosis, and we must not over-examine. Therefore, based on the observation of existing cases and combined with clinical experience, we recommend the following CT examination time window: \u2460 Newly diagnosed patients with typical clinical manifestations and positive nucleic acid tests, with a negative chest CT scan at the initial diagnosis, and a review of chest CT scan within 3\u20135 days; \u2461 Clinical diagnosis cases with atypical clinical manifestations and viral pneumonia characteristics. In addition to repeated nucleic acid tests, a chest CT is recommended for 5\u20137 days; \u2462 Non-critical confirmed cases: a chest CT scan is recommended at 5\u20137 days [24].",
