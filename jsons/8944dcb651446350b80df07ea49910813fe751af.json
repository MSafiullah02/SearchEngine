Because of their own prognostic and therapeuthic implications the following etiologies have to be firstly considered in the initial diagnostic approach: lung infection, either by conventional pathogens or atypical microorganisms, malignancy-related thromboembolic pulmonary disease, local tumor progression, iatrogenic intra-alveolar hemorrhage, radiotherapy-induced adverse effects, Chemotherapy is the cornerstone of therapy in many stages of lung cancer. Many diagnostic options have to be taken into account when a patient suffering from lung cancer presents with nonspecific, respiratory, clinical manifestations. A multidisciplinary diagnostic approach is then warranted. The top priority is to rule out those life-threatening causes, such as lung infection, that could be properly treated if a right diagnosis is early. To reach a definite diagnosis frequently requires that one or more diagnostic, pneumologic techniques are performed. Regarding to drug-induced pulmonary disease, prevention is mandatory. In this review we have tried to highlight the risk and characteristics of cytostatic-induced pulmonary toxicity caused by those agents that have been commonly employed to treat lung cancer for the last decades. When treating lung cancer patients, a high clinical suspicion of chemotherapy-induced lung toxicity should be kept in mind since an early withdrawal of the offending drug is the most efficacious therapy.",

However, it is worthwhile to be aware of other entities that may overlap the clinical presentation of pulmonary infection, as it has been recently emphasized 5 (table  1  ) . Usually, a multidisciplinary approach is warranted to try to elucidate the cause of new clinical pulmonary findings in lung cancer patients that are treated with chemotherapy, especially when a multimodality therapeutic program is going on. An algorithmic approach to evaluation of pulmonary infiltrates and nonspecific respiratory symptoms and signs in lung cancer patients on chemotherapy is schematically shown in figure 1. The increasing use of combined chemotherapy and concurrent or alternanting radiotherapy makes it even more dif-ficult for clinicians a right diagnostic approach in these circumstances. The progressive trend of lung cancer to be diagnosed in people aged > 70 years has raised the subject of an alledged i ncrease of drug toxicity in that population 6 . Probably, the multiple underlying diseases which are often present in many elderly patients may afford a better explanation for this finding that age per se. Sometimes physicians have to confront with the dilemma of slowly resolving pulmonary infiltrates in lung cancer patients receiving antibiotics for a confirmed diagnosis of pneumonia. Clinicians have to kept in mind that a slower than usual radiologic resolution of pneumonia may be found in the elderly, in those cases of severe pneumonia with extensive pulmonary shadowing, and with some etiologies such as Legionella 5, 7 .",

In the usually more severe case a short course of corticosteroid therapy is warranted. However, the outcome is variable depending on the offending agent and the degree of established lung damage. After an improvement of symptoms is observed, tapering of the dosage has to be instituted on an individualized basis. Lung transplantation has exceptionally been considered in very selected cases for patients cured of a malignancy who had developped chemotherapy-induced fibrosis 22, 23 .

Early-onset acute pneumonitis is reversible and responds to discontinuation of the drug or, in more severe cases, to corticosteroid therapy. Clinical features of late-onset pneumonitis are those of progressive pulmonary fibrosis with associated pleural thickening on chest radiograph. These patients do not respond neither to cessation of cyclophosphamide nor to institution of corticosteroid therapy. The incidence of pulmonary injury associated with this cytotoxic agent is not exactly determined but it is thought to be lower than 1%. A syndrome of water retention with marked hypervolemia and hyponatremia may be induced by h i g h dose intravenous cyclophosphamide therapy 2 5 . Secondary pleuropulmonary findings may then rarely be observed, especially in older patients that receive a fluid overload to prevent hemorrhagic cystitis. In an experimental study cyclophosphamide-induced lung toxicity was shown to be potentiated by hyperoxia 2 6 . Radiation therapy and cyclophosphamide seem to be a particularly toxic combination for the lung. Bischloroethylnitrosurea (BCNU) and cyclohexylcloroethylnitrosourea (CCNU) have been infrequently used in a few combination chemotherapy regimens for small-cell lung cancer. Pulmonary toxicity, resulting in alveolitis and fibrosis, has been reported after BCNU and CC-NU therapy, usually in cumulative doses greater than 1,000 mg/m 2 27-29 . Interestingly, preexisting lung disease and abnormal pulmonary function tests, two relatively common findings in lung cancer, have been identified as risk factors for the development of BCNU-induced lung toxicity in a malignant glioma series 2 8 . In that subset of population a 20%-30% incidence of lung toxicity has been reported [27] [28] [29] . Although toxicity is usually dose-related, an acute form of pneumonitis cag occur at either end of the dose schedule 3 0 . However, most cases present with the clinical features of an insidious chronic pulmonary fibrosis. Enhanced oxygen toxicity has been reported after BCNU therapy 31 .",

Al-though a subacute clinical presentation is most common, acute and chronic forms also occur. Pulmonary toxicity may be diagnosed as early as a few days and as late as many years of treatment 4 1 . The incidence of pulmonary toxicity has been a matter of controversy but present studies estimate a rate of 2% to 8%. Difficulties found in comparing the incidence and characteristics of methotrexate-induced lung toxicity among series promoted the scoring system published by Searles et al in 1987 4 2 . In a large study on methotrexate induced lung injury following treatment for rheumatoid arthritis a few risk factors were identified: age greater than 60 years, hypoalbuminemia, diabetes mellitus, and rheumatoid pleuropulmonary involvement 4 3 . The most frequent pulmonary manifestation is hypersensitivity pneumonitis, with peripheral blood eosinophilia that may be observed in up to 40%-50% of patients. Lymphocitic predominance with an increase in CD4+ T cells and CD4/CD8 ratio in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid, and a characteristic pathologic pattern of poorly defined granulomatous infil-tration with interstitial mononuclear infiltrates have also been consistently reported 4 4 . A fulminant presentation of respiratory failure has been well described, even after intrathecal administration in nonpulmonary malignancies. The unusual radiographic finding of hilar adenopathy has been very occasionally reported. Acute chest pain caused by pleuritis without parenchymal involvement may rarely occur 45 . While the drug has been used to control severe corticosteroid-dependent bronchial asthma, methotrexate-induced bronchial hyperreactivity has been paradoxically reported. A reversible pulmonary non-Hodgkin's B-cell Iymphoma may appear in patients under methotrexate therapy. Characteristically, it may regress after cessation of the drug. An interesting association with Epstein-Barr virus infection has been reported 46 . Acute encephalopathy that may present with confusion and even coma has been reported with high-dose therapy. Respiratory implications in severe COPD, in a manner similar to ifosfamide, must be remembered by clinicians. Piritrexim, a methrotrexate analog that has been ocasionally used in upper respiratory tract tumors, which are commonly associated with lung cancer, may also cause pulmonary toxicity 4 7 .",

Although high dose steroid pretreatment has allowed succesful rechallenge with gemcitabine after initial severe pulmonary toxicity in a few instances, this approach does not seem to be prudent since a potential risk of repeated toxicity with reexposure can not be definitely avoided. Although many pulmonary toxicities caused by gemcitabine are mild, oncologists must be aware of possible life-threatening cases in order to administer corticosteroid therapy in a timely fashion 59 .",

Mitomycin lung toxicity can not be prevented with corticosteroid pre-medication. An acute or subacute pneumonitis, sometimes with bronchospasm and acute respiratory failure, and also a more chronic, progressive form, have both been described. Chronic pneumonitis seems to be related to the total dose of the drug administered and it is very uncommon when the cumulative dose is less than 30 mg/m 2 . Most cases of mitomycin-induced lung damage occur when a vinca alkaloid is administered concomitantly 8 . In that population lifethreatening reactions, such as severe noncardiogenic edema and adult respiratory distress syndrome with diffuse alveolar damage, have been reported 63, 64, 66 . When mitomycin is administered as part of a combination neoadjuvant chemotherapy, lung toxicity may be enhanced by high concentrations of oxygen during surgery 69, 70 . It has been suggested that the administered oxygen concentration should not exceed a FiO 2 of 0.5. Pleural involvement is an uncommon radiographic finding. Type I and type II cells atypia is also possible, a cytological finding similar to those that may be observed after busulfan or cyclophosphamide therapy. Once pulmonary toxicity has been diagnosed withdrawal of the drug and the institution of corticosteroid therapy may not avoid a progressive respiratory failure in up to 40% of cases. Pulmonary toxicity has also been reported with the new mitomycin analogs, such as KW-2149 7 1 . The most severe form of pulmonary reaction from mitomycin is a thrombotic microangiopathy with renal failure, hemolytic anemia, and noncardiogenic pulmonary edema 72 . This entity overlaps the \u00abhemolytic uremic syndrome\u00bb and causes an adult respiratory distress syndrome in approximately 50% of cases. Blood transfusions and 5-fluoruracil have been allegedly incriminated in the appearance of this distinctive syndrome 8 . The syndrome is unusual, especially if a low cumulative dose is administered, but the prognosis is poor since the overall case-fatality rate is about 70% 8 .",

The risk of congestive heart failure seems to remain low until a total dose of 450 to 550 mg/m 2 has been reached. However, severe congestive myocardiopathy is possible even after a single dose and it has been suggested that the risk of congestive heart failure begins to increase at total doses of doxorubicin above 350 mg/m 2 or 700 mg/m 2 of daunorubicin 73 . Doxorubicin may rarely produce pleural disease. Table 12 shows a summary of pulmonary toxicity caused by antimicrotubule agents, including vinca alkaloids and taxanes.

With doses less than 350 mg/m 2 lung toxicity seems to be extremely rare. Transient pulmonary infiltrates have been occasionally reported. More serious pulmonary toxicities have been observed with high dose paclitaxel therapy, particularly when combined with other cytostatics in the setting of patients that undergo bone marrow transplantation. The use of concurrent lung irradiation and paclitaxel therapy deserves a few comments [87] [88] [89] [90] [91] [92] [93] . Compared to other radiosensitizer cytostatics, a higher than usual enhancement of radiation-induced lung damage has been reported. At least in one study, this combination modality therapy was associated, to some extent, with an increased risk of postoperative complications in stage lll lung cancer patients 9 4 .

Although the incidence is in general low, oncologists must we aware of this entity since if it remains unrecognized the likelihood of a fatal outcome is clearly increased. Several lines of evidence support the notion that an early diagnosis of any drug-induced pulmonary toxicity is mandatory to improve survival. The clinical relevance of such an early diagnosis is supported by the need of an immediate withdrawal of the offending drug and the early institution of corticosteroid therapy in severe cases. The challenging setting of lung cancer patients that present with respiratory symptoms and clinical findings of unkown etiology should be approached from a multidisciplinary point of view.",
