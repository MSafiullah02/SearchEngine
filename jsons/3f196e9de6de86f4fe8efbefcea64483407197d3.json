The excessive entry prediction has been derived primarily for closed economies and using a welfarist benchmark. We extend this framework and allow for (1) horizontal FDI in a multi-period setting and (2) interest group-based government behaviour. Opening the market to greenfield investments from abroad tends to aggravate the entry distortion. Moreover, market opening may reduce welfare if a more pronounced entry distortion dominates the gain in consumer surplus. Finally, a government, which places sufficiently little weight on the interests of consumers, will object to market opening, even if welfare rises.",

Head and Spencer (2017) , for example, commence their call for greater attention to oligopolies in the analysis of trade by asserting that \"Oligopoly is pervasive in our daily live.\" (p. 1415). This statement can be accentuated by findings that concentration of industries has increased considerably in the United States in recent decades (Autor et al. 2017 , Grullon et al. 2019 , and hardly declined in European Union (Guti\u00e9rrez and Philippon 2019) . Accordingly, markets are far from being competitive and many industries feature oligopolistic characteristics. If big firms can cope with the consequences of the crisis commencing in 2020 more successfully than smaller firms, which may also receive less government aid, oligopolistic markets will become even more prevalent within the next years.",

We focus on a long-run, free entry setting which allows for adjustments also at the extensive margin to accommodate the fact that oligopolistic markets are not static but change their composition. In order to ease comparability with earlier investigations, we assume a homogeneous Cournot-oligopoly with identical firms, linear demand and cost schedules and fixed costs of market entry. In such a setting, the number of entrants will be excessive in a closed economy if entry reduces output per firm, that is, if there is businessstealing (von Weizs\u00e4cker 1980 , Mankiw and Whinston 1986 , Suzumura and Kiyono 1987 , Amir et al. 2014 . We extend the analysis to a multi-country, two-period framework. In period one, there are only domestic competitors. At the beginning of period two, the market may be opened up to horizontal FDI. Entry costs arise in each period, whereas additional set-up costs 3 only occur in the first period of activity and for one market. Therefore, incumbents that undertake FDI do not have to incur set-up costs again. This captures the idea that horizontal (greenfield) FDI activities can utilise knowledge gained in earlier domestic production, such that firms spread fixed costs over more markets and, thereby, greater quantities.",

As FDI affects contemporaneous payoffs, market opening alters entry choices in the second period and, if anticipated, also first period decisions. In the second setting, the government regulates entry, for example, by granting costless entry licences. Because such regulation is no longer effective if market opening occurs in period two, it also changes the government's first period choice. In contrast to earlier analyses, we assume that the government maximises a political support function, and not necessarily welfare. This modification enables us to investigate how the nature of the government's objective affects choices. For both settings, the unregulated market equilibrium and the one in which entry is restricted, we initially consider a closed economy. This provides a benchmark, to which we compare outcomes, which will result if there is horizontal FDI.",

These adjustments result in an increase in total output and, hence, welfare. The expansion comes about because production costs per firm decline and the cost effect of the drop in the number of firms in period one dominates the impact of additional entry in period two. If the government regulates entry, the change in the number of firms will exhibit qualitatively the same features as in market equilibrium. Therefore, entry tends to be excessive also in the presence of FDI. We further show that market opening may actually decrease welfare if entry is regulated. Such outcome can occur if the number of firms is relatively high prior to market opening. Therefore, the increase in output and consumer surplus due to market opening is limited and does not compensate the reduction in profits. Finally, we demonstrate that even if market opening raises welfare, the government's payoff may decline.",

Second, we demonstrate how an intertemporal optimisation process of firms can affect outcomes. Third, we illustrate new channels by which international integration can alter welfare. Fourth, we evaluate in how far the government's incentives to regulate entry depend on whose interests it pursues.",

            "text": "Analyses of the excess entry result have occasionally been expanded to open economy settings. Mukherjee (2013, 2015) and Mukherjee (2013) assume that there is one foreign firm which enters the domestic oligopoly. They show that if trade costs decline, so do the foreign firm's costs, such that it produces a greater amount. This, in turn, reduces profits of domestic firms and deters their entry. Moreover, the number of firms in market equilibrium may be insufficient. The rationale for this outcome is that a government, which maximises domestic welfare, takes into account that additional entry raises domestic consumer surplus at the expense of foreign profits. However, this cross-country effect plays no role for the firms' entry decision in market equilibrium. 1 If input prices are given by wages determined by a trade union, lower transport cost may reduce welfare and entry is once again insufficient Mukherjee 2013, 2015) . The latter effect arises because wages deter entry, but do not have a direct welfare effect (see de Pinto and Goerke (2020) for a similar approach). Miyagiwa and Sato (2014) consider a two-country setting in which firms produce locally and can also export, facing linear trade costs. Domestic and foreign governments regulate entry by taxing operating profits of local firms. Miyagiwa and Sato (2014) show that entry is excessive, since domestic taxation fosters entry abroad. Moreover, if entry costs are high, there are few competitors. Allowing for trade intensifies competition substantially. This trade effect exceeds the negative consequences of excessive entry. Hence, trade raises welfare. If market entry costs are low, the gains from trade are also relatively moderate, such that the excessive entry distortion dominates and welfare declines. 2",

Trade raises welfare in comparison to autarky despite the occurrence of trade costs because fixed costs of entry can be distributed across a greater quantity (see, for example, Krugman 1983, Venables 1985) . Under additional conditions, which hold for a linear demand schedule, the total number of suppliers rises, but not necessarily of domestic firms (Venables 1985 , see also Anderson et al. 1989) . Tanaka (1993) considers a two-country free-trade setting. The introduction of a tariff raises welfare if demand is strictly concave. This effect occurs because the number of firms decreases, as Ikeda (2007) clarifies. In partial contrast, Amir et al. (2019) show that free trade can raise welfare and reduces the number of firms in a world without trade costs, such that international competition results in fully integrated markets. Finally, St\u00e4hler (2006) assumes a two-period setting in which domestic and foreign firms can enter their home market in period one and export part of their production. In period two, only incumbents can undertake horizontal FDI. He shows that exports and FDI may co-exist. In this case, the number of firms shrinks with FDI, while welfare rises, for example, if demand is linear.",

The former is profitable, but does not figure in the definition of welfare. Furthermore, Doganoglu and Wright (2006) consider compatibility issues in a framework with unit demand, such that price increases benefit firms but do not affect consumption quantities. To capture the possibility that higher prices lower welfare in such setting, the weight of firms in the government objective is weakly smaller than that of consumers.",

Given our more general government objective, we could redefine excessive entry as a situation in which the number of competitors in the absence of intervention is greater than the number preferred by the government. In this case, the benchmark for evaluating the market equilibrium would depend on the nature of the political process and the mechanism by which preferences are aggregated or affect the government's actions. In the present setting, no decision with respect to the appropriate standard has to be taken. This is because the benchmark for establishing excessive entry plays no role for appraising the market outcome. Proposition A clarifies that there will never be fewer competitors in market equilibrium than desired by the government, irrespective of the combination of profits and consumer surplus in its objective. Therefore, the number of entrants in market equilibrium is never less and usually (for \u03b2 > 0.5) greater than the government's preferred extent of competition, also in a setting in which the standard for evaluating the market outcome is not the sum of consumer surplus and profits. 10 This assessment, however, will no longer hold if the weight of consumers in the government's objective were sufficiently high and entry were not restricted by the zero-profit constraint. This would be the case because the government would prefer more than n* competitors if it could subsidise entry and maximise (7) without having to observe the profit restriction. 11",

For simplicity, we assume that this applies to domestic firms also. This is without impact on results if the number of countries, m, is high enough. Hence, market opening effectively abolishes the government's ability to regulate entry. 10 Etro and Colciago (2010) analyse a DSGE-model and compare the market outcome with a situation in which steady-state consumption is maximised. Though their model differs substantially from the much simpler one outlined above, they also find entry to be excessive. 11 I am grateful to an anonymous referee for bringing this issue to my attention.",

All these types of market opening can be viewed as less comprehensive than the variant we analyse below. While some of them will yield the same outcomes, for example, if entry is restricted to incumbents and all firms enter in period one anyhow, others may result in less pronounced adjustments in entry, output and payoffs. 12 Therefore, our variant of market opening indicates its maximal consequences.",

If the weight of firms in the government's objective is higher than \u03b2 QR , = 0.5, it will prefer fewer firms in period one, such that excessive entry results. Moreover, the government in a closed economy prefers at most n * firms in period two (cf. Proposition A). Because n * T > n * , there will surely be excessive entry. As in a closed economy, the number of entrants in equilibrium is never less and usually (for \u03b2 > 0.5) greater than the government's preferred extent of competition, irrespective of the standard used to evaluate the market outcome.

Our main contribution is to extend the analysis to an open economy setting in which firms can undertake greenfield investments abroad. Such market opening allows firms to spread fixed cost over more markets and, thus, to lower unit production costs. This beneficial impact of horizontal FDI is mitigated or dominated by the increase in the number of firms. Such increase entails a welfare loss due to the business stealing externality. In particular, we compare the unregulated market equilibrium with a situation in which governments can restrict entry at least in the first period. Going beyond previous contributions in a further dimension, we compare the market equilibrium not only to the (second-best) welfare-maximum, but also to the outcome which arises if the government maximises a political support function.",

In a closed economy, the number of firms in market equilibrium is too high. Therefore, welfare is less than maximal because of the excessive entry distortion and the firms' market power. If the market is opened up, the number of firms in market equilibrium in period one declines, while the increase in period two is relatively moderate because there had already been excessive entry. Therefore, total fixed costs born by domestic firms decline. Moreover, consumer surplus rises. The latter effect ensures 21 that market opening raises welfare in market equilibrium.

Moreover, the countervailing effects in a situation in which the government determines entry also explain why welfare may decrease.

This is the case because an equivalent variation of profits and consumer surplus in the opposite direction will leave welfare constant, whereas this will generally not be the case for the government's payoff. Because market opening tends to reduce profits if entry is regulated, a government is more likely to oppose it the greater the firms' weight in the government's objective is.

In future work, it may be worthwhile to explore in how far they affect the theoretical predictions. As one example, the weight of the consumers' and firms' payoffs in the government's objective is exogenous and constant. However, it could be argued that the respective parameters are endogenous and depend on the payoffs obtained. This would imply that market opening affects the relative importance given to consumer surplus and profits when determining competition policy (see Hillman and Ursprung (1993) for an according approach idea in the context of trade policy). Since market opening tends to reduce aggregate profits, the consumers' interests may then become more important for entry regulations. As a second example, we have not allowed for exporting activities. However, if the good under consideration could be transported across borders easily, this restriction can no longer be justified. The findings of Miyagiwa and Sato (2014) suggest that there will also be excessive entry if firms can export their products, but not undertake FDI. The combination of both activities, exporting and investing abroad may have different consequences if interaction 22 effects occur (see Helpman et al. 2004 and St\u00e4hler 2011 To prove that the outcome described in Sub-section 3.1 is a unique equilibrium, we show, first, that n = n = n * is a stable outcome and, second, that it is the only one in pure strategies.",

Exit at the beginning of period two yields a payoff of zero, whereas producing the profit-maximising quantity generates profits of \u03c0 (n * ) = 0.5(k + k \u2212 k ) > 0. Hence, no firm will exit in period two. Entry in period two of a firm which had not produced in period one will at most generate losses of \u03c0 (n * ) \u2212 k = 0.5(k \u2212 k \u2212 k) < 0, as k > |k \u2212 k |, and because profits decline in the number of firms. Turning to period one, an additional entrant would incur higher contemporaneous losses and lower profits in period two than an incumbent, since profits decline in the number of firms. Thus, there is no additional entry. Not entering at all would yield zero profits, that is, no improvement relative to the equilibrium described. Not entering in period one, but then entering in period two would generate a payoff of \u03c0 (n * ) \u2212 k < 0. Hence, waiting to enter does not pay. In consequence, the outcome constitutes a stable equilibrium. In addition, profits decrease in the number of firms if firms choose output optimally (cf. equations (3a) and (3b)).

Suppose an interior solution next. Since \u03ba, as defined in (8), is linearly increasing in n and n , the expression in square brackets in (A.1) and in (A.2) is positive and the first terms are decreasing in the number of firms. If n > n , the first term in (A.1) is thus smaller than the first term in (A.2), while the second term, which is deducted, is larger in absolute value in (A.1) than in (A.2). Hence, if n is chosen such as to warrant (A.2), (A.1) is negative for any n > n . Therefore, any choice of the number of firms which (1) implies interior solutions to the maximisation problem and (2) that more firms are allowed to enter in period one than in 24 period two, or vice versa, cannot be optimal. Finally, it may be the case that the term in square brackets is positive in (A.1) and negative in (A.2), or vice versa. In the former case, the optimal number of firms in period two would be minimal, i.e. one. If the optimal number of firms in period one is unity, the two-period monopoly case discussed above would result.

This, however, is in contradiction to the assumption that the term in square brackets in (A.1) is positive and negative in (A.2). Hence, a choice of the number of firms such that n > n = 1 cannot be optimal for a government, irrespective of its exact objective. A comparable argument establishes that 1 = n < n cannot maximise the government's payoff either. Note, finally, that the sign of (A.2) is independent of n .

Proof: See Appendix A.6. The number of firms in an open market in period two exceeds the maximum number of firms allowed to enter by the government in a closed economy for two reasons: First, the government in the closed economy takes the business-stealing externality into account, whereas this is no longer feasible in an open market. Second, the entry decision in an open economy is governed by entry costs in period two, whereas the government in the closed economy bases its decision on the average of set-up and periodic entry costs over two periods. 16 Harms and Ursprung (2002) find a positive impact of trade unions and a negative of political repression on FDI in a sample of up to 62 countries. If a lower value of \u03b2 indicates a greater relevance of trade unions, their findings are commensurate with our prediction. However, since the empirical analysis by Harms and Ursprung",
