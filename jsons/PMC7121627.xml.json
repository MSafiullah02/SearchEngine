Recent surveys and experiences show that Schi\u00f8tz and other researchers had correct facts and guidelines according to airborne infections. Secrets from the respiratory tract can go far off 9 m or more, for example, when coughing and sneezing, and pathogenic viruses and bacteria are detected in the air in rooms with infected patients [2, 14, 17, 18, 20, 21, 26, 32\u201343]. Airborne MRSA and other multiresistant bacteria may be a greater problem than previously thought [17, 18, 20, 42]. Even Clostridium difficile spores may become airborne under certain conditions [43]. Today, it is also known that most microbes are strong, surviving organisms outside the body [1, 44]. They can also survive on the outside of the protective equipment and even re-aerosol from these and even penetrate a wet mask [1, 4, 44\u201348]. Respirators (half masks) are more expensive (about 4 USD) than surgical mask (<0.1 USD). Because of a shortage during large outbreaks, it has been attempted to decontaminate respirators for reuse. However, this is not effective, is not recommended and cannot be done with disposable equipment [49].",

If there is a risk of transmission of severe respiratory infection, tight-fitting goggles are used. The goggles can be reused after 1 h of treatment in 5% chloramine, followed by washing with soap and water, and they may also be reprocessed and decontaminated in a washing machine at >85 \u00b0C.",

Particle studies; ventilation variations; kinetics; the effect of humidity, temperature and filter types; re-aerosols from dust; environment and PPE equipment; and the survival of microbes in the environment should be better studied. This is the case for most important microbial agents: bacteria, viruses and fungi. Respirators should be preferred over surgical masks when there is suspected droplet or airborne transmission. This choice is essentially a misunderstood price and attitude problem.",
