The primers were from the conserved region of the RV and enterovirus genomes (a biotinylated positive-sense primer with map-position 454-473; a negative-sense primer with map-position 548-568). The PCR products were detected by agarose gel electrophoresis and ethidium bromide staining. The results were confirmed in a liquid-phase hybridization assay through use of the oligonucleotide probes, a maximum difference between RVs (a samarium-labeled probe with map-position 528-544) and enteroviruses (an europium-labeled probe with map position 534-549) being used to differentiate the RV and enterovirus amplicons. The probes could be detected simultaneously by time-resolved fluorometry.17, 18 The sensitivity and specificity of the RT-PCR and hybridization methods have been validated against prototype (American Type Culture Collection) RVs and enteroviruses. In a study by L\u00f6nnrot et al,10 the 30 most common enterovirus serotypes (obtained from American Type Culture Collection) among 64 known human serotypes were tested; each gave a positive signal by RT-PCR. Nine known RV serotypes (obtained from American Type Culture Collection), among 101 known serotypes, and 20 clinical isolates of unknown serotypes were tested, and the RT-PCR assay amplified all tested RVs. All but 1 amplicon gave a positive signal in the subsequent hybridization assay.",

However, when the later occurrence of asthma among RSV-positive children (15%) is compared with the prevalence of asthma (4%) among nonselected school-aged children of our area,16 the risk for asthma is increased among RSV-positive children as well. However, the RSV-associated risk for later asthma was not as high as that in a controlled study by Sigurs et al,20 in which the risk was increased up to 12-fold.",

RVs are considered the most common causative agents in upper respiratory infections at all ages.22 There is evidence that RVs might also cause lower respiratory infections in young children.1 The figure in the present study (33%) is close to that published by Juv\u00e9n et al2 for pneumonia in children.

RT-PCR, used in the present study, has been shown to be more sensitive than conventional virus isolation for RVs and enteroviruses.9, 10 Liquid-phase hybridization assay, done after RT-PCR, further increases the sensitivity and specificity.10 In comparison with virus isolation from clinical respiratory samples, the sensitivity of PCR has been excellent (98%).9 Inasmuch as RVs were rarely involved in mixed viral infections, it was possible to study their specific effect on outcomes in the children.",

Viral PCR was studied approximately 6 years after the acute episode, and therefore good-quality frozen NPA specimens obtained on entry into the study were available for only 80% of the children. Thus the risk analyses for the later outcome at early school age had to be restricted to those 66 cases with both NPA specimens and adequate follow-up data available. In addition, we did not have a control group with no history of early childhood wheezing. Nevertheless, there was a recent Finnish study on RV, enterovirus, and coronavirus findings by RT-PCR in asymptomatic children24 that showed the viral detection rate by RT-PCR to be low (5%) when no preceding, concurrent, or following respiratory symptoms were reported. In the present study, the viral detection rate by RT-PCR in wheezing children was greater than 8-fold (44% in all). In case of RVs, the detection rate in wheezing children was approximately 3-fold. Consequently, we consider RVs to be important infective agents that are able to induce wheezing in susceptible children. In addition, the prevalence of school-age asthma has been carefully studied in our area in recent years, the criteria for asthma being with minor modifications similar to the criteria used in the present study; the prevalence in those studies has been stable (4% to 4.5%).16, 32 Thus, RV-induced wheezing in infancy was associated with multiplied occurrence of asthma (up to 70%) in later childhood.",

            "text": "In conclusion, the development of PCR methods for RVs, enteroviruses, and coronaviruses has allowed us to reevaluate the role of these viruses in wheezing children. Our results present RVs as important inducers of wheezing even in children under the age of 2 years. RV-induced wheezing leading to hospitalization seems to predict the development of asthma. The association with atopy suggests that there is active asthmalike bronchial inflammation in children wheezing during RV infection. Thus, our results call for reevaluation of the role of RV in the development of asthma.",
