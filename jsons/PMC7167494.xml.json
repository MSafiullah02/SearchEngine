This finding might be due to the immunologic dysfunction of circulating T cells in RA patients, rendering patients\u2019 immune system unable to respond to the infectious agent. The impaired thymic function and increased turnover of peripheral T cells, which causes dysregulation in peripheral T cell homeostasis, could also contribute to the higher susceptibility of RA to infections [8]. Moreover, RA patients are frequently treated with immunosuppressive medications, such as steroid or DMARDs. The administration of such immunosuppressive agents and subsequent inhibition of T cell activation and granulocyte function could also contribute to the higher frequency of infections observed in RA patients [9].",

For patients admitted to hospitals with severe infections, temporary discontinuation of most DMARDs is recommended to allow RA patients to develop protective immunity and eliminate the pathogens [10]. On the other hand, pausing the administration of DMARDs might provoke an inflammatory exacerbation of RA, which usually is managed by increased doses of immunosuppressive medications. The effect of steroid use in COVID-19 is still unknown. Steroid might worsen the infections by reducing the immune system, but the inflammatory cascade of pneumonia could be blocked by the administration of systemic steroid treatment [11]. Previous reports demonstrated that the steroid treatment was related with higher mortality of patients with a viral infection such as influenza pneumonia [12] and that steroid use was associated with delayed coronavirus RNA clearance of both Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) [13] and Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) [14]. In the presented cases, while we discontinued leflunomide and steroids to minimize the severity of COVID-19, we continued the administration of hydroxychloroquine due to its possible antiviral effects [15], as well as its antirheumatic effects.",

Abatacept, rituximab, and tocilizumab have been associated with pneumonia and pyogenic bacterial infections, while tofacitinib with herpes zoster infection [9]. Meanwhile, selective cytokine blockade (anakinra or tocilizumab) and Janus kinase (JAK) inhibition might be beneficial in improving mortality in severe COVID-19 cases with cytokine storm syndrome [19]. However, to date, the effects of bDMARDs or tsDMARDs on COVID-19 remain uncertain. Therefore, while more evidence regarding the risk of COVID-19 infection in RA patients, we suggest the discontinuation of bDMARDs and tsDMARDs in COVID-19 cases, as has been recommended for previous viral outbreaks [20].",
