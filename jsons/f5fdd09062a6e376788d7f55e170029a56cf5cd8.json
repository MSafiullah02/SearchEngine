            "text": "The structure of mouse H-2K revealed its similarity to three human class I HLA molecules, consistent with the high primary sequence homology and ;ommon function of these peptide-presenting molecules. Electron density was 'ocated in the peptide binding groove, to which a single peptide in a unique :onformation was unambiguously fit. The peptide extended the length of the qroove, parallel to the =-helices, and assumed an extended, mostly 0-strand :onformation. The peptide was constrained within the groove by hydrogen bonding of its main-chain atoms and by contacts of its side-chains with the H-2 K b molecule. Its amino terminal nitrogen atom formed a hydrogen bond with the hydroxyl group of Tyrl7l at one end of the groove, while the carboxyl terminal oxygen formed a hydrogen bond with the hydroxyl group of Tyr84 at the other end, amino acids which are conserved among human and mouse MHC molecules. This anchoring of each end of the peptide appears to be a general feature of peptide-MHC class 1 molecule binding and imposes restrictions on its length. The side-chains of residues Tyr3, Tyr5, and Leu8 of the peptide fit into the interior of the K 'molecule with no appreciable surface exposure, a finding in support of previous biological studies that showed the importance of these residues for binding. Thus the basis for binding of specific peptide sequences to the MHC class I molecule is the steric restriction imposed on the peptide side-chains by the architecture of the floor and sides of the groove. The sidechains of Argl, Val4 and Gln6 as well as the main-chain of Gly7 of the peptide are exposed on the surface of the complex, thus confirming their availability for T cell receptor contact, as previously suggested by experiments which demonstrated that a specific subset of these residues were interactive with specific TCRs. The overall picture that arises from our studies is that the TCR/MHC interaction is unique since only 3 to 4 residues of the peptide have sufficient solvent accessibility for TCR interaction, with the majority of the peptide residues being buried. T cell recognition thus depends on only a few of the residues of a peptide presented in the context of the much larger pattern of amino acid side chains of the 2ohelices of the antigen presenting domain of the MHC.",

Pulse-chase experiments showed that MHC class I molecules were not transported by SCLC from the ER to the cell surface, suggesting that peptides were not available for binding to nascent MHC and /3,-microglobulin molecules. Consistent with this interpretation, northern blot analysis revealed low to non-detectable levels of mRNAs for MHC encoded proteasome components LMP-7 and LMP-2, as well as the putative peptide transporters TAP-1 and TAP-2. Treatment of cells with IFN-y enhanced expression of these mRNAs. and completely reversed the observed functional and biochemical deficits. In order to bypass the need for the processing of intracellular antigens, we constructed a vaccinia virus capable of endogenously synthesizing a 9 amino acid long 'minimal determinant' from the nucleoprotein gene of influenza A/PR/8/34 preceded by an ER insertion signal sequence, (Anderson et a/, J Exp Med 174:489, 1991) thus eliminating the need for both protease activity and transporter activity.

Although Mls-1 has been functionally defined for over two decades, the biochemical nature of this molecule has remained elusive until recently. Mls-1 induces a strong in vitro proliferative response of T cells expressing the Vp6 or 8.1 chains. In vivo, MIS-1 causes the deletion of immature T cells bearing these particular T cell receptors, as well as the Vp7 or 9 chains. We have cloned and sequenced the Mtv-7 sag gene. Comparison of the deduced amino acid sequence with that of other MMTV sag genes suggests that the polymorphic 3' end encodes the T cell receptor terminus was, therefore, used to generate an Mls-1 specific antipeptide mAb. This mAb reacts with a recombinant baculovirus product of Mtv-7 sag and blocks proliferation of T ceils in response to Mls-1 specific Stimulation. In addition, it recognizes the Mls-1 protein on the surface of LBB.A and Mtv-7 sag transfected cell lines. We have demonstrated that Mls-1 is efficiently presented by the human HLA-DR1 molecule to murtne T cells.

The accumulation of neither of these transcripts is enhanced by CD28 costimulation. Although the functional significance of these findings is presently unclear it is possible that these cytokines may be involved in the unresponsive state either by preventing T cell responsiveness to IL-2 or by modifying the costimulatory properties of APC. To investigate the role of immunologic tolerance mechanisms in chronic infection of the newborn, we have generated HBeAg-expressing transgenic mice (BIO.S/e31). These mice were tolerant to both HBeAg and the nonsecreted HBcAg at the T-cell level. Furthermore, nontransgenic littermates born to HBeAg-expressing mothers showed reduced T-cell responses to HBc/HBe antigens, suggesting that tolerogenic HBeAg may transverse the placenta. Tg mice did not produce antibody to HBeAg but did produce IgM antibodies to HBcAg via a T cellindependent pathway. The coexistence of tolerance to HBc/HBe T cell determinants and production of antibody to HBcAg in vivo parallel the immunologic status of neonates born to carrier mothers. The maintenance of T cell tolerance to HBc/HBe antigens required the continued presence of the tolerogen and in the absence of HBeAg persisted for less than 16 weeks. The reversibility of T cell tolerance to HBc/HBe antigens may explain the inverse correlation between age of infection and rates of viral persistence. These observations suggest that a function of the HBeAg may be to induce immunologic tolerance in ulcro. Expression of HBeAg may represent a viral strategy to guarantee persistence subsequent to perinatal infection. Further studies in F I hybrid Tg mice (BIO x BIO.S/e31) illustrated that \"self tolerance to HBeAg is variable depending on the MHC genotype. A dominant T cell site on HBeAg (~120-131 and I-AS-restricted) is tolerogenic, w ereas a proportion of T cells recognizing p129-140 in the context of I-A evade induction of tolerance, persist in the periphery, and can be activated in vivo by a single injection of the 12 residue T cell selfpeptide. Furthermore, the self-reactive T cells can cooperate with self-' b ~~ reactive, HBeAg-specific B cells to mediate in vivo production of autoantibody sufficient to neutralize detection of the autoantigen in serum. This model illustrates that T cells specific for an immunnogenic T-cell site on a nonsequestered autoantigen can escape induction of tolerance (i.e., are not deleted or anergic) and, more importantly, can mediate autoreactivity in vivu. These murine studies suggest that chronic HBV (CH-B) carriers may also possess \"quiescent\" T cells that have evaded tolerance induction. In order to examine the relevance of this murine model, 200 HBeAg-positive CH-B carriers with varying degrees of liver disease (ie. CAH, CPH, ASC) were analyzed with novel and sensitive serological assays capable of detecting serum anti-HBe and anti-HBs antibodies regardless of the simultaneous presence of their respective antigens.

The immune system can respond to infectious agents by a variety of effector mechanisms, each of which is appropriate for different types of pathogen. The decision between these responses is under saingent regulation, and part of this control is mediated by the cross-regulation of T cell subsets secreting different cytokine patterns. Two major T helper subsets are THl and TH2 cells, which differ markedly in the patterns of cytokines that they secrete after antigen stimulation. These patterns are mainly responsible for the different functions of the two subtypes. THI cells induce an inflammatory response, including activation of granulocytes and macrophages. In contrast, TH2 cells are excellent helpers for B cell antibody production, and in the absence of a significant Interferon y response, TH2 cells induce a strong allergic response due to secretion of IL4, ILS and ILlO. Other T cell subtypes also exist, but the functions of these cells, and the interrelationships between them, are less well understood.",

            "text": "The repertoire of the cytotoxic lymphocyte response to infection was studied in mice infected with lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus (LCMV). At early stages of infection, LCMV stimulated activated NK cells and non-MHC-restricted cytotoxic T cells (CTL), whereas at later stages both virus-specific and allospecific CTZ were induced. Antiviral activity of the NK cells and of non-MHC-restricted CTL was shown in vivo against murine cytomegalovirus but not against LCMV, whose replication in vivo was controlled by virus-specific CTL. Concomitant with the induction of the virus-specific CTL was a 1040-fold increase in the number of CD8' T cells per spleen and a deficiency in the ability of the T cells to proliferate in response to mitogens. The T cell number subsquently declined, and responsiveness to mitogens returned. Limiting dilution analyses of CTL generated in vivo revealed a high frequency of virus-specific CTL cross-reactive with alloantigens. Activated Cn and subsequent memory CTL expressed CDllb and IL-2 receptors. The activated CTL isolated from mice during acute infection were triggered to undergo apoptosis upon TcR/CD3 cross-linking. Culture of activated (CTL) response to HBV encoded antgens is thought to be responsible for liver cell injury and viral clearance during HBV infection. Using a strategy involving an initial stimulation of peripheral blood mnonuclear cells (PBMC) with HBVderied synthetic peptdes, followed by restimulation with HLA class I matched stable HBV transfectants. we have recently demonstrated. at the clonal level, that most patients with acute viral hepatitis develop a polyclonal HLA class I restricted CTL response to multiple HBV encoded antigens. In contrast. the response is not detectable in patients with chronic HBV infection. Our resuns may be summarized as follows. First, we have identilied a nucleocapsid epitope (STLPETWVRR) that is dually restricted by the HLA-A31 and A H alleles. We have shown that both of these class I alleles recognize precisely the same sequence and that they both bind to the same agretopic residues, while the T cell receptors of independently derived CTL clones recognize different epitopic residues. Second. we have identified ten HLA-A2 restricted CTL epitopes within the viral envelope. nucleocapsid. polymerase and X proteins. and we have shown that these epitopes contain the HLA-A2.1 allele specific binding mtif described by Rammensee's group. Third, we showed that the HBV specific CTL response in individual patients with acute viral hepatitis extends to multiple viral epitopes and different restriction elements; i.e., it is polyclonal. multispecifii and polytmrphically restricted. thereby minimizing the chances that CTL \"escape mutants\" will emerge in this setting. Fourth, we showed that there is a hierarchy of responsiveness to the HLA-A2 restricted epitopes in infected patients; ie two Of the epitopes (core FLPSDFFPSV and envelope WLSLLVPFV) are recognized by the majonty of infected patients while the remainder are seen by a minority of the patients we have studied thus far. This hierarchy does not correspond to the HLA-A2.1 binding affinity of the peptides, and therefore is probably determined at the level of v i m sequence, antigen processing or the T cell repertoire. Finh. we demonstrated that CTL nonresponse to a particular peptide sequence in an otherwise responsive patient may reflect infection by a virus that expresses a variant sequence in the region of the epitope. For example, several patients who failed to respond to the immunogenic envelope peptide GLSPTVWLSV were shown to be infected by a variant in which the C-terminal valine anchor residue was substituted by an alanine Interestingly, the variant peptide was found to bind as well to HLA-A2.1 as the prototype peptide, and the variant peptide itself was immunogenic in at least one patient who was infected by the variant virus. Thus, it would appear that the conservative substitution of an alanine for a valine at the C-terminal anchor residue may have paradoxically affected the ability of the peptide to be recognized by the CTL receptor mre than it affected its binding to the HLA-A2 molecule. Finally, several of these epitopes overlap with functionally and immunologically important domains wlthin the viral nucleocapsid and envelope proteins. For example, the H U -A 2 restricted envelope epitope FLLTRlLTl contains the core residues (RILTI) of an HLA DFw4 restricted helper T cell epitope previously described by Celis, et at. Additionally. 2 other envelope epitopes overlap wlth an important topogenic sequence within the transmembrane orientation of HBsAg. and the dually reStricted nucleocapsid epitope described above includes sequences involved in the nuclear localization and genome encapsidation functions of the nucleocapsid protein. The generation of a CTL response to such epitopes might yield a double benefit to the host: first, by destroying the infected cells and, second. by precluding the emergence of viable mutants. A possible by-product of this research may be the rational design of CTL-based therapeutic strategies to terminate persistent HBV infection. The same strategy can be applied to study the CTL response to any human pathogen whose genome has been cloned and sequenced. i Cytomegalovirus (CMV causes lethal disease in the immunocompromised host whereas infection of the immunocompetent is usually asymptomatic. Yet, even in presence of normal immune control, episodes of productive infection do occur and cause the horizontal transmission of the virus. Thus, the physiological antiviral immune response protects vilal tissues but executes a less stringent control over others. By studying the infection of the mouse with the murine CMV (MCMV) we wish to unravel the relative contribution of the specific immune effector mechanisms involved.",

Rouse, The most dramatic immunologic effect of infection by the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) is the severe depletion of CD4+ T helper cells (TH). However, a complex pattern of TH dysunction occurs before CD4+ cells fall to critical levels, such that TH function, assessed by interleukin 2 (IL-2) production, is first lost to recall antigens (including to HIV antigens), followed by loss of response to HLA alloantigens, and finally by lack of IL-2 production in response to PHA. The loss of recall antigen-stimulated IL-2 production occurs concomitant with the loss of PHA-stimulated IFNy production. suggesting a lack of TH-1 function. We also noted sequential increases in PHA-stimulated IL-4 and IL-10 production, suggesting an increase in TH2 function. Because these events are predictive for the onset of AIDS, it appears that there is a TH-1-TH-2 switch in the progression toward AIDS. Furthermore, we independently observed that PBMC from a high proportion (45-75%) of seronegative, HIV-exposed individuals exhibit strong TH 1 activity to HIV env-synthetic pepides. The seronegative, HIVexposed groups studied included: gay men; IV drug users; health care workers; and newborn infants of HIV+ mothers. Only 2% of presumed unexposed individuals exhibit similar TH activity. Considered together, these two seemingly unrelated sets of data suggest that immunoregulatory cytokines contribute to TH dysregulation after HIV infection, and that HIV-specific TH-1 type immunity may be protective against HIV infection.",

Recent advances in the understanding of antigen processing and presentation facilitate the identification of antigenic sites recognized by CD4+ helper T cells and by CD8+ cytotoxic T lymphocytes (n). and suggest methods to optimize the activity of these for consmction of synthetic peptide vaccines aimed at eliciting T-cell immunity. We have characterized the functional role of each residue in an HIV envelope peptide recognized by helper T cells from mice and humans. Only a few of the amino acid residues were necessary for binding to class I1 major histocompatibility complex (MHC) molecules and immunogenicity. as shown using a peptide consisting of only four of the original residues, with the rest replace by Ala The other residues were more remarkable for the negative impact they could have. Several of the non-critical residues could play a deleterious role if replaced with the wrong substitution, and removal of one negative charge in the natural sequence led to a peptide 100-fold more potent for stimulating specific T cells and for binding to MHC molecules, emphasizing the importance of adverse interactions in peptide-MHC binding. Similarly for a (TIZ site presented by multiple murine and human class I MHC molecules, (JIZ specificity was shown to focus on the dishnction between aromatic and aliphatic side chains at one position. This result, in turn, allowed the construction of chimeric peptides that induced broadly crossreactive responses for multiple strains of HIV-I, and that may reduce the risk of outgrowth of escape mutants, Thus, understanding the molecular basis for MHC binding and Another problem in the design of a synthetic vaccine is the polymorphism of the MHC, leading to differential recognition of different antigenic determinants of the same protein by individuals of different MHC types. One approach to overcome this problem that we have used for helper T-cells specific for the HIV-1 envelope protein was to identify multideterminant regions encompassing several overlapping determinants presented by different MHC molecules. Synhetic peptides spanning such multideterminant regions elicited T cell responses in multiple strains of mice and in humans of multiple HLA types. An alternative approach is to identify truly promiscuously recognized antigenic determinants. We have found one HIV CTL determinant to be presented by four different class I MHC molecules in mice and by at least two different class I molecules in humans. At least in mice, the same minimal core 10-residue sequence is presented by all four class 1 molecules. These antigenic sequences can then be coupled to produce a synthetic vaccine eliciting neutralizing antibodies and CTL in animals (or humans) of multiple MHC types.",

Sequence anallsis of multiple adenovirus serotypes has identified three conserved regions of the molecule (termed CR I . CR2 and CR3 I. Mutational analjsis has located several EIA functions to one or more of these regions. Hence. identification of EIA regions responsible for induction of TNF sensitivity could provide information about the mechanism b! w hich EIA influences the complex series of intracellular eients leading to TNF cytolysis. Previous studies using acute infection with A panel of adenoiiruses containing deletion mutants within EIA had implicated onl! residues within CRI in induction of TNF sensitivity. Surprisingl>. when these same mutants were employed as plasmids and transfected to produce stable cell lines. deletion of either the CR! or CR2 region resulted in loss of TNF sensitibit!. indicating that both regions are required. This finding suooests that two EIA functions are necessary for TNF sensitiiit!. one of 2 k -h IS provided hj CRI. and the other by either CRZ or another gene in adenoiirus. E\\idence that another geneis) in adenovirus can function to alter cellular susceptibility to TNF comes from the following obserration: Although neither SV40 T antigen nor the bovine papilloma virus (BPV) early region alone alters cellular susceptibility to TNF. both complement adenovirus mutants lacking all of EIA in inducing TNF sensitivity. Thus. T antigen. BPV. and a non-EIA adenovirus gene can all contribute to the cellular phenotype. with the suggestion that T antigen and BPV provide one function (the \"CRI\" function) that complements the \"CRZ\" function elsewhere in adenovirus. Furthermore, i t appears that the two regions of EIA can function independently to induce TNF sensitivity. This suggestion comes from transfection studies in which mutant proteins lacking either CRI or CR2 were introduced separately or together into mouse fibroblasts and stable cell lines developed. Although cells expressing either mutant alone remained as resistant to TNF as the parent NIH3T3 cell line, cells expressing both mutants become nearly as sensitive to TNF as cells transfected with the intact EIA gene. This complementation again suggests that two separate functions. acting in rrum, are responsible for induction of cellular sensitivity to TNF lysis. Dyson rr a/ (J. Virol. 66.406 i 1992)) have recently shown that EIA makes two distinct contacts with pRB. one involving residues within CRI and one within CR2. and that both regions are necessary for the highest affinity binding betueen EIA and pRB to occur. Furthermore. synthetic peptides derived from CRI and CR2 were found to hind independently to pRB. Thus, the ability of EIA to occup) two independent binding sites on pRB correlates with its abilit! to create the TNFsensitive cellular phenotype. The Netherlands. In C57BU6 (B6.H-2') ndnu mice large tumors arise after subcutaneous implantation of syngeneic Adenovirus (Ad) E l transformed embryo cells. In previous studies we showed that large tumor masses can be eradicated by i.v. infusion of cloned CTL directed against an immunodorninant AdBElA encoded peptide in Combination with interkukin-2 (1.2). The E1A peptide recognized is a 10 mer comprising amino acid sequence 234-243, SGPSNTPPEI (1,2). Thi s peptide is presented by the H-2Db MHC class I molecule and has a characteristic H-2D' binding ma8 with N and I anchor amino acids at postions 5 and 10, respectively (2,3). Cell lines transformed by mutant EIA constructs were generated with T -I, T -K and position 8 P -S mutations in the immunodorninant CTL epitope. Ten-mer peptides containing these mutations all bound equally well to the H-2Db molecule. CTL recognition and MHC binding studies w l h cell lines carrying these mutations in addaion to amino acid replacement studes with the Ad 234-243 peptide confirm the notion that position S(N) and lO(1) are cruclally important for Do binding. whereas CTL recognition is abolished by most alterations at positions 6-9.

Current efforts therefore concentrate on CTL epitopes present in this subset of latent proteins. Of particular interest here is an epitope of LMP1, now defined at the peptide level, which is conserved in all EBVisolates studied to date and which is presented by HLA-A2.1, a common allele in many human populations.

A hallmark of RSV infection in humans is its ability to cause repeat infections. Three major mediators of immunity to RSV have been identified, namely serum IgG antibodies to the RSV fusion (F) and attachment (G) glycoproteins, nasal wash IgA antibodies, and CD8' cytotoxic T-cells. Reinfection with RSV results from inadequacies in one or more of these arms of the immune response. These inadequacies reflect one or more of the following: immunological immaturity at the time of first infection, antibody-mediated suppression of the antibody response to first infection by transplacentally transferred maternal IgG serum antibodies, or waning IgA or CD8* T-cell immunity. For example, the CD8* T-cell immune response is highly effective at restricting replication of RSV challenge virus on days 6-9 following immunization of mice with an immunogen inducing mainly CD8* T-cell immunity, but is ineffective at restricting replication or at accelerating clearance of virus 45 days after immunization. Repeat infection with RSV also reflects the inherent high infectivity and olte Abstracts virulence of this virus as well as the existence of two antigenic subgroups that are about 25% related by cross-neutralization analysis.",

An analysis of the immunological basis of disease potentiation revealed that FI-RSV vaccine created a series of specific immunological imbalances including induction of antibodies with decreased ability to neutralize RSV, augmentation of CD4* T-cell response, and a decreased or absent CD8' T-cell response. Furthermore, depletion of CD4*, but not CD8*, T-cells in PI-RSV immunized mice at the time of RSV challenge abrogated inflammatory cell infiltration in the lungs of mice. Considered together, our findings suggest that the potentiated disease in humans is a delayed type hypersensitivity reaction at the sites of pulmonary virus replication. Immunization with RSV subunit and vaccinia virus vectored vaccines will be discussed in this context. The site of envelopment at the inner nuclear membrane determines for herpes simplex virus (HSV) the need to be transported vectorially to the extracellular compartment.

            "text": "In the past few years it emerged that HSV transport can be dissected in two major steps that require viral and cellular functions. The first step consists in the virion sorting from the space between the inner and outer nuclear membranes to the cytoplasm and occurs by pinching off the virions in vacuoles derived from the outer nuclear membrane. This step requires the viral protein UL20, in that a HSV mutant deleted in the ORF UL20 remains blocked at the space between the inner and outer nuclear membranes. As the block only takes place in some cell lines, some cells can complement the ORF UL20 deletion in the viral genome. UL20 is a multiple transmembrane protein that appears to be located in the virion itself. The results support the view that UL20 belongs to a family of viral and cellular membrane proteins involved in intracellular transport. For the subsequent steps in the vectorial transport, HSV exploits the exocytic pathway. Studies with mutant cells defective in Golgi enzymes or with a variety of Golgi inhibitors indicate that virion particles interact with the Golgi apparatus, and this interaction is crucial for virus exit out of the cell and concomitantly for processing of the virion envelope glycoproteins to mature forms. Immunocytochemical location of Golgi-resident proteins coupled with electron microscopic examinations of HSV-infected cells reveals a fragmentation of Golgi apparatus and a dispersal of the fragmented elements throughout the cytoplasm. This occurs at the time of virus maturation and is peculiar to some cell lines. Restriction to superinfection is mediated by the presence of the viral glycoprotein D (gD) at the plasma membrane. In gD-cells the superinfecting virus is taken up by endocytosis and degraded. Surprisingly, HSV mutants able to overcome the gD-mediated restriction and to infect productively the gD-expressing cell lies were found to be mutated in gD itself. These findings raise the possibility that the block to superinfection observed in gDexpressing cells is exerted through an interaction between cellular gD and virion gD.

Infection with HIV-~UCI led to rapid and extensive CD4 depletion (comparable to HlV-1~~162). whereas intection with H l v -2~~ did not result in a detectable decline in CD4 T cell numbers. We conclude that the behavior of HIV isolates in tissue culture may not predict their pathogenic potential in vivo, and suggest that macrophage-tropism may be a marker for a more highly cytopathic effect (either directly or indirectly mediated) for human CD4 T cells in HIV-infected individuals. In addition, viral load may not be an accurate predictor of disease progression. (Supported by NIH grants A129181 and AI30238). Negative strand RNA viruses are a group of viruses whose genomes consist of single-stranded RNA of negative polarity. Since the purified RNA of these viruses is not in itself infectious when introduced into cells, novel methods have had to be develcped to allow the genetic manipulation of these viruses. Recently! a ribonucleoprotein transfection protocol was designed which allows the rescue of influenza virus cDNA-derived RNA into infectious influenza virus. Thus, taking advantage of DNA technologies, it is now possible to alter the genome of at least one negative strand RNA virus and obtain viruses made from synthetic RNA. Introducing mutations into the coding region of influenza virus genes allows a detailed structure function analysis of influenza virus proteins. This approach is at times Limited due to the fact that lethal mutations do not provide insight into the mechanism of the inactivation. However, it can help us to learn whether a feature is essential for infectious virus formation. For example, studies involving a mutational analysis of the cytoplasmic tail of the hemagglutinin have shown that palmitoylation is a postuanslational modification essential for viral morphogenesis. When the mutation is not lethal, the approach may help us to correlate specific biological properties with specific sequences in proteins. For example, modifications of sequences in the hemagglutinin or the neuraminidase have allowed us to obtain novel influenza viruses with changes affecting host range, virulence and/or antigenicily. pentamers Crystallographic analysis has provided knowledge of shell structures to atomic resoluuon In 1956 it was proposed that a single antibody molecule, bindmg to a cnucal sile, is sufficient to neuualize poliovirus (I) We sought such a single-hit anubody from a panel of 46 IgC monoclonal anubodies (mAb) 32 against human rhinovirus 14 (HRV14) and 14 dgamst type 1 poliovuus (PV1) Most of these anubcdies neuualized by smple aggregauon 8. however, were ver) poor precipitators, producing no aggregates or clumps 01 two or threc vnons which d d not funher aggregate with ume suggesung that both arms o l the IgG molecule were stably attached to the same vinon Saturauon binding levels. 30 moleculeslvirion. supported this picture, which implies that the anchcimg arm of non-aggregating lgGs binds in an onentauon favorable for rapid binding of the second arm to an adjaccnt epitope probably across 2-fold symmetry joins. thereby lmking adjacent pentamers (2) This picture has now been visually confirmed by cryoelecmn microscopy which shows that bound Fab fragments from one of lhese anubodies mAbl7. mrecled against epitope IA of HRV14, pomt drecrly across a pentamer joint toward its partner",

Kropff, Universilit Erlangen-Nurnberg, Erlangen, Germany The vast majority of anti-envelope antibodies produced after infection with human cytomegalovirus(HCMV) are directed against the major envelope glycoprotein complex,gp55-l16(gB). This response includes virus neutralizing, non-neutralizing and infected cell surface reactive antibodies. We have previously shown that the immunodominant antibody binding site on gB consisted of a 70 a.a. continuous domain(AD-1), as defined with both murine and human monoclonal antibodies. We have further investigated the antigenic properties of this domain utilizing an expanded panel of murine monoclonal antibodies and human convalescent serum. In agreement with previous results, human antibody recognition of this region of gB required the intact 7Gaa domain. Deletions of either the amino-or carboxy-terminus of AD-I, as well as internal aa replacements abolished antibody recognition of the domain. In addition, we have shown that high affinity, AD-1 specific antibodies produced in patients undergoing primary infection with HCMV were restricted to the lgGl subclass. Mice immunized with the intact AD-I produced antibodies which were reactive with the full length gB but exhibited differing affinities and biological activities. A panel of monoclonal antibodies was derived following immunization with AD-1 and utilized to further characterize the antigenic structure of AD-I. Together with AD-1 mutants, this panel of monoclonal antibodies should provide additional insight into the antigenic structure of this unique region of gB. were assayed for their proliferative responses to peptide presented by a panel of transfected mouse L cells expressing HLA-DR7 heterodimers with single point mutations in either the DR alpha molecule or the DR7 beta molecule.

Restricted usage of either the V a or Vp chains of the TCR which has been observed in many immune mediated diseases and infections allows TCR-specific antibodies (Abs) to be used as a therapeutic approach. To assay for TCR a and p chain restriction, the srmcture of the TCR in LCMV specific cytotoxic lymphocytes (a) in Balb/c (H-2d) mice was investigated. Greater than 95% of the LCMV specific Cn. response at the clonal level is restricted to a single nine amino acid peptide from the viral nucleoprotein presented by Ld in H-2d mice infected with LCMV. Three CTL clones with specificity for this unique NP epitope presented by Ld were randomly selected for study of their TCR structure. Using \"Anchor PCR\", all three clones were found to have unique V a and Vp chains relative to each other and lack restriction to any particular variable chain. Additionally, none of the three (7n clones possess the Va4 chain previously reported to be restricted to the H-2b (Db) GP2 epitope in the LCMV model. Molecular analysis of two different MHC backgrounds ( H-2d, H-2b) which present four major epitopes on two different MHC molecules( Ld, Db), shows no resmction to one or two specific variable chains across these backgrounds. These results indicate that in this virus system, TCR-specific Abs directed at restricted variable chains will not be an effective therapy, and suggests that in situations with more complex patterns of MHC presentation like humans, TCR-specific immunotherapy is less likely to be useful. and peptide fragments in a pre-golgi companmenr Little is known about the factors which regulate the formation of these antigenic peptide fragments within the cell. To examine the role of residues within a core epitope and in the flanking sequences for the generation and presentation of the newly synthesized peptide fragment recognized by CD8+ CTL we have mutagenized the coding sequence for the CTL epitope spanning residues 202-221 in the influenza A/Japan/57 HA. In this study over 60 substitution mutations in the epitope were tested for their effects on target cell sensitization using a cytoplasmic viral expression system. The HA202-221 site contains two overlapping subsites defined by Cn. clones 11-1 and 40-2. Mutations in HA residues 204-213 or residues 210-219 often abolished target cell lysis by Cl'L clones 11-1 and 40-2, respectively. Although residues outside the core epitope did not usually affect the ability to be lysed by CTL clones, substitution of a Gly residue for Val-214 abolished lysis by clone 11-1. These data suggest that residues within a site which affect MHC binding and T cell receptor recognition appear to play the predominant role in dictating the formation of the antigenic complex recognized by CD8+ CTL and therefore the antigenicity of the protein antigen presented to CD8+ T cells. Most alterations in residues flanking the endogenously expressed epitope do not appreciably affect the generation and recognition of the site. (TMEV) into CBA mice, results in a biphasic disease ofthe central nervous system (CNS). The first phase resembles poliomyelitis with some of the mice exhibiting paralysis. The virus is cleared &om the CNS at about 4 weeks post-infection, and this clearance correlates with the development of a neutralising antibody response. The chronic phase of the disease occurs ffom 6 weeks post-infection and primary demyelinating lesions can be seen in the spinal cord. In order to define the B cell epitopes of TMEV, neutralising monoclonal antibodies were raised against B e h in Balb/c mice. Two of these antibodies, which react with the capsid protein VP1 in a W e s t e r n blot, will neutralise the demyelinating strains of TMEV as well as a virulent strain which causes acute encephalitis. The monoclonal antibodies were used to select two neutralisation-resistant variants of BeAn. These viruses can not be neutralised by the monoclonal antibodies, nor by hyperimmune sera raised against BeAn in rabbits and mice. However, sera raised a g a a the two variants will neutralise themselves and the wild type virus.

Additional regions of the HA molecule were found which bind to H-2Kd but do not serve as class I MHC-restricted T cell epitopes. To determine if intracellular competition among antigenic peptides for processing may prevent presentation of cryptic epitopes, an HA gene construct deleted of the two dominant H-2 Kd restricted epitopes was inserted into vaccinia virus and used to prime mice. Even in the absence of dominant epitopes, CTL recognizing cryptic HA epitopes were not detected. Because potential epitopes may be destroyed or may not be accessible for processing, a non-recognized H-2Kd binding synthetic HA peptide (HA 177-188) was used as a pre-processed antigen to elicit CTL in vitro. Peptide-specific CTL were not demonstrable, suggesting HA 177-188 specific CTL might be deleted during ontogeny. Forty-two variant peptides were therefore synthesized with single or double amino acid substitutions or deletions within the HA 177-188 sequence and were tested for their ability to elicit peptidespecific CTL in vitro. All of the variant peptides elicited peptide-specific CTL capable of lysing target cells sensitized with exogenous peptide, but only one peptide elicited CTL which could recognize endogenously expressed peptide. These data suggest antigenic peptides must bind MHC molecules such that peptide conformation within the Ag-binding groove of the MHC permits the high affinity interaction with TCR necessary for recognition of an enodgenously produced epitope.",

Self-reactive T cell hybridomas recognize sequences on S-Ag that are conserved between both species whereas non-self reactive hybridomas recognize only bovine sequences. These hybridomas are also distinguished by their activation requirements. Ag presentation to the self-reactive hybridomas requires a radiosensitive APC signal. Ag presented by non-irradiated splenic APC stimulates the self-reactive hybridomas, however low doses of y-radiation reduce the ability of the APC to present Ag to the hybridomas. This radio-sensitive APC signal is protected by treatment with PMA or LPS and IL-4. Neither the radio-sensitivity of this signal nor the protection corresponds to changes in MHC class I1 expression. The autoreactive hybridomas also d o not respond to Ag presented by thymic APC. In contrast to the autoreactive hybridomas, a nonself-reactive hybridoma does not require a radiosensitive APC signal, and responds to Ag presented by splenic or thymic APC. These data suggest a radio-sensitive, tissuespecific co-signal required to activate autoreactive T cell hybridomas, and may aid in understanding peripheral tolerance of autoreactive T cells. Several reports in literature described identification of peptides representing CTL epitopes in a number of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) proteins. We have developed a new screening method that allowed us to identify those peptide epitopes that actually induce viral specific CTLs. Using this method we have identified V3 loop peptides from several HIV-1 strains capable of inducing HIV-specific CTLs. Because of the known role of V3 loop peptides in inducing HIV neutralizing antibodies, we also tested these peptides for inhibition of HIV infection of human T cells. We observed that V3 loop peptides from several HIV-1 strains when used at nanogram quantities exhibit efficient inhibition of virus infection of several human T cell lines as well as freshly isolated normal human T cells. Further, our studies revealed that these V3 loop peptides were capable of inhibiting syncytia formation between HIV-1 infected cells and normal CD4expressing cells indicating that these peptides can prevent cell-to-cell spread of virus, a phenomenon known to play a major role in HIVinduced pathology in AIDS patients. Even though the V3 loop region is known to be highly variable among different virus isolates, a comparison of several HIV-1 strains revealed that most strains can be grouped into five or less categories. We therefore propose that V3 loop peptides as a mixture will provide a potent immunotherapeutic formulation for: (1) Thomas.

We wished to take advantage of the COOS cell system to establish a procedure to enable screening of a library of parasite genes directly with CTL. In initial, model expenments. we have used bovine alloreactive CTL and COS cells transiently transfected with a plasmid comtaining cDNA encoding the corresponding bovine class I MHC molecule. We have demonstrated that, in a standard microcytotoxicity assay, bovine alloreactive CTL can detect a bovine MHC molecule transiently expressed in a COS cell population. The sensitivity of the assay is such that the alloreactive T2 cells. derived from the EBV transformed B lymphoblastoid cell line ,174, has a profound defect in the class I mediated antigen presentation pathway due to a chromosomal deletion encompassing -1 megabase in the MHC class I1 region. This deletion includs pepbde transporter genes associated with antigen presentation (TAP1 and TAP2) and genes coding for proteasome subunits. Surprisingly, we demonstrated that T2 cells, after infection with Sendai virus, were readily lulled by H-2Kb restricted CD8+ T cells, whereas T2 or T2Db were not killed. Control erperiments revealed that P815A2 was not killed whereas killing against P815Kb was readily observed. Killing of Sendai virus infected T2Kb was dependent of CD8+ T C R a P T cells. Treatment of effector cells with anti-CD4, anti-NK1.l and complement (C') or C' alone gave significant lysis levels, while lysis levels were markedly reduced after treatment with anti-CD8 or anti-TCRap and C'. In accordance with previous findings, T2Kb was not able to present vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) antigens to VSV-specific CTL in the present study. Furthermore, presentation of influenza virus A/PR/8/34 and AINT160I68 by T?Db after virus infection was greatly impaired. In addition, the RMA-S mutant line also presented Sendai virus specific antigen after v i m infection. Interestingly, Brefeldin A (BFA) treatment completely blccked presentation of Sendai virus antigen in F'815Kb control cells. Unexpectedly, presentation of Sendai virus antigen in T2Kb was not blocked by BFA, even when a high concentration of BFA was used. The present finding suggested that a non-classical antlgen presentation pathway may function in T? cells.

Since both class I and I1 presentation was accelerated, it seems that both rapidity of antigeen processing and factors involved in viral entry (adherence, entry or uncoating) determine the kinetics of antigen presentation. superantigen, also known as MIS-la, which in viva stimulates almost exclusively CD4+ Tcells expressing V06. Spleen cells from BALB.D2 (Mls-la) are injected either locally (in the hind foot pad) or systemically (i.v.) into BALBk (Mls-lb) mice. The changes in the V06+CD4+ population are recorded using flow cytometry. Lymphokine secretion patterns are anlysed using the ELISPOT technique as well as PCR analysis of lymphokine mRNA expression. Ig-production is analysed using an isotype-specific ELISPOT assay. Furthermore, the appearance of anergy to MIS-la is followed. Local and systemic injection of Mls-la-expressing cells both induce a vigorous B cell response as well as an initial expansion of the V06+CD4+ population. We are now correlating the isotype distribution of the B cell response with the lymphokine secretion pattern and the development of anergy and deletion of the responsive Tells. Using a new mAb specific for T cells expressing the human Vp2 gene segment we haxe discovered that Vp2 gene use is bimodal in a normal human population. About 80% of normal individuals have 8.22 1.1% VpZ'CD?' T cells. The other 20% have 1.2?0.6% VpZ'CD?' T cells. Both Vp2 high and Vp2 low expression are stable over time. Vp2 low expression is inherited, probably as an autosomal dominant trait, and is not linked to the TCR locus. Vp2 low individuals have Vp2 genes and the T cells which express them can be expanded by the Vg2 selective toxin TSST-1 and by the Vp2 specific mAh indicating that these cells are not anergic. Clearance of influenza A virus infected cells is predominantly accomplished by CD8+-vim specific cytotoxic T cells. In order to characterize this effector population, we have analysed the TcR usage in lymphocytes isolated from mediastinal lymph nodes (MLN) and bronchoaveolar lavage (BAL) of m K x 3 I-infected C57BV6 (H-2b) mice. We identified a strong enrichment of Vp8.3' CD8' T cells in both MLN and BAL of secondarily-infected mice, and BAL taken from mice after primary infection. Depletion of Vg8.3' T cells in vivo did not compromise the ability of mice to clear the virus, suggesting that other TcR elements are also involved in viral clearance. The VB8.3' CD8' T cells are directed to an immunodominant epitope of flu nucleoprotein (NP) since expansion of these cells was also seen in mice infected with a recombinant vaccinia virus construct containing the NP epitope 366-380. Analysis of T cell hybridomas, generated from freshly isolated BAL of infected mice, confirmed and extended these observations. The majority of flu-specific T cell hybridomas were Vp8.3', though other TcR Vg elements were represented. The Vp8.3' hybridomas recognized the core H-2Db-restricted NP epitope, 366-374. These hybridomas expressed similar Dp and JP elements of the TcR whereas V a usage was more variable. It was concluded that I) the preferential expansion of Vp8.3+ CD8'T cells in response to influenza infection is due to recognition of an immunodominant epitope within NP, and 2) the response to influenza A virus infection is dominated by, but not exclusively, Vp8.3+T cells. We have shown that T cell receptor (TcR) beta chain transgenic mice, expressing Vg8.1 on essentially all T cells, respond immunologically to influenza viral challenge, clearing virus from the lungs with kinetics comparable to the non-transgenic (CBNCa, H-2k) counterpart. Here we characterize the TcR repertoire of, and the ligands recognized by, influenza specific T cells from transgenic and wild type mice. To determine the MHC restriction pattern, antigen specificity and TcR variable region gene usage in influenza specific T cells in wild type and TcRg transgenic mice, we have generated a large panel of hybridomas from CD4+ and CD8+ T cells derived from the mediastinal lymph nodes of these strains. Most of the Class I restricted hybrids derived from the transgenic and wild type mice recognize nucleoprotein (NP) epitopes. Furthermore, these hybrids are restricted by Kk, indicating that the same epitope of NP is likely recognized in both strains of mice. The specificities of Class I1 restricted hybrids from transgenic and wild type mice will be compared to determine if similar TcR ligands are generated and recognized. Phenotypic analysis of the TcRVB usage has shown that while all of the transgenic hybrids express Vg8.1, cells bearing this Vg element are poorly represented in the non-transgenic repertoire (20%). This finding suggests that while Class I restricted T cells in transgenic and non-transgenic mice may recognize identical ligands, they do so by using different TcR repertoires. This has implications for the plasticity of the T cell receptor repertoire. Cytotoxic T-lymphocytes (CTL) recognize peptides derived from endogenously expressed proteins in association with dass I MHC. In contrast, exogenous antigens associate with class I1 M H C following endocytosis to a n endosomal compartment. W e u s e d the b i n d i n g and translocating d o m a i n s of Pseudomoms exotoxin A (PE) fused with CTL epitopes from influenza matrix protein and nucleoprotein as a m e a n s of delivering exogenous antigens to intracellular class I MHC. These recombinant fusion proteins (PEMa, PENP) were capable of sensitizing class I M H C + target cells for lysis by the appropriate CTL. In contrast, a n irrelevant protein, glutathione-s-transferase, fused to the matrix epitope did n o t sensitize target cells. A point mutant of PEMa, corresponding to an endosomal proteolytic processing mutant of PE, h a d a substantially reduced ability to sensitize target cells. Thus the presentation of the CTL epitope by class I M H C required internalization and processing of PEMa similar to that of the toxin. However, unlike PE, PEMa m a y not require translocation to the cytoplasm to exert its effect. Two inhibitors of PE intoxication, NH4C1, which raises endosomal pH a n d inhibits PE a t a step subsequent to proteolysis, and brefeldin A, which m a y inhibit PE by disrupting the Golgi complex, did not inhibit sensitization of target cells by PEMa. Also, PEMa was capable of sensitizing T2 cells for lysis. The T2 mutant cells are defective in transport of peptides from the cytosol to the lumen of the ER for presentation by class I MHC. These results suggest that PEMa is proteolytically processed in a n endosomal compartment leading to association of the epitope with class I MHC, possibly by internalization of class I M H C and recycling to the cell surface. Fusion proteins such as PEMa m a y be useful as vaccines intended to elicit a CTL response. When the rnurine respiratory tract is infected with influenza virus, there is an influx of 7 6 T cells into the lung. In order to understand the role of these cells, it has been important to establish whether they have specificity for viral proteins. We have used Cg-mutant mice kindly provided to us by Drs Mombaerts and Tonegawa (MIT, Boston MA) in order to work in a system deficient of virus-specific ap T cells. Cell suspensions from the mediastinal lymph nodes of N H K (X31) infected mice were cultured with conA for 3 days before fusion with BWn-3cells. The 76 T cell hybridomas were screened for virus specificity by measuring IL2 released from cells in the presence of influenza-infected cells. A selected hybridorna could be stimulated by macrophages presenting the infecting virus N H K (H3N2), as well as N P R 8 (HlN1) but not BIHK. H-2 compatible or H-2 dtfferent virus-infected macrophage cell lines could be used to stimulate the hybridoma. This suggests that the 76 T cell hybridoma recognizes a conserved internal viral protein which is not presented by classical class I or II molecules. In the mouse, self superantigen (Mls) which influence the T cell repertoire and stimulate strong MLR responses have been described. These superantigens (sAg) are encoded by the ORE in the 3'LTR of MMTV virus integrated in the mouse genome. They are responsible for clonal deletion and inactivation of T cells expressing specific Vps.",

We have previously described an MIS-lalike clonal deletion of mature CD4+ T cells which express Vp6 and Vp8.1 chains of the 'r cell receptor in half of the mice of a BALBlc. MIS-lb colony (BALBlc. IC). This occurs in the absence of the Mtv-7 provirus which is responsible for thc clonal deletion in MIS-la mice (I). Using a PCR assay, we showed that Mtv-7 homologous transcripts were present in the mammary glands of lactating BALBlc, IC mice and in the thymuses andlor spleens of BALBlc, IC virgin mice with deletion of Vp6+ lymph node T cells, and not in BALB/c. IC with normal Vp6 expression (2). These results indicate that this BALB/c colony is infected with an exogenous MMTV retrovirus whose vSAG is similar to that of Mtv-7 provirus, as recently reported. Transmission of this virus is achieved through the milk from the laccating mother to the suckling pups. Mother forstering with mice of different H-2 backgrounds showed that the requirement for I-E expression is more stringent when the clonal deletion is induced by the exogenous than the endogenous virus. Thymectomies performed at 4-5 weeks of age (at least 4 weeks before detection of clonal deletion), did not affect the occurrence of clonal deletion in peripheral lymph nodes when tested twenty weeks later. This suggesu that clonal deletion can be achieved without further intrathymic contact with the antigen. Since MMTV is uansmitwd through milk and is likely to be present in the gut, we evaluated the percentage of Vp6+CD4+ T cells within the gut intraepithelial lymphocyte (IEL) population. Mice with normal Vp6 expression in lymph nodes may show partial deletion of Vp6+CD4+ IEL. This is explained by exclusive localisation of Mtv-7-like RNA in the gut of some mice. Finally, despite the similarity of the vSAG encoded by the endogenous Mtv-7 with the exogenous MMTV in BALBlc, IC mice, the latter has a much lower stirnulatory capacity when compared to the former.",

The rat -> mouse chimeras possessing de n o w generated rat T cells were established b y transplanting Lewis rat fetal liver cells into neonatal C.B-17 SCID (H-Zd, Mlsc) mice. Firstly, the lymph nodes from the rat -> mouse chimeras contained considerably reduced levels of rat Vg 3, 5, 12 and lbpositive T cellsthese Vg+ T cells a r e easily detectable in normal Lewis rats although Vg11+ T cells are inherently very low. (Note that rat TCR Vg chains a r e numbered according to the homologous m o u s e conterparts). The deletion of rat Vg16+ T cells in the chimeras w a s confirmed with a recently produced rat Vg16-specific m A b HIS 42. Secondly, the T cells from the rat -> mouse chimeras proliferated very strongly to H-2 matched Mls-positive DBA/Z (H-Zd, Mlsa) stimulator cells i n mixed lymphocyte culture, although these T cells showed complete tolerance to syngeneic BALB/c (H-2d, Mlsa-) stimulator cells. The rat T cell population responding to DBA/2 stimulator cells was highly enriched for rat Vg6+ and 8.2+ T cells. Similar results were obtained with chimeras established by tranplanting fetal liver from another rat strain (Fisher 344) into C.B-17 SCID mice. These data suggest that rat T cells a r e able to react to mouse MIS antigens, a n d that rat T cells are be subjected to MMTV antigen-mediated clonal deletion during T cells differentiation in the rat -> mouse chimeras. Mouse Mammary Tumour Virus (MMTV) has long been known to contain an open reading frame (ORF) within its unusually long U3 region. This ORF has the potential to encode a set of proteins of varying sizes. Recently we have shown that the ORF encodes a negative transcriptional regulatory factor (nafl which functions in trans to decrease the rate of transcription from an MMTV based indicator construct [J.Virol.,l990;64.6355]. Downregulatory naf effects can also be seen on homologous and heterologous promoters linked to the luciferase gene. It has also been shown that the MMTV ORF encodes a superantigen (sag), the expression of which during ontogeny, results in the VR specific deletion of Tlymphocytes. This appears to occur by a specific interaction between the sag and the 13 chain of the T-cell receptor that is common among a given class of T-cells. Although sag and naf are both products of the ORF, it is not clear how these t w o activities are related. However using a series of constructs we have been able to distinguish between the required coding regions for nafand sag. Additionally, we have identified a novel promoter located within the U3 part of the long terminal repeat region (LTR). Both the previously described promoter and the novel U3 promoter are active in mammary cells and Blymphocytes. However the U3 promoter is preferentially active in LPS stimulated B-lymphocytes and is able to direct expression of the sag product, making it a candidate for the lyphocyte specific expression of this gene in the mouse. The role of the immune response in RSV infection is not well understood. Re infection is common in both children and adults despite the presence of RSV specific antibodies and a T cell response to RSV antigens. It is intriguing that inactivated RSV (IRSV), but not infectious RSV (Inf-RSV) stimulates the T cell proliferative response in vitro. We have analyzed whether stimulation of blood mononuclear cells with IRSV and Inf-RSV results in differences in expression of surface markers and cytokines important in the immune response. HLA-DR, ICAM-1, CDlla, CDllb, CDl lc, CD14, CD4 and CD8 expression was determined by flow cytometry on unexposed and RSV-exposed monocytes and lymphocytes 24 and 48 hours after stimulation. A dramatic effect on monocyte surface markers was found with both Inf-RSV and IRSV: a 4-8 fold increase in HLA-DR, a 2-4 fold increase in ICAM-1, a 2-4 fold increase in CDl lc, a 1.5-2 fold increase in CDllb, and a 2 4 fold decrease in CD14; Inf-RSV was generally twice as effective as IRSV. There was no change in CDl la expression. The only effect of RSV on the lymphocytes was an increase in CDl lb positive, HLA-DR negative cells found with Inf-RSV but not with IRSV. Exposure of the monocytes to virus in the absence of T cells gave none of the changes in surface antigen expression. Various cytokines such as IFN-y, IL-2, IL-4, IL-10, and GM-CSF have each been shown to induce some of the changes seen in monocytes after RSV stimulation. These cytokines are being analyzed in the supernatants of IRSV and Inf-RSV stimulated cells. The high HLA-DR and ICAM-1 expression on RSV infected monocytes would suggest effective antigen presentation, but these cells do not support RSV-specific T cell proliferation, as measured by 3Hthymidine incorporation. Instead their state of activation may result in increased production of mediators which counteract immune responses, as well as influence T cell functions other than proliferation. This abmact of a proposed presentation does not necessarily reflect EPA policy. T cell clonal anergy is a form of tolerance in which mature T cells are physically present but are not able to mount an immune response. We induced T cell unresponsiveness to MIs-la in mice transgenic for T cell receptor VP8.1 by injection of MIs-la spleen cells, by mating with Mls-la mice, and by generating bone marrow chimeras in which Mls-la is present only on nonhematopoietic cells. CD4+8-VP8.1+ cells from all these groups did not proliferate in response to irradiated spleen cells from MISl a mice. However, the mechanisms underlying the unresponsiveness appear to differ. CD4+8-Vp8.1+ cells from Mlsl a spleen cell injected Vp8.1-transgenic mice mobilized cytoplasmic Ca2+ but proliferated at a reduced level in response to crosslinking with anti-TCR mAb. However, these cells formed conjugates, mobilized Ca*+ and proliferated in response to Mlsl a when activated B cells were used as stimulators. In Mls-lam VP8.1-transgenic mice, a subpopulation of CD4+8-Vp8.1+ cells did not mobilize cytoplasmic Can+ after TCR crosslinking. They did not form conjugates, mobilize Ca2+ or proliferate in response to Mls-la on activated B cells. Finally, CD4+8-VP8.1+ cells from the bone marrow chimeras proliferated to TCR crosslinking at a partially reduced level; and formed conjugates, mobilized Ca2+. and proliferated in response to MIS-1 a on activated B cells.",

Vaccinia virus, a member of the poxvirus family of large cytoplasmic DNA viruses, has been used extensively in studying the mechanism of antigen processing and presentation. However, as with some other viruses, vaccinia encodes a number of gene products which are involved in interfering with the host cell immune response. These include an interleukin-lp receptor, complement control proteins and serine protease inhibitors (serpins). Previous data from recombinant vaccinia viruses expressing the influenza virus haemagglutinin (HA) or nucleoprotein (NP) have shown that vaccinia infection interferes with the presentation of some epitopes from these proteins to class I-restricted cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTL). Recombinant vaccinia viruses expressing the influenza HA or NP have been constructed in which either or both vaccinia serpins (B13R and B22R) have been deleted. The presentation of influenza epitopes from cells infected with influenza or vaccinia virus recombinants with or without the serpins was monitored by 5lCr release after incubation with epitope-specific CTL. An epitope presented from influenza virus infected cells but not from serpin positive vaccinia virus infected cells was re-presented after serpin deletion. This restoration was epitope and serpin specific and occurred at early but not late times during vaccinia infection. Further experiments to address this block at late times are being undertaken.",

Between 10-15% of the LDV-infected macrophages were lysed when mcubated with LN cells from LDV-infected mice. whereas mockinfected macrophages were not significantly lysed. Since only 5.15% of macrophages from adult mice are LDV-permissive. these results suggest that all LDV-infected macrophages were lysed and that the colonmehic method IS suitable for detecting cell lysis in our system. Producnon of yIFN. measured by both ELISA and Noithem analysis of the mRNA. indicated mcreases in yiFN synthesis following LDV infecnon beginning about 4 days p.i. This correlated well with increased plasma levels of lgG2a. However, addihOn of IFN to macrophage cultures failed to inhibit VLNS replication.

The CD8+ clone 2.613.4 was shown to mediate Tag-speafic cytotoxicity and is presently being used to study the relative inaccessibility of pancreatic 13 tumor cells to T cell recognition. In addition, w e have cloned the T cell receptor (TCR) variable region genes expressed in one of the CD4+ T cell lines (2.5T) by RT-PCR techniques and have subsequently isolated the genomic V138.3-Df32.1-J02.4 and Va2-JaMT1-27 V gene rearrangements encoding a MHC CHI restricted Tag-specific TCR. Clonotypespecific as well as Vf38.3-specific antibodies were generated by immunization of mice with a hybridoma line expressing this TCR. The genomic V138.3 and Va2 gene rearrangements were inserted into cosmid vectors already containing the TCR a and f3 constant region genes (provided by D. Loh) and are presently used to generate TCR transgenic mice which will then be bred to either the tolerant or the autoimmune RIP-Tag mice. With the availability of these reagents w e are planning to further dissect the various pathways of T cell responsiveness toward the 13 cells in RIP-Tag mice. The HTLV-I regulatory protein tax transactivates the promoter for transforming growth factor 8 (TGF-O), a cytokine that potently suppresses T cell proliferation. Nevertheless, HTLV-I infected T cell clones display a prolonged state of T cell activation. T cell proliferation occurs after pRb phosphorylation, inactivating the suppressive effect of pRb. In these experiments, we investigated whether HTLV-I infected T cells from patients with HTLV-I associated myelopathy/tropical spastic paraparesis (HAM/TSP) conferred resistance to immune suppression by TGF-8. T cell clones were generated from peripheral blood of HAM/TSP patients by direct single cell cloning and characterized by PCR and Southem blot analysis for the presence of HTLV-I infection. Response to TGF-8 was measured by 3H-TdR incorporation. Phosphorylation of pRb was identified by immunoprecipitation of 3 5 smethionine labelled T cells. We found that HTLV-I infected but not noninfected T cell clones were impaired in their growth suppression by TGF-81 and this correlated with the failure of TGF-61 to inhibit phosphorylation of pRb. These findings suggest that HTLV-I has evolved a defense against immune suppression of its host cell. Resistance to TGF-PI induced suppression in HTLV-I infected T cells may have important implications for the altered immune regulation in H A W S P patients. El, an abundantly expressed viral transcription factor, is essential for CMV replication and has been suggested to serve as one of the main target antigens for Tc. However, IEl-specific Tc responses were not detected among nearly 500 CMV-specific Tc clones that were isolated by in viuo stimulation of PBMC from 10 individuals with CMV-infected autologous fibroblasts. Isolation of IE-specific Tc clones required stimulation in vitro with autologous cells that selectively expressed lE1 and no other CMV proteins. Even with this approach, only 6 CD8+. IEspecific Tc clones were isolated from over 7680 wells seeded at limiting dilution (0.3 celldwell). Each IE-specific Tc clone demonstrated greater than 32% Class I-resmcted lysis (E:T=lO) of cells infected with an IEIrecombinant vaccinia virus (vacIE), but less than 5 % specific lysis of CMV-infected targets despite readily detectable IEI expression.

To determine if other viral antigens were also inefficiently presented in CMV-infected cells, lysis of these targets by Tc clones specific for CMV matrix protein pp65, and CMV envelope protein gB were analyzed and compared to IE-specific Tc responses. CMV-infected target cells were recognized and lysed by Tc specific for pp65 from early phase (Qhrs pi.) (1 1% lysis) through late phase (48hrs pi.) (50% lysis), and were efficiently lysed (25% lysis) by gB-specific Tc during late phase infection. As before, IE-specific Tc demonstrated less than 5% specific lysis of these targets during all phases of CMV infection @:T=lO). To determine if other CMV proteins were responsible for resmcting IEl presentation. we compared target cells infected with vacIE alone with those coinfected with vacIE and CMV for lysis by IE-specific Tc. IE-specific Tc demonstrated 45% specific lysis of vacIE-infected targets but less than 5% lysis of coinfected targets (E:T=lO). even though both targets expressed equal levels of E l . Our data demonstrate that CMV has evolved a mechanism that restricts the presentation of a specific viral protein, IEI. Such mechanisms may limit immune detection during acute infection and latency. Moreover, the results suggest that IE-specific Tc. if present, would have limited efficacy in providing protective immunity. . This phenomenon is due in part to the presence of the K3L and E3L ORFs. The K3L ORF has homology with elF-2a and is believed to protect this molecule from inactivation by IFN-induced PJeIF-2 kinase. ORF E3L encodes a double-stranded RNA-binding protein that inhibiu the activation of the P,/eIF-2 kinase. This resistance to the IFN effects mediated by these two genes is not absolute, since replication of both viruses in fibroblast cells is partially sensitive to higher concenualions of IFN-P but not IFN-a or IFN-y. In sharp contrast, EV and VV replication In a macrophage line is highly sensitive to IFN-y, only partially sensitive to IFN-a but completely insensitive to IFN-P. These findings suggest (i) the K3L and E3L gene products cannot overcome the 1FN-y-induced antiviral effects in macrophages and, (ii) the antiviral effects of IFN-1 may be medialed via a different mechanism than the P,/elF-2 kinase or 2, 5-oligo A synthetase. These possibilities have been investigated and the in viuo and in vivo (mouse) relevance of our findings will be presented. We have previously demonstrated that tolerance induced via the i.v. injection of syngeneic splenocytes coupled with intact, UV-inactlvated Theilefs murine encephalomyelitis virus virions (TMEV-SP) using ethylenecarbodiimide (ECDI) results in 'split tolerance.' Both TMEV-specific delayed type hypersensitivity (DTH) responses and anti-TMEV lgG2a levels were inhib~ted, whereas anti-TMEV lgGl levels were greatly increased (by 20-100 fold) when compared to sham-tolerized controls. We now demonstrate that i.v. TMEV-SP-induced tolerance resub in a dosedependent decrease of virusspecific T cell proliferation, and reduced IL-2 and IFNy production. Additionally, tolerance induction results in the highly significant downregulation of Thlderived 11-2. IFN-y, and LTTTNF-P mRNA expression in response to in vitm stimulation with UV-inactivated virus as determined by a sensitive RT-PCR assay. In contrast. no change was observed in expression of ThZdenved IL-4 and 116 mRNA levels. A time course study confirmed that Thl-specific mRNA expression could not be detected up lo 48 h after in vitm stimulation with virus. Tolerance induction appears to function directly at the level of CD4' Thl cells since depletion of CD8+ T cells had no effect on the inhibition of expression of Thl-specific lymphokine mRNA levels. The mechanism of in vivo tolerance of Thl cells appears to be anergy induction because IL-2.

We have used lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus (LCMV) to study cytolyiic T lymphocyte (CTL) activation and memory. LCMV induces a potent CD8' CTL response in adult mice and the infection resolves within two weeks. We have quantitated the virus-specific CTL response using limiting dilution assays, and T cell activation using the CD44 (Pgp-1) marker. The frequency of LCMV-specific CTL increases both in the spleen and blood from cl/105 at day 0 to -1/50 at day 8, the peak of the primary CTL response. During this period, the entire CD8' subset expands polyclonally. Virus-specific CTL comprise a minor fraction (5%) of the amplified CDB' population. All of the expanded CD8'T cells are activated (CD44\"), and, consistent with a polyclonal response, display broad TcR VO usage. After day 8, there is a sharp decline in total CD8' cells and virus-specific CTL (98% loss). These cells are refractory to anti-CD3 stimulation and display DNA fragmentation and in uiuo cell damage characteristic of apoptosis. This primary CTL population (day 8) is also unable to eliminate a chronic infection which requires prolonged survival of the T cells. This period of anergy marks a transition to the development of memory CTL. By day 30, LCMV-specific CTL drop to about 1/1000 in the blood and spleen, and then persist at this frequency for the life span of the mouse. They maintain the CD44h' activation/ memory phenotype, and, in contrast to the primary CTL population, can eliminate virus when transferred into LCMVcarrier mice. These CTL can also persist long-term in an antigenfree environment. Sorted, virus-specific CTL that are free of any detectable viral genetic material (PCR negative) have been recovered at all timepoints tested (up to 1 year), with little loss in cell number, after transfer into normal, uninfected recipients. Taken together, these findings suggest that memory T cells that are not dependent upon continuous stimulation by antigen, and are qualitatively different from primary CTL, develop in this system. ",

In contrast to this the variability within an individual is much higher 1 1 . 2 -3 . 5 % ) . 50-80% of the clones differ from the individual consensus sequence confirning the quasispecies nature of HTLV I. The finding that 70% of the mutations lead to coding changes indicates that strong selection forces are acting 3n the TAX protein. We assume that one of these night be pressure exerted by CTL, because we could demonstrate that an individual mounts a strong ITL response to multlple epitopes on the TAX prorein simultaneously. We have started a longit,J?inal study concentrating or. a previously described HLA-A2 octameric epitope. Two mutations in this epitope lead to failure of CTL recognition of the corresponding peptides. It has been reported that there are heavy functional constraints on the amino acid sequence of the TAX proteln. Whether these putative CTL escape mutations influence the transactivational activity of the TAX protein remains to tested. Treatment of infected cells with a polyclonal rabbit antimeasles antibody downregulated synthesis of individual measles proteins and reduced the amount of live virus detectable in plaque assays. Antibody treatment led to cell lysis in the presence of complement but, in the absence of an intact complement system, no lysis was observed. With or without complement, measles virus protein synthesis and measles virus infective particles were reduced after antibody treatment. Therefore, anti-measles antibody induces a reduction in synthesis of measles proteins and live virus by mechanisms other than lytic destruction of cells. Poxllruses have recently been shown to encode genes with homologies to cytokine receptors and genes whose loss is associated uith attenuation of the virus in dvo, although the functional significance and mode of action of these genes in vim is poorly understood. Cowpox virus encodes a 38K gene that has previously been shown to inhibit the generation of an inflammatory response upon infection of the chorioallantoic membrane of the 12-day old chick embryo (Krolop. 1989. 172:262) . The wild-type CPV-BRinduced lesion is flat and red, while lacking the 38K gene the lesion is raised and white due to the massive inflammatory cell influx into the site of virus infection. Other poxviruses, however, often give intermediate pock morphologies though they possess a functional 3SK gene. as detected by inhibition of 14(R),lS(S)-diHETE formation. Together, these observations suggest that CPV-BR possesses a full complement of anti-inflammatory genes for the chick embryo model, while other orthopoxviruses lack a functional gene(s) involved in the inhibition of the generation of an inflammatory response at the site of virus infection. A detailed examination of the lesions induced by other orthopoxviruses indicated that there was an inflammatory response, although there were qualitative differences from the response generated by CPV-BR.Dl which lacks the 38K gene. Analysis of different CPV-BR mutants indicates that there are a minimum of at least four genes encoded by CPV-BR that are nonessential for virus replication in tissue culture, but are involved in inhibiting the generation of an inflammatory response at the site of virus infection. Persistent viruses have developed a repertoire of strategies to evade the host immune response. The induction of peripheral tolerance appears to be the strategy employed by Lactate Dehydrogenase-elevaang Virus (LDV), which infects a subpopulation of macrophages and causes a lifelong asymptomatic infecnon in mice. Even though anu-LDV antibodies are produced, the virus appears indifferent to the host immune response, since the virus is not cleared from the circulanon, and the course of infection is unaltered in immunosuppressed mice. One central feature of infection IS an early state of in vivo T cell suppression followed by the continuous polyclonal activatio of B cells and production of IgG2a and IgG2b antibodies. The purpose of these experiments was to study the polyclonal activation of B cells and the nature of T cell suppression by examining mitogen-stirnulated proliferation, lymphokine production, and antibody synthesis in spleen cultures obtamed from mice at different times pi.. The most significant changes in T cell responses occurred during the first week p i . Decreases in proliferation, IL-2, and IL-2 receptor expression were observed in cultures stimulated with Con A, or the anti-CD3 antibody, 2C11. The Addition of IL-2 failed to recover the proliferative response to Con A. In contrast, Con-A stimulated cultures showed increased gamma-IFN when measured by either ELISA of gamma-IFN protein or by Northern analysis of gamma-IFN mRNA. IL-3 producnon was also increased, even in the absence of Con A. Decreased proliferanon in response to LPS and increased production of IgG2a and -2b in spleen cultures were also observed. The magnitude and pattern of B and T cell responses suggest that both B and T cells are polyclonally activated during the acute stage of infection. B cells are stimulated to proliferate and produce antibody, whereas T cells, when snmulated, do not produce IL-2, fail to proliferate, and may become anergic. Acute viral infections in mice and humans induce a nansient immune deficiency reflected by loss in responsiveness of lymphocvtes to mitogens. The acute infection of mice with lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus (LCMV) results in an antiviral cytotoxic T lymphocyte response peaking at day 7-9 post-infection, coincident with which is the non-responsiveness of lymphocytes to mitogen. We show here that crosslinking of the TcWCD3 complex on T-cells from acutely LCMV-infected mice causes these cells to rapidly die by apoptosis (programmed cell death), This TcR-induced death was not inhlbitable by exogenous interleukin-2 (IL-2). but was blocked by cyclosponn A. IL-2, in the absence of TcR-stimulation, enabled these cells to cycle without appreciable apoptosis above background. These results suggest that T-lymphocytes stimulated during LCMV infection become poised to undergo apoptosis upon TcR-crosslinking, and implicate apoptosis in the T-cell compartment as a possible mechanism for the silencing of the immune response to infection.",

Thus, IL-2-dependent cell cycling predisposes T-cells for apoptosis upon TcR-signalling, and the exposure of memory T-cells in vivo to L -2 induced during the antiviral immune response may prime them to subsequently die upon antigenic stimulation, thereby providing an explanation for the longstanding observation of antigen-specific immune suppression during acute virus infection. The Z protein is produced early in the virus life cycle from a subgenomic mRNA that is encapsidated within the virion. This is the first demonstration of a packaged early mRNA in the Negative-Strand RNA viruses. We have also been able to show that the Z protein is both a structural protein of the virus, and an essential component during transcription of viral RNA. Monoclonal antibodies to the 2 protein inhibit transcription of LCMV-specific RNA in an in vitro transcription system. We have previously shown that biologically active transforming growth factor4 (TGF-B) is produced during LCMV infection of euthymic mice and that NK cell proliferation is at least 100-fold more sensitive than T cell proliferation to T G F -B -M t e d inhibition. The experiments presented here were undertaken to a s t s s the contribution of the adaptive immune response t o production of biologically active factor. Immunohistochemical studies were carried out to examine in vivo production of TGF-B protein. Detectable protein expression was induced in euthymic, athymic ndnu, and SCID spleens during infection. The Mv 1 Lu biological assay was used to evaluate active TGF-B production in media conditioned with splenic leukocytes isolated from infected mice. Cells from athymic or SCID mice produced less inhibitory activity than those isolated from euthymic mice. Furthermore, inhibitory factor production was of shorter duration. Administration of cyclosporin A (CsA) inhibited T cell activation and reduced inhibitory factor production in euthymic C 3 W e N and BALB/c nu/+ mice at late times post-infection. These changes were accompanied by an enhanced NK cell response. Adminisuation of CsA did not enhance NK cell activity in athymic nulnu mice. Production of latent TGF-B was evaluated by transient acid treatment to release the active form of TGF-B. Euthymic, athymic, and SCID leukocytes all produced substantial amounts of latent factor in conditioned media. The presence of T and B cells was required for peak latent factor production at late times post-infection. The factor was shown to be TGF-I31 by use of anti-TGF-B1 neutralizing antibodies. Taken together, these data demonstrate that T and B cells can conmbute to the decline in NK cell activity by facilitating production of latent and biologically active TGF-B. Furthermore. the results help to explain observations of increased and prolonged NK cell activity in athytnic and SCID as compared to euthymic mice. cells were examined and found to contain a 33 kd protein capable of binding murine interleukin-lp (rnlL-IP). A VV open reading frame (ORF) that exhibits 30% amino acid identity to the type II IL-1 receptor was expressed in CVl/EBNA cells and shown specifically to bind mlL-1p. A recombinant VV was constructed in which this ORF was disrupted (vB15RKO). Supernatants from vB15RKO-infected cells did not contain a n IL-1 -binding protein. Supernatants from VV-infected CV-1 cells were capable of inhibiting IL-1 -induced murine lymphocyte proliferation in vitro while supernatants from vB15RKO infected cells did not. lntracranial inoculation of mice with vB15RKO suggests that this ORF is involved in VV virulence. The possible role of this protein, as well as other candidate immunomodulators in vaccinia virus will b e discussed. We have examined the biology of the human adenovims (Ad) early region 3 (E3) glycoprotein 19K (gpl9K) which has k e n shown to inhibit cytotoxic T lymphocyte (CIZ) recognition of Ad-infected target cells. The glycoprotein binds major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I molecules and inhibits their uanspon to the cell surface. The gpl9K-MHC class I binding is non-covalent. and does not require the MHC class 1associated p-2 micmglobulin protein, or other Ad proteins. The lumenal domain of gpl9K has been shown to bind the =1 and =2 domains of the mouse MHC class I, however the regions of gpl9K which bind the class I molecule have not been investigated. Using a panel of gpl9K deletion mutants, we have examined the amino acid region(s) involved in binding the MHC class I molecules. and have extended this relationship to CTL recognition of Ad E3-gp19K deletion mutant infected target cells. The data reveal that any deletion to the lumenal portion of the gpl9K protein abolishes its ability to retain MHC class I in the endoplmic reticulum of infected cells thus allowing for CIZ recognition and lysis of infected target cells. Moreover, examination of newly synthesized gpl9Kclass I proteins and their relationship to CIZ recognition and cytolysis revealed that maximal gpl9K protein accumulation occurs 16-20 h. post-infedon in mouse cells and that this accumulation directly correlates with maximal inhibition of CTL recognition and cytolysis. However, after 20-24 h. postinfection, ina;lceIlular levels of gpl9K decrease, thereby allowing for increased CIZ recognition. The addition of yIM to Ad-infected target cells was suffcient to w e m m e the effect of gpl9K, allowing for increased class I expression at the cell surface and resultant cytolysis. Since the adult liver is an organ without constitutive lymphoid components, any intrahepatic T-cell found in viral hepatitis should have migrated to the liver after infection and inflammation. Therefore, information on frequency and function of liver T-cells may be relevant to the understanding of the pathogenesis of chronic hepatitis. We studied intrahepatic CD4' T-cells from patients with chronic hepatitis C, and compared them to T-cells present in PBMC. We used six recombinant proteins (Core, 21, E2, NS3, NS4, NS5) of HCV to establish T-cell lines and clones from liver biopsies and PBMC. We found that only the protein NS4 was able to stimulate CD4+ T-cells isolated from biopsies, whereas with all the other HCV proteins we failed to establish liver-derived T-cell lines. To study compartmentalisation, NS4-specific T-cell clones from PBMC and liver of the same patient were compared for MHC restriction, fine specificity, lymphokine production, B-cell help ability and TCR V-region. The 22 PBMC-derived T-cell clones represent six distinct clonal populations that differ in the TCR V-region gene usage, whereas the 27 liver-derived T-cell clones appear all identical in the N-regions. Remarkably, none of the PBMC clones i s identical to t h e liver-derived clone, demonstrating that this clone is compartmentalised to the liver. Altogether our results demonstrate that the protein NS4 is highly immunogenic for intrahepatic CD4+ T-cells primed by HCV in uivo, and that some CD4+ T-cells bearing a given TCR and with a peculiar ability to help IgA production by B-cells are compartmentalised to the liver. Studies are in progress to investigate the dynamics of intrahepatic T-cells in the course of disease and their appearance as memory cells in the PBMC. Human parainfluenza virus type 1 (hPIV-1). an infection associated with respiratory tract disease in infants. has been targeted for the development of a childhood vaccine. Previously, we have described that adults, naturally immune to the virus, have high levels of circulating hPIV-1-specific memory cytotoxic T cells which recognize the viral nucleoprotein. Further studies on the immunogenic potential of this protein for inducing protective cellular immunity within the respiratory tract require a model system. We have therefore investigated the ability of mice to generate CD8+ T cells to hPIV-1.",

Previous studies have shown that this organ-specific selection correlates with a single amino-acid change at position 260 of the viral glycoprotein. This phenylalanine (F) to leucine (L) change is seen in the lymphoid tissue of persistently infected mice. Isolates with the parental sequence (F at residue 260) predominate in the CNS. In this study, we asked whether the organ-specific selection of the F to L change is immune-mediated. To address this issue, we examined the selection of viral variants in mice with severe-combined immunodeficiency (SCID). SClD mice were infected with the parental strain of LCMV. Viral isolates from the CNS and spleens of these persistently infected mice were analyzed for the presence of the F to L change. Fifteen days post-infection. both CNS and splenic isolates had the parental genotype. However, by ninety days post-infection, the majority of the splenic isolates displayed the F to L change, while the majority of the CNS isolates expressed the parental genotype. Since SClD mice lack functional T or B cells, these results show that the host immune system is not involved in the organ-specific selection of LCMV variants with the F to L change. While the selective pressures involved in the emergence of these organ-specific variants are not fully understood, this study demonstrates that such changes may occur independently of the host immune system.

These cells can be stimulated in vitro by HBenvAg to generate CD4+ T cell clones, that retain the same phenotype and have a Thl -like profile. By contrast, clones with these features represent a minority of the clones generated by HBenvAg from PBL of healthy vaccinated individuals: they comprised clones with an heterogeneous profile of cytokine secretion (either Thl or Th2 or Tho). A group of them recognized HBenvAg peptide (193) (194) (195) (196) (197) (198) (199) (200) (201) (202) (203) (204) (205) (206) (207) in the context of the HLA allele DR2w15 by the same standard as liver-Thl-like clones. Together, these data suggest that the selective promotion of Thl-like or Th2-like response to HBenvAg seems not to be influenced by the nature of peptide or MHC haplotype but by liver microenvironment during inflammatory processes. These CD4+ CD56+ T cell clones displayed a strong cytotoxic activity and in an higher extent than their counterparts CD56-. The demonstration that freshly isolated CD4+ T cells infiltrating tissue with inflammatory processes, but not those derived from PBL, displayed cytotoxic activity and perforins strongly indicate that they may be cytotoxic in vivo and are generated in situ of severe immunopathologic responses. The priming by the whole virus presented by tissue-APC in the presence of inflammatory cytokines within the liver environment, which is the privileged site of infection, may facilitate the induction of cytotoxic CD4+ T lymphocyte with Thl-like profile.

In resistant mice, the virus never reaches the white matter and is cleared from the grey matter by the immune response. The use of backcross mice, and the screening of the entire mouse genome with microsatellite markers allowed us to identify three loci responsible for susceptibility/resistanw to persistent infection. One is H-2D and another one is Ifg. On the other hand, infecting D2m-1mice proved that CTL play a major role in clearing the virus from the CNS of genetically resistant mice. Furthermore, viral chimera obtained in the laboratory, and which are unable to migrate from the grey to the white matter, proved to be extremely useful in dissecting the role of CTL in the clearance of Theiler's virus from various grey matter cell types. From these studies, a coherent picture of the interaction of host and viral genes to determine the fate of Theiler's virus infection of CNS is emerging. Acute infection of Balb/c mice by the Armshong strain of lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus (LCMVj readily induces an MHC class I restricted, virus spedfic CTL response; paradoxically there is also a transient defect induced in the general T-cell population. Spleen and lymph node cells harvested from infected mice display a dramatic loss of in vitro proliferative response to the mitogen concanavalin A (ConA). Data is presented showing that this loss of function does not occur with in m'tro infection of splenocytes, requires viral replication and is dose dependent. On day seven of acute infection, when the loss of function is most pronounced, the defect segregates with the T-cells of the infected animals. When stimulated, these cells produce much less IL-2 than normal cells. Splenocytes from infected mice are responsive to IL-2 alone, but much less so to the combination of IL-2 plus ConA, suggesting that T-cell receptor engagement is a negative signal in these cells. Cells from infected and uninfected mice respond equivalently to phorbol ester and ionomycin. These data are consistent with the nonresponsive T-cells having been rendered anergic. Anergy resulk from presentation of antigen to T-cells in the absence of a second signal, termed costimulation. In situ hybridization reveals that a significant percentage of macrophages and dendritic cells isolated on the third day of infection are positive for LCMV sequences. We hypothesize that infection of antigen presenting cells may compromise their ability to provide costimulation, resulting in the induction of anergy in the majority of T-cells in the infected animals. HLA class I restricted cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTL) are a major defense mechanism in viral infections. CTL mediated lysis of virus infected host cells may lead to clearance of the virus or if incomplete to viral persistence and eventually chronic tissue injury. Viral persistence and immunologically mediated liver injury are thought to be important mechanisms leading to chronic hepatitis after infection with HCV. In order to assess the role of CTL in HCV infection we used the following experimental strategy: peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) of patients with chronic hepatitis C, having the HLA class I allele A2, were stimulated with HCV-derived peptides containing the HLA-A2 binding motif XLXXXXXXV. After two weeks of stimulation effector cells thus generated were tested for their capacity to lyse HLA-A2 matched peptide sensitized target cells in a 4-hour 51Chromium release assay.",

MCMV infection inhibits presentation of antigens to antigen-specific, MHC Class I-restricted CTL. This is accompanied by a significant decrease in surface expression of H-2Kb and H-2Db. We therefore examined the effects of MCMV infection on the intracellular expression of H-2Kb and H-2Db using immunoprecipitation. Two major effects of virus infection were seen: 1) MCMV inhibited maturation of H-2K and H-2D heavy chains to the complex glycosylated forms. This suggests that MCMV infection interferes with transport of the molecules from the endoplasmic reticulum through the Golgi. 2) While there was a minimal reduction in the quantity of H-2D. H-2K expression was significantly reduced, suggesting that H-2K synthesis is selectively downregulated by virus infection. These two effects on MHC expression were mediated by an MCMV early gene product, as cells were infected in the presence of phosphonoacetic acid which inhibits DNA replication. Gamma interferon was unable to fully reverse the effects of MCMV on MHC transport and synthesis. The MCMV early gene product(s) did not act through beta-2 microglobulin (P2m), as similar effects on H-2K and H-2D were seen in MCMV-infected, P2m-deficient cells. Current studies aim to assess the molecular mechanisms of the differential regulation of these two Class I molecules by MCMV. Virus first replicated to high titer in the lymphoid orzans and the reticuloendothelial system, producing a marked viremia. The lymphoid phase of the disease ended by 120 hours post inoculation (pi), with clearance from all organs and serum. A second central nervous system (CNS) phase of viral replication began in the brain approximately 48 hours pi, and continued until the death of the mouse. The route of entry of alphaviruses into the CNS is unknown. Several hypotheses exist, including transport of virus across endothelial cells in brain capillaries, direct neural spread from the peripheral nervous system, or macrophage/lymphocyte mediated spread. We have investigated the mechanism by which VEE gains access to the CNS using in situ hybridization and quantitative plaque assay. At 36 houzs pi virus was detectable in the sensory neurons of the olfactory neuroepitheliurn and in the vomeronasal organ, as well as in the main and accessory olfactory bulbs. By 48 hours pi virus was demonstrable in the lateral olfactory tracts, pyriform areas, and the entorhinal cortex of the brain. At later time points virus was disseminated throughout the brain. These observations are consistent with the hypothesis that viral CNS invasion begins with hematogenous seeding of the olfactory neuroepitheliurn during the viremic lymphoid phase of the infection.",

The speed with which VEE can enter the CNS from this route may be important in the course of infection, as rapid clearance from the periphery may prevent the establishment of productive CNS infection at later times post infection. Pathogenesis of Venezuelan equine encephalitis virus (VEE) in mice can be described as a sequence of steps which ends in death of the infected host. Distinct viral functions may be critical at each sequential step. Attenuated VEE mutants should be blocked at, and therefore define, different pathogenetic steps in tbe disease process. Single-site attenuated VEE mutants were generated by site-directed mutagenesis and differed from cloned virulent wild-type VEE at either E2 glycoprotein position 76 (lys for glu) or 209 (lys for glu). Wild-type VEE caused 100% mortality after footpad (fp) or intracerebral (ic) inoculation of mice. The E2 76 mutant was avirulent by both routes. Mutant E2 209 was avirulent by fp inoculation (0% mortality), but caused 89% mortality when inoculated ic. Both mutants induced a solid protective response to intraperitoneal challenge with wild-type VEE. The spread of wild-type and mutant virus was monitored by titration of tissue homogenates, immunocytochemistry, in situ hybridization, and histopathology. Following fp inoculation, wild-type VEE replicated at the injection site, spread to the draining lymph node within 4 hrs, to semm within 12 hrs, and to other lymphoid organs within 18 hrs post-inoculation. In contrast, the single-site mutant, E2 76, was blocked at the site of inoculation. Although sporadic spread beyond the footpad was observed, none of the 17 virus strains recovered from other organs was restricted to the footpad. All of the recovered viruses contained genotypic alterations. The spread of mutant E2 209 appeared similar to wild-type except that it was severely restricted in reaching the serum (in only 2 of 22 mice) and the brain (in 1 of 22 mice) following fp inoculation. Recovered viruses from these 3 animals are being analyzed for genotype and phenotype. The E2 209 mutation appeared to restrict the production of viremia and subsequent access of the virus to the brain. Consistent with this hypothesis, intravenous inoculation of E2 209 resulted in significantly increased virulence (33% mortality). We have studied the in vivo depletion of CD4+ and or CD8+ T-cell populations with rat monoclonal antibodies. Depletion of CD4+ cells, abrogated virus-specific IgG production resulting in elevated brain virus titres, delayed clearance of brain virus and increased demyelination. Depletion of CD8+ cells affected neither antibody production nor brain virus titres, but greatly reduced the incidence of demyelination. Animals depleted of both T-cell subpopulations produced no virus specific IgG, had persistent CNS infections with minimal cytopathicity and no lesions of demyelination. In conclusion, clearance of Semliki Forest virus from the CNS requires CD4+ T-cells. Lesions of demyelination are mediated by CD8+ T-cells. Center, Philadelphia, PA 19104. We have recently described two different attenuated reassortant clones of California serogroup bunyaviruses, both of which exhibit reduced neuroinvasiveness upon peripheral inoculation into suckling mice Clone B1 .la bears an attenuated middle RNA segment (neuroinvasiveness genotype vav) and clone B.5 bears an attenuated large RNA segment (genotype avv) A complete panel of reassortants was constructed between these two clones, and tested for their neuroinvasiveness (as measured by the loglo PFU/LDso ratio) in suckling mice. It was found that clones with the neuroinvasive large and middle RNA segments (genotype VVV) were much more neuroinvasive (up to 10,000-fold) than either parent clone, whereas clones bearing both attenuated large and middle FWA segments (genotype aav) were more attenuated (10 to 100-fold) than either parent clone. Furthermore, pathogenesis studies which followed replication of virus after inoculation by (i) tissue titration for virus, and (ii) immunofluorescence labeling for viral antigen showed that the highly neuroinvasive clones replicated in peripheral tissue (striated muscle) to high titers, produced an active plasma viremia and invaded the brain within 3 days At a high input of lo6 PFU/animal, clones with one or both attenuated segments failed to replicate to a significant amount in peripheral tissue, produced only a minimal passive plasma viremia during the first 24 hours, but nevertheless reached high titers in the brain and killed animals within 4 days. In view of these results, we also investigated the possibility that virus was reaching the central nervous system via neural pathways Footpad inoculations of clone Bl.la at a moderate dose of 200 PN/animal was preceded by sciatic nerve transsection or mock surgery. There were no differences in lethality, indicating that the sciatic nerve does not play a role in neuroinvasion following footpad inowlation Thus the low level viremia is likely to be sufficient for penetration of the blood brain barrier Human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) is associated with significant morbidity and mortality in immunocompromised hosts. The whole HCMV genome has k e n sequenced but the specific proteins which mediate the T cell response to HCMV are only partially delineated. We have studied the CD4 T cell response to selected HCMV proteins which have been shown to be immunologically relevant. The proteins that we selected include the two immediate early proteins (IEI and IE2). gB, pp71 and MHC class I homolog (H301). In order to prepare pure preparations of these proteins, the maltose binding protein (MBP) fusion protein system was used. HCMV DNA fragments encoding th'ese five proteins were each subcloned into the pMal-c vector and the fusion proteins were obtained by IPTG induction, and purified by passage over an amylose column. Using these purified proteins we have studied the T cell proliferative responses to HCMV proteins in 3 1 seropositive and 7 seronegative individuals. The whole HCMV was used as positive control and the MBP as negative control. Responses were considered to be positive when the stimulation index (test divided by negative control) exceeded 3.0. In an attempt to correlate these responses with the HLA type of each individual we have carried out DNA typing for HLA-DR on all individuals. Results showed that all of the fusion proteins were successfully made as determined by sequence analysis and could stimulate proliferative responses. None of the 7 seronegative individuals showed significant responses. For the 3 I seropositive individuals, 10 of them responded to all five proteins, 11 responded to one to three proteins and 10 individuals responded to none of the proteins. The most commonly recognized proteins were the structural proteins: gB (16/31, 52%) and pp71 (16/31. 52%). The IEI and IE2 were recognized by 11/31 (35% ) and 13/31 (40%). respectively.

MI 490014 Conformational changes in the structure of the Sindbis virus (SB) glycoprotein spike were detected at the cell surface during entry. After attachment to baby hamster kidney cells at 4'C and during subsequent incubation of virus-cell complexes at 3 7 T , the constellation of glvcoprotein epitopes accessible to their cognate monoclonal antibodies (MAbs) was altered. Epitopes accessible to MAb on virus-cell complexes, but not accessible on native virions, were termed transitional epitopes. Exposure of the transitional epitopes occurred normally in the presence of NH4CI and at both permissive and nonpermissive temperatures in a Chinese hamster ovary cell line temperature-sensitive for endosomal acidification. When native virions in suspension were heated to 51\u00b0C for 5 min, many of the transitional epitopes became accessible, mimicking the cell surface conformational change. Because such virions remained infectious, the transitional epitopes were mapped by selecting and sequencing neutralization escape mutants. An E2 transitional epitope was mapped to E2 residues 200-202, a region beween two of the major neutralizing antigenic sites of SB and near a putative site for receptor binding. A subset of the E l transitional epitope MAbs were broadly cross-reactive among several alphaviruses. One of these mapped to E l 61 within a conserved domain. Using site-directed mutants, another such epitope was mapped to E l 81-95, the conserved, hydrophobic domain thought to be the alphavirus fusogenic peptide. These results suggest that the E l 81-95 domain may be exposed at the cell surface after rearrangement of the glycoprotein spike but prior to entry. Infection of mice with mouse hepatitis virus (MHV) causes a spectrum of diseases, ranging from acute hepatitis in the liver to acute encephalitis and chronic demyelination in the cental nervous system. A variety of mechanisms have been implicated in controlling MHV infections, which include the activity of macrophages, natural killer cells and lymphocytes. Because the role of cytotoxic T cells in this virus model is p r l y understood, we are. trying to generate MHV specific a ' s and determine their fine specificity and their biological activity in the protection against a lethal virus infection as well as their possible role in the establishment of chronic demyelination. Because the efficiency of MHV-A59 infection of syngeneic target cell lines was very low, we transfected EL4 cells with the receptor for MHV-A59. Transfectants show high expression of MHV-A59 and were used as targets in cytotoxicity assays, however no MHV-A59 specific CTL activity could be measured. Based on these results we measured the MHC class I expression on the infected target cells and observed a downregulation of the MHC class I molecules. Further studies on this finding are currently under investigation. Altematively, we selected peptides from the structural proteins of MHV-A59 based on the recently reported Kb and Db binding motifs of Rammensee at al. We analysed these peptides for binding to MHC class I molecules and tested them for CI' L recognition, and we used them in vaccination studies. restricted cytotoxicitytowards HSV-infected t a r g e t LCL.

Despite this apparent immune deficiency, these mice do not show an increased susceptibility to several viral pathogens. Lethal choriomeningitis after inhacranial infection with lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus (LCMV) in normal mice is mediated by CD8+ cytotoxic T lymphocytes. We previously showed that these 02m -/mice, despite the deficiency of CD8+ cells. are susceptible to this immunopathologic process. However, the time from inuacranial infection till death was increased in 02m -/mice, and all normal animals died while 02m 4mice showed only a 75% mortality. We also showed that these 02m -/mice show specific, anti-LCMV cytotoxic activity which is mediated by CD4+, class 11 MHC-restricted T cells (Muller et al., Science 255:1576 Science 255: , 1992 .",

            "text": "Transfer of protein-specific T cells into naive RS virus-infected mice therefore reproduces the patterns of enhanced pathology seen in mice sensitised to individual RS virus proteins. T cells appear to be the main cause of pathology in this model of lung disease. Viruses can cause neuronal injury by three distinct paths. Viruses such as herpes simplex and polio infect and replicate in neurons of the central nervous system (CNS). causing direct lytic injury. Other viruses, like human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), cause neuronal dysfunction indirectly; i.e., without the virus infecting neurons. Finally, viruses such as lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus (LCMV) can alter neuronal function without direct lysis by establishing persistence in neurons. In this instance, although LCMV actively replicates in neurons without causing cell death, significant alterations in neurotransmitter RNA levels are detected. For LCMV or any noncytolytic virus to establish persistence, it must also perfect strategies to evade host immune recognition. Neurons are deficient in the expression of the major histocompatibility molecules (MHC) necessary for immune recognition, while other CNS cells (astrocytes, oligodendrocytes) express little or no MHC, indicating that these cells can serve as a harbor for non-cytolytic viruses. In order to understand the principles by which viruses can persist in CNS cells, we have developed transgenic mice that express MHC genes in cells of the CNS using cell-specific promoters. Here we report successful expression of a MHC class I molecule (murine Db) in neurons. It has been shown that transfection of a neuronal cell culture system with the Db gene allows MHC class I heavy chain expression and permits CTL to lyse virally infected neurons. Using the neuron-specific enolase (NSE) promoter, the MHC class I molecule Db was ex ressed in neurons of transgenic mice and the spliced transgene-derived Ds mRNA was detected by RNA PCR in brains of transgenic mice. Protein expression was shown by attachment of hippocampal neurons from transgenic mice on cover slips coated with a conformation-dependent monoclonal antibody directed against the Db molecule. Neuronal expression of MHC class I glycoprotein was not detrimental since uninfected transgenic mice housed in microisolator cages for as long as 1 year have neither clinical disorders nor an enhanced death rate when compared to non-transgenic littermates. In preliminary studies, when such Db-expressing neurons are persistently infected with LCMV m, activated (7n given peripherally (intra-peritoneally) home to the CNS and cause disease. Other transgenic lines have been created in which the LCMV-NP is expressed in neurons using the NSE promoter. Studies with these mice as to neurotransmitter defects and of doubly transgenic mice that express both Db and LCMV-NP in neurons are in progress. Mice lacking &-microglobulin (&m-) are deficient in MHC class I expression and. consequently, are deficient in mature CD8+ T cells. In normal mice, death following intracranial infection with lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus (LCMV) results from CD8+T cell mediated attack on virally infected cells in the brain. We have previously shown that. despite their deficiency in CDB+T cells, P2m-mice also die following intracranial infection with LCMV, albeit several days later than normal mice. We also described the induction of LCMV-specific, class 11-restricted cytotoxic T cells (CTL) in P2m-mice. We now show that, in accord with the delayed onset of meningitis, the kinetics of induction of CTL activity in these mice differs from that seen in normal mice. In control mice, maximum CTL activity is seen at 7 days postinfection, whereas in P2m-mice maximum Cn, activity is not reached until 9-10 days post-infection. In addition, the LCMV specific CTL in P2m-mice are able to kill target cells that have been incubated with inactivated virus. Treatment of the target cells with chloroquine pi-cvents killing, suggesting that the \"exogenous\" antigen presentation pathway is responsible for processing and presentation of LCMV to thcsc class 11-restricted CTL in vitro. This is consistent with the hypothesis that endocytosis and subsequent presentation of shed virus particles during LCMV infection in viuo is responsible for the induction ol'specific class 11-restricted CTL in P2m-mice. This mechanism may explain the delayed onset of CTL activity and meningitis following LCMV infection. We have also observed that viral induction of natural killer cell activity is similarly delayed. This might suggest a more fundamental defect in the elaboration of the cytotoxic response in 8211micc. Borna disease virus (BDV), a noncytopathic single-stranded RNA virus, causes a p e r s i s t e n t infection with meningoencephalitis in a wide range of naturally and experimentally infected animals. In our experimental model, t h e Lewis rat, BDV produces a biphasic disorder characterized by aggression and hyperactivity followed by listlessness and blindness. Both, meningoencephalitis and disease could be prevented by treatment of infected rats with immunosuppressive drugs, indicating that Borna d i s e a s e (BD) is caused by an immunopathological mechanism. Drug-induced tolerance could b e overcome by adoptive transfer of spleen-or lymph node cells from acutely infected, syngeneic adult rats or injection of syngeneic. BDVantigen specific CD4+ T cells (NMI) . In addition, transfer of the CD4+. BDV-specific NMI cells before BDV-infection resulted in reduced virus titers in the central nervous system and protection against fatal BD. However, all protected animals developed a meningoencephalitis similar to the virus-infected control animals. Inoculation of control CD4+ T cells or inactivated NM 1 T cells failed to protect against clinical disease. These findings indicate that both protection against and induction of BD are mediated by BDV-specific CD4+ T cells, depending on time of transfer. Since only viable CD4+ T cells are able to induce both effects, the underlying mechanism is daferent from that of various CD4+ T cell-mediated autoimmune diseases. One of the pathways by which physiological responses to stressors are mediated is the HPA axis which, ultimately, results in secretion of glucocorticoids (GC) by the adrenal gland. Antiinflammatory and immunosuppressive properties of GC have been demonstrated. Experimental influenza viral infection has been shown to elevate plasma GC (Dunn et al., 1989) , a response suggesting that infection may be perceived as a \"stressor\" and that GC is part of the neuroimmune communication that occurs during infection. This interaction may provide a means to limit the magnitude of the response and reduce immunopathology. The purpose of this study was to confirm activation of the HPA axis during infection of C57BLl6 mice with influenza virus A/PRI and to investigate the role of the GC response in viral pathogenesis. Within 48h of i.n. infection with PR8, mice showed an elevation of plasma GC levels (166 nglml vs <50 nglml baseline). By 7d pi., plasma levels of GC averaged 432 ng/ml and dropped to 100 nglml by 1Od as the infection resolved. Behavioral paradigms, such as restraint (RST), elevate plasma GCs. When these behavioral treatments were imposed during an immune response to viral infection, the GC levels were amplified. Elevated GC levels were associated with reduced cell yields from the mediastinal lymph nodes (1.n.) compared with controllinfected mice. Additionally, inflammation and pathosis in the lungs of PR8-infected mice were diminished in association with RST. To examine the role of GC more specifically, RU486 (GC receptor blocker), was admininstered on a daily basis prior to and post infection with PR8. The cell yields from 1.n. were the same regardless of the behavioral treatment. Thus, blocking GC receptors via RU486 abolished the RST-associated decrease in cell number in the draining lymph node. Gross observations of infected lungs indicated severe congestion and consolidation. These studies indicate that GC may play a critical role in the regulation of the immune response during viral infection. The JHM strain of mouse hepatitis virus is a neurotropic variant that produces a panencephalomyelitis accompanied by primary central nervous system (CNS) demyelination. To determine the role of cytotoxic T cells (CTL) in the reduction of infectious virus and demyelination within the CNS, CTL lines were established from the CNS of Balbic mice undergoing an acute fatal infection with JHMV. Twenty of twenty two lines were able to lyse JHMVinfected syngenic targets. The two remaining lines lysed both JHMV-infected and uninfected targets. Recombinant vaccinia viruses expressing the JHMV structural proteins (designated S, M, HE, and N) were used to determine the viral specificity of the remaining twenty cells lines. Fifteen of the T cell lines were able to specifically recognize only those targets expressing the viral nucleocapsid (N) protein. The remaining five lines recognize JHMV-infected syngenic targets hut were unable to recognize any of the structural proteins, suggesting specificity for a nonstructural protein. Surprisingly, immunizations with recombinant vaccinia expressing the N protein or the N protein CTL epitope were unable to protect mice from a lethal infection or alter the progression of disease. Conversely the adoptive transfer of at least one of the T cell lines specific for the nonstructural protein was able to protect mice from lethal infection and prevent CNS demyelination. These preliminary data suggest that the vigorous CTL response to the N protein found in the CNS of infected mice does not contribute to either viral clearance or reduction of pathological changes. MHC class I and I1 expression was studied by immunohistochemistry and HPV typing was performed by general primer-and type-specific primer mediated PCR (GPITS PCR). Both techniques were performed on paraffin embedded tissue sections.",

            "text": "The results indicate that local differences may exist in the type of cellular immune response to HPV induced lesions. We evaluated genes involved in viral virulence in the absence of lymphocytedependent immunity using severe combined immunodeficient (SCID) mice and reovirus reassortants. Reovirus infection of adult SCID mice resulted in either early (12-20 days) or late (60-90 days) death depending on the reovirus used for infection. Reovirus type 1 Lang (TIL) was most virulent while type 3 Daring (T3D) was least virulent. A panel of 12 T1L x T3D reassortant viruses were used to map the gene segments involved in this virulence phenotype. Four T1L gene segments (S1, LI, MI, and L2) were significantly associated with virulence in SCID mice. Three of the four gene segments (Ll, L2, and MI) are viral core components possibly involved in viral RNA synthesis. The L1 and MI gene products are estimated to be present in 1 copy per viral vertex while pentamers of the L2 gene product form the core spikes at each vertex. The S1 gene segment encodes the viral cell attachment protein as well as a non-structural protein of unknown function. Viral growth and capacity to generate hepatitis were also mapped using reassortants. In addition, reoviruses isolated from SCID mice after prolonged infection showed altered biochemical phenotypes in vitro and prolonged infection resulted in progressive increase in T3D titer in organs initially resistant to viral replication. These results demonstrate the importance of reoviral core proteins in virulence when lymphocyte based immunity is inoperative. Viruses isolated from chronically infected mice may provide interesting models for study of tissue tropism during chronic infection and molecular details of mutations occurring in the absence of lymphocytedependent selective pressures in vivo. as adults are resistant to tumor induction by the virus. We investigated the role of natural killer (NK) cells in the resistance of mice to polyomavirus using BALBK or C57BU6 scid mice, which lack T and B cells. The pathogenesis of polyomavirus infection was examined in untreated mice and in mice depleted of NK cell activity by mAb to NK1.l or by antiserum to asialo GMI. Infection of scid mice with 2xId-2x106PFU polyomavirus strain A2 intraperitoneally led to the death of 100%(62/62) of the animals between days 12 and 16 postinfection. Pathologic findings included splenomegaly, a large decrease in megakaryocytes and massive erythroblastosis in the spleen and bone marrow, thrombocytopenia, anemia and hemorrhagic lesions in skin. Multiple copies of unintegrated, episomal polyomavirus genome were found in the organs tested (spleen, kidney, liver,lung) at day 7 postinfection, as well as shortly before death. NK cell depletion did not influence the pathogenesis and the time of death, did not increase the polyomavirus titer in the spleen and kidney, and did not significantly change the amount of viral genome detected in DNA samples prepared from organs at day 7 postinfection or prior to death. FACS analysis of spleen cells from dying polyomavirus-infected animals showed high MHC class I and low class I1 antigen expression. Activated NK cells did not kill day 12 polyomavirus-infected spleen cells in vitro, suggesting that the spleen cells, which are mainly proliferating erythroblastoid cells in polyomavirus-infected scid mice are resistant to NK cells. Our results demonstrate that polyomavirus infection in scid mice leads to a very rapid, lethal hematologic disorder, characterized by massive erythroblastoid cell proliferation. This pathology is vastly different from the tumor induction \"profiles\" described in polyomavirusinfected newborn and adult nude mice. Transgenic mice expressing nucleoprotein (NP) or glycoprotein(GP) of lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus (LCMV) under the control of the rat insulin promoter (RIP) in beta cells of the pancreas only develop insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (IDDM) as an autoimmune disease when challenged with LCMV. The resulting pancreatic lymphocellular infiltrate is comprised of both CD4+ and CD8+ cells. Here we report that the presence of CD4+ cells is not required for the development of infiltration or IDDM. Deletion of CD4+ cells was accomplished by homologous recombination (\"gene knockout\") of the Ia (class 11) molecule. Such mice were bred with the RIP-LCMV transgenics to yield progeny that were CD4-and LCMV+. These mice developed IDDM after infection with LCMV with CD8+ infiltrates but without infiltration by CD4+ cells. As demonstrated by PCR technique, RIP-LCMV-NP mice express the viral NP transgene not only in the beta cells of the pancreas, but also in the thymus, whereas RIP-GP mice do express the transgene only in the pancreas. Interestingly, RIP-LCMV-NP mice require 1-3 months to develop IDDM after LCMV challenge. In contrast, RIP-LCMV-GP mice develop IDDM within 10 days after LCMV challenge. RIP-NP and Thy-NP mice (expressing LCMV-NP in the thymus) exhibit a partial unresponsiveness of LCMV-NP specific CTL after challenge with LCMV virus. This unresponsiveness can be transferred into SCID mice by grafting their renal capsule with thymi from newborn RIP-NP mice. Transplant of thymi from non-transgenic littermates does not cause unresponsiveness in SCID mice. Hence, the RIP-NP lines studies here negatively select out potential LCMV specific CTL, allowing limited numbers to reach peripheral organs. In contrast, RIP-GP lines positively select potential LCMV-specific CTL to reach peripheral organs of the immune system, thereby explaining the rapid onset of IDDM following viral challenge. As the interface between the immune system and underlying tissues, the endothelium may be of primary importance in mediating protective or pathogenic immune responses to this virus; however, little is known of the role of the endothelium in the modulation of the human immune response to CMV. In an effort to model such immune interactions in vrrro. we have investigated responses of spleen-derived CD4' T lymphocytes (from cadaveric organ donors) to CMV-infected autologous human gonadal vein endothelial cells (GVEC). Microculture proliferation assays demonstrated dramatically enhanced responses by CMV-seropositive donor-derived T cells cocultured with CMV-infected GVEC, as compared to those elicited by non-infected cells. Similarly, as determined by limiting dilution analysis of IL2-producing cells, the frequency of CD4+ T cells responding to infected GVEC was generally found to exceed by an order of magnitude those responding to uninfected cells. Responses of CMV-seronegative donor-derived T cells to autologous GVEC, in contrast, showed no virus-related enhancement. The marked activation of CD4+ T cells is particularly intnguing since we have shown that CMV-infected GVEC do not express HLA Class I1 antigens. These studies demonstrate that CD4' T cells can respond to CMV in the context of endothelid cells, potentially via a novel signalling mechanism, and thus, support an important role for the endothelium in the afferent recognition phase of the immune respmse to this virus.",

In the present study we investigated to what extent the peripheral carbohydrate structure of N-linked glycans influenced the antigenic properties of gpl20, specified by human immunodeficiency virus type 1 IHIV-1 I. Recombinant gpl20 was purified from GMK cells, infected with a recombinant vaccinia virus, expressing gpl20. The purified gpl20 was coated onto ELISA 96 well microplates and subjected to sequential elimination of peripheral monosaccharide units.The modified or unmodified gpl20 was then incubated with monoclonal antibodies defining specific epitopes of gpl20 and with a reporter lectin to determine the extent of carbohydrate elimination. Antibody and lectin binding was quantified in a n enzyme-linked system. We found that the carbohydrate structure, Sialic acid-Galactose INeuAc-GalR(1-4)) of N-linked glycans, defined both by lectin reactivity and by specific glycosidases. was engaged in modulating the antibody binding of a number of epitopes of peptide nature. The antibody binding of one class of epitopes, situated in a region delimited by aminoacids 200-230, was strongly increased by removal of NeuAc-GalR(1-41, whereas the binding of epitopes in the V3 region was decreased and the binding of epitopes in the far Nterminal region was not altered by the treatment. These results suggested that peripheral structures of N-glycans are engaged in modulating the overall conformation of gpl20.

HIV-specific cell mediated cytotoxicity (CMC) from fresh and in vitro stimulated PBMC of HIV-infected children was measured. CD8+CD3+ T lymphocytes were found to be the major effector population. The vast majority of children examined had detectable cytotoxic T cell responses. A cross-sectional analysis of CMC responses as a function of clinical status revealed that most children exhibiting positive primary assays belonged to the P2A CDC classification group (mild and non-specific symptoms), asymptomatic children (P1) recognized only the env glycoproteins, and most symptomatic children (P2B-F) had no detectable cytotoxic activities mediated by fresh PBMC. In contrast in vitro generated secondary CTL were consistently detected at all stages of disease, even in children with low CD4+ cells counts. C57B1/6 (86) mice generate vigorously lytic CTL in response to in vivo priming and subsequent in vitro stimulation with AKR/Gross virus-positive lymphomas. These CTL are H-2Kbrestricted and type-specific, in that they do not recognize H-2 matched Friend-Moloney-Rauscher virus-induced tumors. H-2Kbtransfected fibroblasts infected with either AKR623 MuLV or MCF247 MuLV. but not MCFl3. were efficiently lysed by these anti-AKR/Gross virus CTL. We next constructed recombinant vaccinia viruses expressing the envelope genes of these MuLV. MC57 (H-2 9 cells infected with either 623EnvVac or 247EnvVac were also lysed by these CTL, suggesting that peptide(s) derived from the shared C-terminal half of the envelope protein may be recognized. These recombinant vaccinia viruses could also prime mice for anti-AKFUGross CTL responses, and stimulate the in vitro generation of CTL from tumor-primed mice.",

This non-responsiveness appeared to be antigen-specific, in that anti-allo CTL responses of infected and uninfected mice were comparable. However, preliminary experiments suggested that infection with Friend MuLV, which is not recognized by anti-AKR/Gross virus CTL. may also abrogate the CTL response to AKRIGross virus-positive tumors, indicating that the mechanism of non-responsiveness might involve anergy or suppression of Th cells which recognize epitopes shared between these viruses, rather than a direct effect on the CTL or their undifferentiated precursors.",

We have examined the possible occurence, frequency and isotype dismbution of HIV-1 specific antibody-secreting cells (ASC) i n the intestinal mucosa of infected patients. For this purpose, punch biopsy specimens from the first duodenal segment were dispersed by a 2-step enzymatic procedure involving exposure of pre-sliced (100 x 150 mm) tissues to the cold acting enzyme thermolysine, followed by collagenase. Single cell suspensions obtained by this method comprised 40-60% highly viable ( z 90%) mononuclear cells (MNC) as assessed by conventional histochemisuy. lmmediately following isolation, cell suspensions were assayed for numbers of total as well as HIV-1 specific (gp120 and gp160) IgA-, IgG-, and IgM-ASC by micromodified bichromatic ELISPOT assays. Peripheral blood MNC obtained from the same patients were assayed in parallel. Intestinal HIV-specific ASC were detected in all patients and in considerable numbers (120-1450 gp120-and 550-3500 ~1 6 0 -s p e c i f i c ASC per million MNC), whereas circulating specific blood ASC were only occasionally detected and in low frequencies (< 50 specific ASC to either antigen per million MNC). Further, marked differences were noted with regard to isotype distribution of ASC to HIV-1 gp120 and gp160 (which comprises the transmembrane domaine gp41). These observations demonstrate that the enteromucosal immune system in HIV-1 infected individuals undergoes a state of pronounced and sustained B cell activation, and indicate that local expansion of the virus specific mucosal B cell repertoire operates independantly of systemic disease. The possible contribution of antigen specific immunoglobulin (19) receptors on B cells to syncytia formation has examined. Initially, in a model system, we used anti-TNP/TNP interactions between a panel of TNP-specific human EBV transformed lines, and HIV-I envelope expressing human CD4-T cells, which were haptenated with TNBS. The B cell lines dffered in their surface CD4 and IgM (aTNP) receptor expression.

(4) Enhanced syncytia fcrmation required TNP-haptenation of the gp120 at or close to the CD4 binding sites. Based on the above findings, we screened a panel of hybrid B cell lines from HIV-1. individuals. Two of 6 lines produced anti-gp120 Ab, one of which, secreted IgG Ab directed to the CD4biiding site on gp120. Only this hybrid line formed syncytia with 12EI-gp120/41 effectors. Our data suggest that in addition to CD4, certain anti-gpl20 Ig on B cells (specific for the CD4-binding regions), may induce conformational changes in the gp120/41 complex leading to cell membrane fusion. This mechanism may lead to a selective elimination of such B cells in vivo. Human T Lymphotropic virus type 1 (HTLV-I) is considered the etiologic agent of both an adult T cell leukemia (ATL) and a chronic immune-mediated progressive myelopathy (HAM/TSP). The HTLV-I long terminal repeat (LTR) contains sequences responsive t o the cellular second messengers cyclic AMP and protein kinase C, giving rise t o the following hypothesis: Signal transduction initiated through normal cell signaling pathways, the T C W C D 3 complex and CD2 receptor promotes viral replication and leukemogenesis in HTLV-I-infected lymphocytes. CD2 and C D 3 cross-linking protocols were optimized in peripheral b l d 1)mphocytes using plate-bound OKT3 (1:200) and pairs of soluble anti-CD2 mAbs ( T l l . l / T l l . 2 and T11.2/T11.3, 1:200-1:400). Parameters of cell activation (calcium flux, 'H-thymidine incorporation, viable cell counts) and HTLV-I replication @24 antigen capture, RT-PCR) were assessed following receptor cross-linking of both persistently infected HTLV-I cell lines (FS-CSF, IR-CSF, HuT102, MT-2 and SP10.1) and PBLs from HAM/TSP patients. The cloned persistently infected cell lines constitutively express widely variable amounts of p24 antigen (from < 250 tn >600 pglml) and membrane CD2 and CD3 receptors (from 0-96% of cells positive). Cross-linking of these transformed cells had either minimal effects on cell proliferation and p24 antigen production or resulted in cell death. While the transformed cells responded t o icinomycin stimulation with the expected calcium flux, these results may reflect uncoupling of signaling pathways, the down modulation of membrane receptor expression, or the activated state of the cells. CD2 cross-linking in 2 HAM/TSP patients resulted in a 2 fold increase in p24 production on a per cell basis as compared to unstimulated controls. Current studies are evaluating mRNA production in patient PBLs following CD2 and CD3 receptor-mediated cross-linking. These results suggest that stimulation of the CD2-mediated alternate pathway may eqhance HTLV-I replication during physiologic lymphocyte activation. Endogenous mouse mamnary tumor virus (MMTV) proviruses have recently been shown to co-segregate genetically with the minor lymphocyte stimulating (Mls) loci, also termed self-superantigens (sag). The antigenic activity has been localized to the open reading frame (ORF) protein encoded in the long terminal repeat (LTR) o f MMTV. We generated previously transgenic mice carrying internally deleted version of the exogenous C3H MTV genome (pMTV.orf). Expression of the sag gene causes deletion of the Vg14' T cells in transgenic mice and confers partial resistance to C3H exogenous virus-induced manunary tumors. I n addition to the ORF transgenic mice we made a transgenic strain, Hybrid Provirus (HYB,PRO), containing an entire copy o f an MMTV provirus in which the 3 half (including 3' LTR, env and ORF genes) was derived from C3H exogenous virus and the 5' half (including 5' LTR, gag and pol genes) came from the Mtv-1 endogenous locus present in C3H mice. Like the ORF transgenic mice, the HYB PRO transgenic mice show specific deletion of their Vg14' T cells and these mice are protected against exogenous C3H MMTV. None of the ORF transgenic mice could stimulate a proliferative response of either C3H/HeN MMTV(-) non-transgenic primary spleen cells or Vgl4-bearing hybridomas whereas HYB PRO spleen cells caused considerable proliferation of either type of responder cells. Newborn ORF and HYB PRO transgenic mice expressing high level of the transgenes have a high level of deletion of cognate thymocytes but in comparison with the HYB PRO transgenic mice this deletion in the ORF transgenic mice is not persistent. At the age of 10 days deleted thymocytes begin to reappear in the thymus of the ORF transgenic mice and this reappearance is complete at the age of 3 months. We have shown that this is not the level of the transgene expression that determines the difference we observed in the two types of transgenic mice. These discrepancies could be explain by the requirement an MMTV gene(s) in addition to sag. Genetic studies indicate that this maps to the env genes. Role of the sag and env genes in MMTV life cycle are discussed. Human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-I) isolates exhibit extensive sequence variation. and this variation has been proposed as a mechanism by which this retrovirus may evade the host immune response. Our goal is to examine the relationship between sequence variation occuning in HIV-1 CTL epitopes in vivo and recognition by HIV-I-specific CTL. CTL clones were obtained from HIV-I-infected subjects, including a laboratory worker infected with MV-1 IIIB. Clones were screened for CTL activity against target cells expressing HIV-1 proteins and the line specificity of these clones determined. HIV-I DNA coding for CTL epitopes was amplified using a nested polymerase chain reaction technique with direct sequencing of PCR products. Sequence variation was observed within CTL epitopes and in an area immediately adjacent to a CTL epitope. Mutations were observed in one epitope which lead to a loss of recognition by a CTL clone isolated at an earlier time point. However, CTL clones isolated at a later time point were able to recognize the variant sequence and the index sequence, consistent with a broadening of the CTL specificity. In another instance, sequence variation occurred without any effect on CTL recognition. Preliminary examination of the effects of mutations in regions flanking CTL epitopes have not revealed any significant effect on CTL recognition. Sequence variation may result in escape from an existing immune response but may also be countered by new or altered specificity of host defenses. In addition, behavior modifications have been reported. This study was undertaken to analyze the effect of experimental FIV infection on the central nervous system. Six post-weanling cats were inoculated IM on Day -1 and Day 0 with methylprednisolone (4.0mglkg of body weight) and IV on Day 0 with loo0 TCID,, FIV, (Mt. Airy strain). Six age matched controls were handled as described for virus inoculated cats. Cats were evaluated at 3, 6 and 12 months post inoculation (PI) by electrodiagnostic techniques including visual and brain stem auditory evoked potential (VEP, BAEP), electroencephalography (EEG), and retinocortical times (RCT). All cats were assessed for FIV mediated immunosuppression and CD4/CD8 ratios. All FIV, inoculated cats were shown to have inverted CD4/CD8 ratios (0.9 FIV vs. 3.2 Control) 5 wks PI. Six to 8 wks PI 5/6 cats were shown to demonstrate behavior modifications characterized by \"compulsive roaming\". At 3 mon PI 3/6 FIV cats showed lower BAEP and VEP responses as compared to controls. VEP responses remained low (2/6 cats) for 12 mon PI while BAEP returned to normal values at 6 mon PI. Three of 6 FIV cats showed altered EEG patterns 3 mon PI; at 12 mon PI 2/6 FIV cats demonstrated altered EEGs characterized by increased activity as compared to age-matched controls. Spinal fluid analysis demonstrated the presence (3/6 cats) of FIV-specific antibody to p24 and gp130. All cats were necropsied (15 mon PI) and assayed by histopathologic techniques. Glial cell infiltrated were shown in the lumbar spinal cord. Glial cell nodules also were reported in the subcortical regions of the brain at 15 mon PI. Culture of brain and Infection of C57BW6 mice with the LP-BM5 mixture of retroviruses causes splenomegaly, lymphadenopathy and loss of T cell and B cell functions leading to severe immunodeficiency. CD4 T cells are required for the induction and progression of the disease, termed murine AIDS (MAIDS).The extent of lymphoproliferation and immunodeficiency was studied in adult thymectomized (ATX) animals and transgenic (Tg) mice, expressing aVg3Nall TCR specific for a fragment of pigeon cytochrome C (PCCF) and IEk to evaluate the subsets of CD4 T cells required for disease progression. ATX animals are depleted of short-lived 0 4 T cells of naive phenotype and retain only cells of memory phenotype and functions. Transgenic mice have a predominantly naive CD4 population. Both groups, ATX and Tg develop disease and the CD4 T cells, memory and naive respectively, are rendered unresponsive to mitogenic stimulation.",

Before CD4+ T cells are depleted, T cells from asymptomatic HIV-infected individuals are non-responsive to activation via the CDSfl-cell receptor complex and release of TH1 cytokines is low. Functional abnormalities of Tcells might be secondaty to the disturbance of antigen presenting cell function due to HIV infection. Incomplete activation by affected antigen presenting cells might lead to anergy of T Cells. Indeed, T Cells from HIV-infected indNidUals show characteristics of anergic cells as defined in murine models. Funhermore, these models showed that anergy is preferentially induced in T cells that have cytokine secretion patterns defined as TH1-like. We investigated the type of T cells that could be cloned from HIV-infected individuals. Tcells randomly cloned from an HIV-infected individual showed a high proportion of IL-4 producing clones upon activation, whereas from an HIVnegative control, T-cell clones produced only low or not detectable levels of IL-4. T cells cloned from the HlV-negative control produced high levels of IL-2. whereas lower IL-2 production was found in clones derived from the HIVinfected individual. The finding that preferentially THP-ltke clones can be isolated after HIV-infection was tunher substantlated by clones derived in parallel from cryopreserved material from the same individual before infection with HIV and three years afler seroconversbn. Again, predominantly clones producing 11-4 were found after HIV-1 infection in contrast to the clones derived from the time point before infection. Thus, upon HIVinfection. predominantly THP-like Tcell clones are generated which may be due to preferential anergy of TH1 cells. In addition, in vivo, TH2 cells could downregulate function of TH1 cells by secretion of cytokines as IL-10. This might contribute to the anentuatlon of the immune system and impaired responses to foreign antigens as observed in HIV-infected indwiduals. Long-term survival in HIV infection may be determined by effective host immune responses against HIV and/or variable HIV virulence. Among a large cohort of HIV-infected men, 21 HIV-1-infected long-term survivors (LTS) were identified based on normal and stable CD4 counts, normal polyclonal T-cell responses and the presence of only low-cytopathic, nonsyncytium-inducing (NSI) HIV variants after 7 years of seropositivity. To investigate the role of HIV-specific CTL, one LTS was studied in detail, using autologous EBV-B cells infected with gag-recombinant vaccinia virus as stimulator and target cells. Unstimulated PBL did not show any detectable HIV gag-specific CTL activity, which in limiting dilution analyses (LDA) was shown to be due to suppression at high cell numbers. After Ag-specific stimulation, a high frequency of ga specific class-Irestricted CD8+ CTL could be detected (267-348/1J-PBL). Split-well analyses on a panel of HLA-typed EBV lines demonstrated that CTL activity was restricted by HLA-A3 and B18 and A25. Viral load in this patient was low: 3.6 infected cells per lo6 PBL. Sustained anti-HIV cellular immunity may correlate with maintenance of the asymptomatic state in LTS by control of viral replication. Pennsylvania and Dept.

Since CR has been shown to both extend lifespan and delay leukemia development in these strains of mice, the effect of CR on virus expression was examined. There was an age associated increase in endogenous virus expression in AL DBAD (17% to 67% to 100%) and C57BU6 (0% to 60% to 50%) mice. CR delayed expression in both strains (33% and 0% at middle aged in DBGn and C57BU6, respectively). There was little or no endogenous viral expression found in AL or CR (B6xDBU) We have been able to detect Nef specific CTL in a number of HIV-1 infected donors, including patients in advanced stages of disease. These CTL activities were detectable in freshly isolated PBMC, as well as from CTL lines obtained by non-specific in vitro stimulation with an anti-CD3 monoclonal Ab and IL-2, using B-EBV targets infected with a recombinant vaccinia virus encoding the Nef protein (Vacc-Nef). For some patients, Nef specific CTL lines recognized an epitope located in a conserved region of Nef as defined by the lysis of target cells coated with Nef peptides. In one patient these CTL activities were detectable over a four year peirod and were directed against the same epitopes over this entire period. This patient's B-EBV cells were transduced with a Nef retroviral vector and were found to be efficiently lysed by Nef specific CTL lines generated by non-specific stimulation. In addition, these Nef transduced cells were very potent stimulators of Nef specific CTL lines from this patient's PBMC. Moreover, the CTL lines thus generated recognized the same epitopes as CTL lines generated by non-specific stimulation with anti-CD3 Ab and maintained lytic activity against autologous cells infected with Vacc-Nef. Taken together, these results demonstrate the ability of autologous target cells transduced with a Nef retroviral vector to stimulate antigen speafic CTL activity as well as to serve as Nef specific target cells. Previously, we demonstrated that in vivo responses mediated by CD4' and CD8+ T cells were markedly aberrant in LP-BM5 infected mice in that they lost the ability to reject MHC class I1 disparate bm12 skin grafts and exhibited delayed rejection of MHC class I disparate bml skin grafts, indicating loss of CD4+ and CD8' T cell functions respectively. Because in vivo T cell deficits were observed in mice inoculated with BM5 mix, a mixture of replication competent (helper) and defective MuLVs, it was not clear if these deficits were induced solely by the replication defective virus (BM5d), known to be necessary and sufficient for induction of MAIDS. To clarify this point, groups of 86 mice were engrafted with bml and bm12 skin several weeks after inoculation with BM5 mix, helper ecotropic or MCF MuLVS, or an ecotropic MuLV pseudotype of molecularly cloned BM5d [BM5d(eco)], either alone or enhanced in replication b added MCF MuLV. Approximately equivalent CD4Y T cell dysfunction was evident in mice inoculated with BM5 mix or BM5d(eco) but not in those given helper MuLVs alone, and there was no evidence of enhanced suppression in mice inoculated with BM5d(eco) plus MCF MuLV. NO alterations in CD8+ T cell function were discerned in mice inoculated with helper viruses, or with BMSd(eco), either alone, or with added MCF MuLVs. However, CD8' T cell dysfunction was evident in mice inoculated with BM5 mix suggesting that efficiency of expression of BM5d, mediated by helper virus activity, may affect some T cell populations more than others. HIV RNA undergoes obligatory reverse transcription to a dsDNA form in the cytoplasm of infected cells. This step is critical for the establishment of infection. However, no treatment has yet been devised to target the dsDNA. If the dsDNA form of the virus could be destroyed before translocating to the nucleus and integrating into the host genome, then perhaps amplification of the virus within the organism might be prevented and disease progression halted.",

            "text": "Bacterial cells possess DNA site-specific restriction-modification systems that provide protection from viral infections, The type I1 restriction endonucleases recognize a particular sequence in DNA and cleave the DNA in the vicinity of that sequence. We investigated whether the type I1 restriction endonucleases could modify the course of HIV infection in human PBL. Studies performed to date indicate that enzymes known to cleave the dsDNA form of the virus inhibit the development of RT activity in cultures of infected human PBL whereas a control enzyme which lacks a restriction Site on HIV dsDNA fails to inhibit virus replication. The replication kinetics were delayed and the absolute RT level achieved in the treated cultures was reduced. Additionally, morphologic changes associated with infection, such as syncytia formation, were significantly delayed. Of critical importance, the restriction endonucleases do not appear to damage host cell DNA as shown by their failure to inhibit proliferation of activated human PBL in vitro. Thus, type I1 restriction endonucleases may prove useful in the study and treatment of HIV infection. HIV-infected patients have an intense accumulation of activated CD8+ T cells in the lung (CD8 alveolitis), when compared to the blood. CD8 alveolitis is largely accounted for by the presence of large numbers of CD8+ cytotoxic T cells (CTL) (CD8+D44+). However, CD8+ CTL are known t o have defects in cytolytic ability, in proliferative potential, and memory cell number. The functionally significant surface receptor CD28, important in regulating the antigenspecific response of T cells, also identifies CTL in the CD8 subpopulation. To evaluate the expression of CTL markers in HIV infection, we performed BAL and venipuncture on five HIV-infected patients, all without respiratory symptoms, and on eight normal volunteers. We used monoclonal antibodies t o CD8, D44 and t o CD28 to identify the CTL population within the CD8+ T cell subset by flow cytomtery. We found no significant difference between normals and HIV seropositives in the tage of C D 8 + W + cells in blood (29 2 7.6% vs. 27.24 2 5.6c~tively, fl.88) or lung (54.9 2 8.3% vs. 39.84 2 12%, respectively ,p4.31).

Comparison of the CTL marker ratios (CD8+W+/CD8+CD28+) demonstrated marked relative reduction in It was found that progressive course of infection caused by Rauscher leukemia retrovirus (RV) in genetically susceptible mice is preceded and accompanied with formation of a series of autoimmune reactions against antigens involved in immune response regulation: MHC class I1 antigens (Ia proteins), T-cell surface markers CD4 and CD8, receptors for IL-2, etc. Passive transfer of these auto-antibodies or adequate monoclonal antibodies suppresses the genetically determined resistance of C57BL/6 mice to leukemogenic action of RV. On the other hand, both the maintenance of natural resistance to RV and naturally occurring regression of the disease were shown to be connected with active synthesis of antlidiotypic antibodies against autoantibodies of \"progressor\" type, mentioned above. We were able to induce such a synthesis in highly susceptible mice using autoantibodies or monoclonal antibodies conjugated to dialdehyde cellulose. Immunization with such insoluble complexes provide high therapeutic rather than prophylactic effect. Surprisingly the ability to produce autoantibodies to MfK class I gene products appeared to be another indispensable condition of resistance to RV infection. It turned out that immunization with monoclonal antibodies to H-2Db suppresses both anti-H-2Db autoantibody production and natural resistance to RV. Immunization of susceptible mice with fixed leukemic cells in addition to immunization with autoantibodies of \"progressor\" type provide both production of anti-MHC class I antibodies and high prophylactic effect to RV infection. These approaches might possibly be of use for therapy and prevention of retrovirus-induced diseases. Susceptible strains of mice infected with the LP-BM5 murine leukemia virus (MuLV) miaure containing a nonpathogenic helper virus and a pathogenic 4 8 kB replication defective viral genome (LP-BM5D) develop immunodeficiency disease (MAIDS) that is characterized by extensive T and B cell proliferation and severe CD4 T cell unresponsiveness The LP-BM5D genome codes for an altered gag precursor protein (Pr60SaS) Although the precise role of Pr6OSaS in disease is not known it has been recently proposed that it is a viral \"superantigen\" based on the finding that one The ecotropic murine leukemia virus, E-55+, will induce a thvmic Ivmphoma/leukemia after a latency period of more than 4 months in all immunocompetent BALB.K mice that are injected as adults. The disease process involves an initial acute phase followed by a period when virus infected cells cannot be detected by PCR in any of the tissues of infected host. Sequence analysis of the env gene of the virus that is isolated from leukemic mice demonstrates that the E-55+ virus has undergone a double homologous recombination with the endogenous ecotropic virus, emv-1, carried within the genome of the BALB.K mouse. As a result, the new recombinant virus, designated E-55-, cannot be neutralized by antisera from BALB K mice infected with the E-55+ virus. Preliminary data from adoptive transfer experiments indicate that bone marrow from BALB.K mice infected with the E-55+ virus can induce disease in both normal and thymectomized adult animals. normal adult animals receiving either virus or infected bone marrow, a decreased latency period is observed in the adoptively transferred animals with or without a thymus. Bone marrow colony assays using a variety of cytokines suggests that the target cell of the E-55+ virus is a hematopoietic progenitor cell.

We have investigated the parameters involved in priming a HSVspecific cytotoxic T-lymphocyte response in mice using recombinant, truncated glycoprotein B from HSV-2 (gB2). The parameters we have studied include adjuvant, immunization route and regimen. gB2 was delivered with PBS, complete Freund's adjuvant, DOTAP, a cationic lipid preparation and MF59, an oil-in-water emulsion. gB2 delivered with phosphate buffer does not prime a CTL response and gB2 with CFA generates a low CTL response. In contrast, gB2 delivered with DOTAP elicits a strong CTL response generating CTLs capable of lysing target cells infected with HSV or pulsed with the dominant CTL epitope from gB2 (aa495-509) in an in vitro j*Cr release assay. gB2 delivered with MF59 elicits CTL activity equivalent to that seen with DOTAP.

Live, attenuated virus vaccines have proved their effectiveness in controlling many virus diseases. Although they offer long-lived immunity and are relatively inexpensive to produce and administer, they also present the problem of reversion to a more virulent phenotype. The present investigational live virus vaccine for the alphavirus Venezuelan equine encephalitis (VEE), produces frequent adverse reactions that may be caused by such reversion events. We propose to overcome the disadvantage of reversion by using a molecular strategy to place multiple independently attenuating mutations into a single VEE vaccine strain. Attenuating mutations have been identified both in biologically selected attenuzted virus strains and in attenuated mutants produced by targeted mutagenesis of conserved regions. These attenuating mutations have been introduced by site-directed mutagenesis into a hull-length cDNA clone of VEE, which can be transcribed in v i m to give infectious RNA genomes. Loci affecting virulence have been identified in the E2 and El glycoprotein genes and in the 5'-untranslated region. Also, attenuated strains have been isolated that carry both a lethal mutation at the PE2 cleavage site and a resuscitating mutation in a glycoprotein gene. The feasibility of combining attenuating mutations to produce a stable vaccine strain has been demonstrated in rodents and in horses using three E2 glycoprotein mutations, Other multiple mutants are now being tested .

B cells were as susceptible to infection as permissive brown bullhead cells and supported high levels of CCV replication even though viral gene expression terminated prematurely. In contrast, CCV yields in T cell and macrophage cultures were markedly lower, a result consistent with the delayed expression of viral genes. These findings indicate that catfish lymphoid cell lines support active CCV replication albeit with differing degrees of permissiveness. Furthermore, the ability to infect leukocyte cultures productively suggests that CCV-infected autologous macrophage or T-cell lines may be suitable targets for assays of catfish cytotoxic T cell activity. PA 19406 Previous studies have shown that mice immunized with a chimeric recombinant protein (NS1 1.81-HA265.222; \"D protein\") derived from A/PR/8/34 ( H l N l ) are protected from lethal challenge with H l N l and H2N2 viruses in the absence of a neutralizing antibody response. Studies with the H 1 H A 2 and NS1 components expressed separately showed that the HAZ65.222 protein retained the properties of the NS1-HA2 chimer in that CD4+ and CDB+ T cell responses and H l I H 2 cross-protection were elicited In contrast, the NS1 component elicited a CD4+ response, but was not protective.

These animals developed humoral and cell-mediated HSV-2 responses and exhibited reduced recurrent disease after HSV genital challenge.

In two separate esperiments of 93 guinea pigs, gly + imiquimod produced an overall 56-70% reduction in mean recurrence lesion days compared to no immunization. Peak protection with the imiquimod adjuvant occurred between days 42 and 63 (68.89% reduction). CFA + gly produced an overall reduction of 2634% and peak protection of 39-60%. Both adjuvant regimens were superior to gly alone. HSV-2 antibody, proliferative responses and MHC-unresmcted cytolysis of HSV targets were assayed at selected intervals. Enhanced cellmediated immune responses after gly + imiquimod immunotherapy were associated with the reduced recurrent HSV disease. The assembly of some enveloped RNA viruses has been shown to be inhibited by peptides from envelope glycoprotein sequences. This suggests a new approach to the development of antiviral drugs. Human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) envelope glycoproteins gp120 and gp41 encompass several domains associated with already defined viral functions, including the C D 4 cell receptor binding site o n gp120. and sites on gp12O/gp41 involved in fusion of virus or virus-infected cells with uninfected target cells. Some of these functional domains bind synthetic peptides from other regions of gp12O/gp41. T h e aim of the present study was: (a) to determine whether o r not peptides from gp12Oigp41 inhibit HIV-I infection and (b) define the mechanism of action of inhibitory peptides. After screening synthetic peptides from HIV-1 IIIB envelope glycoproteins gp120igp41, we found that only one of the peptides. IP1. derived from the extracellular portion of gp41, at concentrations 2 2 pM inhibited HIV-1 IIIB replication, virusinduced cell fusion and cytopathc effects to undetectable levels in both CD4+ T and monocytic cell lines. This peptide also inhibited infection by several other HIV-1 isolates, including V32, a IIIB variant resistant to neutralization by V 3 loop-specific antibodies; h4N; R F SFZ; and AZT-sensitive and resistant clinical isolates. The peptide binds to the fusion domain a t the N-terminus of gp41. and thereby inhibits HIV-1 induced fusion.",

HTLV-I infection is etiologically linked with adult T-cell leukemiailymphoma (ATLL) and a chronic, degenerative mye!opathy. Several immunodominant structural motifs of the HTLV-I envelope have been defined by the use of either recomhinant proteins or synthetic peptides. We sought to investigate the immunogenicity and immunoprotective capacity of selected regions of the HTLV-I envelope gp46 using synthetic peptides presented either as contiguous linear peptides coupled to BSA or by pairing with \"promiscuous\" T cell epitopes. A synthetic peptide derived from an immunodominant HTLV-I gp46 region (Env-5, aa242-257) linked to BSA elicited strong dntibody responses in ELISA and immunotluorescent assays. but these antibodies fhiled to inhibit HTLV-I-mediated cell fusion or prntect rabbits from HTLV-I infection. The peptide did not induce T-cell proliferative responses in rabbits: however. the peptide did elicit antihodies in T-cell deficient Balh c nuhu mice suggesting that the immune response to this region of the viral envelope is predominantly a Bcell epitope.

The viral lung titers in NP DNA-immunized mice were decreased three logs in comparison to nonimmunized or control plasmid-immunized mice. The NP DNA-immunized mice also lost less weight (as an indicator of morbidity) and had significantly increased survival compared to control. This approach thus provided a simple yet powerful means of inducing an immune response capable of protecting against a heterologous viral infection. Mucosal surfaces act as a first line of defense against many infectious organisms. Intramuscular vaccination with subunit vaccines containing a n advanced low oil emulsion adjuvant (MF59) has been shown to provide superior protection from mucosal herpes simplex virus 2 (HSV2) challenge in guinea pigs compared to alum. We were interested i n determining if this approach results i n measurable antibody at mucosal surfaces. Guinea pigs were vaccinated intramuscularly with recombinant HSV2 glycoprotein D (rgD2) without adjuvant, or combined with alum, MF59, or MF59 plus muramyl tripeptide-phosphatidyl ethanolamine (MTP-PE).

This is tome out by experiments which show that in the mouse ear model of HSV-1 intection, vaccination with as liile as lo5 pfu of the gHdeleted HSV-1 virus is capable of providing effective protection against replication of wild type challenge virus and consequent disease, whereas an equivalent dose of inactivated wild type v i m cannot. The substantially greater immunogenicity of particulate antigens relative to soluble subunit antigens has been attributed to both the presence of polyvalent antigen arrays on the particles and to enhanced transport of particulate antigens in the lymphatic drainage. Some part of the adjuvant effect of both oil in water emulsions and iscom structures has been attributed to association of antigen with the adjuvant particle (droplet). We have compared antibody titers generated with both iscom and MF-59 emulsion ( squalene/H20 ) formulations in which antigen was either bound to the adjuvant particle (droplet) or free i n solution. Under the standard dosage conditions used in these systems, antibody titers were independent of association. In addition antigen and adjuvant have been injected separately with up to 24 hours between injections. Preinjection of the MF-59 adjuvant results in equivalent titers to the standard coinjection. Our results suggest that these adjuvants provide stimulation by mechanisms other than antigen binding. To elicit an efficient immune response against the measles virus, a synthetic vaccine must contain T cell epitopes, capable of inducing a T cell memory. To detect T cell epitopes of the measles fusion protein, we have studied the proliferative response of lymphocytes from adult convalescent donors to overlapping pentadecapeptides covering the whole protein sequence. Most donors reacted with 10 % of the peptides, but some reacted with up to 25%. Six regions were identified which reacted with more than half of the donors including the so-called \"fusion peptide\". This \"fusion peptide\" contains a promiscuous Tu cell epitope recognized by peripheral blood lymphocytes of DR1,DRZ. DR5 and/or DR7-positive donors. The epitope contains the consensus motifs described for DR1 and DR2 binding peptides. In a human protein data bank 26 7/15-homologues of the epitope sequence were found. Among the two possible models, we chose the helical model to propose that four alanine residues are facing the T cell receptor and that a glutarnine is important for interaction with the TCR. This glutamine was found in none of the 15 human homologues in which 3 or 4 of the above alanines were conserved. In contrast, 6 of the 11 human homologues u i t h more than one substitution of an alanine contained the glutamhe. Substitution analogues of the peptide F121 confinne a role of the glutamine in T cell stimulation. The T cell epitope described here is highly conserved in different paramyxoviruses. Competition between different T cell epitopes may, however, modulate its importance in other viruses. Besides the \"fusion peptide\", a number of peptides defined epitopes Shich are promiscuous with respect to MHC class Il recognition. In particular such peptides are of interest for the development of synthetic subunit vaccines. intramuscular injection of plasmid DNA results in expression of the genes encoded by the plasmid. We have investigated the immunological consequences of injection of an expression vector containing the genes for two well characterized antigens: the gp120 gene from HIV-1 and the nucleoprotein (NP) gene from influenza A virus. A single injection of DNA encoding for either gene induces IgG antibodies which appear 2 to 3 weeks after injection and persist for more than 12 months. The antibody response is dose dependent with 10 fig of DNA required for a consistent antibody response. Maximum antibody titers for both antigens were in the range of 1 /lO,GOO to 1/30,000.",

To better understand the mechanism of action of MF59 adjuvants, we have undertaken a study of the systemic cytokine profile in Balb/c mice. Our goal is to elicit desirable cytokine responses by optimization of the MF59 adjuvant formulation.

An 11 amino acid long peptide (gB 618-628) was found to b e the optimal peptide for recognition by HLA-A2-restricted CD8+ cytotoxic T cells We now report that the very same peptide is also presented by several HLA-DR4 subtypes. GB-specific CD4+ T cell clones generated from one HCMV-positive individual secrete IL-2, IFN-7 and TNF-a, but not IL-4. A 30 amino acid long region of g B is therefor not only inducing neutralizing antibodies, but also capable of inducing class I-restricted cytotoxic T cells and class Il-restricted, potential helper T cells. This epitope is conserved in HCMV labstrains as well as patient strains, which suggests a n important function of it for the virus. Taken together this epitope appears to be a good candidate for a subunit vaccine. Clonal expansion of CD4+ T cells not only depends on ligation of the T cell receptor (TCR) by MHC/peptide complexes but also requires costimulatory signals that can be generated by accessory molecules present on specialized antigen presenting cells (APC). The T-cell membrane molecule CD28 appears to be a transducer for such signal. We tested induction of proliferation by CD3 mAb presented by transfected mouse fibroblasts, expressing both CD32 and B7, in highly purified T-cell subsets, i.e. (naive) CD45RO-and CD45RK (memory cells). Optimal stimulation of the TCR with large amounts of fibroblasts presenting high dose of CD3 mAb (5 pglml), resulted in a more effi ci ent proliferation of naive cells compared to memory cells. In marked contrast when low dose of CD3 mAb were applied (5 ng/ml) memory cells are still efficiently induced whereas respans in naive cells was almost completely lost. Analysis of cytokine production showed similar results. These data show that naive cells can effectively respond to the CD28-ligand B7. Moreover it is suggested that for their optimal respons a relatively high degree of TCRICD3 cross linking i s required.

Whether the inability of the other 2 DR2(w16)+ non-responders to present HBsAg to the T cell lines was due to hisloincompatibility or to an antigenuptake, -processing and/or -presentation defect remains unclear. Conclusions : The non-responsiveness lo HBsAg of 6 out of 8 HLA-DR2+ vaccinees is not due to a defect in antigen-uptake, -processing or -presentation, but to another mechanism that has yet to be defined. Cell-mediated immunity is an important component of the host response to viral infections and in the case of SIV infection, this response may control the virus load. The moleculary cloned SIVmaclAl1 is a model for a live virus vaccine because monkeys infected with this virus are transiently viremic, do not develop disease and withstand low-dose challenge with a pathogenic strain of SIVmac. The mechanism of protection is unknown.",

We will monitor the Cn. response through the viremia aansition period, together with end-point dilution quanutation of viremia. We hypothesize that the level of CTL activity will decline when the monkeys become aviremic and will increase following a second inoculation with 1Al1. In addition, recombinant viruses constructed from the genomes of SIVmac1 A1 1 and SIVmac239 produce low-level persistant viremia (unlike the uansient viremia with SIVmaclAll) and no disease after two years. Cn. responses and viremia will be measured in animals infected with these viruses, before and after challenge with pathogenic SIV. The type of immune response induced is determined, in part, by the pattern of cytokines secreted by different subsets of T lymphocytes. One subset of T lymphocyte (Thl) secretes IL-2 and IFN-y and promotes cellmediated immunity, whilst another population (Th2) secretes IL-4. IL-5. IL-6 and IL-10 and preferentially induces antibody responses. Given this information, it is not surprising that attempts have been made to modify the immune response to vaccines by the administration of cytokines. However, cytokines generally have a very short half-life in vivo and there are major difficulties associated with toxicity and targetting. problems by constructing live recombinant virus vaccines which encode their own cytokine genes. Thus, during replication, the virus produces its own factor which is secreted from the infected cells with profound immunological consequences. Based on their effect on the growth and immunogenicity of the virus, the cytokines studied to date fall into 2 categories; those that alter the pathogenesis of the virus and those that selectively stimulate specific immune responses. Both of these properties are relevant to the development of safe and effective vaccines. The expression of IL-2, IFNy or TNF dramatically alter the virulence of the virus vector. On the other hand, IL-5 expression selectively stimulates an IgA response whilst IL-6 stimulates an enhanced IgG response to coexpressed antigens.",

Virtually all CdHIBiDa mice inoculated with wild type polyoma virus developed a wide variety of tumors; polyomainfected C57BRicdJ mice failed to develop tumors. Of note, the (CBH/BiDa x C57BRIcdJ)FI mice were as susceptible to polyomainduced tumors as the CSHBiDa parent. Genetic segregation analysis indicated that a single autosomal dominant gene in C3HIBiDa mice conferred susceptibility to polyoma-induced tumors(Benjamin et. al., manuscript in preparation). Because C3H/BiDa mice exhibit the Mlsla Mls2a phenotype (and carry Mtv-6, -7, -8, -14, -17) while C57BRIcdJ mice are Mlslb Mls2b (and carry Mtv-8, -9, -14, as well as deleting germlineVp 5, 8,9, 11, 12, 13  exons), we reasoned that either the Mlsla or Mls*a antigen mediates negative selection of Vp 3 or Vp 6(7)-expressing anti-polyoma T cells, respectively, resulting in development of polyoma-induced tumors in CBHIBiDa mice. FACS analysis of splenic T cells from polyoma-infected (C3HiBiDa x C57BRlcdJ)Fl x C57BR/cdJ backcross mice revealed very high correlation between the appearance of tumors and absence of Vp6-positive T cells; in contrast, presence of Vp 3-expressing T cells showed no correlation with tumor development. Segregation analysis of Mtv-7 in these backcross mice by Southern hybridization of genomic DNA with a Mtv-7 3' flanking cellular DNA probe showed perfect concordance with Vp 6 usage. These studies suggest that the Mlsl a antigen encoded by the Mtv-7 open reading frame confers susceptibility to polyoma-induced tumors in CBHiBiDa mice by deleting Vp 6 and/or Vp 7-expressing T cells required for clearance of polyomainfected cells/-induced tumors in vivo. N 134 VIRAL SUPERANTIGEN PROCESSING AND THROUGH MUTATIONAL ANALYSIS, PRESENTATION TO T-CELLS INVESTIGATED Christopher W. McMahon and Ann M. Pullen, Department of Immunology, Howard Hughes Medical Institute, University of Washington, Seattle, WA 98195. Endogenous superantigens, encoded by mouse mammary tumor virus (MMTV) proviral integrants, have a profound effect on the shaping of the T-cell repertoire during tolerance induction. Viral superantigen (vSAG) forms a complex with MHC class I1 products on presenting cells, and is then able to stimulate T-cells bearing a particular Vp element on their T-cell receptor, in a manner distinct from normal antigen presentation. MTV-encoded viral superantigens are type I1 membrane glycoproteins; however it is not known whether the superantigen is presented to T-cells in this form. Recent evidence (Winslow, G. M., er al.

Tufariellol, Sangho C h d and Marshall S. Horwitz1.2, Departments of 1Microbiology and Immunology, *Pediatrics and 'Pathology, Albert Einstein College of Medlcine, Bronx, NY 10461Human adenoviruses (Ads) encode proteins with the potential to alter the host inflammatory response to infection. Ad immune modulators include the early region 3 (E3) protein, gpl9k, which downregulates cell surface expression of class I MHC. Other E3 proteins have been shown to protect cells from ThF-(r induced cytolysis in vitro(Hotton et al. J Virol  65:2629-2639, 1991; these include the 14.7K and the combination of the 10.4/14.53 proteins.In addition, the 19K product of the EIB transcription unit has similar effects on TNF. The mechanism of inhibition of TNFinduced cytolysis and its significance in vivo are largely unknown.To assess the ability of 14.7K from Ad2 to affect disease in mice, we constructed vaccinia virus (VV) recombinants expressing this protein.VV was chosen as a vector both to synthesize individual Ad proteins and because human Ads replicate poorly in mice. TNF expression in VV has been shown to have an attenuating effect on murine infections (Sambhi et al, Proc Natl Acad Sci USA 88:4025-4029, 1991). In order to ensure high local concentrations of both the agonist (TNF) and its antagonist (14.7K) at the site of infection, we cloned the gene expressing murine TNF-(r into the VV Hind111 F region and the Ad2 14.7K coding sequence into the VV thymidine kinase gene in both expressing and nonexpressing orientations. Balb/c mice were infected intranasally with each of the VV recombinants [TNF(+)/14.7(+) or TNF(+)/14.7(-)] and examined for clinical illness, mortality (LD 50), histopathology of lung and other tissues and viral replication. The expression of 14.7K by the TNF producing VV enhanced its pathogenicity as evidenced by increased seventy of disease and lethality, increased pulmonary viral titers, delayed viral clearance from lungs, and a more pronounced peribronchial and perivascular pulmonary inflammatory response. Further study of this pneumonia model is underway to determine the extent to which the cytokine, cell mediated and humoral responses of the immune system are altered by 14.7K expression.

Ins-IL-10 mice show peri-islet inflammatory cell infiltration without diabetes. The effect of in situ IL-10 on the response to local islet (viral) antigens was studied in lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus (LCMV)-infected double transgenic mice expressing both IL-10 and LCMV NP antigen in pancreatic p-cells. In our preliminary data, splenocytes from the infected double transgenic mice showed cytotoxic T cell response against virus-infected target cells. Two months after infection, double transgenic mice developed diabetes before single transgenic mice develop diabetes, indicating that local production of IL-10 does not inhibit recognition of islet (viral) antigens. The effect of IL-10 on allograft rejection was studied by transplantation of fetal pancreata expressing IL-10 into MHC-incompatible hosts. The graft tissue was rejected with a similar time frame as nontransgenic pancreata suggesting that IL-10 may not entirely inhibit local antigen presentation. These results imply that in situ expression of IL-10 may not prevent (viral) antigen presentation and recognition in the periphery.",

Mehrdad Matloubian, Lisa Lau, Chwan-Chuen King, Betty Wu-Hsieh, and Rafi b e d , Department of Microbiology and Immunology, UCLA School of Medicine, Los Angeles, CA 90024 We have previously shown that infection of adult mice with macrophage-tropic variants of lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus (LCMV) results in a chronic infection that i s associated with suppressed T cell responses and susceptibility to opportunistic infections. A hallmark of this chronic viral infection is a prolonged pancytopenia and atrophy of lymphoid tissues. We asked whether this immune deficiency i s due to a central defect in hematopoiesis. Analysis of bone marrow from these mice showed impaired production of both lymphocytes and macrophages. To elucidate the mechanism of this suppressed hematopoiesis we examined infection of bone marrow and characterized the infiltrates within this compartment. Infection of bone marrow cells peaks at day 5 postinfection with -60,000 cells per million being infected and decreases to -300 cells per million by day 14. This drop in the number of infected cells i s preceded by infiltration of activated CD8+ T cells. By 8 days post-infection -90% of CD8+ T cells in bone marrow are activated as measured by increased CD44 expression. However, limiting dilution analysis shows that only a minor fraction ( -1/1000) of these activated CD8+ T cells are LCMV specific. In vivo depletion of CD8+ T cells prevents the bone marrow suppression, reverses the lymphopenia and protects the mice against a second pathogen. Thus, a population of activated CD8+ T cells, where the majority are not virus-specific, can mediate bone marrow damage during a chronic viral infection resulting in an impaired immune system. Such a polyclonally activated population of T cells may play a similar immunosuppressive role, perhaps through an autoimmune mechanism, in the course of other chronic viral infections.",

This inhibition did not occur when HUVEC were treated with UVinactivated virus and IFNy. HCMV, as determined by dual-labelling immunohistochemistry with monoclonal antibodies to HCMV early nuclear proteins and HLA class I1 antigens (anti-HLA DRa, anti-HLA class 11 beta chain, anti-HLA DP) inhibited induction of surface and cytoplasmic class I1 antigens in infected cytomegalic cells and not on adjacent non-infected cells within the cultures. Northern blot analysis of infected, IFNy-treated HUVEC revealed an absence of class I1 mRNA in contrast to IFNy-treated noninfected HUVEC.

Buesa-Gomez, J.C. de la Torre, and M.B.A. Oldstone, The Scripps Research Institute, La Jolla, CA 92037. Virus-receptor interaction, the first step in the infection process, is one of the key determinants of virus pathogenicity. We have been studying the cellular receptors used by members of the arenavirus family in order to elucidate whether receptor binding may underlie the differences in their & y h biological properties. Using a virus overlay protein blot assay (VOPBA), we have identified 120-140kD cell membrane glycoprotein(s) as the putative receptor for lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus (LCMV). The expression of this putative receptor on tissue culture cell lines correlates with their susceptibility to LCMV infection. While binding of some LCMV isolates (Armstrong clone 13, Traub, Pasteur and WE clone 54) to the 120-14OkD putative receptor is readily demonstrated, the interaction of other LCMV isolates (Armstrong parental strain, E350, and WE clone 2.2) with these or other proteins cannot be detected by VOPBA. There are correlations between binding to this putative cellular receptor and the Viva biological properties of members of these two groups of viruses, e.g. the Armstrong parental strain and WE clone 2.2 produce a growth hormone deficiency syndrome on inoculation into neonatal C3H/St mice, whereas Armstrong clone 13 and WE clone 54 do not; and Armstrong clone 13 causes a generalized immune suppression on i.v. inoculation into adult mice, whereas the Armstrong parental strain does not. On the basis of this evidence, we hypothesize that receptor binding is likely a critical determinant of the Viva pathogenicity of different arenavirus isolates.",

Bellini, Division of Viral and Rickettsia1 Diseases, Centers for Disease Control, Atlanta, GA 30333 Proliferative responses to measles virus a s measured by the uptake of 3H thymidine, have been hard to demonstrate in immune individuals who have been naturally infected. Previous attempts have used purified whole virus a s the stimulus, and the levels of stimulation reported have been low and poorly reproducible. We have cloned the nucleoprotein gene from the Edmonston vaccine strain into a baculovirus expression vector and purified the recombinant nucleoprotein (rNP) using either a monoclonal antibody affinity column or ultracentrifugation. We have determined the l n e t i c s of response using naturally infected individuals and obtained good responses, with stimulation indices (SI) ranging from 5-15. In a comparison between the cellular immune responses of naturally infected and immunized individuals, 13 individuals in each category, matched for sex and race were assayed for their ability to respond to RNP. Approximately 65% of each group had a positive response (natural=69%, vaccine=62%). The range of SI seen was 1-16 for naturally infected individuals and 1-20 for vaccinees. These differences are not statistically significant. Estimates of nucleoprotein-specific T cell frequency in the 2 groups determined by limiting dilution analysis will be presented.

J.M. Middeldorp and W. Grunsven Biotechnology Research Unit, Organon Teknika, Bonel, The Netherlands. A detailed immunoblot study was done with human sera collected worldwide from healthy seropositives (n=3M) and patients (o > uxl) with a variety of different EBV-associated disease syndromes. IgA, IgM and IgG responses were analysed using natural and recombinant forms of EBV-proteins characteristic for different stages of the EBV replication cycle. Comparing the number and nature of antigens identified by human serum antibodies allowed a clear differentiation of the humoral immune status in patients and healthy controls, as well as differentiation between patient goeps. Acute primary infection is characterized by IgM and IgG responses to viral replicative proteins (EA + VCA) whereas the latent infection in man is characterized by IgG response to latent phase (EBNA) proteins, few dominant structural virion proteins and the zebra-switch (IEA) protein. Nasopharyngeal carcinoma is characterized by IgG and IgA responses to replicative proteins (EA and VCA) that differ from those recognised in primary infection. Chronic severe EBV infection in children frequently is associated with a specific lack of responsiveness to the EBNAI protein, with fulminant antibody responses to replicative phase proteins Results will be discussed in view of site and activity of virus replication in vivo and the host immune surveillance.

Massachusetts Medical Ctr., Worcester, MA.During the examination of the mouse cytotoxic T cell (CTL) response to viral infections it was observed that challenge of lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus (LCMV) -immune mice with a second virus, either Pichinde (PV) or vaccinia virus, resulted in the generation of LCMV-specific memory CTL reactivation. Limiting dilution analyses (LDA) of these CTL generated in vivo revealed that some virus specific CTL clones were cross-reactive with the second virus. Mice receiving only one virus generated few if any cross-reactive clones during an acute infection. However, CTL from a LCMV-immune mouse when restimulated during an LDA with either LCMV or PV demonstrated a low but consistent precursor frequency for lysis of PV-infected targets. These results suggest that there exist remote crossreactivities between non-related viruses and that the specificity of the CTL response to a virus is influenced by previous infections. Two experiments have demonstrated that prior immunity to LCMV enhanced the splenic precursor frequency to PV during a subsequent acute PV infection. In contrast, following the second viral infection (PV) there was an apparent decrease in splenic CTL memory precursors to the first viral infection (LCMV). It would appear that these remote viral cross-reactivities modulate future primary or secondary immune responses.N 328 DISTRIBUTION, TROPISM AND PERSISTENCE OF THEILER'S VIRUS IN THE CNS OF MICE SUSCEPTIBLE AND RESISTANT TO DEMYELINATION, J.

The BeAn strain produces a chronic inflammatory demyelinating disease in CBA mice while BALB/c mice are resistant to demyelination.The neuroanatomical distribution, spread and tropism of GDVII and BeAn have been determined in CBA and BALB/c mice. In both strains of mice, GDVII RNA was detected in specific areas including, cerebral cortex, hippocampus, substantia nigra, brain stem and spinal cord but not in corpus callosum or cerebellum. Large continuous areas were infected suggesting rapid cell to cell spread. Incontrast, in both strains of mice CNS infection with BeAn was focal with scattered, single or small clusters of infected cells. This distribution sugests that BeAn replication is restricted in the CNS. Analysis of BeAn CNS virus titresdemonstrated a difference in clearance in CBA and BALBlc mice. By double labelling, in sifu hybridization and immunostaining GDVII and BeAn RNA could be observed in both neurons and astrocytes in CBA and BALBlc mice. In sifu hybridization and slot blot analysis of RNA demonstrated BeAn virus persistence in the CNS of CBA mice several months after infection.N 327 ROLE OF THE HYPOTHALAMIC-PITUITARY-ADRENAL (HPA) AXIS IN THE PATHOGENESIS OF AN ACUTE VIRAL INFECTION, John Sheridan, Gerlinda Hermann, Cathleen Dobbs, and Ronald Glaser, Departments of Oral Biology, Medical Micro. and Immunol., Ohio State University, Columbus, OH 43210",

In order to evaluate the ability of murine anti-HIV-I IIIB env CTL (CTLenv) to recognize and lyse H N -l infected cells, we have constructed a human cell line (Hu/Dd) expressing both the CD4 receptor and the murine H-2Dd major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I protein. This cell line can be productively infected with HIV-I and can also function as a target for murine CD8+, class I MHC restricted CTL directed against the envelope glycoprotein of HIV-1 IIIB. The ability of BALB/c anti-HIV-l IIlB env CTL to specifically recognize and lyse Humd targec cells infected with divergent HIV-1 strains was tested using both prototypic and clinical HIV-1 strains. CTL generated by immunization of mice with syngeneic cells expressing either the native or V3 loop-deleted (AV3) envelope glycoprotein from HIV-1 IilB were able to recognize and specifically lyse HuDd target cells infected with the HTV-I prototypic isolates; IIIB. MN, WMJ 11, SF2, CC as well as several HlV-1 clinical isolates. These results demonstrate that CTL determinants for HIV-I env exist outside the hypervariable V3 region, anti-HIV-l IIIB env CTL appear to recognize common determinants on diverse HIV-I strains, and that classification of HIV-1 strains based on neutralizing antibody reactivities does not appear to correspond to CTL recognition and lysis. The results suggest that the cell-mediated components of the immune system may have a broader recognition of divergent HIV-I strains than the humoral components.

Japan The murine acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (MAIDS) caused by defective LP-BM5 MuLV is a disease that shows severe immunodeficiency with abnormal lyrnphoproliferation and hypergammaglobulinemia in susceptible C57BL/6 ( 6 6 ) mice. Previous studies have proven that the complex cellular interactions between T and B cells are required for induction and development of MAIDS; B cell abnormalities are shown in the presence of T cells of CD4 phenotype, whereas B cells are required for induction of phenotypic and functional T-cell abnormalities in MAIDS. Interestingly, a recent report indicated that the majority of cells infected with the defective LP-BM5 MuLV belong to B cell lineage, suggesting that B cells trigger the induction and development of MAIDS. To examine the cellular mechanisms of development of MAIDS, we injected LP-BM5 MuLV intraperitoneally into B6 mice bearing the X chromosomelinked immunodeficiency( x i d ). Xid mice lack functionally mature B cells including Ly-1 B cells (also known as 6-1 cells). All B6 mice died by 20 weeks after LP-BM5 MuLV inoculation. In marked contrast, xid mice have continued to survive without any sign of MAIDS-related symptoms till at least 20 weeks after the inoculation. The delayed progression of MAIDS in xid mice was appeared to depend on xid mutation, according to our experiments using both sexes of (B6.xid x 66) F1 and (66 x B6.xid ) F1 mice. Furthermore, Ly-1 B cells, enriched by a fluorescence activated cell sorter, was shown to integrate the defective genome and appeared to be a major virus-infected Bcell population. Our data corroborate that Ly-1 B cells play an important role in the induction and progression of MAIDS.",

This suggests that infection-induced IL-2 may sensitize memory T cells directed against other antigens to die upon exposure to their specific antigen, thereby providing a mechanism for virus-induced immune suppression to unrelated antigens. Upon challenge of LCMV-immune mice with Pichinde virus or vaccinia virus, LCMV-specific memory Cn were reactivated, with some Cn clones derived in limiting dilution assays surprisingly showing cross-reactivity between the viruses. Mice receiving only one virus generated very few if any clones cross-reactive with two viruses, suggesting that the specificity of the CTL response to a virus is influenced by previous infections. We propose that memory Cn with remote cross-reactivities with the inducing antigen are commonly elicited during virus infection and that T cell memory to one virus may be either preserved or deleted by infection with a subsequent virus bearing T cell peptides only remotely cross-reactive with the first virus.

Sera from these mice inhibited gp160mediated syncytia. BA antibody responses in mice are predominantly IgG2a. IgG2a is induced by IFNy, a product of THl cells. It was therefore of interest to determine whether BA and LPS from EA could stimulate T cells to develop into cells of the TH1 phenotype. Purified human T cells, stimulated with Ba or Ba-LPS, secreted IFNy and 112, but not 114 as determined by ELSA and sensitive cellular bio-assays. Both CD4' and CD8* T-cells produced IFNy in response to Ba stimulation, but CD4* cells produced more. These results were confirmed by PCR which showed that BA and LPS from BA elicited 112, I12R and IFNy mRNA but no IL4 mRNA was detected. These data suggest that BA and LPS from BA would be useful as carriers for vaccines when T cell function is decreased and when THI cell expansion and/or IFNy production would be beneficial.HIV 1 VACCINE STIMULATES HUMAN TH-1 CELLS.N410 THE GENERATION OF CYTOTOXIC T LYMPHOCYTES SPECIFIC FOR HIV I PEPTIDES, Ethel J.

Therefore we compared the naive and memory phenotypes of patients who were participating in a gp160 vaccine protocol at three time periods over approximately a one year time period.Methods: Twelve (five presented in this abswct) HIV-infected patients from the phase I gp160 mal were selected based on the following criteria: ininalCD4 > 500, new antibody response to H N epitopes, and new peak LSI > 15 in a proliferation assay to the gp160 vaccine. Fresh heparinized blood specimens were stained w i t h panels of monoclonal antibodies using a three color approach (FITC, PE, PerCP) and processed using a whole blood lysis protocol. Comparison of results was performed with a Wilcoxin signed-rank test.There were no statistically significant differences (p<.05) in anv Darameter between the three time points. All values in the Conclusion: Comparison of naive and memory phenotypes in a group of early stage HIV-infected patients receiving the gp160 vaccine at three time points over approximately one year did not reveal statistically significant differences in any of the phenotypes listed. Specifically. there did not appear to be a depletion of memory CD4 or CDX cells. Analysis of the larger group of 12 patients will be completed shortly. A large blinded, prospective trial is underway with the gp160 vaccine and will better answer whether there are any changes in the naive and memory phenotypes with repeated immunization. Immunization with soluble protein antigens usually stimulates CD4+ but not CD8+ T cells. Immunization of mice with low doses of two viral proteins (i.e., HBV-derived S-antigen [HBsAg] and SV4O-denved T-Ag) primed CD8+ cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTL) in vivo.responders. Target cells pulsed in virro with HBsAg particles were specifically lysed by anti-HBsAg CD8+ CTL. In contrast to the single immunization with \"naked\" S-antigen particles that efficiently primed CD8+ CTL, immunization with Santigen adjuvanted with either aluminium hydroxide, or incomplete Freundvs adjuvants did not induce a CTL respons.
