On the other hand, recent studies showed that impaired pulmonary function is associated with all-cause and cardiovascular mortality [4], correlated with smoking and the components of MetS including obesity [5], type 2 diabetes [6], and insulin resistance [7].",

Positive relationships between impaired lung function and MetS have been shown in cross-sectional studies [8, 9]. Similar associations between the components of the MetS with lung function impairment have also been reported in large cohort studies [10]. Furthermore, dyslipidemia has been observed as a biomarker of abnormal lung function [10, 11], obesity was inversely related to lung function [12], and fasting serum insulin levels were also negatively correlated with lung function. Recent studies have provided evidence indicating that MetS predicted a steeper FEV1 decline over time [10] and was associated with a restrictive ventilatory pattern in patients with the high waist circumference (WC) [13].",

A cross-sectional study with a small sample size reported that a restrictive, but not an obstructive, respiratory pattern was associated with MetS and insulin resistance in elderly people [15]. One study with a large sample size from nationwide health screening centers in Taiwan also demonstrated that obesity and MetS were associated with restrictive lung impairment [8].

Epidemiological studies in adults have also shown that WC, one of the indicators of abdominal adiposity, is a risk factor for pulmonary function deterioration [21, 22]. The underlying mechanisms are associated with excess adipose tissue within abdominal region that exerts a mechanical effect on the lungs, by reducing the capacity of the diaphragm to limit lung inflation, consequently diminishes the chest wall movement [16]. Body fat distributions in men, pre- and postmenopausal women were different, where males generally accumulate more abdominal body fat whereas premenopausal women develop larger lower body fat. Menopause is associated with fat deposition shift to visceral depot and correlated to rapid onset of the metabolic syndrome [23, 24]. Adipose tissue function and deposition differ by gender. Females have more subcutaneous fat prior to menopause and postmenopausal women can have up to twice the amount of visceral adipose tissue than premenopausal women [25]; it is therefore interesting to investigate the relationships between lung function deterioration and the loss of the hormonal protective environment after menopause and the negative effects related to different fat distribution.",

Central obesity may affect ventilator mechanics because it limits diaphragm expansion [16].

However, lung function impairment is developed through multiple and simultaneous mechanisms; prediction using any of these biomarkers should be taken with precautions and should also highlight the importance of MetS in lung function. Particularly, compared with Caucasians, Asians tend to have a higher percentage of body fat and a tendency to more central obesity [15, 33, 34] and that are the most possible mechanisms contributing to airflow limitation [35] and consequent restrictive respiration impairment [22]. Despite this, we know little to adequately quantify central obesity leading to health burden associated with lung function impairment; public health intervention targeted to prevent this modifiable factor might be taken into consideration.",

Our study provided an insight on how obesity contributes to the development of lung function decline and the interplay between MetS and lung function. RLD was not associated with increased probability of having MetS. Risk of losing lung function was greater in the participants with more MetS scores. Because there are relatively few women with metabolic syndrome over the age of 45, the weaker association among women requires further research to draw conclusion.",
