During the prodromal phase, only 1/3 of our patients developed any clinical features suggesting pneumonia, such as cough, sputum, or chest discomfort. Chest radiographs on hospitalization did not reveal any infiltrates in more than 50% of patients. However, chest CT scans, which were performed on hospitalization or within 1\u20132 days, showed infiltrates in the lungs suggesting viral pneumonia in 16/18 (88.9%) patients (Table 1). If we had not taken CT scans of the lungs, we would have easily missed the pneumonia diagnosis.4 The radiological pneumonia from CT scan was detected as early as day 1 of illness onset. The most common findings of CT scans were bilateral, ground-glass opacity in the periphery of the lungs as described in previous studies.91112 Despite radiological pneumonia, the patients were clinically stable and mobile during the first week of illness (\u201cwalking pneumonia\u201d). We assessed the progression of COVID-19 pneumonia using the chest radiograph scoring, and it remained stable during the first week of illness, but increased around the day 7 of illness. This pattern of pneumonia progression was also noted in patients with MERS-CoV infection.18 The early onset of the lung infiltrates and few clinical manifestations of LRT infection may suggest that the virus can invade into the LRT, evading innate immune mechanisms and replicate before adaptive immune response begins to play a role. A tissue biopsy and immunohistopathological studies of the lungs may elucidate this unique and interesting clinical feature of SARS-CoV-2 infection.",

Of the seven infectors of our cohort, two transmitted the virus on the first day of illness, one on the 8th day of illness, and 4 via household transmission. The Ct values of the URT specimens ranged from 18\u201325 in the 4 infectors within the 5 days of illness: 18.74, 18.33, 25.12, and 21.5 for each patient. Our data suggest that the viral shedding from the URT may reach its peak during the first 3-5 days after illness onset. A recent study on virus shedding kinetics is also in line with our finding.24 This \u201cshift to the left\u201d pattern of virus shedding kinetics is strikingly different from that of SARS-CoV, which shows an inverted V pattern, with its peak at day 10 of illness.25 Also of note is that 57.1% (4/7) of infectors had cough or sputum, in contrast to only 23.8% (5/21) of non-infectors having cough. These findings suggest that the transmissions of SARS-CoV-2 may occur easily and begin from the prodromal phase of illness, just like common cold or influenza viruses. Considering that the median time from symptom onset to isolation of the patients was 3 days, and that high titers of virus shedding began from day 1 of illness with the peak around day 3\u20135 of illness, early detection and isolation strategy may be relatively less effective in containing the virus in COVID-19.",

However, we gathered and analyzed the detailed clinical information about all of the first 28 cases nationwide in Republic of Korea. Moreover, some cases were confirmed during the surveillance test for COVID-19 after exposure to SARS-CoV-2. The proportion of elderly patients and frequency of underlying conditions were small, and therefore the first 28 patients from the early phase of the COVID-19 outbreak in Korea had relatively favorable outcomes.26 Most of the enrolled patients would be healthier than the population of recent larger outbreaks showing worse outcomes, mostly in the elderly group. The results regarding outcomes in this study should be interpreted cautiously. In most cases, we did not perform virologic tests for coinfection of other respiratory viruses such as influenza.",
