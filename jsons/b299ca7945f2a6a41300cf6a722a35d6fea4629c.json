Methods: Nasopharyngeal, combined nose and throat swabs, nasopharyngeal aspirates and sputum was collected from persons with suspected SARS-CoV-2 infection, serial dilutions of SARS-CoV-2 viral cultures and synthetic positive controls (gBlocks, Integrated DNA Technologies) were tested using i) AusDiagnostics assay (AusDiagnostics Pty Ltd); ii) in-house developed assays targeting the E and RdRp genes; iii) multiplex PCR assay targeting endemic respiratory viruses. Discrepant SARS-CoV-2 results were resolved by testing the N, ORF1b, ORF1ab and M genes. Results: Of 52 clinical samples collected from 50 persons tested, respiratory viruses were detected in 22 samples (42 %), including SARS CoV-2 (n = 5), rhinovirus (n = 7), enterovirus (n = 5), influenza B (n = 4), hMPV (n = 5), influenza A (n = 2), PIV-2 (n = 1), RSV (n = 2), CoV-NL63 (n = 1) and CoV-229E (n = 1). SARS-CoV-2 was detected in four additional samples by the AusDiagnostics assay. Using the in-house assays as the \"gold standard\", the sensitivity, specificity, positive and negative predictive values of the AusDiagnostics assay was 100 %, 92.16 %, 55.56 % and 100 % respectively.",

            "text": "This study has several limitations. Non-respiratory tract samples were unavailable for testing. There is emerging evidence that there may be prolonged viral shedding in stools from persons with COVID-19 infection, similar to those infected with SARS-CoV [10, 11] . The specific gene target(s) of the AusDiagnostics assay are not known, so we were not able to determine the exact reason for the reduced analytical specificity. The respiratory multiplex assay used in this study is an in-house assay that does not include other endemic coronaviruses such as NL-63, OC43, 229E and HKU-1 so we were unable to verify the results of non-SARS-CoV-2 coronaviruses tested using the AusDiagnostics assay.",

Assay validation and verification are required to ensure that commercial assays used to detect SARS-CoV-2 are fit for purpose. Further data are awaited regarding the use of assays with different SARS-CoV-2 targets, viral loads and kinetics to better guide individual patient management and infection control measures. The optimal testing algorithm to detect SARS-CoV-2 for diagnostic pathology providers and public health reference laboratories will depend on their healthcare systems, laboratory capacity and capability, particularly with the anticipated substantial increase in testing demands as the epidemic progresses and revised case definitions broaden the indications for testing.",
