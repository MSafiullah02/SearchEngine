Here, when we refer to vaccination \"cost\", we imply not only a direct cost, but also the potential risk of by-effects and psychological negative-costs brought about by vaccination. Obviously, there is a conflict between individual and social benefits; in short, a conflict between individual rational choices: trying to avoid vaccination, or everyone taking the vaccine to achieve the fair Pareto optimum, i.e., the best solution where everyone equally bears the cost to maintain public goods, namely the herd immunity in this context (see Fig. 4 .2). This conflict is why we introduce evolutionary game theory into epidemiology; vaccination can be viewed as a game on a complex social network. This specific structure of the social dilemma has been called a vaccination dilemma and has been modeled in the framework of the vaccination game, explained later. However, vaccination is not an ultimate solution. In some cases, perhaps stochastically, the injection of a vaccine into a human body is not always able to establish immunity because of the imperfectness of the vaccination. Even in such an unwilling case, the vaccine may work to reduce the probability of being infected brought about by physical contact with people around the focal agent in his social network.

In this metaphor, firing is spreading a disease, and a perfectly vaccinated agent is represented by the tree in the box usually voluntary, despite some national or local governments providing subsidies for it. Therefore, decision making at the individual level may be the result of a tradeoff between protection and the perceived risks and costs of vaccination and infection. Furthermore, an individual's decision may be influenced by the vaccination behaviors of others. 2 The only example of a vaccination campaign that has completely eradicated a vaccine-preventable disease is smallpox, while cyclic (seasonal) epidemics of other infectious diseases, such as flu-like pathogens and influenza, remain a serious threat to humanity.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 878, "end": 879, "text": "2", "ref_id": null}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Epidemiological Model and Vaccination Game"}, {"text": "One major reason for the difficulty in eradicating vaccine-preventable diseases is related to an inherent vaccination dilemma, sometimes called the \"paradox in epidemiology\". As vaccination coverage increases over a population, the proportion of immunized individuals finally exceeds a critical level above which the disease can no longer persist; this point is called herd immunity, as mentioned above. Once herd immunity is attained, the remaining unvaccinated individuals are quite unlikely to become infected since they are indirectly protected by vaccinated individuals. Thus, unvaccinated individuals obtain benefits from the herd immunity without considering the perceived risks associated with vaccination, such as complications, side effects, and financial costs. There is less incentive for them to get vaccinated, and Fig. 4 .2 Scheme of the social dilemma working behind the vaccination dilemma then, the so-called first-order free-rider problem 3 arises. Some reports suggest that the welfare of a society can be threatened if too many individuals perceive the herd immunity as a public good. 4 As a result, too much self-interest destabilizes the herdimmunity state, and the disease resurges. This paradox makes complete eradication of the disease difficult under a voluntary vaccination policy, and causes a conflict between the optimal vaccination behavior for each individual and the sufficient level of vaccination needed to protect the whole society via the herd immunity. 5 In addition, the number of vaccinated individuals may be reduced by underestimates of infection risk due to lack of knowledge about the disease and/or by overestimation of vaccine risk based on scientifically groundless information. 6 Interrelations among vaccination coverage, disease prevalence, and the vaccination behaviors of individuals are complicated, and we should duplicate and dynamically as well as quantitatively predict the consequences of these interrelations if we intend to develop effective public-health measures for preventing epidemics of infectious diseases. In this regard, many studies of the vaccination dilemma have applied a game-theoretic framework to a population wherein each individual tries to maximize his or her own payoff. These studies have provided highly fruitful results. 7 Let us call this framework the \"vaccination game\", where both the epidemiological dynamics and the dynamics of the human decision-making process are simultaneously and interdependently considered.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 829, "end": 835, "text": "Fig. 4", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1106, "end": 1107, "text": "4", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1492, "end": 1493, "text": "5", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1727, "end": 1728, "text": "6", "ref_id": null}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Epidemiological Model and Vaccination Game"}, {"text": "Some of the previous game-theoretic analyses of vaccination behavior have assumed a static game wherein individuals always act with perfect information about their probability of becoming infected. In reality, individuals cannot precisely know this probability. Moreover, the game should allow individuals to update their strategies through learning by imitating others who appear to have adopted more successful strategies. In this context, imitating others means adapting one's strategy based on one's own personal experience and information from media (the former and latter can be called active and passive information, respectively). Also, it is very likely that would be someone who acts opposite to what surrounding people do, because non-vaccination would cost a player nothing if his all neighbors were vaccinating. 8 As those, concerning how an individual updates his own decision, 3 In 2 \u00c2 2 games, a defector who is harmful to cooperators is called a first-order free-rider. When a costly punishment scheme for defectors exists, there can be defined a strategy called the \"masked good guy\", who cooperates with others but never punishes defectors; such an individual is called a second-order free-rider. There is much literature on the second-order free-rider problem. For example, Olson (1965) , Axelrod (1986) , Yamagishi (1986) . 4 Asch et al. (1994) . 5 Although there are many good references on this issue, several representative ones are cited here.

Bauch (2005) . 8 Such behavior might be meaningful in the context of the minority game. See the following report. not only imitating others; either his neighbors or media, but also drawing his specific decision based on the observation around him, there might be diverse ways in a real world. To describe this process explicitly, we should construct an appropriate model that combines mathematical epidemiological dynamics with game-theoretic dynamics, taking account of the various rules for strategy adapting. For example, Bauch constructed and analyzed a model that combines epidemiological dynamics with replicator dynamics of evolutionary game theory to capture the imitative behavior of individuals during outbreaks of diseases; he found that imitative behavior provokes periodic outbreaks of such diseases 7 . Vardavas et al. proposed an individual-level adaptive decision-making model that was inspired by a minority-game methodology. 9 By solving the model numerically and analytically, they showed that incentive-based vaccination programs are indispensable for controlling epidemics of infectious disease but that misuse of these programs may lead to a severe epidemic. These studies assumed that the population is homogeneously mixed and that individuals are fully rational in the sense that they make decisions to pursue maximum personal utility based on their perceived risks. Yet, in reality, there are always spatial structures for networks of both disease transmission and an individual's contacts, and any individual's behavior is not completely rational. Accordingly, Fu et al., for example, elevated a model to that of evolutionary game theory to explore the effects of individual adaptation behavior and population structure upon vaccination when a population is faced with an epidemic of an infectious disease. 10 Let us revisit the term paradox in epidemiology in the context of a gametheoretical application. Any rational individual has a strong incentive to exploit the public good by free-riding on herd immunity. However, this incentive, wherein the individual pays nothing but still obtains a benefit, only works as long as the majority of the community spontaneously receive the vaccination. By contrast, if the majority disregards vaccination, then doing nothing is no longer a better option because infection is likely. In this case, spontaneous vaccination becomes the rational option. This difference implies that the best choice for an individual is to always adopt the strategy of the social minority; either free-ride when the herd immunity is well established or take the vaccination when most people neglect to do so. This situation obviously contains the structure of a minority game, as Vardavas pointed out 8 . A minority game, 11 originally defined as the El Farol Bar problem, 12 is a typical social dilemma that can be observed in many real situations. The most heavily concentrated applications are in financial markets. In a minority game, any individual has an incentive to adopt the strategy of the minority under any circumstance. This duality might be interpreted as a Chicken-type dilemma wherein the fair Pareto optimum is realized when two strategies coexist, as discussed in Chap. 2.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 892, "end": 893, "text": "3", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1294, "end": 1306, "text": "Olson (1965)", "ref_id": "BIBREF33"}, {"start": 1309, "end": 1323, "text": "Axelrod (1986)", "ref_id": "BIBREF2"}, {"start": 1326, "end": 1342, "text": "Yamagishi (1986)", "ref_id": "BIBREF39"}, {"start": 1347, "end": 1365, "text": "Asch et al.

Before the discussion, let us introduce one assumption that is substantially important in relation to vaccination. So far, we have implicitly presumed that a vaccination brings an idealized perfect immunity whenever performed. In reality, for infectious diseases such as flu, measles, malaria, and HIV, vaccination does not work perfectly, giving rise to the concept of the \"effectiveness\" of a vaccination. This presumes a situation in which some vaccinated agents acquire immunity with effectiveness probability 14 e; meanwhile, the remaining agents fail to acquire immunity with probability 1 \u00c0 e. This can be likened to a lottery that pays out either 100% or 0% of the prize fund according to the probability of winning. Meanwhile, there are protective measures other than vaccination whose efficacy can also be expressed probabilistically. In particular, we are interested in intermediate measures such as wearing masks, gargling, and hand washing that offer partial protection against infection while costing less than vaccination. Some kinds of vaccination rather work to reduce the contagious probability, rather than offering a perfect immunity with a certain probability. Such a mechanism including intermediate measures is called \"defense against contagion\" in the following text. Some recent studies 15,16,17 have proposed representing a measure of defense against contagion by reducing the risk of infection (denoted as \u03b7). Iwamura et al. 16 assumed a lower infection risk in their spatial version of the vaccination game, which they implemented by introducing a reduced infection rate per day per person into the SIR dynamics on an underlying network by means of the Gillespie algorithm. 18 Those two concepts, shown schematically in Fig. 4 .3, seem analogous in the sense that one can avoid an infection stochastically, but they definitely differ in how they actually work.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 1592, "end": 1594, "text": "16", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1821, "end": 1844, "text": "Gillespie algorithm. 18", "ref_id": null}], "ref_spans": [{"start": 1888, "end": 1894, "text": "Fig. 4", "ref_id": "FIGREF3"}], "section": "SIR/V (SVIR) Model for an Infinite & Well-Mixed Population 13"}, {"text": "We take the SIR model 19 as the baseline and extend it to consider either SIR/V or SVIR dynamics including vaccinators as SIR variants.

In the default case, as a general tendency, we see that larger final epidemic sizes with small timefluctuations (compare Case 1 (Fig. 4 .12b) and Case 2 ( Fig. 4.12c) ) result from lower but more stable vaccination coverage. Conversely, in Case 2 and more clearly in Case 1, relatively higher and stable vaccination coverage successfully results in stably lower final epidemic sizes. Interestingly, the situation we observe in Cases This fluctuation may unwillingly cause the \"vaccination-effectiveness\" result mentioned above, because it brings a lower social payoff than the default model despite higher vaccination coverage and lower average final epidemic size for 0.3 C r 0.6. One plausible reason why these settings, especially those of Case 4, bring about such acute two-time-step flipping can be formulated as follows. From the inherent nature of its definition, Case 4 sees the non-vaccination strategy as being more advantageous than the vaccination strategy if there are no infected neighbors. Our model framework in not only Case 4 but also in other cases urges infected agents to adopt a vaccination strategy in the next time-step. This implies that agents in Case 4 tend to adopt the defective strategy (non-vaccination) if the outcome of the current time-step is good, whereas they adopt a cooperative strategy (vaccination) if the outcome is bad. This specific feature consequently results in the time flipping that was also observed in Win-Stay and Lose-Shift (WSLS) 29 of PD games and is a typical self-reflecting strategy (taking either the same offer to the current one or its opposite), unlike the copying-from-others' strategy seen in tit-for-tat games. As confirmed above, Cases 3 and 4 contain some fragments of a \"self-reflecting strategy.\" One recent study 30 reports that some strategic adaptations based on the concept of WSLS can enhance cooperation for spatial-PD games. This is because sparsely located cooperative agents showing time-flipping manners with timealternating defection are able to realize a reasonable amount of mutual reciprocity. This is interesting because the mechanism appears to be very different from the usual network reciprocity as previously understood, in which a situation of compactly clustered cooperators would be more likely to result in efficient network reciprocity.

They defined the total social cost as the sum of the infection and vaccination costs paid by each individual. In this sense, their subsidy was externalized as a \"gift-of-nature\".

Thus, TSP can be thought of as an appropriate index for evaluating the social efficiency of a subsidy policy in the present study. We do not consider the additional cost burden levied on each individual, TAX, when evaluating each individual's payoff, because, in the real world, we cannot recognize exactly how much tax each individual has paid specifically for subsidies, as tax is generally levied.

One occurs when a smaller vaccination cost and subsidy budget are presumed. Another takes place when a larger vaccination cost and subsidy budget are presumed. The former accords with regions of negative-VC difference (Fig. 4.19a) and positive-FES difference (Fig. 4.19b) ; in this region, subsidies going to defective individuals who have no intention of vaccinating eventually reduce the number of voluntary vaccinators (e.g., self-financed vaccinators), leading to a wider spread of disease and pushing up the total social cost due to a larger number of infectious individuals. This is quite ironic from the viewpoint of social context. The implication drawn from this particular case is that too small of a budget for the subsidy policy in the case of a relatively smaller vaccination cost fails to increase the number of voluntary vaccinators, but rather causes individuals to refrain from cooperating in establishing a herd immunity. Unlike the first negative region with a smaller budget, the second negative region with too much of a subsidy in the case of a relatively larger vaccination cost (Fig. 4.27c) successfully realizes a larger VC (Fig. 4.19a ) and smaller FES (Fig. 4.19b) vis-\u00e0-vis the default case. This fact proves that overspending on the financial support brings too much vaccinators including forcefully committing individuals. It is obviously over the socially approved level whereat the cost of infection of society as a whole is balanced by the cost of vaccination including a subsidy policy (which may be the social optimum).

Interestingly, Model A-3 (Fig. 4.21) , where financial support is given only to cooperative individuals, does not incur the first negative region of TSP difference. This suggests that, to increase the number of voluntary vaccinators, helping potential vaccinators rather than helping potential social-defectors aiming to free-ride on herd immunity would be more beneficial. Relating to this, comparison of Fig. 4.19 with Fig. 4 .20 implies that the result of helping potential social defectors brings almost no difference from that of targeting any arbitrary people. Figure 4 .22 shows the result when the Model-B discount policy is presumed. This should be compared with Fig. 4 .21 on the grounds that target individuals are potential cooperators (the discount becomes meaningful only when an individual voluntarily vaccinates). The result shows no specific difference between those two policies. As long as the intent is to increase the number of voluntary vaccinators in a society, a \"priority system\" distributing free tickets to some potential vaccinators does not differ in effect from an \"egalitarian system\" allowing a certain discount (distributing discount coupons) to all potential vaccinators. Figure 4 .23 highlights the difference in strategy updating. This should be compared with Fig. 4 .19. With presuming SB-RA relying on global information when updating strategy, the first negative region with a small budget is slightly extended compared with IB-RA relying on local information (only referring to the neighbors' payoff), whereas the second negative region with a too-high budget shrinks slightly vis-\u00e0-vis IB-RA. Yet, as a whole, the difference between those two strategy-updating rules looks small, which indicates whether an individual decision referring to global or only local information makes a less-significant difference in the social cost. Figures 4.24 and 4 .25 compare the topological contributions. Figure 4 .24 presumes RRG while Fig. 4 .25 show the case of BA-SF, which should be also compared with Fig. 4.19 . The comparison between Fig. 4.19 and Fig. 4 .24 confirms that the effect of random links results in a quite large difference from the case of a regular & homogeneous network (lattice; Fig. 4.19) . The existence of random links devastates the efficiency of subsidy policy, resulting from the significantly wider negative regions compared with those observed in Fig. 4.19 . In particular, the first negative region with a smaller budget spreads to much larger C r as well as larger \u03c3. Moreover, comparing RRG (Fig. 4.24) with BA-SF (Fig. 4.25) , we should note that Models B, lattice, and IB-RA are presumed the latter shows worse performance than the former. Thus, not only the existence of random links but also the non-uniform degree distribution undermines to the subsidy system. As is commonly recognized, human social networks can feature scale-free degree distributions, unlike small-world characteristics. 42 Recalling this fact, we should note the important result observed in Fig. 4 .25c that the subsidy works inversely to reduce the total social cost when almost any vaccination-cost range (C r < 0.9) and feasibly realistic budget size (\u03c3 < 0.5) are presumed, which may be meaningful from the standpoint of social applications. Figure 4 .26 provides the results when BA-SF and SB-RA are presumed. Comparing with Fig. 4 .25, we should note that, unlike the lattice case (comparison between Figs. 4.19 and 4.23), BA-SF causes a relatively significant difference between the two different update rules. Contrasting with the lattice case, the introduction of global information (Fig. 4.26) somewhat relaxes the drawbacks of subsidy introduction.

Qualitatively, both show the same tendency. Differences in detail level come from finite resolution and insufficient population, as well as insufficient average degree in the simulation, which seems to some extent inevitable. Thus, we conclude that our theoretical model well-reproduces the MAS-simulation result. Let us compare the subsidy systems assuming perfect vaccination (e \u00bc 1.0) and IB-RA in Fig. 4 .29. Focusing on TSP under Models A-1 and A-2, the negative region exists in a relatively smaller subsidy size of \u03c3(hereafter, the first negative region) and a larger subsidy size of \u03c3, dovetailed with a higher vaccination cost (hereafter, second negative region). In the first negative region, a subsidy going to non-vaccinators (i.e., defectors) counterproductively works to suppress the social cost because being a defector becomes cost-advantageous (since they may avoid infection by being given free-tickets), reducing the fraction of cooperators (i.e., vaccinators) as compared with the default case. As a consequence, the number of self-financed vaccinators comes down, worsening the social efficiency. On the other hand, in the second negative region, due to a relatively higher vaccination cost compared to disease cost, some reasonable number of people getting infected is rather beneficial to the entire society, rather than spending too much on vaccination. Furthermore, although the general tendencies of Models A-1 and A-2 are the same, more deliberate comparison reveals that Model A-2 more badly works so that makes the first negative region more red than Model A-1 does. Namely, Model A-2 delivers all free-tickets to non-vaccinators, which consequently reduces self-financed vaccinators more significantly than does Model A-1. Therefore, one important social implication that can be noted is that a subsidy helping people who potentially aim to free-ride on the public good devastates social efficiently. A subsidy system should be based on the principle that \"heaven helps those who help themselves\". As we confirm latter in the discussion on Models A-3 and B, a subsidy system focused only on potential vaccinators more efficiently suppresses the total social cost vis-avis the default case.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [{"start": 111, "end": 117, "text": "Fig. 4", "ref_id": "FIGREF3"}, {"start": 146, "end": 152, "text": "Fig. 4", "ref_id": "FIGREF3"}, {"start": 573, "end": 579, "text": "Fig. 4", "ref_id": "FIGREF3"}], "section": "Global Time Evolution"}, {"text": "Recalling what happens when only non-vaccinators are subsidized, let us move on to Models A-3 and B, where only vaccinators are subsidized.

As a whole, those two subsidy models outperform other models (Models A-1 and A-2). Hence, we would say that a subsidy policy focused only on potential vaccinators should be adopted.

Pairs of the broken-line boxes in Models A-3 and B prove this, where the region in Model A-3 looks bluer than that by Model B. One plausible cause for this tendency is that distributing free tickets only to limited eligible individuals drives people to vaccinate (increasing self-financed vaccinators) more significantly than offering a discount coupon to all eligible individuals, due to the non-linearity of the Fermi function considered when updating a strategy.

Note that the state-transition probability of Model A-3 is larger than that of Model B, which is attributed to the reduction in price by a free-ticket or discount-coupon. Since the same \u03c3 is presumed for this comparison, the fraction (number) of vaccinators given free-tickets in Model A-3 is less than that given discount-coupons (that is consistent with the entire number of vaccinators) in Model B, which is considered in the final dynamical equations (Eq.

Interestingly, in the case assuming e \u00bc 0.4 and IB-RA, both regions in which introducing a subsidy is not justified are insensitive to \u03c3. In fact, if C r becomes more than 0.6, the subsidy obviously deteriorates the social efficiency regardless of the size of subsidy. For C r below 0.2, this deterioration effect becomes more slight. Figures 4.31 and 4 .32, presuming SB-RA, present a quite different picture than Figs. 4.29 and 4.30, resulting from the difference in the strategy-update rules. Let us compare our respective TSPs with e \u00bc 0.4. The black and gray boxes indicate the first and second negative regions. As discussed above, the first negative region results from the situation whereby subsidizing non-vaccinators hampers the increase of self-financed vaccinators, while the second region is brought about by the fact that spending too much on vaccination becomes less beneficial on the whole than allowing a reasonable level of infectious individuals. Although the first negative regions (black boxes) are at comparable levels, the second negative region (gray box) of Fig. 4 .32 is less than that of Fig. 4 .30, only appearing at larger \u03c3and larger C r . Thus, sharing global information during strategy-updating events (SB-RA) helps to justify a subsidy system. Observing carefully, we can note that the range of vaccination costs justifying subsidies (colored blue) is insensitive to \u03c3; however, although it clearly appears around 0.2 C r 0.5 in Fig. 4 .30, it almost disappears in Fig. 4 .32. If we make the same comparison for Model A-2 in Figs. 4.30 and 4.32 (see black and gray boxes in respective right panels), we find the same behavior. There is none of any range of vaccination cost justifying subsidy insensitive to \u03c3 in Model A-2 of Figs. 4.31 and 4.32. Moreover, remarkably, in the right-hand panel of Model A-2 in Fig. 4 .32, there is almost no parameter region in which a subsidy is justified.
