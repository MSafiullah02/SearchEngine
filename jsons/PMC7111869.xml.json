IBD is an intractable autoimmune disease and immunosuppressive drugs are used to reduce inflammation (Allenspach et al., 2006; Dossin and Lavoue, 2011). However, no alternative treatments exist for dogs with IBD that do not respond to the conventional therapies. Therefore, mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) that can effectively modulate inflammation might be an alternative therapeutic option (Iyer and Rojas, 2008).",

Therefore, MSCs exert strong anti-inflammatory effects, although injected MSCs did not migrate into inflamed tissue in a previous study (Sala et al., 2015). Kang et al. and Chae et al. also demonstrated that canine and feline MSCs secrete soluble immunomodulatory factors (Chae et al., 2017; Kang et al., 2008). In addition, our previous studies have shown that TSG-6 released from human and canine MSCs ameliorates colitis in mice (Song et al., 2018; Song et al., 2017b).",

The dogs were negative for canine parvovirus, canine coronavirus, and canine distemper virus infections. MSCs were isolated and cultured as previously described (Kim et al., 2016). Briefly, adipose tissue samples were washed five times in Dulbecco's phosphate buffered saline (DPBS; PAN-Biotech, Aidenbach, Germany) containing 1% penicillin-streptomycin (PS; PAN-Biotech), and cut into small pieces in a petri dish. The samples were digested with collagenase type IA (0.1%, Gibco/Life Technologies, Carlsbad, CA, USA) for 60 min at 37 \u00b0C. The samples were neutralized with Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM; PAN-Biotech) containing 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS; PAN-Biotech). After centrifuging the adipose tissue mixture at 1200 \u00d7g for 5 min, the pellet containing MSCs was passed through a 70-\u03bcm cell strainer (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Rockford, IL, USA) to remove undigested debris. Cells were resuspended in DMEM containing 10% FBS and 1% PS, seeded onto a cell culture dish at a density of 3000 cells/cm2, and incubated at 37 \u00b0C and 5% CO2. After 5 days, cultures were washed with DPBS to remove non-adherent cells and incubated with fresh medium. The culture medium was changed every 2\u20133 days until cells reached 70\u201380% confluence. The cells were then subcultured and seeded at a density of 10,000 cells/cm2 in culture dishes.",

All procedures involving mice were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee of Seoul National University (protocol no. SNU-171123-2), and the protocols were performed in accordance with approved guidelines. Two different mouse models for IBD were used for this study (dextran sulfate sodium (DSS)-, and dinitrobenzene sulfonic acid (DNBS)-induced colitis models), and each colitis model was made as previously described (Kim et al., 2013; Mart\u00edn et al., 2014; Morampudi et al., 2014; Solomon et al., 2010). For the first experiment, colitis was induced by 3% DSS (36\u201350 kDa; MP Biomedical, Solon, OH, USA) in the drinking water from day 0 to day 7, whereas mice offered normal water were used as the naive group. The following experiments were performed on day 1: cAT-MSCs (2 \u00d7 106) stimulated with TNF-\u03b1 in 200 \u03bcL PBS; cAT-MSCs (2 \u00d7 106) in 200 \u03bcL PBS; or an identical volume of PBS was injected intraperitoneally into the DSS-induced colitis mice. For this experiment, mice were randomly divided to the following four groups: Na\u00efve (n = 4), DSS + PBS (n = 6), DSS + cAT-MSC (n = 6), DSS+ TNF-\u03b1-cAT-MSC (n = 6). For the second experiment, DNBS (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA) colitis was induced by rectal administration of DNBS (5 mg/mouse in 50% ethanol) into mice. Six hours after DNBS infusion, cAT-MSCs were administered intraperitoneally as described above. For this experiment, mice were divided into five groups: Na\u00efve (n = 4), Ethanol (sham; n = 4), DNBS+PBS (n = 6), DNBS+cAT-MSC (n = 6), DNBS+TNF-\u03b1-cAT-MSC (n = 6).

Our previous studies have demonstrated that TSG-6 released from human and canine MSCs plays a crucial role in immunomodulation by inducing an M2 macrophage switch (Song et al., 2018; Song et al., 2017b). In addition, we have shown that canine MSCs stimulated with TNF-\u03b1 and IFN-\u03b3 released higher concentration of PGE2 which exert anti-inflammatory effects (Yang et al., 2018). Therefore, by up-regulating the secretion of theses soluble factors, MSCs can enhance the immunomodulatory effects.

It is well-established that two types of macrophages (M1 and M2) are observed in inflamed tissues (Mosser and Edwards, 2008; Stout and Suttles, 2004) and these cells play an important role in regulating inflammatory responses. Melief et al. demonstrated that human MSCs promote the transition of monocytes into CD206+ M2 macrophages, and consequently increase Foxp3+ regulatory T cells (Melief et al., 2013). In addition, recent studies have revealed that soluble factors (such as TSG-6 and PGE2) released from human MSCs could promote the M2 macrophage phenotype and reduce inflammation in mouse models of rheumatoid arthritis, wound healing, and IBD (Shin et al., 2016; Song et al., 2017b; Zhang et al., 2010). Additionally, we previously demonstrated that TSG-6 released from canine MSCs can induce M2 macrophage phenotypic changes in vitro and in vivo (Song et al., 2018). In this study, TNF-\u03b1 stimulated cAT-MSCs increased macrophage alteration to the M2 phenotype (F4/80+/CD206+) in the colons of mice with IBD, whereas numbers of M1 macrophages (F4/80+/iNOS+) decreased in the inflamed colons. Consistent with previous studies and our results, TNF-\u03b1-stimulated cAT-MSCs reduced inflammation through altering macrophage phenotypic changes by secreting higher concentrations of TSG-6 and PGE2.",

For example, MSCs may stimulate epithelial regeneration (S\u00e9mont et al., 2013; S\u00e9mont et al., 2006; Valcz et al., 2011). It is well-established that MSCs upregulate Ki67+ cells in inflamed tissues (Nakagawa et al., 2015; Wu et al., 2007). In addition, Chen et al. demonstrated that MSCs increase Lgr5+ intestinal stem cells in colonic tissues of IBD model mice (Chen et al., 2013). Another potential mechanism of MSC-dependent improvement in IBD involves microbiome changes. However, in this study, TNF-\u03b1-stimulated MSCs, which release higher concentrations of soluble immunomodulatory factors, showed further improved colitis in mice (Soontararak et al., 2018). Therefore, we demonstrated here that the anti-inflammatory effects of MSCs play an important role in their overall therapeutic effects on colitis, although MSCs might reduce IBD through various mechanisms.",
