OL cells support both natural and experimental infection with several neurotropic NNS RNA viruses including BDV (Ibrahim et al., 2002, Koster-Patzlaff et al., 2007), canine distemper virus (Muller et al., 1995), and measles virus (Baczko et al., 1988). Laboratory-adapted and wild-type (e.g. human) BDV strains have been shown to differentially affect various host cell types (Li et al., 2013, Poenisch et al., 2009, Williams et al., 2008, Wu et al., 2013). Using a natural human BDV strain appeared particularly advantageous to provide better insight into the pathological consequences of human OL cell infection than laboratory strains from animal origin. Moreover, using a virus which had been isolated during an acute depressive episode of a bipolar patient should eventually support our understanding of BDV\u05f3s impact on neuropathogenesis.",

H4K16 acetylation regulates cellular lifespan because the level of H4K16 acetylation increased with age examined in yeast cells (Dang et al., 2009). Deregulated H4K12 acetylation may represent an early biomarker of an impaired genome-environment interaction in the aging mouse brain because aged mice display a specific deregulation of H4K12 acetylation and fail to initiate a hippocampal gene expression program associated with memory consolidation during learning. Moreover, restoration of physiological H4K12 acetylation reinstates the expression of learning-induced genes and leads to the recovery of cognitive abilities (Peleg et al., 2010). Further studies should investigate the biological function of the histone specific-site acetylation altered by BDV infection.",

GCN5 and PCAF specifically promote acetylation on H3K9, H3K14, H4K8, and H4K16. Deletion of GCN5/PCAF in cells reduces acetylation on H3K9 and correlates with nuclear receptor target gene activation at some level (Jin et al., 2011). The GCN5/PCAF have a preference for H3K14 (Grant et al., 1999), and also acetylate H4K8 and H4K16 to a relatively slight degree (Kuo et al., 1996, Schiltz et al., 1999). By Western blotting, we found that the expression levels of GCN5 and PCAF were downregulated, consistent with the decreased acelytation of H3K14 and H4K16 in response to BDV infection. Interestingly, acetylation of H3K9 and H4K8 was not decreased here, suggesting that other factors possibly impacted acetylation of two sites in BDV-infected OL cells.",

HDACs 1, 2, and 3 belong to class I and localize to the nucleus. HDACs 4, 5, and 7 belong to class II. Class II HDACs are mainly known for their participation in controlling cell differentiation through regulation of transcription myocyte enhancer factor 2 activity, involved in muscle development and neuronal survival (Lomonte et al., 2004). In addition, HDAC4, HDAC5, and HDAC7 are known to shuttle between the cytoplasm and the nucleus (Kao et al., 2001, McKinsey et al., 2000). In this study, western blotting analysis showed that the expression level of HDACs 4 and 7 were increased in BDV-infected OL cells, while few changes were observed in HDACs 1, 2, 3, and 5. These results suggest that class II HDACs 4 and 7 may pose specific roles in histone lysine acetylation profiles in BDV-infected OL cells. Further studies should primarily investigate whether the shuttle function of HDACs 4 or 7 is related to the nuclear import and export of BDV proteins (Kobayashi et al., 2001). It could be suggested that they both deacetylate non-histone and histone substrates, thereby modulating histone acetylation levels which subsequently impact the proteome profile of the host cell. Sirtuins are structurally and mechanistically different from other HDAC classes; accordingly, their primary substrates do not appear to be the histone proteins (Luo et al., 2001, Vaziri et al., 2001). By Western blotting, SIRT1 and SIRT2 were found with upregulated expression levels in BDV-infected OL cells, suggesting that acetylation profile of non-histone subtrates could be modulated through changing class III HADCs.",

As these processes intimately involve the plasma and nuclear membranes, changes in membrane protein expression should be associated with BDV infection. This study confirms that BDV infection has a profound impact on membrane-associated proteins in Q4, most of which were upregulated in response to BDV infection. Proteins in Q4 were also enriched for immune response; this finding may be related to the aforementioned changes in membrane protein expression considering the pivotal function of membrane proteins in the immune response. As successful viral infection and replication requires evasion from the host immune response, it is reasonable to surmise that BDV would affect host cellular proteins with an antiviral immune response function.",

BDV infection was found to affect histone acetylation of specific lysine residues. Moreover, BDV infection affected the expression of many transcription factors, several HATs and HDACs.

This strain dated back to 1996 and could be recovered from freshly isolated white blood cells of a female bipolar I disorder patient in Germany who was admitted to hospital during a severe depressive episode. The isolation procedure had required laborious co-cultivating of patient\u05f3s PBMCs with human oligodendroglia (OL) cells. After at least 10\u201312 blind passages which did not exhibit viral growth, infectious human virus had finally been harvested and subsequently passaged to further characterization and storage. The isolation protocol of BDV strain Hu-H1 and two other isolates have been described in full detail in the original publication (Bode et al., 1996). Strain Hu-H1 and other two isolates were originating from PBMC samples which were testing positive for BDV RNA and protein. Further molecular characterization had revealed that corresponding RNAs (of PBMC and isolate) displayed identical nucleotide sequences, proving the authenticity of the human isolates. Moreover, the isolates displayed few but meaningful point mutations which differentiated them from each other and from laboratory strain V and a second lab strain (He/80) (de la Torre et al., 1996b). Further biological characterization had revealed that strain Hu-H1 and other two human strains displayed differing pathogenicity in animal experiments, namely inducing behavioral changes in rabbits but no deadly disease as compared to str. V (Bode et al., 1996).",
