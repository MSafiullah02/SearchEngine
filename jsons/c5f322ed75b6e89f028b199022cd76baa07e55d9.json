During systematic increases in the NAVA level, feedback-controlled down-regulation of the EAdi results in a characteristic two-phased response in P aw and tidal volume (Vt). The transition from the 1st to the 2nd response phase allows identification of adequate unloading of the respiratory muscles with NAVA (NAVA A L ). We aimed to develop and validate a mathematical algorithm to identify NAVA A L . P aw , Vt, and EAdi were recorded while systematically increasing the NAVA level in 19 adult patients. In a multistep approach, inspiratory P aw peaks were first identified by dividing the EAdi into inspiratory portions using Gaussian mixture modeling. Two polynomials were then fitted onto the curves of both P aw peaks and Vt. The beginning of the P aw and Vt plateaus, and thus NAVA A L , was identified at the minimum of squared polynomial derivative and polynomial fitting errors. A graphical user interface was developed in the Matlab computing environment. Median NAVA A L visually estimated by 18 independent physicians was 2.7 (range 0.4 to 5.8) cm\u00b7H 2 O/\u03bcV and identified by our model was 2.6 (range 0.6 to 5.0) cm\u00b7H 2 O/\u03bcV. NAVA A L identified by our model was below the range of visually estimated NAVA A L in two instances and was above in one instance. We conclude that our model identifies NAVA A L in most instances with acceptable accuracy for application in clinical routine and research.",

            "text": "EAdi is a validated measure of global respiratory drive that is controlled via lung-protective feedback mechanisms, which integrate information from pulmonary and extrapulmonary mechanoreceptors, from blood gases, and from voluntary input [2] - [5] . If the assist delivered with NAVA exceeds the subject's respiratory demand, EAdi is reflexively down regulated, resulting in less assist for the same NAVA level and vice versa [6] - [11] . Several experimental and clinical studies with NAVA demonstrated that during ramp increases in the NAVA level, transpulmonary pressure and tidal volume (Vt) initially increase (1st response) before being limited due to feedback-controlled downregulation of EAdi (2nd response) [6] , [7] , [9] - [11] . Hence, the breathing pattern response to systematic increases in the NAVA level is directed towards prevention of lung overdistension [6] - [10] , [12] . Interestingly, in rabbits loaded with various inspiratory resistors, the transition from the 1st to the 2nd response phase occurred when the animals' inspiratory effort was reduced to levels similar to those observed during spontaneous breathing (i.e., when breathing without assist and without additional load) [10] . Thus the transition from the 1st to the 2nd response phase presumably reflects the transition from an initial insufficient ventilatory assist to an adequate level of respiratory muscle unloading (NAVA AL ). Therefore, reliable identification of NAVA AL during a NAVA level titration procedure is of potential clinical relevance, since it may help to individualize the support level during NAVA.",

The principles of such a NAVA level titration [1] . The diaphragm electrical activity (EAdi) derived from electrodes on a naso-gastric feeding tube is first amplified and processed. The EAdi signal is then multiplied by an adjustable gain factor (NAVA level) and used to control the pressure generator of a mechanical ventilator. Thus, NAVA delivers pressure to the airways (P aw ) in direct synchrony and linear proportionality to the patient's neural inspiratory drive as reflected by the EAdi (P aw (t) = EAdi(t) \u00b7 NAVA level (t). Vt = tidal volume. NAVA A L = NAVA level that provides adequate unloading of respiratory muscles. Example of a NAVA level titration session as used for estimating NAVA A L (a) visually or (b) with the proposed algorithm. NAVA A L refers to the adequate NAVA level early after the transition from the initial steep increase in P aw (n) and Vt(n), referred to as 1st response, to the less steep increase or plateau in P aw (n) and Vt(n), referred to as 2nd response [6] - [11] . Flow(n) is the air flow. In (a), the Vt(n) is estimated on a breath-by-breath basis. If there is false triggering of the ventilator (e.g., based on an EAdi artifact) a minimal Vt (normally a few milliliters) is delivered. Since there is no minimal threshold for Vt, the ventilator displays whatever Vt(n) is delivered in the graph. In (b), the Vt(n) is calculated as the integral of Flow(n) per inspiration as it is described in Section II-B (Step 4A).",

In order to calculate the correlation between NAVA AL , as identified by the observers with the results of our L.B., a physician) and by 17 independent physicians based on visual inspection of the airway pressure (P aw ) and tidal volume (Vt) response to systematic increases in the NAVA level (circles) and NAVA A L identified by the algorithm described in this paper (squares). algorithm, we computed the multiple correlation coefficient (MCC) [16] . MCC ranges from 0 (no correlation) to 1 (linearly dependent). In our case, MCC indicates the correlation between the matrix of NAVA AL estimates for all observers across all patients with the algorithm result. Furthermore, the Pearson concordance coefficient is used to estimate the concordance between a single observer and the algorithm [11] . The confidence limits are estimated at 95% level of significance. The MCC between NAVA AL as identified by the algorithm and as estimated by the 18 physicians is 0.54 \u00b1 0.06. The Pearson concordance coefficients between the NAVA AL as identified by each observer and the algorithm are presented in Table I . In the last row, the concordance between median NAVA AL for all observers and the algorithm is computed. It can be seen that the concordance of the NAVA AL between each observer and the algorithm is always positive. The lower limit of the concordance coefficient is slightly negative, with a median value of \u22120.13. The upper confidence limit median is 0.69.

However, determining an assist level that adequately meets the patient's needs is not straightforward. Both too high and too low assist may cause harm. While respiratory muscle fatigue may result from insufficiently unloading the patient from his work of breathing [17] , disuse atrophy may follow prolonged delivery of assist in excess of the patient's needs [18] - [20] . Thus, defining an adequate level of respiratory muscle unloading based on the patient's individual response to changes in the assist level is of clinical relevance but requires reliable measurement of the respiratory drive. The recent introduction of a technology to monitor EAdi, a validated measure of respiratory drive [2] - [5] , provides the opportunity to integrate the patient's response in the process of identifying an adequate level of assist. NAVA is unique in that it directly translates changes in the respiratory drive into changes of the ventilatory pattern. Since with NAVA the ventilator receives the same control signal as the diaphragm, it conceptually acts as an additional external respiratory muscle pump that is directly controlled by the patient's respiratory drive. Thus, NAVA provides the patient with farreaching control over the ventilatory pattern and with the ability to limit the assist once the inspiratory efforts occur at a level that corresponds to nonloaded conditions, i.e., at a satisfactory, and hence adequate, assist level with NAVA (NAVA AL ) [6] , [7] , [9] - [11] . In this patient the algorithm identified the transition from a steep increase in peak airway pressure (P aw ) to a less steep increase or plateau in P aw (i.e., the adequate NAVA level, NAVA A L ) clearly below the range of NAVA A L as visually estimated by the clinicians. The discrepancy is most likely due to a short, transitory interruption of the P aw increase during the initial steep increase, i.e., during the 1st response phase (asterisk). We assume that the physicians outperformed the current version of the algorithm in recognizing pattern irregularities.",

Therefore the graphs may be difficult to read for users non-experienced with the NAVA level titration procedure.

Since there is no minimal threshold for Vt, the ventilator displays whatever Vt(n) is delivered in the graph.
