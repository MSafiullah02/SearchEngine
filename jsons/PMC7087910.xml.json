Hendra virus, first described in Australia in 1994, causes highly lethal infection in horses and close-contact humans (Murray et al. 1995). Of the four Pteropus species endemic to mainland Australia, there is accumulating evidence that Black (P. alecto) and Spectacled (P. conspicillatus) flying-foxes are primary reservoir hosts for Hendra virus (Smith et al. 2014; Edson et al. 2015; Goldspink et al. 2015; Field et al. 2015).",

Previous studies suggest that physiological and ecological factors, constitute risk factors for infection in flying-foxes (Field 2005; Plowright et al. 2008; Breed et al. 2011), and by extension pose an increased risk of spill-over into other species (Field et al. 2011, 2012; Plowright et al. 2015). However, it is essential to know the normal range of physiological biomarkers and their possible seasonal variability before seeking physiological associations with infection and/or disease.",

Morphometric index was calculated for each animal (forearm length (mm)/weight (g)). Pregnancy was determined by gentle trans-abdominal palpation, and lactation by expression of milk from the teats. Approximately 3 mL of blood was collected from the propatagial (cephalic) vein and dispensed into a 1.3 mL Lithium Heparin blood tube (Sarstedt 2269201), a 0.5 mL EDTA blood tube (Microtainer 5974) and a direct blood smear prepared and stained using the DiffQuik system (POCD Healthcare). Blood glucose concentration was measured at the time of bleeding using an ACCU-CHEK Performa glucometer (Roche Diagnostics GmbH). Voided urine samples were obtained by trans-abdominal palpation and gentle manual bladder expression. After anaesthesia, each bat was monitored until fully conscious and satisfactory haemostasis at the venepuncture site confirmed prior to placement into a pillowcase for a further recovery period of at least 30 min prior to release at the capture site.",

The use of morphometric index as a sole indicator of body condition has been the subject of contention (Green 2001), and thus, we additionally recorded body mass and body condition score. We found that the differing measures used to establish body condition demonstrated similar temporal trends. Fitness-maximising strategies of males and females typically differ, particularly with respect to timing of maximal reproductive effort, resulting in sex-specific seasonal cycles in body mass, body condition and fat deposition (Lindstedt and Boyce 1985; Welbergen 2011). In this study, we demonstrated that female body condition declined during the lactation period and increased as the young was weaned. This likely reflects the high metabolic load that lactation imposes on nursing dams, and is consistent with the general observation that lactation is the most energetically demanding period across all mammalian species (Millar 1977; Thometz et al. 2014). In contrast, males accumulated body reserves prior to the breeding season but subsequently lost body mass during the peak mating season (March and April), likely due to territory defence, courtship and lost foraging opportunities (Welbergen 2011). As body condition followed distinctly different seasonal patterns for each sex, food availability or environmental conditions are unlikely to be the primary driver of body condition in this species at these times.",

This is particularly evident in the decreasing triglyceride and cholesterol levels in pregnant females transitioning to lactation, followed by an increase in triglycerides around the time of weaning, consistent with findings in other domestic and wild mammal species (Srivastava and Krishna 2008; Kessler et al. 2014).

            "text": "The temporal change in female urine pH may be indicative of differing availability or preference for a high carbohydrate fruit diet during the summer months while lactating. A more acidic urinary pH is usually indicative of a higher dietary acid load (typically higher protein content), while more alkaline pH is indicative of a higher carbohydrate diet (MacIntosh et al. 2012). However, the differing urine pH profiles between males and females is most plausibly due to the differing physiological status between the sexes, in particular lactation in females, rather than differing diets, as there is no evidence supporting differing foraging behaviours between the sexes of P. alecto (Palmer and Woinarski 1999; Markus and Hall 2004).",

Two percent of values were found to be equal to or above 1.040, suggesting that a small minority of animals returning from nightly foraging may be under-hydrated. Studier and Wilson (1983) found that the urine concentrating ability of nectarivorous and frugivorous bats fell below that of insectivorous bats, suggesting that frugivorous bats are poorly adapted to produce concentrated urine, while Bakken et al. (2008), in studies of a nectarivorous bat, suggest that water and electrolyte balance are maintained by eliminating excess ingested water by reducing renal water reabsorption, and limitation of urinary water loss during fasting by reducing glomerular filtration rate.",

In females, USG was uniformly low during lactation but high during pregnancy, when it is accepted that blood volumes in mammals commonly increase and conservation of fluids occur. The low USG values during lactation may alternatively reflect a high intake of fluid to support the physiologically demanding life-cycle event of lactation. The significant temporal differences between USG in males and females suggest that hydration status was more reflective of physiological and behavioural factors rather than environmental availability of water, and does not suggest any renal pathology.",

We found no evident effect of remarkable physiological or nutritional stress, and no indication of clinical disease driving any parameter values outside the normal species reference ranges. As both ecological processes and physiological status can influence patterns of infection and/or disease risk, our findings identify underlying temporal physiological variation at the population level that usefully informs epidemiological studies. In the Australian context, the findings will be valuable in assessing putative physiological risk factors driving Hendra virus infection in P. alecto. More broadly, this study adds to the knowledge of Pteropus populations in terms of their relative resistance and resilience to emerging infectious disease.",
