An important trigger of these exacerbations is viral upper respiratory tract infections (especially rhinovirus), which cause airway inflammation and oxidative stress (Box 15\u20101\n). Although bacteria are often cultured from patients with an acute COPD exacerbation, it is unclear whether these organisms are pathogens or colonizers, because bacteria can also be cultured from many patients with stable COPD. The most common pathogenic bacteria are Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae, and Moraxella catarrhalis. COPD exacerbations are more common in the winter (upper respiratory tract infections are more common during these months, and cold temperatures to cause a small reduction in lung function). Exacerbations have also been linked to increasing environmental pollution, which is thought to increase susceptibility to viral respiratory infections.Box 15\u20101Causes of Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease ExacerbationsInfection\nVirusesRhinovirus (common cold)InfluenzaParainfluenzaCoronavirusAdenovirusRespiratory syncytial virus\nChlamydia pneumoniae\n\nBacteria\nHaemophilus influenza\n\nStreptococcus pneumoniae\n\nMoraxella catarrhalis\n\nStaphylococcus aureus\n\nPseudomonas aeruginosa\n\nCommon PollutantsNitrogen dioxideParticulatesSulfur dioxideOzone\nMedicationsSedatives and narcotics\u2014reduce respiratory driveBeta\u2010blockers\nOtherCongestive heart failurePulmonary embolismCold temperature\u2014causes a small but significant reduction in lung functionPneumothoraxNo precipitant identified\nAdapted with permission from Wedzicha JA.

A chest x\u2010ray should be obtained in all patients presenting with a COPD exacerbation because findings on radiography have been shown to change short\u2010term management in as many as 20% of these patients, most of whom have new pulmonary infiltrates or evidence of heart failure.3\nArterial blood gas (ABG)\nMost COPD exacerbations do not require ABG measurements. An ABG analysis is appropriate if the patient's distress or somnolence raises concern for acute respiratory acidosis, but the ABG should never delay intubation.Patients with stable COPD may have a chronic respiratory acidosis from long\u2010standing carbon dioxide retention as a result of airway obstruction. ABG analysis in these patients shows an increased partial pressure of arterial carbon dioxide (PaCO2) but normal arterial pH, because the kidneys buffer the acid by retaining bicarbonate. Patients with a superimposed acute respiratory acidosis will have a reduced arterial pH and higher PaCO2 compared to their baseline measurements, because the kidneys are unable to buffer the acid resulting from acute carbon dioxide retention.4\nElectrocardiogram (ECG)\n\nAn admission ECG is recommended to rule out cardiac conditions, such as ischemia or acute myocardial infarction that may be contributing to the COPD exacerbation. Continuous cardiac monitoring is appropriate in patients with a moderate or severe COPD exacerbation, patients with a significant history of coronary artery disease, or patients with known cardiac arrhythmias, such as multifocal atrial tachycardia or atrial fibrillation.5\nSputum gram stain and culture\nWhite sputum may suggest a nonbacterial cause of the COPD exacerbation whereas green sputum may suggest a bacterial infection. However, sputum samples are notoriously unreliable, because they do not distinguish infection from colonization or oropharyngeal contamination. Therefore, sputum Gram stain and culture should be reserved for patients who do not respond to empiric therapy.6\nSpirometry\nSpirometry is not recommended during a COPD exacerbation, because this technique does not provide a reliable measure of disease severity nor is it useful for guiding therapy.\n",
