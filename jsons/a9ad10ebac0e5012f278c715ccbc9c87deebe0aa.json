Recently, the world health organization (WHO) has declared that COVID-19 becomes a global pandemic [1] . Over thirty thousands of people around the world have been confirmed as COVID-19 infection, and more people are suspected. Reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) is one of the standard diagnostic methods, but it faces the inherent disadvantage of false negative positive due to many factors, e.g., quality, stability, reproducibility and possible insufficient viral material in specimens [2] . Chest computed tomography (CT) has been identified as an important complementary tool for the diagnosis of COVID-19. Comparing to RT-PCR test, chest CT is relatively easy to operate and can provide fast diagnosis; moreover, chest CT has high sensitivity for screening COVID-19 infection [3] . Therefore, chest CT has become an indispensable tool in the screening and severity assessment of COVID-19 in China. However, since the explosively increased confirmed and suspected cases of COVID-19, manually assessing the severity of COVID-19 based on chest CT images becomes a labor-intensive task, potentially leading to the delay of patient isolation and treatment.",

However, the number of patients with mild and critical types are small as compared to those with common and severe types. In order to avoid the imbalanced issue, we categorize patients into two groups: non-severe group (mild and common) and severe group (severe and critical), and then do two-type severity assessment (non-severe or severe), i.e., binary classification. It is worth noting that the binary classification is reasonable in clinical practice, as patients with non-severe and severe types are different in treatment regimen. Of these 176 patients, 121 are identified as non-severe, and 55 are identified as severe. Fig. 1 shows examples of the chest CT images from 2 non-severe patients and 2 severe patients.",

Sixty-three quantitative features, including infection volume/ratio of the whole lung as well as the volumes of ground-glass opacity (GGO) regions, were calculated from the chest CT images and used as input of the RF model. The output of the RF model is the corresponding severity (non-severe or severe). In addition, the importance of 63 quantitative features was also calculated from the RF model, and different number of quantitative features, which are of the top importance, were further selected and used to train the RF model. The RF model using 30 quantitative features achieved the best performance using the validation samples, and the evaluation results using the testing samples are promising, i.e., TPR, TNR and Accuracy are 0.933, 0.745, and 0.875, respectively, along with AUC of 0.91.",
