            "text": "The emergence of the Middle East respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus (MERS-CoV) in September 2012 had attracted international attention. The virus was initially isolated from a patient with a fatal community acquired pneumonia (CAP) in Saudi Arabia [1]. Since then, multiple hospital outbreaks occurred within [2], [3], [4], [5], [6], [7] and outside Saudi Arabia [8], [9], [10], [11]. As of May 1st, 2017, the World Health Organization reported 1952 laboratory-confirmed cases worldwide and at least 693 related deaths [12]. A wide-spectrum of MERS-CoV infection was described and ranges from mild to severe and fulminant infections leading to severe acute respiratory disease [2], [13], [14], [15]. In the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, the number of MERS-CoV cases was 1601 as of May 6th, 2017 [16]. Since most of the cases of MERS-CoV in Saudi Arabia occurred due to intra- and inter-hospital transmissions, there was an increased amplification of the transmission [2], [3], [4], [9], [10], [11], [17]. Early detection and isolation of patients with MERS-CoV infection remains an important factor for the control of MERS-CoV transmission [18], [19]. One of the goals of the surveillance of emerging respiratory viruses is the rapid and early identification and placement of control measures [20]. Following the initial description of the disease [1], the ministry of health in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia put in place a surveillance and screening program for patients admitted with respiratory illness [21]. Similarly, we adopted universal screening of admitted patients with community acquired pneumonia. Here, we report the result of the surveillance activity in a general hospital in Saudi Arabia over a four year period.",

The test amplified both the upstream E protein (upE gene) and ORF1a for MERS-CoV and if both assays were positive then the diagnosis of MERS-CoV was made, as described previously [14]. The influenza test was carried out at the Johns Hopkins Aramco Healthcare Centre, Dhahran, using the Cepheid\u00ae Xpert Flu assay multiplex real-time PCR. The tested influenza viruses were pandemic 2009 H1N1, Influenza A (other than H1N1), and Influenza B. The test was systematically carried out starting April 2015.",

MERS-CoV was only detected in 20 (0.75%) from a total of 2657 patients as detailed in previous publication [22], [24]. The earliest surveillance study from Saudi Arabia was done from 1 October 2012 to 30 September 2013 and tested a total of 5065 samples [21]. In that study, the MERS positivity rate was 2% [21]. A second surveillance of MERS-CoV in Saudi Arabia was conducted from April 1, 2015 to February 1, 2016 and included a total of 57,363 suspected MERS cases [25]. The study showed only 384 (0.7%) MERS-CoV positive cases [25]. In a study in the United States, two (0.4%) imported cases were detected among 490 patients-under investigation in 2013\u20132014 [26]. In a surveillance study of 1586 unique persons from the United Arab Emirates between January 1, 2013and April 17, 2014, 41 (3%) tested positive for MERS-CoV infection [27]. In the South Korea outbreak, 184 (1%) had MERS among 16,752 suspected cases [28]. In a small study from Saudi Arabia, MERS-CoV was not detected in 182 cases tested November 2013 and January 2014 (winter time) [29]. Thus, the overall positivity of MERS-CoV among a large cohort remains low. There is a need for a better tool to identify patients with high probability of MERS-CoV. However, a case control study and a large cohort study did not reveal significant predictor of MERS-CoV infection [22], [30].",

            "text": "The monthly frequency of suspected MERS cases that were tested showed variation with an apparent increase in the tested number during November 2015\u2013March 2016. This apparent increase likely represented an increased activity of influenza during that time. There was no relation to the Hajj season as it occurred during September 21\u201326, 2015 (Fig. 1). In addition at that time, there were no known outbreaks in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia to account for such an increase in the testing. The 2015 outbreaks occurred in Al-Hasa in May 2015 [31] and in Riyadh in August 2015 [7], [32], [33]. Previous studies had shown increased testing of patients for MERS-CoV during outbreaks [4]. In the current study, the 2015 season was predominated by 2009 pandemic H1N1 whereas influenza A was more common during 2016. Similarly, in the United States the 2014\u20132015 season was predominated by pandemic H1N1 and H3N2 was more common during the 2016\u20132017 season [34], [35].We found that influenza rather than MERS-CoV was more common among the tested patients. The findings are also consistent with other studies among travelers and pilgrims where influenza far exceeded MERS [36], [37], [38], [39], [40]. Similarly, in a small study in Saudi Arabia, influenza viruses were detected in 16% of 182 patients [29]. Similarly, among a small study of 52 suspected MERS cases in the United States of America, Influenza was the most commonly (35%) identified respiratory agent [41] and another study found influenza A and B in 11% of 296 investigated patients [26]. Thus, it is important to test for common respiratory pathogens such as influenza viruses and it should be noted that identification of a respiratory pathogen should not exclude MERS-CoV testing [42]. One report indicated co-infection with influenza and MERS in four patients [43]. However, epidemiologic differences between different countries should remain as an important predictor of the existence of MERS-CoV infection.",

The epidemiology of influenza mirrored the epidemiology of influenza worldwide. The study highlights the importance of the surveillance system to elucidate the epidemiology of respiratory infections in order to formulate appropriate control measures. Inter-hospital and intra-hospital transmission of MERS-CoV infection is an important element of the transmission of this virus and it is imperative to continue to have early recognition of cases and constant application of infection control measures to abort the hospital transmissions of the virus [18], [19].",
