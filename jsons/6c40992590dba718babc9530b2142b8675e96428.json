Numerous nucleic acid amplification tests, including real-time, reverse transcription PCR (rRT-PCR) and isothermal amplification methods, have been developed to detect SARS-CoV-2 RNA, including many that have received emergency use authorization (EUA). There is a need to assess their test performance relative to one another. Objectives. The aim of this study was to compare the test performance of a high complexity laboratory-developed rRT-PCR EUA from Stanford Health Care (SHC) targeting the SARS-CoV-2 envelope (E) gene with other tests: the Atila isothermal amplification assay targeting the nucleocapsid (N) gene and open reading frame 1ab (ORF1ab), the Altona E and spike (S) multiplex, real-time RT-PCR, and the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) N1 and N2 rRT-PCRs. Results. Positive percent agreement with the SHC EUA reference assay was 82.8% (95% confidence interval (CI) 65.0 to 92.9) for Atila, 86.7% (95% CI 69.7 to 95.3) for the Altona E J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f",

[1] [2] [3] [4] There are, however, a limited number of isothermal amplification methods that have been developed for the detection of SARS-CoV-2 RNA. One such isothermal assay is the Atila iAMP COVID-19 detection kit, which targets the open reading frame 1ab (ORF1ab) region and nucleocapsid (N) gene in a single channel and utilizes the detection RNase P in a separate channel as the internal control. To evaluate this isothermal method, as well as two additional rRT-PCR assays, the N1 and N2 components of the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) assay and a commercial multiplex assay targeting the envelope (E) and spike (S) genes (Altona Diagnostics), we tested nasopharyngeal samples from individuals under J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f investigation for COVID-19 using the Stanford Health Care (SHC) Clinical Virology Laboratory EUA assay as reference. Given the need to rapidly deploy SARS-CoV-2 diagnostic tests in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, these data are important to inform laboratory decisionmaking and to guide clinical management.",

Slightly reduced sensitivity was observed in the Atila iAMP assay; five reference positive samples were not detected in the initial experiments and three were still not detected after re-extraction. Isothermal reverse transcription amplification methods are typically at least as analytically sensitive as rRT-PCR, so the explanation for this difference is not readily apparent.",

The decision to choose one assay over another in this setting should assess the balance between advantages in turnaround time and instrument or reagent availability, and the drawbacks of potentially reduced sensitivity.

The SHC test was performed as described in the EUA documentation.4,5 Briefly, Total nucleic acids were extracted from 500 \u00b5L VTM on the QIAsymphony SP using the QIAsymphony DSP Virus/Pathogen Midi Kit (both from Qiagen, Germantown, MD) according to the manufacturer's recommendations, and eluted in 60 \u00b5L buffer AVE. SARS-CoV-2 RNA was detected using previously described primer and probe sequences targeting the E gene.1 These were combined in multiplex with RNase P primers and probe. Real-time RT-PCR wasJ o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f performed using the SuperScript III One-Step RT-PCR System with Platinum Taq DNA Polymerase Kit (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) on the Rotor-Gene Q instrument (Qiagen). Comparator Nucleic Acid Amplification Tests The Atila iAMP COVID-19 Detection Kit (Atila BioSystems, Mountain View, CA) is an internally-controlled, multiplex, real-time reverse transcriptase-isothermal amplification assay targeting the ORF1ab region and N gene in a single channel. Though the Atila iAMP assay received EUA, the reagents used in this study were obtained prior to authorization and were for research use only (RUO). Per the manufacturer's instructions, 18 \u00b5L eluate was mixed with 2 \u00b5L of Sample Buffer C. Then, 15 \u00b5L of this mixture was added to 10 \u00b5L of reaction master mix, containing 5 \u00b5L of Primer Mix and 5 \u00b5L of Buffer Mix, for a total reaction volume of 25 \u00b5L. Isothermal amplification was performed on the CFX96 Deep Well Real-Time PCR Detection System (Bio-Rad Laboratories). The reaction was carried out for 30 seconds at 61\u00b0C, and then fifty 1 min intervals at 61\u00b0C with signal capture. Thresholds were set at 1000 for FAM (ORF1ab and/or N) and 200 for HEX (Internal Control, RNase P). Sample was considered positive if the FAM cycle threshold (Ct) was <45. SARS-CoV-2 negative samples with no Ct in the HEX channel were considered invalid. The RealStar SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR Kit 1.0 (Altona Diagnostics, Hamburg, Germany) is an internally-controlled multiplex, rRT-PCR that targets the lineage B betacoronavirus E gene, as well as the SARS-CoV-2-specific S gene. The Altona assay has also received EUA, though the reagents used here were obtained prior to authorization and were RUO. Per the manufacturer's instructions, the RT-PCR master mix was composed of 5 \u00b5L of Master A, 15 \u00b5L of Master B and J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f 1 \u00b5L of internal control, per reaction. Ten \u00b5L of eluate was added to 20 \u00b5L of master mix for a final volume of 30 \u00b5L. RT-PCR was performed on the CFX96 Deep Well Real-Time PCR Detection System (Bio-Rad Laboratories, Hercules, CA). Cycling conditions were as follows: hold for 20 mins at 55\u00b0C, hold for 2 mins at 95\u00b0C, then 45 cycles of 95\u00b0C for 15 seconds, 55\u00b0C for 45 seconds, and 72\u00b0C for 15 seconds. Baseline setting was set to \"Baseline Subtracted Curve Fit\" and thresholds were set at 1000 for FAM (E), 1000 for Cy5 (S), and 200 for JOE (IC). SARS-CoV-2 E and S negative samples with no Ct in the JOE channel were considered invalid. The CDC 2019-Novel Coronavirus (2019-nCoV) Real-Time RT-PCR Diagnostic Panel is composed of single-target, real-time RT-PCR assays targeting two regions of the N gene (N1 and N2) 6 . Primers were purchased from Integrated DNA Technologies (San Diego, CA) and hydrolysis probes were purchased from Biosearch Technologies (Petaluma, CA). Real-time RT-PCR was performed using the SuperScript III One-Step RT-PCR System with Platinum Taq DNA Polymerase Kit (Invitrogen) on the Rotor-Gene Q instrument (Qiagen). Each 26 \u00b5L reaction contained 10 \u00b5L of eluate, 12.5 \u00b5L of 2X Reaction Mix, 0.5 \u00b5L enzyme, 1 \u00b5L of 50 mM MgSO4, and 2 \u00b5L of primer/probe mix. Cycling conditions were as follows: 52\u00b0C for 15 mins, 94\u00b0C for 2 mins, then 45 cycles of 94\u00b0C for 15 seconds, 55\u00b0C for 45 seconds, and 68\u00b0C for 20 seconds. Detection was in the green channel (for both N1 and N2) with the threshold set at 0.05. Any sample with Ct<45 was considered positive.",

The reference assay positives included samples with virus loads that spanned clinically observed cycle threshold (Ct) values (median: 26.8 cycles, range: 17.7 -38.7, interquartile range: 7.8.)The positive percent agreement of Atila with the reference assay was 82.8% (95% confidence interval (CI) 65.0 to 92.9) (Table 2). The kappa coefficient was 0.86 (95% CI 0.74 to 0.98), indicating excellent agreement. Five reference positive samples [36.8 (01), 38.1 (02), 36.3 (06), (sample number)] were not detected by Atila. When the original samples were re-extracted and retested, two were detected [38.1 (02) and 36.3 (06)], while the three other samples remained negative. One sample was excluded from the analysis; the Atila internal control failed on both the original and re-extracted nucleic acids. The positive percent agreements of the Altona E and S targets with the reference assay were both 86.7% (95% CI 69.7 to 95.3) (Table 2). The kappa coefficient was 0.89 (95% CI 0.79 to 0.99), indicating excellent agreement. Four reference positive samples [36.8 (01), 38.1 (02), 36.3 (06), 38.7 (12)], overlapping those not detected by Atila, were also not detected by the Altona assay. Upon re-extraction and re-testing, two of these samples were detected by E and S [38.1 (02) and 38.7 (12)], one was detected by E only [36.8 (01)] and one was not detected by either [36.3 (06)].Finally, the positive percent agreements of the CDC N1 and N2 targets with the reference assay were 86.7% (95% CI 69.7 to 95.3) and 90.0% (95% CI 73.6 to 97.3), respectively (Table 2). The kappa coefficients were 0.89 (95% CI 0.79 to 0.99) and 0.92 (95% CI 0.83 to 1.0) indicating excellent agreement. Two reference positive samples [36.8 (01) and 38.7 (12)] were not detected by either N1 or N2, whereas two reference positive samples were detected only by N2 [36.3 (06), 37.2 (10)], and one reference positive sample was detected only by N1 [38.1 (02)]. After reextraction and re-testing, all three N2 and three of four N1 discrepant samples were detected.Only one sample [38.7 (12)] was detected by N2 but not N1.Negative percent agreement was 100% (95% CI 91.5 to 100.0) for all comparisons.DISCUSSIONJ o u r n a l P r e -p r o o fThe SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid amplification assays included in this analysis demonstrated similar performance when used to test nasopharyngeal swab specimens collected from persons under investigation for COVID-19 in Northern California. Discrepant results occurred exclusively in samples with low viral loads (Ct >35). Re-extraction from the original sample and re-testing of an eluate that had not undergone a freeze-thaw cycle resulted in improved SARS-CoV-2 detection, though a number of samples remained undetectable with these assays, even after re-extraction.",
