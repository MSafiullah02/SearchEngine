For example, a single amino acid change in the S, or \u201cspike,\u201d protein changes transmissible gastroenteritis virus from a predominantly respiratory pathogen into an intestinal pathogen [12]. For this reason, evaluation of viral quasi species obtained from different tissues, obtained from patients with different clinical manifestations of SARS, and obtained over time from single patients could be very rewarding. Error rates during transcription by coronavirus RNA-dependent RNA polymerases are typically on the order of 1 in 104, which are similar to rates for HIV-1 reverse transcriptase. Such high rates will likely cause substantial variation in the viral genome to occur over time, which could permit drug-resistant isolates to emerge. Careful surveillance for the development of drug-resistant SARS strains should, therefore, be part of any antiviral research protocol.",

Moreover, some workers in live-animal markets in Shenzhen, China, showed serologic evidence of SARS CoV infection without a history of a SARS-like illness. Virologic surveillance in live-animal markets led to the isolation of coronaviruses closely related to SARS CoV.

Ro may change seasonally, and a relatively small change may determine whether the virus becomes established in the human population. Moreover, the effect of host factors, especially age, on viral transmission remains to be clarified. Children infected with SARS CoV experience much less severe illness, whereas people >60 years of age suffer severe disease and high mortality; however, it is not yet clear how the probability of viral transmission varies among age groups. Similarly, the prevalence of asymptomatic infection, the possibility of transmission through an oral-fecal route or through blood transfusion, and the presence of host genetic factors that affect susceptibility have yet to be determined.

In addition, many SARS vaccine candidates are in development around the world, and preliminary results from tests in mice and nonhuman primates indicate that neutralizing antibodies are protective; some vaccine candidates that elicit neutralizing antibodies may shortly enter human trials [15].",

Existing diagnostic tests, however, are not able to detect SARS CoV with high specificity early in the course of infection in clinical specimens that are relatively easily obtained. Poon et al. [17] reported that real-time PCR, coupled with an improved RNA extraction method, allows detection of viral RNA in nasopharyngeal aspirates with 80% specificity, a considerable improvement over first-generation procedures. This research was made possible by the availability of a set of well-characterized clinical samples from individuals with confirmed SARS, coupled with matched controls. Rigorous testing of diagnostic procedures using standardized samples remains a challenge to the international community, however. In addition, a more complete understanding of where in the body the virus can be found at different stages of the disease might lead to new diagnostic strategies. For example, the report that SARS CoV can replicate in peripheral blood mononuclear cells in individuals with SARS shortly after the onset of symptoms indicates that blood might be an appropriate clinical specimen for diagnosis [18,19]. Availability of a highly accurate and specific diagnostic assay that could detect SARS CoV before or shortly after the onset of symptoms would be a tremendously valuable public health tool in any future SARS outbreaks [20].",

In this regard, it is particularly important to understand what role, if any, the human immune response plays in severe disease outcomes. A recent report describing changes in cytokine concentrations in 61 patients seropositive for SARS CoV in Beijing at early, peak, and recovery stages of the disease indicates that the immune system responds abnormally to the virus [21]. This is the kind of study that can provide useful insights into both pathogenic mechanisms and the effectiveness of experimental therapies. Another report indicates that angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 is a functional receptor for SARS CoV [22]. Further work to systematically unravel all aspects of how SARS CoV interacts with its human host at the molecular and physiologic levels will help ensure rapid development of therapeutic techniques, diagnostic assays, and vaccines.",

However, no animal model described to date can reliably mimic the respiratory symptoms seen in humans with SARS.

For example, no single site has had a sufficient number of \u201csuper-spreading\u201d events to provide enough data to completely explain them; however, data pooled from many sites in different countries would provide a much greater chance of explaining this important phenomenon. Similarly, data on the success or failure of the various treatment strategies already attempted should be rigorously compared and analyzed.
