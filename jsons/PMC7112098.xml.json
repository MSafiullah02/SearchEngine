            "text": "The porcine deltacoronavirus (PDCoV) belongs to the newly identified genus Deltacoronavirus within the family Coronaviridae (Woo et al., 2012) and causes diarrhea, vomiting and dehydration in nursing piglets (Ma et al., 2015; Zhang, 2016). The genome of PDCoV is approximately 25.4 kb, encoding four structural proteins, three accessory proteins and 15 mature nonstructural proteins (Fang et al., 2017; Wang et al., 2019a). PDCoV was initially identified in 2012 during molecular surveillance of coronaviruses (CoVs) in mammals and birds in Hong Kong (Woo et al., 2012). In 2014, the first outbreak of PDCoV at a pig farm was reported and the virus rapidly spread to the United States (Marthaler et al., 2014; Wang et al., 2014). Subsequently, PDCoV was identified in South Korea, Canada, Mainland China, Thailand, Lao People's Democratic Republic and Vietnam (Lee and Lee, 2014; Saeng-Chuto et al., 2017; Song et al., 2015; Dong et al., 2015). Furthermore, recent studies reported that calves and chickens are also susceptible to PDCoV (Jung et al., 2017; Liang et al., 2019), and that PDCoV possesses the potential to infect humans (Li et al., 2018), highlighting a possible cross-species transmission related to this emerging virus.",

            "text": "Ionic calcium (Ca2+) is a versatile intracellular signaling molecule that widely modulates signal transmission in cells. Ca2+ is involved in the regulation of a variety of processes including heart contraction, fertilization, embryonic maturation, learning, memory, cell energy metabolism, proliferation and apoptosis (Berridge et al., 2003). Ca2+ is maintained in the intracellular and extracellular milieu with the existence of a concentration gradient. This concentration gradient is modulated according to the demands of cells, and is controlled on the cooperation of a series of channels, transporters and pumps (Clapham, 1995). The transmembrane calcium channels include VGCC (voltage-gated calcium channels), TRP (transient receptor potential) and the CRAC channel (Ca2+ release and activated channel) in cell membranes, the RyR (Ryanodine receptor) and IP3R (inositol-1, 4, 5-triphosphate receptor) in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), and the MUC (mitochondrial calcium uniporter) in the mitochondria (De Stefani et al., 2016; Gaspers et al., 2014; Hogan and Rao, 2015). Cell growth and proliferation are strictly controlled by Ca2+ influx with various calcium channels (Capiod, 2011). Many Ca2+ channel blockers that interfere with the influx of Ca2+ have been developed (Ehrlich et al., 1994), providing powerful tools for the study of Ca2+ in the pathology and progression of diseases. For example, the L-type Ca2+ channels, a type of VGCC, share a common pharmacological profile with high sensitivity toward three classes of Ca2+ channel blockers, phenylalkylamines, benzothiazepines and dihydropyridines. Diltiazem, the popular heart disease drug, is a prototype of benzothiazepine that exhibits modest selectivity toward L-type Ca2+ channels and is currently used in the clinic (Hockerman et al., 1997; Kraus et al., 1998).",

For example, the Dengue virus (DENV) and West Nile virus (WNV) disturb Ca2+ homeostasis to favor the viral replication cycle, and cells treated with Ca2+ chelators and channel blockers significantly suppress the production of viral yields (Dionicio et al., 2018; Scherbik and Brinton, 2010). Rotavirus (RV) infection activates the ER calcium sensor stromal interaction molecule 1 (STIM1) and store-operated calcium entry (SOCE) to promote viral replication (Hyser et al., 2013). Hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection triggers ER Ca2+ depletion and increases Ca2+ uptake by mitochondria to induce apoptosis and mitochondrial dysfunction (Benali-Furet et al., 2005; Brault et al., 2013). In addition, studies reported that Ca2+ plays an important role in pore expansion and syncytium formation following virus-mediated cell-cell fusion (Ciechonska et al., 2014).",

IPI-2I cells, the porcine ileum epithelial cells that are highly susceptible to PDCoV (Wang et al., 2019b), were preloaded with the fluo-3-pentaacetoxymethyl ester (Fluo-3AM), a regent that can freely diffuse into cells and combine with free cytosolic Ca2+ to produce fluorescence. The preloaded cells were infected with PDCoV at a multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 3 and the fluorescence was measured at 5-min intervals. As shown in Fig. 1\nA, the cytosolic Ca2+ concentration increased after 120 min (2 h) postinfection when compared with mock-infected cells. We also measured the cytosolic Ca2+ changes at 5-min intervals in LLC-PK1 cells (pig kidney cells), another cell line which is also highly susceptible to PDCoV, and found that the cytosolic Ca2+ levels significantly increased after 80 min after PDCoV infection (Fig. 1B). In order to explore intracellular Ca2+ levels during entire infection cycle of PDCoV, the fluorescence was measured from 2 h postinfection (hpi) to 12 hpi in IPI-2I cells. The results showed that cytosolic Ca2+ levels progressively increased after PDCoV infection (Fig. 1C). Furthermore, the cells infected with PDCoV in Ca2+ free medium also showed a rise in the cytosolic Ca2+ concentration, which may be due to the release of Ca2+ from the ER.",

First, the cytotoxicity of EGTA was tested by 3-(4, 5-Dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2, 5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) assay and the results showed that no obvious cytotoxicity was observed in IPI-2I cells treated with EGTA at concentrations below 2 mM (Fig. 2\nA). To evaluate whether the levels of extracellular Ca2+ concentration affect PDCoV infection, IPI-2I cells were pretreated with EGTA (0.5, 1.0, 2.0 mM) for 1 h, and then mock-infected or infected with PDCoV (MOI = 0.5). The unabsorbed viruses were removed and then cells were inoculated with medium with or without EGTA for an additional 6 h or 12 h. The cells were collected to detect the genomic mRNA of PDCoV and the expression of the viral nucleocapsid (N) protein. As shown in Fig. 2B, the amount of genomic PDCoV RNA decreased significantly in the presence of EGTA in time- and dose-dependent manners (Fig. 2B). Western blots further confirmed that treatment with EGTA downregulated the expression of the PDCoV N protein (Fig. 2B). We also determined the viral titers by the plaque assay and the results showed that EGTA treatment decreased the PDCoV yield significantly at both 6 hpi and 12 hpi (Fig. 2C). To further confirm the role of extracellular Ca2+ in viral replication, we also compared the growth curve of PDCoV in normal medium and calcium-free medium. The results showed that the virus titers of PDCoV in calcium-free medium were significantly lower than those in normal medium (Fig. 2D). Taken together, extracellular Ca2+ plays an important role in PDCoV infection.",

DTZ is well known to interact with the transmembrane segments IIIS6 and IVS6 in the L-type Ca2+ voltage-gated channel subunit alpha1 (CACNA1), which includes four splice isoforms CACNA1S, CACNA1C, CACNA1D and CACNA1F (Kraus et al., 1998). Because DTZ inhibits PDCoV infection, theoretically, the L-type Ca2+ channel should be associated with PDCoV infection. Previous studies indicated that different CACNA1 isoforms are predominant in different tissues and cell lines (Lipscombe and Andrade, 2015). We analyzed the expression abundance of different isoforms in IPI-2I cells by real-time RT-PCR and found that the mRNA expression of CACNA1S was significantly higher than others (data not shown). Thus, we further investigated whether knockdown of CACNA1S affects PDCoV infection. To this end, a recombinant lentivirus expressing CACNA1S-specific shRNA was packaged into HEK-293T cells. The knockdown efficiency of the lentivirus-based shRNA was about 50% inhibition in IPI-2I cells, as demonstrated by Western blot analysis with an antibody against CACNA1S (Fig. 7\nA). At the same time, we also measured the calcium oscillation in CANCA1S knockdown cells. Because the used recombinant lentivirus to knockdown CANCA1S expresses green fluorescent protein (GFP), which may interfere with the detection of calcium by Fluo-3AM. Thus, we chose another calcium probe Fura-2AM to perform this experiment. As shown in Fig. 7B, the calcium oscillation induced by addition of 5 mM CaCl2 was significantly lower in cells transduced with shCACNA1S compared to cells transduced shCtrl. These results indicated that knockdown of CACNA1S affects calcium oscillation. Then, IPI-2I cells were transduced with recombinant lentivirus shCACNA1S for 72 h and infected with PDCoV (MOI = 0.5) for 12 h. As expected, knockdown of CACNA1S inhibited the expression of viral mRNA and the N protein and a reduction in viral titers was observed (Fig. 7C) when compared with that of cells transduced with the control shRNA (shCtrl). Similar results could also be observed in LLC-PK1 cells (Fig. 7D).",

            "text": "Ca2+ homeostasis is modulated by various Ca2+ permeable ion channels (Berridge et al., 2003). Thus, these channels are the potential targets for viruses to regulate Ca2+ oscillation. Influenza A virus (IAV) uses the voltage-dependent calcium channel to assist with viral entry and infection (Fujioka et al., 2018). The structure of the human metapneumovirus (HPMV) M protein revealed the presence of a high-affinity Ca2+ binding site that promotes the stability of the protein (Leyrat et al., 2014). IAV from Aves might exist in a mineralized state with Ca2+, resulting in egg-like virus-mineral structured composites, and the mineralized virus exhibits more robust infectivity and thermostability (Zhou et al., 2017). These examples suggest that Ca2+ and the Ca2+ channels are important for virus replication and are also potential antiviral targets. We tested the roles of three kinds of Ca2+ channel blockers that targeted the L-type calcium channel (DTZ), the long-acting and non-selective calcium channel (BP) and the IP3R channel (2-APB) to PDCoV infection. All three tested blockers reduced PDCoV yields significantly. Previous studies revealed that these blockers also exhibited inhibitory effects on the replication of the IAV, WNV, DENV and Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV) through different mechanisms (Dionicio et al., 2018; Fujioka et al., 2018; Scherbik and Brinton, 2010; Wang et al., 2017). The L-type calcium channel is a well-studied calcium channel and the main route for calcium entry into cells (Kabir et al., 2016; Robin and Allard, 2015). In this study, we found that the L-type calcium channel blocker, DTZ, exhibited a profound inhibitory effect on PDCoV infection, and DTZ mainly inhibited the viral replication stage. Apart from DTZ, the blockers BP and 2-APB also inhibited PDCoV infection significantly. Previous study showed that the blocker BP inhibits the entry of Ebola virus (EBOV) (Johansen et al., 2015). Whether the blockers BP and 2-APB target the entry or other steps in the life cycle of PDCoV infection require further studies. Recently Zhang et al. found that PDCoV infection upregulated the expression of cathepsin L and B in the endosome/lysosome to facilitate virus infection (Zhang et al., 2019). An increase in the intracellular Ca2+ concentration is well known to cause calpian-mediated lysosomal disruption with subsequent release of cathepsin B and L (Giorgi et al., 2008; Yamashima et al., 1998). These results are consistent with our conclusion that Ca2+ plays an important role in PDCoV infection.",

These viral proteins are termed as viroporins. Some viroporins have been identified, such as the non-structural protein 4 (NSP4) of rotavirus, the matrix protein 2 (M2) of IAV, the p7 protein of HCV, the viral protein U (Vpu) of HIV and the protein 2B (P2B) of picornavirus (Hyser et al., 2013; Ewart et al., 2002; Luik et al., 2009; Stouffer et al., 2008; Xie et al., 2011). These viroporins have been demonstrated to enhance the passage of ions and small molecules through membranes to favor viral replication (Nieva et al., 2012). As for CoVs, the small envelope (E) protein of the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) and Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) have been demonstrated to possess ion channel activity (Surya et al., 2015; Verdia-Baguena et al., 2013). In addition, some accessory proteins of CoVs, such as SARS-CoV 3a and 8a, the human coronavirus 229E (HCoV-229E) 4a protein and the porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV) ORF3, have been identified as viroporins (Castano-Rodriguez et al., 2018; Wang et al., 2012; Zhang et al., 2014). PDCoV also encodes an E protein and three accessory proteins (NS6, NS7 and NS7a) (Fang et al., 2016, 2017). Our preliminary data indicated that PDCoV NS6 interacts with STIM1 (data not shown), a protein central in the regulation of SOCE (Hogan and Rao, 2015). Interestingly, STIM1 is the ER calcium sensor (Hyser et al., 2013) and PDCoV NS6 is mainly located with both the ER and the ER-Golgi during PDCoV infection (Fang et al., 2016), which make it possible to interact with STIM1 and regulate Ca2+ homeostasis. In addition, PDCoV NS6 is an interferon antagonist (Fang et al., 2018), and a recent study reported that STIM1 regulates the type I interferon response by retaining the signaling adaptor STING (stimulator of interferon genes) at the ER (Srikanth et al., 2019). The detailed mechanism by which NS6 regulates Ca2+ homeostasis and whether the interaction between PDCoV NS6 and STIM1 is involved in modulation of antiviral response and virulence are going study.",

Previous studies suggested that PDCoV infection induces apoptosis in swine testicular and LLC-PK1 cells, possibly through the activation of the cytochrome c-mediated intrinsic mitochondrial pathway (Jung et al., 2016; Lee and Lee, 2018). A recent study also showed that PDCoV infection induces autophagosome-like vesicles associated with increased autophagic activity (Qin et al., 2019). In addition, vomiting is a common clinical symptom of PDCoV-infected piglets (Zhang, 2016). Vomiting is generally induced by serotonin through activation of the enteric nervous system and extrinsic vagal afferents to the brain, whereas the release of serotonin correlates with Ca2+ mobilization (Jung et al., 2018). These biological processes and phenomena appear to be associated with Ca2+ homeostasis, and our results showed that PDCoV infection induced a Ca2+ oscillation. Further investigation of the relationship between the PDCoV-induced Ca2+ oscillation and the above-mentioned biological processes and phenomena will lead to a better understanding of the pathogenesis of PDCoV.",
