The data modeled is the death numbers per day in China, Iran, Italy, South Korea, Spain and United States. Considering the current growth rate of the pandemic, it was possible to show that the death toll should be between 3,277-3,327 deaths in China, 2,035-2,107 in Iran, 120-134 in South Korea, 11, 793 in Italy and 6,217-7,405 in Spain. Also, with this toy model it was possible to show a clear emergence of a new outbreak within the same country (Iran, China and the United States). The growth rate of deaths found for South Korea was the lowest among the countries studied (0.14701\u00b10.00923) and for China (0.16667\u00b10.00284). Italy (0.22594\u00b10.00599) and Spain (0.31213\u00b10.02337) had the highest rates and in the second wave in Iran (0.37893\u00b10.02712).",

Also, those countries authorities ordered to their citizens, who are not in the risk groups, do not go for medical help. This leads to a large number of sub-notifications of the disease. Thus, the number of infected in each country is an unreliable data, since governments apply different methodologies in testing the disease in the population. One of the reasons why the mortality rate for COVID-19 is different around the world is precisely the under-reporting. However, when the patient dies, in most cases, health authorities perform COVID-19 tests on the deceased. These data are not only more reliable in terms of the number of deceased, but also in relation to the date of death.",

Once the epidemic starts, governments take steps to reduce the rate of infection. I conjectured in this article that the death rate is not greatly altered by government actions. Physicists, biologists and mathematicians have a long tradition of studying the behavior of population growth and their interactions [6] - [9] . The beginning of the epidemic is the most difficult phase to model, as the models generally use the consideration of a continuous population field. Furthermore, the reliability of data for small numbers does not guarantee a good agreement between data and models. Obviously, different diseases result in different outbreaks according to the health conditions of the population, type of contagion, climate and so on. Perhaps the most important factor, which is often overlooked in epidemic studies, is the topology of the population interaction network. Recent models for infections and vaccination require the actions of individuals to be considered, as well as the topology of society [10] . Clearly, no model based on stationary agents can accurately describe reality. A mix between dynamic and stationary models has shown that zero order models are a good approximation when there are already large numbers of infected (dead) people [11] - [13] .",
