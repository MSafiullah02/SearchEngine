Islands that were acquired by horizontal gene transfer (HGT) events among bacteria are designated as genomic islands (GIs) and may contribute to their adaptability. Genes encoded in GIs offer various functions, e.g., additional metabolic activities, the capability of symbiosis with other organisms, antibiotic resistance and secretion, etc. [1]. The group of GIs that contain a variety of virulence factors, providing for specific host recognition, penetration and colonization of the host organism, and the ability to overcome host defense systems, are known collectively as pathogenicity islands (PAIs). GIs are identified and characterized by different compositional features, such as biased G + C content, codon usage (CU), dinucleotide signature contrasts, amino acid contrasts [2], and different functional features such as the presence of virulence genes and mobility (e.g., integrases, transposases) genes, or structural features such as the presence of proximal tRNA and/or rRNA gene(s) and repeats at their boundaries, presence of insertion sequence elements, origin of plasmid replication, etc. [3], [4].",

Section 2 surveys different methods and algorithms for identification and prediction of GIs, including the n-gram technique and its applicability to characterization of different types of texts. It also outlines the authors\u2019 prior work in the field. Section 3 describes the three steps of the GI characterization procedure. We first perform n-gram statistical analysis of islands, for different n, in order to classify them according to (dis)agreement with the complete genome. Next, we apply other compositional features (G + C content, CU) to islands and calculate statistical measures\u2014recall, precision, sensitivity and specificity for the results of n-gram classification so as to examine how the n-gram feature contributes to characterizing GIs. Then we identify significantly overrepresented and underrepresented n-grams based on the maximal order Markov model, which may be used as a basis for Zipf-like analysis and for classification of islands based on such n-grams [6]. Section 4 presents computational results obtained for the E. coli EDL 933 genome. In Section 5 we offer our conclusions and outline some future plans.",

Radomski and Slonimski applied bigram analysis to a set of ribosomal protein sequences some thirty years later [18] to develop the notion of the genomic \u201cstyle\u201d of proteins, and the concept of n-grams with a spacer was used by Rosato et al.

The earliest work systematizing the use of n-gram counts for sequence comparison [34], [35], [36] used the difference between two DNA sequences by the squared Euclidean distance between their transition matrices. Statistical distribution of the number of n-gram matches between two random sequences was analyzed by Karlin [37] and Lippert et al. [38]. Three asymptotic distributions were identified including compound Poisson, normal and uniform distribution. Radomski and Slonimski [39] recently proposed a method of representing and analyzing complete genome sequences, based upon the frequencies of amino acid bigrams at distance. They also gave a thorough review of the work done on alignment-free sequence comparison.",

King and Guda [48] presented an n-gram-based Bayesian classifier that predicts the localization of a protein sequence. The classification accuracy of n-gram composition metrics was reviewed by Vinga and Almeida [8], [49], together with a new definition of distance between protein sequences. Volkovich et al. [50] applied n-grams to the classification of DNA sequences considered as text over the four-letter alphabet {A, C, G, T}. Kirzhner et al.

When comparing the 5-gram frequency distribution feature of E. coli EDL933 OIs with their G + C content and CU bias, a correlation was achieved: most OIs deviating significantly in 5-gram frequency distribution from the complete genome also deviate significantly in G + C content and CU bias (OIs #8, #28, #84, #108, #115 and #148).

The corresponding figures for all the OIs from the 5DC class are given in Fig. 1AF1 in the additional file.

Distribution of 5-gram percentages in E. coli EDL933 complete genome, the backbone sequence, OIs from the AC class (a) and OIs from the 5DC class (b). Labeled coordinate axes for the complete genome subfigure are presented only. The histogram's x-axis shows percentage intervals, y-axis shows number of different 5-grams with percent occurrence falling into specific intervals (e.g., in the complete genome there are 18 tetragrams with percentages in the interval 0.00\u20130.025%). x-Values range from 0 to the percent occurrence of the most frequent 5-gram (in the corresponding sequence, e.g., it is 0.28% for the complete E. coli EDL933 genome and corresponds to the most frequent 5-gram CCAGC). y-Values range from 0 to the number of different 5-grams with percent occurrence belonging to the modal interval (e.g., in the complete genome, there are 132 5-grams with percentages in the interval 0.08125\u20130.09375%); y-values sum up to 1024 (number of different 5-grams). Axes scales for all the subfigures are the same as the ones presented in the complete genome subfigure. Similarity in shape is noticeable among sequences from the AC class represented in (a), as well as their dissimilarity with sequences in the 5DC class represented in (b).",
