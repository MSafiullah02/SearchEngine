The frequency of respiratory infections among children is much greater than in adults.7 Although the frequency of URIs in the tropics appears to be no higher than in temperate climates, children in the tropics often suffer from chronic malnutrition. Undernourished children experience respiratory infections, coupled with bouts of diarrhea, intestinal helminth infection, epidemic measles, and more. These co-morbidities make what might be a mild respiratory illness in an otherwise healthy child significantly more serious in children living in the tropics (Table 128-2\n).8 The role of viral URIs, particularly influenza and respiratory syncytial virus, in predisposing individuals to subsequent bacterial infection, predominantly with Streptococcus pneumoniae and Hemophilus influenzae has emphasized the importance of controlling epidemic influenza in developing nations where vaccines have been historically underutilized.9\n",

These pulmonary symptoms may coincide with the fever (Katayama fever) associated with acute infection, but more commonly present a few weeks after resolution of fever and are associated with marked eosinophilia (approximately 30%\u201350%), mild to moderate leukocytosis, and liver enzyme abnormalities.31 Since schistosomes pass through the lung shortly after penetration (5\u20137 days), the pulmonary symptoms are likely an immune effect triggered in the lung while the organism has become established elsewhere in the host, similar to established intestinal helminths that may also cause pulmonary infiltrates.32 Chronic pulmonary disease is a complication of established schistosomal infections as ectopic migration of schistosome eggs occurs. This becomes more common in late disease as portal hypertension leads to portacaval shunts and deposition of eggs in the pulmonary vasculature. The granulomatous response to eggs in the pulmonary vessels leads to pulmonary hypertension and eventually cor pulmonale. Finally, some helminths (most importantly Paragonimus spp. and Echinococcus spp.) establish their adult stage in the lung and may be associated with years of waxing and waning eosinophilia30 (see Chapters 114 and 117).",

In a study of 304 men from Botswana who had been employed in South African mines for a mean of 15 years, 30% had pneumo-coniosis and 6.8% had progressive massive fibrosis, and additionally 26% had a history of, or current, tuberculosis.61\n",
