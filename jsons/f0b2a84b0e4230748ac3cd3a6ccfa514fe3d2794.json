In the pulmonary circulation, Ang I is easily activated to Ang II by angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE). In this process, ACE acts as a \"peptidyl dipeptidase\" and processes the deca-peptide Ang I to the 8-amino acid peptide Ang II. Ang II is one of the most known vasoconstrictors [10] . ACE2 is another key enzyme in RAS cascade with a 17-amino acids N-terminal signal peptide and a C-terminal membrane anchor. This type I trans-membrane protein cleaves the C-terminal amino acid of angiotension I (Ang I) to the nonapeptide Ang 1-9. ACE2 also directly converts Ang II to Ang 1-7, which activates G protein-coupled MAS receptor. ACE2/ Ang 1-7/Mas axis is a vasodilator with antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties. The catalytic domain of ACE2 is located at the extracellular side of the cell. This domain can be cleaved and released into blood by a disintegrin and metallopeptidase domain 17 (ADAM17) [11, 12] . ACE2 as a key counterregulatory enzyme can attenuate vasoconstriction, sodium retention, pro-inflammatory effects and pro-fibrotic effects of Ang II by its degradation to Ang 1-7, thereby attenuating its effects [13] .",

Recent investigations reported the increased level of IL-6 in patients with confirmed COVID-19 pneumonia and it has been shown that the level of IL-6 has a positive correlation with the severity of the disease [25, 26] .

Some compounds which directly bind to ACE2 receptor with high affinity can be suggested for competition with virus including morphine and codeine [27] . Morphine has been traditionally used for severe pain control and in anesthesia. Morphine as an analgesic drug and a natural opioid mediate their effects via three receptors termed \u03bc, \u03b4, and \u03ba opioid receptors [28, 29] . This opiate alkaloid (C 17 H 19 NO 3 ) isolated firstly from the plant papaver somniferum (the opium poppy) and can produce synthetically nowadays. Based on AutoDock Vina data (molecular screening modeling for protein-ligand docking), it was assumed that morphine (-6.6 kcal/mol) and especially codeine or methylmorphine (C 18 H 21 NO 3; -7 kcal/mol) be more effective compounds with high affinity for directly binding to ACE2 receptor (docking score <-10 kcal/mol) [27] .",
