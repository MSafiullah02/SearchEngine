Others assert, on the other hand, that ancillary factors may also contribute to mental health risks. These may include the specific context with which the survivor identifies with the disaster; the emotional and physical distance an individual has from the situation; and the quality and accessibility of the support available (Ibid). Further, there are those who argue that PTSD may be overly estimated; while other, less characterised, symptoms are under-estimated (Bonanno 2010) . This dubiousness in the literature has been attributed to the difficulty encountered in assessing psychological consequences sustained in disasters, because of the chaotic nature of the event; and because of the methodological impediments to psychoanalysis (Ibid). To provide a more cohesive portrait of 'typical' mental health illnesses following a disaster, George Bonanno and colleagues (Bonanno 2010) compiled data from high quality research and summarised their findings in five categories.",

It was determined that, although consequences of trauma from disasters may range from grief and PTSD to depression and suicidal tendencies, more extreme presentations of the disease have only been observed in a small number of cases. In adults, this accounts for only 30 % of all subjects studied. In youths, acute symptoms in the initial aftermath tend to be severe; however, chronic symptoms tend to be more similar in the adults, not exceeding 30 %. The second category pertains to differences in psychological outcomes and resilience. It is suggested that some survivors overcome the traumas within two years post-disaster; while the more resilient only experience transient symptoms and recover fairly quickly. The Third refers to the factors relating to outcomes, already alluded to above, and theorises that there is no single predictor of outcome. This is because individuals have different risk factors for mental health illness, as well as varied mechanisms for coping with trauma. The penultimate category specifies the risk to interpersonal and community relationships. It acknowledges that, although some affiliations are made stronger by shared traumatic experiences, several indicators suggest that most relationships actually do not survive the experience. Incidentally, the status of their post-traumatic interpersonal relationships also influences their coping mechanisms. Finally, in examining the mental health effects to populations located at a distance from the disaster scene, it has been determined that transient grief may be experienced by these individuals; however, psychological disorders may only be recognisable in those with prior experience in disasters, including those who lost loved ones under similar circumstances (Bonanno 2010) .",

The survivors' utmost desire, in disasters, is to unequivocally ascertain the circumstances of their missing loved ones (Morgan 2009 ).

Recovery commences immediately after searching of the scene has been completed (Ralph 2015) . It could last for days or weeks, but may be protracted in more severe disasters (Morgan 2009 ). Its priority is the rapid location and retrieval of bodies or body parts, and the deceased's personal effects. Speed in recovery aids in identifying the dead; reducing the psychological impact on survivors; and diminishing the distress often associated with the image and odour of death (IRIN 2012; Morgan 2009). The recovery scene is often chaotic and uncoordinated because there is an abundance of groups and individuals trying to help, including locals; aid agencies; and military and civilian search and rescue operatives (Morgan 2009 ). In order that body recovery does not impede the simultaneous assistance offered to survivors, the following should be considered (Hardin 2009 (i) Use of photographic equipment and standard documentation materials such as body tags with unique references. Documenting the exact place and date of recovery would augment the identification process. (ii) Impermeable body bags are ideal for recovery, and double-bagging is preferential; however, sheets of any material may be used if nothing else is at hand. Each body part must be collected in separate bags and no attempts must be made to match them at the scene.",

Although they are not qualified grief counsellors, they are nonetheless tasked with conversing with individuals on the most discomfiting day of their lives. This therefore, also makes them the best people to facilitate the return of the dead to their bereaved relatives (Homeland 2011). Once a body has been released to the decedents, it is generally their responsibility to contact the funeral director of their choosing, for the transport of bodies to funeral homes and the subsequent burial or cremation, according to their culture or religious beliefs (Hardin 2009; Homeland 2011; IRIN 2012; Morgan 2009; SPHERE 2004) . Pandemics could result in funeral homes overseeing 6 months' worth of dead bodies within a 6-8 week period (Hardin 2009; Homeland 2011; IRIN 2012; Morgan 2009 ). Therefore, it may be prudent for individual funeral homes to plan for employing more trained personnel who can be available on short notice (Ibid).",
