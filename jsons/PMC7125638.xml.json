            "text": "Several mechanisms of diarrhea are possible in ruminant neonates. This article summarizes the various mechanisms:\u2022Malabsorption\u25cbIt is important to remember that, under physiologic conditions, more fluid is secreted into the intestinal lumen, and reabsorbed, compared with the ingested amount. Therefore, impaired reabsorption of fluids has a major impact on the fluid balance of the patient. Several diarrheal pathogens interfere with digestion and absorption by blunting intestinal villi, as observed with rotavirus and coronavirus infections.\n\u2022Osmotic\u25cbIncreased solutes within the intestinal lumen osmotically pull more water into the lumen, thereby resulting in dehydration of the patient. Osmotic particles include maldigested disaccharides, and increased d-lactate levels from bacteria fermentation of unabsorbed nutrients that enter the colon.\n\u2022Secretory\u25cbSpecific pathogens, such as enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli (ETEC), stimulate cyclic AMP, thus increasing secretion of chloride (Cl), sodium (Na), and potassium (K) into the intestinal lumen, thereby drawing water into the intestinal lumen.\u25cbIn addition, some pathogens denude the intestinal surface and cause villous blunting, resulting in maldigestion and malabsorption. This damage to the villous leads to proliferation of secretory crypt cells and increased secretory capacity of the intestinal wall.\n\u2022Abnormal intestinal motility\u25cbDecreasing intestinal transit time may lead to maldigestion and malabsorption because of inadequate time for digestion and absorption of the ingested feed material. This process further contributes to osmotic retention of fluid in the intestinal tract.\n\u2022Increased hydrostatic pressure\u25cbDisease conditions, including heart failure, renal disease, and liver disease, may result in increased hydrostatic pressure within the intestinal tract causing movement of water from extracellular tissues into the intestinal lumen, resulting in diarrhea.\n\u2022Gastrointestinal (GI) inflammation\u25cbInflammation of the GI tract or the peritoneum (peritonitis) can exacerbate all of the above mechanisms of diarrhea. Increasing intestinal permeability or increasing hydrostatic pressure within the intestinal wall can increase fluid loss into the lumen. In addition, prostaglandin production stimulates fluid secretion into the lumen. Infiltration of the intestinal wall by inflammatory cells can also disrupt intestinal motility, increase intestinal secretion, and decrease absorptive function.\n\n",

            "text": "Diarrhea often results in fluid and electrolyte losses for the patient. As long as the ruminant neonate can compensate for losses, it will remain hemodynamically stable, and continue to nurse. However, if losses exceed intake, systemic effects will be observed on clinical examination. Fluid loss from the vascular compartment leads to hypovolemia (dehydration), hypotension, and shock. Metabolic acidosis develops as a result of intestinal and fecal loss of sodium bicarbonate, increased l-lactate from hypoperfused tissues, and increased absorption of l-lactate and d-lactate produced by bacterial fermentation in the intestinal tract.1 As dehydration and acidosis worsen, clinical signs progress, leading to weakness, loss of suckle reflex, and recumbency. Vascular collapse and electrolyte imbalances can lead to heart failure, whereas death can also result from malnutrition and hypoglycemia in neonates. In addition, endotoxemia from gram-negative bacterial infection, such as Salmonella or E coli, can directly cause circulatory failure.",

            "text": "Although it is necessary to perform a complete physical examination in ruminant patients with enteritis, this article focuses on the techniques that are specific for organ examination in ruminants with enteritis. These techniques include the following:\u2022Assessment of hydration status: tacky or dry mucous membranes, decreased skin turgor, and eyeball recession (sunken eyes) indicate dehydration. Parameters for assessing dehydration in neonates are presented in Table 1\n.2 Also, a previous issue (March 2009) covers this topic as well.3\nFig. 1\nshows a calf with eyeball recession caused by dehydration.\u2022Signs of endotoxemia or septicemia: assess mucous membranes for color and capillary refill time. Assess the sclera for injected, dilated blood vessels. Septicemic calves may show evidence of hypopyon (Fig. 2\n) in the anterior chamber of the eyes, swollen joints, omphalophlebitis, or meningitis on physical examination. Evidence of sepsis negatively affects prognosis.\u2022Posture: the posture of the patient may indicate evidence of abdominal pain; for instance, abdominal distension, arching of the back (kyphosis), treading of the hind feet, and lying down with hind legs outstretched. In cases of overt abdominal pain, the possibility of surgical conditions should be investigated and ruled out. In primary cases of neonatal enteritis that do not show evidence of septicemia or endotoxemia, the attitude and posture of the animal can provide evidence of dehydration and metabolic acidosis. Recumbent animals with greater mentation deficits in general have more severe metabolic acidosis.\u2022Rectal temperature: body temperature may be either pyrexic, normal, or hypothermic in neonates with enteritis. Hypothermia generally indicates that the patient\u2019s body is decompensating. It may also be an indication of hypoglycemia. The presence of hypothermia is often a poor prognostic indicator.\u2022Body condition: poor body condition may indicate chronicity or malnutrition, which could be a compounding factor and worthy of further herd investigation with the client.\u2022Oral examination: examination for oral ulceration and hypersalivation (ptyalism) is important because some viral causes of enteritis can also cause oral lesions. The presence of a suckle reflex is important and helps to determine the most appropriate fluid therapy strategy. The presence of a suckle reflex makes oral nutritional support much easier and allows a more cost-effective treatment plan.\u2022Abdominal palpation, auscultation, percussion and succussion: abdominal palpation may help identify evidence of pain or allow palpation of abdominal viscera. Simultaneous auscultation and percussion (pinging) on the left and right abdominal walls aids in identification of viscera filled with fluid and air under pressure. Intestinal structures that may ping in a neonate include the abomasum, small intestine, and cecum. Succussion of the abdomen is used to evaluate for the presence of excessive fluid in abdominal viscera, including the abomasum, small intestine, cecum, and rumen. The presence of sloshing fluid sounds in the abdomen (succussion splash) is an indication of fluid distension of the viscera caused by decreased intestinal motility and fluid accumulation.\u2022Characteristics of the diarrhea: patients should be evaluated for color, odor and volume of feces, presence of tenesmus, blood, and mucus.\n",

Diagnosis is usually based on history, rapidly progressing clinical signs, necropsy findings, culture results, and the presence of toxins. C perfringens types A, B, C, D, and E can cause abomasitis or enteritis in young ruminants. Table 3\nlists common diseases caused by each type and the specific toxins produced. The different types produce different toxin profiles, and the actions of these various toxins largely dictate the clinical signs observed.\u2022\nC perfringens type A causes hemorrhagic abomasitis and enteritis in calves.\u2022Clinical signs include pasty feces, which may progress to hemorrhagic diarrhea, accompanied by a painful distended abomasum. Clinical signs progress quickly and calves can be found dead without previously observed clinical signs.\u2022The alpha toxin is a phospholipase that causes endothelial damage, resulting in hemorrhagic and necrotic intestinal lesions. Normal abomasal pH and GI motility reduce the likelihood of clostridial overgrowth. Bacterial proliferation and toxin production are usually associated with decreased abomasal motility and increased abomasal pH.\u2022\nC perfringens types B and C both cause severe necrotic enterocolitis and enterotoxemia in lambs, kids, calves, piglets, and foals. The disease is characterized by diarrhea that swiftly becomes hemorrhagic and contains sloughed GI mucosa. Systemic signs progress rapidly from weakness, dehydration, and depression to toxemia and death. Progression may be so swift that overt signs of diarrhea may not be observed. Types B and C produce beta toxin, which is highly pathogenic but readily inactivated by proteolytic enzymes present in the intestinal tract, such as trypsin. Neonates are predisposed because of the presence of trypsin inhibitors in colostrum. The disease is generally seen in neonatal ruminants most commonly less than 10 days of age but can occur up to 1 month of age if trypsin inhibitors are still present in the diet. Diagnosis should be suspected based on rapidity and severity of disease, necropsy findings that include severe mucosal ulceration of the small intestine and colon, and identification of the bacteria in intestinal contents. Beta toxin assays are not generally available from diagnostic laboratories in the United States.\u2022\nC perfringens type D is associated with overeating disease and is most commonly seen in fast-growing lambs and kids. Bottle-raised animals and animals consuming large amounts of readily fermentable carbohydrates are most susceptible.

This infection causes intestinal villi to become blunted as villous epithelial cells are replaced by squamous/cuboidal epithelial cells. Small intestinal villus atrophy results in maldigestion and malabsorption.\u2022Rotavirus also elaborates an enterotoxin, NSP4, which causes calcium influx into the cell resulting in a secretory component to the diarrhea.

Multiple genotypes of Cryptosporidium parvum have been identified and can cause enteritis in sheep, goats, and humans.8 Although it can infect all ages of ruminants, clinical signs are typically seen in preweaning animals. Cryptosporidium hominis infects humans, and Cryptosporidium andersoni has been found in the abomasum of cattle but its clinical significance is unknown.\u2022Infection occurs via ingestion of an encysted sporulated oocyst. The parasite invades intestinal epithelium but remains extracytoplasmic, residing in the cell membrane cleft.\u2022Epithelial destruction causes mild to moderate villous atrophy, resulting in a malabsorptive diarrhea.\u2022Small infective doses can result in prolonged infection and high parasite burdens because of the phenomenon known as autoinfection, in which the parasite replicates within the host and is directly reinfective without exiting the body.\u2022The organism is extremely hardy in the environment and is resistant to most chemical disinfectants, including bleach and alcohol. Ammonia-based or peroxide-based products are effective. Care should be taken to avoid contamination of watersheds, which can result in significant environmental and public health issues.\u2022Diagnosis is through fecal smear or sugar floatation; however, the parasite is very small and may be missed by less experienced technicians. Acid-fast staining of samples increases sensitivity. In areas where acid-fast stain may not be readily available, there is also a technique for using more typical Ziehl-Neelsen stain to identify Cryptosporidium oocysts.9\n\u2022On-farm control of cryptosporidiosis is difficult because of the extremely high levels of oocytes shed and the environmental hardiness of oocytes resulting in a high environmental burden. The infective dose is small because of the replication and autoinfection that take place within the host.\u2022Several drugs have been tested and found to have limited activity against Cryptosporidium, including paromomycin,10 decoquinate,11 and halofuginone. Of these, halofuginone is considered the most promising but is not available or labeled in all countries and has limited efficacy in cases of multipathogen diarrhea complex.12\n\n",

Administration rates greater than maintenance are often necessary to treat hypovolemic shock caused by dehydration and account for continued losses from diarrhea. The patient\u2019s STP status must also be considered. Intravenous fluids should be administered with caution in patients with albumin levels less than 2 g/dL.\u2022Initial treatment of shock with intravenous fluid replacement may be indicated in severely compromised patients. A typical shock fluid therapy plan is to provide 90 mL/kg of intravenous fluids at a maximum rate of 40 to 50 mL/kg/h.18 Slower rates should be used for small ruminants and in animals with low total protein levels. Signs of appropriate response include improved mentation and activity, decreased skin tent or eyeball recession, improved suckle response, decreased capillary refill time, and improved peripheral perfusion noted by warming of distal extremities. Signs of fluid overload include wet cough, harsh lung sounds, increased respiratory rate, and edema.\u2022General maintenance fluid rates for juvenile ruminants range from 4 to 6 mL/kg/h (100\u2013150 mL/kg/d). Additional fluid losses from diarrhea may increase fluid needs by 50% to 100%. Thus, total fluid rates in ruminants with active diarrhea are in the range of 1.5 to 2 times maintenance.

They benefit from additional intravenous dextrose supplementation. Dextrose may safely be added to intravenous fluids at a concentration of 2.5% to 5% when administered at a maintenance fluid rate.

Few clinicians dispute a link between inadequate colostrum consumption and an increased risk for diarrhea in neonates. Supplementing calves with colostrum orally past the traditional 24 hours after birth decreases diarrhea and diarrheal treatments in preweaned calves26, 27\n\u2022A minimum of 150 to 200 g of immunoglobulin G (IgG) in colostrum or a colostrum replacer should be fed to calves within the first 24 hours (Chigerwe and colleagues, 2008)28 to provide adequate transfer of passive immunity. The concentration of IgG in colostrum can be estimated before feeding calves using a hydrometer or a Brix refractometer.\u2022Evaluation of the passive transfer status of neonates provides valuable risk assessment, husbandry, and epidemiologic information in both individual cases and herd outbreaks. Passive transfer status can be assessed using STP, sodium sulfite precipitation, immunocrit test, or radial immunodiffusion.\u2022Other factors associated with an increased risk of diarrhea include hygiene of the maternity area and neonate housing, stocking density, and disinfection practices. Attention should be paid to maternal health prepartum as well.\u2022Vaccination of the dams before parturition with a K99 E coli, rotavirus, coronavirus product can reduce the diarrhea associated with that pathogen.29, 30 Vaccination for other diarrheal agents is of varying efficacy.\u2022In beef operations, a method known as the Sandhills Calving System can be used to prevent calf diarrhea in a herd or to break a herd of a recurring neonatal diarrhea problem.31 In this method, cows are continually calving on new ground, reducing contamination and reducing mixing of calves of different ages.\n",
