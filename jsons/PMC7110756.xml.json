Many countries in Southeast Asia have no published or peer reviewed studies on CAP, including Indonesia, Brunei, Myanmar, Cambodia, East Timor, Laos, Vietnam, and most published studies used limited or unstandardized microbiological methods.2, 3, 4, 5 The etiology of CAP has been reported to differ in different geography and demography settings, thus, the management should not directly be adopted from other countries. Local data should be provided using a systematic and standardized method. This study aimed to describe the current etiology of CAP using a full range of diagnostic methods. Antimicrobial susceptibility of bacterial pathogens, underlying diseases, severity and outcome of these CAP patients were analyzed.",

Our patients were relatively young, had more often cerebrovascular underlying diseases, and had often bronchopneumonia instead of lobar or alveolar pneumonia. The wide spread use of influenza vaccination in other parts of the world may help explain the differences in the incidence of influenza in CAP. Taken together, these differences imply that a guideline of CAP management construed and implemented in Europe, North America, and Australia might not be directly applicable in Indonesia.",

However, even in low risk patients, the mortality in our study was still quite high, not only compared to that in North-America and Europe, but also to other studies from Southeast Asian countries.2, 5 The high mortality observed in our study suggests problems in the patient care process, which needs further analysis. Determinants of poor outcome may at least in part, include delay in presenting to the hospital, inappropriate initial treatment, limited access to mechanical ventilators, inappropriate antibiotic therapy, underlying diseases, and the severity of the disease on admission (to be published elsewhere). Interestingly, mortality was significantly higher among patients with unknown etiology. This finding may be explained by limitations in acquiring appropriate laboratory samples due to the severity of the disease at the time the patients were admitted. This is rather unfortunate, since these patients are those who need most to be managed based on an established etiology. This finding implies the need to perform all diagnostic procedures early, without delay, especially in patients with severe disease, so that the etiology of CAP in this group is established early, at a time its management can still be optimised.",
