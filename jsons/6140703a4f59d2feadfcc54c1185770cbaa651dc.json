This pandemic has affected most of the countries in the world because the high global movement of individuals and excessive cost in interventions. Objective: Using demographic data from city of Cali, disease epidemiological information from affected countries and mathematical models, we estimated the rate of initial exponential growth of new cases and the basic reproductive rate for a potential outbreak in city of Cali in Colombia. Materials and methods: We used dynamical models with different modeling assumptions such as use of various types of interventions and/or epidemiological characteristics to compare and contrast the differences between Colombian cities and between Latin American countries. Results: Under the assumption of homogeneously mixing population and limited resources, we predicted expected number of infected, hospitalized, in Intensive Care Units (ICU) and deaths during this potential COVID-19 outbreak. Our results suggest that on a given day in Cali there may be up to around 73000 cases who might need hospitalization under no intervention. However, this number drastically reduces if we carry out only-isolation intervention (with 16 days of symptomatic infection; ~13,000 cases) versus both quarantining for 6 days and isolation within 16 days (~3500 cases). The peak in Cali will reach in 2-3 months. Conclusions. The estimates from these studies provides different scenarios of outbreaks and can help Cali to be better prepared during the ongoing COVID-19 outbreak.",

This virus belongs to the genus betacoronavirus of the subfamily coronavirus and family Coronaviridae. 2002-2004 SARS epidemic and 2012-2016 MERS epidemic were also caused by the viruses belonging to the family coronavirus, however, both showed lower transmissibility and absolute lethality [4] .",

Mathematical models have been used before to this purpose for various epidemic diseases and can be extremely helpful in disease preparedness. An important threshold quantity associated with a disease transmissibility is the basic reproduction number, denoted by ! (pronounced \"R naught\"). The epidemiological definition of ! is the average number of new cases of the disease that will be generated by one contagious person during his/her infectious period. It specifically applies to a population of people who were previously free of infection and not vaccinated. Three possibilities exist for the potential spread or decline of a disease, depending on its ! value: (i). If ! is less than 1, each existing infection causes less than 1 new infection. In this case, the disease will decline and eventually disappear. (ii). If ! equals 1, the disease will stay alive, but there won't be an epidemic. (iii). If ! is greater than 1, cases could grow exponentially and cause an epidemic or even a pandemic [5] . A preliminary ! estimate of 1.4 -2.5 was presented on Jan 23, 2020 in a WHO's statement regarding the outbreak of 2019-nCoV [1] . S. Zhao et al. [6] estimated the mean ! for 2019-nCoV in the early phase of the outbreak ranging from 3.3 to 5.5 (likely to be below 5 but above 3 with rising report rate) [6, 7] , which appeared slightly higher than those of SARS-CoV ( ! : 2 \u2212 5) [4] . J. Read et al. [44] estimated the ! for 2019-nCoV to be in the range 3.6 -4.0, indicating that 72-75% of transmissions must be prevented in order to stop the increasing trend. The explosive and dramatic behavior of the spread of this virus SARS-CoV-2 in mainland China, has forced health and administrative authorities take severe and strict control measures. Until January 31, 2020, 11950 cases had been reported and 259 deaths but the number of cases had increased to 75,184 and 2009 deaths on February 18, 2020 [8] . The pharmacological treatment with antivirals is unknown and the vaccine is in the early stages of investigation.",

Cali presents two rainy seasons during the year [10], the first one between the months March and May, and then the second one rainy period occurs between September and November when the temperatures come down. Other strains of Coronavirus are known to be significantly related to climatic conditions with colder weather more suitable for their spread. It is worth considering that the covid-19 epidemic in Mainland China began in winter, the period of year with lower temperature and that in Cali the first winter season is approaching now in April/May when the temperature drops, and the population tends to be more crowded. Cali is a touristic city and the number of passengers moved by international routes in Colombia [11] reached 11,527,416 people alone in the first half-year. The countries of origin of these flights were of North America with 3,108,146 people, Europe 4,024,519 people, South America 2,608,066 people. Between the factors [12] explain the emergence or re-emergence of infectious diseases the modern aeronautical technology allows the connection between countries in very short time and thus sick people carry infectious agents over long distances [13] .

From those hospitalized, 15% die [22] [23] [24] . Because the covid-19 is novel disease, some parameters are unknown or are known with less precision, and hence, they are estimated. Using case reports, outbreaks' studies and some based on the behavior of coronavirus in past epidemics, these parameters are estimated. Multiple research articles report incubation period estimates obtained from different methods. The most of them report incubation period mean between 5 -7 days and the range between 2 -14 days [25] [26] [27] [28] [29] [30] [31] [32] [33] [34] . We have used the incubation period to be 6.4 days based on most of the studies. Although the virus SARS-2 can be detected in nasopharyngeal swab between 2.5 days before and 18 days after starting symptoms, infectivity is considered very low after 7 days. The infectious period is assumed for this study, an average of 7.6 days based on reported 14 days quarantine period COVID-19 [35] [36] [37] [38] [39] .",

Suppose that there is only one infectious individual at time = 0 ( (0) = 1) and there are two infectious individuals at time = % ( ( % ) = 2). Substituting for (0) = 1 and ( % ) = 2 into equation (8) we obtain ln 2 = ln 1 + \u039b % which implies Since R0 can be written in the form of \u039b and the doubling time can be computed as in equation (10), we can find % in terms of ! . For example, in case of SIR model, case of SEIR model with only infectious, it can be written as ! ()' ! \" (*(, # &-)' \" /' \" , -= + \u2032 and / = * \u2032.
