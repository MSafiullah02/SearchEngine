It is necessary to identify them and consider how significant they are to the various levels or constituents, to what extent homogeneity or heterogeneity exists (eg regarding objectives, balance with other interests and broad approaches) and the capacity of other levels to accommodate the heterogeneity. In the context of public health, this normally includes considering issues such as whether there is broad consensus on acting as a welfare state or not and the balance with other societal issues where resources are insufficient, as well as opinions on related issues such as the approach to the economy and markets. Whilst each state shares values and goals of strong public health and also a resilient economy, with both closely intertwined in the long term, there is clearly no broad global consensus on the balance between values and approaches to them.",

This includes identifying where the relevant expertise and/or knowledge lie, including whether there is access to resources at a different level or not.

Where scientific or other expertise is central to decision-making, centralisation of both the research and the decisionmaking may be efficient, as lower levels may not have the necessary resources and \"gaps\" could arise. 10 However, in cases of uncertainty, the value of full centralisation may be more questionable. It also includes identifying the potential for externalities, whereby one body's decisions can impact on external bodies and vice versa, and the potential to internalise those externalities or not by centralising.

            "text": "Whilst still part of public health, COVID-19 goes beyond the norm. Firstly, COVID-19 is highly contagious and spreads swiftly and easily. 11 This is accentuated by potentially long incubation periods and the potential for an individual to be contagious even though they are asymptomatic. The virus also remains viable on surfaces such as paper and plastic for some time, facilitating the spread further. Without control measures, the spread has proven to be exponentialwith us all now becoming too familiar with steeply increasing graphs and the term \"R0\". 12 Nor is this limited to one area or country. Due to a combination of the above factors, in conjunction with the widespread travel of individuals and products, the virus has spread globally and become a pandemic. Furthermore, COVID-19 has devastating effects. We have no vaccines, no tailored effective treatments and no built-in resistance or partial immunity to COVID-19. Whilst most will be asymptomatic or have mild symptoms, it can be fatal, with the elderly, ill and those with \"underlying conditions\" 13 being particularly vulnerable, and it also can cause severe impairments in the short and long termalthough the extent of these impairments is still to be fully understood. 14 This has further knock-on effects, as some public health systems are overburdened to the point of collapseillnesses or injuries that should be manageable cannot be properly treated, appointments and treatments are postponed and discussions arise about triage for both COVID-19 and non-COVID-19 patients. 15 The combination of the highly contagious nature and severity of impacts is worrying. It also provides for clusters of cases affecting specific groups and industries, including both healthcare workers (exacerbating the public health impacts once more) and other 11 Eg RM Anderson, H Heesterbeek and D Klinkenberg, \"How Will Country-Based Mitigation Measures Influence the Course of the COVID-19 Epidemic?\" (2020) 395(10228) The Lancet 931. 12 Reproduction number: the mean number of new cases an infected person will create. 13 A vague term that presumably is meant to reassure us, as the majority who die have \"underlying conditions\", but without clarity to date as to what this involvescould this be a broken leg?and also deprecating the value of those who have died who are elderly, ill or with such conditions. 14 \"essential workers\" in global supply chains, 16 as well as the economy reflected in the IMF's report. All of these feed into each other and risk circular short-and long-term effectswhere the virus is present and elsewhere. Consequently, there is the potential for severe externalities by the virus itself if left unmanagedbut this does not mean that the governance of it would lead necessarily to externalities also. But is effective governance possible? A final major concern for the moment, which impacts upon every nation as they react to this, is the underlying uncertainties. 17 We do not understand the disease fully, gathering data and hopefully understanding as we go. That uncertainty relates to when an individual is contagious, the morbidity levels, how to test for the virus, how to test for antibodies, how long a person might be immune for and how to treat or prevent it in future. Whilst major strides are being made with each of these aspects, uncertainty still remainsin particular regarding antibodies, immunity and vaccines. Furthermore, testing (and subsequent contact tracing) for the disease is sometimes flawed and frequently limitedhampering understanding and making for patchy data to underpin decision-making. Consequently, any decision-making is based on the precautionary principle (whether express or otherwise) and it becomes more challenging to identify clear pathways to address the pandemic effectively that also minimise countervailing riskssomething that may in itself justify national rather than international approaches, even whilst benefiting from the centralisation and sharing of scientific data.",

If we change the proportion in a population who have immunity, or introduce new sick individuals who need treatment, or simply introduce new carriers to the population, each approach will be set back and have to start again. If vulnerable individuals are no longer cocooning, they risk catching the disease and being severely impacted. Consequently, one state's approach(es) will impact on others. 22 The alternative? Continued controls on entry into each nation state and restrictions on travelwith entry potentially limited in future to those who have certificates of immunity (akin to yellow fever certificates) or who are willing to be quarantined for weeks. One reason why New Zealand 23 has been able to take the eradication approach is that they started testing prior to any cases presenting symptoms and quarantined anyone entering the state. However, crucially, they are also an island distant from most other countries and entry other than by plane or ship is highly challengingand even so, a single case in the future could lead to a new outbreak before it can be controlled, and bear in mind, for instance, the potential for unreliable tests and false negatives. Contrast this with the EU's normally porous borders or the federal states within the USAentry can be limited via airports and ports, but the extent of the land borders makes absolute control infeasible. Furthermore, the photos of Romanians flying to Germany and the UK to pick fruit and vegetables in the midst of a pandemic highlight the existing supply chains' dependence on migrant workers. 24 Similarly, the importance of a supranational or global approach, or at least considerable cooperation and collaboration, is seen in the flurry of activity and competition for resources. Most nation states are under-resourced generally, but especially are not prepared for pandemics and do not have adequate resources in situ, in part due to the economic costs and the lack of need on an ordinary basis. 25 Nor are states typically self-sufficient in the production of protective, testing or treatment equipment or components, including ventilators or chemical reagentswe are dependent on both domestic and imported materials. That dependency is now coming to the fore, with shipments to one country being intercepted by other countries, bidding wars between States in the USA 26 (with President Trump refusing to intervene when asked by States) 27 and threats to block exports to other countries including Canada. 28 Yet the stories are not all negativecountries are fast-tracking the production of necessary supplies and distributing these worldwide, including as donations, whilst others are taking in patients for treatment from overburdened countries or sending their own healthcare workers to assist. 29 The pandemic merely highlights what we already know: the issue is not merely the limited resources, but also the control of the distribution of resources and access to them.",

This would include the state of progression of the disease, but also the capacity limitations of states and their population to implement policiesakin to \"common but differentiated responsibilities\", 34 but leading to more proactive support internationally. Just as we put in place systems to help citizens within individual nations, there would need to be global responsibility and packages for states that did not have the means to address it. We are seeing this to an extent with the World Bank, IMF and G20's temporary debt relief for poor countries, 35 but more would be needed if there is to be a global approachgenuine, full-blown assistance for countries. \"Public\" becomes a global public. This is going to be very challenging where, for instance, there is no capacity to store food for a few weeks or to self-isolate.",

Whilst there is the potential to improve the effectiveness of any of the three approaches through a closely implemented and enforced approach across all populations, this does not mean it will be the best onein light of public health objectives or otherwise. For instance, aiming for herd immunity without also effectively protecting the vulnerable and flattening the curve at the same time appears to be prioritising the economy above human health and a weaker precautionary approach. In contrast, if a complete lockdown were undertaken, this might have considerable negative impacts on society and economies if maintained for lengthy periods, but would initially seem to prioritise human health and reflect a strong precautionary approach. But which approach is preferable to society? What would happen if the \"wrong\" approach were taken globally, whether excessively or insufficiently precautionary?",

Each state is looking to see what others are doing and adjusting in light of not merely new scientific data and understanding, but also in light of what seems to be working or failing. 36 Furthermore, early, substantial restrictions and generally more precautionary approaches have influenced both the timing of responses and the underlying approach in some states (eg the UK switched from a laissez-faire, soft-regulation approach facilitating long-term herd immunity to one that is more restrictive and reflects approaches taken broadly across the EU). Consequently, there is \"soft centralisation\" due to comparisons facilitated by national decision-making.",

So, yes, under ideas of subsidiarity, some centralisation of decision-making, science and distribution of resources appears logical in the context of a serious pandemic. But this leaves unanswered the question of whether some centralisation and responsibility needs to be taken outside of pandemicsof whether we need to acknowledge the relative security and privilege of some and the corresponding insecurity and vulnerability of others in both our local and global societies. 36 ",
