In principle, the system consists of a translation competent cell-lysate supplemented with ER-derived membrane vesicles referred to as microsomes (5), and a synthetic protein-encoding RNA. The cell-free translation system has been found to accurately reproduce the steps involved in translation, translocation, as well as co-and posttranslational protein modifications that occur in vivo and therefore has become a standard assay system to study those processes. Because secretory as well as transmembrane proteins were found to use the same translocation machinery in the ER membrane (3,6,7), the lysate system proved suitable to study both types of proteins.",

In addition, the system is readily accessible to scientific manipulations. Other advantages of this method include speed, a relative ease to interpret results because only one or a small number of known RNA species Falk are present and will be translated, simple detection of the synthesized radiolabeled proteins on sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS)-polyacrylamide gels, no detectable endogenous protease activity, and a wide range of co-and posttranslational protein modifications, as the system is derived from eukaryotic cells. The system, however, is not suitable for the production of large quantities of protein. Yields of protein obtained with this method will be only in the picomole range. In addition, the standard cell-free translation system will not allow the study of processes occurring in intracellular compartments downstream of the ER, although a modification of the method has been described in which the microsomal vesicles are replaced by detergent-permeabilized whole cells (8) . Transport through the Golgi apparatus, as well as insertion into the plasma membrane, was observed in this modified system.",

Both extracts are depleted of endogenous RNAs and produce only minimal amounts of endogenous proteins. However, it is always advisable to run a control translation reaction without adding any synthetic RNA with each new batch of lysate. Translation in wheat germ lysates is sensitive to the concentration of potassium and magnesium ions and their concentration has to be optimized for each RNA. For most RNAs optimal potassium ion concentrations range from 120-160 mM, and optimal magnesium ion concentrations range from 1.5 to 4 mM.

Additional bands detectable on the gels represent aggregates of translation products, and translation products initiated at AUG codons located downstream from the connexin authentic initiation codons, and were generated mostly due to nonoptimized conditions. Gels were purposely overexposed to visualize these products. (Compare Fig. 5 for connexin-expression profiles obtained after optimizing translation conditions.)

Single amino acid exchanges, introduced by sitedirected mutagenesis into the first extracellular loops of 1 Cx43, 1 Cx32, as well as 2 Cx26 (Glu 57 to Ser in 1 Cx43, Leu 56 to Ser in 1 Cx32, and Leu 54 to Ser in 2 Cx26), completely inhibited the cleavage reaction, most likely because of a steric hindrance between oligosaccharyl transferase (OST), the enzyme that recognizes the core glycosylation sequence and transfers core glycosyl groups from dolichol onto asparagine (see The other method is based on increasing the hydrophobic character of the signal anchor sequence (the first transmembrane spanning domain) of connexins. Increasing the length of the hydrophobic core of the first transmembrane spanning domain in Cx32 from 18 amino acids (Val 23 to Ala 40 ) in the wild-type protein to 21 amino acids and exchanging the central Arg 32 with an uncharged amino acid (leucine) completely abolished the cleavage as well (Fig. 7 in ref. 16) .",

Furthermore, it is important to assay well-characterized transmembrane, secretory, and cytoplasmic control proteins in parallel for a valid interpretation of results (see ref. 14).

Later, functional expression and assembly of a Shaker type K + -channel (Shaker H4, an oligomeric structure consisting of four identical copies of a protein traversing the membrane bilayer six times) (32), assembly of a human HLA-DR histocompatibility molecule (an / / -heterotrimer) (33, 34) , and assembly of the asialoglycoprotein receptor (an / hetero-oligomer) (35), although probably not into a functional receptor molecule (36), were reported to occur during cell-free expression in microsomes. These observations, combined with the expression of gap junction connexons reported in Falk et al. (15) , provide compelling evidence that the assembly of functional membrane structures consisting of several subunit proteins can take place in microsomes, and that the cell-free translation system can be used to study protein oligomerization processes.",

When purchased, microsomes are relatively costly. I have prepared microsomes from fresh canine pancreas following the protocol of Walter and Blobel (21) with great success. The prepared microsomes had at least a similar translocation efficiency, and low backgrounds comparable to those of purchased microsomes, and were very efficient in connexin protein integration. Inside-out microsomes were not detected in the preparations (see Fig. 2 ). 6. Microsomes are quite stable when stored at -70\u00b0C (2-3 yr). However, they should not be thawed and refrozen more than once or twice. Therefore, when first used, aliquoting them out into smaller volumes is highly recommended. 7. To investigate if the membrane translocation of a protein is dependent on signal recognition particle (SRP) wheat germ extract has to be used as a lysate, in combination with SRP-depleted microsomes and purified SRP. SRPs present in the wheat germ lysate do not interact with mammalian microsomes. Although we have used this methodology to prove that the membrane integration of connexins into microsomes is SRP-mediated (14), details of this specific application are not described in this more general chapter. However, protocols for the high-salt extraction of microsomes and the preparation of SRP are described in several publications by Peter Walter and co-workers (University of California, San Francisco).",

Translabel (ICN) was found to produce additional bands, and therefore should be avoided for this application. 9. To avoid nonspecific aggregation of connexin polypeptides that failed to integrate into microsomes during translation and are detected as a protein band on top of the separating gel, shorter incubation times of only 30-45 min are recommended. 10. The posttranslational membrane integration of 1 Cx43 and 2 Cx26 recently reported by two laboratories (27,28) is solely based on the results obtained by pelleting microsomes through sucrose cushions, and a protease protection assay using an inadequate protease (Staphylococcus aureus V8 protease; see below). Therefore, the observation may reflect a strong adhesion of these connexin isotypes to the outer microsomal membrane surface owing to their strong overall hydrophobicity, rather than real posttranslational membrane translocation. Further experiments using adequate technology (see Subheadings 3.2.1.-3.2.3.) and control proteins are required to convincingly demonstrate a posttranslational ER membrane integration of connexin polypeptides. 11. Proteases with a very low specificity, such as proteinase K or trypsin, are recommended for this assay because exposed polypeptide domains should be degraded completely. More specific proteases, such as Staphylococcus aureus V8 protease, which cleaves only peptide bonds C-terminally at glutamic acid and with a 3000-fold lower rate at aspartic acid (44) that have been used in connexin protease protection assays previously (44) are not suitable. The large polypeptide fragments generally produced by V8 protease do not make it possible to determine if a detected polypeptide fragment was indeed protected from proteolytic degradation and located inside the microsomal vesicle, or simply did not contain a protease V8 specific cleavage site (see ref. 47 for further reading). 12. Protease activity has to be blocked completely before the microsomes are resolved in protein sample buffer; otherwise the protected polypeptide fragments will be degraded. This is especially important when the protected fragments will be characterized subsequently by immunoprecipitation. Proteinase K is extremely active, exhibiting residual activity even in protein sample buffer. A combination of either DFP or PMSF, together with SDS, and heating to at least 80\u00b0C as described above was found to efficiently block proteinase K, as well as trypsin activity. 13. The main disadvantage of protease protection assays is that sometimes the protease concentration cannot be increased high enough to obtain a complete digest of exposed polypeptide domains, before encountering leak of protease activity into the lumen of the microsomal vesicles. As a result, exposed but tightly membrane-associated domains may remain undigested. This was observed, for example, with a large portion of the C-terminal domain of the coronavirus glycoprotein E1 (13). Although potentially accessible to proteolytic degradation the intracellular loop region of connexins was found to be relatively resistant to protease digestion (48,49) , which resulted in the precipitation of connexin polypep-tide fragments that included the intracellular loop domain in such protease protection assays (see Fig. 7 in ref. 14) . This result intially misled us to believe that the transmembrane topology of connexins integrated into microsomes may be partially inverted (50). The assumption was revised (14), and the correct transmembrane topology of connexins integrated into microsomes was proven (16). 14. Previously, 3-5 mM (final conc.) oxidized gluthatione (GSSG; Sigma, St. Louis, MO) added to the translation reactions was described to promote proper folding of membrane proteins by maintaining oxidized conditions in the translation reactions (34,51) . However, addition of GSSG was not found to be necessary for connexon assembly. 15. Several researchers have used chemical crosslinking to detect connexin-connexin interactions (39, 41, 45) . However, because this technique requires a chemical alteration of the polypeptides that may produce misleading results, especially if the concentration of the connexin polypeptides is low compared to the amount of total protein present in the microsomes, this technique was not further developed for the assembly analysis of cell-free expressed connexins. Fig. 8 . Schematic representation of a connexin assembly assay. Oligomerization of connexins was analyzed by co-immunoprecipitation. Different connexin isotypes were translated simultaneously in a cell-free translation reaction in the presence of microsomes. Connexin assembly into homo-and hetero-oligomeric complexes was allowed when several connexin polypeptides inserted into the same microsomal vesicle. Microsomes were lysed in nonionic detergent that kept the oligomeric complexes intact. Co-immunoprecipitation using connexin specific antibodies indicated co-assembly of the different connexin isotypes. In control aliquots microsomes were not lysed in detergent. No immunoprecipitation occurred under theses conditions due to the relatively large size of the microsomes. Or microsomes were lysed in SDS that also disrupted the oligomeric connexin complexes. No co-immunoprecipitation occurred under these conditions. 16 . Antibodies are used in combination with Protein A-Sepharose beads (Sigma).",

To link the antibodies to the beads, 1 mL of protein G bead slurry is washed and incubated in 10 mM sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7.3, with 15 mg of monoclonal antibodies for 1 h at room temperature with continuous rocking. Antibody-bead complexes are washed twice in 0.1 M sodium borate, pH 9.0, and bound antibodies are covalently crosslinked to the Protein A with 20 mM dimethyl pimelimidate \u00b7 2HCl (DMP, Pierce, IL), in 0.1 M sodium borate, pH 9.0, for 30 min at room temperature with continuous rocking. The reaction was quenched by washing twice with 0.2 M ethanolamine, pH 8.0, for 1 h. Antibody-bead complexes were resuspended in 1\u00d7 PBS, 0.01% Thimerosal and stored at 4\u00b0C until used. 17. Cell-free expressed connexons were found to be functional by means of channel activity. Single-channel activities were characterized by electrophysiological analysis of channels obtained after fusion of microsomes containing cell-free expressed connexins with planar lipid membranes. This method requires special experimental setup and is not described in this chapter. However, the experimental conditions are described in detail in Buehler et al. ",

Schematic representation of the protein band patterns expected for different types of proteins after translating these proteins in translation competent cell lysates supplemented with microsomes, SDS-PAGE, and autoradiography. The expected translation products of a secretory protein (A), a transmembrane protein with an N-terminal cleavable signal peptide (B), a transmembrane protein without cleavable signal peptide (C), a core glycosylated membrane protein without cleavable signal peptide (D), and a cytoplasmic protein (E) are shown. For each protein type the translation products generated in the absence (-) (lanes 1) and in the presence of (+) microsomes (lanes 2) are shown on each gel. Furthermore, polypeptide domains located inside the microsomes and protected from proteolytic degradation are shown after addition of protease to the lysate when translation is completed (lanes 3), and addition of protease in combination with detergent (lanes 4). Full-length, unmodified polypeptides are generated in the absence of microsomes (lanes 1). Secretory and transmembrane proteins encoding a signal sequence can be recognized by their increased electrophoretic mobility on SDS protein gels when translated in the presence of microsomes (lanes 2, gels A and B). Proteins not encoding a cleavable signal sequence migrate unaltered (gel C). Core glycosylated proteins can be recognized by their decreased mobility (gel D). Note that in a core glycosylated protein encoding a signal peptide, increase and decrease in electrophoretic mobility will interfere. In addition, deglycosylation is necessary to correctly recognize this protein type (see Fig. 7). Membrane-translocated proteins (gels A-D) can be distinguished from non-translocated proteins (gel E) by the generation of protease-protected polypeptide portions (lanes 3, gels A-D). Protected portions are degraded when the microsomal membrane seal is resolved by the addition of detergent (lanes 4, gels A-D).",

Translation of connexins in cell-free translation systems supplemented with pancreatic microsomes results in a complete, aberrant processing by the ER resident protease signal peptidase that removes an N-terminal portion including the N-terminal domain, and the first transmembrane spanning domain of connexins (lane 2). In the absence of microsomes no cleavage occurs (lane 1). The cleaved connexins pellet (p) together with the microsomes (lane 4), while the full-length connexins stay in the soluble lysate fraction (s) (lane 3). This result indicates that all membrane-integrated connexin polypeptides are cleaved; and that the full-length connexins also synthesized in the presence of microsomes (lane 2) are synthesized on nonmembrane bound ribosomes, and have failed to insert cotranslationally into the microsomal membranes. Full-length, glycosylated, and membrane integrated connexins were synthesized when an N-glycosylation site was introduced into the first extracellular loop (L56S amino acid exchange) (lane 6). Endoglycosidase H (endoH) removes the carbohydrate sidechain. The electrophoretic mobility of the deglycosylated polypeptides corresponds to the mobility of full-length connexins (lane 7). Full-length, membrane-integrated connexins are also synthesized when the length and hydrophobicity of the first transmembrane spanning domain is increased (R32L + 3L amino acid exchange) (lane 9).",
