            "text": "The clinical presentation of the respiratory infections caused by different viral pathogens can be very similar, making etiological diagnosis difficult. Rapid virological methods should permit specific and sensitive diagnosis at an early stage of the illness not only to assist the clinician in making therapeutic decisions, but also to prevent nosocomial infections, and to alert the onset of epidemics. The use of standard diagnostic methods such as the viral isolation in cell culture or the antigen detection assays can result in long delays before final results are available. Molecular techniques have enabled major advances in the speed and sensitivity of the laboratory diagnosis of viral respiratory infections. Within this group of assays, the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) is used most commonly, although there are several other methods that must be explored in order to improve their applicability across the range of viral pathogens [Myint, 2002] . For many RNA viruses, including most of respiratory viruses, the multiplex reverse transcription (RT)-PCR assay-based diagnosis has been shown to be rapid, sensitive, and specific [Gilbert et al., 1996; Coiras et al., 2003] . Moreover, this assay allows the coamplification of more than one target RNA sequence in a small quantity of specimen, thus providing useful information about the significance of mixed infections in the prognostic and recrudescence of the respiratory disease. The multiplex RT-PCR system can be incorporated to the diagnosis routine increasing the throughput of specimens and reducing analytical costs associated with screening for multiple organisms [Gilbert et al., 1996] .",

All these viruses are of primary importance since infections produced by them range from mild respiratory illness to fatal pneumonia, and cause considerable morbidity and excess deaths in children, elderly people, and in immunocompromised individuals throughout the world [Fleming and Cross, 1993; Arola et al., 1995; Dowell et al., 1996] .

These viruses, as happens with RSV and influenza A and B viruses, cause a range of respiratory illnesses from mild upper respiratory tract symptoms to bronchiolitis, exacerbation of asthma, and primary pneumonia with associated death [McMillan et al., 1993; Nicholson et al., 1993; Apalsch et al., 1995; Arruda et al., 1997] . On the other hand, the human coronaviruses have also a worldwide distribution and infect all age groups [Gwaltney, 1980; Hruskova et al., 1990] .

In addition, it is important to define the role of enteroviruses as etiological agents in childhood obstructive bronchiolitis [Andr\u00e9oletti et al., 2000] , usually related with enteric diseases [Casas et al., 1999; Trallero et al., 2000] .",

Results showed that most of the specimens were infected with parainfluenza virus type 3 and/or any rhinovirus type, and these samples came from children under 24 months. The nucleic acids were extracted for cDNA synthesis and an independent aliquot was taken for IFA and isolation in cell cultures, which were set up in the same day. The synthesis and amplification of cDNA were performed by the multiplex assay 1 for detection of influenza A, B, and C viruses, RSV types A and B, and a generic detection of adenoviruses, and also by the multiplex assay 2 described in this work. Most of specimens (185/201) were selected because they were negative by the multiplex assay 1, and the rest (16/201) were positive for influenza B virus, RSV types A and B, and adenovirus. These last samples were used to confirm the specificity of the multiplex assay and also to detect the possibility of coinfection.",

A commercially available multiplex RT-PCR assay for detection of respiratory viruses was described by Fan et al. [1998] : prodesse hexaplex assay to detect simultaneously RSV types A and B, influenza A and B viruses, and parainfluenza viruses types 1, 2, and 3. However, it does not detect adenovirus, important respiratory tract pathogens [Kehl et al., 2001] ; rhinoviruses or coronaviruses, which constitute both the most common upper respiratory tract pathogens and could cause serious complications [Andr\u00e9oletti et al., 2000; Arbour et al., 2000] ; or parainfluenza virus type 4, apparently more frequent and virulent than had been described [Garc\u00eda Garc\u00eda et al., 2002] . Besides, while an Hexaplex assay is relatively rapid and more sensitive than currently available direct techniques, it is laborious and costly. Moreover, viruses such as enteroviruses, rhinoviruses, or coronaviruses are repeatedly found in clinical specimens from patients with respiratory infections but its role on them is not well defined, because it is difficult to detect them with current methods.",

The sensitivity of detection of parainfluenza viruses, coronaviruses, rhinoviruses, and enteroviruses with the nested primer sets used in multiplex reaction was tested. Detection levels of 1-10 molecules of cloned-DNA of parainfluenza viruses type 2 and 4A, rhinovirus serotype 14, and echovirus 30, and 10-100 molecules of cloned-DNA of parainfluenza viruses 1 and 3, and coronavirus 229E, were achieved (Fig. 1) .

[2003] (multiplex assay 1). Using both multiplex RT-nested PCR assays, it is possible to detect simultaneously and identify fourteen respiratory viruses. The test requires approximately 10 hr of processing time and is capable of screening simultaneously for a high quantity of clinical specimens instead of performing different assays to detect and type each of them separately. Therefore, it decreases costs and increases the throughput of specimens. The simultaneous use of both multiplex assays is the first step to perform epidemiological studies to determine how frequently every pathogen could cause serious complications in children under 2 years old, elderly people, and immunocompromised patients. Furthermore, its accurate diagnosis would effectively prevent unnecessary antibiotic treatment. Two hundred and one specimens from 1994 to 2003 seasons were used to validate the new multiplex assay (see Fig. 2 ). Most of them had been frozen at \u00c0708C for several years, and the majority were obtained from children under 2 years of age (see Table IV ). All the specimens were initially tested in parallel with the multiplex assay 1, IFA, and/or isolation in cell culture. Fifty-six specimens were positive with one or all these methods: sixteen (8%, 16/201) were positive with the multiplex assay 1 and IFA or isolation in cell culture; and 40 (19.9%, 40/201) specimens were positive only with IFA or isolation in cell culture because they presented some different virus from those that can be detected with multiplex assay 1. Among them, one (0.5%, 1/201) was coinfected with parainfluenza viruses and RSV. Therefore, there were 145 (72.1%, 145/201) specimens that were negative with all these methods.",

In an attempt to determine if the viral culture-and IFA-negative, multiplex assay-positive specimens for parainfluenza viruses were proper positive, the multiplex assay described by Aguilar et al. [2000] was used to confirm all positive results. In case of enteroviruses, the ''gold standard'' to detect them is viral culture followed by IFA identification to confirm the cytopatic effect obtained. However, the diagnosis of rhinoviruses respiratory tract infections is limited because the poor sensitivity of cell cultures and the necessity of confirmation using an acid sensitivity assay. Serologic diagnosis is virtually impossible as well, due to the abundance of rhinoviruses serotypes [Hyypia et al., 1998 ]. As infections caused by rhinoviruses are among the most common infectious diseases worldwide it is important to have a reliable diagnostic tool capable of detecting their presence in clinical specimens. The relevance of the molecular assays-such as the RT-PCR used to detect both rhinoviruses and enteroviruses in nasopharyngeal aspirates from infants with respiratory tract infection-has already been demonstrated [Atmar and Georghiou, 1993; Johnson et al., 1993; Halonen et al., 1995] . The present study incorporates the detection of rhinoviruses and enteroviruses in a RT-PCR assay that also allows the identification of parainfluenza viruses and coronaviruses. In fact, it was found that 28.8% of respiratory infections within the 201 specimens used to validate the multiplex assay had been caused by rhinoviruses.",

For this reason, to perform epidemiological studies it is important to distinguish between both serogroups. Therefore, primers to detect the presence of coronaviruses in respiratory specimens were also included in the mixture reaction. Nevertheless, although it is described that coronaviruses produces 10% of upper respiratory tract infections, only one specimen of 201 tested (0.5%) was infected with coronavirus 229E-like. The underdiagnosis of the respiratory infections caused by coronaviruses in this study could be due to the fact that most of the specimens analysed belonged to children under two years old with severe lower respiratory tract infectious disease.",

It is likely that dual infections play a greater role in disease than described previously [Kehl et al., 2001] . Most of the respiratory infections observed with both multiplex assays 1 and 2 were confirmed by other methods. RSV was found in one specimen with enterovirus and in three specimens with parainfluenza viruses types 3 and 4; adenoviruses were found in two specimens with parainfluenza virus type 3; and 13 coinfections of rhinoviruses with all types of parainfluenza viruses and even with other type of rhinoviruses have also been detected (see Table V ). As the clinical aspects of distinct viral respiratory infections are indistinguishable [Yun et al., 1995; Garcia Garcia et al., 2001] , a diagnostic tool able to detect dual infections in small quantities of clinical specimens is extremely useful to evaluate the clinical consequences of simultaneous presence of several pathogens in the respiratory tract. In that sense, the analysis of simulated clinical samples and original specimens reveals both multiplex RT-nested PCR assays to be clearly capable of simultaneously detecting the presence of fourteen viruses at both high and low copy numbers. Other detection methods, such as IFA or viral isolation are less adequate because although IFA can reveal the presence of influenza A and B viruses, RSV, parainfluenza viruses, and their antigens in epithelial cells from the clinical specimens, it is not widely used in the diagnosis of adenovirus, coronaviruses, enteroviruses, and rhinoviruses.",

Accordingly, detection of respiratory pathogens by molecular methods proved to be more sensitive than conventional viral culture or IFA methods, with the advantage that all viruses can be tested at the same time with a single technique. These findings are consistent with those of other studies reported previously [Tantivanich et al., 1995; Atmar et al., 1996; Gilbert et al., 1996; Freymuth et al., 1997; Liolios et al., 2001] .

Both multiplex assays constitute a more rapid, sensitive, specific, and less expensive alternative to conventional methods, avoiding the application of many different assays to analyse one specimen for fourteen different respiratory viruses. They can improve the rapid diagnosis of respiratory diseases, and accordingly reduce nosocomial transmission, limit unnecessary antibiotic use, and improve clinical assistance as a result of an appropriated therapy following accurate diagnosis of viral infections that produce similar clinical symptoms. They also could be applied for epidemiological studies and surveillance of respiratory viruses involves. Because of their ability to detect dual infections and identify the pathogens implied, the assays can be used to determine their importance to produce serious complications in some groups of patients. The results presented above also indicate that such multiplex approaches have great potential for the detection of groups of pathogens causing clusters of diseases with similar signs and symptoms.",
