Multiple respiratory viruses and bacteria can cause an infection that leads to severe pneumonia, and it is now recognized that a high proportion of community-acquired pneumonia is caused by coinfections. Pathogens including influenza viruses, parainfluenza viruses, respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), human metapneumovirus (HMPV), (pneumococcus), , and group A streptococcus (S. pyogenes, or GAS), and others, alone or in various combinations, cause millions of ambulatory care visits for pneumonia and thousands of deaths each year in the United States. The resulting economic burden is greater than 17 billion dollars (File and Marrie 2010). In addition, otitis media is the leading reason for visits to a pediatrician (2.4 million visits per year) (Centers for Disease Control Deaths and Mortality, Centers for Disease Control Estimated Burden of Acute Otits Externa)], further increasing the health care cost of these pathogens. Although otitis media has classically been considered a bacterial disease, an increasing amount of evidence suggests that viral infections are a common cause and a great deal of acute otitis media (AOM) results from coinfections with two or more pathogens (Heikkinen 2000).\n",

Although influenza is a major public health threat on its own, bacterial coinfections complicating influenza contribute greatly by exacerbating disease severity. Detailed descriptions of fatal cases date as far back as the eighteenth century (Laennec 1923) indicating that viral-bacterial coinfections have been recognized as being prevalent for hundreds of years. Since then, further study has taken place. The most infamous event was during the \u201cSpanish Flu\u201d pandemic in 1918\u20131919 where more than 95 % of the 50+ million deaths were complicated by a bacterial coinfection (Morens et al. 2008). Although significant improvements regarding health care have been made, new pathogenic strains emerge and complications from bacterial coinfections continue. Approximately 50\u201370 % of severe or fatal cases in the 1957 H2N2 and 1968 H3N2 pandemics and nearly one-third of those in the 2009 H1N1 pandemic had bacterial complications (Louria et al. 1959; Weinberger et al. 2011). Furthermore, when a bacterial coinfection was identified, mortality was high despite appropriate antibiotic use in the majority of cases (Dom\u00ednguez-Cherit 2009; Kumar 2009; Jain et al. 2009; Palacios et al. 2009). Today, it is well recognized that bacterial pneumonia complicates disease initiated by respiratory pathogens like influenza viruses.\n",

However, over the last decade, S. aureus dominated influenza-associated childhood fatalities in the US and accounted for ~75 % of deaths from bacterial coinfections. S. aureus has likely become a more common cause of fulminant coinfections due to the emergence in some countries of the methicillin-resistant clonotypes USA300 and USA400 (MRSA). It is unclear why these strains are more likely lead to secondary pneumonia with influenza than other circulating strains. There is currently no vaccine for S. aureus. Group A streptococcus only occasionally complicates viral infections (Chaussee et al. 2011) and, when present, falls behind pneumococcus and S. aureus in prevalence.",

This research has significantly improved the current state of knowledge of influenza coinfections through the use of animal models and, more recently, through the use of theoretical models.

This led to the first animal studies confirming that bacteria contribute to disease during influenza virus infections by using filtered and unfiltered human sputum (Wherry and Butterfield 1921). These experiments were followed in 1931 by Shope, who conducted controlled experiments in pigs with a swine influenza virus and\nsuis (Shope 1931), and in the 1940s by Francis and Torregrosa, who used a mouse model with the mouse-adapted influenza A/Puerto Rico/8/1934 virus together with pneumococcus, S. aureus, or H. influenzae (Francis and de Torregrosa 1945). Since then, a variety of animal models have been used to study coinfections (Fig. 1).\n",

In the initial model, sublethal doses of PR8 and of a type 2 laboratory strain of pneumococcus (D39) reproducibly caused severe secondary bacterial pneumonia when given intranasally in BALB/c mice (McCullers and Rehg 2002). The influenza virus infection had to precede the bacterial challenge to observe synergistic disease. An interval of 3\u201314 days between inoculations with the organisms resulted in the most severe disease, and peak severity occurred when pneumococcus was given 7 days postviral infection. Simultaneous administration of the two pathogens had only additive effects on morbidity, rather than the synergistic effects observed during the sequential infection. This model was later improved by engineering pneumococcal strains to express luciferase, which allows for quantitative bioluminescent imaging to track progression of the infection in live mice (McCullers and Bartmess 2003).",

For example, viruses that replicate well in mice are required to produce robust and reproducible effects, a limitation that affects the certainty with which conclusions can be extrapolated to humans. This is mitigated somewhat by using different species of mice, including the C57BL/6 strain, which behaves similarly to the BALB/c strain (Karlstrom et al. 2011), and the DBA/2 strain, which is highly permissive to a variety of human influenza strains (Alymova et al. 2011). In addition, a ferret model can be used to confirm results found using the mouse model or to answer questions about strain-related differences in pathogenesis since ferrets are susceptible to most human viruses and exhibit a disease course similar to humans (Peltola et al. 2006; McCullers et al. 2010).",

This is likely due to colonizing strains being limited by systemic immunity, such as pathogen-specific serum IgG, which prevents successful invasion of the lower airways but may tolerate carriage [reviewed in (McCullers et al. 2010)]. In the mouse model, bacteria are delivered directly to the lung, which mimics a direct-inhalation scenario. It is unclear whether this scenario is physiologically relevant in humans, or whether some period of colonization of the nasopharynx must occur prior to invasion and dissemination [reviewed in (McCullers 2014)]. The inoculum size and volume, and the length of anesthesia all influence how much bacteria reach the lower airways and thus the disease model being studied. Both the ferret and mouse AOM models, on the other hand, use colonization as a prerequisite for pneumonia or AOM, so a more natural infection for this site can be instigated.",

In mice AOM models, animals become colonized with pneumococcus within 72 h after inoculation and can experience recurrent episodes when virus infected (McCullers et al. 2007). Of those that developed AOM (~70 %), resolution occurred within 48 h but colonization persisted for nearly 30 days (McCullers et al. 2007). In the chinchilla model, animals infected with influenza virus experience negative middle ear pressure and eardrum inflammation associated with epithelial damage and cellular and mucosal debris accumulation in the Eustachian tube (Giebink et al. 1987). Similarly, both virus-mediated inflammation and hearing loss are observed in neonatal mice and ferrets (Rarey et al. 1987; Short et al. 2011). However, in contrast to the findings in chinchillas, minimal Eustachian tube damage is observed and bacterial localization specificity suggests that invasion techniques observed in other models are unlikely to be relevant to bacterial AOM (Short et al. 2011). Nevertheless, the increased pathology may support bacterial replication in the middle ear.",

PB1-F2 can act in a proapoptotic fashion due to its mitochondrial targeting sequence and ability to form pores when interacting with membrane-based proteins (Chen et al. 2001; Gibbs et al. 2003; Chanturiya et al. 2004; Zamarin et al. 2005; Danishuddin et al. 2010; McAuley et al. 2010a). This likely results in the death of epithelial cells and immune cells, which may balance the high replicative ability and support rapid spread through cell monolayers thereby contributing to virulence in vivo (Zamarin et al. 2006; McAuley et al. 2010a, b; Smith et al. 2011a; Varga et al. 2011, 2012).

The 66S polymorphism facilitates binding of PB1-F2 to the mitochondrial antiviral-signaling (MAVS) protein adaptor protein and subsequent inhibition of interferon production (Varga et al. 2011, 2012). As a result, viral virulence in primary infection and secondary bacterial infection models is severely exacerbated.",

            "text": "The most relevant PB1-F2 mechanism may be its ability to modulate the immune response during influenza infections and coinfections. The high proinflammatory activity of PB1-F2 intensifies disease in animal models, particularly with respect to induction and severity of bacterial coinfections (McAuley et al. 2007, 2010a; Alymova et al. 2011; Weeks-Gorospe et al. 2012), and is marked by a large influx of immune cells and cytokine storm (Conenello et al. 2007; McAuley et al. 2007, 2010a). Pathogenic PB1-F2s, such as that from the 1918 pandemic strain, elevate neutrophils and macrophages and contribute to the pathologic tissue destruction observed during bacterial coinfections (McAuley et al. 2007). This is likely due to regulation of the type I interferon response (le Goffic et al. 2010; Conenello et al. 2011; Varga et al. 2011, 2012) and apoptotic monocytes infected with influenza (Chen et al. 2001; Gibbs et al. 2003; Zamarin et al. 2005). Specific molecular signatures that facilitate this inflammatory environment have been identified (McAuley et al. 2007, 2010b). Amino acids 62L, 75R, 79R, and 82L in the C-terminal portion of PB1-F2 of select strains are positively associated with inflammation and hypercytokinemia in infected animals and negatively correlated with survival. The precise mechanism and contribution of these signatures singly or in combination is unclear.",

            "text": "Pathogenicity of the 1918 H1N1 pandemic strain was likely impacted by possession all four inflammatory signatures together with the 66S polymorphism. While the 1957 H2N2 and 1968 H3N2 pandemic strains also had all four amino acids, both lacked the 66S polymorphism. Subsequent circulating strains became truncated in the H1N1 lineage around 1948 (McAuley et al. 2010a) and mutations in the H3N2 lineage resulted in loss of the inflammatory signatures by the 1980s. In fact, an antibacterial phenotype emerged in the H3N2 lineage such that viruses and invading bacteria compete via PB1-F2 expression rather than synergize (Alymova et al. 2011; Weeks-Gorospe et al. 2012). The expression of these signatures and the length of PB1-F2 proteins vary widely within influenza viruses. In general, viruses with only the 66S signature or a full set of the polymorphisms strongly support bacterial pathogens, while truncation results in an intermediate phenotype (Zell et al. 2007) and a single substitution at position 82 confers anti-inflammatory properties (Weeks-Gorospe et al. 2012). The range of phenotypes highlights the intricate and complicated nature of influenza infections and coinfections and links specific molecular signatures to pathogenicity. It is important to note that each of these effects was demonstrated in animal models using specific viruses [e.g., H3N2 (Alymova et al. 2011), swine H1N1, H1N2, H3N2 (Weeks-Gorospe et al. 2012)]. The H5N1 viruses are of particular interest for further study since they have little diversity in their PB1-F2, are typically full length, and are more likely to possess the full inflammatory panel with the exception of the 66S polymorphism (Smith and McCullers 2013).\n",

            "text": "Since phagocytic cells are critical in creating a bactericidal environment, it is not surprising that these cells are impacted by viral and bacterial mechanisms when secondary infections occur. The activity of neutrophils and macrophages is dampened along with their cytokine production as natural killer (NK) cells become impaired during influenza virus infection and undergo additional suppression during coinfections as a result of heightened TNF-\u03b1 expression (Small et al. 2010). Further functional suppression of these cells occurs when type I interferons (IFN-\u03b1,\u03b2) place epithelial cells in antiviral states and alter their chemotactic functions (Joyce et al. 2009; Shahangian et al. 2009; le Goffic et al. 2010; Conenello et al. 2011; Nakamura et al. 2011; Tian et al. 2012; Li et al. 2012). For instance, neutrophil chemoattractants KC and MIP-2 (Shahangian et al. 2009) and macrophage chemoattractant CCL2 (Nakamura et al. 2011) all become downregulated, which inhibits recruitment of immune cells leading to inefficient bacterial clearance. IFN-\u03b1,\u03b2 may also decrease Th-17 cytokines IL-17, IL-22, and IL-23 during S. aureus coinfection, which increases inflammation and decreases viral and bacterial clearance (Kudva et al. 2011).",

Indeed, novel analyses of coinfection kinetics identified and detailed the dominant mechanism driving influenza-pneumococcal synergy as a direct viral-dependent reduction in bacterial phagocytosis by alveolar macrophages (Smith et al. 2013). We predicted that this phagocytosis is reduced by 85\u201390 % at day 7 of the influenza virus infection. We later confirmed that this was a major driver of influenza-pneumococcal synergy with a mouse model by labeling and tracking these cells before and during influenza infections (Ghoneim et al. 2013). Our experiments showed that the resident macrophage population declines as influenza progresses, suggesting that influenza virus directly depletes these cells rather than simply reducing their function. Furthermore, bacterial outgrowth correlated to the level of depletion, which offers new insight into why the timing of bacterial infection has a profound impact on disease outcome (Ghoneim et al. 2013).",

The degree and length of this suppression is viral strain-dependent (Ludewick et al. 2011), and occurs through diverse mechanisms. For instance, alveolar macrophages with high expression of homeostatic moieties such as CD200R, a regulatory anti-inflammatory ligand (Barclay et al. 2002; Minas and Liversidge 2006; Snelgrove et al. 2008; Jiang-Shieh et al. 2010), become desensitized when expression of CD200 on apoptotic immune cells increases and open the airways to bacterial invasion (Goulding et al. 2011). In conjunction, absence of CD200R in mice inhibits bacterial outgrowth and prevents migration of bacteria to exogenous sites, such as the blood, in influenza-infected mice (Goulding et al. 2011). Elevated glucocorticoid levels also cause sustained immunosuppression, as was demonstrated in a model of Listeria monocytogenes coinfection (Jamieson et al. 2010).",

Chinchilla studies indicate that immunosuppression, rather than inflammation, is the key mechanism contributing to enhanced pneumococcal replication since influenza viruses can inhibit neutrophils and render clearance ineffective (Abramson et al. 1981, 1982). However, it has also been hypothesized that the enhanced bacterial growth results from nutrients becoming available in areas damaged by this response (Short et al. 2013b).

The rapidity of the viral reply suggests a fast-acting mechanism, which may occur through direct interactions of the two pathogens, bacterial interference with antiviral immunity, or virulence factors synergizing (Smith et al. 2013).

Determining if bacterial gene products from various species have similar effects during infection and, if so, how they complement viral factors is an important, but largely unexplored, area. Another interesting area for investigation in animal models is the idea that the respiratory and gastrointestinal microbiome affects the development of antiviral responses to pathogens (Ichinohe et al. 2011; Licciardi et al. 2012; Abt et al. 2012; Wang et al. 2013).

Given the benefit of anti-inflammatory treatment and the importance of inflammation in viral-bacterial coinfections, better success may occur if specific inflammatory pathways or pathogenic factors are targeted [reviewed in (McCullers 2011)].",

A few models, however, take advantage of data collected in the mouse model, including pathogen and immunological measurements, to study invasive lung infections (Handel et al. 2010; Miao et al. 2010; Smith et al. 2011a). Viral load dynamics can be accurately modeled using target-cell limitation (Fig. 3), through undefined mechanisms, as the primary means of viral control while excluding specific immune responses (Baccam et al. 2006; Smith et al. 2011a). It is important to note that these models do not discount the fact that immunological factors may drive influenza virus pathogenesis, but that this information can simply not be extracted from viral loads (Smith et al. 2010; Miao et al. 2011). Quantifying the effect that host factors have on viral replication has been restricted by the limited amount of data detailing the innate immune responses [reviewed in (Smith and Perelson 2011)].

While the rapid neutrophil influx could facilitate bacterial removal, pneumococcal-induced neutrophil apoptosis hindered complete eradication. This process was also dependent on alveolar macrophages and whether they were engaged damage control rather than bacterial clearance.

Bacterial proteases or NAs may liberate virus in the same manner as viral NA. S. aureus proteases can activate influenza virus HA cleavage and enhance viral invasion into host cells (Tashiro et al. 1987). Furthermore, some commensal bacteria [e.g., S. mitis (Nonaka et al. 1983; Beighton and Whiley 1990), certain S. pneumoniae (Scanlon et al. 1989), Actinomyces naeslundii and A. viscosus (Moncla and Braham 1989), Porphyromonas gingivalis (Moncla et al. 1990), and S. oralis (Homer et al. 1996)] that secrete NAs or exogenous NA can rescue influenza virus replication if viral NA is missing or inhibited (Liu and Air 1993; Hughes et al. 2000; Nishikawa et al. 2012). Thus, it is feasible that other NA possessing bacterial species can act in the manner predicted by our model.

Viral-mediated mechanisms are also important in other invasive infections, such as otitis media. The underlying relationship between viral and bacterial density, inflammation, and the host microbiome during influenza coinfections is exceptionally complex. Even with the growing body of work detailing various aspects of viral-bacterial coinfections, determining the precise contributions of each interrelated factor is challenging. Furthermore, studying coinfections has become problematic due to the numerous site-, pathogen-, time-, and host-specific variations to consider. Thus, it is necessary to employ the next generation of analyses using a mixture of animal models and kinetic models with the goal of obtaining results translatable to infections in humans.",

Our understanding of coinfection biology should increase as new and different data emerge. With such data, treatment options suitable for clinical practice are permissive to investigation as we focus on preparation for the next influenza pandemic.",

Numerous alterations of the respiratory epithelium and host immune responses occur during influenza virus infection that predisposes a host to coinfection with bacterial pathogens. As influenza virus infects and kills host cells, epithelial surfaces become exposed and permissive to bacterial attachment. Physical barriers (e.g., mucociliary transport) are damaged, pathogen detection is decreased, anti-microbial peptides (AMPs) are downregulated, receptors are upregulated, virus production is enhanced, bacterial transepithelial migration is permitted, and repair mechanisms are lost. Several host responses are also dampened, altered, or removed. Alveolar macrophages, neutrophils, dendritic cells, and NK cells have altered cytokine profiles and become impaired and/or depleted. These changes result in a heightened inflammatory environment with decreased bacterial surveillance and eradication",

Model schematic and equations that result in the observed kinetics of influenza virus infection followed by pneumococcus given 7 days postinfluenza infection (Smith et al. 2013). During primary influenza, susceptible epithelial (target) cells (T) become infected at a rate \u03b2V per cell. Infected cells (I\n1) first undergo an eclipse phase at rate k per cell prior to entering a state (I\n2) in which virus is produced. Productively infected cells are lost, through apoptosis, viral cytopathic effects, or removal by immune cells, at a rate \u03b4 per cell. Virus (V) is produced at rate p per cell, which is significantly increased by bacterial presence (aP\nz) (boxed), and cleared at rate c. Invading pneumococci (P) proliferate at maximum rate r with a tissue capacity K\np CFU/ml. Bacteria are cleared via phagocytosis by alveolar macrophages (MA) at rate \u03b3f per cell, which is significantly reduced by virus presence \\documentclass[12pt]{minimal}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsmath}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{wasysym} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsfonts} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amssymb} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsbsy}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{mathrsfs}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{upgreek}\n\t\t\t\t\\setlength{\\oddsidemargin}{-69pt}\n\t\t\t\t\\begin{document}$$ \\left( {\\phi V/(K_{PV} + V)} \\right) $$\\end{document} (boxed).
