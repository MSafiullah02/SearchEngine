            "text": "The rapid global spread of the virus SARS-CoV-2 has provoked a spike in demand for hospital care. Hospital systems across the world have been over-extended, including in Northern Italy, Ecuador, and New York City, and many other systems face similar challenges. As a result, decisions on how to best allocate very limited medical resources have come to the forefront. Specifically, under consideration are decisions on who to test, who to admit into hospitals, who to treat in an Intensive Care Unit (ICU), and who to support with a ventilator. Given today's ability to gather, share, analyze and process data, personalized predictive models based on demographics and information regarding prior conditions can be used to (1) help decision-makers allocate limited resources, when needed, (2) advise individuals how to better protect themselves given their risk profile, (3) differentiate social distancing guidelines based on risk, and (4) prioritize vaccinations once a vaccine becomes available. Objective: To develop personalized models that predict the following events: (1) hospitalization, (2) mortality, (3) need for ICU, and (4) need for a ventilator. To predict hospitalization, it is assumed that one has access to a patient's basic preconditions, which can be easily gathered without the need to be at a hospital. For the remaining models, different versions developed include different sets of a patient's features, with some including information on how the disease is progressing (e.g., diagnosis of pneumonia). Materials and Methods: Data from a publicly available repository, updated daily, containing information from approximately 91,000 patients in Mexico were used. The data for each patient include demographics, prior medical conditions, SARS-CoV-2 test results, hospitalization, mortality and whether a patient has developed pneumonia or not. Several classification methods were applied, including robust versions of logistic regression, and support vector machines, as well as random forests and gradient boosted decision trees. Results: Interpretable methods (logistic regression and support vector machines) perform just as well as more complex models in terms of accuracy and detection rates, with the additional benefit of elucidating variables on which the predictions are based. Classification accuracies reached 61%, 76%, 83%, and 84% for predicting hospitalization, mortality, need for ICU and need for a ventilator, respectively. The analysis reveals the most important preconditions for making the predictions. For the four models derived, these are: (1) for hospitalization: age, gender, chronic renal insufficiency, diabetes, immunosuppression; (2) for mortality: age, SARS-CoV-2 test status, immunosuppression and pregnancy; (3) for ICU need: development of pneumonia (if available), cardiovascular disease, asthma, and SARS-CoV-2 test status; and (4) for ventilator need: ICU and pneumonia (if available), age, gender, cardiovascular disease, obesity, pregnancy, and SARS-CoV-2 test result.",

Equally importantly, as societies adapt to the pandemic, predictive models can (i) assess individual risk so that social distancing measures can transition from \"blanket\" to more targeted (e.g., deciding who can return to work, who is advised to stay at home, who should be tested, etc.) and (ii) direct policy decisions on who should receive priority for vaccination, which will be critical as initial vaccine production may not suffice to vaccinate everybody.",

Recent advances in the machine learning literature have suggested that sparse classifiers, those that use few variables (e.g., l1-regularized Support Vector Machines), have stronger predictive power and generalize better on out-of-sample data points than very complex classifiers [12] . Related work has shown that regularization is equivalent to robustness, that is, learning models which are robust to the presence of outliers in the training set [13] . Moreover, the benefit of using sparse predictors is the enhanced interpretability they provide for both the model and the results.",

In addition, the upper bar plot denotes the percentage of the patients in a certain age range who have been hospitalized. This information is aligned with the current knowledge on COVID-19, which indicates that older people have higher risk of being hospitalized. Also, this plot suggests that the risk of being hospitalized increases linearly from the age of thirty up to seventy-five and then plateaus. We ran an ordinary linear regression (OLS) to calculate the rate at which the percentage of hospitalization increases for every additional year of age. The result indicates that the rate is 0.014 with an R 2 equal to 0.99. This suggests that the risk of hospitalization increases by approximately 1.4% for every year of age between 30 and 75 years old.",

The general framework of this algorithm begins by building a classifier using all the features and computing an importance score for each predictor. In the case of Logistic Regression or Linear SVM, we use as important score the absolute value (or magnitude) of the linear coefficient \u03b2 i of feature i. After this step, the least important feature (the one with the smallest |\u03b2 i |) is deleted from the dataset. We repeat iteratively this process until we are left with one feature. Then, for each of these iterations we report the performance of the model and we pick the set of features that maximize this value.

            "text": "Similar to sparse SVM, logistic regression (LR) [25] is an interpretable binary linear classifier. The key idea is to model the posterior probability of the outcome y i (e.g. a patient being hospitalized) as a logistic function of a linear combination of the features x i . To that end, it uses parameters \u03b8 that weigh the input features and an offset \u03b8 0 . These parameters are selected by maximizing the log-likelihood of a function by the use of gradient-based algorithms. LR has been particularly popular in the medical literature because it predicts the probability that a sample belongs to the positive (or negative) class. In this work, we employ a sparse logistic regression. This is an l 1 -regularized logistic regression which includes in the objective function an extra term proportional to \u03b8 1 in the log likelihood sense. Same as in sparse SVM, the motivation to include this term is to render the predictor more robust [26] . Formally, the problem is defined as min \u03b8,\u03b80 n i=1 (\u2212 log p(y i |x i ; \u03b8, \u03b2 0 )) + \u03bb \u03b2 1",

Random Forest (RF) [27] are part of a bigger class of predictors called ensemble methods. The main idea of ensemble classifiers is to reduce the variance of an estimated predictor by training many noisy but approximately unbiased models and making the classification decision based on the majority of vote of these weak classifiers. In particular, RF is an ensemble of decision trees (DT) [28] . To grow each DT of the RF, the model uses data obtained through random sampling with replacement from the training set. A DT is fully grown until a minimum size (or depth) is reached. Even if the decision of an individual DT is very noisy due to the sampling process, the average of many DTs is not, as long as these trees are not highly correlated. RFs are easy and fast to implement to large data sets and do not have a high risk of overfitting. A general disadvantage of these methods is the lack of interpretability as every prediction is obtained by majority voting of many (hundreds or thousands) of DTs. weak and small DTs.",
