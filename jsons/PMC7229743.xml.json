            "text": "Science is about the reproducibility of research results and being able to replicate the work of others to validate, question, and improve on their findings to arrive at new verifiable conclusions, formulate models, test hypotheses, and establish new theories based on solid empirical validation. Much of Computer Graphics focuses on methods for creating, shaping, and bringing visual content to life. To advance the discipline, our Journal has teamed with the Graphics Replicability Stamp Initiative1\nand the Software Impacts Journal2\nto promote the dissemination and reproducibility of research findings through peer-verified results and software. Papers that have been accepted for publication in our Journal can be awarded a Replicability Badge. To this end, Authors need to provide a complete implementation of their algorithm, so that the results presented in their paper can be reproduced independently by volunteers. To this date, several papers [9], [10], [11], [12], [13], [14], [15], [16] have received the Graphics Replicability Stamp while others are in press at the time of this writing [17]. Each of these papers is recognized by having a special GRSI Badge Associated with its entry in ScienceDirect. Additionally, authors can submit their software to the Software Impacts Journal for additional dissemination and validation. To further promote the dissemination of verifiable results, I am pleased to announce that the Computers and Graphics Journal is offering an Annual Best Paper Award bestowed on a paper published on the previous year that features both the Graphics Replicability Badge and has had its code published in the Software Impacts Journal. The winning entries will be selected by the Journal Editorial Board. The Computers and Graphics Best (Replicable) Paper Award includes a monetary stipend of 1000 Eur.",

This will likely have a very significant impact on the timely dissemination of scientific results especially in Interactive Computer Graphics and Visual Computing where International Conferences have long been the dissemination mechanism of choice. While our Journal has also been affected by these changes, we are working with many top venues to help in providing both quality control and speedy publication via Special and Technical Sections as well as inviting authors of accepted papers to present their findings to selected conferences. This issue features papers from three special sections: Three-Dimensional Object Retrieval (3DOR) 2019 [1], [2], Graphics Interface 2019 [3] and STAG 2019 [4].

A novel approach by Bruno Roy, Eric Paquette, and Pierre Poulin [7], proposes particle upsampling as a fast and flexible post-processing approach to increase details in animations of splashing liquids. Their method computes a splash zone using the intersections between a selected volume and colliding objects. Their method can thus generate localized and parameterizable high-resolution splashes from either solid-liquid or liquid-liquid interactions, to produce customizable splashes as details on top of coarsely animated liquids.",

This provides interesting challenges and opportunities to apply crowd simulation as a means to analyze architectural designs for both feasibility and safety. Still, such simulations can be time- and labor-intensive, by requiring experts to tune parameters, adjust designs until reaching acceptable solutions. To obviate this, Kaidong Hu et al. [8] adopt a machine learning approach to learn relationships between crowd motion and building environments. They then apply optimization techniques to identify optimal environment layouts while considering crowd movement features, without needing to run crowd simulations. They demonstrate the effectiveness of the approach in real-world case studies, including the the Metropolitan Museum of Fine Arts.",
