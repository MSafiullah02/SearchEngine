Furthermore, local distributors of dehydrated amniotic membrane also encountered a delay in shipment. Meanwhile, we had two cases of Stevens Johnson Syndrome with total conjunctival epithelial defects requiring urgent amniotic membrane transplant. In view of this, we proceeded to amniotic membrane harvest according to the standard protocol [2] but adopted extra infection control measures.",
