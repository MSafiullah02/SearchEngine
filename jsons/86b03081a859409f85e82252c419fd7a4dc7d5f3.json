Adaptive heterologous immune responses have broad implications on infection, autoimmunity, allergy and transplant immunology. A better understanding of the mechanisms involved might ultimately open up possibilities for disease prevention, for example by vaccination. Methods: A structured literature search was performed using Medline and PubMed to provide an overview of the current knowledge on respiratoryvirus induced adaptive HI. Results: In HI the immune response towards one antigen results in an alteration of the immune response towards a second antigen. We provide an overview of respiratory virus-induced HI, including viruses such as respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), rhinovirus (RV), coronavirus (CoV) and in uenza virus (IV). We discuss T cell receptor (TCR) and humoral cross-reactivity as mechanisms of HI involving those respiratory viruses. Topics covered include HI between respiratory viruses as well as between respiratory viruses and other pathogens.

Furthermore, respiratory viruses have been implicated in the development of autoimmune diseases, such as narcolepsy, Guillain-Barr\u00e9 syndrome, type 1 diabetes or myocarditis. Finally, we discuss the role of respiratory viruses in asthma and the hygiene hypothesis, and review our recent ndings on HI between IV and allergens, which leads to protection from experimental asthma. Conclusion: Respiratory-virus induced HI may have protective but also detrimental e ects on the host. Respiratory viral infections contribute to asthma or autoimmune disease development, but on the other hand, a lack of microbial encounter is associated with an increasing number of allergic as well as autoimmune diseases. Future research might help identify the elements which determine a protective or detrimental outcome in HI-based mechanisms. ",

On the other hand, antibodies induced by viral infection contribute to autoimmune disease [11] and possibly play a role in alloreactivity [16] . Evidence suggests that T cell receptor (TCR) cross-reactivity is common between respiratory viruses [17, 18, 19, 20] , but it has also been shown between unrelated viruses [21, 22, 23] and even between viruses and other microbial species [23] . Cross-reactive T cells were shown to protect from heterologous virus challenge [18, 20] . Furthermore, pathogen-derived mimics of a tumor-associated antigen are able to enhance the T cell response towards the tumor antigen [24] . erefore, pathogen-derived epitopes might be used in a tumor vaccine. HI also has detrimental e ects on the host. For example, preexisting T memory (T m ) cells can restrict the priming of protective na\u00efve T cells to heterologous antigen [25] . Furthermore, pre-existing T m cells can narrow the primary T cell response by shi ing towards proliferation of high a nity clones only [26] . A narrowed T cell response may lead to escape variants and has been shown to be associated with severe disease progression [27, 28] . Furthermore, virus-mediated TCR cross-reactivity has also been shown to involve allo- [16] as well as autoantigens [11, 29] .

Major histocompatibility complex (MHC) molecules present peptide antigen to T cells in the form of peptide-MHC (pMHC) complexes. MHC I molecules present peptides 8 to 14 mers of length [41] . MHC class II molecules are able to present even longer peptides. e estimated number of divergent TCRs in the human native T cell pool is < 10 8 [42] , whereas the number of potential foreign peptides presented by MHC molecules is suggested to be > 10 15 [41] . Taken together, broad TCR cross-reactivity is inevitable for su cient immune protection [41, 43] . is theory is further supported by the nding that one TCR is able to recognize > 1 million di erent peptides presented by one MHC molecule [44] . Cross-reactivity is common between peptides with a high degree of sequence homology [23, 45, 46, 47] , but also peptides with little homology are able to elicit cross-reactive immune responses [29, 48, 49, 50, 51] . Moreover, TCR cross-reactivity is restricted to peptides of the same length, when presented via MHC class I [52] . Cross-recognition between seemingly non-related peptides might occur due to hotspot binding, where the peptide-TCR interaction is focused on a hotspot, while tolerating substitutions in other positions [53] .",

In agreement to earlier reports [150, 152] , we found that IV A infection of Balb/c mice confers protection against ovalbumin (OVA)-induced, but also house dust mite (HDM)-induced asthma. Protection was dependent on CD4 + and CD8 + T em cells, which were cross-reactive to IV Aand OVA-derived peptides, as predicted by bioinformatics analysis. Upon ex vivo restimulation with the predicted in uenza A-or OVA-derived peptides, lung T cells showed increased production of IL-2 and IFN\u03b3. Furthermore, peptide immunization with the predicted virus-derived peptides also provided asthma protection through T em cells. is is possibly due to the production of IFN\u03b3 by virus-speci c T cells upon allergen challenge, as an augmented IFN\u03b3 response can protect from experimental asthma [152] . us, we provide evidence for T em -mediated HI between viruses and allergens as a protective mechanism against allergic asthma ([153] ; Fig. 2 ).",
