Influenza is an infectious disease caused by influenza virus type A or B. The occurrence of influenza, whose viruses are characterized by great seasonal antigenic changeability, may vary in different districts of a country. In Poland, epidemiological surveillance of influenza was implemented in collaboration with primary care physicians and laboratories of 16 Voivodeship (province) Sanitary Epidemiological Station (VSES) as of the 2004/05 epidemic season. The information on influenza and influenza-like infections has been gathered in all districts by means of both Sentinel and non-Sentinel systems. Since the 2013/14 epidemic season, data consisting of the number of samples tested, suspected and confirmed cases of infection, hospitalizations, and deaths in each province are stratified into seven age-groups (Hallmann-Szeli\u0144ska et al. 2016a, b; Bednarska et al. 2015) . These data are then further elaborated and randomly checked for correctness of viral identification in the National Influenza Center (NIC) at the National Institute of Public Health-National Institute of Health (NIPH-NIH 2016). The NIC serves as a reference center for individual virological VSES laboratories of the country. The aim of the present study was to determine the regional differences of influenza activity in Poland in the 2015/16 epidemic season. The savvy of such differences might be of help in setting apart resources for preventive and therapeutic actions to combat the epidemic.
