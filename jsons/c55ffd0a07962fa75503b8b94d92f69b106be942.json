[5] [6] [7] However, current therapeutic options are limited to supportive treatment focusing on fluid and respiratory maintenance, and there is a need for more widely available and cost-effective preventative measures. 8 In addition, the mechanism by which RSV evades host defenses is not fully understood. 2 Clarifying RSV pathogenesis in humans and developing prophylactic or therapeutic strategies for RSV infection in the respiratory tract is required.",

RSV infection caused significant increases in Th2 cytokine mRNA levels in the lungs of WT mice; the IL-4 and IL-5 levels were increased 1.3 and 2.0 folds as compared to levels in the WT PBS group.

We found that BRP-39 (a mouse CHI3L1) was required for severe lung immunopathology caused by RSV infection, since BRP-39-deficient mice showed reduced weight loss, AHR, inflammatory cell infiltration, into the airway, and mucus production despite having a similar viral load to WT mice. Thus, BRP-39 could be a potential therapeutic target for IL-13dominant immunopathology associated with RSV infection. Breast regression protein-39 (BRP-39) deficiency attenuates respiratory syncytial virus (RSV)-induced inflammatory changes in mice. A-D, At 7 dpi, wild-type (WT) mice showed greater weight loss (A), airway resistance (B), and higher numbers of total and differentiated inflammatory cells in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (C).

Inflammatory responses induced by RSV infection were markedly decreased in BRP-39 knockout (KO) mice. Mucus production evaluated by periodic acid-Schiff staining (E) and ELISA (F). RSV infection increased mucus production in WT but not BRP-39 KO mice. G, Loss of BRP-39 had no effect on lung viral load at 1, 3, 5, 7, 10, and 14 dpi.

In panel B, ***P < 0.001 for WT RSV vs WT PBS and KO Breast regression protein-39 (BRP-39) regulates activation of Th2 inflammation. Lung tissue from each group was analyzed by flow cytometry. A, CD4+ and CD8+ T cell counts were higher in the wild-type (WT) respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) group and CD4+ T cell counts were lower in BRP-39 knockout (KO) mice. B, DCs were detected by staining with anti-CD11b, -CD11c, and -MHC II antibodies. In the absence of BRP-39, the number of DCs was decreased relative to RSV-infected WT mice. C, Eosinophil counts were higher in the lungs of RSV-infected WT as compared to BRP-39 KO mice. D-F, Th2 cytokine mRNA levels were determined by RT-PCR. IL-13 level was elevated in RSV-infected WT mice, whereas Th2 cytokine expression was not significantly increased by RSV infection in BRP-39 KO mice. G, IL-13 level in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) was increased in WT RSV mice, as determined by ELISA. H, IL-13 expression was evaluated in CD4+ T cells in BALF. I, IFN-\u03b3 production was increased in BALF after RSV infection in both WT and BRP-39 KO mice, as determined using a cytokine bead array. n.d., not detected; n.s., not significant. *P < 0.05, **P < 0.01, Moreover, in vivo neutralization of CHI3L1 using an anti-CHI3L1 antibody could decrease the severity of IL-13-dominant airway inflammation during RSV infection.Chitinase-like proteins (CLPs) are structurally similar to chitinases but lack enzymatic activity. Recent studies have shown that mammalian CLPs present at sites of inflammation and tissue remodeling do trigger immune responses and attract eosinophils and T cells, even in the case of parasitic infection.23,24 In allergic responses, CHI3L1 is a key regulator of Th2 inflammation, M2 macrophage differentiation, and Th2 cell and macrophage apoptosis/cell death. BRP-39 null mice showed significant defects in antigen-induced Th2 inflammation and IL-13-induced inflammation and remodeling.11,24 In humans, the relationship between YKL-40 and asthma development has also been demonstrated.9,10,25,26 CHI3L1    is known to bind to IL-13R\u03b12 composing a multimeric complex with IL-13, 27 but the mechanism by which CHI3L1/BRP-39/YKL-40 mediates downstream effects is poorly understood, and few studies have investigated the relationship between CHI3L1 and viral respiratory infections that induce Th2 inflammation or asthma.Respiratory syncytial virus is known as the major cause of severe LRTI in infants and young children, 2 and a causative agent in the pathogenesis of recurrent wheezing and asthma.[5][6][7] It is possible that a relationship exists between early-life RSV LRTI and late-onset asthma, but it is unclear whether RSV is a risk factor or a marker of predisposition to asthma. Identifying molecules involved in the RSVasthma pathway can provide a basis for preventing asthma development.Respiratory syncytial virus infection of airway epithelial cells and pulmonary macrophages leads to the upregulation of cytokines and chemokines such as MCP-1, IL-6, IL-8, TNF-\u03b1, RANTES, and IL-1\u03b2 and inflammatory cell recruitment into the lungs. Classically, CD4+ T cells are known to be associated with advanced airway inflammation in RSV infection.28,29 They are thought to be related to the development of wheezing and asthma through skew the immune system away from an antiviral Th1 response and toward a Th2 response.30,31 Th2 cytokines could contribute to enhancement of lung damage, which increases AHR, eosinophil chemotaxis, and mucus production.28,31,32 M2 macrophages induced by IL-4 and IL-13 are also known to be generated during RSV infection and to cause Th2-skewed immune responses leading to the development of asthma. 33,34 Recent studies have reported that epithelium-associated cytokines IL-25, IL-33, and thymic stromal lymphopoietin (TSLP) could induce Group 2 innate lymphoid cells (ILC2) proliferation and activation 35,36 ; however, their contribution to the pathophysiology of severe RSV infection remains unclear. We investigated the relationship between CHI3L1 and RSVinduced LRTI using BRP-39 null mice. BRP-39 production in the airway was increased following RSV infection, but airway inflammation was diminished in the absence of BRP-39, as were RSVinduced Th2 responses in the airway-especially IL-13 production -and increase of DCs and M2 macrophages. The observed decrease in Th2 inflammation during RSV infection may have been due to decreased population of DCs and M2 macrophages. Since DCs are considered as major antigen-presenting cells during RSV infection, their maturation and antigen recognition capacity could alter the cytokine milieu through a variety of mechanisms. 37,38 M2 macrophages are known to be critical for regulating immune response in severe acute viral infection via IL-4/IL-13-dependent differentiation, then activated M2 macrophages are considered as a contributor to IL-13 production in a positive feedback loop. 34,39 Thus, a deficiency of BRP-39 could alter the progression of inflammation induced by RSV infection without affecting the virus itself. Interestingly, anti-CHI3L1 antibody treatment 24 hours after RSV infection attenuated airway inflammation and the production of Th2 cytokines, especially IL-13. These results suggest that BRP-39 is required for RSV-induced airway inflammation and could serve as a potential therapeutic target for the treatment of RSV-related LRTI. Breast regression protein-39 (BRP-39) deficiency decreases M2 macrophage activation. A-D, Assessment of M2 macrophages in wild-type (WT) and BRP-39 knockout (KO) mice. A,C, CD206+ expressing alternatively activated macrophages and (B,D) arginase 1 activity were decreased in BRP-39 KO as compared to WT mice infected with respiratory syncytial virus. Values represent mean \u00b1 SD of at least three independent experiments. *P < 0.05, **P < 0.01, ***P < 0.001Although the precise mechanism was not investigated in this study, we predict that the regulation of CHI3L1 in RSV-induced inflammation involves NF-\u03baB signaling. In vitro studies have found that bronchial epithelial cells treated with YKL-40 showed increase of IL-8 production;this was dependent on MAPK (JNK and ERK) and NF-\u03baB pathway activation, which stimulated the proliferation and migration of bronchial smooth muscle cells40 ; moreover, IL-8 production was found to be enhanced via activation of NF-\u03baB signaling during RSV infection.41 Neutralizing chitinase 3-like 1 protein (CHI3L1) antibody suppresses respiratory syncytial virus (RSV)-induced airway inflammation. Anti-CHI3L1 antibody treatment in RSV-infected mice decreased inflammation caused by RSV infection. A, wild-type (WT) mice treated with anti-CHI3L1 antibody 24 h after RSV infection showed less body weight loss than RSV-infected mice without any treatment. B-F, At 7 dpi, AHR (B), total and differentiated bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) cells (C,D), and breast regression protein-39 levels (E,F) were evaluated. G, Airway inflammation and mucus production were assessed by H&E and periodic acid-Schiff staining, respectively. H, Mucus production was also measured by ELISA. I, There was no difference in viral load among groups. J-L, IL-13 was the most prominent Th2 cytokine in BALF induced by RSV infection and decreased by anti-CHI3L1 antibody treatment. M-O, Th2 cytokine mRNA levels in lungs were also decreased by treatment with anti-CHI3L1 antibody in RSV-infected mice, with IL-13 levels showing the greatest change. Data from three mice per group are plotted as mean \u00b1 SD. n.s., not significant. In panels B and C, *P < 0.05, **P < 0.01, ***P < 0.001 for WT PBS vs WT RSV and isotype control This study focused on RSV-induced Th2 inflammation during the adaptive immune phase, and the relationship between the airway epithelium and immune responses during early stages of infection was not investigated. Since TSLP-dependent Th2 immunopathology in the early phase of RSV infection was explained by IL-13-producing ILCs, 36 a positive feedback loop from TSLP-Th2 cytokines (IL-13) to BRP-39 24,42,43 might be possible to enhance Th2 inflammation during RSV infection. And IL-18, a unique cytokine that could stimulate Th1, Th2, and Th17, was proven to be also as a potent stimulator of BRP-9 in fibrotic diseases.44 IL-18 production could be also induced by RSV infection.45 During RSV infection, increased IL-18 could be thought to stimulate epithelial cells to produce BRP-39 and enhance Th2 inflammation. In addition, the expression of IL-13R\u03b12-a receptor for CHI3L1 during effector responses 27 was not investigated. Further studies examining innate immune responses (eg, epitheliumderived cytokines or ILC2s) during the early phases of RSV infection in BRP-39 null mice, as well as IL-13R\u03b12 expression and regulation in RSV infection are needed for a better understanding of the relationship between BRP-39 and RSV infection. A neonatal model of RSV infection in BRP-39 null mice may also be useful for investigating the role of BRP-39 in asthma development, which would be consistent with the role of early-life viral bronchiolitis in asthma inception. In conclusion, this study confirmed that the expression of CHI3L1 and IL-13 was significantly increased in the human NPA from children with RSV-related LRTI. Using BRP-39 KO mice, we demonstrated that BRP-39 is an important regulator of RSV-induced airway inflammation. RSV infection induced the upregulation of BRP-39 produced by macrophages and epithelial cells at sites of Th2 inflammation. BRP-39 deficiency attenuated weight loss, AHR, and Th2 (IL-13) responses as well as increase of DCs and M2 macrophage activation. Additionally, RSV-induced airway inflammation and",
