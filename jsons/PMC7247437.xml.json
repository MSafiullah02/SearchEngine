After a long delay at the airport in Hamburg they finally reached the hotel in Hurghada at 5:30 a.m. the next morning. Shortly after arrival, the journey continued with a 5\u2011h bus ride to Luxor, where they checked in on the Nile steamer at around 1:10 p.m. The long-awaited cruise vacation began the next morning with a visit to the Karnak and Luxor Temple and the Papyrus Gallery. They continued their journey over the Valley of the Kings, via Aswan to Abu Simbel. In the morning of the 28 February 2020 around 5:30 a.m. the man felt a sudden flickering of his eyes during the bus ride. Chills and dizziness accompanied his symptoms. He did not feel well the following days either. On Monday 2 March 2020, the man\u2019s condition worsened and the bad general symptoms were accompanied by nocturnal chills, dizziness and coughing. Gastrointestinal symptoms were added as the day progressed. On the following day the couple contacted a doctor who prescribed antibiotics, cough syrup and paracetamol. The apparent improvement was followed a short time later by a marked deterioration in the man\u2019s condition. Dizziness, coughing and general exhaustion put a strain on the holiday mood. The doctor was called in again and administered isotonic saline solution without improvement. The night of Friday was followed by admission to a local private clinic. High fever was added and a medical clarification and an X\u2011ray of the thorax were performed. Afterwards the wife was sent back to the hotel. The same night the man was transferred to a local hospital without contacting the wife. A smear test and a new X\u2011ray followed. The last time the wife saw her husband was on the evening of Friday 6 March 2020. Concern about the return to Germany, the critical hygiene conditions and the lack of feedback from medical staff in the hospital left the couple in the dark about the imminent drastic deterioration of the man\u2019s condition. When the wife heard about the death of a German man in Hurghada in the news on Sunday 8 March 2020, she was already back in her home town in Germany. The news of her husband\u2019s death was passed on to her that same evening by two police officers from the local police station. The man mentioned in the news was her husband. She first found out at this time that her husband had been transferred to another clinic in Hurghada as part of the further deterioration. For the following weeks she was put in enforced quarantine. The body of her husband was transferred to Germany with some delay. After the transfer, the embalmed body was taken to the Institute of Legal Medicine in Hamburg and examined there on the request of the relatives [3].",
