Game species also perform important functions as herbivores, seed predators, and seed dispersers, and the absence of these animals could lead to significant ecological chain effects (e.g., Redford 1992; Fragoso & Huffman 2000; Rold\u00e1n & Simonetti 2001). For both reasons, it is problematic that game populations in tropical rainforests are being overharvested (Redford 1992; Robinson & Bennett 2000).",

            "text": "Adjusting harvest levels based on the productivity of each game species requires understanding how different harvest levels affect game populations. In that respect, two important models have been constructed. First, Robinson and Redford (1991) calculated maximum sustainable yield (MSY) for Amazonian game mammals, based on species\u2010specific estimates of carrying capacity and intrinsic rate of natural increase (see also Slade et al. 1998). The MSYs are then compared with observed harvest rates to evaluate whether these rates are sustainable. The model has been used for evaluating the sustainability of hunting in tropical forests of South America (Alvard et al. 1997; Hill & Pawde 2000; Mena et al. 2000) and Africa (Fa et al. 1995; Fitzgibbon et al. 1995; Muchaal & Ngandjui 1999). Second, Bodmer (1994; see also Robinson & Bodmer 1999; Bodmer et al. 2000; Townsend 1996) elaborated a model based on population\u2010specific birth rates and densities to calculate production values for comparison with harvest rates. A practical problem with this method is that it requires the use of labor\u2010intensive line transects to calculate population density.",

These authors also point out that current methods do not incorporate spatial heterogeneity. Hunting effort in tropical forests is typically highest near human settlements. Therefore, densities of major game species tend to decrease with distance from settlements (Robinson & Bennett 2000; Peres & Lake 2003). Moreover, Townsend (1996), Begazo and Bodmer (1998), and Novaro et al. (2000) suggest that many areas function as source\u2010sink systems, where remote areas with low hunting pressure produce a surplus of animals that disperse to areas closer to settlements, where they are hunted. Thus, to understand the dynamics of the interactions between hunters and game populations, it is necessary to take into account two separate spatial phenomena: (1) uneven distribution of hunting effort, which tends to create gradients in animal densities and (2) animal dispersal, which tends to smooth out these gradients.",

            "text": "The approach we used is different from that of previous models. Instead of asking how much can be sustainably harvested, we asked where production can be increased. We believe that this question is relevant to the management of Amazonian wildlife because, for instance, no\u2010take areas have been proposed by scientists as promising management tools in situations with a high level of uncertainty (e.g., Quinn et al. 1993; Mosquera et al. 2000; Milner\u2010Gulland & Ak\u00e7akaya 2001; Lockwood et al. 2002). Specifically, we show that hunting effort, harvest rate, and catch per unit of effort (CPUE) varied over the hunting territory of an Amazonian community. We then used this spatial gradient of hunting effort as a quasi\u2010experimental setting and, for each species, made a preliminary assessment of the spatial extent of overharvest, where overharvest means that animal density is reduced to a point where its full productive potential is not realized. Finally, we developed a spatially explicit model to evaluate how animal dispersal affects observed spatial patterns of harvest rates and CPUE.",

The community consisted of five clustered hamlets (Fig. 1) of 137 households and 960 inhabitants.

Shotguns were the dominant hunting weapons, although occasionally spears, blowguns, machetes, or stones were used. Most hunting was done by walking, sometimes with a dog, through the forest in the daytime. At night, hunters with torchlights followed waterways. Hunters also waited for animals at fallen fruit or at bait they had set, for instance when hunting large rodents and armadillos and occasionally when hunting deer and tapir. To hunt birds that sing at night, hunters first located the tree where the bird was singing and then waited there until dawn to shoot it. We recorded hunting kills of over 60 species, but we limited our analysis to the 12 most preferred game species (Table 2).",

Primarily, we used the household as our sampling unit because this provided a sample of both frequent and occasional hunters. Random sampling was not an option because some people initially regarded the project with suspicion and could have misinterpreted a random selection of their households as an attempt of coercion. Avoiding such potential sources of conflict was particularly important because the fieldwork coincided with a period of extreme social tension related to planned oil\u2010prospecting activities in the area. Therefore, because sampling was based on voluntary participation, we could have a skewed sample. To control for this possibility, we asked key informants from each hamlet to group the households into four categories according to their level of hunting activity: (1) do not hunt, (2) hunt little, (3) hunt much nearby, or (4) hunt much far away. This grouping showed that households of all categories, except that of do not hunt, were fairly equally represented among participants. Excluding the households that do not hunt, 122 households remained. Out of these, 85 households (70%) participated in the study. We are therefore confident that the participating households constitute a representative sample of the community.",

The other side of the form contained drawings of 58 game animals, with the local name and columns for indicating the area number, hunting method (according to categories indicated in Table 2), and habitat. The drawings made it possible for illiterate people to indicate the number of animals hunted by putting crosses next to the animal.

During this period, participating households in hamlets changed about every 3 months, usually in connection to hamlet workshops, where we presented results and treated issues related to the project. The sample was geographically stratified because the number of participating households from each hamlet was roughly proportional to the total number of households in the hamlet. Similarly, during school vacations, when households move to secondary homes to enjoy better hunting and fishing, households were grouped into eight geographical zones. The number of households in the sample increased with time from 14 to 24. To avoid bias due to variation in sample size between seasons, we applied month\u2010specific weighting factors when converting the harvest data to an estimate of annual harvest in each area.",

To aggregate the areas into hunting effort zones, we first smoothed the hunting effort with geographic information system software. We converted the map into a grid of cells of 250 \u00d7 250 m, in which each cell was assigned the average hunting effort of all cells within the surrounding 8 \u00d7 8 km square. We calculated the smoothed value for each area as the average value for all cells within the area. Finally, areas were grouped into seven zones according to hunting effort: zone 1 had the lowest hunting effort and zone 7 the highest (Fig. 1). Hunting effort for each zone was calculated by summing the original (unsmoothed) values for all the areas within a zone and dividing by the total area of the zone.",

Using CPUE as a proxy for density rests on the assumption that an animal encounter always leads to a hunting attempt, which is fairly reasonable for the 12 species we examined. For A. paca, D. fuliginosa, N. urumutum, and M. salvini, which were frequently hunted using sit\u2010and\u2010wait methods, only hunting kills achieved when walking were included in the calculations of CPUE. For other species, particularly Mazama spp., T. terrestris, and M. salvini, even when these species had been hunted with sit\u2010and\u2010wait methods, the actual encounter (finding tracks or hearing song) occurred while walking. Therefore, all hunting kills of these species, regardless of method, were included in the calculations of CPUE.",

A decreasing harvest rate with increasing hunting effort indicates overharvest because the local population is reduced below the density that yields maximum production.

Also, T. terrestris has a home range large enough to span two or three hunting\u2010intensity zones, and the use of spatial pattern of harvest rate and CPUE as indicators probably underestimated the extent of overharvesting. Finally, the classification of A. belzebuth into group 4, representing species showing no signs of overharvesting, is a puzzle, given that a similar species, L. lagotricha, is severely overharvested. We believe that A. belzebuth, being a highly social species, actually increased its dispersal rate when its population density got so low that dispersing individuals had a hard time finding groups to join. The observed increase in harvest rate with increase in hunting effort therefore was probably a result of a high dispersal rate.

For instance, Robinson and Redford's (1991) method may be more powerful if contrasting heavily hunted and less hunted areas on a relatively small spatial scale, as in our study. Our analysis showed that their method failed to identify any species in our study area as overharvested (Table 2), but at the finer spatial scale (the seven zones of hunting effort) it did identify overharvested zones for some species (Fig. 3a, 3e, & 3x).",

The CPUE values could then be converted into population density estimates for comparison with estimated carrying capacities or for calculating production. Furthermore, our method and Bodmer's method complement each other because line\u2010transect inventories are more feasible in areas with high animal densities than in heavily hunted areas with low densities (Bodmer et al. 2000).

However, these problems would be reduced through improved knowledge of animal dispersal rates. Appropriate field methods for observing dispersal are available (e.g., Campbell & Sussman 1994; Fragoso 1998), and such data should be collected in a way that allows for quantitative expressions on dispersal rates (Turchin 1998).",

The CPUE estimates in our study could be improved by refining the classification of hunting methods. It would, for instance, be desirable to collect information on the use of dogs because hunters used dogs in zones close to the village but less so in remote areas. This may be one reason the CPUE estimates were high for L. lagotricha in zone 1 and why the maximum CPUE for T. terrestris and T. tajacu was not found in zone 1 but in zones of slightly higher hunting effort. Similarly, it would be desirable to collect information on such hunting methods, such as digging out animals from burrows, or on the variability in walking speed between the wide trails near the village and the almost invisible trails in remoter areas.",

Such areas may be the most viable option for wildlife managers in tropical forests. Parallel to this research, we facilitated a process in the community of discussing the problems and possible solutions of wildlife depletion. Community members suggested that the establishment of no\u2010take areas may be a strategy with a potential for success. The management of such areas can be based on traditional arrangements of hunting rights and existing social structures, whereas banning hunting of certain endangered species may be less socially feasible. In the design of no\u2010take areas, we suggest that a first step would be the identification of a limited number of target species, to reduce the complications of multispecies management. We further argue that these species should show clear indications of being overharvested but remain important sources of game meat. Moreover, no\u2010take areas should probably be established where animal densities are reduced but still high enough to have the potential to recover within a reasonable time span. Unless a fairly quick recovery can be observed, motivation on the part of hunters to maintain and comply with hunting restrictions is likely to deteriorate. To adopt these criteria for the present situation, we suggest that three potential target species within the following zones have the most certain potential for fairly rapid improvement: L. lagotricha in zones 2 and 3, T. terrestris in zone 4, and T. tajacu in zones 3 to 6.",
