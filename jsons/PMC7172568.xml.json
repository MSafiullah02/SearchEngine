Currently, four genotypes have been described (HBoV1\u20134) [3]. Based on seroprevalence studies, HBoV-specific antibodies in adults range from 64 to 95%, indicating the high number of HBoV encounters [4]. HBoV infection in children has been associated with respiratory tract infections (HBoV1\u20132) and gastrointestinal disease (HBoV2\u20134) [3]. HBoV infection results often in a mild self-limiting respiratory tract infection and may even be asymptomatic [3], [5]. Many children shed HBoV in the respiratory tract for prolonged periods, making interpretation of a positive test result in a patient difficult [6]. Nonetheless, a few case reports describe HBoV as the cause of severe acute respiratory tract infection (SARI) in children requiring intensive care. Although the role of other pathogens was addressed, co-infections were not excluded using a structured method [3], [7], [8], [9], [10], [11], [12], [13], [14]. Altogether, this has resulted in the on-going debate of whether HBoV as the single causative agent can cause disease.",

Only patients with SARI as the reason for admission were included (see Table 1\nand Supplementary material, Table S1). Fourth, absence of bacterial co-infections was considered likely if C-reactive protein (CRP) levels were \u226440 mg/L upon admission and bacterial cultures tested negative, such as sputum, blood or cerebrospinal fluid cultures. We defined a sputum culture negative if ten or fewer bacteria per ocular field were present in Gram staining, if no respiratory pathogenic bacteria were cultured, and/or when commensal bacterial growth was \u22642/4. Sputa containing fewer than ten epithelial cells per ocular field (10 \u00d7 10 magnification) were considered quality sputa. Sputa containing ten or more epithelial cells per ocular field were only considered quality sputa if the leucocyte-to-epithelial cell ratio was \u226510 and more than six bacteria with the same morphology were present.

We used the VP1/VP2 genes for sequence analysis, after which a phylogenetic tree was reconstructed. Samples tested were HBoV RT-PCR-positive selected cases for NGS and selected controls. Controls were samples of patients with Ct-value <30, which is the minimum requirement to sequence HBoV in this method. These control samples were obtained from children whether or not they were admitted to PICU, without SARI and with co-infections. Two samples were obtained from children born in hospital and admitted for more than 90 days and were called nosocomially infected controls. All samples were amplified and sequenced as described previously [22]. Phylogenetic analyses were conducted with MEGA version 5.",

We found a significantly lower median Ct-value in the selected cases than in patients who were also admitted to PICU, but who had viral co-detection. This may indicate that a single recent HBoV infection is associated with a higher viral load than in combination with other viruses, as suggested previously by other studies [13], [26], [27]. Based on the age of the patients and the low Ct-values we assume that the severe HBoV infection was a consequence of a primary infection [13]. Furthermore, we compared the median Ct-values of selected cases with patients not admitted to PICU with HBoV and found that the Ct-values of the selected cases were also significantly lower, suggesting a direct relation between disease severity and viral load as reported by others [10], [13], [27]. Interestingly, others have also found a relation between Ct-values, gender and underlying disease. Unfortunately our sample size was too small to confirm or refute these findings [13].",

            "text": "In order to benchmark our algorithm that was used to exclude patients with viral and bacterial co-infections, we also applied it to patients with RSV infection. We only found 14 cases with RSV as the single causative agent for SARI. Considering the incidence of RSV-associated hospitalizations, this is lower than expected [17]. We were able to benchmark our algorithm, although it seems to be very stringent and results in an underestimation of the true HBoV epidemiology. It is therefore of note that we did not set out to estimate the true burden of disease of HBoV, but to establish whether HBoV by itself can cause SARI. Our study is subject to several limitations. It may be argued that the retrospective nature of this study and its inherent limitations may have resulted in a sample bias. Blood samples for HBoV serology or PCR were not obtained, because these are not routinely tested at our hospital. Furthermore, not all bacteriology samples were obtained, as more invasive procedures would have had to be carried out to fully rule out the role of bacteria in lower respiratory tract infections. These are currently not routinely practiced in critically ill children for ethical and technical reasons. As an alternative we set strict CRP levels to our inclusion criteria. Based on previously published data we set a lower cut-off for bacterial co-infections (40 mg/L) than the usually applied 80 mg/L, to minimize the contribution of bacterial infections to the observed disease. In addition, during non-structured follow up, none of the patients showed an increase in CRP levels >80 mg/L. Still, in two cases a moderate increase was observed and it should be noted that despite these low CRP levels, bacterial involvement cannot be fully ruled out based on CRP levels alone [28], [29], [30]. Other biomarkers such as pro-calcitonin and interleukins could have been used to differentiate between bacterial and viral infections, but these were not carried out in our hospital [30], [31].",
