For example, during the outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) in 2003, people adopted some simple self-protective actions after they got the SARS-related information, including reducing travel, avoiding crowded places, washing hands frequently, staying at home, wearing a mask and so forth. The spontaneous protection of the public, combined with some compulsory measures implemented by governments or departments of health and hygiene, effectively controlled the spread of the disease [1], [2], [3], [4], [5], [6], [7]. about the researches on the effect of individual behavior on the transmission of disease attracted much attention [8], [9], [10], [11], [12], [13], [14], [15], [16], [17]. For example, Funk et al. studied the effect of locally spreading awareness on the transmission of disease, and they found that in a well-mixed population, the spread of awareness can reduce the size of the outbreak, but cannot enhance the transmission of threshold [18]. Kiss et al. studied the impact of health information dissemination on epidemic outbreaks, and they found that if information spread fast enough, infection cannot survive [19].",

Besides, there are many differences between the topology structure of the information network and the contact network. However, most previous works assumed that the transmission of information and epidemic occurred on the same network but with different dynamics [20], [21]. Recently, some scholars began to study the interplay dynamics of information and epidemic on multiplex networks [22], [23], [24], [25]. For instance, Granell et al. established an SIS-UAU model, and used a Microscopic Markov Chain Approach to investigate the intertwined competition effects between awareness diffusion and epidemic transmission on multiplex networks, and they found that the threshold of epidemic depended on the awareness dynamics and the topology of information network [26]. They also extended their model to the general scenario where acquiring awareness did not imply total immunization, and analyzed the effect of mass media on epidemic transmission dynamics [27]. Mengfeng Sun et al. proposed a concrete interplay between individuals and spread of disease in quenched multiplex networks, and they found the phenomenon of oscillation in epidemic network with adaptive behaviors [28].",

In other words, they cannot spread disease-related information to others, but they can infect others. There is the other scenario, they know that they are infected through medical examination or other means, but they worry about being discriminated against or isolated, so asymptomatic infected individuals may not choose to tell others the fact that they are infected. In both cases, the asymptomatic infection can affect individuals\u2019 assessment of risk and then may make inappropriate behavioral responses.",

They found that asymptomatic infection had an important impact on the disease dynamics. However, they did not consider the dissemination of disease-related information, and assumed that susceptible individuals got disease information and took behavioral responses only when they contact with I-state individuals. In reality, individuals can get disease-related information from other individuals and take protective actions before an infected person appears in their neighborhoods [18], [31]. Moreover, most previous researches assumed that the aware susceptible individuals can get infected with a smaller infection rate than an unaware susceptible individual, and the infection rate is same for all the aware individuals [19], [26], [27], [32]. However, heterogenetic individuals [33] with different infected neighbors and perceived infection risk [34], [35], [36], [37] took various behavioral responses and their infection rates were also different. Some studies incorporated the heterogeneity of individuals\u2019 perceived risk into individual behavior response model and got some interesting results. Wu et al. assumed that individuals\u2019 perceived infection risk depended on local information, global information and contact information. They found that local information and contact information could enhance the epidemic threshold [38]. Zhang et al. assumed that individuals took behavioral response based on the number of infected neighbors, and they found that hub nodes with different roles in speeding the spread of disease and preventing the transmission of disease [39]. Therefore, it is necessary to consider the impact of the individuals\u2019 heterogeneity on disease transmission in order to better predict and control the disease spread.",

As described in Fig. 1, we build a multiplex network with two layers that one is physical contact layer on where the disease spreads and the other is information layer on where the dissemination of information evolves [30]. On the information layer, we use a UAU (Unaware\u2013Aware\u2013Unaware) process to describe the disease-related information dissemination. U-state (Unaware state) individuals do not acquired any information about the disease, and have not perceived any infection risk. A-state (Aware state) individuals are aware of the infection risk and can transmit their information to their neighbors on the information layer. Each A-state individual transmits the disease information to their U-state neighbors on information layer with a probability \u03bb. A-state individuals lose (forget) the disease information and return to state of U-state with a probability \u03b4. On physical contact layer, we adopt the SEIS (Susceptible\u2013Exposed\u2013Infected\u2013Susceptible) epidemiological model. S-state (Susceptible state) nodes get infected and firstly go to E-state (Exposed state) with a probability \u03b2, and then E-state individuals enter the I-state with a probability \u03c3, and I-state nodes can go back to the S-state with a recovery rate \u03bc. The interaction between information dissemination and disease transmission is modeled as follows. A U-state node on information layer will automatically become aware and transmit the disease information to their neighbors on the information layer once its counterpart on contact layer enter I-state. Similarly, S-state nodes on contact layer will take behavior response for reducing susceptibility once their counterpart on information layer become A-state.",

            "text": "We do not consider the heterogeneity of individuals\u2019 perceived risk in basic model. In reality, individuals who have different numbers of infected neighbors perceive different level of infection risk and take different behavior responses. In addition, existing works usually assumed that only susceptible individuals adopted protective measures, and E-state individuals did not take behavioral response [30], [32], [41], [42]. However, owing to E-state individuals have no obvious clinical symptoms, most of them are not aware that they have been infected, so they will take behavioral responses as susceptible individuals when they perceive the infection risk. In this study, we assume that S-state individuals and E-state individuals change their behaviors based on the number of I-state neighbors. We adopt exponential function to describe the susceptibility of S-state individuals and infectivity of E-state individuals. If a S-state(E-state) node i has kiinf I-state neighbors, then the susceptibility (infectivity) of node i reduces to e\u2212\u03b1kiinf\n(\u03b2e\u2212\u03b1kiinf )(\u03b1\u22650), where \u03b1 stands for individuals\u2019 sensitivity for perceived infection risk and individuals are more sensitive to the risk of disease when \u03b1 is larger. From Fig. 2, we can observe that in the case of \u03b1\n= 0.2, individuals will take strong protective measures only when the number of I-state neighbors reaches 20; however, in the case of \u03b1\n= 1, individuals will take strong protective behavior as long as one infected appears in their neighbors. In this part, we focus on the impact of the individual heterogeneity on the transmission of disease. Therefore, for simplifying the individual heterogeneity model, we only consider one scenario that I-state individuals cannot spread viruses, and the transmission rate pij between susceptible individual i and infected individual (E-state or I-state) j is shown in Table 2.",

Fig. 5 describes the density of sum of I-state and E-state nodes for different values of \u03c3. The panels depict the scenarios where I-state individuals can spread viruses (left) and I-state individuals cannot spread viruses (right). The parameter \u03c3 accounts for the transition rate of infected individuals from asymptomatic to obvious symptomatic. From Fig. 5, we can see that, for high values of \u03c3, the fraction of I-state and E-state nodes are diminished, and the onset of the epidemic is enhanced. The result is not difficult to understand. Since increasing \u03c3 means that asymptomatic infected individuals more quickly enter I-state and then unaware nodes have more chances to obtain disease-related information; As a result, the epidemic size is reduced and the epidemic threshold is enhanced. We can also see, if comparing with the left and right panels, we can also see that \u03c3 has a more pronounced influence in the right panel.",

The parameter \u03b8 regulates the susceptibility of A-state nodes which ranges from 0 (representing total immunization) to 1. From Fig. 6, we can observe that for low values of \u03b8 the fraction of I-state and E-state nodes is lowed, and the onset of the epidemic is slightly enhanced. With the decreasing of \u03b8, the susceptibility of A-state nodes is reduced. That is the reason why decreasing the value of \u03b8 can effectively suppress the outbreak of epidemic.",

The stationary fraction of I-state and E-state nodes decreases significantly with the increasing of \u03c3.

We analyzed the effect of asymptomatic infection on the coupled process of awareness/information and disease under different circumstances and obtained some interesting results. The results based on Microscopic Markov Chain approach and Monte-Carlo approach revealed that the size of infection can be reduced once the transition rate form E-state to I-state \u03c3 is increased or the reduction factor of susceptibility \u03b8 is decreased. In addition, the impact of asymptomatic infection on the epidemic dynamic is more pronounced in the case of I-state individuals not spreading viruses than in the case of I-state individuals spreading viruses. We further extended the model by considering the heterogeneity of individuals\u2019 perceived risk. The results showed that \u03c3 still had an impact on the epidemic dynamics, and the density of infection could be reduced with the increase of individual\u2019s sensitivity degree to infection risk \u03b1, but \u03b1 did not have an obvious impact on the epidemic threshold.",
