On January 30, the World Health Organization (WHO) declared the outbreak as a public health emergency of international concern [2]. By February 28, 2020, China had reported the highest numbers: 78961 confirmed cases and 2791 deaths. Even after China' s whole society' s effort saved the time for other countries for better preparation, the situation has evolved into a pandemic. A total of 51 countries outside of China reported having suspected and confirmed cases. Among them, the Republic of Korea (2337 confirmed cases and 13 deaths), Japan (210 cases and 4 deaths), Iran (245 cases and 26 deaths), Italy (650 confirmed cases and 17 deaths) are suffering most [3]. On February 28, the WHO have assessed and increased the spread risk and impact of the COVID-19 from high to very high at a global level [4] .",

Accordingly, the COVID-19 can spread through contact via droplets from cough and sneeze, eating together, etc. It is necessary to get self-quarantined when a person shows some clinical symptoms. They shall contact a hospital for laboratory test confirmation as soon as possible. In this case, they shall avoid social activities so as not to infect others. However, exemptions always happen. People who are suspected or confirmed of the infections may conceal their infections and still behave the same way, interacting with people, causing a lot of unnecessary infections. In fact, this scenario could happen everywhere. Therefore, relevant laws and regulations are urgently required to be in place for better prevention and control the spread of COVID-19.",
