Although the reduction in the sodium current manifests with characteristic electrocardiographic abnormalities, patients with the Brugada syndrome are often healthy and unaware of their genetic predisposition. As a result, the diagnosis of Brugada syndrome is often made after syncope or aborted sudden cardiac arrest.4",
