The primary efficacy endpoint was \u22651 stage improvement in fibrosis on liver biopsy without worsening of NASH. Additional endpoints included changes in noninvasive tests (NITs), progression to cirrhosis (in STELLAR-3), and the development of liver-related events. Unfortunately, although selonsertib was well tolerated, neither trial met or had a trend for meeting the primary endpoint. Unfortunately, although selonsertib led to dose-dependent reductions in hepatic phospho-p38 expression, suggestive of pharmacodynamic activity, dose dependent activity was not seen, nor did it significantly impact any of the endpoints.",

The proportion of patients with \u2265 1 stage reduction in fibrosis in both selonsertib arms (n=30 and 27, respectively) were numerically higher but not statistically different from that observed in the simtuzumab arm (n=20). Simtuzumab, because of a lack of efficacy in the 105/106 studies, was, perhaps fatefully ignoring the possibility of synergy with selonsertib, equated with placebo.[2] It is difficult to know if the lack of statistical superiority of selonsertib in Phase 2 was a function of inadequate power, because of underdosing or due to true lack of efficacy. Furthermore, placebo should not be supplanted by a pharmacologic intervention irrespective of lack of efficacy in a prior trial. It is difficult to know if additional elements such as the exclusion of stage 2 patients in STELLAR 3 would have positively impacted the outcome. Preliminary data from the Atlas study raise the theoretical potential for SEL, perhaps at higher doses, to be used in synergy with other agents.[6]",

Of particular interest was the demonstration that enhanced liver fibrosis (ELF) had the ability to identify those most likely to progress from F3 to cirrhosis in addition to predicting which patients with cirrhosis at baseline were most likely to have a liver related event. The authors defined a change in ELF of 0.5 points, as that value correlated with clinical liver events in a previous study, [2] which correlated in the current study with other NITs, liver biochemistry tests, glycemic parameters, CK-18 values, serum bile acid values, and body weight -- but not histologic features. These findings give hope that at some point reliance on histologic endpoints will be a historical concept for NASH clinical trials.",

In comparing available data from NASH cirrhosis trials, the significant difference in liver related events ranges from 3% (selonsertib) to 21% (emricasan) per annum.[2, 4] These seemingly disparate estimates in rates of decompensation can be explained by differences in various factors such as Model for End-Stage Liver Disease (MELD), HVPG, hepatic collagen content and to what extent clinical events were adjudicated. The STELLAR studies provided additional support for ELF to identify those at highest risk of decompensation. Second, and surprising, cardiac outcomes, measured via major adverse cardiac events (MACE), were nearly 6-fold higher among patients with compensated cirrhosis than among those with bridging fibrosis. This difference is unexplained, although it may reflect a higher prevalence of structural abnormalities, such as cardiomyopathy, in patients with cirrhosis. These lessons will inform more careful stratification and therefore more accurate prediction of outcomes for the design of future trials.",
