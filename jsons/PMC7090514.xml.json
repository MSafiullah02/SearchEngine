In China, IFN-\u03b1 is available in injections, sprays, gels, etc. IFN-\u03b1 nebulization or spray are commonly used in children for treating bronchiolitis [3, 4], herpes angina [5, 6], hand-foot-mouth disease [7, 8], etc. In the experts' consensus statements, it could be also used for treatment of COVID-19 in children [9], IFN-\u03b1 is the only antiviral drug which is clearly recommended to be used in children with COVID-19.",

Growth and development inhibition is more common when combining IFN-\u03b1 with ribavirin. Suicidal ideation is more common in children (mainly adolescents) compared with adults (2.4% vs. 1%) [12].

In China, LPVr oral solution is suitable for children aged 6 months or older [16]. Differences in age limitation maybe due to different excipients and the manufacture process used. The dosage regimen of LPVr was recommended as follows [17]: LPVr tablets (200 mg/50 mg): 12 mg/3 mg/kg every time for the children with 7\u201315 kg body weight (BW); for those with BW of 15\u201340 kg, 10 mg/2.5 mg/kg every time; for those with BW of 40 kg or more, 400 mg/100 mg can be administrated every time.

Children are more likely to present with adverse reactions such as rash and vomiting, these symptoms should be closely monitored in children.

LPVr should be cautiously used while combining with drugs metabolized by CYP3A enzyme or drugs affecting CYP3A enzyme activity.
