            "text": "In 1881, Ribbert noted large cells in kidney cells of a stillborn, which he later described as \u201cprotozoan-like\u201d in 1904. These large cells had eccentric nuclei surrounded by a clear halo. Ribbert did not appreciate the significance of his findings until he read the report by Gesionek and Kiolemenoglou published in the same year, describing similar structures in the lungs, liver, and kidney of an 8-month-old fetus. In Ribbert's laboratory in 1907, Lowenstein found these protozoan-like large cells in the parotid glands of infants. Lowenstein was the first to appreciate that these large inclusions were in the nucleus. In 1911, Pettavel described similar inclusions in the thyroid gland of a premature infant. Later, in 1921, Goode, Pasteur, and Talbot reported a case of a 6-week-old infant with intranuclear eosinophilic inclusions similar to those previously described and were the first to use the term \u201ccytomegalia.\u201d They did not believe that the large inclusion bodies in the nucleus represented protozoa. In 1925, von Glahn and Pappenheimer described the first adult case of cytomegalovirus (CMV) infection in a male who had an amebic liver abscess; inclusion bodies were found in the lungs and in the intestines. They concluded that the inclusions in this case were similar to those seen in other herpes virus infections. In 1934, Chaudry was the first to definitively link intracellular inclusion bodies with specific viral infections. In 1950, Wyatt and colleagues reported that inclusions (CMV) were always present in renal tubules and reasoned that inclusions might be present in urine specimens. They also coined the term, \u201cgeneralized cytomegalic inclusion disease,\u201d which was first described by Wolbach in 1932. Wyatt was the first to diagnose cytomegalic inclusion disease (CID) antemortem in an infant. In the early 1950s, Mercer and Margileth also showed that CID could be diagnosed by demonstrating inclusion cells in voided urine. Electron microscopy was first used by Minder in 1953 to visualize intracellular inclusions of CMV in the pancreas.1, 2, 3, 4, 5\n",

In the late 1950s, Enders and his colleagues developed tissue culture techniques to isolate poliovirus. In 1954, Smith isolated mouse CMV in cell culture and human CMV was cultured in human cell lines Boston and Bethesda. In 1965, Clemola and Kariainen first described CMV (heterophile-negative) infectious mononucleosis in adults. The isolation and identification of CMV led the way to more sophisticated diagnostic methods. Widespread organ transplantation increased interest in CMV because it was the most important pathogen isolated in these immunosuppressed patients. In cases of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection, retinitis, acalculous cholecystitis, esophagitis, colitis, or encephalitis, CMV is an important infection most commonly presenting as a prolonged febrile response, which is a hallmark of CMV infection. Not unexpectedly, CMV has been reported as a cause of fever of unknown origin in children and adults. CMV continues to be an important infection in immunocompetent hosts, for example, CMV infectious mononucleosis and postperfusion syndrome. In other compromised hosts (eg, patients with systemic lupus erythematosus [SLE]) and those on immunosuppressive drugs (eg, patients with Crohn's disease), CMV not uncommonly presents as CMV infectious mononucleosis, fever of unknown origin (FUO), or severe community-acquired pneumonia (CAP).1, 4, 5\n",

In 1970, Sterner and colleagues7 reported the case of a 27-year-old woman with CMV postperfusion syndrome who later developed CMV CAP. In 1972, Klemola and colleagues8 reported 2 more cases of CMV CAP in immunocompetent adults. Klemola's report was the first to describe in detail the features of CMV CAP in immunocompetent adults. He reported that prolonged fever was the predominant presenting sign of CMV CAP. His 2 patients with CMV CAP, a 35-year-old woman and a 60-year-old woman, had no cough or respiratory symptoms but did have prolonged fevers and bilateral basilar patchy/interstitial infiltrates on chest radiograph (CXR). The CMV infiltrates resolved slowly over 6 weeks. He noted that the diagnostic clues to CMV CAP were relative lymphopenia, atypical lymphocytes, and mildly elevated serum transaminases. Typically, initial CMV IgM titers were negative in his patients, but later they developed elevated CMV IgM/IgG titers. CMV viruria was present in both of his cases.",

Also there are human herpes viruses HHV-6, HHV-7, and HHV-8. The family of Herpesviridae is divided into 3 subfamilies, representing the HSVs (Alphaherpesvirinae), CMVs (Betaherpesvirinae), and the lymphocryptoviruses (Gammaherpesvirinae). Human CMV (HHV-5), one of the Betaherpesvirinae CMVs, has distinctive characteristics; it (1) has DNA molecular weight of 150 \u00d7 106; (2) grows only in human cells and has a narrow host range, that is, humans; (3) grows best in human fibroblasts; (4) has a relatively slow reproductive cycle (>24 hours); and (5) has distinctive inclusion bodies contained in the nuclei and cytoplasm. Infected host cells are enlarged cytomegalia with nuclear and cytoplasmic inclusions. CMV has a predilection for salivary glands but is not present in parotid or submandibular glands or sublingual glands. After the kidneys, the lungs are the most common sites of infection in acquired-CMV infection.1, 4, 5\n",

Because only CMV produces perinuclear cytoplasmic inclusions, cytopathologic diagnosis is possible.

The differential diagnosis of patients who present without focal/lobar infiltrates on CXR with hypoxemia with either minimal or no infiltrates or bilateral symmetric interstitial infiltrates on CXR includes HIV-infected patients with PCP, immunosuppressed patients, or patients with viral pneumonias, such as, influenza (human, avian, swine); severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS); hantavirus pulmonary syndrome (HPS); or CMV. The viral CAPs, presenting as severe CMV infection, initially present with minimal or no pulmonary infiltrates on CXR but are accompanied by various degrees of hypoxemia. The degree of hypoxemia is related to the degree of oxygen diffusion defect caused by interstitial pathogens. The severity of viral CAP in normal hosts is directly related to the degree and duration of hypoxemia. The magnitude of the oxygen diffusion defect caused by viral involvement of the lung interstitium in severe viral CAPs is best assessed by the alveolar-arterial (A-a) gradient. Patients presenting with severe viral CAP typically have increased A-a gradients of more than 35. The CXR appearance of CMV CAP is not distinctive (Fig. 1\n).11, 12, 14 The CXR is most helpful in excluding other pathogens or disorders in the differential diagnosis, that is, either focal infiltrates due to typical/atypical bacterial CAP pathogens or disorders that may mimic severe CAP. Typically, severe CMV CAP presents with no infiltrates, rapidly followed by bilateral patchy interstitial infiltrates most prominent in both lung bases. In immunocompetent patients presenting with otherwise unexplained severe CAP, with minimal or no infiltrates or bilateral symmetric interstitial infiltrates and hypoxemia with an increased A-a gradient. CMV should be included in the differential diagnosis when there are other clinical features of CMV that suggest CMV versus other causes of severe viral CAP. The associated features obtained from history, physical examination, and nonspecific laboratory tests can limit differential diagnostic possibilities and should prompt specific CMV diagnostic testing (Table 1\n).1, 3, 8, 14\n",

SLE pneumonitis, per se, does not usually present as CAP with severe hypoxemia.13 The clinical problem is to recognize that pulmonary infiltrates in a patient with SLE during flare may represent CAP, not SLE pneumonitis. Pneumonitis is characterized by migratory pulmonary infiltrates with or without pleural effusions.11 SLE is a multisystem disorder that affects nearly all organs except the liver. If a patient with SLE flare has increased serum transaminases, CMV should be suspected as the cause of the SLE flare.13, 14, 17, 19 CMV characteristically involves the liver, which is manifested by mild elevations of the serum transaminases. SLE patients with flare and increased serum transaminases do not have lupoid hepatitis (autoimmune hepatitis) and should be viewed as having CMV-precipitated SLE flare until proved otherwise. CMV not only can induce the SLE flare but also may infect lung interstitium and present as severe viral CAP in patients with SLE. SLE pneumonitis, per se, is not accompanied by severe hypoxemia or a high A-a gradient.13, 14 With SLE flare, the presence of severe hypoxemia and increased A-a gradient and mildly increased serum transaminases (aspartate aminotransferase/alanine aminotransferase) should suggest superimposed CMV. Untreated SLE patients have impaired humoral immunity with impaired B lymphocyte function. Patients with SLE who are on immunosuppressive therapy, in addition, have impaired cell-mediated immunity (CMI) and T-lymphocyte function. In patients with SLE, CMV further intensifies the degree of immunosuppression, ie, impaired CMI.",

The most common differential diagnostic problem with severe viral CAP is to clinically differentiate influenza, adenovirus, and CMV. Severe human influenza A infection has characteristic clinical presentation in adults. Unlike CMV and adenovirus, human influenza has a seasonal distribution.

Whereas CMV reactivation in blood lymphocytes is detected by CMV antigen, a positive CMV polymerase chain reaction (PCR) is common in septic/ventilated patients without clinical CMV infection.27, 28, 29, 30, 31, 32, 33, 34, 35 Late-onset VAP caused by CMV occurs very rarely.31, 36, 37, 38\n",

The diagnosis of recent CMV infection depends on demonstrating either a single elevated CMV IgM titer or a 4-fold increase in CMV IgG titers. Care must be taken in interpreting a single elevated CMV IgM titer because there may be falsely elevated IgM titers in patients with elevated rheumatoid factors (RFs), EBV, or HHV-6 infection. False-positive CMV IgM test results may occur in patients with EBV or HHV-6 infectious mononucleosis because such individuals may produce heterotypic IgM antibodies. RF is an IgM antibody that reacts with IgG. IgM RF forms a complex with CMV IgG. The CMV IgG binds to CMV antigen together with nonviral RF IgM, resulting in false-positive results. False-negative results may occur if there is competitive inhibition of the binding of RF IgM to CMV antigen. For this reason, separate IgM and IgG titers should be ordered to minimize the incidence of false-positive and false-negative CMV IgM results. If there is any discrepancy between CMV IgM titers and the clinical presentation (ie, false-positive/negative tests), RF, EBV VCA IgM, and HHV-6 IgM titers should be obtained.1, 4, 5\n",

In patients with HIV, CAP may be caused by the usual typical CAP pathogens or Mycobacterium tuberculosis. CAP in patients with HIV may also be caused by an atypical CAP pathogen, for example, legionnaires disease. However, the most common CAP in patients with HIV with mild/moderately decreased CD4 cell counts is PCP. Even though patients with HIV are, by definition, immunosuppressed with various degrees of impaired CMI, CMV is an \u201cinnocent bystander\u201d and not a pathogen in such patients. In patients with HIV with PCP CAP, CMV is present in lung tissue in 75% of such patients as an \u201cinnocent bystander\u201d and is not responsible for the hypoxemia due to PCP. As PCP is treated in patients with HIV, hypoxemia gradually resolves and CMV does not reactivate but remains an \u201cinnocent bystander\u201d. For this reason, in HIV patients with PCP CAP, CMV is not treated.14, 25\n",
