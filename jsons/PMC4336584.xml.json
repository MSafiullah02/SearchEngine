However, this has been hindered in the past by the relative rarity of targets essential to the virus but nonessential to the host, and the inherent complexity of discovering and developing drugs that effectively target these proteins.",

Specifically, bioengineering has been proposed as a way to reinvigorate NP drug discovery (Hutchinson, 1994, Wilkinson and Micklefield, 2007). In the past, semisynthetic approaches have been the most frequently used route to improve the drug-like properties of an NP hit. However, the available semisynthetic options are predetermined by the array of functional groups on the NP. In contrast, bioengineering options are predetermined by the biosynthetic pathway. The potential changes are thus orthogonal to those available to semisynthesis.",

When combined with improved techniques for DNA transfer and the rapid targeted alteration of biosynthetic genes, this provides a powerful platform for focused drug discovery efforts with the aim of improving drug-like properties and pharmacokinetics and reducing off-target effects. These bioengineering techniques are readily combined with semisynthesis to identify molecules with further improved properties. In particular, inactivation of precursor pathways can allow mutasynthesis, the process of feeding a synthetic analog of the precursor which is then incorporated, biosynthetically, into the final molecule (Gregory et al., 2005, Kennedy, 2008). This enables a combinatorial element in bioengineering.",

            "text": "Cyclophilins are a class of peptidyl-prolyl isomerases, proteins that catalyze the cis-trans isomerization of the peptide bond preceding prolyl residues. Knockout studies in several species, including mice and human cells, confirm that they have limited or no effect on cellular growth and survival (Luvisetto et al., 2008, Elrod et al., 2010, Dolinski et al., 1997, Colgan et al., 2000). However, cyclophilins recruited from host cells have been shown to have essential roles in many viral life cycles. Initially, cyclophilin A was shown to be incorporated into HIV-1 virions (Thali et al., 1994, Franke et al., 1994) involved in viral replication, its expression level in patients being related to the speed of progression to AIDS (An et al., 2007). Isomerase activity of cyclophilin A, and potentially others such as cyclophilin B and cyclophilin 40, have been shown to be required for hepatitis C virus (HCV) replication (Chatterji et al., 2009, Yang et al., 2008, Kaul et al., 2009). Other viruses in which cyclophilin involvement has been implicated in their life cycle or cyclophilin inhibitors have shown inhibitory activity include vaccinia virus (Damaso and Moussatch\u00e9, 1998), West Nile virus, Dengue virus, yellow fever virus (Qing et al., 2009), hepatitis B virus (HBV) (Ptak et al., 2008), human papilloma virus (Bienkowska-Haba et al., 2009), cytomegalovirus (CMV) (Kawasaki et al., 2007), SARS coronavirus (Pfefferle et al., 2011), Japanese encephalitis virus (Kambara et al., 2011), and influenza A (Liu et al., 2012).",

It is this inhibition which is now thought to be the mechanism for the dose-limiting hyperbilirubinemia (Avila et al., 2012). These compounds also have drug-drug interaction concerns through inhibition of xenobiotic transporters such as Pgp and BSEP (Kapturczak and Kaplan, 2004, Wring et al., 2010). Comparison of the inhibition of these transporters using vesicular transport or uptake transporter inhibition assays, and in vitro inhibition of the xenobiotic transporters Pgp and BSEP revealed that while alisporivir (ALV) and cyclosporin A (CsA) potently inhibited many of them, BC544 (Figure 1, previously stated as compound 3o in Moss et al., 2012) and NVP018 showed minimal or no inhibition (see Table 2\n). To test the effect of NVP018 on bilirubin levels, we then dosed three mice with up to 250 mg/kg/day NVP018 for 7 days. In all cases, almost no increase was seen in either bilirubin or liver enzymes when measured at the end of the study (see Table S2).",

Use of recently approved drugs with high barrier to resistance, such as the nucleotide polymerase inhibitor (NPI) sofosbuvir, leads to high levels of viral clearance (AASLD 2011, abstract; Sulkowski et al., 2012). Cyclophilin inhibition is one of the few mechanisms of action of HCV inhibition that consistently shows a high barrier to resistance, and in phase 2 trials some patients were clear of the virus after being treated for 24 weeks with 1000 mg/day ALV monotherapy (Pawlotsky et al., 2012). Alisporivir, a nonimmunosuppressive semisynthetic derivative of CsA, is a potent cyclophilin inhibitor which was in phase 3 trials for the treatment of HCV infection. NVP018 could provide a suitable alternative backbone for use in an interferon-free combination. Comparison of the inhibitory potential of NVP018 with the semisynthetic sangamide, BC544, and ALV against HCV replicons revealed that NVP018 was much more potent in all assays, and was similarly active against all genotypes tested (see Table 3\n).

This is due to their potency, high barrier to resistance, activity on multiple steps of the viral life cycle, and oral bioavailability. It is also worth noting the recent publications suggesting that these compounds might also have additional impact on interferon regulatory factors, which have long been implicated in the escape of certain viruses, such as HCV and HIV, from the immune system (Obata et al., 2005, Bobardt et al., 2013). While cyclophilin inhibitors do not exhibit inhibition of all viruses, they have been shown to have activity against a wide variety of both RNA viruses (e.g. coronaviruses, HIV, and HCV) and DNA viruses (human CMV, HBV, varicella zoster virus). It is therefore tempting to speculate that cyclophilin inhibitors may be a step in the direction of agents with broad antiviral activity (Katze et al., 2002).",

Male C.B-17 SCID (model #CB17SC-M, homozygous, C.B-Igh-1b/IcrTac-Prkdcscid) mice were obtained at 6\u20138 weeks of age from Taconic, and cohorts of 50\u201360 SCID-hu Thy/Liv mice were implanted with tissues from a single donor. Implants were inoculated 18 weeks after implantation with 50 \u03bcl of stock virus or complete DMEM (control infection) by direct injection. Animal protocols were approved by the TSRI Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee. Groups of six mice each were treated with NVP018 or ALV at 50 or 100 mg/kg/day by twice-daily oral gavage until implant collection 2 weeks after inoculation.",

Specifically, implant cells were stained with phycoerythrin cyanine dye CY7-conjugated anti-CD4 (BD Biosciences), phycoerythrin cyanine CY5.5-conjugated anti-CD8 (Caltag), allophycocyanin cyanine CY7-conjugated anti-CD3 (eBiosciences), and phycoerythrin-conjugated anti-W6/32 (DakoCytomation). Cells were fixed and permeabilized with 1.2% paraformaldehyde and 0.5% Tween 20, stained with fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated anti-p24 (Beckman Coulter), and analyzed on an LSR II (BD Biosciences). After collecting 100,000 total cell events, percentages of marker-positive (CD4+, CD8+, and CD4+CD8+) thymocytes in the implant samples were determined by first gating on a live lymphoid cell population identified by forward- and side-scatter characteristics and then by CD3 expression. Total RNA was extracted from frozen thymocyte pellets using Trizol LS (Invitrogen) and resuspended in nuclease-free water. The capsid region of the HIV-1 gag was amplified by RT-PCR using 10 \u03bcl of purified RNA and AmpliTaq Gold (Applied Biosystems) according to the manufacturer\u2019s instructions.",
