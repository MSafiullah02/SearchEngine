            "text": "Protein interaction plays essential role in cell structure and function. In a simplified diagram of a signaling pathway, upon interaction of a ligand, the receptor alters its conformation, such as dimerization, phosphorylation, and ubiquitination, leading to recruitment of intracellular molecules and subsequent activation of downstream signal cascades. Each level of the signaling cascades requires protein interaction to work as a well-assembled, multifunctional protein complex essential for signal transduction. The functionality of proteins relies on their ability to interact with one another, whereas pathogenic conditions can reflect the perturbations of these protein interactions.",

            "text": "Numerous protein\u2013protein interaction (PPI) methods have been developed, but only a few of them are used for large-scale PPI detection, including yeast two-hybrid (YTH), protein fragment complementation assay (PCA), luciferase-mediated interactome (LUMIER), mammalian protein\u2013protein interaction trap (MAPPIT), protein array, and affinity purification coupled with tandem mass spectrometry (AP-MS). The YTH system is the first assay for analysis of large-scale protein\u2013protein interactions and widely accepted method (Fields and Song 1989). In YTH system, interested gene (bait, X) is fused to the DNA-binding (DB) domain of a transcription factor such as Gal4 (DB-X), while the interacting protein (prey, Y) is fused to an activation domain (AD) such as Gal4-AD (AD-Y). Physical interaction between X and Y brings AD and DB together, which reconstitutes the transcription factor and subsequently activates the downstream reporter genes (Fields and Song 1989). Like the YTH, PCA requires that bait and prey are each fused with incomplete fragments of a third protein, which acts as a reporter. Interaction between bait and prey proteins brings the fragments of reporter protein in close enough proximity to allow them to form a functional reporter protein (Rossi et al. 1997). When fluorescent proteins are reconstituted, the PCA is called bimolecular fluorescence complementation assay (Kerppola 2009). LUMIER is basically a co-immunoprecipitation assay, in which bait is linked to an epitope for purification and prey protein is fused to renilla or firefly luciferase for detection (Barrios-Rodiles et al. 2005). In the MAPPIT, bait and prey proteins are linked to signaling deficient cytokine receptor chimeras. Interaction of bait and prey restores JAK\u2013STAT cascade after the receptor has been stimulated with ligand, which leads to STAT3-dependent reporter gene activation (Eyckerman et al. 2001). Protein microarray is a microscopic array glass slide on which interested proteins have been affixed at separate locations in an ordered manner using a variety of available chemical linkers (MacBeath 2002). Protein microarrays are typically high-density arrays that are used to identify novel proteins or protein\u2013protein interactions. Antibody microarrays are the most common analytical microarray.",

However, unlike the methods discussed above, AP-MS is not designed for one-to-one protein interaction (i.e., binary interaction). Instead, AP-MS detects multi-protein complexes. As with AP-MS, gene of interests is tagged with desirable epitope for affinity purification. Various tags have been developed, such as FLAG tag, HA tag, glutathione S-transferase (GST) tags, the calmodulin-binding peptide, the streptavidin-binding peptide, or the in vivo biotinylation of the target tagged peptide using coexpression of the BirA ligase (Waugh 2005). With affinity tag, protein complexes are enriched first by affinity purification. One early developed AP-MS is to use the tandem affinity purification (TAP) tag (Puig et al. 2001). The original TAP tag is composed of a protein A tag and a calmodulin-binding peptide for two sequential enrichment purifications. In the first purification step, the protein complex is isolated from the cell lysate using immunoglobulin gamma (IgG) resin with high protein A affinity. After protein complex is cleaved from the protein A tag with TEV protease, the eluate undergoes second purification on an immobilized calmodulin column.",

            "text": "To date, AP-MS has been performed in combination with other techniques, such as biochemical fractionation and chemical cross-linking, for characterization of protein complex. Combining biochemical fractionations, like size fractionation, with AP-MS can provide a more precise characterization of multi-protein complexes according to the factions. For example, a combination of TAP purification with standard gel filtration has allowed for a better characterization of RNA polymerase II complex (Mueller and Jaehning 2002). Cross-linker is used for detecting weak interactions, such as membrane complex, which may be interrupted by detergents in lysis buffer. A combination of TAP with in vivo cross-linking with formaldehyde was used to identify novel proteasome interactors (Tagwerker et al. 2006). AP-MS can also be combined with quantitative proteomics approaches, such as SILAC and ICAT, to better understand the dynamics of protein complex assembly. Stable isotope labeling by amino acids in cell culture (SILAC) is an approach for in vivo incorporation of a label into proteins for mass spectrometry (MS)-based quantitative proteomics (Ong et al. 2002). Isotope-coded affinity tags (ICAT) are complementary to SILAC and measure dynamic changes in complexes isolated from tissues or organisms that cannot be metabolically labeled (Gygi et al. 1999). Both entail labeling the samples with isotope labels that allow the mass spectrometer to distinguish between identical proteins in separate samples. Differentially labeled samples are combined and analyzed together, and the differences in the peak intensities of the isotope pairs accurately reflect difference in the abundance of the corresponding proteins.",

(2) Some heterologous protein expressions are incompatible or toxic to yeast, i.e., membrane proteins which are unlikely to be appropriately assayed as a fusion with a reconstituted transcription factor in YTH. (3) YTH cannot reflect the endogenous protein interactions in the relevant organism. (4) Lots of signaling pathways in vertebrates do not exist in yeast. Thus, interactions triggered by posttranslational modifications do not occur in yeast, resulting in many intrinsic false negatives. (5) The coverage of prey library usually is not completed.

AP-MS couples affinity purification with mass spectrometry and requires more labor works and sophisticated equipments. Basically, baits can be expressed in any cell line, which investigator is interested in. After antibiotic selection, bait expression levels are monitored in stable cell lines by western blot, and cell line expressing low bait protein level (close to endogenous level) is usually chosen for following affinity purification. Since the bait expression is close to the counterpart endogenous protein level, we expect the purified complex reflects the endogenous protein interactions under physiological conditions. AP-MS also can be used to detect dynamic protein interactions dependent on protein posttranslational modification by signal stimulation. Unlike YTH detecting one-to-one interaction (aka binary interaction), AP-MS analyzes the entire bait complex and provides all prey information in one run. However, the purified complex represents a mix of direct and indirect binding partners since the nature of the interactions identified in AP-MS data cannot be determined to be either direct or indirect. Last, protein abundance and specificity in different cell lines also limits the detection of protein complex. For example, MIB1 and MIB2 have comparable affinity with TBK1, but we did not detect MIB2 in TBK1 complex in 293T cells by AP-MS. Using real-time PCR, we found MIB1 predominantly expressed in 293T cell line (Li et al. 2011). Taken all together, AP-MS overcomes the limitations of YTH discussed above except several disadvantages over YTH: high cost, indirect interaction, and cell type specificity.\n",

Therefore, antibiotic resistance gene should be included in the vector for stable cell line selection. Genes of interest also needs to be tagged in-frame with an epitope (at either the N or C terminus), which is used to affinity purify the tagged protein (aka bait) along with its interacting partners (aka prey). Any affinity tag can be used for AP-MS in theory, and most successful tags developed to date are FLAG, HA, S-tag, and tandem affinity purification (TAP) tag. Each purification tag has advantages and disadvantages, and the appropriate technique should be selected depending on the goals of the experiment. For example, a single FLAG or HA epitope only adds 8\u201311 amino acids (Li et al. 2011), while the TAP tag adds a >20-kDa tag (Krogan et al. 2006) which may cause more nonspecific binding. Because tag may interfere with protein expression or interaction, both N-terminal and C-terminal fusion could be tested for optimal AP-MS. For example, membrane protein may need to put the tag on the C-terminal or after signal peptide on the N-terminus. Furthermore, two kinds of purification methods (single and tandem purification) are used for AP-MS, which requires bait fused with single or double epitopes, respectively.",

Conversely, the tandem procedure tends to yield cleaner results, but weak interactions can be lost. FLAG and HA double tags are most commonly applied for tandem purification of protein complexes. We compared the effect of tandem tag versus single tag purification on the yield of total prey and HCIP by examining four protein complexes purified by single purification with FLAG versus a two-step purification with FLAG followed by HA (Li and Dorf 2013). MS analysis revealed that the number of total interactors was dramatically reduced in all protein complexes (TBK1, NAP1, IRF3, and SINTBAD) isolated by TAP purification. However, the ratio of HCIP to total prey did not increase. Consistently, more HCIP were detected by single-step affinity purification (Fig. 2.2). In brief, tandem purification reduces the NSBP at the price of HCIP loss. Due to on average more than 90% of proteins as nonspecific binding protein in one-step purification, researchers prefer to tandem affinity purification to get a cleaner background if they only study on a few protein complexes. However, if the study is to map the protein interaction network of a specific signaling pathway, NSBP from one-step purification can be excluded by statistical analysis of the whole database.\n",

As an alternative approach to in-gel digestion, protein mixtures can be digested in solution without prior separation (Behrends et al. 2010). Because buffer components, such as detergents, interfere with the mass spectrometry ionization process, protein samples need to be precipitated with trichloroacetic acid (TCA), washed, and redissolved in a digestion buffer. The main advantages of solution digestion are the reduction of the time and a higher recovery of peptides compared to in-gel digestion.

The two primary mass spectrometry methods developed for identification of proteins are electrospray ionization (ESI) (Fenn et al. 1989) and matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization (MALDI) (Hillenkamp et al. 1991). Electrospray ionization mass spectrometry is a desorption ionization method. A sample solution is sprayed from a small tube into a strong electric field in the presence of a flow of warm nitrogen to assist desolvation. The droplets formed evaporate in a region maintained at a vacuum of several torr causing the charge to increase on the droplets. The multiply charged ions then enter the analyzer. The most obvious feature of an ESI spectrum is that the ions carry multiple charges, which reduces their mass-to-charge ratio compared to a singly charged species. This advantage allows mass spectra to be obtained for large molecules. A major disadvantage is that this technique cannot analyze mixtures very well. The other most used technique, MALDI, is a two-step process. First, desorption is triggered by a UV laser beam. Matrix material heavily absorbs UV laser light, leading to the ablation of upper layer (\u223cmicron) of the matrix material. A hot plume produced during the ablation contains many species: neutral and ionized matrix molecules, protonated and deprotonated matrix molecules, matrix clusters, and nanodroplets. The second step is ionization (more accurately protonation or deprotonation). In the most common instrumental designs, ESI and MALDI are performed with mass spectrometers capable of tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS) experiments. Ion traps, quadrupole time-of-flight instruments (Q-TOF), Fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance (FT-ICR) mass spectrometers (FTMS), and the Orbitrap are the most common types of instrumentation now used in high-end protein analysis.",

There has been increasing efforts to detect dynamic views of interactomes using various modified AP-MS. Systematic methods to map dynamic changes include semi-quantification based on total spectral counts or ion intensities of precursor peptide (MS1) or fragment ions (MS2) and use of isotopic labeling approaches to obtain more accurate relative quantification. Relative quantification methods such as the stable isotope labeling by amino acids in cell culture (SILAC) detect differences in protein abundance among samples using nonradioactive isotopic labeling. Although relative quantitation is more costly and time-consuming, and less sensitive to experimental bias than label-free quantitation, it entails labeling the samples with stable isotope labels that allow the mass spectrometer to distinguish between identical proteins in separate samples. Differentially labeled samples are combined and analyzed together, and the differences in the peak intensities of the isotope pairs accurately reflect difference in the abundance of the corresponding proteins. Thus, relative quantitation may discover the dynamic interactions by comparing the change of identical protein abundances from same bait cells with and without extracellular stimulation. Absolute quantitation of proteins is also developed by using isotopic peptides entails spiking known concentrations of synthetic, heavy isotopologues of target peptides into an experimental sample (Mirgorodskaya et al. 2012). However, the cost of absolute quantitation is too high and not realistic for large-scale interactome mapping.",

Mass spectrometry has some intrinsic problems, such as the common problem of carryovers between mass spectrometry runs. To circumvent the carryover problem in mass spectrometry, we usually analyze the repeated sample in different batch. The carryovers in two independent AP-MS of the same bait will not be possible to show up twice. The record of each batch of MS runs will also help to discriminate the carryovers.",

            "text": "In addition to mass spectrometry, affinity purification also has its own inherent false positives and false negatives, which is critical general limitation encountered in the interpretation of the AP-MS due to lack of binary interaction information. False positives are nonspecific binding proteins and contaminants found in purified bait complex. Several types of false positives are present in typical affinity purified protein samples. The most common ones are from researchers\u2019 hands when they perform purification and handle samples. These contaminants usually are keratin proteins and easy to remove from the dataset. There are also other various kinds of nonspecific binding proteins: (1) proteins binding to affinity matrices, like STK38 and PRMT5; (2) proteins bind to affinity tag, like KIF11 binding to FLAG tag; (3) abundant proteins (e.g., actin, tubulin); (4) proteins prefer binding to specific domain, like ribosomal proteins binding to baits with nucleic acid-binding domain; (5) and heat-shock proteins for protein folding. Therefore, it is important to use cell line stably expressing baits at near physiological levels to avoid NSBPs, as transient overexpression may probably result in protein aggregation and improper intracellular localization. To discriminate NSBP from the protein complex, repetition of AP-MS is mandatory. In our experiences, NSBPs are dramatically different in two independent AP-MS of the same bait. Proper controls including cells expressing GFP with the same epitope will be also useful to exclude NSBPs. Last, large database with the same affinity tag and the same cell line background from high-throughput study will be a good resource for identification of NSBPs and HCIPs. If a protein is often isolated with many unrelated bait proteins, it is easily recognized through analysis of the high-throughput data. However, systematic large-scale experiment does not allow for the subjective and individual evaluation of their results, which means the removal of potential contaminating proteins cannot be based on judging individual purifications. Therefore, statistic tools for analysis of database are required to filter out nonspecific proteins and yield high-confidence interacting proteins.",

Total spectral counts (TSC) have gained acceptance as a practical, label-free, semiquantitative measure of protein abundance for proteomics studies. We adopted the z-score statistic to compare protein abundance because z-score calculates the probability of TSC occurring within a normal distribution. However, z-score does not reflect reproducibility. In our protocol, each protein complex is tested in 4 MS runs, so reproducibility can be readily factored into the analysis. z-Score also does not analyze information about prey occurrence (i.e., prey uniqueness). To explore the likelihood that an interaction is specific, we set a value of prey occurrence at <5%. We now propose a simple 3-stage scoring system to identify HCIP. This algorithm combines z-score plus prey occurrence and reproducibility (ZSPORE) (Li and Dorf 2013). In the ZSPORE scoring system, each interaction must pass all three criteria to merit classification as HCIP. The flowchart of ZSPORE is shown as in Fig. 2.3, and a detailed description is provided in Sect. 2.4.6. Taken together, the ZSPORE method combines three parameters (z-score based on TSC, prey occurrence, and reproducibility) and is a simple, efficient, and robust way to analyze AP-MS data.\n",

There are several reasons why a known interaction fail to be found in AP-MS. First, statistical analysis tool may filter out the known interaction as a nonspecific binding. Second, the nature and location of the tag might interfere bait protein function and disrupt its interactions. Third, to parallel comparison, all AP-MS experiments are performed in a same single condition. The generic conditions of affinity purification may be too harsh to preserve some protein interactions, such as the buffer for membrane proteins should be different from other ones. Fourth, the known protein interaction depends on different stimulation. Some proteins may be involved in several pathways and have different interactors in response to the relevant stimulation. Last, the absence of detection is often due to the protein expression level in the specific cell type, especially when the cells have relative low abundances of the protein.",

STRING quantitatively integrates interaction data from these sources for a large number of organisms and transfers information between these organisms where applicable (Szklarczyk et al. 2011). The IntAct database provides a freely available, open-source database system and analysis tools for molecular interaction data (Kerrien et al. 2012).

Peptide sequences (and hence protein identity) were determined by matching protein databases with the acquired fragmentation pattern by the software program SEQUEST (Thermo Fisher, San Jose, CA). The human IPI database (ver. 3.6) was used for searching. Precursor mass tolerance was set to \u00b12.0 Da, and MS/MS tolerance was set to 1.0 Da. A reversed-sequence database was used to set the false discovery rate at 1%. Filtering was performed using the SEQUEST primary score, Xcorr, and delta-Corr. Spectral matches were further manually examined, and multiple identified peptides (>1) per protein were required.",

            "text": "As with many screening methods, unfiltered AP-MS data contain many nonspecific binding proteins due to some intrinsic characteristics, such as nonspecific binding to bead or tag, protein aggregation, and carryover during MS runs. We now describe a simple efficient statistic method, z-score plus prey occurrence and reproducibility (ZSPORE) scoring system, for identification of HCIP. Using this pipeline, we achieve a higher efficiency of AP-MS and better identification of high-confidence interacting proteins. The methods and criteria used to remove nonspecific binding proteins and identify high-confidence interacting proteins include:\nGFP and controls. AP-MS of GFP-FLAG and various controls, such as non-FLAG IgG conjugated resin for AP-MS, were used to identify nonspecific binding proteins in the database.\nz-Score. A z-score (aka a standard score) indicates how many standard deviations an element is from the mean. To calculate z-score, mass spectrometry data were transformed into a \u201cstats table,\u201d where the columns are total spectral counts (TSC) from 4 MS runs, the rows are bait-associated proteins (Table 2.2). Then we calculated z-score of each X\ni,j (i prey interacts with j bait) based on the maximum total spectral counts (TSC) of 4 MS runs. For HI5 database analysis, we set the cutoff of z-score as 2.\n\n\\documentclass[12pt]{minimal}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsmath}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{wasysym} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsfonts} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amssymb} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsbsy}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{mathrsfs}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{upgreek}\n\t\t\t\t\\setlength{\\oddsidemargin}{-69pt}\n\t\t\t\t\\begin{document}\n$$ z=\\frac{(X-\\mu )}{\\sigma } $$\n\\end{document}\nz is the z-score, X is the value of the element, \u03bc is the population mean, and \u03c3 is the standard deviation.Prey occurrence. We considered any prey associated with a single bait as an HCIP while preys associated with all baits as NSBP. Generally, we set the bar of prey occurrence as <5%, which means one specific prey interacts less than 5% of total baits in the entire database. In HI5, we showed that preys that interact with less than 5 baits represented statistically significant interactions in HI5 dataset. So the threshold for prey occurrence in HI5 is set as 4. Due to known high interconnectivity among selected baits, bait-to-bait interactions were considered as HCIP.Reproducibility. Each prey must appear in at least 2 out of 4 MS runs.Batch reproducibility. To account for possible variations in the list of background contaminants observed in our dataset that were not identified by other statistical approaches, we intentionally sequenced each duplicate purified complex in different experiments. Any protein that did not appear in different purifications was considered an NSBP and manually removed from HCIP list.\n",

Several important attributes, such as z-score and TSC, can be integrated into the interaction map. Except generating interaction map, the functional classifications of HCIPs also need to be analyzed. Interactors can be grouped by protein domains, molecular functions, biological processes, and signal pathways, which may help discover common mechanism underlying the proteins of interest. To figure out the new interactions in database, several protein\u2013protein interaction databases such as BioGRID, STRING, IntAct, and MINT can be used to identify the known interaction. However, protein interactions in new publication will not be included in these databases. The interaction information is also not completed, and many known interactions may not be found in these database. Therefore, it is important to dig out protein interaction information in curated literature. Take together, all AP-MS data must be interpreted with care and validated with additional experiments. As with any screening approach, the database does not represent a final or complete interaction network.",

The systematic mapping of physical interactions is therefore critical for post-genomic research. Comprehensive analysis of protein\u2013protein interactions is still a challenging endeavor of functional proteomics. Since intrinsic negatives are inherent to every technique, the physical interaction data generated by AP-MS may carry many false positives and negatives. Thus, AP-MS is unlikely to grasp the entire interactome. It is also still a challenge to develop optimal computational tools to visually and computationally represent the multiple layers of data and integrate existing biological knowledge and functional data in literature with the interactome data. Since most AP-MS data represent static graph of PPI map, advanced methods have to be developed and focused on dynamic and spatial changes in PPI.",
