This has been seen in Central Queensland where resistance is most common, and where a small proportion of producers are applying up to nine pour-on treatments, estimated to cost more than $73 per cow. If such management practices were adopted widely, the sustainability of the dairy industry in the tick-infested area would be questionable.",

Factors that are likely to decrease the total loss due to tick infestation include a reduction in the number of dairy farms in the tick-infested area and a reduction in the price of milk paid to farmers. These trends are expected to occur with deregulation of the dairy industry. Balancing these factors, however, is the increase in prevalence of resistance to the cheaper acaricides with the consequent increase in usage of more expensive macrocyclic lactone products. Cattle tick infestation represents a significant impost on dairy producers in Queensland, and although the actual cost will vary over time, tick infestation will continue to be expensive to control.",

Vaccines and vaccination are discussed in chapter five. The effectiveness, advantages and disadvantages of both modified live and inactivated vaccines are presented along with the basic principles of a vaccination program. The important clinical manifestations of viral disease are presented in chapter six. These include abortion, diarrhoea, bovine respiratory disease, mucosal diseases, vesicular diseases, and neurological, ocular and other system disorders. Disinfection is presented in chapter seven.
