            "text": "Successful adaptive immune responses against pathogens rely on the activation of lymphocytes in secondary lymphoid organs (SLOs) and the recruitment of effector cells to sites of pathogen replication (Junt et al., 2008). Within SLOs, appropriately stimulated fibroblastic reticular cells (FRCs) generate a cellular scaffold that maintains immune responsiveness (Chai et al., 2013), for example through fostering dendritic cell-T cell interaction (Baj\u00e9noff et al., 2006) or supporting B cell activation (Cremasco et al., 2014). Other SLO stromal cells such as blood endothelial cells (BECs) of high endothelial venules (HEVs) regulate SLO cellularity via stringent control of lymphocyte migration (Browning et al., 2005, Mionnet et al., 2011, Onder et al., 2013). The establishment of different cellular compartments within SLOs is mediated to a large extent through the generation of homeostatic chemokines such as the chemokine CC-motif receptor 7 (CCR7) ligands CCL19 and CCL21 (Randall et al., 2008, F\u00f6rster et al., 2008). Podoplanin (PDPN)- and extracellular matrix protein ER-TR7-expressing FRCs represent a major lymph node (LN) stromal cell population involved in the production of CCR7 ligands (Link et al., 2007, Scandella et al., 2008). In addition, BECs in HEVs and lymphatic endothelial cells (LECs) contribute to production of CCL21 (Gunn et al., 1998). Moreover, CCR7 ligands can be generated in peripheral, non-lymphoid organs (Christopherson et al., 2003, Lo et al., 2003, Krumbholz et al., 2007, Columba-Cabezas et al., 2003, Kivis\u00e4kk et al., 2004) where their expression further increases during inflammatory reactions (Pashenkov et al., 2003, Krumbholz et al., 2007, Rangel-Moreno et al., 2007, Burke et al., 2010). These data suggest that CCR7 ligands expressed in non-lymphoid organs might serve as inducible chemoattractants to foster immune surveillance.",

            "text": "Tight control of lymphocyte entry and effector function is particularly important for organs such as the CNS because immunopathological damage of this organ during active immune responses has to be kept at a minimum (Ransohoff and Engelhardt, 2012, Moseman and McGavern, 2013). The finding that T cells migrating into the inflamed CNS express CCR7 (Alt et al., 2002) suggests that T cell entry to the CNS might be controlled via this molecule. Moreover, chronic inflammatory diseases of the CNS such as multiple sclerosis (MS) are associated with elevated CCL19 levels in the cerebrospinal fluid (Pashenkov et al., 2003, Krumbholz et al., 2007) and significantly higher expression in active and inactive lesions (Krumbholz et al., 2007). In an experimental model of MS, both CCL19 and CCL21 can be detected in ECs of inflamed venules and cells that accumulate in the perivascular space (Alt et al., 2002, Columba-Cabezas et al., 2003). However, it has remained elusive whether local activation of fibroblastic and/or endothelial stromal cells in the CNS is required to transfer immune recognition from SLOs into the infected tissue and to what extent these processes control local immune responsiveness during virus-induced neuroinflammatory CNS disease.",

Here, we focused on the events that take place early during establishment of the infection when viral replication has caused a rapid and more than 1,000-fold upregulation of Ccl19 and Ccl21 gene expression in the olfactory bulb. We found that two distinct stromal cell populations, i.e., ECs of meningeal and sub-meningeal venules and PDPN+ER-TR7+ FRC-like cells in the perivascular space, served as major source for CCR7 ligands. CCR7 expression on antiviral T cells was mandatory to prevent lethal neuroinflammatory disease, while provision of extra-lymphatic CCL21 ensured sufficient CD8+ T cell recruitment to and re-activation in the CNS to protect the host from severe disease. We therefore conclude that activation of CNS stromal cells is critical for optimal control of neurotropic viral infection and that this function is executed\u2014at least partially\u2014through the swift provision of CCR7 ligands.",

To assess whether infection of mice with neurotropic viruses triggers a distinct program of stromal cell activation including expression of chemokines, we infected mice with the mouse hepatitis virus (MHV) strain A59 via the intranasal route. As shown in Figure 1\nA, infectious viral particles were first detectable in olfactory bulbs and cervical LNs (cLNs) on day 2 post infection (p.i.). By day 4, viral titers had reached peak values in olfactory bulbs and the virus had spread to distal CNS areas, including the spinal cord. After 6 days, the virus had been eliminated from draining cLNs, while clearance from CNS tissues was not achieved until day 10 (Figure 1A). In order to visualize viral dissemination at the peak of the infection and to identify infected cells, we analyzed paramedian sagittal sections of infected brains (day 6 p.i.) by confocal laser scanning microscopy using antibodies against the MHV nucleoprotein (MHV-N), activated microglial cells (ionized calcium-binding adaptor molecule 1/Iba-1) and neurons (neuronal nuclei, NeuN) (Figure 1B, i). Strong viral antigen expression was detectable in rostral regions of the brain such as the olfactory bulb, anterior olfactory nucleus, and the piriform cortex (Figure 1B, i and Figure S1A). Infected microglial cells revealed by anti-Iba-1 and anti-MHV-N co-staining, were found, for example, in the olfactory bulb (Figure 1B, ii). Moreover, infected NeuN+ neurons were detected in the anterior olfactory nucleus (Figure 1B, iii) and aspartoacylase (ASPA)- (Figure 1B, iv) or Olig2-expressing (data not shown) oligodendrocytes staining positive for MHV-N were found in the locus coeruleus. The finding that both neurons and glial cells stained positive for MHV-N supports the notion that the virus utilizes axonal transport (Perlman et al., 1990) and cell-to-cell spread (Gallagher and Buchmeier, 2001) as means of dissemination. To assess whether the viral infection had triggered the generation of microenvironments that support lymphocyte activation, we performed quantitative RT-PCR analysis of olfactory bulb tissue at the peak of the infection. Interestingly, mRNA expression of inflammatory chemokines and several genes involved in lymphoid organogenesis such as Ltb, Ltbr, and Il7 were substantially upregulated in the infected olfactory bulb (Figure 1C). Likewise, expression of the homeostatic chemokines Ccl19, Ccl21, and Cxcl13 increased substantially in inflamed CNS tissue compared to naive controls (Figure 1C). Since the increase in relative expression of CCR7 ligands was most prominent in olfactory bulb and cLN, we reasoned that processes driving production of these chemokines in the cLN were mirrored during local inflammatory reactions in the CNS. As shown in Figures 1D and 1E, expression of both Ccl19 and Ccl21 mRNA increased roughly 1,000-fold at their peak on day 20 in the olfactory bulb and the pattern of chemokine activation in different CNS areas was accompanied by the infiltration of inflammatory cells (Figures S1B and S1C). Elevated chemokine expression was only transient and followed the resolution of the viral infection with substantially lower expression on day 20 post infection (Figures 1D and 1E). Thus, the presence of actively replicating virus within the CNS, particularly in the olfactory bulb as virus entry point, drives a rapid increase in transcriptional activity of Ccl19/Ccl21 genes, a process that is paralleled by infiltration of immune cells and upregulation of genes associated with stromal cell activation.",

Hence, to localize CCL19-producing cells in situ, we took advantage of the recently described Ccl19-cre bacterial artificial chromosome transgenic mouse that facilitates expression of the Cre recombinase in FRCs of secondary lymphoid organs (Chai et al., 2013). We crossed Ccl19-cre mice with Rosa26-eyfp mice (referred to as Ccl19\neyfp) to label cells exhibiting Ccl19 promoter activity with the yellow fluorescent protein. Combination of this detection method with anti-CCL21 immunostaining in confocal microscopic analysis of olfactory bulb tissue of naive Ccl19\neyfp mice revealed only faint CCL21 staining and few cells that exhibited Ccl19 promoter activity (Figure S2A). In contrast, cells showing Ccl19-cre activity and anti-CCL21 staining were clearly detectable at day 6 post infection and were mainly confined to meningeal and sub-meningeal areas (Figures 2A and 2B, magnified in boxed areas). Nevertheless, PDPN expression, which serves as a marker for FRC activation (Chai et al., 2013), was strongly increased in regions of elevated CCR7 ligand production (Figure 2B). While mRNA expression analysis revealed rather strong induction of Cxcl13 transcript levels (Figure 1C), expression of CXCL13 protein was found only in very few cells (Figures S2B and S2C).",

            "text": "The vigorous but locally restricted activation of stromal cells with dominant production of CCL19 and CCL21 during the response to neurotropic coronavirus infection suggested that these chemokines could contribute to the control of the virus. To test this hypothesis, we assessed whether mice lacking either CCR7 or CCR7 ligand expression in SLOs display differences in their defense against neurotropic virus infection. The latter mouse strain, known as plt/plt (paucity of lymph node T cells) (Gunn et al., 1999) shows expression of the CCL21b isoform in extra-lymphatic tissues (Nakano and Gunn, 2001). Notably, both mouse strains exhibit impaired T cell zone development in SLOs due to migration defects of DCs and lymphocytes (Gunn et al., 1999, F\u00f6rster et al., 1999), hence showing a comparable loss of immunocompetence in response to systemic virus infection (Junt et al., 2002, Junt et al., 2004). While Ccr7-sufficient mice successfully controlled the infection and experienced transient weight loss during the first 2 weeks, Ccr7-deficient mice presented with rapid weight loss early after infection, succumbing to neuroinflammatory disease by day 10 (Figure 4\nA). In sharp contrast, all plt/plt mice survived the phase of transient weight loss (Figure 4A) and successfully controlled the infection as shown by significantly lower viral titers in brain tissues compared to Ccr7\n\u2212/\u2212 mice (Figure 4B). Impaired viral control of Ccr7-deficient and plt/plt mice was associated with a pronounced reduction in antiviral CD8+ T cell numbers (Figure 4C) and function (Figure 4D), as well as a reduction in antiviral CD4+ T cell function (Figure 4E) in the whole brain on day 10 p.i. Moreover, recruitment of CD8+ T cells into the olfactory bulb was affected already on day 4 by the Ccr7-deficiency (Figure S4A). The lack of CCR7 almost completed abolished the appearance of interferon (IFN)-\u03b3-producing antiviral CD8+ T cells in all CNS regions (Figures S4B and S4C), while CD4+ T cell recruitment was affected to a lesser extent (Figures S4D and S4E). Importantly, Ccr7-deficient mice showed a stronger impairment of antiviral CD8+ T cell responses compared to plt/plt mice (Figures 4C and 4D). The lack of chemokine receptor CXCR3 that binds the inflammatory chemokines CXCL9 and CXCL10 and that has been implicated in the regulation of T cell migration in several models of neuro-inflammation (Bagai et al., 2005), did not affect survival following intranasal MHV A59 infection (Figure S4F). Likewise, the absence of CXCR5, i.e., the receptor for the B cell zone cytokine CXCL13, did not increase the susceptibility of the animals to MHV CNS infection (Figure S4G). Therefore, it appears that the ability of T cells to sense extra-lymphatic expression of the chemokines CCL19 and CCL21 through CCR7 plays a major role in the rapid control of neurotropic coronavirus infection.",

            "text": "Viral replication kinetics and the fast disease course suggested that appropriate activation of antiviral CD8+ T cells and elimination of the highly cytopathic pathogen from the CNS is of utmost importance to prevent lethal disease. To assess the activation and migration pattern of MHV-specific CD8+ T cells in vivo, we utilized a transgenic mouse expressing a H2-Kb-restricted TCR that recognizes the immunodominant epitope s598\u2013605 of the MHV spike protein (TCR-S or Spiky). Adoptive transfer of congenic carboxy-fluorescein succimidyl ester (CFSE)-labeled Spiky cells into infected recipients revealed first activation in cLNs at 72 hr p.i. followed by strong proliferation (Figure 5\nA). Interestingly, accumulation of activated, CFSElow Spiky cells in the infected CNS could be detected on day 4 at the earliest (Figure 5B), indicating that the cells had to undergo at least 8 rounds of proliferation in the cLN before they gained the ability to migrate to the CNS. As expected, activation of Spiky cells in cLNs resulted in downregulation of CCR7 (Figure 5C). Activated Spiky cells circulating in blood and those that had infiltrated the CNS expressed CCR7 (Figure 5C) indicating their ability to sense CCR7 ligands produced by ECs and FRC-like cells in inflamed regions of the CNS. CCR7 expression detected on CNS-infiltrating Spiky cells was comparable to polyclonal CD8+ T cells that had infiltrated different regions of the CNS (Figure S5). Moreover, Spiky cells derived from cLNs, blood and the brain on days 4 and 8 post infection had downregulated CD62L (Figure 5D). Functional characterization of CNS-infiltrating Spiky cells revealed that these cells were fully activated effector T cells as shown by secretion of the cytokines IFN-\u03b3 and tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-\u03b1), and expression of the degranulation marker CD107a (lysosomal-associated membrane protein 1, LAMP1) (Figures 5E and 5F). These data support the notion that access of polyfunctional effector CD8+ T cells to the CNS is important for successful elimination of the virus from this highly vulnerable tissue.",

These mice are well-suited to address this question because they lack CCL19 and CCL21 expression in lymphoid organs (Gunn et al., 1999, Nakano and Gunn, 2001) but show production of CCL21 by stromal cells in MHV-infected olfactory bulbs (Figure 6\nA). To assess early CD8+ T cell activation, we transferred Ccr7-proficient or -deficient TCR Spiky cells into plt/plt mice and compared their activation status in cLNs and the brain 4 days after infection. We found that expansion and activation of antiviral CD8+ cells in cLNs was not dependent on CCR7 (Figure 6B). Importantly, accumulation of Ccr7-deficient TCR Spiky cells in the CNS was significantly reduced, while Ccr7-proficient or -deficient Spiky cells showed comparable activation marker profiles (Figure 6C). By day 6 p.i., the numbers of Ccr7-proficient Spiky CD8+ T cells infiltrating the CNS were still significantly higher compared to Ccr7-deficient cells (Figure 6D). Importantly, the presence or absence of CCR7 on antiviral CD8+ T cells did not affect their numbers in cLNs (Figure 6E) nor their proliferation (Figure 6F) or apoptosis (Figure 6G) in the CNS. To more closely mirror the kinetics of polyclonal CD8+ T cell activation, only very low numbers of Spiky cells (i.e., 104) that expressed CCR7 and the congenic marker Ly5.1 or were Ccr7-deficient and labeled with the Thy1.1 marker were co-transferred into plt/plt mice. During the peak of the CNS infection, i.e., at day 6, frequencies of both cell types were comparable in the draining LN (Figures 6H and 6I) and their activation was not affected by the Ccr7-deficiency (Figure 6J). Again, lack of CCR7 in Spiky cells had a pronounced effect on their accumulation in the virus-infected CNS resulting in a roughly 80% reduced frequencies compared to Ccr7-proficient cells (Figures 6H and 6I). Moreover, virus-specific, Ccr7-deficient CD8+ T cells that had reached the CNS exhibited impaired IFN-\u03b3 production (Figure 6J). These experiments show that local expression of CCR7 ligands not only supports the recruitment of virus-specific CD8+ T cells to the CNS, but is also required for the execution of their antiviral activity.",

Moreover, CD8+ T cells were found to interact with CCL19+PDPN+ perivascular fibroblastic stromal cells (Figures 7A and 7B, arrows). Next, we specifically ablated CCL19-expressing stromal cells using low doses of diphtheria toxin (DT) applied to Ccl19\neyfp mice that express the DT receptor in Cre recombinase-positive cells (Ccl19\neypf/idtr) (Buch et al., 2005, Cremasco et al., 2014). Low dose DT treatment led to a substantial loss of EYFP+ cells in the infected CNS (Figure 7C), but left the FRC network in the cLNs intact (Figure 7C, inlets). Importantly, CNS-restricted ablation of EYFP+ stromal cells resulted in reduced CD8+ T cell accumulation (Figure 7D), while CD4+ T cell recruitment was not altered (Figure 7E). As a consequence, CNS viral titers were significantly elevated in DT-treated Ccl19\neypf/idtr mice on day 8 p.i. (Figure 7F). CD8+ and CD4+ T cell compartments in cLNs were not changed by the DT treatment (Figures 7G and 7H). Moreover, we found that the local stimulation of antiviral CD8+ T cells via CCR7 not only improved the ability of CD8+ T cells to exit meningeal blood vessels, but substantially fostered their access to infected areas in the CNS parenchyma (Figures 7I and 7J). Taken together, these data show that activated CNS stromal cells are potent regulators of local antiviral CD8+ T cell activity and that this interaction depends to a large extent on the CCR7-CCR7 ligand axis.",

Because the CNS is vital and highly vulnerable, immune responses against neurotropic infectious agents need to be well-controlled, i.e., the efficacy of pathogen elimination has to be high, while immunopathological damage has to be kept minimal. The present study shows that activated antiviral CD8+ T cells utilize CCR7 to optimize migration into the inflamed CNS and to control their functional activity during neurotropic viral infection. Moreover, our findings indicate that CCR7 ligands produced by vascular and perivascular stromal cells in affected CNS regions function as part of a multi-layered control network that secures spatiotemporal focusing of the immune response to areas of viral replication.",

CNS infection with a neurotropic coronavirus, as shown here, triggered a moderate and transient increase in Ccl19 and Ccl21 gene expression in cLNs. It is possible that virus and viral products have been drained via lymphatic vessels that connect the dura to the cLNs (Aspelund et al., 2015). Within the CNS, both ECs and perivascular FRC-like cells showed swift and substantial production of CCR7 ligands. The expression of CCR7 ligands can be induced via the ligation of the LT\u03b2R in fibroblastic (Chai et al., 2013) and in endothelial stromal cells (Onder et al., 2013). Moreover, acute inflammatory mediators such as TNF can foster activation of the CCR7/CCL19 axis (Bos\u00e8 et al., 2013). It is likely that the initial upregulation of Ccl19 and Ccl21 mRNA expression in MHV infected CNS is triggered via inflammatory cytokines such as TNF. Notably, microglial cells are a prominent source of TNF during viral encephalitis (Ghoshal et al., 2007). Thus, infection of microglia cells, a major target cell population of MHV in the CNS, could trigger secretion of TNF that leads to the initial low-level induction of CCL19/CCL21 expression in stromal cells. With the immigration of activated, lymphotoxin-expressing T cells, as demonstrated in our study, fibroblastic and endothelial stromal cells would receive additional activating signals to change into activation mode including massive production of CCR7 ligands.",

Because expression of selectins and integrins by inflamed brain vessels reduces the rolling velocity of lymphocytes and permits prolonged interactions with the endothelial wall (Engelhardt, 2006), focal activation of blood vessel ECs most likely fosters recruitment of T cells to sites of viral replication. FRC-like cells in the perivascular space in the vicinity of virus-infected areas exhibited not only elevated expression of ICAM1, and VCAM1, but also of other markers that are typical for LN FRCs including ER-TR7 and PDPN (Cremasco et al., 2014). Importantly, ER-TR7+ reticular networks have been observed during CNS infection with the lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus (LCMV) (Kim et al., 2009) or during chronic Toxoplasma gondii infection (Wilson et al., 2009). Thus, it is likely that brain vessel ECs and the surrounding FRC-like cells are programmed by the local inflammatory milieu to generate those structures that foster and maintain lymphocyte recruitment and activation.",

Notably, presence of CCR7 on virus-specific CD8+ T cells was sufficient to rescue Ccr7-deficient animals from lethal disease clearly indicating that CCR7 signaling can be decisive for optimal recruitment of activated CD8+ T cells into the inflamed CNS. Adoptive transfer experiments using Ccr7-proficient and -deficient antiviral CD8+ T cells suggested that the lack of CCR7 signals in SLOs can be compensated by other stimuli, but that focal, high-level production of CCR7 ligands at sites of peripheral inflammation is critical for both recruitment and performance of antiviral T cells. The finding that Ccr7-deficient splenic CD8+ T cells did not show impaired IFN-\u03b3 production during systemic lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus infection (Junt et al., 2004) supports our interpretation that the SLO environment guarantees sufficient immune stimulation to generate protective antiviral immunity. Interestingly, systemic Toxoplasma gondii infection of Ccr7-deficient mice leads to rapid replication of tachyzoites and dissemination to several peripheral organs including the brain (Noor et al., 2010). It is striking that parasite infection of the CNS provokes generation of perivascular reticular fibers that are coated with CCL21 and that anti-parasitic CD8+ T cells migrate along these fibers (Wilson et al., 2009). Because viral CNS infection efficiently triggers activation of perivascular FRC-like cells, it is reasonable to assume that the perivascular infrastructure supporting antimicrobial immunity is built by FRC-like stromal cells. As predicted by Perry and colleagues (Galea et al., 2007) these processes therefore substantially diminish immune privilege of the CNS and permit efficient immune surveillance.",

            "text": "In conclusion, our study shows that the rapid generation of CCR7 ligands by stromal cells of the CNS is critical for the containment of neurotropic virus infection. The chemokines can be generated rapidly and at high levels by meningeal and sub-meningeal blood vessel ECs and perivascular FRC-like cells. Once appropriately activated, CNS stromal cells generate a confined micro-environment that permits optimal T cell recruitment and activation. It remains to be determined whether some areas in the CNS provide such T cell activation hubs in a constitutive fashion and thereby foster activation of self-reactive T cells by perivascular dendritic cells (Greter et al., 2005). Moreover, it will be important to assess whether and how immune cells that have entered the CNS via the stromal cell-determined entry points leave the organ after the pathogen has been cleared. It is likely that the recently discovered lymphatic connection to the cLNs (Aspelund et al., 2015, Louveau et al., 2015) serve as exit points for immune cells that had accumulated in the inflamed tissue. Accordingly, dysregulation of immune cell influx versus efflux might foster self-perpetuation of focal immune cell aggregations with development of ectopic lymphoid-like structures (Pitzalis et al., 2014). Thus, stromal cells function as critical gate-keepers for activated immune cells and neuroinflammation might be exacerbated if activation of stromal cells following resolution of CNS infection is not restrained. Further dissection of cellular and molecular mechanisms that control stromal cell activation in the CNS is warranted to delineate potential avenues for attenuation of inflammatory processes in this vulnerable organ.",
