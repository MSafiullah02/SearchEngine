One of these antibodies, m102, which exhibited the highest level of cross-reactive neutralization of both NiV and HeV G, was affinity maturated by light-chain shuffling combined with random mutagenesis of its heavychain variable domain and panning against sG HeV . One of the selected antibody Fab clones, m102.4, had affinity of binding to sG HeV that was equal to or higher than that of the other Fabs; it was converted to IgG1 and tested against infectious NiV and HeV. It exhibited exceptionally potent and cross-reactive inhibitory activity with 50% inhibitory concentrations below 0.04 and 0.6 g/mL, respectively. The virus-neutralizing activity correlated with the binding affinity of the antibody to sG HeV and sG NiV . m102.4 bound a soluble form of NiV G (sG NiV ) better than it bound sG HeV , and it neutralized NiV better than HeV, despite being originally selected against sG HeV .

It is, therefore, important to select antibodies that recognize epitopes that are highly conserved among different virus variants. Previously, we reported the isolation and characterization of potent neutralizing recombinant HMAbs that targeted the viral envelope glycoprotein G by use of a highly purified, oligomeric, soluble HeV G glycoprotein (sG HeV ) [12] as the antigen for the screening of a large, naive human phagedisplayed antibody library [13] . One of these antibodies, m102, exhibited cross-neutralizing activity against both HeV and NiV. In this article, we report the identification and characterization of a novel antibody, m102.4, derived from m102 by light-chain shuffling and heavy-chain variable domain random mutagenesis. This antibody exhibits exceptional potency against both, NiV and HeV, and being fully human antibody, it could be directly used for prophylaxis or treatment of humans exposed to or infected by HeV or NiV. Such an antibody could also be used for improved diagnosis and as a research tool for better understanding of virus-host interaction. Fine mapping of the HMAbdefined epitope may also provide information useful for the rational development of candidate vaccines and small molecule drugs.",

The original human Fab phage display library, from which the antibodies m101-m107 were identified [13] , was used as the source for the light-chain variable domain (VL) repertoire in the shuffled library. The phagemid preparation from the original library was first digested with NcoI and SpeI, followed by electrophoresis on an agarose gel to delete the entire heavy-chain variable domain (VH) repertoire. The gene encoding the VH of m102 was amplified by error-prone polymerase chain reaction (PCR) (Stratagene) to introduce random mutations and then fused with the CH1 gene fragment by use of splicing by overlapping extension PCR. The fused fragment was digested with NcoI and SpeI and purified from gel; it was then ligated into the purified backbone vector to create the VLs-shuffled Fab repertoire. Escherichia coli TG1 cells were transformed with the ligation mixtures via electroporation. The transformed TG1 cells were plated on 2\u03eb yeast extract-tryptone (2YT) agar plates containing 100 g/mL ampicillin and 2% glucose (2YTAG). After incubation overnight at 37\u00b0C, all of the colonies grown on the plates were scraped into 5 mL of 2YTAG medium, mixed with 1.2 mL of 50% glycerol (final concentration, 10%), aliquoted, and stored at \u03ea70\u00b0C as the library stock. Two rounds of biopanning were performed on sG HeV conjugated magnetic beads as described for the original library panning [13] . Eight clones were identified as affinity-maturated antibodies, and m102.4 was selected for further characterization.

We reasoned that improving m102's binding to HeV G could further increase its cross-reactive neutralizing activity by increasing its affinity to HeV G. To mature in vitro m102, we constructed an antibody library-which contained approximately 2 \u03eb 10 8 clones-by light-chain shuffling combined with heavychain VH random mutations introduced by error-prone PCR. Two rounds of panning against sG HeV conjugated to magnetic beads demonstrated sufficient enrichment (data not shown), and 190 random colonies were screened by phage ELISA. The 24 best binders were selected for sequencing analysis. They represented 8 different clones, which were designated m102.1-m102.8. Although there were no amino acid sequence changes, silent mutations occurred in the VH regions in 3 of the 8 clones (data not shown), indicating that the error-prone PCR had worked. Seven of the 8 different light chains were from V subfamily III, which is the same as that of m102; 1 clone (m102.8) was from the V subfamily I. A sequence analysis of these light chains showed that all clones contained mutations in all 3 complementarity-determining regions; of the 7 clones from subfamily III, m102.4 had the largest number of mutations (data not shown).",

To investigate the binding of IgG1 m102.4 to HeV G and NiV G and its ability to block receptor-G interactions, we used 2 multiplex mi- crosphere assays that we recently developed [16] . As shown in figure 2A , m102.4 binds to both sG HeV and sG NiV in a dosedependent fashion. At relatively low concentrations (in the range of 50 ng/mL or less), the binding reached 50% of its maximum, indicating strong binding to both soluble G proteins. Furthermore, the multiplex assays also demonstrated that m102.4 is highly efficacious in blocking the binding of ephrin-B2 ligand (EFNB2) to both sG HeV and sG NiV (figure 2B). It is important to note that the increase in affinity did not alter the specificity of the Fab; it could still bind to both G proteins very well. It is also interesting to note that m102.4 binds sG NiV better than sG HeV , a result that was also reflected in its slightly better efficiency at blocking EFNB2-sG NiV binding. These results suggest that m102.4 is a cross-reactive, high-affinity binder to the soluble forms of both HeV G and NiV G glycoproteins.",

IgG1 m102.4 was also evaluated in the sensitive Vero cell-fociimmunostaining assay overnight side by side with IgG1 m101 ( figure 4) . In this case, not only was the amount of virus per well high (4000 TCID 50 for HeV and 2000 TCID 50 for NiV), but the antibody-virus mixtures were incubated on Vero cell monolayers overnight. If no antibody was present (panels A and F), there was massive coalesced syncytia for both viruses. In the presence of m101, HeV was neutralized to localized foci at 10 g/mL, which was further reduced to individual infected cells at 50 g/ mL. Importantly, if this assay was carried out as a standard cytopathic effect-based neutralization assay, these wells would essentially look uninfected. By comparison, m102.4 neutralized 100% of HeV and NiV at either 10 g/mL or 50 g/mL.

The binding of HeV G mutants D260A, G439A, K443A, and K465A to both m101 and m102.4 was almost absent, whereas the mutations G449A and D468A significantly decreased the binding of both antibodies, although they did so to varying degrees ( figure 5 ). Interestingly, one mutation, K560A, almost completely eliminated the binding of the HeVspecific antibody m101 but did not have any effect on the binding of the cross-reactive antibody m102.4. Bishop et al. [15] showed that all 4 mutations-D260A, G439A, K443A and K465A-that eliminated the binding of both MAbs in this study are detrimental for the binding of HeV G to the receptor ephrin-B2. These results suggest that the m102.4 epitope overlaps the receptor-binding domain of HeV G and the epitope of m101.",

As HMAb m102.4 has the potential to be a potent henipavirus therapeutic agent, we next assessed its in vivo half-life and toxicity. We chose to use ferrets for these studies because they have been shown to be susceptible to NiV-mediated disease (K. Bossart, J. Bingham, and D. Middleton; unpublished data) and have become important animal models for several other human respiratory viruses, including SARS coronavirus and highly pathogenic avian influenza virus. Ferrets received 1 of 2 different doses of m102.4 (25 or 5 mg), as detailed above. Animals were closely observed for at least 2 hours after recovery, and no adverse effects were noted. Blood samples were collected over a 42-day period, and antibody concentrations were measured. A typical antibody concentration over time is shown in figure 6 , which shows 2 slopes in a logarithmic scale. Half-lives calculated from these slopes did not vary with antibody dose. Average distribution and elimination half-lives of 1.48 days and 3.53 days, respectively, were calculated, with relatively small individual differences. To determine whether the relatively short elimination half-life was the result of immune responses, we tested the ferret serum for anti-m102.4 ferret antibodies. We were not able to detect such antibodies in ferret serum samples after administration of m102.4 (data not shown).",

This antibody has significantly improved potency, compared with the parent antibody m102 and with other HMAbs identified and characterized in our previous study [13] . Importantly, the substantial gain in potency was achieved without decreasing cross-reactivity. To our knowledge, this is the first fully human antibody that is capable of potently neutralizing both infectious HeV and NiV. An interesting observation made during the present study was that m102.4 had better binding to sG NiV than to sG HeV , despite the fact that sG HeV was used as the selector antigen during the original library screening [13] and in the maturation panning procedures. The better binding to sG NiV correlated with better neutralizing activity against NiV, compared with HeV. Further studies are required to understand the mechanism underlying this unexpected observation.",

            "text": "Although the epitope mapping by alanine-scanning mutagenesis indicated that m102.4 and m101 share most of the residues on the HeV G glycoprotein that affect their binding, a dramatic difference was observed for the K560A mutation, which completely abolished the binding of m101 to HeV G, but did not affect m102.4's binding. It was previously shown by Bishop et al. [15] that K560A had no effect on the binding of HeV G to the henipavirus receptors ephrin-B2 and ephrin-B3. Thus, the m101 epitope may contain contact site(s) located outside the receptor binding site. Because the m102.4 epitope does not include this site, one could hypothesize that it overlaps the receptor binding site to larger extent than the m101 epitope does. Such a hypothesis is in agreement with m102.4's much higher observed degree of cross-reactivity, compared with that of m101. Thus, one could further hypothesize that the m102.4 epitope closely mimics the receptor binding site and, therefore, that the generation of escape mutants in the presence of this antibody would be less likely, compared with m101 and indeed any other known HMAb. We have previously made similar observation for our potent cross-reactive neutralizing HMAb m396, which is predicted to be effective against all SARS coronavirus isolates with known sequences [17] . The m396 binding site overlaps extensively with the receptor binding site on the SARS coronavirus spike (S) glycoprotein, as shown by the crystal structure of the m396-S complex [18] . Thus, targeting the conserved and functionally important receptor binding site that is critical for virus entry into cells is a promising strategy for the development of cross-neutralizing antibodies.",

The elimination half-life was significantly shorter than that for human IgGs in humans (typically 2-3 weeks). We hypothesized that this could be the results of immune responses, specifically the elicitation of anti-human IgG antibodies, which typically develop after 1-2 weeks. However, our attempts to detect such ferret antibodies against m102.4 did not result in any measurable quantities above the background (data not shown).
