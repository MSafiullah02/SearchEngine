Typical symptoms of this group of diseases include sore throat, cough, fever, malaise and myalgia that may last for days (Simoes et al., 2006, West, 2002, WHO, 1995). They are rarely fatal but cause significant morbidity and economic burden (Gonzales et al., 2001). These diseases result in increasing frequency for suspending classes for school children (Davis, 1976).",

Moreover, air pollutants, including NO2, O3, and particulate matter (PM), were also reported correlated with increased morbidity of respiratory infections (Burnett et al., 2001, Hwang and Chan, 2002, Lin et al., 2005, Lin et al., 2008, Peel et al., 2005, Schwartz et al., 1991, Wong et al., 2009, Wong et al., 2006). Even though the evidence of positive association between ambient environment and elevation of acute upper respiratory infections were revealed in literature, respiratory infections were believed to be more linked to the circulation of respiratory biological agents (Denny, 1995, Simoes et al., 2006, Treanor and Lee, 2010). Although some evidence about risk estimates of environmental risk factors showed various day lags resulting from displacement effect (harvesting effect) (Zanobetti et al., 2000), the association and interaction between acute upper respiratory infections and environmental and biological factors remains unclear. Moreover, latencies (the lag effects) of circulating respiratory viruses, air pollutants, and temperature led to more difficulties in clarifying the associations.",

Community sentinel physicians (from sentinel physician-based surveillance system) across the nation collected nasal and/ or throat specimens daily from patients with one or more symptoms of upper and lower respiratory tract infections, including cough, sore throat, tonsillitis, pharyngitis, pneumonia, and bronchiolotis. These collected specimens were delivered to regional contracted laboratories to examine the viral types, including influenza type A, influenza type B, parainfluenza viruses, adenoviruses, and respiratory syncytial virus, using viral isolation, immunofluorescent assay by type-specific monoclonal antibodies (Dako, Cambridgeshire, United Kingdom), and reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction for subtype identification (Taiwan Centers for Disease Control, 2007, Shih et al., 2005). The Kun-Yan Central Laboratory of the Taiwan Centers for Disease Control was responsible for the final confirmation of cases based on laboratory results and reported symptoms. This study used laboratory-based virological surveillance data from 2003 to 2007 in Taipei (identification results from clinical virology laboratories of Tri-Service General Hospital, National Taiwan University Hospital, and Chang Gung Memorial Hospital in Linkou) that contained information for scrambled patient identification, gender, birthday, residential area, dates of disease onset and admission, results of viral isolation and names of medical caregivers providing services. Daily virus-specific isolation rates were calculated using the number of positive identified respiratory infections specimens divided by the total specimens from regional reference virology laboratories.",

To model the non-linear and delayed effects for temperature and air pollutants, lag-stratified natural cubic spline (NS) DLNM models were adopted for analysis. Relative risks of temperature and air pollutants were estimated by cross-basis function in DLNM models. The cross-basis function contains the dimensions of variables and lag days.

(2008) reported. In literature, lower temperature and humidity were found correlated with respiratory tract infections (Liao et al., 2009, Makinen et al., 2009). Cold air could enhance the susceptibility of sensitive population by increasing vasoconstriction in upper airways and depressing the clearance mechanism of infections (Chu et al., 2006, Shephard and Shek, 1998). Additionally, transmission of suspected infectious bioaerosol (e.g., influenza viruses) has been reported negatively related with ambient temperature (Lowen et al., 2007). The present study detected significant correlations between average temperature and daily isolations for influenza A (correlations coefficient=\u22120.15, p<0.01), influenza B (correlations coefficient=\u22120.22, p<0.01), and adenoviruses (correlations coefficient=0.05, p<0.05). Future studies to address the effects of ambient environment and viral activity to upper respiratory infection are recommended. Besides, this study identified a negative association between average temperature and outpatient visits for temperatures ranged from 33 to 15 \u00b0C and a positive association between temperature lower than 15 \u00b0C (approximate 5th percentile of average temperature) and outpatient visits. A possible explanation is that people who have mild illness may prefer to stay in indoor environment and take actions in response to remit the symptoms themselves, rather than to seek medical help outside in cold temperature.",

But, ozone can also be protective because of its virucidal effect that relies on the exposure timing (before or after the respiratory infections) and duration (Ciencewicki and Jaspers, 2007). No matter the NO2 exposure is preceding or succeeding to respiratory viral infections, NO2 may decrease virus-specific immunity in mice and increase the inflammation of cells (Ciencewicki and Jaspers, 2007). The exposure of PM was suggested to decrease phagocytic ability and evoke infection in animal models, but the phenomenon was found specifically for respiratory syncytial virus only (Becker and Soukup, 1999, Kaan and Hegele, 2003, Lambert et al., 2003a, Lambert et al., 2003b).",

NO2 and PM10 were also found strongly correlated with respiratory infections for children in Toronto (Lin et al., 2005). In Hong Kong, general practitioner visits for acute upper respiratory infections were reported associated with ambient NO2, O3, PM10 and PM2.5. Similar to our finding, Wong et al. (2006) also identified NO2 with the greatest effects following by O3 on acute upper respiratory infections . However, we identified the positive association between PM2.5 and acute upper respiratory infections when its concentration exceeded 70 \u03bcg/m3 in Taipei metropolitan. Numerous studies reported a positive association between PM and mortality/morbidity of cardiopulmonary diseases (Wilson et al., 2004). Relatively few studies evaluated both the effects of ambient environment and circulating respiratory viruses on acute respiratory infections. Wong et al. (2009) assessed the modification of influenza on acute respiratory infections and suggested that ambient influenza activity should be involved in the consideration of short-term effects of air pollutants. Therefore, more studies focusing on related issues are warranted in the future.",

(2008) indicated that ozone level was correlated with 2-day lag of hospital admission for respiratory diseases in childhood. Fusco et al. (2001) found acute respiratory infections significantly associated with the levels of NO2 at lag 0 day , which was consistent to our observations. We have tried to evaluate the lag effects for virus-specific isolation rate on outpatient visits of acute upper respiratory infections. This study found influenza B and adenoviruses associated with acute upper respiratory infections at lag 0\u20133 days and lag 7\u201310 days, and lag effects were significant from lag 2\u20138 days for influenza A. In this study, we observed clear lag effects varying with covariates and their levels throughout evaluating periods (Fig. 4, Fig. 5, Fig. 6). Therefore, using DLNM to calculate the cumulative relative risks of outpatient visits for acute upper respiratory infections to risk factors on a given day and lag days would be a more sensible method.",

Therefore, the effect of other respiratory viruses, including rhinoviruses, coronaviruses, human metapneumovirus, bocavirus, polyomavirus, and bacterial infections which have been reported in recent studies (Brodzinski and Ruddy, 2009, Dasaraju and Liu, 1996, Denny, 1995, Mackie, 2003, Treanor and Lee, 2010, Wang et al., 2006) was out of the scope of present study. In addition, the influence from government-funded seasonal influenza vaccination campaign starting in 1999 in Taiwan was not evaluated in the present study, because Taiwan CDC did not establish a complete database for advanced evaluation. Moreover, current study utilized data of a cohort with one million subjects which was started in 2000 that implied the lack of information for children aged younger than 2 years during the study periods (2003\u20132007). Therefore, we were unable to generate the study outcomes to younger kids.",
