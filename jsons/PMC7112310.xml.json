            "text": "Autophagosomes are generated by the elongation of a small template membrane, termed the isolation membrane or phagophore (Fengsrud 2004, Mizushima 2001, Noda 2002, Reggiori 2005). There are several of these structures per cell but it still remains unknown where they are derived from. The surface of this small compartment is decorated with Atg5 and Atg16, and its formation requires phosphatidylinositol (PtdIns)\u20103\u2010kinase activity (Mizushima 2001, Mizushima 2003). There are two ways of triggering the expansion of the isolation membrane, and they differ depending if the process of autophagy is selective or nonselective (Section I.B) (Reggiori and Klionsky, 2005). When this pathway is selective, the binding to the isolation membrane of the cargo that has to be specifically eliminated (or in the case of resident hydrolases, activated) leads to the expansion of this structure (Ogawa 2005, Shintani 2004b). In contrast to selective autophagy, which is induced by intracellular components, the nonselective process is governed by extracellular stimuli such as nutrients or cytokines (Gutierrez 2004, Lum 2005, Shintani 2004a). In both cases, covalent conjugation of the ubiquitin\u2010like Atg12\u2013Atg5 seems to be the step that initiates the expansion of the isolation membrane (Mizushima et al., 2001).",

It is not known how the Atg12\u2013Atg5 complex recruits additional membranes, but the crescent autophagosome acquires more Atg12\u2013Atg5 and Atg16 along with a second ubiquitin\u2010like molecule, Atg8/LC3, that is unconventionally linked to phosphatidylethanolamine (PE), and probably the rest of the Atg proteins (Mizushima 2001, Mizushima 2003). Two expansion mechanisms are possible, one that relies on delivery of lipid bilayer by vesicular traffic (vesicular expansion) and one based on the fusion of small compartments (cisternal expansion) (Reggiori and Klionsky, 2005). In addition, it has been suggested that retrograde traffic balances double\u2010membrane vesicle biogenesis by recycling some Atg proteins, such as Atg9, and also recovering from the forming autophagosome membrane components specific to the compartment(s) of origin (Meiling\u2010Wesse 2005, Nazarko 2005, Nice 2002, Reggiori 2003, Reggiori 2004a, Reggiori 2004b).",

The fusion between the autophagosome and the lysosome/vacuole occurs as soon as these organelles dock and it is mediated by a set of proteins also used for other fusion reactions with the lysosome/vacuole (Section I.C). During this event, the external membrane of the autophagosome becomes part of the lysosome/vacuole surface whereas the inner autophagosomal vesicle is liberated in the interior of this organelle and now called an autophagic body (Fig. 1).",

But in recent years, it has become evident that autophagy plays an active role in several other physiological tasks highlighting its versatility and adaptability. We now know that this catabolic pathway participates in cellular processes such as development, cellular differentiation and rearrangement, elimination of aberrant structures, lifespan extension, MHC class II presentation of cytoplasmic antigens, and type II programmed cell death, as well as protecting against pathogens (both viruses and bacteria) and tumors (Cuervo 2005, Debnath 2005, Deretic 2005, Edinger 2003, Edinger 2004, Kirkegaard 2004, Komatsu 2005, Kondo 2005, Levine 2004, Paludan 2005, Rubinsztein 2005, Shintani 2004a). As a result, this degradative transport route plays a relevant role in the pathophysiology of neurodegenerative, cardiovascular, muscular, and autoimmune diseases, and some malignancies (Edinger 2003, Edinger 2004, Kondo 2005, Rubinsztein 2005, Shintani 2004a, Towns 2005).",

            "text": "The adaptability of this pathway is due to its ability to select specific cargoes when forced by circumstances. It has been believed for a long time that autophagy was a nonspecific process because when induced by starvation, cytoplasmic components and organelles were randomly sequestered into autophagosomes; however, this pathway can also be selective (Table I\n) (Reggiori and Klionsky, 2005). In the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, for example, aminopeptidase I (Ape1) and \u03b1\u2010mannosidase (Ams1) form a large oligomer that is unconventionally delivered from the cytoplasm directly to the vacuole interior through a process known as the cytoplasm to vacuole targeting (Cvt) pathway (Kim 1997, Shintani 2002). This transport route is specific and biosynthetic. Precursor Ape1 (prApe1) is packed into double\u2010membrane vesicles called Cvt vesicles, which are four to eight times smaller in surface area than autophagosomes (Baba 1997, Scott 1997). In the same organism, dysfunctional mitochondria are preferentially eliminated by autophagy (mitophagy) as well as superfluous peroxisomes (pexophagy) (Table I) (Hutchins 1999, Priault 2005). The specific sequestration of peroxisomes into double\u2010membrane vesicles and their subsequent degradation has also been very well described in other fungi such as Pichia pastoris, Hansenula polymorpha, and Yarrowia lipolytica (Dunn et al., 2005). Mammalian cells on the other hand, seem not to possess a transport route similar to the Cvt pathway, but there are indications that mitophagy could occur (Bota 2001, Elmore 2001, Rodriguez\u2010Enriquez 2006). Pexophagy has also been reported (Luiken 1992, Yokota 1993, Yokota 1994). It has lately been shown that autophagy can be selective in mammalian cells as well, as evidenced by the specific recognition and disposal of invading bacteria and potentially also of intracellular viruses (Table I) (Deretic 2005, Kirkegaard 2004, Levine 2005). In addition, a study analyzing conditional knock\u2010out mice defective for autophagy has revealed that the mutant animal accumulates numerous ubiquitinated aggregates in the cytosol, suggesting that this covalent protein modification could serve to specifically target to autophagosomes large structures that have to be eliminated (Komatsu et al., 2005).",

The function of several of these factors in the other pathways was already known and that has helped in clarifying the mechanism of autophagy. For example, yeast vacuoles can fuse with late endosomes [multivesicular bodies (MVB) pathway] or possibly with vesicles derived from the endosome [carboxypeptidase Y (CPY) pathway], Golgi\u2010derived vesicles [alkaline phosphatase (ALP) pathway], and with themselves (homotypic fusion). In all these cases, cells use an identical fusion machinery, which consists of SNARE proteins, Sec18 (NSF), Sec17 (\u03b1\u2010SNAP), a Rab\u2010GTPase, and the class C Vps protein complex also known as the HOPS complex. The same components have also been found to be exploited for the fusion of double\u2010membrane vesicles (Table IV) (Reggiori 2002, Wang 2003). Similarly, it is also now evident that the dissolution of autophagic bodies is mediated by the same hydrolases that degrades the MVB internal vesicles once these are released into the vacuole lumen (Table IV) (Epple 2003, Reggiori 2002).",

In contrast to mammalian cells where several isolation membranes can be simultaneously activated, a single perivacuolar site of organization for double\u2010membrane vesicle formation (named the pre\u2010autophagosomal structure, PAS) is observed in the yeast S. cerevisiae (Kim 2002, Suzuki 2001). The PAS is believed to be the yeast counterpart of a mammalian isolation membrane and in this unicellular eukaryote, most of the Atg proteins appear to be primarily restricted to this location. This unique site seems also to be present in H. polymorpha (Monastyrska 2005a, Monastyrska 2005b). In P. pastoris, however, several Atg components are distributed to more than one punctate structure (Ano 2005, Chang 2005, Kim 2001b, Mukaiyama 2004, Stromhaug 2001). It is unclear if this represents a difference between organisms or is due to different growth conditions. P. pastoris is mostly used for the study of pexophagy and therefore grown in special media containing carbon sources that induce peroxisome proliferation.",

After synthesis, prApe1 forms a large oligomer that first associates with the Atg19 cargo receptor and then with the Atg11 adaptor to form the Cvt complex (Shintani et al., 2002). This large cytosolic protein aggregate then moves in close proximity to the vacuole surface, where it induces the recruitment of the rest of the Atg factors, triggering the formation of the Cvt vesicle (Shintani 2004b, Yorimitsu 2005). Neither the PAS nor the vesicles are efficiently formed in the absence of any of the Cvt complex components, indicating that the cargo stimulates the biogenesis of these structures (Shintani and Klionsky, 2004b).

These data, however, do not exclude the possibility that Atg8\u2013PE conjugates are formed at the PAS as well. The association of Atg8\u2013PE with membranes prior to getting concentrated at the PAS suggests that the Atg8\u2013PE structures could be at least in part the source of autophagosome lipid bilayers. This idea is supported by the observation that in the absence of Atg8, membranes fail to be delivered to the PAS and therefore the size of autophagosomes is strongly reduced (Abeliovich 2000, Kirisako 1999, Lang 1998).",

Atg9 cycles between the PAS and several unknown punctate structures dispersed in the cytosol supporting the idea that it could partially supply the forming autophagosomes with membranes (Reggiori et al., 2004a).

This class of genes is involved in transport out of the ER (Kaiser and Schekman, 1990). Successive studies, however, have shown that these mutants have an indirect negative effect on both the Cvt pathway and autophagy (Hamasaki 2003, Reggiori 2004b). One possible explanation of their phenotype is that they alter the ER morphology and consequently impair several functions of this organelle, including the putative one to supply membranes for double\u2010membrane vesicle formation. For example, the ER is structurally connected with the mitochondria and the disruption of the ER organization in the early sec mutants causes the fragmentation of the mitochondrial reticulum (Prinz et al., 2000). As mentioned, Atg9 partially localizes to mitochondria, and in this class of mutants its trafficking out of this compartment is severely impaired (Reggiori and Klionsky, submitted).",

Mutations that affect one of these two compartments indirectly perturb the other one. Along these lines, the interpretation of the block of both the Cvt pathway and autophagy in the sec7 mutant is not simple (Reggiori et al., 2004b). Nevertheless, the analysis of this strain has led to important information. Sec7 is a GDP/GTP exchange factor required for trafficking through the Golgi complex (Franzusoff 1989, Jackson 2000). The inactivation of this protein provokes the accumulation of unsealed, autophagosome\u2010like structures that are decorated with Atg8 (Reggiori et al., 2004b). These membranous arrangements enwrap ribosomes and cytosol and have been previously named Berkeley bodies (Esmon 1981, Novick 1980). This surprising result indicates that potentially, double\u2010membrane vesicles can be created in large part by altering the activity of a single enzyme; however, it cannot be excluded that this is an indirect phenomenon.",

This led to an initial interpretation that endosomes play a relevant role in autophagosomes biogenesis.

It is still unknown if this small sequestering cisterna is formed de novo or derived from a preexisting organelle (Fengsrud et al., 2004). A major problem in trying to investigate its origin is that these structures and autophagosomes are mostly composed of lipids and depleted in transmembrane proteins making particularly difficult the detection of specific organelle markers (Fengsrud 2000, Hirsimaki 1982, Punnonen 1989, Reunanen 1985, Stromhaug 1998). This unique characteristic is one line of evidence that the isolation membranes and autophagosomes differ structurally from the other subcellular organelles. This observation also implies that whatever the origin of the lipid bilayers used to form autophagosomes, integral membrane components are segregated away from them.",

The lipidated protein, called LC3\u2010II, localizes on both autophagosomes and autolysosomes (Kabeya et al., 2000). These in vitro results have been confirmed using transgenic mice expressing GFP\u2010LC3 (Mizushima et al., 2004). Unfortunately, the small amount of LC3\u2010II generated prior to induction of autophagy is already associated with the double\u2010membrane vesicles formed by the basal activity of this pathway and LC3\u2010I is not clearly associated with a distinct membranous structure (Kabeya et al., 2004). Therefore, the subcellular localization of these molecules has not furnished insights about the lipid bilayer source.",

Because the three mammalian Atg8 homologs are differently expressed in various tissues (Tanida et al., 2004), another intriguing option is that these proteins are involved in supplying the autophagosome with membranes derived from different compartments depending on the cell type; for example, GATE\u201016 from the Golgi complex and GABARAP from the same organelle as well as the synaptic cisternae (Kittler 2001, Kneussel 2000, Sagiv 2000).",

In human adult tissues, HsATG9L1 is ubiquitously expressed, whereas HsATG9L2 is highly expressed in placenta and pituitary gland. Importantly, the authors have also shown that these two factors are not distributed on mitochondria. Instead they localize to a perinuclear region, suggesting that in higher eukaryotes Atg9 could supply autophagy with membranes by deriving lipid bilayers from a different reservoir. This observation could also explain why HsAtg9L1 and HsAtg9L2 cannot substitute for the yeast Atg9 (Reggiori 2005b, Yamada 2005). However, HsAtg9L2 possesses a nonfunctional mitochondrial targeting sequence that is also present in its closest higher eukaryote homologs (Yamada et al., 2005). This characteristic raises the possibility that this is an ancient localization signal. Because the subcellular distribution of HsAtg9L1 and HsAtg9L2 have not been carefully examined and the preliminary localization analysis was performed with overexpressed proteins, the identification of the precise localization of these two proteins could provide insights into membrane dynamics during autophagosome biogenesis in mammals.",

These morphological changes correlate with the increasing acquisition of lysosomal makers (Berg 1998, Dunn 1990b, Liou 1997, Tanaka 2000). Autophagosomes, which contain intact cytosol and organelles, fuse first with endosomal vesicles and MVB turning into early degradative autophagic vacuoles (AVd) or amphisomes. These structures successively fuse together or with lysosomes becoming late AVd or autolysosomes. The degradation of the internal material starts in the early AVd and continues in the late AVd until completion.",

In yeast, double\u2010membrane vesicles fuse with a much larger vacuole one after the other. Therefore, their cargoes do not influence the hydrolytic capacity of this compartment by altering, for example, the pH because the volume of their contents is just a fraction of that of the entire vacuole. Lysosomes, in contrast, are much smaller than vacuoles and their size is comparable to that of autophagosomes. Consequently, if these two structures would immediately fuse together, an important dilution of the lysosome content could occur impairing its internal enzymatic activity. Addition of extra hydrolytic enzymes prior to autolysosome formation could help to compensate for this dilution phenomenon.",

After being taken up by phagosomes, this pathogen becomes enwrapped within a double\u2010membrane compartment that contains the ER resident chaperone BiP through an unknown mechanism, and starts to replicate (Coers 2000, Joshi 2001, Sturgill\u2010Koszycki 2000, Swanson 1995). It has been shown that this compartment also progressively becomes decorated with typical autophagosome markers such as Atg7 and Atg8 (Amer and Swanson, 2005). However, it remains unclear if these structures are autophagosomes or similar conformations derived from the ER that at successive stage acquire autophagosomal membranes or subvert the autophagy machinery to complete their biogenesis (Kagan 2002, Tilney 2001). In Dictyostelium discoideum, a natural host for L. pneumophila, deletion of ATG genes leads to a defect in autophagy without affecting the formation of the double\u2010membrane compartment and therefore the replication of this invading microorganism is unaffected (Otto et al., 2004). But this could just reflect host\u2010specific differences.",

However, when infected cells are treated with chloramphenicol, an inhibitor of bacterial protein synthesis, or lack the actA gene, the bacteria become trapped into double\u2010membrane compartments shortly after phagosome lysis (Rich et al., 2003). These structures are autophagosomes because L. monocytogenes sequestration is enhanced by autophagic induction through serum withdrawal and blocked by autophagy inhibitors such as 3\u2010methyladenine and wortmannin (Rich et al., 2003). The formation of these autophagosomes seems to be mediated by the assembly of small vesicles and cisternae with variable morphology, which contain the ER protein marker protein disulfide isomerase (PDI). Importantly, PDI\u2010positive vesicular structures are accumulated around the cytoplasmic bacteria during the early stages of autophagosome biogenesis but not at later stages when these structures begin to acquire endosomal makers (Rich et al., 2003).",

Despite the identification and partial characterization of the Atg proteins, however, the molecular mechanism of this catabolic transport route remains largely unknown. A major challenge in studying this process arises from the fact that the origin and the transport mode of the lipids employed to compose these structures is unknown. Investigations on this topic seem to indicate that the ER and possibly the Golgi complex are involved in supplying the nascent autophagosomes with membranes. Endosomal compartments, in contrast, play a relevant role only in mammalian cells and at a later stage during autophagosome maturation.",

Analysis of pathogens and their gene products has helped in the past to unveil and analyze numerous cellular pathways. The discovery of the existence of viruses and bacteria subverting autophagy will probably have a similar impact.

Upon vesicle completion, the autophagosome docks with the lysosome/vacuole and successively fuses with it.
