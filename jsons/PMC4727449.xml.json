            "text": "Coronaviruses (CoVs) are enveloped RNA viruses mainly responsible for respiratory and enteric infections in animals and humans (Lai et al., 2007, Masters, 2006). Historically, CoV infection in humans has been associated with mild upper respiratory tract diseases caused by the human CoVs (HCoVs) HCoV-229E and HCoV-OC43 (Masters, 2006). However, the identification in 2003 of a novel life-threatening CoV causing the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS-CoV) redefined historic perceptions (Stadler et al., 2003). More recently, three novel HCoVs associated with respiratory diseases have been identified, including HCoV-HKU1 associated with chronic pulmonary disease (Woo et al., 2005), HCoV-NL63 that causes upper and lower respiratory tract disease in children and adults worldwide (van der Hoek et al., 2004), and the recently emerged (April 2012) Middle East respiratory syndrome CoV (MERS-CoV), which has been associated with acute pneumonia and occasional renal failure (Zaki et al., 2012). These findings have potentiated the relevance of CoVs as important human pathogens and highlight the need of reverse genetic systems to facilitate the genetic manipulation of the viral genome to study fundamental viral processes, to develop vaccine candidates and to test antiviral drugs.",

They contain the largest known RNA genome among RNA viruses, consisting in a plus-sense, 5\u2032-capped and polyadenylated RNA molecule of 27\u201331 kb in length. The first two-thirds of the genome encode the replicase gene, which comprise two overlapping open reading frames (ORFs), ORF 1a and ORF 1b, the latter being translated by a ribosomal frameshift mechanism. Translation of both ORFs results in the synthesis of two polyproteins that are processed by viral proteinases to release the replication\u2013transcription complex components. The final one-third of the genome includes the genes encoding the structural proteins S, E, M, and N, as well as the genus specific proteins characteristic of each CoV, which are expressed from a nested set of 3\u2032 coterminal subgenomic mRNAs (Enjuanes et al., 2006, Masters, 2006, Ziebuhr, 2005).",

Among these methods, targeted RNA recombination was the first reverse genetic system devised for CoVs at a time when it was not clear whether the construction of full-length infectious cDNA clones would ever be technically feasible. Targeted RNA recombination, originally developed for mouse hepatitis virus (MHV), takes advantage of the high rate of homologous RNA recombination in CoVs (Baric et al., 1990, Kusters et al., 1990, Makino et al., 1986). In this system, a synthetic donor RNA expanding the last 10 kb of the genome is transfected into cells infected with a recipient parental virus presenting some characteristics that can be selected against (ts phenotype or host range-based selection). Mutant recombinant viruses are then identified by counterselection of the recipient parental virus and purified.",

Therefore, the development of reverse genetic approaches based on full-length cDNAs, which do not have these limitations, should provide a tremendous encouragement to the study of CoV biology. However, the large size of the genome (around 30 kb), the instability of some CoV replicase gene sequences when they were propagated as cloned cDNA in bacteria, and the difficulty to synthesize full-length transcripts in vitro have hampered the generation of CoV full-length infectious cDNA clones. Recently, these problems were overcome employing three creative nontraditional approaches based on the use of bacterial artificial chromosomes (BACs) (Almazan et al., 2000), in vitro ligation of cDNA fragments (Yount et al., 2000), and vaccinia virus as a vector for the propagation of CoV full-length cDNAs (Thiel et al., 2001a). In this report, we review and discuss these three different approaches developed for building CoV infectious cDNAs by using SARS-CoV as a model, and how these CoV reverse genetic systems have now been extended to the generation of CoV replicon RNAs.",

In this system, the full-length cDNA copy of the viral genome is assembled in the BAC plasmid pBeloBAC11 (Wang et al., 1997), a synthetic low-copy-number plasmid based on the Escherichia coli F-factor (Shizuya et al., 1992) that presents a strictly controlled replication leading to one or two plasmid copies per cell. This plasmid allows the stable maintenance in bacteria of large DNA fragments from a variety of complex genomic sources (Adler et al., 2003, Shizuya et al., 1992) and minimizes the toxicity associated with several CoV sequences when amplified in high-copy-number plasmids. The full-length cDNA is assembled under the control of the cytomegalovirus (CMV) immediate-early promoter that allows the expression of the viral RNA in the nucleus by the cellular RNA polymerase II (Dubensky et al., 1996), and it is flanked at the 3\u2032-end by a poly(A) tail, the hepatitis delta virus (HDV) ribozyme and the bovine growth hormone (BGH) termination and polyadenylation sequences to produce synthetic RNAs bearing authentic 3\u2032-ends of the viral genome.

The first step was the selection of appropriate restriction sites in the viral genome that were absent in the BAC plasmid. In case that no adequate restriction sites were available in the viral genome, new restriction sites could be generated by the introduction of silent mutations. In the second step, the intermediate BAC plasmid pBAC-SARS-CoV 5\u2032\u20133\u2032 was generated as the backbone to assemble the full-length cDNA clone. This plasmid contained the 5\u2032-end of the genome under the control of the CMV promoter, a multicloning site containing the restriction sites selected in the first step, and the 3\u2032-end of the genome followed by a 25-nt synthetic poly(A), the HDV ribozyme and the BGH termination and polyadenylation sequences. Finally, the full-length cDNA clone (pBAC-SARS-CoVFL) was assembled by sequential cloning of five overlapping cDNA fragments (SARS-1 to SARS-5) into the multicloning site of the intermediate BAC plasmid (Fig. 1). The overlapping cDNA fragments flanked by the appropriate restriction sites were generated by standard reverse transcription PCR (RT-PCR). The assembled SARS-CoV BAC clone was fully stable in E. coli and infectious virus was rescued after transfection of susceptible cells (Almazan et al., 2006).",

Furthermore, the manipulation of BAC clones is relatively easy and essentially similar to that of a conventional plasmid with slight modifications owing to the large size of the BAC clones and the presence of this plasmid in only one or two copies per cell (Shizuya et al., 1992). Besides standard protocols for the manipulation of conventional plasmids, the BAC clones could be easily and efficiently modified into E. coli by homologous recombination using a two-step procedure that combines the Red recombination system and counterselection with the homing endonuclease I-SceI (Jamsai et al., 2003, Lee et al., 2001, Tischer et al., 2006, Zhang et al., 1998). In a first step, a linear marker construct containing the desired modification and I-SceI recognition site is inserted via Red recombination into the target site using positive selection. In a second step, the induced I-SceI cleaves at its recognition site creating DNA double strand breaks. Then, the adjoining duplicate sequence previously introduced is used as the substrate for a second intramolecular Red recombination, resulting in the loss of the previously introduced marker. This novel approach results in an accurate and highly efficient method to introduce insertions, deletions or point mutations in BAC clones without retention of unwanted foreign sequences.",

In the last case, a combination of synthetic biology and the use of BACs allowed the generation of a MERS-CoV infectious clone only four months after the first MERS-CoV outbreak, illustrating the power of the BAC approach. Recently, modified BAC approaches have been used to generate full-length cDNA clones of the SARS-CoV strains Frankfurt-1 (Pfefferle et al., 2009) and TOR2 related clinical isolate CV7 (Tylor et al., 2009), assembled in a BAC under the control of the T7 RNA polymerase promoter. In the case of the Frankfurt-1 strain, infectious virus was rescued after transfection of the full-length transcripts derived from the in vitro transcription of the linearized BAC construct. This approach combines plasmid-based handling of the infectious clone with direct delivery of genome-like RNA into the cytoplasm, circumventing transcription of the infectious clone in the nucleus driven by the CMV promoter, and avoiding the possibility of splicing. However, although some splicing could occur during the nuclear expression of the viral genome, the efficiency of this phenomenon is very low and does not affect the recovery of infectious virus (Almazan et al., 2000). In contrast, in the case of the CV7 isolate, infectious virus was recovered in situ from cells transfected with the BAC clone and infected with a modified vaccinia Ankara expressing T7 RNA polymerase. In this system an in vitro transcription step is also avoided.",

BglI is a class II restriction enzyme that cleaves a symmetrical palindromic sequence (GCCNNNN\u2193NGGC) but leaves different asymmetric 3-nt overhangs that do not randomly self-assemble and only anneal with the complementary 3-nt overhang generated at an identical BglI site.

            "text": "One potential problem of this approach is that several silent mutations have to be inserted in the genome to avoid potential T7 transcription termination signals and to introduce the unique BglI sites used to assemble the full-length cDNA clones. To overcome this problem, a variation of the approach was used to engineer the MHV infectious cDNA (Yount et al., 2002). The strategy is based on the incorporation of type IIS restriction enzymes (Esp31, SapI, BsaI and BsmI, among others) at the ends of the cDNA fragments. These enzymes recognize asymmetrical sites and cleave external to the recognition sequences, leaving 1\u20134-nt variable ends that can be only anneal with the complementary overhang generated at an identical site (Esp31 site, CGTCTCN\u2193NNNN). Using these type IIS restriction enzyme sites, two contiguous cDNA fragments could be ligated in vitro with traditional cloning approaches, leaving the restriction site within the viral genome sequence. However, due to the asymmetrical nature of these recognition sites, a simple reverse orientation allows for the insertion of these sites on the ends of two adjacent cDNA fragments with the variable overhang generated from the virus sequence (No See\u2019m cloning strategy). Upon cleavage and ligation, both restriction sites are removed, leaving the exact viral sequence at the junction. This approach allows the generation of cDNA clones without mutating the viral genome sequence. Following this modified approach, the full-length cDNA clone of MHV was generated from either the sequential (in several steps) or simultaneous in vitro ligation of seven cDNA fragments covering the entire MHV genome (Yount et al., 2002). The feasibility of this method has been demonstrated later by the successful assembly of full-length infectious clones of infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) (Fang et al., 2007, Tan et al., 2006, Youn et al., 2005) and HCoV-NL63 (Donaldson et al., 2008).",

The cDNAs are subsequently ligated in vitro to produce a small number of cDNAs, which encompass the entire genome. The specific ligation strategy is determined by the sequence of the particular CoV, and mainly consists on naturally occurring or engineered restriction sites. For SARS-CoV strain HKU-39849, five cDNA fragments encompassing the whole genome were initially in vitro ligated with each other and with synthetic oligonucleotide linkers, resulting in the generation of two cDNAs spanning nucleotides 1\u201320,288 and 20,272\u201329,727, respectively (van den Worm et al., 2012) (Fig. 3). A crucial step in this process is to modify the cDNAs containing the 5\u2032 and 3\u2032-ends of the CoV genome in order to finally produce infectious RNA molecules. To this end, a transcription promoter sequence for the bacteriophage T7 RNA polymerase is located upstream the CoV genome and a synthetic poly(A) at the 3\u2032-end of the genome, followed by a unique restriction site that can be used to generate run-off transcripts (Fig. 3). Finally, to insert the CoV cDNA into a single NotI site present in the genomic DNA of the vaccinia virus vector vNotI/tk, the 5\u2032 and 3\u2032-genomic termini of cDNA fragments have to contain the restriction sites EagI or Bsp120I, which lead to DNA ends compatible with NotI-cleaved vaccinia virus vector DNA. During the cloning steps of SARS-CoV cDNA sequences, some problems arose such as the instability in bacterial plasmids of viral cDNA sequences (nt 11,370\u201311,905) and unexpected RT-PCR introduced mutations and deletions. The incorrect cDNA regions were replaced by appropriate SARS-CoV sequences using vaccinia virus-mediated homologous recombination, as it will be described below.",

Subsequently, the ligation reaction is transfected into CV-1 mammalian cells infected with fowlpox virus as a helper (Scheiflinger et al., 1992) to rescue recombinant vaccinia viruses including the cDNA of CoV genome sequences. Because fowlpox virus infection of mammalian cells is abortive, and possible recombination events between both poxviruses are extremely rare, the resulting virus stocks collected from cells contain exclusively recombinant vaccinia viruses (Thiel et al., 2001a, Thiel et al., 2001b). In the case of SARS-CoV, two recombinant vaccinia viruses spanning nucleotides 1\u201320,288 (SARS-CoV 5\u2032) and 20,272\u201329,727 (SARS-CoV 3\u2032) were generated (Fig. 3).

            "text": "Previous experience in the vaccinia virus reverse genetic system has shown that the N transcript may become essential for the recue of some CoVs such as IBV (Casais et al., 2001). Therefore, to contribute positively to the recovery of CoVs, different methods involving N protein expression were used. Initially, N transcripts were cotransfected with the infectious RNA, as described for MHV (Coley et al., 2005). More recently, full-length SARS-CoV RNA synthesized in vitro with the T7 RNA polymerase was transfected into BHK cells inducibly expressing the SARS-CoV N protein (Chang et al., 2010) and the transfected cells were then co-cultivated with susceptible cells to rescue eventually the recombinant SARS-CoV (van den Worm et al., 2012). The requirement of the N protein to establish a productive CoV infection from infectious RNA or DNA has been shown to be variable. Several CoVs such as TGEV, SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV were efficiently rescued from infectious cDNAs engineered as BACs, independently of N protein coexpression (Almazan et al., 2000, Almazan et al., 2006, Almazan et al., 2013). Similarly, HCoV-229E was rescued from vaccinia virus in the absence of N protein expressed in trans (Thiel et al., 2001a). In contrast, N transcripts were essential to rescue IBV from recombinant vaccinia virus (Casais et al., 2001). In an intermediate situation, the rescue of MHV and TGEV from full-length cDNA constructs assembled in vitro was significantly enhanced by the inclusion of N-coding transcripts (Baric and Sims, 2005, Yount et al., 2002). These results suggest that CoV cDNAs engineered as BACs and transcribed by the cellular pol II to produce infectious RNAs represent a more efficient method for virus recovery as compared to the other systems relying on infectious RNAs transcribed by T7 polymerase, since these reverse genetic systems depend at different extents on N transcripts. At this moment, it is not clear whether N transcripts, N protein, or both are essential for increased virus recovery yields. Nevertheless, previous results have shown that the N protein is involved in CoV RNA transcription and increases RNA synthesis (Almazan et al., 2004, Schelle et al., 2005, Zu\u00f1iga et al., 2010).",

            "text": "One important advantage of the vaccinia virus reverse genetic system is that vaccinia virus-mediated homologous recombination (Ball, 1987) can be used to modify the CoV genomic cDNA during its propagation in vaccinia virus. This site-directed mutagenesis strategy has been extensively applied to introduce heterologous sequences in the genome of recombinant CoVs (van den Worm et al., 2012), for gene deletion or modification (Casais et al., 2005, Lei et al., 2013, Roth-Cross et al., 2009, Stokes et al., 2010) or even to repair error sequences (Coley et al., 2005, van den Worm et al., 2012). Two recombination methods based on the sequential use of the E. coli guanine-phosphoribosyl transferase gene (gpt) as both a positive and a negative selection marker (Armesto et al., 2008, Britton et al., 2005, Eriksson et al., 2008) have been developed. In the first method (Falkner and Moss, 1988, Thiel and Siddell, 2005) the CoV region of interest in the recombinant vaccinia virus is replaced by the E. coli gpt gene. This gene is encoded in a plasmid DNA and flanked by CoV sequences to facilitate a double recombination event. Vaccinia viruses containing the gpt gene at the expected CoV genome position are isolated under gpt-positive selection on mammalian CV-1 cells. In a second step, the introduced gpt gene is replaced by a gene of interest encoded in a plasmid DNA and flanked by CoV sequences mediating double homologous recombination events. Isolation of recombinant viruses with the gene of interest requires gpt-negative selection in HeLa-D980R cells.",

Then, the complete sequence of this plasmid is transiently integrated into the vaccinia virus including the CoV genome by homologous recombination involving a single crossover event. The recombinant vaccinia viruses expressing the gpt gene are positively selected. Finally, the gpt marker is lost in the absence of the selective pressure, by a single homologous recombination event between duplicated sequences.

Replicons are self-amplifying nucleic acids that contain all viral proteins and RNA signals required for viral RNA synthesis, and in some cases reporter genes to facilitate the analyses. As replicons lack structural proteins and no infectious viral particles are produced, they constitute a safe alternative to full-length infectious cDNAs, especially for BSL3 viruses. Moreover, stable cell lines containing non-cytopathic selectable virus replicons have also been obtained (Bartenschlager, 2002). Therefore, replicons represent a safe tool for virus replication studies and antiviral compound screening, and even for the setup of semi-automated high-throughput screening systems.",

In the case of SARS-CoV, a collection of replicons has been engineered, either using the BAC system (Almazan et al., 2006) or by in vitro ligation (Ge et al., 2007). Different replicon versions include a variety of reporter genes, such as green fluorescent protein (GFP), firefly luciferase (FLuc), or Renilla luciferase (RLuc), alone or in combination with antibiotic selection genes (Ahn et al., 2011, Ge et al., 2007, Pan et al., 2008, Tanaka et al., 2012).",

The SARS-CoV replicon obtained by in vitro ligation also includes a GFP-BlaR fusion gene, located downstream of the ORF 1b, under the transcriptional control of S gene TRS (TRS-S). This heterologous reporter gene, which confers resistance to blasticidin selection, allowed the generation of the first selectable SARS-CoV replicon cell line (Ge et al., 2007). Several BAC-based SARS-CoV replicons also included heterologous genes located downstream of the ORF 1b. RLuc was expressed under the control of TRS-N (Tanaka et al., 2012), although eventually, the duplication of TRS-N sequences could lead to reporter gene loss after several replication cycles. Alternatively, FLuc-NeoR fusion gene (conferring neomycin resistance) was expressed under the control of TRS-N (Ahn et al., 2011) or TRS-M (Pan et al., 2008). In this case, antibiotic selection would avoid reporter gene loss and allows the future development of selectable cell lines.",

One of the most promising applications of SARS-CoV replicons is their use for antiviral drug screening. Since SARS-CoV replicons lack structural proteins, compounds inhibiting virus entry or morphogenesis could not be tested. Nevertheless, with some exceptions (Kilianski and Baker, 2014), these virus life cycle steps are poor antiviral targets, as virus escape mutants could be easily recovered, especially when virus structural proteins are targeted. On the other hand, replicase proteins or viral RNA motifs involved in CoV replication are in general more conserved, and their mutation rate could be lower than that of the structural proteins due to higher fitness pressure. In fact, several key enzymatic activities, such as main protease or papain-like protease, have been analyzed as targets for CoV antiviral drugs (Kilianski and Baker, 2014).",

Moreover, a selectable SARS-CoV replicon cell line was used for the development of a semi-automated high-throughput antiviral compound screening system, with minimum manipulation after assay set-up, low compound volume, and automated detection of end-point fluorescence (Ge et al., 2008). Interestingly, after a screening of a 7,035 compound library, and selection of 7 drugs for further testing, a good correlation was observed between fluorescence levels and SARS-CoV RNA or protein synthesis, highlighting the system suitability. A limitation of this kind of cell-based screening systems is that the viral or cell drug target is not identified, and further analyses using other experimental approaches are required.",

            "text": "The potential risk to public health posed by SARS-CoV and other CoVs, and the lack of specific antiviral agents and vaccines, have triggered a global effort to study this family of viruses at the molecular level in order to develop effective strategies to prevent and control CoV infections. Molecular genetic analysis of the structure and function of RNA virus genomes has been profoundly advanced by the availability of full-length cDNA clones. In the case of CoV, the huge genome size and the instability of specific CoV cDNA sequences in bacterial systems hindered the development of infectious cDNA clones until recently. A tremendous amount of creativity in the CoV field resulted in the development of four independent and unique reverse genetic systems that overcame these problems. These reverse genetic systems have been established using non-traditional approaches, which are based on the use of targeted recombination, BACs, in vitro ligation of CoV cDNA fragments, and vaccinia virus as a vector for the propagation of CoV genomic cDNAs. The availability of CoV full-length infectious clones and recombinant viruses expressing reporter genes constitute important tools for the study of CoV replication and transcription mechanisms, virus-host interaction and pathogenesis, and also for the rapid and rational development and testing of genetically defined vaccines. In addition to full-length cDNA clones, the generation of CoV replicons has greatly facilitated the functional analysis of viral replication and transcription, as well as the analysis of antiviral drugs without the need of manipulating infectious viruses.",
