Emotions can get the better of you, for example being rushed into making a major dollar purchase because a salesperson made an offer that should not be refused but turned out badly, or facing a delay in one of your work schedules. These are some episodes that can lead you to make further poor decisions and responses that are inappropriate, upsetting the implementation of your action plan. Mistakes are easy to make and you are human. But getting out of such situations may not be easy because you may go through self-denial, justify your actions, or come up with some other excuse. Therefore, you may leave it too late to take corrective measures and the consequences may be an unrecoverable lapse into ruin.",

Once we obtained our ISO9001 certification and IEC guide-25 accreditation, we were ready for business. The first BRASS-accredited test was the endotoxin test. The target clientele was dialysis centers, as Singapore by law required dialysis water to be tested for endotoxin and chemistry on a regular basis. We spoke to the dialysis centers in Singapore. One dialysis center chain had a regular tests service provider and was change averse. A smaller dialysis center chain and other dialysis clinics had an issue of liaising with two service providers, one for endotoxin testing the other for chemistry, impacting their already busy workload. BRASS had no chemistry capability at the time. But we knew we could sub-contract. Consequently, BRASS tied-up with an accredited chemistry testing laboratory and presented our bundling solution to the smaller dialysis center chain and the dialysis clinics. The nurses in charge readily accepted the gift from heaven, and we were off to the races.",

After the Singapore government announced the biomed initiative in 2000, BRASS still had a relatively comfortable local environment to maneuver in. BRASS continued to focus on building its tests offerings, client base, and regionally representing two Global companies. As time passed, BRASS also began to be attractive as a mid-term sub-contractor to several clients. Due to one of the quirks of the biomed industry, once a sub-contractor is qualified, changing to another sub-contractor is difficult, as it would involve additional costs and time. Being \u201cthe first kid on the block\u201d was an advantage to BRASS. But once you make inroads, you begin to get noticed.

The only time there are hitches is when their accounts department do not receive the invoices by the cut-off date. To avoid this, you have to follow up with the recipient of service in that organization to approve the payment for work completed by you and forward your invoice to their accounts department. This observation applies to some big companies in nearby countries as well, and in this instance you can be more flexible in collection; but if the sum is large, it is still wise to collect upfront.2.Smaller companies and lower invoiced amounts are generally slower to be collected. They may face a cash flow challenge themselves and place a priority in paying off the larger debts first as those are normally more critical to their operations.3.Defaulters tend to be first and one-time clients.\n",

The bad news is that this is where many falter and commence a downward spiral they do not recover from. Why? 1.The initial success bug bites you and the \u201cI can do all things now\u201d mode infects you. Overconfidence is an enemy of success. It does not hit you all at once; it eases itself in and is hard to spot. It may cause you to abandon the cautious methodical process you have adopted that got you through the first stage. You need to maintain this all the way to true success (refer to Chapter 13).2.By now you are used to leading, i.e. telling everyone else what to do. You know what\u2019s best. Don\u2019t kid yourself! This is when you are in more danger of lapsing into arrogance. Everybody loves a winner, but not too many will have the same sentiment for an obnoxious winner.3.The consequence of growing is specialization. Compartmentalization is unavoidable when you are transiting from start-up to a corporate mode of action. The best thing I did for BRASS when it started making good profits was to remove myself from the company and let a seasoned businessman hold the reins. He set a structure in place. When I returned in 2009, there was an admin department with an HR executive and a finance clerk. A sales department interacted with operations. Operations had various sub-units organized around the work done. Today, that structure has been further refined. You require structure when you grow, the extent depending on the pace of growth. This pace has to match your cash position.4.You are known for one product, and when you grow, one product type. If you change category, or add new categories, your fortunes can change in an unfavorable direction. People know you for who you are. Stick with your identity and learn how to capitalize on it. This is about establishing and maintaining your business differentiation.1 Remember who you are. My task in 2009 was to revitalize the science in BRASS. I changed the logo from a medical device theme to a more bio-based (a DNA double helix strand adorns the logo) format. Call this intuition because I had no idea BRASS would be more bio-pharmaceutical focused today. BRASS continued to progress because old and new clients know and rely on BRASS\u2019s foundation, science. Your focus can shift from medical device to bio-pharmaceuticals as long as you ensure your base maintains its strength and heritage.5.Finally, always remember that you are only as good as your last sale (the business equivalent of the academic \u201cyou are as good as your last publication\u201d). You have to grow your business. But in a manner that makes sense for your business as suggested above.\n",
