This paper addresses an example of such type of crisis, namely the spread of the new Coronavirus disease 2019 . The study deals with the statistical comparison and visualization of country-based realdata for the period December 31, 2019, up to April 12, 2020, and does not intend to address the medical treatment of the disease. Two distinct approaches are considered, the description of the number of infected people across time by means of heuristic models fitting the real-world data, and the comparison of countries based on hierarchical clustering and multidimensional scaling. The computational and mathematical modeling lead to the emergence of patterns, highlighting similarities and differences between the countries, pointing toward the main characteristics of the complex dynamics.",

The work by Kermack and McKendrick [18] formulated the general theory of susceptible-infected-recovered (SIR). A SIR model involves a system of coupled equations relating the numbers of susceptible, infected and recovered people over time, and computes the theoretical number of infected people in a closed population. Many variations of the original SIR model were proposed, such as the susceptible-infectious-susceptible (SIS) and the susceptible-exposed-infectious-recovered (SEIR), based on ordinary [19] , stochastic [20] and fractional order [21, 22] differential equations. These recent versions were adopted for studying the spread of distinct infectious diseases [23, 24] , including the COVID-19 [25] . However, the main concern of such approach is the model validation, since it requires to compare the results with real data. Contrary to modeldriven, data-driven approaches rely on data series for deriving adequate fitting functions. These heuristic models describe well one stage of the epidemic, but fail when the disease evolves toward a different phase. We must also note that the heuristic model is useless in the initial epidemic phase, due to insufficient data [26, 27] .",

The study does not aim to be a contribution tailored for medical treatment or prevention of the disease. Therefore, in a first phase, we adopt a nonlinear least-squares technique to determine possible candidate heuristic models for describing the data regarding COVID-19 infections. In a second phase, we use distinct metrics for processing the data both in the time and frequency domains. The information is visualized using hierarchical clustering (HC) and multidimensional scaling (MDS) for comparing the COVID-19 evolution in the different countries. The HC and MDS generate loci of Fig. 1 Geographic map of the COVID-19 spread for 165 countries. The color map is proportional to the number of days elapsed since the occurrence of the first case for each country for the period of time \u03c4 points in 2-and 3-dimensional spaces representing the number of infections for each country. The positioning and the patterns formed by the points lead to direct interpretations of the results. The study is data-driven, and the models are applicable only at some stages of the outbreak and when enough data points are available.",

Data for the period from December 31, 2019, up to April 12, 2020, were collected for analysis. This period of time will be denoted as \u03c4 henceforth. Figure 1 depicts a geographic map where the colormap is proportional to the number of days elapsed since the occurrence of the first case in each country. We verify that the COVID-19 is particularly severe in the northern hemisphere and, thus, seems not to follow the same pattern of other serious diseases that affected mainly the underdeveloped countries. Therefore, some possible synchronization between countries, or, even, the emergence of new waves of spread in the future are still unclear and techniques such as the Kuramoto model [28] for assessing that hypothesis should be considered.",

We recall that a probability distribution (PD) (and the corresponding random variable \u03be ) is said to be 'stable' if a linear combination of 2 independent random variables with such PD has also an identi-cal PD, up to the scale and location parameters, c and \u03bc, respectively [29, 30] . A given family of stable distributions is often called L\u00e9vy alpha-stable distribution, after Paul L\u00e9vy [31] . The L\u00e9vy, Gaussian and Cauchy PD of a random variable \u03be are particular cases of the \u03b1-stable distribution family with the parameter value \u03b1 = 1 2 , 1 and 2, respectively [32] . The \u03b1-stable distribution is a four parameter family of distributions and is (usually) denoted by S(\u03b1, \u03b2, c, \u03bc). The first parameter \u03b1 is of particular relevance and describes the tail of the distribution. We have \u03b1 \u2208 (0, 2] for the stability (or characteristic exponent), \u03b2 \u2208 [\u22121, 1] representing the skewness, c \u2208 (0, \u221e) standing for the scale, and \u03bc \u2208 (\u2212\u221e, +\u221e) for location parameters.

In the first, each object starts in its own cluster and the successive iterations merge the pair of most similar clusters until there is a single cluster. In the second technique all objects start in one cluster and, during the iterations, the 'outsiders' are removed from the least cohesive cluster, until each object is in a separate cluster. In both cases the HC requires a linkage criterion, that is a function of the distances between pairs of items, for quantifying the dissimilarity between clusters. Metrics such as the maximum, minimum and average linkages are often used.

The axes of the MDS plot have neither units nor a special physical meaning. The quality of the MDS can be assessed through the stress and Shepard diagrams. The stress chart represents S versus d. The plot is monotonically decreasing and choosing a given value of d is a compromise between obtaining low values of S and d. The values d = 2 or d = 3 are usually adopted, because they allow a direct representation. The Shepard diagram compares \u03c6 i j and \u03b4 i j for a given value of d.

Nonetheless, we can take advantage of the MDS computational visualization to trace some similarities between the items represented in the loci. From Figs. 10 and 11 , where time is a parametric variable, we verify that we do not obtain our intuitive feeling of time as a smooth and continuous variable embedded and synchronizing all events. In fact, we see that the time instant for the beginning and end of the trajectories vary considerably from country to country. Therefore, if we adopt a critical view we can interpret that the 1-dimensional time continuum (if exists) is not adequately represented by the two technique combination (i.e., MDS and Procrustes). However, it was already noticed in previous studies [51, 52] , addressing a distinct phenomenon and applying only MDS, that datasets under the influence of social and human factors phenomena exhibit a relativistic behavior and eventually different velocities.

Two approaches were considered for the period from December 31, 2019 up to April 12, 2020. In a first phase, heuristic models were used to fit the time series of the number of infections verified in a set of 79 countries. In a second phase, two metrics were used for comparing the countries data both in the time and frequency domains, and the HC and MDS techniques were adopted for clustering and visualization. The time evolution was also considered for a group of countries exhibiting a more dramatic spread of the COVID-19. The combination of Procrustes and MDS showed that besides the number of infections, the dynamic characteristics play an important role that is not evident in standard representations. In fact, the computational and mathematical modeling lead to the emergence of patterns both highlighting the main clusters and the similarities or dissimilarities between them. Given the potential of the techniques discussed here we can think of their application in several research directions such as the subdivision of data sets according with distinct criteria such as the age, or the geographical origin of the patients. Additionally, analysis considering a large set of influential factors besides merely the casualties can be tried, such as infected people staying in general or in intensive care in hospital, or recovered based on some type of treatment. Therefore, if sufficient and assertive information is collected, then research can follow the aforementioned computational methods to unravel space and time nonlinear dynamics embedded the data.",

The main idea of the MDS is to have points for representing objects in a d-dim space, with d < q, while trying to reproduce the original dissimilarities, \u03b4 i j . Subsequently, the MDS evaluates distinct configurations for optimizing a given fit function. The result of successive numerical iterations is a set of point coordinates (and, therefore, a symmetric matrix \u03a6 = [\u03c6 i j ] of the reproduced dissimilarities) approximating \u03b4 i j .
