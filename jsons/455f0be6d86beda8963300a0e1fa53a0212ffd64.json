As of today, 16 weeks after the onset of epidemic, China's domestic COVID-19 epidemic has been well controlled, and the daily increase of confirmed cases in China mainland dropped to zero for the first time on March 18, 2020 [5] .

Similar to adults, epidemiological history should be confirmed first. It takes one exposure history and two clinical manifestations to diagnosis as suspected case (Table 1 ) [19] . Since most pediatric patients, whose symptoms were nonspecific and mild, connected with cluster outbreaks and these days are in flu season, researchers divided epidemiological history into different risk levels, based on which they establish targeted diagnostic criteria with emphasis on the exclusion of other pathogens that might cause similar symptoms. Therefore, the improvement allows children with high exposure risk to be diagnosed earlier and the range of suspected cases to be more accurately divided (Table 1 ) [11] . In general, positive real-time fluorescence polymerase chain reaction of the patient's respiratory or blood specimen for SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid is needed, but some confirmed cases could get negative results [19, 21] . Furthermore, confirmed cases could be divided into 5 types according to respective clinical manifestations (Table 2 ) [11] . Now that COVID-19-related chest CT abnormalities could be prior to clinical symptoms [18] or could comparatively be more severe with milder symptoms [27] and could appear in patients with negative RT-PCR for COVID-19 [28] , chest CT might have good potential in screening and early diagnosis of COVID-19.
