We create a three-dimensional spherical analogue of a 'Koch Snowflake' using a infinite diminishing hierarchy of touching spheres around the Schwarzschild event horizon. We can create a fractal structure for the horizon with finite volume and infinite (or finite) area. This is a toy model for the possible effects of quantum gravitational spacetime foam, with significant implications for assessments of the entropy of black holes and the universe, which his generally larger than in standard picture of black hole structure and thermodynamics, potentially by very considerable factors. The entropy of the observable universe today becomes S \u2248 10 120(1+\u2206) , where 0 \u2264 \u2206 \u2264 1, with \u2206 = 0 for a smooth spacetime structure and \u2206 = 1 for the most intricate. The Hawking lifetime of black holes is also reduced.",

            "text": "Mathematicians are familiar with constructions like the Koch snowflake [1] in which a two-dimensional self-similar object, constructed iteratively, can possess finite area and infinite perimeter. In three dimensions, the Sierpinski Gasket [2] and the Menger Sponge [3] have a analogous properties, with finite volume and infinite surface area. These features are perfectly consistent with the isoperimetric theorems that relate surface area, A, with enclosed volume, V , for a 3-dimensional body by the inequality A 3 \u2265 36\u03c0V 2 , with equality for the sphere. Since we are being bombarded with animations and pictures of the Covid-19 virus as a sphere with a number of attachments leading off its surface to increase its surface area and provide links to latch on to other cells, we question whether, at the quantum gravitational level, space and black hole surfaces might be like that, with intricate structure down to arbitrarily small scales (or to a cut-off scale of order the Planck length), leading to an increase over the expected surface area. The surface area of a black hole is a key feature that gives its entropy and information content. It obeys a 'second law', or Area Theorem, subject to energy conditions, that requires it to be non-decreasing. Bekenstein [4] and Hawking [5] discovered many of these crucial classical properties whose significance for physics is wider than the study of black holes. Hawking [6] showed that they are not mere coincidences or analogies with thermodynamic laws, as was once thought, but deep consequences of the quantum structure of a black hole: black holes are black bodies.",

The surface area, A g = 4\u03c0R 2 g , of a Schwarzschild black hole determines its entropy, S = A g c 3 /4G \u2248 A g /A pl , where A pl is the Planck area: the entropy is the number of Planck areas in the horizon area. Thus, we see that with intricate horizon structure, if the thermodynamic interpretation of the area still holds as its fundamental thermodynamic basis might suggest, then the entropy of the black hole can be much larger than the standard Schwarzschild value as it is arising in a quantum gravitational extension of general relativity and its usually assumed spacetime structure. Thus we cannot assume that the usual principles for black holes (no hair, entropy bound etc) will hold in unchanged form. The increased value is what we could expect from an Area Theorem, dA/dt \u2265 0, with the increased complexity and information needed to describe the horizon structure, leading to a higher entropy. Likewise, in this context the evaporating quantum black hole with the increased area will lead to more rapid evaporation by Stefan's law. There will be a shorter lifetime before the black hole explodes, since the luminosity is proportional to A g T 4 g , and T g \u221d M \u22121 is the black hole temperature. If the area increases by a scaling A g \u2192 \u03b1A g , via eq. (3), with \u03b1 \u2265 1, then the black hole's Hawking lifetime, t bh , falls as t bh \u221d M 3 /\u03b1 2 as the intricacy, \u03b1, increases.

This will occur for any external intricacy with a Hausdorff dimension exceeding 2. In effect, the 2-dimensional geometrical surface behaves as through it has more than two dimensions and approaches the behaviour of a 3-dimensional surface in the limit of maximum intricacy, showing that it has the information content and intricacy of a geometrical volume 1 . Although we know almost nothing about spacetime structure on scales within a few orders of magnitude of the Planck scale, where we might expect to find these complexities in the geometry, the first suggestions of a spacetime foam structure were suggested by Wheeler [7] as a model of spacetime structure on the Planck scale, see also [8, 9] . On larger scales, this model has become one of three paradigms for observational testing on larger astronomical scales. Recently, the strongest limit have been found using Espresso [10] at the VLT through its effect on images and the profile stability of the FeII metal-line velocity, v,. Under the assumption that the effects are proportional to (E/E pl ) a , where E pl is the Planck energy, the effects on \u2206v/c are proportional to (1 + z) \u22121\u2212a , with 1/2 \u2264 a \u2264 1, where the light source is at redshift z = 2.34, about 5.8Gpc away from us.

Many other authors observe similarities between Brownian and quantum-mechanical motions (see, for example, Nelson [16] and references herein). Similarly, the dimension of the quantum path was also discussed as the dimension of a non-differentiable path in quantum field theories by Kraemmer et al [17] . Later, after the introduction of the fractal terminology by Mandelbrot in 1972 [18] , Abbott and Wise [19] later calculated that the fractal (Hausdorff) dimension of the quantum path in one dimension is 2, i.e. maximal, so with the information content of an area. The reason for this fractal behaviour is fundamental and this is why we expect it to be possible on very small Planck length scales in 3-dimensional space around the rough black hole horizon. The reason for its domination of quantum paths is the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle (HUP). As a particle becomes more localized in a region \u2206r its momentum becomes of order 1/\u2206r and its motion becomes more erratic. Abbott and Wise [19] show that when the step-lengths are much larger than the quantum wavelength of the particle the the Hausdorff dimension, D, approaches 1 but when the step-lengths are smaller than the quantum wavelength D approaches 2, with the information content of a geometric volume, thus showing the fractal character on arbitrary small scales that we have exploited in our simple model above. In between these limiting cases the fractal dimension varies rapidly but exceeds 1. Theories of generalised Hagedorn type with a continuously rising spectrum of mass states of the form g(m) \u221d (m/m 0 ) \u03b2 , for constants m 0 > 0 and \u03b2 > 1, display structure on arbitrarily small scales as the quantum wavelength of the mass states declines when m \u2192 \u221e, [20] , and again such scenarios are well suited to create microscopic fractal structure in combination with quantum random motion.",

However, we have discussed some particular theories for spacetime foam and the non-differentiable character of quantum particle paths, with and without the presence of gravity, to motivate our scenario. The fact that it can rest on such simple general physical principle adds to its plausibility and makes the hypothesis worthy of further exploration. There are many other ways we could have constructed a 'snowflake' structure of the horizon on arbitrarily small scales but we chose the simplest toy model. Using this, we have explored the general effect on the event horizon areas of black holes and inside the cosmological particle horizon. Similar effects can alter the assessment of the 'likelihood' of the whole universe as the black hole entropy formula is often used to assess the gravitational entropy of the universe, by asking for the entropy of the largest black hole that could fit into it [21, 22, 23] , or the number of Planck volumes that will fit inside the particle horizon. We have seen how these black-hole and cosmological entropies can even be infinite if there is no small-scale cut-off to the intricacies. This is often assumed but is not proven. The laboratory analogue studies of black hole horizons might also be able to investigate these changes to the horizon intricacy directly [24, 25] . We also discussed new observational probes of the scale of any spacetime foam structure using its effects on astronomical images and spectral lines. This is a fascinating, albeit very model dependent although now we are only able to probe far larger length scales than we expect fractal effects to make the horizon of a black hole 'fuzzy', they are welcome steps towards closing the link between theory and observation.",
