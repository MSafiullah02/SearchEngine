With principles of social distancing, all face to face classes were suspended due to the ongoing COVID 19 pandemic [2]. Considering its implications on our students, an online teaching session was conducted every day for 12 d. We used a free version of Zoom which allows maximum of 100 participants and for time period of 40 min. Students\u2019 perceptions were collected at the end of this lecture series.",

All of the participants (n = 77) felt that each pediatric sub-specialty should start their classes for postgraduates, and that online classes should be made a part of the medical postgraduate curriculum.",

They felt motivated to read on those topics and it helped them not to think of COVID and sleep peacefully. Most frequent factors hindering learning were stated as limitation on the number of participants, time limitation of the sessions, and technical faults during the conduct of sessions. These shortcomings were addressed subsequently through buying advanced version of the software that allows more time, and better opportunity to interact with students.",

Students\u2019 satisfaction levels with online learning were comparable to the previous studies [3]. Apart from gain in knowledge, the present study revealed the impact of online learning on the morale of our students by creating a diversion from the ongoing pandemic situation. We conclude that online teaching is feasible, cheap and must be made a part of the postgraduate training in India beyond the prevailing lockdown.",
