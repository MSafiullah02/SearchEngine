The viral particles and viral inclusion bodies observed by electron microscopy and light microscopy, respectively, in this study are of a similar size and morphological form to those of the SARS virus and our findings therefore support the association of the SARS coronavirus with the pathogenesis of this disease. Although it is a variant of CV, the SARS virus has the same virological characteristics as CV. It is an RNA virus, the membrane of which contains two types of glycoprotein, E1 and E2, which bind to the receptors of the sensitive cells and enter by endophagocytosis, replicating entirely in the cytoplasm [5] . Recent studies indicate that the cellular receptors for CV (CD 13 ) exist predominantly in mononuclear cells, venular endothelial cells, epithelial cells in the respiratory tract and renal tubules, fibroblasts, brush-border cells of the intestine, stromal cells in the bone marrow, and the synaptic membrane of the central nervous system. We also found that pulmonary alveolar epithelial cells (mainly type 2) and epithelial cells in bronchi proliferated and desquamated, so that desquamative pulmonary alveolitis and bronchitis occurred. Endothelial cells in the systemic venules also desquamated and an inflammatory reaction was present in blood vessel walls (vasculitis). Degenerative changes, apoptosis, and necrosis occurred in parenchymal organs and tissue. We believe that all of these changes most likely result from a complicated process involving (1) disturbed cell metabolism as a result of the release of a large number of viral particles following entry into sensitive cells and rapid replication; (2) intense local vascular reactions; and (3) immune impairment mediated by cellular immunity and cytokine functions [6] . This conclusion requires confirmation through additional research.The main pathological changes involve the lungs. Bilateral extensive consolidation of the lungs results from a combination of the large number of desquamated and exudated cells and protein exudates that congest the lung tissues, and the extensive formation of hyaline membranes in the alveoli. The pathology is essentially that of diffuse alveolar damage with subsequent progression to acute respiratory distress syndrome. From a clinical point of view, the patients exhibit worsening dyspnoea and die of respiratory failure.The pathological changes of SARS can be summarized in terms of the following four aspects: pulmonary lesions; lesions of immune organs; systemic vasculitis; and systemic toxic reactions. The pulmonary lesions mainly involve alveoli and are chiefly composed of desquamative pulmonary alveolitis and bronchitis, for no significant changes in width were observed in most of the alveolar walls or interlobular septa. Other lesions are formation of hyaline membranes, massive exudation of inflammatory cells into alveoli, patchy haemorrhage and focal necrosis, and organization of exudates in the alveoli in patients with a prolonged disease course (A3, 20 days). The main lesions of immune organs are massive necrosis in the spleen and local necrosis in lymph nodes. Systemic vasculitis involves proliferation, swelling, and apoptosis of endothelial cells, with infiltration of monocytes, lymphocytes, and plasma cells both around the circumference of small veins and in vascular walls in the heart, lung, liver, kidney, adrenal gland, and the interstitium of striated muscle. Fibrinoid necrosis and thrombosis occurred in parts of small veins. Systemic toxic changes included degeneration and necrosis of the parenchyma cells in the lung, liver, kidney, heart, and adrenal gland, as well as degeneration of nerve cells in the brain. It is most probable that these systemic reactions are related to viraemia.In conclusion, we consider that SARS is a viral disease that can result in injury to multiple organs, although the predominant pathology involves the lungs.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 84, "end": 87, "text": "[4]", "ref_id": "BIBREF3"}, {"start": 709, "end": 712, "text": "[5]", "ref_id": "BIBREF4"}, {"start": 1843, "end": 1846, "text": "[6]", "ref_id": "BIBREF5"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "annex"}]}
