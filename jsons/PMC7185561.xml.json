            "text": "Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is characterised by fixed airway obstruction associated with abnormal inflammation of the airways that occurs in susceptible subjects exposed to noxious particles or gases, most frequently cigarette smoke. The clinical history of COPD is punctuated by recurrent acute exacerbations \u2014 episodes of acute onset of worsening of the patient's clinical status, characterised by dyspnea, wheeze, cough or sputum production [1]. Besides acute clinical presentation, assessment of the severity of the exacerbation is also based on a patient's medical history before the exacerbation (including severity of airway obstruction), pre-existing co-morbidities, duration and magnitude of symptoms, physical examination and arterial blood gas measurement. Acute exacerbations are a common occurrence in COPD patients and the frequency of exacerbations increases with the severity of the disease [2, 3, 4]. In addition to being the major cause of COPD-associated morbidity and mortality, exacerbations contribute to impaired health status, loss of lung function [3, 5, 6], and thus to disease progression. It has been estimated that acute exacerbations are also the cause of \u223c70% of health-care costs associated with COPD [7].",

Recently, it has been documented that COPD patients with repeated presence of respiratory syncytial virus in sputum over two years had faster lung function decline over time [17\u2022\u2022]. Taken together, these data indicate that, in response to repeated/latent viral infections, an excessive recruitment of CD8+ T lymphocytes might occur in the tracheo-bronchial tree. This CD8+-driven inflammation can damage the lung in susceptible smokers, leading to COPD progression [18]. The use of highly sensitivity diagnostic methods such as PCR for viral detection in biological samples has shown that the proportion of virus-induced COPD exacerbations is likely to be \u2265 40% in an outpatient setting [19\u2022] and \u2265 50% in hospitalised patients [20, 21\u2022\u2022], with rhinoviruses being the most frequently identified virus type.",

Infectious exacerbations led to longer hospitalisations and greater impairments of several measures of lung function than did non-infectious exacerbations. Importantly, exacerbations with co-infection resulted in more marked lung function impairment and longer hospitalisations. Similarly, in an outpatient setting of COPD exacerbations, a greater decline in lung function was documented in those patients in which both bacterial infection and cold symptoms were present simultaneously [19\u2022].",

Few studies have analysed bronchial biopsies at exacerbations because of the difficulties associated with performing an invasive procedure in acutely ill patients. Two studies using bronchial biopsies during exacerbations of chronic bronchitis from a single cohort of patients reported prominent airway eosinophilia, together with increased numbers of neutrophils and T lymphocytes, in the exacerbated group when compared with stable patients [28, 29]. Another recent study showed increased number of neutrophils in sputum during exacerbations; this increase was independent of the pathogen detected. The same study documented that virus-induced COPD exacerbations, with or without concomitant bacterial infection, are associated with increased numbers of eosinophils in sputum, suggesting that sputum eosinophilia could be a marker of viral infection during COPD exacerbations [21\u2022\u2022].",

A recent study documented that patients with frequent COPD exacerbations have more frequent episodes of naturally occurring colds when compared with patients with infrequent exacerbations [30\u2022]. These results suggest that COPD subjects with frequent exacerbations represent a subgroup particularly susceptible to viral infections. Thus, although there is solid evidence of impaired innate [31\u2022\u2022, 32\u2022\u2022] and (possibly) acquired [33, 34] immune responses to viral infection in asthmatic patients, it is not yet clear whether COPD patients have increased susceptibility to viral infections. Intriguingly, patients experiencing frequent colds had a significantly higher exposure to cigarette smoke [30\u2022]. Using a mouse model of cigarette smoke exposure, it has been recently demonstrated that cigarette smoke increases susceptibility to viral infections, possibly via alteration and/or inhibition of immune responses [35]. Therefore, we could speculate that cigarette smoke exposure, which is the most important risk factor for the development of COPD, might cause impaired immune response to viral infections in COPD patients.",

Solid evidence shows that patients with COPD are chronically colonized with airway bacteria, and the bacterial load is related to airway inflammation and disease progression [36]. It has been postulated that bacterial colonisation contributes to increased susceptibility to viral infection in COPD patients, for example, by increasing ICAM-1 expression in bronchial epithelial cells, either directly or through induced inflammation [37\u2022\u2022].",

One way to overcome these obstacles is the development of a human experimental model that would allow studies to take place under controlled conditions.

This involves a number of modalities of treatment including pharmacological therapies, oxygen therapy and, when indicated, mechanical ventilation. Inhaled bronchodilators and systemic corticosteroids have been shown to be beneficial during acute exacerbation of COPD [45, 46]. Conversely, the role and effectiveness of antibiotics in acute exacerbations of COPD are still debated. A recent meta-analysis supported the use of antibiotics in COPD exacerbation for those patients moderate-to-severely ill with increased cough and sputum purulence. Analysis restricted to community-based studies did not find any differences between antibiotic and placebo [47]. However, surveys of antibiotic prescribing in COPD exacerbations in clinical practice indicate that they are used in the majority of exacerbations, both in the community and in hospital practice. Thus, a large number of patients are probably receiving inappropriate antibiotic therapy, with the associated increase in cost and risk of antibiotic resistance. Therefore, there is an urgent need to develop simple clinical or biological markers to identify those patients at highest risk of bacterial infection, as well as those who will benefit most from antibiotic therapy.",

Thus, further studies are needed to elucidate the mechanisms that lead viral infections to trigger COPD exacerbations and thus to identify key inflammatory mediators and/or immunological pathways for the development of novel drugs able to treat and prevent acute episodes of COPD. Indeed, so far, anti-viral therapy has focused mainly on vaccination as the optimal prevention strategy, and subsequently the development of antiviral agents has lagged behind that of anti-bacterial chemotherapy. Vaccination might not be a realistic option for the treatment of respiratory viral infections in view of the variety of different viruses that cause similar clinical syndromes. Development of a vaccine for rhinoviruses is especially problematic because of the large number (>100) of different serotypes. The recognition that rhinoviruses are associated with more severe clinical syndromes than just upper respiratory tract infections has stimulated research into anti-rhinoviral agents. A number of anti-rhinoviral drugs are in development but, to date, no agent has been approved for the treatment of rhinovirus infections [48]. A specific strategy able to interfere with the pathogenesis of virus-induced exacerbations is the real future challenge.",

Thanks to the use of novel and highly sensitive diagnostic tools, the role of respiratory viruses in COPD exacerbations has emerged during the past few years. Nevertheless, the mechanisms that lead to COPD exacerbations after respiratory virus infections are still largely unknown. The recent development of the first human model of virus-induced COPD exacerbation [41\u2022\u2022], which has been demonstrated to be feasible and (so far) safe, should facilitate identification of novel pharmacological targets that will provide opportunities to develop new treatments for exacerbations of COPD.",
