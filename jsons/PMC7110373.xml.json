            "text": "Porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV) is an enveloped RNA virus in the family Arteriviridae that is responsible for considerable financial losses caused by respiratory and reproductive disease in pigs (Benfield et al., 1992). In growing pigs, PRRSV causes an interstitial pneumonia (Collins et al., 1992) resulting in fever, lethargy, and respiratory distress. Respiratory disease has been experimentally reproduced through intranasal challenge with high-virulence, low-passage PRRSV (Halbur et al., 1995). The PRRSV preferentially infects resident macrophages of various tissues, including pulmonary alveolar macrophages. Varying levels of disease induced by a single strain of PRRSV between pigs of the same population have been observed in naturally and experimentally infected animals (Halbur et al., 1998) as well as in macrophages infected in vitro (Voicu et al., 1994; Molitor et al., 1996). Halbur et al. (1998) investigated differences between purebred pigs, but reports of studies with commercial crossbred lines were not found. If evidence of genetic control of susceptibility to PRRSV could be identified, the potential for selection of pigs that have increased resistance to this important disease could be considered (Stear et al., 2001; van der Waaij et al., 2002).",

Each pig was treated daily by i.m. injection with lincomycin hydrochloride (Lincocin, Pharmacia & Upjohn, Kalamazoo, MI) and ceftiofur hydrochloride (Excenel, Pharmacia & Upjohn) for 3 d after arrival. The initial replicate contained 30 animals per line in the challenge group, and pigs with the same sire were sorted randomly into 6 pens of 10 pigs each. The later three replicates contained 24 animals per line in the challenge group, and pigs with the same sire were sorted randomly into 6 pens of 8 pigs each. Additional animals (n = 60) used as experimental negative controls were housed in a separate isolation facility during each respective replicate. Pigs were infected intranasally at approximately 6 wk of age (0 d after infection) and subsequently necropsied on d 10 or 21 after infection.

Briefly, in each of the replicates, blood was collected from 4- to 6-wk-old pigs by venipuncture into heparinized tubes and processed the same day. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) were isolated from the blood, and the adherent monocytes were transformed into macrophages using an established protocol (Genovesi et al., 1989; Thacker et al., 1998). After 24 h, PRRSV (VR-2385) was added to the media at a multiplicity of infection of one and was allowed to incubate for another 24 h. Negative controls containing noninfected MDM were included for each pig to standardize the FACS analysis. The MDM were labeled using an antibody (74-22-15A, IgG2b isotype, VMRD, Pullman, WA) that recognizes monocytes and macrophages followed with a goat anti-mouse IgG (whole molecule) conjugated with R-phycoerythrin (Southern Biotechnology Associates, Inc., Birmingham, AL). The cells were fixed with 4% formaldehyde and then permeabilized with FACS buffer plus 0.1% saponin (FACS-saponin buffer). The intracellular nucleocapsid protein of PRRSV was labeled with the monoclonal antibody SDOW-17 (IgG1 isotype, Rural Technologies, Brookings, SD) followed with a goat anti-mouse IgG1 conjugated with fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC; Southern Biotechnology Associates) in FACS-saponin buffer. The percentage of R-phycoerythrin-positive MDM that were dual-labeled with FITC, representing the PRRSV-infected macrophage population, was identified by flow cytometry based on 10,000 events.",

Each RNA sample was eluted in 60 \u03bcL of the provided elutant. To analyze viral RNA levels, QC-RT-PCR were run in triplicate for each test serum and BAL sample with 3 different concentrations of the 405 nucleotide competitor as described previously (Vincent and Thacker, 2001). Before running each set of samples, the range of competitor was established by testing a random selection of samples against a range of competitor concentrations from 106 to 1010 copy numbers per microliter. The reactions were run on 2.5% agarose gels for approximately 1 h. The gels were stained with ethidium bromide, and the band intensities were analyzed using the digital imaging system GeneSnap (Spectronics, Westbury, NY) linked with the gel analysis software GeneTools. The intensity ratio of the competitor (C) to unknown target (T) multiplied by the ratio of sizes between the sample target and competitor (C/T/0.835) was plotted against competitor copy number on a double-log scale, and the unknown viral copy number was calculated as the point where the log of the ratio of competitor to unknown was zero (Piatak et al., 1993).",

            "text": "Previous work in our laboratory using an in vitro FACS assay demonstrated significant differences in the susceptibility of MDM to PRRSV in culture between commercial pig lines (Vincent et al., 2005). The purpose of this investigation was to determine whether the differences demonstrated in vitro between the FACShi and FACSlo lines were correlated with disease traits in vivo. Significant differences between the lines were found for five variables related to disease severity during the acute period, including respiratory score sum, number of febrile days, virus levels in serum, and macroscopic and microscopic lung scores. Of these traits, the 10 d after infection respiratory score sum, number of febrile days, virus levels in serum, and macroscopic lung score were significantly, but negatively, correlated with the in vitro MDM-FACS assay. The FACSlo line was consistently more susceptible to PRRSV in the early time points, although clinically the differences were small. Interestingly, at 21 d after infection, the relationship reversed, and the FACSlo line had less viremia as measured by a tissue culture titration method and viral RNA copy number in the serum as quantified by QC-RT-PCR. It also seems that the differences in the line means were increasing at 21 d after infection. Because PRRSV has been well documented to establish chronic, long-term infections in a large percentage of pigs (Horter et al., 2002; Wills et al., 2003), the results at 21 d after infection may be indicative of a host genetic component in the length of viremia, although later time points would be required to support this. The existence of chronically infected animals in farms attempting to control or eradicate PRRSV is currently a critical issue in the swine industry. A significant difference between the two lines also was demonstrated for 21 d after infection for microscopic lung score; the FACSlo line had a slightly greater interstitial pneumonia score. The increased pneumonia score at this latter time point may be attributed to the severity of the lesions during the acute stage of the disease, although the relationship between microscopic pneumonia score at 10 and 21 d after infection is unknown at this point.",

In another study, additive genetic variation in susceptibility to respiratory diseases was detected in pigs from Yorkshire, Duroc, Landrace, and Hampshire breeds; Yorkshire and Duroc breeds showed an increase in general resistance to clinical and subclinical respiratory disease (Henryon et al., 2001). However, the characterization of the respiratory disease and inciting pathogen were not individually evaluated. The limited reports in the literature on genetic susceptibility to PRRSV have investigated differences between purebred lines, and no evidence has been presented for differences in commercial crossbred lines used as breeding stock in a large number of swine operations around the world.

Because the macrophage is a potent effector cell of the immune response, it is not clear what proportion of the infected macrophages in vivo would support propagation of virus and/or stimulate an immune response through autocrine or paracrine activation. Studies investigating the pathways for PRRSV infection have shown that virus attachment occurred in nearly all alveolar macrophages cultured with virus within 60 min; however, viral replication only seemed to occur in 30% of the cells (Nauwynck et al., 1999). In addition, PRRSV has been shown to induce apoptosis primarily in uninfected bystander macrophages in vivo and in vitro (Sirinarumitr et al., 1998; Labarque et al., 2003), which may be a protective mechanism by the host to prevent subsequent infection of incoming monocytes by infected resident macrophages. Porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus has been shown to use sialoadhesin present on the surface of macrophages for virus entry through clathrin-mediated endocytosis. However, the transfection of the sialoadhesin gene into a nonmacrophage cell type alone was insufficient to support uncoating and replication in the transfected cells (Vanderheijden et al., 2003), indicating additional steps in the infectious pathway. All of these factors suggest that host resistance to PRRSV is complex, and a more complete understanding of the molecular pathogenesis of PRRSV may reveal the biological basis for the relationship between the in vitro assay and the disease traits.",

It should be noted that this relationship was investigated for one time point in vitro at 24 h after infection. This time point was chosen because of the limited number of MDM available when produced from peripheral monocytes and the PRRSV-induced apoptosis that occurs within 24 h after infection in culture (Sirinarumitr et al., 1998). This was balanced with the demonstration of peak infection levels of MDM by flow cytometry between 24 and 48 h after infection (Thacker et al., 1998). The difference in the susceptibility in the macrophages between the 2 lines at this early time point may indicate a difference in viral attachment, entry, or early stages of replication without time for many host response systems to be activated. The differences also may be related to differences in the activation and/or maturation of the MDM while in culture because it has been demonstrated that different activation and differentiation stages of macrophages affect their susceptibility to PRRSV (Duan et al., 1997). If this plays a role in the in vivo susceptibility of the host, a possible explanation for the switch in advantage in virus levels in the serum between the lines at the 10 and 21 d after infection time points is that inherent differences in macrophages in their susceptibility to PRRSV infection and their ability to respond to activation may provide some benefit early on in infection. However, as more macrophages are recruited to the lung, the virus is able to persist in the newly recruited susceptible population of macrophages. Much work remains to provide direct evidence for this hypothesis.",

This variation is most likely due to the inherent inconsistencies that are characteristic of biologic assays and the limited number of commercially available reagents necessary to characterize fully the phenotype of the porcine macrophages in culture. To remove assay-to-assay variation, it would be beneficial to incorporate an index macrophage cell line to control for changes in culture conditions and infectivity of the virus. To date, however, continuous macrophage lines have not been shown to support PRRSV infection (Weingartl et al., 2002), and the mechanism of infection for the permissive MARC-145 cells has been shown to be quite different than that of macrophages (Nauwynck et al., 1999). This suggests it also would not be a suitable index cell line for the PRRSV FACS assay. It also is important to note that each replicate had a different composite of sires to increase the representation of the genetic pool within the two lines. Although there was not a clear sire effect identified in the statistical analyses, this might have contributed to the variation noted among replicates in the magnitude of responses, both in vitro and in vivo.",

The health status of the animals used in this study changed over time between replicates, but no other alternative animals could be used because of the requirements of specific genetic lines and PRRSV-free status. Study animals from both lines tested positive for Bordetella bronchiseptica, Pasteurella multocida, Mycoplasma hyorhinis, and porcine respiratory coronavirus. Lesions indicative of Mycoplasma hyopneumoniae and cytomegalovirus also were present, but the organisms were not isolated. The presence of these organisms is unlikely to have interfered significantly with the health status and thereby the differences between the lines following PRRSV challenge because the 2 lines originated from the same source farm and were mixed as pen-mates in the same isolation room. The negative control animals in each of the replicates exhibited no respiratory disease caused by these other organisms. The health status of the challenge groups was relatively consistent, and the presence of other organisms may represent a PRRSV challenge more typical of field cases.",

Highly virulent strains of PRRSV can cause extreme losses because of decreased reproductive performance in adult animals and impaired growth and increased mortality in growing animals. In addition, PRRSV has been demonstrated to have an immunomodulatory effect through decreased vaccine efficacy to M. hyopneumoniae (Thacker et al., 2000) and swine influenza virus (Thacker et al., 2003). Accordingly, low virulence strains also may cause economic losses because of impaired immune responses to concurrent or subsequent infections.",

            "text": "The results reported here and elsewhere suggest that selection of pigs that have increased resistance to this economically important disease should be considered. Genetic improvements in PRRSV resistance could be further advanced by identification of genes or genetic markers correlated with resistance. Monoclonal antibodies have been used to identify and characterize the porcine sialoadhesin molecule as a receptor for PRRSV entry into tissue macrophages (Vanderheijden et al., 2003). Although transfection of the sialoadhesin gene alone was not sufficient for viral replication, the characterization of this gene may lead to potential sources of genetic variation in susceptibility to PRRSV. Immune responses through regulation of cell surface molecules, including major histocompatibility complex and cytokine receptors, production of cytokines and chemokines, and production of a neutralizing antibody are other potential mechanisms in which genetic selection could be used to improve the health status of swine (Warner et al., 1987; Gogolin-Ewens et al., 1990; Edfors-Lilja et al., 1998). Alternatively, the existence of lines with large differences in susceptibility may allow for development of line crosses that would facilitate genomic scans to identify chromosomal regions associated with resistance to PRRSV. If chromosomal regions can be identified for PRRSV susceptibility, development of genetic markers to aid in the selection of animals with increased resistance may be feasible (Stear et al., 2001; van der Waaij et al., 2002).",

Measures to control this pathogen have been largely unsuccessful, making selection of pigs with increased resistance highly attractive. This study evaluated two lines from a commercial breeding herd selected for study based on an in vitro screening assay. Differences were noted between the lines during the acute phase of the respiratory form of the disease, although the differences for many of the traits were small. At 21 d after infection, difference was observed in serum virus levels; however, the line with the advantage during the acute period had greater virus levels at the later time point, indicating that the interaction between host and virus is quite complex. Genetic variation in susceptibility to the virus seems to exist in crossbred commercial pig populations, and further study is warranted to investigate selection strategies to increase resistance to this important pathogen.",
