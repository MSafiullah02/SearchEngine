The anastomosis was reinforced with BioGlue (CryoLife, Inc, Kennesaw, GA), and the graft was tunneled out through a separate stab incision more distal in the thigh. A 20-Fr arterial cannula was placed through the graft and secured with multiple ligatures. Using fluoroscopy, a 25-Fr venous cannula was inserted through the right femoral vein and successfully passed into the right atrium. Heparin anticoagulation was initiated, and an activated coagulation time of 180-to-220 seconds was maintained. Antibiotics also were commenced for possibility of sepsis and vasodilatory shock.

Management of the patient using ECMO preoperatively presented a safer option than did emergency surgery and potential postoperative ECMO, which would submit the patient to possible further complications, including rethrombosis of the new prosthesis. Thrombolytic therapy was not considered due to coagulopathy in the setting of liver dysfunction.
