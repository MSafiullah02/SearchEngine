An increase in sympathetic stimulation, which is responsible for triggering such arrhythmias, is often resistant to antiarrhythmic treatment. Modulation of the cardiac autonomic nervous system is now being used frequently in the treatment of channelopathy. Cardiac sympathetic denervation (CSD) is carried out via surgical excision or pharmacological inhibition of the extrinsic thoracic sympathetic chain (SC). For this reason, left CSD (LCSD) has been shown to decrease the number of sudden deaths and events in cases of CPVT and LQTS [1].",

Implantable cardioverter-defibrillators (ICDs) were implanted in 26 LQTS patients and 17 CPVT patients according to the HRS/EHRA/APHRS expert consensus [3]. The research team agreed that LCSD would be indicated in patients who had an intolerance for medical treatment, who continued to experience ICD shocks despite optimal care, who refused to be implanted with an ICD, and in those with CPVT in whom a primary prevention operation was indicated due to a family history of cardiac arrest. LCSD is accepted as the standard surgical procedure for denervation in patients with CPVT and LQTS [1]; thus, we performed LCSD in the first two patients who were referred from the arrythmia clinic. One patient with CPVT and one with LQTS underwent LCSD; however, both patients were admitted to the pediatric clinic after six months due to recurrent events. After this clinical experience, we decided to perform BCSD initially in patients with channelopathy. Patients who underwent LCSD followed by right CSD (RCSD) due to recurrence were excluded from the research. This study was granted approval by our hospital's Ethical Committee (2018/63). Informed consent was obtained from patients' families as needed.",

All patients were intubated with a single-lumen endotracheal tube, and an external defibrillator pad was attached to the posterior and anterior regions of the thorax. Their ICD devices were then switched off. After all required coverings were carried out, the head of the operating table was tilted up by 45\u00b0 and rotated 30\u00b0 away from the side on which the operation was due to be performed. Operations were carried out on patients' left sides first. The fourth intercostal space (ICS) was opened into the first port middle axillary line, and CO2 insufflation commenced. A camera was used to visualize the scene, while the second port was placed into an anterior axillary line through the third ICS. A minimally invasive two-port VATS procedure was performed. Then, CO2 insufflation was adjusted to a pressure of 6 mmHg. In several patients, it was impossible to achieve sufficient exposure at this pressure, so insufflation was increased up to 8\u201310 mmHg. When this failed to result in sufficient exposure, the third port was placed at the fifth ICS through the anterior axillary line to retract the lung. Electrocautery was used to separate T2\u20134 ganglions, beginning from the SC T1 distal rami communicans (Kuntz nerves) and spinal nerves (Fig. 1\n). Kuntz nerves were cauterized to 1 cm from the medial and at least 2 cm from the lateral. Subsequently, T2, T3, and T4 ganglions were totally cauterized to execute sympathetic denervation. The location of the port was sutured once CO2 was totally discharged from the thorax cavity. Rarely, the discharge of air persisted in some patients, so a thoracic drain was inserted. The thoracic drain tube was connected to an underwater drainage system. The same surgical procedures were repeated after passing to the contralateral side. The ICD device was restarted after the operation during a weaning period, and patients were taken to the intensive care unit. Patients were continuously monitored for 24 h.",
