            "text": "A comprehensive review of the history and role of intestinal microflora is given in the version of this chapter presented in the previous edition of this volume (Cebra et al., 1999). The pioneering studies concerned whether the presence of bacteria in the intestine was essential for the life of the host (see Leidy, 1849). The general approaches involved either deriving mammals with a sterile intestinal tract (axenic or \u201cgerm-free\u201d [GF]), which could then be deliberately colonized with known members of the intestinal microbiota (gnotobiotic mammals), or analyzing newborns, born essentially GF, as they developed and naturally acquired a \u201cnormal\u201d microbiota. Early on, changes in the systemic immune system were monitored, since the somewhat separate mucosal immune system had not yet been properly defined and appreciated. The early pioneers in GF/gnotobiotic studies of mammals included Glimstedt (1932) and Gustafsson (1948) in Sweden, Reyniers (1932), Pleasants, Wostmann, and Pollard at the Lobund Institute, in the United States (see Carter and Pollard, 1971); Miyakawa et al. (1958) in Japan; and Sterzl, Mandel et al. (1960) in Czechoslovakia. Pleasants, Wostmann, and their coworkers further minimized microbial and food antigen stimulation of mice by developing \u201cantigen-free\u201d (AF) mice fed a chemically defined (CD) diet of water-soluble, low-molecular-weight nutrients plus soy oil containing vitamins (Pleasants et al., 1986). From earlier times (van der Waaij, 1969) up to the present (Fagarasan et al., 2002), investigators have sought to simplify the elimination of gut microbes and circumvent the intricate, complex, and expensive procedures used to derive and maintain GF or AF rodents by decontaminating them with \u201ccocktails\u201d of orally administered antibiotics. Usually, the \u201cphysiologically normal\u201d state of hypertrophy and inflammation of the lymphoid system is somewhat reversed but there is little information of the effects on the developmental status and functional activity of particular elements of the immune system. However, the many analyses of the effects of intestinal colonization with microbes of GF or AF mice and of natural colonization of neonates on the systemic immune system can be generalized as follows (see Cebra et al., 1999, for a more detailed account).",

            "text": "GF neonates, especially colostrum-deprived piglets, show a profound hypotrophy of PLN and spleen and a marked diminution of peripheral lymphoid cells reactive versus mitogens or polyclonal stimuli (Tlaskalova et al., 1970; Tlaskalova and Stepankova, 1980; Kim, 1979). The hypotrophy persists into adulthood for both GF and especially AF mice, although the latter do show nearly normal numbers of splenic marginal zone and peritoneal cavity (PeC) B cells relative to their CNV counterparts (Bos et al., 2003). The GF neonates also respond poorly to deliberate Ag stimulation (Tlaskalova and Stepankova, 1980; Kim, 1979; Tlaskalova et al., 1994). The neonatal hyporesponsiveness of GF and even CNV mammals, especially versus microbial polysaccharide Ags, has often been attributed to immaturity of B cells and the time lag in transition of recently arrived B cells in the periphery (\u201cvirgin B cells\u201d) to B cells positively responsive to cross-linking of BCRs (primary B cells). It has long been proposed that gut microbial stimulation, especially via LPS, can drive this process. Recently, Monroe and his students have shown a delay in the development of competence of neonatal B cells (until 18\u201323 days of life), to respond to in vitro cross-linking of their BCRs with F(ab')2 anti-mouse IgM (Monroe et al., 1993; Yellin-Shaw and Monroe, 1992). Neonatal and adult peripheral B cells are about equally responsive to mitogenic stimulation with LPS. Finally, this group further found that addition of LPS to cultures of neonatal B cells unresponsive to the presence of F(ab')2 anti-IgM markedly enhanced their reactivity (Wechsler-Reya and Monroe, 1996). Thus, microbial products such as LPS may naturally enhance specific B cell responsiveness to cross-linking of their BCRs in vivo during neonatal development via microbial colonization of the gut.",

About 30,000 SF occur in the human intestine, and about 10\u201320 SF occur in the murine small intestine, as just recently described (Brandtzaeg and Farstad, 1999; Hamada et al., 2002). These organized lymphoid structures are composed conspicuously or mainly of spherical B lymphoid follicles, including chronically present B lymphoblasts embedded in a meshwork of follicular dendritic cells (DC). Both GALT and palatine tonsillar B cell follicles are secondary and display chronic germinal center reactions (GCR) (Weinstein et al., 1991; Liu et al., 1991). The predominant non-IgM isotype expressed on GC B blasts in the PP and SF of most mammalian species is IgA; B blasts in human tonsillar GC mainly express IgG isotypes (Lebman et al., 1987; Pascuel et al., 1994). Both these tissues normally contain relatively large numbers of IgA (Peyer's patches) or IgG (tonsils) \u201cmemory\u201d B cells. Thus, the B cell follicles of these mucosal tissues differ from those of spleen and lymph node, which are ordinarily quiescent and \u201cprimary,\u201d displaying no GCR with dividing B blasts and being composed of IgM/IgD-positive primary B cells. The B cell follicles of PP, SF, and also murine NALT contain microfold (M) cells, scattered through their follicle-associated epithelium (FAE). These M cells act as \u201cefferent lymphatics,\u201d transporting samples of foreign antigen from the gut lumen or airways into the organized lymphoid tissue (Weltzin et al., 1989; Hamada et al., 2002; Zuercher and Cebra, 2002; Zuercher et al., 2002). Although the SF of mice share many characteristics of PP and differ from \u201ccryptopatches\u201d (see Kanamori et al., 1996), they appear to also contain some of the cells characteristic of cryptopatches, especially the c-kit+, IL-7R+, Thy1+ cells involved in lymphopoiesis of some gut T cells (Hamada et al., 2002).",

A half-life of 4.7 days, under normal conditions of gut colonization of neonates with microbes, was found. However, given the influence of suckled maternal antibodies on forestalling gut colonization with some bacteria and the consequent delay in expressing the normal steady-state of IgA production in the gut until after weaning (days 22\u201324) (Jiang et al., 2001), these periweaning estimations should be revisited in adult mice. We believe this reanalysis is especially important in view of the identification of long-lived plasma cells, functional in systemic antibody production (Slifka et al., 1998; O'Connor et al., 2002), and the long-term persistence of LP IgA-forming cells after the disappearance of PP GCR provoked by gut colonization with microbes (Shroff et al., 1995) or the elimination of a gut-colonizing microbe by a shift from conventional to chemically defined diet (see below).",

This \u201choming\u201d is initially accidental via the recirculation in blood but leads to selective lodging in mucosal tissue based mainly on lymphocyte expression of \u03b14\u03b27 integrin (the so-called homing receptor) and its ligand on vessel endothelial cells in mucosal tissue, mucosal vascular addressin (MAdCAM-1) (Nakache et al., 1989; Williams and Butcher, 1997; Butcher et al., 1999). At least IgA blasts then respond to the chemokine TECK (thymus-expressing chemokine), or CCL25 as it is presently named, a chemotactic factor made by gut epithelial cells. Thus, after \u201cdocking\u201d via an \u03b14/\u03b27-MadCAM-dependent process, the IgA blasts are motivated directionally by a CCL25 gradient (Bowman et al., 2002). A further factor in selective lodging of these cells in gut LP, leading to eventual local IgA production by IgM\u2212, IgA+ or IgM+, IgA\u2212 (already expressing I-C\u03b1 transcripts) B cells, is their responsiveness to IL-15 to promote IgA expression (Hiroi et al., 2000). This particular responsiveness, which involves upregulation of IL-15R expression, is especially attributed to B-1 cells. The distinction between B-1 and B-2 cells in the gut LP is based on level of B220 (CD45R) expression. However, in the gut B220 expression may be more of a developmental marker rather than a B-subset marker. This matter may be resolved by distinguishing SF cells from bona fide LP cells. At any rate, IL-15 is also a product of gut epithelial cells (Reinecker et al., 1996), like CCL25, and it remains to be determined whether gut microbial colonization induces the expression of either of these factors, since AF mice show negligible numbers of either B-1- or B-2-derived IgA plasmablasts in their gut LP (Bos et al., 2003). A final likely candidate for facilitating the accumulation of IgA blasts in gut LP, pIgR, seems not to fulfill this function, as shown in pIgR (\u2013/\u2013) mice (Uren et al., 2003).",

IELs are supposed to lodge between epithelial cells (EC) via their surface \u03b1E\u03b27 integrin, reactive with the E-cadherin on the EC (Cepek et al., 1994). Of particular interest as mediators of innate immunity are NK and NK-T cells. The former NK cells from IEL spaces are in a more activated state (based on killer-target ratios to achieve a given level of cytotoxicity) and target cell range than are NK cells from spleen or lymph nodes. It is interesting that the NK cells of the IEL spaces of CNV severe combined immunodeficient (scid) mice are more numerous and in a higher state of activation than those corresponding cells from CNV immunocompetent (imcomp) mice (these observations are shown in Figs. 18.1\nand 18.2\n). The CD8+ T cells of the IEL spaces, unlike those from spleen and lymph nodes, display a much higher level of \u201cconstitutive\u201d cytotoxicity without deliberate in vitro or in vivo activation (Lefrancois and Goodman, 1989). These findings are based on an assay, redirected cytotoxicity, which depends on coupling of putative cytotoxic T cells with target cells via antibody versus T-cell receptor (TCR) that also reacts with Fc\u03b3 receptors on target cells (Leo et al., 1986). The abundance of \u201cactivated\u201d NK and CD8+ T cells in the gut relative to those in spleen or lymph nodes suggests a chronic stimulation, likely by food and microbial Ags, and this matter will be considered below.",

In the last decade, we have appreciated that major elements of the gut flora of mice and of many other animals were obligate anaerobes that have not yet been cultured in vitro (Tannock et al., 1987). Indeed, Joseph Leidy (1849) described a dominant gut morphotype, segmented filamentous bacteria (SFB), which he found in the midgut of termites. This SFB was tentatively named Arthromitis (jointed thread), and similar morphotypes have been found in the chicken, rat, mouse, pig, and trout (Snel et al, 1995; Meyerholz et al., 2003; Yamauchi and Snel, 2000; Urdaci et al., 2001). The vertebrate versions of this morphotype are gram-positive, segmented, obligate anaerobes that are spore formers (Davis and Savage, 1974). Savage and coworkers recognized SFB as a major component of the gut microbiota of mice and were able to enrich for these noncultivatable bacteria by isolating intestinal epithelial cells, to which the 5- to 20-\u03bcm SFB attached firmly via a holdfast segment that interdigitated with but did not penetrate the brush border (Davis and Savage, 1974; Tannock et al., 1987). The SFB of mice has recently been isolated by the Nijmegen group, using treatment of fecal material with organic solvents to kill vegetative organisms, followed by limiting dilution to colonize formerly GF mice (Klaasen et al., 1991). The latter limiting dilution was made possible by the finding that the vast majority of spore-forming, obligate anaerobes in postweanling to young adult mice were SFB. Snel et al. (1995) have used sequencing of 16S RNA to position the SFB of mice, rat, and chicken as a closely related group within the larger cluster of Clostridium species. Their relationship with Leidy's Arthromitis is still not clear.",

            "text": "Perhaps of greater relevance, the Nijmegen group has found that monoassociation of formerly GF mice with spores of this single gut commensal, SFB, provides a profound stimulus for the development of IgA ASC in the gut LP (Klaasen et al., 1993). The magnitude of the response suggests that it is polyclonal, composed of much \u201cnatural\u201d IgA; however, the rapid but delayed rise to preeminence of SFB attached to epithelial cells of the small intestine between 4 and 12 weeks of age, followed by exclusion of SFB to the cecum and large bowel (mostly unattached), suggests a specific component of the host's response (Snel et al., 1998). Indeed, we find that formerly GF scid mice, monoassociated with SFB, do not clear SFB from their small intestine for up to 1 year. We have collaborated with the Nijmegen group to evaluate SFB-specific versus polyclonal (\u201cnatural\u201d) IgA plasmablast development driven by gut association of formerly GF mice with SFB and to quantitate how effective this stimulus was compared with \u201cnormal\u201d expression of IgA by CNV mice with a \u201ccomplete\u201d microbiota (Snel et al., 1998; Talham et al., 1999). Our findings were that GC reactions occurred in Peyer's patches by 14 to 21 days postinfection, and these gradually waned over about 100 days of colonization; \u201cnatural\u201d IgA production by GALT fragment culture followed GC reactions in PP and reached levels of 70% of that found from GALT of CNV mice; and specific anti-SFB IgA antibodies did develop over 7 to 12 weeks, but these never exceeded 0.5% to 1.0% of the total \u201cnatural\u201d IgA output. Thus, it appears that SFB may be a major stimulus for the development of the \u201cnatural\u201d IgA system. We do not yet know how the host's specific immune response to SFB effects its disappearance from the small gut; the bacteria do take on a coat of endogenous IgA (see following section). However, the level of \u201cnatural\u201d IgA remains rather constant for up to 100 days of colonization as GC reactions subside. Thus, mechanisms for maintenance of IgA plasmablasts in gut LP should be investigated. One mechanism that may account for the maintenance of IgA plasmablasts for over 100 days is bacterial DNA\u2013mediated survival. Unmethylated CpG dinucleotide motifs in bacterial DNA seem to rescue splenic B cells from apoptosis (Yi et al., 1998; Yi et al., 1999).",

(1978) to include seven innocuous enteric organisms as monoassociates of formerly GF mice as well as the eight commensal microbes in the altered Schaedler's flora (ASF) (Dewhirst et al., 1999). We compared their ability to stimulate the expression of \u201cnatural\u201d IgA in the gut as well as specific antibodies reactive with sonicates of the organisms. Although there may be only a \u201cthin line\u201d between gut commensal and pathogen (Gilmore and Ferretti, 2003), we defined an enteric species as innocuous if it caused no detectable pathogenesis after monoassociating formerly GF scid mice and did not interfere with normal breeding. We used organ fragment cultures of various sections of gut and of PP to evaluate total and specific IgA production (Logan et al., 1991; Weinstein and Cebra, 1991). Table 18.1 shows that each particular enteric microbe induced a particular level and ratio of \u201cnatural\u201d and specific IgA production in the gut. Some organisms (Morganella morganii, Listeria monocytogenes mutant) resulted in a relatively high proportion of specific antibody while others did not (H. muridarum, SFB). In agreement with Moreau et al. (1978), a cocktail of gut commensals (the eight members of ASF) stimulated nearly normal levels of total IgA production, as did the single microbial colonizer, SFB.",

So too are the B cell follicles of PPs in GF or AF mice (Weinstein and Cebra, 1991; Bos et al., 2003). Gut colonization of GF or AF mice leads to the development of chronic GCR in the core of B cell follicles of PP, composed of rapidly dividing B cell blasts enmeshed in a three-dimensional web of follicular dendritic cells. GC of peripheral lymphoid organs are sites of isotype-switching and of the accumulation of point mutations in the V(D)J region of productive genes encoding Igs, leading to \u201caffinity maturation\u201d of the antibodies expressed by the B blasts (see Liu et al., 1992). These GCR have been generally supposed to be dependent on CD4+ T cells (see Kelly et al. 1995), cognate T/B interactions, and cells of the B2 lineage in mice (Linton et al. 1992). Similar processes have been supposed to occur in the chronic GCR of PP, but there are few data concerning this matter. Milstein's group has used transgenic mice expressing a transgene for a kappa chain that participates in binding 2-phenyl oxazolone (Gonzalez-Fernandez and Milstein, 1993; Gonzalez-Fernandez et al., 1994). They find extensive point mutations in the V\u03ba/J\u03ba of this transgene of clonotypically related GC B cells from PP of unimmunized donors. However, these do not show the type of selection processes associated with affinity maturation among transgenes of peripheral B cells in secondarily immunized mice. They suppose the transgene in PP B cells acts as a \u201cpassenger\u201d gene, accompanying B cells expressing endogenous V\u03ba/J\u03ba genes of antibody reactive with environmental Ag in the gut. Certainly, deliberate oral immunization with effective TD Ag, such as cholera toxin (Fuhrman and Cebra, 1981) and reovirus type 1 (Weinstein and Cebra, 1991), results in accumulation of IgA-committed, memory B cells and in GCR in PP, but the specific GC B blasts have not been examined for pattern of point mutations in V-genes that could result in affinity maturation.",

Recently, TI-2 type Ags such as \u03b1(1\u21926) dextran and (4-hydroxy-3-nitrophenyl) acetyl-Ficoll have been found to stimulate GCR in spleen, albeit rather vestigial, and the specific B cells showed few point mutations and no evidence of their clustering in CDR (Wang et al., 1994; Lentz and Manser, 2001; Toellner et al., 2002). Presumably these small GCR were initiated by cells of the B2 lineage in the absence of cognate T-cell interaction. These observations of splenic GCR raise the possibility that the sequences of expressed V-genes in IgA blasts from the gut that we have found may be due to B2 cell\u2013initiated, vestigial GCR in PP, occurring in the absence of cognate T/B interactions. Indeed, with use of influenza virus challenge of the respiratory tract in chimeric mice carrying B cells lacking class II molecule expression (Sangster et al., in press) or of reovirus challenge of the gut of TCR (\u2013/\u2013) mice (Zuercher and Cebra, unpublished), specific antibody was produced of non-IgM isotypes by mucosal-associated lymphoid tissue in the absence of appreciable increase in \u201cnatural\u201d Ig. In the case of the reovirus challenge of TCR (\u2013/\u2013) mice, vestigial GCR were observed in PP. A possible mechanism for such apparently T-independent responses is the \u201cpresentation\u201d of multivalent Ags by interdigitating and/or follicular DC to B cells in conjunction with their secretion of B lymphocyte stimulator protein (BLyS) or \u201ca proliferation inducing ligand\u201d (APRIL) to stimulate modest expansion and isotype-switching (MacLennon and Vinuesa, 2002; Litinskiy et al., 2002). Microbial polysaccharide Ag or \u201crafts\u201d of Ag determinants on the surface of microbes might be especially functional stimulants of gut lymphoid tissues, especially since the ability of interdigitating DC extending through IEL spaces to transport bacteria from the gut lumen has been recognized (Rescigno et al., 2001).",

Recently, Macpherson et al.

This synergy requires colonization of the host with enteric microbes, and apparently both B1 and CD4+ T cells benefit from the colonization. Apparently the T cell effect is of the \u201cbystander\u201d type since monoclonal DO11.10 (ovalbumin-peptide specific) TCR transgenic, RAG-2 (\u2013/\u2013) T cells are effective at facilitating B1-mediated IgA production in the gut. This effect occurs only if the transgenic cells are activated in the donor or, by ovalbumin feeding, in the recipient, and is not successful in GF recipients. Although the latter observation suggests T cell activation via TCR, either by ovalbumin or microbial Ags, it does not indicate whether the requirement of B1 cells for microbial colonization is specific or not.",

Reovirus 1 is a potent stimulator of both cellular and humoral mucosal immune responses in adult mice and is normally absent from our specific-pathogen-free (SPF) mouse colonies (London et al., 1987). Thus, dams in our colonies have no circulating or mucosal antibodies against reovirus. Given orally to either 10-day-old pups or adults, reovirus 1 causes a transient intestinal infection without clinical symptoms. We found that pups expressed prompt, specific IgA antibody responses in 3 to 5 days, using the method of PP and small intestine organ fragment culturing. These responses were accompanied by distinct GC reactions in PP, with many IgA blasts, at a time, 14 to 17 days after birth, when nonimmunized pups still had quiescent B-cell follicles in PP. We also found that immunized pups expressed about 20 times more \u201cnatural\u201d IgA than virus-specific IgA, whereas noninfected control pups made neither specific nor \u201cnatural\u201d IgA. Apparently, 14- to 17-day-old pups are able to develop \u201cnatural\u201d IgA responses but ordinarily do not do so until 22 to 25 days of age, unless challenged with an infectious enteric virus not commonly associated with the mouse colonies (Kramer and Cebra, 1995a).",

We reciprocally crossed imcomp mice with coisogeneic scid mice. The homozygous scid/scid mouse cannot express any form of specific, adaptive immunity, whereas the heterozygous F1 mice (scid/+) are fully competent. Thus, the only difference between the two groups of F1 mice, born to parents exposed to the same SPF flora, is whether they were born of scid or imcomp mothers. F1 mice could also be swapped at birth, so that pups born of scid mothers could be nursed on imcomp dams and vice versa. Without using any deliberate gut mucosal stimulus, we made a number of principal findings:\u2022F1 pups born to and nursed on scid dams show a precocious rise in \u201cnatural\u201d IgA production in PP and small intestine on days 15 to 16 after birth, with concomitant GCR in PP, whereas such expression of IgA is delayed at least until days 22 to 25 in pups born to imcomp mothers;\u2022This difference between the two groups of F1 pups is reflected by IgA-secreting cells from PP, MLN, and gut LP; for instance, pups born of scid mothers have about 200 IgA ASC/106 in PP and 2000 IgA ASC/106 in the LP, whereas at day 16, pups born of imcomp dams have negligible ASC;\u2022The F1 pups born of imcomp mothers have high levels of suckled, maternal IgA in their stomach contents, whereas it is absent from pups born of scid mothers; and\u2022The bacteria isolated from the intestine of pups born and nursed on imcomp dams are \u201ccoated\u201d with IgA at an early age, whereas bacteria from pups of scid dams are initially \u201cuncoated\u201d but gradually, beginning on day 16 after birth, acquire an IgA coating via active production of IgA (Kramer and Cebra, 1995b).\n",

Offspring of immune, nonimmune but imcomp, and scid mothers were also swapped for nursing. We took advantage of the stimulatory effect of enteric reovirus not only for virus-specific IgA antibodies but also for the development of \u201cnatural\u201d IgA. The findings were rather consistent: oral vaccination of imcomp nurse dams had the greatest effect in preventing or retarding both virus-specific and \u201cnatural\u201d IgA responses by the nursing pups; oral immunization of birth mothers had only subtle suppressive effects if the pups were then suckled on scid or nonimmune imcomp dams. We have sought to immunize neonates born of mucosally immune mothers actively by the oral route (Periwal et al. 1997). The aim was to allow the pups to benefit from the potentially protective effects of passively acquired maternal antibodies while still being actively immunized via the mucosal route. We have found that \u201clive\u201d reovirus 1, a protective vaccine against oral challenge with reovirus type 3 (Cuff et al., 1990), can be encapsulated with spermine/alginate compounds. The small (about 5 \u03bcm) capsules can be given orally to avoid neutralization by coincidently suckled maternal antibodies, and these stimulate both active systemic and mucosal immune responses in the pups (Periwal et al., 1997). It has been known for some time that lactating human mothers contain antibodies in their milk reactive with their own gut microbes, especially those present during the outset of the last trimester of pregnancy, and these could protect their nursing neonates against potential enteric pathogens (Carlsson and Hanson, 1987). Using a mouse model involving imcomp or scid dams, we have found that their immunologic competence is a factor in forestalling the development of the neonatal mucosal immune system of their nursing pups and that it is also associated with a delay in colonization by certain gut commensals, such as SFB (Jiang et al., 2001).",

Generally, their target cell range and potency (E:T ratio) is greater than that of NK cells in spleen or peripheral lymph nodes (see Fig. 18.1 for CNV scid mice). Gut infection of imcomp mice with coronavirus (Carmen et al., 1996) and of scid mice with reovirus (\nTable 18.2\n) results in activation of gut NK cells in the IEL spaces. The CNV scid mice actually have IEL NK cells that display an activation state much greater than that of CNV imcomp mice before deliberate infection, that is, show greater potency in cytotoxic assays using YAC-1 targets or P815 (Fig. 18.2). Unlike CNV scid mice, the cytotoxic potency of NK cells in the IEL compartment of CNV imcomp mice is low and similar to that in their GF counterparts (\nFig. 18.3\n). Colonization of the GF imcomp mice (C3H/HeJ) with SFB results in a marked increase in NK potency over a 14- to 23-day period postinfection, as measured with YAC-1, P815, and P388 target cells (Lee, 1995; Fig. 18.3 and Fig. 18.4\n). The mouse E. coli (Schaedler's), when used to monoassociate GF scid mice, also is associated with a rise in pan-NK-positive cells in IEL spaces, compared with the cohort in AF imcomp mice, but they do not reach the level of those in CNV scid mice (\nFig. 18.5\n). The functional potential and number of NK cells in the IEL compartment of GF scid mice have not yet been reliably determined. Thus, it seems likely that normal gut microbes can be partly responsible for the activated state of NK cells in the IEL compartment, relative to those in spleen and peripheral lymph nodes.",

Likely, the \u201cunknown factor\u201d was IL-12 (Hunter, 1996; Chace et al., 1997). Further, differentiation of bone marrow precursors of NK cells requires IL-15, but so does the survival and maintenance of transferred, mature splenic NK cells as detected later in spleen, blood, and liver (Cooper et al., 2002). Perhaps, NK cells in IEL spaces likewise require IL-15, made by gut EC (Fehninger and Caligiuri, 2001) and possibly induced by microbial products, for their maintenance. Also, microbial products originating in the gut possibly can activate NK cells and their expression of IFN\u03b3. Finally, it is not clear why imcomp mice have less NK potency contributed by IEL cells than scid mice. Possibly, imcomp mice have secretory antibodies that can more effectively exclude gut microbial products from the various sites of the gut where NK cells are found.",

The constitutive (redirected) cytotoxicity of these T cells is generally low (Lefrancois and Goodman, 1989). With maturation of mice, and especially after deliberate oral infection of adult GF mice with reovirus or gut commensal bacteria, the proportion of \u03b1/\u03b2 TCR+, Thy-1+, and \u03b1/\u03b2 CD8+ T cells increases (Cuff et al., 1992, 1993; Umesaki et al., 1993; Kawaguchi et al., 1993).

A comparison of this subset of IEL T cells from CNV versus GF mice reveals the same degree of oligoclonality in each group, although the GF mice had 10-fold fewer of such cells (Regnault et al., 1996). The generalization from this and other findings is that intestinal, microbial Ags are not a main selective stimulus for the development of this oligoclonality, and particular gut colonizers (SFB) may increase the number of these \u03b1/\u03b2 TCR+, CD8+ T cells in the IEL spaces, but they do not appreciably alter the pattern of V\u03b2-gene expression when used to colonize formerly GF mice (Bousso et al., 1999; Umesaki et al., 1999).",

The \u03b1/\u03b2 CD8+, \u03b1/\u03b2TCR+ T cells seem to be a source for the local IL-2, while gut EC likely provide the IL-15 (Reinecker et al., 1996).

            "text": "Gut microbial antigens may stimulate and activate CD4+ T cells in the PP and the gut LP. This topic is particularly relevant to the next section of this chapter, chronic noninfectious diseases, and will be addressed further there. Not many convincing studies have been published concerning the development of specific responsiveness of GALT CD4+ T cells to commensal microbial antigens. The difficulties include the polyclonal and/or mitogenic stimulants that accompany bacterial extracts and sonicates (MacDonald, 1995). However, the few studies in GF or AF rodents and their colonized gnotobiotic counterparts indicate the following. First, AF mice, deprived of exogenous stimulation, develop a normal repertoire of functional T cells (Vos et al., 1992). Second, CD4+ T cells from PP of CNV imcomp mice exhibit \u201cspontaneous\u201d proliferation (autologous mixed lymphocyte reactions, or AMLR) to endogenous or exogenous APC; either GF or AF CD4+ T cells or APCs in cocultures with their APC or CD4+T cell counterparts from CNV mice respectively show diminished AMLR. These observations suggest that the GALT ordinarily contains both APCs charged with microbial antigenic determinants and reactive CD4+ T cells (Hooper et al., 1994, 1995). Third, generally, the in vitro CD4+ T cell reactivity to microbial antigens is not manifest in vivo, although in patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) or in animal models exhibiting IBD lesions, there is evidence that GALT CD4+ T cells do react with antigens of the endogenous microbial flora (Duchmann et al., 1999). Fourth, we have found that CD4+T cells in PP of CNV mice have a majority of CD45RBlow cells, indicative of prior exposure to antigens (Talham et al., 1999). Spleen and PLN of such mice have CD4+ T cells that are mostly CD45RBhigh, indicative of naive or unprimed T cells. In GF mice, the majority of PP CD4+ T cells are CD45RBhigh. However, colonization of these mice with SFB activates their PP CD4+T cells and shifts this population in 4 to 8 weeks to a CD45RBlow majority (Talham et al., 1999). This observation suggests a nonspecific role for commensal gut organisms in activating GALT CD4+ T cells.",

Attempts to implicate gut commensal bacteria as provocateurs of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) in various mouse models have involved comparisons among fecal/bacterial extracts, medium alone, or extracts of food pellets and PMA/ionomycin to try to demonstrate bacterial product\u2013driven proliferation or lymphokine production (usually IFN-\u03b3 or IL-2) by gut LP CD4+ T cells recovered from mice developing IBD (Brimnes et al., 2001; Cong et al., 1998). Generally, these T cell responses seemed to be dependent on MHC class II molecule expression and could be inhibited in vitro with specific anti\u2013class II antibody. Also, the IBD development failed to occur in otherwise susceptible class II gene \u201cknockout\u201d mice (Matsuda et al., 2000). In further support of specific stimulation by the gut microbial Ag was the finding of oligoclonality, albeit single-mouse unique, among TCR expressed by CD4+ T cells from mice with IBD, in CDR3-\u03b2 spectrotype analysis (Matsuda et al., 2000). Other observations that indirectly support TCR/bacterial Ag interaction in the activation of gut CD4+ T cells come from analyses of the DO11.10 transgenic mouse. This mouse is transgenic for TCR reactive with an ovalbumin peptide in the context of I-Ad. While DO11.10 transgenic mice with a RAG-2 (\u2013/\u2013) background had few and quiescent (na\u00efve phenotype) gut CD4+ T cells, the transgenic mice lacking knockout of the RAG-2 gene had plentiful, activated T cells in their gut LP, expressing many nonclonatypic, endogenous TCR (Saparov et al., 1999).",

A profound effect of gut Ag is to induce \u201coral tolerance.\u201d Oral tolerance is a phenomenon that has most convincingly been defined by the oral ingestion/administration of protein (\u201cdietary\u201d) Ag, resulting in a decreased systemic response to local \u201cpriming\u201d with the Ag, as reflected in diminished in vivo or in vitro response to specific Ag challenge. Usually, the diminished response assessed is of Th1 cells or of T-dependent systemic antibody responses (Dahlman-Hoglund et al., 1995; Lundin et al., 1996; Alpan et al., 2001). Presently, oral tolerance itself is considered by most as a positive, specific immune response that has down-regulatory consequences for these previously mentioned aspects of the multifaceted immune response. One operationally defined lymphoid mediator of this downregulatory effect has been termed Tr1 (or Treg) cells, which can be described as follows: CD4+ T cells that are CD25+, produce IL-10 and/or TGF-\u03b2, disseminate from the gut mucosa, proliferate only minimally or not at all in vitro to Ag/APC, and are capable of downregulating responses in vivo to Ag corresponding to their own specificity as well as to irrelevant Ag that are stimulating other specific T cells in their presence (bystander effect) (Dahlman-Hoglund et al., 1995; Thorstenson and Khoruts, 2001; Lundin et al., 1999; Shevach, 2001; Chen et al, 1998).",

(1982), who used feeding of sheep erythrocytes, a classical oral toleragen (Mattingly and Waksman, 1978), to show that convincing oral tolerance developed in CNV but not GF mice. More recently, this finding has been extended to use of ovalbumin as an oral toleragen by Moreau et al. (1999), and this group also showed that formerly GF mice monoassociated with E. coli did develop oral tolerance to ovalbumin while similar mice monoassociated with bifidobacteria did not. This latter report highlighted the problems of achieving effective systemic priming in Trexler-type isolators; this step almost precludes the use of parenterally administered Ag in CFA. We have overcome this problem by using maleylated (MA) Ag (Singh et al., 1998), which can be filter-sterilized and easily introduced in glass ampules into the isolator. Figure 18.7\nshows the use of MA-Ag to compare the development of oral tolerance in GF versus CNV mice fed dietary Ag and the facilitation of oral tolerance upon monoassociating formerly GF mice with Schaedler's E. coli.\n",

However, Moreau and Corthier (1988) found that GF C3H/HeJ mice did develop convincing oral tolerance after feeding with ovalbumin, but it was maintained for a shorter period than in CNV C3H/HeJ mice. Perhaps microbial products other than LPS, found in mice with a complete microflora, can facilitate oral tolerance. Why GF C3H/HeJ mice do exhibit oral tolerance, albeit for a shorter duration than their CNV counterparts (Moreau and Corthier, 1988), while LPS-responder GF mice do not (Moreau et al., 1999; Fig. 18.6) is unclear.",

Since Caramalho et al.

To involve such a mechanism to explain the effects of gut bacteria on the development of oral tolerance would require that Tr1 cells act in a bystander fashion in the periphery, but this has already been demonstrated (Dahlman-Hoglund et al., 1995; Lundin et al., 1996).",

Perhaps the most informative experiments performed thus far involve the comparison of rats colonized at birth or at 6 weeks of age with an E. coli expressing plasmid-encoded ovalbumin. Streptomycin/ampicillin was given prior to oral colonization of young rats and near-term pregnant dams, and administration of ampicillin was continued via the drinking water of both young rats and naturally colonized neonates. The latter showed oral tolerance to both ovalbumin and pillus Ag when challenged 6 weeks after colonization, while the adults exhibited an exaggerated systemic response, indicative of oral priming (Karlsson et al., 1999). In a mouse model, adults displayed oral tolerance after oral administration of sonicates of Leishmania major and Staphylococcus aureus; however, similar treatment with sonicates of E. coli and Salmonella typhimurium indicated no development of oral tolerance but development of priming for an exaggerated response to challenge (Garg et al., 1999). More work needs to be done to assess whether commensal microbes induce specific, Trl-mediated oral tolerance and why the time window seems to be restricted to the postnatal period. It is also not clear whether GF young adults may or may not be orally tolerized versus members of the normal microbiota upon monoassociation or oligoassociation.",

Without microbiota, the EC cycle is significantly changed, being characterized by slower epithelial renewal, lower mitotic index of crypt ECs, and prolonged transit process of EC differentiation (Abrams et al., 1963; Lesher et al., 1964; Cook and Bird, 1973). The impact of intestinal microflora on other aspects of intestinal function has also been observed. GF rodents showed reduced intestinal motility (Abrams and Bishop, 1967) and distinct patterns of enzyme production by ECs, different from those of CNV mice (DeBoth and Plaisier, 1974).",

            "text": "In recent years, advances of modern technology have led to a fine example of intestinal EC-commensal bacterial interactions (Bry et al., 1996). As a sensitive marker of gut epithelial differentiation, fucosylated glycoconjugate expression on ECs has been monitored and compared in GF versus CNV reared neonatal mice. Intestinal microbiota are required for the production of fucosylated glycoconjugate on intestinal ECs, as it was not expressed in GF mice. However, the expression could be initiated in formerly GF young adult mice upon monoassociation with Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron, a member of the microbiota in the ileum of humans and rodents. The production of fucosylated glycoconjugates was associated with accumulation of \u03b11, 2-fucosyl-transferase gene transcripts in ECs. An interesting finding is that the production of fucosylated glycoconjugates depended on the density of the bacterial population and the ability of the colonizer to use fucose as a carbon source, as isogenic strains of B. thetaiotaomicron that had disrupted fucose utilization regulon were not able to induce ECs to produce fucosylated glycoconjugates. Umesaki et al. (1995) have previously shown that another single indigenous intestinal bacterium, SFB, could induce production of fucosyl asialo GM1 glycolipids on small intestinal ECs in monoassociated formerly GF mice, similar to that observed in conventionalized mice. With use of DNA microarray, analysis of B. thetaiotaomicron\u2013monoassociated mice revealed effects of this single member of the microbiota in modulating gene expression involved in multiple intestinal functions, including nutrient absorption, mucosal barrier fortification, xenobiotic metabolism, angiogenesis, and postnatal intestinal maturation (Hooper et al., 2001). For instance, it was further demonstrated that B. thetaiotaomicron, like intestinal microbiota in CNV reared mice, could initiate the development of intestinal angiogenesis through interaction with Paneth cells in the intestinal epithelium and induce the development of normal intestinal vasculature in formerly GF mice (Stappenbeck et al., 2002b). Moreover, a family member of mouse angiogenins, angiogenin 4, which is a member of the RNase superfamily like other angiogenins, was found to have microbicidal activity and be specifically produced and secreted into the gut lumen by Paneth cells in the crypt of the small intestine (Hooper et al., 2003). The expression and secretion of angiogenin 4 were induced and regulated by commensal bacteria and bacterial products, such as B. thetaiotaomicron and LPS in the intestine, representing one of the mechanisms by which the balance or homeostasis of the microecosystem is maintained through the delicate host\u2013microbial interactions. Most recently, another study showed that a colon-specific gene expression that encoded for the production of a secreted protein called RELM\u03b2 was regulated by microbial colonization in the gut, as conventionalized formerly GF mice had dramatically enhanced expression and secretion of RELM\u03b2 into the stool in comparison with the very low level prior to the introduction of the normal microbiota (He et al., 2003). In mice, RELM\u03b2 was produced specifically by goblet cells throughout the large intestine, with the highest level in the cecum and the distal half of the colon. The mRNA for RELM\u03b2 was solely expressed in the crypt epithelium, suggesting the activation of the RELM\u03b2 gene occurs in the crypt. It is not known yet which specific member(s) of the microbiota or their products induce RELM\u03b2 expression and what the significance is of the RELM\u03b2 production in the large intestine.",

            "text": "It becomes apparent that the dialogue between intestinal microbiota and ECs has great impact on innate and adaptive immunity. Intestinal ECs are more actively participating in regulating immune responses beyond just being a passive barrier at the interface between external and internal environment (Kato and Owen, 1999). It has been demonstrated that intestinal ECs constitutively express several members of transmembrane receptors called toll-like receptors (TLRs) (Cario et al., 2002). TLR family members recognize and respond to different microbial-associated molecular patterns (Barton and Medzhitov, 2002). Recognition by TLRs initiates a signaling pathway that leads to activation of NF-\u03baB transcription factors and members of the MAP kinase family, thereby initiating the innate immune response (Medzhitov, 2001). The transcription factor NF-\u03baB is a major player in the inflammatory immune response of the gut (Tak and Firestein, 2001). Activation of NF-\u03baB in intestinal ECs by proinflammatory stimuli or pathogenic bacteria results in expression of various genes encoding inflammatory cytokines and chemokines (Elewaut et al., 1999; Gewritz et al., 2000). A recent study showed that a nonpathogenic strain of Salmonella was able to interfere with the NF-\u03baB activation pathway elicited by diverse proinflammatory stimuli. Through direct interaction with model human epithelia, the nonpathogenic bacteria could block I\u03baB degradation, an inhibitor of NF-\u03baB, thereby abrogating synthesis of inflammatory mediators (Neish et al., 2000). It is reasonable to speculate that this may also be the mechanism for the homeostatic state maintained at the intestinal mucosal surface under normal conditions (Xavier and Podolsky, 2000).",

Moreover, recent studies showed that TLR signaling can serve as a direct link between the innate and adaptive immune system through TLRs expressed on B and T lymphocytes (Barton and Medzhitov, 2002; Matsuguchi et al., 2000; Mokuno et al., 2000). Furthermore, it was demonstrated that regulatory T cells (Tr1, CD4+CD25+) selectively expressed TLRs and could respond directly to proinflammatory bacterial products such as LPS, resulting in the increase of Tr1 survival/proliferation and the enhancement of their in vitro suppressive function (Caramalho et al., 2003), which suggests that microbial products can directly modulate an adaptive immune response.

            "text": "Intestinal ECs can function as APCs and regulate T cell responses and other immune cells in the intestinal mucosa, thereby participating in adaptive immune responses (Kato and Owen, 1999). Besides the highly specialized M cells that overlie PP and can internalize and transport luminal Ags to the underlying lymphoid tissue, villous ECs are capable of uptaking and presenting antigen to T cells. Differing substantially from professional APCs, intestinal ECs can present unique and classical antigen-presenting molecules (classical and nonclassical MHC), costimulatory molecules (CD58, CD86), and some molecules that may facilitate antigen uptake (FcR\u03b3, Ganglioside M1). In addition, most of these molecules are expressed in a polarized fashion, more on the basolateral or apical surface of the intestinal ECs, suggesting the complexity of ECs as APCs (Blumberg et al., 1999; Hershberg and Mayer, 2000). These features enable ECs to interact with T cells in the mucosa. Overcoming the technical difficulties in isolating and maintaining primary intestinal ECs ex vivo for a relatively long period of time (14 days), Telega et al. (2000) showed that small intestinal and colonic ECs are both able to uptake protein Ag in a dose-dependent fashion, with a higher capacity shown by the latter. In comparison with wild-type mice, Ag uptake by colonic ECs from IL-2\u2212/\u2013 mice was increased, in parallel with higher expression of MHC class II molecules. Consistent with the increased levels of Ag uptake, Ag-pulsed colonic ECs from IL2\u2212/\u2013 mice were able to induce the highest levels of specific T cell activation in an MHC class II restricted way. Very little is known about how intestinal ECs, as APCs, deal with the tremendous amounts of Ags from intestinal microbiota and modulate immune response at mucosal sites. Indigenous bacteria, such as SFB, can induce expression of MHC class II molecules on small intestinal ECs and strongly stimulate the mucosal immune system (Umesaki et al., 1995; Klaasen et al., 1993; Talham et al., 1999). SFB are in intimate contact with intestinal ECs, and the attachment induces apparent morphological changes at the apical surface of ECs, including indented, thickened, and more electron-dense membrane and accumulation of actin filaments (Davis and Savage, 1974; Jepson et al., 1993). Recently, Yamauchi and Snel (2000) have presented evidence strongly suggesting that SFB are phagocytosed and intracellularly processed in intestinal ECs of chicken ileum. Alternatively, according to the findings of Rescigno et al. (2001), SFB may also be sampled into the LP from the surface of the epithelium by the protruding dendrites of the DCs from the LP, which can open the tight junction between the ECs and meanwhile are able to express tight-junction proteins to preserve the integrity of the epithelial barrier. In addition, it was recently observed that porcine SFB could pass by M cells to the subepithelial region, which overlies PP (Meyerholz et al., 2002). These findings may show part of the mechanisms by which SFB act as a potent stimulus of the mucosal immune system. Through interactions with normal microbiota at the front line, ECs may be an important modulator for maintaining homeostasis and for preventing a pathological inflammation.",

            "text": "We shall consider only certain of the most promising microorganisms as efficacious probiotics. Oral dosage of poultry with native gut microorganisms to prevent infection with Salmonella was first examined by Nurmi and Rantala (1973). Prophylactic inoculation of GF chicks with L. acidophilus was shown to reduce shedding of pathogenic E. coli from 100% to 47% (Watkins et al., 1982). For instance, the use of an avian-specific probiotic containing L. acidophilus and S. faecium for reducing the shedding and colonization of Clostridium jejuni in the chicken intestinal tract has been evaluated (Morishita et al., 1997). Reducing (to 27%) the C. jejuni colonization level in chickens can potentially decrease the incidence of C. jejuni infections in humans. Nowadays, more attention is being paid to selection of promising probiotic strains according to the criteria mentioned previously. From a total of 112 strains of lactic acid bacteria of duck origin, only two\u2014L. animalis and L. salivarius, on the basis of tests for aggregation, coaggregation, tolerance to acidic pH, detection of inhibitory activity, characterization of adhesion, and in vivo persistence\u2014were proposed for use in poultry (Ehrmann et al., 2002). It is interesting that 18 of 1200 bacterial isolates from cattle feces and intestinal tissue samples, which were screened and determined to inhibit the growth E. coli O157:H7 in vitro, were identified as other strains of E. coli, and one other strain was Proteus mirabilis. All 19 of these strains are nonproducers of Shiga toxin. Those selected probiotic bacteria, orally administered to cattle prior to exposure to E. coli O157:H7, can reduce the level of carriage of E. coli O157:H7 in most animals (Zhao et al., 1998). Another set of data suggests that L. salivarius 51R, which was isolated from chicken caeca and administered orally to newly hatched broiler chickens, can significantly lower counts of enterococci and coliforms in the crop during the whole experimental period (Rada and Rychly, 1995). Recently presented results (La Ragione et al., 2001) confirm that a single oral inoculum of 2.5 \u00d7 108\nB. subtilis spores sufficiently suppressed all aspects of infection with E. coli O78:K80 (a known virulent strain associated with an avian colibacillosis).",

            "text": "In CNV animals, a study of the specific role of microorganisms as well as their interactions is difficult to achieve, given the complexity of the microbial ecosystem of the gastrointestinal tract. Although numerous data have been published on the dynamics of different representative constituents in CNV young, still little is known concerning gnotobiotic animals with a limited and defined microflora of the digestive tract. However, it has long been appreciated that the levels of several biochemical indices in the blood as well as immune responses of CNV versus gnotobiotic animals differed substantially. Only four various species of bacteria (but five strains) isolated from rumen of adult sheep\u2014S. bovis C277, Prevotella ruminicola B14, Butyrivibrio fibrisolvens SH1, B. fibrisolvens JW2, and Selenomonas ruminantium Z108, which each were used in quantities of 1 \u00d7 106 microbial cells for inoculation of GF lambs\u2014can significantly influence the level of the digestive processes as well as intensiveness of nutrient metabolism (Bomba et al., 1995). In general, these results enable us to state that differences in the ecosystem of the digestive tract influenced both nitrogen and energy metabolism in CNV and gnotobiotic lambs. Rumen contents of gnotobiotic lambs showed significantly higher \u03b1-amylase and cellulase activities than in CNV lambs. This finding could be due to the composition of the inoculum, which presented a uniform population of amylolotic and cellulotic bacterial strains. Since the ecosystem of the CNV animals contained a whole range of metabolic groups of microorganisms, the proportions of amylytic and cellolytic bacteria are decreased through competition. Total serum protein levels and urea levels in CNV animals were also increased. Glucose levels did not differ significantly between groups. Total lipids in gnotobiotic lambs were substantially elevated. These differences between the groups persisted until the end of the investigation, although daily weight gains were similar. Another set of experimental data suggests that inoculation only by a single bacterium (L. casei) in gnotobiotic lambs (Bomba et al., 1997), as in gnotobiotic chicks (L. acidophilus) (Watkins et al., 1982), can protect against enterotoxigenic E. coli infection. Three other species (L. acidophilus, Saccharomyces boulardii, and E. coli) each are individually used (Figueiredo et al., 1996) also as probiotic strains to protect against enteropathogenic agents. In order to determine if there was a synergistic effect of individual microbes, organisms were orally administered to GF mice (L. acidophilus and E. coli intragastrically in a single dose of 108 viable cells; S. boulardii orally, every 2 days throughout experiment, 109 viable cells at each administration). Ten days after colonization of the digestive tract, groups of animals associated with these microorganisms or not (control) were challenged orally with streptomycin-resistant or -susceptible strains of Shigella flexneri or S. enteritidis subsp. typhimurium. All possible diassociations and monoassociations of the three probiotics with gnotobiotic mice were also performed, and these experiments led to the conclusion that only in mice in which E. coli was present could antagonism be obtained (Figlo-Lima, 2000).",

Probiotics appear to be useful in the prevention or treatment of several gastrointestinal disorders of humans, including infectious diarrhea, antibiotic diarrhea, and traveler's diarrhea (Salminen et al., 1996; Gionchetti et al., 2000). Results of preliminary human studies suggest that patients with IBD and even irritable bowel syndrome may benefit from probiotic therapy (Vanderhoof and Young, 1998). Most important is that each proposed probiotic must be studied individually and extensively to determine its efficacy and safety in each disorder for which its use may be considered. A double-blind, placebo-controlled study has shown that treatment with Lactobacillus GG, administered orally, was able to significantly reduce the incidence and duration of rotavirus diarrhea in comparison with a placebo (Isolauri et al., 1991). Saavedra et al. (1994) have shown that supplementing an infant formula with Bifidobacterium bifidum and S. thermophilus can reduce the incidence of acute diarrhea and rotavirus shedding in infants admitted to the hospital. Only two other examples are known of probiont bacteria\u2014Lactobacillus GG (Biller et al., 1995) and S. boulardii (McFarland et al., 1994)\u2014successful in the treatment of diarrhea in relapsing colitis due to Clostridium difficile. Oral bacteriotherapy with Lactobacillus GG in Crohn's disease indicates that such probiotic bacteria may have the potential to increase gut IgA and thereby promote the gut immunological barrier, irrespective of the course of the main disease (Malin et al., 1996). Probiotics have been examined and therefore reviewed (Rolfe, 2000) for their effectiveness in the prevention and treatment of other gastrointestinal disorders such as antibiotic-associated and infectious diarrhea (including those caused by Shigella, Salmonella, enterotoxigenic E. coli, and Klebsiella) and H. pylori gastroenteritis. It is interesting that Lactobacillus has been shown to be antagonistic to H. pylori both in vitro and in a gnotobiotic murine model (Kabir et al., 1997; Aiba et al., 1998). Unfortunately, the results of a few studies involving Lactobacillus and humans are conflicting.",

E. coli serotype O6:K5:H1 was examined for its ability to prevent relapses of ulcerative colitis. Preliminary data look promising and suggest that this may be another option in maintenance therapy for such diseases. The other E. coli strain was used in order to determine whether the common mucosal immune system was triggered (on tested inoculated healthy full-term infants) and to investigate effectiveness of artificial colonization of the intestine on the occurrence of nosocomial infections, presence of bacterial pathogens, and infant mortality (among high-risk infants in an intensive care unit). The most important advantage of this long-term presence of probiont bacteria in the intestine is probably stable protection of formula-fed infants from nosocomial infectious agents by an early induction of IgA antibodies that appeared in stool and saliva (partially compensating for their lack in maternal milk). In high-risk premature infants, preventive colonization was even more significant and resulted in a decrease in the number of infections, infant mortality, presence of pathogens in the intestine and other body locations, and need for antibiotics.",

Recent evidence suggests that stimulation of specific as well as nonspecific systemic and secretory immunity may be a basic mechanism by which probiotics can protect the host, especially against enteropathogens (Perdigon et al., 1995; Cukrowska et al., 2002). The underlying mechanisms of immune stimulation are not well understood yet, but specific cell wall components or even cell layers may act as adjuvants and significantly increase humoral immune responses. An interesting observation was that L. casei induced translocation of the normal flora to the liver in malnourished mice. Usually treatment with Lactobacillus or Bifidobacterium (Yasui et al., 1992) was associated with an enhancement of specific antibody\u2013secreting cells to pathogens. Therefore, it was suggested that certain strains of lactic acid bacteria, particularly Lactobacillus GG, promote both systemic and local immune responses. It is interesting that comparison of the immunological effects of viable and heat-inactivated lactic acid bacteria (Majamaa et al., 1995) shows that Lactobacillus GG, administered as a viable preparation during acute rotavirus gastroenteritis, resulted in a significantly increased rotavirus specific IgA response at convalescence; the heat-inactivated form was clinically as efficient, but the increased IgA response was not detected. Probiotic modulation of humoral, cellular, and nonspecific immunity has been generally reviewed (Erickson and Hubbard, 2000). In addition, recently it was shown that B. bifidum but not C. perfringens can significantly induce total IgA and IgM synthesis by both MLN and PP mucosal B cells. Mucosal antibody production following oral administration of B. bifidum to mice caused increased numbers of IgG, IgM, and IgA in the culture of splenic cells, but such bacteria did not induce their own specific antibody response.",

In that study the concentration of fecal \u03b11-antitrypsin, tumor necrosis factor \u03b1, and eosinophil cationic protein were determined as markers of intestinal inflammation before and after probiotic intervention. The clinical score of atopic dermatitis improved significantly in infants treated with Lactobacillus GG. The concentration of \u03b11-antitrypsin decreased in this group, but not in the group without treatment. In parallel, the median (lower-quartile to upper-quartile) concentration of fecal TNF-\u03b1 decreased significantly in this group in comparison with those receiving the extensively hydrolyzed whey formula only. The concentration of fecal eosinophil cationic protein remained unaltered during therapy. These results suggest that probiotic bacteria may promote endogenous barrier mechanisms in patients with atopic dermatitis and food allergy, and by alleviating intestinal inflammation, they may be a useful tool in the treatment of food allergy (Majamaa and Isolauri, 1997).",

Despite the long-lasting interest of investigators, their etiology and pathogenesis remain unclear.

Several murine and rat models of spontaneously developing colitis suggest that disruption of T-lymphocyte regulatory functions or mucosal barrier defects could lead to chronic intestinal inflammation. Mice with a null mutation in the IL-2, IL-10, transforming growth factor \u03b21 (TGF-\u03b21), MHC class II, T-cell-receptor (TCR) \u03b1 chain, and TCR-\u03b2 chain and mice lacking signaling G protein subunit \u03b1-2 chain were shown to develop spontaneous chronic intestinal inflammation. When these mouse models of human disease were reared in GF conditions, the disease did not appear (Sadlack et al., 1993; Hudcovic et al., 2001; Kuhn et al., 1993; Elson and Cong, 2002; Jiang et al., 2002; Strober et al., 2002). Therefore, it was suggested that dysregulation of the intestinal immune response to normal bacterial flora plays a crucial role. A loss of physiologically normal regulatory mechanisms of the local immune system, perhaps a breakdown of oral tolerance to environmental antigens (commensal gut bacteria), is probably involved in the pathogenic mechanism. Findings from experimental models of IBD indicate that T cells are responsible for the regulation of the intestinal immunological response to luminal antigens. Direct evidence of the participation of a subpopulation of CD4+ T cells in gut immunoregulation came from the finding that colitis in scid mice, developing after the transfer of a \u201cpathogenic\u201d CD45RBhigh CD4+ T-cell subpopulation isolated from spleen of conventional BALB/c mice, could be prevented by simultaneous transfer of a \u201cregulatory\u201d CD45RBlow CD4+ T-cell population; these T cells express CD25 marker (Powrie, 1995). Surprisingly, the regulatory T-cell population isolated from GF mice was also able to suppress the inflammatory reaction when transferred together with pathogenic T cells (Singh et al., 2001). In this model as well as in others, the important role of normal flora in disease development was confirmed, and the potential members of microflora responsible for intestinal inflammation were analyzed.",

The prevalence of the disease is high; a moderate form of this disease affects about 50% of adults, while the progressive, destructive form of periodontal disease occurs in a smaller proportion of the population (5%\u201315%). Periodontitis is a multifactorial disease in which immunological mechanisms, poorly understood genetic factors, and microbial etiology play a major role. The presence of subgingival flora is essential but not sufficient for the disease to occur. Periodontopathic bacteria that have been implicated in the etiology of the disease are Porphyromonas gingivalis, Bacterioides forsythus, Actinobacillus actinomycetem comitans, Fusobacterium nucleatum, and others (Seymour et al., 1993; Henderson et al., 1999; Wilson et al., 2002). The possible involvement of these bacteria in periodontitis corresponds to the findings of increased levels of antibodies to these microbes in the patients and the pathological effects of these bacteria in animal models of this disease. Experimental models of the disease include GF rats monoassociated with P. gingivalis, mice infected with P. gingivalis, and ligated rat or hamster teeth. Most of these microorganisms are gram-negative bacteria, thus containing LPS that could induce polyclonal B cell activation. The essential role of bacterial involvement was demonstrated by the finding that induction of the disease by ligating the teeth was possible only in animals with an oral microflora. Periodontitis with bone loss did not occur in animals reared in GF conditions (Seymour et al., 1993; Henderson et al., 1999; Wilson et al., 2002).",

It is generally accepted that autoimmunity against \u03b2 cells may arise from activation of the immune system in genetically predisposed individuals by environmental factors bearing epitopes similar to those in the \u03b2 cell. Candidate environmental antigens in IDDM include various microbial and food components. In particular, the most diabetogenic factors seem to be dietary proteins\u2014in particular, cow's milk proteins. All these antigens are usually introduced to the body via mucosal surfaces. An increased risk for the development of IDDM has been associated with triggering of the immune system by enterovirus infection and cow's milk proteins. Moreover, enhanced immune responsiveness to dietary proteins has been noted in patients with newly diagnosed IDDM (Karjaleinen et al. 1992). Animal models that are being used to help elucidate the pathogenesis of this disease are BB rats and NOD mice spontaneously developing diabetes (Rose and Mackay, 2000; Bach, 2002; Shoenfeld et al., 2002).",

Our findings demonstrating that a gluten-free diet in NOD mice prevents onset of diabetes suggest the role of the gut in induction of diabetes (Funda et al., 1999). NOD mice were derived in our laboratory into a GF condition, and the effect of microflora components is being assessed. It is interesting that in our preliminary experiments, it seems that autoimmune diabetes is developing also in GF NOD mice.",

The results of recent epidemiological studies showed that their incidence today is almost three times higher than it was in 1970. This increase, which concerns mainly economically well-developed countries, was not found in the former socialist countries (Russia, Romania, Bulgaria). A search for an explanation for this trend resulted in a hypothetical statement that exaggerated hygienic conditions in developed countries decreased the quantity of natural infectious stimuli from the external environment, disturbing well-balanced development of subpopulations of T cells (the so-called hygienic hypothesis about the increase in allergies).",

At birth, Th2 cells are predominantly active, but this changes in favor of Th1 cells, providing a normal course of early postnatal development. Because the microorganisms colonizing the intestinal tract of newborn infants are the first microbial stimuli to which they are exposed soon after birth, it stands to reason that intestinal flora may be one of the principal candidates for providing an explanation for this phenomenon. Recent microbiological analyses pointed out differences in the composition of intestinal microflora between children from highly developed and underdeveloped countries. The former are born under controlled conditions in nursing homes under maximal care and observance of all hygienic measures. Consequently, the spectrum of microbes of their intestinal tract is much more limited than that of children in less-developed countries (Bjorksten et al., 2001; Tlaskalova-Hogenova et al., 2002; Kaliomaki and Isolauri, 2003). Unfortunately, there is still little understanding of the role played by intestinal lymphatic tissue and mucosal immunity in these processes, and there is a paucity of animal models for food allergies that could be manipulated to assess the effects of the \u201cnormal\u201d intestinal microbiota.",
