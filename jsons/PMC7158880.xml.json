Both viruses have been associated with early super-spreading events with R0s of up to 22 for SARS-CoV39,40,43 and up to 30 for MERS-CoV.39,49 These large numbers of secondary infections have been mostly associated with nosocomial outbreaks: 30% of all SARS-CoV cases (mostly health care workers) and 44%\u2013100% of all MERS-CoV cases (mostly patients) occurred from nosocomial transmissions.39,55,56 These super-spreading events were followed by reduced spread in the following generations of viruses with a decrease in the R0s to 0.8 for SARS-CoV39 and to 0.7 for MERS-CoV (Table 1).128 Therefore, both SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV have low potential for long-term sustained community transmission. No human SARS-CoV infections have been detected since July 2003. However, SARS-CoV-like viruses can be found in bats, which are known to be able infect human cells without adaptation, making it possible for SARS-CoVs to reemerge84 (as has now happened with SARS-CoV-2). The zoonotic transmission of MERS-CoV to humans has continued, attributed to the role of dromedary camels as a reservoir and their close contact with humans (in contrast to human-bat-interactions).21",

This highlights the urgent need for rapid and effectful strategies of infection control. One of the main challenges with novel CoVs is the high potential for nosocomial transmission.239 Health care settings seem to increase the risk of viral transmission due to aerosol-generating procedures such as intubation and bronchoscopy. Appropriate hospital hygiene practices are therefore crucial to limit nosocomial outbreaks. The main aims are to effectively triage patients with fever, respiratory symptoms and a contact history240 and to apply stringent infection control measures such as isolating patients and quarantine contacts as early as possible. Ideally, each patient is placed in a single negative pressure room. If this is not possible, patients and health care workers should be cohorted.241 Protective gear should include water-resistant gowns, disposable gloves, N95 masks and goggles or face shields.240 Only suction catheters and mechanical respirators with a closed-circuit system and viral filters should be used.240 In contrasts, nebulizers, oxygen masks or nasal continuous positive airway pressure systems should not be used on an open ward.240,241 Needless to say, strict hand hygiene needs to be applied and visitors should be avoided or limited to an absolute minimum. HCoVs have been shown to persist on dry surfaces for up to 9 days.242\u2013244 The persistence depends on temperature (shorter duration at 30\u201340\u00b0C) and humidity (longer at higher humidity).245 HCoVs, including novel CoVs, can be inactivated by heating to 56\u00b0C for 30 minutes or by using lipid solvents such as ethanol (>75%), isopropanol (>70%), formaldehyde (>0.7%), povidone-iodine (>0.23%), sodium hypochlorite (>0.21%), hydrogen peroxide (>0.5%), but not chlorhexidine.72,244",

This might be because children are less frequently exposed to the main sources of transmission (which until now has been disproportionally nosocomial) or because they are less exposed to animals. However, it could also be that children are less frequently symptomatic or have less severe symptoms and are therefore less often tested, leading to an underestimate of the true numbers infected. In relation to SARS-CoV-2, a study prepublished in early March 2020 suggests that children are just as likely as adults to become infected with this virus but are less likely to be symptomatic or develop severe symptoms.246 However, the importance of children in transmitting the virus remains uncertain. The majority of children infected by a novel CoVs reported thus far have a documented household contact, often showing symptoms before them, suggesting the possibility that children are not an important reservoir for novel CoVs. The clinical, laboratory and radiologic features in children are similar for all novel CoVs, except more children infected with SARS-CoV presented with fever compared with SARS-CoV-2 or MERS-CoV. To date, no deaths in children have been reported for SARS-CoV or SARS-CoV-2, except (in the case of the former) for infants of mothers who were infected during pregnancy.",
