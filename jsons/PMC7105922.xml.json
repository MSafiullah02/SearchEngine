Related to the more general and long pursued concept of database searching [2, 3] the term \u2018virtual screening\u2019 (VS) is relatively young [4]. Walters et al. define virtual screening as \u2018automatically evaluating very large libraries of compounds\u2019 using computer programs [5]. As this definition suggests, VS has largely been a numbers game focusing on questions like how can we filter down the enormous chemical space of >1060 conceivable compounds [6] to a manageable number that can be synthesized, purchased and tested. Although filtering the entire chemical universe might be a fascinating question, more practical VS scenarios focus on designing/optimizing targeted combinatorial libraries and enriching libraries of available compounds from in-house compound repositories or vendor offerings.",

When integrated with high throughput screening (HTS), VS can aid in the rapid identification of novel ligands [7, 8]. VS includes target specific search criteria but also target independent considerations such as drug-likeness [9, 10]. The use of VS technologies has also aided the identification of bioactive molecules from natural products [11]. VS methods are often divided into structure-based VS (SBVS) [12, 13] and ligand-based VS (LBVS) [14, 15]. SBVS and LBVS have been reviewed frequently in the literature.

            "text": "SBVS and LBVS have been considered almost mutually exclusive suggesting LBVS to be used primarily in the absence of protein target structure(s) and SBVS to be used if target structure(s) are available. Especially when a target protein structure at high atomic resolution is available, SBVS is often considered as the first choice strategy ignoring possible LBVS alternatives. Until recently, only sporadic studies have pointed to the fact that LBVS offers a strong alternative to SBVS even in the presence of protein structural information. For instance, a comparison of LBVS and SBVS methods using the recall of known HIV-1 protease inhibitors as test examples has shown how ligand similarity methods can outperform molecular docking as a VS tool [16]. Recently a more systematic comparative study between SBVS and LBVS involving seven different drug targets for which structural information is available has been published [17]. Figure 2\nillustrates that in most cases LBVS techniques measuring compound similarity to known potent molecules outperforms molecular docking, a more computationally intensive SBVS technique that generates and scores putative protein\u2013ligand complexes according to their calculated binding affinities [18]. Similar results have recently been reported in the field of GPCRs using homology models for SBVS and 2D-qsar, decision trees, and PLS as LBVS methods [19]. Although studies about scaffold hopping through SBVS are scarce [20] it is recognized that SBVS techniques have a better potential to identify compounds with a novel core scaffold. Therefore, SBVS and LBVS should not be applied independently but rather in concert to increase the chances of finding novel hits [21, 22]. Some software approaches such as SDOCKER have begun integrating both strategies by including ligand similarity as a part of the scoring functions used in the docking algorithm [23]. Bologa et al. has also reported the integration of both strategies to aid in the identification of the first selective GPR30 agonist [24].",

Machine learning approaches have been reviewed less before in the context of VS. Therefore, we include here a short synopsis of the most prominent techniques in addition to highlighting their applications in VS. Several recent success stories have been reported in the literature and a few examples of the more popular machine learning techniques are listed in Table 1\n. Each method has its own advantages and disadvantages that should be understood to select the best approach for a particular LBVS. The first approach listed in the table, a self-organizing map (SOM), is quite simple and easy to visualize. A dataset of compounds are mapped on to a 2D grid such that most similar compounds are grouped together. Compounds found in the same vicinity of those with a desired biological property are considered potential hits in a virtual screen; however the SOM approach in general has a very high false positive rate. It is a simple and easy way to visualize if compounds that have the same biological properties group together. SOMs have been used recently to identify several purinergic receptor agonists [25]. Another approach called Binary QSAR uses all compounds in the training set to predict the biological property of test compound(s) in a virtual screen rather than just the most similar training compounds. Although not providing an image of the training data, this approach is fast and like SOMs it works well if the training data is highly similar to the test compounds being screened. Compounds that are significantly different from the training set are not expected to be predicted accurately and are commonly missed in a virtual screen [26].",

These techniques form correlations between training data and descriptors that describe training compounds to predict a biological property for a virtual set of compounds. The Bayesian Classifier requires a pre-built model and is somewhat similar to Binary QSAR except it identifies specific descriptors that best distinguish compounds with a desired biological property from others. This search for pertinent descriptors is called variable selection and helps the model eliminate descriptors that are not relevant to the current problem and cloud the separation of one biological property class from another. The Bayesian Classifier algorithm has been shown to not perform as well as even more sophisticated approaches [27]; however, it does handle large training sets much easier.",

Variable selection techniques are also commonly added above the PLS algorithm to optimize the descriptors used in the linear model. This approach has shown success enriching a virtual database for various GPCR ligands [19]; however, it has an obvious drawback. There is not always a linear correlation between the property modeled and the descriptors describing your dataset. The artificial neural network (ANN) and support vector machine (SVM) approaches allow one to build non-linear correlations. ANN and SVM have become popular tools for model building and virtual screening. In a side-by-side comparison both ANN and SVM show similar enrichment rates for several virtual screens [27].",

Compounds in a virtual screen are predicted based on known activities of the most similar training compounds. Similarity between compounds is calculated using only a small set of most pertinent descriptors that are optimized during model building (this optimization can be quite slow for large datasets). When used in a virtual screen kNN shows database enrichment rates similar to both ANN and SVM [27]. A domain of applicability can be used in virtual screening to improve the enrichment rates in a virtual screen by only allowing the model to predict compounds that have the highest chance of being predicted correctly. Applicability domain techniques have been applied very successfully for both kNN [28] and SVM [29]. However, limitations lie in the fact that a very narrow applicability domain only identifies potential compound hits that are highly similar to the training set compounds. Such hits could have possibly been found using a simpler, less time consuming approach also.",

Advancements in VS have therefore been made in understanding the strengths and weaknesses of existing methods and how to use them rather than coming up with new approaches.

For instance, pharmacophore models using known ligands are combined with homology models; QSAR models are combined with docking approaches.
