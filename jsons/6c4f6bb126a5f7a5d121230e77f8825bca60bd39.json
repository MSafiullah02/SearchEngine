In order to control rubella and measles epidemics, the measles-rubella (MR) vaccine was introduced into the immunization program in 1992, which was preceded by a \"catch-up\" campaign among children 1-11 years old [Massad et al., 1995] . Despite this, however, rubella epidemics occurred in 2000/2001 and 2007/2008 . The age of rubella onset increased gradually from 1999 to 2008; in the last year, the patients in most cases were 20-29 years old.",

An aliquot (5 ml) of RT reaction mixture was added to a PCR mix containing 10\u00c2 buffer (Invitrogen TM , Life Technologies), 2.5 mM MgCl 2 , 1.25 mM of dNTP mix, and Platinum Taq DNA polymerase (Invitrogen TM , Life Technologies). The forward and reverse primers used for the first reaction and nested reactions were described previously [Figueiredo et al., 2012a] . The reaction cycle parameters were 30 cycles each consisting of 94 C for 1 min, 50 C for 1 min, and 72 C for 2 min. After amplification, 5 ml of the first-round reaction mix was transferred to a new tube for the nested reaction, which was performed using the same PCR conditions as above. Products were verified on a 1.5% agarose gel stained with ethidium bromide, using 1\u00c2 TAE electrophoresis running buffer. Amplified DNA fragments were purified with the PureLink PCR Purification Kit (Invitrogen) and submitted for sequencing reactions with an ABI Prism Big Dye Terminator v3.1 Cycle Sequencing kit (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA) according to the manufacturer's protocol. Sequences obtained were analyzed using the CLUSTAL X [Thompson et al., 1997] and BioEdit version 7.0 programs. DNA analysis software was used to compare the obtained sequences with those of the WHO reference strains. Phylogenetic analyses were performed using the DNASTAR package (DNASTAR, Madison, WI). The sequences obtained during this study are available in GenBank (Table I) .",

The number of cases reported in S\u00e3 o Paulo from 1992 to 2009 is shown in Fig. 1 : rubella epidemics occurred in 2000/ 2001 and 2007/2008 (Fig. 1a) . Two peaks of reported CRS rubella cases were observed: 1 in 2000, with 138 rubella infections in pregnant women, and the other in 2007 (70 cases; Fig. 1b) . The reported rubella cases during these periods were concentrated in the age group of 20-39 years. All cases were clinically diagnosed as rubella and confirmed serologically with IgM-specific antibodies to RV. Of the samples, 92% were scored positive with a diagnostic PCR different from the PCR approach based on sequencing E1 gene fragments for genotyping. The specificity of the RT-PCR, calculated for the negative cases and viruses, was 100%. Sensitivity of viral RNA detection by this approach was 100%. All samples inoculated were positive by viral isolation, and none of the samples analyzed were negative, as determined by the culture plus RT-PCR method after the first passage. Figure 2 shows a representative RV phylogenetic tree that was developed on the basis of the standard E1 gene window recommended by the WHO (nucleotides 8,291-9,469). These sequences, together with reference strains recommended by the WHO, were used to construct a phylogenetic tree. The 27 rubella sequences were divided into four genotypes (Figs. 1b, 2, and 3): genotype 1a (seven strains), genotype 1B (four strains), genotype 1G (eight strains), and genotype 2B (eight strains). The homology observed among all sequence isolates and the reference strains ranged from 97.8% to 98.2% for genotype 1a, from 90.0% to 93% for genotype 1G, from 97% to 98% for genotype 1B, and 98% to 99% for genotype 2B. All sequences of genotypes 1a, 1B, 1G, and 2B formed a well-supported cluster in the distance tree and grouped with the reference strains with a significant bootstrap value. RV isolates belonging to genotypes 1a, 1B, and 1G were present in S\u00e3 o Paulo during the 2000 and 2001 outbreaks. Thereafter, in late 2007, the epidemiological conditions changed, resulting in a large outbreak of RV with a clear predominance of genotype 2B (Fig. 1b) . The sequences within genotype 1a were quite similar (within-group distance: 0.9%) and clustered with sequences from Myanmar (Gen-Bank accession numbers AY280707 and AB080199; Fig. 2 ). All genotype 1B isolates had 98% sequence homology with the sequence isolates from Israel (AY 968207 and AY968209) that circulated during [1975] [1976] [1977] [1978] [1979] [1980] [1981] [1982] [1983] [1984] [1985] [1986] [1987] [1988] . Genotype 1G obtained in this study showed a 98% similarity with viruses from Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, that circulated in 1999 (GenBank accession ",

This is one of the few studies to investigate a significant number of RVs involved in congenital infections. The strains were collected from all regions of S\u00e3 o Paulo State over a 13-year period (1996-2009) , providing baseline information concerning the circulating genotypes as required for the documentation of rubella/CRS elimination. Between 1992 and 2000, the incidence of rubella among adults increased markedly, with a steady rise in the detection of CRS cases. In 2000 and 2001, two outbreaks occurred in S\u00e3 o Paulo, with incidences reaching 7.1 per 100,000 inhabitants in 2000 and 3.8 per 100,000 inhabitants in 2001 among women aged 20-29 years (23.7 cases per 100,000 persons in this age group), with 138 confirmed rubella cases among pregnant women [CVE, 2010] . The accumulation of a large number of susceptible (unvaccinated) individuals led to the occurrence of a rubella epidemic in S\u00e3 o Paulo in 2007; in this outbreak, most of the rubella cases involved men between 20 and 29 years of age, which differed from the demographics observed during the outbreak that occurred in 2000. A large number of cases were concentrated in the central west, south, southeast, and northeast of Brazil; there were 8,683 confirmed cases, including 161 cases of pregnant women and 17 CRS cases [Brazilian Health Department, 2010] . In S\u00e3 o Paulo, 2,373 cases were confirmed between July 2007 and December 2008 [CVE, 2010] .",

The RV genome was detected in 92% of the samples by RT-PCR. As the clinical diagnosis of rubella is unreliable, rapid laboratory diagnosis of rubella in pregnancy is critical. The risk of congenital infection is usually estimated by establishing the gestational age at the time of maternal infection. However, diagnosis of intrauterine infection is difficult because maternal serology is often inconclusive when infection occurs between the 13th and 20th weeks of gestation [Best, 2007] . The most direct method of diagnosing fetal infection is by PCR, and is therefore essential for early diagnosis, as shown by another study [Andrade et al., 2006] .",

Phylogenetic analysis of the 26 sequences obtained during this study showed that at least 4 different genotypes were involved in congenital infections: genotypes 1a, 1B, 1G, and 2B. Our study showed that there was a high incidence of rubella genotypes 1a, 1B, and 1G in pregnant women during the 2000/2001 outbreaks. The first isolation of this genotype in S\u00e3 o Paulo was reported by Reef et al. [2002] and persisted until 2007 [Figueiredo et al., 2008; Figueiredo et al., 2011 Figueiredo et al., , 2012a .

The genotype 1B found in this study was most similar to an isolate obtained in Israel more than 20 years earlier (GenBank accession number AY968209). In ",

            "text": " Abernathy et al., 2011] . During the 2000-2001 outbreak, genotype 1G was also isolated and has continued to persist in Brazil [Icenogle et al., 2011] . It is important to note that genotype 1G exhibited sequence similarity to the 1G strain from Rio de Janeiro isolated during 1996-1999 [Donadio et al., 2003] . Genotype 1G is one of the prevalent genotypes of RV in Europe, Asia, and Africa ( Fig. 4) [WHO, 2005 [WHO, , 2007 ; Jin and Thomas, 2007; Caidi et al., 2008; Rajasundari et al., 2008; Omer et al., 2010] . Viruses with genotypes 1G and 1B have been found in the Americas over a 7-year time span, indicating that these viruses were likely endemic . During the 2007 outbreak, genotype 2B was the predominant rubella strain in Brazil and South America [Icenogle et al., 2011; Figueiredo et al., 2012a] . Genotype 2B viruses were previously known to circulate in Asia and Africa [WHO, 2005 [WHO, , 2007 , and after 2006, genotype 2B was introduced to some countries in Europe [Jin and Thomas, 2007; D'Agaro et al., 2010; Vauloup-Fellous et al., 2010] and South America (Fig. 4) [Valinotto et al., 2009] . The fact that genotype 2B was not detected in the Americas before 2006 may indicate importation from Europe or Asia where this genotype is endemic. Genotype 2B found in these countries showed 99% identity with recent isolates from Japan, Argentina, and Brazil.The Network for measles and rubella viruses surveillance reported the global distribution of RV genotypes and indicated that in Europe, genotypes 1E and 1G are predominant [WHO, 2007] . More recently, genotype 1E was isolated in cases of congenital infection from France [Vauloup-Fellous et al., 2010] . It is possible that genotype 1E has a greater propensity to cause congenital infections than other genotypes do, but it is more likely that the 1E virus was simply the most prevalent. Vauloup-Fellous et al. [2010] suggested a very wide circulation of genotype 1E, which may well be the most prevalent contemporary genotype worldwide (Fig. 4) . Phylogeny showed that the French 1E sequences are interspersed with viruses from other European and American countries, possibly indicating multiple exchanges between these countries. In Brazil, consistent with national reports, genotype 1E virus not was detected [Icenogle et al., 2011] . Interestingly, the epidemiology for RV characterized in S\u00e3 o Paulo over a 13-year period showed that genotype 1a was predominant, comprising 44% of total virus strains, followed by genotype 1G (22%), 2B (20%), and 1B (%). The detection of these genotypes coincided with rubella outbreaks in S\u00e3 o Paulo from 2000 to 2007. In conclusion, this is the first molecular epidemiological characterization of RVs involved in CRI and CRS in Brazil. Our findings suggest that endemic transmission of RV has been interrupted. Nevertheless, rubella is still endemic in many parts of the world; therefore, it is important to maintain the surveillance system in order to document sustained absence of CRS and to maintain high vaccine coverage.",
