Some forms of gamification have been applied in health-related programmes in South Africa such as Multiply's Active Dayz\u2122 and Discovery's Active rewards. This study looks at the motivational aspects of gamification in healthcare. It investigates the impact of gamification on clients' use of activity rewards programmes, and aims to identify the core motivational factors that would drive people in South Africa to improve their health through exercise. We use Yu-Kai Chou's Octalysis framework of motivation in gamification as guide. The results show that time is a barrier for engaging in exercise, rewards programmes lead to more health check-ups, knowing the benefits of exercise not enough motivation to engage in exercise, and members of rewards programmes have different motivational factors for their behaviour than non-members.",

In a survey of over 2000 South Africans conducted by Pharma Dynamics in 2017 [2] , more than 46% of respondents acknowledged that they indulge in activities that put their health at risk. Some important results of this study were that 21% of young adults do not take any interest in improving their health, whereas 88% of older adults have actively sought a change in lifestyle to improve their health. Of these older people, 69% make an effort to exercise regularly. This study also claims that 215 South Africans die every day from heart disease and even though genetic factors are at play, living a healthier lifestyle can avoid about 80% of these deaths.",

Nelson [11] argues that gamification originated in the early to mid-20th century in Soviet Union to motivate workers without capitalist-style financial incentives. Modern gamification was driven by airline loyalty programmes that reward customers with free \"air miles\" [12] . Different theories of gamification provide different views on gamification based on the industry where it is applied. One theory is that gamification is more effective than branding because of the emotional effect it has on the audience that leads to a longer relationship [13] . Another theory is that games create a natural reward compulsion loop driven by its effect on dopamine levels in the brain [14] . The origins and mechanics may differ, but the concept is simple: users are rewarded for certain behaviour based on their performance.",

We based the questions relating to motivational factors on the Octalysis Framework. The questionnaires included multiple choice, yes/no, open ended and ranking questions. We compiled them using Google FormsTM. We recruited participants through our own social media networks.

Only 16% of members and 14% of non-members have regular check-ups and are well-informed about their health. Twelve percent of non-members blame time constraints. Overall the activity rewards group members are more proactive when it comes to monitoring their health than the non-members. Which of These Best Describes Your Exercise Routine? More than half (52%) of members of an activity rewards programme visit a gym or exercise four or more times a week, while only 12.2% of the non-members fell into this category. The most popular response among non-members was that they do not gym but try to take the stairs (44.9%). Seventy-eight percent of members exercise at least once a week. Of the nonmembers, 18.4% do no exercise at all. None of the members chose this option. Figures 4 and 5 summarise the results for this question. Belonging to a gamified programme doubles the likelihood that a person will exercise. Respondents could provide multiple answers to this question. We received 74 responses from members. All but one gave reasons for doing exercise. Forty-five percent (45%) of responses were members. All but one gave reasons for doing exercise. Forty-five percent (45%) of responses were \"to keep fit and healthy\". The next most popular reasons were \"weight loss\" and \"to look good\" (12% each). In the \"Other\" category reasons such as \"to test myself\" and \"it was recommended by my doctor\" were mentioned. The one member who does not exercise said the reason was lack of time. Fifty non-members responded to the question -29 said they do not exercise. Twenty-three of these (79.3%) claimed that they had no time, while 13.8% admitted laziness. The remaining participants said they have commitment issues or that they are already fit. Twenty-one non-members said they do exercise. Thirteen (59.1%) do it \"to stay healthy\". Two responses each were recorded for \"managing stress levels\" and \"because I play sport\".

We asked all of the non-member respondents which of the eight factors would motivate them to join. Fifty-nine percent (59%) chose \"Development and Accomplishment\", while \"Epic Meaning and Calling\" and \"Empowerment of Creativity and Feedback\" were each selected by 34%. We can link this to the earlier outcome that non-members do not exercise as much as members, and they may want to be empowered or require feedback on whether their exercise is done correctly and is not a waste of their time. Ten percent said outright that they would not join an activity rewards programme. This paper aimed to understand which motivational factors in gamification will encourage people to exercise. We investigated four sub-questions. We next provide the answers to each, highlighting the lessons learnt. Firstly, we asked how active people on gamified health programmes are versus people who are not. The findings show that those on activity rewards programmes are more than twice as active as those who are not. We can conclude that these programmes are beneficial in improving healthcare. These findings are in line with previous studies who found that gamification of health programmes positively influenced users' emotional experiences and as a consequence improves their self-esteem [21, 22] . Furthermore, it supports Marshedi's [22] finding of gamification motivating users to adapt their health habits for the better. However, it has been shown that users might lose interest in the gamification aspects over time [23] .",

Members are incentivised with rewards for completing tests, which could be the reason they have more check-ups with a doctor than the non-members.

This finding is in line with the findings of a systematic review of gamification in e-Health [24] who found that the gamification elements that were most often used were \"feedback, rewards, progression and social features\". Another key outcome was that members and non-members need to be motivated differently. The members want to ensure they do not lose their points and statusesan element of fear might drive them. The social aspect is also important to them, and it will be beneficial to add concepts that encourage competition or challenges between friends. This outcome supports the research of Roa and Pandas (cited in [24] ) who reported that \"developing positive social relationships and promoting a feeling of integration are the key social benefits noted for gamification\". For the non-members, it is more important to receive feedback and be empowered. Another important factor for this group was \"Epic Meaning and Calling\", which could be attributed to the fact that they want to know these goals are achievable. It should not waste their time, and the rewards should be immediate and notable. They have to be convinced that the value justifies the effort or money invested.",
