Based on an extended SEIR model and continuous-time optimal control theory, in this paper the optimal non-pharmaceutical intervention strategy is presented for the case that a vaccine is never found. In this case, the optimal control must meet two competing requirements: First, the minimization of disease-related deaths, and, second, the establishment of a sufficient degree of herd immunity at the end of the measures, in order to exclude a second wave. The presented control strategy is a singleintervention scenario that goes beyond heuristically motivated interventions and simple \"flattening of the curve\". The characteristic time course of the computed optimal control is the following: After an intense but short initial lockdown, a dynamical equilibrium is enforced during which the number of actively infected is held on a constant level for a longer period of time. At the same time, the measures can be gradually relaxed with an ever increasing speed. Two simple rules for the optimal control of the effective reproduction number are presented, see Eqs. (13)-(14), which ensure a stable route out of the initial lockdown. The rules are directly applicable in practice, as they only depend on a precise knowledge of the cumulative number of cases and a reliable estimate of the effective reproduction number. The obtained results could serve as a guideline for the implementation and gradual relaxation of non-pharmaceutical intervention measures also in other scenarios, e.g., when the development of a vaccine is expected soon. The model system is calibrated to reproduce the initial exponential growth phase of the COVID-19 epidemic in Germany.",

Since the outbreak of the epidemic, a large number of simulation studies has been published that use mathematical models to simulate the progression of the disease in order to assess the potential of various intervention scenarios and to estimate the corresponding demands on the health care system [1, 2, 5-7, 9, 10, 14, 17, 21] .

This threshold can be either a manageable upper limit for tracing programs or, in extreme cases, the maximum number of intensive care beds to prevent the collapse of the health care system. In order to achieve this goal, various non-pharmaceutical measures must be precisely coordinated, both in terms of time and intensity, to prevent a sudden increase in the number of cases. Due to the inherently nonlinear dynamics of epidemics, the optimal control of infection transmission is a non-trivial problem and heuristic intervention strategies such as simple bang-bang controls [23, 34, 35] or cycling strategies are typically far from optimal [6, 39] . Moreover, this type of interventions also might include ineffective measures that should be avoided for socio-economic reasons.",

The lead scenario considered here is the (hopefully unlikely) case in which an effective vaccine is never found and the epidemic must be controlled with purely non-pharmaceutical measures. Then, optimal control must pursue two competing objectives: On the one hand, the number of disease-related deaths must be minimized by strictly avoiding an overload of intensive care treatment capacities. On the other hand, however, at the end of the measures, sufficient natural immunity must have been built up in the population to exclude a second outbreak of the epidemic. The corresponding optimal control obtained in this paper, is a single-intervention strategy, which keeps the number of simultaneously infected persons almost constant over a sufficiently long period of time by means of a precisely tuned temporal course of the effective reproduction number.",

Then, based on the expected time for vaccine development as well as health policy and ethical considerations, an appropriate maximum number of simultaneously infected must be determined, which should not be exceeded until the epidemic is terminated by a mass vaccination. The underlying mathematical model for the progression of the epidemic and the estimation of the demand for intensive care resources is described in Sec. 2. The optimal control problem is derived in Sec. 3 and the results are described in Sec. 4. One of the major findings of this paper are two important rules (13)- (14) , that describe the stability bounds for the optimally steered effective reproduction number on the way out of an initial lockdown. These results are obtained by a careful analysis of the numerically computed optimal control function in Sec. 4.2. Details on the parameter adjustment to reproduce the initial exponential growth phase of the COVID-19 epidemic in Germany are given in the Appendix.",

            "text": "The results described above indicate that the state-dependent mortality rate f (C/C 0 ) effectively imposes a state-constraint that strictly enforces C < C 0 , i.e., a maximum number of simultaneously infected people. In principle, this allows to investigate the optimal control for other (less extreme) scenarios, where e.g. the maximum number of simultaneously infected people should be held far below the number of available ICUs (i.e., the meaning of C 0 will be reinterpreted). In this case, the increased mortality rate f 1 is an artificial parameter, that penalizes the excess of patients in a critical state above a freely chosen value of C 0 . By ramping up the control parameter P, an optimal solution with C (t) < C 0 for all t \u2208 [0, T ] is found. The optimal control function computed in this way is completely independent of f 1 . Figure 5 shows the optimal control for different values of C 0 . The time course of the optimal effective reproduction number is qualitatively the same for all considered values of C 0 , see Fig. 5 (a, b) . Most notably, the time scale of the entire intervention scenario is governed by the duration of the critical period, during which the number of critical patients is held at C C 0 , see Fig. 5 (c). The full width half maximum (FWHM) time of that period T FWHM \u223c C \u22121 0 scales inversely with the peak number of simultaneously infected, see Fig. 5 (d). The minimization of the disease-related deaths is controlled by the parameter P in the terminal cost function (5b). Figure 5 (e) displays the progression of the optimization routine into the targeted optimal state (i.e., without excess of C 0 ) while P is ramped up. At a certain value of P, which depends on C 0 , the routine reaches a plateau where both the number of disease-related deaths as well as the total costs of the intervention measures T 0 dt C (u (t)) become constant. The corresponding values of P, which correspond to the optimal scenario that fully avoids excess of critically ill patients over C 0 , are located on that plateau and are marked by square symbols in Fig. 5 (e) . The optimized transmission function minimizes the number of disease-related deaths to a C 0 -independent value D min (T ) \u2248 4.2 \u00d7 10 5 for P \u2192 \u221e, but to a total cost that scales with C \u22121 0 . The curve reflects the state-dependent fatality rate (2) . According to the present model, further reduction of disease-related deaths below D min (T ) can only be achieved by pharmaceutical interventions, in particular by vaccination. The result of the C 0 -independent number of deaths at the end of the epidemic is suspected to be an artifact of the simplified modeling framework, in which a macroscopic population with an averaged set of parameters is considered. Since mortality rates of individuals are usually strongly dependent on age and health condition, it might be advisable to extend the model and divide the compartments into several age or risk groups as in Refs. [1, 20] . The so-extended model features a matrix-valued transmission rate, which describes the infections caused by contacts within and between different groups, that could be further optimized by intra-and intergroup-specific selective measures. This is, however, beyond the scope of the current paper.",

Optimal control theory has been applied for the scenario in which an effective vaccine will never be found and the epidemic must be controlled with purely non-pharmaceutical measures. The computed optimal transmission rate describes a single-intervention scenario that satisfies two competing constraints: First, the minimization of the disease-related deaths by strictly avoiding an overflow of intensive care resources and, second, the suppression of a second epidemic wave by establishing sufficient natural immunity at the end of the measures. The optimally steered time-continuous non-pharmaceutical intervention ensures that the number of simultaneously infected persons does not exceed a certain threshold for a necessary period of time. Therefore, the optimal control obtained for this scenario is also of considerable interest for other cases, where e.g. a vaccine is expected soon but the number of infected cases must be held below a sufficiently low critical value over a longer period of time until the epidemic can be terminated by a mass vaccination.",

This observation can be exploited to derive a series of algebraic equations (which hold approximately in the initial phase of the epidemic) that relate all state variables to each other.

In mid-March 2020, i.e. near the end of the initial exponential growth phase, the German Interdisciplinary Association for Intensive Care and Emergency Medicine (DIVI) initiated a register that reports on the availability of ICUs in Germany [11] . On March 27, 687 out of 1 160 hospitals with ICUs contributed to the register and reported a total number of 939 COVID-19 patients in a critical state receiving intensive care [31] . At the same day, 253 disease-related deaths were reported. From the estimated ratio C/D \u2248 6.3 (the actual number of critical patients was estimated based on the ratio of contributing and non-contributing hospitals as C \u2248 1 586), the average period after which patients in a critical state either recover or die, is estimated from Eq. (21) as \u03b3 \u22121 c \u2248 7.5 d. Finally, assuming that only r = 2/3 of all cases have been discovered initially and an assumed average time delay between infection and report of cases of \u2206tr = 5 d, the number of actual cases is estimated from the number of reported cases as N est cases (t) = r \u22121 N rep cases (t + \u2206tr) = r \u22121 e \u0393 \u2206tr N rep cases (t) \u2248 5.5 N rep cases (t). This yields a good agreement between the simulated number of cases (Ncases = E + I + H + C + R + D) and N est cases before measures came into force, see Fig. 2 (a) and Fig. 9 . The average time between infection and death \u2206t d can be estimated from the ratio N est cases (t) /D (t) \u2248 2370 (see Fig. 8 The equations for R and D are decoupled and can be solved via direct integration once the solution of the remaining system is known. The corresponding Lagrange multipliers are easily obtained as \u03bb R (t) = 0 and \u03bb D (t) = P. The initial time conditions guarantee u (0) = 1 (no intervention, see Eq.
