This is similar to what was observed during the 2003 outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), which is caused by another member of the coronavirus family, SARS-CoV. In that outbreak, viral RNA was detected in symptomatic patient serum 6 ; however, to date, no blood transfusions have been implicated in viral transmission. 7 It is unclear whether the viral RNA present in serum indicates a possible asymptomatic viremic phase, which could lead to a possible transfusion transmission. Despite the lack of direct evidence of transfusion transmission risk with MERS-CoV and other coronaviruses, MERS-CoV has been identified as an agent that poses an existing or potential threat to blood safety by the AABB. 1 Currently, there are no MERS-CoV-specific screening questions or donor deferral periods recommended by the AABB. 8 The Mirasol Pathogen Reduction Technology (PRT) System was developed to provide an added layer of protection to help prevent the transmission of existing and emerging pathogens, such as MERS-CoV, through the transfusion of human blood products. The Mirasol PRT System is a broad-spectrum pathogen-reduction process that has been shown to effectively reduce the infectivity of blood-borne bacteria, parasites, and viruses. [9] [10] [11] [12] The system combines riboflavin, a photosensitizer, and ultraviolet (UV) light to irreversibly damage nucleic acids in blood products. The resulting DNA/RNA damage prevents pathogens and white blood cells from replicating, but it does not affect nonreplicating cells like platelets or red blood cells; and it maintains acceptable plasma protein quality post-treatment.

The mean >4.4 log reduction in the MERS-CoV titer exceeded the European Committee of Blood Transfusion recommendations stating that, to be considered effective, a pathogen-reduction process should reduce screened pathogens by at least 3 logs. 17 A study conducted by Corman and colleagues indicated that MERS-CoV-infected patients may have viral loads up to 5 or 6 log RNA copies/mL in their serum. 18 However, those authors also indicated that this virus did not appear to be infectious in cell culture, 18 suggesting that transfusion transmission is unlikely.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 158, "end": 159, "text": "1", "ref_id": "BIBREF0"}, {"start": 564, "end": 566, "text": "17", "ref_id": "BIBREF17"}, {"start": 720, "end": 722, "text": "18", "ref_id": "BIBREF18"}, {"start": 826, "end": 828, "text": "18", "ref_id": "BIBREF18"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "DISCUSSION"}, {"text": "Although the observed reduction of MERS-CoV was only evaluated in plasma products, it can safely be assumed to extend to platelet products on the basis of previous research using the Mirasol PRT System. 9 It has been demonstrated that pathogen-reduction systems cause minor changes to platelets that do not compromise the hemostatic efficacy of platelet transfusion; however, they also can decrease the risk of graft-versus-host disease and improve shelf life. 19 Taken together, the results from this study suggest that riboflavin and UV light might be able to reduce the likelihood of MERS-CoV transfusion transmission in both platelet and plasma products should infectious virus be present in blood from an asymptomatic donor. Over 68 pathogens have been identified by the AABB as \"of concern\" for blood safety based on the likelihood of transmission transfusion and clinical disease in the transfusion recipient. 1 The most pressing concerns relate to diseases with known transfusion transmission events and severe or fatal outcomes (e.g., dengue virus, Babesia parasites, and Creutzfeldt-Jakob prions). 1 Targeted screening processes that identify blood products containing potentially transmissible pathogens have markedly improved the overall safety of transfusions. However, although it is rare, transfusion transmission of even well-known pathogens like human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) still occurs in the United States. 20 In resource-limited setting like Africa, as many as 10% to 15% of new HIV cases can be linked to transfusion-transmitted infections. 21 Targeted screening programs are limited in part by the incremental nature of updating the pathogen list and by our knowledge of each pathogen. A recent estimate is that, of the 1407 known human pathogens, 58% are zoonotic, and 13% are considered emerging or re-emerging pathogens. 22 Known pathogens are not the only concern for blood safety: one estimate is that 5.3 novel viruses are discovered each year and that from 60% to 70% of these viruses have animal origins. 1 Targeted screening on this scale is not economically or logistically feasible and cannot keep pace with the emerging threats to blood safety. Pathogenreduction systems have the potential to be a complementary approach to blood screening programs and may have the potential to replace some screening assays, like cytomegalovirus and West Nile virus.
