            "text": "Brome mosaic virus (BMV) is a positive-strand RNA virus that infects cereal plants, causing mosaic symptoms and stunting. BMV is the type member of the genus Bromovirus in the family Bromoviridae. BMV is also a representative member of the alphavirus-like super-family that include viruses infecting human, animal, and plants that share similar genome structures, gene expression strategies, and protein functions. BMV has been used as a model to study gene expression, RNA replication, virus-host interactions, recombination, and encapsidation by positive-strand RNA viruses. Major contributions have revealed insights and principles extending to many other viruses and to general cell biology. Among numerous advances, research in BMV defined the first ribosome binding sites in eukaryotic mRNAs, produced the first eukaryotic viral RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) extract that was template specific, the first infectious transcripts from cloned cDNA, the first engineered RNA virus expression vector expressing foreign genes, the first definition of sub-genomic mRNA synthesis pathways and determinants, and the first demonstration of higher eukaryotic viral replication in yeast. BMV has contributed many insights into virion assembly, virus-host interactions, RNA recombination, and RNA replication, including parallels in the replication of positive-strand RNA, reversetranscribing and dsRNA viruses. crystallography showed that the BMV capsid structure is extremely similar to that of the related bromovirus Cowpea chlorotic mottle virus (CCMV). Intriguingly, some features of these capsids are dissimilar from other known isometric RNA virus capsids, but similar to capsids of the DNA-containing papovaviruses. These features include orientation of the core b-barrel nearly perpendicular to the capsid surface to form distinctively prominent hexameric and pentameric capsomeres, and linking of adjacent capsomere clusters by exchange of invading C-terminal arms. These shared features suggest that BMV CP and the CPs of polyoma-and papillomaviruses likely share a common ancestor. BMV virion RNA is arranged as an interior subshell inside the capsid, leaving a hollow virion center. The N-terminal 26 aa of the CP, which are highly basic and required for RNA packaging, interact with the RNA to neutralize its charge.",

Structural features shared by 120-and 180-subunit capsids imply that a common pentamer of CP dimers is an important intermediate in BMV virion assembly.",

            "text": "In 1971, buoyant density gradients were used to separate BMV virions into three classes, all three have identical capsids but package different RNAs (Fig. 1) . Heavy virions contain a single copy of RNA1 (3.2 kb), medium density virions contain one copy each of RNA3 (2.1 kb) and RNA4 (0.9 kb), and light virions contain a single copy of RNA2 (2.9 kb). The three classes of viral particles are indistinguishable by electron microscopy, however, distinct capsid-RNA contacts influence the stability of the virions, viral RNA release, and BMV infection. Mapping of the contacts made between CP and the viral RNAs showed that RNA1 contacts CP differently than RNA2 or RNA3/4. Virions containing RNA1 were more sensitive to protease digestion and treatment of virions with RNase A revealed that RNA1 was preferentially degraded, while RNA2 or RNA3/4 were more resistant to RNase A digestion. The more facile interaction between RNA1 and the capsid proteins could ensure earlier and higher expression of BMV 1a, which is responsible for the formation of the viral replication compartments (see below in the Section of \"Properties and Functions of Viral Gene Products\"). The interaction of the viral RNAs with capsid is also influenced by the phosphorylation state of the N-terminal arm of the capsid protein. Interestingly, virions produced from different plant hosts had different post-translational modifications that impacted the thermostability of virions as well as the capsid-RNA interactions. Fig. 1 Organization of the Brome mosaic virus (BMV) RNA genome. BMV has three genomic RNAs, RNA1, RNA2, and RNA3, and a sub-genomic mRNA, RNA4, encoded by the 3 0 portion of RNA3 as shown. Each of these four BMV positive-strand RNAs bears a 5 0 m 7 G cap and 3 0 tRNA-like structure (cloverleaf). The recruitment element (RE) in each viral genomic RNA and the promoter of sub-genomic RNA4 (Pro sgRNA ) in RNA3 are shown. Open boxes represent the genes for the viral proteins 1a and 2a pol , which are required for RNA replication, and 3a and coat protein, which are required for systemic movement in host plants. Some specific functions and features of each viral protein are listed, including the amphipathic a-helices at the N-terminus of 1a. The N-terminus (bottom half) and C-terminus (top half) of 1a are labeled as N and C, respectively. BMV 1a interacts with 2a pol via the C-terminus of 1a and the N-terminus of 2a pol .",

RNAs 1, 2, and 4 were characterized as monocistronic while RNA3 is dicistronic. Although early infectivity studies showed that RNA3 encodes CP, tryptic analysis showed that the principle translation product of RNA3 was unrelated to CP, while RNA4 served as an excellent template for CP. Moreover, when mixtures of all BMV RNAs were added to wheat germ extracts, increasing amounts of RNA4 inhibited translation of genomic RNAs 1-3. These results showed that RNA4 is a sub-genomic CP mRNA derived from RNA3, and implied an elegant system of gene regulation by translational competition: early in infection when viral RNA concentrations are low, all viral proteins including nonstructural RNA replication factors are translated, while after the virion RNAs are sufficiently amplified, CP is preferentially translated to encapsidate these RNAs.",

In 1975, the first eukaryotic translation initiation site was characterized by isolating two fragments of BMV RNA4 that were efficiently bound by wheat germ ribosomes. RNA sequencing (a challenging, chromatography-based process at the time) revealed that the two fragments were 5 0 terminal, overlapping, and encoded the first 4 and 14 aa of CP, respectively. The most distinguishing feature was that the initiating AUG codon for CP began only 10 nucleotides from the m 7 G 5 0 ppp 5 0 Gp-capped RNA4 5 0 end, presaging the now well-known mechanistic linkage between most eukaryotic translation initiation and 5 0 mRNA caps.",

Later work discussed below showed that 3a is required for infection movement in plants. Comparisons with other emerging viral RNA and protein sequences quickly revealed that the BMV 1a and 2a proteins, already implicated in RNA replication by protoplast experiments, shared extensive amino acid sequence similarities with proteins encoded by a diverse set of plant and animal positive-strand RNA viruses. These similarities initially were recognized between BMV, Alfalfa mosaic virus, Tobacco mosaic virus and Sindbis virus, and subsequently were found to extend to many other viruses now grouped together as the alphavirus-like super-family. Similarities shared by these viruses include a polymerase domain in BMV 2a (hereafter 2a pol ) and RNA capping and RNA helicase-like domains in 1a (Fig. 1 ).",

BMV RNA 3 0 ends were also found to interact with (ATP, CTP):tRNA nucleotidyl transferase, which can add 3 0 CCA OH ends to mature BMV RNAs or maintain incomplete BMV RNAs, thus acting as a primitive telomerase. Beginning in the 1970s, further sequencing, enzymatic structure probing, and three-dimensional computer modeling showed that the 3 0 B200 nt of all BMV RNAs were strongly conserved and folded into an extended, tRNA-like structure with at least two alternate forms that differed in pairing nucleotides near the 3 0 with local or distal partners.

Deletion analysis revealed that, in addition to 3 0 and 5 0 sequences required for negative-and positive-strand RNA initiation, BMV RNA3 replication in vivo requires a segment of B150 nt in the 5 0 half of the intergenic non-coding region between the 3a and CP genes (Fig. 1) . Subsequent studies showed that this region is required for a step prior to negative-strand RNA synthesis, and is necessary and sufficient for 1a to recognize and recruit an RNA to a membraneassociated, translationally inaccessible, nuclease-resistant state that appears to be the interior of the replication compartments, also known as spherules (see the Section \"BMV 1a and Viral Replication Compartments\"). Structure probing studies show that this intergenic RNA3 sequence folds into a long, bulged stem-loop, which presents at its apex the invariant sequence and structure of tRNA TCC stem-loops. In plant and yeast cells, the appropriate BMV residues in this consensus are modified to T and C, showing that, like the 3 0 end, this sequence interacts in vivo with tRNA-specific enzymes. Moreover, any mutations to this TCC stem-loop mimicry abolish 1a-mediated template recruitment. Similar stem-loops with apical TCC stem-loop regions are found at the extreme 5 0 ends of BMV RNA1 and RNA2, where they similarly direct 1a-mediated template recruitment (Fig. 1) .",

Subsequent work demonstrated many forms and features of inter-and intra-molecular, homologous and non-homologous RNA recombination in BMV. Mutations in BMV RNA replication proteins 1a and 2a pol could alter the frequencies and distributions of crossover sites, implying that at least a significant portion of such recombination was a byproduct of RNA replication, as by template switching. These and other results show that RNA recombination is a major force for repairing BMV genomes damaged by the high mutation rates of viral RNA replication and other events, thereby contributing to BMV survival and adaptability. Subsequently, it was further demonstrated that the recruitment of parental RNAs to a shared replication compartment is a limiting step in intermolecular RNA recombination. These results support a model in which BMV genomic RNAs are individually recruited into replication compartments, and intermolecular recombinants arise only in replication compartments receiving multiple viral RNAs.",
