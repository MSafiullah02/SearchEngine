Empirical treatment regimens use broad-spectrum antimicrobials. Aim: To evaluate the accuracy of the diagnosis of HAP and to describe the demographic and microbiological features of patients with HAP. Methods: Medical and surgical inpatients receiving intravenous antimicrobials for a clinical diagnosis of HAP at a UK tertiary care hospital between April 2013 and 2014 were identified. Demographic and clinical details were recorded. Findings: A total of 166 adult patients with a clinical diagnosis of HAP were identified. Broadspectrum antimicrobials were prescribed, primarily piperacillinetazobactam (57.2%) and co-amoxiclav (12.5%). Sputum from 24.7% of patients was obtained for culture. Sixty-five percent of patients had radiological evidence of new/progressive infiltrate at the time of HAP treatment, therefore meeting HAP diagnostic criteria (2005 American Thoracic Society/ Infectious Diseases Society of America guidelines). Radiologically confirmed HAP was associated with higher levels of inflammatory markers and sputum culture positivity. Previous surgery and/or endotracheal intubation were associated with radiologically confirmed HAP. A bacterial pathogen was identified from 17/35 sputum samples from radiologically confirmed HAP patients. These were Gram-negative bacilli (N \u00bc 11) or Staphylococcus aureus (N \u00bc 6). Gram-negative bacteria tended to be resistant to co-amoxiclav, but susceptible to ciprofloxacin, piperacillinetazobactam and meropenem. Five of the six S. aureus isolates were meticillin susceptible and all were susceptible to doxycycline. Conclusion: In ward-level hospital practice 'HAP' is an over-used diagnosis that may be inaccurate in 35% of cases when objective radiological criteria are applied. Radiologically confirmed HAP represents a distinct clinical and microbiological phenotype. Potential risk factors were identified that could represent targets for preventive interventions.",

            "text": "The syndrome of hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP) is defined as pneumonia occurring in non-intubated patients !48 h after hospitalization, and therefore not incubating at the time of admission. 1 This is distinct from ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), which is defined as pneumonia occurring after 48e72 h of mechanical ventilation in an intubated patient. HAP may be suspected if a patient develops new symptoms and signs consistent with respiratory tract infection (fever, abnormal chest examination, purulent sputum, tachypnoea, impaired oxygenation) and laboratory results consistent with inflammation (raised white cell count and Creactive protein). However, the diagnosis of HAP also requires radiological demonstration of a new or progressive lung infiltrate. 1 American Thoracic Society/Infectious Diseases Society of America (ATS/IDSA) guidelines for the management of HAP highlight Gram-negative bacilli as frequently occurring pathogens in HAP and Staphylococcus aureus as an emerging cause. Much of the literature that has been used to describe the aetiology of HAP relates to VAP, nosocomial pneumonia occurring specifically in the intensive care unit (ICU) or nursinghome-acquired pneumonia. 1e6 Overall, more is known about the pathogenesis and microbiology of VAP, facilitated by the ease of obtaining deep respiratory samples by bronchoalveolar lavage in intubated patients. Importantly, there are evidencebased 'care bundles' to prevent VAP, but not HAP. 7 Empirical treatment of HAP aims to include cover for nosocomial pathogens, especially Gram negative bacteria, therefore it necessitates using broad-spectrum agents such as coamoxiclav and piperacillinetazobactam, with the attendant risks of antibiotic-associated diarrhoea, C. difficile infection, selection for antimicrobial resistance in patient and environmental flora and also high costs. An accurate diagnosis of HAP is therefore essential to ensure appropriate use of these antimicrobials.",

The pathogenesis of HAP may therefore often be related to microaspiration of oropharyngeal contents around the cuff of an endotracheal (ET) tube in paralysed intubated patients during surgery, without necessarily a prolonged period of mechanical ventilation such as during critical illness (i.e. VAP). In a systematic literature review of airway management strategies to reduce the incidence of VAP in critically ill ventilated patients in the ICU, interventions including continuous aspiration of subglottic secretions using a special ET tube (vs standard ET tubes) and the use of heat and moisture exchangers have been shown to lower VAP rates. 8 In a separate study, persistent ET tube cuff pressure of <20 cmH 2 O was also associated with risk of VAP. 9 Such interventions could also be evaluated in intubated patients undergoing surgery. Similarly, in critically ill ventilated patients, oral hygiene with chlorhexidine mouthwash has been shown to reduce rates of VAP, and has been included as a component of a successfully evaluated 'VAP care bundle'. 7,10 Chlorhexidine mouthwash would be an inexpensive measure for use in the immediate pre-and postoperative period for surgical patients. Oral care (chlorhexidine mouthwash or mechanical cleaning) was shown to be associated with a reduced relative risk of pneumonia in a metaanalysis incorporating non-ventilated hospital inpatients and nursing home residents (though there was a high risk of bias in included studies). 11 Other postoperative factors likely to be important in development of HAP include being bed-bound, having reduced chest wall movement (and therefore reduced clearance of secretions) due to pain or being drowsy secondary to opiate analgesics.",

A phenotype has been described in ventilated ICU patients with respiratory signs but no infiltrate on chest imaging, labelled nosocomial tracheobronchitis. 12 This has been associated with longer ICU admission and ventilation times but prospective data describing the necessity for antimicrobials are lacking. 12 Further study of this phenotype in non-intubated patients may be valuable and it may account for some of the cases in this study without radiological changes consistent with HAP. Non-infective alternatives include atelectasis, pulmonary embolism, and underlying lung disease, such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (present in 27.1% of patients treated for HAP in this study) and asthma. Unwell patients labelled as 'HAP' may have a subdiaphragmatic cause of sepsis resulting in the clinical findings. Given the demonstrated difficulty in reaching a reliable clinical diagnosis of HAP, microbiological testing to confirm an infective aetiology becomes even more important, but a sputum sample was obtained from only 24.7% of patients treated for HAP. This low rate may reflect the difficulty in obtaining a suitable deep specimen from non-intubated patients with a degree of respiratory distress or weakness. In such patients biomarkers of pulmonary infection would be helpful in establishing the likelihood of an infective aetiology and justifying the use of empirical antimicrobials prior to culture results.",

In the remainder of cases where a sputum sample was obtained, the result was 'no growth', 'respiratory commensals' or 'yeasts'. Antimicrobial resistance was significant, with most Gram-negative isolates displaying resistance to amoxicillin and co-amoxiclav, but susceptibility to piperacillinetazobactam. However, the overall number of sputum cultures obtained from patients was low, reducing the utility of these data in describing the microbiology of HAP. In addition, we recognize the potential for contamination of sputum samples with oropharyngeal colonizers. This is an important issue, especially considering the prescription of broad-spectrum antimicrobials to cover the susceptibility pattern of these pathogens, but pragmatically one would aim to cover these species if they were identified in a sputum sample from a patient with HAP. As discussed above, the inability to routinely obtain deep respiratory tract specimens (e.g. BAL) from non-intubated patients hinders microbiological diagnosis in HAP. The largest report on the microbiology of HAP comes from a retrospective cohort study of a US inpatient database of patients with culture-positive pneumonia, including 835 patients with HAP. 14 Here, S. aureus accounted for 47.1% of cases, Pseudomonas spp. 18.4%, Klebsiella spp. 7.1%, Haemophilus spp. 5.6%, E. coli 4.7%, Enterobacter spp. 4.3%, and Acinetobacter spp. 2.0%. Overall, Gram-negative pathogens were isolated from 45.8% of HAP cases. A complicating factor in conventional culture-based testing of samples from patients with suspected HAP is the fact they will most likely already have received antimicrobials prior to sampling, impairing sensitivity of pathogen detection using culture-based techniques. A qPCR test for detection and quantification of eight key bacterial causes of pneumonia (including S. aureus, E. coli and P. aeruginosa) from sputum samples has recently been described and could represent a useful tool for the investigation of suspected HAP. 15 Only six (5.6%) patients with HAP had throat swabs obtained for qPCR respiratory virus and M. pneumoniae testing and in all cases these were negative. Nosocomial influenza can account for a significant proportion of influenza cases (17.3% in a Canadian surveillance programme). 16 Using admission to critical care wards as a marker, the 2013/14 influenza season in Scotland was similar to the preceding year with no significant increase in cases. 17 However, the lack of consistent testing for influenza virus in patients with HAP precludes any conclusions about the incidence of nosocomial influenza causing HAP during the study period, or the utility of respiratory virus/mycoplasma testing in the work-up of suspected HAP.",

In cases where HAP is suspected clinically but the chest X-ray does not show a new/progressive lung infiltrate, there may be a role for CT scanning. In addition, there is emerging evidence for the role of lung ultrasound for the detection of pulmonary infiltrates in CAP, with some data suggesting superiority over chest X-ray when compared to CT as a gold standard. 21, 22 A further limitation lies in the casee control analysis performed, which should be repeated in the future with a control cohort of hospital inpatients with no clinical suspicion of HAP.
