To simplify the procedure modification was recommended with one critical concentration of drug and 1% proportion. A culture which shows less than 1% growth on a medium containing a test drug as compared growth on the control is considered as susceptible while 1% or more growth is considered as resistant for clinical purpose.

The asexual biological cycle of the human parasite Strongyloides stercoralis in the body of the human host leads to continuous auto-infestation lasting for decades or even for the whole life. In case of immune depression, the auto-infestation cycle accelerates with the production o fan increasing number of larvae mainly within the intestinal or respiratory tracts (hyper-infestation). The clinical onset of Strongyloides hyper-infestation may be acute or sub-acute, with malaise and asthenia. In case of fever, bacterial co-infection should be suspected. Gastrointestinal symptoms are exacerbated and may be complicated by intestinal ulcerations with melena and presence of rabditoides and filarioides larvae in the ulcers and in the stools.

These non-antimicrobial functions are thought to contribute to the in vivo antimicrobial activity of AMPs that has been demonstrated in a variety of animal models. However, excessive production of AMPs may contribute to inflammation. Current studies indicate that not only production, but also local factors (host and pathogen-derived) that regulate the activity of AMPs are important for their role in host defence.

Simultaneously to this trend of laboratories concentration, has raised the need for performing the microbiological diagnosis within the time of care \u2013 i.e. in less than 3 hours, which is asked more and more frequently by clinicians. We have set up the Point-of-Care laboratories which perform a definite number of microbiological analyses in less than 3 hours which result must modify the medical management of patients in terms of hospitalization, isolation and prescription of specific anti-infectious drugs. In conclusion, our laboratories must advance in two complementary directions: first is fusing into large core-laboratories in order to make cost-effective routine diagnosis in large series, to set up new diagnostic protocols, to ensure the staff training and to give a place for innovation and development of new tools and techniques; the second is the spread-out of Point-of-Care laboratories including the Remote Point-of-Care laboratories remaining under the responsibility and the supervision of the Core-Laboratory staff by using the new communication technologies.",

The key drivers for this shift of technology are the high sensitivity of TaqMan\u00ae probe based Real-time PCR Assays and also the ability to multiplex several assays in one reaction vessel. Here we introduce microfluidic tools (branded TaqMan\u00ae Array Cards) that allow the simultaneous detection of up to 384 pathogens in one sample. The validation of one application of this technology, the \u201cTaqMan Array Human Viral Screening Card\u201d, will be documented in this study. We first tested a panel of \u2018real-time\u2019 quantitative PCR (qPCR) reagents for their specificity and sensitivity using 96well plates. Single tube TaqMan\u00ae Assays were designed against conserved regions of BKV, JCV, HIV-1, HIV-2, HTLV-I, HTLV-II, HCV, HBV, HPV-16, SV40, HHV7, CMV, Adenovirus C, HSV-1, HSV-2 and HHV4 genomes.",

In summary, all tested assays showed excellent linearity and efficiency with a very high degree of specificity for their targets. No cross-reactivity was detected between assays of viruses belonging to the same family. TaqMan Assays for 15 pathogen targets plus one internal positive control are pre-loaded on the TaqMan Array Human Viral Screening Cards allowing the simultaneous assessment of these targets in triplicate amplifications from 8 samples in parallel. We tested sensitivity and specificity using both artificial templates and nucleic acid extracted from cell cultures infected with those viruses on these cards. Again, all TaqMan Assays showed excellent linearity and efficiency and a very high degree of specificity for their targets, even in such a small reaction volume (2 ml). In conclusion, the TaqMan Array Human Viral Screening Cards will be used as invaluable tools in ensuring that for example human ES cell cultures, particularly from novel sources, are pathogen-free. Moreover, additional TaqMan Array Cards for the screening & detection of viruses, bacteria and parasites are currently under development and will be made available in the coming year.",

Infection prevention has become a keystone in reducing the spread of hypertransmittable multiresistant microorganisms and in consequence maintaining the effectiveness of antibiotic treatment. In this sense, infection prevention includes by far more than measures to avoid transmission, but also the rational use of antibiotics. Independently from the species involved, it is about facultative pathogenic bacteria of different virulence and different epidemic power that are colonizing patients and spreading in hospitals or the community. Molecular epidemiology showed that most of the MRSA infections are caused by a few epidemic clonal lineages. Although transmission dynamics is not fully understood, today 3 major transmission ways are accepted, reflecting the transmission dynamics of hospital-, community- and livestock-MRSA. As the ha-MRSA seem to follow their carriers, analysis of patient movements showed that MRSA spread inter-institutionally within a healthcare region. This becomes even more evident in border regions, where some MRSA seem not to cross the border other, but ha-MRSA seems not to do so. The difference of MRSA-prevalence between the adjacent regions in Germany and the Netherlands find here one possible explanation. A Dutch\u2013German quality network (www.mrsa-net.eu) was set up in 2005 comprising hospitals, GPs, labs, public health services and patient interest groups. Its main objective is the MRSA prevention in the border area. In 2007, screening of risk patients become part of an external quality assurance for the hospitals supervised by the public health authorities. In parallel, a 12-month MRSA decolonisation-management was introduced for all GPs in order to reduce MRSA carriership in the regional population. Since 2009, the activities are being extended to the whole Dutch\u2013German border region (www.eursafety).",

In addition to their ecological importance, it is now clear that many marine bacteria are themselves potential human pathogens, and that these bacteria are also a huge reservoir of genes encoding virulence factors and antibiotic resistance. In this review we show that some virulence factors of marine bacteria, as toxins, hemolysins and siderophore biosynthesis are encoded by mobile DNA elements and that some of them can be horizontally transmitted, not only to marine bacteria but also to other animal and human pathogens. As a model we have been studying Photobacterium damselae, a Vibrionaceae member widespread in the marine environment, that includes two subspecies, subsp. piscicida and subsp. damselae. The subsp. piscicida is the causative agent of fish pasteurellosis. Subsp. damselae affects a variety of marine animals and is also an opportunistic human pathogen, being reported clinical cases with fatal outcome. We have described in these bacteria several mobile genetic elements that encode virulence factors and antibiotic resistance. In this regard, we have demonstrated that siderophore biosynthesis in subsp. piscicida is encoded by a gene cluster which is part of a pathogenicity island (PAI) closely similar to a Yersinia enterocolitica PAI, that has also homologues in V. cholerae strains. This cluster encodes the biosynthesis, transport and utilization of a siderophore that has a relevant role in the pathogenicity of subsp. piscicida. This PAI is part of a 70 kb mobilizable plasmid (pPHDP70). Moreover, we showed that some strains of subsp. piscicida possess an ICE element of the SXT family, first reported in V. cholerae, that encodes tetracycline resistance and that can promote the mobilization of other genetic elements such as the virulence plasmids pPHDP10 and pPHDP70. We found that similar ICE elements are also present in a significant proportion in other marine vibrios. Besides antibiotic resistance, some ICE elements also encode heavy metals resistance. Other virulence factor encoded within a mobile element in P. damselae is the synthesis of hemolysins. A conjugative plasmid of 150 kb encodes two hemolysins, damselysin and HlyA, which greatly contribute to the virulence of this bacterium to fish and mice. We were able to demonstrate that some of these elements can be horizontally transmitted by conjugation to other animal and human bacterial pathogens.",

These can have severe impacts on both productivity and their welfare. Despite the development in recent years of improved vaccines that effectively control some important diseases, such as furunculosis in Atlantic salmon, antimicrobials are still used to control many conditions. These are typically applied either in feed or direct to the culture water, with varying levels of controls in place to control their useage in different countries worldwide. This use of antimicrobials has very likely driven the development of resistance in the bacteria associated with farmed fish and shellfish. As well as posing a threat to the sustainability of the use of these important chemotherapeutants to treat infected fish, there is also concern that much of this resistance is encoded by so-called \u2018mobile\u2019 genetic elements that transfer the genes from otherwise harmless types of bacteria. Together with the resistance genes, come a whole host of genes of unknown function which may confer an entirely different selectable phenotype. The reservoir of genes which transfer under the selective pressure of antibiotic usage in the aquatic environment is largely unknown. A large body of scientific evidence shows that bacteria harbouring these mobile AMR genes are widely disseminated, and often at high prevalence, in all environments studied to date (e.g. soil, mining waste, livestock production sites, water treatment effluent, marine and freshwater water column and sediment samples). The potential threat that these environmental \u2018reservoirs\u2019 of mobile AMR genes pose to human and animal (including fish) health has not yet been ascertained, but is likely to be considerable.

            "text": "Due to persistent frustrations following experimental approaches aimed to target inflammatory mediators in sepsis, it is now proposed that the anti-inflammatory phase should be targeted with drugs able to boost immunity. It is certainly appealing, but might still consist in treating a consequence, or a symptom of the syndrome, rather than the cause. Immunodepression, prior to the septic episode, is clearly a risk factor for mortality, as determined by many epidemiological studies performed during sepsis in humans. However, whether the modification of the immune status following sepsis or non-infectious systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS), known as \u201ccompensatory anti-inflammatory response syndrome\u201d (CARS), has serious consequences in terms of survival, remains debatable. Of course, the increased frequency of nosocomial infections in intensive care units (ICU), may have led to some deaths, but those late deaths cannot explain the initial high mortality of septic shock. In animal models, preventing apoptosis of immune cells or boosting immune cells have been shown to be protective. But before dying from anergy and apoptosis of their immune cells, don't patients rather die from shock, organ failure and ultimately from nosocomial infections or withdrawal from intensive care? In addition, alteration of immune cells has been mainly demonstrated in human blood and murine lymphoid organs, but immune cells within the other tissues might not be deactivated. For example, lung neutrophils are activated in murine hemorrhagic shock or endotoxinemia, whereas this is not the case for blood neutrophils. Or, in contrast to any other mononuclear phagocytes, murine alveolar macrophages cannot be rendered tolerant to endotoxin, while endotoxin tolerance has often been suggested to partially mimic the state of hyporeactivity of circulating immune cells. Finally, even for circulating cells, the alteration of their reactivity is not a global defect, but rather a reprogramming that maintains certain functions intact while down-regulating others, particularly, those involved in inflammation. Indeed, all organs are affected by the systemic inflammatory process, and behave specifically to the insult. In sepsis and SIRS there is not a pro-inflammatory response followed by an anti-inflammatory one, but rather both events are concomitant and compartmentalized. This rendered the therapeutic approach quite challenging, and should therefore be taken into consideration.",

The most common species of Aspergillus causing human disease are Aspergillus fumigatus, A. flavus, A. niger, and A. terreus. There is no \u201cgold standard\u201d test for the diagnosis of IA, and detection currently requires data from clinical and radiological sources and from mycology and histopathology where feasible. Diagnosis is complex and problematic and can only be confirmed by identification of the fungus in biopsy samples. Capturing tissue for diagnosis is in itself hazardous, and because of this many patients receive empirical antifungal treatment rather than undergo biopsy. Attempts have been made to develop specific and sensitive diagnostic tests that can be used to track the early onset of infection. Detection of one such signature molecule, galactomannan (and associated galactomannoprotein molecules), forms the basis of the commercial Platelia enzyme immunoassay (EIA), an assay that has found widespread use in IA diagnosis. Specificity of the GM test ranges from 66% to 100% and sensitivity from 57% to 100%. The reasons for variability in performance likely encompass both biological and epidemiological factors; including prophylactic and empirical antifungal therapies that compromise the sensitivity of the GM immunoassay: alternative strategies to diagnosis have been sought including detection of the fungal cell wall component (1,3)-b-D-glucan and polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Detection of BG relies on its ability to activate factor G of the horseshoe crab coagulation cascade. While these tests display sufficient sensitivity, they lack sufficient specificity or suffer from interference under certain conditions. The kinetics of GM, BG, and DNA release are less easily established in vivo, but comparisons of the diagnostic potential of PCR, the Platelia GM immunoassay and BG tests have been undertaken in patients with hematological disorders, with contrasting results. The \u201cone assay-fits-all\u201d approach to IA diagnostics is unrealistic and accurate diagnosis will necessarily rely on complementary diagnostic approaches.",

The choice of typing targets allows easy and unambiguous genotyping. The real-time PCR format without the use of expensive fluorescent labeled probes makes this approach far more accessible than methods currently in use. Furthermore, compared to existing genotyping methods, the new approach is extremely simple, fast and economical. The diversity index evaluated on a collection of >200 isolates of various origin was 0.985. This means that there is a chance of only 1.5% that any two randomly tested isolates yield the same genotype.

In patients with candidemia, early initiation of antifungal treatment is desirable, because it is associated with better outcome. The nonspecific clinical presentation of candidemia and the increasing number of antifungal-resistant isolates may lead to a delay in the initiation of adequate therapy. Therefore, efforts to improve the diagnosis of candidemia and to reduce the time to detecting antifungal-resistant Candida isolates are warranted. Widespread use of sensitive and specific strategies (eg, PCR-based procedures) able to decrease time to diagnosis of candidemia is still hampered by the lack of standardization. Real-time PCR to detect Candida DNA in blood samples from high-risk patients is promising due to its high analytical sensitivity and low inter-sample cross-contamination. In addition, few species of Candida have been included in the panel of detectable microorganisms of some marketed real-time PCR systems.

ClyS is bioengineered to contain a staphylococcus-specific catalytic domain fused to a unique cell wall targeting domain.

Some strains that produce \u03b2-lactamases are susceptible or intermediate to 3rd or 4th generation cephalosporins with these breakpoints and should be reported as found, i.e. the presence or absence of an ESBL does not in itself influence the categorization of susceptibility.\u201d",

Moreover, pneumococcal serotypes appeared to differ between S-AOM and M-AOM.

Similar trends have been observed in Italy, where PCV7 has also been found to be effective in the prevention of AOM and CAP and in reducing the number of antibiotic prescriptions.3 The potential benefits of vaccination could be taken into account in clinical guidelines for the management of RTIs, in terms of lessening the indiscriminate use of antibiotics and lessening selective pressure for resistance.4 Similar to other European countries, various attempts have been made in Italy to define the most appropriate ways to manage RTIs. Recently this gap was filled by the Italian Society of Pediatrics, which coordinated the preparation of the national Italian Multidisciplinary guideline for AOM;5 a similar guideline for CAP is currently underway. These guidelines are based on the broad participation of representatives of different specialties (paediatricians, otolaryngologists, pharmacologists, allergologists, microbiologists, etc.) and are aimed at translating the newly acquired knowledge on RTIs, antibiotic resistance and the consequences of old and new pneumococcal vaccines into precise recommendations for clinical practice, also taking into account the peculiarities of microbiological data in the Italian setting.",

Human travel and globalisation aside, the relentless evolving of bacteria to MDR, and some pan-drug resistance, status is a direct result of the bacteria's ability to mobilise and ultimately share DNA, a phenomenon called horizontal gene transfer which occurs considerably more frequently in Gram-negative bacteria. Intrinsic to this DNA plasticity are transposable elements; mobile sections of DNA capable of moving themselves and adjacent DNA which in this case involves antibiotic resistance genes. The emergence of MDR in the early clinical isolates was due to the fact that genetic engineering tools and resistance mechanisms were already present at the beginning of the antibiotic era of the 1950's and 1960's. In the 1970's MDR was determined in many cases to be associated with transmissible plasmids and transposons, and in 1989 the class 1 integron was first described. The resistance genes carried by these elements have also evolved in response to increasingly broader-spectrum antibiotics e.g. TEM-1 in the 1960's to NDM-1 in 2010. However, even before the introduction of sulpha drugs and penicillin, the use of mercury in industry, agriculture and medicine probably aided and abetted the establishment of mercury resistance transposons e.g. Tn21 that are now prevalent and mobilise MDR regions.",

The antibiotic susceptibility of C. difficile strains, including epidemic clones, is changing. Most of the prevalent types responsible for disease in humans were resistant to clindamycin and/or erythromycin due to an ermB gene encoding for an rRNA methyltransferase, whereas, currently, we are observing an increase in the number of resistant ermB-negative C. difficile isolates, including the epidemic strain C. difficile BI/NAP1/027. Resistance to tetracycline has also been observed in both historic and recent isolates. Tetracycline resistance is commonly conferred by a tet(M) gene that encodes for a ribosomal protection protein. This gene is usually carried by a Tn5397 transposon, but recent strains can harbour elements belonging to the Tn916 family, which are widely dispersed in Gram-positive and negative bacteria. Moreover, C. difficile clinical isolates resistant to fluoroquinolones have recently appeared and their number is on the rise too. In particular, resistance rate to moxifloxacin has increased dramatically over the last years due to amino acid substitutions in the DNA gyrase subunits GyrA or GyrB. The current standard treatment for C. difficile infection is oral metronidazole or vancomycin, the latter as the antibiotic of choice for severe cases. Few C. difficile strains resistant to metronidazole have been described in the world, but recently an increase in minimum inhibitory concentrations and heteroresistance have been observed. The exact mechanism of reduced susceptibility to metronidazole remains to be determined since this pathogen does not show nitroimidazole genes, commonly associated with this resistance in other bacteria. Antibiotic resistance is important in infection, as it would provide C. difficile a competitive growth advantage in the gut of patients after antibiotic treatment. A comprehensive picture of different phenotypic and molecular characteristics of the antibiotic resistance in a very large sample of clinical isolates collected during an European survey of C. difficile infection will be presented.",

The occurrence and spread of resistance to imipenem and metronidazole among Bacteroides strains, and their expression mechanisms, merit special clinical attention. The presence of the cfiA gene responsible for carbapenem resistance is much more prevalent than the expression of high-level imipenem resistance. Nim genes are responsible for the metronidazole resistance.

            "text": "Since 2007, the Netherlands has experienced the largest Q fever outbreak ever. From 2007 till today more than 4000 patients have been reported. Q fever is a zoonosis caused by Coxiella burnetii that occurs worldwide. The most common animal reservoirs are goats, sheep and cattle. These animals, when infected, shed the bacteria in urine, feces, milk and birth products. C. burnetii is a highly infectious bacterium. Humans are infected by inhalation of contaminated aerosols or ingestion of contaminated milk or milk products. Diagnosis is based on serological tests and PCR's. Infection may lead to asymptomatic seroconversion (60%), acute disease (40%) or chronic infection (1\u20132% in NL). In the Dutch outbreak, an association with intense goat farming was suggested. One MLVA type of C. burnetii prevails on Q fever-positive dairy goat and diary sheep farms, indicating clonal spread. The outbreak prompted preventive regulations: Hygiene measures were instituted on farms, a ban of the spread of manure was issued, vaccination of goats was ordered, testing for C. burnetii in bulk milk was started, breeding on infected farms was prohibited and finally all pregnant goats and sheep on infected farms were culled. The decreasing numbers of human cases in 2010 might indicate that these measures have been effective. Special attention was paid to infected pregnant women concerning treatment during pregnancy and hygiene measures during birth. A retrospective study showed so far no significant correlation of seropositivity for Q fever during early pregnancy and adverse pregnancy outcome. In the Netherlands blood donations are not regularly tested for the presence of C. burnetii and/or antibodies against the bacteria. A prevalence study is ongoing.",

Firstly, the techniques of molecular genotyping, based on the sequence, allow defining the microbial groups showing that if all species must be associated with chronic infections, only a selected group of species appear to be causing acute Q fever. This chromosomal genotyping is coherent with the genotyping plasmid. In addition, the availability of the genome made it possible to do genomotyping which finds the same classification. This genotyping made it possible to identify Coxiella burnetii on the strain level and this type of genotyping was set up in order to show the clonality of the epidemic currently prevailing in the Netherlands. On the epidemiologic level, the genomotyping made it possible to highlight that a group of bacteria was specifically related to the ticks, and which found in this group all the bacteria found in the hard ticks, but also isolates obtained in animals or humans. It appears, based on this work, that the role of the ticks in the epidemiology of Coxiella burnetii was underestimated. Lastly, the study of the genome made it possible to do exhaustive proteomic studies and to define the best conditions allowing in vitro culture. This work made it possible to determine that Coxiella burnetii was microaerophilic, and that its medium had to be supplemented, which brought to the realization of axenic mediums now allowing the easier culture of Coxiella burnetii.",

It has been the most frequent cause of infectious complications after solid organ transplantation with all subsequent immunosuppressive regimens. In seronegative recipients, latently infected allografts and leukocyte containing blood products are documented means of virus transmission. Among pre-transplant CMV seropositive transplant recipients, CMV infection may occur after reactivation of latent infection or after reinfection. Active CMV infection occurs during the first three months after transplantation and may be accompanied by a broad spectrum of disease manifestations. The primary infection is usually more severe than reactivation or superinfection. Antiviral prophylaxis and preemptive therapy are similarly effective in preventing CMV disease after transplantation. However, current guidelines prefer antiviral prophylaxis over pre-emptive therapy in preventing CMV disease in high-risk SOT recipients. Antiviral prophylaxis is preferred due to the potential benefit of reducing not only the incidence of CMV disease, but also the indirect effects of CMV on allograft and patient survival. The major drawback of antiviral prophylaxis is delayed-onset CMV disease which has been significantly associated with allograft loss and mortality. Pre-emptive therapy consists of weekly laboratory monitoring to detect CMV in the blood using quantitative PCR, prior to the onset of symptoms. Once CMV is detected, pre-emptive therapy is initiated to prevent the progression of asymptomatic infection to clinical disease. The potential advantage of pre-emptive therapy is the exposure of the host's immune system to CMV, thereby allowing earlier CMV-specific T-cell reconstitution, which could potentially explain the very low rates of late-onset CMV disease with this approach. The success of pre-emptive therapy is highly dependent on the consistency of collecting weekly specimens and the predictive value of the assay used. Undetectable viraemia should be achieved prior to discontinuation of therapy in order to reduce the risk of virological relapse.",

Full PSA showed that within the usual willingness to pay threshold, neither screening with isolation nor decolonisation were cost-effective. This reflects the fact fewer infections in GM wards are due to cross-transmission and, because infection and mortality rates are much lower, interventions that depend on expensive screening are much less likely to be cost-effective. However, our results are likely to underestimate intervention benefit as they ignore QALY loss due to MRSA following ward discharge and long-term effects.",

            "text": "Serious infection is a common reason for patient admission into critical care and frequently arises as a complication during a patient's stay in the intensive care unit (ICU). Within the hospital environment, staphylococci are the most prevalent Gram-positive pathogens, with Staphylococcus aureus being a leading cause of infections in the ICU. Currently, the prevalence of infections with methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) is unacceptably high in many parts of Europe, although changes in infection control strategies have reduced incidences in some countries. To optimise clinical outcomes in patients with serious infections, it is necessary to initiate appropriate antibacterial therapy, using antibacterial agents with efficacy against all key pathogens including multidrug-resistant strains, administered at correct doses and via correct routes. Strains of S. aureus that exhibit reduced glycopeptide susceptibility, such as vancomycin intermediate S. aureus (VISA) and heterogeneous VISA, increase the risk of poor clinical outcomes. In cases of Gram-positive infections that are non-susceptible to established antibacterials, the implications for patient care are significant due to the increased risks of treatment failure, increased duration of hospitalisation, increased mortality, and increased costs. In addition, there are worrying signs that resistance to newer anti-staphylococcal agents is emerging among MRSA and other staphylococci. Optimising antibiotic use is therefore important, and can be achieved through effective multidisciplinary cooperation between clinicians, infectious disease specialists, hospital pharmacists and medical microbiologists. Increasing attention has also been paid to antimicrobial stewardship and antibacterial heterogeneity as strategies for optimising outcomes for patients, minimising the risks of toxicity, and the emergence of resistance. Inherent within this strategy is an even greater need for a wider choice of anti-Gram-positive agents of different classes or mechanisms of action to reduce selective pressure and the risk of resistance development. To enable this and to provide physician reassurance and optimal outcomes in seriously-ill patients, novel and potent antibacterial agents are needed. Potential future options for the treatment of serious Gram-positive infections in severely ill patients may be found in new antibacterial classes, such as the lipoglycopeptides.",

            "text": "Worldwide about 350 million people are chronically infected with HBV and are at risk of developing liver cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma. The detection of HBsAg in the serum of patients is a corner stone in the diagnosis of HBV. Additionally antibodies against the viral HBsAg are associated with immunity towards viral infection either induced by exposure to HBV or by HBV vaccination. In recent years numerous cases of vaccination failure of newborns born to chronically HBV infected mothers have been reported. Most often mutations in the HBsAg of HBV lead to this immunoescape and could also hamper the detection of HBsAg by diagnostic screening assays. Diagnostic escape can cause severe complications, since the HBV diagnosis might be delayed and/or the risk of HBV transmission might be overseen (like the risk of mother to child transmission at birth or during surgery). Therefore it is mandatory for diagnostic assays used for HBsAg screening not only to be highly specific and sensitive but also to tolerate HBsAg variability of clinical isolates. Even though the frequency of HBsAg mutants causing vaccination and/or immunoescape is still a matter of debate, there is evidence that these mutations are not only selected in patients failing HBV vaccination. The same HBsAg mutantions are frequently observed in patients receiving aHBs antibody immunoglobulin therapy after liver transplantion. Due to the overlapping reading frame of the HBsAg and viral polymerase mutations selected by antiviral treatment with nucleot(s)ide analoga can also lead to changes in the HBsAg sequence. Moreover it was shown that mutations previously associated with immunoescape in the HBsAg might also be compensatory in the polymerase reading frame of drug resistant HBV isolates. Newer antiviral treatment regimens for HBV currently provide the opportunity of sustained viral suppression in the majority of HBV infected patients without the selection of drug resistance. However, worldwide efficient antiviral treatment of HBV is limited by HIV coinfection, the accessibility of the newer drugs and higher costs. HBsAg screening assays have to take care of the probably increasing sequence variability of clinical HBV isolates selected by the antiviral therapy and the immune system.",

Once inside the phagocytes, some micro-organisms acquired the capacity to resist to the intracellular destruction. The protists feed microorganisms, and some microorganisms worked out mechanisms which allowed them, while resisting to the phagocytic protists, to resist to the macrophages later on or to even become potentially disease-causing agents. Inside these phagocytic protists, a microbial community is seen which comprise bacteria, but also giant viruses and eukaryotes, of which fungi. This community life (sympatry) allows exchanging of genes.

Surface colonization crucially depends on biofilm formation, representing the key virulence mechanism of S. epidermidis. The 220 kDa accumulation associated protein (Aap) mediates intercellular adhesion and biofilm formation after proteolytic processing and exposure of repetitive domain B. In order to function as an intercellular adhesin, Aap domain B must interact with surface structures on neighbouring cells. Therefore, the aim of this study was to identify Aap domain B ligands involved in intercellular adhesion. To this end we used recombinant Aap domain B to affinity purify binding partners from crude preparations of S. epidermidis surface proteins. Amongst other candidates mass spectrometry identified a protein with so far unknown function which we refer to as the Aap associated Staphylococcus epidermidis adhesin (AaStrA). AaStrA is a 20 kDa protein which possesses an N-terminal export motive, but lacks homologies to other proteins with known function. Analysis of interactions using recombinant proteins in solid phase ELISA and ligand blotting experiments validated specificity of Aap domain B\u2013AaStrA interactions. In addition, independent t from Aap, AaStrA bound to the staphylococcal cell surface, induced bacterial aggregation and biofilm formation. These data suggest that AaStrA itself is a bona fide intercellular adhesin. aastra is widespread in clinical significant S. epidermidis isolates from catheter-related blood stream and prosthetic joint infections. Moreover, AaStrA-specific antibodies were detected in sera from patients with infections related to aastra-positive S. epidermidis isolates, indicating that AaStrA is produced in vivo. In conclusion we here identified a novel cell surface protein involved in S. epidermidis biofilm formation contributing to implant associated infections, giving noel evidence that protein dependent biofilm formation results from specific protein\u2013protein interactions.",

The first target will be to develop vaccines for meningococcal meningitis, which is perhaps the last disease that in a few hours can attack and kill healthy children and young people, and RSV that affects virtually every single child in the first few months of life. Fortunately, thanks to several revolutionary technologies developed during the last 30 years, including conjugation, genomics and new adjuvants, we are in the final stages to conquer meningococcal meningitis and new approaches are being tested for RSV. The second and perhaps most important target of vaccination in the 21st century will be to take care of the global health problems of this century. These include taking care of the aging population, with new vaccines targeting the diseases typical of the elderly with an aging immune system, to control emerging antibiotic resistance, to preventing cancer, taking care of the diseases present only in countries affected by poverty, and taking care of emerging diseases such as pandemic influenza. Overall, vaccines in the 21st century will have an increased safety, and will be used as an insurance to ensure health across all ages, for the entire life.",

Evidence of the role microbiota plays in obesity is primarily based on comparisons between germ-free and conventional mice showing that germ-free mice have 40% less body fat, and that conventionalization with the caecum microbiota causes a 60% increase in body fat and insulin resistance. Observational studies comparing the gut microbiota of obese and lean subjects have led to establish associations between obesity and specific phyla and bacterial groups. Although, there is not full consensus, several studies have associated obesity with reduced proportions of Bacteroidetes and increased Firmicutes, and weight loss in obese human subjects with increases in Bacteroidetes or Bacteroides subgroups. Observational studies on the relationships between bacteria used as probiotics for humans (Lactobacillus and Bifidobacterium) and obesity have, however, yielded conflicting results or no associations. In addition, the use of probiotics as growth promoters in farm animals has led part of the scientific community to attribute to these bacteria an obesogenic role. Nevertheless, the effect of probiotics on animal weight-gain can be secondary to suppression of infections and no primary role in obesity has been proven; this is supported by the fact that probiotic administration is not accompanied by increases in body fat, which would be expected from an obesity promoter. Moreover, most interventions conducted in infants and children indicate that probiotics do not influence growth, except for a few cases of undernourished children or those suffering infections. Conversely, other scientists are exploring the possibility that probiotic bacteria help in the management of obesity and associated disorders by regulating the host's metabolic and immune functions. So far evidence from human studies is limited but in obese animal models specific Lactobacillus and Bifidobacterium strains and prebiotics have exerted protective roles, for instance reducing lipid absorption, liver steatosis, adipocyte size, intestinal permeability and inflammatory markers associated with insulin resistance. Although, the possible anti-obesogenic role of probiotics has yet to be proven by conducting appropriated human intervention studies, there is no evidence that probiotics constitute growth promotes and contribute to the obesity epidemic in humans. Most likely the answer to the question whether probiotics have a positive or negative impact on obesity cannot be addressed by a simplistic answer but would depend on the complex interplay between specific strains, the host status and the diet.",

In addition our initial experiments indicate that the ICE responcible for the movement of DHA-1 is not SXT and the mechanism of mobilisation of DHA-1 is more efficient than that of NDM-1.",

The delivery of this education has primarily been through traditional models of educational delivery. Examples include: face to face learning e.g through didactic lectures or workshops with varying levels of interaction, self directed learning packages, video or satellite broadcasts to groups, one to one individual training[ less common as very resource intensive] and others. A more recent method has been the use of a range of online learning sites or resources which provide education through the Web.

For example, it is important to recognise that e-learning is a means of implementing education that can be applied within varying education models and philosophies, it can enable unique form of education that can fit into existing paradigms, the choice of e-learning tools should reflect rather than determine the pedagogy of a course, can be used for presenting educational content and or facilitation of educational processes, should only be use once the benefits and trade-off of online v off line have been considered, should consider how users will engage with the opportunities and that the development of material should fall within the context of the curriculum objectives and not determined by the technology.

The exposure to oseltamivir before sample collection appears short, with 50% of samples being collected after fewer than four days of oseltamivir exposure, but this reflects the disappearance of the virus, not a failure to collect samples. The subsequent sample from each case did not have any detectable pH1N1 by RT-PCR so further consumption of oseltamivir in these cases may not equate with further exposure of virus to selective pressure. Extended treatment of patients with prolonged shedding, such as in immunocompromised patients, is likely to yield a higher rate of emergence of H275Y than that reported here.",

Elderly are the most affected by seasonal over-mortality. In the UK and in France, and more widely in the northern hemisphere, the A/H1N1 pandemic stopped at the end of the year 2009. Interestingly it was not accompanied or followed by the common seasonal fly peak. This may be related to high prevalence of asymptomatic infections and/or to a significant proportion of elderly possessing protective antibodies due to ancient contact with an antigenically-related viral strain. We have examined 2 databases on global mortality in the UK (number of deaths per 1,000 population) and in France (number of deaths) to evaluate whether the absence of seasonal influenza epidemic had consequences on mortality. We compared the cold season over-mortality in the whole population and in people aged 75\u201384 in England and Wales during the first quarter of 2010 with the death rate observed during the preceding years. In the UK, in the whole population during the cold months (January to march), a reduction of 3% in the death rate was observed in males and 1.9% in females when the death rate of 2010 was compared to the mean rate of 2007, 2008, and 2009. the reduction in the death rate was much higher when the analysis was restricted to the 75\u201384 age group with a reduction of 8% in males and 7.7% in females of cold-seasons over-mortality.",

Therefore we suspect that there is a relation of cause and effect between A/HN pandemic, the lack of seasonal epidemic, and a reduction of fatality rate in 75\u201384 year-old people in 2010 in the UK and in the overall population in France. Our conclusion is that A/H1N1 pandemic paradoxically and unexpectedly resulted in a reduction of mortality in elderly, usually the most affected group of people.

            "text": "Recent advances in pharmacodynamics emphasize relationships between MIC and outcome. According to the antibiotic, the critical parameter is variously: (i) the duration for which drug level exceeds MIC; (ii) the maximum concentration/MIC ratio or, (iii) the area under the concentration\u2013time curve/MIC ratio. Nevertheless, other factors related to \u2018potency\u2019 (an elastic term) are important for some settings or drugs, not just the MIC. Bactericidal, rather than inhibitory activity is critical in endocarditis, severe bacteraemia and in infections where the host defences are severely compromised (e.g. neutropenic fevers). Thus, daptomycin, a rapidly cidal antibiotic, is clinically effective as monotherapy in staphylococcal endocarditis [1]; linezolid, a bacteriostatic drug, is not [2]. Nevertheless linezolid is more effective than vancomycin, a weakly bactericidal antibiotic, in methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus pneumonia [3], where cidality is less crucial. In addition, rapid cidal potency is not, in itself, a guarantor of efficacy: polymyxin is rapidly cidal for Gram-negative bacteria, but few would argue that it is highly potent; likewise, although aminoglycosides are useful and rapidly cidal, they are not appropriate as monotherapy outside the urinary tract. In some settings, most notably those involving biofilms on synthetic surfaces (e.g. prosthetic devices) the MIC is a poor predictor of outcome. This largely reflects the presence of dormant, difficult-to-kill cells in the stratified depths of the biofilm, but perhaps also the physical challenge of penetrating the matrix. Some antibiotics with growth-rate-independent killing, again including daptomycin, have in vitro potency against sessile cells in biofilms, but it remains to be established whether this translates into efficacy in device-related infections. Lastly, there are a few situations where antibiotics with poor in vitro activity are clinically potent, either because they interfere with bacterial signalling processes or concentrate in particular compartments, the best example being the utility of azithromycin in pseudomonal infection of cystic fibrosis patients and in gastrointestinal disease. In summary, although pharmacodynamic analysis is a good predictor in many settings, it does have limits, and potency \u2013 although an ambiguous term \u2013 is also critical in some settings.",

Effective therapy means the selection of an antibiotic with in vitro activity and administering it at the correct dose to attain, within the first 24 hours, the pharmacodynamic (PD) target that predicts its efficacy. The high mortality rate in S. aureus bacteraemia treated empirically with the standard vancomycin dose (1 g/12 hours) is, in part, due to the low probability of achieving the PD target (AUC_24/MIC \u2265400) within the first 24 hours. It is possible to increase the probability of target attainment by obtaining a trough serum concentration of 15\u201320 mg/l when the MIC is \u22641 microgram/ml. In order to achieve this goal within the first 24 hours, it is necessary to infuse a loading dose of 25\u201330 mg/kg and a maintaining dose of 15\u201320 mg/kg every 8\u201312 hours. This means, in general, a daily dose of vancomycin >3\u20134 g, which has been associated with a higher rate of nephrotoxicity. In addition, even with this body-weight-adjusted regimen, when the MIC is 2 micrograms/ml the probability of PD target attainment is low. These concepts are supported by clinical experience showing a deleterious impact of MIC = 2 micrograms/ml on the efficacy of standard vancomycin treatment and the lack of benefit, in these cases (MIC = 2 micrograms/ml), by increasing the dosage to reach a trough serum concentration \u226515 mg/l [1]. In addition, recent data has shown a higher frequency of tolerance to glycopeptides and vancomycin heteroresistance in methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA) strains with a MIC >1 microgram/ml than in strains with a MIC \u22641 microgram/ml [2]. Taking these data into account, plus the high prevalence of MRSA strains with high vancomycin MICs (2 micrograms/ml) and the poor results with vancomycin against methicillin-susceptible S. aureus, even after switching to \u03b2-lactams, alerts about the need for new anti-staphylococcal agents not only as a definitive therapy but also empirically in severe infections where S. aureus is suspected.",

            "text": "Skin and soft tissue infections (SSTIs) are among the most common human bacterial infections that result in significant morbidity and mortality among patients, as well as increased healthcare costs. Complicated SSTIs (cSSTI) can pose considerable diagnostic and therapeutic challenges. Staphylococcus aureus is the most common organism isolated from SSTIs, and methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA) is a rapidly increasing hospital- and community-acquired pathogen. Where the prevalence of methicillin resistance is high, an antibiotic with activity against MRSA is mandatory. Glycopeptides (vancomycin or teicoplanin) remain the gold standard of therapy for serious MRSA infections. However, there is controversy over the current utility of these agents. There is a growing body of evidence indicating that the glycopeptide MIC has a real impact on patient outcomes [1]. Whether this phenomenon is causing serious problems in the treatment of cSSTI is not clear. Vancomycin and teicoplanin have been also associated with relapsing bacteraemia and slower clinical response rates [1]. A large number of novel antibacterial agents have been or are being developed for the treatment of cSSTIs. Only linezolid, tigecycline and daptomycin are available for clinical use. The clinical decision-making process around antibiotic choice in the empirical setting or where cultures are available is dependent on a variety of factors. Important parameters that appear to determine the clinical effectiveness of an antibiotic for cSSTIs include the severity of the illness, patient co-morbidities, presence of biofilm-associated infections and/or secondary complications, whether the patient receives appropriate antimicrobial therapy at the onset of illness and whether this is given as a single-agent or combination approach to cover a broad range of likely causative organisms. In this context, daptomycin, a cyclic lipopeptide that is rapidly bactericidal and active against almost all Gram-positive cocci including MRSA, offers some interesting advantages. Two studies reported that significantly fewer patients with cSSTIs required prolonged treatment in the daptomycin arm and that clinical cure was faster than with comparators [2].",

Guidelines provide an evidence-based framework for therapy, but can also create a uniformity that can be deleterious and short-sighted. Hence guideline choice requires vision. Guidelines set standards of care, but these are nuanced by different attitudes to the \u201cphilosophy\u201d behind antimicrobial therapy and risk-aversity. As example, using the ceph/quinolone option one can take an outcome-based individual patient care approach (\u201cbroader is better at all cost\u201d) where fear of failure is paramount. This compares to a more societal advocacy that favours narrow-spectrum therapy and attempts to conserve antibiotics, aiming to avoid the collateral damage of increasing antibiotic resistance (cf: C. difficile, MRSA, ESBLs). It is illustrative to speculate on the differences in international CAP guidelines wrt \u03b2-lactams and quinolone use, and on the motivations that guide these. Is the perception (risk) of the immediacy of individual patient failure overriding concerns for the long-term loss of efficacy and societal costs? Yes, the use of 3rdG cephalosporins and/or quinolones may guarantee success in CAP. But are these successes any more than when iv penicillin is used with less fashionable drugs like tetracyclines or macrolides? And at what cost? As will be presented, the data does not reveal a difference. But broad-spectrum antibiotic use does not teach judicious antibiotic use to impressionable health professionals \u2013 eg. resident doctors and surgeons. It supports a culture of empiricism in ED departments, where many ceph/quinolone treated patients do not have CAP on review, and culminates in the domino effect of cephalosporin use. And it damages the credibility of ID units \u2013 paying lip service to the concept of antibiotic stewardship whilst using antibiotics indiscriminately for CAP.",

As these highly variable OD ratios are found up to ages of about 20 years, maternal immunity or aspecific vaccine effects seem unlikely. Could children be exposed to a different source, with antigen of nonviable oocysts causing seroconversion followed by antibody decay?

On the contrary, in EBV infected B lymphocytes the viral genomes usually persist as latent, circular episomes, co-replicating with the cellular DNA. Latent EBV genemes are associated with a series of malignant tumors as well. These include lymphomas (Burkitt's lymphoma, Hodgkin's disease, T/NK-cell lymphoma, post-transplant lymphoproliferative disease, AIDS-associated lymphoma, X-linked lymphoproliferative syndrome), carcinomas (nasopharyngeal carcinoma, gastric carcinoma, carcinomas of major salivary glands, thymic carcinoma, mammary carcinoma), and a sarcoma (leiomyosarcoma). In tumor cells the expression of latent EBV genomes is highly restricted and cell type specific, due to the epigenetic control of the viral promoters. DNA methylation, histone modifications and binding of key cellular regulatory proteins contribute to the regulation of alternative promoters for transcripts encoding the nuclear antigens EBNA 1 to 6 and affect the activity of promoters for transcripts encoding transmembrane proteins (LMP1, LMP2A, LMP2B). In addition to viral oncoproteins, non-translated RNAs (EBER1 and 2, microRNAs) may also contribute to EBV-mediated tumorigenesis. The epigenetic marks left by cellular enzymes and macromolecular complexes on latent EBV genomes define distinct viral epigenotypes that differ in transcriptional activity in spite of having an identical (or nearly identical) DNA sequence. Whereas latent EBV genomes are regularly targeted by epigenetic control mechanisms, EBV encoded proteins may, in turn, affect the activity of a set of cellular promoters by interacting with the very same epigenetic regulatory machinery. EBNA2 interacts with histone acetyltransferases, and EBNALP (EBNA5) coactivates transcription by displacing histone deacetylase 4 from EBNA2-bound promoter sites. EBNA3C (EBNA6) seems to be associated both with histone acetylases and deacetylases, although in separate complexes. LMP1 affects both systems of epigenetic memory, DNA methylation and the Polycomb-Trithorax group of protein complexes. In epithelial cells LMP1 up-regulates DNA methyltransferases and in Hodgkin lymphoma cells it induces the Polycomb group protein Bmi-1. In addition, LMP1 modulates the levels of microRNAs (miR-146a, miR-155) implicated in tumorigenesis. These interactions may result in epigenetic dysregulation and disease development.",

Against infections with multiple- (MDR) and extensively-drug-resistant (XDR) strains, therapeutic choices are limited and new options are sought. \u03b2-lactams and \u03b2-lactamase inhibitors are not routinely used to treat Mtb infections, since mycobacteria are considered to be resistant. BlaC, a \u03b2-lactamase expressed in Mtb, is identified as the major enzyme responsible for this resistance. BlaC which is capable of inactivating a broad range of penicillins and cephalosporins belongs to the class of \u03b2-lactamases which are usually susceptible to inhibitors such as clavulanate (Ambler Class A). The combination of carbapenems and clavulanate recently attracted attention as this combination was found to be very effective in sterilizing Mtb cultures, including extensive drug resistant (XDR) strains. However, kinetic studies revealed that clavulanic acid, compared to its effect in other Class A enzymes, is not as potent an inhibitor. This poor inhibition may set the ground for development of inhibitor-resistance. Therefore, novel \u03b2-lactamase inhibitors that are effective against BlaC could play an important role in the treatment of MDR or XDR infections.",

The research material involved gingival fluid sampled with 1 ml syringe with a thin needle from three most deep periodontal pockets. The obtained gingival fluid was tested for presence of IL-17, TNF-\u03b1 and bacteria of Lactobacillus genus, producing or not producing H2O2. Estimation of gingival fluid IL-17 and TNF-\u03b1 levels were conducted by ELISA, using Quantikine Human IL-17 and Quantikine HS Human TNF-\u03b1 Immunoassay kits (R&D Systems). In turn, Lactobacillus spp. were cultured on Rogosa agar and the cultured isolates obtained in anaerobic conditions were identified using API 50 CHL (bioMerieux).

People become infected accidentally eating Toxocara infected eggs or eating row tissue (cow/lamb liver). Tissue migrating larvae are trapped in eosinophilic granulomas, mostly in liver and lungs, but any organ including eye or CNS can be involved. Clinical forms: Visceral Larva Migrans, Ocular Larva Migrans, Covert Toxocariasis and asymptomatic patients. VLM is considered when following signs are present: hepato-splenomegaly, diarrhea, digestive disorders, dry cough, wheezing, fever, limphadenopaty, anorexia, malnourishment, skin disorders, pallor, asthenia, anorexia, cardiac and neurological signs. Positive serology and hipereosinophylia are the most relevant markers of infection activity. Skin disorders are present in about 24% of symptomatic cases. Urticaria and angioedema are quite often associated with allergic reactions, like asthma, rhinitis, conjunctivitis. About 17\u201365% of cases with chronic urticaria are confirmed with VLM, or have a positive serology for Toxocara with good evolution after antiparasitic treatment. Facial oedema and even laringial angioedema, requiring emergency interventions, can be present, as well as palpebral and lips edema. Pruritus is very common in Toxocariasis; sometime scratched skin is associated (all skin lesions are very itching). Acute or chronic pruritus, sometimes generalized or localized either on sole and palms, or on thorax, sacrum or nodular pruritus can be noticed. Skin rash (papular or purpuric), polymorphic eritema, hypodermal lesions and even Fiessinger-Leroy-Reiter syndrome can be associated. Eczema, dishydrotic or nodular lesions occur on palms and soles. Atopic eczema can be aggravated by Toxocariasis. Toxocara spp. is considered now etiologic factor for Wells syndrome (eosinophilic cellulites), together with other parasites, insect bites, infections or hematological disorders. In atopic patients, co-infection with Toxocara spp. amplifies the symptoms; sero-prevalence of Toxocariasis is higher in asthmatic patients than in normal population. Total and specific IgE anti-Toxocara are increased in RAST positive patients. CT associates skin manifestations and allergies together with asthenia, bronchospasm, hepatomegaly, digestive complaints, limphadenopaty, myalgia, asthenia. OLM is almost always an independent condition, being rarely consequent to VLM. Any ocular segment can be involved.",

The strongest biofilms in vitro were formed by S. aureus, S. epidermidis and P. aeruginosa. ES were added to these biofilms and reduced these on all biomaterials. The maximal biofilm inhibition by ES was seen on polyethylene: 82% for P. aeruginosa (p < 0.0001), 61% for S. aureus (p < 0.0001) and 92% for S. epidermidis (p < 0.0001). Furthermore, ES reduced complement activation in sera from healthy and postoperatively immune-activated sera up to 99.9% (p < 0.0001), via all three pathways of complement activation. This study shows that nor living maggots, neither maggot ES have direct antibacterial properties. However, ES do reduce biofilms and complement activation. The biofilm reduction and the immunosuppressive effect of maggot ES may explain part of the improved wound healing caused by maggot therapy. Furthermore, the biofilm- and complement-inhibitor(s) present in maggot ES could provide novel treatment modalities for various diseases, e.g. (chronic) infections in trauma patients.

The median age of incidence in developed countries has grown from 40 years in the fifties to 70 years at present. Risk factors have changed accordingly. Rheumatic valve disease and drug addiction are still more frequent in developing countries and in younger patients, whereas in the western world nosocomial acquisition, immunosuppression, dialysis, diabetes mellitus and cancer predominates in the elderly population. In these countries the proportion of responsible organisms have changed as well. Instead of viridans Streptococci that were the most common etiological agent in the past, Staphylococcus aureus represents nowadays the leading pathogen, and community-acquired methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus is emerging. Similarly, the increase of invasive procedures in elderly patients and the growing number of cardiac device implants has caused an increase of infections by skin bacteria such as coagulase-negative Staphylococci and Propionibacterium acnes, that in the past were considered as contaminants. The increase in population age has also caused an increase of infections due to bacteria that are commensals of intestinal and genitourinary flora such as Streptococcus gallolyticus, particularly in mediterranean countries, and Enterococci. Furthermore, we are facing the return of Gram negative bacteria and a worrying increase of fungi of nosocomial origin. Lastly, the introduction of new serological and molecular diagnostic tests have highlighted the major role of difficult to grow organisms, such as Coxiella, Bartonella, and Tropheryma whipplei in cases that were considered in the past culture-negative endocarditis. Hospital-acquired organisms harbour antibiotic resistant genes that cause problems in treatment.

Among fastidious microorganisms, Coxiella burnetii, the agent of Q fever, and Bartonella sp. appear to be the most common. Other bacteria, including Brucella sp., Abiotrophia sp., Tropheryma whipplei, Legionella sp., and mycobacteria are less frequent. Since 2001, we have used a systematic protocol that included serology assays, detection of auto-antibodies, PCR from blood and, when available, culture and PCR from valvular specimens. To this protocol were added in 2009 the detection of antibodies to pork in patients who had a porcine valvular bioprosthesis. Over 10 years, we studied 1,334 patients with blood culture negative endocarditis, including 1,230 classified as possible or definite using the Duke criteria. Our strategy enabled us to identify an aetiological agent in 775 patients, including C. burnetii in 54.2% of cases, Bartonella sp. in 19.2%, and other fastidious bacteria in 4.1% (T. whipplei 2.6%). Overall, fastidious bacteria accounted for 77.5% of all diagnoses. In addition to infectious causes, we detected 10 cases of marantic endocarditis, 12 cases of Libmann-Sacks endocarditis, 4 other auto-immune diseases, and one case of relapsing BCNE in whom the only possible cause was allergy to pork. We suggest that investigation of BCNE should systematically include C. burnetii and Bartonella sp. serologies, broad range PCR assays and histological examination when valvular specimens are available, and detection of auto-antibodies.",

Interestingly, some genotypes show different rates of persistence compared to the others. While HPV 6, 11, 16, 33, 53 show a higher persistence rate in AM group, HPV-31 shows a higher rate of spontaneous clearance in AM group (80.0%) than in CF group (64.7%). In the AM group, the difference between the persistence rate of genotype 11 (88.9%) and 31 (20.0%) is statistically significant (p < 0.01).",

The high rate of spontaneous clearance of HPV-31 in anal samples from immunodeficient patients in comparison with cervical samples is opposite of the low rate of clearance of the other genotypes. It can reflect a different mechanism of persistence or of response of the immune system or both. Interestingly, the genotype that seems to persist in a higher proportion of cases is HPV-11, a low-risk type, instead of HPV-31, a high-risk type. Further evaluations are needed to assess whether these differences are primarily due to the different type of mucosal tissue or to the different degree of immune response.",

Only 2 patients (1.6%) had no risk factor. However, only 11 (9%) of the 122 patients had received PPV23 prior to IPD infection. Seven of these (77.8%) were HIV-1 seropositive with average CD4 count of 301 (5\u2013591).

IPD has a significant associated mortality. Health care providers need to be aware of importance of vaccination. Patient education and SMS text reminders may help adherence. Dedicated HIV vaccination services increase uptake in this at risk cohort. Expansion of vaccination services to include drug treatment centres may facilitate uptake.

An epidemiological shift from C. albicans to other Candida spp has been discussed widely in recent years, with each Candida species having distinct antifungal susceptibility profiles. C. krusei is intrinsically resistant and C. glabrata shows reduced susceptibility to fluconazole; a recent Danish nationwide survey also detected decreased fluconazole susceptibility (MIC of >4 \u03bcg/ml) in C. albicans (0.6% of isolates), C. dubliniensis (3.1%), C. parapsilosis (6.0%), and C. tropicalis (6.7%). Between 2004\u20132009, the proportion of Candida blood isolates showing full susceptibility to fluconazole decreased from 79.7% to 68.9%. In another recent study, 19% of 243 candidaemia episodes at two tertiary centres in the US involved isolates with decreased fluconazole susceptibility, one third of which were from normally-susceptible species displaying acquired resistance. Although echinocandin-resistant strains of Candida have not been isolated from echinocandin-na\u00efve patients, they have been documented in some patients after relatively short periods of treatment.

Recent data suggest that the revised breakpoints (lower than the original CLSI breakpoint) help differentiate Candida isolates with FKS mutations from those which remain fully susceptible. Revised and specific CLSI breakpoints have also been developed for fluconazole ensuring harmonisation with the EUCAST breakpoints and a better classification of isolates of C. glabrata, many of which were susceptible using the former CLSI breakpoint even though clinical response rates to fluconazole were lower than to those observed for other species.

Given the shifts in the epidemiology of Candida species, there is an increased risk for infections caused by fluconazole-insensitive isolates. The identification of such an isolate in patients receiving fluconazole usually necessitates a change in treatment (often switching to another class of antifungal), thus delaying the onset of effective treatment.

For both healthcare-associated and community-based infections, rapid detection can limit exposure of patients to contagious illnesses, thus reducing transmission. However, two major limitations of molecular diagnostics as currently utilized are not reporting results in a clinically actionable timeframe due to batch processing and the inability to perform the tests where they are needed most, such as in developing countries. This session will focus on four areas in which rapid, decentralized molecular detection may have a profound impact on improving public health and patient care. First, the rapid detection of multidrug resistant strains of tuberculosis using rifampin resistance as a surrogate marker in less than two hours may, according to the World Health Organization, revolutionize the treatment of tuberculosis, especially in developing countries. Second, in the hospital setting, two decades of using insensitive tests for Clostridium difficile has led to dramatic increases in the prevalence of these infections. New molecular amplification tests that provide identification of C. difficile in as little as 30 minutes, with both high sensitivity and specificity, are optimizing both patient management and infection control efforts in healthcare settings. Third, the availability of highly accurate molecular tests on demand for detecting sexually transmitted diseases, such as chlamydia and gonorrhea, has the potential of improving public health efforts to control the spread of disease. Finally, the rapid and accurate identification of the etiologic agents of sepsis, both bacterial and fungal, using novel molecular technologies will likely improve therapy and outcomes for the most critically ill patients.

Most novel compounds with activity against Gram-negative bacteria are in research or early development phase. Hence, resistance will continue to outrun our antibacterial development efforts. Driven by concern regarding this rapidly worsening global health crisis and the confounding lack of robust drug pipelines, international recognition of the problem and several multinational campaigns have initiated broad discussion and put action plans in place. These campaigns create a ray of hope as innovative models of research and development may translate into promising pipelines during the next decade.

Consumption of water by humans and animals represents a continuing opportunity for the addition of new elements to the diversity of microorganisms and mobile genetic elements in this habitat. Antimicrobial resistance in Enterobacteriaceae, in particular in E. coli is a particular concern because of their importance in both extraintestinal infection (urinary tract and invasive infection) and intestinal infection. However criteria for potable water include E. coli and coliform bacteria (Enterobacteriaceae) not detectable in a 100ml sample therefore potable water by definition should not have antimicrobial resistant Enterobacteriaceae at readily detectable levels. However water consumed by human and food animals in many areas of the world including parts of Europe may fail to meet this requirement with resulting opportunities for introduction of new viable Enterobacteriaceae with potential transferable antimicrobial resistance mechanisms into the gastrointestinal tract. Bacteria other than Enterobacteriaceae are present normally in potable water and may introduce new resistance elements. Even in the absence of viable bacteria potable water may contain and introduce new resistance determinants to the genetic diversity of the gastrointestinal tract. The extent of contamination of drinking water sources and derived potable water with antimicrobial resistant bacteria and antimicrobial resistance determinants is an indicator of the extent to which antimicrobial use has altered the microbial biodiversity of aquatic environments. It is prudent to consider ways to limit such impacts both from a direct human health perspective (in particular with respect to novel resistance determinants) but also with a view to minimising unintended ecological disturbance. As drinking water distribution systems now frequently serve much greater populations than in the past there may be greater potential for potable water to contribute to mixing of microorganisms or microbial genetic material in the gastrointestinal tract although there is little evidence to support this and it may be impractical to eliminate it. The fundamental disturbance of this aspect of microbial ecology that must be controlled is almost certainly intense selective pressure related to the antimicrobial use rather than changes in water distribution.",

In contrast, A549 cells exposed to 4 and 8 \u03bcg/ml were able to inhibit fungal growth when infected at time points up to 48 hours post drug exposure. HPLC analysis suggests a two phase decay model: a rapid initial decay to approximately 25% of the initial intracellular concentration within the initial 6 hours, followed by a plateau. As expected, observed fungal growth correlates with the decrease in drug levels.",

Increasingly, laboratory assays are being paired with imaging modalities to further increase diagnostic accuracy. One recent synergy is the use of an in vitro blood test for liver fibrosis (ELF\u2122*\n) in conjunction with an ultrasound-based imaging technology (ARFI*) that may enhance analysis of hepatic damage through assessment of liver elasticity along with evidence of fibrosis. In patients with chronic viral hepatitis or other forms of hepatic disease, such an approach could potentially reduce the risk and discomfort associated with a liver biopsy through use of less-invasive methodologies. This presentation will focus on key contributions of the laboratory in the accurate identification of an infectious origin by utilizing two separate patient profiles.

This drug had remarkable activity against many species of Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria as well as the tubercle bacillus. However, when used as a single agent for treating tuberculosis, there was rapid emergence of resistance. That was subsequently overcome by using the drug in combination with other antituberculous agents. Over the next quarter century, a number of other aminoglycosidic aminocyclitol antibiotics were discovered, including neomycin (1949), kanamycin (1957), gentamicin (1963), and tobramycin (1967). During this time, extensive studies of the mechanism of action of the aminoglycosides carried out, and based on detailed information concerning mechanisms of enzymatic resistance, it became possible to provide a number of chemical modifications of the basic aminoglycoside structure to overcome resistance. Thus drugs such as amikacin (1972), dibekacin, and others were developed specifically to overcome mechanisms of enzymatic inactivation. Work in this arena has continued to the present, with several aminoglycosides, including SPX-1212 and ACHN-490, in preclinical or early clinical development for the treatment of infections due to organisms resistant to standard aminoglycosides. The issue of nephro- and ototoxicity has plagued all of the aminoglycosides, and although the currently available agents vary in their toxicity, it has been impossible thus far to design a compound in this class of antimicrobial agents completely devoid of oto- and/or nephrotoxicity.",

A few surveillance systems \u2013 MYSTIC, SMART and SENTRY examine Gram-negative bacteria from both continents. Whilst their coverage is tiny relative to total population, all point to higher rates of cephalosporin resistance and ESBL production in much of Asia compared with Europe. Several show India to have exceptionally high ESBL rates, at around 50\u201380% in both Klebsiella and E. coli, whereas ESBL rates of 20\u201350% are widely seen across East Asia vs. 5\u201315% for most Western Europe. CTX-M-15 is now the predominant ESBL in Europe except Iberia and in Asia as far east as India, but is replaced by CTX-M-14 in the Far East and, strangely, in Spain. One lineage of uropathogenic E. coli, Sequence Type (ST)131, is particularly associated with cephalosporin resistance, usually but not always mediated by CTX-M-15 enzyme; it occurs widely across both continents, also in Africa, N. American and Australia. The dissemination of carbapenemases across the two continents is at an earlier stage than that of ESBLs and these enzymes remain extremely rare in many countries. Nevertheless there is extensive dissemination of NDM-1 metallo-carbapenemase in India and Pakistan, of VIM in Greece, OXA-48 in Turkey and KPC (an enzyme that originated in the US) in Greece. These are being introduced to further countries in both continents by human migration, international lifestyles and medical tourism, with cluster outbreaks of producers in, for example, China, Poland, Italy and the UK. One of the most potentially disturbing, but least clear, aspects is the extent to which resistant Enterobacteriaceae with ESBLs and carbapenemases have entered the wider ecosystem in those countries, largely in South Asia, where there is inadequate separation of drinking and waste water and the extent to which this may drive the problem by allowing gut colonisation of large numbers of residents.",

The lethality of opportunistic fungal infection is high despite a growing arsenal of antimycotic drugs, implying the urgent need for supportive immunological therapies to strengthen the current inefficient antimicrobial defences of the immunocompromised host. Therefore, increasing effort has been directed to investigating the interplay between fungi and the host immunity and thus to find starting points for additional therapeutic approaches. Important aspects include the activation of the complement system by the fungal pathogen, the efficiency of the complement-associated antimicrobial functions and the arsenal of immune evasion strategies applied by the fungi. The broad spectrum of complement-associated immune reactions includes the deposition of complement products on the fungal surface to opsonise them for phagocytosis, the activation and chemoattraction of immune cells, and the stimulation of virtually the whole immunodefence network (humoral immunity, T-cell response, and induction of cytokine and chemokine expression). This central role of complement as the first line of antifungal defence could be demonstrated in many cases, e.g. by the fact that complement-deficient mice are extremely susceptible against several fungal infections. The twin functions of complement as an interactive player of the innate immunity and at the same time as a modulator of the adaptive immunity make this defence weapon a particularly interesting therapeutic candidate to mobilise a more effective immune response and to strengthen in one fell swoop a broad spectrum of different immune reactions.

Low serum levels of MBL are found in 30\u201340% of white people and very low levels in about 8\u201310%. Because many components of the innate immune system are redundant, MBL deficiency appears to be an important risk of infection when it is combined with other immunodeficiencies. These include early childhood with immune immaturity, primary and secondary immunodeficiencies and oncology patients receiving chemotherapy. Patients with haematological malignancies are at high risk of developing chemotherapy-induced neutropenia and a variety of bacterial and fungal infections with life-threatening complications. During this period of immune paralysis of phagocytes and lymphocytes, the non-cellular components of the innate immune systems, not affected by the immunosuppressive drugs, may become an important alternative. Several studies in children and adults tried to assess the role of serum MBL deficiency in this setting. Heterogeneity of patients, small numbers, different cut-off values for defining MBL deficiency have led to conflicting results. We recently reported in a large prospective study that MBL-deficiency patients with haematological malignancy have more severe infections including pneumonia, bacteremia, invasive fungal infections or sepsis, after receiving chemotherapy. These results have been confirmed in another prospective trial in myelo-ablative sibling allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation.

The median value of the data for each group is shown as a horizontal bar; each sphere represents one mouse. No statistical significance was seen between untreated, control, and placebo groups. Statistical significance (p < 0.0001) was noted between untreated/control/placebo and ClyS groups with a three log drop in bacteria recovered (CFUs). Statistical difference (p = 0.001) was noted between ClyS and mupirocin treated groups, with a one log drop difference between them.
