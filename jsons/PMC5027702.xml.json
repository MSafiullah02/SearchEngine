A mouse model for studies of MERS-CoV was not initially available since mice and other small animals lack the MERS-CoV receptor. For this reason, we developed a transgenic mouse model containing the human DPP4 receptor.5,6 Availability of this model provided the opportunity to assess whether an inactivated MERS-CoV vaccine would induce protection against MERS-CoV infection but also induce an eosinophil-containing pulmonary immunopathology as had similar SARS-CoV vaccines.

Consistent with the absence of specific antibody response, infectious virus was readily detected in the lungs of three infected animals immunized with alum only (MF59 group not available) on days 3 and 6, with an average of 103.1 and 102.8 TCID50/gm, respectively, in which the limit of detection (LOD) in the Vero E6 cell-based infectivity assay was \u223c101.8 TCID50/gm. In contrast, infectious virus remained undetectable in all of the vaccine groups at either time (Fig. 2A\u2013B). Titers of viral RNA, as revealed by qRT-PCR assays and expressed as TCID50 equivalents, were also compared among the groups. All groups exhibited detectable viral RNAs (Fig. 2C\u2013D). The titers were lower in all vaccine groups on day 3 but none were significantly lower than those of the controls (Fig. 2C); however, the titer for each vaccine group on day 6 was significantly lower than those of either adjuvant only group (P < 0.01) (Fig. 2D).

This level of eosinophilic infiltration was similar to that revealed in infected mice without prior manipulation, and scored as 0.

A similar RSV vaccine given to infants had led to increased pulmonary disease severity and 2 deaths.19,20 The component(s) of the vaccine that led to the immunopathology have not been identified, but have been suggested to be viral components as well as contaminants and formalin effects. However, Immunopathology with SARS-CoV vaccines occurred for whole-virus vaccines, subunit vaccines, different inactivation methods, different preparation substrates, and with recombinant surface (S) protein. This experience may indicate that the responsible components(s) for the SARS and MERS-CoV vaccines are viral. Results of studies with vector vaccines point to the nucleoprotein (N) protein as responsible for the immunopathological effects seen and indicate that the S protein might be free of the risk; however, rS protein induced the pathology.3,21,22 Identifying and remedying the specific basis for the immunopathology would facilitate vaccine trials in humans.",
