This has already had profound consequences for ecosystem services, including protection from infectious disease (Millennium Ecosystem Assessment 2005). The risks of zoonotic and vector-borne disease in humans and wild animals have increased in the past decades, especially at sites with high human disturbances (Myers and Patz 2009; Jones et al. 2008; Bradley and Altizer 2007; Wilcox and Gubler 2005; Taylor et al. 2001).",

            "text": "West Nile virus (WNV) was historically seen only in the eastern hemisphere and its detection in North America in 1999 (Lanciotti et al. 1999) reawakened US citizens to potential risks associated with mosquito-borne disease (which had largely disappeared after malaria eradication post-WW II). WNV depends on both arthropod (mosquito) vectors and vertebrate (avian) hosts for persistence and amplification in the environment. Humans are at risk when a competent mosquito feeds from an infectious host and then from a human. WNV zoonotic hosts include a number of diverse avian species, although studies suggest that host competence (ability to both be infected and become infectious) is more variable than the long list of species that have been recorded with WNV infections (i.e., CDC 2009) might suggest (Kilpatrick et al. 2007; Komar et al. 2003). Current understanding of how mosquito community composition influences the timing and intensity of avian enzootics and human epidemics remains uncertain, although studies agree that species from the genus Culex (family Culicidae) are important (Kilpatrick et al. 2005; Turell et al. 2005; Andreadis et al. 2004). The emergence of WNV in New York City in 1999 is most likely an example of pathogen movement due to global travel and trade, similar to the 2003 introduction of monkey pox to the American Midwest and the cross-continent spread of both SARS and H5N1 (Anderson et al. 2004; Kilpatrick et al. 2006a). However, the fact that competent hosts and vectors coincided at necessary densities to facilitate WNV spread and support growing endemism of WNV across the North American continent in under 5 years is remarkable.",

            "text": "The rapid dispersal of WNV across North America has resulted in a complex spatio-temporal pattern of WNV incidence and impact in both the primary avian hosts (Bradley et al. 2008; LaDeau et al. 2008; Gibbs et al. 2006; Kilpatrick et al. 2006b; Komar et al. 2005; Yaremych et al. 2004) and in humans (Sugumaran et al. 2009; Reisen et al. 2009; Liu et al. 2009; Brown et al. 2008; Ruiz et al. 2007, 2006; Brownstein et al. 2003). The spatial variability in WNV prevalence likely reflects the combined influence of stochastic dispersal (Kilpatrick et al. 2007) and habitat heterogeneity at both host- and vector-specific scales (Bradley et al. 2008; Brown et al. 2008; Gibbs et al. 2006). A number of studies have correlated WNV seroprevalence in birds (Bradley et al. 2008; Gibbs et al. 2006), small mammals (Gomez et al. 2008), and proportions of WNV-positive mosquito traps (Andreadis et al. 2004) with measures of urban land cover and/or human density. Higher incidence of human WNV cases has also been associated with higher human densities (Liu et al. 2009) and reduced forest cover (Brown et al. 2008) in the northeastern US, but also with more rural (often agricultural) characteristics in the Northern Great Plains (Sugumaran et al. 2009) and Iowa (DeGroote et al. 2008). Inter-regional differences in the influence of urbanization on WNV risk are perhaps unsurprising given habitat and regional differences in the composition of mosquito communities (Darsie and Ward 2005) and potential WNV vector species (Turell et al. 2005). Proposed mechanisms for intra-regional spatial patterns include heterogeneities in host community competence (Loss et al. 2009; Kilpatrick et al. 2006b) and host diversity (Allan et al. 2009), as well as complex ecological interactions driven by mosquito feeding preferences (Kilpatrick et al. 2006c). Vegetation cover and associated variability in vector habitat were associated with human WNV risk in New York City (Brownstein et al. 2003) and both vegetation cover and age of housing were important predictors of WNV risk in Chicago (Ruiz et al. 2006).",

            "text": "The goal of this paper is to explore the connections between land use and WNV amplification and persistence in the environment by examining spatio-temporal changes in the population dynamics of American crows (Corvus brachyrhynchos), a host species with high WNV sensitivity (Komar et al. 2003). American crows are especially susceptible to WNV infection, with nearly 100% mortality in laboratory challenge experiments (Komar et al. 2003) and very low to nonexistent seroprevalence in the wild (Wilcox et al. 2007, but see Reed et al. 2009). We build on the analysis by LaDeau et al. (2007), which documented clear consequences of WNV emergence for crow and other native avian species. Furthermore, work by LaDeau et al. (2007, 2008) indicated that the spatial and temporal variation in crow declines was strongly correlated with similar patterns in human WNV incidence when these data were available. Because several sources of long-term bird population data are freely available [i.e., USGS Breeding Bird Survey (BBS), Audubon Christmas Bird Count], evaluating changes in crow abundances represents a relatively inexpensive and consistent source of proxy data for WNV intensity. Additionally, because these data are not collected specifically in response to the WNV epidemic in the US, they (1) extend backwards, prior to WNV emergence, and (2) include more spatially even information on impacts to the host community that are not necessarily associated with human epidemics, whereas WNV-specific data are generally focused on locations with known (documented) WNV outbreaks. The current study integrates spatial and temporal structure into the model presented in LaDeau et al. (2007) to examine the spatial heterogeneity in crow declines across the northeastern United States\u2014where WNV has been present longest. We examine the relationship between WNV-related crow declines and land use at local and regional spatial scales to evaluate the hypothesis that WNV transmission is positively associated with human-dominated landscapes.",

Each BBS route is comprised of a specific 24.5-mile stretch of secondary road that is visited annually in June. All birds seen or heard during 3-min intervals at fifty stops (located every 0.5 miles) along the BBS route are recorded. In this study we used time series data from 1994 to 2004, which captures the arrival of WNV in this region (1999) and does not extend too far beyond our best land-cover data (satellite requisition in 2001, see below for details). We used the total annual count (summed over 50 stops per route) for each of 149 routes located across the northeastern US (Fig. 1) where WNV was present by 2000 and documented in human cases by 2001 (CDC, http://www.cdc.gov/ncidod/dvbid/westnile/Mapsactivity/surv&control01Maps.htm). There were 100 missing counts out of the possible 1,639 observations, which were collected by 195 unique observers. The presence or absence of WNV at each route-by-year node was assigned using mosquito and human detection data for each county in our study from information collected by the ArboNET system of the Centers for Disease Control (data acquired from J. Lehman, Div. Vector-borne Infectious Diseases, CDC). We assumed that annual detection within a county indicated potential WNV exposure along any BBS route intersecting that county during that year. WNV presence was indicated in 43% of sites in 2000 and had increased to 88% by 2004.\n",

In a landscape-scale analysis that captures the full range of habitats where crows seen along the BBS route might feed, breed and roost (Yaremych et al. 2004). We identified the centroid of each route and then buffered the centroid by the length of the route radius (19.7 km, the maximum distance between the starting point and the mid-point of a route). Data from the National Land Cover Database were downloaded at the USGS Land Cover Institute (available online at: http://landcover.usgs.gov/). We tabulated the number of pixels in each land cover class within each buffer around the center of each BBS route. In a separate, fine-scale analysis we used the same land-cover data sources to evaluate land-cover characteristics within a roughly 0.5-km buffer around each BBS route which may better reflect wintering roosts or local mosquito transmission (e.g., Ward et al. 2006). Depending on the shape (straightness) of the actual route, this created discrepancies in total area so we used percentage land-cover classes for our fine-scale analysis. For the purposes of this study (at both spatial scales), land uses classified as deciduous, evergreen, and mixed forest were combined into a single forest class and low- and high-intensity residential, commercial, and urban grasslands were grouped as an urban class. The relative covers were actually fairly consistent across spatial scales; forest cover ranged from 1 to 93% (mean 45%) and urban cover ranged from 0.1 to 44% (mean 9%) using the fine-scale buffers and ranged 10\u201384% (mean 41%) and 1\u201341% (mean 12%), respectively, for the landscape-scale buffers.",

Crows began to decline immediately after 1999 and continued to decline steadily until 2003, when abundance dropped dramatically (Fig. 2). The declines in crow abundances were significantly greater at a subset of urban sites where forest covered <35% of the landscape (1st quartile for forested area across all sites) and urban area was >11% of (3rd quartile for urban area across all sites) than at more rural sites (forest >68% of the landscape and urban area <5% of the landscape) (Fig. 3). This held up across all sites in our full model (Table 1). Crow abundances declined following the emergence of WNV, especially in landscapes that had lower proportions of forest cover and after above-average winter temperatures. Warmer winter temperatures generally had a positive influence on crow populations in the absence of WNV, while parameters describing the influence of total forest or urban cover did not differ from zero (Table 1).\n\n\n",

We also detected a significant influence of winter temperature on the inter-annual variability in crow declines associated with WNV. Crows were most vulnerable to WNV declines 1 year after warmer-than-average winters (Table 1). However, because winter temperature and the proportion of the landscape classified as urban were related (Fig. 4), we cannot disentangle the exact relationship between WNV impact in crows and winter climate or human land use. In our model exercise, the climate component does have a stronger influence on the short-term predictive ability measured by DIC, which could indicate that a temperature mechanism controls both the inter-annual and spatial heterogeneity in WNV incidence but could also be driven by the fact that we have more informative temperature data (which is available on an annual basis) relative to the one-time land cover observations. Still, whether due to the physical nature of anthropogenic habitat modification or to the associated changes in local temperature regimes (e.g., heat island), our results suggest that characteristics of the human-dominated landscape are associated with higher WNV risk in crow populations.",

The warmer mean annual winter temperatures associated with development may support greater overwinter survival of infected mosquitoes and higher rates of vertical (transgenerational) transmission of WNV (e.g., Turell et al. 2001; Dohm et al. 2002), resulting in a head-start for epizootic amplification each spring and greater exposure of young, fledgling, and adult crows throughout the season. Similarly, residential landscapes may incorporate enough structural support in the form of sewer systems (Ruiz et al. 2007; LaBeaud et al. 2008) and storm water management (Wallace 2007) to facilitate rapid mosquito population growth together with a critical amount of vegetation and food availability to attract avian hosts (e.g., Ruiz et al. 2006; Brownstein et al. 2003).",

In the United States, the total area covered by cities doubled between 1950 and 1990, although the population growth in urban centers only increased 10% (Livernash and Rodenburg 1998). The northeastern US encompasses the full gradient of rural habitat and anthropogenic disturbances (Woolmer et al. 2008). The sprawl of urban and suburban development is nestled within a regional landscape that includes agricultural fields, forests, and enough habitat diversity to support a wide-range of wildlife within close proximity to the sewers and backyard structures that support potential WNV vectors (Turell et al. 2005; Rochlin et al. 2008). These human-modified landscapes are likely to influence host and vector community ecology in ways that may affect pathogen transmission and even host susceptibility. Similar effects of forest loss and urban expansion have also been evident in the incidence of other zoonotic and vector-borne diseases [e.g., Malaria (Yasuoka and Levins 2007), Lyme disease (Allan et al. 2003), and chronic wasting disease (Farnsworth et al. 2005)].",

When the abundance and dispersal of a pathogen depends on wildlife hosts (zoonotic) or transmission by vectors, then understanding the ecology and population history of these species is crucial. Here we have shown that generalized and broad monitoring programs such as the North American Breeding Birds Survey can be valuable additions to disease-specific data protocols. Having these programs in place before pathogen introductions and epidemics occur is vital. Our work is also limited by some important data constraints associated with these broad monitoring/data programs. BBS bird counts are by definition made along secondary roads and there are no sites located at either rural or urban land-use extremes. Similarly, land cover could have changed dramatically between either the beginning or end of our study period and when the remote sensing data were collected (~2000) in ways that we could not capture at the same spatio-temporal scale of our count response variable.",

Historically, many facets of infrastructure development have acted to inhibit the spread and intensity of human disease (e.g., housing, water, and waste-management systems, and others). However, a landscape matrix of increasing fragmentation of forest, interspersed with agriculture, and urban and suburban residences may facilitate transmission dynamics for many of the emerging and reemerging pathogens that we see today. These challenges may be exacerbated by factors such as a changing climate, which has already and will continue to influence the seasonal and spatial dynamics of many pathogens (Paz and Albersheim 2008; Crowl et al. 2008).",
