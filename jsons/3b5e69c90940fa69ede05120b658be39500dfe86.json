On January 30, 2020 the outbreak in China was announced as a public health emergency of international concern at a meeting of the WHO Emergency Committee in Geneva, in an effort to suppress global spread of the disease.",

In such an urgent and unexpected situation, the department took immediate and effective prevention and control strategies. These staff was now completely recovered and there were now new infected cases in the department. Here, we would like to summarize and share our successful experiences in the prevention and control of SARS-CoV-2 infection in medical staff of hospital departments, especially those devoted to non-infection diseases.",

For example, patients in the neurosurgery department are at high risk of COVID-19 infection. Therefore, the hospital should be committed to a strict 3-level ward management system (Table 1) . Patients suspected of infection should be partitioned from other patients, and each ward should employ different sets of medical staff to avoid cross-contamination. \u2022 Patients with systemic abnormalities beyond the respiratory system. Among patients with COVID-19 there are reports of 12%, 7%, and 3% rates of acute cardiac impairment, acute renal impairment, and diarrhea, respectively. Liver injury has also been reported. 1 These concomitant conditions are aggravated in COVID-19, and even present a major threat of mortality. Therefore, it is especially important during this epidemic that the basic vital signs and dysfunctional organs of such vulnerable patients are safeguarded. The effect of possible infection should be minimized, with early detection and intervention. 5 \u2022 Patients with associated mental stress. Because COVID-19 is highly contagious, can quickly progress in severe cases, and there is no specific effective treatment, hospitalized patients often experience anxiety, mania, insomnia, or other psychological problems. Patients should be reassured that, although the number of infected persons has rapidly increased, the prognosis is better than for SARS (severe acute respiratory syndrome), and the fatality rate is much lower. 6 The medical staff should inform inpatients that the epidemic will subside if scientific prevention, control, and treatment measures are adhered to.
