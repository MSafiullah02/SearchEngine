Several recent Chinese studies have since demonstrated the sequelae of CV events. [5] [6] [7] As the pandemic evolves, the emerging literature on CV outcomes are not well characterized, but likely encompass acute coronary syndromes, myocarditis, cardiomyopathies, cardiogenic shock, lethal arrhythmias, and sudden cardiac death.",

The development of potentially lethal arrhythmias, especially in the setting of elevated cardiac biomarkers, should herald myocarditis as a differential diagnosis. 18, 19 The Surviving Sepsis Campaign: Guidelines on the Management of Critically Ill Adults with COVID-19 do not currently include guidelines with regard to specific arrhythmia management. 20 Arrhythmias are complex and multifactorial in a COVID-19 patient and may result from metabolic derangements, hypoxia, acidosis, intravascular volume imbalances, neurohormonal, and catecholaminergic stress. 21, 22 Sepsis is characterized by a systemic milieu involving inflammatory cytokines and autonomic dysfunction. 23 This maladaptive pathophysiology is a significant trigger for the development of AF, as was illustrated in this patient. 24 This likely occurred in our patient as he initially presented with AFL with 2 to 1 atrioventricular block and transitioned to AF with rapid ventricular response in the setting of COVID-19 infection. AF is a common sequela of critical illness, with an estimated prevalence of almost 10% in ICU patients, and several studies report worse outcomes in patients with new-onset AF as compared with their non-AF counterparts. 25, 26 Sinus rhythm restoration is of high priority as it improves the patient's hemodynamics. AF may attenuate cardiac output due to impaired left ventricular filling, especially with rapid ventricular response. 22, 27 Presently, there are no evidence-based guidelines for the use of anticoagulant prophylaxis in these patients. 28 Additionally, severe infection induces the sympathetic nervous system (SNS), and there is also a relationship between SNS activity and supraventricular tachyarrhythmia. 29 Tachycardia, in itself, is an independent prognosticator or mortality in patients with sepsis. 30 Postulated mechanisms of this arrhythmogenesis include SNS-induced calcium entry into cardiac myocytes as well as a spontaneous release of calcium from the sarcoplasmic reticulum. 31, 32 Our patient illustrated several of the above electrolyte abnormalities, including hypokalemia, hypomagnesemia, and hypophosphatemia, all of which were aggressively repleted. In some cases, it is observed that tachycardia continues despite adequate volume resuscitation. 33 Our patient also displayed anemia with mild rhabdomyolysis, which was managed with judicious intravenous crystalloid hydration.",
