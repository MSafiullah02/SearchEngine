The mechanism of bioaerosols production and the effect of biofiltration on bioaerosol emissions were analyzed. The results showed that the bioaerosol emission concentrations were generally exceeded 10 4 CFU m \u00c03 , which would damage to human health. Biomass, inlet gas velocity, moisture content, temperature, and some other factors have significant influences on bioaerosol emissions. Moreover, as a result of the analysis done herein, different inactivation technologies and microbial immobilization of bioaerosols were proposed and evaluated as a potential solution for reducing bioaerosols emissions. The purpose of this paper is to make more people realize the importance of controlling the emissions of bioaerosols in the biofiltration process and to make the treatment of VOCs by biotechnology more environmentally friendly.

Microorganisms in the biofilm use VOCs as carbon sources to produce CO 2 , H 2 O, and biomass, etc. Microorganisms attach to the packing materials either naturally or as a result of engineering measures (Cohen, 2001) . Fig. 1 illustrates the basic principle of the formation and emission of bioaerosols from biofilters. During biofiltration, the airflow containing VOCs provides carbon sources for the biofilm. Over long periods of operation, a large amount of biomass accumulates and the biofilm attached to the surface of the packing materials becomes thicker simultaneously (Yang et al., 2010) . Thicker biofilms make it easier for microorganisms to exchange with air currents and be carried away from the packing materials. Moreover, not only dead microorganisms, but also injured microorganisms, fragments of cells, mycotoxins and endotoxins proteins liberated during the lysis process of cells will also fall off the packing materials during the growth of microorganisms in the biofilm.
