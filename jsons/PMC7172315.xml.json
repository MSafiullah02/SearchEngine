Asthmatics have sensitive airways that react to stimuli with inflammation, swelling of the airway lining, muscle tightening and mucus production; all of which make breathing more difficult. The symptoms can be one or more of the following: wheezing, coughing, tightness in the chest and shortness of breath. The prevalence or disease burden of asthma varies from country to country. It is estimated that there are approximately 300 million affected individuals worldwide [1]. Annual worldwide deaths from asthma have been estimated at 250,000. The highest prevalence of asthma is in the UK, Australia, New Zealand and Ireland [1]. In Australia, 12% of children and young adults aged 0\u201324 years have asthma [2] and expenditure on asthma in 2000 was estimated at AUS$693 million [3]. In the USA, 20 million people are affected by asthma and the total direct and indirect costs of asthma exceeded US$11.3 billion in 1998 [4].",

In people with underlying asthma, respiratory viruses frequently trigger exacerbation of the disease, with 80\u201390% of exacerbations in children associated with respiratory infections [5] and up to two thirds of cases in adults [5]. Respiratory viruses are also thought to have a role in people becoming sensitive to allergens and developing asthma [9], [10].",

Viral infections are one of the environmental triggers, having been implicated both in the induction of the disease and, more frequently, in its exacerbation. A number of viruses are associated with the exacerbation of asthma in children and adults. The most common viruses detected in connection with the symptoms of asthma are rhinoviruses (RV); however, human respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), human metapneumovirus (hMPV), parainfluenza and influenza viruses, adenoviruses and coronaviruses are also thought to contribute to the exacerbation of asthma [5], [6]. The characteristics of the main viruses are listed in Table 1\n. For some of these viruses, there is evidence from both epidemiological and experimental studies to confirm the role of a viral infection in exacerbating asthma, while for other viruses the evidence is less clear.",

The mast cells degranulate and they, and other cells, release chemical mediators into the lower respiratory tract that prolong the response and cause contraction of the bronchial smooth muscles (Table 2). These actions, and airway swelling, mucus secretion and inflammation, contribute to the bronchoconstriction and airway obstruction seen in asthma attacks.",

If initial infection occurs early in life, the T helper 1 (Th1) response may be weak, allowing the development of stronger Th2 responses to challenges later in life. Mice initially infected with RSV as neonates were more likely to have a Th2 type response upon secondary infection, whereas those first infected when older were more likely to have a Th1 type response [7]. One interpretation of these findings is that RSV infection in neonates suppresses the development of the Th1 immune response and a Th2 response occurs. In contrast, if the initial infection is delayed for several weeks, a Th1 immune response is mounted which lacks the pathogenic Th2 component associated with asthma. There is some evidence that infection at one stage in life may lead to a reduction in atopy while, at another stage, it may potentiate the emergence of allergies [8] and that early severe RSV infections in infancy leads to allergic asthma later in life [9], [10]. However, this issue is controversial.",

Host genetics is also thought to affect the severity of viral infections and the type of immune response to the infection. For example, specific alleles of pulmonary surfactant genes have been associated with more severe RSV infections in infants [16]. Surfactant proteins line the alveolar surface of the lungs and are essential for normal respiratory function. Other genetic variations have been shown to affect the expression of cytokines in response to viral infections. A variation causing an increase in IL-8 transcription was found to lead to enhanced susceptibility to RSV induced bronchiolitis [17] and a variant affecting transcription of IL-4 was found to be associated with severe RSV disease and elevated levels of IgE [18]. Similarly, variations in genes for IL-10 have been identified, with those people heterozygous for the gene found to be less likely to develop RSV bronchiolitis [19], and two distinct mutations in the gene for Toll like receptor 4 (TLR-4) have been found to be associated with severe RSV bronchiolitis [20]. An association between differences in IL-13 genes and severe RSV infection has also been found [21]. Environmental factors, such as viral infections, may impact on genetically predisposed individuals to affect the development of asthma and the viral exacerbation of asthma.",

            "text": "In understanding the mechanisms underlying viral exacerbation of asthma, it is helpful to observe models of primary virus infection. Respiratory viruses including parainfluenza, influenza and RSV have been shown to induce airway inflammation and lung function changes in rodent models. In RSV infection in mice, airway inflammation and the development of AHR are dependent on the presence of the Th2 cytokines IL-5 [47] and IL-13 [48] and not on IFN-\u03b3, the most abundant cytokine produced during RSV infection. In addition, inflammation and lung function changes in this model depend on CD8+ T cells [49]. Taken together this suggests that type 2 cytokine producing CD8+ T cells may drive virus induced reactive airway disease. Further, respiratory viral infections lead to a marked expansion of mature DC in the lung [50]. These mature lung DC have a strong capacity to activate both na\u00efve and memory T cells and to induce their proliferation. In a model of influenza infection, maturation of lung DC resulted in strong immunogenicity of an otherwise non-immunogenic antigen [50]. Increases in numbers of lung DC, which arise from local precursors in the lung, outlast the resolution of disease in RSV infection [51]. Importantly, pulmonary DC can stimulate T-cell responses in the lung in situ without migration to the regional lymph nodes, favouring Th2 and Tc2 responses [52]. These observations suggest that respiratory viral infections lead to a prolonged period of increased antigen presentation in the airways resulting in de novo and memory T-cell responses not only to the virus but also to unrelated antigens including allergens.",

IL-4 is important in the exacerbation of asthma but the response is not solely dependent on IL-4 and IL-5 has been observed to increase in virally infected sensitized mice and has been directly associated with the viral exacerbation of asthma [57]. IL-10 is thought to be necessary for the development of allergic AHR [58], however, its role in viral exacerbation of AHR is less certain. The role of IL-10 is complex, inhibiting IL-5 production, eosinophilic inflammation and chemotaxis but potentially inducing a decrease in Th1 cytokine production [59]. Mice deficient in IL-10 that were both sensitized (to OVA) and infected with RSV did develop AHR including eosinophilic inflammation, Th2 cytokine production and goblet cell hyperplasia. Inhibition of IL-13 has been shown to significantly reduce AHR in sensitized and infected mice, to the level of that seen in mice only infected or only sensitized [60]. These factors all appear to contribute in varying extents to the viral exacerbation of asthma.",

These potent inflammatory mediators have a diverse range of biological activities, including the ability to exacerbate asthma by inducing the contraction of bronchial smooth muscle [61]. LTC4 has been found at elevated levels in the nasopharyngeal secretions of children during the acute phase of RSV infection, with higher levels in patients with lower respiratory tract involvement than in those with upper respiratory illness alone [62]. LTE4 has been found to be elevated in urine samples collected from patients with asthma exacerbations [63]. CysLT levels have also been found to be increased in the lower airways during RSV bronchiolitis, although their concentrations are lower than those in acute asthma [64]. In mice, RSV infection has been found to produce a marked increase in CysLTs in the BALF and lung tissue, resulting in the recruitment of neutrophils and lymphocytes into the airways and AHR [65]. CysLTs have been found to have multiple effects in animals, including the induction of Th2 responses in the lungs through effects on DCs and cytokine generation, the recruitment and activation of cells such as eosinophils and mast cells, and inflammation [63]. Interestingly, an LT synthesis blocker prevents the development of RSV induced lung function changes in mice [66] and montelukast, a CysLT antagonist, seems to reduce post-bronchiolitis wheeze in small children [67].",

IL-4 was induced only in the asthmatic group and the IFN-\u03b3/IL-4 ratio was more than three times lower in this group. This suggests that the normal type 1 immune response to RV infection is defective in atopic asthmatic individuals, with infection inducing a Th2-immune response similar to their response to allergens [74].",

Vaccination is the mainstay of prophylaxis for respiratory viruses; however, for some viruses such as RSV and RV, developing safe and effective vaccines has been difficult. Despite the need for anti-viral drugs as an adjunct to vaccines, few are available that are effective. Therefore, novel and new approaches are highly desirable. Recently, Mahalingam and Tindle have demonstrated the efficacy of an hMPV CTL epitope vaccine that triggers a strong Th1 immune response which was associated with accelerated viral clearance in a murine model [75]. In addition, RNA interference (RNAi), a naturally occurring process for controlling gene expression that occurs through a process mediated by short interfering RNA (siRNA) molecules, has been shown to have the remarkable ability to silence RSV replication both in vitro and in vivo (Tripp et al., unpublished data). These approaches can be used to target host cell genes to silence aspects of the inflammatory pathway that include Th1 or Th2 cytokines, chemokines or proteins that regulate their expression. Thus, disease intervention strategies that target the virus and/or host response are rational approaches for breaking the link between the synergy of virus infection and asthma.",

(A) During the early stages of a viral infection, antigen presenting cells (APCs: macrophages, DCs) become activated and secrete IL-12. Viral peptide is presented by APCs to na\u00efve T cells in association with MHC class I and co-stimulatory signals (B7 and CD28). The production of IL-12 and the binding of antigen-MHC molecules commit the differentiation of na\u00efve T cells to the Th1 cell subset that secretes Th1 cytokines including IFN-\u03b3. The cytokine contributes to the activation of macrophage (make more IL-12), B cells (make IgG2a) and cytotoxic T cell (kill infected cells). An IFN-\u03b3 dominated microenvironment inhibits the development of a Th2 cell subset. Together, these responses result in the resolution of the infection in the airways. (B) In the early phase of allergen exposure, cross linking of antigen-specific IgE on the surface of mast cells results in the activation and release of mediators that cause bronchoconstriction and inflammation. Activated mast cells also produce IL-4 that commits na\u00efve T cells to the Th2 subset as well as B cell isotype class switching to IgE production. In addition, antigenic peptide is presented to na\u00efve T cells by APCs in the context of MHC class II and co-stimulatory signals. In an IL-4 dominated microenvironment, this triggers the differentiation of na\u00efve T cells to Th2 cell subset that generates Th2 cytokines (IL-4, IL-5, IL-10 and IL-13). These cytokines are responsible for orchestrating the late phase of the allergic response. IL-4 and IL-13 contribute to mast cell activation and the synthesis of IgE. IL-5 is implicated in eosinophilia and is known to stimulate these cells, resulting in degranulation and release of toxic basic proteins (e.g. ECP, MBP). IL-10 inhibits APCs, therefore preventing IL-12 from initiating a Th1 immune response.",
