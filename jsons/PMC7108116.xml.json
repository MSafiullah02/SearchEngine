This coding assigned the most responsible diagnosis (primary cause) and different categories of comorbidities or secondary diagnoses (secondary causes). In Canada, ICD coding is done by trained coders and therefore not expected to result in much misclassification. The investigators reviewed each medical record to ensure that the ICD coding was consistent with their assessment of attribution in the unlikely event that there were errors in ICD coding. The role that RSV played in death was then classified as one of the following: primary cause of death, contributed to death but was not the primary cause, role undetermined (RSV might have contributed to death), or unrelated to death (would have died during this hospitalization even if they did not have RSV). Patients whose RSV infection was deemed to be unrelated to death (eg, if the RSV infection occurred many months prior to death) were excluded.

Byington et al performed a database review using ICD, Ninth Revision codes in the United States from 2000 to 2011 to characterize RSV-associated mortality and associated conditions in hospitalized children <2 years old. Similar to the study by Prill et al, most deaths occurred in those <12 months old (77%\u201388% depending on the database used) and most had a complex chronic condition, mostly cardiovascular [10].",

When only considering children <2 years old, the median age of death was 7 months in children in our case series compared with 3.5 months in Prill et al\u2019s study [9]. When only considering children <5 years old, the median age of death was 9 months in our case series compared to 7 months in Scheltema et al\u2019s study [11]. Therefore, it appears that the population in our case series was older than previous studies. Of note, more than one-third of our identified cases occurred in those >2 years old. RSV infection in older children may become more relevant with medical and technological advances, enabling patients with underlying complex medical conditions (eg, congenital heart disease and ventilator-dependent lung disease) to live longer while remaining vulnerable to severe RSV disease. Interestingly, however, the patients >2 years of age did not have more known risk factors for severe RSV infection compared to their younger counterparts, suggesting there may be other factors predisposing them to RSV-associated mortality. It is unclear why those older than 2 years had shorter durations of admission to hospital (P = .048) and to the ICU (P = .014) prior to death. Possibilities may include more rapid progression of disease or more delayed presentation to hospital. Nonetheless, nearly half of the deaths in our study occurred in infants, confirming this population as most vulnerable among pediatric patients, although older children may account for an increasing proportion of RSV-associated mortality in the future, which definitely warrants further study.",

Prill et al also revealed a similar finding, with 19% of children with RSV-associated death having no risk factor for severe disease [9]. When we compared the group with known risk factors to those with no known risk factors, the latter had a trend toward shorter duration of admission prior to death (13 days vs 27 days; P = .054). Again, it is unclear whether this is due to more rapid progression of disease or more delayed presentation to hospital. Patients with no known risk factors also tended to have more viral coinfections (30.8% vs 9.7%; P = .064), be older (median age of death, 21.5 months vs 10 months; P = .922), have infections outside of the typical RSV season (21.4% vs 12.3%; P = .401), and receive ECMO (21.4% vs 6.2%; P = .102). Other investigators have found that, in children with RSV-associated mortality, previously healthy children were younger than those with comorbidities (3.8\u20134 months vs 11 months) and occur more commonly within the RSV season (91%\u201397% vs 39%), in contrast to what we observed in our study [11]. Factors associated with severe disease outcomes such as mortality in previously healthy patients are largely undetermined. While overall small numbers of patients make it difficult to draw any concrete conclusions regarding these comparative findings at this point, it would be worthwhile to explore this further in future studies.

Another limitation is that the causative role of RSV in death was based solely on retrospective chart review; the direction of this bias could either be an overestimation or underestimation of RSV-associated deaths. The use of ICD codes to identify cases may underestimate the number of RSV-associated deaths. In this study, this would be unlikely, especially if RSV was thought to play a major role in the death. Such cases would have been captured by the ICD coding and reviewed by the study team. Also, our study sample was limited to those admitted to 1 of the 11 study sites, so population-based estimates could not be made.

For instance, infants and those with premature birth, chronic medical conditions (such as congenital heart defects), and immunodeficiencies (such as following hematopoietic stem cell transplants) would likely benefit most from such preventive programs.
