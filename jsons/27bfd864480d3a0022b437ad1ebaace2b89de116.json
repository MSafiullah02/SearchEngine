There are patients infected with SARS-CoV-2 and presymptomatic or asymptomatic [13] [14] [15] [16] [17] [18] [19] . A presymptomatic patient has virus present but is not yet manifesting any signs or symptoms of COVID-19. In the asymptomatic patient, radiographic changes (in the lung) are present, but the patient lacks any symptoms or has symptoms attributed to a different process (e.g., occasional cough in a patient with thoracic disease) [15] [16] [17] [18] [19] . Recognizing this potential hazard, the \"American Association of Nurse Anesthetists, American Society of Anesthesiologists, Anesthesia Patient Safety Foundation, and American Academy of Anesthesiologist Assistants recommend as optimal practice that all anesthesia professionals should utilize personal protective equipment appropriate for aerosol-generating procedures for all patients when working near the airway\" [20, 21] . We presume that all operating room staff (i.e., anesthesia providers, surgeons, and nurses) would be using some version of droplet precautions for all such patients [20, 21] . Other authors have discussed the implementation of barrier protection strategies, such as the use of traditional surgical mask and face shield, well fit N95 mask and face shield, etc. For our purposes of considering the economics of ambulatory surgery in the COVID era, we correspondingly partition ambulatory surgery into three categories: (Section 3) no aerosol production by both the surgical procedure and the anesthetic, (Section 4) aerosol production by tracheal intubation and extubation, and (Section 5) aerosol production by the surgical procedure and general anesthetic.",

Therefore, we expect that all patients undergoing anesthesia will have RT-PCR testing the day before surgery. Early in the disease, viral load is predominantly that of the upper airway (nasopharynx, oropharynx) [22, 23] . RT-PCR testing of the oropharynx (subsequently referred to as \"COVID-19 testing\") has high sensitivity [22, 23] . The negative predictive value probably is effectively 99.9%, and patients would be receiving topical viral decolonization preoperatively (see Section 3). Therefore, we expect limited economic effects of COVID-19 from presymptomatic and asymptomatic patients not undergoing general anesthesia. However, during progression of the disease, there is a substantive false negative rate of oropharyngeal testing observed clinically [24] [25] [26] [27] . Bronchoalveolar lavage specimens have detectable SARS-CoV-2 for more samples (93%) than sputum (72%), and much more than oropharyngeal swabs (32%) [28] . Consequently, as we address in Sections 4 and 5, we expect large economic effects of COVID-19 from patients receiving general anesthesia.",

Consequently, there would not be a need for airborne precautions [31] . Restricting many operating rooms from aerosol producing surgical procedures and general anesthesia would be practical because ambulatory surgery visits in the USA in 2006 were performed without general anesthesia for 69% of visits [32] . Anesthetics performed without general anesthesia accounted for 72% (SE 2%) of the anesthesia minutes among ambulatory surgery procedures performed in the USA in 2010 with an anesthesiologist and/or nurse anesthetists [33] . These statistics are functional overestimates because some aerosol producing procedures (e.g., upper gastrointestinal endoscopy) [30] are coded as being monitored anesthesia care even though the patient is \"deeply\" sedated for at least a portion of the procedure. Nevertheless, the point is that more than half of ambulatory surgery is performed without general anesthesia. There also are many common interventional procedures performed with local anesthesia alone, again with interventional pain procedures as examples [34, 35] . For this review, we reanalyzed the 2010 national survey data to find that 18% (SE 2%) of the ambulatory procedure room time was performed without an anesthesiologist or nurse anesthetist [36] .",

Multiple steps can be followed to mitigate this risk, as follows. (a) Decolonize patients using preprocedural chlorhexidine wipes, two doses of nasal povidone-iodine [41] within 1 h of incision, and chlorhexidine mouth rinse [42] [43] [44] [45] [46] [47] . In the unlikely event of an upper respiratory sample for COVID-19 being false negative among patients with presymptomatic disease, SARS-CoV-2 will have been inactivated [48] . (b) Designate and maintain clean and dirty areas [49] . (c) Place alcohol-based hand rubs on the intravenous pole to the left of the providerspatial orientation matters [50] . (d) Place a wire basket lined with a zip closure plastic bag on the intravenous pole to the right of the provider, for deposit of contaminated instruments (e.g., laryngoscope blade and handle) [49] . (e) Create a closed lumen intravenous system and use hub disinfection [51, 52] ; prevent bacterial infection and coronavirus viremia [53] . (f) Double glove before touching the patient's nose/mouth and remove the outer glove following contact (e.g., placement of a nasal cannula) [54] [55] [56] . (g) After patient positioning, wipe down equipment and high-touch surfaces with disinfection wipes that contain a quaternary ammonium compound and alcohol [40, 49, [56] [57] [58] [59] . (h) Provide data feedback by surveillance of Enterococcus, Staphylococcus aureus, Klebsiella, Acinetobacter, Pseudomonas, and Enterobacter spp. (ESKAPE) transmission to provide feedback on the application of these basic preventive measures [60] [61] [62] . These processes (a-h) are known because they significantly reduce the transmission of pathogenic bacteria and viruses [37] [38] [39] [40] [42] [43] [44] [45] [49] [50] [51] [52] 54, 55, 63] . They are important, but not unique to COVID-19. As an illustrative example, orthopedic surgery under spinal blockade neither produces aerosol from the nose/throat nor uses general anesthesia, yet patient nasal decontamination reduces surgical site infections [46] . The consequence of COVID-19 is that they are more important than ever to follow, because infection affects not only the patients but also the ambulatory surgery center staff and surgeons.",

The use of peripheral regional anesthesia reduces how long patients stay in the phase I post-anesthesia care unit [69, 73, 74] and their time to discharge [75] . Monitored anesthesia care also facilitates bypass of the phase I post-anesthesia care unit [76] [77] [78] .

Potentially, some anesthesia machines may be out of service awaiting terminal decontamination due to their use for COVID-19 patients who developed respiratory failure. However, sedation, peripheral nerve blocks, and spinal anesthetics can be performed safely, although not ideally, in the absence of an anesthesia machine. Regardless, essential surgery needs to be completed. To reduce the progressively growing surgical queues, shifts should be as long as reasonable (e.g., 12 h) [1] . Considerable data show that with this approach, ambulatory surgery centers have underutilized capacity; extending working hours to 5 PM or 7 PM would contribute substantively to reducing the national surgical queues, which are progressively growing. The United States' 2010 national ambulatory surgery survey included outpatient surgery performed at hospitals and unaffiliated free-standing surgery centers [36] . There was 64% (SE 1%) of all operating room time completed before 12 noon, and 90% (SE 1%) before 3:00 PM [36] . Data for all surgery in hospitals in Iowa 2013 through 2015 were studied [79] . Among the 117 hospitals, on days when a surgeon performed at least one ambulatory surgery case, they performed only 1 or 2 cases total for 77% (SE 2%) of such days and just 1 case for 54% (SE 2%) [79] . This shows available capacity for more surgery because those single cases were of brief duration (e.g., the most common being \"repair initial inguinal hernia, age 5 years or older, reducible\") [79] .",

We do not think that ambulatory surgery centers will be able to sustain reporting and contact tracing for all providers and patients exposed to a nurse or anesthesia provider who develops COVID-19 several days after their shift. (For COVID-19, the mean days from infection to symptom onset is 5 days [95% confidence interval 4 to 7] with 95th percentile 12 days [9 to 18]) [87] .

The incidences of prolonged times to extubation, meaning end of surgery to tracheal extubation, are negligibly small for cases of such brief duration [90, 91] . There are multiple studies from the late 1990s and early 2000s on the use of different anesthetic techniques to achieve faster initial recovery for the patient to have a very brief phase I post-anesthesia recovery time [76, [92] [93] [94] [95] [96] [97] . Anesthesia providers might need to alter some of their routine anesthetic practices accordingly. Regardless, having patients initially recover in operating rooms is a considerable change administratively for ambulatory surgery centers in North America that do not routinely bypass the phase I postanesthesia care unit among their patients undergoing general anesthesia.",

Additionally, there would be multimodal environmental decontamination after each case [1] . This process includes treating operating rooms using a source generating ultraviolet-C [98, 99] or equivalently fast technology to supplement personnel cleaning. Usual operating room and recovery cleaning practices, especially for noncritical items, are often inadequate [58, 59, 100, 101] . For many ambulatory surgery centers, this will increase turnover times considerably. Regardless, nearly all operating rooms are positively pressurized with respect to the external environment, meaning that contamination is spread away from the operating room table to the walls and exterior, even when doors are 1 open [102] [103] [104] [105] . Statistical methods to help the ambulatory surgery center determine how many housekeepers are needed have been developed and validated [106] [107] [108] [109] . These methods are useful in part because they are non-intuitive. First, determine the times of the workday when there are the largest number of unusually long turnovers, using one-hour epochs [106] . Making graphs or tables of the counts by hour will be helpful because the workdays should be far longer than typical before COVID-19 for ambulatory surgery centers [36, 79] . This increase in the length of the workday will occur because long-shifts reduce the amount of personal protective equipment used and reduce patient queues for care [1] . The graphs and tables help managers determine the times when the largest numbers of housekeepers are needed [106] . Next, each increase in the number of housekeepers and/or turnover teams will be associated with less overall mean minutes that teams work later than planned [107, 109] and lesser probability of prolonged turnovers [107, 108] . However, the relationship is asymptotic such that each increase in the numbers of housekeepers or teams has progressively lesser benefit [107, 109] . A useful statistic to use for managerial decisions is the mean daily minutes when the number of simultaneous turnovers is exceeding the number of housekeepers or teams [107] . The statistic is related directly to the minutes that teams will work later than planned [107] . The difference is taken in the statistic calculated with and without the addition of 1 more housekeeper or team [107] .",

We think that a good analogy would be the management of cases on Saturdays. The reason is that among US surgical suites on Saturdays, anesthesia and nursing teams often can have each team working in 2 operating rooms, allowing cleaning and setup while they are caring for another patient [8] . We previously published a review article for making operating room management decisions to reduce the hours that staffs work late for use by surgical suites with long (\u226510 h) workdays [110] . The methods apply directly. In the current paper, we do not repeat this extensive and fully covered topic [110] .

That characteristically would be done by the combination of service and day of the week [110, 113, 114] . This usually is important because there are substantial differences among combinations of service and day of the week [115] . After the peak of the COVID-19 pandemic has subsided, at facilities with a nearly unlimited queue of patients for surgery and with staff working at most 12 h daily, this mathematics can be skipped. These dual objectives will need to be met while relying on few historical data [116] [117] [118] [119] [120] for cases' operating room times by procedure because previously phase I post-anesthesia care was not in the operating rooms. Ambulatory surgery centers (i.e., facilities performing many brief cases) [36] should schedule cases into operating room hours selected by policy (e.g., 11 h) calculated for the end of the day to finish reliably by 12-h [121, 122] . Case scheduling would pack as much as possible into those hours while not causing over-utilized time [110, 112, 123] .",

Because one patient is not more important than another, brief duration essential procedures should take precedence over longer ones because more patients will receive care. Ambulatory surgery cases with anesthesiologist or nurse anesthetist are brief, averaging 61 min (SE 2 min) of operating room time and 72 min (SE 2 min) of total recovery time to discharge, by national US survey [36] . Thus, performing cases in ambulatory surgery centers, especially those without general anesthesia, serves the objective of increasing societal utility. When patients have initial phase I post-anesthesia care in the operating room, after general anesthesia or surgery with aerosol production, the anesthesia provider could staff the recovery. That would be logical if they would not go right away to another room to start a case. If they would start another case in another room, the post-anesthesia care unit nurse could come to the room, as done for some regional anesthetics [64] . That would, however, increase exposure of more healthcare workers to each patient during the period of airborne precautions and consume more personal protective equipment [1] .",
