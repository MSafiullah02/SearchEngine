In veterinary medicine, health has been defined as \u201ca state of physical and psychological well-being and of productivity, including reproduction\u201d and \u201chealth indices\u201d refer to easily observed parameters that can be used as a guide to the animal\u2019s or group\u2019s state of health (e.g., food intake, fecal output, body weight) [7]. It has recently been proposed to redefine health as \u201cthe ability to adapt and to self-manage\u201d [8,9], i.e., an organism is healthy if it is capable of maintaining physiological homeostasis through changing circumstances. If it is unable to mount a protective response, reducing the potential for harm and restoring an (adapted) equilibrium, damage remains and may result in illness [9]. Accordingly, measuring health is challenging and requires tools for assessing an individual\u2019s capacity to cope and to adapt. It is also important to differentiate between the health status of individuals and that of populations [9].",

Population health is concerned with the definition and measurement of health outcomes (the dependent variables) and the roles of determinants (the independent variables). The term \u201chealth outcome\u201d is preferred over \u201chealth status\u201d, because the latter refers to health at a point in time rather than to health over a period of years [10]. A hallmark of the field of population health is significant attention to the multiple determinants of health outcomes and their interactions, i.e., examining: systematic differences in outcomes across populations; the complexity of interactions among determinants; the biological pathways linking determinants to population health outcomes; the influence of different determinants over time and throughout the life cycle. While specific investigations into a single determinant, outcome measure, or policy intervention are relevant and may even be critical in some cases, they must be recognized as being only part of a more complex picture [10].",

Virulence and pathogenicity both refer to the ability of a pathogen to cause disease. However, while virulence is a continuous variable defined by the amount of damage that is caused, pathogenicity refers to the quality of disease induction and is a discontinuous variable (yes or no) referring to the capacity of a microbe to cause damage in a (susceptible) host [14]. It is not possible to draw a clear and unequivocal distinction between pathogens and non-pathogens. Properties conferring pathogenicity depend as much on the host as they do on the microorganism. They may be influenced by multiple factors such as environmental stress, pollutants and other microorganisms [15-17]. Such alterations can create conditions in which the host becomes vulnerable to microbes which were previously non-pathogenic. When the immune response of the host to a microbe is insufficient, microbial factors can cause damage; when microbial factors fail to stimulate the immune system, the microbe can disseminate and cause disease; and when the immune response to a microbe is too exuberant, it can be the immune response itself that is responsible for the pathology. In other words, pathogenicity can be due to the immune response to the pathogen rather than to the pathogen itself [14]. Consequently, attempts to classify micro- or macroparasites as pathogens, non-pathogens, opportunists, commensals and so forth are misguided because they attribute a property to the parasite that is instead a function of the host, the parasite and their interaction [14].",

In short, surveillance means \u201cinformation for action\u201d. Its purpose is to support effective decision-making, including policy and priority setting, response to outbreaks and approval of trade movements. The outputs generated by wildlife surveillance systems can include the detection of new disease events, the demonstration of freedom from specific diseases or infections, or identification of the level and distribution of diseases endemically present in a population [18,19]. The first integral activities of disease surveillance are detection of disease or pathogens. Further activities include information management, i.e. analysis of the collected data and use of the surveillance information for decision-making and policy formulation [20]. For these two last aspects, it is essential to record and store data, e.g., to continuously conduct a database and to communicate important results such as disease emergence to the competent managers and authorities. Indeed, a key aspect of health surveillance is the early detection of outbreaks or what we call early warning systems.",

It usually corresponds to clinical surveillance aimed at detecting dead or visibly sick animals (followed by diagnosis or precise disease identification), i.e., identifying disease events in which wild animals are the victims [4,20]. Scanning surveillance is typically performed by investigation of animal carcasses or tissues from dead animals. The accurate identification of a mortality event requires a thorough pathological examination carried out by a wildlife specialist following standardized procedures and complemented by further laboratory analyses [5]. However, in the case of important pathogens such as zoonotic agents or those with economic importance for which wildlife hosts may act as healthy carriers, surveillance cannot be based on the collection of clinical data such as morbidity or mortality [5].",

Traditionally, targeted surveillance of wildlife has relied on a cross-sectional study design because this only requires a point sample (single capture or sample collection). Collected data most often relate to the identification of risk factors associated with disease, pathogen, or antibody prevalence. It is therefore essential to aim at a sample size that can provide reliable prevalence estimates and statistical comparison and to incorporate relevant biological, spatial and temporal variables [21].",

Data from slaughtered farmed wildlife such as deer of from domestic animals potentially exposed to wildlife pathogens provide evidence of pathology as well as samples of blood and parasites [18,22-24]. Appropriate diagnostics (such as standardized health screening, ancillary diagnostic tests and thorough postmortem examinations) on diseased wild animals submitted to wildlife rehabilitation centers can enhance surveillance efforts [21,25-27]. Clinical examinations can be performed within the context of wildlife captures [28,29] and are an essential component of translocation programs due to the substantial health risks involved [30]. Photo-trapping can deliver valuable information about diseases with typical external lesions such as sarcoptic mange [31] (Figure 1). Infrared thermal imaging has been tested as a potential tool for the tele-diagnosis of sarcoptic mange in the Spanish ibex (Capra pyrenaica) [32]. Non-invasive samples, such as feces, hair and feathers may be suitable for the detection of pathogens or toxic compounds. For example, in a study on endoparasites in Alpine ibex (Capra ibex ibex), the number of feces samples collected from captured animals was insufficient for a comprehensive study and was substantially increased by collecting feces from the ground [29]. Finally, questionnaire surveys and interviews with wildlife managers, hunters and others working in the field can provide valuable information on disease occurrence.",

It is an important principle of participatory epidemiology that stakeholders such as animal owners (or, in the case of wildlife, hunters or game-wardens) have valuable technical knowledge essential to understanding epidemiological scenarios. Obtained data can be validated by triangulation when information from diverse sources is collected. This method has been successfully applied to the surveillance of sarcoptic mange, a disease characterized by typical macroscopic skin lesions [33,34], and to document an epidemic of an alopecic syndrome associated with deer ked (Lipoptena cervi) infestation in Norwegian moose (Alces alces) [35].

Syndromic surveillance is meant as an early warning system aimed at identifying case clusters before diagnoses can be confirmed and reported to the relevant health agencies, in order to mobilize a rapid response [39]. A syndrome is a collection of frequently associated clinical signs putatively linked to a given etiology or to given risk factors. Syndromes usually refer to incompletely defined diseases. Thus, syndromic surveillance uses the clinical, pathological or epidemiologic characteristics of disease occurrences to assess whether these are linked, instead of relying on the detection of etiologic agents or well-defined disease pictures. The number of cases with defined syndromes can be tracked in space or time [4,5]. Macroscopic findings were indeed shown to be valuable for identifying distinct pathological profiles among collected wild animal carcasses. Besides the potential usefulness for early outbreak detection, this classification system represents a tool for retrospective investigations [40]. In a study on roe deer (Capreolus capreolus capreolus) mortality in Switzerland, classifying data according to syndromes has proven useful for describing morbidity and morbidity causes, including analyses of cases of unclear etiology [41].",

Investigations into the efficacy of using different information sources for detecting disease occurrence showed that analysis of indicator animals (i.e., animals found dead or presenting disease signs) is more efficient than analysis of animals expected to be healthy (such as hunted animals). This observation led to the recommendation of focusing surveillance efforts on indicator animals when a disease of concern appears to be absent in a wildlife population. Enhanced surveillance efforts, including systematic sampling of apparently healthy animals for prevalence estimation, should only be implemented when cases have been detected. Towards the end of an outbreak, the aim of disease surveillance should shift back to case detection [44]. This approach has been applied for rabies in Switzerland, where surveillance efforts progressively evolved towards clinical surveillance after rabies was eradicated [45].",

It is important to define which parameters to target (e.g., lesion, pathogen, antibody). Selection will depend on factors such as the host species, expected sample size, logistic constraints, cost of laboratory analyses and specificity and sensitivity of diagnostic tests [46]. A pathological examination is required to determine the cause of death or disease of an animal. This examination identifies tissue lesions and paves the way for appropriate additional investigations, such as bacteriological or parasitological examination. Also, the presence of lesions must be demonstrably associated with a given pathogen to prove that an etiological link exists between pathogen and death. Detection of exposure to pathogens is generally achieved by laboratory analyses such as agent isolation, PCR testing or serology [5]. To spare costs, it may be advisable to pool samples for analysis [37,46,47]. Non-infectious diseases may require toxicologic or genetic investigations. Toxicology is a discipline of major importance in wildlife, as both intentional poisoning and accidental intoxications frequently occur [48]. Illegal killing of wildlife is a widespread problem worldwide, and forensic approaches may be necessary when determining the cause of death in wild animals.",

In many cases, researchers ignore whether or not strains circulating among domestic and wild populations are similar. As a consequence, epidemiological cycles of infectious diseases are not well assessed in any of the populations of concern [11]. In the case of infectious keratoconjunctivitis caused by Mycoplasma conjunctivae in Alpine ruminants, molecular studies revealed the simultaneous occurrence of the same strain of M. conjunctivae in different hosts of the same region, supporting the hypothesis of interspecific transmission [49]. Strains of M. conjunctivae identical to each other were also identified both in healthy and diseased hosts, suggesting that factors other than the strain of mycoplasma determine the outcome of an infection [50,51]. In contrast, comparison of Brucella suis from wild boar (Sus scrofa) and domestic pigs from the same geographical area presented differences that did not support the assumption that wild boar were the source of the outbreak in pigs [24,52].",

For example, a survey on archived samples revealed that Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis, the causing agent of chytridiomycosis in amphibians, is more widely distributed in Europe than previously thought.

In the case of emerging infectious diseases, knowledge of risk factors is considered to be particularly important, as such data represent a tool for targeted surveillance and prevention such as improving decisions on land-use policies [46]. The same disease at the interface of the same two species may behave differently in different areas or situations, due to different climatic environments; different management of one or both species; shared food, water and mineral resources; population densities; predation variables; concurrent diseases, and so forth [21,60]. Therefore, sampling stratification is essential [46], and similar studies should be carried out in different regions with well characterized disease patterns.

            "text": "The same infectious agent may have different pathogenic effects in different host species. First, some agents are truly species-specific. Second, susceptibility may vary among susceptible hosts. For example, only mammals are susceptible to rabies. Among carnivore species, canids, mephitids, procyonids and viverids are highly susceptible, while felids and mustelids show a lower susceptibility or receptivity [63]. Similarly, M. conjunctivae generally causes more severe disease in Alpine chamois (Rupicapra rupicapra rupicapra) than in Alpine ibex, and different strains of M. conjunctivae may or may not cause disease in either species [49-51]. Furthermore, species-specific social behavior influences the frequency and intensity of intraspecific contacts and consequently the transmission rate of infectious agents, the case incidence and disease spread among a host population [13,60]. The probability of contacts and risk of epidemic spread is therefore higher for social or gregarious animals than for solitary species. For example, while sarcoptic mange and distemper rapidly spread among red fox populations, cases in more solitary species like the Eurasian lynx remain isolated [28,64]. Gregarious lifestyle and inter-group movements have been shown to contribute to tuberculosis maintenance in some species despite low overall prevalence in the population [43]. Disease spread may also vary among sexes depending on the social organization of the species. In an epidemic of infectious keratoconjunctivitis in Alpine chamois in the Swiss Alps, numerous females and juveniles died while solitary adult males remained largely unaffected; after the mating season, the number of affected males dramatically increased [65]. Finally, interspecific interactions need to be considered when assessing the epidemiological role of a host species. Among other things, it is necessary to assess the real status of livestock to determine the epidemiological role of a wild species in domestic animal disease [11,46]. For example, investigations on bluetongue, bovine viral diarrhea virus and other abortive agents in wild ruminants from Switzerland suggest that wildlife is not a reservoir but rather an occasional spillover host for these pathogens, as infections of wild ruminants is only sporadic while domestic ruminants display significantly higher prevalences of infection [37,47,66]. Interspecific interactions can also influence disease dynamics in other ways. Thus, marked advances of the epidemic front of sarcoptic mange in Sweden were associated with new vole cycles, possibly because years with high vole numbers (i.e., high prey numbers for foxes) result in high reproduction and juvenile fox survival rates and thus in enhanced fox dispersal [67].",

Time is a quantitative scale against which all other aspects of disease can and should be measured [69]. The season of sampling should be considered whenever assessing the risk of infection by pathogens [70] or using wildlife as an accumulative bioindicator of environmental pollution [11]. Pathogen transmission is affected by climatic conditions (survival of the pathogen in the environment, activity of arthropod vectors, geographical distribution of host species) [18] as well as by intraspecific contacts (e.g., mating season) [65] and interspecific interactions (e.g., presence of livestock on alpine pastures during the summer grazing season) [49,71]. Severe weather events can affect host immunity and nutrition if they interrupt forage availability and feeding patterns [18,70], as well as the abundance of arthropod vectors [13]. Seasonal changes in hormonal activities may also influence host susceptibility [72]. Because seasonal changes can be related either to climatic conditions or to physiological and behavioral patterns, it has been proposed that seasons be specified both as calendar seasons and as species-specific biologic periods [51,73]. An example of climate-related seasonal disease pattern is the observed increased prevalence of sarcoptic mange in Iberian ibex (Capra pyrenaica) in the Sierra Nevada in winter and spring months, probably because low temperature and high relative humidity are favorable to mange mites [74].",

Migratory behavior is strongly linked to seasonal changes and typically allows for contacts with other hosts and thus for pathogen spread and acquisition. For example, vertical short-distance migration in red deer (Cervus elaphus elaphus) in the Swiss Alps and food shortage in winter enhances the risk of contacts between red deer and cattle during the cold season. When red deer move to lower altitudes and share food resources with domestic livestock, a situation known as a risk factor for pathogen transmission arises [37]. Prevalence of low pathogenic avian influenza virus in ducks in the northern hemisphere is highest during late summer and early fall (pre-migration staging) and declines during winter [68]. More importantly, horizontal long-distance bird migration has most likely played a major role in the spread of highly pathogenic H5N1 avian influenza in Europe [75]. Finally, biological dispersal (animal movement away from an existing population or from the parent organisms) is known to contribute to pathogen spread. For example, red fox dispersal is believed to favor the propagation of sarcoptic mange [67].",

Spatial epidemiology also enables to investigate relationships between the environment and the presence of disease, and to predict disease spread [76]. Natural barriers such as rivers and mountain ranges can temporarily block disease spread, as has been observed for infectious keratoconjunctivitis in Alpine chamois and for rabies in red fox in Switzerland [65,77]. Spatial representation of pathogen exposure in different species can also contribute to the understanding of epidemiological roles. Thus, investigations in Switzerland suggest that infections of wild ruminants with bluetongue virus are associated with foci of infection in domestic ruminants [47]. Similarly, exposure of wild ruminants to the viral bovine diarrhea virus seems to be related to their presence on summer Alpine pastures where interactions with cattle regularly occur [37]. Differences in human population density have been shown to be associated with significantly different exposure to Toxoplasma gondii and Orthopoxvirus in Swedish Eurasian lynx. This could relate to the concomitant presence of domestic cats in the area [61,73].",

For example, sarcoptic mange has had a stronger impact on red fox populations in boreal forests than in mixed agriculture-forest areas of Sweden. This is presumably because groups of foxes are larger and live in smaller territories in highly productive regions, and because the more patchy distribution of food and shelters favor disease spread [78]. Environmental characteristics such as temperature and humidity can impact pathogen survival. Thus, foxes are more often infected with Echinococcus multilocularis in humid than dry environments [79]. Pathogen and disease distribution can also vary with altitude (due to variations in the distribution of susceptible hosts and in the occurrence of arthropod vectors) and with sun exposure (influencing climatic conditions and thus pathogen persistence in the environment) [18]. The results of recent investigations on infectious keratoconjunctivitis in wild Caprinae have suggested a role of altitude (or associated environmental conditions such as UV-light, temperature, humidity) in pathogenesis of eye lesions due to Mycoplasma conjunctivae[80]. Also, soil composition, vegetation and stagnating water can influence the occurrence of pathogens and their vectors or the presence of toxic compounds [18]. Overall, natural and anthropogenic barriers and spatial distribution of wild and domestic hosts need to be taken into consideration when defining epidemiological or sampling units [37,50,66,81].",

However, analytical and experimental approaches are also needed to study causal relationships (how and why). Controlled experiments allow for a better understanding of pathogenesis, contribute to the development and validation of diagnostic methods and to targeted management recommendations [21,56]. Experimental studies should ideally combine lab experiments (e.g., experimental infections) with field experiments (e.g., testing hypotheses regarding the effect of host aggregation and density on disease prevalence or pathogen persistence). Furthermore, mathematical modeling may help to identify knowledge gaps and design experimental research [56]. Models can also contribute to the understanding of disease dynamics and the impact of diseases on populations [84,85]. However, it is important to remain cautious in basing models on extrapolations of information about other species, as this can lead to erroneous conclusions [86].",

Veterinarians and other health professionals must become integral parts of the teams dealing with wildlife management and research [88]. In the frame of field projects, veterinarians ought to participate fully in project planning and realization and should not only become involved when emergencies occur such as injured animals or critical wildlife immobilization events [30,59]. Similarly, veterinarians must collaborate with experts in other disciplines when addressing questions related to wildlife health. In particular, cooperation with field ecologists and wildlife managers with a good knowledge of the local host populations is invaluable.",

In contrast, the human dimension of wildlife investigations is rarely addressed. This is rather surprising as the collaboration with field professionals, local managers and the general public, is usually essential to accessing information on wildlife health. Nevertheless, there has been a recent recommendation for taking the country\u2019s historical and cultural context into account in the frame of wildlife sampling [4]. The increasing interest in participatory epidemiology also underlines the need for a customer-oriented approach. Pro-active work in the field and the delivery of surveillance outputs that are meaningful to stakeholders are required, because motivation to carry out effective disease surveillance will decrease in the absence of adequate feedback [19]. Participatory approaches, translated into the field of wildlife disease investigation, mean improved communication between hunters or wildlife managers and animal health services. Presence of researchers in the field (e.g. participation in sample collection, courses) combined with providing regular feedback to field partners positively influences the access to general information on disease occurrence and facilitates sample collection [89].",

Funding attributed for future research may even depend on these factors. While this pressure encourages researchers to publish their data, it may discourage them from reporting information arising from small sample sizes, which is considered less valuable than results from more elaborate, larger studies. However, the difficulties inherent in wildlife health investigations (see below), the need for baseline data, the complete lack of reports in certain regions of the world or on secretive species, may render anecdotal information or negative results valuable for surveillance purposes. Also, it is important to keep in mind that publication is a means of communication for sharing experience and information, and not primarily a vehicle for prestige and recognition. Negative data are greatly underrepresented in the literature despite the fact that they can be extremely important to our understanding of diseases [21]. Among others, the absence of pathogen exposure detection provides necessary baseline data in the surveillance of emerging diseases. Similarly, the value of publishing failed experiments is underestimated. It is important that we benefit from each other mistakes and not continue to reinvent the wheel [94].",

Scanning surveillance requires the observation of clinically diseased or dead animals, reporting these observations, and the submission of carcasses or samples by the public and field professionals for analysis. Overall, only a very small portion of dead wildlife is both found and examined. Wild animals may inhabit remote areas and are often difficult to approach and examine; clinical expression may be brief [5] and survival behaviors often mask clinical signs of disease in wildlife [86]; capture and containment of moribund animals may not be feasible and represents additional steps to be surmounted in the submission chain [21]. Predation, scavenging and carcass decomposition may obscure the observation of dead animals and usually complicate the diagnostic process when carcasses are found [21,86]. Detection biases can arise from the cause of death. For example, a study on Eurasian lynx showed that infectious diseases are underrepresented in animals found by chance while mortality resulting from anthropogenic activities is overrepresented [95]. The use of dogs has been shown to be an efficient method for increasing detection of diseased or dead animals, including medium-sized to small mammals particularly difficult to detect, and thus of decreasing bias in the recovered study material [96,97].",

The perceived value of individual species (e.g., game vs. non-game) or perceived need for a submission (mass mortality vs. single case, awareness of pathogen spread) will largely influence the decision of whether or not to submit a carcass for pathological investigation [21]. Thus, after the first cases of H5N1 highly pathogenic avian influenza were discovered in Switzerland in 2006, a significant rise of bird carcass submission was noticed at the Centre for Fish and Wildlife Health (FIWI) in Bern although all potential influenza cases were sent to the reference laboratory at Zurich University (Figure 2). Similarly, the number of submitted red foxes and Eurasian badgers (Meles meles) dramatically increased during an epidemic of distemper in wild carnivores [64], including cases that had died of other diseases (FIWI archives, unpublished data). However, despite the listed impediments, scanning surveillance retains considerable potential value. It provides an ideal setting for disease discovery, in particular of emerging diseases of wildlife, as has been the case for chronic wasting disease and bovine tuberculosis in the United States [21], for babesiosis in Alpine chamois and salmonellosis in passerine birds in Switzerland [98,99] or for avian pox in British tit species [100].",

To guarantee a certain level of detection and accuracy, the number of samples needed is a function of the population size combined with the expected number of positive animals. When an expected prevalence is not known, sampling intensity should focus on finding at least one positive animal assuming a very low prevalence, which often requires a very large sample size [68]. This approach has been successfully used in studies on bluetongue virus and bovine viral diarrhea virus infections in wild ruminants in Switzerland [37,47]. Ideally, samples originate from sources that do not compromise animal health. However, capture options are often limited. Wildlife trapping requires a considerable know-how, is extremely demanding in both time and financial resources and may result in very low sample sizes [21,94]. For example, in Switzerland in the winter of 2011/2012, six months of \u201ccapture duty\u201d with three different capture systems [102] and the contributions of numerous biologists, veterinarians, hunters and professional game wardens, resulted in the capture of four Eurasian lynx. Similarly, three capture seasons of 2\u20133 months each involving full-time presence of a capture team in the fields on a single study site resulted in samples from 39 ibex [29], while blood samples from 520 hunted ibex were obtained during the corresponding hunting seasons [66].

In the case of large sample sizes, sample volume and shipment costs also need to be considered [103-105]. Depending on the objectives of the study, samples such as swabs or body fluids may represent a suitable alternative to tissue collection and significantly increase hunters\u2019 compliance. Filter papers seem to be a promising tool for antibody surveys, as they are an inexpensive sample media well suited for harsh environmental conditions [103]. Similarly, FTA technology (fast technology for analysis of nucleic acids, i.e., a paper-based system designed to fix and store nucleic acids directly from fresh tissues) represents an alternative method when field conditions limit the ability to properly store or ship traditional sample materials. Among others, the cards can inactivate infectious agents, which reduces the risk and restrictions associated with transporting samples [105]. When samples like blood or body fluids are not obtainable from carcasses, the use of fluids obtained from organ samples such as lung extract [106] or meat juice [107] may be considered.",

Many tests designed for domestic mammal samples do not have the same levels of sensitivity and specificity when used in wild species [5,56]. Whereas tests aimed at directly detecting the pathogen usually give similar results in both domestic and wild animals, indirect tests such as ELISA \u2013 which are based on detecting the immune response of the host to the pathogen and thus depend on the recognition of specific proteins associated with that response \u2013 may not deliver reliable results [5]. Validation of diagnostic tests in wildlife is associated with a number of challenges such as the difficulty to obtain enough positive and negative controls, the lack of gold standards, the large number of animal species and limited financial resources. Nevertheless, efforts made to overcome these problems are increasing. For example: the EWDA Wildlife Health Surveillance Network has initiated the edition of Diagnosis Cards recommending diagnostic techniques appropriate for wildlife testing (http://www.ewda.org); the WildTech Project aims at developing new technologies for the improvement of wildlife health surveillance (http://www.wildtechproject.com); and the APHAEA project will propose harmonized methods for diagnostic investigations in wildlife (http://www.aphaea.eu).",

In a susceptible animal, exposure may lead to inapparent (or silent/subclinical) infection or to clinical infection with disease signs of variable severity and resulting in different outcomes including chronic illness, recovery, or death. Despite the absence of clinical signs, infected animals may shed the pathogen either continuously or intermittently. Such a carrier status may occur in inapparent infections (healthy carriers), during incubation (incubatory carriers), or during recovery (convalescent carriers) [114]. Considerable misunderstanding has arisen from using serosurveys for wildlife disease surveillance because the distinction between infection (past or current) and disease is not always recognized. This leads to the misconception that infectious diseases are widespread in free-ranging wild populations. When an infectious agent is endemic and the host has evolved in this given environment, disease is the exception, not the rule [13]. For example, the hemoparasite Cytauxzoon felis is widespread in healthy bobcats (Lynx rufus) and only rarely associated with clinical signs, but it generally causes fatal acute disease in domestic cats [115].",

Counting horn cementum annuli of tooth roots allows exact determination of age in many animals and is often applied on carnivores [73,118] but it is very expensive.

In this context, direct human contacts are essential for a sustainable surveillance system. Close interactions with field partners and regular feedback should be an integral part of any project requiring wildlife samples. Sharing knowledge is a bilateral process in which all involved partners give and receive.

Different methods may also act in synergy: presence in the fields for targeted sampling usually increases disease awareness in hunters and game wardens, who may subsequently submit more cases for scanning surveillance; feedback from the laboratory to the fields in the form of reports on investigated carcasses will encourage field partners to participate in future sampling campaigns; teaching efforts also contribute to the success of surveillance by increasing the interest of field partners for health issues; conversely, data arising from surveillance are useful for teaching purposes.
