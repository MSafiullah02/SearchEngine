            "text": "Porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV) is coronavirus and a causative agent for diarrhea in pigs, particularly in neonates. The propagation of the PEDV in cell culture was developed in 1988. PED disease vaccine is produced from Vero cells by using lively attenuated virus strain (Hofmann and Wyler, 1988). Industrially important viruses such as viral vaccines have been typically produced using anchorage-dependent cell lines in host cell culture systems (Lee et al., 1995). The accumulation of ammonium ion in culture media is inevitable because ammonium ion is excreted as a byproduct of glutamine metabolism which is essential to mammalian cells. The inhibitory effect of ammonium ion is common to most animal cells. Ammonium ion inhibits not only cell growth but also product formation such as interferon and vaccine. Therefore, high cell density and high vaccine productivity could be achieved if ammonium ions were removed from the media as soon as they formed. In this study, the PEDV vaccine was produced by immobilized Vero cell in spinner flask coupled with in situ removal of ammonium ion. A synthetic zeolite of membrane type was used as an ammonia adsorbents (Park et al., 1998).",

The optimum operation variables for PEDV vaccine production in a spinner culture were MOI of 0.01 cell\u22121, infection time of 72 h and harvest time of 48 h. The optimum time for zeolite addition to 100 ml spinner flask in terms of volumetric virus productivity and specific virus productivity were 72 h and 48 h, respectively. The volumetric virus productivity with zeolite treatment system was 2.6 times higher than that without zeolite treatment system in the media supplemented with 2.5 mM glutamine. The results showed that the integrated cell culture system coupled with immobilized cell culture and in situ removal of ammonium ion was very effective for the production of PEDV vaccine.",
