GATs allow for assigning different weights to nodes of the same neighborhood by applying multi-head self-attention layers, which enables a leap in model capacity. Additionally, the self-attention mechanism is applied to all graph edges, and thus, it does not depend on direct access to the graph structure or its nodes, which was a limitation of many prior dynamic graph representation learning techniques.",

TCNs has proven to be stable and powerful for modeling long-range dependencies as discussed in previous studies [2, 20]. In addition, this architecture can take a sequence of any length and map it to an output sequence of specific length which can be very effective in dynamic graphs due to varying size of adjacency and feature matrices.\n",
