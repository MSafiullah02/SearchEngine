Although the assessments are changing rapidly, COVID19 has now infected and taken the lives of thousands. Since the first cases appeared in late 2019, COVID19 has unleashed widespread shock on public and clinical health systems that struggle to respond to the surge, and on global economic productivity as workers are increasingly restricted from participation. A profound anxiety is spreading almost as quickly as the disease itself.",

An increasing number of high-income countries (HICs) have partially or completely closed borders and significantly restricted human movement with the ambition of viral containment. Meanwhile, some low and middle income (LMICs) countries with fragile infrastructure fear being unable to meet the health needs during an pandemic [2, 3] . Given these realities, the WHO has strongly advocated that the best approach to \"flatten the curve\" of newly identified cases is through robust and responsible public health measures at the individual, community, national and global levels. Dr. Michael Ryan, the WHO Executive Director of Health Emergencies, went so far as to suggest that \"We share failure in the same way that we share success\" [4] and that all citizens have a role to play in this global fight.",

Cai et al. have suggested that the virus might also be spread indirectly through \"virus contamination of common objects, virus aerosolization in a confined space, or spread from asymptomatic infected persons\" [5] . Either way, the segment of the population who seems to be most affected includes persons older than 50 years, and those with pre-existing chronic diseases [6] . The usual clinical manifestation after an incubation period of 4 days includes fever, dry and persistent cough, myalgia, and shortness of breath. Rare but life-threatening cases result in pneumonia and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), up to 80% of infected people will experience mild to moderate illness requiring few interventions, but the remaining will be seriously affected and will require intensive medical care. Although difficulty to accurately estimate, the WHO reports a case fatality rate of 3.4% [7] . This estimate nevertheless camouflages the reality that fatality rates differ by age, and for those over 80 year the rate is closer to 15%.",

They warned that \"the long term effects of infectious disease should not be ignored\". Likewise, Lam et al. [10] , Lam et al. [11] and Fallah et al.

It is prudent to not only react to current challenges, but also to anticipate future ones.
