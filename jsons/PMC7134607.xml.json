The enzyme prepared and assayed under our conditions shows 9-fold larger k\ncat and 68-fold smaller K\nm values than the previously reported values of 12.2 min\u22121 and 1.15 mM, respectively [15]. By measuring the activity versus enzyme concentration as shown in Fig. 3A\n, the apparent K\nd value for the dimer\u2013monomer equilibrium of our enzyme was measured to be 15 \u00b1 4 nM. This is based on the same assumption that the dimer is active and monomer contains no enzyme activity as proposed previously [15]. At protein concentration 50\u20133000 nM (significantly larger than the K\nd value), the fitting curve is almost linear (Fig. 3B). Thus, the K\nd (15 nM) is 6.7 \u00d7 103 times smaller than that (100 \u03bcM) previously estimated from analytical gel filtration experiments [15].

As shown in Fig. 4\n, at the 0.2 mg/mL protein concentration, our SARS main protease shows a major peak corresponding to the dimer form. Under the same concentration of SARS protease, previous report showed that the enzyme was a monomer exclusively. At 4 mg/mL of our SARS protease, dimer was also found (Fig. 4) but previous enzyme displayed a mixture of monomer and dimer in this case. However, formation of a small shoulder (<5% of the total absorbance) at the position of monomer may be due to the partial dilution of the protein during the elution in the column or other impurity. Compared to previous protease, the SARS protease prepared by us shows greater tendency to form dimer, consistent with the much smaller K\nd value.",

Screening from a panel of compounds, we found that 1-hydroxypyridine-2-thione zinc exhibited 0.8 \u03bcM IC50 toward SARS protease by using this assay method. The zinc ion itself at this concentration does not inhibit the protease, indicating the specificity of the compound against the SARS protease. This assay was completed in a short period of time (10 min) using a 96-well fluorescence plate reader.",

The enzyme activity is dependent upon the concentration of reducing agents used. The inclusion of 1 mM DTT in addition to 7.5 mM \u03b2-ME (or 2 mM DTT or 17.5 mM \u03b2-ME) is sufficient for optimal enzyme activity. Addition of excess DTT (10 mM) did not further increase the protease activity in our assay (data not shown). Since the enzyme is a chymotrypsin-like protease but uses Cys as the nucleophile to attack its substrate, the inclusion of the extra reducing agents may help to maintain the free thiol form of the active site Cys residue. However, it may also protect the correct protein conformation by preventing the formation of the incorrect disulfide bond in the enzyme. Indeed, the main protease contains 12 Cys residues, totally reduced without forming any disulfide linkage as revealed by its crystal structure [10]. The enzyme was prepared with 1 mM DTT in that structural study. This indicates that the reducing power higher than that of 1 mM DTT may be sufficient to yield fully active enzyme.",

The substrate we used contains Dabcyl and Edans FRET pair and the 12 amino acids of the protease\u2019s preferred cleavage site plus two amino acids for linking with the fluorophores, which may increase the affinity (smaller K\nm value) of the substrate to the enzyme. The previously used peptide substrate only contains 11 amino acids (six in P and five in P\u2032 positions). The hexa-His tag attached to C-terminus of the enzyme may also interfere with the enzyme activity (Chang et al., unpublished observation). The inclusion of anti-chaotropic agents (10% glycerol and 0.5 M Na2SO4) as used previously to promote dimer formation in human cytomegalovirus virus [20] in our buffer did not further increase the SARS protease activity since the protease already existed as a dimer under assay condition. The analytical ultracentrifugation measurements of the K\nd of the protease in solution also support our finding (Chang et al., personal communication).",

The protease prepared and assayed by us shows only 4-fold larger k\ncat/K\nm value for the active dimer but remarkably smaller K\nd of the dimer compared to the previously prepared enzyme [15]. From the 3-D structure of SARS protease, the N-terminus of one subunit makes close contact with the active site of the other subunit. The importance of the N-finger and dimerization is supported by the fact that a deletion mutant of the related TGEV main protease that lacks residues 1\u20135 is almost completely inactive [21]. However, the importance of the C-terminus in dimerization for 3CL protease has not been reported until now. In our solved X-ray structure of SARS protease (Wang et al., unpublished results), the C-terminus is indeed very close to the N-terminus. The distance between Phe3C\u03b1 and Ser301C\u03b1 is 11.5 \u00c5 (we cannot detect the electron density of first 2 amino acids in N-terminus and the last 5 amino acids in C-terminus). His-tag in the C-terminus may interfere with the dimer formation. Using our assay method with active enzyme and fluorogenic substrate, we have shown a sub-micromolar inhibitor as an example and other inhibitors will be reported elsewhere in detail. This sensitive method can be used in finding tight-binding inhibitors of nanomolar and smaller IC50 for SARS protease as leads for anti-SARS drug discovery.",
