Those patients suspected of COVID-19 infection go to the fever clinic and are accompanied by a nurse to the radiology department for a chest CT examination. Those patients not suspected of COVID-19 infection are triaged to other departments. In terms of classification, epidemiological factors and fever are the most important criteria. Patients with fever only account for 43.8% of the confirmed cases in the early stage, and about 1.2%\u20136% of the asymptomatic patients were found to be able to spread the disease (6,7). This inconsistency creates a serious safety risk.
