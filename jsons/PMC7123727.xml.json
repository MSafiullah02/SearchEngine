In 2015, DARPA funded Inovio Pharmaceuticals, Inc. with $45 million to develop multiple treatment and prevention approaches against Ebola (a DNA-based vaccine against Ebola, a therapeutic DNA-based monoclonal antibody product and a conventional monoclonal antibody to treat Ebola). More recently, the Biological Technologies Office (BTO) of DARPA sponsored the \u2018Pandemic Prevention Platform\u2019 (P3)15 program whose goal is to achieve an integrated capability that can deliver pandemic prevention countermeasures to patients within 60 days of an outbreak, changing outbreak response by enabling rapid discovery, characterization, production, and testing of efficacious medical countermeasures (i.e. generation of virus stock, including viral unknowns; rapid evolution of antibody candidates; gene-encoded antibody delivery methods).",
