Housing advocates say they fear an outbreak could occur in large homeless encampments, where thousands of people live on the streets and lack the ability to self-quarantine, receive medical attention or access cleaning facilities (The Washington Post, 2020). The idea of police arresting homeless people, many with complex health and addiction issues, without proper testing, and placing them in detention centers, just does not sit right (BBC, 2020) . In terms of isolation, it is too unclear what that looks like if you normally sleep on the streets. In this tough moment, when people should be turned away, not only it feels inhumane, but it is also a big public health risk, because where are they going to go? (Sky News, 2020) .",

Whether these approaches will be effective in the long-term remains unclear. For those living in encampments scattered throughout cities or bedding down in crowded shelters, containment or mitigation might prove elusive (Los Angeles Time, 2020). People experiencing homelessness not only have a set of challenges that make it really hard to do what has been asked -stay home when you are sick, wash your hands frequently, talk to your medical provider if you are feeling ill -, but also their health condition is worse than of many other people. Although the coronavirus is affecting people around the world, it is imperative that we have a lens focused on the potential to endanger those living on streets (USA Today, 2020) . But what happens when you do not have a home? How do you practice social distancing when, at best, the only barrier between you and your neighbor is a nylon tent wall? That is the question facing the homeless individuals, and one that is vexing lawmakers and public health workers as they try to prevent the spread of COVID-19 among a particularly vulnerable segment of the population (Fox News, 2020) .",

These people face lack of sleep, malnutrition and \"extreme stress levels just to meet their daily needs\", all of which weakens the immune system. Along with mental illness or substance abuse disorders, they are \"incredibly vulnerable to this virus. And the more obvious: They may have trouble accessing hand sanitizers and hand-washing facilities\" (ABC News, 2020). Public health agencies at all levels of government have a role to play in mitigating the coronavirus effects. If public health agencies from local governments to the Centers of Disease Control (CDC) do not have the capacity because of budget cuts or a lack of commitment, local jurisdictions will not have the tools necessary to reach out to those at risk that will be necessary to contain the virus and mitigate its effects on our most vulnerable groups (The Conversation, 2020).",

A fifth of them are in Seattle and King County. This is worrying and alarming for decision-making in the spaces of social psychiatry. As a whole, the homeless are disproportionately young. In the USA, in general, 22% are aged 60 or older, but among those who stayed in a shelter at some point during 2017, only 5.4% were 62 or older. In San Francisco, 10% of the homeless are aged 61 or older. In New York, 7% of sheltered single adults are over 65 years old. Los Angeles county reports that 6.5% of its street population is aged 62 or older. The relative youth of the homeless is likely a macabre testament to their low life expectancy and poor health (City Journal, 2020).",

However, on a wider scale, this situation seems to shine a light on the ways in which, as a society, we forget about people among us who have nothing. Perhaps it is time to reconsider the ethical basis of our communities and our social system. What moral nation can allow its citizens to live without shelter, safety or dignity? (The Guardian, 2020). Health organizations are well aware of the risks involved in mental health. A large population of homeless people experience their pain and psychological distress intermittently. For low-income patients, the various borderline situations related to health/illness involve growing expectations regarding the basic needs. This is a serious concern when linked to the pandemic.",
