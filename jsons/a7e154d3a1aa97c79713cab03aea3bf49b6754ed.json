Zoonotic pathogens are currently considered to be the major sources of emerging and re-emerging infections in humans and RNA viruses account for the overwhelming majority of emerging pathogens [2] . At the time of writing, the most important non-mammalian vertebrates associated with emerging infections in humans are the birds. The avian species have an enormous population: the estimated world poultry population in agriculture (chickens, ducks, geese and turkeys) in 2005 was over 18 billion [3] . Poultry birds often have large populations reared in relatively restricted environments. Wild birds have a tendency to gather in flocks and many species fly or migrate over long distances. All these are important attributes which allow them to harbour and disseminate infectious agents over vast geographical areas. Their impacts on public health and economy are best exemplified by the West Nile virus encephalitis in North America and the global influenza A H5N1 outbreaks. The latter carries major economic losses in agriculture and the potential to cause a pandemic associated with significant morbidity and mortality in humans.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 104, "end": 107, "text": "[1]", "ref_id": "BIBREF0"}, {"start": 303, "end": 306, "text": "[2]", "ref_id": "BIBREF1"}, {"start": 605, "end": 608, "text": "[3]", "ref_id": "BIBREF2"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "INTRODUCTION"}, {"text": "Infectious agents exist in commensal, mutual or parasitic relationships with their harbouring animal hosts. The relationship is often restricted to a limited number of host species owing to genetic adaptations that developed during co-evolution. This gives rise to the concept of species barrier in infectious diseases. However, spillage of infectious agents between different animal species does occur sporadically. This may result from accidental or deliberate intrusion by one animal species into the ecological niche of another, resulting in the direct exposure to the infectious agents from the original harbouring species or acquisition from the environment. Severe diseases often occur in the new animal hosts in the absence of genetic adaptations of the infectious agent to these new hosts. These new animals may become 'dead end' hosts when the infectious agent fails to cause further transmission under natural conditions (e.g. Japanese encephalitis in humans), or they may contribute to further transmissions resulting in an epidemic (e.g. SARS).

Such exposures have resulted in transmission of pathogens like Ebola virus, simian foamy viruses, simian immunodeficiency virus, and human immunodeficiency viruses to humans [4] [5] [6] .

The nature of their diet is equally diverse, varying from plants, insects, animals and, unique among mammals, blood. The diversity of bat species and some of their unique biological and ecological features allow them to become the hosts for a large number of medically important infectious agents. Most bats are nocturnal animals and seek shelter in roosts during the day. A few species are diurnal. The roosting environment ranges from natural to man-made structures and they can be temporary or permanent (Figure 1 ). Natural roosts can be found in caves, rock crevices, nests of birds or ants and termites, cavities in trees, or exposed on tree branches and trunks [9] . Man-made habitats include mines, tombs, buildings, bridges and so on. The occupation of man-made habitats could bring the bats into closer association with humans and their companion animals or livestock. The significance of this is seen in the transmission of some pathogens, such as bat rabies viruses, from peridomestic bats to humans and livestocks. The number of bats in each colony varies greatly from less than 10 to over 200 000 individuals [9] .

Some species may utilise night roosts near feeding sites and distant from their day roosts. Despite their small sizes, bats have a relatively long life span and develop slowly. Many species live for over 10-20 years with some species living for over 30 years in the wild [10, 11] . Host longevity facilitates the persistence of infectious agents in When faced with winter and shortage of food supply, bats may either hibernate or migrate. The megachiropterans do not hiberbnate. Hibernation in microchiropterans involves substantial physiological changes during torpor, including an accumulation of brown adipose tissue. Hibernating bats can remain torpid continuously for up to 75 days, though many will have periodic arousal alternating with torpor periods lasting from 2 to 15 days [12] . Seasonal migration has been observed for bats living in both temperate and tropical environments, which demonstrate substantial seasonal changes in food supply and/or temperature.

Transmission of viruses carried by bats to humans can occur in a variety of ways, with direct contact through bites and scratches the most obvious example. Bats do not normally prey on humans. However, Desmodus rotundus has been known to feed on humans in Latin America when alternative animal hosts are scarce [14, 15] .

Arthropod vectors could serve as another mode of transmission of pathogens between bats and humans. Important categories of arthropods in this regard include mosquitoes, sand flies, and ectoparasites infesting bats such as bat ticks, bugs and bat flies. Insects, such as mosquitoes and sand flies may feed on both bats and humans as shown in entomological and virological studies [16, 17] . There is currently no evidence to implicate an active role of these vectors in disease transmission, presumably because of the lack of efficient vector-pathogen combinations or host specificity of the vectors. Vectorborne transmission is therefore a route that requires further study. The consumption of bat meat is practised in some parts of the world including China, Guam, and some parts of Asia where it is considered to have therapeutic effects against asthma ( Figure 1 ). Adequately cooked bat meat is unlikely to pose any risk for transmission of infections. However, capture and slaughtering of bats could expose the handler to the bats' blood and body fluids or bites and scratches. In situations where live bats are kept in captivity in game markets, they may come into close contact with other animals, which are susceptible to viruses carried by bats. This is one of the postulated mechanisms linking the finding of SARS-coronavirus (SARS-CoV) in bats and palm civets in southern China.

In an extreme example, another human host could be involved before such transmissions are clinically evident.

Another example is the Nipah outbreak in Malaysia in which the loss of the normal forest habitats of the bats forced them to reside in areas close to livestock and human inhabitation [19, 20] . The spread of the infectious disease within human communities was further augmented by trade in domestic animals, such as the transport of infected pigs in the spread of Nipah virus infection.

Unequivocal evidence for natural infection can be obtained with a positive viral culture obtained from the animals. Another acceptable detection method is the use of direct immunofluorescent staining of bat tissues, most commonly used in the detection of lyssaviruses in the brains of bats. Nucleic acid amplification may offer similar confidence if the tests are performed competently without contamination. Unfortunately, many viruses are not readily cultivable in vitro. Consequently, a number of field studies employed serological tests to look for evidence of infection. While serology can offer valuable information, cross-reactivity between different members of the same family of viruses may be observed for some test formats (e.g. haemagglutination inhibition, complement fixation). Risk of bat-to-human transmission of the respective pathogens: A, documented direct bat-to-human transmission or through secondary hosts or definite epidemiological linkage; B, potential risk of transmission directly from bats or through secondary hosts or vectors because presence of known human pathogens documented and microbes present in relatively high frequency in bats; C, low risk of transmission directly from bats or through vectors because of low prevalence of pathogens in bats, inefficient vectorial capacity of bats or arthropod vectors, or insufficient epidemiological data to support a link; D, little risk of transmission because viruses not known to infect humans. them are arthropod-borne and have reservoirs in vertebrates.

The first confirmed case of SARS was a chef working in a local restaurant and he had had contacts with wild game animals prior to the onset of disease [28] . The emergence of a novel viral infection, together with the occupational history of contact with wild animals among four index patients in the Guangdong outbreak, prompted the search for an animal reservoir of SARS-CoV. The live animal retail markets in the city of Shenzhen, Guangdong, was investigated and evidence of infection was found in the Himalayan palm civet (Paguma larvata) and to a lesser extent, Chinese ferret badgers (Melogale moschata) and raccoon dogs (Nyctereutes procyonoides) [29] . Further evidence for zoonotic transmission of SARS-CoV came from studies which showed that wild animal traders and slaughterers had a significantly higher seroprevalence (20 to 45%) against SARS-CoV than vegetable traders and control populations (0 to 5%) [30] . Review of seroprevalence studies showed that persons with an occupational history of contact with wild animals had a substantially higher prevalence of antibodies as compared to healthy blood donors, household contact or health care workers caring for SARS patients (12.99 to 16.69% vs. 0 to 2.92%, respectively) [31] . A recent study showed that contact with game animals could result in asymptomatic infection with the SARS-CoV but that the individual could still have detectable coronavirus antigenaemia and seroconversion [32] . Restrictions on the sale and consumption of game animals therefore became important control measures during the SARS epidemic in China. In contrast to other zoonotic pathogens that crossed the species barrier to humans, the SARS-CoV is notable in that it spreads readily from person-to-person and therefore outbreaks within health care facilities was a prominent feature during the SARS epidemic with a fifth of all global cases being health care workers [33] . It is also unique amongst coronaviruses in that a wide host range is observed, with the virus being able to infect (with or without the development of illness) humans, Chinese ferret badgers (Melogale moschata) and raccoon dogs (Nyctereutes procyonoides), cynomolgus macaques (Macaca fascicularis), African green monkeys (Cercopithecus atheiops, Chlorocebus sabeus), rhesus monkeys (Macaca mulata), ferrets (Mustela furo), domestic cats (Felis domesticus), mice, golden Syrian hamsters (Mesocricetus auratus), common marmosets (Callithrix jacchus), pigs, and chickens [34, 35, 36, 37, 38] .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 244, "end": 248, "text": "[28]", "ref_id": "BIBREF27"}, {"start": 747, "end": 751, "text": "[29]", "ref_id": "BIBREF28"}, {"start": 1010, "end": 1014, "text": "[30]", "ref_id": "BIBREF29"}, {"start": 1330, "end": 1334, "text": "[31]", "ref_id": "BIBREF30"}, {"start": 1543, "end": 1547, "text": "[32]", "ref_id": "BIBREF31"}, {"start": 2005, "end": 2009, "text": "[33]", "ref_id": "BIBREF32"}, {"start": 2580, "end": 2584, "text": "[34,", "ref_id": "BIBREF33"}, {"start": 2585, "end": 2588, "text": "35,", "ref_id": "BIBREF34"}, {"start": 2589, "end": 2592, "text": "36,", "ref_id": "BIBREF35"}, {"start": 2593, "end": 2596, "text": "37,", "ref_id": "BIBREF36"}, {"start": 2597, "end": 2600, "text": "38]", "ref_id": "BIBREF37"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Coronaviridae"}, {"text": "The sudden emergence of the SARS-CoV was initially linked to the palm civet and related animals which were found to carry the SARS-CoV asymptomatically. The palm civet was consumed as a game animal in southern China and sold in the wet markets. Subsequent studies however did not show a significant amount of SARS-CoV in wild or farmed palm civets. This suggested that the caged palm civets in the markets may not be a primary reservoir host of SARS-CoV in nature, but merely a secondary amplifying host that increases the viral burden and provides ample contact with humans, thereby facilitating animal to human transmission, a situation that is similar to the Henipavirus discussed below. The search for the primary reservoir host of SARS-CoV led to the finding of novel coronaviruses among bats in Hong Kong. One of these was detected in Chinese horseshoe bats (Rhinolophus sinicus (R. rouxii)) in Hong Kong which is currently named bat SARS-CoV (bat-SARS-CoV) [39] . The bat-SARS-CoV was initially found by RT-PCR in 39% of R. sinicus tested but seropositivity of bats ranged from 67 to 84% when the sera were tested by western blot and enzyme immunoassay respectively. It is postulated that the bats might serve as the natural reservoir of the SARS-CoV (or a related virus) and the palm civets acquired the virus from the bats before passing it on to humans.

The association of coronaviruses with bats is also confirmed in another study by Li et al. who documented the presence of SARS-like coronavirus infection of bats in Guangxi and Hubei, two provinces in southern and central China respectively [42] . Notably, with the exception of two positive samples which came from Rousettus leschenaulti (Family Pteropodidae), the majority of bats carrying SARS-like coronaviruses in China were Rhinolophus spp., members of which were also found to be infected with SARS coronavirus-like virus in Hong Kong.

If the bats are indeed the natural reservoir of the Ebola virus, two factors have been suggested to facilitate their transmission to primates [46] . The scarcity of food during the dry season is thought to affect the immune system of bats, thereby facilitating viral replication.

These findings have important implications in future studies of the ecology and epidemiology of Ebola virus. The natural reservoir hosts of Marburg virus have not been identified, though bats would now be an obvious and important group of animals to investigate. Direct transmission of either of the filoviruses from bats to humans has not been confirmed. However, it is interesting to note that in some of the previous outbreaks of filoviruses in Africa not involving contact with primates, bats were sighted in caves or buildings which the index cases had visited or worked in [45] . With the present knowledge in the epidemiology of the filoviruses, it appears that direct bat-to-human transmission of [47] . Recent surveillance studies in the USA also showed occasional infection of bats by the West Nile virus [48, 49, 50] . In a series of experiments by Sulkin et al., bats (Tadarida brasiliensis mexicana, Myotis lucifugus lucifugus, Eptescius fuscus fuscus) were shown to be susceptible to infection by Japanese encephalitis and St. Louis encephalitis viruses by either the subcutaneous and intracerebral route [51] . The susceptibility of bats to infection and the level of viral replication varied with different viral strains and the species of bats tested. Of particular interest is that bats developed relatively long periods of viraemia (upto 30 days) after infection and developed no clinicopathological sequelae following inoculation, even though there was significant viral multiplication in the brain fol-lowing intracerebral inoculation. Importantly, infections due to these neurotropic viruses produced significant viral loads not only in the blood but also in the interscapular brown fat, in contrast to brains and kidneys which were less frequently found positive for viruses. Sulkin et al. also demonstrated that infection at low temperatures (from 8 C to 24 C) was associated with prolonged viraemia of over 100 days and persistence of viruses in the brown fat [52] . Transplacental infection of Japanese encephalitis virus also occurred readily in Tadarida brasiliensis mexicana, again without any clinicopathological sequelae to the fetuses [53] . Similar experiments also showed that the big brown bat (Eptesicus fuscus) can maintain St. Louis encephalitis during hibernation [54] . Isolation of Japanese encephalitis virus in naturally infected bats in Japan and Taiwan, and serological evidence of St. Louis encephalitis infection in Ohio and Trinidad have been reported [16, 23, 54, 55] . These data suggested that bats could easily serve as a suitable host for the persistence of these viruses in nature, perhaps with special significance to overwintering of viruses.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 248, "end": 252, "text": "[46]", "ref_id": "BIBREF45"}, {"start": 397, "end": 401, "text": "[46]", "ref_id": "BIBREF45"}, {"start": 1286, "end": 1290, "text": "[45]", "ref_id": "BIBREF44"}, {"start": 1412, "end": 1416, "text": "[47]", "ref_id": "BIBREF46"}, {"start": 1522, "end": 1526, "text": "[48,", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1527, "end": 1530, "text": "49,", "ref_id": "BIBREF49"}, {"start": 1531, "end": 1534, "text": "50]", "ref_id": "BIBREF51"}, {"start": 1826, "end": 1830, "text": "[51]", "ref_id": "BIBREF52"}, {"start": 2692, "end": 2696, "text": "[52]", "ref_id": "BIBREF53"}, {"start": 2874, "end": 2878, "text": "[53]", "ref_id": "BIBREF54"}, {"start": 3010, "end": 3014, "text": "[54]", "ref_id": "BIBREF55"}, {"start": 3207, "end": 3211, "text": "[16,", "ref_id": "BIBREF14"}, {"start": 3212, "end": 3215, "text": "23,", "ref_id": "BIBREF22"}, {"start": 3216, "end": 3219, "text": "54,", "ref_id": "BIBREF55"}, {"start": 3220, "end": 3223, "text": "55]", "ref_id": "BIBREF56"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "RT-PCR) in three species of bats captured in"}, {"text": "Similarly, natural infection of bats by dengue virus was suggested by a serological study in Costa Rica and Ecuador, and more convincingly by positive RT-PCR of the brains of Rousettus leschenaulti bats in southern China [56, 57] .

Following the initial outbreaks of Hendra virus infection, a serological survey in Australia involving 5264 sera from 46 terrestrial animal species failed to show any evidence of infection by this new virus.

The outbreak in humans was preceded by sudden and massive deaths of the pigs due to acute respiratory distress syndrome and encephalitis, and close contacts with pigs was confirmed to be the major risk factor for acquisition of the infection in a case-control study [80] . The presence of the virus in the respiratory secretions and urine of infected pigs suggested that contact with these secretions is the likely route of transmission. About 8% of the patients did not have a contact history with sick pigs; dogs were suspected to be another possible vector for transmission as they can also be infected by Nipah virus. Culling of over 1 million pigs was needed to terminate the outbreak. Singapore was concurrently hit by an outbreak of Nipah encephalitis in March 1999 which affected 11 abbatoir workers who handled pigs imported from Malaysia [81] . Contact with live pigs was again confirmed to be a major risk factor for infection [82] . No interpersonal or nosocomial transmission of Nipah virus infection was noted in these two outbreaks [83] . A search for the reservoir hosts of Nipah virus found that in addition to pigs, wild boars (Sus scrofa), domestic dogs (Canis lupus) and rodents (Rattus rattus) could be secondarily infected.

Subsequently, Nipah virus was cultured from the urine of the flying fox P. hypomelanus [85] . It was postulated that the combination of anthropogenic deforestation and drought caused by the El Ni\u00f1 o Southern Oscillation drove the frugivorous flying foxes from their natural habitats into orchard plantations.

Phylogroup I consists of genotypes 1, 4, 5, 6 and 7 while phylogroup II consists of genotypes 2 and 3. Phylogenetic analyses of the four Eurasian lyssaviruses using the glycoprotein, nucleocapsid and phosphoprotein gene sequences has also been published [113] . Aravan, Irkut, Khujand and West Caucasian bat viruses are considered to be separate genotypes according to nucleoprotein gene viruses, and these six viruses are believed to represent a phylogroup of Old World bat lyssaviruses. The West Caucasian bat virus is the most divergent of all known lyssaviruses. All the above lyssaviruses have been isolated from bats except Mokola virus which is mainly isolated from cats and occasionally from rodents and shrews. For the bat-associated lyssaviruses, only rabies virus is also associated with other terrestrial animals (especially carnivores); all the others have bats as the sole natural reservoir hosts. Rabies virus has a worldwide distribution while the other lyssaviruses are relatively restricted geographically. A large number of animals are susceptible to infection by the classical rabies virus. However, only mammals of the orders Chiroptera and Carnivora transmit the virus efficiently in nature. In countries which are free from canine rabies, bats are the most important source for human rabies. The evolution of rabies virus has been studied in detail. Phylogenetic studies showed that the different genotypes of lyssaviruses are clearly distinct from each other and that, within genotype 1, distinct lineages with respect to the reservoir host range can be recognised [114] . The chiropteran rabies viruses are likely to be older than the carnivoran viruses, and the current rabies viruses amongst carnivores probably arose as a result of two cross-species spillover events from bats to carnivores. One of the events resulted in the North American raccoon and skunk rabies virus lineage while the other resulted in the carnivore rabies lineage in the rest of the world. Cross-species transmission of rabies virus still occurs today but all these incidents are the result of bat-to-terrestrial animals spillover not the reverse [115] . Phylogenetic division of bat rabies viruses was clearly shown to be associated with clustering of specific bat species in two studies, suggesting that some rabies viruses co-segregate with their bat hosts [116, 117] .

In Latin America, outbreaks of human rabies from vampire bats almost always followed the destruction of the bats' habitats, forcing the animals to feed on humans and livestock. In situations where exposure to bats is unavoidable, measures to reduce contact between bats and humans may be considered, such as bat-proofing of houses in the endemic areas and the use of personal protective equipment for workers and scientists in frequent contact with bats. In Latin America, application of anticoagulants to bats and cattle have been utilised to control the vampire bat population. This approach, however, has not achieved much success and may have adverse effects on the ecology of bats or other fauna and flora. With the excellent results from the use of oral rabies vaccine to control rabies in wildlife in Europe and North America, oral vaccines against bat rabies were being tested in vampire bats with satisfactory experimental results [156, 157] . Pre-and post-exposure prophylaxis using rabies vaccines appears to be effective against genotypes of lyssavirus that are known to cause human infections despite the antigenic differences from classical rabies virus. Pre-exposure vaccination is especially important for persons with constant exposure to bats such as bat biologists. The value of vaccines against other bat-associated viruses remains unknown mainly because of the lack of effective vaccines (e.g. against Henipavirus) or the uncertain role of bats in the transmission of infections (e.g. Japanese encephalitis virus). As depicted in the Supplementary Table, the known and potential viral pathogens are distributed in numerous families of bats. However, one thing that stands out from the table is that most of the important pathogens are often associated with four families: Pteropodidae, Molossidae, Phyllostomidae and Vespertilionidae. This could be due to a greater biodiversity of these species, better known biological features, or indeed, a co-evolution of the main pathogens with specific bat species. The understanding of the association between viruses and bat families could also be useful to predict the likelihood of transmission or dissemination to humans. For example, many of the flying foxes (Pteropodidae) are relatively large animals and, being strong flyers, they could reach relatively long distances from their roosting sites.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 1130, "end": 1135, "text": "[156,", "ref_id": "BIBREF164"}, {"start": 1136, "end": 1140, "text": "157]", "ref_id": "BIBREF165"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "IMPLICATIONS"}, {"text": "Being frugivorous bats, Pteropus spp. often encroach onto fruit plantations and hence may bring them into closer contacts with humans.

Some of these causative agents, such as the henipavirus and SARS coronavirus, have been found to have a reservoir in bats. Bats have also been proven to be a natural host for enigmatic viruses such as the Ebola virus and their significance in the natural ecology of filoviruses remains to be uncovered.

Examples include coronaviruses, Henipavirus and lyssaviruses. In lyssaviruses, for example surveys of South and Southeast Asian bats showed that Australian bat lyssavirus and the Eurasian lyssaviruses may indeed have a broader distribution than previously known. Many of the new viruses were discovered in bats following recent human or animal outbreaks of infectious diseases and enhanced surveillance in wild animals. A variety of coronaviruses were discovered in southern China after the SARS epidemic in diverse bat species. The outbreak of Nipah encephalitis in Malaysia and the association of the virus with flying foxes prompted enhanced surveillance of bats. This led to the discovery of the new Tioman and Pulau viruses. The finding of these new viruses is the result of a systematic and targeted surveillance of bats, which underscores the importance of such an approach in the future study of zoonotic agents. It is therefore hardly surprising to predict that more viruses will be discovered in bats in the future. However, one should not forget that the mere isolation of a virus from bats does not necessarily implicate an active role of bats in the natural ecology of the microbe. Whether bats are incidental and dead-end hosts or actively support the maintenance of the viruses need to be investigated in more vigorous studies. Anthropogenic and natural changes in the environment due to deforestation, alteration of habitats of bats, alterations in animal diversity, and climatic events may shift the ecology of bats and expose humans to new pathogens. A long-term systematic surveillance of bats is essential to unravel the complex ecology between bats, humans, other animals, arthropod vectors and the environment.

Failures occur only in situations of delayed vaccination and multiple severe animal bites to the head. There are no controlled clinical trials on the efficacy of rabies vaccines or immunoglobulins towards other lyssaviruses. However, vaccines and immunoglobulin have been given to persons exposed to European and Australian bat lyssaviruses without failure so far. Animal studies of rabies vaccines against European bat lyssaviruses have yielded variable results depending on the vaccine strains used and the host species. In a recent study in mice, human diploid cell vaccine conferred cross-protection against both European and Australian bat lyssaviruses, thus providing some experimental evidence for the protective efficacy against these phylogroup I lyssaviruses [146]. Vaccine efficacy against Lagos bat virus is likely to be low. The efficacy of human rabies vaccines and immunoglobulin against the Eurasian genotypes appears to be unsatisfactory, and the degree of protection is related to the phylogenetic distance from the rabies virus [147]. The two genera of togaviruses contain several important human pathogens. Examples of Alphavirus include Barmah Forest virus, Chikungunya virus, eastern equine encephalitis virus, O'nyongnyong virus, Ross River virus, Semliki Forest virus, Sindbis virus, Venezuelan equine encephalitis virus, and western equine encephalitis virus. Eastern, western, and Venezuelan equine encephalitis viruses are primarily associated with encephalitis, while chikungunya, O'nyong-nyong, Ross River, sinbis, and Barmah Forest viruses commonly present as fever, rash and arthritis. Rubella virus is the only example of Rubivirus for which human is the only natural host. All alphaviruses are transmitted by arthropods, especially mosquitoes. Evidence of infection by chikungunya, eastern and Venezuelan equine encephalitis viruses have been found in bats. Chikungunya virus causes recurrent and explosive outbreaks in many tropical countries. The most recent outbreak occurred in the southwest Indian Ocean involving La R\u00e9union, Mauritius, Seychelles, Mayotte, Maldives and India.
