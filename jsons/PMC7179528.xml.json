            "text": "Turkey Coronavirus (TCoV) causes an acute and highly contagious enteric disease. Turkey coronaviral enteritis is the most costly disease of turkey encountered in Minnesota between 1951 and 1971 and is characterized by acute enteritis, diarrhea, decreased body weight gain, inappetence, ruffled feathers, and uneven flock growth. The disease accounted for 23% of all turkey mortality and over a half million dollars in lost income in Minnesota in 1966 [1]. Outbreaks of turkey poult enteritis associated with TCoV have contributed to significant economic losses encountered by a large number of turkey producers in Indiana, North Carolina, and other states for the last several years. The disease is not easily eliminated and is frequently encountered in areas with high concentrations of turkeys on a year-round basis [1]. There are currently no effective vaccines or medications to prevent the disease and treatments of the disease are often unsuccessful. In order to develop strategies for the diagnosis, control, and prevention of turkey coronaviral infection, in-depth understanding of the molecular biology of TCoV is essential.",

            "text": "Coronaviruses are pleiomorphic, enveloped spherical particles surrounded by a fringe of 20-nm-long club-shaped spikes. The diameter of coronaviral particle varies from 50 to 150 nm. The coronavirus genome is a positive and single-stranded capped RNA with a polyadenylated 3\u2032-end. The 5\u2032 two thirds of the genome, roughly 20 kb, consist of two overlapping open reading frames (ORFs) that encode nonstructural proteins including the viral RNA-dependent RNA polymerase and proteases. Another one third nucleotide sequences from 3\u2032-end contain ORFs encoding the major structural proteins, spike (S), membrane (M), and nucleocapsid (N) proteins, in the order of 5\u2032 to 3\u2032 along the genome, respectively. Spike protein contains neutralizing and/or group-specific epitopes and is highly variable among different coronaviruses. In contrast, M and N proteins are more conserved among coronaviruses between different antigenic groups. There are several ORFs encoding other structural or nonstructural proteins, which varied in number, size, and order of genes among different coronaviruses. Like many other RNA viruses, the genome of coronavirus is very dynamic due to the lack of exonuclease editing the function of the viral RNA-dependent RNA polymerase and a discontinuous transcription mechanism for coronavirus replication. Mutation rates during viral replication have been estimated in the range of 10\u22123 to 10\u22125 substitutions per nucleotide. Given the size of coronavirus genome at approximately 30,000 nucleotides, an average of 3 mutations per template copied is anticipated.",

            "text": "There are more than 20 different serotypes of infectious bronchitis coronavirus (IBV) recognized worldwide. Most of these serotypes do not cross-protect and cause outbreaks of infectious bronchitis in chicken flocks vaccinated with attenuated virus of different serotype. The diversity of IBV is generated by insertions, deletions, point mutations, and RNA recombinations. A new serotype of IBV is still emerging [2]. A mutation rate of l.5% nucleotide changes and the evolutionary rate of 2.5% amino acid changes per year in a hypervariable region of the S protein gene were estimated for the arising of a new serotype GA98 from serotype DE072 [2]. In a previous study, we demonstrated that the genomic structure of 3\u2032-end structural protein-encoding region of an Indiana isolate of TCoV is very similar to that of IBV [3]. It is speculated that a similar phenomenon of genetic diversity in IBV genome may exist among TCoV isolates. In addition, the evolutionary interactions between these two avian viruses with distinct species and tissue tropism are not clear and merit further investigation. Analysis of genomic structure of different TCoV isolates from different geographic areas is necessary to delineate the relationships between TCoV and IBV. The objective of the present study is to examine the sequences of the 3\u2032-end structural protein-encoding region of TCoV isolates associated with recent outbreaks of acute enteritis of turkeys in Indiana, North Carolina, and Minnesota as well as an isolate recovered from affected turkeys in Minnesota in the early 1970s. The TCoV sequences were compared with the corresponding published sequences of IBV strains Beaudette [4], KB8523 [5], CU-T2 [6], DE072 [7, 8], and D1466 [7, 8].",

It was speculated that the discrepant results regarding the relationship between TCoV and other coronaviruses might be caused by different isolates of TCoV from various geographical areas at different times. In order to test this possibility, the antigenicity of 18 isolates of TCoV from various geographical areas at different times including the prototype isolate TCoV-ATCC was examined in one of our previous studies [13]. It was found that all the different isolates of TCoV had the same pattern of antigenic reactivity with the same panel of antibodies and all of them cross-reacted with polyclonal antibody to IBV or a monoclonal antibody to M protein of IBV. In contrast, none of the examined TCoV isolates reacted with a monoclonal antibody to S protein of IBV. In line with these previous results of antigenic study, the sequence analysis in the present study demonstrated that isolates of TCoV from various geographical areas at different times including the prototype isolate TCoV-ATCC had a high similarity in the 3\u2032-end structural protein-encoding region. In addition, the M protein region of TCoV isolates shared a high similarity (86.2-96.0%) with that of IBV strains, while the S protein region of TCoV isolates had a relatively low similarity (38.3-41.5%) with that of IBV strains.",

The differences were mainly contributed by the S protein gene. The size of TCoV S gene (3,612-3,624 nucleotides) was larger than that of IBV S gene (3,456-3,507 nucleotides). The sequence similarity of the S gene nucleotide sequences between TCoV and IBV was lower (49.1-52.4%) than that among TCoV isolates (93.0-99.7%) or that among IBV strains (67.4-94.4%). In other genes, the sequence differences between TCoV and IBV were comparable with those among TCoV isolates or among IBV strains. The phylogenetic tree based on the S protein region was the same as that based on the entire 3\u2032-end structural protein-encoding region with TCoV isolates and IBV strains grouped in two separate clusters. These results suggested that TCoV probably shared the same origin with that of IBV, evolved independently in a separate environment a long time ago, and acquired sequences of S gene for turkey intestine tropism. Accumulation of S gene sequence of more TCoV isolates will further clarify the relationship between TCoV and IBV and may lead to the understanding of origin and evolution of TCoV.",

            "text": "The replication of coronavirus is characterized by the synthesis of a 3\u2032-coterminal nested set of polycistronic subgenomic mRNAs with a discontinuous transcription mechanism. Only the first ORF from 5\u2032-end of each polycistronic subgenomic mRNA is translated. There is a common 5\u2032-terminal leader sequence derived from the 5\u2032-end of the coronavirus genome on the body sequence of each subgenomic mRNA. The acquisition of the leader sequence to each subgenomic mRNAs involves the conserved TRS sequence present along the genomic RNA and proximal to the initiation codon of the first ORF for each particular subgenomic mRNA. The consensus sequences of the TRS sites are CT(T/G)AACAA for IBV, ATC(T/C)AAAC for BCoV, AACTAAAC for TGEV, AATC(T/C)A(A/T)AC for MHV, and AACTAAAC for FIPV [14, 15]. The distance between the TRS and the first ORF is different for each subgenomic mRNA of different coronaviruses. Both the nucleotide sequence of TRS and the distance between the TRS 3\u2032-end and the initiation codon of first ORF are suggested to play an important role in the transcription of mRNAs. As shown in the present study, the TRS sequences and the distance between the TRS 3\u2032-end and the initiation codon of the first ORF of TCoV isolates were highly conserved with those of the corresponding genes of IBV strains. The TRS of gene 5 for the IBV strain Beaudette has 2 consensus sequences, CTTAACAA, in a tandem repeat (CTTAACAAAAACTTAACAA). According to analysis with reported genes, it was demonstrated that only one of this TRS is required for the expression of gene 5 and either sequence can function as an acceptor site for acquisition of the leader sequence [15]. In contrast to this result, no similar structure of 2 TRS sequences in a tandem repeat for gene 5 was found in any other IBV strains or TCoV isolates. However, it is interesting to note that there are deletions of 8 nucleotides in the corresponding region of TCoV isolate 1440. These deletions resulted in a TRS sequence of CTTACAACAA for gene 5 of TCoV isolate 1440.",

In general, ORFs of gene 5 are more conserved than those of gene 3 among TCoV isolates and IBV strains. The ORF 3a was not found in the genome of TCoV isolate 1440 in two different trials of cloning and sequencing analysis in the present study.

These recombination events play an important role in the emergence of new IBV variants responsible for continuous outbreaks in the chicken flocks vaccinated with live attenuated viruses due to a failure of cross-protection. For example, the DE072 strain is a recombinant with a D1466-like sequence in the S gene, while the CU-T2 strain is a recombinant between Arkansas and Massachusetts strains [7, 8]. It is possible that the similar recombination events of IBV in chicken may contribute to the origin and evolution of TCoV in turkey. Except for the S protein gene, the sequences of other individual genes among TCoV isolates and IBV strain had different degrees of similarity. The phylogenetic tree based on these individual genes had a very different topology.
