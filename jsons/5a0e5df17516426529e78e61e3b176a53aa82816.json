The social media platform had 497 million monthly active users as of September 2019. 2 The data used herein were collected by Weiboscope, a research project led by coauthor KWF. Since 2010, the research team has been collecting the social media data through Sina Weibo's Open Application Programming Interface by sampling a list of high-profile users and random users, whose posts are programmatically retrieved every 15-20 minutes by a cluster of computer servers. 3 If a once-published post is found to be absent in the next retrieval of the user's timeline, an additional request is made to confirm whether the post is truly censored, that is, return of an error message of \"permission denied\" indicating a censored message. 3 The current study analyzed the posts from 52 268 randomly sampled accounts in the Weiboscope database, whose 10-digit unique user identity codes were randomly selected in 2015 and their published posts have been longitudinally recorded. This cohort constitutes a representative sample of the whole user population of Weibo. 4 We compiled a priori a list of key words in simplified Chinese characters that were pertinent to the COVID-19 outbreak in China.
