As our understanding of the proteome becomes more complex, demand is rising for rapidly generated antibodies of higher specifi city than ever before. It is therefore surprising that few investigators have moved beyond the classical methods of antibody production in their search for new reagents. Despite their long-standing effi cacy, recombinant antibody generation technologies such as phage display are still largely the tools of biotechnology companies or research groups with a direct interest in protein engineering. In this chapter, we discuss the inherent limitations of classical polyclonal and monoclonal antibody generation and highlight an attractive alternative: generating high-specifi city, high-affi nity recombinant antibodies from alternative immune sources such as chickens, via phage display.",

Individual biomedical researchers will often need to monitor, quantify, and purify proteins of interest via affi nity chromatography , but there may not be any commercially available antibody reagents to allow them to do so [ 1 ] . Indeed, even in situations where there are commercially available antibodies, these reagents are often expensive, poorly characterized, and/or simply not appropriate for demanding applications. Compounding this problem, the technical diffi culty of monoclonal antibody generation by the untrained researcher and the high cost (~$15,000) of a commercial monoclonal antibody generation program leads many researchers to the default solution of producing polyclonal hyperimmune sera in hosts such as rabbits. The net result of this is that researchers often settle for reagents that lack the necessary specifi city to perform the applications for which they were intended.",

After transformation into E. coli , the viral replication system packaged the genome (and therefore the cloned gene) into a highly stable complex carrying the gene product on the tip of the phage particle, as a fusion protein with p3 . By subsequently selecting expressed virions on an immobilized antibody with specifi city for a known protein that had been cloned in the phage genome, they were able to show 1000-fold enrichment of the gene product. This set of experiments showed that \"genotypeto-phenotype linkage\" could be achieved and thereby defi ned the basis of all display technologies developed since.",

Phage production is thereby induced, genotype-to-phenotype linkage is created, and the expressed phage particles are interrogated for the presence of useful protein sequences via target binding. This selective step may be performed by simply immobilizing the target protein on, for example, a protein-binding plastic surface such as an ELISA plate, adding phage and allowing binding to occur via the antibody-p3 fusion proteins. Nonbinding phages are removed by washing the immobilized surface, and the remaining bound phages are eluted. The eluted phages are then reinfected back into a fresh culture of E. coli to retrieve the selected gene sequences. This process is not perfect, however, and two to four rounds of selection/re-expression/selection are normally performed iteratively to remove all unwanted clones and enrich the binding population from the background of the library. Nonetheless, this process can be spectacularly powerful, massively enriching specifi c antibodies in a single selection round [ 9 ] . Furthermore, the use of multiple forms of the target antigen in sequential selection rounds and the inclusion of competitor proteins can drive the selected pool toward a highly specifi c set of epitopes.",

By random recombination of V H and V L sequences from human lymphocyte cDNA [ 10 ] , or, by using degenerate oligonucleotides to create diversity of DNA sequence in the loops associated with target binding [ 11 ] , several groups have created very large libraries of antibody gene sequences for phage display. These libraries are analogous to the na\u00efve antibody repertoire in an animal, and selecting from them can result in the identifi cation of antibody fragments that exhibit high specifi city and occasionally high affi nity for the target protein. Several major studies have proven that with appropriate application of this technology, specifi c antibodies can be raised to proteins, peptides, haptens and even carbohydrates. In the most exemplary studies, antibodies have been raised with equivalent affi nities to those associated with a strong humoral immune response [ 12 -15 ] .

It is widely accepted that there are intrinsic diffi culties associated with the humanization of nonhuman antibodies using CDR grafting. Frequently, such grafted antibodies suffer from immunogenicity associated with high non-germ-line amino acid content, the propensity for v-domain destabilization, and very often downstream expression and formulation issues. In a recent study, ultra-humanized antibodies from three nonhuman sources were generated via singlestep complementarity-determining region (CDR) germ-lining in a process termed \" Augmented Binary Substitution\" (ABS) [ 19 ] . This process utilizes phage display for selection from germline targeting combinatorial libraries which results in the identifi cation of CDR residues amenable to human germ-lining without compromising on specifi city and affi nity. A further degree of complexity is incorporated into the library through the random substitution of CDR-H3 residues in tandem with the germ-lining process. This simple single pass process generates signifi cantly lower non-germline sequence content, on CDR grafts from nonhuman hosts, rendering them virtually indistinguishable from fully human antibodies. This process opens up new possibilities for the affi nity maturation and humanization of antibodies from alternative sources such as chickens.",

The simplest and most commonly used fragment is the single-chain fragment variable (scFv) where a fl exible peptide sequence links the V-regions of antibodies between the C-terminus of one domain and the N-terminus of the other, thereby combining both V-domains into a single polypeptide [ 20 ] . The scFv may be assembled in V L -V H or V H -V L orientations, with V H -V L being the most heavily used format historically. The fl exible linker helps to make the scFv simple to express, but must be sufficiently long and fl exible to allow effective association of the V-regions to form a functional antigen-combining site. As long as this is true, the classical hydrophobic pairing of the V-regions will stabilize the structure. By far, the most common linkers are based on glycine-serine repeat structures such as GGGGS \u00d7 3.",

Many people have accepted the viewpoints of recombinant antibody technology experts, that these libraries can yield useful high-affi nity antibodies to any form of antigen . In general, (mostly to those highly skilled in the fi eld), this is indeed true, but the average antibody generated from these libraries is often of disappointingly low affi nity to those who are used to high-sensitivity antibodies from immunized sources.

The target proteins of interest are mixed in a single adjuvant preparation and each immunized animal receives all multiplexed proteins simultaneously. Spleen and bone marrow tissues from the immunized animals are then used to generate relatively small phage display libraries and specifi c antibodies are derived via selection of the library separately on the individual proteins originally used for immunization [ 37 ] . The immunized chickens appear to react to the proteins fully independently, as the phage display libraries generate individual scFv antibody clones that are fully specifi c by western blot and ELISA , showing no reactivity to their co-immunogens [ 37 , 59 ] . This approach has major benefi ts practically and ethically, as it allows the use of a single library to derive high-affi nity antibodies to a group of proteins of interest. Multi-immunization methods also simultaneously minimize animal use and raise the likelihood of success in generating an immediately useful reagent [ 37 , 59 ] .",

Firstly, the simplest scenario combines multiple unrelated proteins, which leads to unrelated B-cell responses after immunization. To derive antibodies of greatest specifi city during a multi-target immunization of this kind, it is important to ensure that each of the protein immunogens is highly purifi ed and that no closely related proteins are co-immunized into a single animal. Secondly, to derive antibodies that are cross-reactive to orthologues of a conserved protein from multiple species, it is likely to be benefi cial, but not necessarily essential, to include each orthologue in the mix of immunogens given to each animal. Iterative selection rounds that change orthologue each time can then be used to bias toward the isolation of cross-reactive antibodies.",

A similar method was proven to be effi cient in the production of Fabs that are specifi cally biotinylated in vivo during bacterial expression, via C-terminal fusion of the Fabs to the E. coli acetyl-CoA carboxylase [ 65 ] . Importantly, these biotinylated Fabs were successfully used to purify recombinant TNF-alpha from bacterial lysates, via a streptavidinated column. The peptide tagging method has also been used successfully to label both Fab and scFv antibodies for their oriented immobilization and use as capture antibodies in clinical diagnostic ELISAs [ 66 , 67 ] .
