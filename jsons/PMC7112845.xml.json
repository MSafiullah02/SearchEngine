Lessons learned from the mouse system are helpful in understanding the execution of innate immune responses in large animals and provide valuable insights applicable to many other species. For this reason throughout the review, we frequently refer to established facts in other species to indicate areas in large animal immunology where data is lacking. This review focuses on studies that are now available to advance the understanding of innate immune responses of cattle and pigs following infection with important pathogens, particularly FMDV.",

However, it remains to be proven if these developmental differences are translated into functional differences. Moreover, according to Hein and Dudler [2], in sheep, establishment of a normal \u03b3\u03b4 T cell repertoire in the periphery is developmentally regulated and dependent on the continual presence of a functional thymus during ontogeny.",

Such losses are more pronounced, particularly in industrialized countries that are free of disease and thus do not practice vaccination against FMDV.

However, following stimulation with cytokines such as IL-2, IL-12, IL-15, IL-18 or interferon alpha (IFN\u03b1), their cytotoxicity significantly increased [34], [35] including cytotoxicity against FMDV infected target cells. However, NK cells isolated from swine infected with FMDV are dysfunctional because of the suppressive nature of the virus infection in vivo\n[36]. Porcine NK cells isolated during acute FMDV infection do not secrete IFN\u03b3 and are not cytotoxic for NK-sensitive targets such as the human lymphocytic cell line, K562 or FMDV infected porcine fibroblasts. Such a status of NK cells may preclude their protective role in the early phase of infection of pigs with FMDV.",

These cells show a transiently activated phenotype characterized by increased expression of CD25, reduced expression of CD62L and CD45RO, and increased production of IFN\u03b3. Most interestingly, WC1+ \u03b3\u03b4 T cells acquire NK-like capabilities to kill an in vitro target, shown by increased storage of perforin and expression of CD335. Data from these studies also indicated that bovine \u03b3\u03b4 T cells might act as antigen presenting cells due to increased expression of major histocompatibility class II molecule (MHC II) and CD13, and the ability to ingest and process exogenous proteins. Gamma delta T cells have been previously shown to act as antigen presenting cells [56]. Whether this activation indicates direct interaction of \u03b3\u03b4 T cells with virus or a bystander effect, is not yet known. Further studies should precisely define particular phenotypes responsible for both NK-like behavior and antigen presenting properties and particularly if these cells are able to activate CD4+ T cells in an antigen-dependent manner. Our data support the earlier findings of Amadori et al. [53], [54] and suggest an important role of \u03b3\u03b4 T cells in the innate immune response against FMDV. In cattle persistently infected with bovine leukemia virus (BLV), administration of recombinant IFN\u03b3 increased the number of \u03b3\u03b4 T cells in circulation and suppressed the replication of BLV in vivo, although no mechanisms were suggested by these authors on how the \u03b3\u03b4 T cells eliminated the IgM+ cells harboring the virus [57].",

CD3\u2212/CD14\u2212/CD21\u2212/CD11c\u2212/NK\u2212/TCR\u03b3\u2212/CD4+/MHCII+/CD45RB+/CD172a+/CD32+ pDCs accounted for 0.1% of the total lymphocyte population in peripheral blood, pseudoafferent lymph and lymph nodes. High levels of type I IFN were produced after stimulation of the cells with the TLR9 agonist CpG and FMDV immune complexes. Depletion of CD4+ cells in vivo reduced the level of type I IFN in the serum of animals following infection with FMDV. These data likely indicate that these pDCs may be critical in generating protective immunity in animals already vaccinated, because the production of type I IFN was dependent on the presence of FMDV-antibody complexes in in vivo experiments. Interestingly, mesenteric lymph nodes yielded DCs with particularly high capacity to produce type I IFN, suggesting a role for these cells in lymph nodes. However, the results reported in the study by Reid et al. [69] do not indicate a role for type I IFN in early phases of infection since no effect on clinical disease was observed following depletion of CD4+ type I IFN producing cells. Further, monocyte-derived DC (MoDC) complexed with dead virus stimulated FMDV-specific CD4+ memory T cells, suggesting a possibility that such complexes could be used to target FMDV in vaccine formulations [65].",

However, moDC and skin DC derived from swine infected with FMDV, failed to produce IFN\u03b1, constitutively or following in vitro stimulation, and this inability to produce IFN\u03b1 coincides with the rising titers of FMDV in the blood. The mechanism of how production of IFN\u03b1 is inhibited was described recently. Data suggests the leader protease (Lpro) of FMDV disrupts the integrity of NF-\u03baB therefore, discontinuing NF-\u03baB-dependent gene transcription [71], [72].

In swine DC are incapacitated and secretion of critical cytokines is disrupted by the infection. Subsequently, the lack of cytokine support and a non-productive interaction of NK cells with virus renders these cells dysfunctional. Although swine \u03b3\u03b4 T cells favourably respond to vaccination with FMDV antigens, no reliable data is available on their reactivity to infection with FMDV. Considering the dysfunction of DCs, it can be speculated that \u03b3\u03b4 T cells from swine may be dysfunctional as well. Conversely, in cattle, \u03b3\u03b4 T cells are transiently activated during the initial phase of infection with FMDV and acquire a level of cytotoxicity against in vitro target cells. Additionally, \u03b3\u03b4 T cells produce IFN\u03b3 which probably influences the activity of NK cells originating from infected cattle as shown in in vitro assays (unpublished data Patch, Dar, et al.). These responses could be initiated by DC. Appearance of antibodies could disrupt this interaction because formation of antibody/FMDV complexes appear to alter tropism of FMDV and dendritic cells are killed when such complexes are internalized through Fc receptors [65].",

The cytopathic strain of the virus did not significantly increase the transcription of TLR3 mRNA, while both cytopathic and non-cytopathic strains upregulated the transcription of TLR7 only after 24 h of infection. Surprisingly, this increased expression of TLR7 did not lead to enhanced type I IFN response in infected monocytes, suggesting that monocytes may play a minor role in overall synthesis of type I IFNs during infection with BVDV. The same authors had earlier shown that infection of macrophages with BVDV did not influence expression of TLR2, 3 and 4. Moreover, TLR signalling detected in these studies was not attributed to increases in TNF\u03b1 or IL-1\u03b2. Persistent infection that usually occurs with BVDV is likely established due to the virus\u2019 ability to suppress the innate immune response components, in this case monocytes, by inhibiting expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines production.",

A minimal amount of research has been performed to understand mechanisms of innate immune responses that possibly contribute to early responses to FMDV. In our studies as well as studies by Salt and colleagues, and Summerfield and colleagues [102], [103], [104], [105], [106], [107], it is clearly demonstrated that early protection is achieved amidst very little antibody production. These data indicate that other mechanisms besides humoral immunity are in play at early time points of infection. We have recently shown that infection with FMDV in cattle induces a rapid although transient activation of \u03b3\u03b4 T cells [55]. Notably, the activation of the innate immune system in the cattle following FMDV infection is the opposite result from what we have reported in swine. Within 24 h following inoculation of pigs with FMDV, DCs stop secreting type I IFN and their numbers are reduced [108], [109]. Further, NK cells isolated from FMDV infected pigs 24\u201396 h after infection do not produce IFN\u03b3 and fail to spontaneously lyse target cells in vitro\n[36], all indicating that the swine innate response is inhibited by the virus.",

Additionally, the initial, high IFN\u03b1 production is curtailed abruptly leading to high levels of viraemia and subsequent lymphopenia. A combination of these two factors may lead to immunosuppression of these innate responses in pigs. Conversely, although vireamia is observed in cattle, levels of IFN\u03b1 are much lower than those in pigs and neither lymphopenia nor immunosuppression of NK cells or \u03b3\u03b4 T cells occurs in cattle [110]. Taken together, a new emphasis is required to focus investigations on the innate immune mechanisms that may be exploited in design of new interventions to control FMDV outbreaks.",

            "text": "Fig. 1: Possible interaction of DC, NK and \u03b3\u03b4 T cells in an innate immune response. The figure shows three major cellular components of the innate immune system. It appears that each of the cellular components might initiate innate responses individually. Mostly because all the cell types express TLR, hence are capable of sensing pathogens. DC, upon encounter with pathogens or receiving signals from the periphery through chemokines, produce cytokines such as IL-1, IL-2, IL-12, IL-15 and IL-18, which are important activators of NK cells. NK cells in turn respond by secreting more cytokines, particularly TNF\u03b1, IFN\u03b3, GM-CSF and HMGB1 that have a regulatory effect on DC and an activating effect on \u03b3\u03b4 T cells. Further, the NK cells proliferate in response to DC cytokines and enhance cytotoxicity against virus infected cells. In addition to cytokines secreted by NK cells \u03b3\u03b4 T cells also, secrete TNF\u03b1 and GM-CSF that affect the DC activation leading to maturation and enhanced expression of MHC class I and II molecules and subsequent antigen presentation. The interplay depicted here account for the effective role played by these cells to counteract infection before it spreads within the host. However, the efficacy with which these mechanisms are executed remains largely unknown in large animal species, since viruses such as FMDV manage to efficiently replicate in swine and cause immunosuppression.",
