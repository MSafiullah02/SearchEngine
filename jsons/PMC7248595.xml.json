To mitigate potential exposure in the staff clinic, all HCWs attending the staff clinic with ARI symptoms were given surgical masks on arrival and were seen in a separate area. All HCWs seeing ARI patients in the staff clinic used N95 masks, eye protection (eg, goggles and face shield), gown, and gloves when seeing patients and taking respiratory specimens because patients with ARI symptoms are suspected for COVID-19, given ongoing community transmission.

For case 1, initial epidemiology investigations revealed that a large number of MSWs had been potentially exposed, given that the index case had returned to work after medical leave ended and worked for 5 days prior to returning to the staff clinic and diagnosis, while still having mild symptoms. Hence, the decision was made to place all MSWs in our institution on home isolation (a total of 103 HCWs) for an initial period of 24 hours while awaiting further investigation. Because this occurred on a weekend, the disruption to patient care was initially minimal. Subsequently, activity mapping and exhaustive phone interviews were conducted with all affected HCWs to identify their potential exposure and to determine whether any of them were potentially symptomatic over the preceding 2 weeks. In total, 16 of 103 MSWs (15.5%) reported that they had had ARI symptoms over the preceding 2 weeks. However, only 1 of the MSWs had previously reported to the staff clinic before a case of COVID-19 was confirmed, and an alternative diagnosis of dengue had been made, based on serologic testing. As a result, heat maps did not pick up the presence of a cluster in the medical social services department (Fig. 1). Of the 16 symptomatic HCWs, 11 (68.8%) had had significant unprotected contact with case 1 and were thus at risk. Of the HCWs working in the same and adjacent cubicle as the index case, 4 of 8 (50%) had ARI symptoms. All symptomatic HCWs were recalled to the staff clinic or ED for SARS-CoV-2 testing. Of the 16 symptomatic HCWs evaluated, 1 HCW (case 2) tested positive for SARS-CoV-2; the rest were negative. Case 2 worked in the same cubicle as case 1 and sat immediately adjacent, <1 m apart (Fig. 2). They did not socialize outside the work setting. Her onset of symptoms occurred 4 days after case 1 returned to work. Cases 1 and 2 had ~30 minutes of face-to-face conversation per day in the office. Surgical masks were not used in the office but were strictly used for HCW\u2013patient contact. Upon confirmation of case 2, the MSWs were reinterviewed to establish their contact history with case 2; however, because case 2 had presented to the staff clinic at the time of symptom onset, additional contacts were minimal. In total, 49 staff were placed on quarantine (home isolation) based on significant unprotected contact with the 2 cases, constituting 49 of 103 total staff (47.5%) of the medical social services department. No additional cases of COVID-19 were detected among the MSWs in 28 days of follow-up of all exposed staff.",

During an ongoing outbreak of SARS-CoV-2, our institution successfully detected and contained a cluster of COVID-19 cases among HCWs, preventing transmission to other HCWs and from HCWs to patients. Early containment of the cluster also minimized the disruption to service. Although almost half of the medical social services department required isolation, our institution did not have to shut down its medical social services department for 2 weeks. We achieved this through an integrated strategy focused on surveillance for early case detection, outbreak investigation and containment, and encouraging compliance with measures for staff protection at the individual level.",

Symptom monitoring, early evaluation at the staff clinic, and staying home if unwell were all crucial parts of our institution\u2019s strategy. Indeed, given that persons with COVID-19 can remain contagious even when minimally symptomatic, the risk that HCWs with mild and nonspecific symptoms can serve as a vector of intrahospital disease spread is real, and even 1 infected HCW returning to work has the potential to cause a nosocomial outbreak with devastating consequences.16 At our institution, all HCWs with COVID-19 presented with relatively mild upper respiratory tract infection; none presented with pneumonia. Monitoring fever alone is unlikely to be sufficient given that most COVID-19 cases were afebrile, unlike SARS cases, for which temperature monitoring was key.17 In our investigation of the MSW cluster, compliance to our institution\u2019s policy of mandatory 5-day medical leave was likely crucial in reducing the potential number of exposed individuals to case 1 when she was most infectious. Emerging data suggest that the viral load in respiratory samples from COVID-19 patients peaks within the first few days after symptom onset before declining.18\n",

During an ongoing outbreak, HCWs may experience anxiety when reporting absence from work due to illness2 or perceive an obligation to work,19 resulting in the phenomenon of \u201cpresenteeism,\u201d or work attendance despite illness.20,21 Mildness of symptoms is a key factor associated with presenteeism;22 this is especially relevant with COVID-19, given mild infection in most individuals.13 Institutional policies should encourage work from home (eg, enhancing teleconferencing and telemedicine capabilities) and should not disincentivize individuals from going on medical leave. In our institution, during the outbreak, medical leave for staff with respiratory syndromes was recorded as hospitalization leave, which has a higher annual entitlement than outpatient sick leave.",

Reflecting ongoing community transmission during the prevailing period,14 most cases acquired infection from the community or from travel; we detected HCW\u2013HCW spread in only 1 case. The COVID-19 situation was unlike our healthcare system\u2019s previous experience with SARS, in which spread was largely nosocomial.17 Although the use of PPE may have helped to prevent patient\u2013HCW transmission, staff surveillance must be vigilant for intrahospital spread occurring outside the usual ward setting, such as office areas and rest areas where HCWs can mingle. Contact among HCWs was shown to be largely assortative in nature; a local study showed that HCWs reported contact with other HCWs of the same type as the next most frequent class of contact after patients.23 Thus, initial infections may be concentrated among HCWs of the same type after its introduction into a given setting by an infectious HCW, as occurred in our first staff cluster among MSWs. Given that all HCWs are potentially at risk during a period of ongoing community transmission, surveillance needs to be extended to all staff, not just HCWs who are predominantly ward based (eg, doctors and nurses). This surveillance is especially crucial, given that the potential of transmission from HCWs to patients by allied health professionals should not be underestimated. In local studies, allied health professionals had both the longest cumulative contact time and longest contact episode duration with patients.23 All HCW strategies need to include nonclinical and ancillary staff to ensure adequate business continuity for hospitals during a pandemic.24 Our detection of HCW clusters in which transmission likely occurred outside work highlights the importance of practicing social distancing outside the work setting.",

However, given that the diagnostic yield of PCR testing for SARS-CoV-2 would likely be dependent on the quality and type of respiratory tract sample, similar to results of testing for other coronaviruses,25 COVID-19 cases may have been missed due to sampling issues. The follow-up of potentially exposed HCWs to test for seroconversion and further epidemiological studies using serological tests, when such tests are developed, would be useful. Our results also reflect the experience of a healthcare institution in a SARS-CoV-2 outbreak during which the prevailing national strategy was one of containment.8 Exhaustive testing, surveillance, and isolation of potentially exposed HCWs may not be feasible in a healthcare system that is overwhelmed.16 However, staff surveillance is a crucial component of outbreak control during the containment phase to reduce the likelihood of nosocomial transmission and to sustain confidence and morale in the healthcare system.2,19,24\n",
