More than 1.5 billion adults above the 20 age mark are found to be overweight out of which 200 million men and about 300 million women obese. In the twenty-first century, excessive body mass and obesity are common health difficulties in contemporary society, predominantly in developed nations. Obesity is increasingly linked to several diseases and metabolic complications like cardiovascular diseases, diabetes and cancer [1]. Environmental and genetic factors have been linked to predispose individuals to increase risk of obesity. Obesity, an impending global pandemic, is not being effectively controlled by current measures such as lifestyle modifications, bariatric surgery or available medications. Its toll on health and economy compels us to look for more effective measures [2]. Development of anti-obesity drugs has often been riddled with problems in the past. Some of the recently approved drugs for pharmacotherapy of obesity have been lorcaserin, phentermine/topiramate and naltrexone/ bupropion combinations. Although many anti-obesity drugs have been in use but due to several side effects newer and safer alternatives are highly sought after [3].",

FTO is currently a potential target for anti-obesity drugs [4] and one of the salient genes implicated in obesity [5]. It has also linked to obesity-related ailments, like cardiovascular diseases [1], hypertension [6], polycystic ovary syndrome [7], and type II diabetes [8]. The Signal transducer and activator transcription gene (STAT-3) function saliently in energy metabolism and is highly expressed in manifold metabolic tissues. It is an associate of the STAT protein family, which upon phosphorylation in response to growth factors and different cytokines is translocated to the nucleus of the cell in other to function as a transcription factors [9]. Phosphorylated STAT3 induces expression of SOCS3, which acts as a feedback inhibitor of the leptin signaling pathway [10, 11] and targeted deletion of STAT3 from neural tissue of mice, results in obesity [12].",

Annona muricata is a member of the Annonaceae family and it is a fruit-bearing tree with a lengthy antiquity of folkloric use. A. muricata, also well-known as soursop, graviola and guanabana, is a perennial plant which is mostly found in tropical and subtropical sections of the world [14]. The fruits of A. muricata are expansively used to make syrups, candies, beverages, ice creams as well as shakes. An extensive array of ethnomedicinal activities is underwritten of different parts of A. muricata, and home-grown societies in Africa and South America lengthily use this plant in their folk medicine [15, 16]. Abundant studies have substantiated these therapeutic activities comprising anticancer, anticonvulsant, anti-arthritic, antiparasitic [14, 16], antimalarial, hepatoprotective and antidiabetic activities [17, 18]. Extensive phytochemical assessments on various parts of A. muricata plant have revealed the presence of different phytoconstituents, which include alkaloids, phenolics, megastigmanes, flavonol triglycosides, cyclopeptides and essential oils amist others [14, 19].",

Although the anti-obesity effect of this plant have been documented but the underlying mechanism is still very unclear. In the current study, we identified the molecular target of A. muricata-derived compounds as fat mass and obesity associated gene (FTO). FTO is the first gene associated with body mass index (BMI) and risk for diabetes [25]. FTO is highly expressed in the brain and pancreas, and is involved in regulating dietary intake and energy expenditure [26]. High expression of FTO gene has been reported in obesity and down-regulation of FTO gene expression seems a logical approach to the management of obesity [27].",

The expression of FTO gene was up-regulated in high fat diet induce obese rats (HFD) when compared to the control group (Fig. 2). This result was consistent with previously documented literature [5, 28\u201330]. Treatment of obese rats with Annona muricata (200 mg/kg) for 21 days showed significant down-regulation of FTO gene expression when compared to obese untreated rats. This was probably possible due to the vast enormity of phytochemicals in A. muricata extract especially the annonioside and annonaine that showed highest binding interaction with FTO from docking experiment relative to other phytochemicals found in A. muricata (Table 4) The down-regulation of FTO by phytocompounds in Annona muricata is an indication that they are inhibitors of FTO. The transformation of obese rats to normal after 21 days (data not shown) of treatment with A. muricata leave was as a result of reduced food intake as global overexpression of FTO has been known to cause obesity due to increased food intake [31].",
