The workshop was planned by a committee of 6 physician-scientists from US academic institutions or from the Division of Geriatrics and Clinical Gerontology in the NIA. The planning committee selected speakers and participants for their expertise in asthma, pulmonology, allergy/immunology, primary care, emergency medicine, geriatrics, and/or gerontologic science (see the list of participants in Appendix 1). The immediate goals of this workshop were to summarize the current understanding of the mechanisms of asthma in older persons and to identify knowledge gaps and research opportunities leading to improved medical care and health outcomes for older persons with asthma. These research opportunities are discussed in the body of this report and summarized in Table I . [7] [8] [9] In addition, the NIA, in collaboration with the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute and the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, recently issued a set of program announcements inviting research proposals on asthma in older adults (http:// grants.nih.gov/grants/guide/pa-files/PA-10-263.html, http://grants. nih.gov/grants/guide/pa-files/PA-10-264.html, and http://grants. nih.gov/grants/guide/pa-files/PA-10-265.html).",

[15] [16] [17] After a finite number of divisions, normal somatic cells invariably enter a state of irreversibly arrested growth, a process termed replicative senescence. 18 In fact, it has been proposed that escape from the regulators of senescence is the antecedent of malignant transformation. However, the role of replicative senescence as an explanation of organismal aging remains the subject of vigorous debate. The controversy relates, in part, to the fact that certain organisms (eg, Drosophila species and Caenorhabditis elegans) undergo an aging process, yet all of their adult cells are postreplicative.",

The number of divisions turns out to be more important than the actual amount of time passed. Thus cells held in a quiescent state for months, when allowed back into a proliferative environment, will continue approximately the same number of divisions as those that were allowed to proliferate without a quiescent period. 19 The question remains whether this in vitro phenomenon is relevant to animal aging. One suggestive observation is that fibroblasts cultured from samples of old skin undergo fewer cycles of replication than those from young skin. 20 Furthermore, when various species are compared, replicative potential is directly and significantly related to lifespan. 21 An unusual b-galactosidase with activity peaks at pH 6 has proved to be a useful biomarker of in vitro senescence because it is expressed by senescent but not presenescent or quiescent fibroblasts. 22 This particular b-galactosidase isoform was found to have the predicted pattern of expression in skin from young and old donors, with measurably increased levels in dermal fibroblasts and epidermal keratinocytes with advancing age. 22 The nature of the expression of this in vivo biomarker of aging in other tissues will be important to discern.",

            "text": "For clinical investigators, frailty has proved hard to define primarily because of the seemingly insurmountable heterogeneity inherent in geriatric populations on the basis of these variable rates of organ system decrease and the presence or absence of 1 or more diseases. 9 Yet, regardless of the pathway taken to frailty, the clinical picture has common features, including a reduction in lean body mass (sarcopenia), loss of bone mass (osteopenia), cognitive impairment, functional decline, and anemia. On the basis of data derived from large cohorts of elderly patients, Fried et al 23 have offered an operational definition of frailty incorporating an assessment of 5 specific characteristics to ascribe a frailty index. On this 5-point scale, a score of 3 or more has been shown to be independently predictive of a range of adverse clinical outcomes, including acute illness, falls, hospitalization, nursing home placement, and early mortality. [23] [24] [25] Furthermore, simple performance measures, such as the assessment of walking speed, are predictive of important outcomes, including survival. 26 With the phenotype better defined, attention has shifted to pathophysiology. Although frailty can occur in the absence of a diagnosable illness, the fact that some become frail and others do not suggests an inherent or acquired variability in homeostatic pathways. Recent evidence from observational studies has raised suspicion that dysregulated inflammatory processes are involved in, if not central to, the variable patterns of aging. Increased serum levels of certain proinflammatory cytokines, most notably IL-6, are increasingly present with advancing age and to a greater extent with frailty. 27, 28 Furthermore, the appearance of this and other inflammatory markers has been associated with a number of adverse clinical outcomes, including decreased strength and mobility, falls, dementia, and mortality. 27 Life expectancy, lifespan, and maximum survival From the perspective of those who study aging, there is an important distinction made between median (life expectancy) and maximum lifespan. Over the past several decades, with the advent of modern sanitation, refrigeration, and other public health measures, including vaccination and antibiotics, there has been a dramatic increase in median survival. 29 Early deaths have been diminished, and more patients are reaching old age. In the United States today, life expectancy now approaches 80 years. 30 Median survival is what concerns public health officials and health care providers, but for those studying the biology of aging, it is maximum survival that is the focus of greatest attention. It is worthwhile to note that it has been estimated that if atherosclerosis and cancer were eliminated from the population as a cause of death, about 10 years would be added to the average lifespan, yet there would be no change in maximum lifespan. 31 Although several theories have been proposed, none suffice to account for the complexities of aging. Lifespan is finite and varies generally from species to species and much less so within species. Mice live, on average, 2\u00bd years, monkeys 30 years, and human subjects about 90 years. Among species, larger animals generally live longer than smaller animals, but within species, smaller animals are likely to live longer. It is clear that aging is not entirely explained by DNA sequence. For example, mice and bats have only 0.25% difference in their primary DNA sequence, but bats live for 25 years, 10 times longer than mice. A commonly held notion is that regulation of gene expression accounts for a longevity difference between species.

For example, transgenic Drosophila species expressing increased copies of the free radical scavenging enzymes superoxide dismutase and catalase live on average a third longer than the appropriate controls. 32 In even lower species (eg, yeast and nematodes) the identification of specific genes that influence lifespan 33, 34 has led to the optimistic impression that analogous genes in higher organisms will lead greater insights into the aging process.

Lung function is traditionally assessed by means of a number of standardized methods. The most common measurement used is spirometry with the determination of FEV 1 and forced vital capacity (FVC). FEV 1 and FVC both show continuous decreases of between 25 and 30 mL with each year of life after about age 20 years. 39 The cause of this decrease is usually attributed to the loss of the driving forces for airflow as a result of reduced respiratory muscle performance, loss of static elastic recoil, or both. 39, 40 The decrease in FEV 1 in asthmatic patients is largely a function of the decrease in FVC because of the increase in residual volume. 41 Stiffening of the chest wall and reduced respiratory muscle performance result in a decrease in total lung capacity and an increase in residual volume because of ever-increasing closing volume. 42 Accordingly, these aging processes lead to airflow limitation that might be hard to distinguish from an active disease process. Not all older persons are able to perform spirometry, especially those with decreased cognition, coordination, and frailty. In addition, spirometry is effort dependent, and the very old can tire quickly. Techniques of imaging and measures of lung function not requiring effort (ie, forced oscillation) should be used in future studies to extend our knowledge about lung structure-function relationships at the very end of life.",

Probable asthma was defined as a history of wheezing in the past year associated with chest tightness or breathlessness. Excluding smokers and those with a diagnosis of congestive heart failure, 4% of subjects had definite asthma, and 4% had probable asthma. Among those who smoked, 11% had definite asthma, and 14% had probable asthma. Among nonsmokers, 185 subjects were identified who had definite or probable asthma; 76% were women, and 20% were older than 80 years. The age of asthma onset was spread approximately evenly among decades. Twenty-seven percent had late onset of disease after age 60 years, and 25% had onset of disease before age 20 years. As expected, respiratory symptoms in the older asthmatic subjects were more prevalent, with a 2-to 5-fold increase in cough, phlegm, wheezing, and dyspnea. Dyspnea on exertion was 1.6-fold more likely to be present in asthmatic patients than in those without the diagnosis. Lung function was reduced in those with a diagnosis of asthma. Mean FEV 1 was 77% of predicted value in those with definite asthma and 89% of predicted value in those with probable asthma compared with 96% in those who did not have asthma. Forty-one percent of those with a diagnosis of asthma had airflow obstruction below the fifth percentile for the age group, and peak flow lability was increased. Elderly asthmatic patients reported the most common trigger was a viral infection in 58% compared with animal allergies in 30%. Two thirds reported seasonal worsening. Asthma had a significant effect on quality of life, with 35% of patients with definite or probable asthma reporting a fair or poor health status compared with 17% of elderly patients without asthma. Sixty percent of patients with definite asthma reported seasonal allergic rhinitis compared with only 30% in the nonasthma group. Despite the high prevalence and morbidity of asthma in this population, inadequate treatment was common.

Many questions about this issue remain: Is asthma the same disease in older adults as it is in children and younger adults? Is late-onset asthma (LOA; asthma that starts in middle age or older) different from longstanding asthma (LSA; asthma of early onset that has persisted into older adulthood)? If LOA and LSA are the same disease, then the diagnosis and treatment should be similar. However, if LOA and LSA are different phenotypes or at least have a different cause and pathophysiology, then the diagnosis and treatment might differ (Table II) .",

            "text": "The traditional view of disease susceptibility has been expanded to include epigenetics to account for the influence of environmental factors and aging on the genomic blueprint. Epigenetics is defined as heritable changes in gene expression that occur without alterations in DNA sequence. It is the process by which genotype interacts with environment to produce a phenotype and explains differences between cells, tissues, and organs despite identical genetic information. Genes function in a milieu determined by the developmental and environmental history of the cell, which constitutes the epigenotype. 53, 54 Epigenetic changes or marks can play a major role in human disease. 55, 56 The most common examples of epigenetic marks are DNA methylation of CpG islands by DNA methyltransferases and chromatin modification of histone proteins, particularly acetylation by histone acetyltransferases and histone deacetylases. 57, 58 The function of epigenetic changes is to regulate gene expression. Epigenetic changes are known to contribute to cancer and autoimmune disease and are thought to contribute to common diseases, including cardiovascular disease, diabetes, and the loss of response to stress caused by aging. 59 Asthma is a markedly heterogeneous disease, and recent evidence suggests that environmentally induced epigenetic changes contribute to asthma phenotypes and that airway inflammation in patients with asthma and COPD might involve epigenetic regulation. 57, 58, 60 Methylation patterns and chromatin structure change with age and are thought to contribute to the increase in the incidence of common diseases that begin in middle age. 55, 61 The incidence of asthma in the elderly resembles the incidence of common diseases. Moreover, characteristics and asthma drug response in the elderly asthmatic patient differ from those seen in childhood asthma. Compared with younger cohorts, elderly asthmatic patients have a higher prevalence, higher rates of bronchial hyperreactivity, more severe asthma, and a lower prevalence of atopy. The symptoms of elderly asthmatic patients are more difficult to control with drug therapy, and these patients have steroid resistance and might respond better to leukotriene receptor antagonists compared with inhaled corticosteroids. [62] [63] [64] [65] [66] [67] [68] [69] [70] [71] The contribution of epigenetics to differences observed between elderly asthmatic patients and younger cohorts is unknown. Unlike genetic variants that contribute to disease, epigenetic changes can be reversed and therefore represent potential drug targets. 72",

Thus the effect of aging on T-cell function in the context of allergen stimulation might be different than the effects of aging on T-cell function in the context of viral infection. Given that asthma is an inflammatory disorder of the airway, it is of interest to determine whether asthmatic airway inflammation of the elderly might differ from that of younger asthmatic patients and thus represent a distinct phenotype of asthma.

It is not known whether immunosenescence affects the production of these mediators in elderly asthmatic patients, either at baseline or during an exacerbation of symptoms. Furthermore, it is not known whether age-related changes in their production would have any implication for the clinical presentation or management of asthma in the elderly. Peripheral blood eosinophils were isolated from younger (20-40 years old) and older (55-80 years old) subjects for in vitro functional assays.

The Epidemiology and Natural History of Asthma (TENOR) study examined the natural history of asthma in older (>65 years old) compared with younger patients and found that older asthmatic patients had lower total IgE levels, fewer positive skin prick test responses, and less concomitant allergic rhinitis or atopic dermatitis. 81 Several studies have demonstrated age-related decreases in total IgE and allergen-specific IgE levels, [82] [83] [84] [85] [86] [87] suggesting that this might be the explanation for the decrease in allergy symptoms. There is also evidence for an age-related decrease in skin prick test responses to allergens. 88 However, the relationship between total IgE levels and allergic disease persists in the elderly, such that subjects with greater IgE levels remain more likely to have allergic rhinitis or asthma. 89, 90 Given the changes in allergic inflammation with aging, one might conclude that asthma in the elderly should be milder. However, there are several other common triggers for exacerbations of asthma, including irritants (eg, cold air) and respiratory tract infections. Estimates suggest that up to 80% of asthma exacerbations in adults are caused by viral upper respiratory tract infections. 91 The role of environmental exposures and allergy in older asthmatic patients is largely unknown. In the general population, evidence regarding the effect of indoor pollution on asthma is summarized in ''Clearing the air: asthma and indoor air exposure'' by the Institute of Medicine for the Environmental Protection Agency published in 2000. 92 Evidence was reported for asthma development related to house dust mites and for asthma development associated with environmental tobacco smoke in preschool children. The report also showed evidence for causation of asthma exacerbations for house dust mite, environmental tobacco smoke (in preschool children), cat, and cockroach; an association with exacerbations was found for dogs, fungi, formaldehyde, and rhinovirus. In addition, evidence associating exacerbation of asthma-related symptoms with self-reported damp air was reported in a review of damp indoor spaces and health. 93, 94 There are only a few studies that have evaluated the role of atopy in elderly patients with asthma. One large national study of allergy skin tests that included older adults 95 and several small studies of allergy skin tests in older adults with asthma 81,96-103 J ALLERGY CLIN IMMUNOL VOLUME 128, NUMBER 3 were reviewed. Allergy skin test results were positive in 8% to 12% of all older adults. The prevalence of positive skin test results or specific IgE levels to at least 1 allergen in older adults with asthma ranged from 0% to 75%. Those whose asthma had an unknown age of onset ranged from 27% to 60%, those with onset before age 41 years ranged from 56% to 62%, and those with onset greater than age 41 years ranged from 0% to 24% (Table III) . 97, 101, 102 Although there were no studies of allergen room exposure or bronchial challenge in older adults, neither prick-puncture skin test results nor specific IgE levels predicted the nasal challenge response to dust mites. 104 Safety concerns for allergen challenges in older adults are unresolved. Technical limitations of allergens, environmental measurements, and age-specific norms and cutoff levels for laboratory and physiologic tests are needed.",

Although studies to date have largely focused on the role of viruses in COPD exacerbations, it is reasonable to extrapolate infection rates and specific pathogens from these studies to older adults with asthma. Johnston, 115 in Ontario, Canada, found a seasonal peak in emergency department visits for all acute respiratory tract infections, as well as exacerbations of both COPD and asthma, for persons younger and older than 50 years. All the common respiratory tract viruses have been associated with COPD exacerbations, and depending on the methodology and season of study, the specific rates of influenza, RSV, parainfluenza viruses, coronaviruses, hMPV, and rhinoviruses vary. 116, 117 Wheezing appears to be a common symptom in older adults infected with any of the respiratory tract viruses, particularly RSV and hMPV, and 7% of adults hospitalized with RSV will have a discharge diagnosis of asthma. 114, 118 Because most adult infections represent reinfection, the viral load in respiratory secretions tends to be low, making detection with conventional techniques difficult. Viral culture and rapid antigen testing, which can be used successfully in children, have poor sensitivity in older adults. The use of molecular diagnostics has vastly improved the ability to detect a number of viruses, such as RSV, parainfluenza, and rhinoviruses, and allows the detection of hitherto uncultivable agents, such as hMPV and coronaviruses.",

These symptoms are often worse at night and with exertion and, like those in younger asthmatic patients, are often precipitated by an upper respiratory tract infection. In fact, the majority of elderly patients who have asthma after age 65 years have their first asthmatic symptom preceded immediately by or concomitant with an upper respiratory tract infection. 122 Asthma can often be triggered by environmental exposures, such as aeroallergens, irritants (cigarette smoke, household aerosols, and paints), strong odors (perfumes), and inhalation of metabisulfites (found in beer, wine, and food preservatives). Asthmatic symptoms can also be triggered by medications, such as aspirin, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory agents, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, or b-blockers, which are commonly used by this patient population. This emphasizes the need for the physician to perform a comprehensive review of medications taken by the older asthmatic patient.",

One reason, as shown in large community studies, is that most patients first have asthma in childhood or adolescence, and many physicians have had the misconception that asthma is a childhood disease. Another important reason is that the symptoms of asthma are more commonly associated with other diseases seen in this age group. The symptoms of asthma in the elderly are therefore nonspecific and might be caused by conditions that mimic asthma. The differential diagnosis of asthma in the elderly is greater than seen in younger asthmatic patients and includes congestive heart failure, emphysema and chronic bronchitis (COPD), chronic aspiration, gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD), and tracheobronchial tumors. Comorbid illnesses and the psychosocial effects of aging might also profoundly affect the diagnosis, clinical presentation, and care of asthma in the elderly. One particular diagnosis that is often difficult to detect and frequently overlooked by the patient and physician until the condition is advanced is upper airway obstruction, including the extrathoracic and intrathoracic central airways. Common causes of upper airway obstruction include malignancy, infection, inflammatory disorders, trauma, and extrinsic compression related to enlargement of adjacent structures (eg, an enlarged thyroid gland). It appears that malignancy and benign strictures related to airway instrumentation (eg, endotracheal intubation and tracheostomy) are becoming increasingly more prevalent in the older age group.",

Approximately 85% of patients with tobacco-related COPD demonstrate bronchodilator reversibility at least once on repeated testing sessions.

Some studies of elderly asthmatic patients have shown that, as a group, as many as 40% will have their first attack after the age of 40 years. 97 Patients belonging to this group tend to have fewer atopic manifestations, higher baseline FEV 1 , and a more pronounced bronchodilator response than those with LSA. Patients with LSA start having asthma symptoms early in life. Patients belonging to this group tend to have a higher incidence of atopic diseases, more severe and irreversible or partially reversible airway obstruction, and more hyperinflation. The duration of the disease in this group is an important determinant of severity and of the development of irreversible airflow obstruction. 128 Longitudinal studies of asthmatic populations, whether new onset or long standing, have shown that remission from asthma is uncommon in older groups, occurring in less than 20% of patients. 130 This contrasts with asthma in children and adolescents, in whom remission of asthma symptoms is common, especially in the second decade of life, and might be seen in as many as 60% to 70% of patients.",

Although complete reversibility of airflow obstruction is frequently seen with young asthmatic patients, most elderly asthmatic patients show incomplete reversibility despite continuous intense therapy, and many show fixed airflow obstruction as if they have COPD. However, objective measures of lung function, such as spirometric and peak flow measurements, are generally underused in elderly patients, and this also contributes to the delay or absence of diagnosis. 134, 135 Lung function testing is especially important in this age group because of the age-related reduction in the perception of dyspnea seen in the elderly. 127 Spirometry is easily performed to determine that FEV 1 and FEV 1 /FVC ratio are demonstrated with the timed vital capacity maneuver. The flow-volume loop, which also measures inspiratory flow, is especially useful when the cause of respiratory tract symptoms is not known and an upper airway obstruction is in the differential diagnosis. Although it might be difficult to perform spirometry in the elderly in some situations because of physical and poor cognitive impairment, studies have demonstrated that between 82% and 93% of elderly patients are able to perform the test properly. [131] [132] [133] [134] [135] On the other hand, it might be more difficult to define the lower limits of predicted normal values in this age group. Traditionally, an FEV 1 /FVC ratio of less than 70% increases the probability of asthma in an elderly patient with asthma symptoms, but this ratio normally decreases with age because of a decrease in elastic recoil, and a ratio lower that 70% might be a normal finding. 136 A brisk response to a short-acting bronchodilator might demonstrate the second cardinal feature of asthma: reversible airflow obstruction (ie, ''a responder''). When airflow obstruction is found in an elderly patient, attempts should be made to demonstrate reversibility after the inhalation of a short-acting b-adrenergic agent, such as albuterol. Evidence of reversibility (postbronchodilator FEV 1 or FVC increases of >12% and 200 mL) increases the probability of a diagnosis of asthma. Elderly asthmatic patients, however, might have an impaired b-agonist bronchodilator response because the number of b-adrenergic receptors on smooth airway muscles is decreased with aging. 137 Although the bronchodilator response to inhaled b-agonists decreases with age, 138 this is not the case with anticholinergic agents. 139 Airway obstruction might be absent at the time of testing, and further testing might be needed to facilitate the diagnosis. Bronchoprovocation testing with a methacholine challenge can be useful, and it is a safe and effective method to uncover asthma in older adults. 140, 141 A negative test result will rule out asthma; a positive test result must be interpreted and include an assessment of pretest probability. 142 In addition, some studies have shown that bronchial responsiveness is heightened in older adults, and therefore aging might be an independent factor that influences airway responsiveness. 143 There is a relationship between the degree of bronchial hyperresponsiveness and prechallenge pulmonary function; a low FEV 1 predicts heightened responsiveness. 144 Other factors that might contribute to heightened airway responsiveness in the older population are atopy and current or previous smoking history.",

However, studies have shown that differences in lung function tests, although statistically significant, cannot be used clinically to separate the 2 groups of subjects because of a large overlap. 147 There is growing evidence that the airway function of young and middle-aged asthmatic patients decreases at a greater rate than that of healthy subjects. [148] [149] [150] The rate of decrease increases with increasing age and in those who smoke cigarettes. 149, 151 In patients with LOA, there is evidence that lung function is reduced even before a diagnosis is made and decreases rapidly shortly after diagnosis. 98, 152 Thereafter, it remains fairly stable. Although the effect on older asthmatic patients with LSA is variable, in a random survey of 1200 elderly asthmatic patients older than 65 years, only 1 in 5 patients had normal pulmonary function (FEV 1 >80% of predicted value), whereas a similar number showed moderate-to-severe airflow obstruction (FEV 1 <50% of predicted value) after an inhaled short-acting bronchodilator. 153 Because structural changes of emphysema are minimal in elderly asthmatic patients, except if they are previous smokers, airway remodeling is thought to be the main cause of fixed airflow obstruction.",

Although high levels of NO are found in nasally expired air, studies in pulmonary inflammation have avoided this by redirecting airflow through the oral airway. It has been found that exhaled NO reflects airways inflammation and particularly eosinophilic inflammation. Exhaled NO levels are increased during the allergy season in atopic subjects. Inhaled glucocorticoids promptly suppress exhaled NO and do so in conjunction with suppression of eosinophilic inflammatory infiltrates. Studies have demonstrated that monitoring exhaled NO might permit better regulation of asthmatic symptoms, exacerbations, and total steroid use than treatments based on guidelines or symptoms.

It appears that NO production and vascular responses to NO might be diminished in the elderly, but that effect might be overcome by exercise to increase fitness. An unanswered question in airways biology is whether NO is causative of airways dysfunction, a marker for this dysfunction, or an ineffective homeostatic response to airways constriction. [155] [156] [157] [158] [159] Challenges in defining asthma in the elderly There is agreement that asthma is both a common and underrecognized health problem for the elderly that leads to impairments of lung function and quality of health and life. The first question that needs to be addressed is why we need to make such a diagnosis rather than just treat the symptoms. There are reasons that physicians must strive to assign a diagnosis to a patient with a symptom complex. The patient is given relief by letting him or her know what is wrong by giving the illness a name, which implies a cause, establishes a prognosis, and initiates a treatment plan. Moreover, advancement of the understanding of epidemiology, natural history, pathobiology, and treatment require a definable disease entity. Whether the threshold for diagnostic criteria is set at a high level of sensitivity, a high level of specificity, or a high level of accuracy depends entirely on the costs and benefits of an incorrect diagnosis versus a missed diagnosis. For example, enumeration of a disease might require a high level of accuracy, whereas diagnosis of an uncommon and difficult-to-treat disease (eg, metastatic cancer) ought to be highly specific. The diagnosis of a common and easily treatable disease (eg, vitamin deficiency) ought to be highly sensitive, even if there is a risk of overdiagnosis. Asthma tends to be one of those disorders that is relatively easy (although not inexpensive) to treat and has morbid consequences if left untreated, suggesting that the diagnostic criteria ought to be highly sensitive.",

The elderly without asthma tend to show some signs suggestive of asthma: slower emptying of the lung during forced expiration, decreased lung elastic recoil, and a higher prevalence of nonspecific airways reactivity.",

In young adults a history of asthma, wheeze, or treatment for asthma plus a positive methacholine challenge test result is highly specific for asthma (99%) but misses about half of the asthmatic population. 160 In epidemiologic studies that have examined various criteria for diagnosing asthma, it turns out that the solution is relatively J ALLERGY CLIN IMMUNOL VOLUME 128, NUMBER 3 simple. Patients who answer yes to the question ''Have you ever had asthma?'' have nearly 100% specificity and 48% to 100% sensitivity when compared with those receiving an independent expert's diagnosis. 161, 162 The problem of diagnosing asthma in the elderly is more complicated because of the overlap with COPD. Asthma is typically considered a disease of onset in youth driven by atopy and eosinophilic inflammation causing reversible airflow limitation. COPD, in contrast, is considered to be a disease of onset in middle age driven by cigarette smoking and neutrophilic inflammation and leading to irreversible airflow limitation. As evidence presented in this workshop has shown, asthma in the elderly displays many of the features of COPD. The disease can have its symptomatic onset late in life, often is only partially reversible, and is associated with neutrophilic inflammation. Moreover, the current cohort of elderly patients has a high prevalence of past smoking, reflecting the health habits in the United States in the 1940s and 1950s.",

            "text": "Tools assessing physical function: Self-reported and objective A major goal of geriatric and gerontologic research is to reduce the decrease in cognitive and physical function and prevent disability among older adults. Accordingly, many functional status measures have been developed and used to understand the disabling process, as well as to evaluate interventions to prevent functional decline. It is useful to identify instruments that measure functional limitations and disability to investigate the functional consequences of asthma in older adults and to understand the pathway from asthma to disability. Functional limitations are restrictions in performing basic physical and mental actions at the whole-person level (eg, walking or climbing stairs), whereas disability refers to limitations or difficulty in performing socially defined roles or tasks of everyday living in a given environmental context (eg, grocery shopping or bathing). 187, 188 Both self-reported and objective measures can be used to measure these different stages of disablement. 189 Self-reported measures can provide an indication of how well a patient is functioning in daily life and provide an assessment of care needs. These measures incorporate self-perception of function and can assess adaptations made to compensate for decrements in function. 190 For disability assessment, self-reported difficulty or inability to perform basic activities of daily living (ADL) is commonly used. For example, a composite score of 8 ADL items has been used as an outcome to evaluate the efficacy of a program to prevent functional decline in frail older adults. 191 Other composite scores assessing difficulty in ambulation, stair climbing, transferring, upper extremity function, and basic and instrumental ADLs have been developed. 192 These comprehensive instruments of function and disability are amenable to computer adaptive testing. 193 Several objective measures of physical performance are used in studies of older adults and in disease-specific patient populations. Tests of physical performance eliminate subjective attitudinal differences in the patient's reporting of physical function limitations. They have the advantage of providing an objective measure for comparisons across populations. 194 These tests are sensitive to change over time and can detect decrements in function that might not be observed with self-reported instruments. Many studies in older adults have used physical performance tests as predictors of adverse health events, as well as outcomes.",

At a time when memory loss is common and financial resources are often limited, many older patients require complicated and frequent dosing with multiple expensive drugs. Unfortunately, this has led to a significant rate of noncompliance among the elderly population in general. 45 Sex, socioeconomic factors, educational level, marital status, and severity of disease do not seem to be good predictors of compliance in elderly asthmatic patients. In summary, there are many challenges in the treatment of asthma in the elderly, which include a greater propensity to experience adverse events from medication use, as well as potential drug interactions with medications used for the treatment of comorbidities, 4,96 and thus it is particularly important to treat any disease in the elderly, including asthma, with a minimum of therapy while attaining maximum efficacy.",

Oral corticosteroids should be avoided if possible because they place the patient at risk for bone fracture and increased likelihood of cataracts, muscle weakness, back pain, bruising, and oral candidiasis. 202 Many studies have shown that inhaled corticosteroids are safe and effective treatment for persistent asthma, but none have specifically targeted the elderly population. Long-term use of inhaled corticosteroids has been associated with a good safety profile, but higher doses of inhaled steroids (eg, >1000 mg/d) are capable of causing hypothalamicpituitary-adrenal axis suppression. Local adverse effects, such as hoarseness, dysphonia, cough, and oral candidiasis, do occur but can usually be avoided by the use of a spacer or holding chamber with the metered-dose inhaler and by rinsing the mouth after each use. Despite the pivotal role of inhaled corticosteroids in asthma, many elderly patients are undertreated with this group of medications. 5, 203 Leukotriene-modifying agents (LTMs) are also asthma controllers. These agents have been shown to be effective in preventing allergen-induced asthma, exercise-induced asthma, and aspirin-induced bronchospasm. Studies on their use in the elderly are limited. When compared with LTMs, low-dose inhaled corticosteroids have favored the latter. The LTMs might also reduce asthma exacerbation rates and the need for steroid bursts. The LTMs are generally very safe. 66, 204 b-Adrenergic agents are important medications in the acute and chronic management of asthma. Elderly patients with asthma J ALLERGY CLIN IMMUNOL VOLUME 128, NUMBER 3 might be less responsive to certain bronchodilators compared with younger patients. 73, 138 Inhaled short-acting b 2 -adrenergic agonists are the treatment of choice for the acute exacerbation of asthma symptoms. Despite the minimal systemic absorption seen with these agents, slight tachycardia might be observed. This is presumably because of vasodilatation, which results from the stimulation of b 2 -receptors in vascular smooth muscle. Tremor can also occur and is especially troublesome in the geriatric patient. Tremor is thought to be caused by stimulation of b 2 -receptors in skeletal muscle. In general, they have been proven to be safe and effective in all age groups. 205 However, b-agonists can cause (1) a dose-dependent decrease in serum potassium levels and (2) a dose-dependent increase in the QT interval on electrocardiography. Because sudden death from ventricular arrhythmia can be caused by both of these mechanisms, as well as being a complication of ischemic heart disease, the use of b-agonists in the elderly should be closely monitored. Short-acting b 2 -agonists should be used for rescue of symptoms, whereas long-acting agents should be used as maintenance medications only as an add-on to inhaled corticosteroids and never as stand-alone therapy.",

In addition, health care use was high in this population. Telephone intervention offers a simple option in the management of elderly patients with asthma. It has been shown that asthma care by means of telephone triage of adult asthmatic patients can lead to a higher percentage of asthmatic patients being reviewed at less cost per patient and without loss of asthma control when compared with usual routine care in the outpatient clinic. 215 However, it has not been determined whether such an intervention could improve asthma care specifically in persons aged 65 years or older. The following study was designed to evaluate this question.",

The intervention group received an asthma-specific questionnaire, and the control group received a general health questionnaire. Medication use and health care use were evaluated at the beginning and end of a 12-month period. The study was completed by 23 control and 25 intervention subjects. Baseline data were similar in both groups. After 12 months, 72% (n 5 18) of the intervention group was taking an inhaled corticosteroid compared with 40% (n 5 10) of the control group. The intervention group had fewer emergency department visits when compared with the control group. Sixtyfour percent (n 5 16) of the intervention group had an asthma action plan compared with 26% (n 5 6) of the control group.

            "text": "Research into the pathogenesis of asthma in recent years has led to the discovery of a number of novel, potentially important targets for the development of new treatment options. Much of this research has focused on T H 2 lymphocyte-driven processes underlying allergic asthma and its characteristic eosinophilic airway inflammation. Abundant information supporting this research has been derived from bronchial biopsy and bronchoalveolar lavage studies largely carried out in a young adult population. It is recognized, however, that the role of allergy and allergic triggers in asthma diminishes with age. 69, 234 In addition, LOA is often less reversible, more severe, and frequently occurs in response to a viral respiratory tract infection. 153 A distinct asthma phenotype characterized by normal airway eosinophil numbers has been described. 235 Moreover, normal airway eosinophilia might also be associated with abnormal sputum neutrophilia. 236, 237 Recent studies have shown that neutrophilic asthma might be associated with activation of innate immune pathways in contrast to the adaptive immune response associated with T H 2-mediated allergic asthma. 238 Thus alternative immune pathways involving natural killer T or T H 17 lymphocyte subtypes have been hypothesized as being potentially important in the pathogenesis of asthma, particularly in adult-onset asthma. 239, 240 Just as the discovery of T H 2-related pathways has led to important leads in drug discovery for allergic asthma, further clinical research into these alternative pathways should be carried out with the goal of identifying new and exciting targets for future drug discovery. This research should focus not only on the discovery of new molecular targets but also on the identification of noninvasive biomarkers that will help predict the success of any new therapy in an individual patient.",
