Emergence of multidrug-resistant bacteria has increased the proportion of refractory infections and the challenges of infection control.2, 3, 4 China has reinforced legislation to control nosocomial infection, drawing extensive support from society and medical community.5 This transition is reflected in the Chinese governmental response to the epidemic of Middle East respiratory syndrome.",

Investigations indicated that this aggressive, multisource, and nosocomial hepatitis C virus infection resulted from repeated syringe use among different patients.6 In July 2011, 15 cataract patients undergoing surgical treatment at an Ophthalmic Hospital in the Raodu district, Linfen, suffered from endophthalmitis. Investigation showed that patients were infected with Pseudomonas aeruginosa endophthalmitis, which resulted from a shortage of surgical equipment and nonstandard disinfection of the surgical instruments.7 In March 2009, incidence of neonatal nosocomial infection was reported in a maternal and child care service center in the Ji County of Tianjin. In a neonatal ward, 5 of the total 6 newborns were dead. Investigations revealed a severe nosocomial infection resulting in deaths attributed to negligence by staff with poor infection prevention and control standards.8\n",

However, the Chinese health care system is riddled with long wait lists, shortages, and poor equipment because of funding constraints. The national medical system is not hierarchical in structure.

Failure to comply with standard regulations of hand hygiene or even handwashing after examining patients with infections, lack of standardized or complete disinfection of surgical instruments, failure to implement surgical standards, failure to consider oxygen humidifiers as an important source of lower respiratory infection, and inappropriate measures of disinfection and isolation are some of the factors that artificially increase nosocomial infection.",

Public hospitals should be transformed into not-for-profit organizations in the national health care system.\u2022To disseminate the knowledge of nosocomial infection, the government and health workers should popularize and publicize new techniques and know-hows for infection prevention and control.\u2022To improve environmental hygiene, a national system of sanitation should be created to provide population access to adequate sanitation measures given the current unsanitary conditions in hospitals\u2022To emphasize appropriate hospital layout, a well-developed, scientifically planned hospital infrastructure is essential to ensure sustainable care and development and nosocomial infection management. The government and the director of the hospital should emphasize the role of rational design of the wards and hospital layout and balance the costs and benefits in prevention of infection.\u2022The hospital information system (HIS) enables the control of infection by regulating all of the operational aspects, such as medical, administrative, financial, and legal issues and the corresponding services. The HIS is the essential technologic backup of the environment and infrastructure in a modernized hospital system. Information sources related to nosocomial infection may be enriched using the HIS and enhance the ability of health care professionals. The HIS facilitates organizations in nosocomial infection management, official documentation, and ensures data security.\u2022Evidence-based medicine (EBM) is intended to optimize decision-making by emphasizing the use of evidence from well-designed research studies. According to the theory of EBM, the strongest evidence based on meta-analyses, systematic reviews, and randomized controlled trials yields strong recommendations. Combined with the data of epidemiologic survey and analysis, EBM may provide useful strategies to improve nosocomial infection management. However, the inadequacy of clinical application of EBM in nosocomial infection management in China needs to be addressed.\u2022A no-pay policy by the government and medical insurance organizations must be implemented rigorously for items of nosocomial infection that are not covered by medical insurance. This policy will encourage awareness of prevention and control measures that reduce the incidence of hospital infection.\n",

During the early period of the severe acute respiratory syndrome epidemic in 2002, the nosocomial infection rate of medical staff reportedly exceeded 10% because of inadequate disease knowledge. However, this rate does not represent all the data because there were several hospitals or wards with a zero infection rate among the medical staff during the outbreak. The discrepancy is associated with different attitudes toward infection. Overall, nosocomial infection management in China and worldwide has a long way to go.",
