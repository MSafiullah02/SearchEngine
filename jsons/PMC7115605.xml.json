            "text": "The causative agent of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) has been identified as a new type of corona virus, SARS corona virus (SARS CoV) [1], [2], [3]. SARS has infected more than 8400 patients in about 7 months in over 30 countries and caused more than 800 deaths. The deadly epidemic has had significant impacts on many health, social, economic and political aspects. SARS is assumed to resurge in the near future. However, no SARS vaccine is currently available for clinical use. Therefore, we have developed novel vaccine candidates against SARS CoV using cDNA constructs encoding the structural antigens; S, M, E, or N protein. In immunized mice, neutralizing antibodies against the virus and T cell immunity against virus-infected-cells were studied, since these immunities play important roles in protection against many virus infections. In particular, CD8+ CTL plays an important role in T cell immunity dependent protection against virus infections and the eradication of murine and human cancers [4], [5]. In the present study, a type II alveolar epithelial cell clone, T7, was used for analyzing precise mechanism of CTL against SARS CoV membrane antigens, as the SARS-CoV infects alveolar epithelial cell in the lungs [6]. Furthermore, the SCID-PBL/hu model, which is capable of analyzing in vivo human immune response, was also used because it is a more relevant translational model for human cases [4].",

Neutralizing antibodies against SARS CoV in the serum from the mice immunized with SARS S, M, N or -E DNA vaccines were assayed by use of Vero-E6 cell. CTL activity against SARS CoV was studied using human type II alveolar epithelial cells, T7, expressing SARS antigens [6]. PBL from healthy human volunteers were administered i.p. into IL-2 receptor \u03b3-chain disrupted NOD SCID mice [IL-2R(\u2212/\u2212) NOD-SCID], and SCID-PBL/hu mice were constructed [4]. SARS DNA vaccines at 50 \u03bcg were injected i.m. into the SCID-PBL/hu mice. CTL activity of human CD8-positive lymphocytes in the spleen from SCID-PBL/hu was assessed using IFN-\u03b3 production and 51Cr-release assay [4], [5].",

These DNA vaccines induced SARS-CoV-specific CTL and T cell proliferation in vivo human immune systems using SCID-PBL/hu. Gao et al. developed adenovirus based a SARS DNA vaccine encoding S1 polypeptide was capable of inducing neutralizing antibody, while another SARS DNA vaccine encoding N protein generated IFN-\u03b3 producing T cells in rhesus monkeys [7]. SARS S DNA vaccine which elicits effective neutralizing antibody responses that generate protective immunity in a mouse model [8]. However its immunogenicity in humans has yet to be established. Therefore, it is very important to evaluate the efficacy of SARS DNA vaccine in a SCID-PBL/hu mice, which is a highly relevant translational model for demonstrating human immune responsiveness. Recently, SARS DNA vaccines capable of inducing human neutralizing antibodies against SARS CoV have been established by our SCID-PBL/hu model. It has been demonstrated that Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) is a functional receptor for the SARS CoV [9]. A transgenic mouse with human ACE-2 may be useful as an animal model of SARS. Furthermore, ACE-2 transgenic SCID mice should be useful as a human model for pre-clinical trial for SARS vaccines, since ACE-transgenic SCID-PBL/hu model could analyze the human immune responses against SARS infection in vivo. The effect of combination immunization with such SARS vaccines and neutralizing antibody dependent DNA vaccine is now being studied. These DNA vaccines should provide a useful tool for development of protective vaccines.",
