The association between upper respiratory viral infections and asthma exacerbations in children was demonstrated almost three decades ago using virus cultures and serological techniques [5]. These findings were subsequently confirmed and expanded using more sensitive techniques for virus detection, such as reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT\u2013PCR) assays in well-designed longitudinal studies [6], [7], [8], [9]. After implementation of these techniques more than 80% of reported episodes of wheeze or drop in lung function could be attributed to respiratory viral infections [7], rhinovirus (RV) being the most prevalent virus. Similar studies in adults implicate respiratory pathogens in almost half of the exacerbations, rhinovirus being once again the prevailing virus [8], [10], [11].",

The age of the subjects is important [24], since, overall, the frequency of viral respiratory illness is highest in children up to 4 years of age, gradually declines in teenagers, rises again in young parents exposed to children, re-declines in older adults, while the elderly are again more susceptible [25]. In addition respiratory viral infections have strong seasonal patterns although sporadic cases or nosocomial outbreaks can occur [6], [26], [27], [28], [29], [30]. The presence or absence of a lipid-containing envelope affects viral survival in the environment [31], [32]. In temperate areas, the enveloped viruses, (e.g. influenza virus, RSV and coronavirus), are, characteristically, prevalent during middle-winter periods, whereas non-enveloped ones, such as RVs, are found most often in spring and fall. RV characteristically produces epidemics soon after children return to school. September epidemics of asthma exacerbations coincide with such increase in the rate of respiratory track infections [28], [29]. There is evidence that different infectious agents may induced asthma exacerbations of varying severity, however, stronger evidence is needed in this respect [6], [33], [34], [35]. Finally, the type of diagnostic test used to identify infection may considerably affect epidemiological results [7], [36].",

Major RVs attach to the intracellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1) while minor group RV binds the low-density lipoprotein receptor. In vitro and in vivo, RV infects the bronchial epithelium and upregulates a range of pro-inflammatory cytokines, chemokines, adhesion molecules, mucins and growth factors, all of which are thought to contribute to lower airway inflammation and consequent effects on lung function [38], [39].

Virus-mediated damage to the epithelial layer can expose the dense subepithelial nerve endings, increasing stimulation of sensory nerves by inhaled particles or pro-inflammatory mediators. Sensory nerves can directly release neuropeptides which may trigger reflex bronchoconstriction. Among the mediators of neurogenic inflammation, nerve growth factor (NGF) may have an important role in the pathogenesis of hyper-responsiveness induced by respiratory viruses. It has been documented that NGF induces a selective up-regulation of the high-affinity neurokinin 1 receptor (NK1) for the tachykinin substance P (SP) [55]. SP is a neuropeptide released from sensory nerves with both bronchoconstrictive effects and immunomodulatory properties which regulates the functions of all white blood cells by affecting their migration and response to various mitogens and allergens [56]. One recent study [57] focused on neural development in the lungs during early life and has proposed that this process is under the control of NGF and its corresponding receptor TrkA. These factors control the branching of nerves into the developing lungs and are downregulated with age. NGF is strongly upregulated during RSV infections, especially in infants and such overexpression may result in prolonged viral clearance from the infected epithelial cells.",

An association between upper respiratory tract infection and air pollution, especially NO2, and tobacco smoke exposure, has been observed in children [64], [65], [66]. There are several potential mechanisms by which pollutants can exacerbate asthma interacting with respiratory viral infections. Direct effects of the pollutant on the airways include epithelial damage and an acquired ciliary dyskinesia; release of pro-inflammatory mediators and increases in IgE concentration may follow. Indirectly NO2 can also impair local antiviral immunity in the airways [67], [68], [69].",

It has recently been proposed that C. pneumoniae might modulate epithelial cell apoptosis by upregulating both pro-apoptosis and anti-apoptosis genes. It has been suggested that C. pneumoniae-induced inhibition of apoptosis increases the longevity of the host cell, enhancing the survival of C. pneumoniae in patients with chronic asthma [79]. Consequently, bronchial infection with atypical bacteria is likely to be associated with increased airway inflammation and thus possibly increasing asthma severity and airway remodelling. Although, these organisms are common causes of infection, not all infected patients develop or exacerbate their asthma. This suggests that certain individuals may be genetically predisposed to the chronic effects of atypical bacteria, or be genetically susceptible to infection [52], rendering them more likely to be persistently infected. Only a few studies have investigated the possibility of such susceptibility. In one of them [80], isotype-specific serologic tests have been performed for C. pneumoniae, and the results have been compared with variations in mannose-binding lectin (MBL), a complement component that is important in clearance of respiratory pathogens. The presence of variant alleles in MBL was associated with increased susceptibility to other types of respiratory infections, significantly increasing the risk of asthma development among children infected with C. pneumoniae. On the other hand, a recent study, detailed below, showed improved outcomes when a ketolide was used in patients with asthma exacerbations [81].",

The efficacy of these vaccines is approximately 70\u201390% in young adults, especially when the vaccine antigen and the circulating strain are closely matched.

Type I IFNs include the numerous IFN-\u03b1s, IFN-\u03b2 and the newly identified IFN-\u03bbs [96]. In the past, IFN-\u03b12 was shown to be effective when given prior to experimental RV infection [97], [98], [99], or as a prophylactic therapy [100], [101], in a context of natural RV infections, however cost and side-effects have prevented its exploitation in the common cold and/or asthma exacerbation fields. IFN-\u03b2 has not been very effective in preventing experimental or natural RV colds [52], [102], [103], [104], but its effects on asthma exacerbations have not been investigated. Promising data have been recently published about IFN-\u03bbs [105]. It should be noted that in addition to the antiviral approach, combinations of IFN-\u03b1 with intranasal ipratropium, or oral naproxen, or chlorpheniramine, or ibuprofen have been tested with promising results, but these were also not commercialized [106], [107].",

A synergistic effect of GCs with long-acting \u03b22 agonists (LABA) has been shown both in in vitro studies and clinically. LABAs act via a G protein coupled receptor, activate adenylate cyclase and through the second messenger cAMP, induce intracellular signalling events affecting a broad range of physiological processes, providing by this way an extra potentiality to enhance the anti-inflammatory properties of GCs when acting together in a combination therapy [113]. Studies have confirmed clinical benefit in exacerbations, although the viral origin of these events has not been confirmed [114], [115].",

The study design did not incorporate an analysis of the mechanism by which telithromycin was associated with improvement, but the data imply a benefit not solely attributable to an antimicrobial effect.

Certainly, a combination of the antimicrobial with anti-inflammatory approaches seems reasonable. There is evidence suggesting that a window of opportunity exists between appearance of a viral infection and the initiation of an exacerbation [131]. On the other hand, more controlled studies with macrolides, especially in children, are urgently needed as management of exacerbations is an important unmet need in this age group.",
