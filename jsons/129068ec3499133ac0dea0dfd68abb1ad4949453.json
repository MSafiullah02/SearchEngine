Under in vitro conditions, neuronal cells could be a useful tool to study the CHPV interaction with neuronal proteins. The information gathered from such studies will help to design the new therapeutics for CHPV infection. This study identified the surface vimentin protein involved in adsorption of CHPV on Neuro-2a cell line (mouse neuroblastoma cells). The decrease in CHPV infectivity to Neuro-2a cells was observed in the presence of recombinant vimentin or anti-vimentin antibody. Vimentin mRNA expression remains unaltered in CHPV infected Neuro-2a cells. Furthermore, in silico analysis predicted the residues in vimentin and CHPV glycoprotein (G); probably involved in cell-virus interactions. Overall, we conclude that surface vimentin in Neuro-2a cells interact with CHPV and facilitate the binding of CHPV to the cells; it could be acting as a coreceptor for the CHPV. Further investigation is necessary to confirm the exact role of vimentin in CHPV infection in neuronal cells.",

For many viruses, little information is available regarding the virus-host interaction. Adsorption of the virus on to the host cells is a highly specific course of action. Some viruses need single specific receptor while others need more than one receptor or co-factors for entry into host cells (Bielefeldt-Ohmann et al., 2001) . Enveloped viruses attach to cells by binding of their surface membrane protein to a specific cell receptor. Various components of the host cell membrane can act as virus receptors like CD4 molecules for Human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (Sattentau et al., 1988) , \u03b1-Dystroglycan for Lyssa Fever virus (Cao et al., 1998) or intercellular adhesion molecule-1(ICAM-1) for Rhinovirus (Greve et al., 1989) . To date, no-host cell receptors have been reported for Chandipura virus (CHPV).",

Plaque assay analysis showed approximately 46 % and 68 % reduction in plaques in 100-fold and 50-fold dilution of antivimentin antibody-treated cells respectively as compared with plaques in the rabbit immunoglobulin treated cells.

The plaque assay analysis revealed approximately 25% and 48% reduction in plaques in the blocking experiment with 15 \u00b5g/ml and 30 \u00b5g/ml of recombinant vimentin protein respectively as compared to the BSA -virus complex infected cells (Fig.   5 ).

In the current study, the amino acid residues of vimentin involved in the in-silico interaction belongs to the rod domain of vimentin. This finding indicates that the interaction was specific, and hence suggests the possibility for surface vimentin to interact with CHPV G protein on cell surface.

In the first experiment, the Neuro-2a cells were treated with 50 fold and 100 fold dilutions of vimentin (D21H3) rabbit mAb for 1 hr at 4 \u00b0C with intermittent shaking. The control well was treated with rabbit immunoglobulin. After incubation, cells were infected with CHPV (MOI=1) in the presence of antibody for 1 hr at 37 \u00b0C. Cells were washed with PBS and further incubated for 12 hr in 2X DMEM supplemented with 2% FBS and 2% Corboxymethyl cellulose (CMC). Culture supernatant was collected for plaque assay to calculate the viral progeny yield. In another experiment, the vimentin receptor in the virus was blocked by treating the virus with the recombinant vimentin protein. The His-tagged vimentin protein was cloned, expressed and purified in our laboratory. The PEG precipitated CHPV (50 \u00b5g) was pre-incubated with 15 \u00b5g/ml and 30 \u00b5g/ml purified vimentin protein at 4 \u00b0C for 1 hr. The virus treated with BSA was used as a negative control. Neuro-2a cells were then infected with the virus-protein complex for 1 hr at 37 \u00b0C. After virus infection, cells were washed with PBS to remove unbound virus and further incubated for another 12 hr in 2X DMEM supplemented with 2% FBS and 2% CMC. The culture supernatant was collected for plaque assay. The percent reduction in plaque was calculated by the following formula,",

            "text": "members of the Family Rhabdoviridae are known for causing infections in a wide range of organisms (plants, insects, animals, and humans). This family includes viruses like VSV known for causing infections in livestock, and human pathogens like RV and CHPV. Despite the importance of CHPV in Public health, there is no experimental evidence available for explaining the mechanism of entry of CHPV in susceptible cells.Rhabdovirus uses many receptors to bind the cells. The viral G protein is involved in virus attachment to host cell receptors and plays a critical role in the initial steps of virus infection. In the case of VSV, the involvement of phosphatidylserine(Schlegel et al., 1983) and LDL receptors(Finkelshtein et al., 2013) were reported in an attachment to permissive cells. But, the involvement of phosphatidylserine in VSV attachment is a topic of debate(Coil and Miller, 2004). In the case of RV, several molecules like Low-affinity nerve growth factor receptor (P75NTR)(Tuffereau et al. 1998), Neuronal cell adhesion molecule (Thoulouze et al., 1998), Nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (Gastka et al., 1996) were proposed as virus receptors. These studies indicate that several molecules may be taking part in the process of virus binding and entry into the susceptible host cell. In the current study, we confirmed the interaction of CHPV with vimentin on the Neuro-2a cell surface during virus adsorption. Vimentin is known to be involved in the various cellular processes like cell adhesion, organelle movements within the cells, cell signaling, and maintenance of cytoskeletal interactions (Nieminen et al., 2006). It is mainly a cytoplasmic protein intensely found around the cell membrane. Vimentin along with other cytoskeletal proteins are involved in the trafficking of many viruses within the cells. Several viruses require vimentin assistance in completing their life cycle. Human cytomegalovirus needs vimentin for completion of replication in fibroblasts (Miller and Hertel, 2009) and African swine fever virus needs vimentin rearrangements for viral assembly (Stefanovic et al., 2005). Cell surface-expressed vimentin has been reported at different developmental stages of astrocytes, fibroblast and fibroblast-like cells in mouse brain tissue and primary cell culture (Schnitzer et al., 1981). The mass spectrometry analysis of the 55 kDa CHPV reactive band visualized in VOPBA identified multiple proteins in this particular study. The presence of multiple proteins in MASCOT search after LC/MS analysis indicated several possibilities including ATP synthase \u03b1 and \u03b2 subunit, \u03b1 actin, \u03b2 actin and vimentin. However, we have selected vimentin among the other proteins identified because the involvement of cell surface vimentin as receptor in virus binding has been reported in Japanese encephalitis virus (Jian-Jong et al., 2011), study, it was proved that vimentin mediated signaling was required for lba+ E. coli K1 cells to enter into human brain microvascular endothelial cells (Chi et al., 2010). These findings support the involvement of vimentin in neuronal invasion by other pathogens. Therefore, the interaction of CHPV G protein with superficial vimentin may be the possible hypothesis to explain the neuroinvasiveness and neurotropic behavior of CHPV. In the present study, immunofluorescence staining showed the co-localization of CHPV with vimentin on the Neuro-2a cell surface. Thus, the involvement of surface vimentin in CHPV pathogenesis must not be underestimated. This study also confirmed that CHPV infection did not influence the vimentin mRNA expression in the infected cells. According to Bin et al., (2004), surface vimentin is not originated from the cell-specific mRNA but is the outcome of post-translational modification of existing vimentin mRNA (Bin et al., 2004). So, the presence of an alternative form of vimentin on the cell surface is an interesting phenomenon and needs to be thoroughly investigated. We also observed the CHPV multiplication in Neuro-2a cells despite the treatment of cells with increasing concentration of anti-vimentin antibody and treatment of CHPV with recombinant vimentin protein before infection. These observations suggest that the surface vimentin helps in the initial stage of virus binding and additional protein molecules are involved in the process of CHPV entry into neuronal cells. The current in silico study proposed the involvement of hydrogen bonding interactions between the residues of mouse vimentin and CHPV G protein. Structurally, the vimentin monomer consists of the head domain (amino acids 1-10), central rod domain (amino acids 102-410) and tail domain (amino acids 411-466).",
