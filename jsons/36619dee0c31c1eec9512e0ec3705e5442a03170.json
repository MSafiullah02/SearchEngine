The molecular determinants and the mechanism that link SARS coronavirus infection to the pulmonary pathology are unknown. The scientific-clinical picture is further complicated by the fact that, while human SARS CoVs presents heavy pathogenicity leading to death [1], other human CoVs, such as HCoV-OC43 and HCoV-229E, are less pathogenic and cause common colds and mild lower respiratory tract infections [2].", "cite_spans": [{"start": 216, "end": 219, "text": "[1]", "ref_id": "BIBREF0"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Abstract"}, {"text": "Here, we explore the issue based on the rationale that, following a pathogen infection, peptide commonalities between the pathogen and the human proteins might trigger cross-reactions and a pathologic autoimmune sequela that might contribute to explain the pathogen associated diseases [3] .

Excessively high values of surface tension would lead to alveolar collapse thus making ventilation and gas exchange impossible. Surfactant is produced by alveolar type II cells, secreted into the alveolar space, and it consists of lipids and proteins. The phospholipid component (dipalmitoylphosphatidylcholine, DPPC) reduces the surface tension, and the protein component -surfactant protein A (SP-A), surfactant protein B (SP-B), and surfactant protein C (SP-C) -together with a network of additional proteins regulate surfactant homeostasis and metabolism and, importantly, contribute to maintain immunological homeostasis in the lung, attenuating both infection and inflammation [4] .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 854, "end": 857, "text": "[4]", "ref_id": "BIBREF3"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": ""}, {"text": "For the present study, pentapeptides were used as sequence probes since a peptide grouping formed by five amino acid (aa) residues is an immune molecular determinant that 1) can induce highly specific antibodies, and 2) determines antigen-antibody specific interaction [5] . Peptide sharing between spike glycoproteins and human surfactant-related proteins was analysed as extensively described in previous publications [3 and refs. therein] . In brief. Spike glycoprotein primary sequences were dissected into pentapeptides offset by one residue and each viral pentapeptide was analyzed for matches within human proteins that had been retrieved from UniProtKB database (http://www.uniprot.org/) [6] using 'surfactant' as keyword. Next, the shared pentaptides were analyzed for presence in spike glycoproteins-derived immunoreactive epitopes by using the IEDB Immune Epitope DataBase (IEDB) [7] to analyze the immunological potential of the peptide sharing. The final results are reported in Tables 1 and S1 and show that -quantitatively the peptide sharing of the two coronaviruses is similar, and both HCoV-229E and SARS-CoV-2 share many pentapeptides (19 and 24, respectively) with surfactant and related proteins, -the peptide sharing between coronaviruses and surfactant-related proteins appears to be specific since none of the 43 shared pentapeptides described in Table 1 was found in infectious pathogens that do not cause lung disease such as rabies virus, rubella virus, hepatitis C virus, and human parvovirus B19. A paradigmatic control is parvovirus B19 that is transmitted through exposure to infected respiratory droplets, exhibits mild cold-like symptoms that are never linked to the virus [8] , and associates with a wide spectrum of diseasesfrom erythema infectiosum and arthropathy to encephalopathy and autoimmune hepatitisthat does not include lung disorders [9] . -the peptide sharing described in Table 1 is also coronavirus-specific since not a single pentapeptide shared with surfactant and related proteins is common to the two coronaviruses, -immunologically, the human vs SARS-CoV-2 peptide sharing is of high relevance with 13 out of the 24 shared pentapeptides to be found in 52 SARS-CoV-derived immunoreactive epitopes (Tables 1 J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f Journal Pre-proof and S1).

This letter addresses the issue of why SARS-CoV-2 attacks the respiratory system and reports on a vast peptide sharing between SARS-CoV-2 spike glycoprotein and surfactant-related proteins. Analyses using the Immune Epitope DataBase (IEDB) resource also show that many of the shared peptides are endowed with immunological potential. Given the caveat that the positive correlation of the pentapeptide sharing shown in Table 1 needs to be controlled by experimental serologic analyses, results suggest that immune responses following SARS-CoV-2 infection might lead to crossreactions with pulmonary surfactant and related proteins, and might contribute to the SARS-CoV-2-associated lung diseases. The data warn against using vaccines based on entire SARS-CoV-2 antigens to fight SARS-CoV infections, and highlight peptide uniqueness as a molecular concept for effective anti-CoV immunotherapy.
