These include SARS-CoV-2 test availability and accuracy, the decision of healthcare authorities not to screen for infection certain groups (which could lead to underestimation of the pandemic burden), heterogeneous reporting across countries, as well as the fact that estimates of the exact incidence of specific COVID-19 complications and prevalence of baseline comorbidities are often being carried out in a suboptimal fashion (e.g., small single-center cohorts, isolated reports on social media, etc). For all these limitations, a high degree of caution and criticism should be adopted to identify selective reporting and biased data, and when drawing conclusions based on small case series or anecdotal case reports.",

Patients requiring ICU admission have higher serum levels of granulocyte colony-stimulating factor, granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor, interferon-inducible protein-10, monocyte chemoattractant protein-1, macrophage inflammatory protein-1A, and tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-\u03b1 [6], further suggesting that the \"intensity\" of the \u201ccytokine storm\u201d modulates the severity of the disease.

Patients with pre-existing cardiovascular disease, receiving ARB or ACEI have an upregulation of ACE2, which would be therefore available in great amounts to offer a binding site for SARS-CoV-2[3,4,24]. However, this concern, derived from in-vitro and animal studies, has not found confirmation in clinical practice[24]. Indeed, in a large multinational cohort of 8,910 COVID-19 patients, Mehra et al.[25] did not observe an increase in the risk of in-hospital death associated with the use of ACEI (2.1% vs. 6.1%; odds ratio 0.33, 95% confidence interval 0.20-0.54) or ARB (6.8% vs. 5.7%; odds ratio 1.23, 95% confidence interval 0.87-1.74). Similarly, in a large population-based study from Northern Italy, the use of ACEI and ARB was more frequent among patients with Covid-19 than among controls because of their higher prevalence of cardiovascular disease. However, there was no evidence that such drugs affected the risk of COVID-19. [26]. Furthermore, Reynolds et al.[27] found no substantial increase in the likelihood of a positive test for COVID-19 or in the risk of severe COVID-19 presentations in association with five common classes of antihypertensive drugs (ACEI, ARB, beta-blockers, calcium-channel blockers and thiazide diuretics). Therefore, given the balance of pros and cons of withholding such drugs, professional societies have warned against discontinuation of ACEIs and ARBs, as it could paradoxically lead to increased mortality related to the exacerbation of cardiovascular and renal conditions[4,24].",

Although the clinical picture is still referred to as a \"myocarditis\" in many instances, myocardial infection by SARS-CoV-2 was not proven in most cases with COVID-19 myocardial involvement. To date, only isolated case reports provided data on the pathology of the myocardial tissue from COVID-19 patients, which preclude drawing definitive conclusions on this topic[32,33]. Sala et al.[32] reported on a 43-year-old woman with COVID-19 who presented with a reverse Tako-Tsubo syndrome and mild left ventricular systolic dysfunction. Cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR) revealed diffuse myocardial edema on the basal and mid left ventricular segments, with no detectable scar. Endomyocardial biopsy documented diffuse T-lymphocytic inflammatory infiltrates and huge interstitial edema without any other substantial damage. Molecular analysis showed absence of the SARS-CoV-2 genome within the myocardium[32]. Tavazzi et al.[33] described for the first time a biopsy-proven myocardial localization of viral particles in a COVID-19 patient presenting with cardiogenic shock. Although the clinical presentation suggested severe and necrotizing acute myocarditis, the pathology report demonstrated only low-grade myocardial inflammation and absence of myocyte necrosis[33]. Importantly, SARS-CoV-2 was only demonstrated in interstitial cytopathic macrophages and their surroundings, while no viral particle was found in cardiac myocytes, which showed non-specific damage (mainly focal myofibrillar lysis)[33]. Either transient viremia or infected macrophage migration from the lung might occur in COVID\u201019 patients with non\u2010acute myocardial involvement. The available data seem to rule out a classic myocarditis presentation (i.e., direct infection of myocardial cells by the virus), while they suggest that myocardial involvement in COVID-19 might rather be due to the cytokine release syndrome.",

Initial data in the setting of ARDS due to COVID-19 showed that the prognosis remain poor even with ECMO use (mortality rate 82.3%)[49]. In 12 critically ill COVID-19 patients requiring ECMO, Zeng et al.[50] found that nearly half of them died from septic shock and multiorgan failure. ECMO support duration ranged from 3 to 28 days[50]. A pooled analysis of early reports including 234 ARDS patients, revealed that only 17 (7.2%) received ECMO[51]. The mortality rate was 94.1% in ECMO patients and 70.9% in conventional therapy patients[51]. The pooled effect of ECMO versus conventional therapy on mortality was neutral (OR: 2.00, 95%CI: 0.49\u20138.16)[51]. The Extracorporeal Life Support Organization (ELSO) recommends ECMO use only in expert centers in patients with severe ARDS (PaO2/FiO2<100) after collegial discussion on a case-by-case basis[52]. ECMO can be considered futile and the patient can be returned to conventional management if no lung or cardiac recovery are observed after 21 days[52].",

Three patients had multiterritory infarcts, two had concurrent VTE, and in two ischemic strokes occurred despite therapeutic anticoagulation[60]. Similarly, Oxley et al.[61] reported on five young COVID-19 patients (age from 33 to 49 years) who presented with large-vessel ischemic stroke. Such an association between large-vessel stroke and COVID-19 in young patients requires further investigation. Therapeutic anticoagulation and thrombolysis could be beneficial to mitigate the consequences of stroke in this setting, but must be balanced against the risk of hemorrhagic transformation, particularly considering the critical conditions of these patients and the delays in diagnosis due to sedation and other concomitant acute issues.",

The Canadian Association of Interventional Cardiology instead recommends primary PCI in low COVID-19 probability in the absence of major logistic restrictions, while fibrinolysis could be considered in moderate/high probability or COVID-19 positive STEMI patients, particularly in the presence of staff/resource limitations[65]. PCI in catheterization laboratories with aerosol-level PPE should also be considered in case of fibrinolysis contraindication or failure or in cases with cardiogenic shock due to ACS[65]. Even in case of successful initial fibrinolysis, planned PCI should be performed within 24 hours[65].",

Emergency medical services from Hong Kong reported a mean increase of \u223c4 hours in time from symptom onset to first medical contact for STEMI patients[7], presumably because of patient hesitancy in seeking care due to concerns about possible in-hospital COVID-19 contagion. Such delays might have a detrimental impact on prognosis[71]. Previously uncommon mechanical complications of myocardial infarction are now being frequently observed, which could be again due to delays in seeking care[71]. Even more worrisome is the 58% increase in out-of-hospital cardiac arrest observed by Italian investigators during the pandemic, which could reflect the extreme consequences of such medical care avoidance behavior[43]. Finally, further in-hospital delays can be expected among patients admitted to the hospital, which are related to COVID-19 infection testing and implementation of precautions for healthcare providers[7].",

COVID-19 has profoundly reshaped usual pathways of care of both elective and acute cardiac patients. Further research is needed to precisely define the pathophysiology of COVID-19 and to identify and properly evaluate drugs targeting the most relevant mechanisms that characterize severe manifestations of the disease.
