            "text": "Metapneumoviruses have recently been classified in the new family Pneumoviridae, genus Metapneumovirus (MPV) (Afonso et al., 2016) where they are subdivided into avian and human strains. In both species these viruses cause important respiratory diseases (Cook, 2000, Gough et al., 1988, Picault et al., 1987, Toquin et al., 1999, van den Hoogen et al., 2001, Williams et al., 2004). Respiratory disease retrospectively reported to be caused by avian metapneumovirus (AMPV) was first described in turkeys in South Africa in the late 1970s, then shortly after in Europe (France and UK) in the early 1980s. Today AMPV has been detected in most regions of the world with the exception of Australasia (Jones and Rautenschlein, 2013). Human metapneumoviruses (HMPV) were first detected in the Netherlands in 2001 but were shown to have been circulating since the 1950\u2032s (van den Hoogen et al., 2001). They also have been detected worldwide as a major cause of bronchiolitis and respiratory infections in infants, the elderly, or immunocompromised adults (Falsey et al., 2003, van den Hoogen et al., 2001).",

As a result, MPV infection is best detected routinely using either serological, molecular PCR tests or a combination of the two, and which method should be used is often decided according to the sample timing. For example, tests such as the enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) or virus neutralization assay (Eterradossi et al., 1992, van den Hoogen et al., 2004, Wyeth et al., 1987) that detect antibodies elicited by MPV infection are used in cases where infection was suspected and sampling was performed long after the virus had been cleared. However, molecular PCR tests are favoured when samples such as respiratory or oro-pharyngeal swabs have been collected during the infectious period, as molecular assays are generally more sensitive and allow sequence-based sub-grouping of the viral RNA.",

To develop such a broad-spectrum test, a highly conserved region in the genome of AMPV and HMPV, such as that within the HMPV N gene used for detecting the four HMPV sub-lineages (Maertzdorf et al., 2004), or the Nd/Nx primers described for pan AMPV detection of AMPV (Bayon-Auboyer et al., 1999), needed to be identified.",

For this reason it may be clearer to consider AMPV A, B and D as type I metapneumoviruses and AMPV C and HMPV as type II as has been previously suggested (Brown et al., 2014). The molecular relationships between HMPV and AMPV-C have led to the hypothesis that these viruses could be have been generated by a crossing of the species barrier (de Graaf et al., 2008). The possibility of MPVs crossing the species barrier to a different animal host species prompted the search for regions of sequence sufficiently conserved across all members of the genus Metapneumovirus for the development of the panMPV real time RT-PCR discussed in this paper. Regions that had been targeted previously for these types of test resided in N ORF (Bayon-Auboyer et al., 1999, Maertzdorf et al., 2004, Toquin et al., 1999) due to its high nucleotide conservation and its proximal 3\u2019position in the viral genome. Genes closer to the 3\u2019end of MPVs, like other viruses in the order Mononegavirales, are reported to be in greater abundance in infected cells due to their transcription strategy and thus, this increases the chances of detecting viral RNA molecules (Collins and Karron, 2013).",

However a mixture of three primers (two in the forward sense and one reverse) was required to obtain balanced results across the four AMPV subgroups. SYBR Green I technology was chosen over a TaqMan approach because the latter technology required three zones of conserved sequence: one for each of the primers plus another inside the region amplified for the fluorescent probe. Such a region of sequence was not found in the MPV genome. In addition amplification of DNA molecules using an intercalating dye such as SYBR Green I is measured not only in terms of Ct values but also by exploiting the melting curve values assessed at the end of the amplification process. Therefore, the peak location on a melting curve depends on the sequence, GC/AT ratio and the length of the resulting amplicon (Ririe et al., 1997). In some cases the Tm values are statistically different and can be used to identify separate subgroups even in a PCR specifically designed to be \u201cbroad range\u201d. In the current study, it was not possible to use the Tm values to differentiate between virus species or among AMPV or HMPV subgroups.",

Further experiments are ongoing to check whether other Orthopneumoviruses could also be detected. Regarding the sensitivity, later responses were observed (Ct = 32.4 and 33.3) for the HMPV B sub-lineages when compared to the results obtained for the rest of the MPVs tested. These later responses may be explained by the presence of a mismatch at the seventh nucleotide of the primer PanMPV/N1Rev from the 3\u2032 end with all HMPV B sequences. It is also possible that the HMPV B clinical samples contained more PCR inhibitors than HMPV A samples although the similar results obtained for the GAPDH house keeping gene in both A and B lineages would suggest otherwise.",

In addition these signals had a high repeatability for the four AMPV subgroups within the concentration ranges tested (107 to 101, 107 to 102, 106 to 101 and 108 to 103 for AMPV A, B, C and D respectively, Table 3a). Finally, the LoDs which ranged from 1000 to10 copies/\u03bcL demonstrate that this \u201cbroad range\u201d RT-PCR was equally sensitive in detecting all AMPVs as the qRT-PCR designed specifically for each AMPV subgroup by Guionie et al., 2007.",
