It has been widely used in treating exopathogenic wind-heat, furuncles, epidemic febrile diseases, carbuncles, sores and some infectious diseases. It is also applied to treat chronic enteritis, pneumonia, acute tonsillitis, nephritis, acute mastitis, leptospirosis in some folk prescriptions. Recent uses include the prevention and treatment of human and animal viruses, such as SARS coronavirus and swine H1N1 flu virus (Shang et al., 2011). Several pharmacological studies have shown that LJ and its active ingredients possess wide bioactivities, such as antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, antibacterial, antiviral, blood fat reducing, antipyretic and antiendotoxin (Shang et al., 2011). Therefore, in addition to its folk medicinal uses, LJ is also used in health food and cosmetics.",

Chlorogenic acid, luteolin, luteolin-7-O-glucoside and essential oils have good pharmacological effects and are believed to be the active ingredients of LJ (Ikeda et al., 1994, Wang, 2010). Different plant parts, including flowers, flower buds, leaves and whole plant, contain different ingredients and have different activities. Among them, flowers and flower buds of LJ are the most frequently used plant parts in Taiwan. However, differences in habitat, harvest time, extraction methods, and flower preparation (fresh versus dry) also cause variations in chemical compositions and the quality of LJ extract (Shang et al., 2011).",

One alternative to traditional extraction by organic solvents is supercritical fluid extraction (SFE). The most commonly used supercritical fluid is CO2 because of its favorable operating temperature and pressure for extracting thermolabile ingredients. Supercritical CO2 is also non-toxic, non-flammable, widely available, chemically inert, and has low viscosity, low surface tension, high diffusivity and favorable density (Wang, 2011, Quitain et al., 2013). Compared to conventional organic solvent extraction methods, the advantages of SFE are its non-toxicity and high separation selectivity. Especially, the CO2 gas used in SFE operation can be easily recycled to avoid the concern of greenhouse effects. Therefore, the use of SFE for extracting natural products is rapidly increasing (King, 2014, Uddin et al., 2015, Yen et al., 2015).",

The cells were cultured in Dulbecco\u2019s modified Eagle\u2019s medium (DMEM) supplemented with 10%(v/v) fetal bovine serum, 1% penicillin/streptomycin and 1.5 g/l sodium bicarbonate. The cells were cultivated in a humidified incubator at 37 \u00b0C with 5% CO2 and 95% air. The inhibitory effect of extract samples on NO production was measured using the method of Hong et al. (2014). RAW264.7 cells (4 \u00d7 105) were seeded into 100 \u03bcl DMEM medium in 96-well culture plates and incubated at 37 \u00b0C with 5% CO2 for 24 h. The cells were then incubated with 1 \u03bcl LPS (1 \u03bcg/ml) and 0.5 \u03bcl sample solution, which was the freeze-dried extract dissolved in DMSO. Following incubation for 24 h, 80 \u03bcl of the supernatant were collected for nitrite assay. The residual medium was removed, and the cell viability was evaluated using the MTT method (Hong et al., 2014). The nitrite concentration in the medium was measured as an index of NO production by using the Griess reaction. Griess reagent was freshly prepared from reagents A (1% sulfanilamide in 2.5% phosphoric acid) and B (0.1% N-1-naphthylethylenediamide dihydrochloride in water) at a ratio of 1:1. Equal volume of Griess reagent was added to the supernatants from the cells treated with the extract samples. Absorbance was measured on an ELISA reader (Model 550, Bio-Rad Laboratories, Hercules, CA, USA) at 540 nm. The NO-suppressing effect was expressed as the IC50 which denotes the concentration of extract sample causing 50% inhibition of NO production by LPS-activated RAW 264.7 cells. The L-NMMA, a clinical use iNOS inhibitor, was used as the positive control.",

Aqueous extract of LJ also attenuated trypsin-induced mast HMC-1 cell activation through inhibition of ERK phosphorylation and the inhibition of trypsin activity (Kang et al., 2004). Water extract of LJ inhibited both COX-1 and COX-2 activity, the expression of IL-1\u03b2-induced COX-2 protein and mRNA in A549 cells (Xu et al., 2007). All of these reports suggest that LJ is a good anti-inflammatory agent for treating inflammatory disorders.",

The relative effectiveness of these extracts for suppressing NO formation was SFE extracts > ethanol extracts > water extracts; and dLJ > dLJv > fLJv of ethanol extracts and water extracts. However, for the SFE extracts, the fLJv exhibited the highest activity among the three materials. The IC50 values of the fLJv extracts prepared at 150, 250 and 350 bar were 69.3 \u00b1 6.0, 71.0 \u00b1 6.8, 64.3 \u00b1 7.5 \u03bcg/ml, respectively. The IC50 values of the dLJ extracts prepared at 150, 250 and 350 bar were 184.7 \u00b1 13.1, 177.6 \u00b1 8.9, 218.9 \u00b1 18.3 \u03bcg/ml, respectively. In contrast, the IC50 values of the positive control L-NMMA was 22.4 \u00b1 2.0 \u03bcg/ml. Moreover, these extracts did not significantly retard cell growth in a 24-h treatment under a concentration below their respective NO-suppressing IC50 value. Fig. 4B shows that the fLJv SFE extract prepared at 350 bar revealed a dose-dependent inhibitory effect on NO formation of RAW264.7 cells, and this extract had no cytotoxic effects on RAW264.7 cells.",

The properties of CO2 in supercritical state resemble those of the solvent ethyl acetate. Thus, more polar impurities are eliminated by SFE than by conventional aqueous and ethanol extractions. This feature leads to the concentration of non-polar bioactive components in the SFE extracts and results in high anti-inflammatory activity. Furthermore, CO2 extraction prevents degradation of extracts because it is performed in a non-oxidizing atmosphere (Jaime et al., 2007).",

To our knowledge, this study is the first to compare the bioactivities of these two species. The antioxidant activities of dLJ extracts were superior to those of LJv extracts. In terms of anti-inflammatory activity, SFE was a good separation tool that provided excellent activities of L. japonica extracts. Since SFE concentrates non-polar bioactive components of LJ and LJv in the extraction step, it can obtain the extracts with high anti-inflammatory activity. Additionally, SFE is non-toxic, non-flammable, and easy recycle use of CO2. Therefore, using SFE to recover valuable components from L. japonica is effective and clean, and is a good alternative extraction method.",
