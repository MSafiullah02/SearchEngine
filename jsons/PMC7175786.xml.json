She presented modeling estimates showing that without mitigation, between 1.5 and 2.2 million people in the United States would die from coronavirus disease (COVID-19); however, with effective community mitigation, mortality could be reduced to between 100,000 to 200,000 deaths. These community mitigation efforts recommended by the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and described in our prior study rely exclusively on voluntary personal behaviors such as staying home, social distancing, and hand hygiene [2]. The scientific premise for that study was that, because of its widespread reach to the American (and global) population, YouTube is one of the most effective ways to communicate with the public and mobilize them to become engaged in effective community mitigation to reduce exposure to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2).",

YouTube is one of the most effective means for increasing awareness and interest in community mitigation of COVID-19 not only because of its widespread reach but also because many vulnerable people within the population may have low levels of literacy, which makes reading and deciphering behavioral recommendations described on websites difficult or impossible. Our prior studies on emerging infectious diseases such as Zika [4], Ebola [5], and other public health problems affecting population health [6-8] further demonstrate the reach of YouTube as a way to help educate people and help them make informed decisions. However, there has never been a more urgent need for such education to mobilize and engage people in communities throughout the United States and globally to understand and practice behaviors to mitigate community transmission as with the COVID-19 viral pandemic.",

Although there were no videos uploaded by entertainment television in our first sample, within 7 weeks, this source comprised the majority of videos (57%) and garnered the majority of cumulative views (>193 million). At this critical time, as all sectors of the American public work together toward the goal of community mitigation, we believe our findings indicate the potential role of entertainment television in saving lives. The implication is that in addition to holding regular press briefings covered by national news, public health officials may be able to achieve our collective goal of community mitigation by appearing on entertainment television and communicating clearly about the specific behaviors that people must practice to protect themselves, their families, and their communities, especially the many health care professionals and essential workers placing themselves at risk to care for others.",

This single recommendation can be disaggregated into 9 specific behaviors: Wash your hands (1) often (2) with soap (3) and water (4) for at least 20 seconds (5) especially after you have been in a public place (6), or after blowing your nose (7), coughing (8), or sneezing (9). In this same category of hand hygiene, additional recommendations pertain to the use of hand sanitizer containing at least 60% alcohol and covering all surfaces of hands and rubbing them together until they feel dry and to \u201cavoid touching your eyes, nose, and mouth with unwashed hands\u201d [3].
