            "text": "Temperature control is essential for an integrated PCR micro-device since performance of PCR reaction is greatly impacted by the temperature set-points and temperature ramp rates during thermal cycling.7,10 Poor temperature control can result in low PCR efficiency and non-specific probe-target DNA binding and amplification. Methods for chip-based temperature control can be classified as: contact or non-contact. In non-contact temperature control methods,26,27 heating and temperature cycling is achieved by using schemes such as: selective infrared heating,26 laser induced heating27 and thermocouple temperature sensing. Although effective, such methods often require specialized heating equipment (laser sources and other optical components) and additional temperature reference chamber (for accurate temperature measurement), which results in complicated micro-device design and relatively lower degree of integration and miniaturization. Contact temperature control methods can utilize commercial thermo-cycler, Peltier thermoelectric element designs28 to achieve nearly the same thermal conditions as in case of the conventional PCR set-up. More recently, as an alternative, commercial micro-heaters and thermocouples have been integrated with microfluidic platform to create PCR microsystems.28 Though having excellent performances, this micro-device requires manual placement/integration of commercial heaters and thermocouples, to the back side of the microfluidic chip, resulting in reproducibility problems related to their manual placement. As an alternative, micro-heaters and resistance temperature detectors (RTDs) sensors can be micro-fabricated on the same substrate, along with the microfluidic electrodes, to create a more compact PCR micro-device.23,24 These integrated thermal elements improve the overall thermal transfer from the heating element to the PCR chamber and increase the accuracy as well as the reproducibility of the required temperature. Among the contact temperature control methods, the micro-fabricated resistive heaters/RTDs have smaller power requirement, faster thermal response and higher heating ramp rates and are therefore preferred for the proposed qRT-PCR micro-device.",

For a 100% efficient micro-heater, the power requirement can be estimated as: (P = dH/dt).

Such EW droplet actuation schemes frequently make use of two patterned surfaces, separated by a gap which depends upon the size of droplets to be handled (see Figure 3a).13 In most popular EW electrode architectures, the lower substrate consists of large arrays of co-planer square or rectangular shaped electrodes, which are controlled and switched using inter-digitized, programmable input.13,14 The top surface and the gap are utilized to facilitate a larger droplet deformation, which helps to reduce the droplet actuation voltage. The two surfaces, gap, electrode geometry and dielectric insulation are key components of modern EW based DMF, which can achieve droplet dispensing, mixing/splitting and extensive droplet transport of microliter to nanoliter sample volumes.14 Single surface based EW schemes require relatively higher actuation voltages (>100 Vpp) and/or super hydrophobic surfaces, in order to induce the large contact angle change necessary for such EW droplet actuations.31 EW actuation schemes provide versatile droplet handling capabilities but are often restricted by the sequential, digital actuation, requiring active electrode switching and hence a complex electrode architecture and electrical control/switching system. Droplet transport and mixing/splitting processes are restricted by the droplet volume, viscosity, density and surface tension of the fluidic samples. EW microfluidic devices have found applications in implementing PCR based bio-assays,21 immunoassays32,33 and several other bio-combinatorial assays; however the technology still suffers from lack of parallelism, complex electrode architectures, the necessity for active switching and large electrode capacitances.",

Such DEP fluidic manipulation can be used for rapid, ultrafine droplet dispensing (Liquid-DEP (L-DEP))15,16,35 or, subsequent droplet manipulation (Droplet-DEP or, D-DEP)16,17 by energizing a pair of coplanar metal electrodes, patterned on an insulated substrate, using AC voltage. Attributes of a typical D-DEP electrode structure and the mechanism of the D-DEP droplet actuation are shown in Figure 3b. Both electrodes of the D-DEP electrode pair are shaped as interconnected, unidirectional herring-bone structures usually inclined at 45\u00b0 angle. When the electrode pair is energized by a low voltage (<100 Vpp) and frequency (30\u2013100 Hz) AC signal, it induces periodic deformations of the droplet which is placed at one end of the D-DEP electrode (see Figure 3b). The herring-bone shape ensures that the electric field induced droplet deformation is unidirectional, causing a net shift in the center of mass (CM) of the droplet. The periodic deformation and droplet oscillation frequency is twice that of the applied AC signal frequency,16,17 hence resulting in transport of the fluidic sample droplets.",

When the reaction efficiency is a maximum (E = 1), the equation reduces to: Nn = Ni (2n) and the target DNA copy count increase by 2-fold at each cycle.

            "text": "The qRT-PCR experiments reported thus far have all used 10 \u03bcL volume PCR droplets to achieve a droplet transport based qRT-PCR reaction. The PCR volume was maintained constant in order to compare micro-device performance with the conventional, off-chip PCR set-up which requires a minimum of 10 \u03bcL PCR reaction volume. At this stage of proof-of-concept, it was important to match the sample preparation protocols of the conventional set-up to suitably compare the micro-device performance. However, since one of the promising advantages of leveraging micro-devices for bio-diagnostics is to substantially reduce the required bio-sample/reagent volumes; we investigated on-chip qRT-PCR reactions in PCR droplet volumes of: 1 \u03bcL, 2.5 \u03bcL, 5 \u03bcL, 7.5 \u03bcL and 10 \u03bcL. Results of this different volume qRT-PCR experiment are reported in Figure 12. The different volume PCR droplets were all pipetted from a 40 \u03bcL PCR reaction mix (20 \u03bcL influenza C RNA sample + 20 \u03bcL PCR Master Mix). The 7.5 \u03bcL and 10 \u03bcL PCR droplets were successfully actuated over micro-electrodes 1 and 2 respectively to achieve transport based PCR reaction. However, due to the fact that the two micro-electrode structures were tailored for PCR volumes close to 10 \u03bcL, PCR droplets <5 \u03bcL were subjected to a static PCR thermal cycling, where they were positioned in one of the two TCUs and the thermal zone was cycled between the two temperature limits of 60\u00b0C and 95\u00b0C. Cycle time for static qRT-PCR was observed to be 2.5 times larger than that of transport based PCR assay. As a result of the slower ramp rates, the PCR droplet is exposed in the high temperature region (between 80\u00b0C \u2013 95\u00b0C) for a larger amount of time, per cycle during the entire qRT-PCR reaction. This coupled with the smaller droplet volumes, resulted in change in the PCR efficiency for the smaller 2.5 \u03bcL PCR droplet (see Figure 12). Furthermore, the 1 \u03bcL PCR droplet did not show any amplification and suffered from significant volume loss (\u223c25% of sample volume was lost during the first 10 cycles). The PCR efficiency for the 7.5 \u03bcL and 10 \u03bcL PCR droplets was close to \u223c95%; whereas the efficiencies of the 5 \u03bcL and 2.5 \u03bcL PCR were found to be \u223c90% and 78% respectively. The calculated PCR efficiency values indicate that the transport based chip qRT-PCR is superior to the static PCR method. The poor performance of PCR in the smaller reaction volumes can henceforth be attributed to the fact that the current experimental set-up and the micro-electrode structures were tailored to handle larger PCR droplets (close to 10 \u03bcL); however, this exercise does demonstrate the possibility of reducing the PCR reaction volumes to microliter or sub-microliter PCR droplets. Although from the view-point of clinical pathogen detection, the possible reduction of PCR droplet volumes is not a significant improvement since the point of emphasis for such applications is to lower the detection threshold which may often require sampling larger sample volumes for the qRT-PCR detection assays.",

It illustrates micro-electrode designs which offer integration of micro-heater/RTD sensor based TCUs, with DEP/EW based miniaturized droplet handling technology, on a single substrate, for achieving the on-chip qRT-PCR assays. The on-chip TCUs were simulated using COMSOL v4.2 and calibrated using Rhodamine B dye. Results of the on-chip qRT-PCR amplification and real-time detection of influenza A and C viruses are furthermore analyzed to establish standard quantitative PCR curves, which help establish the satisfactory PCR efficiencies for the micro-device. Limit of detection (LOD) for the qRT-PCR micro-device, based on the targeted detection of influenza A and C viruses, is estimated to be \u223c5 copies per PCR reaction. The success of the micro-device, in carrying out different volume qRT-PCR reactions, suggests the potential for further reduction of the required PCR sample and reagent volumes. The current micro-electrode designs restrict the chip usability to one PCR per chip however; work is currently underway toward developing multiplexed qRT-PCR micro-devices, which can simultaneously accommodate eight or more qRT-PCR reactions per chip. Such multiplexed qRT-PCR chips are better suited for clinical experimentation, where numerous repeated testing of known and unknown viral samples is required in order to provide robust pathogenic bio-diagnostics.",
