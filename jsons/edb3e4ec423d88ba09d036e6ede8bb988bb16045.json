Schools and some day care facilities and public places such as parks have additionally been closed. On March 19, a similar stay-at-home order was issued covering the entire state of California. 6 More recently, San Francisco is introducing a program of contact tracing, and has begun to require the use of cloth face masks beginning April 18, 2020. 7 At the time of this writing, the shelter-in-place order has been extended through the month of May. In many places, the accumulation of new cases per day appears to have slowed, suggesting that interventions such as social distancing may be helping to slow transmission.",

A time-varying reproduction number, commonly written R t , denotes the average number of cases infected by a given case over the course of that individual's disease progression, indexed by a time variable t, such as the date of the symptom onset of the case. Of particular interest is the question of whether transmission is supercritical, meaning that R t > 1, in which case the epidemic can increase in size, or is subcritical, meaning that R t < 1, in which case it will fade out. To eliminate a disease locally, it is not necessary to reduce R t to zero, only to reduce it below one for a sustained period. We used publically available daily counts of COVID-19 cases by county and state to estimate the time course of the reproduction number in the 50 U.S. states and in counties and regions of California.",

We estimated the serial interval using estimates of the incubation interval, timing of transmission relative to symptom onset, and timing of case reporting relative to symptom onset, as follows. The incubation interval was modeled as log-normally distributed with mean 5.6 days and standard deviation 4.2 days (logmean 1.5, logSD 0.67) (He et al. 2020) . The interval from primary cases's symptom onset to a transmission event, which may be negative due to presymptomatic transmission, was modeled by \u22122.5 days plus a gamma distributed number of days with scale parameter 1.5 and shape parameter 2.1. With this assumption, about 44% of transmission is presymptomatic (He et al. 2020 ). The interval from symptom onset to case reporting, which contributes variance but no difference in mean to the serial interval distribution, was included to reflect variability in reporting, using a log-normal distribution with mean 8.9 days and standard deviation 7 days (logmean ln 7, logSD ln 2), to reflect the possibility that some cases may be detected soon after symptom onset, while others may be detected several weeks later. The resulting serial interval distribution has mean 6.3 days and standard deviation 10.9 days ( Figure 1 ).",

We then estimated the current reproduction number in each of these localities by combining the daily estimates over the most recent week, using multiple imputation (Rubin and Schenker 1991 A similar pattern is observed in many states (Figure 8 ), while in others R t remains high, reflecting that daily case counts are still rising. In particular, our central estimate of R t in New York became subcritical (R t < 1) on approximately April 12, 2020, while this occurred in New Jersey on approximately April 21, 2020. As of May 9, 2020, the estimated R t for Minnesota was still above 1.5, while for Nebraska, the value was about 1.34. The estimated R t in South Dakota as of May 9, 2020 was also approximately 1.5, this estimate being influenced by testing in Minnehaha County which brought over 200 cases to light.",

The estimates at later dates may also be higher than expected as a result of the correction technique introduced by Cauchemez et al. (Cauchemez et al. 2006) , which accounts for the portion of a case's secondary cases not yet reported, when the serial interval extends beyond the last date reported. This effect is relatively large here, because our serial interval estimate includes long intervals.",
