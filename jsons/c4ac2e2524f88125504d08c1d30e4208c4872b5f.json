            "text": "BACKGROUND: Earlier attempts to deliver effective lung doses of surfactant by aerosolization were unsuccessful, mostly because of technical shortcomings. We aimed at quantifying the lung deposition of poractant alfa with a new supraglottic delivery system for surfactant atomization in an experimental neonatal model. METHODS: The method involved six sedated 1-day-old piglets lying in the lateral decubitus, spontaneously breathing on nasalmask continuous positive airway pressure (nCPAP). A pharyngeal cannula housing a multi-channel air-blasting atomization catheter was placed through the mouth with its tip above the glottis entrance. In all, 200 mg kg \u22121 of a 99m Tc-surfactant mixture was atomized through the catheter synchronously with inspiration. Six intubated control piglets received an equal amount of intratracheally instilled 99m Tc-surfactant mixture. The percentage of the 99m Tc-surfactant mixture deposited in the lungs was estimated by scintigraphy. RESULTS: Median (range) deposition in the lungs was 40% (24-68%) after atomization and 87% (55-95%) after instillation (p < 0.001). Overall, almost 80% of the deposited surfactant was in the dependent lung. Effective atomization time (atomizer on) was 28 (17-52) min, yielding an output rate of 0.1-0.2 mL min \u22121 . CONCLUSIONS: Without endotracheal intubation, in spontaneously breathing newborn piglets, this new supraglottic atomizer delivery system attained a median lung deposition of 40% of the nominal dose of surfactant.",

            "text": "Respiratory distress syndrome is the most common disease affecting premature neonates. 1 Endotracheal (ET) instillation of exogenous surfactant is still the standard recommended therapy 2 with high-quality evidence demonstrating its clinical efficacy by dramatically improved survival rates since its introduction in the 1980s. 3, 4 Nevertheless, surfactant delivery via instillation is an invasive procedure that usually requires ET intubation and manipulation of the airways and is associated with several risks, such as transient hypoxia and bradycardia, changes in blood pressure, fluctuations in cerebral blood flow, pulmonary hemorrhage, and positive pressure ventilation. [5] [6] [7] Because of these potential complications and the increasing use of noninvasive ventilation methods (NIV) in the treatment of mildto-moderate degrees of neonatal respiratory distress syndrome, there has been a renewed interest in the implementation of less invasive techniques for surfactant administration to the premature surfactant-deficient infant. In the 1990s, the INSURE [INtubate, bolus SURfactant administration, prompt Extubation to nasal continuous positive airway pressure (nCPAP)] technique was introduced 8, 9 to preclude prolonged intubation and mechanical ventilation, and although it does reduce mechanical ventilation time and possibly the extent of barotrauma, it does not consistently decrease the incidence of bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) or associated complications. 10 In the past decade, new approaches to surfactant administration have been gathered under the denomination of minimally invasive surfactant therapy. Fifteen German centers showed decreased mortality and lower incidence of BPD when administering surfactant via a thin, flexible catheter inserted below the vocal cords in spontaneously breathing neonates while on nCPAP. [11] [12] [13] However, the technique requires the use of a laryngoscope and often of a Magill forceps to properly place the catheter in the trachea.",

Using a vibratingmesh nebulizer to continuously deliver porcine surfactant (Curosurf\u00ae, Chiesi Farmaceutici SpA, Parma, Italy) to piglets on nCPAP, we reported a lung deposition of 14% of the total nebulized dosage. 14 However, upper airway deposition (nose and pharynx) was 19%, supporting the observations of others that the placement of a nebulizer in the ventilator breathing circuit is often associated with a significant loss of surfactant in the upper airways, in the breathing circuit, and possibly to the ambient air. 15 To optimize delivery, a new system that uses a special pharyngeal cannula and a multichannel flexible catheter for surfactant atomization was developed. 16, 17 The tip of the cannula holding the multichannel catheter is placed in the pharynx just above the glottic opening without requiring the use of a laryngoscope. The device allows surfactant atomization to take place directly above the glottis, therefore bypassing most of the upper airway, in synchrony with the inspiratory flow during nCPAP or other modalities of NIV.",

Rahmel et al., 20 using immature lambs breathing via nasal prongs, reported a lung deposition of only 1% of the administered recombinant surfactant protein-C surfactant aerosol, equivalent to 4 mg lipids per kg. The median lung deposition of 14% of the total administered poractant alfa surfactant dose (200 mg kg \u22121 ) reported by our group in non-intubated term newborn piglets in nCPAP with a mesh nebulizer placed in the respiratory circuit in nonsynchronized mode corresponds to 28 mg kg \u22121 of lipids. 14 Wagner et al. demonstrated that surfactant atomization could take place inside the trachea with an atomizer at the tip of a modified ETT and synchronized to the animals' breath. 21 Their average lung surfactant deposition using a radiolabeling technique was 86%. Nevertheless, placing the atomizer at the tip of the tube is technically challenging and does not avoid the disadvantages of ET intubation. With the presently tested breath-activated supraglottic delivery system, in premature spontaneously breathing lambs on nCPAP, using samarium (nonradioactive tracer)labeled surfactant, Milesi et al. observed a median lung deposition of 32% of the administered dose (200 mg kg \u22121 ) of poractant alfa. 22 In the present study with the same atomizing device, using a wellvalidated and accepted method for measuring lung deposition with radioactive labeling of the administered surfactant, we show for the first time, a lung surfactant deposition over 50 mg kg \u22121 , i.e., median lipid delivery of 80 mg kg \u22121 for a surfactant dose of 200 mg kg \u22121 . This device was conceived with the intent to avoid patient intubation, to reduce dead space, to avoid surfactant denaturalization, 23 and to work synchronously with inspiration thereby reducing surfactant losses to the upper airways and environment.",

Particle size is one of the most important properties of an aerosol with an impact on its deposition and distribution in the airways. The optimal particle size for reaching the distal airways and alveoli is around 1-3 \u03bcm. 24 Nonetheless, in the above-mentioned study by Wagner et al., intratracheal atomization of surfactant particles with a Sauter Mean Diameter >100 \u03bcm reached similar lung deposition and distribution as instillation. 21 Their results are probably due to a more central deposition in the larger airways Values are presented as median (range).

The mean particle size in our study was somewhat less, with a median diameter of 40-60 \u03bcm. Even so, the generated particles were probably big enough to increase the initial deposition in the large airways reducing the losses during expiration. Furthermore, the accurate positioning of the tip of the atomizer in the supraglottic region and the synchronicity of delivery with the inspiratory flow are two other factors contributing to improved lung deposition by eliminating unwarranted losses in the upper respiratory tract, as well as losses to the atmosphere and the delivery system. The oropharyngeal cannula was designed with a shape allowing self-positioning during the blind introduction. We confirmed the correct placement with a fiberscope before starting atomization. However, the cannula did not perfectly match the geometry of the pig's pharynges, with the lateral dimension of the actual pharynx being larger than the one of the cannulas. This allowed an excessive degree of freedom that might have led to dislodgement of the cannula during the surfactant delivery and could be one of the sources of the inter-subject variability in the deposition rates we observed.",

That the instillation group had a slightly lower MAP and HR at 0 time (not statistically significant) is explained by the need for deeper sedation required for animal comfort, as MAP and HR decreased at the time of intubation and remained stable afterward. In contrast with reports showing drastic changes in hemodynamics and oxygenation during surfactant instillation, 25 we only observed a transient fluctuation in CrSO 2 . PaO 2 did not fall probably because we performed a recruitment maneuver with PEEP right after surfactant instillation. Blood gas parameters were better in the instillation group at the end of the experiment, but this is not surprising because these piglets were breathing in PS mode with an unobstructed secured airway (ETT). In the atomization group, shortly after the procedure, there was an increase in PaCO 2 and a decrease in PaO 2 corresponding to a SaO 2 around 84%, probably reflecting ventilation-perfusion mismatch due to the extra fluid volume delivered to healthy lungs. Surfactant accumulation in the large airways was also a concern. Therefore, after a few pilot experiments, we chose to split the surfactant dose into four equal aliquots intercalated with 5 min of PS ventilation to promote redistribution of the accumulated fluid and lung recruitment.",
