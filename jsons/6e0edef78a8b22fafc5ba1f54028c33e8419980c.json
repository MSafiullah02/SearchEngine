As to immunotherapy, it is not known if their use puts patients at a higher risk for pneumonitis or cytokine storm. Managing COVID-19 and its complications should be prioritized over management of cancer. However, clinical decisions should be individualized to consider factors such as the risk of cancer relapse if treatment is modified, the number of cycles already completed, and the patient's tolerance of therapy. Third, in asymptomatic patients who are carriers of COVID-19 planning ahead could help minimize complication rate of chemotherapy. Cancer directed therapy (e.g. anti-CD20 monoclonal antibody) has been known to reactivate certain viral infections. In these circumstances, delaying or de-intensifying semi urgent chemotherapy should be considered.",
