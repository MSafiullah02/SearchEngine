Distinguishing regenerative versus nonregenerative anemia is difficult because clear criteria are lacking and nonanemic NWCs may have up to 1.4% reticulocytes in circulation. The normal camelid leukon is characterized by a neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio similar to dogs, cats, and horses, although the total white cell count tends to be high (8000\u201322,000 cells/\u03bcl). Platelets are small with azurophilic granules visible. The overall leukocytic responses to various insults or stimuli, as well as the gross character of bone marrow, are similar to those anticipated for other species. However, stress-induced leukocytosis and neutrophilia can be substantial, with white cell counts exceeding 40,000 cells/\u03bcl in some cases, including remarkable increases in band neutrophil counts.",

Total protein levels may range from 31.2 to 66.8 mg/dL and glucose concentrations are about 40% of the serum levels.4 This sample may also permit visualization of some agents or be used for specific immune-based reactions, such as serology or latex agglutination.

It is strongly recommended that half of the brain plus suspected areas of spinal cord damage be fixed in 10% neutral buffered formalin.
