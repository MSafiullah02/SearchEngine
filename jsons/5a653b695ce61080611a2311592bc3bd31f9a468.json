I think there are two reasons to do so. Most of these accounts do not have modern science and technology clearly in focus, nor do they seem to think that gender relations are relevant to either modernity's crisis or its possible successor. First, the science and technology issue. When these authors are from the humanities or classical social theory and its successors in the West, and whether they are politically on the Right, Left, or Centre, science and technology are usually to be found off at the periphery of such accounts. Modernity for them is about exclusion of the influence of religion and kinship in forms of government and citizenship, economy, and education, and about a shift from past to future in social orientation. Such exclusion makes the creation of autonomous, rational institutions, including those of valuefree modern science and, consequently social progress possible. Since these scholars are largely unfamiliar with the critiques of exceptionalist and triumphalist science indicated above, they often treat modern sciences as if they played no role in whatever economic, social and political ills lead them to question modernity.",

Such a project poses frustrating questions, which challenge familiar ethical and political assumptions, and even seem critical of the psychic framework that well-intentioned academics bring to such a project. Do we have the right to try to answer such questions? Can we, especially those of us who are U.S. citizens, contribute to creating the polycentric democratic political spaces, in Egyptian economist Amin's (1997) phrase, called for by so many critics of the West's modernity who want to encourage the design and emergence of desirable successors to the West's global hegemony? On the other hand, what are the consequences of our neglecting to engage such issues?",

In today's world, they ask, do Western sciences promote or retard the growth of the democratic social relations and social progress, which have been taken to be distinctive marks of modernity? Some have argued that these sciences and their philosophies in some respects actually block important directions in the growth of scientific knowledge and toward social progress -though they have different visions of social progress. Here I look at the consideration of these issues by three such critics of modernity who focus on the sciences: the French ethnographer and philosopher of science Latour (1993) , the German sociologist Beck (1992 Beck ( , 1999 , and the Indian science studies intellectual Nandy (1988) .",

Latour is an ethnographer and philosopher, one of the founders and continuing contributors to mainstream European-American science studies. Beck brings a background in the German environmental movement and in sociological theory to thinking about science's role in \"risk society.\" Nandy has been a continuing contributor to postcolonial science studies and especially to its critique of the disastrous recent effects of Western sciences in the Third World. Second, while all are critics of modernity, all find postmodernism an unattractive alternative. Third, all three argue that science has become a kind of governance which illegitimately bypasses democratic processes. However, fourth, in contrast to postmodern critics of modernity and of philosophies of modern science, all three are optimistic about the possibilities for transforming the sciences into ones that are politically accountable for their practices and consequences and can contribute to social progress, and that are epistemologically less \"underdeveloped.\" All three call for more science, though they want different kinds of sciences than those favoured in the contemporary West. They each strategise about how to democratise science in the service of a radically democratized social order, and how to do so by strengthening and expanding the reach of the scientific impulse. This set of commitments and projects makes it difficult to categorize any of them as having fully modern or fully postmodern commitments.",

In ignoring gendered aspects of both their objects of study and of their own accounts, all three deeply undermine the chances of success of their own projects.

They are concerned especially with the increasing power of scientific technologies. Modernization theorists, who produce the second kind of temporal notion of modernity, draw especially on this kind of history of science. Those concerned with modernizing traditional societies, for example in the Third World development policies of national and international agencies and institutions after the Second World War, always focus on transferring to underdeveloped societies, as they were characterized, Western scientific and technological rationality in manufacturing, health care, agriculture and other economic sectors. They take Western forms of modernization to be the only ones, as did their Nineteenth Century forerunners such as Marx, Durkheim, and Weber. For such theorists, as well as for some of their critics, modernization is identical to Westernization. Modernization means Western modernization, and science refers only to Western science. 1 Like Nineteenth Century theorists of modernity such as Marx, Durkheim, and Weber, modernization theorists have expected a gradual homogenization of global societies as Western forms of modernity disseminate around the globe. By now, those Third World development policies are widely criticized for further immiserating the majority of the world's poorest citizens whom such policies were supposed to benefit (Amin, 1997; Sachs, 1992; Escobar, 1995) . Feminist work has been an important part of this critique, (Mies, 1986; Shiva, 1989; Sparr, 1994) . Moreover, while modernity is now a global condition shaping how all societies engage with the world around them (Wittrock, 2000) , the expected homogenization of societies around the world has not occurred (Amin, 1997; Eisenstadt, 2000) .",

Substantive conceptions focus on the emergence of a differentiated social structure with independent political, economic, religious/moral, educational (including scientific) and family structures, and such democratic institutions as representative government and a free press. They usually centre the presence of a secular worldview, the idealization of universal instrumental rationality, and a social orientation toward the future rather than toward the past. They also include several kinds of contradictory tendencies, such as the insistence on universal reason, yet also recognition and even toleration of the pluralism of rationalities, and a critical and self-critical attitude along with severe restrictions on the appropriate targets of such criticisms. And these substantive conceptions contain unarticulated tensions such as the promotion of a continuing global dissemination of the modern alongside tacit approval of a continual reconstitution of modernity's other, the traditional -a point to which we return. (Eisenstadt, 2000; Wittrock, 2000) . This is the kind of complex and conflicted background against which Latour, Beck, and Nandy undertake their critiques of modernity and their examinations of the tensions between scientific practices and philosophies, on the one hand, and particular modern projects, on the other hand.

Reality consists of such hybrid networks. Yet modernity requires a representation of reality consisting only of images of purified objects. It delinks nature from culture, appropriate policies and practices from deities, and it delinks agencies, institutes and corporations from mechanisms and other material artefacts. Modernity, its epistemologies, philosophies of science, and its sciences represent a world of broken networks and dismembered hybrids that is not the one in which we live or about which we want explanations. Its sciences are intentionally isolated from the reality that needs explanation, and that practice itself is a culturally distinct one. We do not live in the modern world that the epistemologies and philosophies of science of modernity imagine in their claims to transcend cultural values. We, and our sciences, have never been modern, he proclaims. He implies that we, and our sciences, are as historically specific, as much in the thrall of our own culturally shaped reality, as any other culture and its knowledge-system. Where, Latour asks, are sciences of these networks and hybrids? Not in the laboratories or field sites. Rather such sciences have been developed in the disciplines of science studies, he argues. Its histories, sociologies, ethnographies, and textual studies of moments in the history of Western sciences focus on the relations between knowledge-seeking and the social, cultural, economic, political and even psychic projects of an era (e.g., Biagioli, 1999) . Latour is not a fan of feminist contributions to this field, but they have been significant (e.g., Braidotti et al., 1994; Haraway, 1989 Haraway, , 1991 Harding, 1986 Harding, , 1991 Harding, , 2003 . Moreover, we can note, though Latour does not, that, such studies have been expanded by postcolonial scholars to include scientific, instead of triumphalist and Eurocentric, investigations of other cultures' knowledge-systems and of relations between the knowledge projects of the West and those of other cultures. While Latour appears to be unaware of the increasingly large literature with just such a focus that has been developing in these extensions of science studies over the last three decades (Harding, 1998a; Hess, 1995; Petitjean et al., 1992; Sachs, 1992; Sardar, 1988; Selin, 1997) , he is nevertheless critical of the West's traditional negative attitude toward other cultures. And his account opens the door to understanding the necessity of re-evaluating other cultures' knowledge systems, though he does not himself step through that door or, more likely, even see the value of such a move.",

It senses that something has gone awry in the modern critique, but it is not able to do anything but prolong that critique, though without believing in its foundations.

Disappointed rationalists, its adepts indeed sense that modernism is done for [\u2026.] (Latour, 1993, p. 46) Latour proposes that we think instead in terms of the \"a-modern.\" More competent sciences as well as the political work of constructing democratic social relations both require reuniting aspects of the world which modernity keeps sundered. \"Half of our politics is constructed in science and technology. The other half of Nature is constructed in societies. Let us patch the two back together, and the political task can begin again\" (p. 144). The project will be difficult. But \"[t]he task of our predecessors was no less daunting when they invented rights to give to citizens or the integration of workers into the fabric of our societies\" (p. 145). Thus Latour links failures of the modern political project to failures of its knowledge project, though he is vague about just what the former project and its failures have been. Advancing democratic social relations as well as restoring the environment, another important political project, both require a scientific study of kinds of objects around us that modernity has banished from view. It is the recently emerging field of science studies that has developed the resources to engage in such work, he argues. Such studies bring systematic scientific assumptions and methods to the description and explanation of the hybrids and networks that constitute reality.",

Modern sciences and technologies have enabled industrial society to create terrifying global risks. Now we live in a context of generalized employment insecurity. We fear the kind of economic crises that have sunk national economies virtually overnight. We fear pandemics such as AIDS, SARS, or Asian Bird Flue which can quickly spread around the world with little warning, little possibility of immunity, and often few known remedies. New kinds of environmental destruction seem daily to threaten our lives and the natural resources upon which human life depends. Damaging forms of radiation, whether from armaments, power plants, or work sites, seem impossible to predict let alone to eliminate or control. \"Everywhere pollutants and toxins laugh and play their tricks like devils in the Middle Ages. People are almost inescapably bound over to them. Breathing, eating, dwelling, wearing clothes -everything has been penetrated by them\" (Beck, 1992, p. 73 ). Little appears to be known about the effects of genetically modified foods, yet it seems impossible to stop agribusiness from producing and selling them. And there are the dangers from second-hand smoke, mad cow disease, urban crime and violence, the unregulated global firearms trade, and a host of other contemporary phenomena -including, now, biological, chemical, and military terrorism -all of which are enabled through modernity's sciences and technologies. However isolated from cultural, social, and political influences scientists may imagine their work to be, the consequences of their work today are always already embedded in cultural, social, economic, and political possibilities for those with the power to turn such possibilities into actualities. Who is to blame? Everyone and thus no one seem responsible for these risks. No one is held accountable for them. It is impossible to prove with a reasonable degree of certainty that the toxic industry upstream, the tobacco industry, or agribusiness's use of pesticides and chemical fertilizers was responsible for a particular pattern of increased cancer rates, or that blame for urban violence or terrorism should be placed on the hugely expanded, profitable, and minimally regulated arms industry. Scientific technologies seem out of control politically. Thus we all seem doomed to have to continue to countenance these increased threats to life and health. We live in an environment of manufactured uncertainties and institutional irresponsibility.",

Beck's question is \"How can the risks and hazards systematically produced as part of modernization be prevented, minimized, dramatized or channelled?\" (p. 19). Modern sciences, their epistemologies and philosophies of science have permitted the development of only semi-modern societies, he proposes. Moreover, these sciences and their philosophies are not likely to look kindly on the kinds of transformations necessary to make possible fully-modern societies and their more self-critical, reflexive, sciences. They will resist those developments of sciences that stand a chance of eliminating or even diminishing the extent and power of the risk society. The problem is that modern sciences profit too much from risk society. \"[S]cience is one of the causes, the medium of definition, and the source of solutions to risks, and by virtue of that very fact it opens up new markets of scientization for itself\" (p. 155). The actual and perceived threats of the risk society are created by modern sciences and their technologies. However, it is also modern scientific and technological experts who are asked to analyze and measure for us these risks. Finally, it is just such experts who are then called upon to \"solve\" the threats of the risk society. The risk society is knowledge-dependent. Thus modern sciences and technologies are profiteers dependent upon their monopoly on the production of truths, and thus on the continuation of the very risks their epistemologies and philosophies of science made possible in the first place. Here is another way in which we can see how science has become a form of governance, a way of \"ruling\" our lives. Decisions that will affect how we live (and die!) are made on scientific and technological grounds that bypass the democratic processes to which political decisions are supposed to be subjected.",

Beck pointed out why we should expect resistance to such an opening up of decision making. Yet he has another insight, which leads him to be optimistic about the possibility of such a transformation: it can occur through the expansion of science. There are three ways in which such a process is already under way, he points out. One is the dissemination of the scientific attitude and practices into the systematic study of sciences and technologies themselves: the development of \"sciences of science\" in the field of critical science and technology studies.

We need a reflexive modernity, he argues, one that can scientifically describe, understand, and explain its own principles and practices, which industrial modernity cannot. A second way in which the risk society itself has inadvertently expanded scientific practice is that it makes us all participate in the production of reliable knowledge. We must do so because the first modernity proliferates experts who continually disagree with each other. \"\u2026[E]xperts dump their contradictions and conflicts at the feet of the individual and leave him or her with the well intentioned invitation to judge all of this critically on the basis of his or her own notions\" (Beck, 1992, p. 137) . Consequently, \"science becomes more and more necessary, but at the same time, less and less sufficient for the socially binding definition of truth\" (p. 156). Are smoking and second-hand smoke harmful or not? Do vitamins and herbal remedies improve our health and longevity? Which ones and how many should we take? Should we increase our intake of fish, since fish oils seem to provide protection against various forms of cancer, or decrease the amount of fish in our diet since fish seem to pass on environmental toxins? Should we take the radiation and chemotherapies recommended by Western biomedicine to stop the growth of cancers, or the herbal remedies recommended by German pharmacologists? Will the benefits of genetically modified foods outweigh their risks? Is global warming increasing, and if so what should we do about it? The proliferation of conflicting expert opinions on such topics requires that each of us must figure out how to make informed decisions about our own nutrition, health, and safety and that of our children and other dependents. We are forced to become part of the production of scientific knowledge. The production of scientific knowledge escapes the monopoly of scientist experts in this second way.",

To me the Enlightenment is not a historical notion and set of ides but a process and dynamics where criticism, selfcriticism, irony and humanity play a central role [\u2026 M]y notion of \"second reflexive modernity\" implies that we do not have enough reason [\u2026] in a new postmodern meaning to live and act in a Global Age [\u2026] of manufactured uncertainties. (Beck, 1999, p. 152) Like Latour, Beck is also optimistic. Needed transformations of the first modernity's sciences and social relations are already underway. Beck's social theory is more robust and comprehensive than Latour's; it provides more clues to how and where progressive transformations can and, perhaps, are already occurring. This project is pursued in later books, and especially in The Reinvention of Politics: Rethinking Modernity in the Global Social Order (Beck, 1997 ). Beck's controversial writings have had great influence on German and European social theory. He has also been criticized on a number of grounds, most notably for underestimating the continuing power of class (Draper, 1993; New 1994) , especially in global contexts, for essentializing science and failing to sufficiently analyze its political/economic content (Boyd, 1993) , for conflating the reality and the perception of risk, and for regarding as general a situation which is more distinctive to Germany than to other parts of the world. He has also been charged with overemphasizing the rift between a first and second modernity, and for taking the ideology of modern science for its reality. He responds to some of these criticisms directly in the last chapter of Word Risk Society (Beck, 1999) , and indirectly in such other writings (see, e.g., Beck, 1997) . Whatever the limitations of his account, he has conceptualized in provocative ways important questions about how contemporary science functions as a kind of governance of our daily lives behind the back, so to speak, of democratic political processes. He also offers alternatives to both the current politics of modernity and its sciences and to postmodernism's fatalism. He points to valuable ways in which scientific expertise is already escaping the monopoly of natural scientists.",

            "text": "Postcolonial science and technology studies have produced a distinctive vision of modern Western sciences and their philosophies. The origins of this field can be found in attempts to re-evaluate objectively -that is, outside the familiar Eurocentric exceptionalist and triumphalist framework -indigenous scientific and technological traditions in ex-colonized societies. It can also be found in criticisms of the imperial and neo-colonial character of the new Third World development policies in the 1950s, and the role of Western sciences and technologies in such policies and subsequent practices. Development was from the beginning conceptualized as the transfer of Western sciences and technologies, and their distinctive rationality, to the so-called underdeveloped societies. Thus the practices and philosophies of Western sciences and technologies would be implicated in the successes and failures of Third World development. This point has been virtually invisible to Western philosophies of science, which still focus for the most part on what happens in laboratories in Europe and the United States. These postcolonial science and technology studies emerged as a distinctive field in English-language writings by the early 1980s, and so have now accumulated more than two decades of books, articles, journals, conferences, manifestos, websites, and a significant presence in ongoing projects of United Nations organizations as well as other national and international institutions and agencies. There has always been at least a sprinkling of Western activists and scholars involved in these projects. 3 Meanwhile, studies of \"multiple modernities\" have appeared (Daedalus, 2000) . Interestingly, modern sciences and technologies, Western or not, are barely mentioned in this work. Yet many of its assumptions and arguments also appear in postcolonial science and technology studies. One shared point is that modernity is not the same as Westernisation. At least some non-Western societies are clearly modern, with differentiated social institutions, multiple political parties, representative government, a free press, or some combination of these, as well as highly developed technology and science sectors (consider, for example, India and South Korea). Yet they look very different from modern Western societies. Often their sciences look different, for they overtly combine elements of modern Western sciences and of traditional knowledge systems, including their local values and interests. Many of the elements the theorists of modernity presumed were requisite for modernization are missing in these cases. For example, they often do not give up central elements of their traditional identities. Their sciences are often openly infused with traditional religious and cultural assumptions and projects. 4 Thus, in spite of increasing global economic, political, and cultural linkages, global homogenization has not been the consequence of the dissemination of modernization, its sciences and their rationality. Instead we have a world of \"indigenous modern knowledge systems.\" Indeed, Latour and Beck, like the postcolonial theorists, both identified distinctively Western features of Western modernity's sciences. Are these \"incomplete modernities\" (Ortiz, 2000) or simply different modernities? Does regarding them as incomplete invariably retain Western standards for modernity?",

It is to exist for the extraction of raw materials, to serve tourism, as the recipient of toxic industries and toxic dumps, and as a source of labour in such projects there and to meet labour needs in the West, (see also Amin, 1997) . We can add that it also serves as a consumer of the Western arms industry.

Yet it would be as reasonable to refer to the processes by which scientific institutions come to monopolise scientific and technical decisions that have political consequences as the politicisation of science. Such processes surreptitiously redefine as merely scientific or technical issues fundamental political issues of how we shall live our lives, who shall receive the benefits and who bear the costs of scientific and technological work, which, incidentally (for financing is not the main issue here), is itself financially supported by the citizenry. The scientific monopolisation of what are fundamental political issues removes from the public realm discussion of how we shall be governed.

Early feminist criticisms of development policies argued that women around the world were being left out of development. The kind of scientific and technological training which made possible greater access to agricultural and manufacturing jobs for export production had been restricted to men. This was because Europeans and Americans in the development agencies and their funders perceived such jobs as men's work regardless of which gender had performed traditional forms of agricultural and manufacturing labour in Third World societies. Modern production was consistently gendered as masculine. Thus men were drawn into modernized work in distant cities or plantations, leaving women, children, the old and the sick behind to survive on their own largely without benefit of adult male economic or social assistance. The early feminist argument went that women, too, should be educated so that they could access such means of livelihood. Modern work did not have to be gendered. Androcentric development policies were unfairly leaving women behind with access only to pre-modern forms of work and community, and under conditions of deprivation at that.",

Moreover, the labour of women and peasants was appropriated from subsistence work for their own kin and communities into the capitalist agricultural and manufacturing export economies favoured by Northern corporations and international agency sponsors. Mies pointed out that the Marxists were wrong; \"primitive capital accumulation\" had not ended by mid-Twentieth Century, but rather continued through Third World development policies and practices. The families and communities dependent on women's domestic labour were left even more the responsibility of women alone, who now had to replace through low-paid labour for local and international industries, as well as through sex work and domestic labour far from home, the economic contributions that had been provided to them, their dependents and communities through their work and their men's work on their own lands.",

Of course Nandy speaks from the history and practices of the lively postcolonial science movement and points to its importance in agitating for political audits of science and technology programs. And Beck (1997) emphasizes the importance of environmental movements. Yet critical examinations of the gender of modernity (Felski, 1995; Gole, 2000; Jardine, 1985; Philip, 2003) and of androcentrism in science and technology projects and their philosophies, North and South, are virtually unacknowledged in the thought of all three theorists. (See earlier citations). Gender analyses have charted the distortions and political damages created by the hyper-masculinization of modernity and its scientific and technological projects. Third World feminist criticisms of development policies have specifically focused on their androcentrism as well as their racism, colonialism and imperialism. These identify how such androcentrism further disempowers not only the half of the Third World constituted by women and girls, but also the other half, the male half, which depends upon the knowledge and labour of women to maintain families, the elderly and sick, and the community relations and resources upon which men and boys depend, as well as to produce cash income. The range and power of gender analyses is too big a topic to pursue further here, but its necessity should be noted. 6 The \"modernities\" on which Latour, Beck, and Nandy focus are distinctively gendered, and the remedies to their scientific and political limitations must directly engage with these gendered aspects of the democracy to which these theorists aspire.",

This kind of work has moved to the \"base\" of the global political economy thanks to the development of electronic media, especially the Internet (Castells, 1996) . The production and delivery of goods (food supplies, manufacturing components, retail store stocks), as well as scientific research, and international environmental policy are now organized through the Web, e-mail, and cell phones. So are terrorism, criminal activity, and progressive political protests. New configurations of scientific communities have emerged following the 1989 end of the Cold War and the huge migration into expertisehungry private industry of scientists whom university laboratories no longer had funds to employ (Gibbons et al., 1994; Nowotny et al., 2001) . New forms of capitalist production are complicating the traditional understandings of modernity's rationality in yet further ways (Kleinman and Vallas, 2001) . A large-scale map of possible future directions of capitalist expansion and of possible effective forms of resistance to it are required for effective planning for democratic sciences in democratic societies (e.g., Amin, 1997) . The West's prevailing philosophies of science, modernity, and democracy are poorly equipped to enable democratic policies for directing these new social relations. Latour, Beck, and Nandy have provided helpful clues for how we might begin to rethink central aspects of this new production and management of information, but none provide the conceptual resources to grasp such phenomena in maximally inclusive and effective ways.",

Reflecting on the arguments of these three critics of modernity, Latour, Beck and Nandy, enables us to appreciate how historically specific forms of knowledge-production always are co-constituted with specific forms of governance and of public politics. Today, when the production and management of information have moved to the base of the global political economy, and when sciences' power to govern behind the back of democratic political processes is at its all-time high, we certainly cannot afford to ignore identifying fully the actual links between scientific practices and democratic principles, nor can we ignore the need to debate in maximally democratic spaces goals and strategies for change. We cannot afford to turn our backs on our own actual and desirable embeddedness in a modernity which has consistently defined itself against the feminine and the traditional, both of which are firmly lodged, and necessarily so, in its very core.",
