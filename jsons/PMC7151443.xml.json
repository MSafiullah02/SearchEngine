The patient underwent an emergency endovascular repair under local anesthesia using an Ankura endograft (Lifetech, Shenzhen, China). He received only 3 packs of red blood cells intraoperatively, and after the procedure, he was transferred immediately to the vascular surgery ward. No ICU was needed. He had an uneventful recovery, with full mobilization and oral feeding from the first postoperative day and discharge on the second postoperative day.",

The 2018 guidelines for the treatment of AAA recommend EVAR over open repair in anatomically suitable patients with rAAA.2 Performing the procedure under local anesthesia is an additional advantage. In a recent analysis of the Vascular Quality Initiative database, patients with rAAA who were treated with EVAR under local anesthesia compared with EVAR under general anesthesia had decreased intraoperative time, decreased number of intraoperative blood transfusions, decreased ICU length of stay, and fewer postoperative pulmonary complications.4\n",
