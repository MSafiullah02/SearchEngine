Adherence to SP is even more important with the emergence of infectious diseases, such as avian influenza, severe acute respiratory syndrome, and the threat of bioterrorism.7 The problems of containing drug-resistant organisms such as methicillin-resistant staphylococcus8, 9, 10 and vancomycin-resistant enterococci from colonizing patients give a continuous reminder to HCWs that adherence to SP is also pivotal to patient safety in terms of healthcare-associated infections. In 1996, the Centers for Disease Control proposed Guidelines for Isolation Precautions in Hospitals, as new, two-tiered best practice of infection control precautions that are standard for all patients who are to be regarded as potential carriers of pathogenic microorganisms.1, 10 Strict adherence to SP guidelines is necessary to prevent exposure to potentially life-threatening infections,3, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15 yet a high level of compliance with SP has been reported to be problematic worldwide.3, 4, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20\n",
