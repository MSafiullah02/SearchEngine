When cultures were negative, pneumococcal and universal bacterial PCRs were performed. DNA was extracted from 100 \u03bcL of pleural fluid samples previously stored at \u221280\u00b0C with the automated MagNA Pure LC System (Roche Diagnostics, Meylan, France) and eluted in 100 \u03bcL of elution buffer using the DNA III Magna Pure DNA Isolation Kit (Roche Diagnostics). In-house C pneumoniae (OMP1 gene) and M pneumoniae (P1 cytadhesin gene) PCRs were performed as described previously.17, 18\nS pneumoniae pneumolysin gene real-time PCR was performed according to Corless et al.19 For negative pneumococcal PCR samples, real-time amplification of universal bacterial 16S rDNA was performed and the amplified product was sequenced, as previously reported.20 Pneumococcal antigen was detected with the immunochromatographic test BinaxNOW for Streptococcus pneumoniae (Binax Inc, Portland, Maine), according to Le Monnier et al.21 Pneumococcal strains were serotyped at the French National Reference Center for Pneumococci (NRCP) via the use of latex particles coated with a complete panel of antisera and factor serum (provided by the Statens Serum Institute, Copenhagen, Denmark), which is able to identify the 91 known serotypes. Pneumococcal strains of known serotypes from the Statens Serum Institute and from French NRCP were used as internal controls. When available, DNA from individual pleural fluid samples with positive pneumolysin PCRs also were sent to the NRCP for serotyping with conventional multiplex PCR. PCR and PCR-products detection on 2% agarose gels were performed as described by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (http://www.cdc.gov/ncidod/biotech/strep/pcr.htm).",

Conditional logistic regression was used to compare cases and matched controls for general characteristics. All variables achieving P \u2264 .20 were included in the multivariable analysis.

When appropriate, interactions between variables were tested. More specifically, we used subgroup modeling to thoroughly investigate interactions between final significant variables. When the conditional logistic model did not converge, unpaired classical logistic regression was used. In that case, compared with conditional logistic model, greater significance might be observed.

NSAIDs previously have been a suspected risk factor for severe bacterial infections. The biological mechanisms of how NSAID can influence the pathogenesis of bacterial infections remain controversial. Based on the ability of NSAIDS to modify the host's inflammatory pathway and innate immune response, a direct role for NSAIDs in development of severe group A streptococcal infection was proposed by Stevens in 1995.24 This hypothesis was based on the ability of NSAIDS to induce increased production of cytokines such as tumor necrosis factor, interleukin 1, and interleukin 6.",

Associations between bacterial infections and NSAIDs were reported for necrotizing fasciitis during primary varicella31, 32 or for invasive group A streptococcal infection.33 The occurrence of new symptoms or complications were slightly more frequent in children receiving ibuprofen than in those advised to take acetaminophen during respiratory tract infections.34 Empyema was thought to be associated with outpatient use of NSAIDs in children and adults3, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13; however, NSAIDs could not be causally implicated. These analysis were hampered by protopathic bias,35 ie, the possibility of more frequent use of NSAIDs because patients who developed empyema had more febrile (severe) early infection than those with uncomplicated acute bacterial pneumonia.

Third, when the time between onset of acute viral infection and diagnosis of empyema was less than 72 hours, children were excluded to avoid drug exposure for pyrexia and/or pain linked with empyema onset. Fourth, the analysis phase considered drug exposure only when first drug intake occurred within 72 hours after the onset of acute viral infection symptoms.

Still, the risk of empyema associated with NSAID exposure was greater for children not prescribed an antibiotic, and antibiotic intake reduced the risk for children given NSAIDs. NSAIDs recommended as antipyretics are used widely during acute viral infections in children and also have been sold over-the-counter for many years. NSAIDS constitute one of the most widely used classes of drugs, with probably several million prescriptions and several billion over-the-counter tablets sold for children as antipyretics in developed countries. Regardless of the efficacies of these drugs to control fever, our results suggest that their use is associated with complicated bacterial infection associated with acute viral infection and should be reconsidered.",
