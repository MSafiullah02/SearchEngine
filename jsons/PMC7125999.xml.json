Complete blood counts show atypical lymphocytosis or the hematologic complications listed previously. The monospot test reveals heterophil antibodies in up to 95% of patients with IM. These antibodies are not directed against EBV but are induced by EBV. EBV-specific viral capsid antigen IgM antibody, the best indicator of primary infection, develops in 100% of cases. Viral capsid antigen IgG is a marker for prior infection. Epstein-Barr nuclear antigen antibody develops within 3 to 6 weeks and is a useful marker of acute infection if initially negative tests become positive. Early antigen-diffuse antibodies suggest severe disease. A positive early antigen-diffuse IgA correlates with a higher risk of nasopharyngeal carcinoma, whereas a positive early antigen-restricted IgA suggests a risk of Burkitt's lymphoma.",

Steroids dramatically relieve airway obstruction, sore throat, and fever; seem to improve thrombocytopenia and hemolytic anemia; and may help in other life-threatening complications, but they are not useful for neurologic disease. Prednisone, 1 mg/kg/24 h for 7 to 10 days (often with a 5-day to 7-day tapering added), is one useful regimen. Despite worries to the contrary, rebound pharyngitis following steroid therapy is rare and, when present, usually responds to a second course.5 However, the long-term consequences of prescribing steroids to patients infected with a virus that can survive in the tissues for years is unknown. EBV is especially worrisome because of its link to cancer; therefore, the clinician probably should avoid routinely prescribing steroids. Specific antiviral therapy with acyclovir, ganciclovir, and interferon- has no clinical benefit, although these drugs do reduce viral shedding.",

The relief obtained with immediate antibiotic treatment is generally small (usually 1\u00b0F of fever and a 13% improvement in sore throat) and delayed (at least 9 hours).33 Symptomatic support seems to provide excellent relief with or without immediate penicillin treatment.28 Although some experts fear that early treatment may predispose to a higher rate of recurrent GABHS pharyngitis, one major review16 suggests that this problem is unlikely.

A recent outbreak in Russia has led to diphtheria in citizens of the United States.48 After an incubation period of 2 to 4 days, it presents with a slowly worsening, mild sore throat and low-grade fever. The tonsillar or pharyngeal exudate is thick, membranous, and gray in appearance. Removal of the membrane reveals a bleeding surface. Victims develop weakness, prostration, cervical adenopathy, and swelling of the neck typical of a bull. The anterior nares often have a white membrane, and serosanguinous discharge is common. As the illness travels down into the larynx, respiratory stridor develops so that nonintubated patients become exhausted and die. Cardiac and neurologic toxicity are common. Fortunately, diphtheria is fully preventable through immunization. When coupled with supportive care, penicillin or erythromycin is an effective treatment. Diphtheria antitoxin is useful and available from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.",
