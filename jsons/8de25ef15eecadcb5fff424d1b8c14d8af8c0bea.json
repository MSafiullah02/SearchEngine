Two chydorid species were important in Grane Langs\u00a2 Late-glacial sands underlying the gyttja (Alana af]inis and Chydorus sphaericus). Chydorid faunas developed through the Pre-Boreal and early Boreal; by late Boreal chydorid populations were most diverse, and presumably stable. A decrease in species diversity during Atlantic time was due to unstable conditions within the lake, evidenced by deposition of sand; Chydorus piger was abundant during this period. Sub-Boreal organic deposits overlay the Atlantic sands. High percentages of Pleuroxus during mid-Sub-Boreal were attributed to man's activity, and a lower water level. The most recent change in chydorid assemblages occurred within the past 100 yrs; this change was increased percentages of Alonella nana-a species normally associated with low alkalinities in Denmark.",

These remains can be recovered easily from the sediments, usually in sufficient quantities for statistical analysis. The habits of present-day species have been studied by Fryer (1963, 1%8) , Smirnov (1962 , 1%3a, 1%3b, 1%4, 1966 ), and Fl,ossner ( 1967 and, except for a study by DeCosta ( 1964) , very little effort has been made to examine the regional relations between chydorid species and lake types. Furthermore, no attempts have been made to apply results of a regional study to paleolimnological interpretations of lake sediments from the same region. For these reasons, knowledgeable interpretations of a lake's past ecological condition, based on remains found in cores of lake sediment, are somewhat limited. This study explores some of the ecological relationships found between chydorid species and lake types in Denmark and applies the results to interpretations of cores of sediments from two Danish lakes.",

These lakes represent a wide spectrum of lake types, ranging from the highly oligotrophic Grane Langs\u00a2 to the \"ultra\" -eutrophic Fredriksborg Slots\u00a2 (Dunn, 1954) . Size ranges from small bogs and ponds to lakes as large as 4063 ha. The wide variety of lakes in a compact geographic area reduces those variables associated with latitude and altitude and eliminates some of the problems encountered by DeCosta ( 1964) , who worked over a latitudinal range of 17 degrees. Climate, a major factor in chydorid distributions (DeCosta, 1964 ; Harmsworth, 1968) , has been eliminated as a variable because of the relative uniform climatic conditions over the study area. This allows for a more informative approach to other factors important in the ecology of chydorids. Furthermore, since Danish lakes have been fairly well described by numerous limnologists (Table 1) , they are ideal for the study of present-day chydorid faunas.",

Approximately 5 g of sediment was heated in 5% KOH for 15-20 min on a hotplate equipped with a magnetic stirrer. The sample was then screened through a bronze 250-mesh screen to remove silts, clays, and KOH solution. A weak solution of HCl was then added to remove carbonates. The residue, which contained animal microfossils, plant fragments, and sand, was placed in a copper beaker, to which 5-10% HF was added. The beaker was heated on the hotplate for 5 min. This procedure removed a majority of the sand particles. Following a fin~l rinse in tap water through the screen, the residue was concentrated in vials to a volume of 15 mi. From this volume, which was equivalent to a known amount of sediment, 0.05-ml aliquots were transferred to slides and mounted in glycerine jelly beneath 22-mm coverslips. Counts of chydorids were made at a magnification of lOOX. Each remain, whether head shield, shell, or postabdomen, was counted as one animal. Each species is readily recognizable from any one of these parts. Listings of the relative abundances of the chydorids in each lake were punched on IBM cards for statistical analysis by the CDC 3600 computer at the Indiana University Research Computing Center.",

The lakes (Fig. 1 ) studied are located in Jutland and Zealand exclusively, between the parallels 54 \u00b005'N and 57o 4S'N and the meridians 8\u00b004'E and 12\u00b040'E. This is a total of approximately 40,000 km 2 \u2022 The eli-mate is normally milder than one would expect at this latitude due to the Gulf Stream, and only occasionally are harsh periods of continental climate felt. Annual precipitation is between SO and 75 em, with most of the precipitation from January to March in the form of snow. The relatively mild, wet climate, coupled with the uneven, rolling glacial topography of low relief, has given rise to numerous lakes.",

Wesenberg-Lund, 1940 A third group of lakes is found along the coastal margins. One of these, Fils\u00a2 ( 15), has already been mentioned. These lakes have complex origins. They all lie on postglacial marine deposits on landscapes recently uplifted from the sea. In some instances glacial deposits form a portion of the shoreline. Included in this group are the J utlandic lakes Blegs\u00a2 ( 5), Flade S\u00a2 (16), Nors S\u00a2 (51), Ove S\u00a2 (53), R1bjaerg S\u00a2 (57), Vester-Vanned S\u00a2 (76), and Denmarks largest lake, Arres\u00a2 (2). Of these lakes Jensen (1958) regards Blegs\u00a2, Nors S\u00a2, and Vester-Vanned S\u00a2 as karst lakes. This term is used with some reservation, for although the lakes are in contact with limestone bedrock, they are not typical of lakes found in karst regions. Their present configuration is controlled primarily by the recent glaciation and the postglacial marine deposits. Table 1 represents a compilation of physical, chemical, and biological data from many sources, supplemented in some instances by measurements made during July 1%5. The precision of these data depend on the source. Hence it is best not to rely on a single kind of measurement but to evaluate the lake from the composite of information provided. For more detailed information regarding any lake the reader is referred to the references given in Table 1 . The numbers arbitrarily assigned to each lake are consistent throughout the text, tables, and figures.",

The probability value of a lake indicates which group it is most like according to its discriminant score; one expects clear-water sites to have the highest probabilities of occurring in the clear-water group (Group 1), ponds and bogs to have the highest p-values in their group (Group 2), and polluted sites to have the largest p-values in the polluted lake group (Group 3).",

            "text": "A discriminant analysis, using a computer program slightly modified from Cooley and Lohnes ( 1962) by C. J. Krebs, was carried out on the 77 Danish lakes divided into the three groups. It is evident from an analysis of variance among these groups that differences do exist (Wilks' Lambda= 0.126, F = 17.6**, df = 14,136). The next step was to examine the nature of the differences among the groups. Those lake characters with the largest scaled vector values (calculated from the discriminant program) in Table 5 are the most important in differentiating among the lake groups. Since each group is defined along two discriminant axes, two scaled vector values are given for each character-one for each axis (I and II). In dimension I the order of decreasing importance of these characters is: d (scaled vector = 15.89), transparency, alkalinity, pH, depth, conductivity, and area (scaled (Table 5 ). This dimension of the discriminant analysis contributes the remaining 44% in defining the lake groups. A summation of the variables in the discriminant equation reduces the 7 parameters to two dimensions (I, II), and the points defined by the two discriminant scores can be plotted; this results in a clustering of points in three areas. Each lake was then scored according to its discriminant value, and a probability was assigned to indicate which discriminate group it resembles most. Table 6 summarizes the p-values of the TABLE 6. A summary of the results of the discriminant analysis on 77 Danish lakes, indicating how well the subjectively formed groups conform to the groups formed by the discriminant program (indicated from P values). Group 1 is the clear-water lakes, Group 2 the ponds and bogs, and Group 3 the polluted sites. A discussion in the text is included for those lakes not conforming to the 2 methods of grouping lakes for each group. In general a high degree of agreement is found between the lake group to which a lake was assigned subjectively and the probability of the lake occurring in that group according to the discriminant analysis. Of the clear- Table  5 ) in determining lake group and the low importance of area. Kalgaard S\u00a2, on the other hand, is one of those lakes difficult to classify : its low conductivity and alkalinity suggest a non-polluted site, but the relatively high d value indicates high phytoplanktonic biomass (see Species Analysis for further discussion of d). Within the pond and bog group (Group 2) Geddes\u00a2 (25), Hunds\u00a2 (38), and ~jes\u00a2 (77) had high probabilities in the clear-water group (Group 1). These lakes were probably put into Group 1 by the discriminant analysis because of their relatively high transparencies and the relatively low importance of area. Tuel S\u00a2 (74) was the only polluted lake with a high probability of belonging to another group (0.73, for clear-water lakes) ; a low d value from this site may have influenced this p value. The advantage of a discriminant analysis will be discussed more fully in Species Grouping; however, it is obvious from the foregoing that it enables one to define lake groups objectively and to assign a particular body of water to its most appropriate lake group. In the present study the lake groups were defined on the basis of seven lake parameters, and the placement of any body of water in a group implies conformitv within the range of the parameters (in toto) of that group. This step is a necessary prerequisite for any regional paleolimnological investigation. In essence it establishes a limnological frame of reference and attempts to remove some of the ambiguities associated with the use of more general terms. Frey ( 1960) suggested a method with which a complete chydorid species list could be recovered from bottom sediments of a lake with a minimum of time and effort. By this method, a total of 35 species was recovered from the surficial sediments of Danish lakes, including three not previously reported from the country-Alona intermedia Sars. A. protzi Hartwig, and Chydorus latus Sars. The remaining 32 species have been previously reported by either Muller ( 1867), Poulsen ( 1928 ), or Berg ( 1929 . Three species-Burycercus glacialis Lilljeborg, reported by Berg ( 1945) from a collection of Boisen Bennike, Chydorus gibbus Lilljeborg, reported by Berg ( 1929) , and C. oval is Kurz, reported by Poulsen ( 1928)-were not recovered from the surficial sediments, nor were they found in net samples collected during July 1965; nevertheless, a discussion of these species is included in the Species Analysis.",

The best criterion for distinguishing between the two is the d value. Humic waters have low transparencies and correspondingly low d values (usually less than 10), whereas highly productive waters have low transparencies and high d values. Further distinctions among these lake types can be made by comparing conductivity, alkalinity, and pH values (Table 1) ; highly productive lakes generally have higher values for these parameters then humic-water lakes.",

Conductivity is directly related to several water characteristics, most important of which is salinity. Except for Flade Sjl! ( 16), which is adjacent to the North Sea, the Danish lakes are not unusual in their alkaline-earth components, so that calcium content is most important in determining conductivity values. In the three groups of Danish lakes, high conductivity is consistently associated with high alkalinity, and low conductivity with low alkalinity (Tables 2-4) . Any significant positive correlation of a species with conductivity suggests a tolerance of saline conditions; however, the total range of conductivity is not extremely high, and therefore such correlations have limited biological information. On the other hand, many of the Danish lakes have fairly low conductivities. A significant negative correlation of a species with conductivity suggests that the species prefers certain conditions associated with sites having low conductivities, i.e., low alkalinities.",

For example, Alana quadrangularis has its highest average abundance (13.0%) in clear-water lakes yet occurs with a higher frequency ( 1.00) in polluted lakes. Such a species is regarded as being most abundant in clear-water lakes but also as being tolerant of polluted conditions.

It would be meaningless to calculate the relative average abundance of these species because of their low abundance; therefore, only frequency and preference values have been calculated. A preference value is the number of occurrences of a species in a group of lakes divided by the total number of occurrences of that species.

Berg ( 1929) stated that this species occurs in puddles, peatbogs, small and large ponds, and in the littoral of lakes; he suggested its preferred habitat is the littoral zone. Poulsen (1928) put A. harpae into pH group III (7.1-7.9) but reported that it is fairly abundant in all groups. Berg ( 1948) reported this species from the littoral vegetation along the Susaa River and also in the \"mud fauna\" from this river. In the present study it was found in 65 lakes. Judg-ing from its significant negative correlations with d, conductivity, pH, and alkalinity (Table 7) , this species should be most common in low-productivity lakes, ponds, and bogs. It is evident from data in Table 8 that A. harpae is most common in ponds and bogs and secondarily in clear-water lakes; its abundance and frequency are notably low in the polluted lake group. A. harpae is a common component of the Danish chydorid fauna, present at many sites, but it occurs most abundantly at those localities characterized by low production, pH, conductivity, and alkalinity.",

Poulsen ( 1928) Ecological Monographs Vol. 40, No. 1 puts it with the lowest pH group. It was also reported by Berg (1948) , R\u00a2en (1954) , and Frey (1%2) from Denmark. G. testudinaria was most abundant and most frequent in ponds and bogs (Table 8) , and although it does occur at enriched sites, its average abundance at these localities was very low ( .5%). The highly significant negative correlation of this species with d, and significant negative correlations with conductivity and pH support these conclusions (Table 7) . The significant negative correlation between G. testudinaria and transparency suggests that the abundance of this species decreases as non-triptoncontrolled transparency increases. This correlation reflects the high abundance of this species in bog waters. Leydigia leydigi ( Schodler) was previously reported from Denmark by Muller (1867, Alana leydigi), Berg ( 1929 Berg ( , 1948 , Frey (1%2), and Johnsen et al. ( 1%2) . Berg ( 1929) stated that L. leydigi is a pronounced bottom form. Its greatest average abundance was in ponds and bogs, but it was most frequent in polluted lakes. One may conclude that the most favorable conditions for this species occur in ponds and bogs, but because it is a bottom dweller it may be frequent at polluted localities.",

The greatest average abundance of A. guttata was in the clear-water lakes, and it was most frequent in ponds and bogs (Table 8) . The greater average abundance of this species at clear-water sites was due to its relatively high abundance at two clear-water lakes-Alminds\u00a2 ( 1), and, Thors\u00a2 (71 )-where percentages were 4.1 and 5.1, respectively. A. guttata probably is found mainly in ponds and bogs, and since it is positively correlated with transparency it is most common in ponds (i.e., species abundance increases with transparency, whereas if it were more abundant at bogs the species abundance would be negatively correlated with transparency).",

Poulsen ( 1928) placed this species in pH group II ( 6.1-7.0) . It is evident from the data in Tables 7 and 8 that this animal is most abundant in ponds and bogs and waters of low productivity.",

D. rostrata was most abundant in Thors\u00a2 (7.0tfo), but generally it was present in the surficial sediments in low relative abundances.

Its greatest abundance was 12.31j'o at the Jutlandic lake of Snabe-Igels\u00a2 (64). Fryer (1968) believes this species is best adapted for benthic existence.",

From these reports it appears that C. latus is most frequent at bog sites, and it may be restricted to such waters. P seudochydorus globosus Baird (formerly Chydorus globosus-See Fryer, 1968), although reported by Berg ( 1929) to occur sometimes in considerable numbers, was relatively low in abundance (Table 8) , never exceeding 3.0% in any lake. It had previously been reported from Denmark by Muller ( 1867), Poulsen ( 1928) , Berg and Peterson (1956) , and Frey (1962) . P. globosus is a scavenger (Fryer, 1968) and is capable of surviving at all sites. It seems to have a preference for ponds and bogs, and of the 9 occurrences in Denmark 6 were at ponds and bogs (Table 9 ). This species was not found in Esrom S\u00a2 ( 13), Store Gribs\u00a2 (29), Silkeborg Langs\u00a2 (59), or Sor\u00a2 S\u00a2 (67), in all of which Berg ( 1929) collected the species.",

The advantages of using discriminant analysis, which emphasizes the differences in species composition between lake groups, are analogous to those in forming lake groups, i.e., 1) the multivariate null hypothesis that the means of the 3 lake groups are the same for all 22 chydorid species was tested, 2) indi- vidual F -ratios were calculated for each species, 3) scaled vector values were assigned to each species, 4) group centroids were calculated and plotted, and 5) probability values were assigned to species associations from each lake based on its discriminant score. Because the data were in the form of relative percentages (proportions), an arcsine transformation was performed on the raw data prior to discriminant analysis. This procedure produces an approximately constant variance within each variable (species) . There were no reasons a priori for anticipating that differences might exist among the chydorid associations of the 3 lake groups, but with the data available from Table 8 one might suspect differences between polluted and non-polluted sites. Likewise, there was no reason to expect differences between the clear-water lakes and the ponds and bogs, but the results of the analysis of variance between groups indicate differences do exist (Wilks' Lambda = 0.111, F = 4.84**, df = 44, 106). Table 10 The rankings of discriminant II are somewhat different, with Alonella excisa ( -0.31), Alonella exigua ( -0.27), and Alona rectangula (0.26) assuming some importance on this axis. It is evident if one plots the centroids for each group that the scaled vectors along discriminant I are more important in distinguishing Group 2 from Groups 1 and 3, i.e., there is not a large difference in discriminant I values between 1 and 3, but there is between 1 and 3 versus 2 (Centroids : Group 1, I = 21.9, II = -4.3; Group 2, I = 37.7, II = 3.9; Group 3, I = 16.5, II = 8.6).

This measure takes into account numbers of individuals within the sample as well as numbers of species (Lloyd & Ghelardi, 1964) . Biologically, one may equate diversity of chydorids to the complexity of their associations. This complexity is divisible into three areas (or habitats) of a lake: the littoral vegetation, and especially the submergent rooted aquatics, the littoral benthonic (including the entire bottom of shallower lakes), and the limnetic area. Experience from collecting chydorids suggest that the littoral vegetation is the most suitable habitat for most species in this family; of secondary importance is the sediment-water interface, in which are found some of the larger species (Alana affinis, A. quadrangularis, Leydigia leydigi, and Disparalana rastrata). Two species may be found in the limnetic area ( Chydarus sphaericus and Alana rectangula); these species are not freeswimming, but probably use the planktonic algae as a feeding substrate. Hence the species diversity of chydorids reflects the approximate suitability of these three habitats.",

In lakes with low phytoplankton production, species diversity is always high, while in enriched lakes the values of species diversity are consistently low. A highly significant difference exists between the means of species diversity of the three lake groups (clear-water lakes, X: = 2.72 ; ponds and bogs, x = 3.01; polluted lakes, x = 1.50; F = 33.32**, df = 2, 74). The major source of difference is between Group 2 and 3 (LSR. 05 = 1.45 < 1.51*), and an observable difference exists between Groups 1 and 3. had shown a relationship between trophic level and depth to which macrophytes grow, as well as an association of certain plant types with different levels of production. These findings help explain the negative correlation of chydorid diversity and trophic level. In the more polluted lakes (high phytoplanktonic production), a lesser variety of rooted aquatics is found, thus decreasing available habitat for the bulk of chydorid species. If we assume that chydorid distributions, as with other animals studied from this approach (MacArthur & Mac-Arthur, 1961; Pianka, 1967) , are governed primarily by the diversity of available habitat, then a dependence on macrophytic vegetational structure is expected. Therefore, in strongly polluted sites [e.g., Fredriksborg Slots\u00a2 ( 18), Pedersborg S\u00a2 (54), and Sjl!llerjl!d S\u00a2 ( 69)] one would expect to find the lowest Shannon-Weaver values (H).",

The relationship between species diversity and production has already been discussed (Whiteside & Harmsworth, 1967) , and Harmsworth & Whiteside ( 1968) have presented evidence suggesting there is no relationship between cladoceran abundance and phytoplanktonic productivity. Hence there seems to be no correlation between phytoplankton productivity and numbers of chydorid remains in sediments, but there is an inverse relationship between phytoplanktonic production and species diversity. A paradox still exists, however, in that in more cores studied the diversity and abundance of chydorids are usually positively correlated, whereas they are not in modern assemblages (Harms worth & Whiteside, 1968) .",

It is apparent from the distribution of chydorid species over the range of lake types represented from the study area that chydorids have a wide range cif tolerance to various chemical conditions. Patterns do emerge, however, when one considers not just their presence or absence but also their relative abundances.

The earliest deposits (below 431 em) were sand from late-glacial streams. Alona affinis and Chydorus sphaericus were the two most important species found in this sand, along with Alona quadrangularis, Acroperus harpae, and Alonella nana. Most likely these assemblages were remnants of populations from small, temporary ponds within the basis. These ponds were not suitable for development of littoral vegetation and stable lake conditions. The chydorid counts from the gyttja at 430 em and upward to 410 em represent the true pioneer species at Grane Langs\u00a2-Alonella nana ( 30%), Chydorus sphaericus (25%), Alona a/finis ( lOo/a), A. quadrangularis (9%) , and A. rectangula and Acroperus harpae ( 6 % ) . The bottom dwellers and limnetic species (Table 13 , Section I) make up 77% of the chydorids at 420 em and 68% at FIG. 6. The relationship between the most common chydorid species of the Eemian interglacial to the most common species occurring in Denmark today. Spearman's rank correlation coefficient ( +0.86) is highly significant, indicating that the species common then are common today. This correlation supports the hypothesis that chydorid species are ecologically stable. 410 em, and the lake habitat probably lacked rooted aquatics. This lack could have been the result of lower transparencies due to high organic content in the lake water. An analogy to a present-day site is difficult, but certainly these early chydorid communities are similar to those found in some Danish ponds today. For example, Rabaerg S\u00a2 (57, Table 1 , Fig. 2 ), a pond located northwest of Aalbaek at the northern tip of Jutland, has a very similar chydorid fauna. This pond lies in a sand dune region and has no surface outlet.",

This may be due to analytical error or to redeposition of carbon from older sediments. A decrease in precipitation during the Sub-Boreal could result in re-deposition in the benthos of older lake deposits exposed along the lake's margin. This explanation is supported by large pieces of vegetation incorporated in the sediment at 157-177 em. A lower water level might thus explain the anomalous dates and also have an en-richment effect upon Grane Langs\u00a2. Man's activities in the lake's environs would add to the enrichment during this period. Kaj Hansen ( 1%5, Fig. 7 ) has also concluded that Grane Langs\u00a2 was more productive during the Sub-Boreal. Hence, the increase in Pleura:cus triganellus is attributed to increased productivity in the lake. The occurrence of P. triganellus from other sections of the core, mentioned earlier, are also interpreted as indications of enriched conditions. Above 145 em is zone 4c, which is similar to 4a. The increase of Alana rectangula at 80 em is interpreted as a phase of increased production. The date of 1600 years ago for this last eutrophication phase is estimated from a sedimentation rate of 0.53 mm/yr. Zone 4c extends up to 50 em, a level correlated with pollen zone IX.",

The fluctuations of the diversity values can be related to 1) lithologic changes in the sediments, i.e., lower values in sandy layers, and 2) changes in the lake which were not noticeable in the gross stratigraphy but which are recorded as faunal shifts. The latter changes in species diversity may be termed biotic shifts. They occur at 80 em, in faunal zone 4c, and at 410-430 em. Low diversities at 80 em were interpreted as a result of increased lake production. The changes at 410-420 em suggest an environment lacking rooted aquatics. ESROM S\u00a2 INTRODUCTION Esrom S\u00a2 ( 13), Denmark's second largest lake, with an area of 1730 ha, is situated northwest of Hiller\u00a2d, on the island of Zealand. The lake extends north-south, occupying a basin in the morainal topography adjacent to Gribskov forest. Esrom S\u00a2 has few bays or peninsulas and has rather steep shores, so rooted aquatic vegetation is scarce. The lake basin is characterized by a regular slope and by an extensive and flat lake floor, without submergent banks or depressions (J6nasson & Mathiesen, 1959) . There are no large streams serving Esrom, and Berg ( 1938) calculated a residence time of 7.5 years for Esrom water. STRATIGRAPHY It was not possible to sample effectively the upper 50 em with a Livingstone corer; these sediments were sampled with a stratified bottom sampler designed for Esrom S\u00a2 (Berg, 1938, p. 157) . Maximum penetration of the sediments was to 881 em, where glacial till was encountered (Fig. 8) . Above the till (840-380 em) was calcareous clay, followed by calcareous gyttja ( 380 em to the top). Lithologic analyses conducted by Kaj Hansen ( 1968) are outlined below.",

For this reason the results of discriminant analysis were useful. At all but four values, P-values placed the chydorid assemblages in Group 1 (clear-water lakes).

The shift of littoral to benthic chydorid species at about 170 em (Fig. 9) represents a shift towards the subgroup of Group 1 (Fig. 2) . This shift was marked by the steadily increasing percentages of Alana affinis and A. quadrangularis and by the decrease of Alonella exigua, G. testudinaria, Alonopsis elongata and R. falcata; the last two species are important littoral components of clear-water lakes (Fig. 2) .",

The chydorid development of Grane Lang-s\u00a2 was found to be very sensitive to climatic or cultural change, because of the delicate chemical balance of the lake. In Esrom, fossil chydorid assemblages varied little, because of the dampening effect of morphology of the basin and the relative chemical stability of Esrom's lake water.

In Esrom, where the effect of climate was negligible, the discriminant analysis was an effective tool. Multiple discriminant analysis is useful if all factors determining distribution and abundance of chydorids are realized and incorporated into the function. Un- der such conditions objective conclusions can be made concerning past lake conditions. Multiple discriminant analysis is analogous to the niche hypervolume (Hutchinson, 1957) , in which the parameters used to generate the discriminant function form the dimensions of the hypervolume. The more accurate an investigator pinpoints the important factors (abiotic and biotic) affecting distribution and abundance of organisms (and uses these factors to generate the discriminant function), the more accurate will be the description of that organism's niche. Thus multiple discriminant analysis provides a framework for an orderly analysis of a species' niche. Furthermore, the discriminating planes (discriminant axes I & II) will maximize differences among groups (species). Alterations of the parameters used to describe the function change the relative importance of each parameter (scaled vector) so that, by altering these parameters, one can gain more insight into the relative importance of each variable operating under varying ecological conditions. Sedimentation rates, based on pollen zonation, can be estimated for both lakes. In Grane Langs\u00a2 the gyttja, 430-357 em, represents a time interval 9500-7500 yrs BP, with a sedimentation rate of 0.37 /mmjyr. The sand gyttja contact ( 357 em) may be analogous to contacts of sand-peat from neighboring peatbogs (Jesson, 1939) . The 90 em of sand covers the time interval 7500-5000 yrs BP (Atlantic time), or 0.36 mmjyr. The upper gyttja has the greatest sedimentation rate, 0.53 mm/yr.",

If one wishes to study chydorid community development, then he should choose a lake in which maximum development of chydorids can be expected-such a lake was Grane Langs\u00a2. On the other hand, if the lake is the focus of the study, a decision has to be made as to whether the chydorid data add greatly to information, or will some other fossil type-such as diatoms or midges-reflect changes in lake history more effectively. Chydorids are valuable indicators of littoral development, and much information can be gained concerning the history of a lake's littoral zone.

The main point of contention is whether the boundary (represented by declines in elm and lime pollen) was the result of climatic or cultural influences. The data from Esrom and Grane Langs\u00a2 suggest that a climate amelioration occurred during the Sub-Boreal. This amelioration was reflected in Esrom Lake by increased diatom production (Fig. 8; Foged, 1968 ) and by greater littoral development (evidenced by chydorids, Fig. 9 ). At Grane Langs\u00a2 the shift from sand to gyttja deposits marks the transition of pollen zones VII-VIII; this marker is not likely to be the result of cultural activities, as it occurs at several Jutlandic sites. In addition, chydorid assemblages are most diverse and most stable during the Sub-Boreal (with the exception of faunal zone 4b), thus suggesting ideal growing conditions within the lake. Hence, the evidence from these lakes supports a climatic change for the zone boundary.",

Harmsworth (1968) found Alana affinis and Alanella nana the most important component of late-glacial Blelham Tarn (England), and Alanella nana and Acraperus harpae the pioneers from postglacial sediments. In Grane Langs\u00a2, late-glacial sands had primarily Alana affinis and Chydarus sphaericus present, while in the first organic sediments of the postglacial sediments chydorids species ranked Alane/la nana,, Chydarus sphaericus, Alana affinis, A. quadrangularis, and Acraperus harpae. Postglacial pioneer species at Esrom were mainly Acraperus harpae and Chydarus sphaericus; Alanella nana reached peak abundance during early phases in Esrom's history. The generalizations drawn from these observations are that the principal pioneer species of lakes are Chydarus sphaericus, Alanella nana, Alana affinis, Acraperus harpae, and Alana quadrangularis. Furthermore, Alanella nana is consistently the most important chydorid species in those lakes with low nutrients (Blelham Tarn and Grane Langs\u00a2). Present-day distributions of this species in Denmark (Section I) have shown this species to be more prevalent in nutrient-poor waters. With the exception of Alanella nana, all pioneer species are fairly cosmopolitan. If, as Quade ( 1969) suggests, chydorid species are associated with floristic groups, the consistency of these pioneer species may be related to initial aquatic succession during early lake history.",
