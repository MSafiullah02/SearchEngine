            "text": "Pneumonia, sepsis and trauma are among the most common causes of acute lung injury or acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) [1]. Severe trauma is generally accompanied by various injuries, including traumatic lung injury, leading to posttraumatic ARDS in some patients [2]. Major trauma-induced lung injury is associated with mortality rates as high as 50\u201380% due to direct consequences of the injury or secondary effects, such as hypoxemia and respiratory acidosis, including the injured brain [3]. Previous reports have described the efficacy of ECMO support in adult trauma patients with ARDS [4] and trauma patients with severe lung injury [5]. Traditionally, trauma patients have a high risk of bleeding and thus have not been considered suitable candidates for ECMO due to the limited experience of the attending medical practitioners. Accordingly, the utility of ECMO in trauma patients remains unclear.",

However, since June 2010, the Centrifugal Rotaflow Pump\u00ae (Maquet Inc., Hirrlingen, Germany) has been used for most patients [6]. VV ECMO or VA ECMO were cannulated percutaneously using the Seldinger technique under fluoroscopic guidance in a cardiac catheterization laboratory or hybrid operating room in the emergency department. Arterial cannulae (17\u201321 Fr) and venous cannulae (17\u201328 Fr; DLP and Bio-Medicus, Medtronic, Minneapolis, MN, USA; RMI, Edward\u2019s Lifesciences LLC, Irvine, CA, USA) were used depending on the patient\u2019s size. The initial gas and blood flow rates were 4\u20136 and 3\u20135 L/min, respectively, to maintain an oxygen saturation (SaO2) > 90%. During ECMO support, heparin or nafamostat mesilate (SK Chemicals Life Science Biz., Seoul, Korea; licensed by Torii Pharmaceutical, Tokyo, Japan) was used for anticoagulation, with a target activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT) of 60\u201380 s [7]. Anticoagulation was usually initiated after confirmed bleeding control was achieved for 48 h in patients with a high risk of bleeding or those who underwent surgery. The following mechanical ventilator settings were applied initially: tidal volume, 4\u20136 mL/kg; PEEP, 4\u20138 cm H2O; respiration rate, 10/min and FiO2, 0.21\u20130.6. Blood transfusions were administered as packed red blood cells (RBCs) with hemoglobin concentration < 8\u201310 g/dL, fresh frozen plasma (FFP) with an international normalized ratio (INR) > 2.0, platelet concentrate with a count of < 50,000/\u03bcL, or cryoprecipitate with a fibrinogen concentration of < 150 mg/dl.",

The IS have been used in clinical research as measures of illness severity in patients undergoing congenital heart surgery [8]. Several studies showed that the VIS, which indicates the amount of cardiovascular support by various inotropes or vasopressors, was independently predictive of clinical outcomes in patients who underwent cardiac surgery and in sepsis patiets [9]. The SAPS II and SOFA are severity scores and mortality estimation tools that were developed for patients in medical or surgical ICUs [10]. We also recorded the ECMO durations and weaning rates, transfusion and complication rates and all outcomes. All data obtained during ECMO support were compared between survivors and non-survivors. All results are presented as numbers with percentages for categorical variables, and as medians with interquartile ranges (IQRs) for continuous variables. The Mann\u2013Whitney U test or repeated-measure analysis of variance (ANOVA) was used to compare continuous variables, whereas the chi-squared or Fisher\u2019s exact test was used to compare categorical variables.",

            "text": "Trauma patients with severe injuries are at risk of ARDS via direct and indirect causes, including lung contusions, aspiration pneumonia, massive blood transfusion and fat embolism syndrome [11]. ARDS remains a common post-traumatic complication and is diagnosed in 6.5% of patients requiring mechanical ventilation for > 48 h [12]. If optimal ventilator strategies and adjunctive measures fail to yield improvement, ECMO might be considered to provide temporary respiratory or cardiac support in patients with cardiopulmonary failure and to allow the lungs to rest through manipulation the ventilator settings and the concentration of inspired oxygen while maintaining appropriate oxygenation, carbon dioxide removal, and tissue perfusion [13]. However, this potentially life-saving intervention is not without complications. Bleeding and thrombotic complications are the major causes of ECMO-associated morbidity and mortality [14]. The use of anticoagulant therapy is recommended to prevent thrombosis during ECMO support, however, the risk of thromboembolic complications must be balanced with the risk of bleeding. Accordingly, the use of ECMO in trauma patients is limited by the high risk of hemorrhage during and after cannulation, particularly in the presence of severe coagulopathy, contraindications to anticoagulant treatment and the risk of intracranial hemorrhage following traumatic brain injury. However, technological advances have significantly improved the characterizations of bleeding profiles. Arlt et al. [15] reported that the delayed use of heparin in 10 trauma patients did not lead to any adverse thrombotic events. Moreover, a case series described 3 cases involving delayed heparin administration due to traumatic hemorrhage and/or brain injury [16], with times to heparinization after cannulation ranging from 24 h to 5 days. All the patients survived to discharge, and only 1 experienced a thrombotic complication (IVC clots) that was resolved by heparinization after decannulation.",

Ried et al. [17] evaluated 26 patients who received VV ECMO for severe trauma-related respiratory failure after mean 2.6 days of pre-ECMO ventilation and reported an 81% survival rate. Another study reported an overall survival rate of 56% among 176 patients supported with VV ECMO, and the best survival rate among trauma patients with a pre-ECMO ventilation interval of 4 days (71%, 10/14 patients) [18]. Similarly, we calculated an overall survival rate of 81% (n = 34) in our cohort of 42 patients, 29 (69%) of whom were supported with VV ECMO. Both survivors and non-survivors received pre-ECMO ventilation for 1 day. We observed associations of the pre-ECMO VIS and SAPSII with mortality during ECMO support, consistent with our previous observation of the former as an important predictor of mortality in patients receiving ECMO support in emergency departments [6]. Therefore, we suggest that a preexisting severity scoring system may be useful for predicting mortality in trauma patients. However, the SOFA score had limited utility in our study population.",

In the patients with acute respiratory failure due to traumatic lung injury or posttraumatic ARDS, the VV ECMO application is the most common due to hypoxia and accounted for 69% (n = 29) in this present study. In other cases, VA ECMO (n = 7, 16.7%) was applied when the circulatory failure was main problem than hypoxia, and VAV ECMO (n = 6, 14.3%) was applied when both the lungs and the heart was main problem and needed assistance at the same time. It is commonly known that the mortality increases when two organs are involved rather than one. Furthermore, the 2020 Extracorporeal Life Support Organization Registry reported that the rate of survival to discharge in the patients with pulmonary support was higher than those with cardiac support or extracorporeal cardiopulmonary resuscitation (60% versus 43 and 29%). Similarly, VV ECMO was also associated with better survival outcomes than other types of ECMO support in the present study. We attribute the reasons of these results to be high severity of injuries and hazard statuses of patients receiving other types of ECMO, who usually require cardiac and pulmonary support. Guirand et al. [20] reported an independent association between VV ECMO support and survival in adult trauma patients, regardless of the transfusion requirement or complications due to the frequency of bleeding. Similarly, VV ECMO was also associated with better survival outcomes vs. other types of ECMO support. We attribute this finding to the severity of injuries and hazard statuses of patients receiving other types of ECMO, who usually require cardiac and pulmonary support.",
