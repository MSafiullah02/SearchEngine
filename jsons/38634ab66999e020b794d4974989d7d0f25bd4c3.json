The present study is aimed at providing a simple algebraic analysis of the trend that is evident in the spread of the disease in this part of the world. The purpose of this algebraic approach is to simplify the calculation sufficiently by deviating from the standard techniques that are conventionally used to construct mathematical models of epidemics. The predictions, obtained from this algebraic study, are found to be in reasonable agreement with the recorded data. Using this mathematical formulation we have determined the time variation of the number of asymptomatic patients, who are believed to play a major role in spreading the disease. We have discussed the effect of lockdown in reducing the rate of transmission of the disease. On the basis of the proposed models, predictions have been made regarding the possible trend of the rise in the number of cases beyond the withdrawal of lockdown. All these things have been calculated by using very simple mathematical expressions which can be easily understood and used by those who have a rudimentary knowledge of algebra.",

            "text": "In early December 2019, a cluster of cases of pneumonia had been reported in Wuhan, Hubei province of China. A few days later, the health authorities of that country declared that this cluster was associated with a newly discovered coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) and the infectious disease caused by it was named coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) by the World Health Organization (WHO) [1, 2] . This outbreak of novel coronavirus pneumonia has been declared a public health emergency of international concern by WHO. As of 6:37 pm CEST, 10 May 2020, there have been 3,925,815 confirmed cases of COVID-19, including 274,488 deaths, reported to WHO globally [3] . According to WHO, no pharmaceutical products have yet been shown to be safe and effective for the treatment of COVID-19. Invitro studies have shown that chloroquine, an immune-modulant drug, which has been traditionally used for the treatment of malaria, is effective in reducing viral replication in infections including the SARS-associated coronavirus (CoV) and MERS-CoV [4, 5] . It has been revealed by the current studies that respiratory symptoms of COVID-19 such as fever, dry cough and dyspnea are the most common manifestations, quite similar to severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) in 2003 and Middle East respiratory syndrome in 2012 (MERS), which firmly indicates the droplet transmission and contact transmission of the virus. Apart from the typical respiratory disorder, there are less common features like diarrhea, nausea, vomiting, and abdominal discomfort that have been found significantly in different degrees among different study populations [6] . Recent evidences have revealed that COVID-19 virus is transmitted between people through respiratory droplets and contact routes [7] [8] [9] [10] [11] . Transmission through droplets takes place when a person is in close contact (within 1 metre) with another person, who has developed respiratory symptoms (coughing or sneezing) due to COVID-19 infection, and is thereby at risk of having his/her mucosae (mouth and nose) or conjunctiva (eyes) exposed to potentially infective respiratory droplets (which are generally known to be greater than 5-10 \u03bcm in diameter). Droplet transmission can also occur through fomites in the immediate vicinity around the infected person [12] . Thus, the transmission of the virus that causes COVID-19 can occur by direct contact with an infected person and indirect contact with surfaces in his/her immediate environment or with the objects that have been used on the infected person (e.g. stethoscope or thermometer). Airborne transmission of the virus is not the same as droplet transmission. It is caused by the microbes within droplet nuclei, which are generally like particles less than 5\u03bcm in diameter, and which are released by the evaporation of larger droplets or exist within dust particles. These particles may remain in the air for long periods of time and they can be transmitted to persons over distances greater than 1 metre [13] .",

It was a dynamical model which was based on a differential equation that was formulated to find the time variation of the number of asymptomatic patients, from which, the number of symptomatic cases was estimated. In the present study, we have constructed the entire mathematical structure upon a simple algebraic equation. The purpose of choosing this method is to make the article comprehensible to the policy makers of the country who come from various educational backgrounds. The models that are based on calculus lead to very accurate results or predictions but they are sometimes very difficult to understand for those who are not sufficiently trained in mathematics. In most of the cases, the conventional models do not lead to mathematical expressions from which predictions can be made. One needs to do numerical calculations (rather than analytical) to arrive at a prediction. In view of the severity and urgency of the crisis caused by COVID-19 outbreak, mathematical models should be created in a simple way so that the can be easily understood, amended or modified if necessary and applied extensively by the persons who are responsible for decision making regarding infrastructural arrangements and also the formulation and implementation of rules to be imposed upon the society to ensure social distancing. The calculations involved in the present study are extremely simple in comparison to the ones where one needs to solve a set of coupled differential equations keeping under consideration various factors connected to the society and the constraints of the actual situations caused by the pandemic and the measures to control it.",

Like our previously published article, which was based on calculus, this model has an underlying assumption that, due to the lack of tests in sufficient numbers, the statistics regarding the number of patients infected, as declared by the government, are actually about the number of symptomatic patients. After detection, most of them are put under isolation, during which they are not much capable of spreading the disease to other persons. Therefore, the asymptomatic carriers can be regarded as the main agents of transmission of the virus in the society. The present study is based on three models whose unknown parameters have been determined by fitting these models to the actual data of COVID-19 infections in India. For this purpose we have used the statistics of the number of infected persons in India, during the period from 01 March 2020 to 03 May 2020, obtained from the government sources [14] . Using these three models we have determined the time evolution of the number of infected persons over this period. We have graphically shown the positive impact of the imposition of lockdown throughout the country. The present study makes predictions regarding the number of infected cases beyond 17 May 2020, the date up to which the lockdown will continue as per the last announcement made on 01 May 2020. These models show very clearly that a high degree of social distancing has to be maintained to slow down or prevent the transmission of the disease in the country.",

It has been assumed here that lockdown won't continue beyond 17 May 2020. Here for 01 March 2020. Figure 13 shows the time evolution of the number of asymptomatic patients from Model-1, for three values of the parameter b, over a period of 100 days, where lockdown continues from the 25 th day onwards. These three values of b are smaller than the value obtained by fitting this model to the recorded data (Fig. 1) . A smaller value of b means greater degree of strictness in enforcing the lockdown. This figure shows that, for a sufficiently small value of b, starts decreasing just after the imposition of lockdown. Figure 14 shows the time evolution of the number of symptomatic patients from Model-1, for three values of the parameter b, over a period of 100 days, where lockdown continues from the 25 th day onwards. These three values of b are smaller than the value obtained by fitting this model to the recorded data (Fig. 1) . A smaller value of b means a greater degree of social distancing in the lockdown. This figure shows that, for a sufficiently small value of b, the slope of starts decreasing just after the imposition of lockdown, approaching gradually a .

This cannot be entirely true under the present circumstances. The infection in the body of a person, who has developed some symptoms, can remain undiagnosed mainly due to two reasons. One of the reasons is that some of the symptoms are very much similar to those of other diseases (caused by influenza viruses). The other reason is obviously the lack of testing facilities in the country. This method of algebraic study or prediction can be improved by taking into consideration the role played by the symptomatic patients in the transmission of the disease. Another aspect, which has a plenty of scope for modification, is the functional form of of equation (6) . Apart from the three choices, in this regard, described in the sections 2.1-2.3, there can be many other functions that can represent the time dependence of this parameter. We have chosen the simplest ones. A limitation of this calculation is that the values of the parameters a and b, have been assumed to remain constant over the normal (i.e. pre/postlockdown) period and the lockdown period respectively. In reality, the social mixing or distancing patterns may vary frequently with time during a pandemic. In spite of such limitations, the predictions from these models are in reasonable agreement with the actual records, for a certain set of parameter values. Based on this set, the most important finding of the present study is actually a message that social distancing has to be maintained as stringently as possible, which is quite evident from the Figures 13-18 . The value of the parameter b, which is an indicator of social distancing during lockdown, needs to be sufficiently decreased, to cause to fall with time and also to get a flat curve for .",
