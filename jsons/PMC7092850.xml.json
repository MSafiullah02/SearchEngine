We found three sets of hydrogen bond bridges which seemed to fix the complex effectively. The bridge consisted of three hydrogen bonds of Y638O\u03b7\u2013H564N\u03b41, H564N\u03b52\u2013E560O\u03b41 and E560O\u03b42\u2013Q650N\u03b52, and three of the bridges enclosed the complex on its surface. The alignment of functional groups in the bridge was seemed to be similar to the charge relay system of serine protease active sites. In the structure of the MT-4/LAI NHR\u2013CHR complex, shown in Fig. 1B, only E560O\u03b42\u2013Q650N\u03b52 was formed and Y638O\u03b7\u2013H564N\u03b41 and H564N\u03b52\u2013E560O\u03b41 were not formed. Especially, the phenyl ring of Y638 and the imidazole ring of H564 existed side by side, but O\u03b7 and N\u03b41 or N\u03b52 were not placed where they could form a hydrogen bond. The sidechain of H564 in the MT-4/17-3-6 complex shifted slightly to the outer side of the complex compared with the MT-4/LAI complex, and it was thought that the formation of hydrogen bonds of Y638O\u03b7\u2013H564 N\u03b41 and H564N\u03b52\u2013E560O\u03b41 was enable by this shift.

In the MT-4/17-3-6 complex, hydrogen bonds were formed in the conformation with probabilities of 82.3% and 59.7% for Y638O\u03b7\u2013H564N\u03b41 and H564N\u03b52\u2013E560O\u03b41 respectively, which are very high probabilities compared with these for MT-4/LAI. Just beside H564, the L565M mutation was found in MT-4/17-3-6 compared with MT-4/LAI. In the MT-4/LAI complex, as shown by dark blue and green sticks in Fig. 2, the L565 sidechain contacted CHR sidechains of I635 and I642 by hydrophobic interaction, and this interaction was fixed tightly by the existence of a hydrogen bond between Q567 and T639. On the other hand, in the MT-4/17-3-6 complex, as shown by orange and yellow sticks, a longer hydrophobic sidechain of M565 existed instead of the shorter sidechain of leucine. Two isoleucines, glutamine and threonine in the MT-4/17-3-6 complex remained at the same positions in the MT-4/LAI complex and fixed the sidechain of methionine. In addition, the I635 residue, especially its sidechain, was close to the sidechain of M565 because of loss of the branched structure in the sidechain L565.",

As shown in detail in Fig. 2, the structural difference from the MT-4/LAI complex in this region was that the M565 mainchain and the H564 of NHR were pushed to the outer side (from dark blue to orange) and the neighboring Y638 and T639 of CHR were shifted to the opposite direction (from green to yellow). As a result, the imidazole ring of H564 in the MT-4/17-3-6 complex was placed in the position and direction where it could be stabilized by hydrogen bonds with both Y638 in the CHR region and E560 in the same NHR region.",

As shown in Table 1, E630Q, S641G, and N651I mutations were found distinctively in the CHR region of MT-4/17-3-6, but all of these residues were placed on the outer side, which had no direct interaction with the inner NHR coils. S641G and N651I were adjacent to Y638 and Q650. It seemed that these mutations might contribute to the formation of hydrogen bond bridges by increasing the flexibilities of the neighboring mainchain of Y638 and decreasing the hydrogen bonding to the Q650 sidechain via water molecules, respectively.",

The parallel stacking of two rings of H564 and Y638 was also found in the X-ray structure [7], but no hydrogen bond between these sidechains was shown in the structure, because the two rings were placed too closely, as was also true in the MT-4/LAI model. We think that the hydrogen bond between H564 and Y638 fixes the sidechain of H564 in the position that makes it easy to form the next hydrogen bond with E560, and that the positional relationship of the two rings is very important for the total formation of the hydrogen bond bridges shown in the model for MT-4/17-3-6.",

            "text": "Coiled-coil trimeric structures are commonly found in the spike proteins of not only HIV but also other corona viruses, including influenza virus, Ebola virus, and SARS virus [28]. In these coiled-coil structures, it seemed that HIV had the most tightly combined complex of NHR and CHR, and therefore the mode of interaction between NHR and CHR of HIV may be most effective for the trimeric formation at the time of virus attack. We found in our previous research that the differences of gp41 resistance to peptide fusion inhibitors were larger for intra-subtype comparisons, such as MT-4/LAI and MT-4/17-3-6, than for inter-subtype comparisons, such as MT-4/LAI and CU98-26 (subtypes are shown in Table 1) [23]. These large intra-subtype differences can be explained by our model, which showed that the L565M mutation could stabilize the coiled-coil without affecting the structure of the protein widely. We previously reported that the resistance to peptide fusion inhibitors differed markedly between MT-4/LAI and L-2 in spite of the fact that they had the same sequences of NHR and CHR (Table 1). It is not thought that all of the differences between these virus strains could be explained in here clearly, because the interactions between the NHR\u2013CHR complex and the other regions of the spike protein were not considered in our analyses. However, by the focusing on the L565M mutation in the inner and central moiety, which would be not affected by the other regions, we found that this mutation might be an important factor for the resistance of MT-4/17-3-6 to peptide inhibitors with respect to coiled-coil formation and cell fusion.",
