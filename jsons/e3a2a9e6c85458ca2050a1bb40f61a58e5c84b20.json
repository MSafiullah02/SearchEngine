[2] This strategy could potentially prove harmful to Covid-19 patients, especially those with minimally symptomatic disease. HCQ could limit the duration of exposure of the immune system to the virus. In addition, it has an immunosuppressive effect, this being the rationale for its use in patients with autoimmune disease. [3] Azithromycin, another antibiotic which has been combined with HCQ in the treatment of Covid-19, has immunomodulatory and anti-inflammatory properties for which it has been used in several respiratory diseases. [4] However, a large prospective, placebo-controlled study which was evaluating its use in allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplant recipients was stopped early because of a higher rate of relapse of hematological malignancies in the azithromycin arm. [5] From the perspective of antiviral immunity, a robust immune response requires both a healthy immune system and adequate duration of exposure to the virus. Thus, immunization responses in immunosuppressed patients can be suboptimal. [6, 7] In the absence of an effective anti-Covid-19 vaccine, collective immunity, so-called 'herd immunity', has been proposed as a population-level strategy to manage this pandemic. Most countries have imposed lockdowns in an attempt to flatten the pandemic curve, to give health systems time to build capacity, and, ultimately, to allow for a progressive development of herd immunity.",
