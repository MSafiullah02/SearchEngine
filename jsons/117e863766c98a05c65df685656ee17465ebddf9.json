The way in which the virus has been dispersed in Brazil, and more specifically in Rio de Janeiro, is the motivation of the present work. Our studies consist of analyzing temporal and spatial characteristics of the spread of COVID-19 in the municipalities of the state of Rio de Janeiro and in the neighborhoods of the state capital, based on open data published by the Health Departments of Governments of the State of RJ and the Municipality of Rio de Janeiro, covering the period from February 27, 2020 to April 27, 2020. For that, we use analysis of time evolution graphs and mappings of spatial distributions and statistics analysis of spatial correlation. Our results suggest that the initial stages of spreading the virus across the state occur exponentially, with specific regions with a higher concentration of rates of cases, deaths and recovered people. In addition, our qualitative and quantitative results, for the data considered, point out that the regions with the highest income average per capita have higher rates of confirmed cases and recovered people, however, the regions of higher lethality do not are found in these places, with several of these regions of high lethality in places of low income per capita. Our results reinforce the idea of creating specific and strategic plans for policies to combat the spread of COVID-19 in the various localities in Rio de Janeiro.",

More than half of the patients with such infection has been in the Huanan Seafood market, a place identified as the starting point for the new coronavirus, COVID-19 [1, 2, 3, 4] . Due to its high transmission rate, which reached China and several countries in a few weeks, on March 11, 2020 the World Health Organization (WHO) stated that the new COVID-19 infection would pass to be characterized as a pandemic 1 . In Brazil, all states of the federation already report confirmed cases, of which S\u00e3o Paulo and Rio de Janeiro are the ones with the largest number of infections and deaths by COVID- 19 Rio de Janeiro is the state with the second largest number of confirmed cases and deaths due to the COVID-19 pandemic according to data from the Ministry of Health 2 . It is worth mentioning that Rio de Janeiro is a state of great importance within the Brazilian scenario, having the second largest economy in the country and one of the most globalized cities in the world. Rio de Janeiro is an industrial hub and shelter headquarters of several multinational companies, covering food, metallurgical, steel, with emphasis on the oil extraction and refinement sectors. The tourist sector in Rio de Janeiro raises billions of Brazilian reais per year, and part of its capital was declared in 2017, as heritage of humanity by the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO). As a result of such circumstances the flow of people is high, a factor that probably contributed to the sustained transmission of COVID-19 and its rapid dissemination. Highlights also the fact that COVID-19 can also be disseminated by asymptomatic individuals, which makes it more difficult control [3, 5] .",

Thus, in the present work, temporal and spatial analyzes of the dynamics of distribution of confirmed cases, recovered people, mortality rates and lethality rates due to the new coronavirus are developed. In these analyzes we take into account the places where contagions were recorded, as well as demographic characteristics like population size and per capita incomes. Thus, using statistical methods of space correlations, we developed an exploratory data analysis that are distributed in space, but that evolve over time, making it possible for us to look for association patterns between different regions and socio-economic conditions. Therefore, this study aims to contribute to a better understanding of how contagion has evolved spatially and temporally in the population of the state and the municipality of Rio de Janeiro, especially in the initial periods of its dissemination, since our studies use data that include information until April 27, 2020.",

An observation to be made is that for the analysis of municipalities it will not be presented errors related to parameter b of eq. 1 nor the coefficients of determination R 2 . This is because all analyzes are made for large numbers of municipalities, and therefore it would not make sense to place the adjustment values for all cases. In this way the b values presented are the measures of the angular coefficients of straight lines shown in the inset graphics. * Confirmed cases: Fig. 2 shows the evolution of cases confirmed for the municipalities of Rio de Janeiro. In this figure results are presented for the 20 municipalities with highest number of cases for every 100 thousand inhabitants. With the objective of observing, the growth trend of confirmed cases in each municipality more clearly, we also used the semi-log, scale, where it can be noted that several municipalities have similar trends, characterized by the line present in the inset of Fig 2. Thus, despite the municipalities don't behave in exactly the same way, we can observe the presence of the exponential form, represented by eq. 1, in the growth behavior of the num-ber of confirmed cases in the municipalities of the state of Rio de Janeiro. By the inset, with log-lin axis, in the figure, we are able to fit a straight exponential that meets an average behavior of several municipalities for the interval approximately between the 20th and 40th day.

This figure shows the results for the 20 neighborhoods with the highest rates of confirmed cases. It is observed that the neighborhoods located in the southern part of the city have higher rates of confirmed cases. The only exception is the Bonsucesso neighborhood, which after the 40th day showed an abrupt growth greater than all other neighborhoods. The exponential behavior presented in the inset is better followed by the neighborhoods in the southern zone, with adjustment for b = 0.051.",

Such analyzes will be made as explained below. Cumulative data number of confirmed cases, mortality, lethality and recovered people, will be overlaid on heat maps of per capita income distributions, which will be built on geographic maps of the considered regions. All maps presented in this section are maps of spatial distribution for accumulated data, where the 10 municipalities with the highest rates per 100 thousand inhabitants are highlighted and named. In all cases the sizes of the circles in red grow according to the rate values and the heat map varies from white to blue according to the local average per capita income considered. The maps presented in this section were built using the QGIS software 10 . It is worth mentioning here that spatial distribution maps, in general, have more data than time evolution graphs. This is due to the fact that not all data available in the databases of the Health Secretariats, have the date of occurrence.

With that it was possible to observe a considerably incidence of lower number of cases in the north of the state. Another result obtained was that in our analysis Duque de Caxias presents itself as the municipality with the highest mortality and lethality in the state of Rio de Janeiro.",

For neighborhoods in the municipality of Rio, a strong space autocorrelation was also found, in which the municipalities of the southern part of the state concentrate most of the high-rate cluster, while the western zone concentrates most of the neighborhoods of low rates.",

This result was also confirmed for the fourth time with the use of Moran's bivariate I statistic pointing to a strong spatial correlation between locations with higher case rates and recovery and neighborhoods in the municipality of Rio de Janeiro with higher per capita income.",
