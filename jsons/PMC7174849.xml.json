Test results indicated that the hydraulic action caused by flushing toilets generated huge quantities of aerosols in vertical sewer pipes or sanitary risers.4\n",

Based on these characteristics, SARS-CoV-2 is prone to cause outbreaks in the community, particularly in rural areas. Excreta treatment in scattered rural areas is generally decentralized and self-processing. In concentrated areas, residents mainly use flush toilets, which can generate huge quantities of aerosols; the ventilation and plumbing systems in these places are not effective for maximal hygiene. The feces may form high concentrations of viral aerosols that travel through the air to cause infection.6\n",

First, to avoid widespread viral aerosols in concentrated areas, state-of-the-art ventilation and plumbing systems should be constructed and maintained. Flouring half liter of water into each bathroom floor drain should be done weekly. In addition, the toilet lid should be covered when flushing the toilet to prevent aerosolization, and the toilet lid should be wiped with a disinfectant after flushing the toilet. Second, a safety program for environmental monitoring and feedback is an effective way to prevent the spread of SARS-CoV-2. Be alert to sewer gas, unusual noises, or bubbles in pipes and toilets, and respond immediately.4 Third, 3-segment septic-tank toilets and biogas tank toilets are the main sanitary toilets used in rural areas, and more effective raw sewage management should be explored in these areas. Another important aspect is natural ventilation, which can reduce viral density and is the most effective measure to reduce the risk of airborne contagion.7 By managing the feces of COVID-19 patients, we can effectively minimize the risks of viral spread in the community. Although the COVID-19 is described as a pandemic, we believe that our efforts can render this pandemic controllable.",
