However, PCR-based tests are still considered the \"golden standard\" for many clinical applications. Here, we designed a qPCR-based platform with fluorescent-labeled oligonucleotide probes for assessing human gut microbiome composition. The system allows conducting qualitative and semiquantitative analysis for 12 prokaryotic taxa that are prevalent in the human gut and associated with diseases, diet, age and other factors. The platform was validated by comparing microbiome profile data obtained with two different methods -the platform and high-throughput 16S rRNA sequencing -across 42 stool samples. The test can form the basis for precise and cost-efficient microbiome assay for large-scale surveys including clinical trials with interventions related to diet and disease risks.",

Based on the discovered associations, a number of microbial taxa have been proposed as potential biomarkers. For example, the abundance of Akkermansia muciniphila, a mucin-degrading bacterium is inversely associated with body fat mass and glucose intolerance [7] . Disrupted gut community structure is also one of the risk factors for cardiovascular diseases [8] . Many of the bacteria belonging to Clostridiales order are efficient producers of butyrate an other short-chain fatty acids known to possess anti-inflammatory, immunomodulatory and other important activities including gut epithelium integrity maintainence [9, 10] .",

The platform was designed in a way to reach equilibrium between the coverage of the human gut microbiome diversity and cost per analysis. Subsequently, as the gut microbiome is highly complex, many prevalent taxa are not currently included among the targets. According to our comparison with NGS results, only a third of the total composition variance is explained by the platform. Our results show that the other families and genera that are abundant and variable across the test samples according to 16S rRNA sequencing but not targeted by the PCR test include Lachnospiraceae spp. (9.2 \u00b1 4.3%), Faecalibacterium (5.9 \u00b1 5.0%) and Ruminococcus (3.4 \u00b1 3.0%). These along with their members are potential candidates to be included in the prospective extended panel -along with various members of the Firmicutes phylum including Dorea, Roseburia and others. However, the taxonomy within the phylum especially its Clostridiales order is rather ambiguous hence further elaboration of the primers and probes will be required.",

[49, 50] Streptococcus High abundance is associated with liver cirrhosis, as well as to the increased risk of bacteremia in immunocompromised patients. [51, 52] . One of the problems of the PCR approach is related to normalization. To address this issue, the set could be extended by adding a universal pair of primers (and a probe) targeting total prokaryotic content that can be used for normalization purposes (for example, by dividing signals from other taxa by it). Although this would reflect the microbial concentration in the analyzed DNA sample, this concentration could not directly correspond to the concentration in the subject's stool, as it can change considerably during the extraction. One of the suggested ways to approach absolute normalization is to collect an exactly equal volume of stool each time. Still, our platform allows us to assess the pairwise ratios between the targeted taxa. Consideration of ratios in the context of microbiome data is especially relevant as for many techniques -including metagenomics -they are often inherently compositional implying use of statistical approaches based on ratios, for instance, the balances [60] . The ratios and their derivatives can further be used as microbial community features to explore the associations with clinical status, diet and other factors. Finally, the proposed platform can be used for prioritization purposes: basing on its results for a specific subject, one can opt for performing additional in-depth analysis using other qPCR platforms targeting microbial genes (like virulence factors and antibiotic resistance determinants) or pathogenic taxa.",
