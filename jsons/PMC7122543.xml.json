To remove the patient from a planned operating programme should be an exception!Notify the manager if poor hygiene and cleaning in the patient room.Perform good hand hygiene throughout your stay. If bedridden, ask for wipes for hand disinfection. Ask visitors to carry out hand hygiene on arrival and when they leave the hospital.Ask health professionals to carry out hand hygiene if this fails\u2014before and after your examination.Good body wash before surgery, including hair. Use a disinfecting soap\u2014Hibiscrub\u2014containing chlorhexidine the night before and in the morning. This reduces the amount of bacteria on the skin (1B). Used especially in elective operations\u2014when inserting prostheses and other foreign bodies.Learn good breathing exercises that are used after surgery.You should not be placed together with patients with infections\u2014either before or after surgery, because of risk of infection. You should not be placed on the corridor or other places not intended for patients, since you there is more at risk for infections.Do not touch the wound or the bandages. Bacteria must not come to the wound while it is healing. Do not let the bandage get wet because bacteria can then grow more easily through.All who are going to take off the bandage and treat the wound should have clean hands and sterile gloves and use sterile equipment when removing stitches, doing wound care, etc.If itching, pain or leakage through the bandage, contact a doctor or nurse.Physiotherapist will help you with breathing so you get well soon after surgery.Be placed a little high up with your upper body in bed after surgery, it reduces problems with respiratory infections.\n",

Well-planned surgery and well-prepared patient.Ask if the patient has recently been ill; had fever, stomach ache with vomiting, urinary tract infections, other infections and received antibiotics; or had been exposed to norovirus prior to admission.Eradicate infections. Ensure the eradication of infections, urinary tract infections, skin infections and other local infections prior to admission. Check the dental status, especially before larger elective interventions with implants and the like. Postpone surgery, if possible, until the infection is cleared (1A) [4, 8].Resistant bacteria. Check if the patient has been in contact with the healthcare abroad for the past 12 months, has been exposed to MRSA (methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus) or has previously been MRSA infected/carrier.If yes for exposure or infection, this is tested in advance (preferably before admission) by taking samples for detection of MRSA, VRE (vancomycin-resistant enterococci), ESBL (extended-spectrum beta-lactamase-producing) gram-negative bacteria, CRE (carbapenem-resistant Enterobacteriaceae) and other current or epidemic, resistant bacteria.If not checked negative in advance and have been exposed to or infected by resistant bacteria, postpone elective operations until this is clear.NB! In acute disease state, necessary surgery should not be postponed but performed as an air contamination surgery.Short preoperative stay, less than 1\u20132 days.Intestinal surgery. Bacterial volume in the intestine should be reduced, but the effect of mechanical drainage alone is controversial. Estimated as important in the case of impaired immune defence. The most important is the systemic antibacterial prophylaxis as a single dose (usually) at the onset of anaesthesia.Hair removal. It must be considered whether hair removal is necessary (1B). If done, it should be performed as close to the operation as possible, but not in the operating room. Remove loose hairs!Glucose control perioperatively for all patients; use blood control target levels less than 200 mg/dl in patients with and without diabetes (1A) [13]. Monitor at regular measurements at least during the first postoperative day (1B).\n",

Positive air pressure on operating rooms and defined \u201cclean rooms\u201d (1B). Positive air pressure on the entire operation department relative to other departments and outdoor air (1B).Heating and ventilation to ensure comfortable conditions for the patient and staff [4].Structural quality. Dense, robust and easily washable walls, firm and complete ceilings and a solid floor that can withstand disinfectants. Do not use tiles that can be difficult to clean and replace. Do not use wood that attach bacteria more easily. No swing doors that produce piston power on air currents. No sliding doors that are impossible to wash and not doors with \u201cbrush material\u201d or other edge material that collects dust and dirt.Good sluice conditions for patients: Patients without infections or carrier state are sluiced into a clean bedroom waiting hall, \u201cgreen area,\u201d for preoperative treatment.Good sluice conditions for personnel: There is good place for changing clothes, spacious wardrobe, with a separate storage for clean clothes, bathroom and good daily cleaning.Storage of clean or sterile equipment in separate rooms (14\u201320 m2): sterile equipment, protheses, intravenous fluids, major medical equipment, sterile cover materials, operation tops, bandages, etc. Storage rooms are not offices, due to large amounts of bacteria-bearing skin cells and particles released from the skin and deposited around from persons present. A clean room has <100 CFU/m3 air and a low particle load.Throughput lockers for equipment to operating rooms should be avoided due to uncertain pressure conditions and risk of contamination of stored equipment and the operating room.Surgical specialties should have their own custom-made equipment rooms for special materials.

At least 42 m2 area (6 \u00d7 7 m) for ample space for equipment, place around the operation table for the operating team and anaesthesia and for assistants, students, etc. that are not getting too close to the clean zone. Operation robots often need more space.Operations on infectious patients are preferably carried out at the end of the day, if possible, and are well planned.Operation room, specific in use for most infectious agents (resistant bacteria - MRSA, VRE, ESBL, CRE, and Clostridium difficile; mycobacteria, intestinal-pathogenic bacteria, etc, and virus like norovirus, influenza virus), can be established by switching off the positive-pressure ventilation, closing for air intake/air out and not using operating rooms with LAF (laminar airflow) filter. The room should be large, stripped of unnecessary equipment and close to the entrance of the operating department. It is immediately disinfected after use with chemical liquids and dry hydrogen peroxide gas, according to defined arrangements, but notice that there is no documented effect of hydrogen peroxide gas on tuberculosis or other mycobacteria.Operation room, specific for high-risk, serious infectious agents (multiresistant tuberculosis, other highly resistant bacteria and respiratory tract viruses such as SARS, MERS, Ebola and other haemorrhagic fever viruses, highly pathogenic avian influenza virus, etc.) that may cause airborne infection during the surgery. The entire operation unit (including rooms with openings directly into this high-risk area) must be on a negative pressure\u201425 Pa or lower with separate ventilation\u2014not shared with other rooms or buildings. Air in and air out must be disinfected and filtered (HEPA filter) [4]. Air out, including filters, should be treated with chemical gases and or UVC. The unit should have designated disinfection room with instrument washer and autoclave, storage room, good sluice functions and direct, sheltered outside access. All waste and fluid from the unit should be disinfected as required (autoclaving, heat disinfection, chemical disinfection).Surgical hand disinfection room should not be storage for equipment and not a \u201ccoffee-break\u201d room because of generation of aerosols during the washing process and risk for growth of bacteria. Choose a washstand that does not sprinkle outwards. As a wet room, it may have a lower air pressure in relation to the operating room, with air direction from the operation room to the hand disinfection room.Disinfection room for equipment and instruments is not used as storage for equipment or used for packing of cleaned instruments. It is a process room\u2014wet room\u2014for disinfection and has a lower air pressure in relation to the operating room with air direction from the operation room to the disinfection room.Disinfected instruments are packed in a separate, clean, packing room and autoclaved in a separate autoclave room with steam exhaust.Anaesthesia initiating room is a clean room with storage in glass cabinets of equipment for preoperative treatment, but no office or warehouse at large.Break rooms, meeting rooms; with plenty of space, easy to clean, and furniture that is cleaned and washed weekly\u2014fabric furniture must not be used.Office space and expedition. Enough areas for operating descriptions, journals, dictation, etc. Offices for the personnel should be outside the operating department to reduce the microbial and particle burden on the operating environment.\n",

The air comes in from the ceiling or high up on the wall and goes out at the floor level\u2014ca 15 cm above the floor area (1B) [4, 8]. There should be no heating-cooling systems in the operating room because of accumulation of dust, skin cells, particles, bacteria and fungi. This may result in growth and spread of microbes to the air, as well as unsafe air currents.Air filter on incoming air. Two filter layers (HEPA) must be passed through before the air is entering the operating room (1B) [4]. EU filter with minimum 9 for intake of air at normal operating theatres and EU filter minimum 13 on LAF theatres. Filter quality is checked by DOP test (smoke/particle test), at least once a year.Positive air pressure in operating theatres should be 10\u201315 Pa, in relation to nearby rooms and corridor.Daily control of ventilation, temperature and humidity in the operating room.Bacterial number in the air; colony-forming units (CFU) per m3 air:Standard surgery room <100 CFU/m3 air.Ultraclean surgery room: <10 CFU/m3 which applies to infection-sensitive surgery like implantation of foreign bodies, cardiovascular surgery and patients with impaired immune defence.

Everything \u201cunclean\u201d that comes between clean airflow in the direction of the operating area and the wound poses a risk of contamination of the wound. Any unclean thing that comes between airflow and uncovered instrument tables poses a risk of contamination of instruments. The use of tight operating suits and phantom hood that covers the neck, hair, ears and cheeks protects the wound and environment against release of skin cells and bacterial contamination.Opening doors lead to increased bacterial amount in the operating room from corridors, etc. The doors should be kept closed (1B).Diathermia releases large amounts of particles\u2014diathermia smoke\u2014partly with protein residues. This is a major burden on air quality. Protein residues on the diathermia needle may be difficult to remove. Check cleaning routines and reduce, if possible, use of diathermia.Largest microbial load of the operating room is registered when preparing the patient and when tidying up upon completion of surgery.The number of persons present is strongly associated with bacterial and particle numbers in air. Preferably, it should not be more than six to eight people present.\n",

Remove beard if you are going to work in an operating department.Protecting against blood and tissues. Surgical mask protects against large amounts of invisible blood and tissue drops that come from surgery, especially diathermy, suction, etc. Most of the blood drops and spills around the operation team are invisible. Respirator (P3 mask) protects best against diathermy smoke. Visor or goggles may protect the eye mucosa against risk of blood-borne microbes, since hepatitis virus and HIV can invade the eye mucosa.Disciplined clothing must be followed by all personnel working in the operating area. Be particularly careful with \u201cfallout\u201d of skin cells and particles from the head and neck when working under LAF roofs; also applies to anaesthesia.Sterile dressing kits are opened by an assistant immediately before taking on in the operating room.Check that sterile gown is large enough, is suitable for current surgery (e.g. a lot of blood-fluid spills), has good cuffs and is comfortable around the neck.Learn careful dressing of sterile operating equipment.It is easy to contaminate sleeves and cuffs when putting on sterile gloves. Learn the safest method to put on gloves\u2014with the help of an assistant.Use sterile strong gloves with long cuff covering the entire cuff on the gown. After surgery, punctures are often detected in the gloves. Therefore, it is particularly important with good hand disinfection before surgery. If puncture is detected during the operation, turn away from the operating table, remove the gloves, disinfect hands and put on new sterile gloves.Preferably use double gloves, possibly with colour indicator for holes, especially at the risk of puncture. Double gloves should be used in orthopaedics and other infection-sensitive surgeries, for procedures where the glove easily gets rifles and always for possible blood-borne infection (hepatitis, HIV, etc.).Change gloves and disinfect hands\u2014from an unclean operating area to a cleaner.Change gloves and disinfect hands\u2014if there is a very large amount of biologic material on the gloves or if suspected contamination.\n",

Over the past 20 years, SSI has varied between 5% and 12%, and up to 15\u201320% of patients have been followed up after discharge [15\u201317, 41]. The number of patients with SSI is relatively large in Norway, since one out of three admitted to hospitals is operated [17].At Ullev\u00e5l University Hospital, 57,300 patients were followed with prevalence studies during the period 1995\u20132007 [17]. In all, 13.4% of 12,430 operated patients had postoperative HAI compared to 5% among non-operated, which documented surgery as a risk area in medicine [17]. SSI was detected in 6.2%, with an annual variation from 3.9% to 7.2% and with the lowest rate in 2002. There was a significant reduction of SSI from 1995 to 2002. Establishment of healthcare enterprises in 2002, according to \u201cnew public management\u201d with a focus on efficiency and profit, resulted in increased prevalence of SSI and other hospital infections [17]. The general workload with patients increased, while cleaning and maintenance of the hospital fell into decay. This may have led to increase in hospital infections, including SSI [17].Most SSIs are deep infections in Norway. In 2011, SSI was proven nationwide in 7.8% (6.8\u20138.8) of surgical patients at hospitals, and 80% of these were deep or cavity infections. At the same time, 12.7% (9.5\u201316.0) of recently operated patients in Norwegian nursing homes had SSI, and half of these had serious, deep infections (National Public Health). Mortality of SSI is not recorded in Norway.\n",

            "text": "\nProsthetic surgery in the hip and knee is increasing and is a source of severe SSIs [49]. Registration in Europe and the United States shows a similar rate of infection, 1\u20133%; total hip joint arthroplasty, 1.3\u20132.91%; and total knee joint arthroplasty, 0.67\u20133.7% [49].In 2004, 49,500 hip operations were examined in 14 European countries; 2.2% had SSI, total prosthesis 1.6% and partial 4% [50].Simultaneous arthroplasty for the knee joint and hips showed no difference with regard to SSI between unilateral and bilateral operations. An exception was for antibiotic prophylaxis that could be prolonged by bilateral surgery [66].In the United States, SSIs after hip surgery are monitored by insurance companies such as Medicare at 3300 hospitals [56]. During the period 2005\u20132007, 7.8% of 524,892 operated patients had SSI [56]. By a ranking of hospitals, the best had a prevalence of approximately 1.5% SSIs and the worst 2.5\u20133%. The worst of all hospitals, with SSIs of 5\u20138.8%, were represented by only 0.2% of all hospitals [56].In France, there was 36% reduction of SSI after hip prosthesis, from 1.1% in 1999 to 0.7% in 2006 (p = 0.002 for linear trend) [21].In Sweden, deep infections following total hip prosthesis were followed up for 2 years. In all, 0.9% had deep SSIs, and 405 of 443 were reoperated one or more times. The most common microbes isolated were S. aureus and white staphylococci [67].Norway established a hip register in 1987 with extension to register for other prosthesis surgeries in 1994 [68, 69]. Ca. 2% of 854 total prostheses of the knee were reoperated because of infection in 1994 [68]. During the period 1987\u20132011, there were ca. 11,000 surgeries with hip prosthesis every year, having an SSI rate of 3%; and 1% were reoperated [70]. The SSI rate was for total prosthesis 2.6% and for hemiprosthesis 7.7%. Risk factors were hemiprosthesis, man, high age, other concomitant diseases, too short or long operating time, immediate help operations, uncemented prosthesis and NNIS risk index of >0. The reasons why\u2014despite many preventive measures\u2014there is now more than a threefold risk of reoperation due to prosthetic infection, compared to earlier, are discussed [70].Uckay et al. [10] refer to the risk of SSI according to different SSIs\u2014registers for primary hip\u2014and knee operations, such as 0.8% (Norwegian register, 73,000 arthroplastics), 0.9% (Finnish register, 4628 arthroplastics) and 0.9% (Geneva register, 6101 arthroplastics), and recommend active follow-up of the patient after discharge (1A), multimodal intervention (1A) and adequate antibiotic prophylaxis (1A).Deep/organ-cavity infections were detected in 0.7% of 131,879 hip-operated patients in a US healthcare study in 2011. Only inpatient and recruited patients were investigated [58]. Multivariate analysis showed increased risk of SSI in older patients, higher ASA scores, longer operating time, type of surgery (total, partial, reoperated) and larger hospitals, >200 beds versus \u2264200 beds [58].\n",

Diabetic patients had a longer incubation time for SSI\u2014more than 17 days postoperatively, than others. In order to make SSI a more reliable indicator, it is recommended that the patient should be followed up for more than 6 weeks [78].CDC reported 7.8% SSIs in 2576 patients, largely bypass operated, in 2000 [79]. Patients with SSIs had significantly longer operation time and time on cardiopulmonary bypass, than patients without infection [79].A total of 4.5% SSIs among 2620 bypass-operated patients in 2012 resulted in reoperation in 7.7% of the cases [80]. There was SSI in the sternal wound in 3.6% and in the donor wound in 1.2% of the cases. SSI prolonged hospital stay from 14.5 to 42.2 days, p < 0.001, and quadrupled time in intensive units, from 4 days to 15 days, p < 0.001.A high infection rate, 11.9%, detected among 2146 heart-operated patients in London, was associated with age over 70 years, number of surgical procedures, CABG and flap operated combined, kidney disease and 3 or more days between admission and surgery [53].The number of major heart surgery (MHS) operations among 13 countries in Europe was in 2006 estimated to be 25,570; 26.8% had postoperative infections, and 2.2% had SSIs [81].Sternal infections were studied among 18,460 patients in the period 2005\u20132012 in Turkey [82]. In all, 2.6% got SSI caused by white staphylococcus (36%) or S. aureus (31%) [82].Surgical site infections caused by environmental flora and by contamination of sterile procedures (ice water cardioplegic) are well known, especially of multiresistant Enterobacter cloacae [83\u201386].From 1987 to 1988, nine patients had postoperative infections with multidrug-resistant E. cloacae after cardiovascular surgery [83, 84]. All survived the infection that was transmitted via contaminated sterile fluids (cardioplegic fluids\u2014for cooling the heart) [83, 84].Postoperative mediastinitis caused by MRSA is more serious than MSSA (methicillin-sensitive S. aureus), in that patients with MRSA have significantly shorter survival time than patients with MSSA [87]. After 1 month, 1 year and 3 years, the survival rate was 60%, 52.5% and 26.3% for MRSA patients, respectively, compared to 84.6%, 79% and 79% for MSSA patients, respectively. There was a significantly greater treatment failure in MRSA patients than MSSA patients with medianistitis [87].Sternal wound infections occur three times more frequently in men than women, and smoking, use of internal mammary artery for grafting and age over 70 years are associated with sternal wound infection [88].Among 12,315 patients with median sternotomy in the period 1987\u20131998, 3.3% became reoperated due to postoperative bleeding [89]. Of these, 14% died postoperatively by noninfectious complications. Early reoperation reduced wound infections, sepsis and respiratory treatment. Late reoperation resulted in more than 20 days of extra hospital stay [89].Bitkover et al. [90] examined sternal wound infections caused by coagulase-negative staphylococci (kns) and found that in an ultraclean environment, the bacteria come into the wound during surgery from the patient\u2019s skin and from the operation team.Tegnell et al. [91] compared sternal wound infection caused by kns with uninfected matched controls and found that the risk of infection was associated with the number of preoperative days in the hospital, total surgery length and early reoperation for other reasons. A long exposure to the hospital environment is a risk factor and the treatment may be difficult because of more resistant bacteria [91].De Feo et al. [92] studied the prognosis of deep postoperative sternal infection among 13,420 operated and found that 0.8% had deep infection; hence 16.9% died in hospitals. Early and aggressive treatment reduced morbidity and mortality [92].Among 133,488 patients with CABG, SSI was detected in 2.2% of the sternal wounds and in 1.2% of deep/organ-cavity wounds [58]. Only hospitalized and rehospitalized patients were recorded [58]. Small hospitals \u2264200 or large hospitals >500 beds were significantly associated with the occurrence of deep, serious SSIs, p = 0.0001, than mid-sized hospitals [58].At Ullev\u00e5l University Hospital, Norway, in all 1237 CABG-ACB patients were monitored in the period 2005\u20132009 [93]. SSI was detected in the sternal wound, drainage site and/or donor site in 17.8% of the patients. In all, 14.3% of SSIs were detected within 30 days and 3.5% between 30 and 60 days. Infection in sternal wound occurred in 5.7% (superficial 4.7% and deep 1.1%), leg wound (donor site) in 7.3% and drainage site in 1.3%. S. aureus was the most frequently detected bacterium (23.2%) and MRSA in one patient (0.6%) [93].Risk factors are obesity, diabetes, age over 70 years, nasal carrier state of S. aureus in the patient (occasionally also in the operation team), preoperative long retention (48 h or more), high-risk score (ASA score, etc.) and long operating time (over 75 percentile).\n",

In addition, SSI patients have often a marked limited physical activity and a significant reduction of health-related quality of life.In the Netherlands (2009), the cost of a patient with SSI tended to double the cost of a patient without SSI [119].After discharge, there are often large extra costs of the SSIs [116\u2013118].

Males emit more bacteria than women and shower increases the release of bacteria for 1\u20132 h afterwards. High temperature and humidity increase bacterial growth, and bacterial and particle count increases with the number of people and activities in the operating room.

            "text": "Surgical staff who do not follow procedures for personal hygiene, dressing, hand hygiene or use of jewellery pose a risk for development of SSI.Nocardia farcinica caused sternal infection in five patients undergoing heart surgery [112]. Case-control studies showed that the patients had been exposed to an anaesthesiologist A having identical ribotype profile of Nocardia on the hands, in own home, including the house cat. The outbreak stopped after intensive cleaning, hand hygiene, use of personal infection control equipment and cleaning the anaesthesiologist A\u2019s home [112].Mediastinitis caused by MRSA among five cardiac surgery patients was tracked to a surgeon who had identical genotype in the nose [110]. After elimination of the carrier state, the outbreak stopped [110].Major outbreaks of group A streptococci have been traced to the surgical staff with chronic carrier state [111].Prostate abscess with bilateral orchiectomy and flushing the incisional wound proved to be active tuberculosis, Mycobacterium tuberculosis [142]. In all, 128 HCW were exposed to infection, including 12 (13%) who became tuberculin positive, including 1 of 12 in the surgical team [142].Rhodococcus (Gordona) bronchialis in sternal wound in seven patients after open heart surgery was associated with surgical nurse A. The bacterium was detected on the hands, head and other skin areas of nurse A, in the environment and in the air around A, in A\u2019s home and in A\u2019s dogs [143]. Attempts to remove the bacteria from nurse A were unsuccessful [143].Nasal carrier state\u2014with large amounts of S. aureus\u2014increases risk of SSIs. When the surgeon is a nose carrier of S. aureus, the risk is highest [144].During 1 month, seven heart surgery patients in California had SSI with Serratia marcescens, and one died [145]. The infection was traced to an operation-nurse A, who used artificial nails and in a cream tube in A\u2019s home. The outbreak stopped after removing the cause.During 1 year, 15 neurosurgical patients in the Netherlands got SSIs with Serratia marcescens [146]. Environmental samples were negative. Nurse A, 1 of 100 in contact with the actual patients, had identical bacteria on the hands [146]. Nurse A that had been most in contact with the infected patients had psoriasis on hands. Nurse A was on sick leave for 3 months with persistent positive samples, while the outbreak stopped in the department. One year later there was a new outbreak of three patients related to nurse A which again was infected and who had not got rid of the bacteria because of the psoriasis [146].In a cardiac surgical unit in England, four patients got deep surgical infections and pneumonia with MRSA during 1 year (epidemic strain MRSA-15) [147]. Employees were then tested with the discovery of a nurse who was nasal carrier and without symptoms. After clearance, the outbreak stopped. It was recommended screening of personnel for MRSA [147].A highly resistant\u2014Pseudomonas aeruginosa\u2014strain was transferred to four patients via contaminated gastroscope during a few months in 2013 [148]. The reason was deviations in cleaning, disinfecting and drying the scope. After removal of the gastroscope and establishment of safe practices, the outbreak stopped [148].Serratia marcescens caused increased number of patients with postoperative empyema at a thoracic-surgical intensive care unit in March 2013 in Turkey [149]. The common source of infection was a portable suction machine. After full disinfection, sterilization and control of the equipment, the outbreak stopped.Ear cleaning instruments may be too poor disinfected, as shown by subsequent transmission of Pseudomonas aeruginosa to 17 patients with severe external otitis [150].Contaminated tap water in surgical wound has caused outbreaks of Legionella SSIs [151].Water may often contain mycobacteria which are not detectable by conventional bacteriological tests and are resistant to chemical disinfectants and to some extent also to heat.Mycobacterium fortuitum endocarditis was detected in three heart-operated children in Serbia in 2013 [152]. Bovine pericardial patches were used for correction of ventricular septal defect. Parts of the same pieces of tissue had been used for several operations, and this was not compatible with a good routine. Estimated infection cause was contamination by thawing and freezing. All three children survived after antimicrobial therapy [152].Contaminated equipment brought into the operating theatre is linked to repeated outbreaks of infections.",

Ten heart-operated male patients had during 3 months SSIs, osteomyelitis and sepsis with Serratia marcescens [169]. Common to all ten patients was shaving by a barber that had the same bacteria on hands and equipment. Similar outbreaks are described in a neurosurgical department [170]. Fourteen neurosurgical patients developed SSIs with Serratia marcescens within a 6-month period at a hospital in China [171].

The same bacterial strain was grown from both the ventilator and the syringe in 13% of the cases and was also detected on the IV set in two patients. There was a significant correlation between the urgent surgery and contaminated syringes. Risk was also related to the absence of the use of gloves and missing cap on the three-way tap after use.

Among 20 sets, half were discoloured exteriorly and more than half had bacteria on the interior surfaces. A total of 11 patients had to be reoperated because of SSIs [224].",
