As illustrated in Figure 1, the replication cycle of alphavirus can be summarized in three main stages, which are virus entry, intracellular replication, and maturation. At the beginning of the replication cycle, alphavirus infects host cells by engaging its E2 glycoproteins with the cell surface receptors and then enters the cells via clathrin-mediated endocytosis.10 As the virus-containing endosome matures, the acidic environment that develops within the endocytotic vesicle destabilizes the envelope glycoprotein structure.2,11 The resulting conformational change initiates fusion between the virus and late endosomal membranes, leading to the emptying of the nucleocapsid into the cytosol (Event 1).",

The current treatment, i.e. administration of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDS) and paracetamol, only alleviates the symptoms of the disease. Over the past 50 years, there have been reports on small-molecule alphavirus inhibitors for development as potential antivirals.1,35\u201337 Nearly half of them were discovered and obtained from natural sources.38 There are many virus-specific and host targets involved in virus replication that can be targeted by antiviral therapy. Direct-acting inhibitors are designed to act on virus-specific targets, i.e. the nsP(s) and structural protein(s), while host-targeting inhibitors inhibit the functions of host-derived proteins that are actively involved in alphavirus replication. Figure 2 illustrates the list of direct-acting and host-targeting inhibitors and their mechanisms of action in disrupting virus attachment and entry, intracellular replication and virus maturation and budding. Table 2 summarizes the in vitro antiviral properties of these inhibitors described in terms of CC50 (i.e. concentration of inhibitor required for the reduction of cell viability by 50%) and EC50 or IC50 (i.e. concentration of inhibitor required to produce 50% of the total anti-alphaviral effect) unless stated otherwise.\n",

A homology model of CHIKV nsP2 based on a VEEV nsP2 protease template was created and screened with a commercially available library of \u223c5 million compounds for binding activities with the protease active site. Of these, compound 9 (Figure 3), which possesses a hydrazide structure, demonstrated significant inhibition in both virus yield and CHIKV-induced cytopathic effect (CPE) reduction assays.58 Using hydrazide 9 as a lead, an SAR approach was adopted by designing and evaluating a series of hydrazide compounds. Replacement of the cyclopropane ring in hydrazide 9 with an alkene moiety resulted in hydrazide 10 (Figure 3), which demonstrated a slightly improved antiviral profile.58 A new class of hydrazide-based nsP2 inhibitors was also designed and generated by employing computational pharmacophoric replacement and using hydrazide 9 as a lead.59 Of these, hydrazide 11 (Figure 3) not only showed inhibition of the cleavage of peptide substrate by CHIKV nsP2 in a fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET)-based cell-free protease assay, but also demonstrated anti-CHIKV activities at low micromolar concentrations.59 Interestingly, reduction of both viral RNA synthesis and infectious virus production was observed when cells were pretreated with hydrazide 11, suggesting there could be other modes of action associated with this compound.59 Moving forward, it would be interesting to analyse the inhibitory properties of the individual cis/trans isomers of hydrazide 11 as stereochemistry could be a major determinant of compound activity.",

This interaction may inhibit the process of virus release, resulting in reduced cell\u2013cell transmission.78 Treatment with suramin was shown to reduce viral loads as well as reducing foot swelling, inflammation and cartilage damage in CHIKV-infected C57BL/6 mice.81 The clinical efficacy of suramin in ameliorating CHIKV-induced arthritis in patients would be worth exploring in the near future.",

Of these, the predominant mechanism of action is inhibition of inosine-5\u2032-monophosphate dehydrogenase (IMPDH), which leads to a depletion of cellular GTP pools and is needed for virus replication.94 A derivative of ribavirin, ribavirin-5\u2032-sulfamate (Figure 4), was also described to inhibit SFV replication.95 Another nucleoside analogue, 6-azauridine (Figure 4), is a broad-spectrum antimetabolite that inhibits both DNA and RNA virus replication of CHIKV and SFV,93 while replacement of the adenine or guanine core in a nucleoside with 4-fluoroimidazole resulted in 5-fluoro-1-\u03b2-d-ribofuranosylimidazole-4-carboxamide (5-FICAR; Figure 4), which showed antiviral activity against SINV.96",

Nuclear transport inhibitors such as mifepristone, ivermectin and leptomycin B have been shown to inhibit VEEV replication by altering VEEV CP localization and activity.140 Of these, leptomycin B, a well-documented CRM1 inhibitor and Streptomyces metabolite, was very potent in restricting the CP to the nucleus, making it unavailable at the cytoplasm to form viable virions.140 Since leptomycin B is rather cytotoxic, there is a need to investigate a new generation of CRM1 inhibitors. Hence, a series of selective inhibitors of nuclear export (SINE) compounds, such as KPT-185, KPT-335 (Figure 5) and KPT-350, which are analogues of selinexor, was explored.141 These compounds confine VEEV CP to the nucleus, leading to a depletion in the amount of cytoplasmic CP (i.e. intracellular CP) and released CP (i.e. extracellular CP), as demonstrated in western blot analyses.141 This leads to a decrease in virus assembly and/or release of mature virions. Serial passaging of VEEV-infected cells in the presence of KPT-185 resulted in mutations within the nuclear localization and nuclear export signals in the CP (i.e. T41I, K64E or K64M), confirming that this SINE compound exerts its antiviral activity by targeting CP localization.141",

These include drugs that are already on the market and currently used for the treatment of other diseases, such as doxycycline, phenothiazines, chloroquine, obatoclax, suramin and digoxin, which have been discovered in drug repurposing screens. The challenge here is to improve the potency of these compounds against CHIKV while retaining good drug-like properties. The inhibitory activities of the tested compounds against alphavirus ranged from strong to weak inhibition depending on the type of assay used, with secopregnane steroid glycoside 13 being the strongest inhibitor, with EC50 1.5 and 2 nM against SINV replication and EEEV-induced CPE, respectively, while suramin displayed the weakest activity against SINV-induced CPE, with EC50 141 \u03bcM. Despite the selective antiviral activity of direct-acting inhibitors such as favipiravir, CID15997213 and ML336 against the functions of alphavirus elements compared with host cellular targets, the use of direct-acting inhibitors in treatment regimens can lead to the rapid selection of resistant viruses. On the other hand, host-targeting inhibitors such as digoxin, bortezomib, berberine, Ag-126 and SINE compounds represent an alternative approach, and may increase the barrier to resistance and achieve broad-spectrum antiviral coverage against a range of alphaviruses. However, a possible downside is the potential on-target toxicity, as exemplified by digoxin, an inhibitor of the Na+\u2013K+-ATPase ion pump, which shows toxicity at concentrations as low as 1 \u03bcM.",

Given the ability to specifically silence any gene of interest in the viral RNA, thereby preventing viral proteins from being translated, short interfering RNAs (siRNAs) and miRNAs, which constitute RNAi-based therapy, offer several advantages over conventional drugs as potential therapeutic agents by overcoming patient compliance and drug toxicity issues.144 As the innate immune system plays a central role in the progression and control of alphavirus infection, small-molecule immunomodulators such as DD264, G10 and 5,6-dimethylxanthenone-4-acetic acid, which stimulate expression of antiviral proteins, have also been explored as potential therapeutic agents against alphavirus infection.145,146 With the recent advances in RNAi technology and developments in the characterization of the receptors and pathways of the innate immune system associated with alphavirus infection, it should be possible to develop highly targeted RNAi-based and immunomodulatory therapies for the treatment of alphavirus infections.",
