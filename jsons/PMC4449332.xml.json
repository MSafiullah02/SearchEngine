A related virus, wobbly possum disease virus (WPDV), was recently identified (Dunowska et al., 2012). Arterivirus genomes are positive-sense, single-stranded, polycistronic RNAs with a 5\u2032 type I cap and a 3\u2032 poly(A) tract (Snijder and Spaan, 2006). Among the arteriviruses, EAV has the shortest genome (12.7 kb) while SHFV has the longest (15.7 kb). The genome organization and replication strategies of arteriviruses are similar to those of coronaviruses. However, arterivirus genomes are about half the size of coronavirus genomes and the virions of the two virus groups differ in their structural protein compositions, capsid types (coronaviruses-helical and arteriviruses-spherical) and virion sizes.",

            "text": "SHFV was first isolated in 1964 as the causative agent of hemorrhagic fever outbreaks associated with high mortality in macaque colonies in the United States and the USSR (Allen et al., 1968, Palmer et al., 1968, Tauraso et al., 1968, Shevtsova, 1969, Lapin and Shevtsova, 1971). African monkeys, such as baboons and African green, patas, guenons and colobus monkeys, are natural hosts of SHFV and typically develop asymptomatic, persistent infections with low level viremia (Bailey et al., 2014b; London, 1977, Lauck et al., 2011, Lauck et al., 2013). SHFV-infected macaques develop fever, facial edema, anorexia, dehydration, depression and coagulation defects indicated by skin petechiae, retrobulbar hemorrhages and subcutaneous hematomas. Death occurs 7\u201313 days after infection (Allen et al., 1968, Palmer et al., 1968, London, 1977). The clinical signs and disease course closely resemble those induced in macaques by other hemorrhagic fever virus infections, such as Ebola Zaire, Marburg, and Lassa (Mahanty and Bray, 2004, Bray and Geisbert, 2005). The presence of persistently infected African NHPs in the NIH primate colony that had several SHFV outbreaks and the use of the same needle for tattooing or tuberculosis testing of multiple NHPs of African and Asian origin are thought to have resulted in inadvertent virus transmission from an African animal to macaques (Allen et al., 1968, Palmer et al., 1968, Tauraso et al., 1968). SHFV is typically transmitted between African NHPs during fighting but can spread efficiently among macaques by both direct and indirect contact (London, 1977, Renquist, 1990).",

In a recent study, sera/plasma samples from 205 baboons from a US colony were tested for SHFV using RT-PCR assays targeted to two conserved sequence regions (Vatter et al., 2015). Of the wild-caught Olive baboons tested, 14.2% were positive for SHFV. However, because sera samples collected at the time of capture were not available, it is not known whether these animals were infected in the wild or after capture. Nineteen percent of the opportunistically sampled animals living in the colony were SHFV-positive. However, because most of the colony animals tested were males that were being treated for lacerations obtained during fighting, the percentage of SHFV-positive animals in the entire colony is expected to be lower. None of the SHFV positive baboons showed any signs of disease. Infections lasting >10 years were documented using serial archived sera samples and the viremia levels were consistently low (100\u20131000 PFU/ml).",

The ability of an SHFV LVR infection to induce proinflammatory cytokine production was compared in M\u03a6s and myeloid (m) DCs differentiated in culture from peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) collected from disease resistant baboons and disease susceptible macaques (Vatter and Brinton, 2014). Both viral RNA replication and virion production were more robust in macaque M\u03a6s and mDCs than in baboon cells (Table 1\n). Approximately \u223c90% of macaque M\u03a6s but only 10% of baboon M\u03a6s were productively infected but the intracellular dsRNA fluorescence signal was similarly bright in the cells from both types of NHPs. In contrast, a similar percentage (\u223c50%) of baboon and macaque mDCs were infected but the intensity of the intracellular dsRNA signal was much higher in macaque mDCs than baboon mDCs suggesting that the higher yield of SHFV produced by macaque mDCs was due to more efficient intracellular virus replication. The mechanisms involved in the observed variations in cell susceptibility have not yet been analyzed.",

UV-inactivated SHFV induced only transient production of IL-6 and IL-1\u03b2 indicating that early stages of the virus lifecycle can induce this response but that sustained pro-inflammatory cytokine production requires virus replication (Vatter and Brinton, 2014). IL-10 signaling leads to upregulation of suppressor of cytokine signaling 3 (SOCS3) (Moore et al., 2001). Cultured baboon M\u03a6s and mDCs expressed higher basal levels of IL-10 than macaque cells and the levels of both the inducible IL-10 receptor subunit 1 (IL-10R1) and SOCS3 were upregulated in SHFV-infected baboon M\u03a6s and mDCs. In contrast, in SHFV-infected macaque M\u03a6s and mDCs, the levels of IL-10R1 were downregulated with time after infection and SOCS3 expression was not induced. Treatment of macaque M\u03a6s and mDCs with recombinant human IL-10 starting prior to or at the time of infection with SHFV suppressed IL-6 and MIP-1\u03b1 but not TNF-\u03b1 production without altering viral yields or cell viability. Treatment of baboon cells with anti-IL-10 antibody did not result in the production of proinflammatory cytokines and SOCS3 expression was upregulated prior to the upregulation of IL-10R1 suggesting that SOCS3 expression may be induced by SHFV infection.",

The 5\u2032 two-thirds of the genome encodes two polyproteins 1a and 1ab. Polyprotein 1ab is produced when a \u22121 ribosomal frameshift occurs on a slippery sequence located near the polyprotein 1a stop codon (Snijder and Spaan, 2006). A second frameshift (\u22122) can occur in nsp2 producing a truncated nsp2 protein with a different C-terminal sequence (nsp2TF) (Fang et al., 2012). Polyproteins 1a and 1ab are posttranslationally cleaved by viral proteases to generate the nonstructural proteins (nsps) involved in replication and transcription of the viral genome and sg mRNAs (Snijder and Meulenberg, 1998, Beerens et al., 2007). The SHFV genome encodes additional proteins at both its 5\u2032 and 3\u2032 ends compared to the genomes of the other known arteriviruses.",

Arterivirus PLP2s are similar to coronavirus PLPs (PLP1, PLP2, and PLpro) in having a catalytic Cys-His-Asp triad and the ability to cleave both in cis and in trans (Mielech et al., 2014). In contrast, arterivirus PLP1s have a Cys-His catalytic tandem (Sun et al., 2009, Xue et al., 2010). EAV, LDV and PRRSV PLP1s were shown to cleave exclusively in cis at a single site downstream of the catalytic domain (Snijder and Spaan, 2006). All of the coronavirus PLPs and the arterivirus PLP2s also have deubiquitinating and deISGylating activities (van Kasteren et al., 2013, Mielech et al., 2014). Most coronavirus PLPs cleave at a canonical -Leu-X-Gly\u2193Gly site but the cleavage sites of arterivirus PLPs are not well conserved (Sun et al., 2009, Xue et al., 2010, Mielech et al., 2014). Autocleavage by LDV and PRRSV PLP1\u03b1 and PLP1\u03b2 generate nsp1\u03b1 and nsp1\u03b2, respectively (den Boon et al., 1995, Sun et al., 2009, Xue et al., 2010) (Fig. 1A). The EAV PLP1\u03b1 domain is inactive due to a Lys substitution of the catalytic Cys residue and a single nsp1 fusion protein is produced (Snijder et al., 1992, Ziebuhr et al., 2000).",

The SHFV LVR nsp1 sequences were homology modeled on crystal structures of PRRSV nsp1\u03b1 and nsp1\u03b2 (Sun et al., 2009, Xue et al., 2010, Vatter et al., 2014b). SHFV nsp1\u03b1 modeled well on the PRRSV nsp1\u03b1 structure and SHFV nsp1\u03b2 modeled well on the PRRSV nsp1\u03b2 structure. SHFV nsp1\u03b3 was modeled on both the PRRSV nsp1\u03b1 and nsp1\u03b2 structures and appeared to be more similar to PRRSV nsp1\u03b1 than to nsp1\u03b2. The catalytic residues of other arterivirus PLP1s were previously identified as a Cys and a His located about 60 amino acids downstream. In all previously studied active arterivirus PLP1s, a Trp follows the catalytic Cys (den Boon et al., 1995, Sun et al., 2009, Xue et al., 2010). Alignment of the three SHFV PLP1 sequences with each other using a conserved GV[Q/T]G motif as an anchor (Vatter et al., 2014b) predicted Cys246 as a catalytic residue of PLP1\u03b2 and Cys378 as a catalytic residue of PLP1\u03b3. Each of these Cys residues was adjacent to a Trp and located 62 and 64 aa upstream, respectively, of the predicted catalytic His. In PLP1\u03b1, the only Cys adjacent to a Trp was Cys115 located only 14 amino acids upstream of the predicted catalytic His. Cys63 located 67 amino acids upstream of the predicted catalytic His aligned with the predicted catalytic Cys residues of SHFV PLP1\u03b2 and PLP1\u03b3 but was adjacent to an Ala. Alignment of SHFV, PRRSV and LDV PLP1\u03b1 sequences also predicted Cys63 as the catalytic Cys. The alignments predicted that SHFV PLP1\u03b1 cleaved at either Gly170/Thr171 or Gly164/Gly165, that PLP1\u03b2 cleaved at Gly350/Gly351 and that PLP1\u03b3 cleaved at Gly484/Gly485.",

In addition to the expected cleavage products, a \u223c30 kDa band was consistently detected in the wild type lysate as well as the Flag and c-Myc immunoprecipitation lanes, suggesting the existence of an extra cleavage site within the PLP1\u03b2 catalytic domain that generated N- and C-terminal \u223c30 kDa cleavage products. Substitution of Cys63 with Ala in PLP1\u03b1 abrogated cleavage between nsp1\u03b1 and nsp1\u03b2 and substitution of Cys378 in PLP1\u03b3 abrogated cleavage between nsp1\u03b3 and nsp2, identifying these Cys as functional catalytic residues (Fig. 1B) (Vatter et al., 2014b). However, substitution of Cys246 with Ala in PLP1\u03b2 reduced but did not inhibit cleavage between nsp1\u03b2 and nsp1\u03b3 suggesting that Cys246 is a PLP1\u03b2 catalytic residue but that another PLP1 can also cleave at the nsp1\u03b2/nsp1\u03b3 junction. Inefficient cleavage at the nsp1\u03b1/nsp1\u03b2 junction as well as within nsp1\u03b2 by PLP1\u03b1 was observed when both the PLP1\u03b2 and PLP1\u03b3 catalytic Cys residues were substituted with Ala. Efficient cleavage at the nsp1\u03b2/nsp1\u03b3 junction as well as within nsp1\u03b2 by PLP1\u03b2 was observed when the catalytic Cys residues of both PLP1\u03b1 and PLP1\u03b3 were mutated. However, efficient cleavage at the nsp1\u03b3/nsp2 junction, within nsp1\u03b2 and also at the nsp1\u03b2/nsp1\u03b3 junction by PLP1\u03b3 was observed when the PLP1\u03b1 and PLP1\u03b2 catalytic Cys residues were mutated indicating that SHFV PLP1\u03b3 can cleave at upstream sites as well as at a downstream site (Fig. 1B).",

This finding was supported by a mass spectroscopy analysis of the immunoprecipitated nsp1\u03b1 cleavage product that detected ten trypsin generated peptides ending at aa164 and only one peptide ending at aa171. Substitution of the predicted Gly350/Gly351 site resulted in loss of cleavage at the nsp1\u03b2/nsp1\u03b3 junction, indicating this is the cleavage site used. Three adjacent Gly residues are present at the predicted cleavage site between nsp1\u03b3 and nsp2. Substitution of either Gly484/Gly485 or Gly485/Gly486 resulted in loss of cleavage between nsp1\u03b3 and nsp2. Mass spectroscopy analyses of immunoprecipitated cleavage products nsp1\u03b1 + \u03b2 and nsp1\u03b1 + \u03b2 + \u03b3 confirmed the locations of the cleavage sites at the nsp1\u03b2/nsp1\u03b3 and nsp1\u03b3/nsp2 junctions. Substitution of the Gly271/Val272 site within nsp1\u03b2 resulted in the loss of cleavage within nsp1\u03b2, indicating that this site can be cleaved in in vitro reactions.",

Cleavage at the Gly271/Val272 site within nsp1\u03b2 in the in vitro assays but not in infected cells could be due to misfolding of some of the in vitro translated polyproteins and/or the lack of posttranslational modifications and/or chaperones.",

The capsid is surrounded by an envelope that contains two major envelope proteins, the non-glycosylated membrane (M) protein and the major glycoprotein (GP5), which form disulfide-linked heterodimers (Delputte et al., 2002, Delputte et al., 2007). Three minor glycoproteins (GPs), GP2, GP3 and GP4, form a complex that is located periodically on the virion envelope (Snijder and Spaan, 2006, Tian et al., 2012). Another minor structural protein E forms oligomers in the virion envelope and is thought to function as an ion-channel during viral entry (Snijder et al., 1999, Lee and Yoo, 2006). An additional recently discovered minor structural protein 5a was detected in purified PRRSV particles and inhibition of 5a expression reduced EAV yields (Johnson et al., 2011a, Sun et al., 2013). SHFV is unique among the arteriviruses in encoding two adjacent sets of four minor structural proteins (Godeny et al., 1998). These genes, listed in their order from 5\u2032 to 3\u2032 in the genome, were recently renamed GP2\u2032, E\u2032, GP3\u2032, GP4\u2032 and E, GP2, GP3, GP4 (Fig. 2A). Notably, the order of the open reading frames (ORFs) encoding the GP2 and E protein orthologs differ between the two sets (Fig. 2B) (Snijder and Spaan, 2006).",

SHFV encodes two adjacent sets of the four minor structural proteins and six sg mRNAs were expected for their expression (Fig. 2C). However, the leader-body junction sequence for an SHFV GP3\u2032 sg mRNA was not detected in a previous study suggesting that SHFV GP2\u2032 and GP3\u2032 were expressed from a bicistronic sg mRNA 2\u2032 (Godeny et al., 1998). The subsequent discovery of an ORF for the E\u2032 protein which overlaps the GP2\u2032 ORF and the demonstration of bicistronic expression of E and GP2 from the EAV sg mRNA 2 (Snijder et al., 1999) made it unlikely that three minor structural proteins, GP2\u2032, E\u2032 and GP3\u2032, would be expressed from the SHFV sg mRNA2\u2032. A recent Northern blotting analysis of the sg mRNAs produced in infected MA104 cells detected six minor structural protein sg mRNAs including one of the size predicted for a separate GP3\u2032 sg mRNA (sg mRNA 3\u2032) (Vatter et al., 2014a). The existence of sg mRNA 3\u2032 was confirmed by leader-body sequencing data. The ORFs for GP2\u2032, E\u2032 and GP3\u2032 were renamed ORF2a\u2032, ORF2b\u2032 and ORF3\u2032, respectively (Fig. 2B). The identification of sg mRNA3\u2032 for GP3\u2032 led to the interesting observation that the relative abundance of the corresponding sg mRNAs in the duplicated sets of the SHFV minor structural proteins was similar, with sg mRNAs 2\u2032 and 2 being more abundant and sg mRNAs 3\u2032, 3, 4\u2032 and 4 being less abundant. This finding indicated that regulation of the expression of the individual minor structural protein sg mRNAs in the duplicated sets is conserved. However, the different order of the ORFs for the GP2 and E orthologs in the two sets suggests that the second set of SHFV minor structural proteins was not generated by a simple gene duplication event.",

However, RNA structures in the 3\u2032 noncoding region (NCR) of the genome and the 3\u2032 terminal region of the minus strand (\u2212) RNA were previously predicted and cell proteins binding to these RNA regions that may be involved in regulating initiation of RNA synthesis were reported (You-Kyung and Brinton, 1998, Maines et al., 2005). Two cell proteins, p56 and p42, that bound specifically to an SHFV 3\u2032(+)NCR RNA probe were identified as polypyrimidine tract-binding protein (PTB) and fructose bisphosphate aldolase A, respectively. PTB binding sites in the SHFV 3\u2032(+)SL structure were mapped to a terminal loop and a bulged region and the aldolase A binding site to a region near the top of the 3\u2032SL. Four SHFV 3\u2032(\u2212) RNA binding cell proteins (103, 86, 55, and 36 kDa) were detected in UV-induced cross-linking assays, and three of these proteins (103, 55, and 36 kDa) were also detected by Northwestern blotting assays. The binding sites for these four cellular proteins were mapped to the region between nt 117 and 184 from the 3\u2032 end of the minus strand RNA. This 68-nt sequence was predicted to form two stem-loops, SL4 and SL5. Additional data obtained with the (+) and (\u2212) 3\u2032 terminal RNAs of other arteriviruses suggested that the RNA elements interacting with the identified cell proteins are conserved among arteriviruses.",

None of these clones produced infectious virus. However, the ability of each clone to produce extracellular virions was assessed by quantitative real-time RT-PCR of extracellular viral RNA levels. Cells transfected with the \u0394GP4\u2032, \u0394GP2 or \u0394GP3 mutant infectious clone RNAs produced a sustained low level of extracellular viral RNA beginning at 24 h after transfection (Table 2\n). In contrast, after transfection of wildtype infectious clone RNA, extracellular viral RNA increased dramatically starting at 96 h after transfection. The lack of amplification of extracellular viral RNA at later times observed for all of the mutants indicated that the extracellular virus particles produced were non-infectious. The \u0394GP4 infectious clone RNA also produced a low level of extracellular viral RNA beginning at 24 h after transfection, but the level was not sustained indicating a potential role for GP4 in virion stability. The \u0394GP2\u2032, \u0394GP3\u2032, \u0394E\u2032 and \u0394E mutant infectious clone RNAs did not produce extracellular viral RNA above background levels suggesting that each of these proteins plays an essential role in virus replication or virion production. No extracellular viral RNA production was detected from MA104 cells transfected with any of the double mutant RNAs. No intracellular viral proteins were detected in lysates from any of the mutant RNA transfected cells by Western blotting, which is consistent with a lack of virus spread. Although the abundance of sg mRNA orthologs for the duplicated sets of SHFV minor structural proteins is similar, the functions of the ortholog proteins are not redundant. The finding that both sets of minor structural proteins are required for efficient production of infectious extracellular virus indicates that SHFV virus production and virion structure are more complex than those of other known arteriviruses.",

M\u03a6s cultures from the two types of animals differed in the percentage of susceptible cells present while mDCs from the two animals differed in their ability to efficiently replicate virus. Consistent with the different symptoms observed in SHFV infected African NHPs and macaques, SHFV infection of cultured macaque M\u03a6s and mDCs induced pro-inflammatory cytokine production while infections in baboon cells did not. The data suggest that there is a balance between upregulation of cell anti-viral and inflammatory responses and viral-mediated counteraction/modulation of these responses that is beneficial to both the host and the virus in African NHPs but not in macaques. All previous isolates of SHFV caused severe hemorrhagic fever disease in macaques but varied in their ability to cause signs of hemorrhagic disease that was rarely fatal in patas monkeys. A new SHFV isolate from persistently infected baboons was able to lytically infect rhesus macaque M\u03a6s and MA104 cells and caused long term asymptomatic persistent infections in baboons but fatal hemorrhagic fever disease in macaques. Although divergent SHFV genome sequences obtained from additional NHP species have recently been reported, data from experimental infection studies with these isolates in different types of NHPs and cells have not yet been reported.",

The additional nsp1 protein nsp1\u03b3 was predicted to be structurally more similar to PRRSV nsp1\u03b1 than to PRRSV nsp1\u03b2. Also, PLP1\u03b3 is able to cleave at upstream as well as downstream sites, which is a characteristic of the PLP2s but not PLP1s of other arteriviruses. Arterivirus PLP2s have a Cya-His-Asp catalytic triad and deubiquitinating as well as deISGylating activities in addition to protease activity. SHFV PLP1\u03b3 has a Cys-His catalytic dyad and is not predicted to have deubiquitinating or deISGylating activity. SHFV nsp1\u03b3 may have originated by a duplication of nsp1\u03b1. It is possible that SHFV PLP1\u03b1 may also be able to cleave upstream but due to its location at the 5\u2032 end of the 1a polyprotein, this ability was not tested. Sequence alignment indicated that the three SHFV PLP1s are more similar to each other than to those of other arteriviruses. Additional functional studies of the SHFV PLP1s, including analysis of possible trans cleavage activities, as well as crystal structures of the three SHFV nsp1s are needed to provide insights about the origin of the additional SHFV nsp1 region.",

The finding that each of the minor structural proteins from both sets is required for the production of infectious SHFV suggests that the SHF virion composition is more complex than that of other known arteriviruses. Cells transfected with mutant viral RNAs that did not express GP2\u2032, GP3\u2032, E, or E\u2032 did not produce extracellular virus particles suggesting that these proteins have essential functions during earlier stages of the virus life cycle. However, some or all of these proteins may also be functionally important for virion infectivity. The EAV, PRRSV and LDV E proteins have a conserved N-terminal myristoylation site (Thaa et al., 2009). The observation of a decrease in virus infectivity and plaque size but not in the yield of extracellular virions when myristoylation was inhibited in EAV-infected cells suggested that E protein myristoylation is required for virion infectivity but not for virion budding (Thaa et al., 2009). This finding is consistent with E protein ion channel function being required for virion entry. The SHFV E protein sequence contains the conserved N-terminal myristoylation site but the SHFV E\u2032 protein sequence does not. Both of the SHFV E proteins appear to have intracellular functions during the virus replication cycle but one or both may also function during virion entry. The SHFV E protein is more homologous to the EAV and LDV E proteins and the orientation of the overlapping E and GP2 ORFs in these three genomes is similar. However, the SHFV E\u2032 is more homologous to the PRRSV E and the SHFV E\u2032 and GP2\u2032 ORFs as well as the PRRSV E and GP2 ORFs are in the opposite orientation (Fig. 2). All of these data support acquisition of an additional set of minor SHFV structural proteins by a recombination event with the genome of another arterivirus than by a \u201cduplication\u201d recombination event between SHFV genomes. All of the newly discovered SHFV genomes in additional species of NHPs that have been recently sequenced encode two similar sets of minor structural proteins indicating that the addition of the second set of genes is not a recent event. The identity of the ancestral arterivirus that contributed the additional set of SHFV minor structural proteins and the circumstances under which a co-infection occurred are not known.",
