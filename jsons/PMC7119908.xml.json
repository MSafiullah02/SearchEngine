Influenza is an infectious disease caused by influenza virus type A or B. The occurrence of influenza, whose viruses are characterized by great seasonal antigenic changeability, may vary in different districts of a country. In Poland, epidemiological surveillance of influenza was implemented in collaboration with primary care physicians and laboratories of 16 Voivodeship (province) Sanitary Epidemiological Station (VSES) as of the 2004/05 epidemic season. The information on influenza and influenza-like infections has been gathered in all districts by means of both Sentinel and non-Sentinel systems. Since the 2013/14 epidemic season, data consisting of the number of samples tested, suspected and confirmed cases of infection, hospitalizations, and deaths in each province are stratified into seven age-groups (Hallmann-Szeli\u0144ska et al. 2016a, b; Bednarska et al. 2015). These data are then further elaborated and randomly checked for correctness of viral identification in the National Influenza Center (NIC) at the National Institute of Public Health-National Institute of Health (NIPH-NIH 2016). The NIC serves as a reference center for individual virological VSES laboratories of the country.",

Primers and probes necessary to carry out the reaction were obtained through the Influenza Reagent Resource (IRR) program from the US Center for Disease Control (CDC) The reaction mixture contained MgSO4, reaction buffer - bovine serum albumin (BSA), RNase free water, and a SuperScript\u00ae III/platinum Taq mix (Invitrogen Life Technologies-Thermo Fisher Scientific; Carlsbad, CA), with the addition of 5 \u03bcL of the previously isolated RNA for each sample. The positive control constituted the RNA strains that were the following vaccine components for the 2015/16 epidemic season/2016: A/H1N1/pdm09 (A/California/7/2009), A/H3N2/Switzerland/9715293/2013, and B/Phuket/3073/2013. As for the negative, RNase-free water was used. Before the start of amplification, the RNA was rewritten to obtain cDNA, using the enzyme reverse transcriptase at 50 \u00b0C for 30 min. Then, samples were analyzed as follows: initialization at 95 \u00b0C for 2 min and 45 cycles of amplification consisting of denaturation at 95 \u00b0C for 15 s, annealing at 55 \u00b0C for 30 s, and elongation at 72 \u00b0C for 2 min.",
