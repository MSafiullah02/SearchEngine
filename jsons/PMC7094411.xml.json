Hong Kong is located in the Pearl River Delta region in southern China where increasing fossil fuel consumption has resulted in a rapid growth of anthropogenic emissions and thereby has led to an increase in air pollution and degradation in visibility (Streets and Waldhoff, 2000). This is attributed to increase in the concentrations of fine particulate matter (PM2.5) and photochemical pollutants, which increase the scattering of light (Sequeira and Lai, 1998a, Ho et al., 2003).",

Air pollution has been identified as a major cause of increasing community costs due to health care utilization and lost productivity (Hedley et al., 2008). Previous studies, which assessed the association between fine particulates and mortality used various measures as indicators of air pollution, including coefficient of extinction, coefficient of haze, and airport visibility to estimate PM2.5 and PM10 (Ozkaynak et al., 1985, Abbey et al., 1995, Ostro, 1995, Vajanapoom et al., 2001, Jerrett et al., 2004). However, apart from two studies, one showing that visibility loss was directly associated with sudden infant death syndrome in Taiwan (Knobel et al., 1995) and a second on the relationship between visibility and population mortality in Shanghai (Huang et al., 2009), no other reports have shown links between visibility and ill health or mortality. We aimed to assess the associations between variations in daily visibility and mortality in Hong Kong for the period 1996\u20132006 using several sensitivity analyses based on the mean visibility recorded at 10:00, 14:00, and 16:00 h, 24 h maximum visibility, different cut-off limits for humidity, and adjustments for air pollutants.",

The main health outcome of this study comprised all known non-accidental deaths of Hong Kong residents (ICD-9:1-799; ICD-10: A00-R99), as well as cardiovascular (ICD-9:390-459; ICD-10:I00-I99), respiratory (ICD-9:460-519; ICD-10:J00-J98), and accidental mortalities (ICD-9: 800-999; ICD-10: S00-T98). We chose two age groups for analyses: all ages and a subgroup aged 65 years and over. An assessment of the discrepancy between the classification of causes of deaths using ICD-9 and ICD-10 showed that agreement between the two coding systems was over 90% (Hong Kong Department of Health, 2005).",

For each mortality outcome, variations in seasonality, trends, mean temperature, and mean humidity of current and previous days (lag 0\u20131) were fitted with penalized cubic regression splines. Dummy variables were used to control the variations for days of the week, holidays, and influenza epidemics. We added a dummy variable for the 2003 severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) epidemic. We chose 4 degrees of freedom (df) per year for smoothing function of the trends and 3 df for temperature and humidity. The choice of df for each smoothing function in the core models was made on the basis of observed residual autocorrelations using partial autocorrelation function (PACF). For the core models fitted to the mortality data, time variant confounding factors were considered as adequately controlled if absolute values of PACF coefficients were <0.1 for the first two lag days and there were no systematic patterns in the PACF plots (Wong et al., 2008a).",

The analytic method used in this study follows the current standard approach adopted in the assessment the of short-term effects of air pollution on mortality in daily time series studies (Samet et al., 2000). An important feature of this method is that the likelihood of confounding effects of visibility is minimized by removing other factors, which may be associated with variations in mortality. Once the core models were determined, visibility was entered to identify associations between visibility and mortality. So all potential observable time variant and unobservable confounding effects would have been reduced. Our data on visibility, air pollutants, mortality, and meteorology are reliable in that they have undergone rigorous quality control procedures performed independently by several government departments.",

Second, it must include recognition that visibility observations are surrogate measures of pollutants and not a measure of exposure, and that they could be misclassified because of the inherently subjective nature of visibility measurements, but these errors would ultimately bias the outcomes towards the null effect.
