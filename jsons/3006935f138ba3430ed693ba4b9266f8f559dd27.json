Due to the outbreak of COVID-19 worldwide, using the computed-aided diagnosis technique for COVID-19 classification based on CT images could largely alleviate the burden of clinicians. In this paper, we propose an Adaptive Feature Selection guided Deep Forest (AFS-DF) for COVID-19 classification based on chest CT images. Specifically, we first extract location-specific features from CT images. Then, in order to capture the high-level representation of these features with the relatively small-scale data, we leverage a deep forest model to learn high-level representation of the features. Moreover, we propose a feature selection method based on the trained deep forest model to reduce the redundancy of features, where the feature selection could be adaptively incorporated with the COVID-19 classification model. We evaluated our proposed AFS-DF on COVID-19 dataset with 1495 patients of COVID-19 and 1027 patients of community acquired pneumonia (CAP). The accuracy (ACC), sensitivity (SEN), specificity (SPE) and AUC achieved by our method are 91.79%, 93.05%, 89.95% and 96.35%, respectively. Experimental results on the COVID-19 dataset suggest that the proposed AFS-DF achieves superior performance in COVID-19 vs. CAP classification, compared with",

Specifically, as shown in Fig. 1 , we first extract the locationspecific features from the chest CT image. Then, a deep forest model [15] is introduced to learn the latent high-level representations of these features, which can effectively describe the high-level information within the extracted location-specific features by using a small-scale training data. Intuitively, the use of the feature selection could promote the performance of the classification task. Hence, in our study, we also introduce a task-driven feature selection method to adaptively reduce the redundancy of features. In particular, the feature selection operation will discard a portion of unimportant features based on the feature importance which is calculated from trained forests in each deep forest layer. Hence, the feature selection and classifier training are adaptively incorporated into a unified framework. Finally, the trained adaptive feature selection guided deep forest is used for COVID-19 prediction.",

The infected lung regions are mainly related to mosaic sign, ground glass opacity (GGO), lesion-related signs (air bronchogram) and interlobular septal thickening. The lung fields include left lung, right lung, five lung lobes, and eighteen pulmonary segments. Then, we extract four kinds of locationspecific handcrafted features, including volume, infected lesion number, histogram distribution and surface area from chest CT images.

Since there are evidence that pneumonia caused by COVID-19 more likely occurs in both right and left lungs, we also calculate the infected lesion difference as well as the percentage difference between left and right lungs. 2) Infected lesion number: In comparison to CAP, most of the COVID-19 infections encompass bilateral lungs with multifocal involvement [6] , [7] , and COVID-19 generally has concentrated infection lesions while CAP shows small in volume and patchy in distribution [18] . Therefore, we calculate the features of the total number of infected regions in the bilateral lungs, lung lobes, and pulmonary segments, respectively. 3) Histogram distribution: The predominant chest CT findings show that bilateral and peripheral GGO and consolidation are a radiologic hallmark of COVID-19 [19] , [20] . GGO is a pattern of hazy increased lung opacity with preservation of bronchial and vascular margins, whereas consolidation is characterized by a homogeneous increase in lung parenchymal attenuation",

Finally, based on the location-specific features, the trained FAS-DF is adopted for COVID-19 identification task. that obscures the margins of vessels and airway walls on CT images [18] . To extract the intensity distribution of the infected regions in chest CT images, we calculated the histogram features of the infected regions. 4) Surface area: In previous study [21] , it has been found that COVID-19 had a predominate distribution in the posterior and peripheral lung, and the abnormalities of lung parenchyma eventually spread to the central area and bilateral upper lobes [6] . Therefore, we constructed the infection surface as well as the lung boundary surface. We further calculated the distance of each infection surface vertex to the nearest lung boundary surface, and categorized them into 5 ranges, i.e., 3, 6, 9, 12 and 15 voxels. For each feature, the number of infection surface vertices within each range of distances to the lung wall is calculated. Furthermore, the percentage of infection vertex number against the number of whole infection surface vertices in each range is also considered. 5) Radiomics features: Radiomics features extracted from infected lesions, including intensity features (e.g., average gray level intensity, range of gray values) and texture features (e.g., gray level co-occurrence matrix, graylevel run-length matrix, gray-level size-zone matrix, and neighborhood gray-tone difference matrix) are used in our study.

            "text": "From Table II , we can observe that our AFS-DF archives the best results in the terms of ACC, SEN, SPE and AUC. In particular, our AFS-DF method achieves the highest classification accuracy (i.e., 91.79%), which is better than the LR (i.e., 89.81%), SVM (i.e., 89.97%), RF (i.e., 89.41%) and NN (i.e., 89.53%). In general, the proposed AFS-DF achieves 1.98%, 1.82%, 2.38% and 1.83% improvements in terms of ACC over the LR, SVM, RF and NN, respectively. The possible reason for improvements is that our AFS-DF not only leverages the high-level feature representation by using the deep forest to improve the performance of COVID-19 vs. CAP, but also employs the discriminative features by using the adaptive feature selection process. The deep methods (i.e., NN and AFS-DF) show better classification accuracy in task of diagnosis of COVID-19 when compared with the conventional classifiers (i.e., LR, SVM and RF). The possible reason is that, the deep models can learn the high-level feature representative, which can boost the classification performance. It is worth noting that COVID-19 is the highly contagious disease, the higher SEN should have practically meaningful advantage for timely COVID-19 diagnosis to prevent the spread of the COVID-19. The SEN achieved by our AFS-DF for COVID-19 vs. CAP is 93.05%, which is better than other baseline methods. These results imply that using the adaptive feature selection guided deep forest model can improve the identification ability of COVID-19. As shown in Fig 3, our proposed AFS-DF method produces the best classification performance when compared with the baseline methods. These results further validate that using the high-level representation and adaptive feature selection strategy could improve the performance for COVID-19 vs. CAP classification. The statistics of feature importance of extracting location-specific features is shown in Fig. 4 . We calculate the sum of feature importance of location-specific features over the last layer in 5 trained AFS-DF model. Fig. 4 shows that the surface area features have importance influence for COVID-19 classification.",

Lasso is used to select a discriminative subset of features from the feature vector by using l 1 -norm sparsity constraint. The parameter for the sparsity constraint in this method is set as 0.001 by using cross-validation. In ElasticNet, a l 1 -norm is leveraged to reduce dimension of extracted features. Also, a l 2 -norm is further introduced into the classification model to ensure the smoothness of the linear model. The parameters for the sparsity constraint and smoothness constraint in ElasticNet are set as 0.001 and 0.1 by using cross-validation, respectively. DF is a variant of the proposed AFS-DF, which employs the same architecture as our AFS-DF model without feature selection block. Note that this variants method has same parameters setting with AFS-DF for training and test in our study. The experimental results are reported in Table IV . As shown in Table IV , the proposed AFS-DF achieves the best classification performance, when compared with Lasso, ElasticNet and DF. In particular, compared with the feature selection methods (i.e., Lasso and ElasticNet), the proposed AFS-DF achieves better performance by using the high-level feature representation. Meanwhile, by using the adaptive feature selection operation, the AFS-DF achieve a better performance when compared with DF. These results imply the effectiveness of the proposed AFS-DF.",

We evaluate these six methods for COVID-19 vs. CAP classification, with the results reported in Table V.
