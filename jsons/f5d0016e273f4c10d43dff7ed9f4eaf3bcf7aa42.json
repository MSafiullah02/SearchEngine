During the investigation of death cases with SARS, the close-contact information was obtained indirectly, which might affect the validity of results to some extent. Second, although efforts were made to sample SARS cases from all the provinces of mainland China, the availability was different in different affected areas and among the different populations affected. Therefore, selective bias was unavoidable. Finally, the SARS diagnosis at present is based mainly on symptoms and physical signs, and no specific diagnostic tests are available. Thus, although most of the probable SARS cases in this study were selected from clear transmission chains of SARS, and although some of the cases were further confirmed by the SARS-associated coronavirus antibody test, there might still be case misclassification bias. Despite these possible limitations, we believe that our results are, so far, the most reliable and available.
