Therefore, it is often necessary to utilise other means to arrive at a likely diagnosis. The most helpful of these is the literary description of the disease. While this is often the best evidence available, working with such documents can prove difficult. Three great plagues of the ancient world, the Plague of Athens, the Antonine Plague, and the Justiniac Plague are described in either Latin or ancient Greek. The difficulties encountered when translating any ancient foreign language are compounded by the fact that so many words in these languages have a variety of meanings. This chapter reviews the three great plagues of antiquity from a clinical perspective.",

            "text": "At the present time, sophisticated analytical methods are available to analyse ancient DNA in preserved tissue samples, permitting accurate identification of microorganisms present in samples from ancient animal and human remains (Cooper and Poinar 2000) . As with the historical approach, there are problems with DNA-dependent technologies. The first difficulty using the scientific approach is to find suitably preserved samples to analyse. Just as there are problems with historical interpretation, so there are also problems with palaeomicrobiology (Hofreiter et al. 2001; P\u00e4\u00e4bo 1989) . Firstly, there are relatively few geographical areas that have climatic conditions suitable for the preservation of tissue specimens in a state amenable to DNA analysis (Zink et al. 2002) . The most likely situations in which DNA is likely to be preserved are in the dryness of the desert, in desiccated mummies, or tissues preserved in ice/glaciers (Jackson et al. 1998 ). DNA of microbial organisms or parasites from such specimens is likely to be well preserved and to lend itself readily to palaeomicrobiologic analyses (Arriaza et al. 1995; Li et al. 1999 , Meers 1985 Reid et al. 2000 , Rollo et al 2000 Spencer and Howe 2004; Taubenberger et al. 1997; Tumpey et al. 2004; Zink et al. 2002) . Unfortunately, many of the ancient plagues that we are aware of from historical records did not occur in areas with favourable climatic conditions that would lend themselves to the preservation of analysable DNA samples (Antia et al. 2003; Brothwell and Sandison 1967; Cockburn 1971; Hofreiter et al. 2001; Zink et al. 2002) . The ancient plagues of Egypt occurred in dry areas, but were not preserved in mummified remains.",

There are further problems with DNA specimen analysis, which has a corollary in contemporary clinical infectious diseases. In infectious diseases, one of the most fundamental determinations is to differentiate colonisation from infection. Similarly, in palaeomicrobiology, the mere recovery of an organism from an ancient preserved specimen does not necessarily implicate a role for this organism as the pathogen responsible for the demise of the individual whose remains are being analysed. The recovery of Salmonella typhi in areas endemic for enteric fevers as well as malaria and a variety of other infectious diseases, does not necessarily imply that the organism was causally related to the patient's demise. For example, if a patient who has pulmonary tuberculosis dies of coronary artery disease, the presence of tuberculosis does not necessarily imply that tuberculosis was the cause of death. Nevertheless, the study of palaeomicrobiology has contributed greatly to our understanding of the ancient microbial milieu of humans and animals (Antia et al. 2003; Brothwell and Sandison 1967; Cockburn 1971; McNeill 1976) .",

The types of specimen that lend themselves most readily to analysis are those that are likely to survive the ravages of time, i.e. teeth, bone specimens, coproliths, etc. Palaeopathology, the study of pathological changes in ancient remains, has been very important in confirming the presence of various diseases in ancient times. Because palaeopathology depends upon observable pathological changes in ancient specimens, palaeopathology is most useful in identifying infectious diseases with observable pathological changes. Skeletal syphilis and tuberculosis are examples of infectious diseases that produce characteristic changes in bone, which are readily recognisable in palaeopathological specimens (Arriaza et al. 1995; Brothwell and Sandison 1968; Kiple 1993) . Infectious diseases that kill rapidly leave no traces in teeth, bone, or coproliths, which is problematic. In the absence of permanently preserved specimens, how would scientists in the future determine the presence/lethality of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) in tissue from cadaveric specimens from Asia? Palaeomicrobiology has been most successful in demonstrating bacteria, Rickettsia, and parasite ova (Drancourt and Raoult 2005) .",

Although epidemiological analyses provide the background for the endemic illnesses in ancient populations, they do not explain the causes of the various plagues described in the ancient world (Kiple 1993) . Until there is incontrovertible proof based upon methodologically sound science, the best current and future approach of trying to determine the etiology of epidemics in the ancient world is to combine the epidemiological information from palaeopathology with the continuing advances made in palaeomicrobiology, and this information should be used in conjunction with historical analyses (Cunha 2004b; Cunha and Cunha 2006) . This chapter will take a historical approach combined with what is currently known from palaeomicrobiological and palaeopathological information to review the likely causes of three key ancient plagues of the past.",

            "text": "While palaeopathology is probably the best way to obtain a definitive diagnosis of an ancient disease, it is not always possible. Due to the difficulty of obtaining tissue samples from victims of the ancient plagues, it is not always possible to utilise the technique of palaeomicrobiology to determine the etiology of ancient infection (Cooper and Poinar 2000; Drancourt and Raoult 2005; Hofreiter et al. 2001; Zink et al. 2002) . Therefore, it is often necessary to utilise other means to arrive at a likely diagnosis. The most helpful of these is a primary literary description of the disease. While this is often the best evidence available, working with these sorts of documents can prove difficult. When it comes to discussing the three great plagues of the ancient world, the Plague of Athens, the Antonine Plague, and the Justiniac Plague, the descriptions are in either Latin or ancient Greek. Therefore, The difficulties encountered when translating any ancient foreign language are compounded by the fact that so many words in these languages have a variety of meanings. Additionally, due to the precision required in medical documentation, any word or phrase that is interpreted in a way other than that intended by the original author can skew a description toward or away from the actual diagnosis (Cunha 2004b; Littman and Littman 1973; Major 1978; Procopius 1981) . While Thucydides' chronicle of the plague is exquisitely detailed, variation in translation makes it impossible to definitively determine the causative agent (Page 1953; Parry 1969; Shrewsbury 1950; Thucydides 1919) . Because of this, the only way to confirm a suspected diagnosis would be through the use of palaeomicrobiology (Drancourt and Raoult 2005) . Indeed, a mass grave immediately outside Athens has been unearthed, but has not yet been analysed -until it is, debate will continue.",

By 431 B.C. the Peloponnesian War between Athens and Sparta had begun in earnest. Athens had only to survive the Spartan assault in order to claim victory, while the Spartans would have to conquer the city of Athens itself. Pericles, the leader of Athens, realised this and called for the Athenians to surrender their territory in Attica and to move all people in Athens, and in the regions immediately surrounding it, into the city itself, which was protected by the great Themistoclean walls. These walls guarded the city proper, and provided a fortified connection with the harbour of Piraeus, 9 km from the city. Taking into account the Athenian's well-established naval superiority as well as their safe access to a protected port, it seemed as though taking Athens would be next to impossible for the Spartans. However, by 404 B.C., several events occurred that resulted in the total defeat of Athens and her allies. Most significant of these is the great Plague of Athens, described so accurately by Thucydides, the Greek historian. The plague struck Athens early in the conflict, during the summer of 430 B.C., and drastically reduced the population of the city, devastating Athenian society (Bollet 1987; Brothwell and Sandison 1967; Kiple 1993 ). There has been much debate by both physicians and classicists as to the exact cause of the plague and neither group has come to a consensus. Although Thucydides was not a trained physician, he was most certainly an astute observer, and was careful to utilise the medical vocabulary of his era. Thucydides himself contracted and survived the plague, thus granting modern interpreters a precise and detailed account of the disease.",

In other cases, there was no apparent cause, but suddenly, healthy men were seized first with mighty fevers in the head, and redness, and inflamed eyes, and the inside, both the throat and tongue, immediately became blood-red and emitted an atypical, foul breath. After which came sneezing and hoarseness, and in not much time the pain descended into the chest, and produced a severe cough; and when it fixed in the stomach, it upset it, and vomiting of bile of every kind named by physicians ensued, accompanied by great suffering. In most cases nonproductive retching followed, giving way to violent spasms, which lessened, in some sooner, in others, not until much later. Externally, the body was not very hot to the touch, and was not pale, rather, it was reddened, livid, and flowering with small blisters and wounds. But their insides burned so hotly, that the patients could not bare garments or fine cloths being laid on them, nor be anything but naked, and would have liked best to hurl themselves into cold water, as in fact, many of those neglected did, throwing themselves into cisterns, tormented by unquenchable thirst. And it was the same whether they drank much or little. Also, they were ceaselessly tormented by the inability to rest or sleep. And the body, while the disease flourished, did not wither, but, contrary to expectations, withstood the ravages of the disease; so that when they died, as most did, on the seventh or ninth day from the burning heat, they still had some strength. But if they escaped this, the disease descended into the bowels, resulting in a great ulceration, and at the same time, acute diarrhoea. And many later died from exhaustion because of this. For the disease, ran from above, in the head, where it first settled, throughout the whole body, and if one survived the worst, it left its mark on the extremities. For it fell upon the genitals, and the tips of the hands and the feet, and even having lost these parts, many survived,. Some also lost their eyes. Others again were taken with a complete loss of memory after recovery, and they failed to know either themselves or friends.",

            "text": "For over 2,000 years, physicians of every era have attempted to analyse Thucydides' writings and deduce the precise etiology of the Plague of Athens. Among the most likely diseases to have caused the plague of Athens are bubonic plague, typhoid fever, smallpox, measles, and epidemic typhus. All of these diseases were endemic to the ancient world and potentially fit the symptoms described by Thucydides (Longrigg 1980; McNeill 1976; Roberts and Manchester 2005; Shrewsbury 1950; Thucydides 1989) . Unfortunately, the limitations presented by translation of the original Greek preclude a facile diagnosis, although it is possible to provide a satisfactory theory on the cause of the plague based upon the evidence provided by Thucydides. However, when carefully analysed, there is one disease that seems to fit the vast majority of symptoms more than the others (Kiple 1993; Osler 1876a Osler , 1876b . In modern times, whenever the word plague is mentioned to describe a disease, the most common thought is, of course, bubonic plague (Antia et al. 2003; Brothwell and Sandison 1967; Cockburn 1971) . Boccaccio and others have passed down accurate descriptions of outbreaks of bubonic plague that occurred in Europe, and each resembles its fellows, but none of them bear a great likeness to Thucydides' account of the Plague of Athens. Indeed, the only symptoms of bubonic plague present in Athens during the plague years were fever and runny nose. Only if the Greek 'jluktainaiV mikraiV' and 'elkoV', meaning 'small blisters' and 'wounds', respectively, are interpreted as buboes, which is a linguistic stretch, would bubonic plague seem at all possible. However, none of the other features mentioned by Thucydides occur in bubonic plague outbreaks, suggesting that bubonic plague is a very unlikely cause of the Plague of Athens (Cunha 2004b; Page 1953; Shrewsbury 1950) .",

While the fever and diarrhoea are highly suggestive of typhoid, they are the only major symptoms that would indicate typhoid as the source of the plague. Typhoid fever requires fecal contamination of the water or food supply with Salmonella typhi, which could most definitely have occurred in the cramped, overpopulated conditions of wartime Athens. Even the rash, which is characterised by the presence of \"rose spots\", does not fit well with Thucydides' described rash. Additionally, typhoid usually causes death after 2-3 weeks, much longer than described by Thucydides. Also, typhoid fever does not confer complete immunity, while the Plague of Athens offered complete immunity in survivors. Finally, typhoid fever can be fatal, but usually does not approach a 25% mortality rate. It is for these epidemiological and clinical reasons that typhoid fever does not appear to be the cause of the Plague of Athens (Cunha 2004b; Cunha and Cunha 2006; Kiple 1993) .",

            "text": "Smallpox is one of the diseased theorised to have caused the plague. This particular hypothesis, while put forward by many physicians over the years, was first suggested by the Persian physician Rhazes in 900 A.D. Thucydides' description has many features typical of smallpox. In particular, the rapid onset, fever, rash, and inflamed eyes all point to smallpox. Occurring in many forms, conventional smallpox or hemorrhagic smallpox is believed by some to be the most likely cause of the plague. Those who support the conventional smallpox hypothesis believe that the small blisters and wounds are indicative of the highly characteristic vesicles of smallpox. However, smallpox vesicles first appear as macules at the hairline and progress down from the face to the trunk, and that does not seem to be the rash that Thucydides describes. \"Internal heat\" has been mentioned in some smallpox cases, as has loss of vision, and gangrene of the extremities, but many other prominent symptoms are lacking. If hemorrhagic smallpox, the most lethal form of the disease, was the cause, then the vesicles of conventional smallpox would not develop, but rather a general petechial or purpuric rash, that is to say a rash characterised by small spots resulting from subcutaneous hemorrhage, would appear. Hemorrhagic smallpox bears a greater resemblance to Thucydides' description than the conventional form and would seem to be a very likely candidate for the cause of the plague. However, hemorrhagic smallpox never occurs independently of a conventional smallpox outbreak and, as such, Thucydides' description does not seem to be a description of a smallpox outbreak in Athens (Oldstone 1998; Osler 1876a Osler , 1876b . In addition, the distribution of the rash and the lack of other symptoms all argue against smallpox being responsible for the plague of Athens (Aufderheide and Rodriguez-Martin 1998; Cunha 2002,; Cunha 2004a Cunha , 2004b Fenner et al. 1988; Hopkins 2002; Osler 1876a Osler , 1876b Osler , 1892 Ricketts 1908) .",

When thinking of measles today, most conjure up the idea of a childhood disease, made less virulent by vaccination programs, incapable of inflicting the sort of damage witnessed in Athens in 430 B.C. However, when introduced to nonimmune populations, as happened on the Fiji Islands in 1875, mortality rates in all age groups approach the numbers described by Thucydides. Supporting measles as the cause of the plague are the rash, respiratory symptoms, restlessness, and \"internal heat\". Indeed, victims of the Fiji epidemic were often reported to throw themselves into rivers to find respite from the sensation of intense internal heat, strikingly similar to what the Athenians did in an attempt to alleviate their unbearable \"inner heat\". All this would seem to lead to a diagnosis of measles as the cause. However, measles rarely, if ever, presents with diarrhoea or gangrene, and the fact that Thucydides mentions these suggests they were present in most cases, rather than being rare occurrences among the sick. Moreover, neurological complications are rare in measles, which further suggests that measles did not, in fact, afflict Athens during the Peloponnesian War (Brothwell and Sandison 1967; Cartwright 1972; Cunha 2004a Cunha , 2004b .",

            "text": "Thucydides' description suggests that epidemic typhus was very likely the disease that ravaged Athens. Carried by lice, typhus has historically struck during times of war when a large population is forced to live in a relatively confined space, something that certainly would characterise Athens during the Peloponnesian War. This would allow a lice-infested individual to enter Athens through the port of Piraeus, which was the lifeline of Athens, and infect the entire city, killing close to one-quarter of the population. Considering the wartime conditions in Athens, which undoubtedly eliminated the typically excellent hygiene of Athenians, replacing it with the unsanitary habits of those who dwelled outside the city, it is very likely that epidemic typhus could have quickly spread throughout the population. Typhus is typically characterised by fever, red eyes, a truncal rash, and respiratory symptoms. Neurological complications are common, and may have been responsible for the blindness and the memory loss described. However, the most compelling arguments supporting epidemic typhus as the cause are the diarrhoea and gangrene, both of which are common in epidemic typhus. Finally, exhaustion is characteristic of those who die of this disease, and this is a feature clearly described by Thucydides. By analysing the clinical features described by Thucydides, it seems that it was in fact epidemic typhus that caused the great Plague of Athens (McNeill 1976; Osler 1892; Shrewsbury 1950; Tumpey et al. 2004 ; Table 1 .1). However, a definite etiology cannot be determined with certainty by clinical/historical means alone. The difficulties in using the historical approach are best illustrated using the Plague of Athens as a prime example (Christie 1969; Cunha 2004b; Cunha and Cunha 2006; Page 1953; Shrewsbury 1953 ).",

Having thus been introduced into the Roman world, it spread rapidly, lasting until 270 A.D., claiming the lives of millions of Romans, including the Emperor Marcus Aurelius himself. Travelling via the Roman trade routes, there were even reports of the plague spreading as far east as China.

Undoubtedly, since measles, typhus, and smallpox have many of the same characteristics found in Galen's plague descriptions, such as the \"internal heat\", and foul breath, the type of vesicles must be looked to in order to differentiate between the three most likely possibilities. However, Galen's statement that the exanthem was pustular and later became blackened is highly suggestive of the pustular stage of a smallpox rash most often seen in hemorrhagic smallpox. Because of this evidence, smallpox seems to fit; however, there is one problem with that diagnosis (Kiple 1993; Tumpey et al. 2004 ; Table 1 .2) Smallpox confers complete immunity, which would seem to work against the plague's recurrences later in the third century. Nevertheless, it is possible, and very likely, that these recurrences were merely instances of the plague entering previously unaffected areas of the Empire, making smallpox a perfectly viable cause. Therefore, after considering all the information regarding the symptoms of the diseases, Galen's description of a pustular rash indicates that the Antonine Plague was, in fact, an outbreak of smallpox (Littman and Littman 1973; McNeill 1976 It is clear that the scope of the plague was enormous, and impacted all levels of Roman life. Indeed, for an Empire so dependent on manpower for its financial, agricultural and military infrastructure, the plague was a crippling event from which the Empire never truly recovered. Ultimately, it can be said that the Antonine Plague had a profound negative impact on the spiritual, political, economic, social, and military aspects of the Roman Empire. Together with military defeats at the hands of the German tribes, the Antonine Plague most definitely set Rome on her long decline to ruin (Fears 2004; Gilliam 1961 ).",

While the power of the western Empire slowly waned, the eastern part of the Empire maintained its presence and, with it, the spirit of the Roman Empire. When Justinian took power in the east, he brought with him a dream of resurrecting the old might of Rome by reuniting the eastern and western portions of the Empire, and he was almost able to accomplish this. After securing his northern and eastern borders, Justinian began his campaign in the west in 532 A.D. Initially he met with great success, retaking much of Rome's lost territory. The new emperor had recaptured North Africa, Carthage, Sicily, parts of Hispania, and even large sections of the Italian peninsula. Indeed, by 540 A.D. German resistance was collapsing, and Justinian hoped to launch an attack into Gaul and possibly Britain as well. It seemed as though the reign of Justinian would be one of renewed glory and vigour for the Roman Empire, but all that changed when the Justiniac Plague struck in 542 A.D. (Brothwell and Sandison 1967) . Most likely carried from Africa, where it originated, to Constantinople and the rest of the Empire in a shipment of grain from Egypt, it was easy for the disease to spread along the trade routes of Rome. The enclosed city of Constantinople, as was the case with Athens during the Peloponnesian War, would have provided ideal conditions for the proliferation of the disease throughout the city's population (Bollet 1987) .",

But it split, and in one direction came toward Alexandria and the rest of Egypt, and in the other it came to Palestine bordering Egypt, and from there spread everywhere, always moving forward and going whenever time favoured it. For it seemed to move by a set plan and delayed in each land for a certain time, casting its blight leniently on none, but spreading in either direction right out to the ends of the world, as if afraid that some corner of the Earth might escape it. For it spared neither island nor cave nor mountain that had human inhabitants; and if it had passed over any land, either not affecting the men there or touching them in an inconsequential fashion, at a later time it still came back; then those who lived near this land, whom formerly it had most gravely afflicted, it did not touch at all, but it did not leave the place in question until it had given up its just and proper toll of dead, which corresponded exactly to the number killed at the earlier time among those who lived nearby. And this disease always started on the coast and from there moved to the interior. And in the second year it reached Byzantium in the midst of spring, where I happened to be staying at the time. And it came thusly. Many people saw the spirits of divine beings in human form of every kind, and, as it happened, those who encountered them thought that they were struck, in this or that part of the body, by the man they had met; and immediately seeing this apparition they were also seized by the disease. Now at first those who met these creatures tried to turn them aside by uttering the holiest of names and exorcising them in other ways as best each one could, but they accomplished absolutely nothing, for even in the sanctuaries, where the most of them fled for refuge, they were dying constantly. But later on they were unwilling to even listen to their friends when they called to them, and they shut themselves up in their rooms and pretended they did not hear, although their doors were being beaten down, fearing that he who was calling was one of those spirits. But in the case of some, the pestilence did not come in this way, but they saw a vision in a dream and seemed to suffer the very same thing at the hands of the creature who stood over them, or else to hear a voice prophesising that they were written down in the number of those who were to die. But with most it happened that the disease seized them without being made aware of what would come by a waking vision or a dream. And they were taken as follows.",

But the body showed no change in its original color, neither was it as hot as expected when struck by the fever, nor did any inflammation occur, but the fever was of such a lethargic kind from its onset until the evening that it would not give any suspicion of danger either to the sick themselves or to a physician. Therefore, it was natural that none of those who had contracted the disease expected to die because of it. But in some cases on the same day, in others on the following day, and in the rest, not many days later, a bubonic swelling developed, there in the groin of body, which is below the abdomen, but also in the armpit, and also behind the ear and at different places along the thighs. Up to this point, then, everything occurred the same way with all who had taken the disease. But from then on very distinct differences developed for there ensued for some a deep coma, with others a violent delirium, but, in either case, they suffered the characteristic symptoms of the disease. For those who were under the spell of the coma forgot all those who were familiar to them, and seemed to lie, sleeping constantly. And if anyone cared for them, they would eat without waking, but some also were neglected, and these would die directly through lack of sustenance. But those who were seized with delirium suffered from insomnia and were victims of a distorted imagination; for they suspected that men were coming to them to destroy them, and they would become excited and rush off in flight, crying out at the top of their voices. And those who were attending them were in a state of constant exhaustion and had a most difficult time. For this reason everybody pitied them no less than the sufferers, not because they were threatened by the pestilence by going near it, for neither physicians nor other persons were found to contract this plague through contact with the sick or with the dead, for many who were constantly engaged either in burying or in attending those in no way connected with them survived in the performance of this service beyond all expectation, while with many others the disease came on without warning and they died immediately; but they pitied them because of the great hardships which they were undergoing. For when the patients fell from their beds and lay rolling on the floor, they kept putting them back in place, and when they were struggling to rush headlong out of their houses, they would force them back by shoving and pulling against them. And when water happened to be nearby, they wished to fall into it, not so much because of a desire for drink, for the most of them rushed into the sea, but the cause was to be found chiefly in the diseased state of their minds.",

And one would suppose that in all cases the same thing would have been true, but since they did not all have their senses, some were unable to feel the pain; for owing to the troubled condition of their minds they lost all sense of feeling.",

Moreover, I am able to declare this, that the most illustrious physicians predicted that many would die, who, shortly afterwards, unexpectedly escaped from suffering entirely, and physicians declared that many would be saved, who were destined to be carried off almost immediately. So it was that in this disease there was no cause that came within the realm of human understanding; for in all cases the issue tended to be something unaccountable. Now in those cases where the swelling rose to an unusual size and a discharge of pus had set in, it happened that they escaped from the disease and survived, for clearly the acute condition of the swelling found relief in this direction, and this proved to be, in general, an indication of returning health; but in cases where the swelling maintained its former appearance, there ensued those troubles which I have just mentioned. And with some of them the thigh withered, in which case, though the swelling was there, it did not develop the least suppuration. With others who survived, the tongue did not remain unaffected, and they lived on either lisping or speaking incoherently and with difficulty.",

Additionally, as Procopius describes, much of the surviving population of the Empire, who had become infected but did not perish, suffered from the debilitating and crippling neurological effects of the plague (Bollet 1987; Cartwright 1972) .",

These disastrous effects on the Roman Empire were compounded by the fact that the plague did not affect the less organised, \"barbarian\" societies Most likely etiology based on clinical/historical analysis outside of Rome's borders. This, in large part, was due to the fact that the highly developed internal structure of the Roman Empire actually facilitated the spread of bubonic plague along Rome's trade routes. The less centralised, foreign civilisations bordering the Roman Empire were, therefore, far less likely to have plague spread rapidly through their populations (McNeill 1976) . It is, of course, impossible to claim that the eventual destruction of the Roman Empire was brought about solely by this plague, but it can be said that because of the Justiniac Plague, the Roman Empire lost any initiative it had recovered following the Antonine Plague. The plague so weakened the Eastern Roman Empire that it never truly recovered, and led to the eventual, complete collapse of the last remnants of the once mighty Roman Empire (Cunha and Cunha 2006; Kiple 1993 ).",

            "text": "The three great ancient plagues provide prime examples of the limitations and accuracy of clinical/historical analysis. Clinical historical analysis provides increasing diagnostic certainty going from the indeterminate certainty of the Plague of Athens, to more certainty with the Antonine Plague, and absolute certainty with the Justinian Plague. The challenges for the future are to find additional tissue samples that have sufficiently preserved microbiological DNA, which hopefully will provide definitive information on the cause of some of the ancient plagues (Drancourt and Raoult 2005) . Mass burial sites that have previously remained uncovered may be found in the future, and analysis of such remains put in the correct clinical context can provide invaluable information regarding the infectious disease etiology of the causes of various ancient epidemics. Historical analysis will continue to be important because it provides the clinical descriptions of diseases, which may be the same as or different from current clinical descriptions of various infectious diseases (Brothwell and Sandison 1967; Kiple 1993) . The historical approach is compounded by difficulties with infectious diseases that no longer exist, that occurred abruptly or more likely evolved over time, which created such mass devastation and then disappeared into the fog of history. Palaeomicrobiology is also of great importance in helping to sort out the evolution of infectious diseases on a microbe by microbe basis. A great breakthrough in palaeopathology has been the demonstration of microbial DNA in dental pulp specimens Raoult 2002, 2004; Drancourt et al. 2005; Raoult et al. 2000) . Bacteria early in bacteremia are trapped in dental pulp and preserved if the victim's teeth are preserved/found. To date, dental pulp DNA analysis is the only way to accurately identify microbial DNA from rapidly fatal infections of the past (Drancourt et al. 1998 ). Thus, although the future analyses of ancient plagues will still use the historical method as the foundation, as more well-preserved specimens are uncovered from ancient sites, and more DNA techniques are refined and standardised, ever more important information on the evolution of infectious disease agents as well as their role in ancient plagues will continue to interest and amaze us.",
