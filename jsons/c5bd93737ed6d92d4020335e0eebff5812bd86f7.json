Rigorous implementation of these four traditional counter-measures helped in halting the earlier epidemic of SARS-CoV in 2002 -2003 (Kundapur, 2020 ; Wilder-Smith and Freedman, 2020). As of May 8, 2020, infections across India have surged past 53,000 cases with 1783 deaths reported. The government of India has implemented these containment and mitigating interventions along with travel restrictions and lockdown of the entire country to slow down the spread of the virus. Epidemiological assessment using infectious disease modelling is the key to evaluate the impact of these measures on transmission dynamics of COVID-19 in India, and thus provide crucial information to the policy makers in government organizations to plan ahead for an effective and sustained public health response to manage the epidemic.",

Wang et al. (2020) have developed a health informatics toolbox with an R package called eSIR to understand epidemiological trend of COVID -19 in Hubei province and other regions of China. Their model considers a time varying quarantine factor to forecast future trend of COVID -19 spread in these regions. An earlier study by Chinazzi et al. (2020) assessed the impact of such restrictions based on data of over 3200 sub-populations in roughly 200 different countries and territories across the world.

A SIR model is developed by Singh and Adhikari (2020) based on data up to the first phase of India's total lockdown to illustrate the need of sustained lockdowns with periodic relaxations. Some other recent work on COVID-19 in India include (Tiwari, 2020; Gupta et al., 2020) All these studies on COVID-19 infection dynamics in India are based on the assumption of constant disease transmission rate. However, phase-wise imposition of travel restrictions, lockdown and other non-pharmaceutical preventive measures, as well as increasing community level awareness with time, are expected to induce time varying effects in the transmission rate.",

Such phases are expected to exhibit different rates of transmission of the disease, i.e., transmission rates become timedependent. If we assume that the change (or reduction) in the transmission rate is strictly because of macro level measures implemented by the authorities, we can define a specific transmission rate for each phase based on the level of containment. Wang et al. (2020) have proposed a step function approach to define such modifiers. However, it is also true that apart from the containment measures implemented by the government, rising awareness at micro community levels also contributes towards reducing the rate of transmission. To incorporate this idea, they have suggested defining the transmission modifier as a continuous function of time.",

The mean incubation period of COVID-19, defined as the time from exposure to the onset of illness, is reported to be around 5 days by many researchers; refer (Lauer et al., 2020; Yuan et al., 2020) among others. This means that the impact of any intervention on the transmission rate can be expected to be visible only after 5 days, on an average. Given the fact that India has preferred focused group testing over random testing, it becomes important to address the expected lag in reporting of cases. So, for improving the analysis, cut-off dates for defining phases have been extended by 5 days to accommodate for the lag in effect induced by the incubation period. Complete lockdown in India came into effect on 25 March 2020. However, because of sudden loss of jobs and earnings of daily wagers, and the uncertainty looming over the extension of lockdown period, there were huge movements of migrant workers across India, with most of them trying to reach their homes. Overwhelming number of reports emerged about inter-state travels of large groups of people, with many even forced to travel hundreds of kilometers on foot. According to an article published in Business Standards (Jha (2020)), on 31 March 2020 the central government reported in the Supreme Court that 500,000-600,000 migrants reached their villages on foot during the lockdown. However, as per news reports, most of the state governments, assisted by various NGOs, had come up with adequate relief shelters and food arrangements for the stranded migrant laborers by 30 March 2020. Also, affected states started compulsory quarantine facilities for people migrating from other states. These measures helped in containing any significant movement and ensuring implementation of complete lockdown.

Mean infectious period is calculated as weighted average of these durations using observed proportions of deaths and recoveries among the total removed cases till 30 April 2020 in India as weights. The estimated mean infectious period is: 0.113 x 17.8 + 0.887 x 24.7 \u2248 24 days. Thus, the estimate for hyper-parameter for \u03b3 is, \u03b3 0 = 1/24 = 0.042. However, since there is dearth of comprehensive studies confirming infectious period at this early stage of the epidemic, we have also performed analyses taking mean infectious period of 14 days (i.e. \u03b3 0 = 1/14 = 0.0714), as reported by the World Health Organisation (WHO, 2020) . So, at this juncture it is safe to assume that the reality may lie somewhere between the projections based on our two assumed cases for \u03b3 0 . The value for the hyper-parameter \u03b2 is estimated as the average of effective transmission rates over the total observed period (02 March 2020-30 March 2020).

Expected total incidence (as % of total population), and forecasted dates for two crucial turning points of the epidemic are also reported for each case. The first turning point signifies the time at which the rate of increase in the number of infecteds starts decreasing (deceleration). The second crucial turning point is the peak time of the infected curve beyond which the prevalence of infecteds starts decreasing. Table 3 and Table 4 present results for all four cases of step-function modifier based eSIR, for the initial estimate of infectious period as 24 days and 14 days respectively. Results from the exponential modifier function based eSIR, for both observed and calibrated data, are presented in Table 5 . Table 6 contains results for calibrated data using case 3 of step-function modifier in the eSIR model.",

Consistency of the estimate of R 0 (unadjusted) and \u03b2 (base value unadjusted for modifiers) under different hypothesized situations suggests that our estimates of modifiers are able to explain the changes in the transmission rate in their respective phases. Estimates of R 0 are comparatively very small in the containment phases, with that for the complete lockdown being the minimum. For example, citing results of case 1 from Table 3 , under the assumption of 24-day infectious period, R 0 is estimated to be 1.29 for the lockdown period, and around 2.33 for the quarantine/ partial lockdown phase, as opposed to 7.1 .

Similar jumps are seen in all cases.

To restrict the COVID-19 spread within the limits predicted by case 3 results, we have to ensure that the post complete lockdown period should not let R 0 to go beyond 1.32 (14day infectious period) or beyond 2.14 (24-day infectious period). If we are able to do that, depending on the actual recovery time of COVID-19 patients in India we can expect around 9.1% to 31.8% of the total population to get infected with SARS-CoV-2 by the time the epidemic ends. Assuming 75% under-reporting of infected and recovered/ deceased cases, the range of expected total incidence becomes 30.1% -67.2%, and for 50% under-reporting of cases, it is estimated as 16.4% -49.7%.
