Development of AF has been associated with stroke, myocardial infarction, heart failure, and death [2]. In the intensive care unit (ICU), patients often present with pre-existing AF; however, some ICU patients may develop new-onset AF (NOAF) in the context of critical illness [3]. Unlike AF seen in non-critically ill patients, NOAF is often thought to be a consequence of critical illness pathophysiology and treatment, including inflammation, electrolyte disturbances, or proarrhythmic medications, namely vasopressors and inotropes [4]. Incidence of NOAF in the general ICU varies markedly; however, most studies suggest that 10\u201315% of patients will develop this complication during their ICU stay [3\u20135].",

AF in and of itself may contribute to clinical decompensation through hemodynamic compromise [6]. Alternatively, NOAF may simply represent a marker of increased illness severity, and may identify patients at increased risk of death without acting causally to worsen prognosis. Some cohort studies have identified an independent association between NOAF and mortality [7\u20139], while others have not [5, 10]. Whether this relationship is seen among all critically ill patients, or limited to select subgroups, is unknown. Furthermore, the factors associated with death among patients with NOAF are unknown.",

Since the ICU is a major source of hospital expenditure, considerable effort has been dedicated to understand the contributors to cost, in order to drive policy and optimize resource utilization [13]. With regard to NOAF, little is known regarding the degree of impact on cost expenditures. We primarily sought to evaluate the association between NOAF and outcomes, resource utilization, and costs among critically ill adult patients. Given the prognostic importance of NOAF among patients with sepsis [14, 15], we secondarily aimed to evaluate the association between incidence of NOAF and associated outcomes and resource utilization among critically ill patients with suspected infection, sepsis, and septic shock.",

Student\u2019s t test (parametric values), Mann-Whitney test (non-parametric values), and \u03c72 (for categorical values) were performed to determine between-group differences. In keeping with existing guidelines, we did not perform pairwise comparisons of baseline characteristics [29]. To adjust for measured confounders in the association between new-onset AF and outcomes of interest, we followed recommendations for observational studies in the critically ill [30]. As per these recommendations, confounders were determined a priori, on the basis of their likelihood of influencing both the presence of NOAF and mortality and not acting as mediators or colliders in the association between AF and mortality, as based upon existing clinical knowledge evaluating the association between NOAF and mortality in critically ill patients [3, 4]. In accordance with these recommendations [30], we used multivariable logistic regression modeling to adjust for important continuous (age, MODS at ICU admission, Elixhauser comorbidity index) and categorical (sex, individual comorbidities, \u201cNo-CPR\u201d directive on admission, location prior to ICU admission, and most responsible diagnosis) variables. As recommended, variables on the causal pathway and potentially contributing to NOAF (e.g., vasoactive medications) were not included [30]. We evaluated for possible synergy between NOAF and sepsis through the use of an interaction term in the primary model, as performed previously [23]. If a statistically significant interaction term was found between NOAF and sepsis, we then represented this with a four-level categorization. We assessed variation in total hospital costs using a multivariable generalized linear model with gamma distribution and log link [31, 32]. We present adjusted odds ratios (aORs) and cost ratios (CRs) with 95% confidence intervals. A P value of \u2264 0.05 was considered statistically significant.",

NOAF is often thought to be a marker of illness severity [3]; however, the evidence examining the association between NOAF and hospital mortality remains uncertain [4]. In our large cohort of critically ill adults, we did not find such an association. However, evaluation of subgroups of patients with suspected infection, sepsis, and septic shock did find an independent association between NOAF and hospital mortality potentially suggesting that the consequences of NOAF in the patient with sepsis may differ from other populations.",

Our findings identifying an independent association between NOAF and mortality from sepsis are supportive of existing literature, and potentially suggest that survival in this population may be improved through the prevention and treatment of NOAF [34]. Importantly, unlike previous studies, we defined sepsis and septic shock using the most recent Sepsis-3 definitions, indicating that NOAF has potential implications in these populations, and demonstrate an interaction between the presence of NOAF and sepsis. In keeping with the Sepsis-3 focus of sepsis as infection with concomitant organ dysfunction, NOAF may indeed represent sepsis-defining cardiac dysfunction [35]. As such, NOAF during sepsis might mediate mortality and may not simply be a marker of illness severity, as is seen in other disease processes [36].",

Therefore, identification of factors associated with mortality among ICU patients who develop NOAF remains an important area of ongoing research [4]. Unsurprisingly, a history of heart failure was associated with hospital mortality among patients with NOAF in our cohort, suggesting that these patients may be more susceptible to the hemodynamic effects of NOAF. Our results also found that sustained AF following 24 h of treatment was also associated with higher hospital mortality. Therefore, sustained AF may represent a particular ominous marker of illness severity among critically ill adults, and clinicians should act cautiously in those patients with NOAF and persisting AF.",

Few differences were found with regard to resource utilization between patients with and without NOAF. However, patients with NOAF did have prolonged ICU and hospital LOS, which translated into higher costs. The presence of NOAF was also a significant predictor of costs among our cohort, and this was independent of other important factors more commonly associated with cost, including renal replacement therapy and mechanical ventilation [37]. This prolonged LOS was also manifested in increased laboratory, pharmacy, and nursing costs. Despite higher costs, patients with NOAF had higher unadjusted mortality, which translated into significant differences in cost per survivor (a proxy indicator of cost-effectiveness).",

While this study was not designed to test the efficacy of therapeutic agents for NOAF, the little evidence that exists on this topic seems to suggest no beneficial effect of any particular agent [3, 4]. This is in keeping with our results. We did not find evidence of difference in mortality associated with antiarrhythmic agents, but did note increased cost. This is likely attributable to the expense of these drugs [38], and the fact that they often cannot be administered outside of a monitored setting and therefore may prolong ICU LOS. However, it must be stressed that the efficacy of these agents can only be appropriately tested in a randomized trial, and while equipoise exists, decisions related to agents for treatment of NOAF must be made on a case-by-case basis.",

We also closely followed recommendations for control of confounding in observational studies [30]. However, our study has important limitations. Most importantly, our database lacks the granularity to investigate other potential factors that may influence outcome from NOAF, such as underlying cardiac function, pulmonary artery catheterization, rate of AF, timing of AF (particularly in relation to onset of critical illness), use of anticoagulation, and incidence of other arrhythmias. Some outcome data, such as incidence of stroke, were not available. We additionally excluded patients with existing AF on the basis of known or documented AF, but it is possible that patients may have had pre-existing AF and not known, due to absence of symptoms [39]. Overall, this lack of granularity represents an important limitation in our study. Second, patients were included on the basis of prospective identification by nursing staff. While similar methods have been used at other institutions [40], it is possible that cases of NOAF were missed using this methodology, particularly if AF was brief and transiently resolved. Third, we only had data related to outcomes prior to hospital death or discharge. Existing data suggest deleterious long-term outcomes in patients who develop NOAF during critical illness [15, 41]. Unfortunately, we were unable to evaluate this in our cohort. Finally, while our data are derived from two hospitals, they exist within the same city and therefore are susceptible to bias from local practices.",
