By Jan 7, 2020, Chinese scientists had isolated a completely unique coronavirus, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2; previously referred to as 2019-nCoV), from these patients with virus-infected pneumonia [2]. The outbreak was declared a Public Health Emergency of International Concern on 30 January 2020 by WHO [3]. WHO later designated this SARS-Cov-2 as coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in February 2020. By March 11, 2020 around 114 countries were affected globally by coronavirus disease then WHO declared COVID-19 as a deadly disease [3]. Although the outbreak is probably going to possess started from a zoonotic transmission event related to an oversized seafood market (Huanan seafood market, Wuhan) that also traded in live wild animals, it soon became clear that efficient person-to-person transmission was also occurring [4]. From phylogenetics analyses undertaken with available full genome sequences, bats and possibly pangolins appear to be the reservoir of COVID-19 virus, but the intermediate host(s) has not yet been identified [5,6].",

Further, on March 28, 2020 the FDA granted Emergency Use Authorization (EUA) to be used of Chloroquine Phosphate or Hydroxychloroquine Sulphate for Treatment of COVID-19 [9]. WHO has identified a listing of \"promising candidates\" for COVID-19 treatment which include remdesivir (an investigational agent); lopinavir-ritonavir (approved to be used in HIV) with or without interferon; investigational immunotherapies like monoclonal and polyclonal antibodies; and convalescent sera. In its January 27 statement, WHO failed to support the antimalarial chloroquine or hydroxychloroquine, ribavirin (used for hepatitis), or corticosteroids/steroids for COVID-19 clinical studies [10]. WHO later launched SOLIDARITY trial on March 20, 2020 involving 45 countries and counting which tests four therapy groups: Remdesivir, lopinavir-ritonavir with or without interferon, and hydroxychloroquine. the rationale for selecting these drugs was stated as there was some evidence of effectiveness against the SARS-CoV 2 virus, which caused Covid-19, either in vitro and/or animal studies [11].",

As shown in Fig. 3\n, the viral cycle is like other viruses consisting of attachment, integration, uncoating, use of cell machinery for replication, assembly and finally release of virions. Steps in coronavirus replication are potential targets for antiviral drugs and vaccines [2]. The spike glycoprotein S of coronavirus is a good candidate for vaccines because neutralizing antibodies are directed against glycoprotein S. Blockade of the specific virus receptor on the surface of the host cell by monoclonal antibodies or other ligands can prevent virus entry. Receptor-induced conformational changes in the S protein can be blocked by peptides that inhibit membrane fusion and virus entry. The polyprotein of the replicase protein is cleaved into functional units by virus-encoded proteinases. Protease inhibitors may block replication. The polymerase functions in a unique membrane-bound complex in the cytoplasm, and the assembly and functions of this complex are potential drug targets. Viral mRNAs made by discontinuous transcription are shown in the cytoplasm with the protein that each encodes indicated at the right.

Secondary bacterial infections can be treated by using various antibiotics. Research is currently focussed for innovation of new therapies to treat this potentially fatal cytokine storm. Besides, most microbes including COVID-19 are known to bind to Toll like Receptor (TLR) which in turn induces a highly proinflammatory cytokine, Interleukin 1 (IL-1). IL-1 is the mediator of fever and fibrosis. This can lead to further deterioration in susceptible COVID positive patients. Thus, drugs supressing IL-1 or IL-1 receptor can be taken into consideration for treatment of COVID -19 [3].",

Initially, the reason was hypothesised to be only environmental stating that as smoking is more prevalent in men and hence their respiratory system is compromised leading to greater risk of COVID infection. However, new research suggests that there are some innate differences between both sexes leading to the difference in the susceptibility. The presence of an extra X chromosome in females lead to lower viral load levels, and less inflammation than in men, while CD4 + T cells are higher with better immune response. Besides, women produce higher titre of antibodies which tends to remain in circulation for longer periods. The levels of activation of the immune cells are higher in women than in men, and it is correlated with the trigger of TLR7 and the production of interferon (IFN). TLR7 is higher in women than in men and it\u2019s biallelic expression leads to higher immune responses and increases the resistance to viral infections. TLR7 is expressed in innate immune cells which recognizes single strand RNA virus by promoting the production of antibodies against the virus and the generation of pro-inflammatory cytokines including IL-6 and IL-1 family members. Moreover, in women the production of inflammatory IL-6 after viral infection is lower than in males and is often correlated with a better longevity. In addition, on the X chromosome there are loci that code for the genes involved in the regulation of immune cells such as FOXP3 and transcription factor for T regulatory cells (Treg) involved in virus pathogenesis. The X chromosome influences the immune system by acting on many other proteins, including TLR8, CD40 L and CXCR3 which can be over-expressed in women, and influence the response to viral infections and vaccinations. However, greater production of pro-inflammatory cytokines enhances risk of cytokine storm. Thus, drugs acting against pro-inflammatory cytokines can be theoretically more effective in women compared to men and in future, there may be gender wise differential therapy for treatment of COVID 19 [4].",

IL-6 activates its downstream Janus kinase (JAK) signal by binding the transmembrane (cis-signalling) or soluble form (trans-signalling) of the IL-6 receptor (IL-6R) and interacting with membrane-bound gp130. Excessive IL-6 signalling leads to a myriad of biological effects that contribute to organ damage, such as maturing na\u00efve T cells into effector T cells, inducing vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) expression in epithelial cells, increasing vessel permeability and reduces myocardial contractility [21].\u2022Mechanism of Action: Tocilizumab is a recombinant humanized monoclonal anti-IL\u20106R antibody. It binds both soluble and membrane\u2010bound IL\u20106R to inhibit IL\u20106\u2010mediated cis-signalling and trans-signalling.\u2022Current Evidence: Case study/series describing use of tocilizumab in patients with COVID-19 have been reported from various areas of the world. In preliminary data from a non-peer reviewed, single-arm Chinese trial involving 21 patients with severe or critical COVID-19 infection, showed rapid fever reduction and a reduced need for supplemental oxygen within few days after receiving tocilizumab (initially given as a single 400-mg dose by IV infusion; this dose was repeated within 12 hours in 3 patients because of continued fever). In China: Randomized, multicentre, controlled clinical trial evaluating efficacy & safety in 188 patients with COVID-19 is under way. Results are not yet available. In US/Global scenario, randomized, placebo-controlled trial is in phase 3 (NCT04320615) is in collaboration with the US Health and Human Services Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority (BARDA); the study will evaluate safety and efficacy of tocilizumab in combination with standard of care compared with placebo. In this study, there is expectation of enrolment of about 330 patients globally, including in the U.S., beginning in April 2020 [22].\n",
