The infection caused by this virus was named coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) by the WHO on February 11, 2020. Highly contagiousness, COVID-19 pneumonia outbreaks have occurred in many countries around the world [1]. The main route of transmission of this disease is respiratory infection. It spreads rapidly and causes lesions characteristic of interstitial pneumonia. Accurate and timely identification concerning CT imaging characteristics of COVID-19 pneumonia facilitates early diagnosis, timely isolation, and treatment of the disease. We here retrospectively analyzed the initial chest CT manifestations of 150 viral nucleic acid-confirmed COVID-19 pneumonia cases to provide an imaging basis for the disease diagnosis, intervention, and scientific research.",

            "text": "COVID-19 pneumonia is an infection caused by a betacoronavirus, and its main routes of transmission involve respiratory tract transmission and close contact transmission, though under special circumstances it can also move through aerosols [2] . Current epidemiological investigations [3] . COVID-19 pneumonia is common in adults and rare in children. In this study, there was only 1 case in an adolescent, aged 17. The main clinical manifestations of COVID-19 pneumonia are acute respiratory symptoms. Fever, dry cough, and fatigue are common symptoms of COVID-19 pneumonia. In severe cases, dyspnea or hypoxemia develops, which may rapidly progress to acute respiratory distress syndrome in some of the patients. COVID-19 pneumonia patients may also show abdominal pain, diarrhea, and conjunctivitis, regardless of whether they had respiratory symptoms [3] . In this study, the initial clinical manifestations of the 150 COVID-19 pneumonia patients included different symptoms, mainly fever and cough. In addition, some patients had non-respiratory symptoms, such as fatigue, muscle soreness, diarrhea, abdominal pain, and headaches, and another two patients were asymptomatic. The lack of specific clinical manifestations in a small number of COVID-19 pneumonia cases may cause erroneous and missed diagnoses. Chest CT is the preferred imaging test for COVID-19 pneumonia. A study of 1,099 COVID-19 pneumonia patients showed that the chest imaging results were not always consistent with the clinical symptoms [3] . Due to the differences in the clinical symptoms and timing of hospital admission among different patients, the progression of imaging manifestations in the chest CT is not consistent across patients. Thus, the involved areas and morphologies of the pulmonary lesions in the initial chest CT may differ. The imaging characteristics of the initial chest CT of 150 COVID-19 pneumonia patients mainly included single or multiple lesions, and sometimes diffused lesions. These involved various lung segments and lobes. COVID-19 pneumonia mainly causes deep airway and alveolar injuries [4] . In this study, all lung segments were involved, with the lower lobe of both lungs being relatively common and the posterior basal segments of the lower lungs being more common. The lesions were mainly located in the peripheral subpleural regions, which were consistent with the deep airway and alveolar injuries related to COVID-19 pneumonia [4] , suggesting pathological changes in deep lung tissues. Manifestations and morphologies of initial chest CT of the COVID-19 pneumonia patients were diverse [5] , with the lesion morphologies including groundglass nodules, patchy GGOs with or without consolidation, and cord-like lesions. Lesions of two or more different morphologies were sometimes observed in the same patient, with the highest proportion of patchy GGOs with or without consolidation (124 cases, 82.67%). The pathological characteristics of COVID-19 pneumonia are very similar to SARS and Middle East respiratory syndrome, showing exudative changes, such as pulmonary edema and protein exudation and thickening of the interlobular septa of the lungs at the early stage [4, 6] . These manifested as GGOs in the chest CT, and crazy-paving sign, air bronchogram sign, and thickened blood vessels were found in the CT images of some cases. Pulmonary consolidation lesions in the CT images may be caused by increased consolidation of inflammatory exudation in the alveoli. This study also showed differences in the location, number, and size of the pulmonary lesions in COVID-19 pneumonia patients in different age groups. Single focal lesion, single lung, and ground-glass nodules were more common in COVID-19 pneumonia patients under 35 years old; while diffused lesions in both lungs were more common in COVID-19 pneumonia patients over 60 years old. Differences in the lesion morphologies and in the severity of the initial symptoms of the COVID-19 pneumonia patients may be related to the presence of underlying diseases and the differences in defense and tolerance of the body in elderly patients, leading to elderly patients to have lesions in large areas of the lung in their initial examinations, lesion progression involving the pulmonary lobules, and diffused lung injury [7] . The patients were earlier to the hospital for the first CT scan at the age of 17-35 years than the patients > 35 years old in 150 COVID-19 pneumonia patients. Thus, differences in the lesion morphologies and in the severity of the initial symptoms of the COVID-19 pneumonia patients may also be related to the differences in the period between symptom onset and initial examination at the hospital [8] . Chest cavity lesions of COVID-19 pneumonia are non-serous inflammatory changes [4] , and pleural effusion is relatively rare. Only six patients showed pleural effusion, and only 2 patients (1.33%) had mediastinal lymphadenopathy, which may be abnormal enlargement of lymph nodes caused by the spreading of lung inflammation [9, 10] .",

Early positive manifestations of COVID-19 pneumonia in chest CT mainly included GGOs and patchy shadows, which were often accompanied by thickening of vascular bundles, local pleura, and interlobular septa, while pleural effusion and lymphadenopathy were rare. Single focal lesion, single lung, and ground-glass nodules were more common in COVID-19 pneumonia patients under 35 years old than in older patients, while diffused lesions in both lungs were more common in COVID-19 pneumonia patients over 60 years old than in younger patients. Pulmonary lesions were found to most often involve the posterior basal segments of the lower lungs and to be mainly distributed under the pleura and/or lateral fields of the lungs. Diagnosis of COVID-19 pneumonia should be made by pooling the patients' clinical, laboratory, and epidemiological data, and suspected cases should undergo chest CT promptly. For asymptomatic and elderly patients that meet the epidemiological criteria, CT examinations should",
