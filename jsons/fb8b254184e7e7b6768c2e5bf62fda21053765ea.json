EMHIP will start with a process of knowledge and evidence synthesis, bringing together experiences of service users and individuals from BME communities, examples of good practice across the country, evidence in relation to equitable and effective mental health care, and research findings and recommendations from inquiries and reports. From this initiative, a practical, whole-system intervention programme will be developed and adapted for the purpose through a process of coproduction, involving service providers, service users, and BME communities locally. In phase 2 of the project, this intervention programme will be implemented in one borough (Wandsworth), and further refined by engagement and consultation with local communities and service users. Outcomes will be evaluated systematically through a cycle of comprehensive ethnicity audits based on routine service use data (adapted and augmented where necessary) and additional qualitative data.",

There are several reasons to believe that this approach will change the current, discriminatory dynamics of mental health care. EMHIP is a service-level intervention that is conceptualised, primarily, as a way of improving the overall quality of clinical care and patient safety for everyone, not just BME groups. The project combines an inside and outside approach through equal participation and commitment from statutory care providers, community agencies, and the wider community. The success of such a whole system project depends on strong leadership and collaboration between various key stakeholders. This process is underway in southwest London, where local BME communities and service users are \"stepping up boldly\" along with NHS agencies to ensure that local mental health services are respectful, effective, safe, and appropriate to their needs. 8 ",

Researchers around the globe have paused their work for several reasons. First, to avoid unnecessary burden on people who might be in distress during the pandemic. Second, because the context of the current research environment means that results will require cautious interpretation. Third, to ensure that continued recruitment of people to studies on self-harm and suicide when a global crisis is occurring is reasonable and safe; transferring face-to-face research online must be very carefully considered. Finally, because the supports and services that participants would be signposted to throughout a study might not able to provide support in the usual ways and formats. Mental health research, including self-harm and suicide, is a vital part of the response to the pandemic, but we are concerned about the ethical robustness of some studies already recruiting. We have seen studies that do not provide sufficient information to enable fully informed consent, do not measure mood before or after participation, do not provide any signposting other than to potentially anxiety-provoking messages about COVID-19, and do not attempt any kind of mood mitigation or debrief to help to stabilise anyone that does become distressed after participation. We would recommend that researchers be mindful that general research into the impacts of COVID-19, even if this does not evaluate mental health, self-harm, or suicide, should be viewed as a highly sensitive topic, with similar attention to safeguards needed to protect the wellbeing of participants.",

Researchers should provide signposting and check that the services signposted to are operational and able to provide support (and in what format). Finally, providing mood mitigation to all participants is an important method to boost mood, particularly when participants have been asked to consider anxiety-provoking questions about COVID-19 and answer sensitive questions about selfharm or suicide. A number of methods including exam howlers, 5 cute animal pictures, 4 interactive websites, 6 and so-called doodle pages 7 have been shown to work for young people. The ethics of voucher lotteries and other incentives for participants in studies on suicide and self-harm have been questioned by lived experience authors. 8 Valuing the time of participants who contribute to these studies and respecting the challenges of taking part in research on difficult topics is important at a time of financial difficulty for many, particularly when there is little access to supports.",

Indeed, the MQ COVID-19 and mental health initiative 1 includes people with lived experience in the 18 members of their leadership team. This would be strengthened if people with lived experience were among the core leadership team (currently comprised of six senior academics). More than ever, it is crucial that patient and public involvement is embedded into research and that lived experience advisors are supported effectively-both emotionally and financially. Sarah Knowles (University of York) has recently curated materials for researchers to facilitate effective co-creation and patient and public involvement in the digital world. 9 For all research to be considered ethical, the benefits must be high and the risk minimised. The research community must be very clear about who will benefit from the research, how it can be implemented to inform policy and practice, and in what time frame. Clearly, ethics committees across the globe have a vital role to play in weighing these issues and in the context of a growing plethora of online studies. Given social distancing and lockdowns, an effective digital response is crucial. Clinical mental health services globally are having to mobilise staff digitally and remotely to meet current need. The research community also needs to respond effectively to the COVID-19 pandemic, but we must ensure that what we are doing is ethical.",
