FCoV is transmitted by the fecal-oral route and usually causes a mild to inapparent enteritis [2]. FIP is considered to be induced by a virulent mutant (FIP virus; FIPV) of this enteric FCoV (feline enteric coronavirus; FECV) [2, 3]. The incidence of FIP is generally as low as 1\u20133 % in FCoV-infected cats, though it varies depending on age, breed, environment, and superinfection with other viruses [2, 4\u20136].",

Recently, it has been stated that demonstration of FCoV RNA by RT-PCR is one of the most reliable diagnostic indicators of FIP in suspected cases [7, 17]. However, FIPV and FECV are not necessarily distinguished with certainty, and the reliability of RT- PCR for FIP diagnosis depends largely on the test specimens as well as rearing environment of the affected cat.",

As shown in Table 1, effusion is the most suitable, and FCoV RNA detection provides highly sensitive and specific diagnosis [1, 17\u201319]. When using CSF, RNA detection can also give a highly specific diagnosis. However, the absence of FIP cannot be generally concluded based on negative results, because small amounts of the virus may exist in CSF from FIP cases [1, 20, 21]. Even in non-FIP and healthy carriers, RNA may be detected in blood for several months after FECV infection [22, 23]. Of note, associated RNA is frequently detected in blood from FCoV-endemic multi-cat households. Thus, the reliability of RT- PCR-positive results obtained from a blood specimen is dependent on the rearing environment [23\u201325]. In contrast, FIP may be excluded when a blood specimen is RT-PCR negative, because the RNA detection sensitivity is relatively high with blood from FIP cases [17, 23, 26, 27]. RNA detection sensitivity varies among tissues, i.e., higher in the liver and spleen, and lower in the kidneys and heart [28\u201330]. Tissue samples generally contain blood, which compromises the reproducibility of FIP diagnosis with RT-PCR-positive tissues [1, 29].\n",

Since detection of this gene indicates viral replication, FIPV, which has increased microphage infectivity, is able to be detected with high specificity. This RT-PCR technique is more useful for specimens other than effusion samples and CSF. However, in our experience, mRNA detection tends to be less sensitive than 3\u2032-UTR RT-PCR.",

This is more likely to occur with primers targeting the S gene.Care should be exercised to prevent coagulation of whole blood samples. EDTA is suitable as an anticoagulant, while heparin is not recommended, because it may cause coagulation during transportation.Care should be exercised to prevent blood contamination during CSF sampling, as viral RNA may be contained in blood even in non-FIP cases.Care should be exercised during sampling and transportation, because RNA is fragile, and disposable DNase- and RNase-free sampling containers should be used. Collected samples should be immediately transported to a laboratory in a refrigerated state.DNase- and RNase-free phosphate buffer saline (PBS) should be used to increase sample volume before testing as needed.Effusion, serum, and plasma specimens should be centrifuged with a refrigerated centrifuge prior to purification with the QIAamp Viral RNA Mini Kit, and the resulting supernatants should then be purified.Reaction mixtures should be prepared and dispensed on ice.\nPCR is highly sensitive and may yield false-positive results when contaminated by even a small amount of nucleic acid. Thus, reaction mixtures should be prepared and dispensed in clean environments, such as a clean bench, and only test results obtained by skilled experimenters are considered to be reliable.Only DNase- and RNase-free instruments, such as test tubes and pipette chips, should be used.Since EtBr is deactivated by light, its solution should be stored in a light-shielded condition.Care should be exercised in handling EtBr for gel staining, because EtBr is toxic to humans. It should be also detoxified in appropriate manners, such as activated carbon adsorption, reductive decomposition, and oxidative decomposition, before disposal. A detoxifying reagent is commercially available (EtBr destroyer, Wako).Care should be exercised in regard to UV irradiation during gel observation, as UV may damage eyes and skin.\n",
