Past the threshold he scooped his ziplock lunch of cheese biscuits and root beer o\u221a a shelf and pulled a stool up to the worktable. ''Rain holds o\u221a, I should be able to edge this afternoon. But the lawn could use rain.'' ''Rain?'' Cindy do\u221aed goatskin gloves in the doorway and dropped them with her secateur and neckerchief on the orange metal garden chair before stepping inside. ' Rafe showed palms, fanning fingers. ''I didn't even take sociology. So, are you and Ruthie still an item? How'd you derail her, by the way, strategic knee to the family jewels?'' ''More civilized. We can be gentlemanly as the next man. Ruthie was cool. We talked a little more and then I drove back to Carrboro. My softball team plays in Charlotte Saturday and she'd talked about driving over, but now I think maybe better not, after this little contretemps. Give ourselves a breather.'' As the trio mused, eyes lowered and unfocused, the green light darkened. Presently fingers of rain tapped across the metal roof. At length Cindy said, ''So, Ollie, is Merrymount set to ship?'' She reminded Rafe of the debut. ''We'll mail bare-root.'' ''You mean we, or you, will have to wash down the youngsters you've shepherded through their first winter, just when their little rootlets are stretching and branching, just as they're learning the Y meaning of home? May as well aquaculture from day one, seems to me. Then we'd only need pat dry their toesies.'' ''He's flabbergasting me, Cindy. If we sign this young Turk on, we'll both find ourselves sidelined before the year's out.'' Rafe grinned. ''That's no answer, man.''",

The squirrel guard, a transparent hemisphere above the feeder, provided a good umbrella. For the hundredth time Thea thought about the Merrymount price. She didn't want it out of reach of ordinary people, retired people who needed beauty, more and more, it seemed. At the same time the price should be high enough to cultivate the rose, for it to establish itself in gardens across the piedmont, the South, even across the land to the Northwest, where it would surely thrive, and California, and be known and loved long after Thea breathed her last, one among the multitude of these most loved flowers, and not the least lovely, or the least loved.",

Ruby was substantial, always outweighed me. And solemn. Getting a smile took work, and sometimes stealth, but her dimples were worth it.'' ''Beautiful?'' Rafe ventured. ''To me at least, you mean? Well, not exactly that way.'' Those dimples, her yellow eyes, how light Ruby seemed, negotiating past our Hoover in the hall closet. Or she'd dozed in front of the television before we had color, and blue dust seemed drifted over her arms and face and like a bloom on her silver braids. Ollie sighed. ''I don't know what she would think to hear me talking about her this way to you children, but no, what I remember feeling those times was more a tenderness, the chill a baby can give you, and also privilege, that could nearly . . . . '' Ollie considered. ''I don't mean often. Truth to tell, maybe not ever. But from time to time the possibility would slip up on me, that the privilege of just being next to her, just her breathing might turn my knees to jelly.'' Rafe mused, ''When you're a arthur or arthuress, you write about beautiful flowers and so forth, right? Velvet and candelabras, like in easy listening. Babes in stilettos.'' Cindy said, ''Unless you make whatever you write about flowery itself.'' She turned to Ollie. ''Isn't that the same as soul?'' ''Get outta here.'' ''Whatever. Anyhow Rafey, I don't think you need bother with the laptop song and dance. Invest in an actual violin. On eBay, a high school orchestra gone belly up. Maybe a collapsible music stand. Display them negligently in your pad, you score with nine bimbos out of ten.'' Rafe smiled. ''What if one asks for a performance?'' ''Beg o\u221a, son,'' advised Ollie. ''O\u221aer a rain check. You're too serious a musician to play unless your heart's in it.'' Cindy said, ''Alternatively, how about lessons? Find a local bluegrass fiddler down on her luck. For a song you'll be cranking out moonlight and roses to beat the band.'' ''Or,'' said Ollie, ''while you're on eBay check for performance enhancers. Pop one with your last sports-bar beer. By the time she crosses your threshold you're ready to rock.'' ''Wonders of science,'' said Rafe. ''You a musician, man?'' ''Ruby and I got down Saturday nights with other youngsters in the back room of the billiards hall, improvising, learning as we went.'' Cindy said, ''I didn't know that, Ollie. What instrument?'' ''Washtub bass. Ruby washboard, like we were meant for each other.'' Rafe said, ''You must have made beautiful music together.'' Ollie chuckled. ''I won't deny it. No, but here's a pearl of wisdom, for the both of you. Get enough years under your belts and any music is beautiful by definition.'' ''We'll see,'' Cindy said sociably, refraining from voicing reservations about rap and medieval, and other aesthetic considerations she didn't expect would change. Men for instance, God love 'em, for this girl they'll never be anything but comic. Feet for starters. But I'm laid back. Take this Merrymount. Not to put too fine a point on it, the scheme is fundamentally cranky. Next thing you Y know we'll be introducing jellyfish genes for luminescence. Now would be the time to nip this particular innovation in the bud, before stock ships. With gasoline or even the right herbicide it could look accidental. Should it break Mrs. Hunt's old heart, or Ollie's, well, you make an omelet, you break eggs. Anyway, hearts mend. She continued, ''I can barely carry a tune myself. Still, I whistle in the dark when it helps. How about you, Rafe?'' She turned to Ollie. ' ''I've passed probation then?'' Cindy gave a questioning smile to Ollie, who considered. ''Whatever,'' said Rafe. ''Anyway I'm not sure I'd normalize even if I could. The quirk has uses. I recognize voices the way a dog does smell. Even on the phone or in a recording, couple of words and I know who it is, if I've ever heard it before, and if not, I know that. When I can't place a face I just get it to say something.'' ''Human, you mean?'' ''Humanoid even, robots. Nonhuman animals less, but more than you might guess. Plus also I process extra-low volume. Blindfolded, I still hear space.'' Cindy said, ''You never know when that talent will come in handy. Pin the tail on the donkey.'' Ollie said, ''Handy if he lost his sight for sure.'' He touched the wooden bench.",

Thea raised binoculars that had served her half a century and more. The siskin cocked a bright eye her way, as if to say, ''Bzzzt! Bzzzt, Thea Pettigrew Hunt, bzzzzzt!'' Momentarily it would take wing, and swoop through the clearing rain over the rose beds and away. In the interim, shouldn't one hazard a wish? As best she still could, Thea opened her mind to let one appear. What appeared, however, was a shred of memory, of the tipsy gaiety of the celebrants in ''The Maypole of Merry Mount,'' the twice-told tale she and Marvin had pored over in the Riverside series ''Edited for Study'' on their first date, the silken banner staining the pale shaft with the seven rainbow hues. As the pair sought the allegorical lesson, paging forward and back on the oak table in the library reading room, a Friday evening in April, possibly her hand had brushed his, or vice versa. There had been a dancing bear (what an idea!) that the Puritans had shot in the head. With all the earnestness of youth Thea had debated the meaning, why the poor beast had taken the bullet in its head rather than in its heart, and what might have been the color of the nameless roses wreathed in the pine boughs above.",

Birds of a feather, both loners. Anyway I've known a couple or three ladies that were arthur groupies, if you will. That gave me the idea of capitalizing on Hillsborough's reputation.''
