            "text": "Interferons (IFNs) are a group of cytokines that serve as the first line of defense against viruses. In addition to their protective role against viral infection, the interferon (IFN) family - consisting of types I, II, and III IFNs, have numerous additional functions that influence cellular growth and immune surveillance against tumor cells [1], [2], [3]. All three IFN members activate the JAK/STAT pathway and induce interferon-stimulated gene (ISG) expression by binding to their respective receptors: IFN\u03b1R1 and IFN\u03b1R2 for type I interferon (IFN\u03b1/\u03b2), IFN\u03b3R1 and IFN\u03b3R2 for type II interferon (IFN\u03b3), and IFN\u03bbR1 and IL10R\u03b2 for type III interferon (IFN\u03bb1~4) [1], [4]. In contrast to types I and II, type III IFN was only recently identified and plays not only antiviral functions but also novel immunomodulatory functions in oncology and autoimmune diseases [5], [6]. IFN\u03bb1~3 were identified through computational based prediction from genome sequencing [7], [8] and IFN\u03bb4 was discovered in genome-wide association studies (GWAS) on hepatitis C virus (HCV)-infected patients [9]. The \u0394G allele of a dinucleotide genetic variant (rs368234815) that is upstream of the IFNL3 locus on chromosome 19 creates the functional IFN\u03bb4, while the TT allele leads to a frameshift, thereby rendering it a pseudogene [9]. Interestingly, HCV patients with the \u0394G allele and hence expressing IFN\u03bb4, responded poorly to PEGylated-IFN\u03b1-ribavirin treatment as compared to patients with the TT allele [10]. However, IFN\u03bb4 still induces the major hepatic ISG expression during chronic HCV infection and is able to drive the anti-viral response against other viruses such as the MERS-CoV in vitro\n[11]. Similar to IFN\u03b1 (Roferon-A for hairy cell leukemia) and IFN\u03b2 (Avonex for multiple sclerosis), successful phase 2 clinical trials of PEGylated IFN\u03bb1 against hepatitis D virus (HDV) infection highlight the pharmaceutical potential of the IFN\u03bb family.",

            "text": "Previously, the transient expression of wild-type IFN\u03bb4 in mammalian cells failed to produce significant amounts of recombinant IFN\u03bb4. It was suggested that a weak signal peptide in IFN\u03bb4 may be responsible for its impaired secretion and that proper glycosylation of IFN\u03bb4 may be required for its secretion [9]. Although recombinant IFN\u03bb4 can be purified from a bacterial expression system through refolding the inclusion body [11], a lack of glycosylation may affect the efficacy of IFN\u03bb4. Recently, glyco-engineering, which introduces new glycosylation sites or alters the glycan composition of CHO cells, has been widely used to produce improved therapeutic proteins, because glycan moieties can affect various protein properties, such as solubility, stability, in vivo activity, and serum half-life. For example, improved half-life and productivity are obtained from glyco-engineered hIFN\u03b2-1a and hIFN\u03b1 [12], [13]. Moreover, increased secretion of lipase, cutinase, llama VHH antibody, and macrophage inhibitory cytokine 1 results from the addition of a single N-glycosylation site [14], [15]. Therefore, we propose that glyco-engineering IFN\u03bb4 is a viable option for improving its expression level and possibly altering other properties.",

Therefore, only the structures of IFN\u03bb3 alone [21] or IFN\u03bb1 in complex with IFN\u03bbR1 [22] have been determined. Recently, Mendoza, et al., introduced affinity-enhancing mutations on IFN\u03bb3 which stabilized its interaction with IL10R\u03b2, and elucidated the crystal structure of the type III interferon signaling complex, IL10R\u03b2-IFN\u03bb3-IFN\u03bbR1 (PDB code: 5T5W) (Fig. 1\nA) [23]. Although IFN\u03bb4 shares only ~30% sequence identity with IFN\u03bb1~3, the sequence alignment of IFN\u03bb1~4 suggests that IFN\u03bb4 interacts with IFN\u03bbR1 and IL10R\u03b2 in a similar manner as the IL10R\u03b2-IFN\u03bb3-IFN\u03bbR1 ternary complex [23] for two reasons. First, the amino acids of the IFN\u03bb family that are critical for IFN\u03bbR1 binding are well-conserved in IFN\u03bb4 (P37, L40, K44, R47, D48, I108, F159, and R163) (Fig. 1B). Second, hydroxyl groups of several aromatic residues of IL10R\u03b2 (Y59, Y82, Y140, and W143) form a hydrogen bonding network with IFN\u03bb3 (S44, L45, Q48R, and E106D); these are also well conserved in IFN\u03bb4 (S34, L35, R48, and Q100). Therefore, we modeled the IFN\u03bb4 structure using the crystal structure of IFN\u03bb3 and IFN\u03bb1 (Fig. 1A) and structurally aligned it to the IL10R\u03b2-IFN\u03bb3-IFN\u03bbR1 structure to build the IL10R\u03b2-IFN\u03bb4-IFN\u03bbR1 model (Fig. 1B). Interestingly, the model structure of IL10R\u03b2-IFN\u03bb4-IFN\u03bbR1 indicates that critical hydrophobic pockets for harboring the hydrophobic residues of IL10R\u03b2 (Y82 and W143) are well maintained on the surface of IFN\u03bb4 (Fig. 1C).",

Second, they had to be exposed to the solvent to allow access to oligosaccharyltransferase (OST), which catalyzes the initial transfer of glycan from the lipid-linked oligosaccharide onto the substrate asparagine [24], [25]. Third, the consensus sequence (NXS/T, X = any amino acid except proline) had to be achieved by single point mutation to minimize the structural distortion caused by the mutation. Only six candidate sites were available that met all three criteria: L28N, A54N, P73N, H97N, K154N, and A173N (Fig. 1A and B). We named them M1 ~ M6, respectively.",

Interestingly, only M3 showed the prominent up-shift in SDS-PAGE that indicates successful hyperglycosylation. We also checked the expression level of the double mutants (L28N and P73N, M7), showing further enhanced protein expression compared to M1 and M3 variants (Fig. 2A). The constructs used in the western blot for hit discovery carried a C-terminus 6x Histidine tag, which may interfere with proper secretion of the protein, given the extensive distribution of positively-charged amino acids in IFN\u03bb4. Therefore, we substituted the 6x histidine tag with a protein A tag and purified three IFN\u03bb4 variants (M1, M3, and M7) using affinity chromatography followed by thrombin digestion, in order to remove the protein A tag and subsequent size exclusion chromatography. Final IFN\u03bb4 variants (M1, M3, and M7) were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and Coomassie blue staining under reducing and non-reducing condition. The resulting bands indicate that three IFN\u03bb4 variants (M1, M3, and M7) are monomer (Fig. 2B). The elution profile of standard proteins indicates that each monodispersed peak corresponds to the IFN\u03bb4 variants (~44 kDa) (Fig. 2C). Most likely, this oversized elution is due to the presence of N-glycosylation on IFN\u03bb4 variants, which was confirmed by the results shown in the following section.",

Our results indicate that treatment with the M1, M3, and M7 IFN\u03bb4 variants also induced phosphorylation of STAT1, just as in other type III interferons, IFN\u03bb1~3, and that the suppression of IFN\u03bbR1 expression by small interference RNA specific to the IFN\u03bbR1 gene (siIFN\u03bbR1) abolished the phosphorylation of STAT1, even after treatment with the IFN\u03bb4 variants (Fig. 5\nA). IFN\u03bb4 stimulation reportedly leads to the assembly of the ISGF3 transcription factor complex, which consists of phospho-STAT1, phospho-STAT2, and IRF9 and induces the expression of ISG15 [27], which is critical for anti-viral activity [28]. We showed that the M1, M3, and M7 IFN\u03bb4 variants also induced the expression of ISG15 and inhibited HCV replication in HCV-infected Huh-7.5 cells (Fig. 5B and 5C). Interestingly, the M1, M3, and M7 IFN\u03bb4 variants showed a significantly more potent ISG induction and anti-viral activity than eIFN\u03bb4.",

In order to assess whether the M1, M3, and M7 variants display a similar functionality during prolonged treatment, we evaluated the protein levels of the U-ISGF3 components. The protein levels of STAT1, STAT2, and IRF9 were equally upregulated by all IFN\u03bb4s (Fig. 5D).

To assess the effect of glycosylation on this functionality, we examined the expression level of SOCS1 and USP18 upon the treatment of M1, M3 and M7 variants on Huh7 cell line. USP18 was significantly increased upon treatment of IFN\u03bb1, 2 and 3. While eIFN\u03bb4 resulted in slight increase of USP18, our IFN\u03bb4 variants (M1, M3 and M7) showed a comparable activity to IFN\u03bb1, 2 and 3 (Fig. 5F). The protein expression of SOCS1 was not significantly increased by the treatment of any form of IFN\u03bbs (Fig. 5F). However, the mRNA expression of SOCS1 was slightly upregulated by IFN\u03bbs, although there was no significant difference among IFN\u03bbs (Fig. 5G). These results suggest that our structure-based approach on selecting de novo glycosylation maintained the biological activity of IFN\u03bb4 and our IFN\u03bb4 variants expressed from HEK293 have superior activity compared to eIFN\u03bb4.",

            "text": "Until recently, research on IFN\u03bb4 and its use as a clinical therapeutic was hindered by the inability to obtain appreciable amounts of this protein. Purification of bacterial-derived recombinant IFN\u03bb4 through refolding [11] still poses a number of problems, including the complexity of purification steps, lack of glycosylation, and endotoxin contamination. Our study is an example of how glycoengineering aided by structural information can be used to overcome such limitations; it is the first to report the successful production of IFN\u03bb4 protein from a mammalian cell line with enhanced properties compared to eIFN\u03bb4 and requiring a simpler purification protocol. There are several possibilities as to why our IFN\u03bb4 variants displayed enhanced expression and potency. First, the presence of acidic N-glycans may stabilize the protein through a charge-balance, since IFN\u03bb4 is unusually abundant with positively charged amino acids (~23%). Second, considering how the immune response is more actively triggered by our variants without critically affecting the receptor binding activity, compared to eIFN\u03bb4, extra N-glycans may have extended the half-life, as in other reports [12], [30], thereby increasing the fraction of functional protein during treatment. Finally, since N-glycosylation in eukaryotes is co-translational [31], the protein folding may have also been affected. Nevertheless, the mechanism behind the enhanced expression induced by unmodified L28N remains unanswered. We speculate that L28 may serve as the hydrophobic aggregation nuclei interacting with nearby hydrophobic residues, such as L29 or Y32 [32], [33]; perhaps L28N alleviates this effect.",

We used endogenous serine, threonine, or asparagine to introduce the glycosylation modification, which minimized the mutation-induced structural distortion. Other IFN\u03bb4 candidates containing N-glycosylation sites at random locations were also tested (data not shown) but no additional modification or expression changes were observed, indicating the efficiency of our structure-oriented approach. However, glyco-peptides containing L28N were not detected by mass spectrometry, suggesting that the site may have remained unmodified. According to the recent cryo-EM structure of oligosaccharyltransferase (OST) [34], [35], [36], which catalyzes the initial transfer of glycan from the lipid-linked oligosaccharide onto the substrate asparagine, substrate binding to the catalytic subunit, STT3, requires structural flexibility near the glycosylation sequence of the substrate. Our IFN\u03bb4 model suggests that P73 is located on the flexible loop, while other eliminated candidate sites (A173 and K154) are part of the \u03b1-helix. This may partly explain the successful glycosylation of P73N. On the contrary, L28N may not be physically accessible by OST. Elucidating the structure of IFN\u03bb4 may provide insights to this hypothesis.",

IFN\u03b1 and its PEGylated variants are used against cancers such as hairy cell leukemia (Roferon A), melanoma (Multiferon), and AIDS-related Kaposi's sarcoma (Intron A) [37], [38], [39]. IFN\u03b2 is a well-known treatment for multiple sclerosis, with a number of different versions available (Rebif \u2013 IFN\u03b2 1a, liquid form, Avonex \u2013 IFN\u03b2 1a, lyophilized, Cinnovex \u2013 IFN\u03b2 1a, biogeneric, Betaseron \u2013 IFN\u03b2 1b, Plegridy \u2013 PEGylated IFN\u03b2 1a) [40], [41], [42], [43]. Similar to this, IFN\u03bbs also have a therapeutic potential, because it has been shown that IFN\u03bbs can protect hosts from various viruses, including influenza virus, West Nile virus, norovirus and rotavirus [38], [39], [40], [41]. It will be very interesting to test if glycosylated IFN\u03bbs exert anti-viral activity in hosts infected by such viruses. In this regard, a recent study demonstrated that IFN\u03bbs can suppress influenza virus without the inflammatory side effects of IFN\u03b1 [44]. However, it was previously shown that the expression of functional IFN\u03bb4 is associated with unresponsiveness to IFN\u03b1 treatment among HCV-infected patients [9], and a subsequent study showed that long-term exposure to IFN\u03bb4 leads to cellular unresponsiveness to IFN\u03b1 treatment by upregulation of USP18 or SOCS1 [27], [29], indicating that IFN\u03bb4 treatment may be detrimental to virus-infected patients. On the other hand, our result shown in Fig. 5C indicates that IFN\u03bb4 treatment can directly suppress HCV replication. Whether IFN\u03bb4 treatment will be beneficial or detrimental to virus-infected patients might be determined by duration of the treatment and use of IFN\u03b1 following IFN\u03bb4 treatment. Although much further research and insight into the mode of action of IFN\u03bb4 is required to understand if its effects are beneficial or detrimental to human health, our engineered IFN\u03bb4 variants can be utilized as an alternative platform of IFN\u03bb4 wild-type.",

Mutation sites for potential N-glycosylation are displayed as the orange stick model (L28, A54, P73, H97, K154, A173) and seen in two different views (bottom). The endogenous N-glycosylation site \u2013 N61 \u2013 is shown as the blue stick. (B) Sequence alignment of IFN\u03bb proteins. Amino acids important in binding with IFN\u03bbR1 and IL10R\u03b2 are highlighted in green and cyan, respectively. Mutation sites for potential N-glycosylation are labeled from M1 to M6 and are boxed in orange. The endogenous N-glycosylation site for IFN\u03bb4 (N61, M0) is boxed in blue. Sequence conservation from the highest to lowest order is colored in red, blue, and black. The *IFN\u03bb3 sequence was obtained from the crystal structure of the IL10R\u03b2-IFN\u03bb3-IFN\u03bbR1 complex [23], which contains affinity-enhancing mutations on IFN\u03bb3 for stabilizing its interaction with IL10R\u03b2. (C) Binding mode of IFN\u03bb3 and IFN\u03bb4 towards IL10R\u03b2. The hydrogen bond network between IFN\u03bb3 and IL10R\u03b2 is shown and similar interactions between IFN\u03bb4 and IL10R\u03b2 are mapped based on the model structure of IL10R\u03b2-IFN\u03bb4-IFN\u03bbR1 (left). Surface representation of binding sites for IL10R\u03b2 Y82 and W143 within IFN\u03bb3 [23] and IFN\u03bb4 (right). Hydrophobic residues are colored in orange and grey. Hydrophobic pockets for harboring the hydrophobic residues of IL10R\u03b2 (Y82, W143) were found within both IFN\u03bb3 and IFN\u03bb4.
