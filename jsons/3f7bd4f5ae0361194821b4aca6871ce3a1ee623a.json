This would explain such neuropsychiatric symptoms in absence of conspicuous inflammation. Such organ-specific findings are reminiscent of those reported in Hantaviruses of the Bunyaviridae family that primarily target the pulmonary and renal vascular beds causing a hemorrhagic fever. 17 We postulate that SARS CoV-2 causes endothelial damage by binding ACE2 and misbalancing the renin-angiotensin pathway, dysregulating sphingolipids and activating the ceramide pathway, known to mediate endothelial cell apoptosis in the setting of radiation damage. 18, 19, 20 Such injury also generates reactive oxygen species, vasoconstriction and hypoxia, and ultimately the deposition of platelets on an exposed vessel basement membrane initiating the intravascular coagulopathy and multi-organ failure, pathognomonic of severe COVID-19 and death.",

While sHLH is a rare entity, in adults it is most commonly precipitated by viral infection, and is frequently associated with pulmonary complications, including ARDS. 29 Cytokine abnormalities in COVID-19 patients parallel those seen in sHLH 30 and suggest a role for the reticuloendothelial system, spleen and bone marrow as important mechanistic sites. Evaluation of lymph nodes showed preservation of B-cells in follicles, while three of four cases showed decreased CD8+ T-lymphocytes, and two showed decreased T-lymphocytes overall. While acknowledging small sample size, these findings are suggestive of histological corollaries to the decrease in peripheral blood lymphocytes seen in our patients, consistent with previous reports suggesting this may be a poor prognostic marker. 31,32 Our histologic findings of prominent hemophagocytosis and a sHLH-like phenotype in a subset of patients with concomitant elevation in cytokines and inflammatory markers suggest the importance of considering the imbalance of innate and adaptive immune responses with aberrant activation of macrophages, and a blunted adaptive immune response as a core feature in the pathogenesis of severe forms of COVID-19. Extension of these mechanisms to the understanding of the pediatric multi-system inflammatory syndrome potentially associated with COVID-19 is already being pursued. All rights reserved.
