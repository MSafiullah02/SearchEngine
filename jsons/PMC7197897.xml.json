            "text": "Influenza A viruses are members of the family Orthomyxoviridae, which comprises enveloped viruses with segmented, negative\u2010sense RNA genomes (Wright et al. 2007). Based on the antigenicity of the two surface glycoproteins, hemagglutinin (HA) and neuraminidase (NA), influenza A viruses are currently divided into 16 HA and 9 NA subtypes, designated as H1\u2013H16 and N1\u2013N9. Over the past century, only viruses of the H1N1, H2N2, H3N2 and H1N2 subtypes have circulated in humans (Wright et al. 2007). Highly pathogenic avian influenza A (HPAI) of the H5N1 subtype viruses cause severe disease in humans, characterized by rapidly progressive pneumonia, multiorgan dysfunction and high mortality rate of more than 50% (Neumann et al. 2010). Since 2003, they have spread across large parts of the globe and continued to cause sporadic human infections. Although HPAI H5N1 viruses fortunately have not acquired the ability for efficient infection in and transmission between humans, statistical evidence of human\u2010to\u2010human transmission has been obtained from epidemiological studies (Yang et al. 2007), suggesting the potential to acquire the ability of sustained human\u2010to\u2010human transmission. To prepare for the worst (namely, the occurrence of an influenza pandemic by this lethal virus), it is essential to evaluate the infectivity and pathogenicity of HPAI H5N1 virus.",

An essential step in the QMRA process is dose\u2013response assessment (Haas et al. 1999). Dose\u2013response relationships have been investigated for many types of pathogens, e.g. Escherichia coli O157:H7, rotavirus, Cryptosporidium parvum (1993, 2000; Teunis et al. 2002), by predicting the response from exposure to a given dose. Recently, the time\u2010dependent dose\u2013response models have been developed for improving postexposure decision\u2010making and/or for estimating exposure time for a point\u2010source outbreak, and they were proposed as an advanced approach for future QMRA frameworks (Huang and Haas 2009a; Huang et al. 2009b). As the mortality of humans infected with HPAI H5N1 virus is dependent on the days postexposure, based on the clinical observations (Liem et al. 2009), it is desirable to utilize time\u2010dependent dose\u2013response model for assessing and characterizing the risks of HPAI H5N1 virus infection to humans. However, to date, none of the prior studies investigated the dose\u2013response relationship to describe HPAI H5N1 virus infection.",

This is partly because there are no data sets describing human challenge with wild\u2010type HPAI H5N1 virus because of its high mortality. This situation seems common to other pathogens with a high virulence, such as SARS coronavirus (Watanabe et al. 2010). Prior microbial dose\u2013response studies on several pathogens, however, have demonstrated that data from animal experiments provide reasonable estimates for human susceptibility (Haas et al. 2000; Armstrong and Haas 2007; Bartrand et al. 2008). Mice have also been widely used as mammalian models to study the pathogenesis of HPAI H5N1 virus; a major advantage of this model is that infection experiments can be performed with large groups of animals, because of the relatively low cost and easy husbandry, to achieve statistical significance (Belser et al. 2009). Katz et al. (2000a) reported that H5N1\u2010infected mice exhibited inflammatory cell infiltration that is also observed for human fatal cases associated with HPAI H5N1 virus infection (de Jong 2008). Ferrets are excellent model to study the pathogenesis and transmissibility of influenza viruses because their clinical symptoms following influenza virus infection are similar to those of humans (Zitzow et al. 2002; Belser et al. 2009).",

In the present study, we constructed candidate time\u2010dependent models by incorporating time factor into the exponential or the beta\u2010Poisson model (Table 2), because it is reasonable to assume the random distribution of HPAI H5N1 virus.

To calculate infection risk and disease burden accurately, it is important to understand the factors determining the transmissibility, infectivity and lethality of HPAI H5N1 viruses. Hemagglutinin (HA) receptor specificity plays an important role in the transmission of influenza viruses, and the affinity of viral HA protein for sialic acid\u2010\u03b12,6\u2010galactose (SA\u03b12,6\u2010Gal; human\u2010like receptors) is required for the transmission among ferrets that express SA\u03b12,6\u2010Gal on respiratory tract tissues. Recent finding revealed that four influenza virus proteins, not only HA but also PB2, NS1 and PB1\u2010F2, are major determinants of virulence, pathogenicity and host range restriction (Neumann et al. 2010). Although only a limited number of dose\u2013response data on HPAI H5N1 virus are available to date, future dose\u2013response analysis on HPAI H5N1 viruses should consider these molecular factors for better understanding of their pathogenesis and transmissibility among humans. Further QMRA works on HPAI H5N1 viruses will also include the application of the dose\u2013response model by combining with the influenza virus shedding, transportation and exposure models, as described previously (Atkinson and Wein 2008; Nicas and Jones 2009).",
