However, individual departmental values, regional constraints, and the overall trajectory of this global pandemic must be considered as these will heavily influence the recommendations provided.

In anticipation of hospital overcrowding with COVID-19 patients, and to contain the COVID-19 spread, the American College of Surgeons (ACS) has recommended that surgeons delay elective surgeries in the United States. 3 In an effort to control the spread, most neurosurgery departments have adopted protocols triaging their currently scheduled cases, cancelling non-urgent elective surgeries, and limiting their clinics or employing tele-health visits to facilitate social distancing mandates, while continuing to treat patients. 4 Face to face patient care is limited to wound care and emergent ER evaluation only. Individual departments and neurosurgical subspecialties have established algorithms and recommendations for resource utilization and case triage during this stage to curtail the spread of COVID-19. [4] [5] [6] [7] [8] These measures are anticipated to remain in place as transmission measurably slows down and infrastructure is reestablished to safely manage care for patients.",

Patients should be advised to complete a tele-health consent form at this time and be given adequate instruction to set up tele-medicine capabilities. In person visits should be restricted to patients whose physical examination is unclear or concerning, to patients who are unable to, or refuse to participate in tele-health visits, and for in-depth discussions regarding planned procedures. Post-operative appointments will be virtual if possible, with inoffice wound care as necessary. Should point-of-care testing become available, patients who wish to be seen in the office may be tested in the office setting. In addition, if widespread serologic testing capable of identifying immunity to COVID-19 became available, a COVID recovered group of people capable of returning to work and serving in higher-risk roles could be identified within the department.",

Neurosurgeons should consider published subspecialty suggestions in addition to obtaining multidisciplinary consensus to drive the growth of case volume in the recovery period.
