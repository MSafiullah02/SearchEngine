ACE inhibitors represent the most used class of cardiovascular agents in the world, for the treatment of epidemic cardiovascular conditions such as hypertension and heart failure. Although not directly inhibited by ACE inhibitors, ACE2 is affected by chronic treatment with this class of drugs, which leads to an increase in ACE2 expression in several tissues [4]. Interestingly, this feature is also shared by another class of drugs, the angiotensin receptor-1 blockers (ARBs), whose chronic administration is as well able to increase the level of expression of ACE2 and also its activity, as assessed by the circulating levels of the ACE2 product, angiotensin 1\u20137 [5]. These findings support the concern that the treatment with Renin-Angiotensin System (RAS) inhibitors could make COVID-19 symptoms more severe due to increased expression of ACE2.",

            "text": "Similarly, the ACE2 upregulation argument has never been demonstrated in humans. Indeed, while there is conflicting evidence from animal studies that ARBs (probably not ACE inhibitors) may upregulate membrane-bound ACE2 in tissue-specific manners (e.g., heart but not kidney), these data cannot be extrapolated to humans, and are not sufficient to support facilitation of SARS-CoV-2 entry [9]. In particular, it has never been demonstrated that the ACE2 upregulation in the human lung occurs upon RAS inhibition, and even less that this causes a worsening of the COVID-19 disease. Furthermore, it can also be speculated that ACE2 upregulation is protective. Indeed, it has been shown that the binding of coronavirus to ACE2 leads to the downregulation of ACE2 [11], which in turn causes an ACE/ACE2 imbalance and to the excessive production of angiotensin II by the related ACE enzyme. This excess of Angiotensin II stimulates angiotensin II receptor type 1 (AT1R) and might cause an increase in pulmonary vascular permeability and lung damage [12]. Therefore, according to this hypothesis, the upregulation of ACE2, caused by the chronic intake of AT1R and ACE Inhibitors, could be protective through two mechanisms: first, by blocking the increased production of angiotensin 1\u20137, which has been advocated as a possible mechanism of protection for the lung; second, by reducing the production of Angiotensin II, it removes a cause of lung damage [13].",
