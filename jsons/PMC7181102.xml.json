Across every facet of medicine, clinicians are responding to the pandemic by modifying patient care to minimize exposure risk and preserve resources, and the management of patients with cancer poses unique challenges [1]. To provide preliminary guidance on the prioritization and treatment of breast cancer (BC) during this severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) outbreak, we assembled representatives from the American Society of Breast Surgeons (ASBrS), the National Accreditation Program for Breast Centers (NAPBC), the National Comprehensive Care Network (NCCN), the Commission on Cancer (CoC) and the American College of Radiology (ACR) to formulate an Expert Opinion. The objective of this Special Communication is to prioritize patient scenarios by urgency of treatment by specialty and to make treatment recommendations based on these priorities within each specialty. Given the rapidly evolving nature of the COVID-19 pandemic, time constraints prohibited a formal consensus statement.",

Furthermore, these recommendations are driven by the common goal to preserve hospital resources for virus-inflicted patients by deferring BC treatments without significantly compromising long-term outcomes for individual BC patients. The demands that the COVID-19 pandemic will place on healthcare institutions remain unpredictable and will have geographical variability. Therefore, the risks of disease progression and compromised BC-specific outcomes need to be weighed against viral exposure to patients and staff, taking into consideration each individual\u2019s comorbidities and age to predict risk of mortality from COVID-19. Lastly, these are recommendations and are not intended to supersede individual physician judgment or institutional policies and guidelines.",

A short delay (e.g. 6\u201312 weeks) would not impact overall outcome for these patients. Longer delays could impact outcomes in some Priority B patients and triage may become necessary to justify which patients should undergo treatment versus further delay.

Priority B patients should be evaluated by at least one member of the multidisciplinary team in-person or remotely depending on need. These include newly diagnosed BC patients; established patients with new problems (breast infection, palpable findings, and significant symptoms from therapy); patients on active IV chemotherapy; patients completing neoadjuvant therapy preparing for surgery; routine postoperative patients; and patients being evaluated and planned for radiation therapy. Priority C patients are those presenting for routine follow-up for benign or malignant conditions (including those on oral adjuvant agents and those not on active treatment), survivorship visits, or high-risk screening and can be seen remotely or delayed until the postpandemic period.

Locally advanced or inflammatory patients may have worse outcomes after neoadjuvant chemotherapy if RT is delayed > 8 weeks (Priority B1) [47]. In contrast, delaying RT 20 weeks in early-stage, ER + patients after BCS demonstrates no difference in outcomes compared to 4\u20138 weeks (Priority B3) [48]. Since Priority B sub-stratifies by clinical-pathologic recurrence risk, B1 patients should be given priority over B2 or B3; hypofractionated (HF) regimens should be strongly considered whenever possible. Long-term outcomes with HF-RT utilizing 42.5 Gy/16 or 40 Gy/15 fractions demonstrate safety and efficacy similar to conventional fractionation which will reduce patient/staff exposure [45, 46]. Though regional-nodal and postmastectomy patients were under-represented in these trials, historic [49] and emerging [50] data suggest no differences in efficacy or toxicity for these sub-groups. Current trials are evaluating HF with reconstruction (Alliance221505/ NCT03414970; FABREC Trial/ NCT03422003). Furthermore, additional intensive regimens after lumpectomy (FAST: 28.5 Gy in 5 once-weekly fractions [51, 52]; FAST Forward: 26 Gy in 5 fractions over 1 week [53]) suggest early toxicity comparable to 40 Gy/15 fractions. These regimens may be considered in selected patients undergoing breast RT (without regional-nodal RT). Similarly, a boost should be reserved for patients with greatest absolute benefit (e.g., positive margins, age \u2264 40) [54].",

Management of BC patients requires a highly integrated and multidisciplinary approach. An intervention in one specialty will have a direct impact on another specialty. For example, the American College of Surgeons issued a statement that elective surgeries should be canceled [17]. Fortunately, many BC patients do not need upfront surgical resection because of neoadjuvant treatment options. However, deferring BC cases will initially increase the medical oncologist workload and will result in a backlog of procedures when the pandemic resolves. For these reasons, multidisciplinary discussion documenting Priority category for surgery and/or adjuvant treatments is necessary to ensure the best outcomes for patients. If feasible, tumor board discussions should include both standard and COVID-19 recommendations based on institution\u2019s level of pandemic severity. Documentation of these discussions in the medical record is highly recommended.",
