Quantitation of hydrogen peroxide indicated excellent linearity and yielded a detection limit of 10 microM, comparable with previously reported results using micromachined silicon microfluidic chips with integrated silicon photodiodes.

            "text": "One of the more promising uses of nanofluidic devices is isolation and analysis of individual biomolecules, such as DNA, which could lead to new detection schemes for cancer. One approach to this entails construction of silicon nanowires on a substrate, or chip, using standard photolithographic and etching techniques, followed by a chemical oxidation step that converts the nanowires into hollow nanotubes. Using this process, one can reliably create nanotubes with diameters as small as 10 nm, although devices used for biomolecule isolation contain nanotubes with a diameter of 50 nm. To trap DNA molecules requires a device consisting of a silicon nanotube connecting two parallel microfluidic channels. Electrodes provide a source of current used to drive DNA into the nanotubes. Each time a single DNA molecule moves into the nanotube, the electrical current changes suddenly. The current returns to its baseline value when the DNA molecule exits the nanotube. On average, a DNA molecule remains within the nanotube for about 7.5 msec, which should be sufficient to make a variety of analytical measurements that could reveal cancer-associated mutations. Optical and electrical circuitry is now being added to probe the trapped DNA molecules. A nanostructured array platform, in which an electrophoretic particle entrapment system is used to immobilize nanoparticles coated with biological reagents, has been used to develop a highly sensitive immunoassay for detection of single biological molecules at multiple sites with nanometer scale precision (Han et al. 2013) . Potential applications include those requiring portable, POC and real-time monitoring with high sensitivity.",

Isoelectric points are chemical features that refer to the electrical state of a molecule when it has no net charge. Conventional protein chips use a gel across which an electric current is applied to find the targeted protein's isoelectric points. In the protein nanobiochip, instead of being filtered through a block of gel, the protein molecules are separated by their isoelectric points by a capillary action as the proteins flow in a solution along channels in the chip. A chip measuring 21 mm 2 contains four sets of tiny channels in which the capillary action takes place. The protein molecules are then dried and irradiated by a laser. Their molecular weights are then measured by a mass spectrometer. The laser helps the proteins leave the chip, and the mass spectrometer is used to judge the molecular weights of the protein molecules in the samples by measuring how early they reach a detector. In the mass spectrometer, light molecules fly faster than heavy ones in an electric field. The mass spectrometer judges the weight of the molecules by monitoring the timing of when each molecule reaches a detector. In addition to being faster than techniques that use gel blocks, nanobiochip also needs blood samples of about 1 \u03bcL compared to about 20 \u03bcL or more that are needed using gel-based techniques.",

The UTLC-SERS plate consists of an AgNR array fabricated by oblique angle deposition. The capability of the AgNR substrates to separate the different compounds in a mixture was explored using a mixture of four dyes and a mixture of melamine and Rhodamine 6G at varied concentrations with different mobile phase solvents. After UTLC separation, spatially-resolved SERS spectra were collected along the mobile phase development direction and the intensities of specific SERS peaks from each component were used to generate chromatograms. The limits of detection are between 10-5 and 10-6 M. Furthermore, we show that the coupling of UTLC with SERS improves the SERS detection specificity, as small amounts of target analytes can be separated from the interfering background components. The nanorods act as the detection medium as well as the separation medium, so it is a two-in-one system. This single-step method can rapidly and accurately detect viruses, bacteria and chemical contaminants. In a series of studies, the scientists could detect compounds such as lactic acid and the protein albumin in highly diluted samples and in mixtures that included dyes and other chemicals. Their results suggest that the same system could be used to detect pathogens and contaminants in biological mixtures such as food, blood, saliva and urine. Whereas the detection of viruses using techniques such as PCR can take days or even weeks and requires fluorescent labels, the on-chip method yields results in <1 h without the use of molecular labels.",

Submicron dot and line molecular patterns were generated with resolution that depended on the magnitude of the applied voltage, dwell time, and writing speed. By using an energetic argument and a Kelvin condensation model, the quasi-equilibrium liquid-air interface at the probe tip was determined. The analysis revealed the origin of the need for electric fields in achieving protein transport to the substrate and confirmed experimental observations suggesting that pattern resolution is controlled by tip sharpness and not overall probe aperture.

Bottom-up fabrication of surface bound nanostructures enables the immobilization of different types of biomolecules. The method works on transparent as well as on opaque substrates.

Chromosome nanolithography, with a resolution beyond the limit of light microscopy, could be useful for the construction of chromosome band libraries and for molecular cytogenetic mapping in investigation of genetic diseases.",

High profile and high value tests offered as point-of-care (POC) assays are adaptable to include 3DNA\u00ae reagents to improve the limit of detection. Genisphere has reported a 64-fold improvement of sensitivity in a model lateral flow (LF) POC test. Similar improvements in sensitivity have been observed in other LF assays, and it is expected that use of this technology will reduce the false negative rate and significantly improve the accuracy of the otherwise subjective reading of the outcome. The stability of dendrimer reagents in solution is known to exceed 12 months, and preliminary experiments studying the stability of dried dendrimer reagents suggest a similar stability profile. Improved fluorescent detection will further enable POC tests to become more quantitative and better predictive of disease, condition and outcome. Because it is a passive amplification technology (unlike PCR, for example), the 3DNA\u00ae target-specific probe may be used to improve the sensitivity of existing bioassays without significant modification.

If a patterned sensor surface of multiple DNA strands is used, the technique can detect millions of different DNA sequences simultaneously.

Gold nanoparticles are particularly good labels for sensors because a variety of analytical techniques can be used to detect them, including optical absorption, fluorescence, Raman scattering, atomic or magnetic force, and electrical conductivity. Gold nanoparticles and Raman spectroscopy have been used to detect bacteria and viruses. This approach could replace PCR and fluorescent tags commonly used today. The detection system can also be used on biochips dotted with DNA. If the targeted disease exists in the sample, its DNA will bind onto the complementary strands of DNA on the chip and gold nanoparticle. The chip is treated with silver-based solution, which coats the nanoparticles. When exposed to a light scanner, the coating enhances the signal enough to detect minute amounts of DNA. Since the Raman band is narrower than the fluorescent band, it allows more dyes to detect more targets quickly. If the sequence of interest is present in the sample, it will bind to the DNA and cause the solution to change color. Labeling oligonucleotide targets with gold nanoparticle rather than fluorophore probes substantially alters the melting profiles of the targets from an array substrate.

The nanoprobe has a modular multivalent core-shell architecture consisting of a biodegradable heterobifunctional dendritic core chemoselectively functionalized with heterobifunctional polyethylene oxide (PEO) chains that form a protective shell, which imparts biological stealth and dictates the pharmacokinetics. Each of the eight branches of the dendritic core was functionalized for labeling with radiohalogens. Placement of radioactive moieties at the core was designed to prevent in vivo dehalogenation, a potential problem for radiohalogens in imaging and therapy. Targeting peptides of cyclic arginine-glycine-aspartic acid (RGD) motifs were installed at the terminal ends of the PEO chains to enhance their accessibility to \u03b1v\u03b23 integrin receptors. This nanoscale design enabled a 50-fold enhancement of the binding affinity to \u03b1v\u03b23 integrin receptors with respect to the monovalent RGD peptide alone Cell-based assays of the 125 I-labeled dendritic nanoprobes using \u03b1v\u03b23-positive cells showed a sixfold increase in \u03b1v\u03b23 receptor-mediated endocytosis of the targeted nanoprobe compared with the nontargeted nanoprobe, whereas \u03b1v\u03b23-negative cells showed no enhancement of cell uptake over time. In vivo biodistribution studies of 76 Br-labeled dendritic nanoprobes showed excellent bioavailability for the targeted and nontargeted nanoprobes.

In contrast to most of ultrasound contrast agents, CNTs can be visualized within a wide variety of frequencies in a phantom bladder using tissue harmonic imaging modality. In vivo in the pig bladder MWCNTs can be observed at low frequencies, which are appropriate for abdominal organs. No toxicity of CNTs was observed by animal autopsy, organ histology and immunostaining, blood count, and chemical profile.

The goal is to create a high density of the glowing particles at the site of tumor growth so they are easily visible. Molecular MRI results have been corroborated by histology. This lowers the limit for detecting sparse biomarkers with molecular MRI in vivo when the growths are still invisible to conventional MRI. Earlier detection can potentially increase the effectiveness of treatment.

A second benefit of the approach is that the same nanoparticles used to find the tumors could potentially deliver stronger doses of anticancer drugs directly to the tumor site with fewer side effects. Targeting the drugs to the tumor site in this way would also allow stronger doses without systemic toxicity than would be possible if the drug were injected or delivered in some other systemic way.

Using targeted MNPs, in vivo MM-OCT images exhibit strong magnetomotive signals in mammary tumor, and no significant signals were measured from tumors of rats injected with nontargeted MNPs or saline. The results of in vivo MM-OCT are validated by MRI, ex vivo MM-OCT, Prussian blue staining of histological sections, and immunohistochemical analysis of excised tumors and internal organs. The MNPs are antibody functionalized to target the human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2 neu) protein. Fc-directed conjugation of the antibody to the MNPs aids in reducing uptake by macrophages in the reticulo-endothelial system, thereby increasing the circulation time in the blood. These engineered magnetic nanoprobes have multifunctional capabilities enabling them to be used as dynamic contrast agents in MM-OCT and MRI.",

The presence of lymph node metastases is an important factor in breast cancer patient prognosis. Therefore, the precise identification of SLNs in these patients is critical. Conventional methods have drawbacks including lack of depth, skin staining (blue dye), poor spatial resolution, and exposure to ionizing radiation. Among the newer methods, magnetic resonance lymphography, in which a gadolinium labeled nanoparticle is injected and imaged provide superior anatomic resolution and assessment of lymphatic dynamics, overcoming some of the drawbacks of other methods. Optical imaging employing various nanoparticles, including QDs, also provides the capability of mapping each lymphatic drainage in a different color'. However, autofluorescence arising from normal tissues can compromise the sensitivity and specificity of in vivo fluorescence imaging using QDs by lowering the target-to-background signal ratio. Since bioluminescence resonance energy transfer QD (BRET-QD) nanoparticles can selfilluminate in NIR in the presence of the substrate, imaging using BRET-QDs does not produce any autofluorescence. These advantages of BRET-QD enable real-time, quantitative lymphatic imaging without image processing (Kosaka et al. 2011 ).",

Four different sizes of QDs, with emissions at 525, 545, 565, and 585 nm are mixed with a polymer and coated onto the magnetic microbeads (8 \u03bcm-diameter) to generate a nanobarcoded QBeads. Twelve intensity levels for each of the four colors are used. Gene-specific oligonucleotide probes are conjugated to the surface of each spectrally nanobarcoded bead to create a multiplexed panel, and biotinylated cRNAs are generated from sample total RNA and hybridized to the gene probes on the microbeads. A fifth streptavidin QD (655 nm or infrared QD) binds to biotin on the cRNA, acting as a quantification reporter. The intensity of the 655 nm Qdot reflects the level of biotinylated cRNA captured on the beads and provides the quantification for the corresponding target gene. The system shows a level of sensitivity, which is better than that with a high-density microarray system, and approaches the level usually observed for quantitative PCR. The QBead nanobarcode system has a dynamic range of 3.5 logs, better than the 2-3 logs observed on various microarray platforms. The hybridization reaction is performed in liquid phase and completed in 1-2 h, at least 1 order of magnitude faster than microarray-based hybridizations. Detectable fold change is lower than 1.4-fold, showing high precision even at close to single copy per cell level. Reproducibility for this proof-of-concept study approaches that of Affymetrix GeneChip microarray. In addition, it provides increased flexibility, convenience, and cost-effectiveness in comparison to conventional gene expression profiling methods.",

Magnetic separation of the complexed probes and target followed by dehybridization of the oligonucleotides on the nanoparticle probe surface allows the determination of the presence of the target protein by identifying the oligonucleotide sequence released from the nanoparticle probe. Because the nanoparticle probe carries with it several oligonucleotides per protein binding event, there is substantial amplification and PSA can be detected at 30 attomolar concentration. Alternatively, a PCR on the oligonucleotide bar codes can boost the sensitivity to three attomolar. Comparable clinically accepted conventional assays for detecting the same target have sensitivity limits of three picomolar, six orders of magnitude less sensitive than what is observed with this method. Further development of this technology has resulted in a biobarcode assay with a 500 zeptomolar target DNA sensitivity limit (Nam et al. 2004) . Magnetic separation and subsequent release of bar code DNA from the gold nanoparticles leads to many barcode DNA strands for every target DNA (see Fig. 4 .2).",

The DNA barcodes are then released from the complex and detected via hybridization to a surface immobilized DNA probe and an oligonucleotide functionalized gold nanoparticle. The gold particles are enlarged through silver deposition, and the light scattered from the particles is detected using the Verigene Reader optical detection system.

Nucleic acid targets are recognized by DNA-modified gold probes, which undergo a color change that is visually detectable when the solutions are spotted onto an illuminated glass waveguide. Sensitivity of the spot test is improved by monitoring scattered light rather than reflected light from 40-to 50-nm diameter gold particles.

By putting together two specific nanostructures made of gold or silver, a prototype device can be constructed, which exhibits a highly sensitive ability to detect specific chemicals in the immediate surroundings once it is optimized. The nanostructures measure about 200 nm. One is shaped like a flat circular disk while the other looks like a doughnut with a hole in the middle. When brought together they interact with light very differently to the way they behave on their own. When they are paired up they scatter some specific colors within white light much less, leading to an increased amount of light passing through the structure undisturbed. This is distinctly different to how both structures scatter light separately. Metal nanostructures have been used as sensors but they interact very strongly with light due to so-called localized plasmon resonances. But this is the first time a pair with such a carefully tailored interaction with light has been created. This decrease in the interaction with light is in turn affected by the composition of molecules close to the structures.

These NWs are structurally stable and demonstrate an unprecedented sensitivity as sensors for detection of antibodies and other biologically important molecules. According to researchers, not only can the NWs detect extremely minute concentrations (as few as 1000 individual molecules in a cubic millimeter), they can do it without the hazard or inconvenience of any added fluorescent or radioactive detection probes. The study demonstrated ability of the NWs to monitor antibody binding, and to sense real-time live cellular immune response using T lymphocyte activation as a model. Within ~10 s, the NW could register T cell activation as the release acid to the device.

NIR light also passes harmlessly through skin, muscle and cartilage, so the new probes could detect tumors and other diseases at sites deep in the body without the need for a biopsy or invasive surgery. The probe's design makes use of a technique called \"quenching\" that involves tethering a gold nanoparticle to the QD to inhibit luminescence. The tether, a peptide sequence measuring only a few nanometers, holds the gold close enough to prevent the QD from giving off its light. The peptide tether used is one that is cleaved by the enzyme collagenase. The luminescence of the QDs is cut by more than 70% when they are attached to the gold particles. They remain dark until the nanostructures were exposed to collagenase after which the luminescence steadily returns.

Fluorescent QDs have been used to label MSC effectively, are easy to use, and show a high yield as well as survival rate with minimal cytotoxic effects. Dose-dependent effects, however, suggest limiting MSC QD exposure.",

Long-term labeling of bone marrow-derived hMSCs with RGD-conjugated QDs was demonstrated during self-replication and differentiation into osteogenic cell lineages. Labeling of hMSCs with QDs has been carried out during selfreplication, and multilineage differentiations into osteogenic, chondrogenic, and adipogenic cells. QD-labeled hMSCs remained viable as unlabeled hMSCs from the same subpopulation suggesting the use of bioconjugated QDs as an effective probe for long-term labeling of stem cells.",

NTNFETs with immobilized synthetic oligonucleotides can specifically recognize target DNA sequences, including a SNP in the HFE gene that is responsible for hereditary hemochromatosis, a disease in which too much iron accumulates in body tissues. The electronic responses of NTNFETs upon single-stranded DNA immobilization and subsequent DNA hybridization events have been confirmed by using fluorescence-labeled oligonucleotides and then further explored for label-free DNA detection at picomolar to micromolar concentrations. A strong effect of DNA counterions on the electronic response has been observed, suggesting a charge-based mechanism of DNA detection using NTNFET devices. Implementation of label-free electronic detection assays using NTNFETs constitutes an important step toward low-cost, low-complexity, highly sensitive and accurate molecular diagnostics. Label-free electronic detection of DNA has several advantages over state-of-the-art optical techniques, including cost, time, and simplicity. The sensitivity of the new device is good enough to detect a single-base mutation in an amount of DNA present in one milliliter of blood.

The two similar but slightly different biosensors are integrated into \"smart\" fabrics -garments with wireless technology and will be able to monitor a patient's respiration rate and body temperature in real time. The addition of CNTs with pentacene increases biosensor sensitivity. As an organic semiconductor, pentacene is efficient and easy to control. Both biosensors were fabricated directly on flexible polymeric substrates. The strain sensor, which would monitor respiration rate, consisted of a Wheatstone bridge, an instrument that measures unknown electrical resistance, and a thin pentacene film that acted as a sensing layer. The system would work when a physiological strain, such as breathing, creates a mechanical deformation of the sensor, which then affects the electrical current's resistance. For the temperature sensor, the researchers used a thin-film transistor that helped them to observe electrical current in linear response to temperature change. Most importantly, in low voltage areas, the current displayed the highest sensitivity to temperature changes. This device is useful for patients whose vital signs must be continuously monitored on bedside either at home or in hospital. The sensors and wireless networks can fit on garments such as undershirts. With this technology, the smart fabric can monitor vital signs and collect and send data to an information center in real time. The information can enable immediate detection of physiological abnormalities, which will allow physicians to begin treatment or prevent illness before full-blown disease manifestation.",

Researcher have taken a major step towards making an existing miniature lab-on-a-chip fully portable, so the tiny device can perform hundreds of chemical experiments in any setting including the battlefield. This will make testing soldiers to see if they have been exposed to biological or chemical weapons much faster and easier. Neither of the previous approaches, such as mechanically forcing fluid through microchannels or capillary electro-osmosis, offer portability. Within the lab-on-achip, biological fluids such as blood are pumped through channels about 10 microns wide. Each channel has its own pumps, which direct the fluids to certain areas of the chip so they can be tested for the presence of specific molecules. In the new system, known as a 3D AC electro-osmotic pump, tiny electrodes with raised steps generate opposing slip velocities at different heights, which combine to push the fluid in one direction, like a conveyor belt. Simulations predict a dramatic improvement in flow rate, by almost a factor of twenty, so that fast (mm/s) flows, comparable to pressuredriven systems, can be attained with battery voltages. If exposure to chemical or biological weapons is suspected, the device can automatically and rapidly test a miniscule blood sample, rather than sending a large sample to a laboratory and waiting for the results. The chips are so small and cheap to make that they could be designed to be disposable, or they could be made implantable. Another project focuses on research to develop different approaches to sensing and characterization of materials, including toxins, with identifiable chemical signatures. Each project exploits manipulation of nanoscale features of materials to achieve one or more of specificity, spatial resolution, convenience of use, reduced power demand, or multi-functionality.",

The main goal of project is to develop a novel optical nanobiosensor based on extraordinary vibrational signal enhancement of the proteins to be detected. To reach vibrational signal enhancement, the optical properties of specially designed metallic nanoparticles will be exploited, which should act as nanoantenna and the associated field enhancement to obtain a direct detection of proteins bound to the nanoparticle. Thus, this sensor will reach high sensitivity provided by the recently established large enhancement of vibration signals due to the resonant excitation of the nanoantenna device used as substrates. The aim is to detect only a few proteins with concentration much lower than 1pM and finally to reach detection threshold such as femtomole or lower. High molecular selectivity will be reached with the functionalization of the nanoantenna. Such functionalization will selectively favor the immobilization of the protein to be detected at the vicinity of the nanoparticle surface, providing the best enhancement and then the detection of the targeted protein. The nanobiosensor will include two main components: the nanoantenna device which corresponds to the sensor transducer and the functionalization which corresponds to its bioreceptor. Each functionalized nanoantenna device used as vibrational signal enhanced system is an individual and specific nanosensor of proteins. Therefore, this nanobiosensor integrated in a vibrational spectroscope will enable the detection and the analysis of the enhanced vibrational signal from the targeted proteins corresponding to the diagnosis instrument. Our nanobiosensor will be validated on the detection of proteins on body fluids. These proteins have been chosen because they were identified as specific biomarkers of common pathologies. This validation will improve their detection (better sensitivity, decrease of the detection threshold) and open the way to the early diagnosis.",
