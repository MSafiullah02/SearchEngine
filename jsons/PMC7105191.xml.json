For example, an event called \u201cToyota 2009\u20132010 vehicle recalls\u201d contains several interrelated component events; therefore, the event \u201cToyota recall due to safety problems from 2009 to 2010\u201d causes the event \u201cNHTSA conduct investigations for Toyota recall\u201d to happen, as well as the event \u201cUS congressional hearings hold for Toyota recall\u201d, and so on. Also, the event \u201cUS congressional hearings hold for Toyota recall\u201d has a strong relationship with the event \u201cToyota\u2019s president to testify in US congressional hearings\u201d. Among these component events, some are more important than others, and these important component events carry more weight as they affect the other component events. For instance, it is clear that the event \u201cToyota recall due to safety problems from 2009 to 2010\u201d is a \u201cmilestone\u201d component event that is more important than other related events, because it affects and causes the occurrence of the other component events.",

Using two factors alone is inadequate for identifying dependence relationships among component events for the purpose of forming an overall picture of a major event\u2019s evolution. For example, the event \u201cToyota recall due to safety problems from 2009 to 2010\u201d shares little similar content with the events \u201cNHTSA conducts investigations for Toyota recall\u201d and \u201cUS congressional hearings hold for Toyota recall\u201d. It is obvious that the first event has a strong affect on the latter two events, as it actually caused them to happen. Unfortunately, previous work in this field has not analyzed event relationships and cannot discover the dependence relationships between any two events that do not share enough similar content. As a result, the main picture of a \u201cbig event\u201d that has been discovered by previous scholarship is often incomplete, and significant relationships are missing. Furthermore, as there is no facility in this work for measuring event importance, it does not identify milestone events that are significant for most users to know.",

            "text": "\n\u2022Previous attempts to discover dependence relationships between two events measure the similarity of content by matching keywords (terms) related to the events. However, there may be some keywords (in the two events) that are related/dependent but not identical. For example, \u201chospital\u201d and \u201cdoctor\u201d are dependent, but previous methods have treated them as having no relationship. To avoid this limitation, we adopt mutual information criteria to measure the dependence between two terms (features), and we then aggregate all mutual information among features in events to measure the degree of content dependence between the events. This process is called content dependence (CD) analysis, and the dependence relationship that is discovered based on the dependence features of two events is called the content dependence relationship.\u2022Content dependence analysis of events cannot form a complete picture of an event\u2019s development. According to studies in Journalism [8] and our own observation, it is not unusual for authors (reporters) to write news articles on an event by referring to other events when they notice a dependent relationship between them. For instance, some news articles about the event \u201cToyota recall due to safety problems from 2009 to 2010\u201d refer to the event \u201cNHTSA conduct investigations for Toyota recall\u201d. Motivated by this phenomena, we explore event reference (ER) analysis to detect whether there is an inter-event relationship specified by authors. The relationship between two events discovered by ER analysis is considered an event reference (ER) relationship, which has not been explored by previous research.\u2022In contrast to previous work that has only considered temporal relationships and content similarity, we adopt three kinds of event relationships (temporal relationship, CD relationship obtained by CD analysis and ER relationship obtained by ER analysis) to identify the dependence relationship between two events. Note that CD and ER relationships are essentially event dependence relationships that are discovered using two different approaches. CD relationships and ER relationships can be complementary to each other in identifying event dependence relationships. Some event dependence relationships are detected by content dependence analysis, while others are detected by event reference analysis only.\u2022The search results are organized by a temporal event map (TEM) that constitutes the overall picture of an event\u2019s evolution along the timeline. Fig. 1 shows an example TEM of the event \u201cToyota 2009\u20132010 vehicle recalls\u201d. A TEM provides a way to organize and represent the event search results by showing the interrelationships between/among the events. The value on the edge shows the strength of relevance between two events. It provides an easier and more efficient means for users to understand events comprehensively.\u2022Generally, people are more interested in important component events than in ordinary ones. Based on the event relationships in a TEM, we propose a method to measure the degree of importance of events, and we rank events based on their degrees of importance, thereby discovering the \u201cmilestone\u201d events for a given query. Several of the algebraic operators of a TEM are devised for users to view the target event from different perspectives.\u2022To evaluate the performance of our proposed approach, we conduct experiments on a real data set by comparing a number of baseline methods. Experimental results show that our method outperforms baseline methods in discovering event dependence relationships, as well as in ranking events based on event importance. Furthermore, a case study selected from our experiments shows that our method can discover new relationships that cannot be discovered by previous methods and are even missed/ignored by annotators. Finally, we show the use of these operators on a TEM via select examples.\n",

A logic-based event reasoning tool to identify regions of uncertainty within a stream is introduced in [12]. In distributed systems, event derivation is hampered by uncertainty that is attributed to causes such as unreliable data sources or the inability to determine with certainty whether an event has actually occurred, given the available information.

[17] define temporal summaries of news stories and propose methods for constructing temporal summaries. Smith [18] explores detecting and browsing events from unstructured text/s. Chieu et al. [19] present a framework and a system that extracts events according to a query from a set of documents and organize events along a timeline. Some techniques are proposed to detect particular kinds of events. For example, Fisichella et al. [20] propose an approach combining aspects from different feature-based event detection methods to detect public health events in an unsupervised manner. Modeling and discovering relationships among events is generally out of the scope of current TDT research.",

They consider temporal relationships instead of evolution relationships. Although the temporal relationships can help organize event episodes in sequences according to their temporal order, they do not necessarily reflect the evolutionary paths between events. Some extended examples of these methods are presented in [7] and [29]. Yang et al. [6] define the event evolution relationships between events and propose a way to measure these event evolution relationships. In their work, identifying an event evolution relationship between two events depends on the similarity of the features of the two events. Based on a small number of documents and events about a given news topic, Nallapati et al. [30] define the concept of event threading. Their definition of event threading is based on the content similarity relationship from a previous event to a later event. The event threading is organized as a tree structure rather than a graph. In order to identify event threading, they employ a simple similarity measure between documents to cluster documents into events, and they use the average document similarity to estimate the content dependencies between events. Feng and Allan [4] extend Nallapati\u2019s work to passage threading by breaking each news story into finer granules, and they propose a model called incident threading in [5]. Table 1 shows the comparison of our methods and previous methods regarding different dependencies.",

Therefore, the standard answer set is an aggregation (the intersection) of the annotations given by all the annotators.

In our testing, we use two query events: one is \u201cSARS in 2003\u201d, which contains the largest number of related news articles and the other is \u201cChristchurch Earthquake in 2010 in New Zealand\u201d, which contains the fewest number of related news articles. Fig. 3 shows the effect of \u03b1 on Precision, Recall and F-measure. According to Fig. 3, we find that as \u03b1 increases, the Precision and F-measure increase while Recall decreases. The reason for this is that when the value \u03b1 is small, there are many event dependence relationships with a dependence degree higher than \u03b1 (but the dependence relationship is still actually \u201cweak\u201d), so the Recall is high and the Precision is low. We tune the parameter \u03b1 based on two queries which are not in the test queries. For these two queries, we obtain the highest value of F-measure when \u03b1=0.65.

Fig. 4 and Table 2 show the comparison of our method with one baseline method (i.e., EEG) and two variations (i.e., ERM and CDM) on Precision, Recall and F\u2212measure. According to Fig. 4, it is clear that our method outperforms other three methods on Precision, Recall and F\u2212measure. The Precision and Recall values of our method are approximately 0.8, meaning that most event dependence relationships discovered by our method are correct, and also that our method can discover more event dependence relationships than other three methods. Our method\u2019s F\u2212measure score is also approximately 0.8, since it is a combination of Precision and Recall. Note that CDM outperforms EEG slightly on all metrics, and the reason is that using mutual information to measure feature dependence is better than only matching keyword similarity (as was done in most previous research). ERM outperforms EEG and CDM on all three metrics. This indicates that using event reference analysis (i.e., ERM) to identify event dependence relationships is more effective than using content dependence relationship analysis (i.e., CDM) and content similarity analysis (i.e., EEG). Also, it is quite interesting to see that the Recall of CDM is greater than that of ERM, while both of them are smaller than those of our method. This means that the event dependence relationships identified by CDM and ERM are indeed different and complementary. Our method is a combination of CDM and ERM, and it has the strength of both methods. In other words, taking both content dependence and event reference analysis into consideration in identifying event dependence relationships produces better results than taking just one of these.",

In Fig. 7, the size of each node represents the importance of an event, and width of each line represents the strength degree of a dependence relationship between events. According to the result, our method misses only 7 relationships, while the EEG method misses 17 relationships. Table 5 shows the statistics of the event relationships discovered by our method and EEG, vis-a-vis the results of the human annotators for this case. As shown, our method finds more, and miss less, correct inter-event relationships. In addition, our method discovers not only the inter-event relationships but also the strength degrees of such relationships. Comparing the relationships missed by our method and EEG, we find that most missing relationships (6 out of 7) are also missing in EEG, and these relationships are: from event 5 to event 1, from event 5 to event 12, from event 2 to event 12, from event 4 to event 6, from event 6 to event 1, and from event 10 to event 8. Only one relationship missed by our method was found by EEG, which is from event 8 to event 11. In contrast, most relationships missed by EEG were discovered by our method. For instance, EEG did not find any relationships for events 1, 4, 5 and 10, while our method found their dependence relationships with other events. We find that most of the relationships missed by EEG were discovered by our method due to event reference analysis rather than content dependence analysis. This means that content dependence analysis and event reference analysis should work together in identifying event dependence relationships.",

For the relationship between events 5 and 2, note that event 5 is about the outbreak of SARS and infections that can cause more new SARS cases to appear and make the disease more serious. For the relationship between events 3 and 2, note that event 2 is about the number of SARS cases reported by hospitals, and when SARS cases increased and the disease spread, more and more patients contracted the disease and called for hospital care.

To evaluate the ranking mechanism, we also ask annotators to rank the component events for the query QSARS according to their importance. Table 6 shows the rankings of the component events obtained by our method and those given by annotators. The two sets of event rankings are similar.5\nFor events 2, 9 and 10, our method regards these as important because they have many relationships with (much effect on) others, while events 1, 4, 6, 7 and 12 are not so important because they have fewer relationships with (less effect on) others. This shows that ranking events by event relationships is a reasonable and effective approach. Such an event ranking facility can help users find the \u201cmilestone\u201d component events easily. Exceptions, such as event 8 and event 7, have lower ranks because our method also missed 7 relationships (such as the one from event 8 to event 11 and so on.) This further confirms the necessity and importance to find out more dependence relationships in order to facilitate better event search and ranking. Event 8 is an example of an exception, and as mentioned earlier, our method misses 7 relationships, including the one from event 8 to event 11 and the one from event 10 to event 8. If we take these missed relationships into account, the ranking of event 8 will rise. Another exception is that our method views event 7 as less important than event 4.
