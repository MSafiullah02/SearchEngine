This is to be expected, as the binding pocket is rich in aromatic amino acids (His41, His166,   His175 , Tyr54, and Phe143). Apparently, ligands' aromatic rings stack against these aromatic residues in the binding pocket is likely to lead to a high binding affinity. However, the emergence of several dipole (Table 1) . Furthermore, MCC of the (Table 1) . Merging pharmacophores that share common features has been reported to improve the performance of pharmacophores in capturing active molecules. 66 Additionally, Hypo(K-T5-3/N-T1-1) was further modified by adding exclusion spheres (Section S8 and Table S6 ) to further enhance its ROC profile (Table 1) . Exclusion volumes resemble inaccessible regions within the binding site. Figure 3D shows the sterically refined version of Figure 3F) . Finally, the hydrogen bonding interaction anchoring the ligand's tertiary amide carbonyl to the peptide NH of Glu169 corresponds to fitting the same carbonyl against HBA feature in Hypo(K-T5-3/N-T1-1) ( Figure 3C ). These findings showed that Hypo(K-T5-3/N-T1-1) represents a valid binding mode exhibited by the ligands within the binding pocket of HKU4-CoV 3CL pro .

However, Hypo(K-T5-3) and Hypo(N-T1-1) (Figure 3A,B) have 3 pharmacophoric features in common: hydrophobic (Hbic), ring aromatic (RingArom), and hydrogen bond acceptor (HBA) features. The close resemblance between these 2 pharmacophores combined with their equivalent contributions to bioactivity (as indicated by their slopes in QSAR Equations 3 and 4) suggest that they might represent a common binding mode assumed by ligands within the HKU4-CoV 3CL pro binding pocket. Therefore, these 2 pharmacophores were merged in a single binding model (Hypo(K-T5-3/N-T1-1) (Figure 3).

The close proximity between the ligand's thiophenoyl moiety and the sulfide of Met25 (Figure 3F) suggests the presence of a mutual hydrophobic interaction, which correlates with mapping the same ring against a Hbic feature in Hypo(K-T5-3/N-T1-1) (Figure 3C). Similarly, mapping the carbonyl of the same thiophenoyl moiety against HBA feature in Hypo(K-T5-3/ N-T1-1) (Figure 3C) agrees with the hydrogen bonding interaction connecting this carbonyl to the thiol of Cys145 (Figure 3F).

It is likely that hydrophobic fragments of the ligands interact with the side chain of Ala46. Similarly, the emergence of the amidic NH of Gln192 as significant positive contact in SB-1 combined with agreement among docked potent training compounds on placing their central benzene rings near to this contact suggested placing an Hbic feature onto these benzene ligand fragments. Clearly, these rings are involved in hydrophobic interaction with the nearby thiol of Cys145 instead of \u03c0-stacking (as the nearest aromatic amino acid residue is His41 at about 4.5 \u01fa away). This explains our decision to place Hbic feature onto this region of the ligands (ie, rather than RingArom feature).Likewise, the appearance of His166 and HOH241 as positive contact points combined with agreement among potent hits to position their benzotriazoles close by suggested placing a hydrophobic aromatic (HbicArom) feature onto these benzotriazole moieties (Figure 4E). The reason for adding an HbicArom feature onto these rings instead of a vectored RingArom feature is because the benzotriazoles, although docked near to the imidazole of His166, it did not exhibit typical \u03c0-stacking alignment with this residue. In contrast, the appearance of positive contacts at His41 and ASP190 combined with a consensus among docked potent inhibitors to project their thiophene rings close to the nearby imidazole of His41 suggests a mutual \u03c0-stacking interaction involving the electron-rich ligands' thiophenes and electron-deficient His41 imidazole.

The success criterion is the ability of the docking run to align potent ligands in a way that would allow them to form contacts unattainable by low-potency ligands. dbCICA can be considered a 3D QSAR that correlates ligands' affinities to their contacts with certain binding site spots by using GFA and MLR.", "latex": null, "type": "figure"}, "FIGREF18": {"text": "3CL pro inhibitors revealed structural features needed for potent 3CL pro enzyme inhibitors design.
