To reduce person to person transmission, government of India initiated a nationwide lockdown on 25th March 2020. Learning from worldwide experience, the Indian health care system needs to be prepared for a surge in COVID-19 patients. Reperfusion for acute myocardial infarction (AMI) by primary percutaneous coronary intervention (PPCI) or Thrombolysis, is evidence-based, time-critical, life-saving intervention that should not be neglected in the COVID-19 era. Although rare, COVID-19, like influenza, may trigger an AMI by multiple pathways2. Hence this document is intended to provide strategies for triage and management of patients with AMI in the time of COVID-19.",

Fomites also play a role in transmission with the virus remaining viable in cardboard for 24 hours, on plastic and steel for 3 days. The virus can be detected in faeces and blood although this does not seem to be an important mechanism for spread of the virus4, 5, 6.3.The infectivity of COVID-19 is greater than that of the usual influenza virus, with an estimated R\n0 value (the basic reproduction number, representing viral infectivity) of 2.2 7.

COVID-19 patients with pre-existing cardiovascular disease (CVD) have an increased risk of severe disease and death (case fatality rates of 6% among hypertensives, 7.3% among diabetics and 10.5% with CVD)9. Depending upon population studied prevalence of cardiovascular disease ranges from 5-15%9, 10, 11, 12.2.Majority of cardiovascular events in patients with COVID -19 infection are the result of severe inflammatory and hemodynamic changes in patients with extensive respiratory involvement. This produces supply-demand mismatch myocardial ischemia due to hypoxia/hemodynamic instability. These are generally seen in the second week of the illness and may manifest with ECG changes and troponin elevation9, 10, 11, 12, 13.3.Some patients can present as myocarditis including a severe fulminant myocarditis due to cytokine storm with regional ST elevation, marked troponin release and ventricular dysfunction14.4.Type I myocardial ischemia due to atherosclerotic plaque instability resulting from direct vascular infection is uncommon.5.Many patients can present with chest pain, shortness of breath and palpitations secondary to pulmonary involvement.6.Thus, the range of cardiovascular manifestations of COVID-19 includea.Acute cardiac injury (defined as \u201cTroponin elevations\u201d) is common. Type I acute coronary syndrome (ACS) is uncommon.b.Myocarditis and cardiomyopathy including a severe fulminant form due to cytokine storm syndrome with elevations in NT-pro-BNP, troponin and IL-6 levelsc.Arrhythmia occurred in 16.7% of patients in a case series from China12\nd.Venous thromboembolism probably due to vascular inflammation and immobilization11\n,\n15.\n\n",

For instance, the risk-benefit ratio of primary PCI may be limited in patients with severe pneumonia.3.Patients presenting with Acute MI could be classified into 3 groups (Fig 1\n)a.\nConfirmed COVID-19 patient (Group A): This would include patients with a positive COVID 19 test result. Currently, such patients are rare in the community in India, but their numbers may grow with increased testing and community spread.b.\nSuspected COVID-19 patient (Group B): At the present stage in the epidemic this would include patients who have a h/o international travel or are close contacts of a definite COVID-19 patient and has symptoms of fever and/or some respiratory symptoms. However, when the epidemic is in the community stage, many patients will belong to this group even if they have no respiratory symptoms. Rapid testing will permit quick classification of these patients.c.Patient with Low clinical probability of being a COVID-19 patient/Confirmed non-COVID-19 patient (Group C): This would include a patient with no symptoms suggestive of influenza and no history of travel/contact with a COVID-19 patient or a patient whose COVID 19 test is negative.\n4.Due to non-availability of rapid testing, for decisions regarding management of AMI, it would be best to club Groups A and B together.5.\nFor the confirmed or suspected COVID-19 patient with ST elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) presenting within 12 hours, primary PCI should be preferred if performed with the necessary precautions and preparedness (see below). Thrombolysis is the prudent option as PCI may not be feasible due to the prevailing logistic problems in performing timely PCI, especially if the patient is hemodynamically stable18\n,\n19. Clinical judgement is important in diagnosing myocardial infarction as myocarditis may masquerade as myocardial infarction. If the patient is hemodynamically unstable, primary PCI would be an ideal option, especially if the COVID-19 pneumonia (respiratory status) is assessed as mild to moderate. However, if primary PCI may not be feasible due to the prevailing logistic problems, thrombolysis should still be tried even if patient is unstable with a plan for rescue PCI19.6.PCI would also be a desirable option for failed thrombolysis (Rescue PCI) or for a delayed presentation beyond 12 hours, especially if pneumonia is mild to moderate and appropriate PPE is available.7.Primary PCI should be preferably performed in an isolated catheterization laboratory with minimum trained personnel to reduce nosocomial spread. It should not be performed if adequate PPE are not available.\n8.For the Group C patients of STEMI, since personnel protection is not in jeopardy, one could resort to the pre-COVID 19 strategy as per previous CSI position statement25. However, the reperfusion strategy should be based not only on prevailing logistics and hospital preparedness but also on strategies to reduce nosocomial infection.9.\nFor the stable NSTEMI patient, coronary angiography and or PCI should be deferred until a COVID-19 negative test has been obtained.10.For the confirmed or suspected COVID-19 patient, thrombolysis should be given in an isolation room/area within the designated ICCU as per institutional protocol.11.In small towns and villages and at the spokes in a hub and spoke model of STEMI care, thrombolysis should be the preferred reperfusion strategy. Inter-institutional transfers should be discouraged, and the index facility should be encouraged to stabilize the patient using teleconsultation (see Fig 1).\n",

It is reported that 41.3% of the COVID-19 transmission is presumably hospital-related in Wuhan, China12.2.While treating a confirmed or suspected COVID-19 patient, appropriate PPE is paramount as per national/international advisories. This should include caps, surgical masks, N-95 respirator masks, face shields, eye protection goggles, gowns, gloves and shoe covers. The entire team should review and practise donning and doffing of PPE. Assistance of infection-control trainers should be taken.3.It is preferable to intubate patients with borderline respiratory status before wheeling these patients into the cardiac catheterization laboratory (CCL).4.Echocardiogram should be ordered only if it contributes to decision-making.5.All personal equipment including stethoscopes and cellphones have to be decontaminated.6.There should be minimal equipment in the CCL during PCI procedure as these will require decontamination after the procedure in a COVID-19 positive patient.7.As most CCLs are not negative-pressurized rooms, they will need cleaning after procedures on a patient with suspected or confirmed COVID-19 which may prolong turnaround time of the CCL. When there are multiple CCLs in the hospital it would be useful to use a dedicated isolated CCL for such procedures. It will be useful to employ pragmatic approaches that limit both time of exposure as well as the number of health care personnel involved in the care of COVID-19 patients. This may include prescribing once daily medications where feasible, limiting physical examination to essential components only, and providing teleconsultation on follow up26.8.The cardiovascular care team professionals maybe called to be on the front line of the COVID-19 response and therefore should design teams for care of these patients. Health care workers over age 60 years should preferably not be in the front line.9.Collaborate with others: administrators, intensivists, emergency medicine and infectious disease specialists\n",
