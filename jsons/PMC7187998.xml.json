            "text": "Early in December 2019, an outbreak of an acute respiratory disease of unknown etiology was detected in Wuhan, Hubei Province of China [1,2]. A novel beta coronavirus was isolated, initially called the 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCov) by the World Health Organization (WHO) [3]. The disease was named as coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) by WHO on 11 February 2020, the same day the Coronavirus Study Group renamed the virus to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) [3]. The first case in the United States (US) was diagnosed at an urgent care clinic in Snohomish County, Washington, on 19 January 2020 [4]. The disease has since spread rapidly, prompting the WHO to declare COVID-19 a pandemic on 11 March 2020 [3]. As of 29 March, there are now over 638,000 confirmed cases worldwide in 203 countries or territories, with more than 30,000 deaths and a mortality of 4.7% [3]. SARS-CoV-2 is similar to the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) of 2002 and the middle east respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) of 2012 which had 10% and 35% mortalities, respectively [1]. Fever, cough, fatigue, sputum expectoration and shortness of breath have been noted to be the most common symptoms, and the disease can present as mild or severe based on the underlying condition of the host [1,2,5]. The diagnosis and management of COVID-19 is still evolving. Here we present a 49-year-old male patient with comorbid conditions and presenting with multifocal COVID-19 pneumonia who we successfully treated with hydroxychloroquine.",

The patient is a priest by profession and started having symptoms after Mass five days ago. Initially, the patient noticed generalized tiredness, and then developed a cough, which was initially dry but later became productive of white sputum. The next day, the patient developed a non-remitting fever, as high as 101\u00b0F. He visited his primary medical doctor (PMD) the same day and upon evaluation was presumptively diagnosed with influenza and prescribed oseltamivir (Tamiflu) and acetaminophen. Fever as high 102.5\u00b0F persisted with associated chills and severe muscle aches. Four days later, the patient experienced shortness of breath during prolonged coughing episodes. He contacted his PMD again and was prescribed doxycycline along with an as-needed albuterol inhaler. However, with continuing high fever, severe weakness and shortness of breath, he presented to the emergency department via emergency medical services ambulance for evaluation.",

High-flow nasal cannula (HFNC) support was provided, initially starting at 40 L/min flow and 100% supplemental oxygen. Over the next few days, HFNC was titrated down to 35 L/min flow and 40% supplemental oxygen. After the SARS-CoV-2 test came back positive, on the recommendations of pulmonary medicine and infectious disease teams we started oral hydroxychloroquine (Plaquenil) 200 mg twice daily for five days and discontinued azithromycin and ceftriaxone. After the third day on hydroxychloroquine, his fever has subsided and the patient started feeling better. As the patient continues to improve, HFNC continues to be downtitrated and further disposition is being planned.",

The incubation period varies from one to fourteen days with a median of three to seven days [2]. COVID-19 presentation may vary from a mild illness to pneumonia and even septic shock with acute respiratory distress syndrome [1,2,5,7]. Cytokine storm due to excessive elaboration of tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-\u03b1) and interleukins (IL)-2, IL-6, IL-7, and IL-10 has been seen [1,2]. It commonly presents with fever (88%), cough (67.8%), fatigue (38.1%), sputum production (33.4%), dyspnea (18.6%), sore throat (13.9%), headache (13.6%) and sometimes even with vomiting (5%) and diarrhea (3.8%) [2]. Lymphopenia is common [1,2]. CT of the thorax commonly reveals bilateral multilobar ground-glass opacities with peripheral or posterior distribution, with consolidation seen more in the elderly [5,8]. The radiological features peak around the 10th to 11th day of illness. Septal thickening, bronchiectasis, pleural thickening, subpleural involvement and cavitation are less common. Pleural and pericardial effusions are rare [8].",

In the absence of proven antivirals against SARS-CoV-2, treatment is generally symptomatic along with respiratory support. In patients with refractory hypoxemia, WHO has recommended the use of extra corporeal membrane oxygenation. Many drug trials are underway and a few have been promising [2,3,7,9]. The first US patient was successfully treated with remdesivir [4]. Hydroxychloroquine has been shown to alter the pH of the cell membrane, thus interfering with viral fusion [2,10]. It also inhibits viral nucleic acid replication, glycosylation of viral proteins, viral assembly and release [10]. Furthermore, it has immunomodulatory effects, suppressing TNF-\u03b1 and IL-6 [2,10].",
