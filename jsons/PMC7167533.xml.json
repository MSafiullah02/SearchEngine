For WAC, the most painful consequence is the postponement of WAC-9 (see the announcement by the WAC President) that was supposed to be held in Prague, 5\u201310 July 2020.",

Nobody knows how the pandemic is going to behave in the rest of this year; however, some epidemiologists are warning that there may be an autumn recurrence of the virus. So we hope that July 2021 may be the time in which we either have the virus globally under control and/or have the vaccine and medication available. Then we could organize the meeting without stress and fear and make our global meeting even more successful.",

This spread is usually connected with the migration of the Yamnaya Culture population westwards. These earliest cases of plague lacked a gene called ymt that helps the bacterium Yersinia pestis to colonize guts of fleas (often travelling on rodents) transmitting bacteria to humans. The later example comes from Early Iron Age Armenia 1048\u2013855 BC, from the cemetery at Kapan, where the bacterium Yersinia pestis already harbouring the ytm was identified together with another mutation linked to flea-aided transmission. Since then, the plague became a fast spreading disease of civilization, such as in the case of the Medieval Bubonic plague (Callaway 2015). The earliest historical evidence of plague comes from 5th century BC Athens, the city-state that was at the time engaged in the Peloponnese War. So the mobility of humans and rodents and social misbalance, such as wartime, were the worst accelerators of pandemics.",

The death toll was estimated to have been anywhere from 17 million to 50 million or perhaps even more. The disease originated probably in Northern China and spread with the movement of soldiers and trade globally. In Europe and North America, it badly affected countries involved in the World War. Unlike Covid-19, it mainly killed young people in reproductive age. It came in three waves (see Fig. 1). The first wave started in late 1917 and early 1918. The second wave of the 1918 pandemic was much deadlier than the first. The first wave had resembled typical flu epidemics; those most at risk were the sick and elderly, while younger, healthier people recovered easily. By August, when the second wave began in France, Sierra Leone, and the USA the virus had mutated to a much deadlier form. October 1918 was the deadliest month of the whole pandemic. The third wave came in February/March 1919 (Fig. 1).",
