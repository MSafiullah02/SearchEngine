            "text": "Annually, 5.8 million veal calves are fattened in Europe (Sans and De Fontguyon, 2009). With 1.6 million fattened veal calves per year, the Netherlands has one of the largest veal industries in Europe (Brscic et al., 2011; Sans and De Fontguyon, 2009). In this industry, surplus calves mostly born in dairy herds throughout Europe, are collected, fattened and eventually slaughtered. Given the fact that veal calves account for more than one-third of the total cattle population in the Netherlands, it is important to monitor their health. On population level, cattle health is monitored on a quarterly basis through the national cattle health surveillance system (CHSS) (Santman-Berends et al., 2016). One of the key-monitoring indicators in this system is mortality rate. Between 2009 and the end of 2012 a gradual increase in mortality rate of veal calves was observed in the CHSS. In the corresponding period, the policy with regard to antimicrobial use was altered, resulting in reduced possibilities to apply antibiotics in livestock followed by a tremendous decrease (>50%) in antimicrobial usage (SDa, 2014). It was hypothesized that this decrease in antibiotic use was associated with the increased mortality rate. Nevertheless, other potential causes were identified such as increased imports of calves persistently infected with BVDV, increased herd sizes and factors related to the herd from which the calves originated. Yet, even with all these potential conditions that might have led to an increased mortality in veal herds, the large between herd variation in veal calf mortality provided potential for improvement in herds with high mortality rates.",

            "text": "To enable the implementation of risk mitigating measures for veal calf mortality, more information was needed on risk factors associated with veal calf mortality. Although it is well known that diarrhoea and respiratory infections are the main causes of mortality among veal calves (Pardon et al., 2012; Hoet et al., 2003; Webster, 1990), the risk factors associated with occurrence of these disorders are ambiguous. Various studies describe pathogens as the cause of these problems such as Rotavirus, Coronavirus, BVDV and Cryptosporidium (Hoet et al., 2003; Bendali et al., 1999), but lack to describe management factors on which the farmer can intervene. There have been studies that described factors associated to either diarrhoea, respiratory syndromes or both. These factors include colostrum intake (Lorenz, 2006; Perez et al., 1990), BVDV (Pardon et al., 2013 and Pardon et al., 2012), weight at arrival in the veal herd (Brscic et al., 2012), housing (Brscic et al., 2012; Lorenz, 2006) and type and amount of feed (Brscic et al., 2012). Nevertheless, it is unknown to which extent these risk factors for diarrhoea and respiratory syndromes are associated to veal calf mortality and whether these results are applicable to the white veal industry in the Netherlands. Additionally, this information does not provide insight in the combination of factors related to both the veal herd and the herd of origin that are associated to mortality.",

First, all potential risk factors were univariably pre-screened and parameters which were significantly associated with the mortality rate (P-value < 0.05) entered the multivariable model. The final multivariable model was selected using a forward selection and elimination method in which every round the variable with the lowest P-value was added until all variables in the model were significantly (P-value<0.05) associated with the outcome and adding additional variables did not result in a significant improvement of the model (non-significant in the likelihood ratio test). Significance of relevant two-and three-way interaction terms and the amount of variance that was explained by the final multivariable model were assessed. Additionally, confounding was checked by evaluating the change in model coefficients after introduction of possible confounders (e.g. age at arrival as possible confounder for body weight at arrival). If the introduction of the confounder resulted in a substantial (>25%) change in coefficients of significantly associated variables, the variable was retained.

Additionally, we found that the gradual increase in mortality rate that was observed in the period before the initiation of this study, stabilized during the study period.

We checked whether the association between mortality and body weight would change when we corrected for age at arrival as confounder, but no change in association was observed. Our results were in agreement with the results of Brscic et al. (2012), who found that a lower weight at arrival was associated with an increased risk to develop respiratory infections, which is an important cause for mortality. Additionally, both Winder et al. (2016) and Brickell et al. (2009) found that a lower body weight at arrival in the veal herds was associated with an increased risk to die in the first six months. Veal calves of the Belgian Blue breed had a lower mortality risk than other breeds of calves in our study. Even though, these calves might have a higher body weight at arrival, the lower mortality risk was also observed when we corrected for weight at arrival as confounding factor. It was hypothesised that the lower mortality rate was due to the fact that Belgian Blue calves are very valuable resulting in application of additional care to maximise the probability of survival. This hypothesis was further supported by the fact that the veal cooperations stated that they only select specific farmers for fattening Belgian Blue calves.",

This finding was in accordance with previous studies of Pardon et al. (2012) and Gorden and Plummer (2010), who found that purchase resulted in a higher risk for respiratory infections during the fattening period, which consequentially may result in a higher mortality risk. The Kaplan-Meijer survival curve showed that the detrimental effect of purchase i.e. not having an all-in/all-out system, occurred from day 40 after arrival in the veal herd and onwards (results not presented). Generally, after this moment a new production round of calves enter the veal farm without all-in/all-out system resulting in an increased risk of introduction of infections and increasing the mortality risk. The significant association between veal calf mortality and number of calves in the specific production cycle that was found in this study was incoherent as both the smallest and largest veal herds were protective factors, whereas the size groups in between had a higher risk. Moreover, the association between veal calf mortality and the information from the critical control points was ambiguous. The answers could either be yes the farm complies with the demand, no the farm does not comply or not applicable.

This finding is supported by earlier research of Jarrige et al. (2017) and B\u00e4hler et al. (2012), who both found that antibiotic treatment was associated with higher mortality. In the Netherlands, prophylactic use of antibiotics is forbidden and a higher use of antibiotics is thus an indication for increased health problems that result in a higher mortality rate. Moreover, a higher use of antibiotics might result in antibiotic resistance in time, which can deteriorate the possibility to treat infections and thus increase mortality (Hoet et al., 2003; Bos et al., 2012).

Previous study already stressed the importance to provide sufficient amount of feed, especially when diarrhoea problems occur (Lorenz, 2006). In our study we were only able to distinguish concentrates and roughage and were unable to specify the feed on a more detailed level. Based on previous studies, not only the amount of feed but also the specific feed that is administered is indicated to be associated to health problems and mortality (Webb et al., 2013; Berends et al., 2012; Brscic et al., 2011).

This approach offered additional insight compared to research that only evaluated risk factors during the fattening period. Nevertheless, there was still one factor missing in our study of which it is known that it influences health of veal calves, namely transport to the veal herd. We evaluated the possibilities to include such information, but at the time of the study, data of the transporter was not yet centrally registered. Nevertheless, given the strict regulations regarding transport on both European and national level (EC, 2004; IKB, 2008), we assumed that the variation in quality of transport was limited and thus that transported played a minor role compared to factors related to management in the herd of origin and the subsequent veal herd.",

However, this was impossible due to a lack of background information from calves that were imported (in this study 42% of the veal calves). Additionally, while most of the information of the veal calves during the fattening period were available at the level of the production cycle, the information of the herd of origin (if born in the Netherlands) was available on individual level. This enabled more detailed evaluation of risk factors for veal calf mortality associated with the origin of the calves. For selection of the most appropriate model, both multilevel Poisson regression and negative binomial regression models were evaluated. Both regression models resulted in the same final model and because the model with the log-linear distribution showed the best fit to the data, it was decided to present those results in this paper.",

The advantage of this type of data is the possibility to include a large number of observations resulting in a high analytical power. However, a drawback is that we could not include factors that are hypothesized to be important but that were not available from central databases. Such factors include for example quality and amount of colostrum received by the calves (Perez et al., 1990; Lorenz, 2006; Osorio and Drackley, 2010), housing (Lorenz, 2006; Brscic et al., 2012) and climate in the barn (Lorenz et al., 2011; B\u00e4hler et al., 2012).
