            "text": "Zika virus (ZIKV) remains a global health concern. Originally discovered in Africa in 1947 [1], ZIKV became an epidemic 60 years later, reaching several tropical regions of the Americas, Africa and Asia. Despite causing mild symptoms such as fever, rashes and conjunctivitis, the major concern about ZIKV regards the severe neurological disorders, such as microcephaly, craniofacial disproportion, spasticity, seizures, irritability and other brainstem dysfunctions 2, 3. In 2016, infant head computed tomographic findings, of subjects infected during pregnancy, confirmed the causal relationship between microcephaly and Zika infection [3]. A recent study by Yuan and co-workers demonstrated that a single mutation (S139N) in the pre-membrane (prM) structural protein increased ZIKV infectivity in neural progenitor cells (NPCs), making the virus more virulent [4]. This mutation arose in the French Polynesia strain, and it has contributed to the increased incidence of microcephaly and higher mortality in neonates, according to experimental assays [4]. The disorders attributed to Zika infection mainly affect infants but can also impact adults. There have been ZIKV-related cases of Guillain\u2013Barr\u00e9 syndrome [5], myelitis [6], uveitis [7] and meningoencephalitis [8] reported in adults.",

Belonging to the genus Flavivirus of the Flaviviridae family [10], ZIKV carries a positive-sense single-stranded RNA genome, encoding a large polyprotein, which after processing by host and viral proteases yields three structural and seven nonstructural (NS) proteins (Fig. 1b). Envelope protein (E), membrane protein (M), which is expressed as prM, the precursor to M, and capsid (C) are the structural proteins, which form the virion. The NS proteins (NS1, NS2A, NS2B, NS3, NS4A, NS4B, NS5) are essential for genomic replication and modulation of host immunity [10] (Fig. 1b). Figure 1c presents an overview of the replication process of ZIKV in the infected cell, showing the marked steps of the replication, which can be inhibited by the compounds discussed below in this review. We also present a special section (see supplementary material online: viral entry and replication mechanisms).",

Since late March 2016, ZIKV protein structures have been determined mostly by X-ray crystallography and have been made available in databases such as the Protein Data Bank (PDB) [14]: NS1, NS2B\u2013NS3 protease, NS3 helicase, NS5 methyltransferase, NS5 polymerase, NS5 full-protein and envelope glycoprotein (Table 1\n).

Figure 2\nshows some ZIKV protein 3D structures and their ligand and or substrate binding pockets. The substrate binding pocket of ZIKV NS2B/NS3 protease (NS2B residues: S81, D83, K54 and NS3pro residues: D75, H51, S135, G133, G151, D129, Y161) (Fig. 2a) was based on the co-crystallized compound 1H-1,3-benzodiazol-1-ylmethanol [15] and a boronate inhibitor [16], which bind to a similar pocket. NS3 helicase presents two binding sites, one encompasses the RNA strand and the other is where the ATP molecule binds (Fig. 2b) [17]. The full-length NS5 protein contains two domains, representing distinct targets: the NS5 methyltransferase and NS5 polymerase [18]. The NS5 polymerase domain has three adjacent binding sites: the active site, the RNA site and the NTP channel [18] (Fig. 2c). The NS5 methyltransferase domain has two substrates: SAM, a co-substrate involved in methyl group transfer, and GTP, a substrate for RNA synthesis [18]. Consequently, the accessibility of these two substrates, together with a conserved catalytic tetrad of Lys61, Asp146, Lys182, Glu218, forms the active site [18] (Fig. 2d). ZIKV envelope protein is composed of three distinct domains: the \u03b2-barrel-shaped domain (DI), the finger-like domain (DII) and the immunoglobulin-like domain (DIII) (Fig. 2e). Domain II is responsible for the dimerization [19]. A binding site between DI and DIII, enclosing a hydrophobic cavity around a flexible linker, was computationally predicted [20]. The protein\u2013protein binding pocket is composed of residues from DI and DIII (Fig. 2e). The crystallographic structure of the capsid protein was recently solved 21, 22. It contains four \u03b1 helices in each monomer, and it forms a dimer (Fig. 2f). We predicted the capsid pocket druggability using the PockDrug server [23], which identified three pockets: pocket 1 (between \u03b12 and \u03b13 helices), pocket 2 (between N-terminal and \u03b11 helix of the monomers) and pocket 3 (between \u03b14 helices of the monomers).",

Recently, Carneiro and co-workers, through in vitro assays (in Vero E6 cells), showed that EGCG also inhibited the entry of ZIKV into the host cell by at least 1 log (>90%) at higher concentrations (>100 \u03bcM). The authors proposed that the inhibition is probably related to the direct interaction of EGCG with the lipid envelope, leading to a subsequent destruction of the virus particle [44]. Conversely, EGCG contains the catechol group, which is a well-known PAIN substructure (pan-assay interference compound) that promiscuously or nonspecifically inhibits many different targets 45, 46, 47.",

Using MD simulations, they showed that EGCG blocks the major conformational change during the membrane fusion process [20]. Another natural product, nanchangmycin, from Streptomyces nanchangensis, proved to be a potent inhibitor of ZIKV in HTS assays using human cells [48], with an IC50 0.1 \u03bcM (Fig. 3\na). To determine whether nanchangmycin was blocking a pre- or post-entry step in the viral lifecycle, the authors treated cells with the drug and removed the drug 4 h post-infection (hpi) and monitored the level of infection (24 h later). Nanchangmycin inhibited infection, which suggests that it blocks an early step in the viral lifecycle [48]. Unfortunately, nanchangmycin contains a reactive Michael acceptor, which is also a well-known PAINS substructure [49]. Fernando and co-workers, through homology modeling, docking and MD simulation approaches, predicted two compounds: ZINC33683341 and ZINC49605556, could inhibit ZIKV E protein. These two small molecules preferentially bind to the glycan-binding domain, related to the virulence of the virus. The antiviral activity of ZINC33683341 was confirmed by cell culture assay (in Vero cells) [50].",

The compound ST-148 has been shown to interact with the capsid protein and was identified as a potent inhibitor of all four serotypes of DENV in vitro and in vivo, reducing viremia and viral load in vital organs [24]. Characterization of the mode-of-action of ST-148 showed that it directly targeted the capsid protein and presented bimodal antiviral activity affecting assembly and/or release and entry of infectious DENV particles [51]. Another example of a flaviviral capsid inhibitor is the biotinylated derivative of compound SL209, which inhibited HCV infection, blocking the core dimerization with an IC50 of 2.80 \u03bcM [52]. Both studies support the hypothesis that inhibitors of viral capsid formation might constitute a new class of antiviral agents, and therefore could also be applicable to ZIKV.",

In this way, many natural products have been tested against NS2B\u2013NS3 protease, and some of them were able to inhibit ZIKV protease activity. In one study, 22 compounds were tested at (the relatively high concentration of) 100 \u03bcM, and seven compounds were able to inhibit >50% of the protease activity [57]. The IC50s of these compounds were determined and ranged from 22 to 112 \u03bcM [57]. In another study, five flavonoids and one natural phenol were tested [58]. The flavonoids were myricetin (IC50\n = 1.3 \u03bcM), quercetin (IC50\n = 2.4 \u03bcM), luteolin (IC50\n = 2.7 \u03bcM), isorhamnetin (IC50\n = 15.5 \u03bcM), apigenin (IC50\n = 56.3 \u03bcM) and the natural phenol curcumin (IC50\n = 3.5 \u03bcM). These polyphenols inhibit the enzyme in a noncompetitive mode, which means that they could perhaps be allosteric inhibitors. Docking studies showed that the compounds are predicted to bind to a pocket on the back of the active site of ZIKV NS2B\u2013NS3 [58]. However, curcumin, quercetin and other flavonoids have been shown to be promiscuous inhibitors, for example via colloidal aggregation 59, 60, 61; curcumin also contains reactive Michael acceptors and quercetin has a catechol, a well-known PAINS substructure, which might make these compounds less favorable.",

Then, a library of FDA-approved drugs and investigational drugs (2816 drugs) was screened using this assay, and 23 compounds produced an IC50 below 15 \u03bcM, of which 12 were considered PAINS. The remaining 11 compounds were tested for their protease inhibition activities, and three could inhibit with IC50 values ranging from 1.1 to 15.9 \u03bcM. The three compounds were tested against ZIKV, DENV, WNV, JEV and YFV. They presented inhibitory activity close to the nanomolar level, whereas temoporfin (Fig. 3b) displayed an EC50 (half-maximal effective concentration) for all flaviviruses tested at low nanomolar concentrations. The therapeutic indices for all three compounds were high, because their CC50 (concentration that inhibits 50% of mammalian cell proliferation) was considerably higher than their EC50. The compounds were also able to inhibit ZIKV replication in placental epithelial and neuronal cells and to inhibit viral polyprotein cleavage. Temoporfin was tested in a viremia mouse model and a lethal mouse model and was able to inhibit viremia and protect 83% of the mice; the mice that survived did not present any signs of neurological disorder [62]. A similar study was done using structure-based virtual screening (VS) of 8277 compounds from the DrugBank database, and the top 100 candidates were identified [63]. From these, eight clinically approved compounds belonging to different drug classes were selected for further validation studies. From the eight selected compounds, five were validated as NS2B\u2013NS3 protease inhibitors. Then, the compounds novobiocin, lopinavir, ritonavir and rifampicin which had favorable safety profiles and could be administrated to pregnant women were selected for phenotypic screening. Two compounds were able to inhibit ZIKV replication. Because the compound novobiocin had a higher selectivity index, it was tested in vivo. Dexamethasone immunosuppressed mice with disseminated ZIKV infection and novobiocin treatment had a significantly higher survival rate, lower mean blood and tissue viral loads, as well as less severe histopathological changes than untreated controls [63].",

Based upon a literature review, 11 drugs were selected to be tested in ZIKV if they could match the following criteria: (i) known toxicity profile in humans and pregnancy; (ii) known broad-spectrum antiviral activity; (iii) known antiviral activity against flavivirus or another RNA virus; (iv) coverage of a broad range of indications and drug classes. Bromocriptine presented inhibitory activity in a cytopathic-effect inhibition assay, virus-yield-reduction assay and plaque-yield-reduction assay. The drug was predicted to bind to NS2B\u2013NS3 protease through molecular docking studies and also presented inhibition of the proteolytic activity of the enzyme [64]. Twenty-seven HCV NS3\u2013NS4A protease inhibitors were tested in ZIKV NS2B\u2013NS3; ten presented IC50 values below 50 \u03bcM. The best two inhibitors were tested to determine their inhibition type, and they presented competitive inhibition profiles, meaning that they might bind at the active site [65]. Aprotinin, a 58 amino acid bovine trypsin inhibitor, previously tested against WNV protease, also inhibits ZIKV protease (IC50\n = 70 nM), and molecular modeling studies predicted that the inhibitor probably blocks the interactions of NS3 and NS2B [66]. By contrast, in our analysis of crystal structures of WNV protease with bovine pancreatic trypsin inhibitor (PDB ID 2IJO) [67] and of DENV protease bound to aprotinin (PDB ID 3U1J) [68], these types of inhibitors bind to and occlude the substrate site. A focused library of protease inhibitors that bind to WNV exosites was tested, and \u223c700 structurally similar compounds were screened [66]. The best inhibitors were NSC157058 (IC50\n = 0.82 \u03bcM) (Fig. 3b), NSC86314 (IC50\n = 0.97 \u03bcM) and NSC716903 (IC50\n = 1.12 \u03bcM). They were also tested against furin, a human serine protease with a cleavage sequence preference similar to those of flaviviral proteases, and they showed no effect at 100 \u03bcM. These compounds decreased the viral yield in neuronal precursor cells. The best inhibitor, NSC157058, was tested using an in vivo mouse model and decreased the viremia by tenfold; unfortunately, it has a very unfavorable pharmacokinetics profile [66].",

Although we have recently had some promising preliminary results in our own virtual screens against ZIKV NS3h, developing drugs that target ZIKV NS3h could involve significant hurdles. For instance, the accessible pocket(s) within the active site of the NS3h\u2013RNA complex is relatively shallow, and previous efforts to discover specific inhibitors of DENV NS3h have been challenging [71]. A potential strategy to deal with these issues could involve targeting other sites of ZIKV NS3h, such as the putative allosteric site that we discovered in our MD simulations [72]. We are currently performing new VS against snapshots of ZIKV NS3h that we generated with MD to test this strategy. Other challenges are related to: (i) the development of potent inhibitors, as a result of the lack of the specific amino acid interaction with ATP nucleobase or ribose ring; and (ii) the discovery of specific inhibitors, because the host helicase is within the same SF2 superfamily as NS3h [71].",

These conformations and strategies are guiding new VS experiments in the OpenZika project, which is being performed on IBM\u2019s World Community Grid (WCG).

The biological function of this protein is not fully established, but it is part of the replication complex (RC), and some studies have demonstrated that NS4B induces the formation of a membrane web that forms a scaffold for the formation of the RC [81]. NS4B also interacts with other viral proteins, such as NS1, NS2B, NS3 and NS4A 33, 82, 83, 84. For those reasons, NS4B is a good target to develop inhibitors. Unfortunately, the search for NS4B inhibitors faces many challenges, such as poor pharmaceutical properties of the inhibitors, difficulties to find pan-flaviviral inhibitors and also a high risk of developing resistant viruses [85].",

An aminothiazole derivative (NITD-618) was identified as a specific DENV inhibitor, capable of inhibiting all four serotypes (but not closely related flaviviruses); it was identified in an HTS of 1.8 million compounds using a DENV replicon containing the luciferase gene [86]. NITD-618 faced problems with pharmacokinetics in in vivo studies because of its high lipophilicity, and medicinal chemistry attempts to overcome this issue resulted in loss of antiviral selectivity against DENV [86]. In another screen using the NIH clinical collection, a naltrindole analog (SDM25N) was found to inhibit DENV, and specific NS4B point mutations (F164L and P104L) conferred resistance against the compound, indicating that NS4B is probably the targeted protein [87]. A spiropyrazolopyridone compound was found to inhibit DENV serotypes 2 and 3 but not 1 and 4. This fact is correlated with the low identity between NS4B of flaviviruses and even between different serotypes of DENV [88]. The compound was able to suppress viremia in a mouse model of DENV serotype 2 infection. Two compounds (CCG-3394 and CCG-4088) were hits from a screen against YFV NS4B, and mutations on the K128 residue conferred resistance to YFV against both of these compounds [89].",

S-adenosyl-l-homocysteine (SAH) and the SAM analog sinefungin (Fig. 3d) presented IC50 values of 0.43 \u03bcM and 1.18 \u03bcM, respectively. The Cap analogs inhibited the enzyme with IC50 values ranging from 72 to 491 \u03bcM. The allosteric compounds presented 50% inhibition values of 24 to 221 \u03bcM [90]. The structure of ZIKV MTase with the SAM analog sinefungin was recently elucidated, and the construction of an inhibitor connecting sinefungin with a Cap analog attached by a linker was proposed, which could perhaps grant higher affinity to the protein [91]. VS using a hydrophobic site close to the SAM pocket was performed with >20 000 compounds [92]. The ten compounds with the best scores were selected for experimental screening: four were able to inhibit viral growth in concentrations below 20 \u03bcM and the best inhibitor presented an IC50 value of 4.8 \u03bcM [92].",

They started from the crystallographic structure bound to SAM and developed the analog, attaching a 4-fluorophenyl group that gave the compound the capacity to bind to a part of the RNA tunnel and to occupy the Cap methylation site [93]. Designing ZIKV-specific MTase inhibitors is a challenge, as is the case for DENV and other flaviruses, mainly owing to the selectivity of these compounds to SAM-binding or SAM-utilizing proteins present in the host cell, because of the similarity to human RNA and DNA MTases [29]. Moreover, another issue with the design of competitive MTase inhibitors is the high cellular SAM concentration [94]. Still, these issues have been overcome in the field of kinases [95], indicating that it could also be feasible for MTases [94].",

It was found to inhibit the virus-induced cytopathic effects (CPE) of several flaviviruses, including ZIKV (EC50\n = 142.9 \u03bcg/ml) [112]. A recent study tested the activity of known broad-spectrum antivirals, including ribavirin, which yielded a poor inhibition of virus-induced CPE (EC50\n > 50 \u03bcM for MR766 strain), concluding it was not a suitable candidate as a ZIKV therapeutic [113]. Other nucleoside biosynthesis inhibitors were also tested in the same study, among which were MPA (EC50\n = 0.11 \u03bcM), brequinar (EC50\n = 0.08 \u03bcM) and 6-azauridine (EC50\n = 0.98 \u03bcM). The latter two compounds inhibit dihidroorotate dehydrogenase (DHODH) and orotidylic acid (OMP) decarboxylase, respectively, which are two enzymes involved in pyrimidine biosynthesis [113]. It is important to highlight that several nucleotide biosynthesis inhibitors suppress viral growth through innate immunity [109]. In a study by Lucas-Hourani and co-workers, the authors showed that pyrimidine deprivation, using brequinar and another compound DD264, is not directly responsible for the antiviral activity of pyrimidine biosynthesis inhibitors but it rather involves the induction of a metabolic stress and the subsequent triggering of the cellular immune response [109]. Barrows and co-workers also tested MPA, which presented potent anti-ZIKV activity, inhibiting ZIKV infection in HuH-7, HeLa, JEG3, hNSC and HAEC cells [114]. Their screen also detected other nucleoside biosynthesis inhibitors, such as azathiopurine, mercaptopurine hydrate, mycophenolate mofetil (a prodrug of MPA) and thioguanine.",

Moreover, Sarkey and co-workers demonstrated that lovastatin attenuated nervous system injury in an animal model and could be used in inflammatory peripheral nerve diseases, including Guillain\u2013Barr\u00e9 syndrome, which can be a consequence of ZIKV infection [125]. Nevertheless, although it is considered safe, treatment with lovastatin showed no evidence of beneficial impact on dengue infections in a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial [126]. Mevastatin also had anti-ZIKV activity at concentrations of 1\u20135 \u03bcM, but it was not dose-responsive at concentrations above 5 \u03bcM [113]. Mevastatin is known to induce apoptosis [127], which could perhaps explain the lack of antiviral efficacy at higher concentrations.",

Examples are the ER membrane complex (EMC), \u03b1-glucosidase, cyclophilin and proteasome elements. Some inhibitors have been investigated under this context. EMC, an ensemble of nine components that are thought to assist protein folding, has been shown to be upregulated in ZIKV-infected cells. Several proteins of this complex are multi-pass membrane proteins [148]. Another key player related to protein metabolism is \u03b1-glucosidase, an ER-resident enzyme that catalyzes the removal of glucose units from N-linked oligosaccharides. This processing is crucial for the nascent glycoprotein maturation and subsequent correct folding. Glycoproteins that fail to be processed are subjected to abnormal accumulation in the ER and ER-associated degradation (ERAD), in which nascent misfolded proteins are retrotranslocated back to the cytosol, ubiquitinated and degraded by the proteasome [149]. \u03b1-Glucosidase inhibitors exhibit broad antiviral activity against multiple genera 150, 151, but celgosvir (6-O-butanoyl castanospermine) showed poor activity against ZIKV in a CPE-based assay in Vero 76 cells infected with either MR766 or PRVABC59 strains (EC50\n > 50 \u03bcM in both cases) [113].",

This increase is thought to be responsible for the inhibition of the pH-dependent fusion step of viral entry. Chloroquine was tested against ZIKV, showing activity in Vero cells (9.82 \u00b1 2.79 \u03bcM), human brain microvascular endothelial cells (14.20 \u00b1 0.18 \u03bcM) and human neural stem cells (12.36 \u00b1 2.76 \u03bcM).

Moreover, chloroquine partially reversed morphological changes induced by ZIKV in mouse neurospheres [160].

Owing to the current state of known anti-ZIKV compounds, there is probably some way to go until clinical trials of the discovered candidates are undertaken, especially when considering that some patients, including immunosuppressed and pregnant women, will have underlying medical conditions. In this regard, one strategy to overcome the risk of teratogenesis is the development of new drugs to treat Zika based on two-stage Phase II clinical trials: first-stage focusing on testing the efficacy in nonpregnant patients and the second-stage focusing on pregnant women. These will possibly reduce the overall costs of trials, facilitating their logistical set up and enhancing the safety level for the patients [170].",

Moreover, one of the frequent issues we see with many of the published screens is that they used unrealistic concentrations (e.g., 100 \u03bcM) or compounds (e.g., cytotoxic anticancer compounds) that could never be used in pregnant women. Much of the work described herein would have benefited from having experienced medicinal chemists involved to advise on the utility of compounds selected. This would also help to avoid compounds like PAINS [47], which were reported as hits from several screens. Ultimately, the recent advances in the discovery of anti-ZIKV agents, ZIKV protein structures and host target protein structures, and our understanding of the disease itself, are not only crucial to advancing the fight against ZIKV but they can also be useful for the next emerging virus outbreak to which we will have to respond. We should also heed the lessons learned from ZIKV drug discovery so we can be more successful and avoid dead-ends in future.",

(b) Virion components, highlighting the E, M and C proteins, as well as genomic RNA. ZIKV encodes a large polyprotein, which after processing yields three structural proteins (C, M and E) and seven nonstructural proteins (NS1; NS2A; NS2B; NS3 protease and helicase domains; NS4A; NS4B; NS5 methyltransferase and RNA polymerase domains), built using the VMD program [172] (http://www.ks.uiuc.edu/Research/vmd/). NS5 domains are represented separately, as two distinct targets, but NS5 methyltransferase is attached to the NS5 polymerase domain to form the full-length NS5. (c) ZIKV infectious life cycle: the virus is attached (1) and subsequently internalized (2) by receptor-mediated endocytosis. The virus is then trafficked to early endosomes, where the acidic environment induces fusion (3) between the virus and host membrane resulting in particle disassembly and genome release (4). RNA is replicated and translated into a single polyprotein, which is processed by host and virus-encoded proteins (5). Following translation, a replication complex is assembled and associated to virus-induced membranes where viral replication takes place (6). The progeny RNA (+) strands can either initiate a new translation cycle or be assembled into virions within the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) (7). The resultant immature virions are transported to the trans-Golgi where the immature virions are transformed into mature infectious particles (8) that are released by exocytosis (9). In the pink boxes are the names of the compounds that can inhibit the marked steps of the virus lifecycle.",
