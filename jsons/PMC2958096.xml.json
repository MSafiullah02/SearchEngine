CoVs are enveloped viruses with single-stranded positive-sense 30-kb RNA genomes.3, 4 The SARS-CoV and \u2018SARS-like\u2019 viruses that have since been found in bats were phylogenetically classified as CoV subgroup 2b.5 They are only distantly related to group 1 and group 2a human CoVs, which cause the common cold and other respiratory illnesses.3, 6 Nonetheless, many genomic features are shared between SARS-CoV and other CoVs, particularly in two-thirds of the genome encoding the nonstructural proteins (nsp) which are needed for genome replication and RNA processing and are thought to function in membrane-associated replicase complexes.4, 7 The structural and accessory proteins encoded by the remainder of the genome vary greatly between different CoVs.",

NMR structure determination showed that the \u2018middle domain\u2019 SUD-M forms a macrodomain fold, and biochemical experiments and NMR chemical shift mapping resulted in the identification of a putative RNA binding site on the protein surface.16 The NMR structure of SUD-M was then used in a molecular replacement approach to solve a crystal structure of SUD-NM, which contains the two domains SUD-N and SUD-M in a construct of residues 389\u2013652.17 The crystal structure was found to be a dimer of this two-domain construct, with SUD-N also forming a macrodomain fold. The linker peptide between SUD-N and SUD-M was not observed in the protein crystals. With biochemical experiments, it was further shown that SUD-NM forms complexes with G-quadruplexes.17\n",

We further present NMR data on SUD-N and SUD-NM in constructs comprising residues 387\u2013524 and 387\u2013651, respectively, which supplement the aforementioned crystal structure of SUD-NM with a description of the behavior of this protein in solution. Specifically, biochemical data and NMR experiments define the oligomerization state of SUD-NM and the interactions between the N- and M-domains in SUD-NM.

In Fig. 2a and b, SUD-M and SUD-C are superimposed independently, and it is apparent that there is a large manifold of possible orientations for the domain that was not used for the superposition, showing that the two domains do not adopt a unique orientation relative to each other. In view of this result, we repeated the last cycle of the structure calculation separately for each domain, using NOE restraints within the two individual globular domains (residues 527\u2013648 and 654\u2013720) that had been measured in intact SUD-MC. The results of these two structure calculations (Table 1) show that the two domains are individually well defined in SUD-MC.",

The linker residues 651\u2013653 that connect the two domains exhibit 15N{1H} NOE values ranging from 0.2 to 0.4, indicating significant segmental mobility, whereas the mobility of the residues within both globular domains is essentially limited to the overall molecular tumbling of the protein, with 15N{1H} NOE values of 0.7\u20130.8.

The monomeric state is clearly apparent from the NMR data, as the 2D 15N,1H HSQC spectrum (Fig. 4, red peaks) would be inconsistent with a molecular size of 60 kDa. Independently, size-exclusion chromatography showed that the protein eluted at an apparent molecular mass of 35 kDa, which fits closely with its monomeric size (Fig. 5b). Based on the similarity of the correlation peaks (Fig. 4), we conclude that the globular structures of SUD-N and SUD-M are conserved in the SUD-NM construct. Furthermore, SUD-N and SUD-M are flexibly connected with each other, as evidenced by the close similarity of the peak positions and peak shapes of the isolated domains and the SUD-NM construct (Fig. 4). Since the resonances of SUD-N have been identified as a group, but not individually assigned, the peaks of the 15N\u20131H moieties of residues 525\u2013526, which form the interdomain linker, had to be assigned by exclusion. There is one 15N\u20131H correlation peak (identified in Fig. 4b and d) that has no counterpart in the spectra of the individual domains and was therefore tentatively assigned to the linker peptide segment. This is one of about 20 peaks in SUD-NM that exhibit 15N{1H} NOE values smaller than 0.6 (Fig. S1), thus indicating that there is increased mobility in parts of SUD-N and in the linker peptide when compared to the bulk of either of the two globular domains.",

SUD-MC has a pI value that is close to neutral (calculated pI\n = 6.7) and does not enter the gel, but its (GGGA)5 complex is sufficiently stable and has enough negative charge to enter the gel and to be observed as a discrete band (Fig. 6b and e).

In contrast, SUD-MC bound only to GGGAGGGAGG (Fig. 7d and f). The different affinities of SUD-MC for GGGAGGGA (low affinity), GGGAGGGAGG (high affinity), and (GGGA)5 (low affinity) observed in buffer containing potassium chloride (Fig. 7f) further suggests that the presence of 3\u2032-terminal G residues is an important determinant of SUD-MC binding. Two oligonucleotides, GGGAGGGAGG and (GGGA)5, were tested both in saline buffer (Fig. 6a\u2013f) and in KCl buffer (Fig. 7e and f), whereby the binding of both SUD-M and SUD-MC to (GGGA)5 was found to be weaker in KCl buffer. Binding of G-rich sequences to SUD-M and SUD-MC was also inferred by smearing of the bands (Fig. 7), indicating that there was a range of RNA electrophoretic mobilities rather than a single complex with a unique mobility; we concluded that this probably manifests reversible dissociation of the complexes during electrophoresis.",

SUD-C thus shows similarity of RNA binding to SUD-M in the sense that stronger binding is observed for RNA sequences containing purine bases. No binding was apparent in EMSAs at RNA/protein ratios between 0.5:1 and 2.25:1 (data not shown), which is likely due to the fact that RNA binding to the isolated SUD-C is weaker than RNA binding to SUD-MC; a 5:1 excess of A10 over SUD-C was required to induce chemical shift perturbations comparable to those observed for SUD-MC at a 1:1 ratio.",

This is also the case for the new domain structure presented in this work, SUD-C, which has a fold that is named after the N-terminal domain of CyaY, a member of the frataxin family of metal-binding proteins involved in iron homeostasis.26, 27 Despite the structural similarity, there is only a 10% sequence identity between SUD-C and CyaY, including that only one of the eight residues believed to be involved in iron binding by CyaY is conserved in SUD-C. This makes it unlikely that SUD-C performs the same function. A search of the Protein Data Bank (PDB) with the program Dali28, 29 identified several additional structural homologues with Z-scores of \u2264 4.4 (Table S1). These include anthrax edema factor,30 which has adenylate cyclase activity, and AcsD, which is an adenylating enzyme of which SUD-C resembles the N-terminal dimerization domain.31 Similar to the comparison with CyaY, SUD-C lacks any apparent conservation of the active-site residues of these proteins; therefore, the observation that two different adenylate-binding enzymes have SUD-C-like folds does not appear to provide a new lead toward the as yet unknown SUD-C function. Among the structural homologues of SUD-C (Table S1), there are also small protein domains that perform regulatory functions for DNA-modifying enzymes. Examples are the N-terminal domain of DNA primase, which is a zinc-binding domain that is responsible for DNA binding and also regulates the activity of the catalytic domain of the enzyme,32 and double-wing motif DNA-binding proteins such as YjbR and MotA.33, 34 Although the key DNA-binding residues are in no case conserved in SUD-C, it is interesting that other proteins with SUD-C-like folds bind nucleic acids, especially when considering that nucleic acids were observed to copurify with recombinant SUD-C expressed in Escherichia coli (see Materials and Methods).",

The NMR structure determination of SUD-MC in solution further reveals that the short linker peptide segment of residues 652\u2013654 between SUD-M and SUD-C allows nearly unrestricted freedom of movement of the two domains relative to each other (Fig. 2), with no evidence for a preferred interdomain orientation detected by the methods used. Similarly, solution studies of the construct SUD-NM, for which crystal structure determination has recently been presented,17 indicate extensive freedom of motion of SUD-N and SUD-M relative to each other. SUD-NM is monomeric in solution (Fig. 5), contrasting with the observation of a dimeric form in the crystal structure.17 The observed flexible linkage of the two domains further indicates that an interdomain disulfide bond that has been reported to link SUD-N and SUD-M in the crystal structure is not present in the reducing solvent milieu used for the NMR studies. Since the eukaryotic cell cytoplasm, where the SUD is expected to be located,10, 25 also presents a reducing milieu,35 it would appear that the monomeric sulfhydryl form observed in solution, with flexibly linked SUD-N and SUD-M domains, might be closely related to the physiologically relevant form of the protein. There are no significant chemical shift perturbations that would indicate tight transient or static contacts between the two domains, and the SUD-NM 15N\u20131H correlation NMR signals have linewidths narrower than one expects for a compact globular domain with  a molecular mass of 29.6 kDa. In view of these observations, the following discussion on nucleic acid binding and on the possible physiological roles of the SUD will be based on an SUD molecular model containing three flexibly linked globular domains.",

This shows that the binding surface of SUD-C does not have the characteristics of a typical RNA binding site, since besides two positively charged residues, of which the histidine in position 658 has the largest perturbation (Fig. 8d), there are also several negatively charged amino acid side chains (Fig. 9e). In SUD-MC, the \u0394\u03b4 values of SUD-C residues at a 1:1 A10/protein ratio (Fig. 8c) are significantly increased relative to those of the isolated SUD-C. The presence of SUD-M in SUD-MC thus stabilizes SUD-C\u2013RNA interactions, indicating that the coordinated binding of the linked domains might reduce the repulsion of RNA due to the negative surface charge of SUD-C (Fig. 9d). A putative binding site on SUD-C in SUD-MC is indicated by the fact that the largest \u0394\u03b4 values were seen for H658, H695, T696, E702, G707, and V709 (Fig. 9c). Except for H658 in helix \u03b11, these residues are all in strands \u03b25, \u03b26, and \u03b27 of the \u03b2-sheet (Fig. 1), or in loops joining these strands, and the set of residues with large \u0394\u03b4 values is somewhat smaller but nonetheless clearly similar to that seen for RNA binding to the isolated SUD-C (Fig. 9e).",

It thus appears that coordinated action of the two domains in SUD-MC results in greater specificity of RNA binding by SUD-MC than by SUD-M, and may thus lead to binding interactions that are unique to SUD-MC. For example, SUD-MC binds to SARS-CoV TRS(+) (5\u2032-CUAAACGAAC-3\u2032) and to its reverse complement in the anti-genome, TRS(\u2212) (5\u2032-GUUCGUUUAG-3\u2032) (Fig. 6b). NMR chemical shift perturbations (data not shown) were larger in the presence of TRS(+) than in the presence of TRS(\u2212), and localized to the same site of SUD-M in SUD-MC that was previously identified for A10 binding (Fig. 9a). However, in contrast to A10 binding (Fig. 8a\u2013c), there was minimal contact of SUD-C with TRS. Since the isolated SUD-M did not bind either to TRS(+) or to TRS(\u2212), this shows that the SUD-C in SUD-MC modifies binding without being directly involved in the ligand interaction. Since TRS(+) and TRS(\u2212) contain six and four purine residues, respectively, the aforementioned larger shift perturbations by TRS(+) again seem to reflect the preference of SUD for purine binding. Poly-A is found at the 3\u2032-end of the viral RNA genome, and these interactions could thus indicate a role for SUD-MC in viral genome or subgenomic RNA transcription.",

            "text": "We further used NMR spectroscopy to explore the binding of SUD-M and SUD-MC to other purine RNAs, which yielded results that could only tentatively be interpreted due to line broadening and/or precipitation. Addition of (GGA)4 resulted in broadening of SUD-M resonance linewidths in SUD-MC with increasing RNA/protein ratio. Thus, at a (GGA)4/protein ratio of 0.5:1, most peaks of SUD-M were broadened beyond detection at the contour levels shown in Fig. S2, whereas those of SUD-C were nearly unaffected. For GGGAGGGAGG binding with SUD-MC, a similar pattern of line broadening was observed at a 1:1 RNA/protein ratio, and both (GGA)4 and GGGAGGGAGG caused precipitation when added to SUD-M. Eventually, chemical shift perturbations in SUD-MC and SUD-M were measurable only for (GGA)4 at a 0.2:1 RNA/protein ratio, where the binding of (GGA)4 involves the same surface residues (Fig. S2c and d) as previously observed for A10 binding (Fig. 9a). In all of these experiments, SUD-C NMR signals showed neither sizeable chemical shift perturbations nor line broadening (Fig. S2a\u2013c and e). We speculate that this indicates the formation of high-molecular-mass aggregates characterized by binding of SUD-M to RNA, with the NMR signals of the flexibly linked SUD-C only minimally affected by this process. These aggregates would involve multiple SUD-MC proteins binding via their SUD-M to the same RNA. Similar to conclusions from the data in Fig. 6, Fig. 7, Fig. 8, in this interpretation, SUD-C would again appear to regulate the specificity of SUD-MC for RNA binding without direct contacts with the ligand, which may be physiologically important in directing the protein only to certain viral or host cell RNA sequences. Alternatively, chemical exchange between free SUD-MC and a 1:1 complex with RNA in the intermediate rate regime on the chemical shift timescale could also lead to line broadening; however, in this situation, one would expect the line broadening to be limited to binding site residues rather than affecting the entire SUD-M.",

SUD-M was previously shown to bind to poly-A RNA, which might relate to a possible function in initiating negative strand synthesis by binding to poly-A tails of the viral genome.16 It has also been proposed that due to its affinity for G-quadruplexes, SUD-NM could bind to G-quadruplex-containing host cell mRNAs encoding proteins involved in cellular signaling pathways, which could lead to disruption of the host cell environment and could favor viral replication.17 When we tested (GGGA)5 binding to SUD-MC in KCl buffer, which favors the formation of G-quadruplexes, the binding was much weaker than that in saline buffer (Fig. 7), which would argue against a G-quadruplex being the actual molecular structure recognized by SUD-MC. We note, however, that several of the G-rich RNA sequences displayed multiple bands on native gels (Fig. 6, Fig. 7), which may be due to the presence of different secondary structures, suggesting that variable types of folded RNA structure could indeed be recognized or induced by the interaction with the protein. In the following, we investigate the occurrence of alternative oligopurine sequences in SARS-CoV genomes that could function as additional SUD binding sites.",

Of 25 G4 sequences (on both (+) and (\u2212) strands), eight are conserved in all known SARS-CoV strains; seven of these are in protein-coding regions, and one is in the 3\u2032-untranslated region. Of these eight conserved G4 sequences, all but one are unique to SARS-CoV, and if these sequences were indeed physiologically relevant substrates for SUD-MC, this would be consistent with the finding that SUD is unique to SARS-CoV. An additional search for the GGGAGGGAGG sequence in the SARS-CoV Tor2 genome did not result in an exact hit, but we found three nucleotide segments that differed only by one base: nt 1461\u20131470 on the (+) strand in the nsp2 coding region have the sequence 5\u2032-GGGAGGUAGG-3\u2032; nt 12723\u201312732 on the (+) strand in the nsp12 coding region have the sequence 5\u2032-GGGAGGUAGG-3\u2032; and nt 25383\u201325392 on the (\u2212) strand have the sequence 5\u2032-GGGAGUGAGG-3\u2032. The two sequences on the (+) strand are highly conserved, with nt 1461\u20131470 being found in all known SARS-CoV strains and with nt 12723\u201312732 showing only one point mutation. In contrast, the sequence on the (\u2212) strand is not highly conserved among SARS strains. These three sequences, along with the previously discussed poly-A, TRS(+), and TRS(\u2212) sequences, are all of potential interest as physiological substrates for SUD.",
