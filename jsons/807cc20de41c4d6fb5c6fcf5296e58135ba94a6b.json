The publishing of the first SARS-CoV-2 genome made a valuable source of data to study the details about its phylogeny, evolution, and interaction with the host. Protein-protein binding assays have confirmed that Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) is more likely to be the cell receptor through which the virus invades the host cell. In the present work, we provide an insight into the interaction of the viral spike Receptor Binding Domain (RBD) from different coronavirus isolates with host ACE2 protein. By calculating the",

Our result was consistent with previously reported phylogenetic analysis and corroborates the opinion that the interface segment of the spike protein RBD might be acquired by SARS-CoV-2 via a complex evolutionary process rather than a progressive accumulation of mutations. We also highlighted the relevance of Q493 and P499 amino acid residues of SARS-CoV-2 RBD for binding to human ACE2 and maintaining the stability of the interface. Moreover, we show from the structural analysis that it is unlikely for the interface residues to be the result of genetic engineering. Finally, we studied the impact of eight different variants located at the interaction surface of ACE2, on the complex formation with SARS-CoV-2 RBD. We found that none of them is likely to disrupt the interaction with the viral RBD of SARS-CoV-2.",

Recent studies have suggested that the virus binds to the ACE2 receptor 6 on the surface of the host cell using spike proteins, and explored the binary 7 interaction of these two partners [8, 23] . In this work, we focused our 8 analysis on the interface residues to get insight into four main subjects: (1) 9 The architecture of the spike protein interface and whether its evolution in 10 many isolates supports an increase in affinity toward the ACE2 receptor; 11 (2) How the affinity of SARS-COV-2-RBD and SARS-CoV-RBD toward 12 different ACE2 homologous proteins from different species is dictated by a 13 divergent interface sequences (3) ; A comparison of the interaction hotspots 14 between SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2; and finally, (4) whether any of the 15 studied ACE2 variants may show a different binding property compared to 16 the reference allele.

Clade 1 includes Rm1 isolate, Bat-SL-CoVZC45 and 98 Bat-SL-CoVZXC21. These three isolates are closely related to SARS-CoV-2 99 as revealed by the phylogenetic tree constructed from the entire genome 100 ( Figure 1A ). Clade 2 includes SARS-CoV-2, RatG13, SZ16, ZS-C, WIV16, 101 MA15, and SARS-CoV-Sino1-11 isolates ( Figure 1A ). SARS-CoV-2 and 102 RatG13 sequences are the closest to the common ancestor of this clade. 103 The exact tree topology is reproduced when we used only the RBD segment 104 corresponding to the interface residues with hACE2. This is a linear 105 sequence spanning from residue N481 to N501 in SARS-CoV-2. To investigate whether the interface of the spike protein isolate evolves 115 by increasing the affinity toward the ACE2 receptor in the final host, we 116 predicted the interaction models of the envelope anchored spike protein (SP) 117 from several clinically relevant coronavirus isolates with hACE2 receptor 118 (PDB files for the complexes are listed in Supplementary Materials 1). The 119 construction of the complex applies a comparative-based approach that uses 120 a template structure in which both partners (ligand and receptor) are closely 121 related to those in the target system respectively. In our study, we only 122 modeled the interaction of the RBD which was shown to be implicated in the 123 physical interaction with ACE2 ( Figure 2A ). The lowest sequence identity 124 of the modeled spike proteins as well as those of any of the orthologous 125 ACE2 sequences (Human, civet, bat, pig, rat, chicken and snake) do not fall 126 below 63% toward their respective templates. At such values of sequence 127 identities it is expected that the template and the target complexes share 128 the same binding mode [6] . We calculated the binding energy scores of the RBD from different virus 132 isolates interacting with hACE2 ( Figure 2b ). All three methods used 133 for the calculation are in agreement that RBDs from bat-SL-CoVZC45, 134 bat-SL-CoVZXC21 and Rm1 show the worst energy scores. While the 135 binding energy score falls in the boundary limit of the incertitude margin for 136 PRODIGY calculation (section 2, Supplementary material 2), the differences 137 in the scores calculated by FoldX and MM-GBSA are not. Therefore we 138 consider that such differences in energies compared to SARS-CoV-2 are 139 consistent between the three methods. Except for FoldX, the affinity is 140 predicted to be more favorable for RBD from SARS-CoV-2 compared to 141 SARS-CoV. However, MM-GBSA only marginally discriminates between 142 the two values. MM-GBSA allowed us to assign the contribution of each amino acid in 162 the interface with hACE2, in the binding energy score. We conducted this 163 analysis using both sequences of the SARS-CoV-2 Wuhan-Hu-1 ( Figure 3A ) 164 and the Sino1-11 SARS-CoV ( Figure 3B) isolates. Residues F486, Y489, 165 Q493, G496, T500 and N501 of SARS-CoV-2 RBD forming the hotspots of 166 the interface with hACE2 protein were investigated (we only consider values 167 > 1 or < 1 kcal/mol to ignore the effect due to the thermal fluctuation). 168 All these amino acids form three patches of interaction spread along the 169 linear interface segment ( Figure 3C ): two from the N and C termini and one 170 central. T500 establishes two hydrogen bonds using its side and main chains 171 with Y41 and N330 of hACE2. N501 forms another hydrogen bond with 172 ACE2 residue K353 buried within the interface. On the other hand, SARS-173 CoV RBD interface contains five residues ( Figure 3D ), L473, Y476, Y485, 174 T487 and T488 corresponding to the equivalent hotspot residues of RBD 175 from SARS-CoV-2 F487, Y490, G497, T501 and N502. Therefore, Q493 as 176 a hotspot amino acid is specific to SARS-CoV-2 interface. The equivalent 177 residue N480 in SARS-CoV only shows a non-significant contribution of 178 0.18 kcal/mol.",

However, we know that such a process is very complex since it 236 requires many protein-protein interactions to acquire the specific capacity 237 of infecting and replicating in the host cells [18] . Consequently, it makes 238 sense to assume that many other types of receptors or co-receptors may 239 be critical to determine the capacity of crossing the species barrier.

The use of RBD sequences, however, 251 places the virus in a clade that comprises SARS-CoV related homologs 252 including isolates from Bat and Civet. The clade swapping as seen in 253 figure 1A , seems also to occur for RaTG13 and Rm1 isolated from bat. This 254 is expected as the use of different phylogenetic markers may considerably 255 affect the topology of the tree. However, The significant divergence in 256 the interfaces segments as a key molecular element contributing to the 257 determination of the tree topology has driven our work toward studying 258 their impact on the interaction with hACE2. The binding of the spike 259 glycoprotein to ACE2 receptor requires a certain level of affinity. In the 260 case where the RBD evolves from an ancestral form closer to that of Bat-SL-261 CoVZC45 and Bat-SL-CoVZXC21, we expected a decrease of the binding 262 energy scores through the evolution process following incremental changes in 263 the RBD. In such a scenario, we presume that there are other intermediary 264 forms of coronavirus that describe such variation of the binding energy 265 score to reach a level where the pathogen can infect humans with high 266 affinity toward hACE2. On the other hand, our results show that the 267 binding energy score and the interface sequence of SARS-CoV-2 RBD are 268 closer to SARS-CoV related isolates (either from Human or other species). 269 Therefore a recombination event involving the spike protein that might 270 have occurred between SARS-CoV and an ancestral form of the current 271 SARS-CoV-2 virus might be also possible. This will allow for the virus to 272 acquire a minimum set of residues for the interaction with hACE2. The 273 recombination in the spike protein gene has been previously suggested 274 by Wei et al in their phylogenetic analysis [4] . Thereafter, incremental 275 changes in the binding interface segment will occur in order to reach a 276 better affinity toward the receptor. One of these changes may involve P499 277 residue which substitution to threonine seems to drastically destabilize the 278 interface segment and has a distant effect. Moreover, the decomposition 279 of the interaction energy showed that 5 out of 6 hotspot amino acids in 280 SARS-CoV-2 have their equivalent in SARS-CoV including N501. Contrary 281 to what Wan et al [17] have stated, the single mutation N501T does not 282 seem to enhance the affinity. Rather, the residue Q493 might be responsible 283 for such higher affinity due to a better satisfaction of the Van der Waals 284 by the longer polar side chain of asparagine. Indeed, when we made the 285 same analysis while mutating Q493 to N493, the favorable contribution 286 decreases from -2.55 kcal/mol to a non significant value of -0.01 kcal/mol, 287 thus supporting our claim.",

For example, residue E484 contributes unfavorably 296 to the binding energy with 2.24 kcal/mol due to an electrostatic repulsion 297 with E75 from hACE2.
