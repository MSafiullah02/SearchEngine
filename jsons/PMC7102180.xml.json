Indications for a surgical intervention in these patients were recurrence of bleeding after two attempts of endoscopic sclerotherapy; the presence of symptomatic hypersplenism; patient noncompliance with regular follow-up or medical treatment, and patient inability to undergo regular surveillance. In this group of patients the surgical procedures performed were modified Sugiura in 22 patients; mesocaval shunt (Drapanas) in 5 patients, and distal splenorenal shunt (Warren) in 8 patients. The Sugiura procedure was performed in those with significant co-morbidities or mild encephalopathy, nonpatency of the portal or splenic veins, previous splenectomy, or the presence of severe hypersplenism requiring splenectomy.

By ensuring preservation of portal venous blood flow to the liver, this procedure has advantages over portosystemic shunts, preserving liver function and deterring development of postoperative hepatic encephalopathy. In a Japanese series, the original Sugiura procedure had a rebleeding rate of less than 10% [16]. Several modifications of the original Sugiura procedure have been reported, including left gastric vein ligation, with different results [7, 17\u201319]. Likely because of a difference in the proportion of patients with alcoholic cirrhosis, these modifications have not been successfully adopted in the Western countries [4, 6, 20].",

Total esophageal transection to interrupt the transmural and paraesophageal varices was firstly performed by Walker [21]; later, Johnston [22] described the use of a stapler device gun in an abdominal esophageal transection. The major advantage of this procedure is that it can be performed by most surgeons. In addition, a devascularization operation may be the only remaining option for sclerotherapy failure with diffuse splanchnic venous thrombosis. Several series have revealed relatively low operative mortality and rebleeding in the acute setting; however, risk of later haemorrhage from gastric or recurrent esophageal varices may be significant [4, 6, 16, 20, 23, 24].",

Depending upon the recent or long-term sclerotherapy, these patients can have a friable esophagus, which may be the factor that explains the high risk of anastomotic complications. In the present series, esophageal leak from the transection line occurred in 10.8% of patients and was the cause of death in one patient. Johnson et al. [35] reported an equivalent successful result regarding rebleeding rate, omitting the esophageal transection in two-thirds of patients during the modified Sugiura procedure, with lower morbidity in this subset of patients. In addition, several authors suggest that esophageal transection is not essential for the effective control of variceal hemorrhage, avoiding anastomotic leaks in about 20% and death from these leaks in up to 50\u201366% of all patients [20, 39, 40]. The postoperative encephalopathy rate was 6.5% indicating that devascularization is not associated with a high risk of encephalopathy, which can be as high as 30% in portosystemic shunt procedures and 15% in selective distal splenorenal shunt [31, 41].",
