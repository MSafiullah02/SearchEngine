This is the case of irregular migrants, which are estimated to be 600 000 in total [16], due to their legal status and the way they are allowed to access health services. Irregular migrants are not registered to the SSN and thus not assigned to a family doctor, still legislation provides for their access to health services through a 6-month card (STP). Due to the difficulty of accessing the health care system, including limited access to relevant information regarding their rights to care, many irregular migrants are not included in the COVID-19 response, especially in the screening programs for tracking the diffusion of infection. In addition, reduced or lack of access increases their likelihood to give up the seeking of care or to look for assistance elsewhere putting public health security at further risk [17]. A pragmatic, dignifying and inclusive response has been adopted by the Portuguese Government which recently granted permission for temporary residence to all immigrants with pending residence permit applications and asylum seekers. Granting the right to health care services, social security and financial benefits to the most fragile, as migrants, is a duty of a solidary society especially in times of crisis, such as the current epidemic [18].",
