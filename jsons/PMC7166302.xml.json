            "text": "In December 2019, increasing pneumonia cases of unknown etiology were reported in Wuhan (Li et al., 2020), the largest city in Central China with an estimated population of over 10 million people. Cases were traced back to the Huanan Seafood Wholesale Market with the hypothesis that patients had been infected by a pathogen transmitted by live animals. In early January 2020, a novel coronavirus, the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), was identified as the cause from the analysis of the bronchoalveolar washing fluid of a Wuhan patient (Lu et al., 2020). On 11 February 2020, the World Health Organization named the SARS-CoV-2-induced illness as the 2019 coronavirus disease (COVID-19). Due to its person-to-person transmission, COVID-19 has rapidly spread worldwide (Rothe et al., 2020), becoming a public health emergency of international concern requiring an urgent, high-level and coordinated effort to control the outbreak (Cucinotta and Vanelli, 2020). As of 9 April 2020, over 1.5 million COVID-19 cases have been reported across all continents, resulting in a pandemic, with northern Italy becoming Europe\u2019s epicenter, with over 140,000 reported cases (Gagliano et al., 2020).",

            "text": "While increasing global attention has been given to infected patients and the risk for infection of frontline healthcare professionals (Berger et al., 2020), a parallel concern has been expressed for the psychological impact that the COVID-19 pandemic may have in terms of anxious and depressive reactions among the general population (Lima et al., 2020). As evidence suggests a particularly unfavorable mental health outcome in COVID-19 frontline responders (Lai et al., 2020), we register the second case of suicide among female nurses leading the fight against COVID-19 in Northern Italy. Further, due to the emotional impact of COVID-19 pandemic, we may reasonably speculate a higher risk or relapse among people suffering from a pre-existing mental health condition (Yao et al., 2020). Patients with a psychiatric disorder are also vulnerable for a number of other reasons. First, having a psychiatric disorder has been associated with a higher likelihood of getting an infection (Seminog and Goldacre, 2013), possibly due to being cognitively impaired, underestimating the health risk, adopting less stringent self-protection, and having prolonged hospital admissions (Yao et al., 2020). Testing positive for COVID-19 would definitely amplify the fears associated with the infection. Second, access to medical care, which may per se be delayed because of the pandemic overloading the health care system, could be particularly difficult for people with mental health problems as a further consequence of discrimination (Li et al., 2018) or challenging clinical presentation (Sartorious, 2013). Third, the nationwide adoption of regulations progressively restricting people movement and introducing quarantine may result in psychiatric appointments being more difficult to attend, deemed unurgent, or rescheduled following a risk-benefit-based decision.",

Among pediatric populations, the infection seems to result in less critical cases (5.9%) compared to infected adults (18.5%) (Dong et al., 2020). However, caution is called as the pandemic in ongoing and rapidly evolving, and the available evidence scarce. It is worth mentioning that adolescence is a critical period for the manifestation of mental health difficulties (Colizzi et al., 2020). Altogether, evidence suggests that COVID-19 presentation among adolescents with comorbid mental health problems may be challenging in terms of management and require complex care.",

The patient appeared only partially cooperative and intermittently agitated. Loss of sphincter control was also observed, with both urinary and faecal incontinence. Blood and urine tests were performed, especially to investigate inflammatory markers. No specific alterations were observed, with C-reactive Protein and White Blood Count within normal range. Only an increase in total and direct bilirubin was noted, potentially suggesting the presence of Gilbert's syndrome (Supplementary Table 1). Through the day, a peripheral intravenous catheter (PIVC) was used to administer 0.9% saline (sodium chloride (NaCl)) solution for a total of 2000 ml as well as paracetamol for a total of 2000 mg (10mg/ml, 100 ml bis in die (bid)). Brain Computed Tomography (CT) scan, chest X-ray, and urinalysis were unremarkable.

With support from healthcare staff, he came back to the COVID-19 Triage Unit and was relocated to a single-bed patient room.

His mood was slightly depressed. His affect tended to be dysphoric but remained congruous with the thought content. Severe anxiety evolving in mental confusion and loss of control was also observed, with the patient expressing an unmodulated and misdirected discharge of tension and emotions without concern about consequences. The patient showed a mildly disorganized process of thinking and the thought content revealed worries about his health status tending to a delusional intensity, in the absence of suicide ideas. No hallucinatory behavior was observed. He did not appear grossly impaired on a cognitive basis, with both recent and remote memory preserved. While orientation in space and person was intact, orientation in time was partially compromised, especially with reference to the last few days. The patient showed poor insight and judgment regarding his condition and need for help. The patient\u2019s clinical status was reported to have worsened in the few days before the A&E admission also in relation to the need to rearrange his psychology appointments for eating disorder as telephone/video-conference sessions in order not to expose him to unnecessary risk of SARS-CoV-2 contagion. The neuropsychiatrist advised for admission to the inpatient Child and Adolescent Neuropsychiatry Unit for further evaluation, after medical clearance. The antipsychotic Olanzapine was prescribed at the dosage of 2.5 mg bid as provisional treatment plan. On the evening of the same day, the patient was transferred.

A further exploration of his eating disorder revealed alleged gastrointestinal symptoms and fear for some foods considered unhealthy (e.g. dressings), risky or unpleasant (e.g. meat), forcing him to change his dietary habits. As such failure to gain weight was not related to a distorted body image, an Avoidant/Restrictive Food Intake Disorder was also hypothesized.",

Neurocognitive and psychometric assessments were performed using the Wechsler intelligence scale for children-fourth edition (WISC-IV) (Wechsler, 2003) and Self-Administrated Psychiatric Scales for Children and Adolescents (SAFA) (Cianchetti and Sannio Fancello, 2001).

According to DSM-5, a known medical condition explaining the somatic symptoms does not preclude the diagnosis of SSD if, as in our case, the patient\u2019s distress is in excess of what would be expected (First et al., 2015).

Even though evidence suggests that SSD is quite common, such condition remains underrecognized, even in psychiatric settings, leading to considerable strain on healthcare resources through increased primary, specialist, and emergency visits as well as diagnostic investigations and hospital admissions (Rosic et al., 2016). Increased healthcare utilization is a significant concern in SSD (Barsky et al., 2005), also in light of evidence of limited response to psychopharmacological treatment and use of psychological interventions (Rosic et al., 2016). Nowadays, this is particularly relevant as such conditions can overload the already affected health care systems. Due to an unexpected relevant world life event and depending on perception of its impact (Bedard-Thomas et al., 2018), even people not getting the COVID-19 infection, though not life-threatened, may be severely affected by it. When COVID-19-like symptoms occur, clinicians may have to differentially diagnose a possible exacerbation of a pre-existing SSD, triggered by fear of being infected. This is of particular importance as it may help preventing further burden to the healthcare system.",
