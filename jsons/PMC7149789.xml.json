As a general rule, bacterial infections are easier to treat than viral infections, since the armamentarium of antimicrobial agents with activity against bacteria is more extensive. More so than with infectious diseases caused by viruses and parasites, however, bacterial resistance to antimicrobials is a rapidly growing problem with potentially devastating consequences.",

First, the infectivity of an organism determines the number of individuals that will be infected compared to the number who are susceptible and exposed. Second, the pathogenicity is a measure of the potential for an infectious organism to cause disease. Pathogenic bacteria possess characteristics that allow them to evade the body's protective mechanisms and use its resources, causing disease. Finally, virulence describes the organism's propensity to cause disease, through properties such as invasiveness and the production of toxins. Host factors are critical in determining whether disease will develop following transmission of a bacterial agent. These factors include genetic makeup, nutritional status, age, duration of exposure to the organism, and coexisting illnesses. The environment also plays a role in host susceptibility. Air pollution as well as chemicals and contaminants in the environment weaken the body's defenses against bacterial infection.",

When a human is colonized with a pathogen without manifesting disease, he or she is referred to as a carrier. Passive carriers carry pathogens without ever having the disease. The deadly meningitis caused by Neisseria meningitidis is often transmitted by passive carriers who harbor the bacteria in their respiratory tracts. An incubatory carrier is a person who is harboring, and can transmit, an infection during the incubation period (the time between acquisition and manifestation of illness) for that infection. Sexually transmitted infections are frequently transferred by individuals who have not yet shown symptoms. Convalescent carriers manifested symptoms of an infectious disease in the recent past and continue to carry the organism during their recovery period. Active carriers have completely recovered from a disease and harbor the organism indefinitely. Salmonella, especially Salmonella Typhi, the cause of typhoid fever, is an example of a bacterial infection that can produce a prolonged carrier state without the individual being aware of the condition. Salmonella can lurk in a quiescent state in organs such as the gallbladder, sometimes even permanently. These individuals may continuously transfer the pathogen to their contacts. Mary Mallon, a New York City cook in the early 1900s, known as Typhoid Mary, was a carrier responsible for many cases of typhoid fever.",

Diarrhea caused by Salmonella can occur after handling turtles and contaminating one's hands with their feces, or from ingesting undercooked chicken contaminated with the bacteria, or through other routes such as eating undercooked or raw chicken eggs. The disease tularemia, caused by the organism Francisella tularensis, is often seen in individuals who have recently skinned a rabbit. Similarly, anthrax caused by Bacillus anthracis follows either inhalation of spores from dead animals or hides, or entry of spores into a wound.

Food handlers can carry a variety of bacteria on their hands, and indeed there are stringent regulations in many countries regulating food handling and handlers. Seafood can be contaminated from bacteria in the water. Soft cheeses are common reservoirs for Listeria monocytogenes. Sometimes, unexpected foods become reservoirs for bacterial infection, as in the case of alfalfa and other raw seed sprouts, which since the 1970s were known to be reservoirs for both Salmonella and Escherichia coli. It is thought that the presoaking and germination of the seeds in nutrient solutions is conducive to the growth and multiplication of these pathogenic bacteria.

In order to maintain these low bacterial counts, pasteurized milk must remain at 5\u201310 \u00b0C during transport and storage. Listeria, an organism which has a predilection to infect pregnant women, is tolerant of these cold temperatures, and can continue to grow, particularly in soft cheeses, which provide an excellent growth medium. Pregnant women are therefore cautioned against eating soft cheeses, even those that have been pasteurized. An important public health approach for foodstuffs, with wide industry and regulatory adoption, is the identification of critical places or points where contamination is most likely, known by the acronym HACCP (Hazard And Critical Control Point analysis). In many countries all food manufacturers must have an HACCP plan in place to assist with their focus on eliminating foodborne infections.",

In the fourteenth century, suspected plague victims were required to stay on ships or in their homes for 40 days until it was clear that they would not exhibit signs of the disease. In the twenty-first century, large numbers of people were quarantined in Toronto and Hong Kong due to severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), a virus. Today, the only bacterial infections for which the WHO still uses quarantine measures are plague and cholera. In hospitals, standard precautions are used on all patients regardless of whether they have known infection, and special isolation precautions are instituted for patients with specific infections such as highly resistant, or easily transmitted, bacteria. Standard precautions include the practice of performing hand hygiene (washing hands or applying waterless hand sanitizer) after touching a patient, using gloves for contact with body fluids, secretions, excretions, and contaminated items, and using a cover gown, mask, and eye protection when body fluid splashes are likely. Patients infected with airborne bacteria such as tuberculosis are placed in special laminar air flow rooms. Patients with antibiotic-resistant nosocomial bacterial infection or colonization such as methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus and vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus are cohorted in rooms with others like themselves and gloves are routinely used in their care. Patients who have diarrhea caused by the spore-forming bacteria Clostridium difficile are placed in private rooms when possible, and cover gowns and gloves are used to prevent spread of spores throughout the hospital. Special cleaning agents are used in these rooms to kill the spores.",

Between 2002 and 2003, U.S. and Pakistani health officials conducted a study (Luby et al., 2005) in which households in squatter settlements were randomly assigned to be part of a hygiene campaign (involving education and the distribution of soap) or to be simply observed. Washing hands with soap reduced the incidence of diarrhea and pneumonia by half, and the incidence of impetigo, a superficial bacterial skin infection, by one-third. In the developed world, numerous studies have shown an association between poor hand hygiene and the spread of multidrug-resistant organisms within hospitals, and countless studies have shown that compliance with hand hygiene requirements remains low in health-care settings.

The cell wall is made of sugars and amino acids, and in Gram-positive bacteria this wall is thick, lies external to the cell membrane, and contains other macromolecules, whereas in Gram-negative bacteria the wall is thin and is overlaid by an outer membrane. When subjected to the Gram staining procedure, Gram-positive organisms, such as the staphylococci, retain the purple stain, whereas Gram-negative organisms do not. A second stain is then added to allow visualization of the Gram-negative organisms, such as E. coli, which appear pink or red under the microscope. Identifying the causative agent under the microscope as either Gram-positive or Gram-negative (see the section titled \u2018Structure and classification of bacteria,\u2019 above) allows the clinician to more accurately predict the antibiotic that is likely to be effective. The morphology of the bacteria under the microscope (short vs. long, plump vs. thin, branching vs. straight) provides another clue to the identity of the organism. Some organisms such as the Mycobacteria which include tuberculosis, do not readily take up Gram stain and require special stains to be visualized. Other stains that are less commonly used contain specific immunofluorescent-labeled antisera and provide a diagnosis of such organisms as group A hemolytic streptococcus, plague, and syphilis. While a species-level diagnosis is not possible with this method, it does help to rapidly categorize the type of infection and to guide initial treatment.",

Specimens suspected of being infected with bacteria are plated on solid nutrient-rich media or inoculated into broth. On solid media, bacteria grow and produce colonies composed of thousands of cells. Colonies of different species have characteristic appearances and smells that help in their identification. In broth, growth is detected by the presence of turbidity and then the broth is subcultured onto solid media for identification. Some parasitic bacteria, such as Chlamydia and rickettsia, cannot be grown on artificial media and require the presence of host cells (cell culture) for growth. Others, such as Mycobacterium leprae (the agent of leprosy) and Treponema pallidum (the agent of syphilis) cannot be grown at all except in live animals. Once a bacterial colony is present on solid medium, it can be identified by classifying it based on its ability to grow under aerobic or anaerobic conditions, by observing its appearance on Gram stain, by testing its ability to produce enzymes and metabolize sugars as detected by simple tests, and by its ability to utilize various substrates for growth. After the organism is identified, its susceptibility to various antibiotics must be determined in order to guide therapy. The organism is incubated with the various test antibiotics in order to determine whether it will grow in their presence.",
