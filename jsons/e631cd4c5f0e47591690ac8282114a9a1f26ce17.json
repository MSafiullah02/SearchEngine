            "text": "A three-month delay in identifying the outbreak of Ebola virus in rural Guinea in late 2013 resulted in its rapid spread to urban areas and to neighbouring Liberia and Sierra Leone [1] . Once local and international responders identified the virus, they took a year to interrupt its widespread transmission. By April 2016, Ebola had accounted for more than 28,000 cases and over 11,000 deaths. People around the world watched with increasing alarm, as this tragic course of events played out, and with concern that air travel could enable the virus to spread across continents. This epidemic highlighted not only the inadequacy of local health systems to recognise and respond but also that international organisations were not ready to provide timely expertise and resources to control the situation and ameliorate the virus's spread through the region. Had health officials identified Ebola in West Africa promptly, they could have minimised its impact on the lives and livelihoods of the populations of West Africa by implementing appropriate control procedures. Public health officials coined the term surveillance to describe systems they set up to watch out for and control occurrence of health threats. Just as police, for example, set up closed-circuit television devices and community watch programmes to detect and prevent crime, public health surveillance systems engage all possible means to detect unwanted health events and prevent them from escalating and damaging population health. While public health surveillance originated to control spread of infectious diseases such as plague and cholera, it has evolved to include some non-communicable diseases, occupational health and injuries as well as surveillance of biological, behavioural and social determinants of these conditions. We start by reviewing the public health need for surveillance and the development by the international community of regulations to control infectious diseases and other Public Health Emergencies of International Concern (PHEIC). We describe how epidemiologists use surveillance data to detect unusual events or outbreaks and to guide control programmes, and we provide guidance about maintaining data quality. We examine networks that contribute to global surveillance systems and highlight the role of social media and information technology in providing data to monitor new events of international importance. We consider challenges facing epidemiologists responsible for surveillance and describe efforts to address them.",

Authorities began surveillance to identify atypical pneumonia cases but this, and the containment response, were too late to stop SARS spreading. A Chinese urologist who was infected travelled to Hong Kong and spread SARS to another 16 persons. Within weeks, SARS spread to 25 countries with more than 8,000 reported cases ( Fig. 10.1 ) [3] . By the end of the epidemic in July 2003, SARS had killed 774 people [4] . Although unable to contain the outbreak of SARS, the international community was able to bring the epidemic under control within six months-by collaborating across countries to identify and isolate all probable cases. Nevertheless, the Asian Development Bank estimated that the economic loss due to SARS in affected countries was up to US $28 billion with US$ 5.8 billion on Mainland China (approximately 1.2 per cent of its annual gross domestic product (GDP)) and US$ 6.6 billion in Hong Kong (approximately 4 per cent of its annual GDP) [5] .

Diseases often cross borders while still being incubated in humans, or in non-human hosts-insects, animals, and food and agricultural goods. In 2005, after the 2003 SARS outbreak, WHO updated and revised the IHR as a legal framework to include more diseases, and developed real-time evidence-based recommendations for prevention and control of outbreaks.

Each country has an additional list of diseases that it requires its health workers to report by law. Diseases of greatest public health threat are reportable, meaning that health workers or laboratory technicians must report individual cases as they occur. Reportable diseases include those required by IHR and, for example, anthrax, cholera, Ebola, legionellosis, plague and the ZIKV. Other conditions are notifiable, meaning that health workers should report the number of cases that have occurred in a given time period. The number, frequency of reporting and breakdown of reportable and notifiable diseases varies by country. Diarrheal cases, influenza cases, tuberculosis, AIDS and other significant endemic diseases are usually required to be notified to local health authorities.

The structure of government responsibilities for public health surveillance varies across countries. Most often, countries set up dedicated early warning and rapid response surveillance teams that work with or complement surveillance activities of vertical control programmes such as malaria, HIV/AIDS or tuberculosis. Surveillance and response teams detect early stage public health threats while control programmes gather disease (or condition) specific information to plan activities. Control programmes share information with surveillance teams as required. A national network of public health laboratories, often linked to international reference laboratories, confirms etiologic agents, genetic strains and antibiotic resistance patterns. Surveillance activities are said to be active when health workers pro-actively seek out cases and passive when the system relies on patients to report themselves to a clinic.",

Surveillance of birth defects in Brazil identified a major increase in microcephaly during the period when ZIKV transmission increased. This alerted policymakers and epidemiologists to study whether the increase in birth defects was associated with ZIKV infection during pregnancy. WHO declared the suspected increase in microcephaly in association with ZIKV infection of pregnant women a PHEIC and recommended pregnant women to protect themselves from mosquito bites and to avoid travel to areas with known ZIKV transmission. The observation that men who travelled to areas with known ZIKV transmission could sexually transmit ZIKV to their partners led WHO to recommend practising safer sex or abstinence for a period of six months for men and women returning from areas of active transmission.",

Some governments expressed concern about potential negative economic consequences of sharing information and about possible inequities in the benefits of sharing. This led to the 2007 Jakarta Declaration on responsible practices for sharing Avian Influenza viruses and resulting benefits [36] . This declaration underlined need for continued open, timely and equitable sharing of information, data and biological specimens related to influenza; it also emphasised need for more equitable sharing of benefits for example in the generation of diagnostics, drugs and vaccines. The Jakarta Declaration led to the Pandemic Influenza Preparedness Framework (PIP) under which manufacturers of influenza vaccines, diagnostics and pharmaceuticals that use GISRS information make annual financial contributions to WHO. WHO uses approximately 70 per cent of these contributions for pandemic preparedness activities and surveillance, and 30 per cent for pandemic response including purchase of vaccines and antivirals at the time of a pandemic for countries without access to these supplies.",

The guidelines help create the right environment for data sharing and to facilitate good practice in addressing technical, political, ethical, economic and legal concerns that may arise.

To prepare for the next major outbreak, the world needs to invest in a strong warning and response system led by a global institution with sufficient authority and funding to react swiftly [39] . WHO serves this role but is chronically underfunded. Similar investment is needed in countries where a fully supported, well-functioning surveillance office or programme must coordinate different components of the surveillance system. Surveillance information should be disseminated widely to alert the public and health programmes of outbreaks so that they can contain the disease at source before it spreads internationally. Because the world urgently needs reliable and timely surveillance information, public health surveillance should continue to make innovative use of new technology to gather and share information strategically and fairly.",
