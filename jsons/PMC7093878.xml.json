Manufacturers can reliably place picogram amounts of probe at each location and to place these probes just a few micrometers apart. Depending on the planned use for the microarray and the manufacturer, these molecular probes are attached to plastic, glass, nylon, or even silicon wafers. Each individual probe is placed at a precisely defined location on the array support, which is usually a flat, 2-dimensional surface. The identity of the molecule fixed to each spot for any particular array design never changes. The microscopic scale of the array keeps assay costs lower and allows high-throughput \u201cparallel\u201d testing of samples as small as a single cell.",

For instance, DNA microarrays depend on Watson-Crick base pairing. Single-stranded DNA probes will hybridize, or stick, to the strands of DNA sample to be tested following the usual rules of base pairing (A to T, C to G). Complementary DNA sequences have incredibly high affinity for each other and thus the target DNA in a solution literally find and attach itself to the immobilized probe DNA. Probes as short as 20 nucleotides in length can be highly specific, whereas even a single mismatched base will greatly reduce the strength and likelihood of hybridization. Longer probes usually have greater sensitivity for the target molecule; numerous other modifications have been reported to change other probe characteristics. Usually probes are prepared by chemical synthesis or using the polymerase chain reaction. Other types of microarrays, such as arrays that use antibodies to probe for antigens or proteins to probe for protein interactions (\nTable), are more difficult to build, but they also depend on the chemical and physical forces attracting complementary molecules.",

With Southern blots, DNA to be tested is arranged (by size) on a nylon membrane and a probe in solution is labeled with a detection molecule and applied to the membrane to generate a signal. With microarrays, the probe is fixed onto a surface and the nucleic acid to be tested is in a solution, which is applied to the array. Most microarrays use fluorescent tags as the means of identifying whether hybridization has occurred (whether the target molecule is stuck to the probe molecule on the array). Array scanners can rapidly detect very low levels of fluorescence and map the signal to its source on the array with great certainty. Usually the fluorescent tags are excited by a laser and the signal captured by a high-resolution digital camera. Most protocols improve sensitivity of detection by chemically attaching more than 1 copy of fluorescent tag per target molecule detected.",

Nonetheless, on a per-test basis, microarrays offer relatively inexpensive, rapid, simple testing, compared with other molecular methods. Certainly the increasing numbers, varieties, and subtleties of available arrays are accelerating the pace of biomedical discoveries.

The company Fodor subsequently formed (Affymetrix) remains an innovator and is also the largest supplier of DNA microarrays. The variety of commercially available techniques, devices, and instrument systems keeps expanding.

Furthermore, probes can be included for all of the microdeletion regions commonly tested by ancillary fluorescent in situ hybridization tests (ie, Di George syndrome caused by a chromosome 22 microdeletion). Moreover, all of these common microdeletion regions can be tested in parallel rather than one at a time. The patterns obtained on arrays are easier to read by computer, compared with G-banded metaphase spreads.

            "text": "When the SNP markers from a particular chromosomal region are very close together, the neighboring SNP markers do not give independent results (ie, certain SNP alleles are always observed in association with 1 particular allele for a neighboring SNP). This means that very little additional information is gained by testing SNPs that are right next to each other. Investigators are identifying the recombination hot spots in our genome that define the boundaries of blocks of SNPs, which tend to occur together as defined haplotypes (alleles strung together on the same DNA strand).20 A limited number of common haplotype patterns account for most of the genetic variation in a block, and most of the variation in SNP allele frequencies can be accounted for by a small set of common haplotype patterns. The International HapMap Project is successfully describing the extent of these haplotype blocks in humans, promising greater efficiency in future disease gene discovery.21, 22 Current SNP chips are designed so that for every block in the human genome, there are enough SNP markers to determine the frequencies of these common haplotype patterns.",

Because expression constellations can involve hundreds of individual genes, it can be difficult to determine whether and how a group of samples can be divided into 2 or more distinct groups. For many applications, expressed genes that meet certain quality criteria are first analyzed by unsupervised methods. These methods are less biased and more likely to discover previously unrecognized pathways based on the clustering of gene-expression profiles. Three-dimensional scatter plots are examined to determine whether related specimens cluster together. When they do, self-organizing groups can develop into evolutionary trees as multiple experiments are compared and as various types of regression analyses are performed. Some of the associations, although statistically significant, will not reflect actual pathways.
