On the 11 th of March 2020, 118 162 cases were confirmed in 113 countries, with 4 290 deaths 2 . The Covid-19 outbreak threatens to saturate healthcare systems in Western countries which are already at breaking point dealing with routine demands 3 . Indeed, the virus transmits easily (R0 between 1.4 and 3.28) and its current management involves mainly hospital care, despite the fact that most patients who will contract the virus will have few symptoms and long term effects [3] [4] [5] . Na\u00efve calculations show that this strategy will not be sustainable as the epidemic progresses 6 . To anticipate for the escalation of the epidemic, since the 7 th of March 2020, patients with confirmed Covid-19 without signs of severity in France can be managed at home by their general practitioner 7 . Similarly, in the United Kingdom, a 24 hour, seven day a week, service has been set-up to manage patients who \"do not require immediate admission\" to the hospital\", at home 5 . Yet, these solutions rely heavily on in-person management of patients and will still place an important workload on general practitioners and other care professionals involved.",
