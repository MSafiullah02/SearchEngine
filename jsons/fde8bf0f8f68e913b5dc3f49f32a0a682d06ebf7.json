Of course, in comparison to a life-threatening disease, any musculoskeletal complaint may seem like a minor burden. On the other hand, can we state that 'the Pelvis' is indeed a small topic within the musculoskeletal domain?",

With the shift in focus to the intervertebral disc in the 1930's, the SIJ's were suddenly forgotten. The pelvis and more specifically, the SIJ's regained interest in the nineties (5, 7, 8) .",

(7, 8, 9) The assumption was that loss of 'force closure\" by either non-optimal muscle recruitment, or different alignment of the SIJ's would lead to problems in load transfer, strain on ligaments and capsules, culminating in pain. This model was adopted by researchers and clinicians as a possible explanatory model for the aetiology of Pelvic Girdle Pain (PGP), described as pain across the pelvis, iliac crest to the gluteal fold or in the symphyses originating during pregnancy, partus or directly post-partum. PGP has a prevalence of 45-78% in pregnancy, and 30% remaining chronic complaints after childbirth (10) .",

However, clinicians should be aware that these models are very limited. It is no longer acceptable to consider (musculoskeletal) pain solely as a peripheral phenomenon (11) . It is astounding how vivid this very restrictive biomedical model still is among clinicians and researchers. Hodges et al., 2019 describe a collaborative model, formed by fuzzy cognitive mapping with 14 clinicians and scientists with expertise in the area of PGP (1). The most frequent category receiving emphasis was 'Biomechanics\" with related \"Tissue injury and pathology\" in the metamodel. Remarkably, since the category receiving highest scores regarding LBP was psychology, only 1 expert scored this in PGP (1) . It might well be that PGP approaches and perspectives got stuck in time, resulting perhaps in a closed mind on what might be the cause and driver of symptoms for people afflicted with PGP?",

This dilemma may explain why many clinicians stick to 'older theoretical models', although we are worried they will remain to be used to explain to patients where their pain derives from. In this issue an important 'Professional Issue article' contributes to new theories on the origin of \"chronic\" musculoskeletal health problems as PGP, to broaden the scope of each clinician (Meyer et al., 2020b).

            "text": "Specific assessment of PGP is a significant area of debate and variability in clinical practice. One of the more controversial areas of pelvic assessment are SIJ mobility tests. A systematic review points out that it seems not possible to clinically measure SIJ mobility in a valid and reliable way (Klerkx et al., 2020) . So, we have to question ourselves as clinicians, if mobility tests should be used at all in our clinical reasoning, especially when we know that we should no longer look at PGP as a local biomechanical peripheral condition. Within clinical reasoning the clinician can still focus on pain and function. Symphysial pain is a common condition related to PGP, that can negatively influence function and well-being. An established questionnaire to objectify disability in PGP is the Pelvic Girdle Pain questionnaire (Stuge et al., \u2026.) (12) Adaptations to this tool have been developed to self-administer symphyseal pain often experienced during pregnancy and re-occurring in later pregnancies (Woodley et al., 2020) Another focus in our clinical reasoning are functional tests, to indicate possible treatment strategies. Findings are presented of a well-known functional test; the Timed up and Go test in the PGP population (Yeminisihar et al, 2020). Studies on how function is altered in patients with PGP versus healthy controls are also incorporated in this special issue. Where Delshad et al., (2020) are focussing on the effect of the pelvic belt, Bussey et al., (2020) present how functional (dis)ability in postural control develops during pregnancy. Tabahatha et al, (2020) focussed on a different group of patients, those with pain in the buttock hypothesized to originate from the piriformis muscle: coined the piriformis syndrome. They studies differences in gait in a population with and without these complaints. All of these studies can be informative on how function can be altered with complaints in the pelvic area. Within the diagnostic process, understanding of the relation to co-morbidity is important as well. Often the co-morbidity of lower urinary tract symptoms as urinary incontinence are missed. Is the clinician up to asking questions in this domain, if it is not related to nerve root compression? This question is challenged in the qualitative study, tackling the issue of assessment of comorbid lower urinary tract symptoms (Vredeveld et al., 2020)",

It is of interest that both teams, independently, work to conceptualise PGP from a modern pain science perspective. Meijer et al., (2020b) follow their historical journey with a 'deconstruction' that leads to a theory of PGP as a neuroinflammatory disorder. It provides conceptual links to comorbid mental health disorders that commonly accompany chronic PGP complaints. Similarly, Beales et al, (2020) also see neurological system sensitisation as a potential mechanism linking PGP to comorbid health complaints. Further, they provide clinicians with a road map of sorts for consideration of this with a person-centred approach to managing these disorders, described in the Masterclass of this special issue (Beales et al., 20202).",
