On the basis of these data, they suggested that HCoV-NH infection was associated with KD. To further investigate whether HCoV-NH disease is associated with KD, we performed a retrospective study. From October 2002 to May 2003, 19 nasopharyngeal swab samples were collected from 19 children who fulfilled the criteria for KD and who were treated at Tenshi Hospital in Sapporo, Japan. All of the samples were collected after informed consent was obtained from the children's parents. All of the samples were obtained within 7 days of the onset of illness. The mean age of the children with KD was 22.6 months (range, 4 months-5 years). We used as controls 208 nasopharyngeal swab samples that were collected from children with diagnoses of respiratory tract disease who were admitted to hospitals in Sapporo, Japan, during the same period. All of these samples were examined after the possibility of infection with human respiratory syncytial virus or influenza A or B was excluded by rapid antigen-detection tests.

After extraction of total RNA and synthesis of cDNA, we performed RT-PCR to detect the HCoV-NH genome, as described by Esper et al. [6] .
