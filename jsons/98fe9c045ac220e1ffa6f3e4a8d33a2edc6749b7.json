            "text": "Glutamyl endopeptidases (GEPases) are enzymes that preferentially cleave the bonds of the \u03b1-carboxyl groups of glutamic acid [1, 2] . GEPases from a number of gram-positive bacteria [23] [24] [25] and (+)RNA viruses have been characterized to date. All GEPases belong to the structural chymotrypsin family, which is one of the most extensive and well-studied families. Chymotrypsin-like protease (CLP) molecules share their spatial organization principle; the so-called chymotrypsin (or trypsin) fold (Fig. 1) . The residue at the P1 position is a key determinant of the hydrolysis sites of CLPs (according to the Schechter and Berger nomenclature, the cleaved bond of the substrate is located downstream of the P1 residue, which corresponds to the S1-binding site of an enzyme [26] ). Similar to pancreatic serine proteases, CLPs are conventionally classified into three main groups: 1) hydrolyzing bonds formed by the \u03b1-carboxyl groups of large hydrophobic amino acid residues (chymotrypsin-like specificity), 2) cleaving bonds downstream of positively charged residues (trypsin-like specificity), and 3) preferring small hydrophobic residues at the P1 position (elastase-like specificity) [27] . Furthermore, CLPs with mixed specificity have been discovered. For example, collagenolytic enzymes isolated from crabs exhibit the combined specificity of trypsin, chymotrypsin, and elastase [28], while bovine duodenase [29] and cathepsin G [30] can efficiently hydrolyze the substrates of both trypsin and chymotrypsin. In addition, CLPs cleaving bonds preferentially downstream of the Gln residue (e.g., many 3C-like viral proteases [23]) and being specific to negatively charged amino acid residues (e.g., granzyme B that preferentially hydrolyzes bonds downstream of Asp residues [31] and the GEPases that this review focuses on) are known.",

The S1 sites are similar in both enzymes. However, substitution of the main determinant of the binding of the charged substrates of trypsin Asp189 with Ser, which is typical of chymotrypsin, does not induce the corresponding specificity. Instead, a low-efficiency nonspecific protease is formed [39] . Ensuring chymotrypsin-like specificity requires substitution of four residues in the S1 pocket and modification of the regions remote from the S1 site: two surface loops that do not come into direct contact with the substrate [40] and Tyr172 residue [41] . Comparison of the crystalline structures and kinetic characteristics of the resulting variants to those of chymotrypsin and trypsin demonstrates that additional modifications are important for accurate positioning of the bond being cleaved with respect to the catalytic center of the protein (the Ser195-His57 pair and the oxyanion hole) rather than for binding the P1 residue [40] [41] [42] [43] .",

The structure of this enzyme is generally typical for CLPs ( Fig. 2A) and is the most similar to that of bacterial CLPs (proteases A and B from Str. griseus and \u03b1-lytic protease). The overall geometry of the S1 site is also very close to the geometry of this region in the aforelisted bacterial enzymes. Contrary to expectations, no explicit compensator for the negative charge of the substrate, Lys or Arg residue, was detected in the S1 site. The carboxyl group of Glu at position P1 of the substrate forms hydrogen bonds with Ser190 (192 if numbering [44] is used), Ser126, and His213. Hence, these residues probably play the key role in substrate recognition. The side chain of histidine can be positively charged. However, if pK a of the side chain of His213 in the absence of the substrate is taken to be 6.4, the imidazole ring will be protonated by less than 1% at the pH 8.5 that is optimum for the functioning of Glu-SGP; therefore, histidine is expected to be neutrally charged [44] . Meanwhile, pK a of amino acid residues in the proteins can vary significantly depending on the environment [45] . An analysis of the Glu-SGP structure has revealed that it carries the so-called histidine triad containing His199 and His228, along with His213. The three His residues permeate Three-dimensional structure of chymotrypsin (PDB ID -5cha). The catalytic triad residues are shown as sticks. The regions forming the S1 pocket are shown in blue; the positions of the key residues of the S1 pocket are shown in magenta.

Any modifications to Ser190(192) (Ala/Gly/Asn/Thr/Val) and His213 (Ala/Gly/Lys/ Asn/Arg/Ser/Val) stop the autocatalytic processing (at Glu(-1)-Val1 bond) of the GEPase precursor, which proves that these residues play a fundamental role in the formation of the S1 site. Meanwhile, Ser216 seems to be less important, since its substitution for Ala or Gly does not result in a loss of activity by the enzyme. A similar result was observed for certain modifications of histidine triad residues: the mutations His199\u2192Val and His228\u2192Ala/Asp/Asn/Ser/Val do not impede enzyme processing. All the mutant proteins (His199\u2192Val, Ser216\u2192Ala, Ser216\u2192Gly, and His228\u2192Ala) whose specificities have been studied maintained their pref-erence for the substrates carrying Glu-P1 [47] . Hence, the hypothesis of the significance of the histidine triad in charge compensation has not been confirmed experimentally and the Ser190(192) and His213 residues are now believed to play a key role in substrate recognition.",

Furthermore, the position of the Ser216-containing loop 216-220 (136-140) could not be detected by a crystal structure analysis, thus demonstrating that this region is highly flexible.

The modifications His213(1198)\u2192Lys/Arg/ Tyr also terminated the processing. The same effect was observed with the Thr190(1179)\u2192Asp substitution; however, the mutations Thr190(1179)\u2192Ser/Gly only slightly reduced the processing efficiency [58] . In combination with the data obtained using the Glu-SGP model, these results demonstrate the fundamental significance of His213 and the considerably smaller role of the residues 190 and 216 for the hydrolysis of specific substrates by GEPases. Meanwhile, it still remains unclear whether His213 is a key element in the recognition of the charged substrate and what contribution to the formation of substrate specificity is made by Thr/ Ser190 and Ser216.

The protease carries the conventional catalytic triad; modification of its residues terminates polyprotein processing [62] . Similar to all GEPases, the conserved residues His213(298) and Thr190(279) are maintained, located within the S1 site of the enzyme. However, position 216(301) is occupied by a large hydrophobic residue, Phe (Fig. 4C) . Superimposition of the 3D structures of SeMV-pro and Glu-SGP complexed with the tetrapeptide product of proteolysis of tert-butyloxycarbonyl-Ala-Ala-Pro-Glu (Boc-AAPE) demonstrates that the side chain of the Glu-P1 residue fits well the S1 pocket of viral protease. In order for the volume of the S1 pocket to be retained if there is a residual with a bulky side chain, the main protein chain needs to be significantly shifted in the 214(299)-223(308) region and the resulting space needs to be filled with the side chain of the Asp223(308) residue that is involved in the formation of the bottom of the S1 pocket, but apparently does not directly interact with Glu-P1 (Fig. 4C ). This situation demonstrates that Ser 216 and the hydrogen bond between residue 216 and the \u03b3-carboxyl group of Glu-P1 play no role in ensuring glutamate specificity. Unfortunately, no experiments involving the modification of Phe216(301) within SeMV-pro have been carried out. Meanwhile, the substitutions of His213(298) and Thr190(279) for Ala, but not the Asp223(308)\u2192Ala mutation, completely inhibit the processing in cis of the SeMV-pro/VPg fusion protein (VPg being the viral protein following SeMV-pro in the polyprotein) in the model system [61] .",

Hence, the Asp102 residue (489 in polyprotein) of the catalytic triad that also contains Ser195(551) and His57(461) possesses a noncanonical conformation [24] . The structure of the S1 site also noticeably differs from the ones discussed above. Despite the fact that the His213 residue and its position are invariant, Ser at position 216 is substituted by Asn216(569), whose amide group actually occupies the place of the \u03b3-carboxyl group of the substrate Glu-P1 as demonstrated by the superposition of the HAstV-pro structure and Glu-SGP complexed with the ligand (Fig. 4D) . This significantly reduces the S1 pocket [24] , whose volume does not match the Glu side radical. Furthermore, the conformation of the main-chain region 189-193 (545-549) differs from that in most CLP; thereafter, the conserved Thr190 residue lies far from the S1 site and is turned sideways. The position of the region 189-193 resembles the configuration of this region in PRRSV-Nsp4. Taking into account these differences from the structures of other GEPases and CLPs, it is rather arduous to draw any specific conclusions regarding the interactions between HAstV-pro and the P1 residue of the substrate.",

This residue can be positively charged; therefore, it is regarded as a candidate for being the key structural element that determines the substrate preferences of Glu-specific proteases. The Thr/Ser190 residue is also conserved in all GEPases, but its modification does not result in a loss of specific activity by the enzymes and possibly does not play any crucial role in the recognition of the Glu-P1 residue of the substrate. Finally, the nature of residue 216 is unessential in ensuring substrate specificity. As a result, GEPases carry residues with strongly different properties, Ser, Asn and Phe, at these positions. Additional information on the structural determinants of the substrate specificity of GEPases can be obtained by analyzing the viral 3C and 3C-like proteases that exhibit specificity to Gln at position P1.",

            "text": "Comparison of the primary and spatial structures of GEPases and 3C/3CLpro shows the similarity between their S1 sites (Figs. 3E,F) . First, all 3C/3CLpro, identically to GEPases, contain the conserved His213 residue [64] [65] [66] [67] [68] [69] [70] [71] [72] [73] [74] [75] [76] , whose modification results in enzyme inactivation [77] [78] [79] . This fact allows one to infer that this residue is not the key determinant of recognition of the substrate charge but is fundamental in ensuring a correct geometry of the S1 site. Second, most 3C/3CLpros retain the Thr/Ser190 residue that is typical of GEPases [58] , thus confirming the conclusion that it is crucial for the formation of an adequate geometry of the S1 pocket rather than for charge recognition. The third element of the S1 site of GEPases at position 216, in 3C/3CLpro, is typically replaced with Gly ( Fig.  4F ) and sometimes Ala (Fig. 4E) residues, which have not been found in the known GEPases. The latter fact provides grounds for speculation about the involvement of Ser216 in the compensation for the substrate charge in GEPases [60] . However, mutagenesis in the Glu-SGP model shows that the Ser216\u2192Ala/Gly substitution does not make the substrates with Gln-P1 the preferred ones, although it increases efficiency in their hydrolysis [47] . Furthermore, the data on GEPases with Phe/Asn216 residues that have been discussed do not support these assumptions. It is worth mentioning another hypothesis that still remains unverified. Since all GEPases are serine proteases, while Gln-specific enzymes are cysteine proteases, it is fair to assume that the difference in their substrate specificity depends on catalytic residues.",

The biological activity of ETs is associated with their ability to cleave with high specificity the Glu381-Gly bond in desmoglein 1, the desmosomal protein of cadherin type that mediates intercellular contacts (see more details in review [80] ). In addition, ETs cleave the ester bonds formed by the carboxyl groups of Glu residues in vitro [82] .",

The second feature consists in the unusual position of the residues forming the oxyanion hole: the Pro/Val192-Gly193 peptide bond (chymotrypsin numbering being used) is rotated 180\u00b0 compared to other CLPs. As a result, a hydrogen bond is formed between the carbonyl oxygen of residue 192 and the hydroxyl group of catalytic Ser195 that seems to impede the manifestation of activity. After a structural analysis, a hypothesis has been put forward that binding between ET and the substrate (or a receptor) that the N-terminal \u03b1-helix is involved in results in a rearrangement of the active site and enzyme activation [83] .",

            "text": "The proteins under discussion possess high structural similarity with each other and with staphylococcal ETs; their structure is typical of CLPs. Their molecules consist of two \u03b2-domains separated by a deep cleft containing the active site (Fig. 7) . The general architecture of the S1 sites in Glu-V8, BIGEP, and Esp is similar to that of analogous regions in other GEPases and contain the mandatory elements: His213 and Ser/Thr190 (Figs. 8A,B) . Meanwhile, the Gly residue is located in the third key position of the S1 pocket, which is a feature of viral Gln-specific 3C-and 3CLpro as discussed above. However, the absence of residue 216 side radical that can form a hydrogen bond with the carboxyl group oxygen of the substrate is compensated for, as predicted earlier, by the \u03b1-amino group of Val1, which occupies a position corresponding to that of the \u03b5-amino group of the Lys216 residue in ET (Fig. 8C) . Hence, a unique situation seems to take place for Glu-V8, BIGEP, and Esp, when protease specificity is determined by the N-terminus of the polypeptide chain. The originality of this \"design concept\" consists in the fact that Glu-V8, BIGEP, and Esp are synthesized by the cell as precursors that involve the signal peptide and propeptide, in addition to the catalytic domain. Hence, the N-terminus of a mature protein and, therefore, the S1 pocket are formed only after processing. This situation resembles the mechanism of activation of mammalian CLPs: after the propeptide was removed, the N-terminal NH 2 -group of the mature protein formed a salt bridge with the Asp194 residue, thus triggering structural rearrangements in the enzyme molecule that result in its activation due to the formation of a proper structure of the S1 site and an oxyanion hole [92] [93] [94] [95] [96] . Site-directed modification of the residues in the S1 sites of BIGEP and Glu-V8 provided interesting results. First of all, the GEPase variant with a modification of the His213 residue was studied for the first time. Mutations of this type had been inserted earlier [47, 58] , but no proteins were obtained. It was demonstrated that BIGEP with the His213(186 in BIGEP)\u2192Thr substitution does not alter substrate preference and cleaves the protein substrate only after Glu residues. Meanwhile, modification significantly affects the catalysis effectiveness (the k cat decreases more than 600-fold) but has a relatively low impact on substrate binding (the K M increases approximately fivefold) [97] . Interestingly, a similar effect is also observed when the substrates containing the Asp residue at the P1 position are cleaved by native GEPases: the K M increases approximately sixfold, while the k cat declines by the same order of magnitude (~150-fold) [98] . These findings allow one to conclude that the conserved His213 residue is not the key element that determines the recognition of the negative charge of the substrate by GEPases but seems to be significant for accurate positioning of the cleaved bond with respect to the nucleophile (oxygen of the hydroxyl group of Ser195). This conclusion is consistent with the fact that His213 is the common structural element for Glu-and Gln-specific proteases.",

The more properties of the residue are similar to those of Val, the smaller the decrease in activity is. This result indicates that residue 1 is important for enzyme function and can be explained by the fact that deviations of the position of the \u03b1-amino group of this residue from the optimal position are different in mutants. Furthermore, Glu-V8 variants with additional amino acid residues, propeptide fragments, at the N-terminus, have been successfully obtained. Insertion of additional residues (from 1 to 39) in all cases significantly reduced enzymatic activity in hydrolyzing the substrates containing Glu-P1 [9, 100] but had a smaller impact on the efficiency of hydrolysis of similar substrates carrying Gln-P1. The mutants maintained their preference for substrates containing Glu-P1; cleavage efficiency was 10-20 times higher [100] . Hence, the \u03b1-amino group of the N-terminal Val residue probably makes a very significant contribution to the recognition of the charged substrate by the bacterial GEPases under discussion but is not fully responsible for enzyme specificity.",

This indicates that GEPase branches have appeared several times in the evolutionary tree of CLPs, probably on the basis of the fundamental structure of the S1 pocket that is equally suitable for ensuring both glutamate and glutamine specificities and is most similar to the structure of the S1 regions of viral enzymes. The necessity for several structural variants of specificity optimization apparently is supposed to be caused by the differences in the functions of proteases belonging to different groups. An analysis of the published data on GEPases reveals that variations in the structure of the S1 sites in these enzymes correlate with the differences in the maturation mechanisms of their precursors. This observation allows one to put forward a hypothesis that the charge-compensation method depends on the maturation mechanism of the precursor protein.",

            "text": "All GEPases are synthesized as precursors. However, the enzyme processing mechanisms significantly differ and can be subdivided into three groups. GEPases from Streptomyces and viruses are processed autocatalytically [47, 51] . ET precursors contain only a secretory leader [3] and, therefore, are processed by signal peptidase. For bacterial GEPases similar to Glu-V8 and BIGEP, propeptide is removed heterocatalytically by different proteases [22, [100] [101] [102] [103] [104] , with just one exception [21] . Comparison of the structures of the S1 sites of GEPases and the processing mechanisms shows that no explicit substrate charge compensator is revealed in the S1 pocket in autoactivated enzymes; the S1 site of ET is characterized by the presence of the Lys216 residue, while the GEPases similar to Glu-V8 and BIGEP processed heterocatalytically contain an \u03b1-amino group of the N-terminal residue. Let us discuss these matches in the context of the biological functions of proteases belonging to each group. Viral GEPases are synthesized as part of the long polyprotein, its selective hydrolysis being the main function of these enzymes [25, 51, 105, 106] . Hence, viral GEPases function inside the cell and start acting immediately after the polyprotein is synthesized. Therefore, the active site of the enzyme, including the specificity-determining regions, needs to form and be able to perform high-specificity hydrolysis already as part of the precursor protein, maintaining its structure after processing. The function of GEPases from Streptomyces appears to be fundamentally different. These extracellular enzymes are synthesized as conventional protease precursors carrying prepropeptide. The func-tions of the prosequences of GEPases from Streptomyces are yet to be elucidated; however, one can assume that propeptides ensure the kinetic stability of mature molecules and partake in their secretion, by analogy with the closely related protease B from Str. griseus [107, 108] . Meanwhile, autocatalytic processing and the lack of a noticeable post-translational regulation of activity make this situation similar to that reported for viral enzymes: the active site needs to have completely formed within a precursor and maintained intact after a mature molecule has formed. In both cases, this problem seems to have one structural solution (Fig. 4) . The S1 pocket does not have a direct charge compensator. The N-terminus is remote from the active site in the mature protein. Therefore, it does not partake in the formation of the S1 site as it is involved in processing. The structural elements responsible for glutamate specificity, which have not been identified yet, reside outside the S1 region and probably form before precursor processing. Hence, the structural elements that change during maturation are not involved in the formation of the molecule sites important for catalysis.",

This implies that activity is strictly controlled via a rather complex and somewhat controversial mechanism. At first glance, the Glu-V8, BIGEP, and Esp precursors are supposed to be inactive, since the S1 site in these proteins is formed only in the mature molecule ( Figs.  7 and 8) . Meanwhile, data have been published demonstrating that the precursors of Glu-V8 [113] , BIGEP [109] , Esp [7] , as well as GEPases from B. licheniformis [114] , B. subtilis [102] , and Thermoactinomyces sp. [21] are capable of autoprocessing; in most cases, it is the bonds corresponding to the specificity of the mature enzymes that are cleaved [7, 21, 109, 114] . Furthermore, glutamate activity in trans of precursor analogues has been detected [100] . These facts cast doubt on the mere possibility of regulating the activity of the proteases under discussion, although a closer look at the precursor activation mechanism demonstrates that the situation is more complex.",

These species exhibit no activity with respect to protein substrates and low activity with respect to peptides in trans and can be activated only heterocatalytically [7, 100, 109, 113, 114] . To make the picture complete, we would like to add that data on the enzyme from Thermoactinomyces sp. carrying Glu1, which can be autoactivated in vitro in a heterologous expression system [21] , identically to the previously artificially obtained mutants of other GE-Pases [109, 114] , have been published recently. Hence, maturation of enzymes similar to Glu-V8 is a stepwise process. These proteins seem to contain two propeptides. The first one is a long folding assistant [99, 109] that ensures the kinetic stability of a mature protein as often occurs in bacterial proteases [115] . The second propeptide, which is short and forms after the first processing step, is the activation unit [109, 113, 114] that Fig. 9 . Phylogenetic tree of chymotrypsin-like proteases.

Furthermore, it cannot be ruled out that the structure of the active site of proteases changes after the first propeptide portion is removed. It is fair to say that propeptides of the discussed group of GEPases simultaneously combine properties typical of the propeptides of bacterial CLPs and mammalian enzymes. Hence, the need for strict regulation of the activity of Glu-V8-like enzymes is satisfied through the formation of the S1 pocket only after the propeptide has been deleted. A mechanism similar to the activation mechanism of mammalian CLPs is used: involvement of the N-terminal amino group in the structure of the molecule elements essential for catalysis.

On the other hand, processing is not related to activity regulation, since it only involves signal peptide deletion. Hence, neither the formation of a functionally active enzyme before processing nor strict activity regulation is required. The variant observed in GEPases from viruses and Streptomyces would be suitable here. However, a phylogenetic analysis demonstrates that ETs are most likely to be Glu-V8 paralogues (Fig. 9 , see discussion below); i.e., these proteins are \"engineered\" on the same basis as Glu-V8 and employ essentially the same architecture of the S1 site (Fig. 8) . Meanwhile, unlike Glu-V8, ETs contain no propeptides, being indicative of a different folding mechanism [115] , and exhibit a much narrower specificity. They are inactive with respect to most proteins and peptides, which is possibly attained through inserting the Lys216 residue and reducing the volume of the S1 pocket, as well as due to the unusual conformation of the oxyanion hole [83] .",

The only attempt at a phylogenetic analysis of enzymes belonging to this group was found in a study published 20 years ago [46] . Therefore, in this review we compared the sequences of the characterized GEPases and some CLPs with different specificities in order to build a phylogenetic tree (Fig. 9) . First, we would like to mention, as the authors of [46] did, that there is an impression that GEPases have appeared in the phylogenetic tree of GLPs at least twice. This is indicated by the presence of two remote branches of bacterial GEPases: one branch contains proteins similar to Glu-V8 and ET, while the second one corresponds to enzymes from Streptomyces. (The phylogenetic position of viral proteases is difficult to infer, since the topology of the resulting tree in the portion concerning these proteins is unreliable.) It is especially illustrative that GEPases from Streptomyces are just a small sprout in the branch of bacterial proteases exhibiting broad specificity. This observation gives grounds for assuming that there is quite a high probability that glutamate specificity (actually, any other specificity) develops via the chymotrypsin fold. Modification of the key residues of the S1 pocket (His213, Thr/Ser190) that provide the required geometry and minimal interactions for the binding of Glu/ Gln residues is apparently needed for that. However, this basic specificity probably needs to be enhanced, which can be achieved through different mechanisms, in particular by inserting a compensator into the S1 site. However, this is not the only possibility as demonstrated by the analysis of enzymes from viruses and Streptomyces. Special attention should be focused on the branch combining all bacterial GEPases, except for enzymes isolated from Streptomyces. As expected, the topology of this branch corresponds to the taxonomy of producer bacteria. ETs and staphylococcal enzymes, such as Glu-V8, share the phylogenetic tree's branch; i.e., they are structurally closer to each other than they are to the remaining bacterial GEPases.",

Viral GEPases are being thoroughly studied in connection with attempts to design effective antiviral drugs. Meanwhile, GEPases are usually not isolated from the entire pool of 3C-like proteases in pursuit of universal inhibitors of the processing of viral polyproteins. Engineering of inhibitors requires extensive investigation into protein-ligand interactions, which implies obtaining a large body of structural data (e.g., [76, 117] ). The study of the role of GEPases in the viral life cycle is still underway [24, 118] . The recent studies devoted to viral 3C and 3C-like proteases, including GEPases, as apoptosis inductors deserve special mention [119] [120] [121] [122] .
