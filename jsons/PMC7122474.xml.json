It is further accepted that human genes can be subject of patent protection if they meet the patentability criteria such as novelty, inventive step and industrial applicability (article 27 (1) TRIPs). However, states may take a decision to deny patents on their territory for inventions claiming human genes based on ethical grounds in case the commercial exploitation of such patents runs counter to ordre public or morality (article 27 (3) (b) TRIPs) (Van Overwalle, 2008). Till now, few countries have used the option to carve out human genes from their patent laws (Van Overwalle 2008).",

As a matter of routine, the European Patent Office (EPO) granted european patents for DNA sequences and genes without a great stir, provided they met the conditions of novelty, inventive step and industrial applicability. This lenient policy was first formally challenged when a patent was granted for \u201ca DNA fragment encoding human H2-preprorelaxin\u201d (see claim 1 of European patent EP 112.149). In its decision, the EPO concluded that an invention concerning a human gene was not an exception to patentability because it would not be universally regarded as outrageous: \u201c[\u2026 ] it did not amount to patenting life because DNA as such was not life but one of the many chemical entities participating in biological processes; no offence to human dignity had occurred as the woman who donated tissue was asked for her consent and her self-determination was not affected by the exploitation of the claimed molecules\u201d (EPO OD, 1995, Howard Florey Institute).",

An element isolated from the human body or otherwise produced by means of a technical process, including the sequence or partial sequence of a gene, may constitute a patentable invention, even if the structure of that element is identical to that of a natural element (article 5 EU Biotechnology Directive) (see Box 1).",

On the basis of a single application and examination procedure one can protect an invention in up to 36 European countries, all contracting states which have ratified the European Patent Convention of 1973 (EPC). The term \u201cEuropean patent\u201d, however, is misleading from three points of view. It is not a single patent that is valid for the whole of Europe: the application and granting procedures are uniform, after which the patent is broken up into a \u201cbundle\u201d of national patents which are further subject to national legislation and, more particularly, to national regulations with regard to nullification and impairment. Nor is a \u201cEuropean patent\u201d a patent granted by the European Union (EU): European patents have nothing to do with the EU apart from the fact that all EU Member States have also signed the EPC. Furthermore, it is on the basis of the EPC that the European Patent Office (EPO) was brought into being, for dealing with European patent applications. It bears repeating that the EPO is not an EU institution, either.",
