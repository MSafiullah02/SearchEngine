These various candidate vaccines are intended for use in prevention of diseases from emergent viruses, such as the HIVAIDS, severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) virus, or West Nile virus (WNV), as well as for counterterrorism measures, such as vaccines against Ebola virus. An immune response is generated by the in vivo expression of the viral proteins after inoculation with the plasmid vaccine candidates encoding them. In addition, one plasmid described herein expresses a cytokine adjuvant. Therefore, the authors have performed numerous similar biodistribution and repeated-dose toxicology studies on similar DNA vaccines expressing a variety of vaccine immunogens and a cytokine adjuvant to support the preclinical development of each of these vaccine candidates. The experience thereby gained has permitted refinements of protocols over time, as well as eventual efficiencies in preparing regulatory submissions by providing more data on the safety of various different candidate vaccines.

This precursor plasmid vaccine construct (6438 bp) encodes the gag gene of the HXB2 strain of HIV-1 (Table 1) .

This backbone differs from a related backbone (Hartikka et al., 1996) used in products described below by removal of an XmnI site in the region following the BGH poly A sequence and replacement with an SfiI site. This was done to ensure that at least one SfiI site was present in each plasmid construct to permit use of SfiI in the integration studies. When the gene insert contained an SfiI site, the pVR1012 backbone was used. When it did not, the pVR1012x/s backbone, with the introduced SfiI site, was used. A synthetic version of the gag gene using codons optimized for expression in human cells was inserted into this plasmid backbone (pVR1012x/s).

We do not at this point have data to explain why more plasmid remains in the subcutis/skin than in the muscle which receives the bolus of the inoculum. However, this phenomenon has been seen consistently in our data and that of others (personal communications, Chris Butler) whenever the subcutis/skin specimen has been tested. One possibility is that the subcutis/skin consists mainly of adipose tissues (cells which are large in comparison to the nuclei and which have large storage vacuoles) and cornified dermal layers (cells with no nuclei). It may be that the plasmid that remains has deposited into a portion of the cell (i.e., not the nucleus) in which, or outside of cells where, it does not get processed (i.e., expressed or degraded).

These similarities are observed even with vaccines for differing disease indications, built on similar, although not identical, plasmid vaccine platforms. One example of this increased efficiency achieved is the continuous bridging of the biodistribution of newer generation products to an initial plasmid vaccine (Product 1 [HIV-1], a first-generation prototype), by including an arm in each new study for comparison to this product. Doing this has permitted bridging to an integration study and phase I clinical safety data, which had been obtained by the time of regulatory submission of the newer candidates. When biodistribution patterns and clearance patterns of a newer generation product were seen to be similar to Product 1 (HIV-1), even for another disease indication, integration studies were not required to be repeated for each candi-date. As another example of this increased efficiency, although the product tested in Study D did not go forward to clinical trials, this study along with a toxicology study on the same product described in the companion article in this issue supported the conduct of clinical trials with two other products. One of these products is a subset of Product 6 (HIV-1, consisting of four of the six plasmids). The other product is another six-plasmid product, which consists of three plasmids (the clades A, B, and C env genes) expressing the same proteins and three plasmids expressing the clade B gag, pol, and nef genes on separate plasmids (rather than as a fusion protein). This newer generation six-plasmid product contains a different promoter (the CMV/R promoter) than the original Product 6 (HIV-1), but preclinical and clinical data from Product 12 (Ebola, also using the CMV/R promoter), the preclinical data for Product 6 (HIV-1), and the clinical data for the four-plasmid product supported the regulatory approval of the current sixplasmid construct without having to repeat preclinical biodistribution and repeated-dose toxicology studies. These regulatory efficiencies save months in the clinical development pathway of new candidate vaccines.

The primary difference that would be introduced in future integration studies would be to use a larger species (rabbits), so that doses more comparable to the human dose can be delivered and tissue specimens will be of sufficient size that they would not need to be pooled in order to get sufficient amounts of highmolecular weight DNA to perform the analyses.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "DISCUSSION"}, {"text": "Overall, we conclude from these studies that the pattern of biodistribution (confined to the site of injection) and clearance (within 2 months) of DNA plasmid vaccines at doses up to 2 mg delivered by Biojector or needle and syringe is consistent regardless of differences in the promoter in the plasmid backbone or in the gene being expressed by the plasmid vaccine or cytokine adjuvant.
