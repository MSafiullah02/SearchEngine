            "text": "From the few studies describing the aetiology of acute lower respiratory tract infections (LRTIs) in primary care patients, we know that most LRTIs in the general community are caused by viral pathogens, in particular rhinovirus, influenza virus, coronavirus (CoV), respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), human metapneumovirus (hMPV), and parainfluenza virus (PiV)(1,2). The illness course of LRTIs in adults presenting in this setting - a relatively healthy, working population - is mostly self-limiting and complications are rare(3). However, with an average of 3.5 days sick leave per year, LRTIs cause a substantial socio-economic burden(3,4). In adults, influenza virus, bacteria, and viral-bacterial coinfections are assumed to cause the most severe illnesses, with most systemic symptoms, longest illness durations, and most complications(5, 6, 7). However, evidence on associations between aetiology and severity are mainly derived from hospital care settings with vulnerable patient populations(10, 8, 9). In this setting, a focus on pathogens with the highest complication rates is obvious. Quite often, however, this focus is also applied in the general community, with public health interventions as the annual influenza vaccinations targeted at the most vulnerable people with the aim of reducing the risk of complications and death(11). Although data on the impact of respiratory viruses in the primary care setting are limited due to restricted microbial testing and absence of a standardized, validated outcome measure to evaluate illness severity(12), there are studies suggesting that the burden of disease from infections due to respiratory viruses other than influenza \u2013 i.p. rhinovirus, coronavirus and RSV - may be greater overall(13). In this study, we aimed to explore the associations between respiratory viral pathogens, including viral load, and illness course in the adult primary care community, thereby opening up possibilities to base the public health focus on the impact of respiratory viruses in primary care, rather than on extrapolated data from hospital settings. This study was conducted in a large European cohort consisting of prospectively enrolled adult patients with acute cough and/or a clinical suspicion for LRTI.",

Participants were recruited between November 2007 and April 2010 by general practitioners (GPs) from 16 primary care networks in 11 European countries (Supplementary Figure 1). Patients aged \u226518 years presenting with acute cough (duration of \u226428 days) and/or suspected LRTI, were asked to participate in this study, i.e. to fill out study materials and provide written informed consent(14). Exclusion criteria were pregnancy, breast-feeding, any serious immunocompromised condition and antibiotic use in the previous month(14). About one third of these patients agreed to being randomised to either the intervention (amoxicillin) or placebo arm of the original randomized controlled trial(14). Remaining patients were not randomly assigned, but were included in the observational part of the study(1). In the current study, both trial and observational patients were analysed together, but patients without PCR and/or serology results on viral aetiology (all due to practical reasons) were excluded. Ethical approval was obtained for all participating networks.",

Additionally, the symptoms confusion/disorientation and diarrhoea were rated. Following initial presentation, patients were asked to fill out a symptom diary at home on a daily basis until they had no more symptoms or until the end of follow-up (day 28). Patients were asked to rate the same 12 symptoms by using a 7-point Likert-scale (0=normal, 1=very little problem, 2=slight problem, 3=moderately bad, 4=bad, 5=very bad, 6=as bad as it could be).

Swabs were placed in universal transport medium immediately, frozen locally, and transported on dry ice to the central laboratory (University of Antwerp). Real-time in-house polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) testing was performed either as four multiplex RT-PCRs (combining INF-A, INF-B, and RSV; PIV1-4; HRV, hMPV, and the EAV internal control; and finally the human CoV: 229E, OC43, NL63, and HKU1), or as monoplex (all other viruses) (16). RNA/DNA extractions and amplification methods were described previously(1,16). Based on the results from our study comparing the prevalence of viral pathogens between symptomatic and asymptomatic matched controls(1), we evaluated rhinoviruses, influenza viruses, coronaviruses, RSV, hMPV and PiV. Since (pan-)adenovirus (1.3% vs. 1.1%, p=0.33), bocavirus (0.6% vs. 0.8%, p=0.43) and WU/KI polyomaviruses (2.2% vs. 2.5%, p=0.02) were not detected more frequently in symptomatic patients than in controls, they were not considered pathogenic respiratory viruses and therefore excluded from our analyses(1). A cycle threshold (Ct) value - an inverse, logarithmic, quantitative measurement of viral load \u2013 below 45 was chosen as cut-off for a positive result. We adjusted our analyses for bacterial infections, which were defined as having at least one of the following pathogens detected in a sputum or nasopharyngeal sample: Streptococcus species, Gram-negative species, or Aspergillus (fungus). Commensals and Candida species were considered contaminants for which analyses were not adjusted. Microbiologists who determined the results were blinded to clinical information.",

Among patients in whom a virus was detected, a ten cycles lower Ct value \u2013 i.e. a higher viral load \u2013 measured at presentation, was associated with a 0.11 (95%CI 0.06-0.16) point higher mean symptom severity as compared to patients without detected virus. After stratification for viral aetiology, we only observed an association between viral load and symptom severity for rhinovirus (increase of 0.12 per 10 cycles reduction in Ct value, 95%CI 0.04-0.20) and for RSV (increase of 0.16 per 10 cycles reduction in Ct value, 95%CI 0.01-0.30).

However, although we do not provide recommendations on clinical management or treatment, we do think that the large number of patients included in this study provides important information which can be used to prioritize different respiratory viruses in the primary care setting. Currently, public health resources in the general community are guided by the aim to prevent complications in the most vulnerable people, and are focused almost exclusively on influenza(11,22,23). From a socio-economic perspective, however, targeting public health resources only at influenza virus neglects the substantial illness course in the community caused by other respiratory viruses. From our results we conclude that RSV and hMPV impose a disease burden that compares well to that of influenza virus and should therefore receive more attention in the primary care setting, e.g. by supporting the development and implementation of prevention approaches like vaccines(24, 25, 26).",

            "text": "Despite the fact that we had a large cohort in which data were collected in a standardized manner, and outcome measures were in line with previous studies(14,17, 18, 19), there are several potential sources of bias that might limit the validity of our results. Firstly, it is possible that non-agreement of patients to participate in this observational study was not random. The extent to which this selection might be present is uncertain since we have no information on the number and characteristics of patients who declined participation. Secondly, the use of medication, such as antibiotic treatment, antiviral treatment, (over-the-counter) symptomatic treatment, and prophylactic antibiotics with antiviral effects (as azithromycin) might have influenced outcomes. We consider it unlikely that receiving antibiotics caused biased results, since the in-study amoxicillin trial showed no differences in outcomes between the intervention and placebo group(14). Since only two patients in our cohort were prescribed antivirals (oseltamivir), we consider the effect of antiviral treatment also negligible. Unavailability of data on the use of prophylactic antibiotics and symptomatic medication made adjustment for these factors impossible. Thirdly, there might be bias in the self-report of symptoms by patients. However, previous studies showed a high internal reliability, validity and sensitivity of the symptom diary we used(15). Also, since the 95/207 (46%) patients who did not meet the event criteria and who did not fill out their symptom diary completely were censored for the analysis, we do not expect selection bias due to loss of follow-up. Fourthly, the required sample size for the prospective observational cohort was not determined on the specific requirements of the current study. Hence, inconclusive or non-significant results can therefore not be considered definite to prove the absence of associations. We specifically choose not to correct for multiple testing, as this correction may further hamper statistical power, especially for viruses only detected in a limited number of patients. Fifthly, the relatively low overall percentage of detected viruses might have been caused by the inclusion of patients with quite long duration of symptoms. Since respiratory fluids are renewed quickly in the patient, viral pathogens in patients with longer duration of symptoms might therefore not have been detectable anymore. Finally, a higher viral load was associated with a higher symptom severity at presentation. Looking at specific viruses we only found this association for RSV and rhinovirus, which confirms previous studies(27, 28, 29). However, the interpretation of single viral load measurements is difficult. Not only are viral loads of respiratory viruses highly dependent on variation in sampling location and technique, they also rise and drop rapidly and it is known that symptoms mostly follow the viral load(30,31).",

In this general community population, RSV and hMPV were associated with a longer duration of moderately bad or severe symptoms. This study emphasizes that public health policies as vaccinations and awareness among GPs should not remain focused on influenza virus exclusively, but should also include other common respiratory viruses like RSV and hMPV that pose a high socio-economic burden to the general adult community.",
