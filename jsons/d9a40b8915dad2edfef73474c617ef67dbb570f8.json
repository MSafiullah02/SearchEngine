Mining suggestions is challenging due to the absence of large labeled and balanced datasets. Furthermore, most prior studies attempting to mine suggestions, have focused on a single domain such as Hotel or Travel only. In this work, we introduce a novel over-sampling technique to address the problem of class imbalance, and propose a multi-task deep learning approach for mining suggestions from multiple domains. Experimental results on a publicly available dataset show that our over-sampling technique, coupled with the multi-task framework outperforms state-of-the-art open domain suggestion mining models in terms of the F-1 measure and AUC.",

These reviews may include useful suggestions that can help companies better understand consumer needs and improve their products and services. However, manually mining suggestions amid vast numbers of non-suggestions can be cumbersome, and equated to finding needles in a haystack. Therefore, designing systems that can automatically mine suggestions is essential. The recent SemEval [6] challenge on Suggestion Mining saw many researchers using different techniques to tackle the domain-specific task (in-domain Suggestion Mining). However, open-domain suggestion mining, which obviates the need for developing separate suggestion mining systems for different domains, is still an emerging research problem. We formally define the problem of open-domain suggestion mining as follows: Building on the work of [5] , we design a framework to detect suggestions from multiple domains. We formulate a multitask classification problem to identify both the domain and nature (suggestion or non-suggestion) of reviews. Furthermore, we also propose a novel language model-based text over-sampling approach to address the class imbalance problem.",

To this end, studies frequently utilize Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique (SMOTE) [1] to over-sample the minority class samples using the text embeddings as features. However, SMOTE works in Table 1 . Datasets and their sources used in our study [5] . The class ratio column highlights the extent of class imbalance in the datasets. The travel datasets have lower inter-annotator agreement than the rest, indicating that they may contain confusing reviews which are hard to confidently classify as suggestions or non-suggestions. This also reflects in our classification results. the euclidean space and therefore does not allow an intuitive understanding and representation of the over-sampled data, which is essential for qualitative and error analysis of the classification models. We introduce a novel over-sampling technique, Language Model-based Over-sampling Technique (LMOTE), exclusively for text data and note comparable (and even slightly better sometimes) performance to SMOTE. We use LMOTE to over-sample the number of suggestions before training our classification model. For each domain, LMOTE uses the following procedure to over-sample suggestions:",
