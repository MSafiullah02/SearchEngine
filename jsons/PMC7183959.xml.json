With regard to academic activities, the March annual EAU congress has been postponed and will go virtual in July. The ESRU bi-annual meeting has been cancelled and upcoming national conferences (eg, SIU live, April; UroAktuell, April; AEU, June; BAUS, June) are also cancelled, postponed, or taking place as webinars. University laboratories are closed and in the UK, those in PhD programmes have been asked to return to clinical practice. National courses are cancelled and the UK postgraduate fellowship examination has been postponed, affecting those who require it to obtain a certificate of completion of training. There are currently no plans yet regarding cancellation of the Fellow of the European Board of Urology (FEBU) part 2 examination in Poland (June 2020), FEBU part 1 in November 2020, or the European Urology Residents Education Programme course in September 2020. In Italy and Spain, attempts to maintain training have been made through online smart-learning circuits, webinars, and video calls. In France, residents in regions with low rates of infection have up to 50% of their time for research, hands-on training, and study. Those who have subspecialty clinical or research fellowships planned locally or abroad are unable to attend. Hospital rotations within the country have been postponed.",

However, redeployment appears to have occurred in all five countries, with urology trainees allocated to cover medical/COVID-19 wards. Some urology departments have merged with other surgical specialties. In Paris, urology trainees are allocated to emergencies for triage and to intensive care units. Some residents are involved in transfer convoys across France when full capacity is reached. In some UK departments, trainees are attending local training to refresh their life support and respiratory skills. Final-year medical students are graduating early, retired UK doctors and nurses are returning to the National Health Service (NHS), and the first of eight NHS Nightingale Hospitals opened in London on April 3, 2020 to accommodate the influx of new cases. The rate of burnout among urology trainees (40%) is relatively high compared to other specialties, and the current pandemic and changes in work plans will no doubt contribute to resident burnout [4]. Trainees must know their limitations and are under no obligations to work beyond their limits.",

Slowdown of the learning curve of residents is inevitable, so adoption of smart learning is critical. For those who have been affected by examination delays we recommend continuing to revise steadily using webinars, podcasts, prerecorded sessions, and social media. Routine activities such as journal clubs and departmental teaching should continue through webinars if possible. The online E-BLUS theoretical course and the use of departmental simulators are vital resources to keep surgical skills going and prepare for the E-BLUS examination. In addition, the EAU education section (https://uroweb.org/education/online-education/) has accredited education platforms (UROONCO and UROLUTS), e-courses, surgical videos, and recorded webinars to facilitate e-learning. Video-based surgical demonstrations are also available on the EAU Surgery in Motion School (https://surgeryinmotion-school.org/) site (Table 1\n). With the new era of technology and smart learning, the effects on resident training can hopefully be kept to a minimum.",
