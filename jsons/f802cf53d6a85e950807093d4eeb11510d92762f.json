This is distinct from HLH associated with immunodeficiency states termed primary HLH -with radically different therapy strategies in both situations. COVID-19 infection with MAS typically occurs in subjects with adult respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and historically, non-survival in ARDS was linked to sustained IL-6 and IL-1 elevation. We provide a model for the classification of MAS to stratify the MAS-like presentation in COVID-19 pneumonia and explore the complexities of discerning ARDS from MAS. We discuss the potential impact of timing of anti-cytokine therapy on viral clearance and the impact of such therapy on intra-pulmonary macrophage activation and emergent pulmonary vascular disease.",

Given the lack of a vaccine or proven effective anti-viral therapy and non-existent herd immunity, anti-cytokine therapy, most notably anti-IL-6 and others including IL-1 antagonism have been proposed for mitigating against the hyper-inflammation that may develop in conjunction with this virally induced ARDS [1, 2] . The backdrop for cytokine antagonism of hyper-inflammation in non-immunodeficient patients emerged in children with systemic onset juvenile inflammatory arthritis (sJIA) also known as Stills disease where a severe hyer-cytokinemic inflammatory state variously termed as a cytokine storm, macrophage activation syndrome (MAS) or secondary haemophagocytic lymphohistocytosis (sHLH) may occur [3] [4] [5] . Impressive responses to antagonism of either IL-6 or IL-1 have been reported in sJIA [6, 7] .",

(Fig. 1A ) Clinical and laboratory parameters in the MAS/sHLH phenotype are similar to primary HLH but the latter is invariably autosomal recessive, presenting in childhood, and is typically due to mutations that impair NK and CD8+ cytotoxic T-cell function [9] [10] [11] , although there are emergent overlaps. As the focus of this perspective is restricted to IL-6 in potential MAS in COVID-19 related pneumonia, the reader is referred to several recent articles on primary and secondary HLH and sJIA with MAS [12] [13] [14] [15] .",

Furthermore, a MAS/sHLH has been described in the related SARS coronavirus sufferers in prior studies [26, 27] . In common with the disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) associated with MAS/HLH, there is evidence of D-dimer level elevation in COVID-19 pneumonia which might represent an extension of this novel virally induced hyper-inflammatory pulmonary immunopathology to the adjacent microcirculation with extensive secondary fibrinolytic activation (Fig. 1B) . This emerging COVID-19 immunopatholgoy could thus be associated with extensive pulmonary microthrombosis rather than the DIC that typically occurs with advanced MAS. The MAS that supervenes COVID-19 pneumonia is mostly anatomically compartmentalized to the lungs and thorax making clinical recognition difficult from ARDS and indeed for fully disentangling the precise pathological picture(19), (Fig. 1) , which in some cases could be possibly mixed.",

In patients with ARDS (not generally due to viral pneumonia, but other causes) the elevation in baseline plasma levels of IL-6 predicted a poor survival [29] as did even higher bronchoalveolar (BAL) fluid levels indicating a pulmonary, rather than systemic origin for these cytokines in ARDS pathology [30] . Therefore, the overlapping cytokine profiles between severe ARDS and MAS/sHLH may limit the utility of cytokine profiling in the differentiation between both conditions and many of the laboratory changes reported in COVID-19 could predominantly reflect ARDS.

At first glance, the notion of hyper-inflammation in the face of immunodeficiency seems counter-intuitive, but that is exactly what happens in primary HLH. Inflammation against self occurs along an immunological disease continuum with pure innate and pure adaptive immunity at opposite Panel A). The MAS/sHLH picture is associated with viral and other infections that does not have a special tropism for pulmonary tissues. The hyper-activation of Tcells is associated with lymphoid organ hyperplasia with hepatosplenomegaly and adenopathy. The resulting excessive reticuloendothelial system activity manifests as bone marrow haemophagocytosis and deranged liver function tests, deranged lipid profiles as a result of liver Kupffer cell dysfunction. Systemically circulating activated macrophages contribute to disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC). A similar picture can develop in primary HLH that represents a rare group of immunodeficiency, linked to impaired cytolytic activity due to perforin pathway loss of function, with expansion of immune cells and the lymphoid organs that house them. In primary HLH, cytokine antagonism used with anti-microbial therapy may temporarily help prior to definitive bone marrow transplantation. Pulmonary involvement may be a feature of both pHLH and sHLH. Panel B). There is evidence for MAS/sHLH emerging in the COVID-19 setting that is supported by the abnormal laboratory parameters without reporting of the classical organomegaly pattern described in Fig. 1A . Hyperactivation and over-zealous immune activity appears to be more confined to the lung parenchyma and immediately adjacent bronchial alveolar lymphoid tissue and is associated with ARDS development. Pulmonary haemophagocytosis has has been occasionally reported in human coronavirus infection but not yet been reported in COVID-19 associated pneumonia [56] . .It is proposed that severe widespread alveolar and interstitial inflammation extends to the closely juxtaposed pulmonary vasculature. The normal circulatory fibrinogen levels and regional fibrinolysis with elevated D-dimer formation seen in early COVID-19 pneumonia is not a feature of typical acute onset MAS/HLH. This MAS-like intra-pulmonary inflammation might influence a propensity towards severe local vascular dysfunction including micro-thrombosis and haemorrhage resulting in a lung centric pulmonary intravascular coagulopathy (PIC) presentation rather than a DIC presentation boundaries [31] . Within these clear boundaries it is possible to stratify immune responses as being loss of function, normal or gain of function which then permits a better conceptual understanding of the integrated workings of the system [32] (Fig. 3) .",

The related SARS-CoV virus open reading frame (ORF) and N proteins, act as antagonists to the interferon pathway by regulating IFN-\u03b2 synthesis and signalling [36] which was mirrored in another experimental model [37] .

Interleukin-6 also plays an important role in lung repair responses following viral or chemical insults indicating that timing of administration of anti-IL6R could impact on proper tissue remodeling (Table 1 ). In human epithelial cells, SARS-CoV was able to induce greater IL-6 when compared to Influenza-A virus and human parainfluenza virus type 2, but interestingly induced less SOC3 than other viruses, suggesting a potential basis for exaggerated IL-6 responses with this family of viruses [43] .",

The biology of IL-6 is complex with cytokine engagement of membrane anchored IL-6R and gp130 co-receptor being known to have tissue homeostatic and repair responses [44] . However, many non-immune cells including stromal and epithelial cells can induce marked inflammatory responses when soluble IL-6R-IL-6 anchors to membrane gp130 in what is termed trans-signalling. This engagement potently activates inflammatory responses [45] (Fig. 4B) . Reports indicate that murine pulmonary stromal cells including myofibroblasts signal via both IL-6R and trans signalling but type 2 pneumocytes lack the soluble membrane IL-6 receptor indicating that these signals exclusively via IL-6R trans signalling [46] (Fig. 4D) . Given that trans signalling typically drives inflammatory reactions this may impact on COVID-19 immunity [47] [48] [49] .",

Furthermore, the recognition of MAS/sHLH is problematic in COVID-19 pneumonia cases with the severe inflammation emanating from the pulmonary compartment mimicking MAS, but the lack of other classical systemic clinical features making MAS presentation atypical and diagnosis more difficult. Consequently, many cases receiving anti-IL-6R or other cytokine inhibitors therapy may have severe infection related ARDS without superimposed MAS. Although inflammation is more lung centered, than multi-organ, the argument for IL-6 involvement in COVID-19 related MAS comes from biochemical parameters changes including ferritin and the preliminary open reports of anti-IL6R efficacy [28, 50] . We appear to be dealing with a pulmonary pathology distinct from MAS with DIC with both the macrophage activation and [20] and independently found in the MAS spectrum and many other settings including sepsis [17] . Cytokines including IL-6 may be substantially elevated in isolated ARDS. The magnitude of cytokine level changes may not be reliable in the differentiation from other cause of elevated cytokine levels including severe infection or tissue destruction and dependable cut-off values do not exist. Superimposed second viral or bacterial infections in either setting may further drive systemic cytokine responses. Therefore, phase 3 studies based on elevated IL-6 levels may encompass a group of ARDS cases without the bone fide MAS phenotype [57] . associated coagulopathy being more cantered on the lung and not systemic ( Figure 1B) .",

            "text": "It is presently unclear if elevated IL-6 levels are detrimental or beneficial in COVID-19 pneumonia. In experimental model systems, IL-6 can either suppress or facilitate viral replication [49] , so studies on COVID-9 are urgently needed. Timing of anti-IL-6R, if too early might adversely affect viral clearance which needs to be assessed in trials. If it emerges that blocking IL-6R early in the course of COVID pneumonia MAS-like disease has a detrimental impact on type-2 pneumocyte antiviral immunity, then local augmentation of IL-6 could be considered. Such are the complexities that only trial results will clarify. In this perspective we focused on IL-6 and its relationship to the COVID-19 MAS-like pathology but several other relevant cytokines including Il-18, IFN\u03b3, and the JAK1 pathway critically control The HLH responses can occur in the setting of both immunodeficiency states and in immunocompetence settings and following adaptive immune system engineering (Panel A and B in blue). In humans with defects in NK and CD8+ T-cells, the inability to kill virally infected cells results in primary HLH with hyper-cytokinaemia that can't be cured with anti-cytokine strategies as genetic defect typically in perforin pathway machinery makes pathogen elimination impossible [58] (Panel A). In CAR-T cell therapy hyper proliferating engineered T-cells may drive MAS/sHLH that only lasts for the duration of the presence of detectable tumour antigen (Panel B). Similar mechanisms may occur in sJIA or autoimmune diseases, but this remains to be fully defined. This model is based on the immunological disease continuum modified for gain or loss of function in innate or adaptive immunity (Reference 43). When COVID-19 hyper-inflammatory or cytokine storm reactions are viewed through the lens of primary and secondary HLH, it is noteworthy that virally induced immunosuppression may play a key role (Panel C). Coronavirus family members including COVID-19 pneumonia is associated with robust interferon suppression, blood lymphopenia including NK cell abnormalities. Such scenarios likely drive macrophage infiltration and the \"second wave\" of non-type-1 interferon pathway cytokines including IL-6, IL-1, IL-18, INF\u03b3, GM-CSF and others that lead to a blood hyper-cytokinaemic picture (Panel B). It remains to be seen how many cases of COVID-19 related fatalities have mutations in genes associated with the primary HLH disorders and thus closely resemble primary HLH (Panel A). Based on persistent viral shedding from the respiratory tract during CORVID-19 related disease, then an exaggerated immune response including IFN driven and T-cell driven responses that clears the virus but induces pulmonary immune system collateral damage and ARDS offers an explanation for the more typical MAS/sHLH phenotype. Viral clearance in the face of marked hyper-inflammation would be expected in the face of brisk anti-viral antigen responses.",

Antagonism of either IFN\u03b3 or IL-18 that may be upstream of IL-6 and IL-1 has been associated with efficacy in human HLH and SJIA [53, 54] . Both the short term and long-term outcome of trials of IL-6 blockers in COVID-19 pneumonia are eagerly awaited to clarify nature of the MASlike state. If a MAS-like state exists and excessive IL-6 levels are detrimentalwhy shouldn't corticosteroids be first line therapy as these will vigerously suppress IL-6 and a raft of other cytokines? Although the recent open label study from Wu and colleagues showed a benefit for corticosteroids, the consensus is that these should not be used based on clinical experience in SARS-CoV, MER-CoV and other infections including influenza and respiratory syncytial virus infection, where collectively there is evidence for delayed viral clearance [20, 55] . The MAS-like state in COVID-19 exhibits features of both primary and secondary HLH with death being linked to respiratory viral persistence . Some experimental models of viral pulmonary infection triggering ARDS show that IL-6 may have a protective role with its blockade increasing mortality including reduction and phagocytosis and increased fibrosis depending on model. Panel B). Bacterial, rather than viral infections, originating outside the lung that also trigger ARDS but in this setting IL-6 blockade may be beneficial. The latter is more akin to classical MAS/sHLH where pulmonary pathology, when present, may be due to exogenous factors. However, the fact that IL-6 is detrimental in murine virally induced ARDS cannot be extrapolated to the novel COVID-19 virus infection that shows a tropism for type 2 pneumocytes (Panel C). The COVID-19 suppression of first line interferon responses and abrogation of T-cell responses suggests a role for type 2 pneunocyte gp130 receptor expression and IL-6 in pulmonary pathology [59] . Also in experimental models, IL-6 may either suppress or facilitate viral replication depending on the virus [49] , so data on COVID-19 related disease is eagerly awaited.
