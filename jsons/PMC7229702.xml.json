Widespread insecticide resistance has been reported in the important malaria vectors across all classes of insecticides used on insecticide-treated bednets and indoor residual spraying [3\u20136]. Further, outdoor feeding and resting by malaria vectors, whether in response to use of insecticide-treated bednets [7\u201310] or as a natural behaviour in some vector populations, expose people to residual malaria transmission. This has led to global advocacy for additional vector control tools to eliminate residual malaria transmission by targeting outdoor resting and feeding, as well as insecticide-resistant vectors [9]. Larval source management (LSM) indiscriminately kills malaria vectors before they emerge as adult mosquitoes [11] and relies on separate modes of action from those used in insecticide-treated bednets and indoor residual spraying. Thus, LSM can contribute to malaria control where the vectors exhibit exophagic and exophilic behaviours, and in settings where insecticide resistance has emerged.",

Israelensis (Bti) are widely used as active ingredients in larvicides because they do not cause harm to non-target organisms or the environment [12, 13]. The bacteria produce parasporal crystalline protein inclusions (Cry and Cyt) which are lethal only to specific insect taxa [14]. In mosquitoes, the protein crystals bind to specific receptors exposed on the surface of the plasma membrane and then insert into the membrane, creating lytic pores in microvilli of apical membranes [15] that disturb the cell\u2019s osmotic balance, resulting in cell lysis and consequently death of the larvae [16, 17]. The low persistence of Bti toxins under field conditions [18] makes Bti an eco-friendly larvicide even when used in repeated treatments from three to seven years [19]. This rapid degradation, however, necessitates repeated applications of the larvicide for effective control of target organisms.",

Nutritional and larvicidal stresses can reduce adult size, survival and fecundity in different mosquito species [23\u201326]. One such larvicidal stressor could be sublethal doses of Bti. Sublethal Bti concentrations reduce adult mosquito survival rates, lower blood-engorgement rate and egg production, increase development time from egg to adult, and decrease offspring sex ratio in Aedes aegypti [27]. Similarly, sublethal doses of Bti may cause adverse effects on life parameters of exposed Ae. aegypti and their unexposed first-generation progeny [26]. Prolonged development time, reduced longevity and reduced reproductive rates were observed in Anopheles superpictus exposed to sublethal doses of Bti [28].",

These doses may result directly or indirectly in biological changes in the surviving larvae and consequently impact adult fitness.

The females in each cage were given a chance to feed on human blood via arm feeding for 10 min per day for two days. The same person was used for all the blood-feeding. The mosquitoes were also provided with 6% sugar solution in the new cages when not blood-feeding. At 24 h after blood-feeding, oviposition cups were introduced in the cages and 25 randomly selected gravid females were kept in the cage. The other five females were taken back to the non-oviposition cages which contained mosquitoes which were not given blood meals. All dead mosquitoes from day of emergence in both oviposition and non-oviposition cages were counted daily until 37 days post-emergence. The records were separated by treatment, replicate and sex. The number of eggs laid was counted daily for seven days and separated by treatment and replicate. Wing lengths were measured of 570 mosquitoes as the distance between the alula and the wing tip, excluding fringe scales, using CMEX DC 5000 binocular microscope (Euromex, The Netherlands) and Image Focus Version 3 software. The wing measurements were separated by treatment, replicate and sex of the mosquitoes.",

We observed that larval exposure to sublethal Bti doses reduced survival of adult An. coluzzii mosquitoes. For both male and female An. coluzzii, the lowest survival probability was recorded at the highest Bti concentration. It is not well understood how the larvicide reduces longevity of the adults that survive exposure as larvae. However, there is evidence that a Bti toxin, Cry1C, has a toxic effect to brain cells of larvae of a lepidopteran, Lymantria dispar, in vitro [31]. This suggests that Bti may cause similar damage to the adult mosquitoes surviving larval exposure to sublethal doses which may reduce their life spans. Similar results have been reported for Culex quinquefasciatus exposed to sublethal doses of cypermethrin as both larvae and adults [32]. The authors attributed their findings to physiological damage caused to the nervous system and associated aberrations due to abnormal hormone release and dehydration as a result of exposure to cypermethrin. Malaria parasites require 8\u201335 days to develop in their anopheline hosts [33], and therefore reduced adult longevity is widely recognized to reduce the vectorial capacity of a vector population [34]. Under highly controlled laboratory conditions, 10% and 37% female mortalities were observed by day 15 in the control and LC70 groups, respectively, suggesting that the sublethal doses can potentially contribute to reductions in malaria parasite transmission by reducing the longevity of adults.",

Similar findings were observed in adult female Ae. aegypti mosquitoes exposed to sublethal concentrations of a naturally derived insecticide, spinosad [35]. The larger mosquitoes emerging from larval development at higher sublethal Bti concentrations may have at least two explanations. First, larger mosquito larvae may be more capable of coping with any stress induced by Bti exposure, and therefore survived exposure to concentrations that smaller larvae could not. Secondly, Bti treatment reduced larval densities and, thus, competition over food and other resources following Bti exposure. Reduced resource competition due to lower larval densities has previously been associated with larger mosquito size [36, 37]. Wing length is used as a standard indicator of body size in mosquitoes [38, 39] as the two measures are positively correlated. Larger females typically produce more eggs because they can take larger blood meals, which means they contribute more offspring to the population [40, 41]. Larger size has also been related with better ability to disperse in Culex pipiens [42]. The potential increase in oviposition rates and dispersal ability for larger mosquitoes may increase their contribution to malaria transmission. Additionally, larger mosquitoes may exhibit reduced susceptibility to the synthetic insecticides used in current vector control tools [43, 44], although it is unclear how this effect might interact with the reduced survival of An. coluzzii exposed to sublethal concentrations of Bti observed in our study. It is also known that smaller female mosquitoes require multiple blood meals before they can reproduce, thus increasing their contact with hosts and effectively becoming more efficient vectors [37]. Therefore, the impact of larger adult An. coluzzii mosquitoes on malaria parasite transmission due to sublethal Bti concentrations remains unclear.",

Similar findings have been observed in another malaria vector, An. superpictus, also exposed to sublethal concentrations of Bti as larvae under laboratory conditions [28]. Also, the results agree with observations made on Ae. aegypti under similar conditions [26]. Our study might have been limited by clustering of the 25 gravid females in an oviposition cage containing only one oviposition cup. Clustering of females in a cage might have led to egg retention in some of the females as a way of avoiding competition for oviposition space. Evidence of egg retention has been reported in gravid female mosquitoes in absence of suitable oviposition sites [45]. The mean wing length of gravid females also was not associated with the number of eggs laid per cage. The averaging of wing lengths of gravid females might have masked small but meaningful variations in wing sizes due to treatments. Despite not significantly explaining differences in the egg counts between control and treatment groups, we observed a declining trend in median number of eggs laid with increasing Bti concentrations. This effect deserves further study, as a reduction in the number of eggs with larval exposure to Bti would directly reduce vector population size.",

It remains important to apply the recommended dosage when applying Bti for malaria vector control, as concentrations high enough to kill larvae before they emerge as adults provide the most effective control against malaria parasite transmission.
