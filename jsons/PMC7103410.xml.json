The expression of M, E, and S in Sf9 insect cells was sufficient for formation of pseudoparticles (Mortola and Roy, 2004), whereas, only M and N were required in mammalian cells (Huang et al., 2004). Replication of SARS-CoV may be controlled by modifying the interaction between the M and N proteins. Using a mammalian two-hybrid system, the region of N bound to M (amino acids 168\u2013208) was found to contain a serine/arginine-rich motif (amino acids 184\u2013196) (He et al., 2004b). The same region was necessary for self-multimerization of N (He et al., 2004a). Analysis using a yeast two-hybrid system and surface plasmon resonance techniques showed that amino acids 351\u2013422 of N interacted with amino acids 197\u2013221 of M and that the C-terminal region of N (amino acids 343\u2013402) was necessary for its oligomerization (Luo et al., 2006b).",

One possible target is inhibition of virion formation. In mammalian cells, the interaction between N and M, the major structural proteins of SARS-CoV, is critical for the formation of pseudoparticles (Huang et al., 2004). To dissect this interaction at the sub-molecular level, we analyzed the interaction of M with peptides derived from N, and found that 101\u2013115 showed significant binding to M. We also examined whether various N peptides could interact with M protein to form pseudoparticles. The results of the present study indicated that although N peptides 1\u2013150, 151\u2013300, and 301\u2013422 can bind to M, only the latter is required for pseudoparticle formation.",

In mammalian cells, the formation of SARS-CoV pseudoparticles requires a minimum of two proteins, N and M (Huang et al., 2004). Using buoyant density gradient analysis and TEM, we observed pseudoparticle formation when M was coexpressed with N wild-type, N\u0394(101\u2013115), or N301\u2013422 in HEK293 cells, indicating that the N protein segment of amino acids 301\u2013422 was the minimum requirement for pseudoparticle formation. Based on these findings, we propose a model for the assembly of SARS-CoV pseudoparticles by N and M (Fig. 7\n). N1\u2013150 binds to M via the 101\u2013115 region, as demonstrated in this study. N151\u2013300 binds to M via the 168\u2013208 region as reported previously (He et al., 2004b). N151\u2013300 is also capable of forming homodimers but not oligomers. However, this binding is not sufficient to support pseudoparticle formation in mammalian cells (Fig. 5B). In contrast, N301\u2013422 is capable of forming pseudoparticles. The differences among the N regions are probably based on the ability to form homooligomers. N301\u2013422 contains a region capable of homotetramer formation (He et al., 2004a). The tetramers of N would provide scaffolds for the formation of pseudoparticles for M. Indeed, N colocalized with M in buoyant density gradients formed SDS-resistant oligomers (data not shown).",

We examined the abilities of these peptides to inhibit pseudoparticle formation by N and M via either peptide delivery or expression.

Interestingly, the peptide (101\u2013115) also inhibited the interaction between M and other N mutants, not containing the 101\u2013115 region. Recombinant cytoplasmic region of the M protein used in this study consisted of only 116 amino acid residues. Thus, one possibility to explain this phenomenon is that M has only one site to bind N in the molecule and the site is shared by several regions in N for their interaction; the 101\u2013115 peptide may occupy this site to inhibit access of N to M.",
