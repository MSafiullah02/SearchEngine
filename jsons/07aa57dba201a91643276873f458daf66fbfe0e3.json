This resulted in either excessive worries or in obliviousness to the warnings. Second, older adults attended family gatherings during the Chinese New Year. Such types of social activities increased their risk of being exposed to virus transmission which then resulted in quarantine and isolation in case of suspected or confirmed cases of the virus. Third, the strict security measures in the community prevented outdoor social activities, such as square dancing, park exercises, and parties. Fourth, the extended lock-down rules in nursing homes blocked face-to-face communications between older adults and their families (Ministry of Civil Affairs of China, 2020). Last, but not least, some older adults who lived alone or did not have close relatives lost their domestic helpers who were prohibited from traveling, or were in quarantine themselves, upon returning from lockdown areas.",

For example, people with psychosis may become overly suspicious while in quarantine; people with depression and anxiety may feel more stressed and depressed; people with hypochondria are likely to have more physical concerns; people with cognitive decline or dementia may present more challenging behaviors. They could not get access to care support as usual due to social distancing. In addition, limited access to clinical services may have reduced compliance to prescribed medications of those affected by mental disorders (Yang et al., 2020) . Therefore, the social consequence of the COVID-19 outbreak may put older people with preexisting mental disorders at risk of relapse.",

The Chinese Society of Geriatric Psychiatry, in collaboration with the Chinese Society of Psychiatry, the Chinese Psychiatrist Association, and the Chinese Association for Mental Health, responded to the crisis promptly with an interdisciplinary solution. Mental health professionals, social workers, nursing home administrators, and volunteers delivered mental health and psychosocial support (MHPSS) for older adults collaboratively, especially for community-dwelling residents and nursing-home residents. Within a team, geriatric mental health professionals took the lead and supported the team members coming from other disciplines. The competences and the roles of each type of health professionals during the COVID-19 outbreak were as follows: First, the multidisciplinary experts developed a psychosocial self-help guidebook as support for older adults. The book, both in printed and audible format, was offered free online . In addition, the five societies mentioned above developed expert recommendations on MHPSS for persons with cognitive disorders (Chinese Society of Geriatric Psychiatry et al., 2020). These documents served as a guide to senior citizens, their caregivers, as well as professionals.",
