Abstract J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f 2 Background: So far, one of the major drawbacks of the available molecular assays for the diagnosis of severe acute respiratory syndrome Coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) is the need for viral nucleic acid extractionfrom clinical specimens. Objective: The aim of this study was to evaluate the performances of a newly designed real-time RT-PCR (Simplexa\u2122 COVID-19 Direct assay), that is established with an all-in-one reagent mix and no separate extraction required. Results: The lower limit of detection (LOD) for both target genes resulted the same: 3.2 (CI: 2.9 to 3.8) log10 cp/mL and 0.40 (CI: 0.2 to 1.5) TCID50/mL for S gene while 3.2 log10 (CI: 2.9 to 3.7) log10 cp/mL and 0.4 (CI: 0.2 to 1.3) TCID50/mL for ORF1ab. The LOD obtained with extracted viral RNA for both S gene or ORF1ab was 2.7 log10 cp/mL. Crossreactive analysis performed in 20 nasopharyngeal swabs confirmed a 100% of clinical specificity of the assay. Clinical performances of Simplexa\u2122 COVID-19 Direct assay were assessed in 278 nasopharyngeal swabs tested in parallel with Corman's method. Concordance analysis showed an \"almost perfect\" agreement in SARS-CoV-2 RNA detection between the two assays, being \u03ba =0.938; SE =0.021; 95% CI = 0.896-0.980. Conclusions: The high sensitivity and specificity of this new assay indicate that it is promising for laboratory diagnosis, enabling highspeed detection in just over one hour, which is significantly faster than the up to five hours currently required by traditional extraction followed by amplification technologies, thus allowing prompt decision making regarding isolation of infected patients.",

            "text": "The pandemic caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome Coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) has generated global concern given its rapid spread in multiple countries and fatal progression of the Coronavirus infection disease (COVID-19) (1, 2) . However, asymptomatic or paucisymptomatic cases especially in the early phase of the infection have also been reported (3, 4) . Since the spread of SARS-CoV-2 out of China, one of the main concerns on the diagnosis of this new virus has been the development of rapid and sensitive diagnostic assays. So far, nucleic acid amplification testing is the gold standard for the diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 in respiratory samples (5, 6) . Molecular assays as previously demonstrated for epidemics caused by other coronaviruses (SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV), are crucial for rapid application of infection control measures, case identification and contact tracing (6, 7) . However, one of the major drawbacks of these assays is the need for viral nucleic acid extraction from clinical specimens. Recently, DiaSorin S.p.A. (Gerenzano, Italy) has developed a SARS-CoV-2specific real-time RT-PCR (Simplexa\u2122 COVID-19 Direct assay) performed directly on clinical samples.",

More in detail, the LOD for both target genes resulted the same: 3.2 (CI: 2.9 to 3.8) log 10 cp/mL (Fig. 1a) TCID 50 /mL (Fig. 1d) for ORF1ab.

All the SARS-CoV-2 samples resulted positive with the reference test (Corman\"s method), also resulted positive with Simplexa\u2122 COVID-19 Direct assay, with a diagnostic sensitivity of 100% and \"almost perfect\" concordance. Notably, Simplexa\u2122 COVID-19 Direct assay showed a slightly higher sensitivity with respect of the reference test, identifying near 3% additional positive samples. An high performance of the test was also observed using different clinical specimens: among the BAL samples that were able to be analysed by both methods, a perfect agreement was observed; noteworthy, Simplexa\u2122 COVID-19 Direct assay was able to detect the virus in BAL samples resulted invalid with the reference method. The discrepancy in the processing capability between the two systems is attributable to the highly viscous composition of BAL, that could impair its accessibility to a traditional extraction method compared to a faster and easier sample processing method such as that used in the Simplexa\u2122 COVID-19 Direct assay. Moreover a 100% of clinical specificity was observed against swabs resulted positive to other viruses, particularly human coronaviruses, indicating no cross-reactivity with other similar viruses. Key advantages of this assay are simple operation procedures and high-speed of detection in just over an hour, which is significantly faster than the up to seven hours currently required by traditional extraction followed by amplification technologies. The lack of extraction reduces turnaround time (TAT) for the diagnosis of COVID -19, thus allowing prompt decision making regarding isolation of infected patients.",

In this scenario, we have evaluated the performances of the newly designed real-time RT-PCR Simplexa\u2122 COVID-19 Direct assay. Overall, the test is fast, easy-to-use, does not need extra-equipment such as centrifuges or an extraction system, and can be handled by laboratory personal with very little extra training for the procedures and interpretation of results.",
