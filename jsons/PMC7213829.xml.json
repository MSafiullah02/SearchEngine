On 9 January 2020, the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention reported that a new coronavirus had been identified as the causative agent of the respiratory disease. The International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses (ICTV) named the new coronavirus \u2018severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2\u2019 (SARS-CoV-2) and on 11 February the WHO officially called it COVID-19. Since the beginning of the epidemic, 185 countries have been affected and currently more than 2.2 million cases have been confirmed globally, with 156,064 deaths (Johns Hopkins University data). The Ministry of Health in Italy announced tight restrictions for most of the population on 11 March.",

Oxygen pressure was 47 mmHg (normal range 83\u2013108) with a PO2/FO2 of 226 (normal value >300) On the second day of hospitalisation, the patient had an episode of tachycardia with an increase in cardiac laboratory markers: troponin I was 5318 ng/l (normal value <6) and CK-MB was 55 \u03bcg/l (normal value <3). The electrocardiogram showed negative T waves and repolarization phase alterations. An echocardiogram was therefore performed and showed alterations in the left ventricle: apical akinetic expansion (apical ballooning) and hypokinesia of the mid-ventricular segments with slightly reduced systolic function (ejection fraction slightly reduced to 48%) (Fig. 2). The clinical, laboratory and radiological picture was diagnostic for Takotsubo syndrome. Due to the age of the patient, coronary angiography was not possible but treatment with bisoprolol and fondaparinux was started.",
