From past pandemics, it is clear that highly pathogenic zoonoses are major threats to global human health, economic stability and national security1,2,3,4. SARS-CoV and swine influenza virus CA/04/09 H1N1 have caused substantial human morbidity and mortality in the 21st century. Similar to influenza, CoVs have a strong history of host shifting and cross-species transmission5,6. In addition to the emergence of SARS-CoV in 2002, which caused 50% mortality in aged populations, several other human CoVs, such as HCoV-NL63, HCoV-OC43 and HCoV-229E, probably emerged from animal reservoirs within the past 200 years7,8. The sudden emergence of new respiratory viral pathogens from animals underscores the need for new, broadly applicable vaccine strategies that rapidly and rationally attenuate emerging zoonoses, especially to protect vulnerable populations in future outbreaks.",

Live, attenuated viruses are ideal vaccine candidates, as they elicit balanced innate and adaptive lifelong protective immune responses with low production and delivery costs9. Unfortunately, broadly applicable strategies for the rational design of live, attenuated virus vaccines have remained elusive, and vaccines attenuated by chemical treatment or passage can revert to virulence, resulting in disease outbreaks in unvaccinated and immunocompromised populations9. Moreover, the precise mechanism of attenuation often remains unclear; thus, the stability of the attenuation cannot be clearly evaluated or assured.",

High mutation rates generate considerable genomic diversity, allowing RNA viruses to rapidly adapt to changing environmental conditions and hosts12. Increased replication fidelity has been shown to reduce the virulence of poliovirus and chikungunya virus12,13,14 and has been proposed as a strategy for live, attenuated virus design15. CoVs encode the largest known RNA virus genomes (26\u201332 kb), exceeding the theoretical limits of viable RNA genome size11. Mutation rates are lower in CoVs than in other RNA viruses, approaching 2 \u00d7 10\u22126 mutations per site per round of replication16. Nsp14, encoded in the viral replicase gene, contains a 3\u2032\u21925\u2032 exoRNase (ExoN) of the DEDDh exonuclease superfamily17. In addition to the CoVs, ExoN homologs are present in the members of the Nidovirales order, whose genomes are >20 kb, but are not present in the smaller arteriviruses (with genomes of 12\u201316 kb), suggesting that the ExoN had a crucial role in genome expansion16,18. In vitro, 3\u2032\u21925\u2032 exoRNase activity has been demonstrated for recombinant SARS-CoV nsp14 (ref. 19). We have engineered and recovered viable ExoN inactivation mutants from mouse hepatitis virus (MHV-ExoN) and SARS-CoV (Urbani background, SARS-ExoN). Both MHV-ExoN and SARS-ExoN inactivations are maintained stably for more than ten passages in vitro and have 15- to 20-fold increased mutation frequencies compared to wild-type MHV and SARS-CoV16,20. Thus, ExoN has a crucial role in CoV RNA genome replication fidelity in vitro, probably by directly mediating or stimulating proofreading, a function previously unknown among RNA viruses21.",

We compared MAwt, which causes increased mortality and acute respiratory distress in young and aged mouse models22,23,24, and MA-ExoN in in vitro growth experiments (multiplicity of infection (MOI) = 0.1 PFU per cell). MA-ExoN showed a stable growth defect of less than 1 log (Fig. 1c). When placed in direct competition, MA-ExoN was clearly less fit than MAwt over successive rounds of infection (Supplementary Fig. 1a,b). At 6 h after infection (p.i.), MA-ExoN genome RNA levels were roughly equivalent to those of MAwt and were lower than those of MAwt at 12 h p.i.; by 24 h p.i., MA-ExoN genome RNA levels were approximately 10% of those of MAwt (Supplementary Fig. 1c). Thus, the data suggest that MA-ExoN is able to initiate and establish replication efficiently through times of peak RNA synthesis (0\u20136 h) but has impaired accumulation, which manifests late in one round of infection and is amplified over multiple rounds. These results are consistent with accumulating defects resulting from a markedly increased mutation rate (see the Discussion section).",

We then compared MA-ExoN and MAwt infection in aged, immunosenescent mice25. Mice infected with either virus experienced dose-dependent weight loss (Fig. 2c); however, although lung titers were equivalent across all doses of MA-ExoN and MAwt on day 2 p.i., mice infected with MA-ExoN cleared the virus independent of inoculation dose, whereas mice infected with MAwt had begun to clear the virus from higher-titer infections more efficiently at day 4 p.i. than from lower-titer infections (Fig. 2d). Additionally, whereas aged mice infected with MA-ExoN had no mortality, MAwt-infected mice had dose-dependent mortality (Fig. 2e). As described previously23, we found little if any virus in other organs. These experiments demonstrate that MA-ExoN is attenuated in both young and aged diseased mice compared to virulent MAwt and that disease symptoms, when present, are less pronounced in MA-ExoN infections than MAwt infections.",

Therefore, we assessed whether MA-ExoN was attenuated in immunocompromised mice. We used MAwt and MA-ExoN to infect young Rag\u2212/\u2212 (recombination activating gene), severe combined immunodeficiency (SCID) and Stat1\u2212/\u2212 (signal transducer and activator of transcription 1) mice, as well as background controls (C57BL/6, BALB/c and 129 mice, respectively). All MA-ExoN\u2013infected mice had significantly less weight loss than MAwt-infected mice (P < 0.05; Fig. 3a\u2013c and Supplementary Table 1). Only Stat1\u2212/\u2212 mice had any notable weight loss (\u223c15%) as a result of MA-ExoN infection; however, these mice did not pass experimental morbidity thresholds (Fig. 3c). In contrast, all MAwt-infected Stat1\u2212/\u2212 mice died or were moribund by day 9 p.i., but MAwt infection was not lethal in C57BL/6 or 129 control mice (Fig. 3a,c), as has been previously reported22,26. Rag\u2212/\u2212 and SCID mice maintained detectable amounts of MAwt and MA-ExoN virus for 14 d (Rag\u2212/\u2212) or 60 d (SCID) beyond the background controls (Fig. 3d,e) but showed no signs of illness over the course of the experiment despite a lack of viral clearance, expanding earlier reports from our laboratory that MAwt does not clear from Rag\u2212/\u2212 mice26. The rapid clearance of MA-ExoN infection from Stat1\u2212/\u2212 mice (Fig. 3f) further supports the hypothesis that clearance of SARS-CoV infection is dependent on both B and T cells27.",

Mutation accumulations were significantly higher in MA-ExoN\u2013infected mice for both regions (P < 0.01). Additionally, there was a mean 18.3-fold increased accumulation for MA-ExoN across the ORF1a region. When we normalized the accumulations of mutations per 10 kb, MA-ExoN mutation accumulations in the ORF1a compared to the ORF1b region were not significantly different (P = 0.340) but remained significantly increased compared to the accumulation in MAwt (P < 0.001 for both ORF1a and ORF1b). We identified no new mutations in any of the three MA-ExoN plaques, suggesting no obligatory or consistent pattern of adaptation or mutational bias. The most prevalent mutation identified (C16999M) was also present in viral stocks as a polymorphism; however, its frequency in the viral population remained stable (\u223c40%) both in vitro and in vivo and in experiments with both BALB/c and SCID mice (Supplementary Tables 2 and 3 and data not shown). The results from persistent ExoN infection over 30 d were consistent with the results from passage of SARS-ExoN virus in culture: the ratios of accumulation of unique mutations (MA-ExoN:MAwt) during replication in SCID mice ranged from \u223c9.6:1 to 18.3:1, which is similar to the ratio measured between SARS-ExoN and SARS-CoV in culture16.",

We then challenged the mice with a lethal dose of MAwt (Fig. 6). Mock-vaccinated mice succumbed to MAwt challenge by day 3 p.i. and had high lung titers (Fig. 6a,b); however, mice vaccinated with MA-ExoN were protected from illness (Fig. 6a).

However, our results are consistent with the hypothesis that both stable and evolving defects resulting from the mutator phenotype have irrevocably attenuated MA-ExoN. These defects could include (i) mutations that impair or terminate translation, replication and transcription; (ii) mutations that impair or abolish protein functions; or (iii) changes in RNA polymerase processivity in the presence of an inactivated proofreading exonuclease. These combined impairments may be manifested with CoV ExoN mutants, as the high number of accumulated mutations per genome is unprecedented among viral mutator strains. Indeed, the phenotype observed with CoV ExoN inactivation is similar to those reported for other polymerase complexes with inactivated exonucleases, such as human mitochondrial DNA polymerase \u03b3 (pol \u03b3)32,33 and bacteriophage T7 DNA polymerase34,35,36. In pol \u03b3 studies, the loss of proofreading was associated with impaired polymerase activity in a manner that was probably causal, impossible to uncouple and characterized by decreased speed, increased template dissociation and restricted access of nucleotides to the polymerase active site32,33. For CoVs, the high levels of iterative amplification of both genomic and subgenomic RNA would further accelerate these deleterious processes by providing aberrant templates. The loss of ExoN proofreading would continuously generate new potentially attenuating alleles, and defective genomes and would reduce both genome fitness and the risks for primary and secondary reversions to virulence.",

Although our in vivo experiments with MAwt recapitulated many of the phenotypes observed in aged and immunocompromised human populations, additional testing of MA-ExoN as a vaccine in primates will be necessary to further confirm its stability in vivo37. Experiments in SCID mice with persistent MA-ExoN infection verified the accumulation of mutations across the genome without evidence for the selection of either phenotypic virulence-enhancing alleles or primary genotypic reversion. Viruses harvested after passage remained avirulent, supporting the conclusions that (i) selection for virulence is not occurring; (ii) selection is being outcompeted by the gradual accumulation of attenuating mutations in individual genomes or the population mutational swarm; or (iii) the mutant is unable to generate or select for either fast-growing or slow-clearing viruses that are also more virulent. Not surprisingly, we identified a limited number of polymorphisms in the MA-ExoN virus stock that we used in subsequent experiments. Viruses with and without these mutations were fully attenuated in vivo, and the mutations were also maintained in lungs in the same frequencies as in the virus stock, suggesting that they were not selected against during passage in vivo. Thus, no single mutation or polymorphism could be clearly linked to viral attenuation except for the ExoN inactivation.",

In addition, MA-ExoN harvested from persistently infected SCID mice retained an attenuated phenotype when re-inoculated into young BALB/c mice, suggesting that persistence does not select for virulence. Future studies are necessary to address whether additional modifications could enhance and stabilize the attenuated phenotype by reducing the likelihood of gain of function by homologous recombination, such as introduction of the ExoN inactivation in a background with rewired transcriptional regulatory sequences38, which could increase resistance to reversion.",
