            "text": "Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) is an emergent respiratory viral disease that was first reported in Asia during February 2003 and quickly spread to many countries in North and South America, Europe, and Asia. Through December 2003, this global epidemic had resulted in 8098 reported probable cases, of which 774 were fatal [1]. Various reports have described diffuse alveolar damage as the main histopathologic finding in patients with SARS [2], [3], [4], and SARS-associated coronavirus (SARS-CoV) has been demonstrated in human and experimental animal tissues by immunohistochemical or in situ hybridization (ISH) assays [5], [6], [7], [8], [9], [10], [11], [12]. Coronavirus-like particles have been detected by electron microscopy (EM) in cells from a bronchoalveolar lavage specimen [4], [13] and in pneumocytes from postmortem lung samples [2], [6]. Because coronavirus particles may be confused morphologically with other nonviral cellular components, a specific technique, such as immunogold labeling EM (IEM), is needed to definitively characterize SARS-CoV particles. We describe the use of immunohistochemistry (IHC), ISH, EM, and IEM for the pathological diagnosis of SARS and cellular localization of SARS-CoV. We also discuss the use of these techniques to investigate the pathogenesis of this emerging infection.",

Chest x-ray showed mild pulmonary congestion. The temperature elevated to 37.9\u00b0C 2 hours later, and urinalysis showed 20 to 30 white blood cells. A presumptive diagnosis of urinary tract infection and congestive heart failure was made, and the patient was treated with antibiotics, diuretics, and intravenous nitroglycerin. The patient was admitted to a cardiology ward 2 days later and became increasingly dyspneic with a nonproductive cough and persistent low-grade fever. Serial chest x-rays showed progressive lung infiltrates. A more detailed history revealed that the patient had visited Taipei Hoping City Hospital on April 15 and 16. Because this hospital was associated with a large nosocomial outbreak of SARS during late April, the patient was immediately isolated as a probable SARS case. Throat and nasopharyngeal swabs were positive for SARS-CoV by viral isolation and polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assay. He was transferred to an intensive care unit on April 29 after sudden onset of mental status changes, hypotension, and melena. The patient subsequently developed ventricular fibrillation and died 1 day later.",

Previous studies have demonstrated the cellular tropism of SARS-CoV in the tissues of patients by using ISH [5], [7], [11], [12] or EM [2], [4], [13], [15]. Immunohistochemical has also been used to localize viral antigens in the human tissues [12] and tissues of animals experimentally infected with SARS-CoV [6], [8], [9], [10]. To our knowledge, this is the first report to localize SARS-CoV in human tissues by using IEM and double-stain IHC. In an earlier study of 4 human cases [4], we were not able to demonstrate viral antigens in the lung by IHC. The most likely explanation is that all tissue samples from patients in that study were obtained after a clinical course lasting longer than 14 days. In a recent report by Chong et al [7], a similar observation was documented with the inability of ISH to detect viral nucleic acids in patients who died beyond 8 days. The patient in this case report died 7 days after onset of symptoms, and coronavirus antigens and RNA could be detected by IHC and ISH. Electron microscopy also identified viral particles in the lung tissue, and the viral nature of these particles was confirmed by IEM. More cases are needed to further characterize the temporal relationship between the duration of illness and viral clearance in human lung tissue.",

            "text": "The development of a specific IHC, ISH, and IEM to identify SARS-CoV in formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded samples also allowed us to assess the cellular tropism of SARS-CoV infection in human lung tissues. SARS-CoV antigens were localized primarily in the cytoplasm of type II pneumocytes, and occasionally in alveolar macrophages. Type II pneumocytes are known to secrete pulmonary surfactant, which reduces surface tension and preserves the integrity of the alveolar space. These cells also play an important role in tissue restitution after lung damage. There is also mounting evidence to support their contribution to the development of acute inflammatory lung injury after exposure to biological or chemical agents. Type II pneumocytes can be directly infected by bacteria or viruses and modulate the corresponding pathogenesis of these organisms. Additional studies are needed to further define the role of type II pneumocytes and alveolar macrophages in SARS-CoV infection. Haagmans et al [10] showed extensive SARS-CoV antigen expression in experimentally infected cynomolgus macaques at day 4 postinfection. The antigens were mainly in alveolar lining epithelial cells with morphologic characteristics of type I pneumocytes, suggesting that type I pneumocytes are the primary targets for SARS-CoV infection early in the disease. In a recent study using a nonhuman primate model [8], we examined the lung tissues of day 2 postinfection monkeys and demonstrated that type I pneumocytes were the main type of cells involved at this early stage, whereas only some type II pneumocytes were involved. Type I pneumocytes normally represent 90% of the alveolar epithelial cell volume and are easily damaged during pulmonary infections or other types of injury. Type II pneumocytes are more resistant to damage, and this feature is important for the repair process because these cells produce surfactant, proliferate, and differentiate into type I cells during lung damage. Collectively, these data indicate that SARS-CoV infects both type I and II pneumocytes, and clearance and localization of the virus may depend on the stage of illness as well as individual immunologic responses. Other target cells for SARS-CoV infection, such as bronchiolar epithelial cells [14], may also have a significant role in virus replication and transmission.",

A specific etiologic diagnosis is particularly important during SARS-CoV disease outbreaks because of the impact on hospital infection control and other public health measures. Because the clinical features of SARS-CoV infection can be similar to those of many other respiratory infections, a definitive diagnosis can be made only by laboratory confirmation. Laboratory assays currently used for SARS diagnosis include virus isolation, PCR, and serology. Pathology-based methods, such as IHC, ISH, EM, and IEM, offer the advantage of interpreting the test results within a morphologic context and can also be used for diagnosis if appropriate tissue specimens are available. Despite the limited tissue samples in this single case report, we were able to successfully use specific IHC, ISH, and IEM methods for SARS-CoV detection in human lung tissue. These methods should help enhance the pathological diagnosis and further our understanding of the pathogenesis of SARS-CoV infection.",
