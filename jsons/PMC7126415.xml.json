            "text": "Asthma is a complex multifactorial disease involving interactions between genetic susceptibility and exposure to environmental factors such as allergens, pollutants and lower respiratory tract infections. The latter are felt to be involved at various levels in the natural history of asthma. Acute viral infections (e.g. rhinovirus, coronavirus, respiratory syncytial virus [RSV], parainfluenza virus, influenza virus, and adenovirus) have been associated with asthma exacerbations both in children and in adults [1], [2]. Acute bacterial infections with atypical pathogens (such as Mycoplasma [M.] pneumoniae and Chlamydophila [C.] pneumoniae) have also been associated with acute asthma exacerbations, whereas chronic infection with these agents may play a role in persistent asthma. The mechanisms associating the presence of microorganisms in the airways and asthma has not been fully investigated, but likely involve increased susceptibility to infection in asthma, with the presence of infection augmenting inflammation in the lower airways. It is likely, but as yet unproven, that repeated acute infections and/or chronic infections play a role in disease progression, via increased inflammation resulting in airway \u2018remodelling\u2019. Should this be confirmed, antimicrobial therapy may have a role in this disease by interrupting a vicious cycle of infection\u2013disease progression.",

Interestingly, this attitude finds little support from current guidelines. The recent National Asthma Education and Prevention Program Expert Panel Report indicates that antibiotics are not currently recommended for the treatment of acute asthma exacerbations except when fever, purulent sputum or clear evidence of infection are present [5]. This advice is based on the only two randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group trials testing routine antibiotic administration in addition to standard care to adult [6] or paediatric [7] populations with asthma exacerbations, that were published at the time of writing. Both of these rather old studies found no association between antibiotic treatment and improvement in any asthma outcome. It must however be noted that both studies were small, and employed penicillin derivatives, to which atypical pathogens such as M. pneumoniae and C. pneumoniae show extremely poor responses.",

The authors show deficient rhinovirus induction of interferon-\u03b2 [10] and of interferon-\u03bbs in asthmatic primary bronchial epithelial cells and of interferon-\u03bbs, also in alveolar macrophages, which was highly correlated with rhinovirus-induced asthma exacerbation severity, airway inflammation and virus load in vivo [11]. In relation to bacterial infections, lipopolysaccharide induction of interferon-\u03bbs in asthmatic macrophages was also deficient and correlated with exacerbation severity [11]. These data identify novel mechanisms of susceptibility to infection in asthma and suggest new approaches to prevention and/or treatment of asthma exacerbations.",

Evidence of atypical infection was found in most, but not all of these studies. Interestingly, in one trial a serological association between C. pneumoniae and acute asthma was found only with anti-heat shock protein (HSP) 10 antibodies and not with traditional serological markers [28]. Lieberman et al. [29] found that M. pneumoniae but not C. pneumoniae was associated with hospitalisation for acute exacerbation of bronchial asthma. In the study by Wark et al. [27] over one-third of patients with acute severe asthma showed a rise in C. pneumoniae-specific antibodies consistent with acute infection, reinfection, or reactivation of latent infection with the microorganism. These subjects exhibited a more intense inflammatory response (as assessed by sputum total cell count, neutrophil count, and eosinophil cationic protein levels) compared with subjects with acute asthma who did not show an increase in C. pneumoniae antibody levels.",

The authors suggested that the inflammatory response to chronic C. pneumoniae infection may interact with allergic inflammation to increase asthma symptoms, however, given our recent knowledge [10], [11], it is also possible that chronic C. pneumoniae infection is a marker of increased susceptibility to infection, and therefore to infection-associated exacerbations.",

A biologic basis for increased susceptibility to atypical bacterial infections however, is only just beginning to emerge. Studies in mouse models of C. pneumoniae pneumonitis revealed dramatically increased pathology in IFN-\u03b3R\u2013/\u2013 mice [59] and more recently it has been shown that IFN-\u03b3 secretion by bone-marrow-derived macrophages controls infection and importantly, that this is IFN-\u03b2\u03b1 dependent [60], [61]. The recent discovery of the type III (\u03bb) IFNs and the realisation that they have almost identical properties in innate immunity to the type I (\u03b1\u03b2) IFNs, coupled with the demonstration that individuals with asthma have deficient type III IFN production in macrophages in response to both viral and bacterial stimuli [11], provides an important likely explanation for increased susceptibility to atypical bacterial infection in asthma. Further study to determine whether macrophages from individuals with asthma also have deficient type I IFN production in response to bacterial stimuli, and to determine whether type III IFNs are also important in host defence against C. pneumoniae infections, and both type I and type III IFNs against M. pneumoniae, will be required to confirm this theory.",

The mechanisms regulating the possible role of atypical pathogens in causing acute or sustaining persistent airway inflammation have recently been reviewed [53], [62]. Both C. pneumoniae and M. pneumoniae infection may participate in the pathogenesis of asthma at different levels of the airways by interacting with numerous cellular elements within the lung (mast cells, epithelium, endothelium, macrophages, smooth muscle).

The authors observed significant improvement in evening PEF values at the end of treatment, but the difference between the groups diminished thereafter.

In patients with PCR-positivity for M. pneumoniae or C. pneumoniae, macrolide treatment improved FEV1 and reduced airway tissue expression of IL-5. Similar improvements were not observed in those receiving placebo, or in those receiving macrolide therapy but without evidence of infection, suggesting that the treatment effect was related to antimicrobial, not anti-inflammatory activity. Mycoplasma and Chlamydia organisms were still present in the airways of seven asthmatic subjects after treatment with clarithromycin, and two subjects had positive PCR findings after treatment only. The authors suggested that macrolides, being bacteriostatic, had difficulty in eradicating these organisms and, moreover, that this difficulty may result in a chronic state of infection/colonisation. Experimental evidence for this suggestion may be derived from a study by Kutlin et al. [67] testing prolonged treatment with azithromycin, clarithromycin or levofloxacin on C. pneumoniae in a continuous-infection model. They observed that 30-day treatment with these agents at concentrations comparable to those achieved in the epithelial lining fluid reduced but did not eliminate C. pneumoniae in continuously infected HEp-2 cells. These data suggest that the dosage and duration of antibiotic therapy currently being used may not be sufficient to eradicate a putative chronic C. pneumoniae infection.",

This study demonstrated statistically significant and clinically substantial benefits associated with ketolide antibiotic treatment in acute exacerbations of asthma. In this population 61% of patients had evidence of C. pneumoniae and/or M. pneumoniae infection and the effect of telithromycin on FEV1 was statistically significant in patients with documented infection at baseline and not in those patients without evidence of infection. However, the magnitudes of treatment effects on FEV1 were similar in the infection-positive and -negative groups, and the lack of statistical significance in the latter could simply relate to the smaller numbers of patients in that group.

Serology may be useful retrospectively in defining acute infection if good paired serum samples are available, however, it will clearly not be useful in making acute treatment decisions unless decisions can be made on a single acute sample. The TELICAST study suggested a single estimation of IgM [70] may be useful, but further studies are clearly required to confirm this. Serology certainly has a lower specificity and sensitivity when applied to chronic infection, as most adults have been previously exposed and high IgG levels are therefore a poor indication of current bacterial presence. It is possible though, that IgA may prove a more useful assessment than IgG [68]. Molecular biology techniques are more specific and sensitive but should be used on the right sample. Applying a PCR on sputum is probably better than using a pharyngeal swab specimen in acute infection/reactivation, but obtaining good-quality samples is difficult [70], and sputum contains PCR inhibitors, so appropriate processing is required. Sputum PCR has not yet been studied in the context of chronic infection. PCR of peripheral blood mononuclear cells is so far the best biological approach for detection of chronic infection, but this method does not confirm the site of infection. In addition, molecular methods are not standardised and a great deal of further work is required before they could be considered clinically useful.",

It is also likely that chronic persistent infection with and/or frequent reactivation of these agents may contribute to ongoing inflammation in the airways and possibly therefore to long-term remodelling. However, definitive demonstration of a causal association between atypical bacterial infection and asthma is still lacking. It may be that some patients with asthma (particularly in the setting of impaired innate immune responses) are more prone to infection with these agents, and the increased burden of infection may contribute to disease severity and progression. In vitro studies have identified a number of mechanisms associated with chronic C. pneumoniae and M. pneumoniae atypical bacterial infection that may contribute to maintaining chronic airway inflammation. Both bacterial elements activate transcription factors, thus priming most cellular elements in bronchial tissue (epithelium, endothelium, monocytes/macrophages, smooth muscle cells), resulting in a cascade of cytokine release and adhesion molecule up-regulation, which favours cellular influx into the airways, persistent inflammation, and airway remodelling.",

These properties, distinct from antimicrobial activity, have been termed \u2018anti-inflammatory\u2019. Anti-inflammatory effects are manifested at lower doses and usually after several weeks of treatment. Several animal inflammation models, in vitro studies using human cell cultures, and clinical studies have better defined the possible mechanisms through which macrolides exert anti-inflammatory activities, although large-scale, double-blind, randomised studies are needed to define the true clinical impact of this down-regulation of host inflammatory responses.",

Ideally, both short-term indicators (e.g. recovery from an exacerbation) and long-term indicators (number of exacerbations, progression of disease) should be followed. Data from the limited number of studies carried out so far indicate that treatment with macrolides is associated with some benefit in both clinical and functional terms, although perhaps only in patients with documented atypical infection and provided that treatment be prolonged for several weeks. A key question is whether even prolonged antibiotic treatment is capable of truly eradicating C. pneumoniae and M. pneumoniae or rather simply temporarily suppresses the infection, which is then refuelled by long-standing reservoirs. The single study in acute exacerbations with a ketolide antibiotic also showed clear benefit, and further studies with macrolides and ketolide antibiotics in acute asthma exacerbations are required.",
