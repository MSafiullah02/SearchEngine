            "text": "In late December 2019, a novel strand of Coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) causing a severe, potentially fatal respiratory syndrome was identified in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China and is causing outbreaks in multiple world countries, soon becoming a pandemic. Italy has now become the most hit country outside of Asia: on March 16, 2020, the Italian Civil Protection documented a total of 27980 confirmed cases and 2158 deaths of people tested positive for SARS-CoV-2. In the context of an emerging infectious disease outbreak, it is of paramount importance to predict the trend of the epidemic in order to plan an effective control strategy and to determine its impact. This paper proposes a new epidemic model that discriminates between infected individuals depending on whether they have been diagnosed and on the severity of their symptoms. The distinction between diagnosed and non-diagnosed is important because non-diagnosed individuals are more likely to spread the infection than diagnosed ones, since the latter are typically isolated, and can explain misperceptions of the case fatality rate and of the seriousness of the epidemic phenomenon. Being able to predict the amount of patients that will develop life-threatening symptoms is important since the disease frequently requires hospitalisation (and even Intensive Care Unit admission) and challenges the healthcare system capacity. We show how the basic reproduction number can be redefined in the new framework, thus capturing the potential for epidemic containment. Simulation results are compared with real data on the COVID-19 epidemic in Italy, to show the validity of the model and compare different possible predicted scenarios depending on the adopted countermeasures.",

So only the susceptible, the healed and the deceased populations are eventually present, meaning that the epidemic phenomenon is over. To understand the system behaviour, we partition it into three subsystems: the first including just variable S (corresponding to susceptible individuals), the second including variables H and E (representing healed and defuncts), and the third including I, D, A, R and T (the infected individuals), which are nonzero only during the transient. We focus on the third subsystem, which we denote as the IDART subsystem. An important observation is that when (and only when) the infected individuals I + D + A + R + T are zero, the remaining variables S, H and E are at the equilibrium. Variables H and E (which are monotonically increasing) converge to their asymptotic valuesH and\u0112, and S (which is monotonically decreasing) converges toS if and only if I, D, A, R and T converge to zero.",

The limitS represents the fraction of population that has never been infected. This value is a decreasing function of the parameters \u03b1, \u03b2, \u03b3 and \u03b4, which are the infection parameters.

Distinguishing between diagnosed and not diagnosed cases allows us to highlight the perceived distortion in disease statistics, such as the number of infected individuals, the transmission rate and the case fatality rate (CFR, typically defined as the ratio between the number of deaths ascribed to the infection and the number of diagnosed cases). The discrepancy between the actual CFR (total number of deaths due to the infection, divided by the total number of people who have been infected) and the perceived CFR (number of deaths ascribed to the infection, divided by the number of people who have been diagnosed as infected) can be quantified based on this model. Therefore, the model can explain the possible discrepancy between the actual infection dynamics and the perception of the phenomenon. Misperception (either resulting in underestimating or overestimating) can be particularly relevant in the early phases of an epidemic phenomenon, due to the lack of thorough information: for instance, performing an insufficient number of tests may lead to underestimating the transmission rate (because many infected subjects are not diagnosed as such) and overestimating the case fatality rate (because critical or fatal cases hardly go undetected). The model thus provides a rough quantification of the error in estimating the actual number of infected people due to the lack of proper diagnostic tests, or due to insufficient number of diagnostic tests being performed. Also, it can explain and predict the long-term effects of underdiagnosis, including the (apparently surprising) increased number of infections and fatalities, with sudden outbreaks after long silent periods.",

Moreover, high false negatives rates are reported and certified laboratories with expensive equipment are needed [32] . Rapid tests with high sensitivity and specificity are urgently required to be easily developed in the real life settings such as schools, airports, train stations etc. Some laboratories are actually moving in this direction by developing a 15 minutes test to detect SARS-CoV-2 IgM and IgG simultaneously in human blood [33] .",

Data about the number of deaths (corresponding to E(t) in our model) appear particularly high with respect to the case fatality rate reported in the literature; this can be largely explained by the age structure of the Italian population, which is the second oldest in the world (and the reported CFR across all countries is steeply increasing with the age of the patient) and by the extensive intergenerational contacts in the Italian society, which enhanced the spreading of the virus among older and more fragile generations [41] . Perhaps more importantly, it can be also explained by the Italian criteria for (provisional) statistics, which lead to overestimation. In fact, contrary to other countries, the official numbers for COVID-19 deaths provisionally count the deaths of all the people tested positive for the SARS-CoV-2 virus, even when they had multiple pre-existing life-threatening diseases and the exact cause of death has not been ascertained yet, so these numbers still need to be confirmed [42] .",

The model fitting process must take this problem into account. Therefore, we decide to fit the parameters based on the data about the diagnosed infected population and the number of recovered diagnosed patients, but not on the data about deaths. It is also worth stressing that, in the long run, the model is weakly sensitive to the initial conditions; for this reason, the initial mismatch concerning the mortality data has little impact.
