            "text": "Bovine enterovirus (BEV) belongs to the genus Enterovirus in the family Picornaviridae, which currently consists of 46 species grouped into 26 genera. The Enterovirus genus consists of 12 species; nine enteroviruses (A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H, and J) and three rhinoviruses (A\u2013C) (Knowles et al., 2012). The enteroviruses are small (~25\u201330 nm in diameter), non-enveloped, icosahedral viruses consisting of a single stranded positive sense RNA genome surrounded by capsid proteins. The genome has approximately 7500 nucleotides (nt). The 5\u2032 non-translated region (NTR) contains an internal ribosome entry site, which is the initiation site for translation. The genome contains a single open reading frame (ORF) that encodes a polyprotein (P), which is further processed to yield structural capsid proteins (VP1-VP4) and non-structural proteins (2A, 2B, 2C, 3A, 3B, 3C and 3D) (Jiang et al., 2011).",

For example, the BEVs are now classified into two subgroups E (1\u20134) and F (1\u20136) while they were previously named as BEV-A (1\u20134) and BEV-B (1\u20136) (Shaukat et al, 2012, Adams et al, 2013). The BEVs were first isolated in the late 1950s (McFerran, 1962). From then on, the virus has been found to exist widely in cattle herds worldwide without causing a specific disease (Gur et al., 2008). However, BEVs have also been isolated from cattle with a wide range of clinical signs including respiratory disease (pyrexia, cough, and dyspnea), enteric infections (diarrhea, high morbidity and moderate mortality), reproductive disorders, and infertility (Ze-Li et al, 2014, Zhang et al, 2014). Zhang et al. (2014) reported a novel BEV-E2 from faecal samples of cattle with severe diarrhea and haemorrhagic intestinal mucosa. Calves experimentally infected with BEV-1 manifested symptoms varying from respiratory illness and moderate diarrhea to subclinical infection with the virus being localized mainly in the digestive tract (Blas-Machado et al., 2011). In mice, the virus was able to infect intestine, liver and lung (Zhang et al., 2014).",

The genetic changes tend to accumulate over time and can occur between viruses of different species. For example, ovine enterovirus type 1 (OEV-1) is a natural interspecies recombinant between bovine and porcine enteroviruses (Boros et al., 2012). This type of recombination occurs on multiple occasions resulting in a complex set of sequences in the nonstructural region of the viral genome (Oberste et al., 2004). Recombination may lead to the emergence of virulent enteroviruses which may cause severe disease as was the case with human enterovirus D68 outbreaks in the USA (Midgley et al, 2014, Pastula et al, 2014). In Egypt, BEV was first isolated from calves in1966 (Singh et al., 1966) but there have been no further reports of this virus in the Egyptian cattle population. The present study reports the isolation and molecular characterization of BEV from diarrheic calves in Egypt.",

The amplification protocol used 25 \u00b5L reaction mixture incubated in a thermocycler at 50 \u00b0C for 30 min for the RT step and then at 95 \u00b0C for 15 min for Taq activation. This was followed by 35 cycles consisting of 94 \u00b0C for 1 min for denaturation, annealing for 1 min at 55 \u00b0C, and then elongation at 72 \u00b0C for 1 min followed by final extension cycle at 72 \u00b0C for 10 min. The RT-PCR products were analyzed in ethidium bromide stained 1.2% agarose gel. A single band of expected product size confirmed the presence of target BEV.",
