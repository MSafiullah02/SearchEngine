On the basis of their serological cross-reactivity and genomic organization, these viruses are divided into three categories: group 1, group 2, and group 3 (Brian and Baric, 2005, Lai et al., 2006). Recently, the Coronavirus Study Group of the International Committee for Taxonomy of Viruses (ICTV) has proposed three genera\u2014Alphacoronavirus, Betacoronavirus, and Gammacoronavirus\u2014to replace the group 1, group 2, and group 3 nomenclature, respectively (Woo et al., 2009). Equine coronavirus (ECoV) belongs to the genus Betacoronavirus, the species Betacoronavirus-1 with human coronaviruses OC43 (HCoV-OC43), human enteric coronavirus, bovine coronavirus (BCoV), porcine hemagglutinating encephalomyelitis virus (PHEV), canine respiratory coronavirus (CRCoV) (Erles et al., 2007), and bubaline coronavirus (BuCoV) (Decaro et al., 2010).",

A coronavirus antigen detected by antigen-capture enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and immunohistochemistry in the feces and intestine of a foal suffering from neonatal enterocolitis have also been reported (Davis et al., 2000); however, isolation and characterization of the causative agent was not successfully performed. An ECoV was isolated from the feces of a diarrheic foal in 1999 (ECoV-NC99) in North Carolina, USA (Guy et al., 2000); its complete genomic sequence is composed of 11 open reading frames (ORFs) encoding two replicase polyproteins, five structural proteins (hemagglutinin esterase [HE], spike [S], envelope [E], membrane [M], and nucleocapsid [N]), and four accessory proteins (ns2, p4.7, p12.7, and I) (Zhang et al., 2007). Antigenic and genomic characterization studies revealed that this virus is a new member of species Betacoronavirus-1. Identification of new coronaviruses in horses and foals will help in understanding the etiologic role and epidemiology of this virus in equine species worldwide.",

Viral RNA was extracted from the viral culture by using the High Pure viral RNA kit (Roche Diagnostics, Tokyo, Japan), followed by reverse transcription with PrimeScript reverse transcriptase (TaKaRa Bio, Shiga, Japan) by using a random primer (6 mers) according to the manufacturer's instructions. PCR amplification was performed by using PrimeSTAR GXL DNA polymerase (TaKaRa Bio). In brief, a 50 \u03bcl reaction mixture was prepared with 10 \u03bcl of PrimeSTAR GXL buffer (5\u00d7), 4 \u03bcl of dNTP mix (2.5 mM each), 1 \u03bcl of each primer (20 \u03bcM), 2 \u03bcl of the cDNA template, 1 \u03bcl of PrimeSTAR DNA polymerase (1.25 U), and nuclease-free water. The reaction mixture was incubated at 98 \u00b0C for 1 min, followed by 30 cycles of amplification at 98 \u00b0C for 10 s, 55 \u00b0C for 15 s, and 68 \u00b0C for 1.5 min or 4.5 min (N and S gene amplification, respectively), with a final incubation at 68 \u00b0C for 7 min. The PCR products were purified by using a QIAquick gel extraction kit (QIAGEN). The sequencing reaction was performed by using a BigDye Terminator v.3.1 cycle sequencing kit (Life Technologies, Tokyo, Japan), and sequencing and data analysis were carried out on an ABI 3130 genetic analyzer (Life Technologies). The sequencing primers were designed on the basis of the nucleotide sequence data of the NC99 strain, and both sense and antisense strands were sequenced.",

However, little is still known about ECoV, especially with regard to the genetic diversity of field strains and their clinical significance. Therefore, it is necessary to isolate other ECoVs and compare their antigenic, pathogenic, and genomic characteristics in detail to understand the etiologic role and epidemiology of this virus in horses worldwide.

ECoV has been reported to have a close antigenic relationship with BCoV (Davis et al., 2000, Guy et al., 2000). However, only one of six horses showed antibody positivity against BCoV in the neutralization test whereas all sera showed seroconversion against isolate Tokachi09 (Table 2). Furthermore, when we performed the neutralization test using cattle sera seropositive against BCoV, all sera showed seropositivity against isolate Tokachi09 (data not shown). This inconsistency was also seen in the cross-neutralization test (Table 2). The neutralization titers of anti-ECoV serum to BCoV were significantly low when compared with those of anti-BCoV serum to ECoV.

However, isolate Tokachi09 has a 185-nucleotide deletion from four bases after the 3\u2032-terminal end of the S gene, resulting in the absence of the ORF predicted to encode a 4.7-kDa nonstructural protein (p4.7), which corresponds to the p4.9-coding gene in BCoV. There are ORFs predicted to encode nonstructural proteins between the S and the E genes in Betacoronavirus-1. In this region, BCoV has p4.9-, p4.8-, and p12.7-coding genes, although HCoV-OC43 and PHEV have a deletion leading to the absence of p4.9- (in PHEV, it might be truncated) and p4.8-coding genes (Mounir et al., 1993, Vieler et al., 1995). The functions of these nonstructural proteins between the S and the E genes in coronaviruses are unknown. However, it can be concluded that the two ORFs coding p4.9 and p4.8 are not essential for the replication of ECoVs as well as in HCoV-OC43 and PHEV in cell culture. Interestingly, an antisense mutation resulting in the truncation of p4.9 has been identified only in respiratory bovine coronaviruses (Gelinas et al., 2001). From this findings and HCoV-OC43 and PHEV, this protein could be involved in preferential respiratory tropism (Gelinas et al., 2001, Sasseville et al., 2002). Indeed, the main clinical symptom of the affected Japanese horses was pyrexia, whereas the horse infected with NC99 had diarrhea and pyrexia (Guy et al., 2000). These symptoms might be related to the different pathogenic properties of NC99 and isolate Tokachi09. Evidence shows that nonstructural proteins in coronaviruses may play a significant role in vivo rather than in vitro. Although the ns2 protein encoded by ORF2 of MHV is not required for viral replication in tissue culture (Schwarz et al., 1990), deletion of this protein or a single amino acid substitution leads to a significant in vivo attenuation of the virus (de Haan et al., 2002, Sperry et al., 2005). Whether p4.7 of ECoV plays a role in viral pathogenicity should be elucidated by animal experiments using NC99 and isolate Tokachi09.",

The occurrence of a long deletion, corresponding to the absence of BCoV p4.9 and p4.8, in HCoV-OC43 supports the speculation regarding a bovine-to-human direction of transmission (Vijgen et al., 2005). To elucidate the evolutionary relationship of Betacoronavirus-1, complete genomic sequence data of isolate Tokachi09 would be required. Moreover, the finding that ECoV in Japan has a 185-nucleotide deletion resulting in the absence of p4.7 suggests that the Japanese strain probably originated from a different lineage to the North American strain. Virus isolation in other areas, especially Europe and Australia, is required to conduct epidemiological studies of this virus in horses.",

Although isolation of the causative agent was unsuccessful, the results of an RT-PCR study using fecal samples suggested that the causative agent has high similarity of the genomic sequence of the N gene (97.8%) to that of NC99 (data not shown). Therefore, it was suspected that an ECoV caused this disease outbreak. However, the agent of 2004 does not have an identical genomic sequence of the N gene (98.4%) to that of isolate Tokachi09 and does not have a 185-nucleotide deletion between the S and the E genes (data not shown), suggesting that the disease in 2009 was not caused by the same virus as that causing the 2004 cases. The reason for disease recurrence is considered to be reduction in herd immunity of horses against ECoV during the 5 years since 2004. This is suggested by the fact that the pre-sera of the horses had low antibody titers against Tokachi09 (Table 3). For preventing such disease occurrence, and bovine enteritis by BCoV, herd immunity is crucial. Furthermore, considering the economic losses, vaccine development is necessary for biosecurity measures and to curtail this disease especially in the horse-racing field.",
