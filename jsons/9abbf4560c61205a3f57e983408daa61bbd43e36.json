Thirty three patients scheduled for elective urologic surgery in general anesthesia in lateral decubitus position were randomized into three groups-PEEP 0, 5 and 10 mbar. EIT recording, arterial blood gas analysis and hemodynamic parameters were captured at three timepointsbefore induction (T0), 5 min after lateral positioning (T1) and 90 min after positioning (T2). Dynamic compliance (Cdyn) was measured at T1 and T2. Offline EIT data analysis was performed to calculate EIT derived parameters of ventilation distribution. Patients ventilated with PEEP of 10 mbar had a significantly lower A-a (alveolo arterial) gradient over measurements and symmetrical distribution of ventilation measured by EIT. There was no significant difference in Cdyn, center of ventilation indices and inhomogeneity index between groups. There was no difference of mean arterial pressure, cardiac index and heart rate between groups. Patients with 5 mbar of PEEP had higher stroke volume index compared to 0 and 10 mbar at baseline and over measurements. Nondependent/dependent TV ratio as well as global inhomogeneity index were correlated with A-a gradient. Dynamic compliance showed no correlation to A-a gradient. In our study, a PEEP level of 10 mbar improved alveolar gas exchange without compromising hemodynamic stability in patients mechanically ventilated in the lateral decubitus position. EIT measured parameters may be used to determine optimal ventilation parameters in these patients with inhomogeneous lung mechanics. Further studies are needed in patients with various lung pathologies.",

After induction of general anesthesia (which initially decreases functional residual capacity), turning the patient into lateral decubitus position causes compression of dependent hemidiaphragm by abdominal organs and basal parts of the dependent lung may become atelectatic. Because all of the above, nondependent lung's compliance curve shifts to a more favorable part compared to dependent lung which may precipitate shunting ( V \u2215Q mismatch), drop in PaO 2 /FiO 2 (Horowitz quotient) and an increase in alveolar-arterial oxygen pressure gradient (A-a gradient). These differences between the non-dependent and dependent lung are even more pronounced when the 1 3 non-dependent pleura has been opened (for example during thoracic procedures) [1] .",

However, although PEEP may improve oxygenation, it must be used judiciously in order to avoid consequences of hyperinflated alveoli-hemodynamic compromise and dead space increase [5] . Therefore, more than 40 years ago \"optimal\" PEEP level was proposed as a compromise between adequate oxygenation and hemodynamic stability [6] . Many methods are in use to determine the desired PEEP levels, be it PEEP/FiO 2 tables proposed by the ARDS network [7] , determination of optimal compliance of the respiratory system using pressure-volume curves, estimating the transpulmonary pressure by measuring pressure in the airways and esophagus (as a surrogate of pleural pressure), lung ultrasonography [8] , computerized tomography and electrical impedance tomography (EIT) [4, 5] .",

Dynamic compliance of the respiratory system does not correlate with alveoloarterial gradient in these patients, unlike EIT measured parameters: non-dependent/dependent TV ratio and GI index which showed a moderate but significant correlation. Lateral patient positioning during general anesthesia leads to drop of thoracic compliance [24] , which in certain scenarios might cause barotrauma in volume controlled or hypoventilation in pressure controlled ventilation, depending on ventilator settings and alarm limits. In supine patients, pressure of abdominal organs on the diaphragm and thorax is generally equally distributed between left and right lung, and while there are conflicting opinions of using respiratory system compliance as a guiding parameter in setting the \"optimal\" PEEP level [25] , Cordeiro et al. have shown that there is a strong correlation between respiratory system compliance and oxygenation levels (r = 0.8, p < 0.001) in mechanically ventilated cardiac surgical patients (which are positioned in supine position after surgery) [26] . However, in patients that are ventilated in lateral position (i.e. patients that were subjects in this study), there is a significant gradient in regional compliance which is present in both ventral-dorsal and left-right axis. Because of that, global compliance does not accurately represent all lung regions, and results of this study show that compliance doesn't correlate with regional distribution of ventilation and parameters of alveolar gas exchange. With EIT, compliance can be measured for each pixel (and subsequently for lung regions) by dividing tidal impedance variation with driving pressure, as was demonstrated by Costa et al. [27] .",

The reason for that might be that increase of PEEP will be more deleterious in patients that are volume (be it absolute or relative) depleted.

Although both the nondependent/dependent TV ratio and hCoV attempt to quantify distribution of ventilation along the latero-lateral axis, method of calculation is different. While hCoV is calculated from individual pixel impedance variation in each row and must be made offline after data export, nondependent/dependent TV ratio is calculated from TV percentages divided across ROI and is easily calculated by the bedside.

            "text": "There were certain study shortcomings. Dynamic compliance was used instead of static compliance because it is technically challenging to perform inspiratory hold maneuver need to measure plateau pressure on the anesthesia machine. However, since patients with obstructive lung disease have been excluded from this study, their peak inspiratory pressure does not differ much from plateau pressure and therefore dynamic compliance which was calculated should not deviate too much from static compliance. The choice of hemodynamic monitoring method which was used due to financial constraints (pulse wave transit time derived cardiac output) is not validated as well as some other minimally invasive measurement methods (such as arterial waveform analysis systems) which have been extensively tested [35] , however since changes in hemodynamic parameters were measured, and not absolute values, this potential shortcoming should not present a problem in result interpretation.",

Due to inhomogeneous lung mechanics and poor correlation of respiratory system compliance with parameters of alveolar gas exchange EIT could be a useful method for PEEP titration in these patients. Further studies are needed to assess changes of distribution of ventilation in patients with lung pathology who are ventilated in lateral position.",
