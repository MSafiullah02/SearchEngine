Drug use to enhance performance is unabated since the Sydney games, with scandals occurring around the world. The Bay Area Laboratory Corporation scandal, involving the anabolic steroid tetrahydrogestrinone, is the most prominent. This has ruined several sporting careers and led to criminal charges against company directors. 2 Other anabolic steroids continue to be widely used, including nandrolone, which causes problems because of contamination of dietary supplements and some foods. 3 One of the \"holy grails\" for drug cheats over the past 4 years has been to enhance oxygen transport and delivery. RSR13 (efaproxiral), an allosteric modifier of haemoglobin, is in clinical trial as a radiosensitising agent. It has been shown to increase VO 2 max in dogs and hence has been of interest to endurance athletes. The manufacturer' s collaboration with the Olympic Analytical Laboratory of the University of California (Los Angeles) resulted in an analytical method now being available for detection of the drug in sport. 4 Haemoglobin-and non-haemoglobinbased oxygen carriers are now available commercially. There are few scientific data about their use in sport, but it is likely they are misused by some athletes. 5 Recombinant human erythropoietin is widely used in cycling and other endurance sports. A detection method developed from Australian research will limit its use, at least at the Olympic venue. 6 Genetic manipulation is unlikely in 2004, but its potential is foreseen. This technology is also prohibited in the new code. 1 Unfortunately, drugs will continue to be misused. The opportunity for Olympic winners to gain huge financial rewards will fuel their use. A 79-year-old woman with an extensive medical history, including type 2 diabetes mellitus and multiple bypass procedures for lower-limb ischaemia, presented with critical ischaemia of the right lower leg. After above-knee amputation, she developed a discharge from the stump wound from which multiresistant MRSA was cultured. Despite receiving several courses of intravenous vancomycin (a total of 25 days of therapy over 5 months), the infection did not resolve.",

Thus far, CA-MRSA has predominantly caused skin and soft tissue infections, but the incidence of lifethreatening sepsis is increasing.

In one study, starting antibiotics within 7 days was associated with shorter illness, and if antibiotics were started within 2 days the shorter duration was highly significant (P = 0.006). 6 Another trial showed penicillin commenced on Day 9 was beneficial, but antibiotics had been used before entry to the trial. 2 Various penicillins and tetracyclines have seemed useful, but only oral doxycycline and intravenous benzylpenicillin are recommended. These are the first and second preferences, respectively, in Therapeutic guidelines antibiotic. 7 In the case described by O'Leary et al, 1 antibiotics were commenced on Day 3, but the penicillin dose was only half the recommended daily dose for leptospirosis. The vasculitis was probably terminal before the patient was transferred to Concord Hospital. Despite spreading to 29 countries, a rapid and coordinated international effort led to its containment. Here, we examine Australia's only laboratory-confirmed case, and the investigation of possible subsequent transmission. In June 2003, the World Health Organization (WHO) notified Australian health authorities of a 26-year-old tourist in whom SARS-coronavirus-specific antibodies had recently been detected. She was part of a retrospective serological survey of people who stayed at the Hotel Metropole, Hong Kong, on 21 February, 1 the same time a SARS source case infected at least 14 other hotel guests. 2 On 22 February, the 26-yearold tourist travelled to Australia and 4 days later developed myalgia, lethargy and cough. On 6 March, 6 days before the first WHO global alert on SARS, she saw a general practitioner (GP) in northern New South Wales, to whom she also reported nausea, vomiting, nocturnal fever and pronounced lethargy. On examination she was afebrile, pale, unwell, with a cough and clear chest on auscultation. She declined further investigations and hospital admission; her condition gradually improved, and she left Australia 6 days later. She reported close contact with only three people during her Australian visit -her partner, the GP, and the GP' s surgery nurse. None reported subsequent illness and all tested negative for SARS-coronavirus antibody by direct immunofluorescence, a highly sensitive and specific method. 3 Australia was fortunate that the tourist was not particularly infectious. The Hotel Metropole case was identified as the source case for four national and international clusters of SARS. 2 The resulting human and economic cost was substantial. 4 Without specific treatments, basic public health measures proved the only effective means to contain SARS. These included rapid case detection and isolation, contact tracing, handwashing and the correct use of personal protective equipment. 5 Many GP practices and some hospitals in Australia do not have isolation facilities or infection control resources to effectively contain diseases like SARS. In the event of local transmission of SARS, infection may well have occurred in Australian healthcare workers.",

            "text": "In about 2% to 5% of patients with subclinical hypothyroidism, the condition progresses to overt hypothyroidism each year. 1 It is currently recommended that thyroid function tests should be repeated at 6-to 12-month intervals to monitor improvement or worsening in level of thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH). 1 Testing for thyroid peroxidase antibody (TPOAb) is also common practice in subclinical hypothyroidism, as it has been shown that individuals with raised TSH and TPOAb levels have a 40-fold increased risk of developing overt hypothyroidism. 2, 3 We audited the management of patients who had a result indicating subclinical hypothyroidism from our hospital laboratory, focusing on follow-up thyroid function and TPOAb tests. In December 2003, we retrospectively inspected clinical case notes of patients who had been reported in November 2002 with a TSH level of 4.1-9.9 mIU/L (normal reference interval, 0.4-4.0 mIU/L) and a free thyroxine (FT 4 ) level within the reference range of 10-23 pmol/L (subclinical hypothyroidism). We also contacted the patients' general practitioners (GPs) for further information when necessary.There were 72 patients with results suggesting subclinical hypothyroidism. Of these, we excluded 29 from other hospitals and three whose GPs were not able to be contacted. Of the remaining 43 patients, 18 had no previous history of thyroid disease (8 men and 10 women; age range, 24-90 years). Six patients were seen in the emergency department, four in the outpatient clinics, and eight in the wards. All the laboratory reports of subclinical hypothyroid results were accompanied by a comment advising repeat thyroid studies at a later date and thyroid antibody tests. However, only three of the 18 patients (17%) had TPOAb tested. Only seven of the 18 patients (39%) were followed up with repeat thyroid function tests, at intervals ranging from 3 days to 7 months. One patient, with a TSH level of 9.8 mIU/L, was started on thyroid replacement therapy. The GPs of 10 of the 11 patients who did not have follow-up testing were not informed of the initial TSH results.The low rate of follow-up of hospital patients with a first-time diagnosis of subclinical hypothyroidism is of concern. While the increase in TSH level in some of these patients may have been related to sick euthyroidism, this can only be confirmed by normalisation of TSH level on repeat testing. TPOAb testing can be deferred until confirmation of persistently raised TSH level. Better strategies, such as a computerised system for selective copying of results to GPs whenever relevant, and inclusion of treatment advice dependent on TPOAb status in the reports, 4 may be needed to improve follow-up.
