Flock size, type of facilities, type of breeding, lambing percentage, isolation of Campylobacter jejuni, Rotavirus spp., Coronavirus spp. and Salmonella spp. seem to be poorly correlated to lamb mortality. On the contrary, bad cleaning of the lambing areas, continuous lambing periods, accumulation of lambs in the pens, high content of fat, protein and lactose in milk, low serum gamma globulin and total protein in lambs and ewes, and Cryptosporidium spp. infection are strongly linked to lamb mortality (Mu\u00f1oz et al., 1996, Andr\u00e9s et al., 2007).",

The inflammation of the intestine attributed to E. coli would cause an ischemic injury to the digestive mucous barrier. In this instance, large quantities of endotoxin would be absorbed from the intestine, overwhelming the detoxifying ability of the liver and increasing the concentration of endotoxin in the peripheral circulation (King and Gerring, 1988, Haussman et al., 2000). The presence of toxins in the organs would be responsible of the cell degeneration (Haussman et al., 2000), as suggested by the significantly higher concentration of endotoxin in the plasma of the treated lambs (Table 1).",

The combined infection of E. coli\n + \nP. mirabilis had a higher incidence in the treated lambs (Table 2), while the only enteric pathogen isolated in the untreated lambs was E. coli. This finding might be associated to the effect of the antibiotic treatment. Spectinomycin is a bacteriostatic antibiotic that inhibits protein synthesis in susceptible bacteria by binding to the 30S ribosomal unit (Plumb, 1995). The efficacy of antibiotic treatment against E. coli (Hodgson et al., 1999) and the resistance of P. mirabilis against antibiotics in several circumstances (Dance et al., 1987) have been reported. This could indicate that the treatment with spectinomycin could have limited the growing of E. coli in the patients from the treated group and it would have permitted the overproduction of P. mirabilis.",

This concentration was around 0.50 ng/mL, the point beyond survival chance is null (Jim\u00e9nez et al., 2007); while untreated lambs showed results below this limit.
