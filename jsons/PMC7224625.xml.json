At the time of this writing, 1,237,420 positive cases and 66,560 associated deaths have been confirmed in 183 countries1. For perspective, when the World Health Organization (WHO) declared COVID-19 to be a global pandemic on March 11, 2020 (just over 3 weeks ago), there were 118,000 positive cases and 4,292 associated deaths in 114 countries2,3. In our hospital system today, there are currently 2,200 patients who have tested positive for the virus. Of these patients, 613 (27.9%) remain in intensive care units (ICUs), with approximately 95% of the 613 requiring mechanical ventilatory support. The COVID-19 pandemic has significantly taxed the resources at our hospital.",

However, our hospital\u2019s capacity, resources, and health-care personnel are rapidly dwindling as front-line workers are falling ill to COVID-19 or have been redeployed to de novo makeshift ICUs.

While the orthopaedic surgeon\u2019s knowledge is often deeply specialized, we can also leverage broader strengths, such as intelligence, confidence, grit, and leadership. Moreover, as the need to provide subspecialty orthopaedic care has decreased, there is a growing need and opportunity to serve society and our patients. To that end, every available practitioner in our orthopaedic department\u2014including attending surgeons, fellows, residents, nurse practitioners, nurses, physician assistants, medical assistants, and support staff\u2014has been redeployed to another area of the hospital with unmet need, particularly the ER and ICU.",

To our surprise, however, when we walked into the ER, it was quiet. There was no coughing because the majority of patients were intubated. The pace of the ER was as fast as ever, but the atmosphere had changed: there was both palpable fear and determination in the room. And the overall volume of patients was actually lower than normal; the only patients were those who were COVID-19-positive. There were no cases of acute myocardial infarction or acute surgical abdomen. It was eerie.",

We reviewed the anatomy we knew very well (NAVEL, the mnemonic for the order of the femoral nerve, artery, vein, and lymphatics) and went for it. Over the 12-hour shift, we took turns placing nasogastric tubes, drawing femoral artery ABGs, obtaining chest radiographs and other laboratory tests, and helping to transport patients when inpatient beds became available. In the end, we realized we had also effectively completed a crash course in vasopressor medication titration and mechanical ventilator management.",

All health-care workers are practicing at the edges or beyond the scope of their training right now and yet continue to strive to learn more and provide compassionate, high-quality care to their patients. During that first redeployment shift and since then, we have been struck by the visible relief on the faces of other residents, attending physicians, nurses, and staff. Our redeployment not only allows us to act as care providers to our patients but also allows us to provide care and support to our beleaguered colleagues. During this pandemic, we must remember to not lose sight of the 3 A\u2019s of being a successful physician: availability, affability, and ability. Although we may be acting in roles that are foreign to us, our role in redeployment as physicians is only part of the picture. We are a part of the broader medical community, and thus are inextricably linked to our colleagues on the front lines of this pandemic. It would be dishonest for us to say that redeploying has made us any less afraid for the safety of our family, friends, patients, and colleagues. However, as orthopaedic surgery residents with valuable skills to offer, we are not afraid of redeployment even in the face of daunting odds.",

However, as the number of patients who were COVID-19-positive and requiring admission began to double every 2 to 3 days (following the same curve as Wuhan in the People\u2019s Republic of China and Italy), it became increasingly clear that we were indeed going to be called on to redeploy. This led to an entire spectrum of emotions from our faculty, including enthusiasm to participate, anxiety, reticence due to comorbidities or relative age, and fear, including fear of transmitting the virus to loved ones. We convened a \u201cRedeployment Committee,\u201d which reviewed the goals and needs of the hospital as well as volunteerism among the faculty, taking into consideration faculty age and comorbidities, any family health concerns, and other relevant information. The committee then delivered a working document to the chairman for his consideration of redeployment. The Orthopaedic Surgery Department was then joined by Urology, Otolaryngology, and Ophthalmology to broaden our provider pool and decrease overall virus exposure for all of those involved. The dean of our institution sent out a note to all indicating that it was expected that 100% of the faculty and staff would indeed redeploy as needed and as appropriate to areas where their expertise could be best utilized.",
