            "text": "The early Middle Miocene Lake Gacko was part of the Dinaride Lake System (DLS) and gave rise to a poorly known freshwater mollusk fauna. This was subject to malacological studies from the late 19th century onwards. Herein, we provide the first thorough taxonomic survey of Lake Gacko including revisions of several taxa. A total amount of 1,077 specimens was obtained from 17 samples, comprising at least 11 freshwater and 2 terrestrial gastropod species and 6 bivalve species. So far, none of the described taxa has been documented outside the Dinarides and the DLS, respectively. The fauna shows variable overlap with other paleolakes of the DLS, proofing once more the complex biogeographic patchwork of this system. The current paleoenvironmental reconstructions are tested and refined by application of a statistical analysis. This confirms the partition of the sedimentary history of Lake Gacko into three major depositional phases responding to astronomically forced climate changes. The low diverse mollusk assemblage in the initial phase, with abundant pulmonate and rissooid gastropods, signals a more arid climate with lowered lake level. During the second interval, the fauna becomes more diverse with common rissooid and melanopsid gastropods. It represents a more humid interval with enhanced precipitation and increased lake level, entailing the installation of a perennial lacustrine environment. The final phase is a return to arid conditions with the same elements as in the initial pulmonaterissooid assemblage. The sphaeriid Pisidium vukovici n. sp. is introduced as new species.",

            "text": "During the Early to Middle Miocene the Dinaride mountain chain harbored a series of intramontane lakes, collectively termed the Dinaride Lake System (DLS; Figs 1A-B; Krsti\u0107 et al. 2003; Harzhauser & Mandic 2008) . These tectonically isolated lakes experienced an outstanding endemic evolution of freshwater mollusks. Harzhauser & Mandic (2008 described the DLS fauna as entity and counted 110 gastropod and 35 bivalve species. New investigations by Mandic et al. (2009 ) and De Leeuw et al. (2010 suggest that the various basins of the DLS have to be considered as separate units with different geodynamic, stratigraphic, and paleoenvironmental histories. Conse-quently, new analyses of the various mollusk assemblages revealed major differences between single basin faunas (Neubauer et al. 2011 (Neubauer et al. , 2012 . Only during short phases hydrological connection between selected basins might have persisted to allow temporary faunal exchange. This combination of enduring isolation driving endemic evolution and short-term invasions lead to complex distribution patterns and extensive diversifications, which are hard to decipher in taxonomic terms. Neumayr (1880) and Brusina (1897) provided the first taxonomic papers on the mollusk fauna of the Gacko Basin. These authors partly provided descriptions and illustrations of few taxa, but never established a concise taxonomic frame of the whole basin fauna. Milojevi\u0107 (1966) distinguished between several mollusk units based on rough faunal differences. Krsti\u0107 et al. (2009) compiled a faunal synopsis for the lower parts of the basin infill based on drill cores. However, a com-plete survey of the fauna from Lake Gacko with taxonomic descriptions is still completely missing. Mandic et al. (2011) briefly documented the mollusk distribution and provided a first paleoecological interpretation. By integration of more samples and by application of a statistical analysis these results will be herein tested and modified.",

Indeed, the cyclostratigraphic analysis revealed the presence of two first order and seven second order transgression-regression cycles (Fig. 2, right column) . These were orbitally tuned to 400 kyr and 100 kyr eccentricity cycles resulting in an accurate age model for its depositional duration from 15.8 to 15.2 Ma. The lake level high-stands were thereby related to eccentricity maxima, accompanied by environmental eutrophication events in consequence to enhanced denudation and terrestrial input into the basin. Dry climate intervals were related to 400 kyr eccentricity minima. In the lower part of the succession they resulted in iterative swamp forest extension reflected by vast lignite accumulations. In the upper part they formed pedogenic and palustrine carbonate accumulations, distributed across the basin's margin.",

The samples were dissolved with diluted hydrogen peroxide and washed through a set of sieves (1 mm, 250 mm, 125 mm, 63 mm). Mollusks were counted from the 1 mm fraction only, yielding a total individual number of 1,077 specimens. In addition, a high number of specimens was obtained from smaller fractions comprising mostly juvenile stages and spire fragments. In most cases, these could not be determined on the species level. As some taxa (e.g. planorbids, lymnaeids) are prone to fragmentation because of their thin shell walls, they might be underrepresented in the larger fractions. Some taxa are exclusively found in smaller fractions (< 1 mm) or in debris collections and thus do not appear in the quantified record (Fig. 3) .",

Two further species All recorded freshwater taxa that were determined on species level are endemic to the Dinaride Lake System. Nevertheless, there are notable differences concerning the distribution of the various taxa within the lake system. Distinct faunistic relationships of the Gacko Basin fauna on the species level are evident for the Drni\u0161 Basin (57.9 %) and the Sinj Basin (52.6 %). In contrast, the roughly equally distanced Kupres Basin shares only a single taxon accounting for 5.3 % similarity (Orygoceras dentaliforme). However, notable faunal overlaps are known between the Sinj/Drni\u0161 basins and the Kupres Basin (39 %; Neubauer et al. 2012) , which are geographically closer to each other than to the Gacko Basin. The stratigraphic age of the considered deposits is comparable, ranging around 15.8 to 15.0 Ma (Neubauer et al. 2012) . Most probable, faunal exchange was performed via hydrological connections, which existed to the Sinj and Drni\u0161 basins but not (or only for short episodes) to the Kupres Basin.

This cluster, with an average similarity of 81.7 %, is de- fined by these 3 taxa only. Cluster 2 (also Unit A), with a comparable average similarity of 81.3 %, is defined by Bania valvatoides, Gyraulus pulici, Radix korlevici, Fossarulus moniliferus and Prososthenia neutra, accounting for 92.8 %. In addition, Unio rackianus (only record in the section), Pisidium bellardii and P. vukovici n. sp. appear. While the differences between the two groups are distinct, deviations between clusters within the groups are in both cases comparably low. Clusters 1 and 2 show an average dissimilarity of 34.8 %, resulting from slightly varied values for Gyraulus pulici, Radix korlevici and Bania valvatoides, and the presence of Prososthenia neutra and Unio rackianus in Cluster 2.",

Few findings of Fossarulus moniliferus, Galba sp., Gyraulus pulici and Ferrissia illyrica are reported from sample 0907/Moll3 (Unit B1). This is the only occurrence of the lymnaeid Galba within the whole section. Samples Gacko 1 and Gacko 2 from roughly correlated drill cores (Unit B2; Cluster 3 from the transition of units C/D1 with correlated samples from the Vrbica section yielded three analyzable samples (Fig. 2) . This cluster has an average similarity of 79.2 %. The most abundant taxa are Fossarulus moniliferus and Prososthenia neutra followed by Radix korlevici, Melanopsis lyrata, Ferrissia illyrica and Gyraulus pulici. These 6 taxa contribute with 91.5 % to the average similarity. Additional taxa are Bithynia jurinaci (from debris only), the planorbids Planorbarius sp. and Orygoceras dentaliforme, the terrestrial mollusks Carychium sp. and Vertigo sp., and the dreissenid Mytilopsis sp. Sample 0708/GA14 at the top of Unit D1, too small to be analyzed, yielded abundant Bithynia opercula (68.0 %) and Ferrissia illyrica (28.0 %), followed by Gyraulus pulici (4.0 %).

This is the only occurrence of the dreissenid bivalve Mytilopsis jadrovi. The unity of both samples is confirmed in the analysis by 83.6 % average similarity. Reduced dissimilarity between clusters 3 and 4 (36.8 %) is rooted in similar abundance values for Fossarulus moniliferus and Melanopsis lyrata. The main differences concern the presence of Ferrissia illyrica in Cluster 3 and higher percentage value of Bania valvatoides in Cluster 4. Interestingly, the dissimilarity levels between clusters 1 and 4 (51.0 %) and 2 and 4 (42.0 %), respectively, is lower than that between clusters 1 and 3 (66.6 %) and 2 and 3 (53.8 %). In both cases, this can be explained by the recurrence especially of Gyraulus pulici and Bania valvatoides in Cluster 4. The major dissimilarity is based on values for Melanopsis lyrata and Prososthenia neutra, which are less common or absent in clusters 1 and 2.",

The third group, again a Fossarulus-assemblage according to Milojevi\u0107 (1966) , yielded only few and small samples and does not appear in our analysis. These assemblages, however, are not defined by the frequent occurrence of their eponymous taxa Fig. 3; Tab. 1 ). The Fossarulus-assemblage is dominated by the planorbid Gyraulus pulici, followed by the hydrobiid Bania valvatoides. Likewise, the Melanopsisassemblage is characterized by frequent Prososthenia neutra and Fossarulus moniliferus rather than by Melanopsis lyrata itself. Nevertheless, the grouping into three assemblages remains valid based on the largely deviating faunal compositions (Tab. 1).",

Fossarulus, which appears throughout the whole section, is thought to be a pioneer taxon . In Lake Sinj representatives of this fossil genus are found exclusively in rather calm, shallow water settings, dominated by hydrobiids (Neubauer et al. 2011) . In Lake Gacko it is, in turn, relatively abundant in nearshore as well as distal environments and thus is regarded to be a euryoecious taxon. The ecology of the fossil genus Bania is completely unknown. As its occurrence is often bound to the presence of Gyraulus, its requirements concerning water quality and vegetation might be comparable. ). This discrepancy is explained by the highly varying sediment infill in the Gacko Basin, depending on the position in the lake: the marl units in Unit B are massive in the basin center and thin out towards the basin margins (Milojevi\u0107 1966; Mandic et al. 2011) .

Species diversity increased significantly with 14 taxa, although most of them are represented by only few individuals. In contrast, 10 species were detected in the first interval. Today, Melanopsis is known to be a generalist. It occurs in freshwater rivers, ponds, springs, shallow lakes with inundated marshes, mud and gravel shores of estu-aries, and oases, tolerating high temperatures and brackish conditions (Brown 1994; Plaziat & Younis 2005; Bandel et al. 2007 ). As the hydrobiid Prososthe- nia is a fossil genus, few data on its ecologic requirements exist. Common interpretations assign it to shallow freshwater lakes and ponds with low-energy regimes (Esu & Girotti 2001; Harzhauser et al. 2012a; Neubauer et al. 2011) . Gyraulus and Radix are still present, also indicating shallow, low-energy settings. Additional pulmonate species are documented including Ferrissia and scarce Orygoceras and Planorbarius. Extant European Ferrissia wautieri is found in lentic to stagnant waters dwelling among leaves and twigs and is basically undemanding regarding water quality. Planorbarius corneus lives today in highly vegetated, standing or slowly running water bodies feeding exclusively on detritus (Glaeer 2002) . Herein, also the only record of the terrestrial mollusks Carychium and Vertigo is documented signaling a short distance to the waterside.",

This is also documented by the increased morphological variability in Melanopsis; for the first time, it develops all five morphotypes, which are considered in detail in the systematic chapter. This genus is known for its morphologically highly variable species. Often, distinct morphologies are bound to certain environmental conditions. Heller & Sivan (2002) showed strong correlation of morphotypes with flow current in Pleistocene melanopsids of the Jordan Valley. Smooth and slender forms represent agitated environments, dwelling within or in the proximity of rivers. Sculptured shells, in contrast, reflect non-turbulent habitats. Comparably, the occurrence of sculptured morphotypes in Lake Gacko coincides with the establishment of perennial open-lake conditions (Mandic et al. Fossil Record 16 (1) 2011). Consequently, the low-energy conditions might have promoted adaptive evolution towards sculptured forms.",

The vertical axis in the plot is thought to reflect ecological conditions. The faunal compositions of the two assemblages/groups show an ongoing trend to higher diversities and uniform distributions of abundances. The low diverse pulmonate-assemblage (G1) points to ephemeral conditions with a lentic to stagnant water body and densely vegetated watersides. The following higher diverse assemblage (G2), with taxa having broader ecological requirements, reflects the establishment of a perennial system with stable open-lake conditions and habitat diversification along the shoreface. In between, local crises occurred for short episodes, as proven by the Bithynia-Ferrissia complex in Unit D1. The third assemblage, not part of the statistical analysis, with a composition similar to the initial phase, again indicates a retreat of the lake and the return to ephemeral conditions at the lake margins. Taxa requiring stable waterbodies like Melanopsis and Prososthenia are completely missing.",

Samples grouping to the left consist of few taxa, while samples on the right have a higher number of taxa at comparable sample size. Thus, the probability that a sample yields higher species richness at higher sample size (the \"expected species richness\") increases towards the right. This, in turn, fits to the interpretation above, as ephemeral habitats are expected to house few but abundant taxa, while perennial systems usually attain distinctly higher species richnesses.",

Within the lake, long-term climatic oscillations are excellently reflected in changing faunal compositions, which are proven herein for the first time by means of statistical analyses. The initial as well as the final phase both signal a more arid climate resulting in a lowered lake level. At that time, assemblages typically are low diverse and consist of abundant pulmonate and rissooid gastropods. The intermediate lake high stand coincided with a more humid interval with enhanced precipitation. The mollusk fauna diversified and rissooid and melanopsid gastropods flourished, while pulmonates were only marginally present. This interpretation agrees with data of Mandic et al.

P. hybonatum Brusina, 1897 is somewhat broader in outline and has a less prominent hinge plate. This species, originally described from Pliocene deposits of the southern Pannonian Basin, was additionally reported by Jovanovi\u0107 (1935) from the close-by Biha\u0107 Basin. Shells from the possibly coeval Austrian Aflenz Basin, determined as Pisidium cf. casertanum Poli, 1791 by Harzhauser et al. (2012b) , are broader and expose a narrower, delicate hinge plate. Likewise, P. amnicum (M\u00e7ller, 1774) (= P. priscum Haernes, 1862; non Eichwald, 1830) from the Middle to Late Miocene of the Central and Eastern Paratethys and the Upper Freshwater Molasse is broader and has narrower and less distinct lateral teeth (cf. Schneider & Prieto 2011) . The about coeval P. bakonyensis K\u00d5kay, 2006 from Hungary is quite similar in shape but exposes an elevated umbo and smaller lateral teeth. In shape and hinge characteristics it is similar to the Recent P. supinum Schmidt, 1851, but does not develop such a high umbo with the typical fold. Extant P. tenuilineatum Stelfox, 1918 has stronger posterior teeth and a transversally oriented C 3. ",
