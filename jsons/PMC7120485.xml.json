            "text": "Animal health governance faces new challenges as the ecology of infectious livestock diseases is changing (Tomley and Shirley 2009). Environmental and climate changes, intensification of livestock production, modification in land-use and agricultural practices, globalization of human travel, the development of the trade of livestock and livestock products have created conditions for an increase in the emergence and re-emergence of infectious agents in the last decades (Weiss and McMichael 2004; Randolph and Rogers 2010; Jones et al. 2008; Gibbs 2005). The frequency of emergence of new highly pathogenic avian influenza viruses (HPAIV) has increased over the past 20 years, as well as the economic impact of associated outbreaks (Alexander and Brown 2009). Bluetongue virus serotypes have continuously increased their spatial distribution, specifically in a northern direction. Treatment-resistant strains, such as methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), have appeared. Numerous infectious diseases such as foot-and-mouth disease (FMD) are endemic in many parts of the world, and may have a high impact on animal health and farmer livelihood. Moreover, they constrain the ability of affected countries to trade livestock and livestock-derived products. Production systems in developed countries are also vulnerable. For example, outbreaks of FMD in United Kingdom in 2001, classical swine fever in Holland in 1997/1998, and highly pathogenic avian influenza H7N7 in Holland in 2003 resulted in the loss of millions of animals, mainly as a result of culling of affected and exposed animals. Finally, infectious livestock diseases are a threat for public health: about 75% of human infectious agents that emerged in the last 25 years had an animal origin (King et al. 2006).",

            "text": "To meet these challenges, transparent scientific approaches are needed to obtain a better understanding of epidemiological patterns and to inform policy-development. Epidemiological systems are composed of multiple processes interacting nonlinearly. They are thus too complex to be represented using purely mental thought processes. The ability of humans to mentally conceptualize a system seems to be reached when more than three variables and six transitions from a state to another are involved (Klein 1998). Therefore, the study of epidemiological systems can benefit significantly from the use of quantitative modeling tools. By integrating individual animal-level knowledge of epidemiological, biological and behavioral factors, mathematical models of infectious diseases can provide insights into disease dynamics at the population-level and predictions of the impact of control strategies on outbreak outcome. Their mathematical formulation makes the underlying assumptions explicit, thereby ensuring the transparency of the approach, at least to those with the relevant understanding of the underlying mathematical methodologies. According to the Royal Society\u2019s Infectious diseases in Livestock report (Society 2002), \u201cQuantitative modeling is one of the essential tools both for developing strategies in preparation for an outbreak and for predicting and evaluating the effectiveness of control policies during an outbreak.\u201d",

In the field of livestock diseases, models of the spread of diseases such as bovine spongiform encephalopathy, scrapie and classical swine fever have all been developed to address pertinent issues regarding ongoing epidemics such as optimal culling strategies, farming restrictions, and the impact upon human health (Anderson et al. 1996; Ferguson et al. 1998; Stringer et al. 1998; Woolhouse et al. 1998; Boender et al. 2008). The 2001 FMD epidemic in Great Britain further served to demonstrate that, following advances in computing power and given access to the best available data (Levin et al. 1997), mathematical models can play an active role in providing policy makers with vital information as to the optimum disease control strategy during a rapidly progressing epidemic (Ferguson et al. 2001; Keeling et al. 2001). However, how useful this information was is still debated, since modeling outputs might have led to an excessive slaughtering of uninfected animals (Kitching et al. 2006).",

Simulation models have been developed to get a better understanding of factors driving the disease spread, such as the potential role played by environmental transmission in the maintenance of avian influenza viruses in natural ecosystems (Lebarbenchon et al. 2009; Breban et al. 2009; Rohani et al. 2009; Guberti et al. 2007; Roche et al. 2009); and the impact of poultry population management on the silent spread of HPAIV strain type H5N1 viruses in live bird markets (Fourni\u00e9 et al. 2010). Further models have been developed to investigate direct and indirect effects of control measures, including the hypothesis that large-scale culling campaigns may impede the evolution of avian host resistance to the virus (Shim et al. 2009), and the evolution and spread of resistance following vaccination campaigns (Iwami et al. 2009a, b). At the farm level, models allowed evaluating the impact of different mortality and morbidity thresholds for the detection of infection (Savill et al. 2006; Carpenter et al. 2004) and investigating the use of sentinel birds for detecting the emergence of HPAIV (Verdugo et al. 2009). The potential for infection to spread silently in vaccinated populations, as a result of lower levels of clinical signs and flock mortality (Savill et al. 2006) within a commercial flock, and the dynamics of waning immunity in backyard systems (Lesnoff et al. 2009) was also evaluated using models. Predictive models have been developed to investigate the potential spread of HPAIV H5N1 in the United Kingdom and to develop control strategies that could efficiently mitigate an outbreak (Dent et al. 2008; Sharkey et al. 2008; Truscott et al. 2007). A simulation model was used to explore the different pathways of infection from a commercial broiler farm in the United States (Dorea et al. 2010).",

In the case of avian influenza viruses, while direct bird-to-bird contact is likely to be the predominant mode of within-flock transmission, indirect transmission may be crucial for transmitting viruses between farms, and for virus sustainability in natural ecosystems.",

One widely used mathematical model of the infection process is known as the SEIR model where a host may move through four states, or compartments (Fig. 11.1): Susceptible, Latent (or exposed), Infectious, and Recovered (or Removed). Initially, susceptible hosts may become infected after contact with an infected host or the infected environment. In the early stages of infection, infectious agents may not be shed in sufficient quantity to transmit infection to other hosts. Individuals are then said to be in the latent (or exposed) state. Once they are able to transmit the infection, they are classified as infectious and they remain infectious for a period of time. Then, depending on the pathogenicity of the parasite and the immune system of the infected individual, the host either dies or the infection is cleared. Following clearance, the host may become immune to infection for a duration dependent upon the parasite in question.\n",

The successive outbreak waves of HPAI H5N1 occurring in Hong Kong since 1997 (Sims et al. 2003), and also during the epidemics that have affected South Korea and Japan since 2003, have also been controlled through the depopulation of poultry farms and live bird markets. As it depletes both the number of infected and susceptible individuals, stamping out operates by reducing the infectious period and bird-to-bird contact rates. The usefulness of this strategy for developed countries facing HPAI outbreaks has also been highlighted by mathematical models (Truscott et al. 2007; Le Menach et al. 2006), and was shown to highly depend on the scale of the disease spread and the early detection of infected flocks. Once disease becomes widespread, the costs of sustaining such a strategy can become prohibitive and may not lead to a sustainable reduction in transmission (Sims 2007).",

Indeed, as the vaccination coverage rises, fewer birds become infected but outbreaks become harder to detect (Savill et al. 2006). Likewise, Walker et al. (2010) found that the time from infection to reporting was significantly increased in northern Viet Nam following vaccination campaigns.

In a deterministic model, if R\n0 is higher than one, then an infectious agent will always invade a host population, resulting in a major outbreak, and possibly in its endemicity. In contrast, the infectious agent will not be transmitted if R\n0 is lower than one. In reality, for some diseases, an infectious individual can recover before transmitting the infection. As a result, during the early stage of a disease invasion when the number of infectious individuals is low, the disease can become extinct before leading to a major outbreak. The probability that the outbreak avoids this \u201cepidemic fade out\u201d and leads on to a major outbreak following the introduction of a single infectious individual can be calculated as follows:\\documentclass[12pt]{minimal}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsmath}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{wasysym} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsfonts} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amssymb} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsbsy}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{mathrsfs}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{upgreek}\n\t\t\t\t\\setlength{\\oddsidemargin}{-69pt}\n\t\t\t\t\\begin{document}\n$$ {\\hbox{Probability}}\\;{\\hbox{of}}\\;{\\hbox{disease}}\\;{\\hbox{invasion}} = 1 - \\frac{1}{{{R_0}}}. $$\n\\end{document}This equation applies to values of R\n0 higher than one. If R\n0 is lower than one, transmission events may occur, but they will be limited and will not lead to a major outbreak. As R\n0 increases above unity, the distribution of the final epidemic size becomes bimodal (Fig. 11.4): either the epidemic fades out before invading the population, or the disease becomes established and spreads to most individuals. Outbreaks involving a large number of infected individuals become more likely with increasing values of R\n0.\n",

A set of compartments is attributed to each group and different rates of transmission are specified within and between those groups. For example, the course of HPAIV H5N1 infection is known to vary according to poultry species. Ducks show a long infectious period, may not exhibit clinical signs and may even survive the infection, in contrast to chickens for which disease is more pathogenic and almost always causes fatality shortly following infection (Saito et al. 2009; Hulse-Post et al. 2005; Spickler et al. 2008).

(2007) used the following spatial kernel to describe the spatial spread of HPAIV H5N1 between premises:\\documentclass[12pt]{minimal}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsmath}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{wasysym} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsfonts} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amssymb} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsbsy}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{mathrsfs}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{upgreek}\n\t\t\t\t\\setlength{\\oddsidemargin}{-69pt}\n\t\t\t\t\\begin{document}\n$$ {k_d} = {\\left( {1 + \\frac{d}{\\alpha }} \\right)^{{ - \\gamma }}}, $$\n\\end{document}where d is the distance between two premises, and \u03b1 and \u03b3 are two constant parameters. Long-range transmission was modeled by specifying a network of contacts between premises. Le Menach et al. (2006) chose a different approach, defining three values for the rate of transmission, each one being associated to a range of distances between two premises: short, medium, and long-range.",

            "text": "The distribution of factors that determine disease spread, such as the spatial location of farms, contact patterns, production type, and environmental factors, is likely to be heterogeneous. Because of this heterogeneity, the risk for premises to be infected or to transmit the infection follows a distribution that is likely to be highly skewed. Generally, R\n0 will be higher when susceptibility and infectiousness are positively correlated (i.e., premises with a high risk of being infected are also at high risk to spread the infection to a high number of other premises) than if the same overall level of infectiousness and susceptibility is evenly distributed within a population (Diekmann et al. 2000). The role of such heterogeneity was highlighted during the SARS epidemic where \u201csuperspreading\u201d events were identified as key factor in the spread of infection (Galvani and May 2005), as some infectious hosts infected a much higher number of individuals than the average infectious case. In the cattle movement network formed by Scottish holdings, it was also estimated that 20% holdings were responsible for 80% of the value of R\n0 (Woolhouse et al. 2005). From a policy development perspective, heterogeneity can have an important impact when assessing the effectiveness of control measures. Indeed, heterogeneity may cause strong stochastic fluctuations in the early stages of an epidemic, and therefore control policies may need to be readily adaptable to changes in the observed rate of transmission. Moreover, interventions targeting potential high-risk premises may lead to effective disease control with less effort than interventions, which do not consider this level of heterogeneity.",

Instead, the dynamics of such models have to be simulated in order to obtain numerical approximations of the general model behavior. Although increasing complexity of models improves their realism, it also reduces their transparency, with the mechanisms underlying the disease dynamics becoming increasingly hard to identify, as the number of assumptions and parameters rises. The high number of parameters makes the task of robustly estimating them from data, or finding reliable estimates from existing literature, increasingly arduous. Thus, parameter values or distributions often have to be assumed, subjecting the model outputs to additional and often unquantifiable uncertainty. Moreover, as the desired level of complexity of a model increases, it becomes progressively more difficult to validate any given choice of model assumptions. Therefore, complex models may well become less reliable than simpler ones.",

Models should ideally be as parsimonious as possible, including only mechanisms describing properly the epidemic patterns while ensuring that additional complexity does not alter the outcome. In practice, the level of detail represented in a model needs to be informed by the availability of demographic and disease data. For example in Viet Nam, it has been possible to model the overall dynamics of waves of outbreaks at the commune-level, because this was the geographical resolution at which outbreaks were reported (Walker et al. 2010). Moreover, model parameterization should also be complemented by uncertainty and sensitivity analyses. These involve systematically investigating how potential errors in parameter estimation and changes in parameter values are likely to affect the modeled outputs.",

Mathematical models can also be used to assess important epidemiological parameters, such as the basic reproduction number and the generation time. Depending upon the scale at which the dynamics of transmission need to be understood, the availability of data and the ability to accurately estimate parameters, models can be developed to incorporate an increasing level of complexity to be able to more faithfully replicate the real-life behavior of epidemics. However, to do so, modelers need to carefully assess the implications this is likely to have for the reliability and transparency of modeled conclusions and predictions. As a result, in many cases, the optimal approach is to develop collections of models that have sequentially increasing complexity. Doing this can provide both general insights into qualitative aspects of disease dynamics and the factors which are most likely to affect transmission, and a robust foundation from which to generate more detailed and realistic predictions.",
