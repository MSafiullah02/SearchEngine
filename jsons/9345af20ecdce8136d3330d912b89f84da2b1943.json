Three quarters of the population exposed to dengue are in the Asia-Pacific region. Since the first recorded outbreak of dengue in Foshan, Guangdong, in 1978, DF occurs frequently in southern China and becomes a major public health threat in China [7] . In 2017, 5893 DF cases occurred in China with two of these dead. The means by which ambient temperature affects DF are via the following bioecological aspects: dengue virus, Aedes mosquitoes, human population, and its transmission environment [2] . The ambient temperature could not only impact the reproductive of dengue virus in Aedes mosquitoes but also the distribution of Aedes mosquitoes. In China, regarding the impact of ambient temperature on dengue vector distribution, Wu et al. found that Ae. albopictus have expanded their geographic range to areas with an annual mean temperature below 11 \u00b0C and a January mean temperature below \u22125 \u00b0C using CLIMEX model [8] . Temperature plays an important role in vector competence. Liu et al. found that temperature increase enhances the competence of Ae. albopictus to transmit dengue virus [9] . Most studies in China believed that temperature can drive dengue transmission [10, 11] , showing a nonlinear effect [11, 12] . Among those studies, different models are employed such as generalized additive model (GAM), autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMAX) model, ecologically based model, etc. In recent years, most studies were carried out in Guangdong and Yunnan provinces considering the higher frequency of DF outbreak. Local DF cases were positively associated with temperature with different time lags in Guangzhou [13] . The minimum temperature at a lag of 1 month was positively associated with dengue incidence in Guangzhou [14] . The mean and minimum temperatures were positively associated with increased DF risk, while the maximum temperature was negatively associated with DF transmission [15] . Xiang et al. demonstrated that a reversed U-shaped nonlinear association was found between ambient temperature and DF in Guangzhou.

Daily variations on temperature could impact necessary mosquito and parasite characteristics that help to malaria transmission intensity [20] . In Jinan, maximum temperature with a 1 \u00b0C rise may be relevant to a 7.7-12.7% increase in malaria cases, while minimum temperature with a 1 \u00b0C rise might lead to about 11.8-12.7% increase in malaria cases [21] .

The three plague pandemics have caused numerous deaths worldwide and changed human civilization [25, 26] . In China, plague is belonging to category A of 39 notifiable infectious diseases and once constituted a great burden during the initial stage of new China. At present, the disease was well controlled, and the incidence of plague keeps very low level. Climate affects the plague intensity through its effect on maintenance and replication of the pathogen, host, and vector populations by affecting temperature and precipitation in some studies [27] [28] [29] . Suitable climate could increase the reproductive rate of pathogenic microbes [30] and contribute to form stable plague foci [31] . Rodent populations and flea survival respond rapidly to climate variations [30] . Epizootics are likely to occur when rodent and flea number excess a certain threshold [32] [33] [34] . The high abundance of rodents and fleas would also increase the human plague risk [35] . Temperature seems to determine the distribution of Yersinia pestis. Nearly 95% of human plague occur in regions with an average annual temperature greater than 13 \u00b0C, and most large plague outbreaks occur within areas with an annual temperature of 24-27 \u00b0C [36] .

In Arizona and New Mexico, plague would increase if the number of days above a certain temperature threshold increased, with 80 \u00b0F for New Mexico and 85 \u00b0F for Arizona, respectively [38] . However, the transmission between fleas and mammalian hosts was significantly reduced when temperature excess 27.5 \u00b0C [41] . The mixed effect of precipitation and temperature also revealed a regional difference. Yersinia pestis prevalence was shown to increase with warmer springs and wetter summers in gerbils in Kazakhstan [42] . Similarly, the rodent and flea densities, as well as the presence of plague in Mongolian gerbils, are positively correlated with the precipitation and temperature in China [43] . High risk of human plague tends to follow the plague outbreaks in hosts [33] . However, an increased plague incidence can be expected in Vietnam during the hot, dry seasons [41] . Besides, plague outbreaks in preindustrial period were more frequent in cold and arid climate in Europe [44] . Plague is also associated with large-scale weather events [28] . El Nino Southern Oscillation (ENSO) and the Pacific Decadal Oscillation (PDO) are related to precipitation and temperature which could in turn affect plague dynamics [45, 46] . The increasing rate of human plague was closely associated with Southern Oscillation Index (SOI) and Sea Surface Temperature of east Pacific equator (SST) in China.

It is generally thought that ambient temperature is one of the most key meteorological factors exerting the impact of endemic intensity of HFRS [48] , because warm temperature is in ideal condition for the growth of crops and increase of rodent. Furthermore, it is probably that surface air temperature can increase more obviously in winter and spring than in other seasons, particularly in the northern China [49] . As the temperature increases, areas with relatively lower temperature could become beneficial to rodent breeding then extend the breeding seasons, which have a potential impact on the number, scale, and emergence of new natural foci of HFRS. In China, most studies showed that HFRS is sensitive to ambient temperature. Temperatures from 10 to 25 \u00b0C are most beneficial to rodent growth, and breeding rates for both A. agrarius and R. norvegicus would decrease when temperatures were out of this range [48] . Temperature of 17 \u00b0C as a threshold was identified in a study, below which there was a positive association, while above the threshold there was an inverse association [50] .

S. japonicum completes its life cycle through a sexual generation in the vascular system of the definitive host (i.e., mammals) and an asexual generation in O. hupensis.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 80, "end": 84, "text": "[68]", "ref_id": "BIBREF67"}, {"start": 184, "end": 188, "text": "[69]", "ref_id": "BIBREF68"}, {"start": 235, "end": 239, "text": "[70]", "ref_id": "BIBREF69"}, {"start": 397, "end": 401, "text": "[71]", "ref_id": "BIBREF70"}, {"start": 600, "end": 604, "text": "[72,", "ref_id": "BIBREF71"}, {"start": 605, "end": 608, "text": "73]", "ref_id": "BIBREF72"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Ambient Temperature and Water-Borne Diseases"}, {"text": "Ambient temperature is an important ecological factor for growth and development of S. japonicum and the presence of O. hupensis, which can influence the prevalence and distribution of schistosomiasis in China [74] [75] [76] [77] [78] [79] . In the process of transmission of schistosomiasis, ambient temperature plays a vital role in the biological activity of O. hupensis and the development of S. japonicum within the intermediate host. The optimal temperature range for miracidia infecting O. hupensis is between 10 \u00b0C and 20 \u00b0C. There is no significance in infection rates when temperature ranges between 21 \u00b0C and 31 \u00b0C and low infection rates under 10 \u00b0C. However, miracidia can never infect O. hupensis when temperature drops to 3.2 \u00b0C [4, 80] . After the invasion, S. japonicum arrested their development in snails when temperature was kept at about 15.3 \u00b0C or above 37 \u00b0C, while the optimum development occurred at 25 \u00b0C-30 \u00b0C, which means within a temperature range of 15.3 \u00b0C-30 \u00b0C, the higher the temperature is, the shorter the pre-patent period of S. japonicum within O. hupensis will be [79, 81] . Temperature could also influence the cercaria effusion, where 25 \u00b0C-30 \u00b0C were the optimal range [82] . The optimal temperature for O. hupensis ranges between 20 \u00b0C and 25 \u00b0C, which means any temperature out of this range would result in delayed or arrested development and reproduction of O. hupensis [74, 83, 84] . Physiological functions of O. hupensis declines as environmental temperature drops [74] . When the temperature drops to 5.8 \u00b0C-6.4 \u00b0C, half of the snails were in hibernation (ET 50 ) [79, 81] . In Yunnan, it is concluded that the optimal LST for O. hupensis was \u226522.7 \u00b0C after considering land surface temperature (LST) as the most suitable environmental factor for snail habitat prediction [85] . In Dongting Lake Region, the mean snail density increased gradually when the temperature was between 24.30 and 25.70 \u00b0C, while mean snail density decreased gradually when the temperature was from 24.15 to 22.40 \u00b0C in the GWR (Geographically Weighted Regression) model. A possible suitable range of temperature was from 22.73 to 24.23 \u00b0C estimated by interquartile range in high-high clustered areas. [86] . The accumulated degree-days (ADD) are considered to be similar to growing degree-days (GDD), which both reflects the heat accumulation during the development of the organism. It was estimated that the mean ADD for the development of S. japonicum in its intermediate host snail was 842.9-852.6 degree-days, and the same index for the development of a generation of O. hupensis was 3846.3 degree-days [79, 87] . Several studies conducted in Yunnan, Jiangxi, Anhui, and Hunan have drawn the similar conclusion that the mean LST, the median night-time LST, the maximum LST at daytime, the maximum and minimum LST at night, and average temperature in June were positively associated with the prevalence of S. japonicum, which showed the importance of LST [5, [88] [89] [90] [91] [92] [93] . From another perspective, a spatio-temporal kriging model suggested seasonal variation of LST at daytime were negatively associated with the risk of schistosomiasis [94] , for the possible reason that large seasonal temperature differences would impede the development of S. japonicum [79] . The January temperature is a significant determinant to the distribution of schistosomiasis. When the January mean minimum temperature is below \u22124 \u00b0C or the annual extreme low temperature drops under \u22127.6 \u00b0C, it is not suitable for O. hupensis to survive, which is the main reason that restricts transmission of S. japonicum shifting toward to north [79, 95] . However, the northern limit of the schistosome-endemic zone has shifted due to climate change. Yang et al. [96] found that the distribu-tion limits of O. hupensis have shifted from 33\u00b015'N to 33\u00b041'N due to an increase of 0.96 \u00b0C of January temperature in the past 30 years. In other words, the potential transmission area have expanded by more than 40,000 km 2 , which resulted in an additional 20.7 million people at risk of schistosomiasis [90] . The average minimum temperature in January and in winter had predominant influence on Oncomelania density and frame occurrence rate of living Oncomelania, respectively. The variation of average minimum temperature in January by 1 \u00b0C would lead to the change of Oncomelania density by 5.08-6.71%. The variation of average minimum temperature in winter by 1 \u00b0C would lead to the change of frame occurrence rate by 15.521-15.928% [97] . What's more, O. hupensis can only exist in areas with an annual mean temperature of 16-20 \u00b0C [98] . Yang et al. found that the lowest air temperature in a year was one of the factors that significantly affect the occurrence of snails in Hunan, China. When the lowest air temperature in a year ranges from \u22122.88 to \u22122.10 \u00b0C, the snails could exist, while no snail can survive when the range was between \u22122.88 and \u2212 2.34 \u00b0C [99] . A predictive model based on distribution of schistosomiasis in eastern China has been constructed to estimate the probability that schistosomiasis occurs in a target area, which showed a mean temperature of coldest quarter was of significance in model [100] . However, air temperature is less suitable for predicting snail density compared to soil temperature [101] .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 210, "end": 214, "text": "[74]", "ref_id": "BIBREF73"}, {"start": 215, "end": 219, "text": "[75]", "ref_id": "BIBREF74"}, {"start": 220, "end": 224, "text": "[76]", "ref_id": "BIBREF75"}, {"start": 225, "end": 229, "text": "[77]", "ref_id": "BIBREF76"}, {"start": 230, "end": 234, "text": "[78]", "ref_id": "BIBREF77"}, {"start": 235, "end": 239, "text": "[79]", "ref_id": "BIBREF78"}, {"start": 744, "end": 747, "text": "[4,", "ref_id": "BIBREF3"}, {"start": 748, "end": 751, "text": "80]", "ref_id": "BIBREF79"}, {"start": 1103, "end": 1107, "text": "[79,", "ref_id": "BIBREF78"}, {"start": 1108, "end": 1111, "text": "81]", "ref_id": "BIBREF80"}, {"start": 1211, "end": 1215, "text": "[82]", "ref_id": "BIBREF81"}, {"start": 1416, "end": 1420, "text": "[74,", "ref_id": "BIBREF73"}, {"start": 1421, "end": 1424, "text": "83,", "ref_id": "BIBREF82"}, {"start": 1425, "end": 1428, "text": "84]", "ref_id": "BIBREF83"}, {"start": 1514, "end": 1518, "text": "[74]", "ref_id": "BIBREF73"}, {"start": 1614, "end": 1618, "text": "[79,", "ref_id": "BIBREF78"}, {"start": 1619, "end": 1622, "text": "81]", "ref_id": "BIBREF80"}, {"start": 1822, "end": 1826, "text": "[85]", "ref_id": "BIBREF84"}, {"start": 2229, "end": 2233, "text": "[86]", "ref_id": "BIBREF85"}, {"start": 2635, "end": 2639, "text": "[79,", "ref_id": "BIBREF78"}, {"start": 2640, "end": 2643, "text": "87]", "ref_id": "BIBREF86"}, {"start": 2986, "end": 2989, "text": "[5,", "ref_id": "BIBREF4"}, {"start": 2990, "end": 2994, "text": "[88]", "ref_id": "BIBREF87"}, {"start": 2995, "end": 2999, "text": "[89]", "ref_id": "BIBREF88"}, {"start": 3000, "end": 3004, "text": "[90]", "ref_id": "BIBREF89"}, {"start": 3005, "end": 3009, "text": "[91]", "ref_id": "BIBREF90"}, {"start": 3010, "end": 3014, "text": "[92]", "ref_id": "BIBREF91"}, {"start": 3015, "end": 3019, "text": "[93]", "ref_id": "BIBREF92"}, {"start": 3187, "end": 3191, "text": "[94]", "ref_id": "BIBREF93"}, {"start": 3307, "end": 3311, "text": "[79]", "ref_id": "BIBREF78"}, {"start": 3664, "end": 3668, "text": "[79,", "ref_id": "BIBREF78"}, {"start": 3669, "end": 3672, "text": "95]", "ref_id": "BIBREF94"}, {"start": 3782, "end": 3786, "text": "[96]", "ref_id": "BIBREF95"}, {"start": 4118, "end": 4122, "text": "[90]", "ref_id": "BIBREF89"}, {"start": 4552, "end": 4556, "text": "[97]", "ref_id": "BIBREF96"}, {"start": 4652, "end": 4656, "text": "[98]", "ref_id": "BIBREF97"}, {"start": 4981, "end": 4985, "text": "[99]", "ref_id": "BIBREF98"}, {"start": 5240, "end": 5245, "text": "[100]", "ref_id": "BIBREF99"}, {"start": 5348, "end": 5353, "text": "[101]", "ref_id": "BIBREF100"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Ambient Temperature and Water-Borne Diseases"}, {"text": "Having realized the ambient temperature is one of the most principal elements affecting distribution and transmission of schistosomiasis, researchers in China focused on related studies from different perspectives.

Climatic conditions may have affected the incidence of respiratory infectious diseases. Influenza, commonly known as \"the flu,\" is a representative respiratory infectious disease caused by some influenza virus. Regarding the virus classification, influenza viruses belong to RNA viruses that include three of the five genera of the family Orthomyxoviridae, that is, influenza A virus, influenza B virus, and influenza C virus. A fourth family of influenza viruses has been proposed -influenza D. The type species for this family is bovine influenza D virus which was first isolated in 2012. The influenza A virus can be subdivided into some serotypes on the basis of the antibody response to these viruses. The serotypes confirmed in humans and ordered by the number of known human pandemic deaths include H1N1, H2N2, H3N2, H5N1, H7N7, H1N2, H9N2, H7N2, H7N3, H10N7, H7N9, and H6N1, respectively. Climate change may alter the incidence and severity of respiratory infections by affecting vectors and host immune responses [112] .
