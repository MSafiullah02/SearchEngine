We provide a working model for sensor technology to support different parts of the tissue fabrication pathway. We next look at biological sensors in nature, with IGF-1 signaling as an example and study the intracellular signaling events which take place in response to IGF-1 signaling. Next, we look at the design requirements for sensors to support the culture and fabrication of 3D artificial tissue. The next three sections are dedicated to three specific sensing mechanisms, which include acoustic sensors, magnetic sensors and optical sensors. For each of the three sensor mechanism, we provide an overview of the theory, along with some applications to illustrate the principles of operation. We then look at flexible sensors and how they have been used for various applications and the potential role of flexible sensors in tissue engineering. We conclude this chapter by providing a case study from the Artificial Heart Laboratory; the case study is focused on the development of novel sensors to record the EKG properties of 3D artificial heart muscle.",

How is this accomplished based on the current state of the art? During the tissue fabrication process, isolated cells and later, 3D tissue are maintained in culture for several days and often times, for weeks. During this culture period, individual tissue culture plates are removed from the controlled culture environment at intermittent time points. While the time period for functional assessment varies, a common strategy is to record functional properties every 2\u20133 days. Once the tissue culture plates are removed, the 3D tissue constructs are attached to external sensors for functional recording. The functional properties are then recorded for a specific time period, say for 1\u20132 min. During functional assessment, the 3D artificial tissue is exposed to the external environment and is physically handled during functional assessment. As a result, the properties of the 3D tissue are altered during functional assessment. After functional assessment, the 3D tissue is sacrificed. This process is repeated at several time points during the tissue culture process. Let\u2019s look at one example. During the fabrication of 3D artificial heart muscle, researchers are often interested in measuring changes in the contractile properties as a function culture time. In order to measure contractile properties, the tissue culture plate is first removed from the cell culture incubator. One end of the 3D heart muscle tissue is then connected to an external force transducer. Changes in contractile properties are then recorded in response to electrical stimulation or in response to changes in calcium or some other chemical compound. There are several limitations of this method. First, attachment of 3D artificial heart muscle to the external force transducers requires physical handling of the 3D tissue and this process inherently changes tissue properties. Second, data collection is only for a short period of time and provides information about 3D artificial heart muscle at a single time point; such data is limited and cannot be used to make any conclusions about the contractile properties as a function of time. Third and less obvious, is the limitation of the current generation of force transducers, which do not have the high level of sensitivity required to measure small changes in tissue functionality. Forth, any data obtained for the contractile properties of 3D artificial heart muscle cannot be used to change the culture environment in a positive feedback loop that regulates the culture environment. These limitations point to the need for a new generation of sensors that are better equipped to record changes in the functional performance of 3D artificial tissue and provide data that can be used to regulate the tissue and organ fabrication process.",

However, the ability to engineer a positive feedback control loop makes use of real-time electrical properties of 3D artificial heart muscle to regulate the electrical stimulation protocol. Let\u2019s look at one simple example of how this is beneficial. During the fabrication of 3D artificial heart muscle, there can be instances where the artificial tissue enters into a state of arrhythmia; this leads to an uncoordinated series of contractions. These changes in electrical activity will be recorded by the EKG monitors in real-time and can be used to relay an increase in electrical stimulation voltage; in essence, the high voltage electrical stimulation protocol will serve as a defibrillator, re-establishing baseline electrical properties.",

IGF-1 is a small peptide which consists of 70 amino acids that are organized to form a hydrophobic core with three disulfide bonds that serve to stabilize the 3D structure of the protein molecule [1, 2]. IGF-1 is part of a larger family of proteins, which also include insulin, insulin-like growth factor 2 (IGF-2), IGF-binding proteins (IGFBPs) and the IGF-I receptor (IGF-IR). IGF-1 is predominantly produced in the liver in response to stimulation by growth hormone (GH) and is released into the circulatory system and acts on target cells via endocrine, autocrine and paracrine signaling. The majority of IGF-1 is found in the circulation bound to IGFBPs, which regulates the concentration of the protein molecule in circulation and extends the half-life. IGFBPs also regulate the tissue distribution of IGF-1 at the cellular level by providing a mechanism for controlled release within target tissues. IGF-1 exhibits its cellular response by binding to the IGF-1R, which is described in the next section.",

Ligand activated kinase activity is responsible for triggering intracellular signaling events; this process requires participation of several proteins along the signal transduction pathway. SHC and insulin receptor substrates (IRSs) are proteins that act as intermediary factors between ligand activated kinase and intracellular signaling cascades. These intermediate proteins are supported by many other proteins, including Grb2, GTP-binding protein RAS, Sos, c-Raf, MEK, ERK1 and ERK2. IGF-1 binding to IGR-1R is known to have an effect on cell proliferation resulting from a prolonged transition through all phases of the cell cycle. IGF-1 signaling acts to regulate cellular apoptosis serving as an anti-apoptotic agent; the signal transduction pathway involved in the anti-apoptotic function of IGF-1 involves the P13K-Akt pathway.

Magnetic biosensors in biological applications make use of a property known as giant magnetoresistance (GMR) [22\u201332], which refers to a significant change in electrical resistance based on the applied magnetic field; a non-magnetic material like copper is placed between two layers of a magnetic material like cobalt. The Nobel Prize in Physics for 2007 was awarded to Dr. Albert Fret and Dr. Peter Grunberg who independently discovered the phenomena of GMR in 1988. Magnetic techniques make use of magnetic nanotags (MNTs) [33, 34], which allow specific molecular recognition for protein moieties; MNTs can be compared to fluorescent probes that are commonly used for protein detection. Fluorescent based sensors in biological applications are very well established and used extensively and therefore, we begin our discussion with a brief overview of fluorescent based techniques. We then present an overview of magnetic based methods, discuss advantages of these techniques and end with specific applications of MNTs for biosensing.",

ELISA methods are based on the binding of a primary antibody to the protein of interest; a fluorescently tagged secondary antibody then binds to the primary antibody [35\u201344]. The fluorescent tag is used to determine the amount of secondary antibody bound to the primary antibody, which in turn reflects the amount of protein of interest in the sample. Therefore, using this method, the fluorescent intensity of the tag on the secondary antibody is used to quantify the amount of protein that is present in the original sample. The fluorescent intensity of the tag is compared with values from a previously determined standard curve correlating the amount of protein with fluorescent intensity.\n",

First, magnetic probes are more stable over time in culture and can be used for long term labeling assays. Fluorescent tags are chemical compounds that can lose integrity as a function of time; this is not the case with MNTs. This property can prove advantageous for long term labeling assays during tissue and organ fabrication. Second, magnetic materials do not lead to background noise effects, which do occur with fluorescently labelled samples. Background fluorescence is a common phenomenon in biological samples and is due to the inherent properties of the tissue. Third, application of controlled magnetic fields on the external surface provides a mechanism for remotely measuring and regulating the biological environment. And finally, the sensitivity of magnetic assays has been shown to be greater than fluorescent assays, as we will see in the examples that we present next. The high sensitivity allows detection at significantly lower protein concentrations, compared with fluorescent based techniques.",

Using hCG, it was demonstrated that magnetic biosensors could measure 10 femtomolar concentrations of hCG, compared with 4 pM for commercially available ELISA kits [34]. In a second example, magnetic biosensors were used for DNA detection in the range of 16 pg/\u03bcl to 10 ng/\u03bcl and in all cases (except at the highest concentration tested), the sensitivity of the magnetic biosensors was shown to be greater than fluorescent probes [50]. In a third example, magnetic biosensors were used to develop a Bead Array Counter (BARC), with potential applications in cell sorting and particle counting [49]. The BARC system was shown to have a very high sensitivity and was able to detect 10 micro-beads, each with a diameter of 2.8 \u03bcm [49]. Most of these examples served a proof of concept studies to illustrated the feasibility of MNTs as biosensors and illustrate their relative advantages when compared with fluorescent methods, particularly the increase in sensitivity.",

At the center of QCM-D technology is a sensor that is fabricated using quartz that has been sandwiched between two gold electrodes. The most important property of quartz related to application in biosensors is its piezoelectric properties; this refers to the propagation of acoustic waves in response to an applied electric field. When an electric field is applied to the quartz crystal, the material oscillates and this results in the propagation of acoustic waves. Under baseline conditions, the quartz sensor is subjected to a controlled oscillating potential difference that is applied to the two gold electrodes. In response to this, the quartz sensor oscillates and generates acoustic waves that have specific properties which can be characterized by frequency and amplitude. Under baseline conditions, the relationship between applied electric field and acoustic wave properties is well defined and characterized. At the heart of the QCM-D sensor is the change in the properties of acoustic waves in response to changes at the surface of the quartz sensor. Cells, proteins and other molecules like glucose can be deposited on the surface of the sensor. In response to changes in the surface properties of the QCM-D sensor, there are measurable changes in acoustic wave properties. There are two important properties of the output acoustic wave that provide information about the cells, proteins or other molecules that are deposited on the surface of the sensor.",

In one example, QCM-D sensors were used for the detection of glucose [74]. The method made use of competitive binding of glucose and dextran on concanavalin A (ConA) binding sites on the surface of grapheme coated QCM-D sensors. Dextran molecules were assembled on the surface of the modified QCM-D sensors and ConA molecules were then immobilized on the dextran. Varying concentrations of glucose were added to the detection chamber, which competed with dextran for ConA binding sites. Glucose has a higher affinity for the binding sites compared with dextran and this resulted in displacement of the dextran from the surface of the QCM-D sensor; this was accompanied by a decrease in acoustic wave frequency. It was demonstrated that an increase in glucose concentration in the range of 0.01\u20137.5 mM was related to a linear decrease in acoustic wave frequency. As the glucose concentration in human serum is in the range 3.3\u20136.1 mM, this mechanism demonstrates the feasibility of QCM-D sensors for clinical work relating to glucose monitoring. Furthermore, QCM-M sensors were shown to exhibit high sensitivity in the lower concentration ranges, 0.01\u20130.1 mM, making these sensors suitable for high sensitivity assays in cell culture studies.",

It was demonstrated that during initial phases of cell proliferation, there was a linear relationship between cell number and frequency; an increase in cell number was shown to correlate with a decrease in acoustic wave frequency. This relationship plateaued as the cells approached confluency, meaning that small increases in cell number did not result in significant changes in the acoustic wave frequency. The linear portion of the curve was dependent on cell type and was in the range of 0\u2013200,000 and 0\u2013500,000.

One mechanism to develop this is to develop compact sensors that are a couple hundred microns in diameter. Such sensors can be embedded within 3D tissue and organ systems and be used to provide real-time non-invasive information about changes in the metabolite (e.g. Glucose) concentration, along with changes in cellular properties like cell number. Such systems have the potential to provide valuable information about the tissue and organ fabrication process and regulate input variables to maximize functional performance.",

By analyzing the properties of light waves, one can obtain information about surface properties; the changes in the properties of light waves after interaction with material surfaces provide data about the surface and/or bulk properties of the material.

Ellipsometry is based on the principle that the properties of polarized light change after being reflected off the surface of any material [92, 93]. The changes in the properties of polarized light are measured by \u03c8 and \u0394, where \u03c8 is a measure of the differential change in amplitude and \u0394 is the differential change in phase [92, 93]. Based on the relative changes in phase (\u0394) and amplitude (\u03c8), surface properties can be obtained [92, 93]. Changes in \u0394 and \u03c8 are measured in terms of a ratio, known as the complex reflectance ratio, which is based on changes in the vectors of reflected light. The polarization state of incident and reflected light is defined in terms of two component vectors denoted Rs and Rp prior to contact with the surface and rs and rp after reflection from the surface. The reflectance ratio is defined as rp/rs and is an important parameter used in ellipsometry [92, 93]. The ratio rp/rs is determined from two measured variables, \u0394 and \u03c8 using the following relationship: rp/rs = tan \u03c8.ei\u0394. As the surface properties change, the properties of the reflected light change and the ratio rp/rs also changes.",

Any changes in surface thickness will be correlated to changes in the properties of the reflected light and computed using the ratio rp/rs. There are several cases during the tissue fabrication process where this technique can prove to be valuable. As one example, in the case of biological applications, the culture surface is often coated with adhesion proteins and cells attach to these adhesion properties via specific integrin mediated cell\u2013matrix interactions. At every stage of this process, there are measurable changes in the surface thickness, which can be accurately deducted using ellipsometry. As the cells attach to specific proteins, the changes in the surface thickness can be measured using ellipsometry. A more direct application of ellipsometry during tissue engineering is the calculation of the thickness of thin films, which are often deposited on the culture surface to support cellular adhesion and proliferation. The thickness of the films is an important determinant of cell adhesion and function, which can accurately be measured using optical techniques like ellipsometry.",

It is therefore, of significant interest to develop titration curves for antibodies that are known to react with ricin. In this particular study, two kinds of antibodies, pVHHS1 and 5SIR were used and dose response curves were obtained. It was demonstrated that the limit of detection was 1 \u03bcg/ml for pVHHS1 and 5 ng/ml for 5S1R.

Furthermore, the size, structure and other properties of M13K07 are comparable to the properties of lethal virus that affect human health; therefore, feasibility studies with phage M13K07 can be translated to other virus systems that are known to impact human health. In this study, a solution containing the phage M13K07 was passed over a surface with a specific ligand that binds to the virus; as the solution was passed over the surface, phage M13K07 binds to the ligand. The increase in concentration of phage M13K07 on the test surface resulted in an increase in thickness of the biological layer and this change in thickness was recorded using ellipsometry. The sensitivity of the assay was reported to be 109 pfu/ml.

Currently a new genre of bio-sensing devices that use very thin layers of various sensors can be used for a wide range of applications (. Fig. 2.7). This emerging technology can aid in the detection of both electrical and mechanical signals from the body. The flexibility of a sensing system can be adjusted to fit each individual application. This can be done using different fabrication methods such as nanomolding/micromolding [109\u2013113], and low temperature deposition [114]. In addition, to advance a flexible biometric sensing system it is necessary to integrate circuit elements with a variety of malleable substrates [115]. Among the different circuit elements that can be used are, organic/inorganic matrix arrays [113, 116\u2013122], grapheme [123, 124], nanotube or nanowire assemblies [125\u2013127], and hybrid composites [128\u2013131]. To date, flexible sensors are classified into one of four different categories, these include: electronic skins, wearable devices, implantable devices, and sensors with additional advanced features such as transparency, self-power, and the ability to self-heal [115]. With the purpose of illustrating the usefulness of flexible electrodes, we begin our discussion with an overview of the four different categories in this field. We then discuss the advantages of these techniques, an example from each group, and end with applications of flexible sensing systems in the tissue engineering discipline.\n",

First, e-skin is a thin electronic material that is designed to mimic the ability to sense external stimuli such as pressure, temperature, and tension just as human skin. In previous studies different methods of designing and fabricating e-skin have utilized materials such as organic transistors [116, 117], germanium (Ge)/Si nanowire circuits [125], and microstructured poly(dimethyl siloxane) [113]. The use of these materials allows for the formation of highly flexible and sensitive structures for the development of a wide range of applications. Second, wearable or skin adhering monitoring devices allow the continuous monitoring of physiological signals. Some examples of this methodology being implemented are the use of single walled carbon nanotubes (SWCNTs) in a device fabricated to sense various dynamic motions of humans [126], and detecting various types of mechanical stimuli by using a layered strain-gauge sensor based on nanoscale mechanical interlocking between metal-coated high-aspect ratio nanofibers [110]. The latter method measured and distinguished three mechanical loads: normal pressure, shear, and torsion by interpreting the gauge factor of each case.",

These devices can be used as alternative to the clinical system for monitoring electrical signals such as electrocorticographic and epicardial electrogram signals. Examples of these devices include but are not limited to, inorganic electrode arrays on a meshed polyimide (PI) substrate (used to measure brain activity) that are laminated with an absorbable silk fibroin substrate that can be dissolved in biofluid in approximately an hour allowing for direct gapless attachment of the device to the brain to obtain accurate mappings of brain signals with high spatial resolution [132]. Another example uses a catheter balloon with high performance multisensory circuits on the surface of the heart to monitor its electrical activity. This type of system allows for the sensing of other properties such as temperature, flow, and tactility at the tissue-balloon area in real-time [133]. Fourth, advanced sensors with additional features provide innovations to the currently existing sensing platforms. These modifications encompass properties such as transparency, self-energy harnessing and/or self-healing devices. Skin-like pressure sensors fabricated with PDMS elastic films of carbon nanotubes are used as electrode arrays of flexible capacitors, which serve as strain and pressure sensors [134]. Flexible self-powered, self-healing, highly sensitive (as high as 0.4 Pa), transparent nanogenerators were fabricated by assembling a PDMS microstructure and PET/ITO substrate into micropyramidal patterned arrays, the structure of which increased the efficiency of the nanogenerator [109].",

First, flexible sensors can be highly sensitive and multifunctional depending on a variety of parameters, which grants the tailoring of the system to the pertinent detection application. Second, flexible type systems have high bendability that allow them to be used in a wide range of biological applications, such as direct contact with organs or as wearable sensors. Third, flexible sensors are highly elastic, which give the ability to move with and grow with the organ or tissue as it develops. Fourth, flexible sensors have been designed to be biocompatible with their target specimens so as to limit rejection and be affixed to the tissue/organ without and immunological response from the host\u2019s immune system. And lastly, flexible electrodes can be manufactured at a low cost with a geometrically controlled shape for specific applications. Additionally, the polymers used for the development of these devices do not only play a crucial role in their flexibility, but also act as a layer that provides direct contact and attachment to the target specimen, as well as, allow for the transfer of various electrical and mechanical inputs.",

            "text": "\nExamples of Flexible Biosensors\u2014There are numerous examples in published studies that show a wide variety of flexible biosensors for several different applications [113, 118, 132, 135]. In one such study, highly sensitive flexible pressure sensors were developed by joining microstructured PDMS dielectric layers that were used in the fabrication of e-skins that mimic the tactile sensing properties of natural skin. It was demonstrated during this study that both the sensitivity and pressure range are adjustable by changing the shape of the PDMS structures and this system exhibited higher-pressure sensitivity than that seen in unstructured elastomeric films of similar thickness [4]. In a second example, flexible biosensors were used to fabricate an epidermal electronic system that served as a wearable device to monitor temperature, strain, and other electrophysiological properties of the skin. This device was fabricated through the integration of active/passive circuit elements, microscale LEDs, wireless power coils, and devices for radio frequency that were integrated on the surface of a ~30 \u03bcm elastomeric sheet. The device was mounted on a water-soluble PVA film that dissolved to leave the sensors firmly attached to the skin [8]. In a third example, a flexible sensing device was fabricated with ultrathin (2.5 \u03bcm) spin-cast films of polyimide (PI) as a support for arrays of electrodes designed for direct contact passive neural recording in feline brains due to low bending stiffness. The device was laminated with an absorbable fibroin substrate, which dissolved when in contact with biofluid and left the device in direct contact with the brain to provide mapping of physiological signals with appropriate spatial distribution [132]. In a fourth and last example, a composite material composed of a supramolecular organic polymer with embedded nickel nanostructured microparticles was fabricated. This device shows mechanical and electrical self-healing properties at ambient conditions. The electrical conductivity can be tuned by varying the amount of nickel particles and can reach values as high as 40 S/cm. This study demonstrates that natural skin\u2019s repeatable self-healing capability can be mimicked in conductive and piezoresistive materials [135]. All of these examples serve to illustrate the extensive use and ability of flexible biosensors to accurately measure different metric in a wide variety of applications.",
