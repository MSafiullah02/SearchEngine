Detection of nucleic acid from a pathogen consistent with the clinical presentation, such as HHV-6 in this case, can support a diagnosis that informs management and limits unnecessary testing or treatment. However, nonpathogenic organism detection may lead to incorrect assumptions of cause-and-effect, increase utilization of ineffectual and potentially harmful therapies, and impede evaluation and management of the true diagnosis.
