A second report showed that bilateral GGO from one patient [12,13]. In two other large studies with 138 and 99 confirmed cases, consolidative airspace opacities and GGO were the most commonly reported imaging features [1,14]. In a prospective case series of 41 admitted patients, CT abnormalities suggestive of GGO showed bilateral lung involvement [6]. A different report mentioned less details on distribution or pattern besides GGO [5]. In another study, Chung et al. characterized the CT manifestations of COVID-19 pneumonia in 21 patients and reported bilateral lung involvement in 76% and peripheral airspace opacities in one-third of the cases at presentation [3]. More than half of their patients showed GGO without consolidative opacities, whereas 29% showed GGO in addition to consolidative opacities at presentation. In another study of 51 patients with confirmed COVID-19, 1324 lung lesions were detected on chest CT. The most common CT findings seen in these patients were isolated GGO, GGO with reticular or interlobular septal thickening, and GGO in combination with consolidative opacities [15]. Air bronchograms were reported in 80% of these patients [16]. In this retrospective case series, we noted each had abnormalities present in their CT scans with the goal of familiarizing radiologists and clinical teams with identifying the radiological features of infected with the COVID-19 of this new outbreak. We found that GGO were typical CT findings with a rounded morphology and a peripheral lung distribution, and GGO were more extensive than consolidation. Some additional features were observed such as air bronchogram and distribution of the changes in the peripheral parts of the lungs. Some patients were characteristically described as crazy-paving pattern, of which the reticular network in it is thought to represent the thickened interlobular septa while the GGO reflect the alveolar filling with periodic acid-Schiff-positive material. The mechanisms thought to be responsible for this pattern include interstitial fibrotic processes, alveolar filling processes, or a combination of both [16]. We also noted the number of lobes of the lungs that were affected with ground glass opacities and consolidation. In the present study, the fine reticular pattern was distinguished from crazy-paving pattern. It is more uniform and of the same size. This manifestation may be due to the dilation of the microvessels in the alveolar septa caused by early inflammation, and further development tends to be a \u201ccrazy paving\u201d pattern which means the thickened septa is more irregular, sharper, and denser. Intralesional vacuole sign was observed in 4 cases, it may be the dilation of alveolar ducts and alveolar sac, indicating the alveolar destruction and onset of fibrosis.",

Pan et al. assessed the follow-up CT scans of 63 patients that were obtained within 3\u201314 days after an initial CT study. They found that more than 85% of the patients showed imaging signs associated with disease progression such as increase in GGO, consolidative opacities, and interstitial septal thickening [18]. In our study, nineteen patients underwent a second CT examination within three to five days as their symptoms worsened. The lesions of 5 patients increased significantly, and 8 patients advanced from pure GGO to crazy-paving pattern and appeared intralesional vacuole sign.

Therefore, we can't solely depend on CT to completely exclude presence of COVID-19. The main reason is that COVID-19 infection may take time to demonstrate as a disease prior to visible abnormalities on CT. Lung cavitation, discrete pulmonary nodules, and lymphadenopathy were not observed. Some of the patients also had underlying lung diseases such as fibrosis and emphysema.

Timely identification of patients is needed for those patients who may present with unusual or mild symptoms, or carry COVID-19 not being recognized, rRT-PCR testing yielding false-negative results [19]. Thus, patients who were exposure or travel to areas of COVID-19 outbreak and were with suggestive imaging findings may aid in early isolation. Generally, the CT outcomes reported for COVID-19 are resembling to those reported with MERS-CoV [20,21] and SARS-CoV [22,23], not surprised because the responsible virus is also coronavirus. Although we managed to radiologically observe the COVID-19 infected individuals, there are still many questions to be answered and further study is required to understand how patients fare after treatment.",
