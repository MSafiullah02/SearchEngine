There was no significant difference in terms of the number of discharges, whereas the number of pediatric beds, the number of isolation beds serving patients with infectious disease, and the number of patients attending specialist outpatient clinics were significantly more unfavorable to Queen Mary Hospital, which has the most diverse case-mix, including many types of organ transplant services. In other words, Queen Mary Hospital has more medical staff per 1,000 beds compared with the regional average, but the differences in nursing staff allotted per 1,000 beds was not significantly different between Queen Mary Hospital and the regional average. Proactive infection control measures are performed by the infection control team of Queen Mary Hospital (Table 2\n).4, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16 After implementation of hand hygiene practice using alcohol-based handrub, the overall hand hygiene compliance was 66.4% in 2010, 76.3% in 2011, 78.6% in 2012, 75% in 2013, and 76.2% in 2014. Except for the infection control program for MRSA and C difficile described previously,12, 13, 17 322 episodes of nosocomial cases without clustering or with clustering of <3 cases were investigated in Queen Mary Hospital. Two hundred fifty-five of 322 episodes (79.2%) were due to viruses, whereas 67 episodes (20.8%) were due to MDROs. Respiratory syncytial virus (61 episodes, 18.9%), parainfluenza virus (59 episodes, 18.3%), norovirus (47 episodes, 14.6%), influenza A virus (31 episodes, 9.6%), and VRE (28 episodes, 8.7%) constituted 70% of sporadic nosocomial cases. An unprecedented investigation of a sporadic case of nosocomial legionellosis was made and described previously.18 Of the 322 investigation episodes, 92 (28.6%) were performed in the medical unit, whereas 58 (18.0%) and 35 (10.9%) were conducted in the pediatric surgery and general pediatric units, respectively. In response to the first nosocomial case, rapid infection control response was initiated to prevent further nosocomial spread (Table 3\n).",

Because the patient case mix of the 7 hospital networks in Hong Kong may be different, we attempted to assess infection control performance using number of hospital outbreaks per 1 million patient discharges and patient-days among the biggest acute regional hospitals, which are comparable in annual discharges within each hospital network. As for the outbreak-prone divisions in the hospital such as pediatrics and infectious disease services, all acute regional hospitals provide pediatric service, and Queen Mary Hospital has the highest number of pediatric beds. Infectious disease services are provided by all 7 acute regional hospitals, whereas 1 acute regional hospital, Hospital B1, is designated for admission of the first few cases of any emerging infectious diseases with high mortality such as avian influenza and SARS-CoV. However, after the outbreak of SARS-CoV in 2003, airborne infection isolation rooms were built in all acute regional hospitals for preparedness for emerging infectious diseases, but these isolation beds are used for patients requiring contact precautions even when there is no emerging infectious disease outbreaks. Queen Mary Hospital has a significantly lower number of isolation beds for general infection control purposes. Despite these factors, Queen Mary Hospital achieved almost zero hospital outbreaks during a 5-year time period with the implementation of proactive infection control measures, and our outbreak episodes per 1 million patient discharges and patient-days was 16 and 15 times lower than the benchmark, respectively, among 7 acute regional hospitals in Hong Kong.",

Nonetheless, only 1 cluster of 5 patients with respiratory syncytial virus was observed during our study period. Therefore, the low number of hospital outbreaks most likely reflects the effectiveness of our timely implementation of enhanced infection control measures in response to the first patient, as illustrated in Table 3, instead of a failure to detect outbreaks. This surveillance system also worked well at the time of an unprecedented outbreak of SARS-CoV in 2003. Out of 386 infected health care workers in Hong Kong, only 2 (0.52%) were from Queen Mary Hospital.22 We speculate that our practice of daily monitoring of microbiology laboratory data to identify the first hospital-acquired case, proactive approach to perform timely education of health care workers by the infection control team at the bedside, environmental disinfection, priority use of single-room isolation, and implementation of \u201cexit entry control\u201d directly observed hand hygiene of hospitalized patients by health care workers, appears to be effective in terminating nosocomial transmission of epidemiologically important pathogens.4, 7, 8, 9, 13, 23 Among these measures, provision of timely education by our infection control team, in particular, empowers frontline staff to comply with hand hygiene and infection control practices. We promoted our proactive infection control measures to other public hospitals in the third quarter of 2013, which may explain the overall reduction in hospital outbreaks in 2014.",
