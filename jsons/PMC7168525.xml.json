            "text": "Coronaviruses (CoVs) are a class of important viruses that could infect a variety of hosts, causing multiple diseases, including respiratory infections and enteric diseases, etc. (Coleman & Frieman, 2014; de Wit, van Doremalen, Falzarano, & Munster, 2016). Based on phylogenetic analysis, CoVs were tentatively classified as four genera: Alphacoronavirus, Betacoronavirus, Gammacoronavirus and Deltacoronavirus (Woo et al., 2012). Several CoVs could infect swine and posed huge threat to the swine health and industry. Porcine transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV) and porcine epidemic diarrhoea virus (PEDV), both belong to alphacoronavirus, are two commonly causative agents of the enteric diseases of pigs and have been well studied in previous studies (Coussement, Ducatelle, Debouck, & Hoorens, 1982; Doyle & Hutchings, 1946; Pensaert & de Bouck, 1978; Trapp, Sanger, & Stalnaker, 1966). Porcine deltacoronavirus (PDCoV), a new member of Deltacoronavirus, was firstly detected in pig faeces in the molecular investigation of CoV in Hong Kong in 2012 (Woo et al., 2012). Up to now, PDCoV has been detected/isolated in pigs across the world, including USA, Mexico, Canada, South Korea, China and Thailand (Dong et al., 2016; Fu et al., 2018; Janetanakit et al., 2016; Jang et al., 2018; Jung, Hu, & Saif, 2016; Lee & Lee, 2018; Mai et al., 2018; Song et al., 2015; Wang, Byrum, & Zhang, 2014; Xu et al., 2018). PDCoV has become a reportable disease in the United States by United States Department of Agriculture, and an infection case is published weekly at http://www.aphis.usda.gov. The infection incidents were in wide range within the geographical scope in the affected countries. The piglets naturally infected with PDCoV exhibited diarrhoea, vomiting and dehydration together with histological lesions typical for multifocal to diffuse villous atrophy of the small intestines (Janetanakit et al., 2016; Song et al., 2015; Wang, Hayes, Sarver, Byrum, & Zhang, 2016). The characteristic clinical signs and microscopic intestinal lesions that were associated with PDCoV infection were evidenced by experimental infection studies (Chen, Gauger, et al., 2015; Jung et al., 2015).",

            "text": "The clinical symptoms of the pigs infected with PDCoV were characterized by watery diarrhoea, which were very similar to that caused by PEDV and TGEV. These similar symptoms caused by these CoVs made it difficult to clinically distinguish these viral pathogens. Rapid and sensitive assays for specific detection of PDCoV would be beneficial to the diagnosis and epidemiological investigation of the virus. At present, several diagnostic methods for rapid detection of PDCoV have been developed. Serological assays such as virus neutralization test, indirect fluorescent antibody assay and enzyme linked immunosorbent assay were reported to detect PDCoV\u2010specific antibodies (Hu et al., 2015; Luo et al., 2017; Zhang, 2016). However, the serological methods were not suitable for the detection of antibodies during the early stage of virus infection as antibody generation required a few days. To rapid diagnosis of PDCoV infection, several molecular methods such as reverse transcription\u2010polymerase chain reaction (RT\u2010PCR) and RT\u2010quantitative PCR (RT\u2010qPCR) assays have been established for direct detection of the PDCoV nucleic acids in the swine samples (Marthaler et al., 2014; Song et al., 2015; Wang et al., 2014). However, these diagnostic methods do have some drawbacks, such as labour\u2010intensive and time consuming. The loop\u2010mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP) assay, which required shorter run time compared with PCR/qPCR, was reported for the detection of PDCoV (Hanaki et al., 2014). In comparison to LAMP assay, the recombinase polymerase amplification (RPA) assay, which required fewer primers (two primers) and shorter run time (20\u201330 min), has been widely reported in pathogen detection (Lillis et al., 2016; Ma, Zeng, Huang, et al., 2018; Ma, Cong, et al., 2018; Yang et al., 2016; Yang, Qin, Sun, et al., 2017). The isothermal amplification of the RPA assay depends on three enzymes: a recombinase polymerase, a single\u2010stranded binding protein and a DNA polymerase (Piepenburg, Williams, Stemple, & Armes, 2006). RPA amplicons can be detected by gel electrophoresis or directly visualized by lateral flow dipstick (LFD) (Yang, Qin, Song, et al., 2017); real\u2010time detection of the amplification can be achieved by adding a probe to the reaction (Ma, Zeng, Huang, et al., 2018).",

Eighteen of 54 faecal swab specimens and 21 of 54 intestine specimens were determined to be positive by RT\u2010RPA. When RT\u2010qPCR was applied to detect the samples, all the negative faecal swab samples by RT\u2010RPA was also negative; 16 of 18 PDCoV\u2010positive faecal swab samples determined by RT\u2010RPA were positive, another two PDCoV\u2010positive faecal swab samples were negative. No fluorescent signals were observed for the IC of these two samples, the other 106 samples all generated fluorescent signals of IC in RT\u2010qPCR. So the extractions of these two samples were then purified using TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen) and tested again by the RT\u2010qPCR. The result demonstrated that these two samples were positive for PDCoV, suggesting the extractions of these two samples by the magnetic bead\u2010based kit may contain amplification inhibitors which were tolerated by the RT\u2010RPA assay.",

The coincidence rate of the detection results between RT\u2010qPCR and RT\u2010RPA was 97.2% (Table 2). Linear regression analysis showed a poor correlation between TT values and CT values (Figure 4b), implying the RT\u2010RPA assay could not be used to quantitative detection of PDCoV. To confirm the results of RT\u2010RPA, amplicons of 20 positive samples were obtained by conventional RT\u2010PCR (Ma, Zeng, Cong, et al., 2018) and sequenced.

            "text": "Since the first case of PDCoV isolation in Hong Kong in 2012, PDCoV infection has become prevalent in the pig herds across the world and caused huge economic losses to swine industry (Hu et al., 2015; Jung et al., 2015; Song et al., 2015; Wang et al., 2014; Xu et al., 2018; Zhang, 2016). Notably, the clinical sighs caused by PDCoV are very similar to that associated with other viral diarrhoea pathogens such as PEDV and TGEV, which makes it difficult to differential diagnosis. Once diarrhoea disease was occurred in the pig herd, scientists commonly suspected the causative agent of the diarrhoea cases was PEDV rather than PDCoV, which would delay the confirmation of suspected clinical cases (Wang et al., 2014). High positive rate of PDCoV infection has been demonstrated in several studies (Chen, Zhu, et al., 2015; Mai et al., 2018; Song et al., 2015). A rapid and sensitive method would be great helpful to the diagnosis of PDCoV infection in a timely manner. In this study, a real\u2010time RT\u2010RPA assay was successfully established and could detect PDCoV in less than 20 min. The RT\u2010RPA assay had a detection limit of 100 copies molecule and no cross reaction with other common swine pathogens. The critical step of genome extraction from clinical samples was carried out using a magnetic bead\u2010based kit. In addition, the real\u2010time RT\u2010RPA assay was performed by a portable device. All equipments and reagents for performing the real\u2010time RPA assay could be put into a suitcase and took away from the centralized laboratory to the field or resource\u2010limited settings, enabling the RT\u2010RPA assay used for point\u2010of\u2010care diagnostic detection for the PDCoV.",

            "text": "Currently, molecular methods, especially RT\u2010PCR and real\u2010time RT\u2010PCR, were routinely employed to confirm PDCoV in suspected cases associated with diarrhoea disease (Song et al., 2015; Wang et al., 2014). However, these assays required expensive and complex equipments and couldn't be performed outside of a well\u2010equipped laboratory. In addition, these assays regularly required 90\u2013120 min to produce detectable amplification product. RT\u2010PCR and real\u2010time RT\u2010PCR are therefore not appropriate for point\u2010of\u2010care detection of PDCoV. Recently, a RT\u2010LAMP assay was established for the detection of PDCoV (Zhang et al., 2017). The LAMP assay was performed at 63\u00b0C for 70 min in a water bath and required five primers. The amplification product was visualized by adding SYBR Green I dye to the reaction tube which did not require expensive equipment (Zhang et al., 2017). RPA, another isothermal amplification assay, requires only two primers, is carried out at a lower temperature (39\u00b0C) and takes shorter time (<30 min). Due to its advantages compared to other isothermal amplification methods, the RPA method has been widely used for rapid detection of multiple pathogens that infected with human beings and animals (Chen et al., 2018; Ma, Zeng, Huang, et al., 2018; Moore & Jaykus, 2017; Vasileva Wand, Bonney, Watson, Graham, & Hewson, 2018; Wang, Zhao, et al., 2018). For point\u2010of\u2010care diagnostics in remote area, RPA method is of great interest due to its portability, short turnaround time and potential for construction of a mobile laboratory. A RPA assay has been well studied for dengue virus detection in field (Abd El Wahed et al., 2015). Abd El Wahed et al. reported a mobile laboratory which included the magnetic beads\u2010based extraction kit, the master mix, the sample mix and the tubescanner. Field trial in the Kedougou and Senegal demonstrated that the clinical sensitivity of the dengue virus RT\u2010RPA assay was 98% compared to RT\u2010qPCR (Abd El Wahed et al., 2015).",

            "text": "In our study, the analytical sensitivity of the PDCoV RT\u2010RPA assay was 100 copies molecules, which was 10\u2010fold lower sensitivity compared with RT\u2010qPCR (Ma, Zeng, Cong, et al., 2018). The relative low sensitivity of the RT\u2010RPA assay was confirmed by the results of intestine samples, in which one sample containing low RNA titre (55 RNA copies) was tested negative by RT\u2010RPA. However, the nucleic acids extracted from two faecal swab samples by the magnetic bead\u2010based kit were negative by RT\u2010qPCR and positive by RT\u2010RPA. No fluorescent signals of IC were observed for the extracts of the two faecal swab samples, suggesting the samples had high levels of inhibitors. One of the advantages of RPA over PCR was tolerance for amplification inhibitors, which has been proved by two previous studies (Krolov et al., 2014; Moore & Jaykus, 2017). In most of the studies regarding the RPA assay, researches commonly used the column kit to extract the genome which required a centrifuge, limiting the application of the RPA assay in field. In this study, the manual kit was used to extract the genome from the clinical samples and avoided the use of a centrifuge. Therefore, the platform combining magnetic bead\u2010based extraction method and RPA shows promising advantages, such as convenient operation, short run time, tube\u2010closed reaction, less well\u2010trained personnel and sophisticated equipments requirement, enabling the RPA assay to apply in field to detect clinical samples. The RPA products also could be visualized through the LFD. Although the LFD\u2010RPA assay did not require a device, it is needed to open the tube lid and to add the RPA product to LFD, which made this assay potential of contamination (Zhang et al., 2017). In addition, it also increases the turnaround time. In comparison to the LFD\u2010RPA assay, the tube\u2010closed RT\u2010RPA assay can real\u2010time monitor the fluorescence of the amplicons, which reduces the run time and potential of contamination.",
