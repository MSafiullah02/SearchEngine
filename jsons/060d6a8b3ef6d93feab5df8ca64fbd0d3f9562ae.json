            "text": "The outbreak of a novel coronavirus disease started in Wuhan, China in December, 2019 and has since rapidly impacted many countries as a pandemic. According to WHO's COVID-19 situation report on May 4, 2020, there are nearly 3.44 million confirmed cases worldwide, with 239,604 deaths. 1 According to the findings in China, about 14% of COVID-19 patients were severe and 5% were criticaland the overall case-fatality rate among critical cases reached 49.0%. 2 These findings have greatly stressed the health care system globally. So far there is no specific antiviral drugs for the treatments of COVID-19. Whilesome studies [3] [4] [5] [6] have reported on the clinical characteristics and outcomes of critically ill patients, the challenges of managing these patients remain particularly in the context of limited medical resources and the global surge of patients. Evaluating the effects of supportive therapies becomes one of the priorities of research. 7 Current Chinese clinical management guidelines 8 for COVID-19 suggest treatment including rest in bed, oxygen therapy, antiviral medication, and mechanical ventilation. For critical patients with severe ARDS, many guidelines 8-11 recommend prone ventilation for 12-16 hours a day, especially for adult patients. This is in alignment with previous Randomized Controlled Trials (RCTs) and studies 12, 13 that showed the impact of prone position in improving oxygen and lung recruitment in mechanically ventilated patients with severe ARDS.",

On February 5, 2020, our team took over Ward No. 6 (a temporary ICU).

Patients with respiratory distress (RR\u226530 breaths/min), or SpO2\u226493% at rest, or PaO2/FiO2\u2264300mmhg were defined severe; while patients with respiratory failure requiring mechanical ventilation, or shock, or other organ failure requiring intensive care were critical. All 48 patients received standard treatment including antiviral medication, antibiotics when necessary, anticoagulation and nutritional support. Oxygen therapy using different devices including nasal prongs (NP), mask, high flow nasal cannula (HFNC) was provided to all patients based on their status of oxygenation.

According to the results of the autopsy of critical COVID-19 patients in Wuhan, China, main pathological features include exudation, infiltration of macrophages, and fibrosis in the lungs. The presence of mucous plugs with fibrinous exudate in respiratory tracts including distal regions is a distinctive feature of COVID-19. 15 The clinical data of patients, however, showed that COVID-19 will not cause \"typical\" ARDS symptoms, which might partially explain the poor response of critical COVID-19 patients to lung recruitment and positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) associated with mechanical ventilation. 16 Therefore, oxygen therapy and mechanical ventilation cannot fully resolvethe pathology of ARDS caused by COVID-19 due to their working mechanisms. The use of prone position, however, can mobilize copious secretionsand promote forward drainage toward the central airways for clearance. 17 PP also improves lung inhomogeneity, redistribution of perfusion 18 , lung compliance, recruitment-to-inflation ratio, and lung recruitment. 19, 20 Therefore, for severe ARDS caused by COVID-19, many clinical guidelines 8-11 recommend prone position for critical patients on mechanical ventilation.",

In recent years, some studies 23, 24 reported the efficacy of prone position in combination with HFNC or NIV in severe and moderate ARDS and suggested that these interventions can help prevent intubation in some patients. During the treatment of patients with COVID-19, we've been thinking whether we can apply PP and/or LP as an early intervention in managing severe and even critical patients with severe hypoxemia and/or hypercapnia. We also noticed that most clinical guidelines for ARDS do not clearly recommend or suggest applying prone position or lateral position in patients with mild ARDS. One possible reason for this lack of clinical guidelines suggesting the use of PP and/or LP could be because most of the patients with severe ARDS, admitted into the ICU, require intubation. Also, patients with mild to moderate symptoms rarely get admitted into ICU. In previous studies on prone ventilation in treating ARDS patients, patients included in the studies have various diseases, clinical courses, or severity, thereby making it hard to draw conclusions that are comparable due to various differences. 25 This time, despite of two time-related phenotypes of COVID-19 pneumonia, 26 as our patients are all COVID-19 patients, their pathological abnormalities are almost the same, it enables us to better observe and analyze the ARDS associated with COVID-19.",

First, there were limited medical resources which impacted the oxygen support provided to patients. It should also be noted that the study was conducted in China, and thereby the environment and resources might be different from other countries. Second, the sample size is small considering the nature of an observational study. Although we noticed that a single case report 30 and a pilot study 31 have reported on similar strategy used in this study, our study reported on the clinical data of severe and critical patients during a long period of treatment and follow-up. Thirdly, some specific data about tests were missing. However, the limited findings still indicated positive effects of using PP and LP in managing patients with COVID-19. It would require large scale prospective clinical trials to explore the generalizability of these interventions among other COVID-19 patients in other countries and/or environments. In conclusion, using prone position and lateral position among patients at the early stage of the disease required less medical resources, and the outcome of this study suggested that the risks of generating new lesions and/or complications were low. Therefore, it might be beneficial to consider this as an early intervention, especially under the context of pandemic and limited medical resources.",

            "text": "due to the strong transmission of COVID-19, proper personal protective equipment (PPE) is in huge demand. The inability to match the supply with the demand associated with the global shortage of PPE will, inevitably, increase the risk of exposure for clinical staff. If we consider use PP and/or LP in combination with oxygen therapy or NIV earlier in their stage of disease development, the patients might tolerate better and perform PP and/or LP without sedation and nursing support. Although in this study, the PaO2/FiO2 value only indicated the improvement of patients' status at one particular moment post PP and/or LP sessions, the CT images also showed the improvement from another perspective. No new lesions were identified and no severe adverse events occurred. It should also be noted that all the clinical staff of our team have cover-all suits as proper PPE during procedures and daily practice.In terms of daily PP sessions for treatment of patients with severe ARDS, prior studies 27,28 have provided various recommendations around 6-16 hours with the longest session lasting upto 20 hours. Another meta-analysis 29 about using prone position on patients with moderate to severe ARDS found that prone ventilation for at least 12 hours per day can improve patients' oxygenation and prognosis. The patients in the meta-analysis, however, were all on mechanical ventilation and sedated. The patients in our study, on the contrary, were conscious and used active range of motion. In our actual clinical practice, we further tailored daily PP and/or LP sessions for all patients based on their tolerance and response. For patients with severe ARDS, the requirement was to use at least 4 hours of prone position plus any other active position. For patients who were recovering quickly, the requirement was to use at least 10 hours of prone position. For critical patients, depending on their situation, the hours of each session varied. The results showed that critical patients tolerated a mean daily PP session of 6 hours during study period. One particular patient even tolerated one PP session of 16 hours.",
