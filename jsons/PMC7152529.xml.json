The incidence of COVID-19 patients still shows no sign of diminishing. Now is the time to prepare for the protracted war ahead. Hence we need to find a specific treatment measure against COVID-19. Regrettably, however, no definite treatment has been available yet. Nevertheless, various treatments, including old and new antiviral agents, are currently being investigated.1 As one of them, convalescent plasma administration has been carefully proposed.23",

It has already begun to be tried in the early 20th century.6 It was a time when there was no effective antiviral agent, so it must have been devised with the feeling of catching a straw in danger of drowning. It's better than not trying, but it seems to have achieved a little in the early days. Since then, convalescent plasma therapy has been attempted several times. Most recently, plasma therapy was applied to severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), influenza, Ebola virus, and Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV), and, albeit not always successful, it seems to have managed to get 'not-bad' results.67891011",

Given viral kinetics, it was already time for the titer to start falling.12 It is also true that convalescent plasma treatment still lacks scientific evidence. In addition, proper dosage and administration protocols have not been standardized yet. In both cases, plasma was administered when antiviral drugs and steroids were given. It is hard to tell that the successful treatment is not necessarily due to plasma, and it cannot be refuted even if it is interpreted as an effect of antiviral agent or steroid. Or it is possible that these three elements were combined to create a synergistic effect.",

The first thing you can think of is destroying the body of the virus. However, destroying the virus itself is a concept of disinfection and is too dangerous for humans to apply. As a therapeutic agent, there are drugs that inhibit RNA-dependent RNA polymerase by inhibiting the replication of viruses (e.g., remdesivir), or drugs that inhibit protease (e.g., lopinavir/ritonavir).113 Another target is angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), a gatekeeper and receptor for viruses to enter human cells. By raising the intracellular pH, glycosylation of ACE2 can be prevented to block the entry of the virus (e.g., chloroquine),1314 or it can be prevented from binding to ACE2 in advance by sticking to the spike protein of the virus.1516 The latter, not the former, is the antibody.",
