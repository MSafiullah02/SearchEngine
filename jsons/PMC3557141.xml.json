Therefore, measuring cellular ATP and caspase activity are essential biomarkers for a more comprehensive assessment of tissues in vitro.",

The procedure described in Figure 1 resulted in reasonable preservation of lung tissue bioenergetics and structure (Figure 6B\u2013C) for up to 6 h with minimum caspase activation. The success of this method relied on three critical procedural steps. The first step involved anesthesia and tissue collection. Anesthesia with sevoflurane and rapid (within 20 sec) removal of thin lung fragments from the animal were essential. It was vital to avoid organ ischemia or hypoxia before specimen collection, i.e., the organ should be well perfused during specimens\u2019 collection. The second step involved tissue processing which required immediate immersion of collected tissues in oxygenated ice-cold MEM or KH buffer. The specimens were then cut into small slices using a sharp blade or punch biopsy device, while remaining in ice cold buffer or MEM continuously gassed with 95% O2:5% CO2. The third step involved sample incubation in a large volume solution (e.g., 50 mL) with continuous gassing with 95% O2: 5% CO2. Having adhered to these procedural steps, a coefficient of variation (Cv) for rates of respiration of 13% and for ATP of 53% over 6 h was achieved. The larger variation in ATP was likely reflecting inability to maintain a tissue perfusion comparable to that of in vivo and induction of apoptosis (Figure 7B\u2013C).",

This presumption was supported by the fact that caspase activity was noted by 2 hr (also see Figure 7E\u2013F). Activation of caspases leads to opening of the transition permeability pores in the inner mitochondrial membranes, which results in uncoupling oxidative phosphorylation. This process results in rapid cellular ATP and nutrient depletions. These two consequences contribute to further damage of lung tissue. Thus, initial toxic effects become compound by overwhelming insults resulting from mitochondrial and metabolic derangements. At this stage, inevitable cell death occurs despite the removal of the initial toxic insult, as cellular repair requires ATP. These concepts are relevant to human lung diseases, such as adult respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). Interestingly, the findings in Figure 2 were not reproduced in later experiments when lung tissue was incubated in O2 depleted buffer for 30 min (Figure 3). This result could be explained by residual cellular ATP under our experimental conditions (rather than its total depletion), and hence the tissue was able to endure this brief hypoxia.",
