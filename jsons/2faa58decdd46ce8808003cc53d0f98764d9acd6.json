Despite many groups have engaged in studying the newly emerged virus and searching for the treatment of COVID-19, the understanding of the COVID-19 target -ligand interactions represents a key challenge. Herein, we introduce COVID-19 Docking Server, a web server that predicts the binding modes between COVID-19 targets and the ligands including small molecules, peptide and antibody. Structures of proteins involved in the virus life cycle were collected or constructed based on the homologs of coronavirus, and prepared ready for docking. The platform provides a free and interactive tool for the prediction of COVID-19 target-ligand interactions and following drug discovery for COVID-19.",

Although the structures of other proteins remain unknown, the high amino acid identity between SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV (77.2%) enables that it is possible to establish the homology modeled structures of SARS-CoV-2 based on the protein structures of SARS-CoV with high confidence. Thus, we built and collected the protein structures as potential targets of SARS-CoV-2 according to those of SARS-CoV. A web-server, COVID-19 Docking Server, was constructed to facilitate people to evaluate the binding modes and binding affinities between these targets and small molecules, peptides as well as antibodies. By launching the server, we'd like to provide a free and easy to use tool for people who is interested in drug discovery against COVID-19.",

An online interactive server, COVID-19 Docking Server, was constructed to predict the binding modes between the targets and small molecules, peptides or antibodies by implement of Autodock Vina and CoDockPP as docking engines. The server provides a user-friendly interface and binding mode visualization for the results, which makes it a useful tool for drug discovery of COVID-19.",

As the first COVID-19 case was reported in Wuhan city, Hubei province of China in December 2019, concentrated pneumonia occurred in China, especially in Wuhan. The pathogen caused the disease was soon identified as a novel coronavirus, which belongs to the genus Betacoronavirus and is closely related to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) with 89.1% nucleotide similarity in the viral genome 1, 2 . Later on, it was named as severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) by the International Committee on the Taxonomy of Viruses. Tremendous effects have been done to study the newly emerged virus and find potent drugs for clinical usage. Wang et. al from Wuhan Institute of Virology screened some of the FDA approved anti-virus or anti-infection drugs and found that remdesivir and chloroquine could effectively inhibit the virus in cell based assay with EC50 of 0.77 and 1.13 \u03bcM, respectively 3 .

An angle interval of 15\u00ba is used for rotational sampling, and a spacing of 1.2 \u00c5 is adopted for fast Fourier transform (FFT) translational search. CoDockPP uses a precise knowledge-based scoring function to evaluate the candidate poses after FFT searching. Finally, the top binding modes are clustered with ligand root mean square deviations (L_RMSD) cutoff of 3.0 \u00c5 in global docking and 2.0 \u00c5 in site-specific docking.

The structure was downloaded from the Protein Data Bank (PDB) with code of 6LU7. The substrate binding site was defined as the docking box for small molecule docking. Papain-like protease (PLpro): PLpro cleaves the nsp1/2, nsp2/3 and nsp3/4 boundaries. It works with Mpro to cleave the polyproteins into nsps. The structure of PLpro was built based on 4OW0, the PLpro structure of SARS-CoV 7 . The substrate binding site was defined as the docking box for small molecule docking. Nonstructural protein 13 (nsp13, helicase): The helicase catalyzes the unwinding of duplex oligonucleotides into single strands in an NTP-dependent manner. It is also an ideal target to develop anti-viral drugs due to its sequence conservation in all CoV species. The structure of helicase was built based on 6JYT, the helicase structure of SARS-CoV 8 . Two sites were defined for small molecule docking: the ADP binding site (ADP site), and the nucleic acids binding site (NCB site). Nonstructural protein 12 (nsp12, RNA-dependent RNA polymerase, RdRp): Nsp12 is the polymerase which bounds to its essential cofactors, nsp7 and nsp8. It is important in replication and transcription of the viral genome. The structure of RdRp was built based on 6NUR, the RdRp structure of SARS-CoV 9 . Two structures were prepared for small molecule docking: One structure is constructed with RNA from its homolog protein (3H5Y), while the other one with no RNA in it. Nonstructural protein 14 (nsp14, N-terminal exoribonuclease and C-terminal guanine-N7 methyl transferase): Nsp14 of coronaviruses (CoV) is important for viral replication and transcription. The N-terminal exoribonuclease (ExoN) domain plays a proofreading role for prevention of lethal mutagenesis, and the C-terminal domain functions as a guanine-N7 methyl transferase (N7-MTase) for mRNA capping. The structure of nsp14 was built based on 5C8S, the nsp14 structure of SARS-CoV 10 . Two sites were prepared for small molecule docking. One is defined as the active site of the ExoN, and the other one is defined as the active site of N7-MTase. Nonstructural protein 15 (nsp15, Uridylate-specific endoribonuclease): Nsp15 forms a hexameric endoribonuclease that preferentially cleaves 3' of uridines, also named as Uridylate-specific endoribonuclease. It is one of the RNA-processing enzymes encoded by the coronavirus. The structure of nsp15 was built based on 2RHB, the nsp15 structure of SARS-CoV 11 . The docking box was defined to include the enzyme active site of one of the chain from the hexamer. Nonstructural protein 16 (nsp16, 2'-O-methyltransferase): Nsp16 is a Sadenosylmethionine (SAM) dependent nucleoside-2'-O methyltransferase. It is only active with the binding of nsp10. The structure of nsp16 was built based on 2XYR, the nsp16 structure of SARS-CoV 12 . The SAM binding site was defined as docking box for small molecule docking.Nonstructural protein 10 (nsp10): It is essential cofactor and forms complex with nsp14 and 16.
