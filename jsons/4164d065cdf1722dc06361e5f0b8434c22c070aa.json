Within only a few months, more than a thousand studies on this topic have already appeared in the scientific literature. In this short review, we analyse the bibliometric aspects of these studies on a macro level, as well as those addressing Coronaviruses in general. Furthermore, through a scoping analysis of the literature on COVID-19, we identify the main safety-related dimensions that these studies have thus far addressed. Our findings show that across various research domains, and apart from the medical and clinical aspects such as the safety of vaccines and treatments, issues related to patient transport safety, occupational safety of healthcare professionals, biosafety of laboratories and facilities, social safety, food safety, and particularly mental/psychological health and domestic safety have thus far attracted most attention of the scientific community in relation to the COVID-19 pandemic. Our analysis also uncovers various potentially significant safety problems caused by this global health emergency which currently have attracted only limited scientific focus but may warrant more attention. These include matters such as cyber safety, economic safety, and supply-chain safety. These findings highlight why, from an academic research perspective, a holistic interdisciplinary approach and a collective scientific effort is required to help understand and mitigate the various safety impacts of this crisis whose implications reach far beyond the biomedical risks. Such holistic safety-scientific understanding of the COVID-19 crisis can furthermore be instrumental to be better prepared for a future pandemic.",

On the other hand, it has triggered an avalanche of scientific research, both within and outside the medical domain, in order to help communities overcome this challenge by minimising its adverse impacts. The enormity of these scientific efforts and the speed at which the knowledge on this topic has been generated pose significant difficulties for everyone to stay abreast of these developments. In an effort to address this challenge and to help better organise these emerging and rapidly developing scientific outcomes, in this short review, we conduct a macro-scale analysis of the scientific literature on Coronaviruses in general, as well as the novel Coronavirus in particular. We also more closely examine the literature published on COVID-19 with safety components to identify the dimensions of research that have so far been addressed by the scientific community with respect to safety. Apart from the significance this may have to curb the impacts of the current crisis, a holistic view on what safety dimensions are relatively well covered scientifically and which have so far attracted less academic focus, can be instrumental to direct future research efforts. Scientifically analysing and understanding the various safety implications of the COVID-19 pandemic as widely as possible can furthermore help societies to be better prepared for future pandemic outbreaks, and ultimately support informed decisionmaking in light of societal values.",

            "text": "Research on Coronaviruses in general dates back to 1960's and the literature on this topic is quite well established. The sub-domain of this academic field of research focusing on COVID-19, however, is understandably just an emerging and fast developing field. In Section 2, we discuss the method by which the bibliometric data related to these segments of the literature has been obtained. It will be shown through the macro-level analysis of this literature in Section 3 that, within the last two decades, each major outbreak of a Coronavirus has been immediately followed by a quick surge in the number of scientific studies on the topic and a slow gradual decline afterwards. However, the surge of studies triggered by the latest outbreak, i.e. that of COVID-19, appears to be the largest of all by far, which may be a reflection of the magnitude of the crisis that this new disease has caused. Studies from various disciplines -far beyond medicine and immunology as central fields to understand and mitigate the disease itself -have already emerged on this topic. This includes fields within social sciences, environmental sciences, psychology and veterinary sciences (Decaro et al., 2020) , and many more. Clearly, safety has been a distinct focus of interest among these studies. As the micro-level scoping analyses of this work in Section 4 demonstrate, at least ten major dimensions of safety research can be identified that have so far attracted the attention of the scientific community. The scholarly efforts on these safety dimensions and their findings and recommendations are synthesised here to help further invigorate academic investigations into the safety impacts of this pandemic. This can be important for informing policies in the face of this emergency. Section 5 concludes the findings while also identifying and discussing a selective list of potential safety-related dimensions with respect to this pandemic that are currently underrepresented in the scholarly domain. These may warrant further attention by the safety research community as the scale and scope of this crises become clearer, not in the least to facilitate wider understanding of the various safety implications as a basis for improved societal preparedness and response to future pandemic outbreaks.",

The second one is attributable to the MERS (Middle East Respiratory Syndrome) outbreak in 2012 (Sheng et al., 2020) , which reinvigorated the scholarly attention to Coronaviruses. Evidently, the last spike follows the current COVID-19 outbreak. Figure 1 (d) and (f) respectively illustrate the authors and journals with greatest number of publications on Coronaviruses. The Journal of Virology has published by far the most items on this topic, with journals such as Virology, Advances in Experimental Medicine and Biology following at a considerable distance.

Figure 2 illustrates the outputs of this analysis. The bibliographic networks visualised in Figure 2 through heat maps associated with each topic are based on the number of the references that publications of each source share with each other on each of the two topics of interest. Two journals are bibliographically coupled when their documents published on our topic of interest cite one or more document(s) in common, and the higher the number of their shared references, the stronger their coupling relationship. The more intensely the red shade corresponding to the journal name, the more dominant the journal as a knowledge outlet. The spatial closeness between journals corresponds to the number of references that publications of those sources share in each database. The results provide insights in the publication intensity across journals, complementary to Figure 1 (c) and 1(e). Finally, a keyword analysis is conducted using VOSviewer, on the terms appearing in the title and abstract of the publications on the datasets on Coronaviruses and COVID-19. The most frequently used keywords in title and abstract of the studies so far published on COVID-19 are illustrated in Figure 4 where the size of each rectangle is proportional to the frequency of the term. The terms human* and Coronavirus infection* and viral pneumonia (including their variations, humans, Coronavirus infections and pneumonia virus) appear to be the most frequently used terms in the title and abstracts of publications on COVID-19. The fact that COVID-19 is from the family of the Coronaviruses has a clear reflection on the key terms of the publications with Coronavirus being also a top term. The relation of the virus to China as the geographical region where the outbreak began has also been reflected in the key terms with China being one of the most used terms. Figure 5 presents a more detailed output of the scientometric mapping analysis for both Coronaviruses and COVID-19 topics. The network of most frequently occurring key terms are shown in Figure 5 , whereas the corresponding heat maps are shown in Figure 6 . In the network images, the size of each node is proportional to the appearance frequency of associated term. The relatedness of the key terms is also based on the number of times that they appear in the same publication. More related key terms are generally visualised in closer proximity to each other, while the colours in the network visualisation represent the clusters of related key terms.",

The green cluster focuses on the origin and cause of the new Coronavirus, with terms such as 'cause', 'bat', 'human' and 'interaction'. It also includes a narrative addressing the public health implications of the outbreak and the response of the medical sciences, with terms such as 'vaccine', 'development', 'transmissibility', 'public health', 'scientist', and 'insight'. Comparisons with other viruses, such as 'mer', and 'sars' are also apparent. The red cluster in Figure 5 (b) focuses on the clinical characteristics of the disease, with terms such as 'cough', 'fever', 'headache', 'chest', and on differences between the sexes. Another apparent narrative includes the public health response, with terms such as 'laboratory', 'hospital', and 'exposure'. The blue cluster appears to focus on the actions and response to the pandemic to ensure safety and health, with terms such as 'knowledge', 'lesson', 'experience', 'guideline', and 'travel'. Overall, the term cluster and heat map of COVID-19 in Figure 5 (b) and Figure 6 (b) show narratives focusing more on the immediate response to the disease outbreak, whereas the maps in Figure 5 (a) and Figure 6 (a) for Coronaviruses include more established scientific knowledge. Figure 7 visualises the network of key terms on Coronaviruses (corresponding to the network structure of Figure 5 (a)), overlaid with the colour-coding of the average year of publications when the terms have appeared. According to this map, the terms 'MERS COV', 'COVID' and 'nCov', 'Wuhan', 'China', and 'bat coronavirus' are all very recent terms in the scientific literature, for example compared to the terms 'bovine coronavirus' and 'feline coronavirus'. Generally, it is apparent that the blue cluster from Figure 5 (a), focusing on veterinary virology, is the oldest. The red cluster from Figure 5 (a), which addresses aspects of biomedical sciences, is comparatively younger, while the green cluster, focusing on the public health implications, is comparatively the youngest. This suggests a scientific progress of discovery and study of Coronaviruses amongst animals, followed by viological, microbiological, genetic epidemiological, and medical studies, and finally clinical work and studies on public health. The fact that there is a sizeable body of academic literature on Coronaviruses, as observed from Figure 1 (c), with significant knowledge of their various biomedical aspects available since about 2005 as seen in Figure 7 , gives hope that clinical treatments for COVID-19 are attainable.",

In doing so, many studies have synthesised the scientific evidence regarding the safety and efficacy of various treatments based on experiences obtained from previous pandemics of similar nature, such as SARS and MERS. Highlighting the high degree of genetic similarity between SARS-COV and COVID-19, an overview by Chen et al. (2020d) outlines various vaccine development programs and different vaccine technologies that are currently being examined based on experiences with SARS. They emphasise that these vaccine strategies need to be evaluated for their safety and efficacy, with specific consideration for issues specific to vaccination of vulnerable populations such as elderly and those with debilitating chronic conditions. A considerable amount of scientific efforts is focused on the development of treatments, concerning which several studies appeared on the safety and efficacy of chloroquine and its variants such as hydroxychloroquine (Liu et al., 2020a) as potential treatment for COVID-19 (Cortegiani et al., 2020; Devaux et al., 2020) . The study of Cortegiani et al. (2020) is a systematic review of the safety and efficacy of chloroquine for the treatment of COVID-19. It reflects the evidence from the ongoing clinical trials and suggests that the current promising evidence justify more clinical research into this potential treatment. Devaux et al. (2020) also suggest that the preliminary trials of chloroquine in China have been promising in terms of both safety and efficacy, which has led to several new trials.",

The study of Schwartz and Graham (2020) reviews the published data on epidemiological and clinical effect of SARS and MERS and other coronavirus infections on pregnant women and their infants. They provide recommendations for including pregnant women in the design of COVID-19 vaccine trials. Based on a retrospective review of the clinical records of pregnant women with confirmed COVID-19 pneumonia, Chen et al.

They furthermore find no evidence of vertical transmission from pregnant women to their infants who develop COVID-19 during late pregnancy.

To mitigate the risks involved in the transport of suspected COVID-19 cases, there have been models of care that avoid face-to-face contact between clinicians and patients which can also reduce the risk to the medical professionals. The method of video consultation has been discussed by Greenhalgh et al. (2020) , who provide evidence from randomised trials showing that video consultations have been associated with high patient and staff satisfaction, lower care cost, and no significant difference in disease progression. They however highlight that such evidence underrepresents cases of patients with acute and potentially serious illness such as COVID-19.

This requires level 3 biosafety facilities, which the authors highlight as one of the obstacles on the way of vaccine development.

It is clear that psychological well-being and physical safety are intrinsically interconnected and cannot be reasonably categorised as fully separate safety dimensions. Severe depression and anxiety can lead to self-harm and even suicide and domestic violence which all affect the physical well-being of individuals. Nevertheless, the focus of studies in this stream is on the indirect mental health impacts of this global epidemic rather than the biological and clinical aspects.",

This also requires a systematic re-visiting of the existing knowledge to identify gaps and overlooked areas in order to better guide and mobilise the expertise of academics towards effective solutions. It is hoped that this study can contribute towards accelerating and facilitating these scientific efforts and bringing the safetyimplications of this global emergency to the attention of the safety research community. Such implications, as demonstrated by the scientometric analyses and the scoping review, go far beyond the biological and immunological aspects and of the research on vaccines and medical treatment, which are obviously scientific priorities. Rather, these safety implications also include factors related to the non-physical safety and mental wellbeing of the public and particularly medical professionals, as well as issues related to the protection of social safety, food safety, patient transport safety and the biosafety of facilities and laboratories. As evidenced by this review, a great portion of the knowledge that is being leveraged today in the fight against the COVID-19 disease has been obtained as a result of the research efforts that were made in response to previous pandemics of similar nature ( Clearly, further accumulation of scientific research during and after the current epidemic could equip human societies and help them better prepare for health emergencies of global scale in the future. In this regard, the current work aims to highlight the safety dimensions related to which some research has already been published in connection to the COVID-19 pandemic. The authors hope that this can inspire other academics to identify gaps in the scope of the presented safety dimensions, in an effort to build an as diverse as possible picture of the safety implications of the current pandemic. Casting a wide net of pandemic-related safety research now can greatly facilitate societal and organizational learning in handling future pandemics. In this regard, it is highlighted that according to the Global Risks Report 2020 (WEF, 2020), infectious diseases is ranked the second-highest societal risk (after water crises), with only a few technological, geopolitical, and environmental risks higher rated. Thus, considering also that epidemic outbreaks have occurred relatively frequently in the past as shown e.g. in Figure  1 (a), building safety-related knowledge for the current pandemic now, may contribute to better preparedness and response for the next outbreak.",

It is apparent that several such worker categories were exposed to higher infection risks than the general public, including grocery store staff, public transport and taxi drivers, and nursing home workers. With most of these workers having no prior knowledge of how to handle their personal safety in pandemics, anxiety and stress are important occupational hazards which would be important to build scientific evidence about.

Furthermore, the occupational safety of port and aviation staff (Eldin et al., 2020) , and seafarers and cruise line personnel are areas where research contributions are currently lacking. Many of these workers likely endured heightened levels of stress and anxiety due to prolonged periods at sea, sometimes onboard ships with confirmed infections and deaths, or in uncertain conditions far away from their families. Some work on occupational safety of these groups of workers exists, e.g. Useche et al. (2018) and Shan and Lippel (2019) , but the authors are not aware of any research on occupational safety of these workers in a pandemic outbreak context. Furthermore, while there is a substantial amount of scientific studies on crowd control and management (Feliciani and Nishinari, 2018; Haghani and Sarvi, 2018) , not much appears to have been done to study specific characteristics of crowd control during health emergencies of this nature which require spatial distancing measures. At the early stages of the pandemic, before extreme lockdown measures were in place in many geographical regions, certain societies had introduced more moderate measures to mitigate the risk of potential outbreaks that involved keeping the density of human congregation in public spaces below certain thresholds. Similar measures could be expected during the transition from strict isolation measures back to more moderate measures once the acute severity of this public health emergency diminishes. We assume that these unprecedented challenges should require the expertise of the researchers active in this domain to propose methods and solutions for how to enforce such restrictions regarding crowd management and safety. Such research could be highly relevant in open public spaces such as parks, recreational areas, and beaches, in closed public spaces such as grocery shops, university buildings and particularly hospital emergency departments (Chen et al., 2020c) , also in closed spaces such as office buildings, cruise vessels, or airplanes (Eldin et al., 2020) as well as public or shared transport vehicles .",

It is assumed that, during the evacuation process, if appropriate measures are not taken to manage the evacuation process, a hasty unregulated evacuation in such instances could itself lead to heightened levels of spatial human concentration which can elevate the risk of contracting the virus for evacuees, particularly in high-occupancy buildings. In light of these concerns, we suggest that evacuation experts could revisit and further study the particular issues relevant to this problem and to propose appropriate methods and solutions for evacuation safety.",
