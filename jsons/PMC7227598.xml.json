Without taking into consideration the infection multiplier factor, and assuming no effective antidotes are out and distributed at this time, we can expect more than six million confirmed cases to surface on our planet by the later part of May 2020 with the death rate and other derogatory impacts to increase proportionately.",

Nevertheless, while the survival rates are relatively high, any healthcare system will soon cripple itself as the infection spreads without properly targeting quarantines, having the needed supplies while awaiting an effective cure. Aside from massively increasing the number of COVID-19 tests and contact tracing, the only working strategy at this stage has been to plank the curve via social distancing and regulated quarantines or mandated lockdown for slowing down the spread of the virus. Many nations are applying these tactics to cities, municipalities, states, or even the entire country. While these strategies have proven to be somewhat useful, as we have learned from nations such as China and South Korea, there is now the possibility of a second (or even a third) wave where returning residents from affected countries continue to revive the spread as experienced in countries and special administrative regions such as Hong Kong, Singapore and even China.",

Literacy will accommodate compliances and discipline. We can only offer some practical recommendations while COVID-19 is still at an experimental and emotionally draining stage.\u2022\nEducation\n: The world of education needs to incorporate a component on a possible pandemic, at an early stage of the education continuum. The majority of the world population appears to have limited knowledge of a health-related, infectious epidemic and its widespread impact. With COVID-19, many are being educated, and subsequently, having an appreciation of the seriousness of the issues and the impact of an pandemic.\u2022\nThe Business of Educational Continuity: With virtual learning technology and continuous advancements, all post-secondary institutions need to establish a standby cloud-based \u201cacademic continuity\u201d paradigm. Most schools and colleges are closed, and not all institutions around the globe have an instantly deployable online learning infrastructure. Many courses, especially in post-secondary education, are not designed for virtual continuity with substitute teachers in case the assigned instructor(s) may no longer be available. The sudden pause will delay graduation, and it might be a year or two before a student completes the degree. The Department of Education notified all post-secondary institutions \u201cThe Department is providing broad approval to institutions to use online technologies to accommodate students on a temporary basis, without going through the regular approval process of the Department in the event that an institution is otherwise required to seek Departmental approval for the use or expansion of distance learning programs\u201d [10]. A standardized online education platform, as we know, cannot be established overnight.\u2022\nThe potential of AI in Education\n: AI has been changing the world, including education. AI is changing the way we work, the way we learn, and the way we live [23]. A special report by The Chronicle of Higher Education suggests, ``Colleges should offer all students, regardless of the field of study, opportunities to learn about AI'' [28]. As we noted earlier, the potential of AI in pandemic preparedness is limitless. We strongly recommend an exposure to AI methods and models to the students, researchers, and public health officials to have an appreciation for the new world of technology and automation. We need to incorporated AI in Public Health Informatics and in the overall curriculum. For example, AI literacy as a required component of the STEM education in the K12 sector as well as in the higher education STEM areas should be mandated in the US. Many nations are in the process of incorporating AI on all floors of the education system [26].\u2022\nAI in China\n: China has taken a major initiative to educate the college population in AI. AI is the fastest growing discipline in China's universities, with 180 new approved majors, up from 35 the year before. The ramping up of approvals comes as China attempts to attract more talent to drive what has been referred to as the fourth industrial revolution [25].\u2022\nAI in Europe\n: AI is a significant initiative in the education of European Union (EU). The EU has adopted a Digital Education Action Plan, which includes 11 actions to support the technology use and development of digital competences in education. From the secondary to the post-secondary science curriculum, AI appears to be a required component [12]. In comparison, the US education continuum seems to have made some progress but still lags. AI in the US remains a playground for the giant tech sector. Unfortunately, the US Tech Giants appear to have a limited role in combating COVID-19 with strategic innovations, thus far, although there is some news emerging on how Google and Apple are collaborating on virtually enhancing the contact tracing efforts.\n",
