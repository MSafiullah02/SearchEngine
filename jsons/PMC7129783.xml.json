A novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV) was isolated from patients with SARS (Peiris et al., 2003a, Drosten et al., 2003, Ksiazek et al., 2003). Seroconversion to SARS-CoV was found in the majority of SARS patients (Peiris et al., 2003a, Peiris et al., 2003b). By contrast, none of the patients with other respiratory disease and healthy blood donors had detectable antibody (Peiris et al., 2003a, Peiris et al., 2003b). Furthermore, experimental infection of cynomolgus macaques (Macaca fascicularis) confirmed the hypothesis that this newly discovered SARS-CoV is the aetiological agent of SARS (Fouchier et al., 2003, Kuiken et al., 2003). Thus, this novel virus fulfills all Koch's postulates as the primary aetiological agent of SARS.",

            "text": "The clinical case definition of SARS is essentially one of fever and pneumonia, with or without a contact history. There are many causes of pneumonia and in the absence of a definite history of contact with other patients with SARS, it is not easy to differentiate SARS from other causes of pneumonia. Laboratory tests that can confirm a diagnosis of SARS-CoV infection early in the course of the illness are therefore a critical clinical need. It allows prompt patient management, isolation and quarantine, thereby minimizing the risk of having large-scale outbreaks in hospitals or in local communities (Riley et al., 2003). Serology is a sensitive and specific diagnostic approach but seroconversion can only be detected around day 10 of illness and in some patients, especially if they have been treated with immunomodulator drugs such as steroids, may be delayed until the 3rd or 4th week of the disease. In any event, they only provide a retrospective diagnosis. Detection of virus by RT-PCR in clinical specimens offers the option of diagnosis in the early stage of the disease (Poon et al., 2003a). However, in contrast with many other acute respiratory infections (e.g. influenza) (Kaiser et al., 1999), our previous studies demonstrated that viral loads in NPA are low in the first few days of illness and peak around day 10 of the disease (Peiris et al., 2003b). This profile of viral activity poses a challenge for the diagnosis of SARS during the first few days of the illness, the period when such a diagnosis would be most useful, both for patient management and public health. The clinical sensitivity of first generation RT-PCR methods during the first few days of disease has been low and much better sensitivity is obtained after day 6 of the illness (Peiris et al., 2003b). On the other hand, the gradual increase in viral load implies that the window for effective therapeutic intervention with an antiviral is wider than that with other respiratory viral diseases such as respiratory syncytial virus or influenza infections.",

Using our first generation conventional RT-PCR assay (Peiris et al., 2003a, Peiris et al., 2003b), only 22% of these samples were shown to have SARS-CoV RNA. In order to establish a more sensitive assay, we modified the RNA extraction method and adapted the quantitative technology in our current study. By increasing the initial volume for RNA extraction from 140 to 540 \u03bcl, the proportion of positive cases was increased to 44%. In addition, by further applying the real-time quantitative PCR technology in the revised assay, 80% of early SARS samples became positive. More importantly, the use of a 5\u2032 nuclease probe in the real-time quantitative assay can minimize the false positive rate due to an increased in signal specificity. Taken together, results from this study suggested that our revised RT-PCR assay allows the early and accurate diagnosis of SARS.",
