The results have been divided into five categories for general markers and four categories for hematopathology markers (Table 7 -2).

The actual markers used to evaluate a case depend upon the differential diagnosis based on the H&E appearance. In some cases, an initial panel that is often used for typical cases has been suggested.

Poorly differentiated carcinomas, metaplastic carcinomas, and medullary carcinomas are usually negative.Well and moderately differentiated lobular carcinomas are almost always positive for ER, and usually positive for PR. Poorly differentiated lobular carcinomas may be negative for these markers. c Non-mucinous bronchiolo-alveolar carcinomas (BAL) have an immunophenotype similar to lung adenocarcinomas. Mucinous BALs are more likely to be CK20 positive (approximately 70% positive) and less likely to be TTF-1 positive (approximately 30% positive). d Secretory meningiomas are frequently positive for CK7 and CEA, whereas other subtypes are usually negative for CK7 and CEA.The majority of all types of meningiomas are positive for PR (including meningiomas in males). e Mixed tumors (pleomorphic adenomas) occur most frequently in the salivary glands, but can also arise in soft tissues (myoepithelial tumors of soft tissue).These tumors have a similar immunophenotype with keratin (AE1/AE3 77%) or PANK (68%) or EMA (63%) present in the majority of tumors and frequent expression of markers associated with myoepithelial cells (e.g., calponin, GFAP, SMA, S100, p63). However, p63 is seen less frequently (23%) as compared to salivary tumors (100%). f Chromophobe renal cell carcinomas may be positive for WT-1. Other types are negative.

However, these proteins are found in many other cell types and are not specific for this tumor. k Keratin and EMA positivity are usually only focal in monophasic synovial sarcomas. l Claudin-1 is positive in glandular areas of synovial sarcoma but less so in spindle cell areas. m The immunohistochemical pattern for epithelioid mesotheliomas is given in Table 7 -30. n WT-1 may be positive in a minor epithelioid component of sarcomatoid mesotheliomas, but is generally negative in the spindle cells. o Secretory meningiomas are typically cytokeratin 7 positive (CK20 negative) and also positive for CEA. Other subtypes are generally negative for keratin. However, malignant meningiomas may be positive for keratin. p Squamous cell carcinomas with a spindle cell morphology are generally strongly positive for AE1/AE3 (less commonly for CAM 5.2), EMA, and p63. Spindle cell carcinomas of the breast often express markers expressed by myoepithelial cells such as \"basal keratins\" (including cytokeratin 14 which is included in the group detected by PANK or MNF-116), smooth muscle \u03b1-actin, and p63. Poorly differentiated carcinomas with spindle cell morphology may only show focal positivity for keratins and EMA. Although used for these tumors in the past, these studies are currently not usually performed. c MART-1 is also frequently positive in melanomas. d Small cell carcinomas of the lung are positive for TTF-1. e Merkel cell carcinomas demonstrate a dot-like perinuclear pattern for most markers. f Significant immunoreactivity is a membrane pattern in the majority of the cells. g Some plasma cell lymphomas may be positive. Ewing's sarcoma (PNET), desmoplastic small round cell tumor, rhabdomyosarcoma, neuroblastoma, and medulloblastoma have characteristic cytogenetic changes (see Table 7 -33). EM has some advantages over immunohistochemistry in the evaluation of childhood small round blue cell tumors. 11 Initial panel. Keratin, S100, LCA. Additional studies may be helpful depending on the histologic appearance and the results of the initial studies. Most cases of Paget's disease of the nipple are associated with DCIS deeper in the breast and involve the lactiferous sinuses, and approximately half will also have areas of invasion. Rare cases may be difficult to interpret due to the absence of associated disease in the breast or if the initial biopsy is shallow. In some cases, Paget cells may take up melanin and may be difficult to distinguish from melanoma.Toker cells in nipple epidermis are CAM 5.2 and CK7 positive but negative for HER2/neu. Initial panel. CAM 5.2 (or CK7), HER2, and S100 with additional antibody studies based on these findings, if necessary. Cases of extramammary Paget's disease are more likely to be CK20 positive and less likely to be positive for HER2/neu (less than 40%). are also sometimes positive. p63 is a good general marker for myoepithelial cells and is particularly helpful in cases with prominent myofibroblasts (e.g., sclerosing lesions) or with blood vessels closely apposed to tumor cells (e.g., papillary fronds in papillary DCIS). In some cases, SMA may be positive in more cells than p63. Table 7 -32). Renal cell carcinoma subtypes have typical cytogenetic abnormalities (see Table 7 -33).

In some cases more than one name is commonly used. Antibodies with asterisks appear in the Tables. Most CD numbers correspond to a specific gene product.
