[1] [2] [3] Hot flashes are the most common and distressing symptom and the leading cause for seeking medical attention during this period. 4, 5 They are commonly associated with nighttime awakenings, causing insomnia and fatigue. [6] [7] [8] Current treatment options are limited. Hormone therapy is effective in many women but associated with increased risk of hormone-dependent cancers and thrombosis and specifically contraindicated in women with history of hormone-sensitive cancers. 9 Hormone therapy may also take several months to improve symptoms and may have limited effects on nighttime awakening. 10, 11 These limitations preclude its use in many women. Low-dose paroxetine is licensed for use in some countries but has modest efficacy and some tolerability concerns, as do other nonhormone therapies. 12, 13 A safe, effective alternative to hormonal treatments is urgently needed.",

            "text": "Evidence supports a functional role for neurokinin (NK) receptor systems in hot flash etiology through hypothalamic mechanisms. [14] [15] [16] Kisspeptin, neurokinin B, and dynorphin (KNDy) neurons in the hypothalamus are hypertrophied in postmenopausal women and have elevated gene expression levels of kisspeptin, NKB (endogenous ligand for NK 3 receptor), and substance P (SP) (endogenous ligand for NK 1 receptor). [17] [18] [19] [20] [21] [22] The NK 3 receptor and its NKB ligand in particular have been implicated in hot flash etiology. 17, 18, 23, 24 Proof-of-concept studies and more recently a fully powered phase 2b study with NK 3 receptor antagonists have provided clinical evidence that NK 3 receptor blockade rapidly reduces both the number and the severity of hot flashes. 14, 15, 25, 26 NK 1 receptors and SP may also contribute to the control of vasomotor symptoms. SP immunoreactivity is frequently colocalized with kisspeptin and NKB in the infundibular region 22, 27 of the hypothalamus. Additionally, in the periphery, NK 1 receptor desensitization attenuates cutaneous blood vessel dilatation 28 and infusion of SP causes vasodilatation and flushing of the face and neck characteristic of postmenopausal hot flashes. 29 We, therefore, hypothesized that NT-814, a selective antagonist of both NK 1 and NK 3 receptors, would reduce hot flashes and waking due to night sweats in postmenopausal women and conducted the RELENT-1 study to evaluate the pharmacokinetics and safety (primary endpoints) and efficacy (exploratory endpoints) of NT-814.",

Postmenopausal women aged 40 to 65 years with an average of 7 to 20 moderate to severe hot flashes per day (as recorded in a 2-week patient-reported baseline diary), <50% change in average daily frequency between the first and second weeks of the baseline diary, and no active ongoing health condition that could have caused difficulty in interpreting hot flash symptoms were enrolled at three clinical research units in the United States. Menopause was defined as 12 months of spontaneous amenorrhea or 6 weeks after surgical bilateral oophorectomy, with or without hysterectomy. Participants were required to discontinue any medications that may have affected the number or severity of hot flashes or which may have interacted pharmacokinetically with NT-814 before the start of the baseline period and were not permitted to take these medications at any time during the study.

The hypertrophy of hypothalamic KNDy neurons in postmenopausal women (with elevated gene expression levels of kisspeptin, NKB, and SP) [17] [18] [19] [20] [21] [22] are a consequence of estrogen withdrawal; in cynomolgus monkeys these features can be induced by oophorectomy and reversed by estrogen replacement. [32] [33] [34] KNDy neurons branch extensively within the infundibular nucleus and are linked to the medial preoptic nucleus, which has been identified as the estrogen-sensitive thermoregulation control center. 23, 35 It is hypothesized that after menopause KNDy neurons are in a hyperactive state (consistent with the observed hypertrophy) that disrupts thermoregulation and triggers hot flashes. 23 This hypothesis is supported by clinical studies with other NK 3 receptor antagonists that showed NK 3 receptor blockade rapidly reduces both the number and the severity of hot flashes. 14, 15, 25, 26 Additionally, a genome-wide association study demonstrated that NK 3 receptor gene variation may influence hot flash risk. 36 Hot flashes are also a symptom of carcinoid syndrome, in which SP levels are elevated. 37 Although NK 1 antagonism alone appears to be ineffective for hot flashes, 38 Phase 2 studies have shown efficacy for NK 1 receptor antagonists in mood [39] [40] [41] and primary insomnia, 42 so a compound such as NT-814 that also has NK 1 antagonist properties may also improve sleep and other comorbidities associated with menopausal symptoms.",

            "text": "Strengths of this study included its randomized, doubleblind, placebo-controlled design, standardized procedures and assessments, and precise postmenopausal population definition. However, the relatively stringent selection criteria may have resulted in a less generalizable study population. Limitations of the study are the small group sizes and short duration, although both were sufficient to enable a preliminary assessment of the efficacy of NT-814 as a treatment for postmenopausal hot flashes to be made before progressing to larger and longer studies. Although diary recording of hot flash symptoms is the standard method for symptom assessment, it shares the limitations of other patient-reported outcome assessments. These assessments are subjective and, despite randomization and blinding, placebo responses of 50% or more are common. 43, 44 In RELENT-1, participants taking placebo had improvements of 37% in mean hot flash frequency and 15% in mean severity in the second week of TROWER ET AL Change from baseline is presented as change in least-squares mean and 95% confidence interval. CONCLUSIONS In this first study of NT-814 in postmenopausal women with hot flash symptoms, once-daily treatment resulted in a rapid, marked improvement in hot flashes and waking due to night sweats with statistically significant effects at the 150 mg and 300 mg doses. The effect at these doses was immediate, beginning in the first week of treatment, and also sustained, improving symptoms more in the second week of treatment than in the first. Lower doses (50 mg and 100 mg once daily) were not effective. No safety concerns were identified for NT-814. Doses up to 300 mg were well tolerated. Most adverse events were mild. The most common adverse events were headache and somnolence that was intermittent and limited in duration. The findings from the evaluation of this nonhormone dual NK 1 and NK 3 receptor antagonist support both modulation of NK receptors as a treatment for hot flashes and other menopauserelated symptoms and the further assessment of NT-814 as a potential therapy for treating these symptoms.",
