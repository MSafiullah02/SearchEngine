Recently, several reports have demonstrated the use of RNAi in blocking virus infection and replication in animal cells (Ge et al. 2003) , suggesting that the small interfering RNA (siRNA, 21-25 nt long) plays an important role in RNAi-related gene silencing pathways (Elbashir et al. 2001) . Progress has been made in anti-HIV and anti-HCV drug design by applying the method of RNA interference (Wilson et al. 2003) . The effectiveness of siRNA for inhibiting SARS coronavirus genes expression was also demonstrated by Shi et al. (2005) . Besides silencing the targeted genes, the siRNAs can also inhibit the replication of the virus. For example, it has been demonstrated that, by targeting the Leader sequence of SARS-CoV, the siRNA demonstrate a strong inhibitory effect on SARS-CoV replication (Li et al. 2005) . More recently, a CRISPR/Cas13d system was proposed for the treatment of SARS-COV-2 (Nguyen et al. 2020) . These results indicate that both RNAi and CRISPR/ Cas technology might become potential therapeutic approaches for treating viral diseases.",
