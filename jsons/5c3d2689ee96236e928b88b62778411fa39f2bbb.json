At present, 75 the outbreak in China has been essentially controlled. More than 100 countries are now 76 facing and dealing with COVID-19 epidemic around the world such as America, Spain, 77 Italy, Germany Iran, France, the United Kingdom and South Korea\uff0cetc. 78 For an unprecedented epidemic such as COVID-19, it is important to assess its (Zhang, 2020) . However, 96 there were still 38909 hospitalized cases among 44672 confirmed cases. There is a large 97 deviation in the COVID-19 case fatality rates from the current literature and official 98 announcements (Battegay et al., 2020) . Therefore, it is unreasonable to integrate all 99 hospitalized patients into the denominator to calculate the case fatality. Another reason 100 is that the death dates are later than the diagnosis dates during the period of the outbreak, 101 which could increase the error of the estimation of case fatality rate. These two reasons 102 will lead to underestimate the case fatality rates of COVID-19 when the epidemic is 103 still ongoing. China is the first affected and the first recovery country in the outbreak.",

Since the occurrence of the epidemic in China, 82 case fatality rates of COVID-19 have been examined in many literature. However, the 83 literature on case fatality rates of COVID-19 has several limitations. When a pandemic 84 is still ongoing, the resulting number (the number of deaths dividing by the number of 85 confirmed cases), called naive case fatality rate, does not represent the true case fatality 86 rate (Kucharski and Edmunds, 2014). One reason is ignoring patients who are still 87 hospitalized. The outbreak is not over so the numbers of confirmed cases, cured cases 88 and deaths are still subject to change.

The case fatality rate is the ratio of the number of deaths dividing by the 82 number of confirmed cases over a certain period of time, which is the most direct 83 index to reflect the lethality of the disease. Since the occurrence of the epidemic in 84 China, case fatality rates of COVID-19 have been examined in many literature. 85 However, the literature on case fatality rates of COVID-19 has several limitations. 86 When a pandemic is still ongoing, the resulting number (the number of deaths 87 dividing by the number of confirmed cases), called naive case fatality rate, does not 88 represent the true case fatality rate (Kucharski and Edmunds, 2014). One reason is 89 ignoring patients who are still hospitalized. The outbreak is not over so the numbers 90 of confirmed cases, cured cases and deaths are still subject to change. Hospitalized 91 patients will be either recover or die in the future. Huang CL et al reported that 41 92 confirmed patients had been discharged, 6 patients died (15%), and the remaining 7 93 patients were still hospitalized (Huang et al., 2020).

The number of 190 daily newly confirmed cases in China increased from early January, 2020, peaked in 191 the first half of February, and then gradually dropped (Figure 2A). The percentage of 192 the daily newly confirmed cases of China except Hubei and China was over 50% from 193 Jan 18 to Jan 26 and then sustained a downward trend. After January, the daily 194 numbers of newly confirmed cases in China except Hubei were much less than those 195 in China.

The mortality rates of COVID-19 The current outbreak of COVID-19 has become a pandemic and the globalJ o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f outbreak is getting worse. The assessment of hazards of the outbreak is important to its hazard assessment. However, the high proportion of hospitalized patients and the intervals between diagnosis dates and death dates or cure dates increased the deviation of the estimation of the case fatality rate during the outbreak, especially in the early stage. Based on the average death time and average cure time, we speculated the endpoint (cure and death) of the confirmed cases on the estimated diagnosis date, and obtained the case fatality rate and cure rate and of COVID-19. The new estimated method can avoid the interference of hospitalized cases and the delay of cure dates or death dates. We collected 8273581171 confirmed COVID-19 cases in China. The majority of the confirmed cases (8382%) in China are mainly from Hubei Province. Hence, we analyzed the characteristics of COVID-19 cases in China and China except Hubei. The number of daily newly confirmed cases in China increased from early January, 2020. In order to block the route of transmission, the government of China announced traffic control, robust containment and control activities. The spread of the virus was slowed through the implementation of the blockade(Organization, 2020b). The outbreak has been basically controlled in China in March. In brief, on February 17, WHO's director general said that patients with COVID-19 have a \"mild disease and will recover\" and that it is fatal in 2% of reported cases. The Novel Coronavirus Pneumonia Emergency Response Epidemiology Team reported that the case fatality rate of COVID-19 was approximately 2.3% depending on 1023 deaths among 44672 confirmed cases. a period, cured time or death time after diagnosis. Based on media cure or death time obtained from individual cases, the estimated diagnosis dates of cure cases and deaths were speculated. Using the number of deaths and cured cases on the same estimated diagnosis date to calculate daily case fatality rate could not only avoid the interference of hospitalized cases and time delay of, which reflect the actual situation of deaths.The instant case fatality rate of COVID-19 in China continuously increased from 4% to 15% in mid-Jan, 2020. Since then, the treatment concept and methods have been, the treatment level has improved, and the treatment procedure has become increasingly e standardized. The case fatality rate gradually declined and stabilized at 331 4.12%.
