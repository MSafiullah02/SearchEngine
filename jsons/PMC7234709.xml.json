Source control has three main components: 1) preventing employees who are sick from being at work; 2) limiting the spread of droplets from coughing by applying masks to those with a cough and encouraging employees to cough into their elbow and not their hand or into the open air; and 3) encouraging frequent hand washing. The CDC recommends washing hands with soap and water for more than 20 seconds or using a hand sanitizer with at least 60\u201395% alcohol.14 Minimizing the sharing of computers and tools between employees is recommended, as is frequent cleaning of surfaces that employees contact such as door knobs, countertops, keyboards, and phones. This recommendation aims to eliminate the virus\u2019 spread when source control may have failed.15 Most of the common cleaning agents registered with the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) are believed effective in disinfecting surfaces from COVID-19. Alternatively, a mix of five tablespoons household bleach in one gallon of water can be used.16 Current information on which cleaning agents can be used on SARS-CoV-2 can be found on the EPA website.17",

This involves requesting that employees remain at home if they are sick.14,15 Although this concept may be a sharp departure from cultural norms of being a team player and toughing out illness while at work, it is essential to protect the ability of the public safety workforce to provide adequate staffing to the community. Each agency should identify how absences due to illness will be categorized during this pandemic. For employees who may not have paid sick or vacation days available, finding a mechanism to provide compensation while the employee is unable to work may eliminate part of the incentive an employee may feel to hide his or her symptoms in order to remain at work.",
