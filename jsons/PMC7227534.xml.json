Media reporting inclines heavily towards highlighting high impact events such as infectious disease outbreaks leading to public panic (e.g. Blendon et al., 2004, Mairal, 2011, Young et al., 2013). The news related to infectious diseases can cause alarm and influences investors\u2019 sentiments (e.g. Tetlock, 2007). The recent outbreak of COVID-19 has had an impact on almost all countries. The US market and similarly world markets have seen a decline of nearly 30% within the first quarter of 2020.",

            "text": "In times of unprecedented access to news and information, individuals (including investors) find it difficult to accurately assess the economic significance and impact of such information. Using evidence from psychology literature, Barberis et al. (1998) demonstrate that financial markets overreact to consistent pattern of news, even though statistically the weight put on such news should be low. Earlier studies revealed at best a weak or moderate relationship between quantum of news and activity (volume, volatility, prices) in financial markets (e.g. Mitchell and Mulherin, 1994, Berry and Howe, 1994). However, Ederington and Lee (1994), observe that scheduled macroeconomic news announcements explain a significant portion of the volatility in financial markets. Klibanoff et al. (1998) also find evidence of market overreaction to prominence of news in the context of closed end mutual funds. As the world became more connected and information flows became almost instantaneous, the use of computers and artificial intelligence for reading, interpreting and making financial decisions based on news became a viable trading strategy (Gro\u00df-Klu\u00dfmann and Hautsch, 2011). There have also been studies finding news sentiment useful for asset allocation by portfolio managers (e.g. Uhl et al., 2015).",

We extend this stream of literature with a specific bent on health crisis by exploring whether the media reporting of covid-19, panic amongst investors, and the global sentiment has played a role in the previously unseen volatility in the equity markets. Earlier literature argues that unbalanced reporting of healthcare crises leads to disjoint in actual versus perceived risks leading to over/under reaction of sentiment. (Vasterman et al., 2005, Mairal, 2011, Young et al., 2013 etc.). Furthermore this paper adds to the currently scant literature on understanding the stock market reaction to the covid-19 pandemic.",

Secondly we focus our analysis on sector level, adding to the heterogeneity literature in financial markets (See: Westerlund and Narayan, 2015, Bannigidadmath and Narayan, 2016, Phan et al., 2015a, Phan et al., 2015b, Rizvi and Arshad, 2018). The overall message emanating from this literature suggests that sectors and stocks are heterogenous, and aggregated index level analysis assumes homogeneity in stock market return and volatility profiling. Third dimension of literature where this paper contributes is the impact of media coverage originated sentiment to panic in financial markets (See: Tetlock, 2007, Barberis et al., 1998, Uhl et al., 2015).",

We analyze the relationship between news coverage and ensuing generation of sentiments on volatility of financial markets.
