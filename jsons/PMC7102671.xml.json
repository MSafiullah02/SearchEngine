Both upper (nasopharyngeal swabs) and lower (bronchoalveolar wash or lavage) specimens were included. Patients were considered to have a lower-tract infection if they had a positive lower-tract specimen or upper respiratory specimen along with either lower respiratory symptoms (cough, wheezing) or decline in forced expiratory volume. LTxRs in the control group had no evidence of symptomatic RVI during the period of serum collection. Post-transplant immunosuppression comprised a triple immunosuppressive regimen of tacrolimus or cyclosporine, mycophenolate mofetil or azathioprine, and prednisone. This study was approved by the Institutional Review Boards at Washington University and St. Joseph's Hospital.

Our results, presented in Figure 1, demonstrated that Ab titers to SAgs were significantly higher in patients diagnosed with RVI than in stable LTxRs. This demonstrates that RVI can induce a humoral immune response to SAgs. Circulating exosomes isolated from LTxRs diagnosed with BOS express mismatched donor HLA and SAgs (Col-V and K\u03b11T), confirming their source as the lung allograft and suggesting that exosomes can induce immune responses to alloantigens and SAgs, increasing the risk for CLAD.21 Walker et al30 demonstrated that exosomes released from CMV-infected lung endothelial cells of LTxRs induces CD4 T-cell responses to CMV antigens. Furthermore, a human nasopharyngeal cell line transfected with Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) has been shown to release exosomes containing viral peptide latent membrane protein 1 and fibroblast growth factor 2.31 The exosomes isolated from EBV-transformed B cells contain EBV viral antigen glycoprotein 350, which can specifically bind to B cells.32 These findings support our hypothesis that RVI has the potential to induce exosomes containing lung SAgs and viral antigens from the transplant recipient with RVI.",

In this study, we selected patients diagnosed with RSV, coronavirus, and rhinovirus and demonstrated that exosomes isolated from these patients contained specific viral antigens along with SAgs. Therefore, exosomes are induced following viral infection that contain viral antigens and SAgs. Preliminary analysis of serial circulating exosomes containing viral antigens demonstrated that in 3 of 5 LTxRs, there was a transient presence of circulating exosomes. In contrast, 2 of 5 LTxRs with RVI had persistence of circulating exosomes with lung SAgs and viral antigens. This interesting finding needs to be confirmed to determine the role of circulating exosomes in inducing immune responses leading to CLAD. It is likely that the exosomes with viral antigenic epitopes can activate cross-reactive T cells, which can play a role in the pathogenesis of CLAD after LTx.33\n,\n34 We demonstrated that exosomes isolated from symptomatic patients with RVI contained increased SAgs and viral antigens; if further studies identify a useful threshold concentration, this could potentially serve as a biomarker for CLAD.",

Mice immunized with exosomes from RVI developed increased levels of Abs to SAgs than mice immunized with exosomes from stable LTxRs.

Therefore, we cannot definitively conclude that exosomes from patients with RVI can increase the incidence of CLAD development. The sample size used in the mouse model was small and we used pooled exosomes for immunization. Therefore, the role of individual viruses in inducing exosomes that are immunogenic cannot be concluded from the studies presented. We have shown that serum samples collected from LTxRs with RVI had increased Abs to lung SAgs and exosomes containing lung SAgs and viral antigens compared with stable LTxRs. However, viral RNA in the exosomes and its role in immune activation needs to be determined in future studies. Another limitation is that the role of individual RVI viruses to induce exosomes that can increase the risk for CLAD were not determined because of the limited availability of retrospectively collected samples. Our study, however, demonstrated that exosomes derived from LTxRs with RVI-induced interstitial fibrosis and inflammatory cell infiltration by adoptive transfer of exosomes (gain of function) in a mice model, which suggests that RVI exosomes are sufficient to induce lesions in mice with similarities to the pathology seen in restrictive allograft syndrome in human LTxRs.",
