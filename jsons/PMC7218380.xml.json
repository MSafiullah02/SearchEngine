Yet, many educators are not prepared to implement these alternative methods. Additionally, because of the cessation of nursing students allowed to practice in hospitals and clinics and complete needed clinical hours, undergraduate and graduate nursing programs alike are taxed with satisfying these clinical requirements. This means that all didactic, clinical, and lab courses are being taught remotely \u2013 never has there been a better time for debriefing across the curriculum (National League for Nursing [NLN] Board of Governors, 2015).",

However, the importance of a robust debriefing as a component of these learning opportunities is often neglected, which could be to the detriment of the students. Extant simulation research has generated a base of knowledge exclaiming the importance of post-simulation debriefing which cannot be ignored during this current crisis. Now that the initial rush to a rapid solution has passed, it is time to pause, reflect, and return to the undisputable evidence that describes how the active learning occurring through alternate virtual learning activities requires a robust debriefing aligned with current simulation best practices and regulatory recommendations. Going forward, we need to evaluate our hurried solutions and ensure adherence to best practices in online education, simulation and debriefing (INACSL Standards Committee, 2016; Standards from the Quality Matters Higher Education Rubric) in both prelicensure and graduate programs.",

Debriefing increases students\u2019 ability to develop clinical reasoning and clinical judgment which are essential to thinking like a nurse. While debriefing has traditionally occurred as a face-to-face conversation following a simulation or traditional patient care experience, the restrictions of the current pandemic demands a quick conversion to a virtual format. In fact, with the recommendation for debriefing use across nursing curricula (NLN Board of Governors, 2015), the current crisis of offering virtual didactic and clinical course experiences brings debriefing to the forefront of learning in higher education.",

As a result of the race to provide distance learning quickly, many faculty are using reflective journaling and guided questions submitted to written discussion boards through the Learning Management System (LMS) as a way for students to gather and share their reflections on virtual clinical learning activities. These are not new strategies for nursing education and while they can be a valuable way to direct students to focus on their individual thoughts and responses to an experience, this is not a replacement for a faculty-guided, verbal, interactive and reflective discussion. In fact, the rich dialogue that defines debriefing as a dynamic two-way conversation is missing, leaving students without this valuable time when faculty facilitate reflection and anticipatory.",

It is in this debriefing dialogue that the thought processes of students are made visible to both students and faculty so that deeper learning can take place. Regardless of the activity, debriefing provides the opportunity for students to see a teacher\u2019s passion for nursing paired with their teaching expertise. As students and faculty alike are becoming overwhelmed with long days of screen time, it is even more imperative that faculty connect with students on a deeper level to create meaningful learning through verbal interaction. If learning to think remains a critical learning outcome then reflective dialogue should be at the forefront of debriefing rather than computer-generated feedback alone (Dreifuerst et al., in press).",

During this pandemic, where students and faculty are both situated in new and vulnerable situations, debriefing is the space to teach students to think like a nurse by fostering reflection, conveying enthusiasm grounded in strong narrative pedagogy that is welcoming and inviting students into a rich dialogue (Ironside, 2015), and setting high standards challenging students to rise to them and immerse themselves in preparing for practice through teaching and learning at a distance.Key Points\n\u2022The current crisis of offering virtual didactic and clinical course experiences brings debriefing to the forefront of learning.\u2022Evidence-based debriefing is based on strong pedagogy that is engaging and enthusiastic.\u2022Despite long days of screen time, it is even more imperative to connect with students to create meaningful learning through a rich verbal debriefing dialogue.\n\n",
