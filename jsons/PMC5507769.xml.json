Varying degrees of fibrosis were also observed in autopsies of fatal cases. Although pulmonary fibrotic changes are occasionally observed as sequelae of other respiratory viral infections, they appear to be more common following SARS coronavirus (SARS-CoV) infection.",

In this article, we summarize observations of pulmonary fibrosis during and after the SARS epidemic, note the extent to which fibrosis occurs after other pulmonary viral infections, describe efforts to recapitulate fibrotic changes in mouse models of SARS, and review evidence that the condition represents a hyperactive response to lung injury, driven by proinflammatory mediators acting through epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) signaling. We summarize work by our group and others indicating that inhibitors of EGFR may be useful in preventing an excessive fibrotic response in SARS and other respiratory viral infections, and indicate directions for future research.",

            "text": "Several studies have been conducted on patients who have resolved SARS-CoV infection. Many studies have reported an increased incidence of fibrosis in patients, even after SARS-CoV had been cleared. In one study, 45% of patients showed a \u201cground-glass\u201d appearance, an indication of fibrosis, by chest X-ray scores and high-resolution computerized tomography by one month after infection (Xie et al., 2005) (Fig. 1\nA). Ground-glass opacification in the lungs describes regions that display a hazy attenuated signal under CT imaging, without obscuring normal bronchial and vascular structures. The differential diagnosis for ground-glass opacification can be an infection, pulmonary edema, interstitial thickening or fibrotic deposits (Collins and Stern, 1997). In a second study looking at the intermediate recovery periods of 3 and 6 months after infection, fibrotic features, including abnormal scoring of airspace opacity and reticular shadowing, were seen in 36% and 30% of the patients respectively (D. S. Hui et al., 2005a, Hui et al., 2005b). A one year follow-up study on 97 recovering SARS patients in Hong Kong showed that 27.8% of SARS survivors showed decreased lung function and increased lung fibrosis compared to a normal population (David S. Hui et al., 2005a, Hui et al., 2005b). Other follow-up studies have shown similar results (D. S. Hui et al., 2005a, Hui et al., 2005b, Ngai et al., 2010, Ngai et al., 2010). The molecular pathways responsible for the development of SARS-CoV induced fibrosis observed in recovered patients are not well understood. This gap in knowledge limits the development of novel therapies targeting the development of fibrosis or the repurposing of existing treatments that may be effective against SARS-CoV induced fibrosis after infection.",

When the SARS-CoV (Urbani) strain is used to intranasally infect BALB/c, C57B/6, or 129/S strains of mice, there is viral replication in the lungs with no spread to other organs (Glass et al., 2004, Roberts et al., 2005, Subbarao et al., 2004). Infection is found to cause focal peribronchiolar and perivascular inflammation by 3 days post infection. Through 7 days post infection, SARS-CoV (Urbani) is largely cleared from lungs with minimal effects on weight loss or clinical symptoms of infection. Lung pathology over this time period is minimal as well, outside of the denuded bronchi around day 2 post infection. Minimally apparent peribronchiolar, perivascular or interstitial inflammation is noted in these infections.",

This virus carries 6 mutations in the genome: 4 in the replicase proteins and 2 in the structural proteins. In contrast to the SARS-CoV (Urbani) parent strain, the pulmonary pathology of mice infected with MA15 virus showed a rapid progression of inflammatory changes and more extensive damage to bronchiolar and alveolar epithelial cells.

Several knockout strains of mice infected with MA15 have identified immune factors that are critical for protection from SARS-CoV pathogenesis. To study the innate immune response to SARS-CoV, MyD88-/- mice were infected with MA15 which resulted in increased pulmonary inflammation and tissue damage with greater than 90% mortality by day 6 post-infection. In addition, MyD88\u2212/\u2212 mice had significantly higher SARS-CoV viral loads in lung tissue throughout the course of infection demonstrating a critical role of the MyD88 innate immune signaling pathway for clearance of and protection from SARS-CoV (Sheahan et al., 2008). In addition to MyD88, TLR3 signaling through the TRIF adapter protein has been shown to regulate SARS-CoV pathogenesis as well again showing that deletion of either critical innate immune signaling molecules led to more severe disease (Totura et al., 2015). Recently, the use of a systems biology approach combining pathogenesis and transcription profiling identified the urokinase pathway as a key node in controlling lung damage and fibrin deposition during SARS-CoV infection (Gralinski et al., 2013). In these experiments, Serpine1, which regulates the deposition of fibrin after lung damage, is shown to have regulatory control over lung pathogenesis in the MA15 mouse model of SARS-CoV.",

The authors attributed the findings to the role of STAT1 in interferon signaling. However, we have shown that the type I, II and III interferon pathways are largely dispensable for protection against SARS-CoV infection with mice deleted for the Type I IFN receptor, Type II IFN receptor or treated with IFN lambda neutralizing antibody displayed disease comparable with that seen in wildtype mice (Frieman et al., 2010). All were still permissive to SARS-CoV and displayed 10% weight loss during the first 4 days of the infection however they proceeded to regain weight and were able to reduce the levels of virus in their lungs through 9 days post infection. STAT1 knockout mice showed a higher propensity to develop fibrotic lesions compared to wild-type (WT) mice after SARS-CoV infection and showed increased pathogenesis even after SARS-CoV was cleared from lungs (Page et al., 2012) (Fig. 1B). Transcriptome analysis of SARS-CoV infected mouse lungs showed that STAT1 knockout mice developed a Th2 bias in their immune response (Zornetzer et al., 2010). The Th2 bias results in higher numbers of a subtype of macrophages in the lung, called alternatively activated macrophages (AAM), which in turn causes an overactive wound healing environment that induces pulmonary fibrosis (Page et al., 2012). AAMs are normally involved in clearing cell debris in damaged tissue after injury (Gordon, 2003). However in the study described in Page et al., AAMs are persistent in the lungs of Stat1 -/- mice where they become hyperactivated leading to increased fibrosis. This was similar to what was seen in a bleomycin induced fibrosis model where STAT1-/- mice developed higher rates of fibrosis after bleomycin treatment (Walters et al., 2005).",

Herpesviruses, such as Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) or human cytomegalovirus (HCMV), adenovirus, transfusion-transmitted virus (TTV, also known as Torque Teno Virus) and hepatitis C virus (HCV) have all been associated with IPF disease by detection of antibodies against viral proteins or viral gene products in lungs of IPF patients (Naik and Moore, 2010). Elevated serum levels of chemokines (such as transforming growth factor Beta 1 (TGF-\u03b21)) and development of pulmonary fibrosis have also been reported in influenza A (H1N1) virus-infected patients (Wen et al., 2011). Irrespective of the etiology, pulmonary fibrosis has been shown to develop after apparent recovery from the infection. These studies only correlate the presence of a virus with IPF and it is unclear if and how the viruses directly trigger the disease or just create the conditions required for the development of pulmonary fibrosis caused by a secondary trigger (e.g. toxins, particulates or radiation) (Naik and Moore, 2010, Wynn and Ramalingam, 2012). This suggests that the some of the pathways induced by SARS-CoV infection that lead to the observed pulmonary fibrosis may be shared irrespective of the damage inducing factor.",

To demonstrate mechanistic correlation between viral infection, ARDS and PF, mouse models of viral infection has been utilized. Animal studies have produced additional evidence that viruses can trigger fibrosis. Murine gamma-herpesvirus 68 (MHV-68) infects mouse lungs and was shown to trigger pulmonary fibrosis in interferon (IFN)-\u03b3 receptor knockout mice (IFN-gammaR -/-) (Mora et al., 2005). Additionally, when an anti-viral drug cidofovir was used post infection, it resulted in protection from pulmonary fibrosis (Mora et al., 2007). A similar protective effect was seen in infections involving a mutant MHV-68 that was defective for reactivation from latency suggesting a connection between virus life cycle and lung fibrosis for this virus (Mora et al., 2007).",

The first step is the injury step during which disrupted epithelial and endothelial cells initiate an anti-fibrinolytic cascade that produces a temporary patch on the wound. The second step is the inflammation step where circulating neutrophils, macrophages and fibrocytes infiltrate to the site of injury. The recruited inflammatory cells secrete additional profibrotic cytokines such as IL-1, TNF, IL-13, and TGF-\u03b2. Macrophages and neutrophils also remove cell debris and eliminate pathogens. This in turn is followed by the proliferation and differentiation of fibroblasts into myofibroblasts, the key cell type that coordinates wound repair. Myofibroblasts secrete new ECM components on which tissue is rebuilt (Wynn, 2011). Finally, the third step involves resolution of the wound healing process, where myofibroblasts contract to reduce the size of the wound and its population numbers decrease by undergoing apoptosis.",

Pro-inflammatory cytokines IFN-\u03b3, IL-6, TNF-\u03b1, IL-18, CXCL10, MCP1 and TGF-\u03b2 were found to be highly upregulated in serum from SARS-CoV patients (Huang et al., 2005, Wong et al., 2004). TGF-\u03b21 was also found to be upregulated in mouse models of SARS-CoV infection similar to what was observed in other respiratory virus infections (Baas et al., 2006, Rockx et al., 2009). This is significant due to the profibrotic nature of TGF-\u03b21. The release of TGF-\u03b2 from injured tissue promotes lung repair, which while normally lead to resolution of infection, in SARS-CoV infection it often leads to hyperactivation of the TGF-\u03b2 pathway leading to the promotion of lung fibrosis. In animal models of TGF-\u03b2 regulation, transgenic mice over-expressing TGF-\u03b2 show produce severe pulmonary fibrosis in mice and rats (Sime et al., 1997). The TGF-\u03b2 activation pathways leads to the production of fibrin, collagen and secreted proteases (Matrix metalloproteinases). TGF-\u03b2\u2019s role in cellular proliferation is under investigation, however there is evidence it is a key factor in the epithelial\u2013mesenchymal transition (EMT) seen in repaired tissue. TGF-\u03b2\u2019s presence in the lungs is required to promote lung fibroblasts to differentiate into myofibroblasts that are important in repairing lung tissue. However, under high and sustained levels of TGF-\u03b2, persistence of the repair process results in further damage.",

Deposition of fibrotic material is a normal component of the wound healing response, but it is unresolved wound healing that results in fibrotic disease (Adamson et al., 1988, Bitterman, 1992). The dysregulated control of either the upregulation of EGFR signaling, which is required for the initiation of normal wound healing, or downregulation of EGFR signaling, which is required for the resolution of the wound healing process, could result in fibrotic disease (Fig. 3\n).",

TGF-\u03b2 induction, a hallmark of many fibrotic diseases, drives expression of EGFR ligands which themselves lead to EGFR activation. Modulators of TGF-\u03b2 signaling, induction and activation are in development. Upstream of TGF-\u03b2 signaling, there are several FDA approved drugs (Losartan, Pirfenidone and Tranilast) that have effects at lowering TGF-\u03b2 levels in the host. Several other small molecules, antibodies and siRNAs target TGF-\u03b2 itself and are currently in clinical trials for a variety of fibrotic and cancer related diseases (Akhurst and Hata, 2012). EGFR activation induces the production of mucins (to assist in clearance of particles and debris) and IL-8 (a neutrophil recruiting chemokine) in addition to stimulating repair. Inhibitors of either overactive mucin production or antagonists of IL-8 could be useful in the modulation of a dysregulated EGFR response leading to resumption of control of host tissue repair. There are caveats for the use of tyrosine kinase inhibitors, specifically with respect to pulmonary toxicity. The use of Gefitinib has been reported to induce interstitial lung disease in patients treated for non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) (Kato and Nishio, 2006, Shi et al., 2014). TKIs are highly effective in treating EGFR positive cancers but their effect on normal tissue has not been well investigated.",

Current research focuses on wound healing pathways that mediate tissue repair after injury, specifically the EGFR pathway. Specifically, we are studying how dysregulation of the EGFR pathway could lead to the development of pulmonary fibrosis in animal models of SARS-CoV. We hypothesize that targeted inhibition of EGFR, the proteins that activate EGFR or the proteins downstream of EGFR signaling could provide novel therapeutic interventions for pulmonary fibrosis patients. In addition, we believe that infections by other highly pathogenic respiratory viruses like MERS-CoV or future emerging respiratory viruses, could induce pulmonary fibrosis in patients. Understanding how the EGFR, wound healing and other pro-fibrotic pathways act after viral infection should lead to novel therapeutics in the future.",

The phosphorylated active form aggregates several adaptor proteins leading to the activation of multiple signaling cascades. A range of different outcomes are produced by the activation of these pathways some of which are listed in the schematic above.",
