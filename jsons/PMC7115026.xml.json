These are helpful for the diagnosis, prevention, and control of the disease. There have been several advancements in the methods for diagnosing infectious diseases. The wide spectrum of tests such as biochemical evaluation, microbiological tools, immunological and molecular biology techniques, etc., is available. Each type of diagnostic technique is strong and reliable in its own sense but poses certain limitations. These limitations may be complemented by using a combination of tests. Older techniques such as microscopy and culturing of organisms from clinical specimens are error-free but are very labor intensive and extremely time consuming. There is a need to develop rapid and sensitive tests that can be used in both high- and low-resource settings. Molecular diagnostics such as Western blot, ELISA, PCR, DNA, and protein microarrays are revolutionizing the clinical practice of infectious diseases. Their effects are significant in acute-care settings where timely and accurate diagnostic tools are critical for patient treatment decisions and outcomes.",

A nitrocellulose membrane is placed on the gel, and with the help of electrical current, the proteins are transferred from the gel to the membrane where they adhere. The pattern of protein separation is maintained in the membrane after transfer. The membrane is then probed with specific antibodies (primary antibodies) to determine the presence of the protein. Often a secondary antibody conjugated to biotin or a reporter enzyme is used to enhance the signal and detect the binding of the primary antibody. This procedure is used mainly to determine the presence of an antigen in biological sample with simultaneous determination of the molecular weight of a protein and measure relative amount of a protein present in different samples (Fig. 9.1).\n",

Since ELISA detects HIVantibodies which the body starts to produce between 2 and 12 weeks after becoming infected with HIV, one should wait for at least 3 months to confirm for HIV AIDS. Western blot is the most common method of testing to confirm positive results from ELISA test. It is used more as a confirmatory test as it is difficult to perform and requires high skills. One advantage of Western blot is that it is less likely to give false-positive results as it can effectively distinguish between HIV antibodies and other antibodies.",

In the dot-ELISA, the plastic plate is replaced by a nitrocellulose or other paper membrane onto which a small amount of sample volume is applied. The principle is similar to that of immunoblotting. The dotted membrane is incubated first with an antigen-specific antibodyfollowed by an enzyme-conjugated anti-antibody (secondary antibody). The addition of a precipitable, chromogenic substrate causes the formation of a colored dot on the membrane which can be visually read. It is convenient to use, gives rapid results that are fairly easy to interpret, is fast and cost-effective, and hence can be used in the field (e.g., as a dipstick). For all these reasons, the dot-ELISA is extensively used in the detection of human and animal parasitic diseases, including amebiasis, babesiosis, fascioliasis, cutaneous and visceral leishmaniasis, cysticercosis, echinococcosis, malaria, schistosomiasis, toxocariasis, toxoplasmosis, trichinosis, and trypanosomiasis [4].",

Basically, an antigenof choice is fused to the enzyme reporter Renilla luciferase (Ruc) and expressed as a Ruc-fusion in mammalian cells to allow for mammalian-specific posttranslational modifications. The crude protein extract is then incubated with the test serum and protein A/G beads. During the incubation, the Ruc- antigenfusion becomes immobilized on the A/G beads, which allows the antigen-specific antibodyto be quantitated by washing the beads and adding coelenterazine substrate and measuring light production. Some of the advantages of the LIPS technology include its rapidity and accuracy in detecting infected patients. Sensitivity is improved in part by the use of mammalian cells which produce fusion antigensfree of contaminating bacterial proteins. In addition, low backgrounds are produced compared to the ELISA.",

The key idea was to use a line of myeloma cells that had lost their ability to secrete antibodies, fuse these cells with healthy antibody-producing B cells, and select for the successfully fused cells. In hybridoma technology, a myeloma cell rendered drug sensitive through mutation in a growth essential gene, hypoxanthine guanine phosphoribosyl transferase ( HGPRT), is chemically fused with immune cells from a host immunized with the antigenof interest, and the resulting cells are grown in medium containing the selective drug. Since the immune cells have a short life span in tissue culture and the myeloma cells are drug sensitive, the only cell that will survive are those myeloma cells which obtained a normal HGPRT gene from the immune cells. Such cells also have a high likelihood of carrying the immune cell\u2019s antibodygene resulting in the generation of a hybridoma that can grow continuously in vitro and secrete a single monoclonal antibody (Fig. 9.3).\n",

In future there are chances that by viewing the SNPs profile of an individual, the physicians might be able to find out the risks associated and plan a personalized medicine. SNPs help in determining the likelihood of a person to develop a particular disease. One of the genes associated with Alzheimer\u2019s disease in apolipoprotein E or ApoE. It contains two SNPs that result in three possible alleles for this gene: E2, E3, and E4. Each allele differs by one DNA base, and the protein product of each gene differs by one amino acid. Each individual inherits one maternal copy of ApoE and one paternal copy of ApoE. A person who inherits at least one E4 allele has a greater chance of developing Alzheimer\u2019s disease, whereas inheriting the E2 allele reduces the likelihood of developing Alzheimer\u2019s. SNPs are not absolute indicators of disease development. ApoE is just one gene that has been linked to Alzheimer\u2019s. Like most common chronic disorders such as heart disease, diabetes, or cancer, Alzheimer\u2019s is a disease that can be caused by variations in several genes.
