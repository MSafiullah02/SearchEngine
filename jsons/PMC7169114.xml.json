Gradually, studies have confirmed the functional importance of ncRNAs and that they play pivotal roles in cellular and metabolic activities,8 with small ncRNAs and lncRNAs now known to account for an estimated 20% to 42% of ncRNAs.24 Small ncRNAs, such as miRNAs, are involved in the regulation of a variety of cellular activities leading to gene silencing by base pairing with specific complementary nucleotide sequences of the mRNAs of their target genes.25 In contrast, lncRNAs greater than 200 nts in length exert their functions by a greater variety of known mechanisms through interactions with either target proteins or nucleic acids via their specific and complex secondary structures.26, 27, 28, 29, 30 These known mechanisms can be classified into seven distinct groups: (1) lncRNA binds to transcription factors to form a transcription complex, which affects downstream gene expression by inhibiting RNA polymerase II or by mediating chromatin remodeling and histone modifications31, 32, 33, 34; (2) lncRNA forms a complementary double\u2010stranded region with the mRNA transcript of its target gene, thereby interfering with the cleavage, transport, and/or translation of the targeted mRNA35; (3) lncRNA competes with a target gene for transcription factors, thereby silencing the target gene expression; (4) lncRNA acts as a scaffold to bring multiple proteins together to regulate gene transcription36; (5) lncRNA binds to a specific protein, altering the activity or cytoplasmic localization of the protein37; (6) a lncRNA gene transcribes an additional ncRNA, such as pseudogenes and circular RNAs, and because of the similarity to the mRNA sequence of the target gene, the ncRNA can operate as a molecular sponge that attracts miRNAs, thereby insulating the transcription and translation of the functional genes from miRNA effects and enabling cross talk between different ncRNA classes38; and finally (7) lncRNAs can be transcribed as the precursors of small molecule RNAs, such as miRNAs and piwi\u2010interacting RNAs (piRNAs).39 In summary, lncRNAs can regulate gene expression through DNA and RNA modifications by a variety of modes, such as by serving as signal molecules, decoy molecules, guide molecules, molecular sponges, and scaffolds.27, 40 lncRNAs participate in multiple biological processes such as cell differentiation, carcinogenesis, and immune responses and play important roles in the development and, thereby, potentially in the prevention of human diseases.28, 29, 41, 42 In the past decade, lncRNA biology has become a new frontier in life sciences and attracted many researchers to the field. In this review, we will focus on the present state of understanding of lncRNAs in the context of innate antiviral immunity.",

By means of gene chip analyses, Winterling and colleagues revealed 17 differentially expressed lncRNAs in human alveolar epithelial cells (A549) infected with influenza virus A/WSN/33 (H1N1).43 Subsequently, using high\u2010throughput sequencing, numerous research groups identified thousands of differentially expressed lncRNAs following viral infection. In order to systematically study the regulatory effects of the neurotropic enterovirus A71 (EVA71) infection on lncRNAs, Yin et al performed a comprehensive analysis of EVA71\u2010infected rhabdomyosarcoma (RD) cells and observed differential expression of greater than 4800 lncRNAs.44 Similarly, Meng et al identified 8541 differentially expressed lncRNAs in EVA71\u2010infected human peripheral blood mononuclear cells.45 Also, using the RNA sequencing (RNA\u2010Seq) technique, Shi et al identified a total of 760 and 1210 lncRNAs that were upregulated and downregulated, respectively, in RD cells infected with Coxsackievirus A16 (CVA16). Interestingly, there was an apparent bias in the lncRNA class differentially regulated upon CVA16 infection as approximately 43.6% and 22.3% were intergenic and sense lncRNAs, respectively, demonstrating a significant enrichment upon viral infection of the former lncRNA class.46 Peng and colleagues have analyzed the lung transcriptome in severe acute respiratory syndrome\u2010associated coronavirus (SARS\u2010CoV)\u2010infected mice and reported that the expression of 504 annotated and 1406 unannotated lncRNAs had significant changes.47 In addition, other viral families, such as Zika virus,48 hepatitis B virus (HBV),49, 50, 51 and hepatitis C virus,52 have been shown upon host infection to lead to differential expression of host lncRNAs compared with uninfected controls. Therefore, the differential expression of lncRNAs in various cell types following viral infection appears to be a widespread phenomenon and not a property attributable to one viral family or host target cell.",

Virus infection can also activate retinoic acid\u2010inducible gene\u2010I (RIG\u2010I), Toll\u2010like receptors (TLRs), melanoma differentiation\u2010associated gene 5 (MDA5), and Nod\u2010like receptor (NLR) pathways,70 which in turn activate interferon regulatory factors, such as IRF3, IRF7, and the major proinflammatory transcription factor NF\u2010\u03baB.71, 72 The lncRNAs Lethe and lnc\u2010Lsm3b have been shown to bind directly to immunosensors and block downstream signaling of the innate immune pathway (Table 1). The lncRNA Lethe competitively binds with and blocks NF\u2010\u03baB from binding to specific promoter regions of its target genes, thereby preventing a cascade of signal transduction events.63 The IFN\u2010inducible, host\u2010derived lncRNA, lnc\u2010Lsm3b, directly competes with vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) RNA for the binding to the RIG\u2010I monomer, limiting the conformational transition of the RIG\u2010I PRR. Feedback in the later stages of the innate immune response inactivates RIG\u2010I (Figure 2A),73 thereby inhibiting the development of virus infection or activating type I interferon\u2010mediated immune cells, such as dendritic, NK, and T cells, either directly or indirectly eliminating viral infections.87 In addition, lnc\u2010Lsm3b interferes with the interaction between caspase activation and recruitment domain (CARD) proteins, present in numerous innate immune effectors and the mitochondrial antiviral signaling (MAVS) protein by stabilizing the interaction between the N\u2010terminal CARD of RIG\u2010I and the helicase domain. It has been demonstrated that TRIM25\u2010mediated ubiquitination of RIG\u2010I K63 is also inhibited by lnc\u2010Lsm3b upon RNA virus stimulation.
