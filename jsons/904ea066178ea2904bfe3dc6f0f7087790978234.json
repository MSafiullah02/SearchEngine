Children presenting outside of office hours and on weekends were cared for at the Emergency Department (ED) of our hospital. A complete medical history was obtained using a unified case report form, and a physical examination was performed, followed by either an oropharyngeal swab or a nasal wash, depending on the child's age and ability to cooperate. Test results were usually available within 24 h. Additional laboratory and imaging tests were performed at the discretion of the supervising paediatrician. Appropriate medical management was determined based on clinical findings and local and (inter)national protocols. Treatment with the antiviral drug oseltamivir was initiated in suspected influenza cases in accordance with national guidelines at that time (http://www.rivm. nl/en): oseltamivir was prescribed only in high-risk patients, i.e. children <2 years of age or suffering from a specified chronic medical condition and in patients with a complicated course of infection. If the clinical suspicion of H1N1-infection was confirmed by a positive test result, patients were advised to finish the 5-day treatment with the antiviral drug; in the case of a negative test result, the use of oseltamivir was discontinued.",

More antibiotics were initially prescribed and administered in H1N1-positive children than in H1N1-negatives (42% and 18%, respectively). Fourteen blood samples that had been collected for bacterial cultures did not result in the detection of any bacterial pathogens.",

An extensive range of different pathogens had been detected in 65% of the tested samples. Infection with pandemic influenza A(H1N1) virus was diagnosed in 132 paediatric outpatients (32%). The majority of infected children showed a mild clinical picture. H1N1 infected children reported fever, cough and rhinorrhoea more frequently than those who were uninfected. Despite this finding, we have continued to advocate the use of specific virologic diagnostics instead of clinical differentiation. In a recently published study that was performed among adults with symptoms of respiratory infection, it was concluded that clinical differentiation between patients with and without influenza infection based solely on influenza-like signs and symptoms is rather ineffective (10) . It is very plausible that this also holds true for a paediatric population. Furthermore, our results have shown that H1N1-positive children, both in-and outpatients, were significantly older than their H1N1-negative counterparts. The lower age of H1N1-negative children is probably best explained by a selection bias of relatively healthy infants and young children brought to the hospital by parents who were concerned by the pandemic. Finally, from our results, it seems that certain pre-existing comorbid conditions in children, particularly asthmatic bronchitis, had not been a risk factor for a more complicated course of the infection, unlike findings from other observational studies (6, 11, 12) .",

The Health Council of the Netherlands had advised the vaccination of children from 'traditional' medical risk groups in that same month (13) . In the course of the next month, the relative H1N1-positivity rate declined; however, the absolute number of visiting patients increased dramatically. In November 2009, the Health Council advice was changed, and it was recommended that all children from the ages of 6 months to 4 years be vaccinated, regardless of risk group. A mass vaccination program was therefore organized in November and December, after which a definite decline in the number of visiting patients was seen. In Amsterdam and surrounding area, this had resulted in a total vaccination coverage rate in children of approximately 40% (14) . Based on this coverage rate, and taking into account that mass vaccination was started after the peak of the epidemic, it is estimated that maximally 10-20% of our outpatient children had received the vaccine.",

The differences can for most part be explained by the fact that our study period, and not Monto's, was encompassed by a true influenza pandemic. Furthermore, advanced diagnostic techniques that are used currently, such as RT-PCR, were not available during that time period. Our population did not show any influenza A(H1N1)-RSV co-infections, which is opposite to the findings from Poehling et al. (18) . We also found that the consecutive outbreaks of rhinovirus, influenza and RSV one after the other followed its usual pattern (19, 20) .

Finally, two different sampling methods had been used. Oropharyngeal swabs were performed in the majority of our children; in a minority nasal washes were performed. Comparative studies have shown that the sensitivity for the identification of respiratory viruses is lower for oropharyngeal swabs (28) (29) (30) .
