Methods: We examined 139 serum specimens collected from 112 patients with COVID-19 and 48 serum specimens collected from 48 non-COVID-19 patients. The presence of IgM/IgG antibody for SARS-COV2 was determined using the One Step Novel Coronavirus (COVID-19) IgM/IgG Antibody Test. Chest CT was performed in COVID-19 patients on admission. Findings: Of the139 COVID-19 serum specimens, IgM was detected in 27.8 %, 48.0 %, and 95.8 % of the specimens collected within 1 week, 1-2 weeks, and > 2 weeks after symptom onset and IgG was detected in 3.3 %, 8.0 %, and 62.5 %, respectively. Among the 48 non-COVID-19 serum specimens, 1 generated a false-positive result for IgM. Thirty-eight of the 112 COVID-19 patients were asymptomatic, of whom 15 were positive for IgM, and 74 were symptomatic, of whom 22 were positive for IgM and 7 were positive for IgG. The diagnostic sensitivity of CT scan alone and in combination with the IC assay was 57.9 % (22/38) and 68.4 % (26/38) for the asymptomatic patients and 74.3 % (55/74) and 82.4 % (61/74) for the symptomatic patients, respectively.",

            "text": "The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV2) epidemic, which causes the novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID- 19) , was first reported in December 2019 in Wuhan, China [1] , and it has since been declared a pandemic by the World Health Organization. The ongoing outbreak is a global threat to human health. Quantitative reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) analysis for SARS-CoV2 is considered the gold standard for diagnosing COVID-19. RT-qPCR has been used to analyze specimens from the upper and lower respiratory tracts for clinical diagnosis during outbreaks of other diseases, but it has not been performed widely in the clinical setting because it requires special equipment, a time-consuming protocol, and highly skilled laboratory technicians. In addition, because RT-qPCR requires samples from the upper and lower respiratory tracts, the process of collecting samples and extracting RNA increases the risk of exposure to viral droplets. Therefore, an alternative diagnostic test to RT-qPCR is desirable for the clinical management of COVID- 19. In studies conducted in China, chest computed tomography (CT) scans were widely utilized as a diagnostic tool for COVID-19 [2] [3] [4] . Lung involvement can be detected in patients with COVID-19 on a CT scan in advance of the symptoms typical for pneumonia [5] and a positive result on RT-qPCR [6, 7] . The common radiological characteristics of COVID-19 pneumonia on chest CT have a diagnostic sensitivity of 73 https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jcv.2020.104393 Received 24 April 2020; Accepted 27 April 2020 %-93 % and a specificity of 24 %-100 % in distinguishing COVID-19 from other forms of viral pneumonia [2, 8] . An immunochromatographic (IC) assay for IgM and IgG antibodies against the virus is widely accepted as a point-of-care test because it is an easy-to-perform, rapid, and high-throughput method for diagnosing viral infections. Recently, several commercial IC assays that detect IgM/IgG antibodies against SARS-CoV2 have become available for use in the clinical setting. However, their clinical usefulness has yet to be thoroughly evaluated. Here, we describe the clinical performance of an IC assay in comparison with that of chest CT.",

The detection of IgM and IgG antibodies increased rapidly from day 15 after onset (IgM = 94.3 % and IgG = 79.8 %) [10] . Our IC assay results support these previous findings that seroconversion mainly occurred > 2 weeks after onset [10] . The clinical usefulness of serological tests for COVID-19 remains controversial due to the time lag between the onset of symptoms and the appearance of IgM and IgG antibodies in serum. In China and the United States, the sensitivity and specificity of serological tests for samples initially collected from hospitalized patients were 38.3 %-85.4 % and 100 % [10] [11] [12] for ELISA and 18.4 %-88.7 % and 90.6 %-91.7 % for IC assay [13, 14] , respectively. This contradiction probably reflects differences in the timing of sampling because the clinical setting varies in each country. In the clinical setting, patients are usually diagnosed with COVID-19 within 2 weeks because they develop dyspnea and pneumonia at a median of 8 days (IQR, 5.0-13.0 days) after symptom onset [1] . In this study, the median time from onset to hospitalization was 5 days (IQR, 2-7 days), which is shorter than in previous studies (median 7-15 days) [10] [11] [12] [13] [14] . Additionally, only 29.7 % of patients were diagnosed using IC assay alone, supporting the Cassaniti et al.'s conclusion that the sensitivity of IC assays remains insufficient for their use as a clinical diagnostic tool [14] . Therefore, unfortunately, the IC assay alone cannot replace RT-qPCR as an acute diagnostic protocol for COVID-19, at least in the clinical setting in Japan. However, the IC assay can be used for epidemiological studies of the seroprevalence of IgM and IgG antibodies against SARS-CoV2.",

The clinical performance of CT may vary according to differences in patient populations, disease severity, and accessibility to chest CT scans in each country. In the present study, chest CT showed higher sensitivity than the IC assay, but sensitivity was only 73.3 % among the symptomatic patients who tested positive for SARS-CoV2 according to RT-qPCR. Bernheim et al. reported that the sensitivity of chest CT was low (44 %) in the acute phase (0-2 days after onset) but high (91 %) in the intermediate phase (3-5 days) [16] . The low sensitivity of chest CT may reflect the short period of time between symptom onset to hospitalization in the symptomatic patients examined in this study. The diagnostic sensitivity was improved by combining the IC assay and chest CT (81.3 %). In the present study, we did not evaluate the specificity of chest CT, but taking the high specificity of the IC assay into consideration, combining the IC assay and chest CT was considered to improve the diagnostic specificity as well.
