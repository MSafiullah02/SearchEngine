The question of whether it was wise to construct a virus that was historically associated with the worst pandemic in modern history and somewhat different from any virus currently circulating was raised, but the debate seems to have been internal to the US Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), particularly the National Institutes of Health (NIH), and it was judged that the work should proceed [14].",

Then, at a conference in Malta in September 2011, Prof. Ron Fouchier presented data from experiments in which his laboratory had modified a human isolate of H5N1 avian-origin influenza to acquire some mutations expected to adapt it to human-to-human transmission and then introduced the resulting virus into ferrets. Through serial passage in ferrets they had obtained a virus capable of small-droplet transmission from one infected ferret to another [3, 8]. Given the close resemblance of ferrets to humans in many aspects of influenza biology and pathology, this was seen by many (though not all [18]) as a proxy for human-to-human small-droplet transmission. Soon after, the laboratory of Prof. Yoshihiro Kawaoka reported a related set of experiments, this time using a virus created by reverse genetics from a human H1N1 virus and the hemagglutinin gene of a zoonotic H5N1 isolate [9]. A major controversy erupted over whether these experiments should be published. The controversy focused on the biosecurity issue of whether knowledge of the mutations required to render H5N1 influenza transmissible in ferrets (and possibly humans) would abet potential bioterrorists by providing them a \u201crecipe\u201d for a potential pandemic pathogen [19]. Despite strong objections from some, the US government, which had funded both sets of studies, recommended that they be published in full, as they soon were [8, 9]. Following this outcry, influenza virologists briefly announced [20, 21], then lifted [22, 23], a self-imposed moratorium on such experiments.",

These early critiques also questioned whether the scientific and public health value of such research justified the risks involved. Klotz and Sylvester coined the term \u201cpotential pandemic pathogen (PPP)\u201d for such viruses [25]. The first major discussion meeting on this topic, to my knowledge, was held at the Royal Society of London in 2012 (https://royalsociety.org/science-events-and-lectures/2012/viruses/), with mainly UK and North American speakers.",

A meeting that I co-organized with colleagues in July 2014 led to the creation of the Cambridge Working Group, which issued a statement calling for such work to be \u201ccurtailed\u201d pending a formal risk-benefit assessment (http://www.cambridgeworkinggroup.org/). In response, a countervailing group called Scientists for Science (http://www.scientistsforscience.org/) formed in opposition to this call. Each group garnered the support of prominent scientists and others. In October 2014, citing the laboratory mishaps and the exceptional hazard that release of a potential pandemic pathogen might cause, the US White House Office of Science and Technology Policy (OSTP) and the National Institutes of Health announced a \u201cpause\u201d in federal funding of certain categories of research and a deliberative process that would culminate in a formal risk-benefit assessment, spearheaded by the National Science Advisory Board on Biosecurity (NSABB) (https://obamawhitehouse.archives.gov/blog/2014/10/17/doing-diligence-assess-risks-and-benefits-life-sciences-gain-function-research). This pause initially affected about two dozen existing grants from the NIH concerning influenza and coronaviruses [27], but it was soon narrowed to cover only about half that number (http://www.sciencemag.org/news/2014/12/moratorium-risky-experiments-lifted-mers-mouse-studies), out of an NIH portfolio of about 250 active research grants at the time on these two groups of viruses.",

Many scientists, a few ethicists, and others debated the scientific and public health rationale for PPP experiments, the risks they posed, and the ethics of doing research that poses potentially major risks to persons not involved in the studies and even unaware of them. This process raised awareness of many issues that had not been previously highlighted, notably the lack of a framework for evaluating risks of research to persons who are not research participants [30, 31], the very poor availability of data on biosafety in biological laboratories in the United States and elsewhere [32], and the consequent uncertainty in risk-benefit calculations.",

Throughout a career in experimental biology, one makes choices about which experiments to perform\u2014and which not to perform\u2014on many different time scales. The choice of which field of biology to enter may have consequences for decades or an entire career. The choice of what project to select (from among those available in graduate school) or apply for grant support for (often at later stages of a career) will have consequences for many years; and the choices of which experimental approaches to take may govern one\u2019s activities for an afternoon, a week, or several months or years depending on the complexity of the experiments. Over long time horizons, we make these decisions based on a combination of scientific curiosity, the potential for novelty, the importance of the problem for advancing science or achieving a practical (e.g., public health) goal, and more mundane but essential constraints such as the availability of technology, reagents, facilities, funding, mentors, and collaborators, to name a few. On the shorter time scale of hours, days, and months, the choice of detailed experimental approach is motivated by questions about which approach is:Most likely to provide interpretable data to answer the question, unaffected by uncontrolled variationMost likely to provide an answer fastLikely to be least expensive (or fit within a budget constraint)Most elegant scientifically\n",

As I will argue below, that category of research is a very limited category\u2014roughly covered by the terms PPP creation or GoFRoC. The accident risk posed by performing an activity for a particular period of time is conventionally defined as the product of two factors: the probability that an accident will occur during that period, times the expected magnitude of harm that the accident causes. For the vast majority of pathogens studied in the laboratory, accidental infection of a laboratory worker or other person poses little risk to the broader population. This is because most pathogens we study have one or more of the following properties that limit the impact of an accidental infection:The pathogen is not transmissible from person to person (e.g., anthrax) or is somewhat transmissible but would be readily contained in a developed-world setting (e.g., filoviruses).The pathogen is already widespread (and possibly usually carried asymptomatically), such that adding one more infected person to the pool of infected persons would have a negligible impact on the overall risk of transmission (e.g., the bacterial species that constitute the normal flora of the gut and respiratory tract).Transmission of the pathogen is limited by widespread vaccine coverage (e.g., measles virus, Bordetella pertussis, and other targets of routine vaccination).Transmission of the pathogen is locally limited by lack of a suitable vector (e.g., flaviviruses in sufficiently cool climates).\n",

            "text": "There has been much debate about the exact magnitude of risk from GoFRoC experiments. Rehearsing those arguments is not the purpose of this chapter. A few points, however, are important:A published estimate by the author of this chapter [34] using the experience of laboratory-acquired infections in BSL3 laboratories in the United States suggested that a single year of work in a single laboratory on a novel influenza virus readily transmissible between humans carries between a 1/1000 and a 1/10,000 chance of accidentally sparking a pandemic by accidental release. A reply by Prof. Ron Fouchier [2] placed the probability more than one million times lower. This is not the place to rehash the arguments over these probabilities. The essential point is that either estimate is a small probability; both are dependent on assumptions because data are limited; but when multiplied by the potential magnitude of a pandemic, the higher estimate (or even an estimate between the two) suggests a clearly unacceptable risk. While we believe that our estimate is if anything too low rather than too high, it is notable that the expected risk (probability of an accident leading to a pandemic times expected fatalities in such a pandemic) would be unacceptable to most people even if it were 1000-fold lower than we have estimated [34].While excellent biosafety conditions in the laboratories performing GoFRoC are certainly important, it is not a panacea for guaranteeing safety. Of the major mishaps at US government labs in recent years, nearly all involved removing the infectious agent from the high-containment lab where it was under study to another, lower-containment lab because it was thought to be inert [35\u201337] (https://www.defense.gov/News/Special-Reports/DoD-Laboratory-Review/). High-tech containment cannot prevent the deliberate removal of supposedly safe material from a laboratory, and so human error remains a source of potential missteps, regardless of the quality of the laboratory facilities. Among other consequences, this consideration means that measures to protect personnel in laboratories conducting GoFRoC, such as vaccination, prophylaxis with antiviral drugs, and enhanced surveillance for illness, cannot address the problem of exposure outside the \u201chome\u201d laboratory [38].\n",

In the vast majority of cases, the consequences, while potentially devastating for one or a few exposed persons, will be limited in scope. The unique risk posed by GoFRoC or PPP creation is that such accidents will lead not only to individual infections but to ongoing transmission and, in the worst case, extensive global spread of the engineered pathogen. Such risks are different in kind from ordinary biosafety risks and should not be seen as simply an issue to be addressed after deciding whether to do the experiment. Rather, the existence of such risks should be counted, like great expense in time or money, as an important factor arguing against undertaking the experiment in the first place. The unique benefits of doing GoFRoC should justify the unique risks such experiments create, and both comparisons should be made against devoting the same resources to alternative approaches that do not raise population-level biosafety concerns .",

But improving our ability to prevent and/or respond to novel influenza pandemics is the major public health goal that lends practical importance to advancing our scientific knowledge of the determinants of transmissibility in particular. Most importantly, effective targeting of efforts to prevent or mitigate pandemic threats partly depends on developing accurate predictive capabilities to estimate the magnitude of the threat posed by particular influenza A strains that we are observing in nonhuman reservoirs [40, 45]. Knowing that strains isolated from wild or domesticated avian or domesticated swine populations have genetic sequences or phenotypic traits (e.g., receptor binding specificity) predictive of the ability to transmit effectively in humans can motivate targeted countermeasures against such strains, such as culling of infected animals or strain-specific vaccine development. These two activities in particular depend on prioritizing which strains are most threatening, because it is impractical to cull all influenza-infected animals, and it is currently impractical to make vaccines except in a strain-specific fashion. Such strain-dependent prevention and mitigation activities are part of an overall pandemic preparedness portfolio including strengthening human respiratory disease surveillance and analytic capacity, stockpiling of non-strain-specific countermeasures such as antiviral drugs, personal protective equipment and ventilators, and a range of other public health measures whose usefulness is relatively independent of the strain of influenza that causes zoonotic cases or initiates a pandemic. But for animal culling and vaccine development (absent universal vaccines), prioritizing pandemic threats based on sequence and viral traits is important [40, 45, 46].",

Comparison of naturally occurring influenza viruses, either by genetic sequence or by phenotypic traits or both, can help to categorize those sequences and traits that are characteristics of strains that are avian-adapted and poorly able to transmit in humans, compared to those that are well-adapted to human transmission. Such comparisons have been made for decades, and a number of traits and genetic sequence features (such as specific variants at specific amino acid sites in specific viral proteins) have been associated with human adaptation. Among the most important traits correlated with human adaptation are HA specificity for sialic acids found in the human upper airway (alpha-2,6 linked), a relatively low pH of HA activation, and human adaptation of the nucleoprotein-polymerase complex [40].",

The limitations of predicting pandemic potential were evident in 2009, when the strain that emerged and began spreading in humans arguably failed to meet the existing notions of human adaptation on all three key human-adaptive traits as understood at the time: early pandemic isolates\u2019 HA receptor specificity was mixed human and avian; their HA pH of activation was outside the range of human-adapted viruses known before; and they lacked the sequence variant (lysine at PB2 amino acid 627) that had been thought necessary in the past for human adaptation. While subsequent evolution \u201ccorrected\u201d the first two of these limitations on human-to-human transmission, the criteria had to be updated to accommodate the fact that what seemed necessary for pandemic potential in 2008 was violated by the early pandemic strain in 2009 [40]. While this limitation is surely a rationale for continuing to expand our scientific knowledge in this area, it more fundamentally points out that with only four modern pandemics to test our models of what is needed for a pandemic strain, no amount of further research will be able to make a highly reliable predictive model for pandemic potential\u2014we simply lack the data (actual pandemics) to validate such models and therefore can never rely fully on these models, no matter how many more experimental inputs we add. This consideration heightens the importance of other approaches to pandemic preparedness, which are not dependent on correct predictions of the strain that will cause a pandemic, in combination with efforts to improve our predictive power.

The consequences of such an accident should be enough to direct the attention of ambitious and public health-minded virologists toward these safe alternatives.",
