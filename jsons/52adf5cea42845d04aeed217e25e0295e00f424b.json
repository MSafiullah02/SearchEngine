            "text": "By the end of December 2019, a new coronavirus, SARS-CoV-2, was identified as the cause of a disease outbreak that originated in the city of Wuhan, China. The disease it causes was called coronavirus disease 2019 . The infection spread rapidly, and the World Health Organization, on March 11, characterized COVID-19 as a pandemic. On April 11, 2020, more than 1.6 million cases had been diagnosed in 179 countries in five continents with nearly 100.000 confirmed deaths (1) . Since the start of the outbreak, as the weeks pass by, unexpected side effects that directly affect medical attention to other pathologies are being witnessed. In this issue of JACC: Case reports, Moroni et al (2) report 3 cases of ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) that were attended in the midst of the COVID-19 pandemic in the Lombardy region of Italy, which at that time had the highest incidence of cases worldwide. In all 3 cases, despite presenting clear symptoms and having a hospital nearby, patients decided not to go to the emergency room due to fear of acquiring the virus in the hospital, which was overwhelmed COVID-19 patients. After a few days they ended up going to the hospital after suffering serious complications related to STEMI, which caused serious sequelae or even death. Risk perception is irrational, and fear of infection opens a new scenario in which patients with serious pathologies avoid going to hospitals, despite the fact that the risk of untreated STEMI exceeds by far the risk of COVID-19 itself.",

In both cases STEMI care networks were working normally, so potential etiologies for this decrease should be a combination of avoidance of medical care due to social distancing, concerns of contracting COVID-19 in the hospital, STEMI misdiagnosis or increased use of pharmacological reperfusion.",

Conversely, in Spain, the Interventional Cardiology Association recommended primary angioplasty as first choice treatment, considering thrombolysis only in the case that the patient was in a center without primary angioplasty capability and required a transfer that would delay treatment for more than 120 minutes or in patients who have tested positive to COVID-19 with poor clinical state that makes transfer difficult or in patients who have tested positive to COVID-19 with low hemorrhagic risk and symptoms of less than 3 hour-duration (7) . Primary angioplasty also allows early discharge without further invasive examinations in a significant percentage of patients which simplifies the management of these patients, limits patient's exposition to the hospital environment and reduces hospital occupation.",

Furthermore, very controversially, it has been suggested not to start chest compressions or ventilation in patients who are in cardiac arrest if they have suspected or diagnosed COVID-19 unless they are in the emergency department and staff are wearing full personal protective equipment (13) .",
