We review available data on commonly used immunosuppressants and their effect on viral infections beyond COVID-19. Notably, the effect of some immunosuppressants on viruses related to SARS-CoV2, including SARS and MERS, has been previously investigated. In the absence of data on the effect of immunosuppressants on COVID-19, these data could be used to make clinical decisions on initiation and continuation of immunosuppressive medications during this pandemic. In summary, we recommend considering the discontinuation of oral JAK inhibitors and prednisone, considering the delay of rituximab infusion, and the careful continuation of cyclosporine, mycophenolate, azathioprine, methotrexate, and biologics in patients currently benefitting from such treatments.

The first cases of respiratory infections of unknown origin emerged in Hubei province (Wuhan, China) in December 2019. The WHO officially announced on February 11, 2020 that the outbreak is caused by the novel enveloped RNA betacoronavirus that has been named severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) while its associated disease has been named coronavirus disease 2019 (Covid-19) 1 . SARS-CoV-2 shares phylogenetic similarities with other coronaviruses, including the one responsible for the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) 2 . COVID-19 has quickly turned into a global pandemic, unprecedented in the modern world. As immunosuppressive drugs are prescribed to a greater number of patients, concern exists for increased morbidity and mortality in patients infected with COVID-19 treated with these medications. Here we review evidence evaluating commonly used immunosuppressants medication in dermatology with regards to viral infections.",

Similar results were seen with non-immunosuppressive CsA derivatives, such as Alispovir 15 , and medications targeting FK506 16(p50) . More data are needed to evaluate the magnitude of increased risk for viral infections, specifically COVID-19, in patients taking CsA. Similarly, more data are needed to evaluate if a possible therapeutic role exists for CsA in patients with COVID-19. Based on limited data, for patients who are not infected with COVID-19 and who have stable control of their dermatologic disease, we suggest not to preemptively discontinue or decrease CsA. Patients on CsA should immediately report any flu or cold-like symptoms to their physicians. For patients with a high degree of suspicion or diagnosed with active COVID-19 infection, we recommend temporary cessation of CsA. Additionally, we recommend care when initiating CsA at this time unless there are no other alternatives; taking into account the risk, benefits, and temporary delay of initiation with patients in non-epidemic and epidemic COVID-19 areas.",

Selective JAK-inhibitors (JAKi), including ruxolitinib and tofacitinib, are now being used in dermatology. A protective role for IFN-1 against coronaviruses, including SARS-CoV, has been previously elucidated in vitro 50 and in vitro 51 . Of particular concern, STAT-1 deficient mice are more susceptible and develop more severe and disseminated infection when exposed to SARS-CoV as compared to wild type mice 52, 53 . A possible role of IFN in the treatment of SARS has been previously suggested 54 . The potent immunosuppressive effects of tofacitinib were also shown by the almost double rate of herpes zoster among RA patients treated with tofacitinib as compared to those treated with biologics 55 .",

With the COVID-19 pandemic, many patients and providers are understandably concerned about the immunomodulatory effects associated with injectable biologics 57 . In Table 1 , we compare the overall upper respiratory tract infection on published data from pivotal trials in FDA package inserts. While it is challenging to infer clinical decision making from this data in regards to COVID-19, it may be used to decide whether or not to continue injectable biologics during this pandemic. As shown in Table 1 , biologic injectables seem to carry minimal increased risk of infection. Additionally, it is important to consider that discontinuation of some biologics may result in loss of efficacy and formation of autoantibodies [58] [59] [60] . Thus, for patients who are not infected with COVID-19 and who have stable control of their dermatologic disease, we suggest not to preemptively discontinue or decrease biologic injectables. Patients on biologics should immediately report any fever, flu, or cold-like symptoms to their physicians and for patients with a high degree of suspicion or diagnosed with active COVID-19 infection, we recommend temporary cessation of their biologic injectables. Additionally, we recommend careful initiation of biologic injectables at this time unless there are no other alternatives taking into account and after careful discussion of risk, benefits, and temporary delay of initiation with patients in nonepidemic COVID-19 areas.",

Given that MMF suppresses the adaptive immune response, important in fighting viral infections, MMF could potentially increase the risk of viral infections; however, MMF inhibits viral genome replication and gene transcription of Influenza A and B 20 . Similarly, MMF used in synergy with 6-mercaptopurine (6MP) and 6-thioguanine (6TG) can inhibit MERS-CoV PL(pro), the papain-like protease (PL(pro)) of MERS-CoV 21 . More data are needed to evaluate the magnitude of increased risk for viral infections, specifically COVID-19, in patients taking MMF. Based on limited data, for patients who are not infected with COVID-19 and who have stable control of their dermatologic disease, we suggest not to preemptively discontinue or decrease MMF. Patients on MMF should immediately report any fever, flu, or cold-like symptoms to their physicians and for patients with a high degree of suspicion or diagnosed with active COVID-19 infections, we recommend J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f temporary cessation of MMF.

Rituximab can cause B-cell depletion via: 1) Fc receptor gamma-mediated antibody-dependent cytotoxicity and phagocytosis; 2) complement-mediated cell lysis; 3) growth arrest, 4) B-cell apoptosis40 . Additionally, rituximab may also result indirectly in substantial but reversible depletion of CD4 + T cells41 . Rituximab is avoided in patients with chronic hepatitis -B, HIV. Based on international guidelines, and experience with increasing risks of other types of infections, use of rituximab is being cautioned in the setting of this pandemic, as it may increase the risk of worsening consequences of SARS-CoV-2 infection. For example, according to the Multiple Sclerosis International Federation, patients currently receiving treatment with rituximab should take all measures possible to isolate to reduce their risk of infection (msif.org, last accessed March 18, 2020). Currently, given the novelty of COVID-19, there is no study specifically examining the effect of rituximab on the risk of developing infection with COVID-19 in any cohort of patients. In addition, there is no study to our knowledge looking at the risk of acquiring other types of coronavirus that have emerged previously (SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV, etc). Based on limited data, for patients who are not infected with COVID-19 and who have stable control of their dermatologic disease, we suggest not to preemptively discontinue or decrease rituximab. Given that rituximab can decrease the number of B-cells for over 6 months 42 , physicians and patients should discuss the possibility of delaying rituximab injections based on individual cases. Patients on rituximab should immediately report any fever, flu, or cold-like symptoms to their physicians and for patients with a high degree of suspicion or diagnosed with active COVID-19 infections, we recommend temporary cessation of their rituximab. Additionally, we recommend against the initiation of rituximab in COVID-19 epidemic and nonepidemic areas. Methotrexate Methotrexate (MTX) is a dihydrofolate reductase inhibitor that inhibits DNA synthesis, resulting in anti-proliferative and anti-inflammatory effects 3 . Serious side effects of MTX have mostly been reported in the rheumatology literature: bone marrow suppression, liver fibrosis, pulmonary fibrosis, and increased risk of infections. The lower dermatological dose of MTX (5-15mg/week) is also thought to carry an increased risk and severity of infection, especially compared to biologics 43 . Although duration of MTX immunosuppression after its last dose is unclear, RA patients showed improved immunogenicity of influenza vaccination 2-weeks after MTX cessation 44 . Regarding viral infections, MTX is known to increase incidence of herpes zoster in RA patients 45 . Additionally, reactivation of hepatitis B upon withdrawal of low-dose MTX in RA patients has also been reported, leading to the screening practice for viral hepatitis J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f prior to initiation of MTX 46 . Despite evidence of increased infection risk, there is no evidence about the impact of continuing or withholding MTX during an infection on outcomes.Intriguingly, in vivo studies demonstrated MTX inhibits replication of RNA viruses such as Dengue virus and Zika via inhibition of purines and pyrimidines synthesis47,48 . There is no data on possible effects of MTX on COVID-19. Based on limited data, for patients who are not infected with COVID-19 and who have stable control of their dermatologic disease, we suggest not to preemptively discontinue or decrease MTX. Patients on MTX should immediately report any fever, flu, or cold-like symptoms to their physicians and for patients with a high degree of suspicion or diagnosed with active COVID-19 infections, we recommend temporary cessation of their MTX.
