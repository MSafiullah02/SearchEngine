Early patients presented with symptoms of severe pneumonia, including fever, dry cough, and respiratory distress. Due to the high transmission rate characterising the virus, it has gone on to pose a control challenge for healthcare systems around the world [2]. Although infection rates in China are said to have been controlled by way of stringent public-health measures, several European countries have seen exponential increases in numbers of infected and deceased COVID-19 patients recently. It is thus crucial for other countries to prepare their responses to the pandemic, in circumstances in which effectiveness is seen to depend crucially on rapidly-introduced prevention and control measures, including early detection, diagnosis, treatment, and quarantine, as well as a reduction in secondary infections among healthcare professionals [3].",

Some authors thus underline that, as PCR tests have become the only diagnostic criteria for SARS-CoV-2 infection, imaging should not be a primary means of diagnosis [5], unless the patient is in a critical condition or PCR tests are unavailable. In line with this view, the primary role of both X-ray and computed tomography (CT) imaging studies is to assist in establishing how to manage the patient, the assessment of complications, and differential diagnosis [5]. Other authors [6,7] point out that the sensitivity of PCR tests remains low, in contrast to chest CT, which may be helpful in rectifying false negatives obtained from RT-PCR during the disease\u2019s early stages of development.",

The benefits and risks of the examination should therefore be considered before a CT scan is ordered [8].In selected cases (e.g. where the waiting time for an RT-PCR test is long, a false negative RT-PCR is suspected, or clinical symptoms suggest COVID-19), a clinician may, along with a radiologist, consider a CT scan \u2013 if this will impact upon patient management [8]. While non-specific, a CT image may assist with initial diagnosis of COVID-19 [8], even if final diagnosis requires RT-PCR confirmation [16,18].In both stable and unstable disease (Modified Early Warning Score \u2013 MEWS < 3 points or 3-4 points, respectively), CT is highly sensitive at detecting interstitial changes and consolidations, as well as assessing their dynamics [8,18,19]. Moreover, along with acid-base balance, it is of predictive value [19,20].CXR performed with a portable X-ray machine remains the method of choice in patients in a critical condition, with ARDS, or failure of other organs (MEWS > 4 points) [16,17]. In selected cases where CT is required, the patient should be connected to a mobile ventilator to minimise the risk of infection for CT staff [16].Chest CT is also indicated in patients with suspected complications, such as empyema or lung abscess, as well as in patients with suspected co-existing conditions like pulmonary embolism.",
