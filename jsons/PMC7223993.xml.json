            "text": "Electrical impedance tomography (EIT) is a noninvasive, bedside, radiation-free monitoring technique, which is gaining increased diffusion in the intensive care units, since it provides useful information regarding respiratory function of the ventilated patient (e.g. distribution of ventilation, modifications of end-expiratory lung volumes while changing ventilator settings) [1]. EIT waveform variations are mainly due to the movement of gas in and out of the lungs; however, since the recording belt is positioned at the mid-thorax level, impedance changes of one-order-magnitude smaller than the ventilation signal due to the movement of blood within the thorax are also recorded, commonly defined as cardiac related impedance changes [2]. Therefore, cardiac related impedance changes must be removed to study the EIT ventilation signal; a common method to achieve this goal is the application of a low-pass filter with a frequency set between the respiratory rate and the heart rate, which are usually well distinct [3]. The application of such a filter generates some modifications of the raw signal, introducing attenuations and possibly modifying clinically relevant data.",

Event-triggered averaging consists in the point by point averaging of waveforms, synchronized on a common trigger event; this approach has already been used for airflow waveforms averaging in the literature [4, 5]. Since heart and respiratory rates are out of phase, the waveform resulting after event-triggered (event being the beginning of inspiration) averaging should return the ventilation waveform. We hypothesized that average waveform characteristics after the application of a low-pass filter (i.e. amplitude, minimum and maximum values, minimum to maximum time) differ from the characteristics of the event-triggered averaged waveform and that the latter could return values closer to the waveforms recorded from the ventilator.",

            "text": "Removal of cardiac related impedance changes is required to analyze EIT waveforms, particularly when extracting data from ROIs. The classical method is the application of a low-pass filter, to preserve the respiratory signal and remove pulse noise. Application of a filter necessarily introduces distortions of the waveforms, possibly smoothing the original signal. Our hypothesis was that averaging the breaths on a common trigger event would remove cardiac artifacts while better preserving the ventilation signal as compared to standard filtering; we reasoned that the advantage of the event-triggered averaging process would be particularly relevant around the \u201csharp\u201d changes of the signal, such as the beginning of inspiration, when low-pass filter tends to \u201csmooth\u201d the waveform. The event-trigger averaged processing led to a greater tidal amplitude variation than the filtering technique. This finding might not represent a relevant issue, because EIT variations (\u0394Z) are expressed in arbitrary units and therefore the absolute values are poorly informative; moreover, a fixed \u0394Z/ml unit conversion for all the patients does not exist, but every patient (and probably every EIT examination) exhibits a specific conversion factor. On the contrary, modifications of Tmin due to filtering might represent a relevant finding, since some EIT-derived variables reported in the literature, such as the regional ventilation delay, require an accurate calculation of this specific time point [7]. We showed that the event-triggered average method identifies Tmin much closer to the ventilator as compared to the standard low-pass filtering, reducing the error due to cardiac related impedance changes removal. Lung insufflation as detected on the low-pass filtering waveform begins 0.26 s before ventilator airflow; since the studied patients were paralyzed (i.e. no inspiratory activity was present), such a time-lag is not explained by physiology and is reasonably due to the low-pass filter which reduced amplitude, anticipated Tmin and lowered inspiratory slope. The use of event-trigger averaging appears therefore superior, if not mandatory, for detection of lung physiological processes which are lost with low-pass filtering such as the aforementioned regional ventilation delay.",

An accurate measure of Tmin might be of interest during assisted ventilation (e.g. during the weaning phase) to detect regional phase-shifts due to uncoordinated respiratory muscles activation, possibly leading to ventilation inefficiency. Since assisted ventilation is characterized by higher variability than controlled ventilation, the event-trigger averaging process may be used to obtain a representative waveform of a given ventilation setting, overcoming the issue of variability. However, the precision of event-trigger averaged waveforms might tend to reduce while distancing in time from the triggering event, due to breath-to-breath differences (e.g. variable inspiratory rate or inspiratory time). In an alternative analysis of our dataset, no significant changes in Tmin or Tmax occurred when using the end of inspiration (instead of the beginning) as a triggering event. To obtain the maximum precision, we suggest to choose a triggering event close in time to the phenomenon to be studied, particularly when respiratory variability is high.",

We chose a common filter setting equal to 40/min (0.67 Hz), which normally separates well respiratory from cardiac signal being half-way between a high limit respiratory rate and a low limit heart rate, in a range that should fit most of the patients. It should be noted that the application of the low-pass filter at a frequency higher than 0.67 Hz could produce a lower smoothing of the EIT signal, at price of a less efficient noise removal, particularly in patients with relatively low heart and high respiratory rates. The event-triggered averaging does not require any a priori selection in regard to frequency cutoffs, and it is totally independent from the actual heart or respiratory rates.",
