The first onset of human coronavirus, SARS (SARS-CoV) appeared in 2003 which spanned five continents having lethal effects on human population accompanied by The Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus in 2012 with a death rate of 35%. The viruses remain a threat till date and are of serious concern since no vaccine or specified drug therapy has been approbated for treating human coronaviruses. The viruses became a pandemic worldwide with the emergence of Wuhan coronavirus (2019-nCoV). SARS-CoV2 viral manifestation poses a serious human life risk by causing acute lung injury and various respiratory outcomes and has become a global concern. High pathogenicity and transmission rate of the viral strain has become the spotlight of research community throughout the world. With the ongoing studies on viral structure and host interactions, the intricacy of the viral proteome structure and replication cycle proposes a need to explore our understanding of host factors playing role in viral multiplication cycle. This review provides insight into our prevalent perception of coronavirus-host interactions, structure of SARS-CoV2, receptor mediated entry of virus inside the human cells, ongoing clinical trials and drug therapies and treatments that are being used to combat COVID-19 targeting viral fusion, replication and its multiplication.",

A positive sense single stranded RNA with 5'-cap and 3' polyA tail ranging from [26] [27] [28] [29] [30] [31] [32] Kbs forms the genetic material of coronaviruses (1) .Virion envelope is formed of spike (S) Arch Med Res E20_650 3 protein, membrane (M) protein and the envelope (E) protein, a helical nucleocapsid surrounds the viral genome. Adding to the three envelope proteins some coronaviruses also contain a hemagglutinin esterase (HE) protein (2) . The family of virus can infect different animal species along with humans and have been known over 50 years, with the discovery of first coronavirus in 1930 (3, 4) Four major subgroupings of the coronavirus family include alpha, \u03b2-infecting mammals; \u03b3 and \u03b4-infecting birds predominantly. Human coronaviruses were first spotted amid-1960s. Amongst, seven different coronaviruses that can infect humans, the serotypes that can infect humans are of OC43-like and 229E type. Most common human coronaviruses belong to serotypes OC43 and 229E, both sharing common ancestor with bat coronavirus, (5) . With the divergence of closely associated bat coronaviruses and SARS-CoV in 1986, major outbreak of human coronaviruses causing fatal pneumonia started from the beginning of the 21 st century. With the spurt of SARS-CoV in 2003 spreading to five different continents with a 10% lethal rate and the incurrence of (MERS-CoV) with a fatality rate of 35% in 2012 (6) , outbreak of human coronavirus is considered to be a huge threat due to non-affirmation of any vaccine or specific drug therapy for treating human coronaviruses.",

The viruses became a pandemic worldwide due to their potential to grow and high transmission rate posing a serious public health risk. On February 28 th , 2020 WHO raised the threat caused by this epidemic to the very high level (7) . Based on sequence analysis reports, the 2019-nCoV belongs to the group of \u03b2-coronaviruses possessing a characteristic coronavirus genome structure, the family have Bat-SARS-like (SL)-ZC45, Bat-SL ZXC21, SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV (8) . Ancestral linkages based on phylogenetic analysis of CoVs shows close relation between bat-SL-CoV ZC45 and bat-SL-CoV ZXC21 and COVID-19 as compared to SARS virus (8) . Coronavirus access host cells via its spike proteins, attached on viral envelope. The spike protein initiates receptor Control and Prevention. A diagnostic tool based on RT-PCR has also been described, the method intended to target various combinations of viral genome including Orf region, envelope, nucleocapsid, and RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) genes (11) . For attachment to its host cell coronaviruses use homotrimers of the spike (S) glycoprotein, the S protein acts as a precursor of about 1300 amino acids and is synthesized as single polypeptide chain. S represents the main antigenic determinant at viral surface hence during viral infection S protein remains the target of neutralizing antibodies. Antigen-antibody interaction between viral and human cell proteins units makes it a prime focus towards vaccine designing (12) .",

Structural analysis of coronavirus genome encodes four major structural proteins ( (membrane) and the E (envelope) protein (1) . Different proteins encoded by vial genome regulate different functions, N protein is a multifunction protein regulating transcription processes and virion assembly efficiently. Trimeric S protein (each monomer 180 kDa) initiates viral entry into the target cell. COVID-19 spike (S) protein is a strongly determines viral transmission capacity and host tropism. S protein has a core domain and an external subdomain. Spike (S) protein consists of S1 and S2 subunit both involved in receptor binding and membrane fusion respectively (14) . The S1 subunit of spike protein folds as two independent domains both formed by the N and C terminal of S1 protein. Either of the two domains can serve as the receptor binding domain depending on the viral strain (15) . A serine and arginine rich domain involved in cell signalling known as SR-domain or linker region (LKR) separates the CTD from NTD. The LKR region has been proposed to bind with viral replicase-transcriptase complex (nsp3) and binding induced conformational changes in the LKR region are known to regulate intracellular localization of nucleocapsid (N) protein to the replication site (16) . ORF1ab, ORF3a, ORF6, ORF7a, ORF10 and ORF8 forms the non-structural protein part of the virus that are transcribed. ORF1a and ORF1b cleavage produces a set of non-structural proteins that assemble together to carry out viral replication and transcription processes (17) . Based on recent structural studies and homoly patterns SARS CoV-2 is found to exhibit a high affinity binding potential (10-20 fold) to human ACE2 than that of SARS-CoV owing to its high spread rate among human populations (14) .",

A similar study was conducted by (27, 28) to evaluate whether ACE2 is the common receptor used by (26, 28, 29) . Two main residues N479 and T487 have been associated in SARS-CoV to the recognition of the human ACE2 receptor. Intraspecies infection was possible due to Y442, L472, N479, D480, and T487 residues present in SARS-CoV. Some residues upon slight modification results in a stronger interaction with the receptors on human cell: L455, F486, Q493, and N501. In SARS-CoV-2, the N479 residues coincide to Q493 human cell receptor and T487 shows receptor recognition to N501 which are supported by the local environment present in the ACE2 receptor producing highly favourable electrostatic interactions for receptor binding (19) .",

Therefore, ligand receptor binding upholds spike(S) glycoprotein mediated viral entry into the cell in SARS-C0V2 (30) (31) (32) . The RBD-spike protein acts as receptor recognition site that recognizes the receptors present on hACE2 (human angiotensin converting enzyme 2) regulated by TMPRSS2 proteases.

The shortest of the 7 mRNAs produced encodes the N protein, and the others designated to the synthesis of a further segment of the genome individually.

However, use of convalescent plasma therapy as emergency treatments till the development of a potential drug therapy and vaccine can be considered to treat critically ill patients. A combination of drugs targeting viral replication and its spread inside human body could be of great help. Binding of viral particles to the host cell receptors is the key to viral spread and pathogenesis, using receptor analogues, inhibitors, creating alkaline environments inside the body to prevent receptor binding and further spread of virus is of great importance. Developing strategies to control host receptor binding to the viral particles thus disabling the virus to enter the cells could be of great help towards combating the disease. The treatment of COVID-19 infection is constantly changing with time which will enumerate further perception into the role of above-mentioned treatments against COVID-19 infection.
