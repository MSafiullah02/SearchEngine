It encodes two large polyprotein precursors that are co- and post-translationally processed into active processing intermediates and mature proteins [1]. The structural proteins, encoded by the 3' one-third of the genome, are translated from a subgenomic (SG) mRNA, which is generated by internal initiation from the SG promoter that is located on the complementary minus-strand template. The non-structural (ns) polyprotein is translated directly from the viral genomic RNA. It is processed into individual components, the ns proteins nsP1\u2013nsP4. The nsPs have multiple enzymatic and non-enzymatic functions required in viral RNA replication [2]. Semliki Forest virus (SFV), Sindbis virus (SINV) and Venezuelan equine encephalitis virus (VEEV) are the best studied alphaviruses, and have also been used for the development of gene expression systems [3-5].",

VLPs are produced by co-transfection of cells with an in-vitro-transcribed replicon RNA, which represents the alphavirus genome in which the region coding for structural proteins has been replaced by a gene of interest and a helper RNA encoding for structural proteins [3,7]. In VLP-infected cells, a high level of synthesis of foreign proteins takes place, and at the same time, the system is self-limiting because helper-RNAs are not encapsidated. Layered DNA-RNA vectors represent systems where the cDNA of a replicon vector is flanked with eukaryotic transcription elements, with a promoter at the 5'-end and a poly(A) signal at the 3' end. Layered systems can be used for VLP production; however, more often, they are used for rescue of alphavirus replicons and subsequent protein expression in transfected cells [8-11]. Layered systems have been used to rescue alphavirus genomes in transfected cells [12,13], but so far, not for construction and rescue of replication-competent alphavirus-based vectors.",

            "text": "The replication-competent alphavirus vectors are designed to undergo several rounds of multiplication in cell culture or in hosts. Several approaches have been used for construction of such vectors. First, foreign gene or genes can be inserted in selected position(s) in ns-polyprotein in a way that it is expressed in form of a fusion-protein together with some alphavirus ns-protein [14-16]. Such vectors express the foreign protein at early stages of infection. Second, a protein can also be expressed as cleavable part of an alphavirus-encoded structural or ns polyprotein [17-19]. Third, the number of expression units in a vector can be increased by inserting duplicated copies of SG promoters into the alphavirus genome, either in the 3'-untranslated region (UTR) or into the short intergenic region between the ns and structural regions [20-23]. Such vectors have served as useful instruments for analysis of the structure, function and evolution of SG promoters [20,24-27] and for the analysis of viral movement in infected organisms [28]. Some of these vectors have been used as tools for foreign protein expression [21]. Replication-competent vectors have also been used for cloning and analysis of libraries generated by random or insertion mutagenesis [15,16,25-27], and the use of such vectors for therapeutic and prophylactic applications has also been proposed [6]. In addition to the duplication of SG promoters, the expression of a foreign gene by using an internal ribosomal entry site (IRES) has been described for alphavirus VLPs [29], DNA-RNA layered vectors [30], and replication-competent vectors based on rubella virus, another member of the Togaviridae family [31]. The IRES element has also been utilized to develop VEEV variants incapable of replication in mosquito cells [32].",

It has been reported that the site and mode of the marker gene insertion [15,16,18], the positioning of duplicated SG promoter [23], the host and conditions used for vector propagation [19,23], as well as the nature of the inserted gene itself (our unpublished observations) all affect the stability of replication-competent alphavirus vectors.",

The SG promoter of SINV has been studied extensively for almost two decades. Its minimal sequence consists of 24 residues located from -19 to +5 with respect of the start site of SG mRNA (hereafter, SG promoters are designated as 19/5 etc.), and it is approximately 3\u20136-fold less active than a full-size SG promoter (98/14 or 40/14) of SINV [20,27,37]. In addition, molecular interactions between the replicase of SINV and its SG promoter sequences have been studied [38-40], and specific mechanisms involved in the initiation of translation of SG mRNA have been analysed [41-43]. Much less is known about the SG promoter of SFV. It has been reported that the minimal SG promoter of some SFV isolates (sequence published in [44]), but not that of isolate SFV4 (sequence published in [45]), is active in the context of replication-competent vectors of SINV. This difference has been attributed to the unusual G residue at the -1 position of the SG promoter of SFV4 (most alphaviruses have an A residue at this position). It has been hypothesized that, in the context of the native genome of SFV4, the effect of the -1 G residue might be compensated by some other changes [24].",

The efficiency of the transfection procedure was reproducibly close to 100% (data not shown). The analysis revealed that, as expected, all vectors expressed nsP1 at comparable levels (Figure 2), which indicated efficient replication in transfected cells. In contrast, the level of d1EGFP expression was different: no d1EGFP expression was detected by immunoblotting (Figure 2) or by fluorescent microscopy in SFV4-T21/5-d1EGFP transfected cells, and only very faint d1EGFP expression was detected for this vector by use of flow cytometry (data not shown). At the same time, d1EGFP expression was detected clearly in cells transfected by other vectors. For terminal vectors, the highest level of d1EGFP expression was detected in SFV4-T99/45-d1EGFP-transfected cells, while the d1EGFP levels for SFV4-T26/20-d1EGFP and SFV4-T37/17-d1EGFP were lower and similar to each other (Figure 2). Thus, in the case of terminal vectors, the d1EGFP expression correlated with length of duplicated SG promoter. In the case of all middle vectors, the d1EGFP expression was derived from identical SG promoters. Nevertheless, its expression levels in transfected cells were not identical: a reverse correlation between d1EGFP expression level and the length of duplicated SG promoter was observed (Figure 2). This tendency is similar to that previously observed in SINV vectors [20], and most likely reflects the consequence of competition between SG promoters placed close to each other.",

The growth kinetics of these vectors in transfected cell culture were similar to those of SFV4 (data not shown), and the titres of collected stocks reached 2 \u00d7 108\u20135 \u00d7 108 pfu/ml at 12 h post-transfection. In SFV4-d1EGFP-M21-transfected cells, the levels of capsid protein were significantly lower (Figure 2), the release of infectious virions into the growth medium was delayed by 4 h, and the virus titre at 12 h post-transfection was approximately 100-fold lower than that for other vectors. In addition, very few (<1%) of the cells infected at multiplicity of infection (moi) of 1 with collected stock of SFV4-d1EGFP-M21 were d1EGFP-positive. Taken together, these data indicated that both 21/5 and 21/51 SG promoters were not functional (or had extremely low activity) in their native context. Therefore, SFV4-d1EGFP-M21 was able to replicate its RNA but not to produce structural proteins and consequently to form infectious virions. This resulted in huge selection pressure for re-positioning of the expression of the structural region under the control of an active native SG promoter. The plasticity of the alphavirus genomes allowed the required changes to take place very rapidly; the 4-h delay, observed in virion formation for SFV4-d1EGFP-M21, is in agreement with the time required for SFV4 to accumulate compensatory changes [47]. Thus, the capsid protein detected in SFV4-d1EGFP-M21-transfected cells was most likely produced by recombinant genomes that have gained the ability to express structural proteins and have lost the ability to express d1EGFP. The easiest way to achieve this is the deletion of the inserted sequence by copy-choice recombination between native SG promoter sequences and its duplicated copy, which, in the case of SFV4-d1EGFP-M21, shared an identical region of 51 bases. It was confirmed by RT-PCR and sequencing that exact deletion of inserted d1EGFP and duplicated SG promoter had occurred already in SFV4-d1EGFP-M21-transfected cells, and mutants carrying such a deletion became dominant in the collected stock (data not shown). However, it remains possible that other mechanisms such as selection of compensatory mutations may also have contributed to the activation of structural protein expression.",

In addition, an IRES element from crucifer-infecting tobamovirus (CR IRES) is also functional in SFV VLP systems [29]. Thus, the use of IRES elements in replication-competent alphavirus vectors represents an attractive option for early and efficient expression of the gene of interest. Nevertheless, with the exception of construction of vertebrate-specific VEEV genomes [32], their use in replication-competent alphavirus vectors has not been described.",

In transfected cells, efficient expression of nsP1 and d1EGFP marker was detected (Figure 3). At the same time, the expression of capsid protein (Figure 3), growth kinetics and titres of collected viral stocks were reminiscent of those of SFV4-d1EGFP-M21, except that capsid protein expression, and consequently, the titres of collected stocks (approximately 1\u00d7104\u20134\u00d7104 pfu/ml) were even lower. Thus, the IRES elements were also not functional in the intergenic region of replication-competent SFV4-based vectors. The expression of structural proteins was restored in SFV4-d1EGFP-MEMCV- and SFV4-d1EGFP-MCR-transfected cells by deletion of inserted sequences; however, in these cases, the deletion was less efficient than for SFV4-d1EGFP-M21. The most likely explanation for this is that, unlike SFV4-d1EGFP-M21, SFV4-d1EGFP-MEMCV and SFV4-d1EGFP-MCR do not contain duplicated sequences, which excludes the possibility of deletion by a homologous copy-choice recombination mechanism.",

The only difference was the sequence, placed under the control of IRES elements, which was the structural region of SFV4 instead of bcl2 or hcRed in previously described VLP vectors. There were significant differences between those sequences in terms of length and their secondary structure. Only the secondary structure of the structural region can be modified in replication-competent vectors. Notably, the RNA region, which encodes for the first 31 N-terminal amino acid residues of the capsid protein, forms a strong hairpin structure. Since the hairpin in alphavirus SG mRNA and IRES elements are used by viruses to ensure the translation of their mRNAs in cells in which translation of cellular messages has stopped [41], they may interfere with each other. To test that possibility, the secondary structure of SFV4 capsid hairpin was destabilized by introducing 24 silent mutations into a 93-bp region. These changes resulted in a decrease of predicted minimum free energy for the corresponding fragment of RNA molecule from -40.2 to -11.74 kcal/mol (prediction made by Vienna RNA package RNAfold Webserver software; ), and by analogy with similar manipulation made in the context of the SINV genome [41], should eliminate the functioning of this element in non-typical translation initiation. Destabilization of the capsid hairpin structure greatly increased the intrinsic instability of pSP6-SFV4 plasmid-based constructs, most likely because it enhanced the translation of toxic structural proteins of SFV4 in Escherichia coli. To overcome this problem, all corresponding elements were transferred to pCMV-SFV4 [13], and the resulting infectious plasmids were designated pCMV-SFV4-d1EGFP-MEMCV-HRP- and pCMV-SFV4-d1EGFP-MCR-HRP-(replicating vectors, released from these plasmids, are shown in Figure 1B as Middle2 vectors). When transfected into BHK-21 cells, both plasmids were capable of initiating replication of the vector and d1EGFP expression (data not shown); however, in contrast to pCMV-SFV4, they produced an extremely low amount of capsid protein and infectious virus. Therefore, it was concluded that the destabilization of capsid hairpin structure did not result in activation of IRES function.",

The amount of genomic RNA produced by the constructed vectors was comparable to that of parental SFV4, except that, for SFV4-d1EGFP-M37 and SFV4-d1EGFP-M26, some reduction in the amount genomic RNA (as well as SG mRNAs) was detected. As expected, vectors that contained a duplicated SG promoter produced two SG mRNAs (Figure 5).

Thus, it was again confirmed that, in contrast to the 19/5 SG-promoter of SINV, the 21/5 SG-promoter of SFV4 was extremely weak.

Accumulation of point mutations in inserted sequences caused by the high error rate of RNA polymerases depends on the length of the inserted sequence and not on the design of the vector. At the same time, this process does not result in an increase in genomes with significant growth advantages over the original replication-competent vector. Therefore deletions of the inserted sequences, which results in at least three important advantages for the mutated genome, are the main factor that reduces genetic stability of the vector. Namely: (i) smaller sizes facilitate packaging of the genome; (ii) elimination of inserted expression units restores the wild-type regulation and coordination of viral RNA and protein synthesis; and (iii) shorter genomes can replicate faster. Thus, wild-type-like virus that can produce up to 10-fold more infectious progeny (Figure 4) is capable of superseding the original replication-competent vector. The efficiency of this process depends on the conditions of virus propagation. In the case of high moi, the competition takes place only inside the infected cells, and under these conditions, the high molar excess of original vector genomes reduces the growth advantage of the deletion mutants. In contrast, low moi involves spreading of the infection in cell culture and therefore strongly favours wild-type-like sequences.",

In the first experiment, SFV4-T26/20-d1EGFP, SFV4-T37/17-d1EGFP and SFV4-T99/45-EGFP were propagated five times at an moi of 10 in BHK-21 cells, and the percentage of d1EGFP-positive cells in each passage was measured by flow cytometry. All cells infected with corresponding P5 stocks were found to be d1EGFP-positive (e.g., they were infected by at least one particle capable of initiating d1EGFP expression) (data not shown). In the second experiment, in which the stability analysis was carried out at low moi [18,19,23], clear differences in stability of replication-competent vectors were revealed (Table 1). Since the d1EGFP fluorescence in infected cells was transient and relatively weak, genome stability of the replication-competent vectors was also analysed by RT-PCR. Results of RT-PCR analysis were highly coherent with those presented in Table 1 and revealed that the decrease in the percentage of d1EGFP-positive plaques correlated with the percentage of genomes with deletion of the inserted marker (data not shown). The main conclusion from this experiment is that all terminal vectors of SFV4 were more stable than their middle vector counterparts. The differences could not be attributed to differences in growth properties (Figure 4); instead, they may have originated from the different outcome of homologous copy-choice recombination. In the case of middle vectors, the homologous recombination between native and duplicated SG promoters resulted in re-creation of the wild-type SFV4 genome. In the case of terminal vectors, the same process resulted in deletion of the structural region. It can be seen that, at least for terminal vectors, the vectors with shorter duplicated SG promoters were more stable than those that contained the longest duplicated SG promoter. The most likely reason for this was the slower growth rate of the latter (Figure 4), which increased growth advantage of deletion mutants over the original vector genomes.",

Thus, if the elements required for foreign gene expression are included in one of derivatives of these plasmids, it may be possible to rejoin it with another part of the SFV4 genome and use the resulting molecule directly for in vitro transcription. One possibility to achieve this is to use PCR. Unfortunately, PCR always lead to generation of a pool of heterogeneous sequences that contain random PCR mutations, which can have unpredictable effects on the properties of the replication-competent vectors. Therefore, instead of using PCR, we designed vectors in which a unique ApaI restriction site was located downstream of d1EGFP in pSFV1-PLApa-d1EGFP -and upstream of duplicated SG promoter in pHelper96, pHelper37, pHelper26 and pHelper21. The fragment that contained the SP6 promoter, the ns region of SFV4 and d1EGFP was cut out from pSFV1-PLApa-d1EGFP by SphI/ApaI restriction and ligated to the ApaI/SpeI fragment from pHelper96 that contained a duplicated SG promoter, structural region, and a 3'-UTR with the poly(A) of SFV4 (Figure 6A). The products of the ligation reaction were transcribed in vitro and, since only the transcript corresponding to the genome of the replication-competent vector contained all the elements needed for initiation of replication, the mixture was directly used to transfect BHK-21 cells. Analysis of transfected cells by fluorescent microscopy revealed that d1EGFP expression and replication were initiated in a large number of cells. By 24 h post-transfection, all cells showed the symptoms of infection and the collected virus stock had a titre and properties similar to the stock obtained from cells transfected by transcripts from pSFV4-d1EGFP-M96. Thus, the in vitro ligation/transcription procedure can be used for construction of genomes of replication-competent SFV vectors.",

Therefore, another possible application of the developed in vitro ligation/transcription procedure is its usage for constructing SFV4 replication-competent vector-based libraries. The first option for doing this is to convert VLP-replicon libraries, generated by the use of pSFV1-PLApa or similar vectors, to replication-competent vector libraries by the use of the above approach. This will, however, result in replication-competent vectors that carry inserted sequences in the middle position that, according to our data (Table 1), are relatively unstable. Nevertheless, the approach can be used if the vector instability is not a serious problem or it is overcome by changes in vector design. The second option is to generate libraries using terminal vectors. To demonstrate the feasibility of this approach, 1 \u03bcg of the SphI/BamH1 restriction fragment from pSFV4-T37/17 vector was ligated with a BamH1-digested PCR fragment that contained a 21-bp randomized region, d1EGFP encoding sequence, and a 3'-UTR and poly(A) tail of SFV4 (Figure 6B). The ligation product was transcribed in vitro and used for transfection of BHK-21 cells. The number of initially transfected cells (corresponding to the number of replication-competent vectors with different insertions in the library) was measured by an infectious centre assay. After the optimisation of DNA purification, ligation and transcription procedures, libraries that contained 2\u00d7105\u20135\u00d7105 different replication-competent vector genomes were obtained per single in vitro ligation/transcription procedure. These libraries were subsequently amplified to high titre, propagated up to five times at an moi of 0.1, and analysed again for their ability to express d1EGFP and the presence of randomised sequences. The results of this analysis confirmed that the inserted sequences were stable in the pSFV4-T37/17-based library. Thus, the in vitro ligation/transcription procedure can be used for construction of large SFV replication-competent-vector-based expression libraries that can be subsequently propagated and subjected to various analyses.",

It has been hypothesized that, under native conditions, this change may be compensated by other changes in the virus genome [24]. Indeed, it has been shown that changes in cis-elements of alphaviruses can be compensated by changes in replicase proteins and vice versa [48,49]. The data presented above did not, however, support this hypothesis, since the 21/5 SG promoter of SFV4 had no detectable activity in the context of SFV4-derived replication-competent vectors (Figure 5). Furthermore, the extreme instability of the SFV4-d1EGFP-M21 suggests that the even longer, 21/51 SG promoter of SFV4 was much less active than the minimal SG promoter of SINV, which has been used in SINV vectors of analogous design. Although the specific impact of the sequences located downstream of the +5 position on the activity of SFV4 SG promoter was not studied in detail, it is clear that if these elements contributed to the activity of the SG-promoter, their effect was rather small. Again, this differs from the data obtained for SINV, in which the region located between positions +6 and +14 significantly contributes to the activity of SG promoters [27]. Thus, the minimal SG promoter of SFV4 must contain more than 21 upstream residues. Three different regions upstream of the +21 position were identified (Figure 1A): the -30/-35 region, which is conserved in SG promoters of alphaviruses [27], and two non-conserved regions, located downstream (-29/-22) and upstream (ns/-36) of the conserved element. The analysis of SG mRNA synthesis revealed that T26/20, T37/17 and T99/45 SG promoters, as well as 26/51, 37/51 and 96/51 SG promoters, were active and there were no major differences in their activities (Figure 5). Thus, the effect of the -1 G residue in the SG promoter of SFV4 was compensated by the unique sequences located in the -22 to -26 region.",

It is possible that the stability of replication-competent alphavirus vectors may depend on their construction, for example, from the exact position of duplicated elements and/or from the genetic background of the vector itself. Our analysis also indicated that the loss of the ability to express a functional gene of interest correlates with the loss of the gene (or full expression unit), and is most likely caused by gradual superseding of the original replication-competent vector by its faster-growing deletion variants. Thus, the stability of replication-competent vectors depends on the frequency of formation of replication-competent genomes with deletions and on their growth advantage over the original vector. Both these factors may contribute to the lower genetic stability of the middle vectors because the homologous copy-choice recombination between SG promoters results in the wild-type virus genome, which has the biggest growth advantage over the replication-competent vector. In the case of terminal vectors, only non-homologous recombination events, which do not result in reversion to exact wild-type genome, can take place. However, other factors such as slightly larger sizes of duplications, and stronger interference between native and inserted elements cannot be excluded as reasons behind lower stability of middle vectors.",

In contrast to the common practice with propagation of viral stocks, when low moi is used to avoid an increase in defective interfering (DI) genomes, the replication-competent vectors should be propagated under high moi conditions. The deletion variants of replication-competent vectors are, in contrast to DI genomes, fully competent for replication and particle production, and have an increased growth advantage when the propagation involves spreading in cell culture. Alternatively, the size of sample used for vector propagation, should be reduced. Our data on the stability of recombinant stocks (Table 1) indicate that, in general, P1 stock contains less than 1% defective vectors. Northern blot analysis revealed the same (Figure 5), which indicates that the initial appearance of deletion mutants is a relatively rare event. Thus, if the size of the sample used for propagation of the replication-competent vector stock is kept sufficiently small that it does not already contain deletion versions, then the probability of their formation remains low, and they will less likely become dominant in the population.",

Thus, under the conditions used for vector propagation (moi 0.1), the ~1000-bp SG promoter d1EGFP insert would likely acquire more than one point mutation during five passages of the stock. Therefore, at least in part, the loss of functional d1EGFP expression in P4 and P5 stocks may be caused by accidental point mutations formed by RNA replicase.

            "text": "The use of IRES elements was considered as an alternative for SG promoter insertion, since it avoids duplication of viral sequences and allows early protein expression directly from genomic RNA of vectors. IRES elements and the d1EGFP sequence placed under their control were well tolerated and maintained in terminal vectors (Figure 5), but in all cases, the IRES elements themselves were non-functional, regardless of their origin (EMCV IRES or CR IRES) and insertion site. In contrast, EMCV IRES inserted into the VEEV genome is functional and can be used to direct synthesis of the structural proteins of this virus [32]. IRES-containing VEEV also has an interesting functional defect: despite effective replication and structural protein expression, it produces very few infectious virions. This defect is compensated by mutations in nsP2 but the mechanism of compensation is not fully understood [32]. Currently, it is unclear if the selection for compensatory mutations can be used to activate the IRES-derived expression in the case of replication-competent SFV4-based vectors. An alternative approach, the removal of the hairpin structure of SG mRNA, which can functionally or structurally interfere with the activity of IRES elements, failed to restore IRES activity. Thus, in contrast to the alphavirus-derived VLP or DNA-RNA layered vectors, IRES elements did not function in SFV4-derived replication-competent vectors. The mechanisms responsible for this phenomenon, as well as those responsible for differences between SFV4 and VEEV-based systems remain unknown.",

However, such libraries have several problems. First, the suicidal nature of these VLP-system vectors does not allow propagation of the library. To some extent, this problem can be overcome by the use of packaging cell lines [51] or three-component vector systems described for SINV vectors [52]. Second, in general, these systems do not produce infectious progeny in cells used for functional analysis of expressed proteins. Consequently, the vector's genetic material must be extracted from selected cells and analysed. If functional analysis requires multiple cycles of selection, it becomes time consuming and complicated. Therefore replication-competent vectors, which can be propagated and produce infectious progeny in any infected cell, greatly simplify the analysis and selection of viruses during multiple cycles of analysis. On the other hand, specific problems such as stability and the packaging limit for such a vector are typical for replication-competent vector-based libraries. Thus, the approach that allows easy conversion of VLP-based expression libraries to replication-competent vector libraries (Figure 6A) and combines benefits of both systems, may be useful. The same approach can also be used for conversion of any single VLP-type vector into a replication-competent vector.",

            "text": "The single-step in vitro ligation/transcription procedure offers an alternative for constructing VLP-based libraries and their subsequent conversion to replication-competent vector libraries. In the case of middle vectors, it is required that three fragments, which represent the replicase, insert (library) and structural part, are joined in one reaction. The efficiency of this process was much lower (data not shown) than for terminal vectors, for which only two fragments had to be joined (Figure 6B). In the latter case, the second fragment should, however, contain sequences required for alphavirus replication. In the present study, this was achieved by the use of plasmid vectors that contained a 3'-UTR of SFV4 followed by a poly(A) tract. This may not have been necessary since the essential 3'-elements required for replication of the alphavirus genome consist only of 19 conserved 3'-residues and a poly(A) tract that contains 12 A residues [53]. Such 31-base sequences can be included in primers used for library generation. pSFV4-T26/20, pSFV4-T37/17 or pSFV4-T99/45 can be used as vectors for the library. Even the use of pSFV4-T21/5 can be envisaged for cases where very low expression levels of inserted genes are required. The in vitro ligation/transcription procedure was efficient and allowed us to obtain highly representative libraries that contained hundreds of thousands of different viral clones (or more, if more material was used for ligation/transcription, or if the procedure of joining two fragments were further optimised). It was also found that expression cassettes of other types of SFV4-based vectors such as SFV4(3H)-eGFP or SFV4-steGFP [19] could be combined with any terminal vector that allowed expression of two foreign proteins (data not shown). For example, the first cassette can be used for expressing a marker, which allows identification/purification of infected cells (or for expressing a reporter to provide an internal standard), while the duplicated SG promoter of the terminal vector may be used for expression of the library. The downside of this approach is the reduced capacity of such vectors (decreased by the size of the first expression cassette), and the possibly reduced genetic stability caused by the large size of the genome.",

Instead, the minimal SG promoter of SFV4 is longer than those of other alphaviruses and includes residues located in the -22 to -26 region. The presence of residues located upstream of position -27 and possibly, residues located downstream of position +5, has a smaller effect on the activity of the SG promoter of SFV4 than that of SINV [27].",

These data allow us to conclude that the loss of ability to express functional markers by replication-competent vectors is mainly caused by the loss of inserted sequences.

This may be a consequence of higher efficiency of homologous recombination compared to the mechanisms of deletion by non-homologous recombination, or it may result from the fact that homologous recombination reverts the vector to the wild-type SFV4 (which has the biggest growth advantages over the vectors with inserts). These tendencies should be taken into account for design of stable and efficient replication-competent vectors of SFV4 and for selection of conditions for their propagation.",

For library construction, the DNA fragment obtained by SphI and BamHI digestion of pSFV4-T37/17 (containing the promoter for SP6 RNA polymerase, full-lenght cDNA of the SFV4 genome except for the 3'-UTR and duplicated 37/17 SG promoter) was ligated with a fragment obtained by BamHI digestion of an in vitro mutagenesis product (containing a randomised region followed by the coding sequence of d1EGFP, 3'-UTR of SFV4 and poly(A)48 sequence). The following conditions of ligation were used: 1 \u03bcg of DNA fragment that contained cDNA for the ns region of SFV4, was ligated with 10-fold molar excess of DNA fragment that contained cDNA for the 3' regions of SFV4. Ligation was carried using T4 DNA ligase (Roche) in the presence of PEG at 12\u00b0C for 24 h.
