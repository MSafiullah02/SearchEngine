This report describes the molecular epidemiology of hMPV and hBoV infections observed following viral surveillance of children hospitalized for acute respiratory tract infections in Milan, Italy. Pharyngeal swabs were collected from 240 children 3 years of age (130 males, 110 females; median age, 5.0 months; IQR, 2.0-12.5 months) and tested for respiratory viruses, including hMPV and hBoV, by molecular methods. hMPV-RNA and hBoV-DNA positive samples were characterized molecularly and a phylogenetical analysis was performed. PCR analysis identified 131/240 (54.6%) samples positive for at least one virus. The frequency of hMPV and hBoV infections was similar (8.3% and 12.1%, respectively). Both infections were associated with lower respiratory tract infections: hMPV was present as a single infectious agent in 7.2% of children with bronchiolitis, hBoV was associated with 18.5% of pediatric pneumonias and identified frequently as a single etiological agent. Genetically distinct hMPV and hBoV strains were identified in children examined with respiratory tract infections. Phylogenetic analysis showed an increased prevalence of hMPV genotype A (A2b sublineage) compared to genotype B (80% vs. 20%, respectively) and of the hBoV genotype St2 compared to genotype St1 (71.4% vs. 28.6%, respectively). Interestingly, a shift in hMPV infections resulting from A2 strains has been observed in recent years.

These infections are ubiquitous and contagious, affecting repeatedly individuals of all ages, particularly children younger than 5 years of age [World Health Organization, 2009 ] and many infections have unknown etiologies. The recent discovery of the human Metapneumovirus (hMPV) in 2001 [van den Hoogen et al., 2001 and of the human Bocavirus (hBoV) in 2005 [Allander et al., 2005] identified the etiological causes of several respiratory infections. hMPV is a common cause of respiratory disease in children under 5 years old and often accounts for severe clinical manifestations, including bronchiolitis or pneumonia [Foulongne et al., 2006] .",

The extended persistence of hBoV in airways (up to 7 months) increased patient's chances of acquiring a co-infection, explaining the high frequency of co-infections with this virus [Brieu et al., 2008; Lindner et al., 2008; von Linstow et al., 2008] . The seasonal distribution of hBoV, with a peak incidence between December and January, resembled that observed for RSV, hRV, and hAdV. This suggested that the overlapping distribution of these viruses during the seasons could have facilitated hBoV co-infections. The epidemiologic model of hMPV infections was distinct from many other respiratory viruses, with peak incidence rates in late spring, mostly between March and April. This observation may account for the absence of hMPV-hBoV co-infections.",

            "text": "Co-circulation of both hMPV genotypes was observed, with predominance of genotype A (particularly the A2b sublineage), supporting previous reports demonstrating an increase in A2 strain infections in recent years [Boivin et al., 2004; Wang et al., 2008; Herbert et al., 2005] . Guant et al. [Gaunt et al., 2006 during the winter season of 2007/2008. Unfortunately, no samples from this study were available for sequencing to confirm this hypothesis. As suggested by Herbert et al. [2005] , the complex circulation pattern of hMPV may be the reason this strain can escape pre-existing host immune responses, suggesting that additional molecular surveillance studies need to be carried out to confirm genotype B back shift circulation and to clarify the existence of a seasonal distribution of hMPV strains. Phylogenetic analyses demonstrated that both hBoV genotypes co-circulated during the study period and that genotype St2 predominated. Interestingly, evidence of genetic recombination between the two hBoV strains (with a breakpoint site in the VP1/VP2 region) was found. The two mosaic sequences (identity: 100%) were identified in two different years (2007 and 2008) , indicating that this variant had been circulating in the population since at least 2007. Genetic recombination has been reported to occur in Parvoviruses [Shackelton et al., 2007; Ohshima and Mochizuki, 2009 ] and in different hBoV species [Arthur et al., 2009; Kapoor et al., 2009 Kapoor et al., , 2010 . To date, only Lin et al. [2009] have reported an intra-species recombination event involving hBoV1, with a breakpoint located in the NS1 gene. Taken together, these data suggested that intra-species recombination could occur in hBoV1 at different positions of its genome, playing a major role in the evolutionary history of this virus. Further studies will be necessary to identify breakpoint patterns in these viruses and to identify their potential association with viral spread among populations.",
