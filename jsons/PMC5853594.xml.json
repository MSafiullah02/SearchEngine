These include multiple chemokines, small secreted proteins that function as chemoattractants to recruit cells of the immune system to infected tissues.

Patients were primarily older adults (72% of patients over the age of 50) and also included young children (15% of patients vs 6% in Study 1; Supplementary Figures S1 and S3). CXCL10 and CXCL11 concentrations correlated highly with viral infection (Figure 4A). Samples were initially tested for the 9-virus panel and CoVs as in Study 1, then results were compared to biomarker levels. Because several virus-negative samples had very high levels of CXCL10 or CXCL11, we further expanded the test panel by testing for parainfluenza virus type 4 (PIV4). Three samples tested positive for PIV4, including 2 samples with high levels of CXCL10 and CXCL11 in which no other virus was detected. Figure 4A shows an expanded view of the 40 samples with the highest levels of CXCL11. Detected viruses that were not in the original test panel (Table 1) are indicated with an asterisk. We also observed CXCL11-low samples with viruses detected (Figure 4A). Rhinovirus was detected in the 3 virus-positive samples with the lowest concentrations of CXCL11. Further analysis of RV-positive samples in Study 2 revealed a correlation between [CXCL11] and [CXCL10] and the level of RV RNA detected by RT-qPCR, with the chemokine-low samples also having lower levels of RV (Supplementary Figure S4).",

As shown, high CXCL11 levels correlated strongly with virus detection and low levels correlated with absence of virus, with intermediate levels being indeterminate. Based on this pattern, it is possible to envision developing a rule-in/rule-out test using a high cutoff above which samples are predicted to be virus positive, and below which samples are predicted to be virus negative. Dashed grey lines in Figure 5 represent cutoffs of >80 pg/mL for rule-in, which in this sample set would have a positive predictive value (PPV) of 90% or a cutoff of >50 pg/mL, with a PPV of 86%; dotted black lines indicate a low cutoff of 10 pg/mL, below which this test has a negative predictive value of 94% for absence of virus infection. Using cutoffs of >80 pg/mL and <10 pg/mL, about 1/3 of the samples (35%) fall into the indeterminate zone. Consistent with the observations from each study (Figures 3 and 4A), we observed a high degree of correlation between CXCL10 and CXCL11 protein concentrations (Supplementary Figure S5; for 219 samples, R2 = 0.80) and a high correlation of each biomarker with virus detection (in set of 219 samples, CXCL11 AUC = 0.901; 95% CI, 0.86\u20130.94; CXCL10 AUC = 0.83; 95% CI, 0.80\u20130.91; Supplementary Figure S6). Although only CXCL11 is shown in Figure 5, either CXCL11 or CXCL10 measurements could be used to rule in/rule out virus infection. In sum, these results demonstrate how an immunoassay-based test measuring a single host protein could have high diagnostic utility for managing patients with suspected respiratory infection.",

Consistently, analysis of rhinovirus-positive samples in Study 2 showed a clear correlation between low [CXCL11] and low viral load (Supplementary Figure S4). Biomarker-positive, virus-negative samples could represent infections with untested viruses. Applying technologies such as deep sequencing for viral identification could provide greater estimates of biomarker accuracy in future studies [36]. It will also be important to rule out nonviral biological processes leading to biomarker elevation. For example, elevated CXCR3 chemokines have been reported in chronic respiratory diseases [37]. Encouragingly, our initial results indicate specificity of the biomarker test for virus infection in this population.

If these biomarkers perform well in outpatients with acute upper respiratory infection, it is possible to imagine transformative new tests to aid in rapid diagnosis of these common illnesses and promote antimicrobial stewardship. For example, a pan-viral biomarker could potentially be paired with an analogous biomarker of bacterial respiratory infection to distinguish among viral infection, bacterial infection, and viral/bacterial coinfection.

Plots show mRNA levels for 68 samples relative to the mRNA level in resting human nasal epithelial cells (HNEC (\u2212)), sorted by mRNA level for each transcript. Biomarker mRNA was normalized to \u03b2-actin mRNA in the same sample. Each mRNA biomarker was scored positive if level was above the level observed in SLR14-stimulated HNEC, indicated by the dotted line and lowest bar on each graph (HNEC bars show mean and SD of 3 replicates). mRNA levels were normalized to the level of \u03b2-actin mRNA in each sample. Bars in virus column indicate samples that tested positive for respiratory virus by qPCR. Bars marked with asterisk indicate the 5 samples that were negative on the initial virology test panel but positive upon subsequent testing for CoV. B, Test performance of mRNA biomarker signature. Samples were scored as biomarker test positive if 2/3 mRNA biomarkers were above the cutoff (dotted lines).
