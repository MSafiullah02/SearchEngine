Results: Here, by manually curating a high-quality database of 268 pairs of mammalian virus-host receptor interaction, which included 128 unique viral species or sub-species and 119 virus receptors, we found the viral receptors are structurally and functionally diverse, yet they had several common features when compared to other cell membrane proteins: more protein domains, higher level of N-glycosylation, higher ratio of self-interaction and more interaction partners, and higher expression in most tissues of the host. This study could deepen our understanding of virus-receptor interaction. Availability and implementation: The database of mammalian virus-host receptor interaction is available at",

The virus is the most abundant biological entity on Earth and exists in all habitats of the world (Paez-Espino et al., 2016) . Nearly all cellular organisms are prey to viral attacks. Humans were reported to be infected by hundreds of viruses (Geoghegan et al., 2016; Mihara et al., 2016) . Most of the human emerging infectious diseases are zoonotic, with viruses that originate in mammals of particular concern (Olival et al., 2017) , such as the Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) (Sharp and Hahn, 2011) and Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus (SARS-CoV) (Ge et al., 2013) . Mammals are the most closely related animals to human in phylogeny, and contact with human most frequently (Olival et al., 2017) , especially the livestock and pet. For effective control of human viral diseases, great attentions should be paid to mammalian viruses.",

Multiple types of molecules including protein (Li, 2016; Wang, 2002; Yan et al., 2012) , carbohydrate (Isa et al., 2006; Peng et al., 2017) and lipid (Mazzon and Mercer, 2014) , could be used as viral receptors (Baranowski et al., 2001; Casasnovas, 2013) . The important question of why viruses show strong preferential binding to particular host receptors remains unanswered (Casasnovas, 2013; Grove and Marsh, 2011; Li, 2016; Backovic and Rey, 2012) . Specificity and affinity are the most important factors for receptor-virus interactions (Casasnovas, 2013) . Widely distributed on host cell surfaces, carbohydrates and lipids are easy targets for viruses (Dimitrov, 2004; Li, 2015a,b) . Compared to these molecules, proteins were reported to be more suitable receptors because of stronger affinity and higher specificity for viral attachment, which could increase the efficiency of viral entry and facilitate viruses to expand their host ranges and alter their tropisms (Baranowski et al., 2001; Casasnovas, 2013; Dimitrov, 2004; Li, 2015a,b; Wang, 2002) . Previous studies have shown that proteins that were abundant in the host cell surface or had relatively low affinity for their natural ligands, such as proteins involved in cell adhesion and recognition (Dimitrov, 2004; Wang, 2002) , were preferred by viruses as receptors. This suggests that the selection of proteins by viruses as receptors should not be a random process. A systematic analysis of the characteristics of the viral receptor could help understand the mechanisms behind receptor selection by viruses.",

Then, the receptor usage was analyzed on the level of viral family. Indeed, all fifteen viral families containing two or more viruses in the database used two or more sets of receptors, suggesting that different viruses in the same family prefer different receptors. For instance, in the family of Togaviridae, the Chikungunya virus (CHIKV), the Rubella virus (RBV) and the Sindbis virus (SBV) preferred prohibitin (PHB), myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein (MOG) and ribosomal protein SA (RPSA) as the receptor, respectively. Meanwhile, viruses in different families or groups preferred one specific receptor ( Supplementary Fig. S1 ).

To evaluate the role of proteins in the human PPIN, the degree of each protein, which was defined as the number of connections the protein has to other proteins in the human PPIN, was calculated. The results showed that the degrees for human membrane proteins and cell membrane proteins were significantly smaller than those of other human proteins ( Fig. 2A and Supplementary Fig. S4A , P-value < 0.001 in Wilcox rank-sum test) in the PPIN. Notably, the human virus receptor protein, which is a subset of the human cell membrane protein, had significantly larger degrees than other human proteins did in the PPIN ( Fig. 2A and Supplementary Fig. S4 , P-value < 0.001 in Wilcox rank-sum test). Additionally, the human virus receptors had a median of 13 interaction partners in the PPIN ( Fig. 2A) , which was nearly twice as much as that of all human proteins. Specifically, six viral receptors, including the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), the heat shock protein family A member 8 (HSPA8), the PHB, the RPSA, the CD4 molecule (CD4) and the integrin subunit beta 1 (ITGB1), were observed to have more than 100 interaction partners (Fig. 2B ). For robustness of these results, the node betweenness (another measure of node centrality in network) of each protein was also calculated based on the human PPIN. The results showed that the betweenness of human viral receptors was significantly higher than that of other sets of proteins (Supplementary Fig. S4B and C) , further demonstrating the importance of human viral receptors in human PPIN.",

The results showed that all mammalian virus receptors (119 receptors) involved in this study had homologs in 25-108 mammal species and a viral receptor had homologs in 103 mammal species on average ( Supplementary Fig. S5A ). For instance, Claudin-1, which is a major component of the tight junction complexes that regulate the permeability of epithelia, has homologs in all 108 mammal species. Then, we calculated the average pairwise sequence identities between mammalian virus receptors and their homologs in mammal species. They ranged from 0.42 to 0.98, with a median of 0.80 ( Supplementary Fig. S5B ). Further analysis of the conservation of amino acid sites on mammalian virus receptors showed that over 60% of sites had conservation scores (defined as the ratio of the dominant amino acid in the site) larger than 0.9 in viral receptors, although these amino acid sites had conservation scores ranging from 0.15 to 1 (Supplementary Fig. S5C) . Finally, the conservation of protein structural domains of mammalian virus receptors in mammals was analyzed. As shown in Supplementary Table S5 , each viral receptor has at least one structural domain that is completely conserved in the receptor and its homologs (Supplementary Table  S5 ). Besides, 47 categories of structural domains were observed in certain viral receptors and their homologs. For instance, all homologs of Integrin beta-8 have both Integrin_beta and EGF_2 domains, while 68% of homologs of Integrin beta-8 have a PSI_integrin domain.",

            "text": "This study proposes a systematic investigation of the structural, functional, evolutionary and tissue-specific expression characteristics of mammalian virus receptors based on the largest dataset ever reported about the mammalian virus-host receptor interaction. It was found that the viral receptors were a subset of structurally and functionally diverse cell membrane proteins. They were enriched in GO terms and KEGG pathways related to junctions, adhesion and binding, which were typical features of viral receptors reported elsewhere (Backovic and Rey, 2012; Baranowski et al., 2001; Casasnovas, 2013; Dimitrov, 2004; Wang, 2002) . This study identified several features that have not been reported for viral receptors. Firstly, the viral receptor had a higher level of N-glycosylation than other proteins. As we know, glycosylation of proteins is widely observed in eukaryote cells (Corfield, 2017) and plays a key role in multiple cellular activities such as folding and stability of glycoprotein, immune response, cell-cell adhesion. Glycans are abundant on host cell surfaces and are probably the primordial and fallback receptors for the virus (Li, 2015a,b) . To take glycans as their receptors, various viruses employed a host galectin as its viral lectin (Krupovic and Koonin, 2017; Li, 2015a,b) . For instance, the single jelly roll (SJR) fold, which was responsible for glycan recognition and binding in cellular proteins, was observed in viral capsid proteins of over 25% of all viruses (Krupovic and Koonin, 2017) . Hence, the protein with high level of glycosylation could provide a basal attachment ability for the virus and might be the preferred receptor for viruses during the protein receptor searching process.",

            "text": "Secondly, this study demonstrated that the viral receptor protein had a tendency for self-interaction and possessed more interaction partners than other membrane proteins. Besides functioning as viral receptor, the receptor protein also functions in the host cell by interacting with other proteins of the host, including signal molecules and ligands. Therefore, viruses have to compete with these proteins for binding to the receptor (Wang, 2002) and the proteins with less interaction partners are supposed to be preferred by viruses. One possible reason for viruses selecting proteins with multiple interaction partners as receptors is that the receptor proteins are closely related to the 'door' of the cell, so that proteins have to interact with them for in-and-out of the cell. This is partially validated by the observation that six of the top ten enriched terms in the domain of GO Biological Process were related to protein targeting or localization for the interaction partners of human viral receptors (Supplementary Table S3 ). For entry into the cell, the virus also selects these proteins as receptors. Another possible reason is that viral entry into the cell needs cooperation of multiple proteins which were not identified as viral receptors. Additionally, previous studies suggested that viruses could structurally mimic native host ligands (Drayman et al., 2013) , which help them bind to the host receptor. Therefore, membrane proteins with multiple interaction partners are more likely to be selected by viruses as receptors.",

            "text": "Nevertheless, this study has several limitations. Firstly, the viral receptor was biased towards the human owing to the bias of studies towards human viruses. Fortunately, the viral receptor was conserved in mammal species to a large extent, resulting in reduced influence of the bias on the diversity of viral receptors. Secondly, the database of mammalian virus-host receptor interaction was still limited in its size due to the difficulties of identifying viral receptors (Li, 2015a,b; Pillay et al., 2016; Yan et al., 2012) . Therefore, effective methods, either experimental or computational (Drayman et al., 2013) , shall be developed for identifying viral receptors, while this study may facilitate this process. Thirdly, the interfaces of receptors and viruses need further investigations in most cases. The residues on the interfaces have a direct effect on the affinity and specificity of virus-receptor interactions. Previous studies demonstrated that mutations of these residues could alter virus-receptor interactions and hinder, if not abolish, virus infections (Bosch et al., 2013; Colon-Moran et al., 2017; Ng et al., 2015) . For example, a single amino acid change in the NPC1 could greatly reduce the affinity of EBOV-NPC1 interaction in African straw-colored fruit bats (Ng et al., 2015) . Hence, great efforts must be invested to identify the interaction interface between receptors and viruses.",
