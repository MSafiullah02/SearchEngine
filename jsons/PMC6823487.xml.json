The family members are small, spherical, non-enveloped viruses, with icosahedral symmetry. The viral genome is a monopartite, linear, polyadenylated positive ssRNA of 7.1\u20138.9 kb in length, including a single ORF encoding a large polyprotein6,7. To date, bat picornaviruses (BtPVs) discovered are associated to the Mischivirus, Hepatovirus, Crohivirus, Kunsagivirus, Kobuvirus and Shanbavirus genus or remain unassigned8,9. To the best of our knowledge, M. schreibersii bats are the primary hosts regarding mischiviruses, which are classified in three distinct species, namely Mischivirus A10, Mischivirus B11, and Mischivirus C. However, new putative mischivirus sequences were described from both Romanian Myotis myotis and Myotis oxygnathus. Additionally, other detected BtPVs clustered together with canine and feline picornaviruses12 suggests host-jumping events during their evolution.",

Likewise, we tallied six PV phylogenetic clusters for Miniopterus genus, five for Myotis, five for Rhinolophus, five for Eidolon, two for Hipposideros, two for Nyctalus, one for Coleura, and one for Ia. Since these BtPVs are related to different host species and sampled from varying locations, the number of RdRp sequences and/or host species within each cluster are different. Strikingly, several of the clusters are composed of a single BtPV RdRp sequence. A very strong correlation was observed among the number of BtPV specific clusters and both its species richness (r = 0.94; p = 0.0001), or geographical sampling area (r = 0.84; p = 0.002).

Additionally, host specificity was not observed, suggesting it is not involved in the evolutionary history regarding BtPVs. Moreover, we found the occurrence of cross-species transmission events may likely increase with sympatry. Notwithstanding the exploitation of all available information in reference to BtPVs, admittedly, this study bears limitations, primarily related either to the quality of the available data, or the lack thereof. To cite an example, the precise classification of the Romanian putative mischiviruses was not possible due to the short length of the viral sequences. Additionally, we could not use several BtPVs sequences originating from America since the hosts\u2019 species were unknown. Undeniably, the impact of the misclassification of several host species should not be entirely ignored.",

Moreover, we noticed how the BtPVs data panel is small (n = 69) and unbalanced, since most studies were undertaken primarily throughout Europe and Asia, while other continents are characteristically, under-represented (America n = 1, Australia = 0). Furthermore, the sampled bats included in this study represent just 4.8% of the total currently recognized bat genera, and 2.2% of the total bat species known so far, leaving the greater majority yet unexplored.",
