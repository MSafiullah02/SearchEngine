The same month, in propitious timing, a few hundred of the world\u2019s leading physicians, scientists, government agency officials, and nonprofit leaders gathered at an inaugural 2-day conference jointly sponsored by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and National Institutes of Health (NIH) in Washington, DC. The topic of the conference was \u201cRepurposing Off-Patent Drugs,\u201d and attendees had convened to discuss how widely used, low-cost, and safe medicines that are approved for one indication might be harnessed to provide additional, novel, and sometimes unexpected therapeutic benefits in other diseases.",

The publicity generated by the US president endorsing the antimalarial agents hydroxychloroquine and chloroquine as treatments for COVID-19 jolted regulatory authorities worldwide. The FDA felt compelled to grant emergency-use authorization for these drugs, while the European Medicines Agency held back, urging that they should not be prescribed outside of clinical trials and nationally agreed upon protocols. In the absence of proven treatments, many physicians at the frontlines of the COVID-19 battle prescribed these drugs, resulting in a worldwide shortage. Conflicting clinical trial data have emerged since then regarding use of these antimalarial drugs in COVID-19 [1-7], some of which indicate a lack of benefit or even the potential for harm [6]. This underscores the need for emergency regulatory authorization of unproven treatments, if deemed necessary in a public health crisis, to be based first and foremost on robust evidence of safety. It is also important that the relevant agency issues a statement emphasizing the exploratory nature of the intervention and urgent need for robust clinical trial data to support ongoing use.",

Their repurposing for these challenging autoimmune diseases was facilitated by funding from pharmaceutical companies, which recouped their investment through patent-protected revenues until the drugs became available as generics.

Prescribing a drug off-label (ie, for a use other than what it was approved for) is legal in almost every country worldwide. However, if there is an unforeseen adverse outcome, the burden of liability shifts from the regulator or pharmaceutical company to the prescribing physician. Additionally, the burden of payment shifts from the insurer or other institutional health care payers to the patient. Nevertheless, when dealing with immediate and urgent health crises, whether at an individual or public level, real-world repurposing is frequently the only realistic solution.",

Although COVID-19 usually presents with respiratory symptoms, infection that spreads beyond the lung contributes significantly to the disease toll through uncontrolled outpouring of immune cells, disturbed clotting, multi-organ failure, and other life-threatening complications. There is extensive clinical support, backed by a solid mechanistic scientific rationale, underpinning the proposed drugs (Multimedia Appendix 1). Each was selected based on safety, affordability, and ability to target multiple aspects of the underlying disease processes that make COVID-19 so deadly. The proposed doses are those that have been shown to achieve the target physiological effects as demonstrated in the supporting references.",

A larger study recently launched in China examines dipyridamole in 460 patients with COVID-19 (ChiCTR2000030055). Beyond these antiviral effects, dipyridamole has shown anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, and vasodilatory activity [30-34], and is one component of a widely used anticoagulant (citrate-theophylline-adenosine-dipyridamole [CTAD]) [35-37]. Clinically, cardioprotective effects have been reported in patients with chronic heart failure [38], and improved renal function is documented in patients with chronic kidney disease, delaying risk of progression to dialysis and reducing mortality [39,40].",

Sildenafil has a wide range of anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, and vasodilatory actions across many body systems, with benefits reported in case studies of patients with type 2 diabetes [56,57] and hematological cancers [58]. Reported cardioprotective effects, stemming from improved pulmonary circulation as well as direct action on the myocardium [59], include improved cardiac contractility and reduced symptoms in patients with a range of cardiac disorders [60-62], with reduction in cardiovascular events and mortality in patients at high risk [63]. Studies demonstrating sildenafil\u2019s efficacy and tolerability in PAH continue to accrue, and a recent Cochrane review and meta-analysis concluded that patients with PAH who received PDE-5 inhibitors were significantly less likely to die in the short-term than those receiving a placebo [64]. Sildenafil may also reduce mortality in idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis [65], an interstitial lung disease with high mortality, and preliminary evidence suggests that this drug class is actively renoprotective [62,66]. Sildenafil is currently under investigation in a phase 3 trial in patients with COVID-19 (NCT04304313), which will help clarify its therapeutic potential.",
