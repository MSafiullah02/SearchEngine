The disease is named COVID-19 and the virus is termed SARS-CoV-2. This new virus spread from Wuhan to much of China in 30 days [4]. The United States of America [5], where the first seven cases were reported on January 20, 2020, reached over 300,000 by the 5th of April 2020. Most coronaviruses affect animals, but they can also be transmitted to humans because of their zoonotic nature. Severe acute respiratory syndrome Coronavirus (SARS-CoV) and the Middle East respiratory syndrome Coronavirus (MERS-CoV) have caused severe respiratory disease and death in humans [6]. The typical clinical features of COVID-19 include fever, cough, sore throat, headache, fatigue, muscle pain, and shortness of breath [7].",

Chest radiological imaging such as computed tomography (CT) and X-ray have vital roles in early diagnosis and treatment of this disease [8]. Due to the low RT-PCR sensitivity of 60%\u201370%, even if negative results are obtained, symptoms can be detected by examining radiological images of patients [9,10]. It is stated that CT is a sensitive method to detect COVID-19 pneumonia, and can be considered as a screening tool with RT-PRC [11]. CT findings are observed over a long interval after the onset of symptoms, and patients usually have a normal CT in the first 0\u20132 days [12]. In a study on lung CT of patients who survived COVID-19 pneumonia, the most significant lung disease is observed ten days after the onset of symptoms [13].",

            "text": "At the beginning of the pandemic, Chinese clinical centers had insufficient test kits, which are also producing a high rate of false-negative results, so doctors are encouraged to make a diagnosis only based on clinical and chest CT results [12,14]. CT is widely used for COVID-19 detection in countries such as Turkey, where a low number of test kits at onset of the pandemic were available. Researchers state that combining clinical image features with laboratory results may help in early detection of COVID-19 [6,11,[15], [16], [17]]. Radiologic images obtained from COVID-19 cases contain useful information for diagnostics. Some studies have encountered changes in chest X-ray and CT images before the beginning of COVID-19 symptoms [18]. Significant discoveries have been realized by investigators in imaging studies of COVID-19. Kong et al. [6] observed right infrahilar airspace opacities in a COVID-19 patient. Yoon et al. [19] reported that one in three patients studied had a single nodular opacity in the left lower lung region. In contrast, the other two had four and five irregular opacities in both lungs. Zhao et al. [16] not only found ground-glass opacities (GGO) or mixed GGO in most of the patients, but they also observed a consolidation, and vascular dilation in the lesion. Li and Xia [17] reported GGO and consolidation, interlobular septal thickening and air bronchogram sign, with or without vascular expansion, as common CT features of COVID-19 patients. Peripheral focal or multifocal GGO affecting both lungs in 50%\u201375% of patients is another observation [9]. Similarly, Zu et al. [8] and Chung et al. [6] discovered that 33% of chest CTs can have rounded lung opacities. In Fig. 1\n, chest X-ray images taken at days 1, 4, 5 and 7 for a 50-year-old COVID-19 patient with pneumonia are given, and explanations of these images are also provided [20].",

Deep learning, which is a popular research area of artificial intelligence (AI), enables the creation of end-to-end models to achieve promised results using input data, without the need for manual feature extraction [26,27]. Deep learning techniques have been successfully applied in many problems such as arrhythmia detection [[28], [29], [30]], skin cancer classification [31,32], breast cancer detection [33,34], brain disease classification [35], pneumonia detection from chest X-ray images [36], fundus image segmentation [37], and lung segmentation [38,39]. The COVID-19 epidemic's rapid rise has necessitated the need for expertise in this field. This has increased interest in developing the automated detection systems based on AI techniques. It is a challenging task to provide expert clinicians to every hospital due to the limited number of radiologists. Therefore, simple, accurate, and fast AI models may be helpful to overcome this problem and provide timely assistance to patients. Although radiologists play a key role due to their vast experience in this field, the AI technologies in radiology can be assistive to obtain accurate diagnosis [40]. Additionally, AI approaches can be useful in eliminating disadvantages such as insufficient number of available RT-PCR test kits, test costs, and waiting time of test results.",

The proposed model has an end-to-end architecture without using any feature extraction methods, and it requires raw chest X-ray images to return the diagnosis. This model is trained with 125 chest X-ray images, which are not in a regular form and were obtained hastily. Diagnostic tests performed after 5\u201313 days are found to be positive in recovered patients [52]. This crucial finding shows us that recovered patients may continue to spread the virus. Therefore, more accurate methods for the diagnosis is needed. One of the most important disadvantages of chest radiography analyses is an inability to detect the early stages of COVID-19, as they do not have sufficient sensitivity in GGO detection [8]. However, well-trained deep learning models can focus on points that are not noticeable to the human eye, and may serve to reverse this perception.",

Therefore, while designing the deep model used in this study, the Darknet-19 model [59] is chosen as the starting point. Darknet-19 is the classifier model that forms the basis of a real-time object detection system named YOLO (You only look once) [59]. This system has the state-of-the-art architecture designed for object detection. The DarkNet classifier is used on the basis of this successful architecture. We designed the DarkCovidNet architecture (available at https://github.com/muhammedtalo/COVID-19), inspired by the DarkNet architecture that has proven itself in deep learning, instead of building a model from scratch. We have used fewer layers and filters as compared to the original DarkNet architectures. We gradually increased the number of filters such as to 8, 16, 32. To better understand this new model, it is helpful to understand the basics of the Darknet-19, which consists of 19 convolutional layers and five pooling layers, using Maxpool. These layers are typical CNN layers with different filter numbers, sizes, and stride values. Let the letter C denote a convolutional layer, and M denote a Maxpool layer. As C\n1 is taken as the input layer, Darknet-19 has a layer layout as follows.C1-M1-C2-M2-C3-C4-C5-M3-C6-C7-C8-M4-C9-C10-C11-C12-C13-M5-C14-C15-C16-C17-C18-C19\n",

In Fig. 4, each DN (DarkNet) layer has one convolutional layer followed by BatchNorm, and LeakyReLU operations, while each 3 \u00d7 Conv layer has the same setup three times in successive form. The batch normalization operation is used to standardize the inputs, and this operation has other benefits, such as reducing training time and increasing stability of the model. LeakyReLU is a variation of the ReLU operation used to prevent dying neurons. Unlike ReLU or sigmoid activation functions, which have zero value in the negative part of their derivatives, LeakyReLU has a small epsilon value to overcome the dying neuron problem. Similar to the Darknet-19 model, the Maxpool method is used in all the pooling operations. Maxpool downsizes an input by taking the maximum of a region determined by its filter. When working with two classes, the proposed model performs the COVID-19 detection task. If three different classes of images are used in the input, the same model performs the classification task to determine the labels of the input chest X-ray images as COVID-19, Pneumonia, or No-Findings. Finally, the layer details and layer parameters of the model are given in Table 1\n. The developed deep learning model consists of 1,164,434 parameters.

It may significantly reduce the workload of clinicians and assist them to make an accurate diagnosis in their daily routine work. The proposed model can save time (the diagnostic process is fast); hence specialists can focus on more critical cases. In this work, we have shared the outputs of the model with expert radiologists to confirm model robustness. We shared the top prediction errors of the model and the actual labels of the X-ray dataset with radiologists. Additionally, we also used the Grad-CAM [61] heat map approach to visually depict decisions made by the deep model. The heatmap highlights important areas that the model emphasizes on the X-ray. In this way, we have ensured that the outcome of the model is approved by a radiologist.

Therefore, the model evaluated patients with COVID-19 as pneumonia. Since COVID-19 pneumonia is a subset of pneumonia diseases evaluated by the model, the diagnosis is correct, although the interpretation seems to be incorrect. Therefore, patients identified as COVID-19 are evaluated as pneumonia (see Fig. 10 (a)). For this reason, the success rate of the model in the multi-class classification problem is relatively low as compared to the binary class.-The model is sensitive in detecting pneumonia disease. Although the model can predict pneumonia positively and marked as no findings in the dataset, this patient has a mass (see Fig. 10 (b)).-The model made the incorrect predictions in poor quality X-ray imagery and in patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), in which the lung image is diffuse and much lung ventilation is lost (see Fig. 10 (c)).-The model is useful to detect COVID-19 with presence of a heat map in normal subjects. Its effectiveness diminishes in pneumonia and ARDS cases. The heat map showed a greater concentration area in the X-rays of patients with COVID-19 than the area in which the disease is not seen (see Fig. 11).-The model may be more useful evaluate the efficacy of treatment based on the heatmap.

Chest radiography can detect a few characteristic findings in the lung associated with COVID-19. Deep learning models are sensitive in detecting COVID-19 lung involvement and hence the diagnostic accuracy rate is high. During the evaluation of the model, X-ray radiographs of COVID-19 patients confirmed positive by the PCR Test are used. The model can easily detect GGO, consolidation areas, and nodular opacities, which are the pathognomic findings of patients for COVID-19 on X-ray radiography. In COVID-19, bilateral, lower lobe, and peripheral involvement is observed, and the proposed model can detect localization of the lesion. These models are particularly important in identifying early stages of COVID-19 patients. Early diagnosis of the disease is important to provide immediate treatment and to prevent disease transmission. The models can also play an indispensable role in patients lacking early symptoms. There is a margin of error in patients with diffuse late lung parenchyma and in patients with significantly reduced lung ventilation due to poor quality X-ray images. X-rays that are not of optimal quality are difficult to evaluate by radiologists. The clinical and radiological images of later-stage patients are well established and it is easier to detect the findings by experts. The role of deep learning models is more prominent in screening and diagnosis when the infection is at its early stages.",

In previous studies, common techniques such as VGG and ResNet are generally used. However, the proposed new model is based on the DarkNet method. In addition, an effective screening process is required to eliminate images that are not useful present in the database. Since COVID-19 is a new epidemic, fewer X-ray images are available for developing the automated diagnostic system. The main advantages of the model are as follows:-The model classified chest X-ray images without using a feature extraction technique.-It is an effective approach that can assist experts for diagnosis.-The heatmaps produced by the model are evaluated by an expert radiologist. The model focuses on localizing effective regions on chest X-ray images.\n",

They are widely used in health centers worldwide during the pandemic. The model has the ability to diagnose COVID-19 within seconds. CT is a costly process and not readily accessible as they are usually only located in larger health centers. In addition, when CT is compared to X-ray, the amount of radiation received by the patient is more. Hence, it is recommended to use a deep learning model with X-ray imagery, as it is more accessible with lower radiation dose as compared to CT. Patients diagnosed as COVID positive by the model can be directed to advanced centers for confirmation, followed by treatment without delay. In addition, patients who have been diagnosed negatively by the model can be prevented from undergoing PCR tests and occupying health centers unnecessarily.",
