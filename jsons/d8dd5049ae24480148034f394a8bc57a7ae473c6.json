These events originate in the lungs but may extend to other organs, as documented by reports that patients with severe COVID-19 often develop multiorgan damage, including cardiac injury and acute kidney injury (AKI). 2, 3 In a very recent published article, Cheng et al. 4 state that among 701 consecutive COVID-19 patients hospitalised in Wuhan, 44% had proteinuria and about 27% had hematuria on admission. After adjustment for age, sex, disease severity and leukocyte count, patients with elevated baseline serum creatinine or elevated baseline proteinuria had a 2-and 5-fold higher risk of in-hospital death, respectively, than COVID-19 patients with normal kidney parameters. 4 Another pre-print study, 5 reports that among 85 cases of COVID-19, 27% developed AKI.",

SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid (N) protein was identified in kidney tubules in 2 independent studies, 5, 6 and clusters of coronavirus particles were observed in tubular epithelium and podocytes, [6] [7] [8] suggesting that SARS-CoV-2 directly infects the kidney (Figure 1 ). 5 This hypothesis is consistent with the fact that angiotensinconverting enzyme 2 (ACE2) -the main SARS-CoV-2 receptor -is highly expressed in the kidneys. 9 Importantly, in the autopsies of COVID-19 patients, ACE2 expression was upregulated in proximal tubular cells and strong focal staining was also observed on glomerular parietal epithelial cells. 6 There are also non-viral causes of kidney damage in COVID-19 patients, including drugrelated nephropathy of antiviral compounds, poor blood oxygenation and plummeting blood pressure that is also favored by the massive release of cytokines in blood (Figure 1 ). 10 The pathophysiology of COVID-19-associated tissue injury is not well understood, but the therapeutic effect of steroids, used to block progression, indicate that it is not primarily mediated by viral infection, but rather the result of the inflammatory host immune response, which drives hypercytokinemia and aggressive inflammation. 3, 11 The complement system is the host immune system's first response to pathogens. However, unrestrained complement activation contributes to acute and chronic inflammation, intravascular coagulation and cell injury and ultimately leads to multiple organ failure and death. 12 In a pre-print manuscript that was recently published online, 13 an immunohistochemistry analysis of lung tissue from patients who died of COVID-19 revealed strong staining for the complement components mannose-binding lectin (MBL), C4, C3 and the terminal membrane attack complex C5b-9, in alveolar epithelial cells, as well as inflammatory cells, some pneumocytes, and exudates in alveolar spaces. In the same manuscript, the authors also described increased serum C5a levels in COVID-19 patients, particularly in severe cases. In another online report, 5 an analysis of autoptic kidney tissues from 6 patients revealed strong C5b-9 deposition on tubules in all six cases and low levels of glomerular C5b-9 deposits in two of these, demonstrating that viral infection induced complement activation in the kidney as well, which could contribute to tissue injury and organ dysfunction ( Figure 1 ).",

Following inoculation with influenza A viruses H1N1 or H9N2/G1, MBL ko mice developed less severe disease, as underlined by less weight loss and lower pro-inflammatory cytokine and chemokine production compared with wild-type mice, demonstrating that MBL could upregulate inflammatory responses that worsen tissue damage. 20 Both natural and induced antibodies form immune complexes with viral antigens that activate C1 and initiate complement activation via the classical pathway. This was associated with C3b deposition on the viral envelope that interferes with virus attachment to susceptible cells and favours the phagocytosis by macrophages. 21 The genetic C3, C4 or C1q deficiency in mice resulted in increased mortality following infection with West Nile Virus (WNV) and in impaired antiviral IgG response, whereas antibody response to WNV was normal in mice deficient for factor B or factor D, two components of the alternative complement pathway. 22 It has also been postulated that the classical pathway plays a pathogenic role in tissue injury. Patients with SARS-CoV infection in phase 2 or 3 of the disease develop autoantibodies against human pulmonary epithelial cells and endothelial cells, and these antibodies can mediate complement-dependent cytotoxicity. 23 This phenomenon may derive from cryptic autoantigens exposed on damaged cells or presented by phagocytes that infiltrated the area surrounding the lesion, and could cause further post-infectious cell damage through apoptosis and complement-mediated cytotoxicity.",

Treating mice infected with the highly pathogenetic H5N1 virus with an anti-C5a antibody immediately following the challenge significantly reduced neutrophil infiltration in the lungs, attenuated acute lung injury (ALI) and increased survival rates. 34 In mice, treatment with an anti-C5aR antibody prevented MERS-CoV-induced increase in proinflammatory cytokines IL-1\u03b2, TNF-\u03b1, INF-gamma and IL-12 in serum and decreased the expression of INF-gamma receptor and the infiltration of macrophages, neutrophils and lymphocytes in the lung tissue to a significant degree, compared with vehicle-treated mice, 29, 35 demonstrating that C5a-C5aR interaction mediates local and systemic cytokine release and inflammation following coronavirus infection. In the same model, C5aR blockade limited the thickening of alveolar septa and prevented the development of edema and hemorrhage in the interstitial space in the lungs. 29 An anti-human C5a antibody (IFX-1) injected i.v into African green monkeys infected with the avian influenza A virus H7N9 consistently reduced histopathological lung injury to a remarkable degree, including endothelial detachment and damage to the basement membrane, and decreased the number of macrophages and neutrophils infiltrating the lung. 36 The treatment also mitigated the intensity of systemic inflammatory reaction, as demonstrated by lower plasma levels of inflammatory cytokines and chemokines, compared with untreated monkeys. 36 The role that C5a plays in human lung disease induced by SARS-CoV-2 has been suggested by a preliminary pre-print report on two patients who received multiple injections of the C5a antibody BDB-001 in an open label two-cohort trial in patients with severe and critical COVID-19 from Hubei. 13 In both patients, clinical conditions improved within a few days, with the normalisation of body temperature, increased oxygenation index, decreased CRP and the alleviation of cough, dyspnea and oppression in chest.",

Fibrin thrombi of small arterial vessels were observed in postmortem lung tissue from 33/38 Italian patients, half of whom had >25% of tissue involvement, and was associated with high levels of D-dimer in the blood. 39 Congested and widened blood vessels of the alveolar septum, with infiltration of monocytes and lymphocytes within and around blood vessels and thrombi in the microvessels were described in the lungs of three deceased patients from China. Furthermore, damage and necrosis of parenchymal cells and thrombi in small vessels were observed in the heart, blood vessels, liver, kidney and other organs. 40 The involvement of microvascular thrombosis in the kidney has not been definitely established. In a recent renal histopathological analysis of autopsies of COVID-19 patients in China, few fibrin thrombi were identified in glomerular areas associated with severe endothelial injury. 6 Microvascular injury and thrombosis with vasculopathy in septal capillaries of the lungs and permeation by neutrophils and monocytes in the damaged capillaries were reported in histology examinations of five US patients. 41 Interestingly, the observations are reminiscent of the vasculitislike lesions reported in the autopsies of patients with the SARS-CoV infection in 2003, as evidenced by edema of perivascular tissue and vascular walls, with thrombosis, localised necrosis, and infiltration of lymphocytes and monocytes in many organs, including the heart, liver, kidney and the stroma of striated muscle. 42 Relevant to this point is a paper about a 6-month-old baby with COVID-19, who was diagnosed with and treated for Kawasaki disease, a rare form of acute vasculitis of childhood affecting vessels throughout the body. 43 Other children with COVID-19 and Kawasaki disease-like manifestations are being reported in press releases from clinicians in the UK, US and Italy.",

C5b-9 can also be a powerful platelet agonist by inducing the secretion of storage granules and the release of procoagulant platelet microparticles (Figure 3 ). 54 Studies done by our group on atypical hemolytic uremic syndrome (aHUS) and thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP) -rare thrombotic microangiopathies characterised by extensive formation of thrombi in the microcirculation of the kidney, brain and other organs -contributed to highlighting the role of C5 activation products in microvascular thrombosis. In an ex vivo test in which microvascular endothelial cells (HMEC) were incubated with serum from aHUS or TTP patients or healthy controls, aHUS or TTP serum, but not control serum, induced intense C5b-9 deposits. 55, 56 When the cell monolayer, pre-exposed to aHUS or TTP serum, was perfused in a flow-chamber with normal whole blood, massive thrombus formation occurred. 57 Thrombus formation was completely normalised by adding, to aHUS or TTP serum, the humanised monoclonal anti-C5 eculizumab that blocks C5 cleavage, thus preventing the formation of C5a and C5b-9. A C5aR antagonist significantly reduced but did not fully normalise the thrombus area induced by TTP serum, 57 demonstrating that both terminal complement products, C5a and C5b-9, play a role in the loss of endothelial anti-thrombogenic properties.",

Indeed, experimental models of AKI have shown that tubular epithelial cells are primary targets of C5b-9 that contributes to cell necrosis, exacerbates ATP depletion in hypoxic cells and triggers inflammatory cell adhesion. 64 In a rat model of ischemia/reperfusion-induced AKI, an anti-C5 antibody decreased tubular necrosis and improved the GFR. 65 Based on this background, we activated two compassionate use protocols for an expanded access programme to C5 blockade with eculizumab therapy in patients with mild/moderate (in need of high-flow nasal oxygenation) or advanced (in need of continuous positive airway pressure ventilation) COVID-19 pneumonia, with the objective of stopping complement-mediated lung damage and preventing thromboembolic events. In addition, three clinical trials have been registered for off-label compassionate use of eculizumab for the treatment of patients with COVID-19. [66] [67] [68] A preliminary report published recently describes four COVID-19 patients with pneumonia requiring oxygen supplementation who were treated off-label with eculizumab. 69 The inflammatory markers dropped after eculizumab and the patients recovered in a mean of 13 days. However, the clinical course of the patients is poorly described, and the study is limited by a lack of comparison with COVID-19 controls with the same disease severity and taking the same medications, including anticoagulant and antiviral therapies, hydroxychloroquine and antibiotics, which could have demonstrated the add-on value of eculizumab in clinical outcomes.",
