Therefore, our team recruited the potential TCM formulae (also known as Kampo) from these two books. Several herbs, which were believed to be beneficial for SARS by experienced TCM doctors were also recruited. In addition, a vegetable in Taiwan, China and Malaysia, the tender leaf of Toona sinensis Roem (also known as Cedrela sinensis, belongs to the family Meliacceae) (Fig. 1\n) was also recruited under the suggestion of botanic experts. These TCM products and plant extracts were then tested for the effectiveness against SARS-CoV in vitro.",

None of TCM formulae had evident effect against SARS-CoV. However, Both TSL-1 and TSL-1nm showed evident effect against SARS-CoV. The SI of TSL-1 was greater than 12 in regular condition and 17 after boiling of TSL-1. The SI of TSL-1nm was greater than 7 in regular condition and greater than 13 after boiling of TSL-1nm (Table 1\n). The mean SI was around 15 in TSL-1 and 10 in TSL-1nm.",

In 2002, it has been reported that the crude extract of Toona sinensis Roem leaf can induce apoptosis of A549 lung cancer cells (Chang et al., 2002). The effect to improve lipolysis of differentiated 3T3-L1 adipocyte was also noted (Yang et al., 2003). In addition, the aqueous extract of Toona sinensis Roem can exert antiproliferative action and growth inhibition on HL-60 cells through apoptosis induction (Yang et al., 2006). Recently, Toona sinensis Roem leaf extract was proved to alleviate hyperglycemia via altering adipose glucose transporter 4 (Wang et al., 2008). However, the potential of Toona sinensis Roem for inhibition of SARS-CoV has not been reported so far. To our knowledge, this is the first report to show extract from the tender leaf of Toona sinensis Roem against SARS-CoV.",
