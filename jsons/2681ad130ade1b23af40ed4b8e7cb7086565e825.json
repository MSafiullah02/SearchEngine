This algorithm could provide a valuable tool to communities, schools, hospitals and other institutions looking for a simple method to objectively define a period when, for example, enhanced patient contact precautions, empiric therapy, or other prevention measures should be implemented. The ALERT algorithm is a simple metric that can be easily operationalized to predict the onset of seasonal outbreaks of influenza and/or other respiratory infections. [1] It is not currently designed to generate predictions of case counts.",

This serves as the flu season trigger, signalling an increase in activity associated with influenza circulating in the community. To account for reporting delays and possible delays in implementation of any policies, the user may specify a lag period: a number of days between the reporting date associated with the trigger and the date the ALERT period should be put into effect. The ALERT period ends when the reported number of cases falls below the same threshold, after a minimum passage of eight weeks. (This grace period is chosen by default to be eight weeks but its duration can be modified by the user.) This does not preclude the use of ALERT to detect a second peak in case counts, as data could continue to be monitored after the cases fall below the given threshold.",

Seasons may be defined flexibly, starting at any point during a calendar year. This algorithm was used successfully in real-time for determining the starting time for a 12-week intervention during 5 different influenza seasons.

One way to insure against triggering too early and missing a season is to specify, a minimum ALERT duration time (e.g. 8 weeks). This prevents an ALERT period from being prematurely terminated by early season fluctuations around the trigger threshold. However, it also means that we are relying on the minimum duration time to help improve the performance of the algorithm. Eight weeks is a justifiable minimum time to allow a season to start to take off.",

This is what the dataset looks like.
