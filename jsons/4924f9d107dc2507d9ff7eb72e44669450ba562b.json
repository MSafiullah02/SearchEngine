In addition, businesses usually consider their goals (e.g., turnover or production volume) not so much as a target point but as lower limits of halfopen ranges, e.g., to achieve at least a certain turnover. Hence, a goal deviation only occurs when falling below these thresholds. In insurance research, such a situation is called loss or damage (Knight 1921) . Here, we follow this notion and understand risk as being the negative deviation from the expected value of a certain performance measure, resulting in negative consequences for the focal firm. Hence, risk is equated with the detrimental consequences of a supply chain disruption -the realized harm or loss.",

This holds also true for related concepts such as incident, accident, glitch, failure, hazard, crisis, or disturbance. Here, we define a supply chain disruption as the combination of (1) an unintended, anomalous event that materializes somewhere in the supply chain or the supply chain environment and (2) a consequential situation which significantly threatens the normal course of business operations of the affected firms in the supply chain. For the affected firms, it is an exceptional and anomalous situation in comparison to every-day business. There has been intensive research by organizational scientists on events that adversely affect organizations, how organizational crises emerge from those events, and how organizations react to them (Pearson and Clair 1998) . Several helpful insights can be derived from this research and transferred to the supply chain risk context. For instance, similarly to the triggering event of an organizational crisis, the triggering event of a supply chain disruption is \"identifiable according to place, time, and agents\" (Shrivastava et al. 1988, p. 288) . The disruption is associated with a certain probability of occurrence and characterized by its severity as well as direct and indirect effects (Kleindorfer and Saad 2005) . Since the resulting detriment is usually a function of time, supply chain disruptions involve time pressure, implying that decisions for mitigation must be made swiftly (Hermann 1963) .",

For instance, the financial default of a supplier and a natural disaster destroying production capacity are situations with completely different attributes and therefore entail different effects on the supply chain. Addressing this issue and attempting to differentiate supply chain risks from other business risks, many scholars have proposed classifications in the form of typologies and/or taxonomies of risks (e.g., Chopra and Sodhi 2004; Christopher and Peck 2004; Hallikas et al. 2004; J\u00fcttner 2005; J\u00fcttner et al. 2003; Spekman and Davis 2004; Svensson 2000) . The derived categories of supply chain disruptions are often labelled \"supply chain risk sources.\" As such, Svensson (2000) named two categories (quantitative and qualitative), J\u00fcttner (2005) delineated three categories (supply, demand, and environmental), and Chopra and Sodhi (2004) proposed nine categories (disruptions, delays, systems, forecast, intellectual property, procurement, receivables, inventory, and capacity). In the following, for brevity, we will call a negative deviation from the expected value of a performance measure for instance a \"supply side risk\" if the deviation results from a supply side (supply chain) disruption.",

Other factors intensifying the bullwhip effect are over-reactions, unnecessary interventions, second guessing, and mistrust (Christopher and Lee 2004) . Demand volatility still presents a major risk source for many firms.

The financial default of a supplier, such as a supplier going out of business, is a particular but common supply chain disruption that can have severe consequences for the buying firm.

Another type of disruption occurs when a supplier is vertically integrated by a direct competitor of the customer firm, forcing the termination of the relationship (Chopra and Sodhi 2004) . In cooperative settings, opportunistic behaviour from suppliers has also been reported in literature as a source of supply risk (Wagner and Hoegl 2007) .

In the current state of the world, terrorism is a threat to global supply chains that has to be considered (Sheffi 2005) . These attacks can impact supply chains either directly or indirectly. In addition, there are indirect consequences of terrorism that are not caused by an attack itself but by the reaction of governments and markets.

The overall objective of this process is to determine, implement, and monitor an optimal mix of measures to avoid, defer, reduce, or transfer all relevant risks. The determined mix is considered to be optimal if the remaining amount of risk is in line with the firm's risk preference and corporate strategy.

Risk avoidance is possible for many types of disruptions. For instance, switching from a financially instable supplier to more stable one reduces the risk of a sudden supplier default.

Thus, these measures aim at minimizing the level of damage in case of a risk event occurrence. In general, this can be achieved by seeking redundancy for activities or facilities which are particularly exposed to risk. Many of the risk handling activities proposed in the literature are rather effect-oriented than cause-oriented. In particular, buffering strategies are very prominent which aim to increase a company's tolerance to external resource shortage over a limited period of time. A usual approach in practice is to anticipate risk scenarios and to build slack (inventory, flexibility, or time buffers) into the supply chain in a way that the damage to the supply chain and the involved firms is limited in case of a materializing disruption. In this context, one often encounters the terms \"resilience\" (Sheffi 2005 ) as well as \"robustness\" (Christopher and Peck 2004, p. 2) .",

The risk bearing firm can build up financial reserves individually or it can try to transfer the risk to an insurance company that builds a collective reserve. Insurance companies offer many products pertaining to supply chain risks such as transportation insurances, inventory-related insurances (e.g., fire), or insurances against natural hazards (e.g., flooding). A rather new technique is the so-called Alternative Risk Transfer (ART) which offers a possibility to provide coverage for very specific risks or for risks where there is no insurance product available, catastrophe risks, for instance. Such catastrophe risks (e.g., gulf coast hurricanes) can be placed with investors by issuing corresponding catastrophe bonds or structuring derivative products (Lewis 2007) . Contrary to traditional insurance the risk is transferred to the capital markets (Lane 2003). Finally, \"business continuity plans\" (Gilbert and Gips 2000) or \"recovery plans\" have to be cited as important tools to ex-ante optimize the \"firefighting\" after a disruption.",

We conducted several qualitative interviews as well as a thorough literature review to determine the initial item pool. After reviewing this pool with several researchers and supply chain management executives, some items were dropped or reworded. The remaining items were incorporated into a questionnaire and pretested. In the first section of the final questionnaire, the respondents were presented a list of relevant types of supply chain disruptions. Among these were aspects like supplier quality problems, supplier defaults, or terror attacks. For each disruption type, the respondents were asked to score on a five-point Likert-scale how their business unit had been negatively affected during the last 3 years in total by each of this specific issue. The scale ranged from \"not at all\" to \"to a very large extent.\" The second part of the questionnaire consisted of a list of supply chain risk management measures. The respondents were asked to score the level of implementation of each risk management practices in their business unit on a five-point Likertscale ranging again from \"not at all\" to \"to a very large extent.\" Based on this questionnaire, data were collected through a cross-sectional survey administered in Germany in 2005 to a sample of 4,946 top-level executives in logistics and supply chain management. The mailing and two follow-ups generated 760 usable responses, yielding a relatively high response rate of about 15.4%, considering the time constraints of top-level executives (Tomaskovic-Devey et al. 1994) . Non-response bias was assessed on the notion that later respondents would be more like non-respondents (Armstrong and Overton 1977) .
