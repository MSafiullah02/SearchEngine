Increasing use of chemicals in various life activities, agriculture and food sectors, have resulted into various kind of negative effects on human health. There are well-known reports of treating various health elements using traditional practices, plant extracts and specific food types (Vyas et al., 2018) . Advances in analytical technology is one of the major breakthrough for determining key components of food and attracted economically sound consumers to eat food with better nutrient composition. It has resulted into development of numerous food products with targeted consumers of different age groups, health and economic status etc. Development in genome sequencing technologies and sequencing of human genome has provided enormous opportunities for study of gene-diet interaction. In this chapter, we have discussed about concept of personalized nutrition, factors contributing to this trend and related technological aspects in following sections.",

This fact suggests the personalization of dietary habits that may be more impactful in changing behavior and ultimate health outcomes (Ordovas et al., 2018) . Personalized nutrition is rather defined as an approach that counts on details of an individual characteristics to evolve a package of nutritional counsel, products, or services. Gibney et al. (2016) , explained it as a perspective \"assists individuals in achieving a lasting dietary behavior change that is beneficial for health\". The terms such as precision nutrition, nutrigenomics (Vyas et al., 2018) , personalized tailored nutrition and stratified nutrition partially imbricates with personalized nutrition. Some of the terms can be used synonymously as personalized nutrition and personalized tailored nutrition. Both the terms imply to convey suitable nutritional advice to respective individual. Similarly, when a well suited nutritional advice is delivered to respective group it is termed as stratified or tailored. Whereas nutrigenomics implicate characterization of gene products influenced by nutrient intake and their resulted metabolic consequences (Ordovas et al., 2018) . Zeisel (2020) , has recommended and justified the use of term \"precision nutrition\" rather than \"personalized nutrition\" because the concept has even greater potential to categorize the whole population in different groups based on biomarkers studies.",

People with special personal goals as for achieving wanted body shape or size, competitive sports and for dealing with preferences, also desire to get befitted by personalized nutrition (Pickering and Kiely, 2018) . In case of personalized nutrition, genotypic or phenotypic characteristics have been focal point of the most researchers and stakeholders. Deducible suggestion is that, the outcomes of personalization will be more effective with the diverse measurements of characteristics (Riedl et al., 2017) .

This being the fundamental step in the evolution of any new analytical methodology, research and development of new sample preparation procedures is the most attractive section. Sophisticated sample preparation techniques aims to decrease use of laboratory solvent and generation of hazardous waste material to minimize labor, time, and the cost per sample analyzed, along with improving the overall efficacy the analyte isolation. This involves the development and potential use of molecularly imprinted polymers in sample preparation (Lok and Son, 2009) , the utilization of monoliths in sample preparation and analysis (Samanidou and Karageorgou, 2011) , the application of immune affinity column clean-up techniques in food analysis (Senyuva and Gilbert, 2010) , the addition of solidphase micro extraction (SPME) techniques for quality characterization of various food products (Balasubramanian and Panigrahi, 2011) , the use of ultrasound-assisted extraction for estimation of contaminants in food (Tadeo et al., 2010) , and the application of liquid phase micro extraction in food analysis etc (Asensio-Ramos et al., 2009) . Presently, novel greener sample preparation methodologies are being developed; among them, supercritical fluid extraction (SFE) and subcritical water extraction (SWE) are more encouraging processes in food analysis (Aufartov\u00e1 et al., 2011) , and for attaining new ingredients of functional foods. The basis of these extraction techniques are the use of pressurized fluids which gives electivity, shorter extraction times, and environmentally friendly as well.",

The effect of food processing on degradation of plant DNA and PCR-based analysis of transgenic foods are also studied (Gryson, 2010) . b) Biosensors are regarded as analytical devices which are composed of a specific biologically recognized element e.g., enzymes, antibodies, and microbe, combined with a specific transducer (chemical or physical) that converts the chemical response into an electrical signal. Biosensor transduces continuous or semi-continuous electronic signals proportionate to an analyte or cluster of analytes. Biosensors have been routinely used to detect food components, preservatives, food colors and sweeteners, along with contamination of toxins, pesticides, antibiotics, hormones and microbial etc. Due to such advantages biosensors found a huge scope in food processing, and food quality certification. The recent development and application of electronic nose or electronic tongue that imprints a large impact on flavor analysis are the best examples of it. Application of biosensors is increasing tremendously by virtue of rapid response time, high precision, sensitivity, and the utilization in inline process monitoring or food manufacturing. c) The use of peptide nucleic acid (PNA)-based technologies for food authentication and analysis, the progression of noval immunoassay methodologies to analyze veterinary drug residues in food products and the characterization of plant food allergens are owing to the methodology development.",

There may be excess or deficiencies of nutrients in diet which may lead to eating disorders, obesity and chronic diseases like cardiovascular disease, hypertension, cancer, and diabetes mellitus. Various nutrient-deficiency based diseases are presented in the Table 1 below with the symptoms and respective nutrient rich diet. Chronic diseases progress over prolonged period of time and takes time to resolve properly. The relation between diet and chronic disease is intricate, since many diseases develop in years but identification of a specific dietary cause is utterly challenging. The conception of \"risk factors\" has been added to the public language, ever since, the landmark Framingham Heart Study which begun in 1948. This study reported for the first time in the early 1960s that cigarette smoking, high blood pressure and elevated blood cholesterol levels were predictors of one's tendency of dying by heart disease (Weininger, 2019) . Not all the people having a risk factor ultimately develop a particular disease; yet, the chances of developing the disease increases many folds when a known risk factor is present. Some of the major risk factors are diet, lack of physical activity and consumption of tobacco or alcohol; others include heredity, age and gender. Some modifiable risk factors are exposure to sunlight and other radiations, biological agents and chemical agents that may induce genetic mutations and have been correlated with increased risks of certain diseases, especially cancers (World Cancer Research Fund/American Institute for Cancer Research, 2007; Heianza and Qi, 2017) .",

In migration studies, nutrition is one of the important environmental and lifestyle factors studied; however identification of particular dietary component which affects the changing rates and progression of the disease has been more mysterious. It has been estimated by many cancer organizations around the world that 30-40% of cancer cases could be prevented by following proper dietary interventions. Several types of cancer including colorectal, prostate, uterine, pancreatic, and breast cancers have also been associated with obesity (Hruby et al., 2016) . A probable cause for this may be increased levels of estrogen, insulin and other related hormones that usually escort high body fat. High alcohol intake has also been implicated in the development and progression of different types of cancers, particularly of mouth, throat, liver, and esophagus (where it acts synergistically with tobacco) and possibly of breast, colon, and rectum.

This irregularity in nutritional uptake becomes one of the most prominent reasons of health related disorders such as obesity, cardiovascular problems, diabetes mellitus etc. and considered as major health concern for all age groups, globally. Recent studies revealed that apart from environmental factors, the interplay of various genes is responsible for these detrimental health issues. The elaborative research on various genome wide approaches including molecular genetics analysis, linkage analysis, polymorphisms, identification of qualitative trait loci (QTL) and genetic markers helped in unraveling the mystery of multiple gene interaction which resulted in multifactorial life-threatening diseases (Helali et al., 2013; Guasch-Ferr\u00e9 et al., 2018) . Overcome the consequences of such diseases, the study of detailed genetic basis and underlying role of genes in diseases is crucial (Ashley, 2016) . In this section, we will discuss how various gene-diet interactions and genetic susceptibility can lead to complex disorders along with their possible causes and treatment.",

            "text": "Obesity is a multifactorial disorder which is characterize as excessive accumulation of body fat, affecting normal physiological processes of body and might give rise to other serious diseases such as cardiovascular disorder, type 2 diabetes, chronic respiratory diseases, musculoskeletal problems, hormone related cancers, large-bowel cancer and gallbladder diseases (WHO, 2003; Gadde et al., 2018) . The environmental factors which cause obesity are obesogenic lifestyle, excessive calorie intake, poor physical activity which leads to imbalanced Basic Metabolic Index (BMI) (Shuldiner and Munir, 2003) . Moreover, studies suggested that genetic factors also play crucial role in enhancing individual's susceptibility to obesity, more than 200 genes have been identified by genetic mapping analysis that might contribute to obesity (Speakman, 2007) . Using genome-wide association studies (GWAS), obesity is characterized as polygenic as well as monogenic obesity. QTL approaches followed by position cloning on human chromosome detected several obesity prone genes such as chromosome 10p, 11q24, 16p, 18q21, 20q13, and Xq24 on various chromosomal regions. The investigation and comparison of these genes in obese and non-obese people suggested that obesity can be a polygenic trait (Chagnon et al., 2000a) . Trp64Arg b3-adrenoceptor (Walston et al., 1995) and Pro12Ala peroxisome activated Receptor g2 (PPAR g2) (Yen et al., 1997) , are two genetic variants which might have minor influence on obesity phenotype. Extensive study of single genes on animal models indicated the co-relation of monogenic obesity in humans. Among several hundred genes, most studied and common obesity related genes are leptin (LEP), leptin receptor (LEPR), agouti-related peptide (AgRP), tubby gene, POMC gene (Rankinen et al., 2006) . LEP gene encodes hormone leptin which is secreted by adipose tissues, it regulates the appetite and energy consumption of the body, hence significantly affect the fat mass ratio of the body (Farooqi et al., 2007) . The treatment of obese mouse with mutated recombinant leptin resulted in decreased appetite, controlled body weight with normal phenotypic characters (Iwaniec et al., 2007) . When the intracellular leptin signaling cascade has been studied, the structural similarity between leptin and cytokine was found and it was deduced that leptin might act by cytokine receptor. An intracellular protein, the suppressor of cytokine signaling-3 (Socs-3) which down-regulated the action of cytokine receptor, might mediates the inhibition of leptin signaling, hence causing leptin resistance (Kievit et al., 2006) . The rodent leptin receptor (LEPR) gene which is similar to human LEPR encodes 1164 amino acids long protein with 22 amino acid secretory signal sequence, transmembrane and cytoplasmic domain (Bouchard, 1995) . A splice-mutation in leptin receptor yielded truncated receptor without transmembrane and intracellular domains of receptor (Farooqi and O'Rahilly, 2006) . Obese people with such mutation showed controlled adiposity, establishing relationship between LEPR gene signaling and obesity (Farooqi et al., 2007) . POMC (Pro-opiomelanocortin) gene expression is associated with the expression of mRNA essential for active form leptin receptor and leptin hormone. Prohormone convertase 1 (PC-1) mediates the post-translational modification of POMC, yielding biologically active peptide. Mutation in gene encoding for PC-1 thus inhibits the cascade and found significant in controlling obesity (Chagnon et al., 2000b; Farooqi and O'Rahilly, 2006) .",

The individuals with little or no physical activity and improper BMI showed high expression of FTO gene. When the co-relation between diet and risk of obesity was studied, it was observed that excessive consumption of fried food and sugar with sedentary lifestyle, potentially enhances obese gene expression with high adiposity. But genetic susceptibility, risk of obesity can be controlled and the effect of FTO gene can be down regulated by healthy & monitored diet, lifestyle with high to moderate physical activity (Kilpel\u00e4inen et al., 2011; Qi et al., 2012 Qi et al., , 2014 .

Along with behavioral and metabolic risk factors, genetic predisposition is also associated with CVD. After extensive GWAS, chromosome 9p21 was identified as genomic loci for coronary heart disease (O'Donnell and Nabel, 2011) . Various gene-diet interactive studies concluded that controlled dietary patterns i.e. high intake of raw vegetables, fruits, nuts, green leafy vegetables and milk products with healthy life style can surpassed the genetic effects of chromosome 9p21 in CVD-associated genetic variants (Do et al., 2011) . MTHFR gene encodes 5-10 Methylene tetrahydrofolate reductase (MTHFR) which catalyzes the reduction of 5, 10 methylene tetrahydrofolate to 5-methyltetrahyrofolate and it is an important enzyme for folate and homocysteine metabolism (Song et al., 2018) . During the study of MTHFR polymorphism, the single base substitution of cytosine by thymine causes substitution of valine by alanine, due to which decreased enzyme activity resulted in high homocysteine concentration in plasma, which is further marked by increased risk of thrombosis and thereby high cardiovascular risk (Chen et al., 2016) . PPARs family (peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor) is one of the most relevant gene family studied for gene-diet interaction for CVD. PPARs are the transcription factors regulating gene expression by interacting with specific response elements (PPREs) in the promoter region Gearing et al., (1994) and control the adipocyte differentiation, fat accumulation, glucose and lipid metabolism (Latruffe and Vamecq, 1997) . Two years long nutritional study with Mediterranean diet and conventional low-fat diet in large group of patients revealed that Pro12Ala polymorphism of the PPAR-g2 gene which is associated with high adiposity and cardiovascular risk, can be effectively subsided by following Mediterranean diet and manifested by reduced waist circumference (Razquin et al., 2009) . Another apolipoprotein (APO-A and APO-E) gene family regulates the concentration of triglycerides, VLDL, HDL, LDL, lipid metabolism and thus plasma lipid concentration in the blood. The intake of PUFA along with other diet interventions reduces VLDL and triglyceride levels while enhancing HDL concentration in blood. The APO-A1 gene polymorphism study indicates the significance of APO-A variations to elucidate the atherogenic profile of the subject and could be significant in diagnosis and treatment of CVDs (Ordovas et al., 2002; Tortosa-Caparr\u00f3s et al., 2017) .",

            "text": "The Type II diabetes mellitus (T2DM) is another major disease affecting population globally and the genetic and environmental factors are closely related to obesity. GWAS showed that TCF7L2 (transcription factor 7-like 2 gene), Kir6.2 &SUR1 (pancreatic b-cell KATP channels two subunits), IRS1 (insulin receptor substrate 1), DHCR7 rs12785878 (7-dehydrocholesterol reductase) are few elaborately studied genes which causes genetic susceptibility to T2DM (Hani et al., 1998; Goldstein et al., 2000; Saxena et al., 2012) . Study of TCF7L2 gene locus give insight about its significant role in T2DM, as it involved in secretion of insulin in b-cells of pancreas. Polymorphism in this gene correlated with low insulin production, hence increasing the T2DM risk. Consumption of whole grain (high fiber content) with high physical activity suggested beneficial effect on diabetes risk, assumed to be improved activity of TCF7L2 gene (Fisher et al., 2008) . ATP-sensitive K \u00fe channels (KATP channels) of pancreatic b-cells are important to maintain insulin secretion, SNPs in ABCC8 and KCNJ11 genes, which encodes two subunits (Kir6.2 and SUR1) of KATP channels have been associated with defect in insulin secretion leading to T2DM (Hani et al., 1998; Seino, 1999; Barroso et al., 2003) . PTPN1 gene encodes protein tyrosine phosphatase-1B (PTP1B) which down regulates the insulin signaling pathway by specially dephosphorylating tyrosine residues from insulin receptor kinase activation domain along with IRS1. Genetic variants of mice with defective PTPN1 gene locus showed enhanced insulin sensitivity and controlled obesity (Elchebly et al., 1999) . Another study highlighted the role of vitamin-D in insulin and obesity resistance. Two years long analysis on large group of participants showed that vitamin-D metabolism-related variants of DHCR7 gene with high-protein diet might have improved insulin resistance (Qi et al., 2015a) . Several other significant genes involved in gene-diet interaction have been listed in the Table 2.  Table 2 : Genes involved in gene-diet interaction. On the basis of above discussion we can say significant data available from Human genome project helps us in understanding structure, function and organization of human genes. Moreover, the advances in technology for genome analysis such as genome wide association studies, single nucleotide polymorphism, genotyping, gene marker studies and high-throughput genetic sequencing methods, made understanding and analysis of various disease related genes accessible for scientific community. The valuable data generated from all these techniques helped in identification of polygenic diseases, their prevention, treatment and cure, ultimately improving human health (Calkin and Tontonoz, 2010; Ashley, 2016; McCarthy, 2017) .",

The term \"omics\" is collectively referred to the technologies used for analysis of structure, function, and intermolecular interactions of various biomolecules in biological samples (Coughlin, 2014) . These technologies are used in \"high-throughput\" leading to multiple measurements simultaneously and identification of global set of gene products i.e., expressed genes, proteins and metabolites in studied sample(s). The commonly used high-throughput \"omics\" measurements includes genomics, transcriptomics, proteomics, and metabolomics. The outcomes of these measurements are affected by the external stimuli including environmental factors (both macro and micro-environments), genetic makeup of individual, experimental conditions and nutritional status etc. Therefore, the developments in above high-throughput \"omics\" technologies provide numerous opportunities for understanding the effect of diet at molecular level and huge variability in responses. The technological innovation is required for enhancing the capacity and efficiency of diagnostics of various diseases, immunology, nutritional formulation in addition to determining the safety and quality of foods (Browdy et al., 2010) . As revealed from literature, importance and relevance of \"foodomics\" or \"omics\" technologies in food and nutrition has got a recent attention (Herrero et al., 2012; Ib\u00e1\u00f1ez et al., 2012; Castro-Puyana and Herrero, 2013; Cifuentes, 2013) .

Internationally, investments of over US$4 billion have been made by governments of more than 14 countries in recent years, for the establishments of genomic-medicine initiatives (Manolio et al., 2015) . Since 2013, the governments of at least 14 major countries have invested to address implementation barriers and transition testing from their centers of excellence to mainstream medical practice. Transcriptomics studies reveals expression status of particular gene(s) or complete set of expressed genes of an individual at a time (transcriptome) and its outcome is manly dependent on use of technologies such as real-time-PCR and robust DNA-microarrays. In addition, RNA sequencing (RNA seq) has emerged as a robust alternative for transcriptome analysis as it is covering larger spectrum of RNAs and providing more functional information (Bodian et al., 2019) . Transcriptomics analysis provides opportunities for study of mRNA expressed or changes in expression of gene(s) in experimental samples as consequences of changes in diet or other factors (Liu and Qian, 2011) . For example, transcript profiling has been extensively used to evaluate the possible effects of anthocyanins on obesity related gene expression in adipocytes (Tsuda et al., 2006) , biomarker identification (Pic\u00f3 et al., 2019) and also for designing precise mitigation strategies especially for ready-to-eat food products (Soni et al., 2011) .

The outcome of this technology is mainly dependent on use of analytical technique with high separation efficiency and reproducibility i.e. GC-MS, proton nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR), HPLC-TOF-MS (along with upgraded technology UPLC-TOF-MS). These are becoming less time consuming and opened numerous opportunities of screening for metabolites in food components, body fluids and tissues in situ and changes therein in response to effect of diet, environment or genetic factors (Herrero et al., 2012; Llorach et al., 2012) . Rimbach et al. (2008) , considered metabolomics as end point of human molecular analysis. Its applications to studies for dietary interventions allows a greater understanding of effect of individual's diet on undergoing metabolic changes, one's health and related disorders along with relationship between genotype and phenotype.

But recently, with the advent of -omic technologies, the aspects of nutritions have broadened and it now even investigates various health aspects of individual ingredients in diet, in view of their health promoting effects, performance optimization, and assessment of possible disease prevention. Personalized nutrition relates to all possible health benefits, prevention of the onset of disease and is analogous to personalized medicine by adapting suitable foods to individual specific needs. Modern nutrition research has build the foundation for understanding the variability in terms of preferences, requirements and responses to a diet at an individual level and may become an empirical tool for assessing personalized nutritional counseling for health maintenance and disease prevention (Kussmann, 2010) . Deciphering the molecular interplay between food and health requires the use of holistic approaches so that of important health aspects must not be compromised. Recent approaches utilized for investigating an individual's response to its diet include the use of -omics technologies viz., genomics, metabolomics and proteomics together with the systems biology approach (Hood et al., 2004; Qi, 2014) . These -omics technologies integrate and analyze the data generated during dietary intervention studies along with potential effects on personalized nutrition. There is need for a comprehensive understanding of the interrelationship between nutrition and corresponding health benefits apart from the knowledge of network dynamics in the context of diseased and pre-disease states (Verma et al., 2018) .",

            "text": "Nutriproteomics is still a nascent research area, which exploits the proteomic tools to characterize molecular and cellular changes in protein expression and their interaction with other nutrients as the bioavailability and functions of each nutrient including bioactive peptides and proteins can be influenced by the presence of other nutrients/compounds. Nutriproteomics may serve as a potential tool in personalized nutrition. Nutriproteomics may help in quantification and/or characterization of bioactive peptides and proteins derived from food apart from discovering the biomarkers for elucidating their mechanism of action and efficacy (Kussmann, 2010) . Endogenously expressed human proteins and peptides may also be used as biomarkers to monitor physiological responses at an individual level. Bioactive peptides and proteins derived from food in general exert multiple responses such as growth and homeostatic regulation and can even cause adverse allergic reactions in some cases (Sauer and Luge, 2015) . Proteomics is central to nutrigenomic research and describes how our genome expresses itself as a response to the diet. Proteomics in nutrition can identify and quantify bioactive proteins and peptides and also addresses their nutritional bioefficacy (Kussmann and Affolter, 2009 ). Application of proteomic techniques for determining food quality especially with respect to personalized nutrition is mainly done by analyzing the complete proteome or metabolome of foods food (Werf et al., 2001) Proteomics approach may even be used in the post-marketing surveillance of foods derived from genetically modified crops and may serve as an important tool in near future (Kuiper et al., 2001) , in identification of bioactive compounds in nutraceuticals and functional foods (Galvani et al., 2001) , apart from diagnosis and vaccine/drug development (Plowman et al., 2000) . Nutriproteomics may also be potentially used in medical and nutritional research for revolutionizing biomarker and drug development, nutraceutical discovery, biological process modeling, preclinical nutrition linking diet and diseases and structuring ways to a personalized nutrition. Though several challenges such as protein dynamics, analytical complexity, cost and resolution needs to be addressed, but still the scope of application of proteomics in personalized nutrition is rapidly expanding and promising new and holistic strategies for nutritional intervention may emerge in near future (Ganesh and Hettiarachchy, 2012) .",
