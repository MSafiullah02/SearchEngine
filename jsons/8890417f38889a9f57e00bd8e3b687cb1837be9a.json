Direct estimation of the basic reproductive number could be undertaken if secondary infections of individual infectives could be quantified.

This can be confirmed mathematically by comparing the roots of Equations (4) and (8) . The constant coefficient of the quadratic in Equation (8) is equal to the product of its roots, and, because R 0 is greater than one, its value is negative. The quadratic therefore has one negative and one positive root. The value of the quadratic is negative when r = 0 and positive when r = \u03b3 (R 0 \u2212 1) and so its positive root lies in the interval (0, \u03b3 (R 0 \u2212 1)). The growth rate for the SEIR model is lower than it was for the SIR model. This effect is illustrated in Fig. 1 , where the prevalence of infection seen in an SIR model outbreak (solid curve) is compared to that seen in the corresponding SEIR model (dotted curve). In both cases, the average infectious period is 5 days and R 0 is 5, and for the SEIR model there is a two day average duration of latency. At the initial time the entire population of one million people is taken to be susceptible except for a single infective individual. The latent period has a dramatic effect on the initial growth, and indeed on the entire timecourse, of the outbreak. (We remark that the non-exponential change in prevalence seen at the start of the outbreak in the SEIR model is the transient behavior mentioned above and arises from the second, negative, value for r in Equation 8). The inset (plotted on log-linear axes) focuses on the initial behavior of the two outbreaks, when the epidemics are well-described by linear models, and shows the slower initial growth rate of the SEIR outbreak. The average infectious period is taken to be D I = 5 days, R 0 is 5, and, for the SEIR model, the latent period has an average duration of D E = 2 days.

A mathematical trick [1, 10, 17] allows the inclusion of non-exponential distributions within the compartmental framework. The infective class can be subdivided into n stages, arranged in series. Newly infected individuals enter the first infective stage, pass through each in turn, and recover upon leaving the nth stage. It is assumed that progression between stages occurs at constant per-capita rate, leading to an exponential waiting time in each stage and allowing movement between stages to be described by a linear system of differential equations.

Here, we call p c the control fraction. (In the context of mass vaccination, p c is called the critical vaccination fraction.) As we have seen, use of SIR models underestimates the basic reproductive number and hence leads to lower estimates of p c compared to those obtained using SEIR models. This could be a serious problem as it leads to an overly optimistic prediction of the strength of control needed to curtail an outbreak: a control measure that, on the basis of the incorrect model, is predicted to succeed could, instead, be doomed to failure [21] . We first illustrate these results by providing a few examples using a growth rate and durations of latency and infectiousness based roughly on a SARS modeling study of Chowell et al. [8] . (The study of Chowell et al. accounted for treatment and isolation, using a more complex model than those employed here, so direct comparisons cannot be made.)
