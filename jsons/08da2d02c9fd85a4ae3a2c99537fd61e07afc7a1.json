Method: The molecular docking studies were carried out by using the Autodock Vina. The in silico ADMET and drug-likeness properties of the compounds were predicted from SwissADME server. Result: The molecular docking study of the 186 compounds with the therapeutic target proteins (Mpro, PLpro, RdRp, SGp and ACE2) of SARS-CoV-2 resulted 40 compounds that bind at the active site with dock score above -8.0 kcal/mol. Conclusion: Based on the in silico ADMET study and drug-likeness prediction of 40 compounds, we proposed petunidin, baicalein, cyanidin, 7-hydroxy-3',4'methylenedioxyflavan, quercetin and ellagic acid among the 186 biologically important phenylpropanoids and polyketides as potential lead compounds, which can further be investigated pharmacologically and clinically to formulate therapeutic approaches for the COVID-19.",

The COVID-19 disease caused by the virus strain of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) identified first in December 2019 at Wuhan, China. SARS-CoV-2, the single-stranded positive-sense RNA virus has beta-coronavirus genus with closely related genomic organization to SARS-CoV identified in 2003 [2] . The envelope of the spherical-shaped SARS-CoV-2 consists of structural proteins like membrane (M), envelope (E) and spike (S) proteins, where the club-shaped spike glycoprotein (SGp) interacts with the angiotensinconverting enzyme 2 (ACE2) of human cells and allows the SARS-CoV-2 virus to enter into the cells [3] . After entering cells, the viral replication and transcription is mediated with functional proteins like main protease (Mpro or 3CLpro), papain-like protease (PLpro), RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) and helicase [4] . After the publication of the genomic sequence and crystal structures of various proteins of SARS-CoV-2 like Mpro, PLpro, SGp, RdRp etc. [5] [6] [7] [8] , research on structure-based molecular docking, dynamic simulations and quantum mechanical optimizations are performed to discover appropriate inhibitors for SARS-CoV-2 from the available databases/library containing approved drugs and phytochemicals with medicinal importance [9] [10] . The computer based simulations and docking approaches are adopted to expedite the search to get target drugs/molecules from the library/databases that contained in lakhs, and also to minimize the experimental cost and time in developing appropriate drug/vaccine for COVID-19 [11] .",

These repurpose drugs showed some promising results, but required further clinical evidences to examine their safety and efficacy in the treatment of COVID-19 [15] [16] [17] . Therefore, the computational docking and simulations research are ongoing globally to formulate new and effective therapeutic approaches for COVID-19. As a part of our ongoing research to search potential structures from phytochemicals that can effectively bind at the active site of various therapeutic target proteins of SARS-CoV-2 [18] , we selected 186 phenylpropanoids and polyketides based phytochemicals for screening against the proteins 3CLpro, PLpro, SGp, RdRp and ACE2. The phenylpropanoids and polyketides are well known for diverse biological activities and pharmacological properties. Based on the in silico ADMET, druglikeness and dock score, the compounds petunidin, baicalein, cyanidin, hydroxy-3',4'methylenedioxyflavan, quercetin and ellagic acid among the 186 biologically important phenylpropanoids and polyketides were proposed as potential lead compounds, and their interactions with the target proteins were discussed.",

The structures were re-optimized by semiempirical PM6 method by using the computational code Gaussian 09W and converted to PDB file format [19] . The crystallography protein structure of Mpro (PDB ID: 6LU7), PLpro (PDB ID: 4MM3), RdRp (PDB ID: 6M71), SGp-RDB (PDB ID: 2GHV) and ACE2 (PDB ID: 6M17) were downloaded from the PDB database (www.rcsb.org). The fine structure of the proteins were refined using Swiss model online tools followed by analysed using the Ramachandran plot. The ligand and protein structures were prepared for docking by using the MGL tool. The molecular docking studies were carried out by using the Autodock Vina1.1.2 [20] . The docked structures were analysed using the visualization tool BIOVIA Discovery studio. The important pharmacokinetic properties and ADMET (absorption, distribution, metabolism, excretion and toxicity) properties of the compounds were screened using the online tool SwissADME 'http://www.swissadme.ch/index.php' and 'http://biosig.unimelb.edu.au/pkcsm/prediction'. Table S1 . All the screened compounds showed good dock score, and we found that total 49, 24, 32, 63 and 77 compounds showed more than -8.0 kcal/mol dock score with each of the proteins Mpro, PLpro, SGp, RdRp and ACE2, respectively. To search the potential compounds, we performed protein-ligand interaction study that showed maximum binding affinity and dock score above -8.0 kcal/mol, and filtered the compounds that bound to the active site of any of the therapeutic target proteins of SARS-CoV-2. The protein-ligand interaction study revealed that only 40 compounds are binding at the active site of the therapeutic target proteins of SARS-CoV-2 (Table S2) . These 40 compounds are considered for further screening by in silico ADMET study and drug-likeness prediction.",

The other compound baicalein also showed nearly same binding affinity to Chain A residues by forming hydrogen bonds to Thr6, Thr24, \u03c0-cation complex to His41 and unfavourable donor to Cys145 catalytic dyed residues (Fig.   S1 ). Other residues of target protein participate in forming non-covalent interactions are summarized in Table 1 . The petunidin and other anthocyanins synergistically shows carcinogenic effect. In compared to petunidin, the medicinal importance of baicalein is well known [24] . Baicalein shows anti-inflammatory and antitumor effects. It is used in Chinese traditional medicine for treating liver disorders. Also, baicalein acts as an anti-furin activity in CT-26 cells proliferation and migration resulting anti-cancerous properties [25] , which makes baicalein an important inhibitor as the SARS-CoV-2 spike glycoprotein contains a furin cleavage site [26] .

Among the 6 lead compounds, the petunidin and baicalein was proposed to inhibit the function of Mpro. The compounds cyanidin, 7-hydroxy-3',4'-methylenedioxyflavan, quercetin and ellagic acid were proposed for the target proteins PLpro, SGp-RBD, RdRp and ACE2, respectively. These lead compounds are dietary and known for diverse medicinal properties. Therefore, formulation of therapeutic approach for COVID-19 will be easier provided they found experimentally effective in inhibiting the SARS-CoV-2. In addition, it is important to mention here that whenever the phytochemicals are examined, the novel drug delivery systems should be adopted for effective release of the further for lead optimization to discovery novel drug for COVID-19.",

ACE2 (angiotensin-converting enzyme 2) ACE2 is a zinc associated metalloenzyme and carboxypeptidase which is located on the endothelial cells of different organs especially arteries, lungs, kidneys etc. [34]. It is a type 1 membrane protein where its enzymatically active domain is manifested on the surface of the cells of lungs and other tissues. The interactions of the spike glycoprotein of the coronavirus with this protein results in the endocytosis and translocation of enzyme and the virus, which in turn act as entry point for the SARS-CoV-2 virus. The extra structural domains of the ACE2 are classified into two sub domains that are being connected at the base and the hinge bending movement that opens up the active site. The site directed mutagenesis is used to study the role of different active site residues. Arg273 plays a key role in the process of substrate binding where as its replacement results in the abolishment of the enzymatic activity. However, the His505 and His345 are entailed in the process of catalysis, His345 acts as a hydrogen bond acceptor or receptor resulting in the formation of the tetrahedral peptide intermediate. ACE2 recognizes RBD with the protease domain of ACE2",

Ellagic acid is partially binding to the substrate binding pocket, the active site residues lies between 21-95, 335-400 and 501-527 amino acid residues. Ellagic acid is richly found in raspberries, blackberries, strawberries and other fruits and nuts. It is widely used as potent drug to treat cancers, bacterial and viral diseases[35].Isorhamnetin is a polyphenolic compound found in fruits, vegetables and medicinal plants. It is showing binding affinity to active site of ACE2 substrate binding domain with partial contact.
