One of the first studies that aimed to characterize GIS interoperability was by Bishr (1998) who has demonstrated the need for working on data that are scattered over sev-eral independent databases. This goal has been achieved and the internet has played the key role in connecting systems over a common network protocol. According to Erharuyi and Fairbairn (2003) , real-time ability to visualize map locations, determine the scale of emergency, identify and evacuate at-risk populations, and expedite and direct response efforts are key areas in which GIS interoperability is much needed. As a result, a great deal of interest towards disaster management applications using internet GIS is rapidly emerging. Advancements in internet technology, in the form of high speed broadband, have made GIS interoperability more effective and accessible. This paper will address issues related to GIS interoperability, and will examine the status of GIS interoperability in disaster management, with emphasis on specific Ontario municipalities (i.e., Toronto, Kitchener Waterloo and Dufferin County). The second part of this paper will present an example (i.e., a demonstration case study) that highlights benefits that GIS interoperability could bring to the disaster management community.",

The importance of this has made interoperability a central research and development initiative.

The distinction between data transfer and interoperability is very important. Table 1 summarizes the differences between interoperability and transfer. Table 1 .

The City of Toronto has a department that is involved with emergency mapping; this is known as the Department Emergency Mapping Services. It was formed in 1999 as a result of the amalgamation of the municipalities of Toronto, Scarborough, and North York into the Greater Toronto Area (GTA). The Emergency Mapping Services of the City of Toronto is working toward an advanced level of interoperability that integrates data, processing and se-mantics in both applications and services. Currently the department is using both desktop GIS and web-based GIS technologies for processing and coordinating disaster management activities. The staff of the mapping services department is comprised of over 180 personnel ranging in responsibility from technical to management roles. The Emergency Mapping Department is located in a three story facility. Surprisingly, the funding for this facility is estimated to be less than 1% of the total budget of the City of Toronto.",
