            "text": "Here we propose and implement a generalized mathematical model to find the time evolution of population in infectious diseases and apply the model to study the recent COVID-19 pandemic. Our model at the core is a non-local generalization of the widely used Kermack-McKendrick (KM) model where the susceptible (S) population evolves into two other categories, namely infectives (I) and removed (R) where R consists of cured (C) and dead (D) population. This is the wellknown SIR model in which we further divide both S and I into high and low risk categories. We first formulate a set of non-local dynamical equations for the time evolution of distinct population distributions under this categorization in an attempt to describe the general scenario of infectious disease progression. We then solve the non-linear coupled differential equations-(i) numerically by the method of propagation, and (ii) a more flexible and versatile cellular automata (CA) simulation which provides a coarse-grained description of the generalized non-local model. In order to account for multiple factors such as role of spreaders before containment, we introduce a time dependent rate which appears to be essential to explain the sudden spikes before the plateau observed in many cases (for example like China). We demonstrate how this generalized approach allows us to handle the effects of (i) time-dependence of the rate-constants of spread, (ii) different population density, (iii) the age ratio, (iv) quarantine, (v) lockdown, and (vi) social distancing. Our study allows us to make certain predictions regarding the nature of spread with respect to several external parameters, treated as control variables. The inherent demographic heterogeneities in a population distribution tend to become magnified in the disease prediction due to the non-linearity in the system of equations. Analysis of the model clearly shows that due to the strong heterogeneity in the epidemic process originating from the distribution of initial infectives, the theory must be local in character but at the same time connect to a global perspective.",

Hence, from the available data, if we are able to extract the said rates of conversion, we can predict the future scenario of the COVID-19 pandemic for different regions in the world. Let us take the example of India. The case in India was reported on 30 th January, 2020. From then, the count of infection has seen an exponential increase reaching 24,434 on 24 th April, 2020. The death toll has reached 780 the first one being reported on 12 th March (source: www.covid19india.org). However, the number of patients recovering also increases exponentially, although at a lower rate as compared to the infection. From the data we extract the rate constants as given in Table II . We use these values to estimate R 0 to be \u223c6. Nevertheless, the value of R 0 evolves over time as the people and government take protective measures. As mentioned above the span of the values of rate constants can depend on region, average age of population and other important factors. From Fig. 4 we can see that the behaviour of the evolution of S, I and R changes with the changing nature of the time-dependence of infection rate. Interestingly, with the periodic variation of R 0 we can see a bimodal nature in the I vs time plot. This mimics the data from China. The periodic variation in the rate might happen when after a certain time the preventive measures are relaxed.",

Under comparable set of parameters, we find similar patterns of temporal evolution of population from both the generalized SIR model and CA simulation. The striking similarity of the results obtained from the two formalisms helps in validation of our CA simulation protocol. The following sets of parameters (Tab. III) were used in each of the three simulations. Another important and relatively less discussed quantity is the fraction of new infection (I new ). In Fig. 5 we show the time evolution of total active infected population [I(t)] and newly infected population [I new (t)] for three different kinds of time dependent R 0 . These analyses show that the maxima in the new cases peak before the maxima of the total number of active infections. We observe a second peak in I new (t) when R 0 varied periodically with time. This can be attributed to the second pandemic wave. [39] One is free to incorporate other kinds of temporal variation of the rate constants to explain the date of a specific reigion.

It is clear that the fraction of infected population increases with increasing F 0 S . The time at which the infection becomes a maximum decreases with increasing F 0 S .

In Fig. 7 we perform similar analyses as those in Fig. 6 . We see that the infected peak height increases and shifts to lower values in the time axis in a non-linear fashion with increasing F 0 I .

This directly relates to the incubation period of the virus causing the disease. It should be noted that fatality rate and incubation period are two competing factors that determine the range of spread of a pandemic.

From our cellular automata simulations we quantify the importance of these two factors. Starting with the same population density, age distribution and recovery probability as mentioned in the previous section, a fraction (F Q ) of the susceptible part of the population is fixed in their positions throughout the simulation. This simulates the people who are quarantined or locked down in their homes. It is assumed that they do not go outside and has zero contact with infectives. Hence, they never get infected. These are immobile and remain healthy throughout the simulation. We take the value of P I to be 0.99 considering that the virus can spread widely. Taking the transmission probability (P T r ) to be 1 (time-independent), we vary the value of F Q from 0.0 to 1.0 to see the effect of quarantine on the state of the population.

We plot the respective saturation values, peak height and position as functions of F SD in Fig. 11 .",

One important difference is that the immunity or the probability of getting infected depends on several factors that can be identified. Clearly, the accumulation of data across countries has become more accessible to general public and scientists alike. Secondly, the presence of a large number of asymptotic carriers which pose a serious threat to other less fortunate. In addition, there are certain similarities across the countries, as there are differences. Many of the emerging patterns are yet to be understood. It appears that modelling needs to be more generalized than those usually employed. There is an urgent need for understanding the dependencies. The most common model used in modelling epidemics is the SIR model, already discussed here. We have discussed why this model might not be appropriate for the COVID-19 pandemic. In this work we have employed two generalized schemes to model COVID-19 pandemic: (i) a modified SIR model and (ii) a stochastic cellular automata simulations to understand the spatio-temporal evolution of a population undergoing a pandemic crisis.",

This in turn get translated to Similar dependence is also seen in the CA simulations where the transmission probabilities (P T r ) are made time dependent. When a pandemic starts in a region (country for example) the nature of the spread is often unknown. Hence a proper protocol to control the spread and make the citizens cautious takes time. For this reason, the rate of transmission is higher in the beginning. With progress of time, this rate decreases as people learn more about the safety protocols. Sometimes, the rate may show oscillatory behaviour because of the heterogeneity of the population. Hence, time-dependence of the rate of transmission is an important factor.",

The rate constants, which are the parameters in the SIR model, represent average rates involving several factors (as mentioned above) that affect the overall temporal evolution of the population. We include these factors as parameters in terms of probabilities in the CA simulations. This not only gives us a better understanding of the roles of these individual factors but also allow us a more microscopic view into the physical map of a region affected by the spread of an infectious disease. However, it should be noted that both the model and the simulation produce limited results because of the inherent inhomogeneous nature of any pandemic and the limited availability of data. The models can be applied to small local geographical regions. However, they may fail to predict the outcome in a global picture.",

Solution of SIR model with time-dependent rateWe numerically propagate and solve the SIR model [Eq.6-8] and obtain the time evolution of N S , N I , and N R[Fig. 4a, 4b and 4d]. We implement three different kinds of time dependence in R 0 so that it varies between 7.0 to 2.0 (i) exponentially decaying [Eq.11], (ii) a sigmoidal/logistic function[Eq.12], and (iii) periodic[Eq.  13].
