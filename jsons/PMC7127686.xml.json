            "text": "Coronaviruses (CoV) have long been recognized as causative agents of diseases that negatively impact production in livestock, poultry and companion animals (Holmes, 2003). Bovine coronavirus (BCoV) is classified in the Order Nidovirales, family Coronaviridae, subfamily Coronavirinae, genus Betacoronavirus, and species Betacoronavirus 1. It is prevalent worldwide and antibodies can be detected in the majority of cattle (Hasoksuz et al., 2008). Host-shifting events involving in cross species transmission in BCoV have been described in the past involving captive wild ruminants (Alekseev et al., 2008), dogs (Kaneshima et al., 2006) and humans (Holmes, 2003). Enteric infections associated with BCoV have been recognized in alpaca crias (Cebra et al., 2003) and has been detected in intestinal tissue from adult alpacas suffering hemorrhagic enteritis (Genova et al., 2008). This article reports the occurrence of a betacoronavirus similar to BCoV in fecal samples from 1 to 3 week old alpaca crias in the High Peruvian Andes, based on partial nucleotide sequencing of RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) gene.",
