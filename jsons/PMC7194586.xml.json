It raises a significant and worrying issue surrounding data integrity, particularly from randomised control trials. A careful and systematic analysis of 35 trials published by Badawy and Abu Hashim over a 10 year period indicates that their data was unlikely to have derived from real recruited patients.",

A common risk identification was when randomised control trial manuscripts were submitted to our Journal within days of completing recruitment. In some instances two papers from the same Institution were submitted to our Journal and by chance only it was identified that the same cohort of patients had been recruited in the same time period for the two trials. On occasion the ethics approval letter was post-dated after completion of the trial. Therefore, the identification of such risk papers was a chance finding and not necessarily identified by the peer review process.",

This may not be a unique issue restricted to our own specialty, as originally highlighted by Carlisle & Loadsman [1], or indeed in non-medical disciplines such as building engineering (Jorge De Brito, Editor-in-Chief, Journal Building Engineering, personal communication). Another way of identifying the scale of the problem might be to assess the number of authors who fail to comply to a request for their original data for IPD analysis [2].",

Such an approach means (permanently) quarantining fabricated data by the process of tombstoning suspicious papers, a process most of us are now akin to in the current COVID-19 pandemic. We should regard all fabricated data as virulent and fatal. This process can be long-winded and take months or years to complete, but does protect the integrity of future clinical guidelines. Is it not our duty to protect patients and therefore undertake such drastic measures against Publishers and COPE guidelines and restrictions?",
