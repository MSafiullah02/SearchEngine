            "text": "The use of multiplexed internal controls to monitor sample extraction and inhibition of reverse transcriptase-PCR (RT-PCR) is becoming more routine in clinical molecular virology testing, providing an increased confidence in negative patient results (Bustin and Mueller, 2005, Bustin and Nolan, 2004). An RNA internal control is preferred because DNA internal controls typically used for PCR fail to monitor the reverse transcription reaction. Endogenous and exogenous RNA internal controls are both co-extracted and co-amplified with the viral target and have been described previously (Espy et al., 2006, Niesters, 2002, Tong et al., 1999). Endogenous controls are usually mRNAs present in the patient sample, encoded by housekeeping genes and typically expressed at relatively uniform levels. Exogenous controls are usually introduced into the sample prior to extraction. When possible, an internal control is included at a uniform copy number in each reaction. While simple to achieve using an exogenous internal control, strictly regulating copy number is more difficult with an endogenous RNA since the expression of mRNAs can vary significantly between samples, even for housekeeping genes used commonly (Huggett et al., 2005).",

A \u2018competitive\u2019 internal control uses the same primers as the viral target sequence, but with an altered probe binding sequence. These controls most closely mimic amplification of the target sequence (i.e. similar PCR efficiencies), but can potentially compete with target amplification at low viral loads, decreasing assay sensitivity. Another limitation is that they normally require a different internal control for each assay. Finally, the process of generating a competitive internal control may be too complex for the typical clinical microbiology laboratory. A second approach or \u2018non-competitive\u2019 internal control uses a sequence entirely unrelated to the viral target, often either another RNA virus or an RNA transcript. However, transcripts suffer from the disadvantage of being vulnerable to degradation, a problem that viral particles are less sensitive to. Furthermore, amplification of a non-competitive internal control may not be an accurate reflection of target amplification. Nevertheless, this approach has been widely adopted, since in many laboratories its benefits outweigh the potential disadvantages.",

A quantitated internal control from a commercial vendor is an excellent solution for laboratories that either do not have the tools required to grow and quantitate virus, or do not find it cost effective. The potential to use a single internal control target for all RT-PCR reactions limits the number of different internal control designs necessary. This \u2018universal internal control\u2019 can be added to all samples prior to extraction and detected with a single set of primers and probe(s), irrespective of the virus ultimately being assayed.

Twenty-two respiratory samples (10 nasal swabs, 6 nasal washes, 2 BALs, 1 sputum and 3 of unknown respiratory source) that were presumed to be SARS negative, were extracted with IC and assayed. All samples were negative in the SARS assay, but a significant number of IC failures were observed (5/22 samples tested). These five samples were re-tested in duplicate, with the IC failing to amplify in two of the samples. Based on these results, the IC concentration was increased 5-fold, from 500 to 2500 copies per reaction. Eighteen of the SARS negative samples were repeated, with 2/18 failing to amplify the IC at this concentration, indicating some measure of inhibition. To determine the effect of this IC concentration on SARS target detection, the crossing thresholds for a series of SARS virus dilutions spanning three logs were compared, both with and without the IC, with no significant differences observed (Table 2\n). In addition, seven replicates of a sample near the limit of detection were tested (approximately three copies per reaction), both with and without IC amplification. In the SARS reaction alone, 7/7 replicates were detected, compared with 5/7 replicates in the multiplexed reaction (data not shown). It was concluded that this minor loss in sensitivity is an acceptable trade off for the benefits provided by the internal control. Each of the 22 SARS negative samples described above was spiked with inactivated SARS virus at a concentration of approximately 25 copies/reaction (about one log above the assay's limit of detection).

To investigate this observation further, crossing thresholds of SARS aRNA dilutions that had been stored at \u221220 \u00b0C for 5 weeks were compared with those generated using freshly diluted material. Over the period tested, the crossing threshold of a dilution containing 80 copies per reaction was delayed approximately 3 C\nts (from 32.2 up to 35.0), or a 7-fold decrease in detectable target.

Hymas et al., 2007) and another capable of detecting Flu A, Flu B and RSV in a multiplex reaction (manuscript in preparation). All these assays use the HCV aRNA internal control and target the same region within the ms2 coat protein gene, but have different primer and probe sequences. These design changes were necessary because the SARS assay uses TaqMan chemistry while the others listed above are hybridization probe assays. For all the assays, the aRNA is diluted in a BSA solution and lyophilized for enhanced long-term stability. The IC crossing thresholds of the negative control in the two Norovirus assays were examined to evaluate the stability of the aRNA over time. The average crossing thresholds during the first month of clinical testing (between January and February, 2006; n\n = 11) were compared with those observed approximately 8 months later (between September and October, 2006; n\n = 13) and no significant difference was detected over this time period (Table 3\n).

However, the development of reagents for RNA targets has lagged behind. In recent years, the aRNA phage packaging system has been applied to commercial assays for HIV and HCV (Forman and Valsamakis, 2004). In addition, many laboratory developed assays have been described that utilize aRNA technology for controls (Beld et al., 2004, Bressler and Nolte, 2004, Eisler et al., 2004). An obstacle to assaying RNA targets in routine clinical testing is developing stable internal control material. Common approaches to this problem have been the use of either in vitro generated RNA transcripts or cultured viral particles, each having limitations. While the use of cultured ms2 phage as an internal control has been described previously (Dreier et al., 2005, Dreier et al., 2006), commercially available products are often the first choice for clinical laboratories. This is the first report to describe targeting the ms2 sequence contained within an aRNA.",

            "text": "One advantage of the aRNA approach for internal controls over the use of transcripts is that they are resistant to the RNases often present in patient samples, while naked RNA transcripts are highly vulnerable. In addition, aRNAs mimic more closely true viral particles and therefore likely to be more sensitive to problems with viral decapsulation than would naked RNA transcripts. Besides their enhanced stability, aRNA particles are non-infectious, reducing the potential risk to lab workers. The aRNA is also non-replicative, reducing the risk of laboratory contamination relative to viable ms2 phage. Since this product is available commercially, it eliminates the need for culturing the virus and therefore is an approach more appropriate for laboratories lacking these resources. When using the HCV aRNA described above, quantitation of the internal control material is straightforward, because it can be measured with common quantitative HCV assays being performed in many clinical laboratories. Since these assays are typically calibrated against a WHO secondary standard (and indirectly, by the primary standard), this IC quantitation can potentially be determined with a high degree of accuracy. Quantitation of the aRNA is not only useful when determining initially the number of copies included per reaction, but can also be a useful tool for quality control. Stored aliquots of IC can be assayed on a regular basis as part of the laboratory's quality assurance program to ensure that the material is not degrading over time. Results presented here using the aRNA IC in a Norovirus assay indicate that this material is stable for at least 8 months when lyophilized. Finally, the use of a commercial product instead of material generated in the lab or obtained from patient sources provides a well-characterized sequence that is less likely to contain variations.",

However, as demonstrated in this study, an IC level that is set too low can result in an unacceptable level of IC failures. Since samples that are negative for both the target and IC must be repeated, significant levels of IC failure are unacceptable due to the associated increased costs.",
