This review intends to discuss the symptoms, prevention, and management carried out related to the coronavirus, while also providing the healthcare provider strategies used by different countries in combating the disease. Subject and methods This study was conducted over a period of 2 weeks where different sources were used to assess the ongoing situation regarding COVID-19. The data used in this study was verified and collected from authentic sources only. Results Results show that there is at present no definite cure for the disease and that prevention is the best possible defense at our disposal at the moment. Data reviewed suggests that social distancing and isolation is the best possible option at the moment. Conclusion This study provides an overview of the developments taking place in response to the pandemic. More research is required, especially in the treatment and prevention of the disease, so that we may progress towards finding a cure as well as creating a vaccine for the COVID-19.",

With ten genome sequences done of the COVID-19, it was found out that it was closely related (88%) to two bat-derived severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)like coronaviruses, bat-SL-CoVZC45 and bat-SL-CoVZXC21. It is to be noted that the results showed that COVID-19 is quite distinct from its previously sporadic versions, SARS-CoV (79%) and MERS-CoV (50%) (Lu et al. 2020) . These data point towards the possible suggestion of the bat being the original host while the animals in the wet markets of Wuhan proved to be the intermediate hosts (Lu et al. 2020) .",

This is followed by entry into the cell, which is accomplished by acid-dependent proteolytic cleavage of S protein followed by the fusion of viral and cellular membranes. As the virus enters the cytoplasm of the cell, the translation of the replicase gene from the virion genomic RNA takes place. RNA synthesis follows its translation and assembly. This includes the translation of the S, E, and M structural proteins (Fehr and Perlman 2015) . Following the interaction of M protein binding to the nucleocapsid in the endoplasmic reticulum, virion assembly is complete. This completed form then leaves the cell to continue its spread (Fehr and Perlman 2015) .",

The incubation period is between 3 and 7 days and up to 2 weeks. The R0 is 2.2, meaning each patient will infect two other uninfected people.

The respiratory tract specimens are then used to perform real time PCR that is primarily done to check for the two targets, ORF1ab and protein N. A positive for both confirms a case, while a positive of any of the two targets requires the procedure to be done again.

People are advised to practice social distancing, with many governments having announced lockdowns all over the world such as Italy, Spain, and Germany, etc. In this regard, Wuhan can be taken as a perfect example from where the COVID-19 started. Wuhan has been in lockdown since the mid of January but with no new cases reported for the week leading up to March 24, the government planned on lifting the lockdown from April 8th (Bloomberg 2020). China on January 23rd, stopped air and rail travel while restricting car transport in Wuhan. Large gatherings were banned with residents asked to stay in home. These also include, the cancellation of the 2020 Olympics Games in Tokyo, postponement of many sports events etc. Educational institutions, business of all sorts, government departments, etc. were closed. Such strategies on a massive level are being employed at other places as well, such as the lockdown in two provinces of Pakistan, China's immediate neighbor.",

Several approaches have been carried out using lopinavir/ritonavir, chloroquine, hydroxy chloroquine and alpha-interferon.
