Bats can host a range of zoonotic and potentially zoonotic pathogens. In addition to rabies (RABV) and other lyssaviruses (e.g. Kuzmin et al., 2008b; Streicker et al., 2010), bats have been identified as the likely reservoir for severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) coronavirus (CoV) (Li et al., 2005; Cheng et al., 2007; Vijaykrishna et al., 2007), Hendra (HeV) (Halpin et al., 2000), Nipah (NiV) (Chua et al., 2002; Hsu et al., 2004; Reynes et al., 2005), Ebola (EBOV) (Leroy et al., 2005) and Marburg (MARV) viruses (Monath, 1999; Peterson et al., 2004a, 2004b; Towner et al., 2007). Most recently, a new distinct lineage of influenza A virus has been discovered in little yellow\u2010shouldered bats (Sturnira lilium, family Phyllostomidae) in the Americas (Tong et al., 2012) and a range of paramyxoviruses in bats from four continents (Drexler et al., 2012). Given the potentially devastating effects of these emerging diseases on public health and wildlife conservation (e.g. EBOV and gorillas; Bermejo et al., 2006), it is crucial that we improve our understanding of how bat ecology may influence disease dynamics and their propensity to serve as reservoirs for emerging pathogens (Messenger et al., 2003; Calisher et al., 2006; Wong et al., 2007).",

            "text": "Ecological drivers of pathogen spillover and emergence in novel hosts, including humans, can be a complex mixture of processes (Lloyd\u2010Smith et al., 2005, 2009). Clearly, human activities that increase exposure to bats will increase the opportunity for infections to be transmitted between bats and humans or to intermediate hosts such as pets and livestock. However, our knowledge of how and why emerging pathogens spill over from bats is limited, and improved understanding of these processes will require cross\u2010disciplinary approaches. Traits of the pathogen and the human\u2013pathogen interactions at the cellular level, such as evolutionary mutation rates and receptor\u2010binding affinity, are important when trying to understand spillover and emergence (Moya et al., 2004; Pulliam, 2008; Pulliam and Dushoff, 2009). However, these traits are proximate causes, and the ultimate drivers of spillover and emergence are ecological (Lloyd\u2010Smith et al., 2009). Therefore, understanding host ecology and elements of the human\u2013animal interface are essential in the context of pathogen spillover events. For example, host population structure and seasonality may affect the dynamics, viral diversity and virulence of infection in the host population, which may in turn affect the risk of spillover (Boots et al., 2004; Turmelle and Olival, 2009). Attempts to understand how host ecology impacts the dynamics of infection are relatively few in wild animal populations and fewer still for bat populations, and attempts at understanding how infections themselves evolve to persist in wildlife hosts with different ecologies are rarer still. To understand the role of host ecology in disease dynamics, we recommend combining field and experimental methods iteratively to parameterize mechanistic models, as well as integrative modelling in a comparative context, between species, population cohorts and pathogens (Plowright et al., 2008a, 2008b; Plowright et al., 2011; George et al., 2011); important also in this context is the use of models to prioritize and plan field studies (Restif et al., in press). Only once host and pathogen ecologies are united, can reliable predictions be made regarding ecological drivers of spatiotemporal infection dynamics and spillover (Keeling and Rohani, 2008).",

There are several ways in which bats differ from other similarly sized mammals, including potential for rapid and widespread dispersal, highly gregarious social structures, long lifespans and high survival, with low fecundity (Calisher et al., 2006). The majority of the studies on bat infections to date have focused on bats and zoonotic viral infections, but the ecological generalities may be similar among bacterial (Kosoy et al., 2010; Bai et al., 2011) and fungal infections of bats (e.g. Histoplasma capsulatum, Geomyces destructans) (Taylor et al., 2005; Blehert et al., 2009; Frick et al., 2010; Foley et al., 2011; Puechmaille et al., 2011).

The influx of susceptible young is a crucial driver of infection dynamics (Anderson and May, 1979). However, the role and strength of different host reproduction strategies on disease dynamics are as yet unknown, and only rare examples exist in the literature. Simulations of spatial models of raccoon rabies in the USA, a relatively well\u2010studied system, suggest that increasing seasonality in births as latitude increases leads to increasingly asynchronous rabies dynamics (Duke\u2010Sylvester et al., 2011). Hosseini et al. (2004) were able to demonstrate that seasonal breeding of house finches (Carpodacus mexicanus), along with seasonal social aggregation and partial immunity, was key in explaining the specific semi\u2010annual pattern of prevalence seen in Mycoplasma gallisepticum conjunctivitis. Many bat species also show marked differences between the sexes in distribution and behaviour during the warmer months, including the use of torpor (discussed below) and degree of coloniality (Cryan et al., 2000; Senior et al., 2005; Weller et al., 2009). Sex differences in behaviour and distribution of bats during times of year when the potential for disease transmission is greatest may also have important implications for disease dynamics, although typically behaviour and population demographic data exist for only a single sex (Weller et al., 2009; O\u2019Shea et al., 2010; Kerth et al., 2011).",

Turmelle et al. (2010a) showed empirically contrasting temporal patterns of RABV exposure in Tadarida brasiliensis at different types of roosts during the reproduction season, which suggested increased RABV exposure after parturition in cave colonies. Specifically, cave colonies in this system are known to harbour up to a million individual bats (Betke et al., 2008), mostly reproductively active females, leading to a short window of time where population size doubles following parturition, and contact rates between adult and newborn bats are elevated during early lactation. Individual\u2010 and roost\u2010level variation in physiological stress was also demonstrated in this system (Allen et al., 2011), although direct impacts of stress on susceptibility or immune response of bats to RABV or other pathogen infections have not been well characterized to date (but see Smith, 1981).",

(2011) found that interaction between the timing of the annual birth pulse and the RABV incubation period (extending through torpor) was important for RABV perpetuation in the bat population. Host survival rates were important, particularly during hibernation when lower mortality rates facilitated host population persistence, as was the seasonal pulse of susceptible juveniles entering the population in summer (O\u2019Shea et al., 2010, 2011a, 2011b). Thus, George et al. (2011) were able to show that seasonality in both births and deaths were important factors in RABV persistence E. fuscus. Plowright et al. (2011) examined the transmission dynamics of HeV in Australian pteropid bats using a mathematical model parameterized with field and laboratory data. The authors speculated in models of HeV in Australia that it was population connectivity and immunity that played a key role in the infection dynamics, rather than a simple influx of na\u00efve young. It is noteworthy that incorporating waning maternal immunity into models describing HeV\u2013Pteropus interactions provided a better fit to the data, therefore demonstrating that not only does the influx of na\u00efve young affect disease dynamics, but that the rate of inflow of susceptible hosts is important in driving pathogen dynamics.",

This study also suggested that the breeding success of the colony was not affected by CoV or AstV and that these viruses had seemingly little pathogenic influence on bats, although the lack of individual tracking and follow\u2010up precludes conclusive evidence to support this idea. However, Drexler et al.

The majority of bats in temperate zones also cycle between summer maternity roosts and winter hibernacula, and population density, sex and species composition can vary widely between these two types of seasonal roosting aggregations. Indeed, the effects of often very different behaviours between male and female bats (Weller et al., 2009) and the role of increased contact during mating seasons have yet to be explored in relation to infection dynamics. Tropical, non\u2010hibernating bats may use migration and coloniality for other reasons, for example, to track the seasonal availability of fruit and flowers (Thomas, 1983; Richter and Cumming, 2006). As fission\u2013fusion social structures are increasingly being recognized in bats (Storz et al., 2001; Kerth et al., 2011), these may interact with other life history traits to have a profound impact on pathogen transmission rates and persistence.",

            "text": "Seasonal variation in the prevalence of infection is likely impacted by changes in density during migration or colony formation, which affect contact rates and thus disease dynamics (Altizer et al., 2011). Some of the clearest examples of how seasonality and \u2018coloniality\u2019 may affect and drive infection dynamics come from human systems. The episodic dynamics of measles epidemics in the absence of vaccination, for example, driven by school terms (Finkenstadt and Grenfell, 1998; Finkenstadt et al., 1998) or fluctuating agrarian systems (Ferrari et al., 2008; Bharti et al., 2011) suggest changes in contact rates of susceptible hosts may be key in driving infection dynamics. As mentioned, Hosseini et al. (2004) also demonstrated that seasonality in coloniality was important for predicting Mycoplasma dynamics in house finches. Although not zoonotic, in bat systems G. destructans dynamics and the current epidemic in North America appear to be especially driven by coloniality and migration (Frick et al., 2010). Comparative studies may help to elucidate the impact of variation in seasonal ecologies among or within species affected by the same species or variant of pathogen. For example, the seasonality in aggregation and population dynamics of big brown bats in relation to maintenance of RABV in temperate Colorado (George et al., 2011) could differ in warm temperate and tropical areas where the host species also occurs (Kurta and Baker, 1990; Turmelle et al., 2011).",

Decreased migration could give rise to more intense but shorter HeV outbreaks after local viral reintroduction. The mechanism proposed for such an increase in epidemic intensity was that decreased bat migratory behaviour could lead to a decline in transmission between colonies and, therefore, reduced inter\u2010colony exposures and resulting immunity within colonies. This proposed loss of immunity leads to increased epidemic size and more rapid fade\u2010out once infection is re\u2010introduced into a susceptible colony. Thus, reduced migration and population connectivity were suggested as a mechanism that could increase the amplitude of the seasonal outbreaks and increase the probability of spillover. This relationship may be relevant to a variety of bat\u2010associated pathogens, where hosts exist as a metapopulation and humans alter connectivity of populations.",

For tropical species, reliance on short\u2010term and shallow torpor to offset energy deficits is less well described and may be more prevalent than is currently appreciated (Coburn and Geiser, 1998; Stawski et al., 2009; Stawski and Geiser, 2010). The role of torpor in infection dynamics is largely unstudied (Bouma et al., 2010; Moore et al., 2011). Species of bats that differ in their use of migration also often differ in their use of torpor. Torpor typically reduces pathogen replication rates (Sulkin et al., 1960; Luis and Hudson, 2006) and hence lengthens incubation periods (Bouma et al., 2010) and prevents host contact; these in turn influence the seasonal force of infection (the rate at which susceptible individuals contract infection). Additionally, it likely provides an efficient mechanism for overwintering of some infections.",

(2011) found a clear indication for torpor being a key factor in allowing perpetuation of RABV through the hibernation period, through prolonged incubation period and reduced mortality; this enabled RABV infection to persist in the population until susceptible individuals from the annual birth pulse could become infected and continue the cycle. However, RABV is also capable of perpetuating in a variety of bat hosts that are not known to utilize torpor, and even the same host species under varied ecological circumstances (i.e. warmer tropical climates), which begs the question of which factors allow RABV to avoid population fade\u2010out under these circumstances (see Dimitrov et al., 2007, 2008).",

The causative psychrophilic (cold\u2010loving) fungus colonizes the skin causing devastating lesions by eroding, digesting and replacing living skin tissues with the large surface areas of bat wings being the primary target of infection (Cryan et al., 2010). Hibernation depresses all physiological processes, including immunological processes (Bouma et al., 2010), and thus during deep torpor G. destructans, which grows only at temperatures <20\u00b0C, is able to replicate more efficiently than would be possible in a bat that has aroused or does not utilize torpor to the same degree. Thus, although G. destructans may show the opposite temperature pattern of infection to RNA viruses, it emphasizes the potential importance of torpor on infection dynamics.",

However, some studies captured long\u2010term longitudinal data. Hayman et al. (2012a, 2012b) concurrently monitored each in Eidolon helvum African fruit bats, and George et al. (2011) and Plowright et al. (2011) synthesized demographic data with infection\u2010related data from field and laboratory studies to give insights into potential mechanisms that drive infection dynamics. Capture\u2013recapture data should be collected to allow estimation of both demographic parameters (O\u2019Shea et al., 2011a, 2011b; Papadatou et al., 2011; Hayman et al., 2012b), while age\u2010specific infection data are particularly useful because they allow such estimation of factors, such as force of infection (Hayman et al., 2012a). Similarly, host population genetic data can be informative to measure connectivity between bat populations, as has been done for NiV and HeV (Olival, 2008). Studies should also attempt to capture the seasonal variation, such as pre\u2010, during\u2010 and post\u2010parturition and migration or hibernation seasons, and consider the potential effects of often very different migratory behaviours between male and female bats of some species (Weller et al., 2009). In all cases, however, longitudinal sampling of individuals in experimental and/or captive studies may be required to interpret field\u2010related data. For example, Sulkin et al. (1960) demonstrated that torpor prevents viral replication for the duration of hibernation, and, along with describing antibody titre decays, Rahman et al. (2011) demonstrate that recrudescence of NiV may occur in bats, which may be used to interpret field data. Statistical and mechanistic models, such as susceptible\u2010infected\u2010recovered (SIR)\u2010based models (see Box 1), can then be used on these data to determine which factors best predict infection dynamics. Comparison of mechanistic models, using careful statistical approaches to determine model fitting (Restif et al., in press), may be required to ascertain whether seasonal birth pulses or changes in contact rates, modelled as step functions (e.g. Duke\u2010Sylvester et al., 2011) or seasonal forcing (e.g. Hosseini et al., 2004) for example, drive infection dynamics. Meta\u2010population models may be required to capture all aspects of the system (e.g. Plowright et al., 2011), but must also take into account what is observed in small isolated populations (Peel et al., 2012).",

This is hardly surprising given the complexities involved in understanding single pathogen\u2013single host dynamics. However, there are important studies that suggest both multihost and pathogen dynamics are important in other non\u2010bat systems, and empirical data that suggest these situations may occur in bat infection systems. Through analysis of time series data, Telfer et al. (2010) demonstrated statistically that in a parasite community, including a virus, protozoan and two bacteria, within individual field voles (Microtus agrestis), risk of infection was altered by concurrent infection to a greater extent than by age or season. Lello et al. (2004) demonstrated that, in a rabbit (Oryctolagus cuniculus) population, gut helminth community parasites either compete or exist in mutualistic relationships. Few studies have considered multiple infections in bats (Drexler et al., 2011). Muhldorfer et al. (2011) detected infections in 12% of 486 bats from 19 European bat species, detecting co\u2010infection with herpesviruses in five bats, but were unable to infer much from this study as it was based on opportunistic sampling.

            "text": "From a multihost community perspective, Davies and Pedersen (2008) found that host\u2010relatedness and geographical range overlap were significant predictors of pathogen sharing among primates. Some viruses, notably RABV, are promiscuous, infecting multiple host species. Streicker et al. (2010) demonstrated that although RABV variants predominantly circulate within single host species, they are able to spill over into other species. Similar to Davies and Pedersen (2008), Streicker et al. (2010) documented highly asymmetrical patterns of cross\u2010species RABV transmission in the North American bat fauna, with host\u2010relatedness and geographical range overlap being the strongest predictors of cross\u2010species transmission, thus also suggesting an important influence of host sympatry. Whether these factors affect cross\u2010species transmission of other lyssaviruses within Chiroptera, or from bats to other mammals, is not known, because isolations are often few and serological findings may be due to cross\u2010reactivity between related species or variants, complicating interpretation (e.g. Wright et al., 2010). European bat lyssaviruses 1 and 2 (EBLV\u20101, EBLV\u20102) appear to show a very narrow host range in Europe. EBLV\u20101 circulates in Serotine bats (Eptesicus serotinus) and EBLV\u20102 in Daubenton\u2019s bat (Myotis daubentonii); this host fidelity is, however, not complete, as the first isolation of EBLV\u20102 was from a Pond bat (Myotis dasycneme), and in Spain, EBLV\u20101 sequences have been recovered from several bat species (Serra\u2010Cobo et al., 2002; Amengual et al., 2007). The importance of cross\u2010species transmission events in seasonally changing communities may vary with respect to pathogen or variants of a pathogen, but is not really clear for any system. In some cases, infection cycles may be maintained in co\u2010roosting species without cross\u2010species transmission. For example, Kuzmin et al. (2011) discovered that Commerson\u2019s leaf\u2010nosed bat (Hipposideros commersoni) is a possible reservoir of Shimoni bat virus (SHIBV, a lyssavirus), while Egyptian fruit bats (Rousettus aegyptiacus) and Miniopterus spp. bats in the same caves were seropositive against Lagos bat virus (LBV) and West Caucasian bat virus (WCBV) (Kuzmin et al., 2008a, 2008b), thus suggesting that at least for these lyssaviruses, infections may circulate among specific host species and transmission may be minimal among sympatric bats. Moreover, Cui et al. (2007) reported clustering of CoV sequences from geographically separated Vespertilionid bats of the same species, even for co\u2010roosting bats. Coronaviruses from Rhinolophidae bats, however, did not share this feature and appear to have undergone a number of host shifts.",

Intrahost pathogen replication is generally very temperature\u2010dependent, and so seasonal torpor usually suspends it (Sadler and Enright, 1959; Sulkin et al., 1960; Luis and Hudson, 2006). Thus, species and sex differences in torpor behaviour may affect the coevolution of pathogen variants and their transmission rates and generation times (i.e. lineage birth and death processes). Boots et al. (2004) showed theoretically how large shifts in virulence may occur in pathogen populations. They modelled infection in long\u2010lived species that acquire immunity following infection, and as a result of bi\u2010stability in evolutionary dynamics caused by the host\u2019s local contact or social population structure, large shifts in virulence could be predicted (Boots et al., 2004). Furthermore, Boots and Sasaki (1999) demonstrated that greater potential for long\u2010distance spread of the pathogen can increase virulence by reducing local selective pressure on the pathogen by exhausting the supply of susceptible hosts from a population. More work, both theoretical and empirical, is required to understand these phenomena in natural host populations. Gandon (2004) used theoretical models to predict the effect of multiple hosts on infection virulence. Interestingly, Gandon\u2019s work predicts that if an infection adapts to the most abundant host, then it may well be maladapted to other, less frequent hosts, and this maladaptation may lead to avirulence or hypervirulence in the new or less common host. Thus, decreased inter\u2010species transmission leads to pathogen adaptation to a more abundant host species, whereas increased inter\u2010species transmission leads to more generalist virulence strategies. These theoretical findings may be especially interesting for studies of bats, because of the very large colony sizes that some bats can reach.",

            "text": "Despite these theoretical studies, there is currently little empirical evidence for bat host ecology affecting pathogen virulence. The best example comes from RABV, where up to 30 different lineages of bat RABV may exist in the United States (Messenger et al., 2002; Streicker et al., 2010), and it appears that different bats maintain host\u2010specific RABV variants within populations (Shankar et al., 2005; Streicker et al., 2010). Following the control of canine rabies, the majority of indigenously acquired human rabies infections in the United States are attributable to RABV variants associated with bats (Messenger et al., 2002, 2003). It is unclear whether this mortality from bat rabies is from unrecognized exposure (e.g. humans being bitten during sleep and so not obtaining post\u2010exposure prophylaxis) or is owing to differences in properties of RABV variants; however, some data are suggestive of the latter. Most human rabies deaths in the United States during the past decade are linked to variants associated with the silver\u2010haired bat (Lasionycteris noctivagans; almost exclusively this species in the western United States) and Perimyotis subflavus, the tricoloured bat (Krebs et al., 2000a, 2000b; Messenger et al., 2003; Franka et al., 2006). In most cases of human rabies associated with bat RABVs, there is no definitive bite history (Rupprecht et al., 2002). The high proportion (74%) of human rabies cases attributable to bat RABV variants cannot be explained by a higher frequency of exposure to these species, as they tend to be non\u2010synanthropic. Two hypotheses have been proposed to account for this phenomenon: 1) the RABV variants associated with L. noctivagans and P. subflavus are widespread among bat populations and moving through undetected host reservoirs; 2) these variants are more infectious than others. Streicker et al. (2010) provided evidence that neither variant dominates spillover infections into other bat hosts, as indicated by the relatively low proportion of cross\u2010species infections detected with these RABV variants. Concerning the latter hypothesis, laboratory studies suggested higher in vitro pathogenicity and neuroinvasiveness of the variant associated with L. noctivagans than in a variant isolated from carnivores (Morimoto et al., 1996; Dietzschold et al., 2000; Faber et al., 2004); however, further studies are required because of the uncertain host origin of one of the viruses isolated from a human case (I. Kuzmin, personal communication). However, studies have not adequately investigated comparative pathogenicity in vivo in bats relative to the diversity of bat RABV variants that persist naturally (but see Turmelle, 2009).",

Ecological strategies of tree bats differ from other bats in North America and likely drive RABV dynamics in unique ways. Although there were no dominant RABV variants, Streicker et al. (2010) show a propensity for tree bats to asymmetrically infect other bat hosts with RABV. RABV variants associated with tree bats are also among the most recent to emerge (Franka et al., 2006). The winter habits of L. noctivagans are poorly known, but intermittent torpor with frequent activity at lower latitudes is likely (Geluso, 2007). Females migrate to higher latitudes in North America during spring and summer while males tend to migrate shorter distances and occupy mountainous regions (Cryan, 2003), and small colonies of adult females and offspring are believed to form in summer (Parsons et al., 1986; Mattson et al., 1996; Betts, 1998). Almost nothing is known about male group sizes (but they are presumed to be solitary) or survival rates. However, L. noctivagans appears to be an ideal species to include in comparative studies to elucidate the effects of host ecology on pathogen virulence and test Boots and Sasaki\u2019s (1999) theoretical work. Virulence factors and life history traits should also be compared to P. subflavus, which has recently been described as a migratory species (Fraser et al., 2012) and whose RABV variant also causes a disproportionately large proportion of human RABV cases in the USA.",

However, to determine the importance of host ecological strategies in pathogen virulence, experimental infection studies are required (e.g. Halpin et al., 2011); measurement of pathogen virulence (e.g. mortality or morbidity rates in hosts) is required using isolates of pathogens from migratory and non\u2010migratory species and from those using torpor. This could be achieved using multiple isolates that are representative of the diversity bat RABV reservoirs. Ideally, results from one system (e.g. lyssaviruses) should be confirmed in others, such as the CoVs and AstVs that have been detected in bats.

The differences in pathogen infection strategies (e.g. mode of transmission and virulence) and pathogen variants associated with particular hosts may drive disease dynamics beyond differences in the ecology of hosts themselves. Hampson et al. (2009) found that no matter what density of dogs was involved in an outbreak, canine RABV epidemics always had an R\n0 (which is the mean number of infections caused by an infected individual in a susceptible population, Keeling and Rohani, 2008) of <2. Therefore, one might speculate that pathogen ecology drove RABV dynamics in dogs as much as host demography. Most emerging infections from bats are RNA viruses (Leroy et al., 2005; Li et al., 2005; Calisher et al., 2006; Towner et al., 2007). RNA viruses have a high capacity for mutation compared with DNA viruses due especially to the low proofreading ability of the RNA\u2010dependent RNA polymerase that controls replication (but see Firth et al., 2010). Therefore, mutations can appear and be fixed in a short period of time relative to the host\u2019s evolutionary time frame (Moya et al., 2004). Variation in virulence, infectivity and other important processes can therefore potentially be altered within a relatively short evolutionary timescale and change the infection dynamics. However, the pathogen\u2019s ecology must also balance factors that affect transmission, such as virulence, epidemiological \u2018burn\u2010out\u2019 and mechanisms for persistence in complex host populations (e.g. Pulliam et al., 2011).",

Evidence of differing virulence in humans exists for EBOV, with Reston and Cote d\u2019Ivoire ebolaviruses not known to have caused fatal human infections (for review, see Morikawa et al., 2007), whereas other EBOV viruses and MARV have case fatality rates up to 90%. However, the virulence of these viruses in bats (the putative reservoirs) is less well described, but may be low (Swanepoel et al., 1996; Leroy et al., 2005; Towner et al., 2007). Similarly, experimental studies of henipaviruses in bat hosts have shown that in laboratory situations these viruses do not exhibit high virulence in their putative reservoir hosts (Middleton et al., 2007; Williamson et al., 1998, Williamson et al., 2000; Halpin et al., 2011) in contrast to their impacts on other species.",

These groups of viruses also differ in modes of transmission, but both are likely transmitted through very close or direct contact of hosts. To understand infection emergence, it is necessary to understand the importance of how traits may differ between infections, with resultant differences in disease dynamics; these might then be predictable based on host and infection ecology.

Other than steps proposed earlier to fill these data gaps that exist for almost all bat systems, it is likely necessary that further studies of within\u2010host dynamics, and therefore experimental studies, are necessary to inform how pathogen ecology affects infection dynamics. Experimentally measuring pathogen shedding and transmission of infections with different ecological strategies in a single host may determine whether those with higher virulence (e.g. mortality or morbidity rates in hosts) have higher shedding, whereas those with lower virulence have lower shedding, but less fitness cost.

The insights into infectious disease dynamics that can be derived from integrative modelling studies can, however, be profound, and there is a real need for more of such efforts to be undertaken. Mechanistic models also have the advantage of suggesting critical data gaps. Integrative models, such as SEIR models (Box 1), can be used to test different hypotheses, based on the relative sensitivities of parameters in the models (e.g. Buhnerkempe et al., 2011; George et al., 2011). These models can be used to predict how the impact of host and infection characteristics varies among sexes, species and diseases. In addition, quantification of the impact of other ecological characteristics can be assessed (George et al., 2011), such as bat reproduction and survival (O\u2019Shea et al., 2004, 2010, 2011a, 2011b), or differences in seasonal prevalence among pathogen variants.

We have proposed elsewhere (Restif et al., in press) that for the most parsimonious study design, allowing integration of field and experimental data into models that test different hypotheses, a model\u2010guided fieldwork approach should be undertaken. Here, model structures based on an understanding of the biology of the host and the infectious agent are used to design field studies; this should force researchers to be explicit about what is known in the system. Simulations and sensitivity analyses can be used to test differing hypotheses and parameter sensitivities, which can help the interpretation of field and laboratory data and direct future empirical data collection.",

If so, this will provide a powerful insight into the drivers of infection dynamics, so general predictions regarding infection ecology and spillover can be made.",

The detection of infections with low prevalence, such as those caused by some RNA viruses, can be very difficult and may require non\u2010random sampling, very large sample sizes, specialized techniques or a combination of all three (e.g. Leroy et al., 2005; Kuzmin et al., 2008b). The detection of EBOV RNA in bats is one clear example (Leroy et al., 2005). It took decades to discover EBOV RNA in bats, despite intensive efforts and epidemiological and experimental evidence linking the infection to bats (Swanepoel et al., 1996; Monath, 1999; Pourrut et al., 2005), and to date, the viruses are yet to be isolated by cell culture from any bat. Furthermore, although bats were strongly implicated as reservoirs to SARS\u2010like CoVs and diverse lineages of CoVs have been detected from bats globally, to date there has been no CoV isolate from bats because of the non\u2010permissive nature of extant cell culture systems.",

(2011) studied a maternity colony of M. myotis bats in the attic of a private house in a suburban neighbourhood in Germany, during 2008, 2009 and 2010. This was an elegant study; however, it was only performed on a single maternity colony and only for a short period of each year; furthermore, samples and data were only available at the population scale. Similar population\u2010level studies have been reported for HeV and NiV in Australia and Thailand (Wacharapluesadee et al., 2010; Field et al., 2011). All three of these studies, however, captured seasonality in viral shedding. Case submission data have also been used to capture seasonality, such as for RABV submissions used by George et al. (2011); however, these data are biased (see Klug et al. 2011) and unlikely to be relevant for infections with low mortality in the host. Studies looking for individuals shedding infection have been less successful. For example, Hayman et al. (2012a) failed to detect lyssavirus RNA in oral swabs from 796 E. helvum bats sampled over four years. Despite seemingly large overall sample size, the individual sampling events were unlikely to detect low infection prevalence and were further reduced when the authors accounted for the testing process sensitivity. If detection of the infection can be difficult, determination of the mode of transmission, periods of infectiousness and rates of recovery can be even more challenging and often require experimental studies. However, experimental studies in bats, such as those with RABV and other lyssaviruses (Hughes et al., 2006; Franka et al., 2008; Kuzmin et al., 2008a; Turmelle et al., 2010b), EBOV (Swanepoel et al., 1996) and HeV (Williamson et al., 1998) can be very costly, usually involve small sample sizes and highlight the complexities of host response to infection (Franka et al., 2008; Turmelle et al., 2010b; Halpin et al., 2011). Additionally, measuring morbidity and mortality in animals experimentally infected with potentially highly pathogenic infection can raise difficult ethical questions. Although not without their own ethical issues, initially, standard mouse models may be instructive, because they are of known infection history, genetically homologous (thus reducing host heterogeneity that might obscure mechanistic trends), and there are a range of immune markers available that do not exist for bats; however, studies using mice will not address important questions on dynamics of infection in natural hosts. Further difficulties exist in testing some hypotheses, because though apparently widespread in bats, infection such as CoVs and AstV are yet to have been propagated in the laboratory.",

Determination of the true age of wild bats is also difficult once bats reach maturity, making life table analyses intractable (life table approaches can also have analytical shortcomings; Williams et al., 2002). Hayman et al.

Typically, adequate information only exists for parts of the year (one particular season; Hayman et al., 2012a, 2012b; Drexler et al., 2011) or one particular sex (Weller et al., 2009; Drexler et al., 2011). For example, information exists on summer colony sizes of E. fuscus and activity patterns of females, but not males; however, population genetic studies have shed some light on sex\u2010biased patterns of dispersal in this species (Nadin\u2010Davis et al., 2010; Turmelle et al., 2011). For other species, such as E. helvum, migration patterns are largely unknown, so information is only available from colonies that are conspicuous for parts of the year (Sorensen and Halberg, 2001; Richter and Cumming, 2006, 2008; Hayman et al., 2010, 2012a, 2012b). Studying non\u2010migratory colonies of some species may provide insight into the relative effects of migration and other ecological factors (Peel et al., 2012). However, group and population sizes themselves may be very difficult to determine (Kunz, 2003), and roosting dynamics may be hard to quantify. Individuals in large colonies are difficult to identify and count, and small colonies may be inconspicuous (Weller et al., 2009). Often, only roosting or foraging behaviour is known, and tracking over long distances requires more labour\u2010intensive methods, such as tagging with wing bands or following bats fitted with radio transmitters using fixed\u2010wing aircraft (Cryan and Diehl, 2009). Precise GPS or satellite tracking systems are currently too large for long\u2010distance tracking of all but the largest bat species (Smith et al., 2011), although these studies have shed light on movement of Pteropus in the context of NiV and HeV dynamics (Epstein et al., 2009; Breed et al., 2010; Smith et al., 2011). The use of infrared video cameras has recently been utilized to monitor roost entrances and count the number of bats that emerge each night and associated host thermal energetic profiles (Hristov et al., 2008; Reichard et al., 2010a, 2010b), however, these systems are costly and in their infancy with respect to general use.",

Thus, wider use of passive integrated responders (PIT; microchips) and readers (see O\u2019Shea et al., 2011a, 2011b) for marking bats and the use of telemetry will be necessary. Hayman et al.

Permissive bat cell lines (e.g. Crameri et al., 2009) may be necessary for isolation of viruses, and experimental studies are necessary to understand the within\u2010host dynamics and pathogenesis of infections in bats and modes of transmission. Highly variable serological responses have been observed among individual bats in experimental studies, meaning interpretation of results is not always straightforward (Turmelle et al., 2010b, Halpin et al., 2011). These experimental studies must be designed to better understand empirical field data (e.g. Sulkin et al., 1960). In particular, baseline estimates of antibody responses from naive bats (e.g. captive bred) are necessary to better interpret serological results from field studies (see Williamson et al., 1998, 2000; Turmelle et al., 2010b). Regarding bat immune responses, typically adaptive responses are measured because tools are available to measure antibody responses. However, substantial advancements in the understanding of bat infection ecology will be made once innate immune responses are understood. This is particularly important for infections such as CoV, filoviruses and henipaviruses, which apparently do not cause overt disease in bats. Cytokine expression profiles, for example, will provide a much deeper understanding of bat immune responses following infection (for an example of methods, see Sadeghi et al., 2011).",

Consideration of meta\u2010population dynamics and multispecies/pathogen models may be necessary to understand some systems; however, these models suffer from even greater issues relating to parameterization than single species\u2013single host models. For statistical analysis, use of Bayesian frameworks should be considered when some prior data or knowledge exists and/or sample sizes are small. Bayesian analysis is often better able to estimate parameters from small data sets than frequentist methods, plus have the flexibility to incorporate prior knowledge into parameter estimates (Colchero and Clark, 2012).
