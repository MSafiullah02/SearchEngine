Over the last two decades, three novel Betacoronaviruses, Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS)-CoV, Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS)-CoV and SARS-CoV2, have crossed the species barrier and caused significant outbreaks characterized by high case-fatality rates in humans [[2], [3], [4]] . The latest addition to human pathogenic coronaviruses (hCoVs) is SARS-CoV2, the cause of COVID-19. At the time of submission of this review SARS-CoV2 has infected over 2.6 million people worldwide and claimed 185.000 lives, threatening many more (https://gisanddata.maps.arcgis.com/apps/opsdashboard/index.html#/bda7594740fd40299423467b48e9ecf6). In the following, epidemiological and clinical features of COVID-19, pathophysiological mechanisms, and already available and future therapeutic options will be discussed based on limited evidence available, and extrapolation from related viral disease.",

They are part of a group of currently four known seasonal hCoVs (shCoV) that also includes HKU1-CoV and NL63-CoV, which were only discovered in 2005 [7,8]. All shCoVs are globally endemic and frequently cause common colds, accounting for 2-18% of all respiratory tract infections [[9], [10], [11], [12], [13]]. By their fourth birthday, 75% of children show antibodies directed against at least one of the shCoVs [14,15]. Anti-shCoVs antibodies provide some cross-immunity and antibody-mediated protection against infection by other species within the group [16]. While their overall pathogenic potential is comparatively low, in the immunocompromised, infants, the elderly and those with pre-existing pulmonary disorders, shCoVs can cause severe respiratory or sepsis-like presentations [[17], [18], [19], [20], [21]]. OC43 displays some neurotropism and can cause demyelination and CNS infections in vulnerable patient groups [22,23]. While estimates of their contribution to annual respiratory illness vary, shCoVs remain asymptomatic in approximately 50% of cases [[24], [25], [26]].",

Overall, 8096 probable cases caused 774 deaths, resulting in a mortality rate of 9.6% (https://www.who.int/csr/sars/en/). Mortality strongly correlated with age, approaching 7% for those younger, and 55% for those older than 60 years [28]. Health care workers in contact with SARS patients demonstrated a very low seroconversion rate of 2% in asymptomatic individuals. Less than 5% of all affected were children, and post-containment seroprevalence among children considered high-risk for significant exposure was extremely low. This suggests that subclinical SARS among children had not occurred [[29], [30], [31]]. Approximately 20% of SARS patients required intensive care support for acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), half of who died within the following 28 days [32].",

Common features included massive inflammatory cell infiltration of the lungs resulting in acute lung injury (ALI) and ARDS, highly elevated inflammatory markers in the serum, evidence of monocyte/macrophage activation, activated coagulation and pro-inflammatory cytokine and chemokine profiles [[33], [34], [35], [36], [37], [38]]. This soon led to the implication of the host response as an important factor in this fulminant disease process [38]. Animal models of SARS suggest that lung inflammation intensifies after viral clearance, peaking as late as 14 days after infection [39], and similar observations were made in human SARS patients. This suggests that clinical deterioration later in the disease course was likely not due to uncontrolled viral replication, but rather uncontrolled immune responses and associated damage [40,41].",

Infection of humans likely occurred through intermediate hosts, including dromedary camels (MERS), the masked palm civet (SARS) and the pangolin (SARS-CoV2) [61].

The virus membrane contains four structural components, the spike (S), envelope (E), membrane (M) and nucelocapsid (N) protein [56] (Fig. 1\n). For SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV2, the S protein is the primary determinant for host tropism and pathogenicity. It is the main target for neutralizing antibodies and therefore of great interest in terms of immunological response and vaccine design [64]. The spike structure is formed by homotrimers of S-glycoproteins, each of which consists of two subunits, whereby S1 forms the part involved in receptor recognition, and S2 is highly conserved, anchors the protein in the viral membrane and facilitates viral fusion [[65], [66], [67]]. S1 contains a hypervariable loop which differs greatly between betacoronaviruses on both size and sequence. Viral entry requires the proteolysis of the S protein in two locations, a process that utilizes host proteases, and results in irreversible conformational changes of the S protein [64,67]. Some anti-SARS-CoV antibodies in humans mimic receptor engagement, thus modeling conformational S protein changes upon antigen-antibody interaction [67]. The amino acid sequence of receptor binding sites of SARS-CoV2 is 74% homologous to that of SARS- CoV suggesting similar or even identical cell entry mechanisms for both viruses [68].",

High ACE2 expression is also observed on the intestinal epithelium [81]. Furthermore, ACE2 is expressed on cardiac cells and vascular endothelia, which may explain cardiovascular complications in some patients [53]. For SARS-CoV, infection of immune cells including monocytes/macrophages and T cells has been observed. It is not clear to date whether and to what extent SARS-CoV-2 can also infect these cell types. ACE2 is also, but at lower levels and not ubiquitously, expressed on monocytes and macrophages, so this may also provide an entry mechanism into immune cells for SARS-CoV-2. However, other receptors and/or phagocytosis of virus containing immune complexes may also be involved (Fig. 1B) [76,82,83].",

Expression of T1IFN and down-stream signals modulate cell responses and reprogram cells into an \u201canti-viral state\u201d, subsequently promoting infection control and pathogen clearance [85]. As a first step, immune cells sense viral infection through identification of virus derived pattern associated molecular patterns (PAMPs), such as viral RNA. These bind to and activate pattern recognition receptors (PRRs) in/on immune cells and result in immune cell activation (Fig. 2). RNAs viruses, such as SARS-CoV, SARS-CoV2 and MERS-CoV are detected by endosomal RNA PRRs, including Toll-like receptors (TLR-)3 and 7 and/or cytoplasmic RNA sensors, namely retinoic acid-inducible gene I (RIG-I) and melanoma differentiation-associated protein 5 (MDA5) (Fig. 2). Usually, TLR3/7 activation results in nuclear translocation of the transcription factors NF\u03baB and IRF3, while RIG-1/MDA5 activation result in activation of IRF3. In turn, this triggers increased expression of T1IFN (through IRF3) and other innate pro-inflammatory cytokines (IL-1, IL-6, TNF-\u03b1 through NF\u03baB) [76,86]. In this context, T1IFN and other innate pro-inflammatory cytokines promote their own expression through auto-amplification: T1IFN activate the IFN-\u03b1 receptor complex (IFNAR) which results in the phosphorylation/activation of STAT family transcription factors 1 and 2 (Fig. 2), while IL-1, IL-6, and TNF receptor activation feeds into pro-inflammatory cytokine expression though the transcription factor NF\u03baB (Fig. 2) [[85], [86], [87]]. Activation and priming of innate and adaptive immune responses should result in pathogen clearance and recovery.",

SARS-CoV has been shown to alter ubiquitination and degradation of RNA sensors (RIG-I and MDA5). It inhibits activation of mitochondrial antiviral-signaling protein (MAVS), which are essential for the activation and nuclear translocation of IRF3 in response to cytoplasmic RNA sensor activation. Furthermore, SARS-CoV, and likely SARS-CoV2, inhibit the TNF receptor-associated factors (TRAF) 3 and 6, which are central for the induction of IRF-3/7 in response to TLR3/7 and/or RIG-I and MDA-5 ligation as well as NF\u03baB signalling pathways (which are usually activated in response to TLR3/7 ligation or cytokine receptor signaling) [88]. Lastly, novel coronaviruses can counteract T1IFN signaling through inhibition of STAT family transcription factor phosphorylation [86]. Taken together, suppression of innate immune mechanisms in infected epithelial cells and, to some extent, infected monocytes/macrophages allow novel coronaviruses to proliferate without triggering the innate anti-viral response machinery of these cells.",

Three early studies from Wuhan linked cytopenia and/or significantly elevated inflammatory parameters with severe disease and unfavorable outcomes. One study, involving 99 patients reported neutrophilia (38%), lymphopenia (35%), and increased systemic inflammatory proteins (IL-6 in 52%, and CRP in 84%) as common symptoms in COVID-19 disease [72]. Another study involving 41 individuals, linked severe disease culminating in ICU admission and mortality, with neutrophilia and lymphopenia [4]. The third study reported significant leukopenia (11.8%), lymphopenia (77.6%), thrombopenia (41.2%), anemia (48.2%), hypofibrinogenemia (22.4%), and hypo-albuminemia (78.8%) in a cohort of 85 patients who died from COVID-19 [83,92]. These observations are in line with findings in severe or lethal cases of SARS and MERS, in which increased numbers of neutrophils and monocytes/macrophages are present in the airways [83,93]. Other groups reported severe clinical phenotypes and ICU dependency of patients to be associated with increased plasma levels of innate chemokines, specifically C-X-C motif chemokine 10 (CXCL10)/Interferon gamma-induced protein 10 (IP-10), chemokine (C-C motif) ligand 2 (CCL2)/monocyte chemoattractant protein 1 (MCP-1), Macrophage Inflammatory Protein (MIP-)1A/CCL3, and the pro-inflammatory cytokine TNF-\u03b1 [2]. This, indeed, is similar to the situation reported in SARS and MERS in which uncontrolled inflammation centrally contributes to poor outcomes [[94], [95], [96]].",

One possible explanation is the induction of endothelial and vascular cell damage and cell death as a result of viral replication. Virus-induced inflammatory cell death, including necrosis or pyroptosis result in pro-inflammatory cytokine expression, (uninfected) immune cell recruitment and activation [97]. Mice infected with SARS-CoV exhibit excessive T1IFN secretion from myeloid cells in infected tissues. Indeed, immune evasion through the suppression of anti-viral responses and T1IFN expression in respiratory epithelia results in high viral loads [38]. From this, it is hypothesized that (not infected) monocytes/macrophages and neutrophils recruited to the site of infection exhibit strong and poorly controlled inflammatory responses, resulting in tissue damage and systemic inflammation, both of which contribute to morbidity and mortality [53](Fig. 3\n).",

Indeed, adaptive immune cells, namely T lymphocytes, which are observed in lung tissue sections of COVID-19 patients with ARDS and/or cytokine storm, may drive inflammation at later disease stages. Similar mechanisms have been reported in influenza and other viral infections [104,105]. Overall, severely ill COVID-19 patients experiencing cytokine storm exhibit lymphopenia and sometimes atrophy of the lymphatic tissues, namely lymph nodes and spleen [51,106,107]. This is in line with reports in primary and secondary forms of Hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (HLH) and associated cytokine storm, which result in inflammatory cell death and hypo-cellularity of lymphatic organs [[108], [109], [110]].",

This is surprising as children are prone to viral infections including severe manifestations. More than 75% of children get exposed to seasonal coronaviruses before their 4th birthday and seroconverts. However, antibody titres wane over time, most obvious in those over 60 years [110]. This may reduce immune response to SARS-CoV2 in the elderly as (limited) cross-reactivity between anti-seasonal coronavirus and anti-SARS antibodies exists, but also contribute to increased inflammation and complications. Immunological recall effects exist as anti-seasonal coronavirus titres increase in sera of convalescent SARS patients [111] which may influence immune pathology. As mentioned above, antibody-bound virions can enter susceptible cells, such as macrophages through Fc\u03b3 receptor ligation in a process termed antibody-dependent enhancement (ADE) [112]. In other viral infections (e.g. Dengue fever), ADE allows immune cell infection and reduces type I IFN dependent antiviral responses while promoting pro-inflammatory IL-6 and TNF-\u03b1 expression [113,114]. Furthermore, massive recall antibody production in individuals with a history of exposure to seasonal coronaviruses but waning titres, such as the elderly, can result in immune complex deposition and promote inflammation and damage, including immune complex vasculitis [110].",

Individuals who received BCG vaccination produce increased levels of pro-inflammatory IL-1\u03b2 and TNF-\u03b1 in response to S. aureus or Candida spp., and BCG vaccinated infants exhibit reduced infection-related mortality [115]. However, heterologous immune responses to unrelated antigens may also contrite to inflammation-related complications. Frequently, adults exhibit memory T cells that are specific to antigens they were never exposed to, and cross-reactive memory T cells can narrow the T cell response by favoring \u201chigh affinity\u201d clones. Indeed, limited memory T cell repertoires are a feature of immune senescence and associated with disease progression and T cell mediated damage in other viral infections, such as virus hepatitis and infective mononucleosis [116].",

Variable ACE2 expression patterns affect disease susceptibility between tissues (e.g. respiratory epithelia vs immune cells), but potentially also between individuals (men vs women, children vs adults) thereby determining disease progression and outcomes. Recently, it has been suggested that ACE2 expression is highest in children and young women, that its expression decreases with age, and is lowest in individuals with chronic disease, including diabetes and hypertension, inversely correlating with risk for severe disease and unfavorable outcomes [118]. While ACE2 facilitates viral entry into cells, it also plays a role in controlling infection and inflammation. ACE2 is part of the ACE2/angiotensin- [[1], [2], [3], [4], [5], [6], [7]]/MAS system as it counteracts the pro-inflammatory effects of the angiotensin-2. It catalyzes angiotensin-2 processing into angiotensin-1-7, which counteracts vasoconstriction, modulates leukocyte migration, cytokine expression, and fibrogenic pathways [119]. Thus, ACE2 contributes to limiting tissue inflammation while favoring repair mechanisms. Furthermore, \u201chigh\u201c ACE2 expression may be of benefit as SARS-CoV2 virus particles may compete with angiotensin-2 for cell surface binding sites and cellular uptake. Thus, relatively increased ACE2 expression may explain why children and young adults, especially young women, are relatively protected from COVID19 and associated complications.",

A small French pilot study, randomizing 36 patients with COVID-19 suggested accelerated viral clearance in patients treated with a combination of hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin [126]. However, others have challenged results and found no benefit in either disease outcome or viral clearance [127] . Disappointingly, the largest (also retrospective) study to date assessing Hydroxychloroquine on its own or in combination with azithromycin found no benefit, but indeed an increased mortality risk among patients receiving hydroxychloroquine [128]. A study exploring chloroquine diphosphate in two dosing regimens was forced to terminate early for concerns over increased mortality in the high dose arm. The authors conclude that treatment with high dose chloroquine for 10 days is not sufficiently safe and should no longer be used in severe SARS-CoV2 patients [129].",

Alkalization of endosomes reduces proteolysis, chemotaxis, phagocytosis, receptor recycling, and interferes with processing of epitopes displayed by antigen-presenting cells [131]. This overall contributes to decreased production of IL-1, IL-6 and prostaglandins, and alters intracellular calcium and TLR dependent signaling. Furthermore, preventing the acidification of lysosomes, hydroxychloroquine impairs cellular autophagy, a critical step for innate and adaptive immunity activation [132]. Finally, hydroxychloroquine has antithrombotic effects, which may be beneficial in COVID-19, where inflammatory stimuli and endothelial injury activate coagulation and promote micro-thrombus formation [133,134].",

In addition to its antimicrobial properties, azithromycin is sometimes used for its immunomodulatory properties, especially in patients with chronic pulmonary disorders. Azithromycin polarizes macrophages towards an anti-inflammatory M2 phenotype, and inhibits pro-inflammatory STAT1 and NF\u03baB signaling pathways [139,140]. In the context of anti-inflammatory effects, it is of particular interest that azithromycin is used in patients requiring intensive care for non-COVID-19 related ARDS and is associated with a significant reduction in mortality and shorter time to extubation [[141], [142], [143]].",

It recruited almost 200 COVID-19 patients, randomized to either standard treatment or added LPV/r for 14 days. Whilst confirming safety of LPV/r use in COVID-19, no significant differences were seen between groups in relation to survival or time to recovery; thus leaving the authors question whether a combination of LPV/r with a nucleoside analogue, such as ribavirin, would have resulted in improved outcomes. Trials exploring the therapeutic potential for LPV/r are currentlyongoing (https://www.remapcap.org/coronavirus;\nhttps://www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/novel-coronavirus-2019/global-research-on-novel-coronavirus-2019-ncov/solidarity-clinical-trial-for-covid-19-treatments).",

            "text": "As ACE2 has been identified as a key molecule for cell invasion (see above), its therapeutic blockade to control disease and aid viral clearance has been suggested [158]. However, unselective ACE blockade with currently available agents may be problematic as it could alter angiotensin-1 through -7, which have anti-inflammatory and anti-fibrotic properties [159]. Indeed, depletion of ACE2 by SARS-CoV2 may potentially contribute to increased disease activity in critically ill COVID-19 patients. In animal studies, ACE2 protects from ARDS [[160], [161], [162]], while angiotensin II contributes to pulmonary pathology, including edema and fibrosis [163]. Thus, accumulation of angiotensin II in the absence of ACE2 may aggravate disease and organ damage. Consequently, ACE2 induction has recently been suggested for COVID-19 treatment [85,159,164,165] . However, effects of ACE2 may vary between tissues and environments. Intestinal epithelia produce much higher levels of ACE2 than bronchial epithelia which is notable as not all patients develop gastrointestinal symptoms and when they do, symptoms tend to be mild, and some patients remain SARS-CoV2 positive in stool samples long after respiratory specimen became negative [78,[166], [167], [168]] . Based on these observations, one could suggest that high-level ACE2 expression such as that seen in the intestine and in contrast to the respiratory tract, or in children and young people as compared to individuals at risk (the elderly, especially when obese or chronically ill), may protect from inflammation and tissue damage. However, additional factors, such as the immunological micro-environment or regionally variable microbiomes may significantly affect virus uptake, replication and/or clearance. Thus, the exact role(s) of ACE2 in the context of COVID-19 remains to be unveiled and may be complex.",

Main causes of death include ARDS and cytokine storm syndrome (also referred to as macrophage activation syndrome, MAS or secondary Hemophagocytic histiocytosis, HLH) [74,92,106,107]. Indeed, ARDS occurs in 50% of patients with cytokine storm syndrome [184]). Considering impressively rapid development of systemic and pulmonary inflammation in a subset of patients with COVID-19, early identification and control of derailed immune responses is of utmost importance. Based on data from Chinese cohorts, markers associated with cytokine storm in other conditions may be predictive of poor outcomes in COVID-19, which include leukopenia, lymphopenia, thrombopenia, hypoalbuminemia, significantly elevated CRP and IL-6, hyperfibringenemia, and prolongedthrombin time [74,185,186]. However, this needs to be tested prospectively, and other more sensitive and specific biomarker may be identified.",

Standard treatment in these conditions include high-dose corticosteroids (dexamethasone), the calcineurin inhibitor cyclosporine A, chemotherapy with etoposide, and ultimately stem cell transplantation [187]. While the underlying molecular causes of familial HLH are different to COVID-19 associated cytokine storm syndrome, clinical (fevers, organomegaly in some patients) and laboratory features (cytopenias, massively elevated inflammatory parameters including CRP, ESR and ferritin, hypalbuminemia, hyperfibrinogenaemia, etc.) and consequences (tissue and organ damage, death) overlap. Furthermore, based on observations in the H1N1 influenza pandemic in 2009, a significant proportion of individuals developing disease-associated secondary cytokine storm syndrome may have mutations in one or more genes associated with familial HLH (in H1N1 36% of fatalities were associated with mutations in genes associated with the perforin pathway [188].Thus, clinical management of COVID-19 associated cytokine storm syndrome may, to some extent, be informed by what we know from familial HLH. However, treatment of COVID-19 associated cytokine storm should be more targeted and not include cytotoxic drugs and/or stem cell transplantation, as it is secondary to an infection, which will hopefully be cleared.",

Instead, high-dose corticosteroids are associated with complications in other forms of ARDS, including avascular osteonecrosis [192]. Short courses of low- or medium-dose corticosteroids, however, have been suggested to be of benefit in a Chinese cohort of critically ill COVID-19 patients [193]. Taken together, the limited data on the efficacy and safety of corticosteroids in ARDS are anecdotal and not conclusive; controlled trials do not exist. As their use is associated with widely variable effects on pathogen clearance, and evidence for their efficacy is lacking, high-dose corticosteroids cannot be generally recommended for the treatment of COVID-19 [194], and the use of low dose regimens must be trialed in formal and controlled studies.",

As mentioned above, immune complexes containing viable virus may mediate infection, activate Fc\u03b3 receptors, and/or be deposited in tissues and organs, lastly resulting in pro-inflammatory responses [196]. Of note, ARDS and cytokine storm in SARS coincided with serum conversion in a majority of patients supporting these arguments. Furthermore, patients who ultimately died, seroconverted significantly earlier when compared to individuals who recovered from infection [40,197]. Based on these observations, IVIG may be of benefit to some patients by inhibiting Fc\u03b3 receptors and limiting antibody-dependent enhancement (discussed above). Furthermore, aforementioned \u201cclassical\u201d anti-inflammatory effects may limit systemic inflammation, and anti-pathogen properties may be supportive in cases with bacterial superinfection or in patients who previously cleared SARS-CoV2 and developed specific antibodies [186,198].",

JAKs are involved in cytokine receptor signaling, including (but not limited to) the IL-6 receptor, as well as type 1 and type 2 IFN receptors [91,207]. They mediate the phosphorylation of STAT family transcription factors which are, in turn, involved in pro-inflammatory cytokine expression. Thus, JAK inhibitors efficiently limit cytokine expression, and may aid in controlling cytokine storms [91]. However, JAKs are also centrally involved in controlling the expression of T1IFN, which plays a key role in limiting virus replication and initiating pathogen clearance [208]. At least in the initial stages of COVID-19 disease, when virus replication and infection may be limited to the epithelium, SARS-CoV2 likely limits T1IFN expression (see above). Therefore, additional inhibition of JAK through small molecules may be counterproductive as they further limit pathogen containment and clearance, and may cause unforeseeable complications. Thus, JAK inhibition may not be the most suitable \u201ctarget-directed\u201d treatment option in COVID-19 associated cytokine storm syndrome and/or ARDS. To our knowledge, at least two clinical trials are ongoing to test efficacy and safety of JAK inhibitors in severe COVID-19 (ChiCTR2000030170, ChiCTR2000029580).",

Of note, immune modulation or suppression was not identified as a risk factor for poor prognosis in China or Italy [186,210]. While this could generally be considered \u201cgood news\u201d, immune suppression and associated altered immune function may predispose patients to infection and potentially prolong virus spreading.

SARS-CoV2 has the capacity to escape innate immune responses, which allows the pathogen to produce large copy numbers in primarily infected tissues, usually airway epithelia. Through the infection of innate immune cells and/or the recruitment of uninfected cells from the circulation to the primary site of infection, massive immune reactions induce hyperinflammation that can result in a cytokine storm and life-threatening complications. We are only beginning to understand host factors, such as differential expression of cell surface proteins that may determine infection risk, disease presentation and outcomes.

While RNA viruses usually activate TLR3 and/or 7 in endosomes (b) and cytosolic RNA sensors RIG-I and MDA-5 (c), SARS-COV2 effectively suppresses the activation of TNF receptor-associated factors (TRAF) 3 and 6, thereby limiting activation of the transcription factors NF\u03baB and IRF3 and 7, thereby suppressing early pro-inflammatory responses through type I interferons (IFN) and pro-inflammatory effector cytokines IL-1, IL-6 and TNF-\u03b1 (red symbols). Furthermore, novel CoVs inhibit the activation of STAT transcription factors (d) in response to type I IFN receptor activation, which further limits antiviral response mechanisms. Altogether, this prohibits virus containment through activation of anti-viral programs and the recruitment of immune cells. B) Tissue monocytes/macrophages express ACE2 to a significantly lower extent, making infection through this route less likely (a). However, immune complexes consisting of ineffective antibodies against e.g. seasonal CoVs and virus particles may be taken up by macrophages through Fc\u03b3 receptors resulting in their infection (b). In a process referred to as antibody directed enhancement (ADE), virions inhibit type I IFN signaling in infected macrophages while allowing pro-inflammatory IL-1, IL-6 and TNF-\u03b1 expression, which may contribute to hyperinflammation and cytokine storm syndrome (c,d). Inhibited type 1 IFN signaling suppresses anti-viral programs, while increased IL-1, IL-6 and TNF-\u03b1 expression auto-amplifies itself through positive feedback loops (f).",

Virus particles may be caught and inactivated using antibodies from convalescent patients. Recombinant soluble ACE2 protein may bind SARS-CoV2 and/or mediate anti-inflammatory effects to prevent pulmonary damage and hyper-inflammation. (Hydroxy-)chloroquine, potentially in combination with azithromycin), can change the pH of endosomes and reduce virus entry and replication. Furthermore, both medications have immune-modulating effects that may control pro-inflammatory cytokine expression. Anti-viral treatment with protease inhibitors (lopinavir, ritonavir, etc.) and/or nucleoside analogues (remdesivir, etc.) can limit virus replication. As SARS-CoV2 suppresses antiviral cytokine production, virus clearance may also be supported by the substitution of type 1 interferons, which activate their cytokine receptor (IFNAR) and induce anti-viral cellular programs. Hyperinflammation and resulting tissue damage may be prevented through immune modulation. Blocking IL-1 signaling (e.g. through recombinant IL-1 receptor antagonist anakinra) or IL-6 signaling (e.g. through IL-6 receptor antibody tocilizumab) may limit further immune activation, tissue damage and cytokine storms. Additional, less specific effects may be mediated through corticosteroids, immunoglobulins, hydroxychloroquine and/or azithromycin.",
