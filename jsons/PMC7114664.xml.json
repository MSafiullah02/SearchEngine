One infection control trend trumped all others: Ebola (Figure 1, Figure 2\n). Whereas trends in Google searches may not necessarily correlate with trends in the infection prevention and control literature, in this case it is true that the outbreak of Ebola in West Africa has prompted a lot of publications in the literature \u2013 as well as consuming an awful lot of professional time for all who are connected with hospital infection prevention and control! Aside from Ebola, other trends in the infection prevention and control literature covered in this article include Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV), universal versus targeted interventions, faecal microbiota transplantation, whole genome sequencing, carbapenem-resistant Enterobacteriaceae (CRE), and some aspects of environmental science. Finally, I attempt to predict some of the trends in the infection prevention and control literature between now and the next HIS conference in 2016.",

Recent data indicate that small droplet nuclei may be emitted most of the time by influenza-infected patients, which argues for airborne precautions for MERS-CoV.6 A hospital outbreak in Jeddah in Saudi Arabia put the world on red alert in preparation for a pandemic, but that outbreak was contained and few cases are being reported currently.",

Furthermore, the three secondary transmissions that have occurred from the 13 cases cared for outside of West Africa to date (two in the USA and one in Spain) have pushed the Ebola crisis to the top of the agenda of many hospitals around the world. This has led to a degree of politicization, where regional and national decisions are made for political reasons rather than based on evidence, resulting in measures such as mandatory quarantine, airport screening, and immigration bans.7, 8\n",

It is worth noting, in passing, that this is not a truly universal approach since it is applied to a targeted population! The studies are impressive, especially in terms of design and to a lesser degree in terms of impact (Table I\n).22, 23, 24, 25 Similarly, the use of antibiotics for selective digestive decontamination (SDD) or selective oral decontamination (SOD) has been advocated for all ICU patients. Again, the study design and impact are impressive, with reduced transmission and reduced mortality (Table II\n).26, 27, 28, 29 However, indiscriminate use of biocides (such as chlorhexidine) and especially antibiotics is not without \u2018collateral damage\u2019.30 Several studies have reported increased antibiotic resistance associated with SOD and SDD, and other studies have reported reduced bacterial susceptibility associated with universal use of chlorhexidine.28, 31, 32, 33, 34 So we need to consider carefully the downside before wholeheartedly adopting universal decolonization.",

Furthermore, compliance with glove and gowning was high in the study (85%) whereas another study monitoring glove and gown use in the real world recorded much lower compliance (29%).36 Compliance with correct use of gloves and gowns fell as the proportion of patients on contact precautions increased.36 Also, the \u2018over-use\u2019 of gloves can result in unexpected risks, for example, wearing the same pair of gloves for too long.37 So there is unlikely to be a rush of hospitals implementing universal glove and gown policies.",

It therefore seems that FMT will soon become the standard of care for recurrent CDI. However, FMT as it stands is currently crude, in every sense, involving an infusion of donor stool. Another option is an oral dose of donor stool in carefully developed capsules, known colloquially as \u2018crapsules\u2019, which is as effective as a duodenal infusion.51 Finally, we are moving ever closer to a \u2018synthetic\u2019 FMT, using a carefully configured live bacterial cocktail.52\n",

For example, there has been a sharp increase in CRE in Italy since 2009, and one recent study reported a high level of colistin resistance (43% of 191 CRE isolates from 21 laboratories across Italy).60 There has been a progressive increase in CRE in the USA, with the rate of carbapenem resistance in Klebsiella species increasing from <2% in 2001 to >10% in 2011 (Figure 5\n).61 Furthermore, there have been some shocking reports from some US regions. For example, \u223c30% of patients in Chicago long-term acute care hospitals carried CRE in a point prevalence survey, and the rate in individual facilities ranged from \u223c10% to almost 60%.62\n",

The key finding is that improvements in hand hygiene compliance are more or less twice as effective in preventing the transmission of MDR Acinetobacter baumannii, MRSA or VRE, i.e. a 20% improvement in terminal cleaning is required to \u2018match\u2019 a 10% improvement in hand hygiene compliance.
