This includes observations on the oceans, soils, and on animals. With respect to humans, it became increasingly apparent that the species on and in our bodies make significant contributions to our health and development. These species maintain normal cell function in the gastrointestinal tract (for example, see Eckburg et al., 2005; Bik et al., 2006; Gill et al., 2006) . We are also dependent on these species for the efficient digestion of food components, such as plant material and xenobiotics , and to ward off certain diseases. In parallel, these microbes have been associated with, and can result in, many common diseases such as cavities, stomach ulcers, bacterial vaginosis (BV), and irritable bowel syndrome (Foster et al., 2008; Dorer et al., 2009) .",

The limit to culturing or 16S rRNA sequencing was primarily a reflection of the availability of molecular tools and approaches, and the cost associated with earlier versions of available sequencing technologies. The 16S rRNA sequencing and analysis invariably revealed a higher level of microbial diversity than that seen with conventional culture techniques (Gao et al., 2007; Gao et al., 2008) . From the human stomach, for example, although the highly acidic environment was thought to only contain Helicobacter types, Bik et al. (2006) used 1,833 16S rRNA sequences obtained from 23 gastric endoscopic biopsy samples to identify 128 phylotypes of bacteria that potentially reside in the human stomach. The majority of these phylotypes was shown to belong to the Proteobacteria, Firmicutes, Actinobacteria, Bacteroidetes, and Fusobacteria. This work also described that 10% of the clones represented organisms that were previously uncharacterized.",

Most of these studies that have investigated the diversity of the microbial species associated with the human body have however left important questions unanswered such as the identity of the nondominant community members and their biological roles, and which metabolic processes the populations that are present encode and carry out. In addition, the past 15 years of genomic research have made it clear that closely related species, and even species that are identical at the 16S rRNA level, can have wide variation in gene content (Perna et al., 2001; Kudva et al., 2002) . Terms such as pan-genome and core-genome have been coined over the years to address the variations that are apparent in closely related species and have now been applied in a similar fashion to metagenomic populations (Callister et al., 2008; Bentley, 2009) .",

            "text": "The initial publication of a shotgun sequencing of the human microbiome focused on the analysis of fecal samples from the human gastrointestinal tract . This study along with subsequent applications of shotgun techniques to the study of the human microbiome again highlighted the extent of microbial diversity associated with the human body (Grice et al., 2009) . Gordon and co-workers, for example, investigated the interplay between the gastrointestinal ecology and energy balance of animals on a Western diet. Here they found that obesity that was induced by the diet resulted in an increased proportion of one class of the Firmicutes and that this same population could be reduced by manipulation of the diet. Transplantation of the microbial populations from the obese mice to lean germ-free mice resulted in a higher level of the deposition of fat than when these microbial populations were taken from lean donors (Turnbaugh et al., 2008) . More recently, Gordon's group presented the results of a monozygotic and dizygotic twin pair study, where twins were concordant for leanness or obesity, and their mothers (Turnbaugh et al., 2009) . The aim of this study was to address how host genotype, environmental exposure, and host adiposity influence the gut microbiome (Turnbaugh et al., 2009) . The comparative analysis of fecal samples that were derived from 154 individuals yielded 9,920 near full-length and 1,937,461 partial bacterial 16S rRNA sequences. In addition, 2.14 Gb of metagenomic data was obtained from their microbiomes. The results from this analysis suggest that the gastrointestinal microbiome is shared among family members, but variations are present within each individual with respect to the lineages that can be observed. This variation was evident in both the monozygotic and dizygotic twin pairs. The results however suggest that there is a core functional microbiome that can vary depending on physiological states.",

Their results evolved from initial metagenomic studies on human gastric samples using fosmid libraries from six healthy patients, and six patients with Crohn's disease (CD). The group was able to identify 125 nonredundant ribotypes mainly represented by the phyla Bacteroidetes and Firmicutes, of which 43 distinct ribotypes were identified in the healthy microbiota, and only 13 in CD.

The project has been described as a community resource, with overarching aims to help determine the core human microbiome, to understand the changes in the human microbiome that can be correlated with changes in human health, to develop new technological and bioinformatics tools to support these goals, and to address the ethical, legal, and social issues raised by human microbiome research (http://nihroadmap.nih.gov/hmp/). The project has a heavy sequencing and data analysis component that currently is underway at the four large NHGRI/NIAID-funded sequencing centers (J. Craig Venter Institute (JCVI), Baylor College of Medicine, The Broad Institute and Washington University). The current sequencing focus includes generating at least 3000 reference genomes at various levels of finishing (Chain et al., 2009) , coupled with significant 16S rRNA sequencing and metagenomic sequencing from 15 to 18 body sites on 300 individuals some of which would be repeat sample donors (http://nihroadmap.nih.gov/hmp/). A number of \"Investigator\"-driven demonstration projects have also been awarded. These demonstration projects aim to understand the implications of a number of diseases including CD, BV, psoriasis, and esophageal cancer to name a few (Peterson et al., 2009) . It is anticipated that the results from these demonstration projects will give additional insights into the relationship between human health and disease and changes in the human microbiome. Finally, the Human Microbiome Project (HMP) roadmap initiative has awarded funds to investigate new technologies for improving knowledge of the human microbiome, as well as for the development of computational tools that will increase the value of metagenomic data (http://nihroadmap.nih.gov/hmp/fundedresearch.asp), and the ethical, legal, and social implications of this work.",

The global health sector is of particular importance given the increasing number of diseases that plague the developing world (some of which are making a comeback after several years under effective control). Examples of some of these are detailed below. Consequently, in most developing countries throughout the world, and specifically in sub-Saharan Africa, South America, and Asia, there is a serious need to improve public health. In these countries, communicable diseases caused by known and even unknown pathogens (see below) remain a leading cause of mortality. Emerging infectious diseases are a major cause for alarm, and malnutrition and associated effects are also major issues that need to be effectively addressed.",

Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) was the first infectious disease to emerge in the 21st century, and other emerging viral infectious diseases according to The World Health Organisation (WHO) include but are not limited to Ebola and Marburg hemorrhagic fevers. In addition, in an earlier publication by WHO (\"New WHO office to help developing countries control emerging diseases\"; J Environ Health 63, 2001) it was stated that in 1998 alone, communicable diseases caused the death of over 13 million people worldwide, mainly among the poorest populations of developing countries. Since then, more than 30 new communicable diseases have been identified, and this list includes several diseases that were thought to be almost extinct that apparently have come back into the human population. Certain food-borne diseases are also considered to be emerging as they now occur more often, and that list includes outbreaks of salmonellosis, which have increased significantly in the past 25 years. Listeria monocytogenes also falls into this category as its major role in food-borne diseases has become more recently appreciated, and some food-borne trematodes are also emerging as a serious public health concern. Although food-borne infections with Escherichia coli serotype O157:H7 were first described in 1982, it has rapidly emerged to be a leading cause of infections, which in turn result as a major cause of bloody diarrhea and acute renal failure, with an infection that is sometimes fatal. Finally, while cholera devastated much of Asia and Africa for years, its introduction for the first time in almost a century on the South American continent in 1991 makes it another example of an emerging infectious disease.",

Notwithstanding ongoing efforts focusing on vaccines, better diagnostics, and improved treatment of many of these diseases, it is becoming increasingly essential to complement such approaches with an investigation of the role of the human microbiome on human health. Several areas of anticipated important contribution of the human microbiome include zoonotic diseases and other emerging and re-emerging infectious diseases, sexually transmitted diseases, diarrheal diseases, respiratory diseases, eukaryotic diseases, malnutrition, and the integration of probiotics for improving human health. In addition to the translation of findings into practical approaches for improving human health, other opportunities offered by the human microbiome initiative are related to the transfer of technology to developing countries and the associated long-term benefits to training local populations in these developing sciences so that nations can retain the benefits.

The nonresident microbiota contains known and unknown microbes that cause a wide range of human diseases, most of which remain to be effectively controlled in both the developed and the developing world. Human losses in the developing world in terms of mortality and contributions to economic development appear to be greater, however. Currently, for example, communicable diseases caused by eukaryotic parasites such as Plasmodium spp., Leishmania spp., Trypanosoma spp., and various viruses, among others, remain serious public health concerns in the developing world and affect more than 1.2 billion people (Mahmoud and Zerhouni, 2009) . In this context, scientific challenges that include genomics, metagenomics, proteomics, and metabolomics-related activities need to be expanded to ultimately encompass system and ecological understanding of communities of microbes and their interactions with humans. It has in fact been anticipated that the control of these diseases may be accelerated by the complete understanding of the genomes of these species, coupled with an understanding of the changes of the human microbiome that favor or reduce/eliminate their virulence and/or transmissibility. The adaptation processes, for example, by which zoonotic microorganisms that enter the human population adapt to become pathogens overtime can also be accelerated by longitudinal studies that focus on the populations on the bodies of both healthy and diseased individuals.",

For the above-mentioned study, Gordon's group will investigate the microbes in severe malnutrition with a major focus on severely malnourished infants living in Malawi and Bangladesh, and whether their microbial flora varies from that found in healthy infants who live in the same environment. It is anticipated that as a result of these studies, we will be better positioned to develop effective treatment regimes for these disease conditions.

Such cases of unknown and potentially pathogenic microorganisms in circulation in the human population are usually favored by factors related to (1) the ability of microorganisms to adapt in new hosts, (2) human actions (interactions with wild animals, hunting and effects on the environment leading to ecological disturbances), and (3) human movements as a result of global world travel (Field, 2009) . Consequently, at any particular time, there could be a set of known and unknown microorganisms present in a given individual or a population as a result of their presence in and interaction with a specific environment or organisms therein such as animal reservoirs (i.e., bats, mice, and rats) of known and unknown microorganisms. The main challenge in the context of forecasting, and better yet preventing emerging and reemerging infectious diseases has been early detection and genetic identification of such known and unknown microorganisms. Global human microbiome studies using metagenomics analysis of known and unknown microorganisms provide unique but powerful opportunities to uncover the near-complete composition of the microbial content of an individual or a population at any given time, thus setting the stage for a comprehensive inventory of the genetic characteristics of potential human pathogens.",

Such initiatives will not only provide insights into the resident and transient microbial populations but also, in the case of natural reservoirs of given microorganisms, provide an opportunity to pinpoint the genetic changes that must occur for their adaptation to a new host -the human body.

The renewed interest and funding for top infectious diseases has recently revamped efforts to accelerate TB research, with a particular focus on the use of integrated approaches to find better control measures. In this context, it is proposed and highly anticipated that key aspects such as the integration of large-scale \"omics,\" datasets focusing on parasite genetic determinants, host genetics, and host-parasite interactions will be crucial for this quest for better control measures. In addition, and given recent reports, the human microbiome would be a great addition to this integration of data in the context of systems biology. To this end, the evaluation of the human microbiome in cases of latent, nonlatent TB, and drug-resistant TB infections will provide insights into the role of the human (resident and nonresident) flora in various aspects of TB infections. Such information would most likely contribute to improving diagnosis, control, and spread of TB infection.",

Many animals including rodents and dogs are known to be reservoirs of Leptospira, and humans are considered to be the accidental hosts of this pathogen. Transmission of the pathogen is primarily from soil and water to mammalian tissues (often noticed following on large-scale flooding), with the infection occurring via penetrating leptospires through mucosa or open skin. Symptoms of leptospirosis include meningitis, pneumonitis, hepatitis, nephritis, pancreatitis, erythema nodosum, and death. No human vaccine against leptospirosis is available, and mild leptospirosis is treated with doxycycline, ampicillin, or amoxicillin. For severe leptospirosis, the primary therapy is penicillin G.

In addition, the availability of these genomes is allowing for the identification of novel virulence factors, and ultimately will facilitate vaccine development. Recently, the genome sequence of the free-living L. biflexa was completed (Picardeau et al., 2008) and shown to contain 3,590 protein-coding genes distributed across three circular replicons. In the current study, it has been estimated that 2,052 genes (61%) represent a progenitor genome that existed before divergence of pathogenic and saprophytic Leptospira species. Basically, nearly one-third of the L. biflexa genes are absent in pathogenic Leptospira. In addition, 1,431 pathogen specific genes that are found in the pathogenic Leptospires are not present in L. biflexa. Of these, 893 genes have no known function suggesting that there are mechanisms that are unique to Leptospira and that the pathogenic specific genes need further study. The resulting genome studies suggest that there is still a significant amount of information that is not understood about the Leptospiras, particularly as it relates to how the species adapts to new environments and how the genomes mutate. Metagenomic studies of samples derived from infected populations will present an opportunity to study the pathogen without repeated passage where it has been shown to have genome rearrangements. In parallel, the pathogen can be studied directly in the environment when it is in transition from its natural host to humans (the accidental host). Interestingly, there is a large NIAID-funded project underway at the JCVI to sequence the genomes of an additional 400 Leptospira isolates (Joe Vinetz, personal communication; http://gsc.jcvi.org/).",

Recently, van de Wijgert et al. (2008) described a study in which they investigated the relationships among BV, vaginal yeast, and vaginal practices, mucosal inflammation, and HIV acquisition. From a cohort of 4,531 HIV-negative women, they observed that women who were positive for BV or vaginal yeast had a higher likelihood to acquire HIV, and they concluded that BV and yeast may contribute more to the HIV epidemic than previously appreciated (van de Wijgert et al., 2008) . Similar observations have been made in a review of all available literature on the extent to which BV may increase the risk of HIV acquisition (Atashili et al., 2008) . Earlier, in 2000 , van De Wijgert et al. (2000 studied 169 Zimbabwean women to determine if intravaginal practices could be associated with changes in the vaginal flora and acquisition of STDs. In this study, they found that some disturbances of the flora could be associated with increased likelihood of STDs and HIV; the absence of Lactobacilli from the vaginal flora was associated with being positive for HIV (van De Wijgert et al., 2000) . Martin et al. (1999) had similarly looked at a cohort of sex workers in Kenya and demonstrated that although only 26% of these women were colonized with Lactobacillus species at baseline, follow-up studies showed that the absence of culturable vaginal lactobacilli could be associated with the increased likelihood of acquiring HIV-1. Abnormal vaginal flora on Grams-stain was associated with increased risk of both HIV-1 acquisitions. This group proposed that the treatment of BV and the use of lactobacilli to colonize the vaginal cavity should be evaluated for reduce risk of acquiring HIV-1, gonorrhea, and trichomoniasis (Martin et al., 1999) . How the microbial populations in the vaginal cavity can contribute to reduce chances of HIV infection is one of those major areas that need attention, and that will undoubtedly benefit from human microbiome research.",

People who live in lower-income communities, i.e., approximately half of the world's population, are at risk of the disease. The WHO reports that in 2006 malaria was present in 109 countries and territories.",

Genomics approaches have already been used to elucidate the genomes of several of the Plasmodium species (Gardner et al., 2002; Carlton et al., 2008; Pain et al., 2008; Mitsui et al., 2009 ), but new metagenomics approaches present opportunities to monitor the impact of the parasite of the microbial communities that reside on and in the human body, with a longer-term potential to develop novel probiotic approaches to supplement nutrition of infected individuals while the parasite runs its course.",

This is particularly relevant since mosquitoes breed in areas where there are wet conditions, and the transmission of the disease can differ according to local factors such as rainfall, proximity of mosquito breeding sites to people, and the mosquito species in the area. A November 2009 report from Susan Anyangu in Nairobi, Kenya, carried by Inter Press Service (IPS) states that the RTS.S vaccine being developed is to be used specifically in Africa.

Although the benefits of probiotics are evident, they have yet to be adapted extensively in the developing world (Reid and Devillard, 2004) . Other ideas on the use of probiotics for reducing the morbidity and mortality associated with HIV/AIDS have been explored and proposed (Reid et al., 2005) where it has been proposed that lactic acid bacteria could play a role in maintaining the health of the human gut. We can only hope that as a result of the initiatives of the human microbiome project, new probiotics for a range of human health conditions may be developed based on baselines for people in different geographic locales.",
