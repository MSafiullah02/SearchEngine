Another newly recognized respiratory pathogen, human metapneumovirus (hMPV) (Boivin et al., 2007, McIntosh and McAdam, 2004, Principi et al., 2006), was detected in many early SARS cases worldwide (Kuiken et al., 2003, Poutanen et al., 2003, Tomlinson and Cockram, 2003). Respiratory illnesses caused by hMPV may range from mild ILI (influenza-like illness) to severe pneumonia (Boivin et al., 2007, McIntosh and McAdam, 2004, Principi et al., 2006). Although not the cause of SARS (Ksiazek et al., 2003), its clinico-epidemiological significance during the outbreak remained unknown. Previously we reported the detection of hMPV in SARS patients (Chan et al., 2003), but did not perform detailed clinico-epidemiological studies. We describe a nosocomial outbreak of hMPV infection during the early SARS epidemic in Hong Kong, examine risk factors for its acquisition, and hypothesize on its possible interaction with SARS.",

Although the epidemiological linkages cannot be ascertained, these findings indicate co-circulation of hMPV during that period (Tomlinson and Cockram, 2003). Co-infection by two respiratory pathogens is not uncommon, given similar routes of transmission (e.g. hMPV and RSV) (Manoha et al., 2007, Tomlinson and Cockram, 2003). Efficient transmission of hMPV in health-care facilities, with resulting serious outbreaks, has been reported (Boivin et al., 2007, van den Hoogen, 2007). Involvement of HCWs (as victims and/or vehicles of transmission to other HCWs or patients) in major respiratory infection outbreaks has also been frequently recognized (Brankston et al., 2007, CDC, 2005, Lee and Sung, 2003, Sartor et al., 2002, Sherertz et al., 2001).",

            "text": "hMPV/SARS-CoV co-infection is not associated with significant differences in clinical manifestations and outcomes compared to SARS infection alone (Lazar et al., 2004, Poutanen et al., 2003). However, the simultaneous occurrence of two outbreaks of respiratory infection raises the possibility of significant interaction between them. Upper respiratory symptoms caused by one pathogen may enhance the dispersal of another through aerosol generation, resulting in \u2018super-spreading events\u2019 (source as \u2018super-spreaders\u2019 or \u2018cloud\u2019 patients\u2014e.g. rhinovirus and Staphylococcus aureus) (Bassetti et al., 2003, Bassetti et al., 2005a, Bassetti et al., 2005b, Sherertz et al., 2001, Sheretz et al., 1996). Whether hMPV and SARS-CoV interacted similarly is unclear, but co-transmission of hMPV in another major SARS outbreak (n\n = 10) (Poutanen et al., 2003), and the higher percentage of upper respiratory symptoms (e.g. runny nose and cough) reported by early SARS patients at PWH (22%, compared to 2\u201315% elsewhere), lend support to such a hypothesis (Bassetti et al., 2005a, Christian et al., 2004). In our analysis, cough and coryza were present in a higher proportion (22.6%) of hMPV co-infected individuals (vs. 15.9%), although the difference was not statistically significant. However, the overall scenario is likely to have been complex, as it involved contact/interactions between HCWs, patients, and certain environmental factors (e.g. use of nebulizer) (Lee and Sung, 2003, Lee et al., 2003, Yu et al., 2005).",
