The grand challenges of today are diverse, involving a range of complex issues such as climate change, severe economic downturns, and political instability (George, Howard-Grenville, Joshi, & Tihanyi, 2016). In our interconnected world, these significant problems can pose an immediate threat to organizations\u2019 vitality and survival, encouraging organizations to remain responsive and adaptive as they organize and manage their workforce. But with the recent outbreak of COVID-19 (\u201cCoronavirus (COVID-19)\u201d, 2020), organizations face a grand challenge of unparalleled proportions, one that forces them to dive into and directly manage unprecedented territory as they alter their workforce in technical, physical and socio-psychological ways not seen before.",

For example, employees who formerly spent all or most of their time working inside their organization\u2019s physical boundaries now have to quickly adjust to remote work environments. Due to shelter in place orders and the closure of non-essential businesses, even those who might be well adjusted to remote working conditions are now faced with their own unique challenges due to an inability to seek alternative workspaces (e.g., caf\u00e9s, libraries, coworking-spaces) outside of the home itself. This has likely further limited the segmentation between work and private spheres leading to greater difficulties in \u201cunplugging\u201d from work demands (Chawla, MacGowan, Gabriel, & Podsakoff, 2020). Aside from the increased inability to separate work and private life, the closure of schools and child-care services has increased parental demands for employees, further blurring the lines between work and family spheres. While these work-family interconnections seem particularly demanding for employees with children, single and childless workers are not immune to the negative consequences of such altered working conditions, as they may be at greatest risk of loneliness, a felt lack of purpose, and associated negative effects on well-being (Achor, Kellerman, Reece, & Robichaux, 2018).",

Such dramatic alterations in how and where employees do their work is likely to have important implications for employees\u2019 experiences of person-environment fit (P-E fit), or the level of congruence between the attributes they possess and those of the environment (Kristof, 1996). P-E fit theory posits that individuals are attracted to and selected by organizations whose work environments reflect the same values, cultures, and work features as their own important beliefs, values, and desires (Kristof-Brown & Guay, 2011). Based upon these processes, employees who enter organizations where their P-E fit is maximized typically flourish and experience heightened levels of satisfaction, engagement, and overall well-being (Kristof-Brown, Zimmerman, & Johnson, 2005). However, when the work environment that supports the fulfillment of these needs and desires is drastically altered \u2013 as is currently happening in response to the COVID-19 pandemic \u2013 the saliency of the growing chasm between an individual\u2019s needs and current work environment is likely to lead to experiences of misfit (Follmer, Talbot, Kristof-Brown, Astrove, & Billsberry, 2018).",

Keeping with the prior example concerning the need for social relationships, a current panacea for balancing social connections embraced by many organizations involves virtual socialization opportunities such as virtual lunches, coffee breaks, and happy hours (Maurer, 2020b). While these practices potentially alleviate perceptions of misfit as a result of the abrupt change in the social fabric of the work environment, they may also leave participants feeling unsatisfied as they pine for the social interactions they had in their pre-pandemic work-lives (Fetters, 2020, Sacco and Ismail, 2014). Accordingly, more research is needed to better understand how these transformed community-building practices translate to rebalancing the experienced P-E misfit. Building upon the work of Chawla et al. (2020) regarding the daily recovery activities of employees, for instance, future research could investigate the daily impact and recovery experienced when engaging in virtual social activities with colleagues as a replacement for face-to-face social gatherings.",

One form of support that is likely to be increasingly necessary for employees balancing blurred work-family roles is informational support. In the present context, such forms of support might include helping employees stay informed of recent developments regarding health and safety, whether and when local childcare options or elderly care services are available, and self-development and training opportunities that can help employees adapt themselves to changing roles and requirements.",

Consider, for example, the role of job autonomy, or the degree of discretion individuals have about how and when to do tasks or what methods are used when carrying out their work (Langfred, 2000), in reducing family-work conflict. In general, increasing job autonomy can help mitigate the family-related pressures that tend to arise within remote work environments by providing employees with sufficient cognitive and emotional resources to manage the additional and often incompatible demands (e.g., Golden et al., 2006). Yet, with the spread of COVID-19, many employees are mandated to work from home as opposed to selecting themselves into such autonomous work modes that might have naturally aligned with other employees\u2019 needs and preferences. That is, when considering those unaccustomed to working in remote contexts, the extent to which the provision of greater job autonomy will be effective may largely depend on the extent to which an individual values autonomy and associated self-responsibility in the first place (Shin, 2004, Stiglbauer and Kovacs, 2018).",

Although organizational scholars have devoted scant attention to this segment of the labor market, the limited existing research suggests that single and childless employees may face unique forms of work-life conflict (Picard, 1997, Swanberg et al., 2005). In addition, these individuals may be at particularly high risk of loneliness and feelings of social exclusion (Achor, Kellerman, Reece, & Robichaux, 2018), possibly due to a lack of binding (family) ties, a felt lack of purpose, and isolation.",

This is not entirely surprising, given that individuals working from home tend to report less inclusion than those within traditional work arrangements (Morganson, Major, Oborn, Verive, & Heelan 2008). But when combined with recent social/physical distancing measures, closure of non-essential businesses, and shelter in place orders, a felt lack of inclusion and belongingness may become especially salient among childless and single employees (Henning-Smith, 2020), thus posing considerable risk to their mental health and well-being, as well as the productivity of organizations.",

Organizations may want to begin addressing this issue by adopting a more inclusive and thereby creative approach to supporting all employees, considering various forms of family status. For example, human resource managers may want to look toward enhancing relationship-oriented HR systems in order to combat the greater risk of isolation among childless and single employees and better prepare them for unanticipated events (such as our current crisis) that can lead to feelings of loneliness and social exclusion. Such relationship-oriented HR systems can help employees build ties both within and outside the organization (Kehoe & Collins, 2017) and thus develop a reservoir of resources needed to cope with possible social shocks like the one we currently face, such as by focusing on network-development, training and feedback. Further options include regularly sponsoring professional and social events, where the childless and singles can find meaning, strengthen purpose, and instituting formal mechanisms (such as regular team meetings) to encourage employees to connect with one another (Collins & Clark, 2003).",

Perhaps most importantly, research is needed to understand the work-related antecedents and mechanisms contributing to childless and single employees\u2019 feelings of loneliness and social exclusion (Achor et al., 2018) and what buffers stand to mitigate such feelings in general, and during the current context of COVID-19 in particular. For example, researchers might begin by identifying the various ways in which childless and single employees perceive themselves to be stereotyped or stigmatized at work, given that such negative social cues can magnify employees\u2019 experience of social exclusion and thereby misfit (Follmer et al., 2018) \u2013 an issue that may be especially salient as employees\u2019 belongingness and inclusion are further strained in the current environment. Much of the research on family structure has focused on the stigmas accompanying employees with children \u2013 particularly women with children \u2013 and the negative consequences associated with such stigmatization (Corse, 1991; Fuegen, Biernat, Haines, & Deaux, 2004; for a recent review, see Grandey, Gabriel, & King, 2019). However, research in fields such as social psychology and gender studies, for example, suggests that, childless and single employees may face their own unique set of stigmas (Park, 2002, Remennick, 2000, Byrne and Carr, 2005), potentially contributing to harmful health- and well-being-related consequences (Ashburn-Nardo, 2017, Maslach and Jackson, 1985).",

For example, one reason why entrepreneurs often thrive despite operating in highly uncertain and demanding environments is due to the value they place on autonomy (Prottas, 2008, Van Gelderen, 2016) and their ability to craft the \u201cperfect job\u201d (Baron, 2010). Might employees in today\u2019s dynamic environment be able to leverage some of the characteristics of entrepreneurs in order to better adjust to their new work conditions? Prior research suggests that adopting characteristics typically found among entrepreneurs (e.g., valuing autonomy, tolerance of uncertainty, approaching new situations openly and proactively) can be beneficial for employees in traditional employment settings (e.g., Gawke, Gorgievski, & Bakker, 2017). Toward this end, research on the role of job design in facilitating employees\u2019 entrepreneurial qualities (De Jong, Parker, Wennekers, & Wu, 2015) coupled with recent work demonstrating the malleability of personality and values in response to drastic life events (Tasselli et al., 2018) may provide a foundation for future research to explore and inform organizations how to best help employees adjust and thrive in the current turbulent work environment.",

Recent research suggests that some entrepreneurs may be highly susceptible to feelings of loneliness, social exclusion, and reduced well-being (Fernet, Torr\u00e8s, Austin, & St-Pierre, 2016). Although social support from others at work can generally mitigate these downsides (for an overview see Stephan, 2018), entrepreneurs typically have far fewer sources of work-related social support relative to traditional employees (Rahim, 1996, Tetrick et al., 2000). Nevertheless and interestingly, some entrepreneurs overcome these limitations by leveraging alternative, domain-specific sources of social support \u2013 such as positive feedback from customers \u2013 ultimately enhancing their well-being (Anderson and Hughes, 2010, Lechat and Torr\u00e8s, 2017). Using such inductive approaches to identify such overlooked or untapped sources of social support is likely to be necessary to understand how best to help employees cope with and adjust to the current dynamic work environment.",

Accordingly, our focus must be forward thinking, building on the assumption that the grand challenge we currently face is not a singular, anomalous event, but rather constitutes a \u201cnew reality\u201d that offers new opportunities to which organizational scholars and practitioners alike will need and want to remain attentive.
