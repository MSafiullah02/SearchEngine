Unfortunately, incomplete knowledge of the best practices by front-line clinicians and\ndelayed, error-prone care delivery processes are ubiquitous threats to patient safety and commonly offset the potential\nbenefits of critical care support. This is particularly important early in the course of\ncritical illness, when errors and delays in appropriate care often lead to costly complications and poor outcomes, even in\nadvanced hospital settings. In resource-poor settings, inadequate human resources and training present additional barriers\nto safe and effective use of life-saving procedures. Simple interventions, such as early recognition and treatment of\ncardio-respiratory failure, low tidal volume mechanical ventilation, early appropriate antimicrobial treatment, physical\ntherapy, deep vein thrombosis and stress ulcer prophylaxis, require little specialized equipment but are crucial to\nsuccessful outcome of critically ill patients [4]. Accordingly, these\ninterventions have to be systematically implemented without omission or delay. This seemingly simple and straightforward\ntask has proven to be an enormous challenge and nothing but a distant dream in hospitals worldwide.",

More recently, a multicenter quality improvement intervention targeting patients\nwith severe sepsis in the emergency department showed that rapid implementation of early bundle elements (i. e.,\nappropriate empiric antimicrobials, fluid bolus, lactate) was associated with aborted progression of organ failures\nmaking the patients \u201cineligible\u201d for subsequent bundle elements (inotropes, steroids, transfusions, low tidal volume\nventilation for ARDS) [29].",
