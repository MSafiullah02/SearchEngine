By contrast, there has been no corresponding high-throughput revolution in structural biology. Obtaining solved structures of proteins at adequate resolution remains a painstaking task. X-ray crystallography is still the gold standard for structure determination more than 60 years after its first use in determining myoglobin structure [1]. The result of this discrepancy between the rate of protein sequence determination and the rate of protein structure determination is the protein sequence-structure gap [2].",

RdRPs are the best conserved proteins throughout the RNA viruses, being essential for their replication [4]. Conservation is particularly high in structural regions that are involved in the replication process, for instance the indispensable RNA-binding pocket [5]. RdRPs are also of immense medical importance as the principal targets for anti-viral drugs. Evolution of resistance against anti-viral drugs is a major concern for the future, and the design of novel anti-viral compounds is a highly active research area. Solved structures of RdRPs are of great assistance to these efforts, as they enable the use of docking protocols against large libraries of pharmaceutical candidate compounds [e.g. Refs. [6,7]].",

This paper will first identify where the protein sequence-structure gap is at its widest in RdRPs. Because of the sequence-structure gap, it is therefore impossible in many genera to perform docking protocols against solved structures of RdRP for discovery of novel anti-viral compounds. Under these circumstances, replacement of real solved structures with homology models for docking experiments requires that the homology models used should be both high quality and also optimally representative of their respective genera. Our second task is to present several similarity metrics in sequence space that assist in the identification of the virus species having the RdRP sequence that is most representative of its genus as a whole. We then present the first use of force-directed graphs to produce an intuitive visualization of sequence space, and select target RdRPs without solved structures for homology modelling. These are then used to perform homology modelling using template-target pairs within the same genus, between sister genera and between sister families, monitoring the quality of the models produced as the template becomes progressively more genetically distant to the target sequence being modelled. Finally, we produce homology models for reconstructed common ancestral RdRP sequences. In the light of our results, we comment on the strengths and weakness of homology modelling to reduce the size of the protein sequence-structure gap for RdRPs, and produce a flowchart of recommendations for docking experiments on RdRP proteins lacking a solved structure.",

Similarly, Rotavirus has eight reference sequences, with four at each end of a fairly regular cuboid. Fig. 1A also shows how the various methods equations (2), (3), (4), (5), (6), (7), (8), (9)) for determining the CNN of sequence space for each genus, are in poor agreement.

Only in Lentivirus is the optimal template also the mean CNN, and only in Vesiculovirus is the optimal template a shortest-path CNN.

Additionally, within the genera Orthohantavirus, Orthonairovirus and Mammarenavirus, all within the order Bunyavirales, the solved structure available for RdRP covers less than 10% of the protein sequence. Given the medical importance of many viruses within these taxa, and the number of anti-viral drugs that target RdRPs, we suggest that they are prioritized for X-ray crystallography to close the \u201csequence-structure gap\u201d.",

The three dimensional visualization produced from multidimensional scaling is visually richer, but this benefit can only be appreciated when a viewing application such as Spotfire is available so that the three-dimensional image can be rotated. Force-directed graphs convey much of the information in a single image which may be printed on a page or viewed on screen. This two-dimensional collapsing of sequence space also allows for easy simultaneous comparison of multiple datasets, in the present case multiple genera, which cannot readily be performed if separate three-dimensional viewers require to be open.",

For instance, starting from a distance matrix, agglomerative hierarchical clustering, such as the UPGMA method [29], can be performed to generate a tree. Slightly more sophisticated methods, such as neighbour-joining [30] can generate trees where the branch lengths are proportional to genetic distance. Force-directed graphs do not represent genetic distance as accurately as phylogenetic trees, since the distances between nodes, although optimized to reflect relatedness, are constrained by the Fruchterman-Reingold algorithm to the best representation in two dimensions. However, force-directed graphs again allow easier simultaneous comparison of several data sets than phylogenetic trees. Fig. 1 would be impossible to create on a single page if trees were used instead of force-directed graphs. Trees represent ancestral sequences as nodes on the tree, with only existing taxa as leaves. Force-directed graphs, by contrast, allow ancestral sequences to be represented in the same way as existing ones. Fig. 1C shows that ancestral sequences do not necessarily appear as outliers in force-directed graphs. Indeed, for genera Flavivirus, Hepacivirus, Orthobunyavirus and Orthohantavirus in particular, the insertion of the reconstructed ancestral sequence into the force-directed graph in Fig. 1C does not overly distort its original shape in Fig. 1A\u2013B. The reason for this becomes apparent when one considers a phylogenetic tree represented in unrooted \u201cstar\u201d format. The ancestral sequence is then at the centre of the star topology and it can be seen that the genetic distance from the root to any particular leaf sequence may often be less than for many pairwise leaf sequence combinations. We did not perform calculation of centroid nearest neighbours (CNNs) for alignments incorporating reconstructed ancestral sequences, but we are tempted to speculate that many of the ancestral sequences would have been CNNs, had they been included.",

Among the various statistics for assessment of model quality, \u03a6-\u03a8 outlier percentage is a measure of the proportion of implausible dihedral angles in the model, and indicate where parts of the model backbone are likely to be incorrectly predicted. Nevertheless, it is also important not to become too dependent on statistics such as \u03a6-\u03a8 outlier percentage, as \u201cbad\u201d angles do occasionally occur in solved structures. For instance in the present study, the thresholds of <0.05% for a very high quality model, and <2% for a good quality model given by Lovell et al. [19] would suggest that six of the twelve template solved structures used here (Table 2) would not have been assessed as \u201cvery high quality\u201d had they been models rather than solved structures. Indeed the templates from Indiana Vesiculovirus and Rotavirus A have more than 0.5% \u03a6-\u03a8 outliers, and also have the poor quality scores for QMEAN. These two structures also have the poorest resolution of any of our templates, at > 3 \u00c5. The poor quality scoring may therefore simply be a consequence of uncertainties in positioning of atoms in these structures. One might reasonably posit that the use of template solved structures having such issues might influence the resulting models to contain the same outliers. However, the model for Rotavirus I has a lower level of \u03a6-\u03a8 outliers than its Rotavirus A template (Table 3).",

Here, we provide examples (Table 4) of such successful inter-genus, intra-family, models for genera Coltivirus and Parechovirus. Our inter-genus models for Lyssavirus and Spumavirus are slightly less successful. Moving to the next taxonomic level, models with template-target pairs in separate families (Table 5) are generally less successful. One exception is our model for family Phenuiviridae, which is better than some of the intra-family models. This is encouraging, since Phenuiviridae is a family without any solved RdRP structure. Homology models have been produced at much larger taxonomic distances than those dealt with here, for instance from bacteria to eukaryotes [31], so it should be stressed that we make no claim for the generality of our findings outside of the viral orders under consideration, or for proteins other than RdRP. Multi-domain proteins in particular, may produce higher quality models for some domains than others.",

            "text": "One surprising result was the high quality of the models of reconstructed ancestral sequences (Table 6, summarized in Table 7). As previously discussed, this may be due to the fact that the ancestral sequence is, assuming a regular molecular clock, potentially equally related to all descendent members of its genus. In this paper, we calculated centroid nearest neighbours (CNNs) as the central points in sequence space for each genus (Fig. 1). A reconstructed ancestral sequence may also be considered as a candidate central point. The value of central points is that they may serve as targets that could be used to make models representative of their genus as a whole. For instance, the shortest-path, mean and median CNNs of genus Orthohantavirus are sequences 16, 22 and 7 (see Supplementary Table for a list of sequences for each genus), representing Sin Nombre orthohantavirus, Rockport orthohantavirus and Cao Bang orthohantavirus respectively. The partial solved structure used as the template for modelling in the genus Orthohantavirus in the present paper is from Hantaan orthohantavirus (5IZE, see Table 2) and the target used, Imjin thottimvirus (sequence 27 in Orthohantavirus panel of Fig. 1), is now classified as belonging to a new genus Thottimvirus (Table 3). The three CNNs, Sin Nombre orthohantavirus, Rockport orthohantavirus and Cao Bang orthohantavirus are 71%, 64% and 75% identical to 5IZE respectively, whereas Imjin thottimvirus is only 58% identical. The latter was of course chosen to test the effectiveness of intra-genus homology modelling over as wide a genetic distance as possible (see Section 2.5). For the performance of subsequent experimental procedures on Orthohantavirus RdRPs, for instance docking to discover novel anti-viral compounds, a homology model corresponding to one of the three CNNs mentioned above or to the reconstructed ancestor (Table 6) would be the preferred target, along with the existing solved structure.",

Where a solved structure exists within a genus, it is the obvious choice for further experiments. However, where that solved structure is far from any of the CNN sequences of the genus, as judged by the force-directed graph, a CNN may also be homology modelled for comparative purposes, using the existing solved structure as a template. Any differential performance of the solved structure and the homology model in, for instance, a docking experiment, may give clues as to the generality of conclusions derived from the solved structure alone. A reconstructed ancestral RdRP may also be used as an alternative to, or in addition to, a CNN. The limits of homology modelling would appear, on the basis of the results presented here, to be at the intra-family, inter-genus level. Template-target pairs in different viral families are unlikely to be of practical use, as the predicted quality of the resulting models is low. Our models were produced using MOE, and we have not performed comparisons using other modelling tools, such as SWISS-MODEL [31] or Modeller [32]. We feel that it is unlikely that significant differences in output would be produced, but when the object of the exercise is drug-discovery, we recommend that the protocol in Fig. 5 be implemented using several alternative modelling softwares.",
