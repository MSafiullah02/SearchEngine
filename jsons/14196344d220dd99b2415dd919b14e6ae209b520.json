This study suggests that the majority of infants with wheezing have transient conditions associated with diminished airway function at birth and do not have an increased risk of asthma or allergies later in life; in a minority of infants, however, wheezing episodes are probably related to a predisposition of asthma. Most recently, another report showed that there was no correlation between asthma at 10 year and initial RSV infection [40] . The results of this report fit better with the view that RSV infection triggers severe wheezing bronchitis in the predisposed child [41] than with the hypothesis that the RSV infection as such induces a process leading to persistent asthma [28] .",

Histamine was detectable in nasopharyngeal secretions of some RSV patients with all forms of illness but was detected significantly more often and in higher concentrations in patients with wheezing [53] . Peak titres of RSV-IgE and concentrations of histamine correlated significantly with the degree of hypoxia. These data suggest that the formation of RSV-IgE and release of histamine may adversely affect the outcome of RSV infection [53] . It is also reported that mononuclear leucocytes from normal individuals produce histamine-releasing factor (HRF) in response to exposure to RSV or influenza virus, suggesting that this cytokine, which causes degranulation of basophils and release of histamine, may play a role in the mechanism of virus-induced bronchospasm [54] .",

In animal studies, it is also shown that RSV infection results in airway hyperresponsiveness and enhanced airway sensitization to allergen [2] . The lungs become overinflated and the resting end-expiratory lung volume (functional residual capacity) is approximately twice normal [4] . As a result the diaphragm is depressed and flattened. In this position it functions least efficiently. Dynamic compliance is decreased, in part because the infant is breathing at a higher lung volume and hence on a stiffer portion of the volume-pressure curve of the lung, and in part because of the uneven distribution of resistances within the lung. The airway obstruction impairs gas exchange with hypoxia and hypercapnia as a result of ventilation perfusion mismatch. Fatigue of the respiratory muscles may be heralded by irregular breathing and can proceed very rapidly [1, 9] . These changes are very similar to that in asthma.",

A study of adults challenged multiple times with RSV highlights the difficulty in inducing protective immunity [55] . Seven of 15 adults challenged with an unattenuated group A virus 2 months after a natural group A infection became infected and shed virus with a pattern similar to natural infection, and five (85% of those infected) developed upper respiratory tract symptoms. With subsequent challenges, fewer (25-30%) became infected and shed virus for shorter times. Each infection appeared to provide some additional protection, but still about 50% of those infected after each challenge were symptomatic [55] . Natural infection therefore induces a very limited protective immune response [6] .",

In the adult volunteer study [55] , antibodies to the F protein and the homologous G protein and neutralizing antibodies correlated with protection from reinfection, but even at the highest levels of antibodies 25% of subjects could be reinfected. Infants responded to natural infection more slowly than older children and adults.

Most vaccine recipients who subsequently became infected with RSV developed severe lower respiratory tract disease and some died [78] .

Selective depletion of CD4 T cells abrogates the histological changes of 'enhanced disease' in the BALB/c mouse [81] . The recent report that enhanced disease might be caused by induction of TH 2 memory cells further supports the importance of the cellular immune response to this phenomenon [87] . Another recent report provided additional support for the role of the TH 2 cell response in enhanced disease [88] , which showed that a combination of anti-IL-4 and -10 antibodies, but not individual antibodies, eliminated the enhanced pulmonary pathology ususally seen in BALB/c mice. On the other hand, the similarities in the clinical manifestations between RSV bronchiolitis and allergic asthma and the fact that T cells from asthmatic patients stimulated by allergic antigens have a TH 2 phenotype make TH 2 cells attractive as contributors to the pathogenesis of RSV bronchiolitis [6] .",

When the cells from bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) of atopic asthma were probed for cytokines, IL-5 and IL-4 expression was increased in comparison to IL-2 and IFNg [89] . This lymphocyte profile is compatible with the TH 2 subpopulation. There is also a significant correlation between the numbers of T cells expressing mRNA for IL-4 and IL-5 in BAL and symptom scores or the degree of airflow obstruction in asthmatics [116] . Furthermore, IL-5 has been detected in the serum during acute exacerbations of asthma [117] . More recently, it is reported that individuals with either atopic or non-atopic asthma show infiltration of the mucosa with cells expressing TH 2 type cytokines (IL-4 and IL-5), providing further evidence for similarities in the immunopathogenesis of these clinically distinct forms of asthma [93, 94] .",

Interestingly, there is evidence in murine [118] and human [119] studies that the placental environment for the fetus is primarily a TH 2 -rich milieu. The fetus then is born with a tendency for TH 2 responses. It is believed that early infant infection, particularly bacterial, induces a switch from a substantially TH 2 response to TH 1 , and a recent study showed that RSVprimed lymph node cell (LNC) response consists of T helper cells which are predominantly of the TH 2 subset, secreting IL-4 [120] . These data suggest that RSV infection may perpetuate a 'fetal' TH 2 response, entraining an allergic diathesis in infants in response to infection. If such speculation is correct, then primary prevention of asthma would require immune modulation of early infant infection, such as RSV, which promotes a predominantly TH 2 response [121] .",
