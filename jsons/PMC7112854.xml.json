            "text": "The outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) in 2003 (Vijayanand et al., 2004) is associated with a newly discovered coronavirus, SARS-associated coronavirus (SARS-CoV) (Rota et al., 2003). Coronaviruses are exceptionally large RNA viruses and employ complex regulatory mechanisms to express their genomes (Holmes and Lai, 1996). The complete genome sequences of several SARS-CoV isolates have been determined (Marra et al., 2003, Rota et al., 2003). The genome structure, gene expression pattern and protein profiles of SARS-CoV are similar to those of other coronaviruses (Holmes and Enjuanes, 2003, Thiel et al., 2003). Nine SARS-CoV specific RNAs were synthesized in virus-infected cells (Thiel et al., 2003). These RNAs were predicted to encode two large replicative polyprotein (pp1a and pp1ab), four structural proteins (spike, membrane, envelope, and nucleocapsid proteins), and other auxiliary proteins. The four structural proteins of coronaviruses (S, E, M, and N) play roles in virion morphogenesis (Holmes and Lai, 1996). N binds to viral RNA to form nucleocapsid. Co-expression of M and E proteins together can form virus-like particles (de Haan et al., 1998a). Interactions between the M and E proteins and nucleocapsids result in virus budding through cellular membrane. By interaction with M protein, the S protein is incorporated into the viral envelope and the mature virions are released from the cells. It has also been demonstrated that virus-like particles of SARS-CoV could be formed by expressing M and E proteins in insect cells (Ho et al., 2004).",

            "text": "The mechanisms of SARS pathogenesis are largely unknown and may involve both viral cytocidal effects on the cells and immune-mediated mechanisms (Lai, 2003). To understand the humoral immune response against SARS-CoV infection, the antibody profile against various SARS-CoV structural proteins in different time course during SARS-CoV infection needs to be examined. It has been demonstrated that different treatments (e.g. heating, 2-ME) would promote the unfolding of structural proteins in other coronaviruses (Callebaut and Pensaert, 1980, Deregt et al., 1987, Hogue and Brian, 1986, Sturman et al., 1980, Wege et al., 1979). Therefore, both denaturing (Ma et al., 2002, Makowski and Ramsby, 1997) and non-denaturing treatments (Lin et al., 1998) should be used for antigen preparations. Nucleocapsid and spike proteins can be detected using Western blotting analysis by either denaturing condition (sample buffer containing 67.5 mM Tris\u2013HCl (pH 6.8), 5% 2-mercaptoethanol, 3% SDS, 0.1% bromophenol blue, 10% glycerol, treatment at 100 \u00b0C for 10 min) or non-denaturing conditions (sample buffer containing 50 mM Tris\u2013HCl (pH 6.8), 100 mM dithiothreitol, 2% SDS, 0.1% bromophenol blue, 10% glycerol; no boiling treatment) while membrane protein could only be detected in non-denaturing but not denaturing condition (Lo et al., 2005). In the present study, factors affecting the detection of SARS-CoV membrane protein in SDS-PAGE were investigated.",

The absence of membrane protein in WB could be due to conformational change through the breaking of intramolecular disulfide bond within this protein under denaturing condition. To verify this possibility, three Cys residues within the membrane protein (a.a. 63, 85, 158) were mutated into Ala residues individually. However, mutation of Cys residues within the membrane protein individually does not affect the detection of this protein (Fig. 1A). Thus, intramolecular disulfide bond formation is not responsible for the failure to detect the membrane protein in WB analysis. Heating at 100 \u00b0C for 10 min (boiling) in denaturing condition was suspected to be responsible for the failure to detect the membrane protein by WB analysis. To verify this possibility, membrane protein was treated under different conditions (without 2-ME but boiling, with 2-ME but no boiling) and then analyzed by WB (Fig. 1B). The results shown in Fig. 1B confirm that boiling but not 2-ME treatment results in failure to detect the membrane protein in WB analysis. The effect of heating at different temperatures on the membrane protein was also studied (Fig. 1C). It is failure to detect SARS-CoV membrane protein as monomers after treated with temperature over 80 \u00b0C.",

The possibility of conformational change causing recognition by the antibody is ruled out by the observation that in vitro translated, S35-labeled membrane protein would also lose its signal at the expected size after boiling (data not shown). This conclusion is strengthened further when different tag peptides added to the N- or C-terminus of membrane protein (M-V5-His; C-M-V5-His; M-C-V5-His) do not affect the detection of membrane protein in WB using antibodies against these tag peptides (data not shown).",

Similar to the un-treated sample, the membrane proteins in pre-treated samples were detected at a lower level as monomers in WB analysis after boiling (data not shown, Fig. 2A) though 2% SDS pre-treatment did reduce the effect. This result suggests that boiling treatment directly causes the failure to detect the membrane protein in WB analysis. Boiling will not breakdown the primary structure of proteins in the regular denaturing buffer (Schultz and Liebman, 1997). Furthermore, no suspected degraded products from the membrane protein (i.e. proteins smaller than the membrane protein) were detected after boiling (data not shown and Fig. 2B). Therefore, protein aggregation is probably the cause that leads the failure to detect the membrane protein in WB analysis. To test this possibility, the recombinant membrane protein fused with V5-His tag were expressed transiently in mammalian cells and analyzed by WB using monoclonal antibody against V5 tag in both stacking and separating gels. In Fig. 2B, the recombinant fusion membrane protein could be detected in stacking gels but not separating gels after boiling treatment. The same results were obtained when different recombinant fusion proteins (M-C-V5-His or C-M-V5-His) were used for the assays (data not shown). The existence of recombinant fusion protein after boiling could also be demonstrated by immunofluorescence of M-C-V5-His or C-M-V5-His (data not shown) using antibody against core protein. Therefore, the failure to detect the membrane protein in WB analysis is due to the thermal aggregation of this protein. The protein band marked by the thin arrow (Fig. 2A) is unglycosylated M* protein while the other one marked by the thick arrow is glycosylated M* protein since the latter protein will reduce its size to that of the former one after deglycosylation treatment (Ma et al., 2005).",

In a previous study (Rota et al., 2003), SARS-CoV membrane protein, unlike nucleocapsid or spike proteins, is hardly detected when virus particles were analyzed by SDS-PAGE. It is possible that SARS-CoV membrane protein is still abundant in the virions and could not enter the separating gel due to aggregation induced by boiling. It has also been demonstrated that heat can inactivate the SARS-CoV (Rabenau et al., 2004). The thermal aggregation of the membrane protein may be one of the reasons for this inactivation since protein aggregation often results in loss of their functions (Hoffner and Djian, 2002, Ishimaru et al., 2003, Lin et al., 2004, Murphy, 2002).",

Moreover, the thermally aggregated membrane proteins were not dissociated by 1% Triton-X 100, 6 M urea, or 2% SDS (Fig. 4B). These results indicate that extensive interaction between membrane proteins were involved during the aggregation. This possibility is strengthened when various recombinant membrane proteins with deletion in different regions were co-expressed in mammalian cells and analyzed by WB to study the interaction of different protein molecules (Fig. 4A). Similarly, membrane proteins with smaller size (marked by dotted line in Fig. 3A and B) possibly derived from full-length protein also could not be aggregated in the presence of full-length protein. These results suggest that thermal aggregation of membrane protein requires extensive interaction between hydrophobic regions of membrane protein. This interaction may cause the conformational change of the aggregated membrane proteins. This possibility was supported by the observation that recombinant M-V5-His fusion protein could be detected before but not after boiling treatment by immunoflurescence using anti-His antibody (though M-C-V5-His or C-M-V5-His could be detected by anti-core) (data not shown).

There are many \u03b2-sheet structures within membrane protein (Hu et al., 2003). These structural characteristics are similar to those of proteins linked to neurodegenerative diseases: \u03b2-amyloid, prion, and huntingtin (Murphy, 2002). However, it is still unknown whether SARS-CoV membrane protein could aggregate without boiling (it may occur with a slower rate). Further studies are needed to address this issue. Myoglobin (Yan et al., 2003), hemoglobin (Yan et al., 2004), and oat globulin (Zhao et al., 2004) were demonstrated to aggregate by heat treatment at different temperatures. At present, it is not known whether a similar mechanism is involved in the aggregation process of these proteins. To study the assembly mechanism or the atomic structures of the aggregated membrane protein, purified recombinant SARS-CoV membrane proteins are needed. On the other hand, unlike the aggregation of light neurofilament (Lin et al., 2004), the SARS-CoV membrane proteins could not dissociate from aggregates to monomers by 1% Triton-100 (Fig. 4B).

(A) Membrane proteins in either wild type or mutation in individual Cys residue could easily be detected in non-denaturing (nd) but not denaturing (d) treatment. Protein transiently expressed in Vero E6 cells were equally aliquoted and treated in different conditions. Serum of one SARS patient was used as first antibody in WB analysis. Proteins marked by the thick arrow are the glycosylated SARS-CoV membrane protein, the same size as the membrane protein from purified SARS-CoV particles (virions). (B) Boiling but not 2-ME treatment is responsible for the inefficient detection of membrane protein in WB analysis. Sample preparation and detection are the same as that of (A).

There are many distinct protein bands other than unglycosylated and glycosylated M proteins. These protein bands may represent the cellular proteins interacting with M protein during non-denaturing condition. The interaction between cellular proteins and M protein is disrupted in the presence of denaturants (6 M urea or 2% SDS).

(A) Various recombinant fusion proteins (M*, M51-221*, M1-170*, M51-170*, and M\u039451-170*) were transiently expressed in the cells. Proteins were collected and heated at different temperatures (20, 60, 80, and 100 \u00b0C) for 10 min. After that, the samples were analyzed by WB using anti-V5 monoclonal antibody. The proteins marked by the thin arrow are unglycosylated recombinant membrane proteins while the other ones marked by the thick arrow are glycosylated recombinant proteins. The protein smaller than unglycosylated membrane protein (marked by dotted line) containing the C-terminus of recombinant membrane protein may be derived by cleavage from precursor recombinant membrane proteins or translation by internal initiation. In any case, it was not produced by heat treatment since its concentration did not increase after heat treatment.
