Quax* 149 -157 Directed Evolution of Bacillus subtilis Lipase A by Use of Enantiomeric Phosphonate Inhibitors: Crystal Structures and Phage Display SelectionSuicidal selection: Mutants of Bacillus subtilis lipase A were displayed on bacteriophages. Dual selection with the aid of (S)-(+)-and (R)-(\u00c0)-IPG stereoisomers coupled to phosphonate suicide inhibitors was used to isolate variants with inverted enantioselectivity. The 3D structures of the inhibitor-lipase complexes were determined, providing structural insight into the mechanism of enantioselectivity of the enzyme.I. A. Uns\u00e7ld, S.-M. Li*",

Here we introduce a new chemical probe that permits focal, two-photon uncaging of IP 3 in living cells (see scheme).C. Binkert,* M. Frigerio, A. Jones, S. Meyer, C. Pesenti, L. Prade, F. Viani, M.

Both have two Tfm groups that replace the native isobutyls and are low-nanomolar inhibitors of plasmepsin II (PM II) with good selectivity against human cathepsins D and E. The structural effects and role of the Tfm group were investigated by solving the crystal structures of PM II bound to the bis-Tfm pepstatin A analogues. J. S. Grinstead, S.-T. D. Hsu, W. Laan, A. M.
