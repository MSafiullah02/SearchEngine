            "text": "It has been known that angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) is the main host cell receptor of COVID-19. ACE2 is expressed in type II alveolar cells of the lungs, absorptive enterocytes from the ileum and colon, esophagus upper and stratified epithelial, kidney proximal tubule cells, myocardial cells, bladder urothelial cells, and epithelial cells of the oral mucosa (Zou et al. 2020; Xu et al. 2020). The high expression of ACE2 could be a potential risk factor for infection routes of COVID-19. As a result of COVID-19 infection, many patients develop acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), which may lead to multiple organ damage. These symptoms are associated with a cytokine storm syndrome, which might cause triggered T helper1 (Th1) cell responses. Many studies suggested that high concentrations of interleukin (IL)-1, IL-1B, IL-2, IL-6, IL-7, IL-8, IL-10, IL-12, IL-13, IL-17, granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (GCSF), interferon-\u03b3 inducible protein 10 (IP-10), macrophage inflammatory protein 1-\u03b1 (MIP-1\u03b1), tumor necrosis factor-\u03b1 (TNF-\u03b1), monocyte chemoattractant protein 1 (MCP-1), and IFN-\u03b3 could be found in COVID-19 infected patients (Conti et al. 2020; Chen et al. 2020a; Liu et al. 2020; Huang et al. 2020).",

            "text": "Vitamin D has been known to play a critical role in the immune system. Vitamin D receptor has been expressed in multiple organs and tissues including the heart, lungs, kidneys, liver, nervous system, intestine, bone, parathyroid gland, cardiovascular system, and myocardium (Prufer et al. 1999). Vitamin D (Fig. 1) could prevent multiple organ damage caused by COVID in the following five ways:Vitamin D decreases the production of Th1 cells (Cantorna and Mahon 2005; Schleithoff et al. 2006; Ardizzone et al. 2009). Thus, it can suppress the progression of inflammation through reducing the generation of inflammatory cytokines such as IL-6, IL-8, IL-12, and IL-17 (Chastre and Fagon 2002; Society et al. 2005; Palmer et al. 2011). Vitamin D also decreases the generation of TNF\u03b1 and nuclear factor-\u03baB (NF\u03baB) (Peterson and Heffernan 2008; Talmor et al. 2008). Moreover, 1,25(OH)2D, biological active form of vitamin D, directly inhibits gamma interferon (IFN-\u03b3) and IL-2 (Provvedini et al. 1983; Tsoukas et al. 1984). Vitamin D can reduce cytokine storm syndrome in patients with severe COVID-19 infection and thus prevent multiple organ damage.It was demonstrated that during viral infection, inactive vitamin D form can be converted to active form by the alveolar epithelial cells, and expression of the host defense gene cathelicidin increases (Hansdottir et al. 2008). Cathelicidins were shown to have a protective effect against lung damage due to hyperoxia (Jiang et al. 2020). Vitamin D could reduce the risk of COVID-19 infection by inducing the production of cathelicidin and defensins, which reduce the survival and replication of viruses.In human with primary and secondary kidney disease and in mice with diabetes, increased ACE2 expression was demonstrated (Ye et al. 2004; Lely et al. 2004). Vitamin D treatment was shown to inhibit ACE2 expression in the kidney (Ali et al. 2018). 1,25-(OH)2D3 exhibited renoprotective effect by decreasing ACE1 and ACE1/ACE2 ratio in streptozotocin-induced diabetic nephropatic rats (Lin et al. 2016). In other words, vitamin D treatment can suppress ACE2 expression in kidney tubule cells, thereby preventing COVID-19 entry into the cell in diabetic patients and protecting the kidney.Angiotensin II (Ang II) is a natural peptide hormone in the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system. It is best known for increasing the blood pressure through stimulating aldosterone and its systemic vasoconstriction (Li et al. 2004). ACE2 directly catalyzes Ang II, thereby lowering its levels. COVID-19 infection may downregulate ACE2, which in turn could lead to excessive accumulation of Ang II. High levels of Ang II may cause ARDS, myocarditis, or cardiac injury (Hanff et al. 2020). Renin, on the other hand, is a proteolytic enzyme and a positive regulator of Ang II. Vitamin D is a potent inhibitor of renin (Li et al. 2004). A study reported that vitamin D receptor-lacking mice had elevated levels of renin and Ang II (Li et al. 2004). Indeed, vitamin D supplement was shown to prevent Ang II accumulation and to decrease proinflammatory activity of Ang II by suppressing the release of renin in patients infected with COVID, thus reducing the risk of ARDS, myocarditis, or cardiac injury (Hanff et al. 2020).Epidemiology studies reported that mortality and severity of COVID-19 virus infection are strongly correlated with older people and male. It is known that especially in children, the risk of developing COVID-19 infection is lower and symptoms are less severe. A recent study examined the relationship between ACE2 expression in the lungs, and age 3-month-old mice significantly increased ACE2 expression when compared with 24-month-old mice (Booeshaghi and Pachter 2020). It has been shown that ACE2 expression decreases dramatically in male and female rats, and this decrease is also higher in female rats compared with male rats (Xudong et al. 2006). ACE2 expression is generally higher in females than in males and tends to reduce with age (Chen et al. 2020b). Children have higher ACE expression than adults (Beneteau-Burnat et al. 1990). The high incidence of COVID-19 infection in the older people and men may be associated with low ACE2 expression.",

A single high-dose preoperative treatment with oral vitamin D was reported to prevent ARDS by reducing postoperative pulmonary vascular permeability index (Parekh et al. 2018). A study showed that vitamin D exhibits direct protective effect on alveolar epithelium, and decreased the death of the type 2 alveolar epithelial cells in lipopolysaccharide-induced ARDS mouse model; also, supplementation of vitamin D before the oesophagectomy prevents ARDS by reducing alveolar capillary damage, in clinical setting (Dancer et al. 2015). Another study demonstrated that vitamin D treatment was shown to have protective effect on the lungs by inhibiting renin, ACE, and Ang II level, and increased ACE2 level expression in acute lung injury model in animal (Xu et al. 2017). Calcitriol (1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3) may enhance the expression of ACE2 by pronouncedly impact on ACE2/Ang(1\u20137)/MasR pathway (Cui et al. 2019).",

A study reported that northern latitudes are associated with higher hospitalization rate and mortality rate for COVID-19 worldwide, because vitamin D deficiency is more prevalent in people who live in Northern countries (Panarese and Shahini 2020). There are negative correlations between mean levels of vitamin D in different countries and the number of COVID-19 cases (Ilie et al. 2020). On the other hand, in the body, a decrease in serum vitamin D level may worsen the clinical results of patients with COVID-19 and an increase in serum vitamin D level may improve clinical outcomes in those patients (Alipio 2020).",

ACE2 protein treatment inhibited the spreading of SARS and also protect patients with SARS infection from developing lung failure (Kuba et al. 2006). Moreover, a single dose of recombinant human ACE2 treatment prevents pulmonary arterial hypertension both in clinical and preclinical study (Hemnes et al. 2018).
