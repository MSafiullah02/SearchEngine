Illness and suffering are part of the human condition, and physicians, nurses, and other healers have been needed throughout time, and are especially needed today. Some of you who care for adults as well as children and teens are still in the thick of COVID-19 infections. I am fearful that the policies of \"opening up\" that are being promoted by many politicians are happening in the context of still rising rates of infection. When we listen to the authorities who base their recommendations on science, we hear that the effect will be even greater numbers of infections and deaths. 2 The current effect of COVID-19 on our PAG patients here in California is determined by the fear that parents have of coming to our offices and hospitals. COVID infections in the San Francisco Bay Area appear to have peaked, and the surge in adult patients was mostly avoided through early shelter-in-place orders. 3 Fortunately, children and teens appear to have less severe infections, although concerns about specific morbidities are being raised. But unfortunately, \"routine\" healthcare is now being neglected, sometimes with the results that patients with emergent problems are presenting later than they otherwise would. While our operating rooms are now open, patients and families are still deferring the surgeries that had been postponed. I am eager to institute some of the elements of enhanced recovery after surgery that are described in this issue of the Journal of Pediatric and Adolescent Gynecology (JPAG). 4 Our patients are still experiencing the usual PAG concerns that are also addressed in this issue: symptomatic labial adhesions, 5 prepubertal vaginal bleeding, 6 chronic pelvic pain, 7 sexually transmitted infections, 8 issues related to contraception and induced abortion, [9] [10] [11] [12] [13] [14] adnexal masses, 15,16 differences of sex development, 17 and M\u00fcllerian anomalies, 18, 19 among many other problems. The NASPAG Position Statement, published in this issue, highlights the ongoing reproductive health needs of adolescents during a pandemic, including the need for contraception and confidential healthcare, even when using telehealth platforms.",

The psychological aggressions that she described included manipulation and coercion, which she ultimately recognized. Reproductive coercion may not always be recognized. One of the reasons that I devised my structure of a first gynecologic visit in which I speak first with the adolescent and her parent (usually mom), then with the parent(s) with the teen, and subsequently with the adolescent confidentially, completing the visit with a summary of the visit (sometimes with parameters elicited from the teen about what is permissible to share with the parent) is that I learned how valuable the parent's perspective can be. 21 I remember one of the first moms who opened my eyes to the value of a parent's perspective when mom described her daughter's boyfriend as belittling her and undermining her daughter's self-esteem. I realized that had I spoken only to the daughter, I might not have heard that assessment.",
