This has led to immense stress and uncertainty in the lives of individuals suffering from obesity. It has made them more vulnerable to over-eating and sedentary lifestyle, thus predisposing them to further weight gain. Currently, social media is flooded with weight-based memes and weight stigmatizing content. Thus, further reinforcing the bias that individuals suffering from obesity may be lazy and less active and have less will-power [1], internalization of these weight-biased attitudes in media portrayals has been shown to cause adverse effects on psychological health, leading to more depression and anxiety, low self-esteem, body image issues, and disordered eating [2].",

Obesity is an underlying factor for type 2 diabetes, hypertension, cardiovascular disease, renal disease, and venous thromboembolism and has a detrimental effect on lung function. A pro-inflammatory state coupled with malnutrition may lead to impaired immune response in patients suffering from obesity and increased susceptibility to all influenza viruses including COVID-19 [7]. Even though the evidence regarding this is still inadequate, this hypothesis has been one of the biggest deterrents for advising against bariatric surgery to patients suffering from obesity during COVID-19 pandemic. Though this line of action is intended to protect our patients, it does add to the stigma against them. Currently with no end in sight for COVID-19 pandemic and bariatric surgery services coming to a standstill, patients suffering from obesity will have to bear this additional burden of being labelled as high risk. To make matters worse, we leave them with no significant options to be able to reduce their risk status. While the world battles with COVID-19 pandemic, obesity pandemic continues to have a huge impact on general health and mortality. Weight loss is extremely important to reduce the health risks, and surgery is currently the only way to achieve that. Bariatric surgery has a positive impact on quality of life and survival that is at least comparable with cancer surgery [8].",

Bariatric surgery for treatment of severe obesity should be no different. As COVID-19 pandemic continues to create disruption in our lives, it is high time that we give a thought to creating systems through which we can help our patients. We need to use technology to its full potential so that we can spread positive messages, encourage our patients online, and change the tone of social media messaging. Most importantly, we need to develop strategies for risk stratification for our patients and ensure protection of healthcare workers before we move forward. As a community taking care of patients suffering from obesity, this should be our topmost priority for eventually, we need to do right by our patients.",
