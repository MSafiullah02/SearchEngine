Has it undergone any changes since its first discovery? These questions are critical for us to find cures and design effective vaccines, and critical for managing this virus. The study of COVID-19 began only recently [1] [2] [3] [4] [5] [6] . So far, pioneering studies related to the virus have been limited to a few complete genome sequences and a few related viruses [7] [8] . One study used six COVID-19 sequences from patients in Wuhan and compared them with those of SARS and MERS [9] . Another two studies used nine and five sequences respectively, and found that COVID-19 is similar to SARS [10] [11] . These pioneering efforts paved the foundation for this work, which involves 377 complete genome sequences, covering 194 genomes isolated from COVID-19 in human hosts from 21 countries, 21 genomes from animals and the environment, 101 genomes from the previously known flu-causing coronavirus (HCov-229E (3 genomes), HCov-OC43 (78 genomes), HCov-NL63 (16 genomes) and HCov-HKU1 (4 genomes)), and 61 genomes from seven potentially lethal pathogenic P3/P4 viruses, SARS (11 genomes) , MERS (11 genomes) , Victoria (5 genomes), Lassa (6 genomes), Yamagata (5 genomes), Ebola (11 genomes) , and Dengue (12 genomes) . This collection allows us to analyze the evolution of COVID-19 in depth.",

On the contrary, COVID-19 shares a moderate sequence similarity to the flucausing coronaviruses, despite reported similar symptoms. Strikingly, we observed the divergence of the COVID-19 strains isolated from human hosts has steadily increased from December 2019 to March 2020, suggesting COVID-19 is now actively evolving in human hosts. This may potentially explain the differences in the death rate in different areas, as the virus might have evolved into strains of different lethality. From all existing complete genome sequences of COVID-19 in humans, we derived the first common model for the COVID-19 sequences that represents the shared sequences of all 194 human COVID-19 strains, which will be critical to inform the future studies of vaccines and antibody design. Geographic and time-course analysis of the evolutionary trees of the human COVID-19 reveals heterogeneous evolutional relationships among strains from 21 countries and identified 13 virus strains that are very likely to be linked to or can potentially help the researchers find the first generation COVID-19 virus. Overall, the findings in this paper provide important information to the understanding and the management of COVID-19 and also to the development of vaccines for the virus in the near future.",

We compared the similarities between the complete genome sequences of COVID-19 and those of the seven pathogenic P3/P4 viruses (SARS, Lassa, MERS, Victoria, Yamagata, Ebola and Dengue). Two similarity metrics were employed, LCS (Eq. 1) and LD (Eq. 2) (described in Methods). The information about these viruses including the strain name, serial number, data source, sampling time, sampling location, and sequence length, is provided in Tables S8-S14 in supplementary materials. Fig. 1 (A) shows the average similarities (LCS/LD) of the sequences of COVID-19 and the seven P3/P4 viruses, which are 0.825863/0.795447 for SARS, 0.341151/0.340103 for Lassa, 0.693463/0.570777 for MERS, 0.426403/0.418833 for Victoria, 0.426455/0.418873 for Yamagata, 0.500381/0.472106 for Ebola and 0.340755/0.339583 for Dengue. It can be observed that SARS have higher similarities with COVID-19, followed by MERS. We would like to highlight that COVID-19 and Ebola shares a fewer similarity. As we will see later, the similarity between COVID-19 and Ebola is even smaller than that of between COVID-19 and that of other flu-causing viruses. This inspires us to reflect about the roadmap of alternative medicines and therapies that we should develop for COVID-19. ",

            "text": "As a high similarity between sequences often implies a close relationship, to further investigate the inherent relationships among various viruses, we first compute the MLCS (Multiple Longest Common Subsequences) of all sequences from each type of virus using our I-MLCS tool (discussed in Methods) as the common models or shared representations of the 15 types of viruses. We then calculate the similarity matrix using the LCS similarity metric between the 15 types of viruses, shown in Table 1 . Using the similarity matrix, we construct a fully connected weighted graph shown in Fig. 2 (A) for the 15 types of viruses, where a vertex represents a type of virus, and the weight of each edge is the similarity between the two connected vertices. We then cluster the graph using the hierarchical clustering algorithm AGNES [12] . The clustering result is given in Fig. 2 We may infer that different viruses that reside in the same cluster are closely related. To verify this inference, we build their evolutionary trees for these viruses' complete genome sequences in the clusters using the MEGA 6.0 tool, which are shown in Fig. 3 . Fig. 3 (A) shows an evolutionary tree for the cluster with the cluster members, Nos. 9, 10 and 11, which are very similar to each other. Fig. 3 (B) shows another evolutionary tree for the cluster with cluster members, Nos. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 14, and 15 , which are also very similar to each other. For each cluster, we build five random trees. In building each tree, we randomly select one virus sequence from each virus type (e.g., one sequence from each of the Nos. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 14 , and 15 viruses) and feed them into MEGA 6.0. As the resulting 5 trees for each cluster all have the same structure, only one tree is shown in Fig. 3 (A) or Fig. 3(B) . The rest are given in supplementary materials (Evolutionary trees of COVID-19 strains and viruses' cluster/Clusters' evolutionary trees). Note that since Nos. 8, 12, and 13 are far from each other (which is difficult to see in Time-course analysis of COVID-19 in human host reveals active divergence in humans from December 2019 to March 2020",

The sample sources are illustrated in Fig. 4 , and the details about these sequences are given in Table S3 in We calculated the average similarities between the sequences of COVID-19 strains across samples collected from different months. Although the overall similarity of these human strains is high, we observed a reduction of similarity in later months, indicating mutations within the human population is already occurring ( Table 2 ). In Dec. 2019, the similarity was on average 0.999054, corresponding to an average of 29.75 nucleotide differences. In Mar. 2020, this number has dropped to 0.988468, corresponding to an average of 348.33 nucleotide differences. Such changes imply evolutional changes of this virus, which might result in attenuation or more virulent strains. This difference is statistically significant (p<0.0026). The detailed similarity analysis results (i.e., similarity matrices) of the 194 COVID-19 sequences are also given in supplementary materials (Similarity Matrices). These results lead to an important conclusion: the COVID-19 has already begun its divergence in the human population, which potentially explains the underlying differences in virulence and alerts us to consider this divergence in designing antibodies and vaccines.

For the rest 20 countries, we randomly selected one strain from each country. We also ensured that every sequence from every country has appeared in the 85 experiments at least once. The 21 resulting sequences for each experiment are then fed into MEGA 6.0 to compute the evolutionary tree of the sequences. A virus strain from any country that has appeared as a first generation strain in any of the 85 evolutionary trees is given in Fig. 5(A) , with its country, serial number and sequencing date attached. We found 21 such strains from 10 countries (all in Fig. 5(A) ). Fig. 5 (A) also uses a time line to order and to mark these 21 strains' sequencing dates. We would like to stress that due to our experiment setting above, any sequence that can possibly be in the first generation of the COVID-19 virus has at least one chance to appear in an evolutionary tree, which means that no possible first generation strain is missed. As examples, 2 (out of 85) generated evolutionary trees are shown in Fig. 5 This above set of experiments has narrowed down the search for the first generation COVID-19 virus strains to the 21 strains (or sequences) in Fig. 5(A) . However, we still do not know the relationships of these 21 strains or sequences. We thus perform another computational experiment, i.e., using only these 21 strains to build an evolutionary tree. Fig. 6 shows the output evolutionary tree. We can observe that three strains from China and the strains from Germany, Australia, Cambodia, Singapore and Nepal are not likely to be first generation strains. These exclusions are also cross-verified with the 85 evolutionary trees discussed above. The rest 13 strains (China (7), Thailand (2), Japan (2), USA (1), and South Korea (1)) are very likely to belong to and/or can lead us to find the first generation COVID-19 virus strains and the origin of the virus, for which further investigation is needed. It is also interesting to see that those strains from Japan, South Korea, and the USA appear among the first generation strains although they were sequenced much later than the others. ",
