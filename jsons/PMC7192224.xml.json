Most studies have been conducted in Europe and the USA, and scant data are available from other parts of the world. Different techniques, such as serology, viral culture, PCR and RT\u2010PCR have been used to detect viruses. Currently, PCR and RT\u2010PCR are being widely used due to their better capacity for detection compared with conventional viral culture and serology.\n7\n\n",
