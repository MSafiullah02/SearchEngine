As the outbreak of Covid-19 became pandemic, many liver centres worldwide have faced the challenge of management of patients with liver diseases [3] and concerns have been raised particularly for immunocompromised patients. This is mainly based on previous data on the higher risk of severe respiratory viral infections in patients treated with immunosuppressive medications [4, 5] . However, preliminary experience from Bergamo, Lombardy, suggests that immunosuppressed patients are not at increased risk during Covid-19 infection [6] ; also, Chinese data from the epicentre of the infection show that even patients with chronic liver disease where only a minority among those infected with Covid-2019 [2] .",

Indeed, patients with stable chronic AILD on long-term therapy are at low risk of complications and/or progression. While available data may suggest that immunosuppressed patients are not at increased risk of ARDS [6] , a flare of AIH secondary to unnecessary drug reduction/withdrawal, would require a higher dose of steroids and thus potentially increased risk of infection. In this low-risk scenario, we suggest to: (i) postpone follow-up visits until the emergency is over; (ii) be proactive in sending general information and recommendations to your patients (i.e. mailing list) ahead of time; (iii) use web-based consultation upon request in addition to telephone-based consultations; and, (iv) organize drug dispensation with the local pharmacy for therapy maintenance.",

We therefore suggest to: (i) organize an independent flow for urgent access to the hospital in order to avoid any contact with Covid-19 positive patients (e.g. avoid access through the general emergency department); (ii) limit invasive procedures such as endoscopy to emergency interventions avoiding screening, and follow local protocols in case of emergencies (i.e. obstructive jaundice, bleeding) [7] ; (iii) start standard therapy at the usual dose for treatment of acute flare of AIH; (iv) coordinate care in case of hepatic failure with the regional Transplant Centre; finally, (v) in case of infection reduce immunosuppression -particularly antimetabolites in those with lymphopenia -and be timely in tapering steroids. Careful hospital hygiene procedures should be followed, and outpatient follow-up care organised in order to keep hospitalization as short as absolutely necessary.",
