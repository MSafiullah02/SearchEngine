The latter two are positive\u2010sense single\u2010stranded RNA ((+)ssRNA) viruses. We will briefly introduce the proteases of three (+)ssRNA virus families here, namely Picornaviridae, Coronaviridae, and Flaviviridae. This will be followed by a description of the complex signaling pathways that lead from recognition of the viral intruders to the production of antiviral cytokines, such as type\u2010I and type\u2010III interferons (IFNs). Finally, we will discuss the mechanisms by which the viral proteases interfere with these signaling pathways.",

As of March 2017, this family contains 35 genera with 80 species 1. The genera Enterovirus, Hepatovirus, Aphthovirus, and Cardiovirus have been well investigated. Picornaviruses can cause several severe diseases in man and animals, such as poliomyelitis, hepatitis, and encephalitis. The viral genome usually encodes a polyprotein comprising regions P1, P2, and P3 (Fig. 1A) 2, 3. The P1 region includes the structural proteins, while the latter two comprise nonstructural proteins, including the enzymes required for polyprotein processing and RNA replication. P1, P2, and P3 are further cleaved by viral proteases into mature proteins. P1 is digested to 1A (also known as VP4), 1B (VP2), 1C (VP3), and 1D (VP1); P2 is processed to 2A, 2B, and 2C; whereas P3 becomes 3A, 3B, 3C, and 3D 2, 3. Picornaviruses encode up to three proteases, the 2A protease (2Apro), the 3C protease (3Cpro), and \u2013 in case of some family members (e.g. the genera Aphthovirus and Cardiovirus) \u2013 the leader protease (Lpro) (Fig. 1A) 4.",

Two recently emerged human coronaviruses from the subfamily Coronavirinae, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS\u2010CoV) and MERS\u2010CoV, can cause severe pneumonia. In particular, the latter virus frequently also leads to renal failure 5. Coronaviruses are enveloped +ssRNA viruses and have the largest genome (26\u201332 kb) of all known RNA viruses. The 5\u2032\u2010terminal two thirds of the genome contain the two open\u2010reading frames (ORFs) 1a and 1b. ORF1a codes for polyprotein 1a containing nonstructural protein 1\u201311 (Nsp1\u201311), while ORF1a and ORF1b together encode polyprotein 1ab comprising Nsp1\u201316. This latter mechanism features a (\u20101) ribosomal frameshift overreading the stop codon of ORF1a (Fig. 1A) 6. The 3\u2032\u2010proximal third encodes the structural and accessory proteins 7, 8. These two polyproteins are processed into 15 or 16 mature Nsps to form the replication/transcription complex. This step is performed by two types of viral proteases, namely, one or two papain\u2010like proteases (PLpro(s)) located within Nsp3, and a main protease (Mpro) (Nsp5), which is frequently also called \u20183C\u2010like protease\u2019 (3CLpro) (Fig. 1A; see 9 for a review).",

The genome of HCV is about 9.6 kb in size and encodes a polyprotein precursor that is processed by host and two viral proteases to yield four structural (C, E1, E2, and p7) and six nonstructural proteins (NS2, NS3, NS4A, NS4B, NS5A, and NS5B). These two viral proteases are the NS2 autoprotease (NS2pro) and the NS3/NS4A protease (NS3/NS4Apro) 10, 11. NS4A is a cofactor for the NS3 protease. In HCV, the latter enzyme is also called NS3/4Apro in many publications; however, we will use \u2018NS3/NS4Apro\u2019 in what follows, in order to be consistent with the NS2B/NS3pro notation in the flaviviruses.",

The typical chymotrypsin fold consists of two \u03b2\u2010barrel domains, each containing six \u03b2\u2010strands. The catalytic residues are located in the cleft between these two domains. Picornavirus 2Apro\n16, 3Cpro\n17, 18, 19, HCV NS3/NS4Apro\n20, flavivirus NS2B/NS3pro\n21, 22, and pestivirus NS3/NS4Apro\n23 adopt this fold; however, the former two enzymes are cysteine proteases, while the latter three are serine proteases. The coronavirus Mpro (3CLpro) also possesses a chymotrypsin\u2010like fold, but with an additional \u03b1\u2010helical domain; furthermore, dimerization of this cysteine protease is a prerequisite for its activity (Fig. 2B) 9, 24. However, the picornavirus Lpro\n4, 25 and the coronavirus PLpro\n9, 26, 27 feature a papain\u2010like fold. The canonical papain\u2010like fold contains an \u03b1\u2010helical and a predominantly \u03b2\u2010sheet domain, with the active site located in the cleft between them. This is exactly what is found in the picornavirus Lpro\n4, 25, whereas in the coronavirus PLpro, the \u03b2\u2010sheet domain is larger and further divided into two subdomains: fingers and palm. Together with the thumb subdomain (\u03b1\u2010helical domain), they form an extended right\u2010hand fold. In addition, a ubiquitin\u2010like (Ubl) domain is located at the N terminus of the PLpro (Fig. 1B) 9, 26, 27.",

However, the role of TANK in regulating the NF\u2010\u03baB pathway is a matter of debate. Chariot et al. 103 reported that TANK binds IKK\u03b3 (NEMO) and upregulates the NF\u2010\u03baB pathway. Blocking the TANK\u2013IKK\u03b3 interaction by deleting the TANK\u2010binding domain of IKK\u03b3 impairs NF\u2010\u03baB activation 103. However, Lys63\u2010linked polyubiquitination of TRAF6 is required for NF\u2010\u03baB activation 104. Wang et al. 105 proposed that TANK acts as a negative regulator of the NF\u2010\u03baB pathway by inducing TRAF6 deubiquitination.",

Huang et al. 106 reported that NF\u2010\u03baB signaling increased when TANK was processed by EMCV 3Cpro. According to Wang et al.'s proposal 105 (see above), the explanation might be that the degradation of TANK can release TANK\u2013TRAF6\u2010mediated NF\u2010\u03baB inhibition. From the same group, Huang et al. 107 reported that the EMCV 3Cpro can disrupt the TANK\u2013TBK1\u2013IKK\u03b5\u2013IRF3 complex by cleaving TANK, thus decreasing type\u2010I IFN production. It is of interest to further investigate the reason why the EMCV 3Cpro processes TANK to stimulate the NF\u2010\u03baB pathway but downregulate the IRF3 pathway. Very recently, Qian et al. 96 showed that the SVV 3Cpro processes TANK at two cleavage sites, Glu272\u2193Phe273 and Gln291\u2193Gly292. Whereas the former site is unusual because of the large P1' residue, the latter is also cleaved by the EMCV 3Cpro, indicating that it may be a conserved target on TANK for different picornavirus 3Cpros.",

In this review, we discussed the roles of viral proteases from the families Picornaviridae, Coronaviridae, and Flaviviridae in counteracting host innate immune responses. Among the different PRR\u2010mediated signaling pathways, a large body of data is available for components of the RLR and TLR pathways being cleaved by viral proteases, but much less so for the NLR pathway (with the notable exception of MAVS in the NLRC2 pathway as a prominent target of viral proteases). A possible reason for this could be that at this time, many immunity\u2010related functional roles of NLRs remain unclear. Another observation is that a multitude of reports exist on the proteolytic cleavage of components of the innate immune system by the picornaviral 2Apro and 3Cpro as well as the HCV NS3/NS4Apro, while proteolytic cleavage by the coronavirus proteases PLpro and 3CLpro (Mpro) seems to be comparatively rare. This may be due to more research having been performed on the picornaviruses and on HCV, or to the fact that the DUB activity of the coronavirus PLpro (as opposed to its proteolytic activity) is a very efficient player in counteracting the innate immune response. Furthermore, it should be remembered that CoVs feature many other proteins (such as ORF3b, ORF6, the nucleocapsid protein, the membrane protein, and the X domain in SARS\u2010CoV; ORF4a, ORF4b, ORF5, and the membrane protein in MERS\u2010CoV) that are involved in suppressing IFN production 124, 178, so proteolytic cleavage of host immunity proteins is perhaps required to a lesser extent here. For picornaviruses and HCV on the other hand, there is only occasional reports on nonproteases, such as the picornaviral 2C and 3A proteins 179, 180 as well as HCV NS5A and E2 181, 182, being involved in diminishing cytokine production.",

Nonstructural proteins are shown in green, with the exception of proteases, which are shown in black. Picornaviridae : The 5\u2032 end of the picornavirus genomic RNA is covalently bound to VPg (viral protein genome\u2010linked). The genome encodes a polyprotein comprising the three regions P1 (structural proteins), P2, and P3 (nonstructural proteins). Generally, two viral proteases, 2Apro and 3Cpro, cleave the polyprotein into mature proteins. P1 is processed to yield 1A (VP4), 1B (VP2), 1C (VP3), and 1D (VP1); P2 is processed to 2A, 2B, and 2C; while P3 cleavage products are 3A, 3B, 3C, and 3D. *In some picornavirus genera (e. g. Aphthovirus, Cardiovirus), a third viral protease exists, the leader protease (Lpro). It auto\u2010cleaves itself from the polyprotein. Coronaviridae:CoVs possess the largest genome of all known RNA viruses. The 5\u2032 genomic RNA carries a methylated cap. Two open\u2010reading frames (ORFs), 1a and 1b, occupy the 5\u2032\u2010terminal two thirds of the CoV genome. ORF1a encodes the polyprotein 1a (Nsp1\u201011), while ORF1a plus ORF1b are translated into the polyprotein 1ab (Nsp1\u201016); this involves a (\u20101) ribosomal frameshift overreading the stop codon of ORF1a (indicated by the black arrow). The 3\u2032\u2010proximal third encodes the structural and accessory proteins. The polyproteins pp1a and pp1ab are processed by the viral proteases PL\npro (within Nsp3; Nsp3 is purple) and Mpro (3CL\npro, Nsp5). The genomes of members of the Flaviviridae differ between genera. Here, a genome of a member of the genus Flavivirus is shown as an example. The 5\u2032\u2010capped genome encodes a polyprotein, which is cleaved into three structural proteins as well as seven nonstructural proteins by host and viral proteases. Flaviviruses have only one protease, the NS2B/NS3pro. NS2B is a cofactor for the NS3 serine protease. (B) Structures of proteases of +ssRNA viruses. The fold of most RNA\u2010virus proteases belongs to either the chymotrypsin\u2010like class or the papain\u2010like class. The chymotrypsin fold consists of two \u03b2\u2010barrel domains, while the typical papain\u2010like fold contains an \u03b1\u2010helical domain and a predominantly \u03b2\u2010sheet domain. The catalytic residues are located in the cleft between the two domains in both chymotrypsin\u2010like and papain\u2010like proteases. Picornavirus 2Apro, 3Cpro, coronavirus 3CL\npro (Mpro), HCV and pestivirus NS3/NS4Apros, as well as flavivirus NS2B/NS3pro, adopt the chymotrypsin\u2010like fold, whereas picornavirus Lpro and coronavirus PL\npro feature the papain\u2010like fold. 1) The structure of enterovirus D68 3Cpro\n19 (PDB entry: 3ZV8).

The catalytic dyad Cys\u2013His (C\u03b1 atoms shown as yellow and blue spheres) is located within the chymotrypsin\u2010like subdomain of each monomer.

The actions of viral proteases of three (+)ssRNA virus families, namely Picornaviridae, Coronaviridae, and Flaviviridae, are illustrated by triangle and square symbols. Triangles indicate cleavage of the target protein, while squares symbolize interaction with this protein in the absence of cleavage. Blue spheres indicate phosphorylation, and (Ub)x means polyubiquitination. (A) The TLR (Toll\u2010like receptor), RLR (retinoic acid\u2010inducible gene\u2010I (RIG\u2010I)\u2010like receptor), and NLR (nucleotide\u2010binding oligomerization domain (NOD)\u2010like receptor) signaling pathways. TLR7 detects ssRNA and triggers downstream signaling via the adaptor, MyD88 (myeloid differentiation primary response gene 88). Subsequently, MyD88 recruits IRAK4 (interleukin\u20101 receptor\u2010associated kinase 4) to activate IRAK1/2, then IRAKs dissociate from MyD88 and bind to TNF receptor\u2010associated factor 6 (TRAF6). TRAF6 activates TAK1 (TGF\u2010\u03b2\u2010activated kinase 1). TAK1 further recruits TAB1/2/3 (TAK1\u2010binding protein 1/2/3), to activate IKK\u03b1/\u03b2/\u03b3 (I\u03baB kinase alpha, beta, and gamma; IKK\u03b3 is also named NEMO). Then, the IKKs mediate the phosphorylation of I\u03baB, the NF\u2010\u03baB inhibitor. Phosphorylated I\u03baB is degraded and releases NF\u2010\u03baB to induce production of TNFs (tumor necrosis factors) and other cytokines. This pathway thus comprises TLR7\u2192MyD88\u2192IRAK4/1/2\u2192TRAF\n6\u2192TAK1/TAB1\u20133\u2192IKK\u03b1/\u03b2/\u03b3\u2192I\u03baB\u2192NF\u2010\u03baB. Also, TRAF6, IRAK4, TRAF3, IKK\u03b1, and IRAK1 form a complex. In this complex, both IKK\u03b1 and IRAK1 activate the IRF7 (interferon regulatory factor 7) but not the IRF3 pathway (see red arrows). TLR3 detects dsRNA and triggers TRAF3 and TRAF6 by the mediator, TRIF (TIR domain\u2010containing adaptor protein\u2010inducing IFN\u03b2). TRAF3 activates the TBK1/IKK\u03b5 (TANK\u2010binding kinase 1/I\u03baB kinase epsilon)\u2010mediated IRF3/7 pathway. TANK (TRAF family member\u2010associated NF\u2010\u03baB activator) and IKK\u03b3 can activate TBK1/IKK\u03b5. TBK1/IKK\u03b5 further stimulate the IRF3/7 pathway. In addition, STING (stimulator of interferon genes) can upregulate IRF3 signaling. The main cascade of this pathway thus comprises TLR3\u2192TRIF\u2192TRAF\n3\u2192TBK1/IKK\u03b5\u2192IRF3/7. TRAF6 and TRAF3 are typed in bold to indicate that they are located at central positions of pathways. The downstream cascade of TRAF6 activating the NF\u2010\u03baB pathway is the same as for the TLR7 pathway. RLRs detect ssRNA/dsRNA and trigger the activation of TRAF3 and TRAF6 by the mediator, MAVS (mitochondrial antiviral\u2010signaling protein; also known as IPS\u20101, Cardif, VISA). The downstream signaling pathway is the same as for the TLR3 pathway. NLRs include NLRP3 and NLRC2 (also named NOD2). NLRP3 does not directly bind the viral RNA. The viral ssRNA or dsRNA causes many intracellular changes (such as reactive oxygen species (ROS) formation and lysosomal maturation), NLRP3 is sensitive to these changes and forms oligomers interacting with ASC (apoptosis\u2010associated speck\u2010like protein) and procaspase\u20101, collectively called \u2018inflammasome complex\u2019. Subsequently, procaspase\u20101 is activated, thus leading to the maturation of pro\u2010IL\u20101\u03b2 and pro\u2010IL\u201018. NLRC2 directly interacts with ssRNA, then it recruits MAVS to activate the IRF3 pathway. Also, it can activate TRAF6 to stimulate the NF\u2010\u03baB pathway. (B) The JAK\u2010STAT signaling pathway. IFN\u03b1 or IFN\u03b2 are produced via the IRF3/7 pathway. They bind the IFNAR1/2 (interferon alpha/beta receptor 1/2), leading to the activation of TYK2 (tyrosine kinase 2) and JAK1 (Janus kinase 1). These kinases phosphorylate STAT1 (signal transducer and activator of transcription 1) and STAT2. Subsequently, the phosphorylated STAT1/2 interact with IRF9 to form ISGF3 (IFN\u2010stimulated gene factor 3). This ternary complex enters the nucleus and promotes the expression of ISGs (interferon\u2010stimulated genes), such as ISG15, to establish the antiviral status. ISG15 covalently binds target proteins (ISGylation). Coronavirus PL\npro can remove ISG15 from ISGylated proteins. Other proteins and abbreviations in this figure: Riplet: an E3 ubiquitin ligase and upstream regulator of RIG\u2010I; MFN 1/2: mitofusins 1/2. MFN1 and MFN2 regulate mitochondrial fusion; MFN1 is required for the RLR signaling pathway; IMP\u03b21: importin \u03b21, a nucleocytoplasmic transport receptor, plays roles in the nucleocytoplasmic trafficking of IRF3 as well as NF\u2010\u03baB p65; MDM2: a p53 degradation stimulator blocks the p53\u2013IRF7\u2013IFN\u03b2 signaling pathway; ADNP: activity\u2010dependent neuroprotective protein, a transcription factor, can bind to IFN\u03b1 promoter sites (IPS) upon induction by Lpro; MC: mitochondrion; ER: endoplasmic\u2010reticulum.",
