A transthoracic echocardiogram obtained due to dyspnea showed a mildly reduced cardiac ejection fraction of 45%-50%, and the patient was treated with diuretics. Head computed tomography scanning for an acute stroke was negative. Given his acute hypoxemia and risk of pulmonary embolism in the setting of malignancy, he was empirically started on anticoagulation, which was discontinued after a highresolution computed tomography scan of the chest was negative. Given a high serum ferritin level (>13,000), acute transaminitis, hypertriglyceridemia, and persistent AMS, the possibility of hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (HLH) was raised. A bone marrow biopsy was performed on hospital day 11, but pathology findings were unremarkable, as were studies for heavy metal exposures (e.g., iron and copper). Although autoimmune testing by a paraneoplastic panel was negative, the patient was given 2 days of empiric intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIg) starting on hospital day 16, with mild improvement in mental status. However, the IVIg was discontinued the following day when he acutely decompensated with hypoxemia, hypertension, and flash pulmonary edema. He was treated with aggressive diuresis and antihypertensive medications and re-institution of IVIg with no Page 2 of 4 improvement. A repeat EEG was abnormal with possible seizure activity, so the patient was started on levetiracetam, with improvement in the EEG but no improvement in his mental status.",
