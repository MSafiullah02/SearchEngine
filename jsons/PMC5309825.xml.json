TLR3 expression increased with 0.1 \u03bcg/ml but was markedly increased following treatment with 1 \u03bcg/ml LPS, and the increase in TLR3 expression trended back to the basal level at 10 \u03bcg/ml LPS (Fig. 1A,B). As shown in Fig. 1C, a 1 \u03bcg/ml LPS challenge of AM\u03a6 from WT mice was associated with an increase in TLR3 protein expression at 4 h and a more marked increase at 6 h, while the increase in TLR3 expression trended back to the basal level at 8 h. The TLR3 mRNA expression changes shown in Fig. 1D paralleled the protein expression changes. In addition, we obtained the same results using quantitative PCR (Fig. 1E,F). These results suggest that LPS, a TLR4 ligand, can induce TLR3 expression in AM\u03a6.",

However, in AM\u03a6 from TLR4\u2212/\u2212 mice, LPS failed to induce TLR3 expression (Fig. 2A), indicating that TLR4 signaling mediates the LPS-induced up-regulation of TLR3. All TLRs, with the exception of TLR3, utilize MyD88, and TLR4/MyD88 signaling pathway is the primary signaling pathway used to induce the expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines17. However, TLR4 can signal through both MyD88-dependent and -independent pathways, and the MyD88-independent signaling for TLR4 results in the production of type I IFNs18. To address the role of MyD88 in mediating the LPS-TLR4-induced up-regulation of TLR3, LPS (1 \u03bcg/ml) was administered to AM\u03a6 from MyD88\u2212/\u2212 mice, and TLR3 expression was assessed. As shown in Fig. 2A, MyD88 deficiency prevented LPS-induced up-regulation of TLR3. The changes in the mRNA expression of TLR3 are shown in Fig. 2B, and these results corresponded to the observed changes in protein expression. As shown in Fig. 2C, the localization of TLR3 was further investigated in AM\u03a6 by immunofluorescence. In the absence of LPS, TLR3 was found within small vesicles throughout the cytoplasm. TLR3-containing vesicles increased in a time-dependent manner in AM\u03a6 from WT mice, but not in TLR4\u2212/\u2212 or Myd88\u2212/\u2212 mice, and similar results were observed using quantitative PCR (Fig. 2D).",

We assessed permeability at 4, 6, 8, and 10 h after LPS/Poly I:C administration. As shown in Fig. 7A, at the 8 h time point, either LPS (Group 3) or Poly I:C (Group 2) alone caused a slight increase in permeability in WT mice when compared to the saline (SAL) control (Group 1). In contrast, LPS/Poly I:C (Group 4) caused a further increase in alveolar-capillary permeability in WT mice when compared with the LPS/SAL group. In TLR4\u2212/\u2212 mice (Group 5), alveolar-capillary permeability was markedly attenuated in response to LPS/Poly I:C challenge compared with WT mice (Group 4). The alveolar-capillary permeability was similar to the results observed for LPS alone (Group 3) when TLR3\u2212/\u2212 mice were used (Group 6). As shown in Fig. 7B, the histopathology of lung tissues was also assessed 8 h following LPS/Poly I:C administration. Injection of LPS at time 0 followed by a saline injection (Group 3) at 4 h caused marked changes in lung histopathology at 8 h. A saline injection at time 0 and a Poly I:C injection (5 \u03bcg/g body weight, intratracheally administered) at 4 h resulted in minimal changes (Group 2). However, the sequential injection of LPS at time 0 and Poly I:C injection at 4 h (at a time when TLR3 was up-regulated) in WT mice (Group 4) led to augmented changes in histopathology, including diffuse interstitial edema and inflammatory cell infiltration, compared with the single LPS or Poly I:C challenge. In contrast, the sequential injection of Poly I:C at 4 h after LPS failed to induce augmented histopathology changes in TLR4\u2212/\u2212 mice (Group 5) compared with WT mice. In addition, we did not observe augmented histopathology changes in TLR3 mice (Group 6) and instead observed a change similar to that observed for LPS alone (Group 3). Taken together, these data show the important role of LPS/TLR4 signaling in the up-regulation of TLR3 expression in ALI.",

            "text": "Synergy between viral and bacterial TLR signaling, which leads to amplification of the inflammatory response, has been reported previously28. Additionally, Tian X. et al. found that Poly I:C enhanced susceptibility to secondary pulmonary infections by bacteria29. Co-stimulation with LPS and Poly I:C markedly enhances the immune response, although the mechanism for this combined effect remains poorly understood. Alexopoulou L. et al.16 found that when LPS was injected intraperitoneally, TLR3 expression in lung tissue was dramatically up-regulated, which suggests that the expression of TLR3 is inducible. Pan et al.30 provided direct evidence that LPS induces TLR3 expression via a TLR4-MyD88-IRAK-TRAF6-NF-\u03baB-dependent signaling pathway in human peripheral blood monocytes and monocytic cell lines, such as THP-1 cells. Furthermore, we observed that LPS could induce TLR3 expression in a dose- and time-dependent manner in AM\u03a6. The stimulation of TLR4 by LPS induces the release of critical proinflammatory cytokines that are necessary to activate a potent immune response. Indeed, LPS/TLR4 signaling has been intensively studied in recent years313233. In our study, the role of TLR4 signaling in regulating TLR3 expression was clearly shown using TLR4\u2212/\u2212 mice. LPS challenge in WT mice induced the up-regulation of TLR3, whereas this response was impaired in TLR4\u2212/\u2212 mice. The major adaptor molecules that bind to the intracellular domain of TLR4 are MyD88 and TRIF3435, and our results showed that MyD88 mediated the TLR4-TLR3 cross talk, as LPS challenge of MyD88\u2212/\u2212 mice failed to induce TLR3 expression. Furthermore, the activation of NF-\u03baB was associated with an increase in TLR3 expression after LPS challenge and a reduced expression of TLR3 in AM\u03a6 in which NF-\u03baB was inhibited by IKK-NBD. Therefore, these results demonstrate an important role for TLR4-MyD88-NF-\u03baB in mediating TLR3 expression.",

            "text": "ALI is caused by an uncontrolled systemic inflammatory response that results from direct (aspiration, pneumonia, ventilation-induced lung injury, etc.) or indirect injury (sepsis, hemorrhagic shock, etc.), leading to the activation of AM\u03a6 and the sequestration of neutrophils3. Excessive recruitment of leukocytes is critical to the pathogenesis of ALI. Neutrophils are the first leukocytes to be recruited to sites of inflammation in response to chemokines released by activated AM\u03a636. Specifically, stimulation of AM\u03a6 leads to the release of chemokines, which induce neutrophils to migrate from the intravascular space across the endothelium and epithelium into the airspaces27. According to the relative position of the cysteine residues, chemokines have been classified into four subfamilies (CXC, CC, C, and CX3C). Among these, MIP-2, which is also known as CXCL2, is thought to play a major role in mediating neutrophil recruitment37. Belperio J.A. et al.38 found that lung expression of MIP-2 was correlated with lung injury and neutrophil sequestration during the pathogenesis of ventilation-induced lung injury, and CXCR2\u2212/\u2212 mice show a marked reduction in neutrophil sequestration and lung injury. Additionally, MIP-2 was shown to be up-regulated in the lungs and BALF of animals, which was associated with neutrophil accumulation in the lungs after LPS administration394041. Furthermore, Villar J. et al. showed that a CXCL2 polymorphism is associated with better outcomes in patients with severe sepsis42. In the present study, we observed that LPS/TLR4 signaling up-regulated TLR3 expression in AM\u03a6. This cross talk between TLR4 and TLR3 in AM\u03a6 resulted in the amplification of cytokine (IL-6, TNF-\u03b1) and chemokine (MIP-2, MCP-1) expression in response to LPS and Poly I:C, which activate TLR4 and TLR3, respectively, and subsequently led to enhanced PMN sequestration into the lung, which was found to be correlated with ALI based on the assessment of alveolar-capillary permeability and histological sections of lung tissue. Thus, the present study demonstrates a novel mechanism by which LPS can induce AM\u03a6 to up-regulate TLR3 expression, through a TLR4-Myd88-NF-\u03baB-dependent pathway, thereby sensitizing AM\u03a6 to TLR3 ligands and promoting enhanced lung inflammation (Fig. 8).",

            "text": "In clinical scenarios, a variety of pathogens are involved in lung infections. In particular, viral infections are a significant risk factor for acquiring bacterial infections4344. TLR3 is thought to be a major mediator of the cellular response to viral infection, because it responds to dsRNA, a common by-product of viral replication45. TLR3 has been implicated in infections by mouse cytomegalovirus (MCMV), reoviruses, lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus (LCMV), and influenza A virus (IAV)9. TLR3\u2212/\u2212 mice are more resistant to lethal West Nile virus, a mosquito-borne ssRNA flavivirus, which causes human disease of variable severity46, and show reduced inflammation and lethality upon IAV infection4748. Thus, up-regulation of TLR3 may contribute to an increased lung immune response to viral infection following a bacterial infection. Despite the relatively well-known role of viral infections in promoting bacterial infections, it is still not clear whether bacterial infections also promote viral infections. Therefore, our results are the first to offer new insight into this topic. There is also a growing body of evidence showing that most patients have a mixture of bacterial and viral infection4950, and the cross talk between TLR4 and TLR3 induces a synergistic inflammatory response in cases of mixed infection. Cameron R.J. et al.49 found that bacterial and viral pathogens interact to cause additional increases in inflammatory markers and an exacerbation of disease severity in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). TLR3 has been shown to respond to dsRNA, a replication intermediary for many viruses, but the heterologous RNA released from necrotic cells or that is generated by in vitro transcription, such as mRNA, also stimulates TLR3 signaling and induces immune activation. Indeed, Cavassani KA15 observed TLR3 activation during experimental polymicrobial sepsis and ischemia gut injury in the absence of an exogenous viral stimulus, and TLR3\u2212/\u2212 mice were protected from the lethal effects of sustained inflammation. Moreover, treatment with a TLR3 antibody could attenuate the tissue injury associated with gut ischemia and significantly decrease sepsis-induced mortality. Therefore, TLR3 serves as a regulator of the amplification of the immune response as well as an endogenous sensor of necrosis, independent of viral activation. Our study showed that up-regulation of TLR3 significantly amplified IL-6, TNF-\u03b1, MCP-1, and MIP-2 expression, which then enhanced PMN migration and finally led to ALI.",

            "text": "TLR cross talk has obvious advantages for the host in protecting against infectious agents, because it enhances the initial immune reaction to pathogen infection and better primes the host for mounting a more robust adaptive immune response. The concept that multiple TLR-ligand interactions are required for effective host resistance to pathogens has important implications for the design of vaccinations and immunotherapies against infectious diseases. Several studies have convincingly shown the improved efficacy of treatment with multiple TLR ligands compared with single TLR ligands in stimulating cellular immune responses in vivo. For example, co-administration of poly I:C and CpG ODNs increased serum cytokine production in a mouse tumor model when compared to the administration of either of the ligands alone51. Bone-marrow-derived DCs exposed to both poly I:C and a TLR7 ligand more effectively stimulated cytotoxic T lymphocyte responses compared to DCs exposed to either TLR ligand alone52. These studies provide an important conceptual foundation to examine the protective efficacy of multiple TLR-ligand combinations in vaccines against infectious diseases. However, synergistic amplification of the inflammation response may be detrimental, because it can result in immune over-activation, which hampers immune homeostasis. As a consequence of an overactive response, the function of various organ systems may be compromised, resulting in multiple organ dysfunction syndrome (MODS) and death. Cytokines (TNF-\u03b1 and IL-6) are important components of the immune system because they act as messengers between cells, but they are also involved in many pathological aspects of the cascade leading to systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS) and ultimately MODS. According to the two-hit hypothesis53, patients who survive the initial inflammatory insult may die following a relatively minor second event that would not normally be life-threatening. In this study, viral (poly I:C) stimulation as a relatively minor secondary insult, led to an exaggerated secondary inflammatory response. Thus, understanding the mechanism of this two-hit phenomenon may help to devise novel therapeutic strategies to prevent overwhelming and life-threatening inflammatory conditions such as septic shock and trauma-induced SIRS.",

All mice used are on a C57BL/6 background. All experimental protocols involving animals were approved by Institution Animals Care and Use Committee of Tongji and Pittsburgh University. The experiments were performed in accordance with the National Institutes of Health Guidelines for the Use of Laboratory Animals. Mice were 8\u201312 weeks of age at the time of experiments and were maintained on standard rodent chow and water ad libitum. Animals were anesthetized with 100 mg/kg ketamine and 10 mg/kg xylazine administered intraperitoneally. Animals were intratracheally administered LPS (5 \u03bcg/g body wt; Escherichia coli O111:B4; Sigma, St. Louis, MO) in 50 \u03bcl of saline (SAL) or SAL at first time, then after 4 h intratracheally administered Poly I:C (5 \u03bcg/g body wt; 31852-29-6; Invivogen) in 50 \u03bcl of saline (SAL) or SAL alone at the second time using a MicroSpray syringe. The animals were randomly in one of four groups: SAL/SAL, SAL/Poly I:C, LPS/SAL, and LPS/Poly I:C. At various time points, a 20G sterile catheter was inserted into the trachea to collect bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) as previously described54. Blood samples were immediately obtained by cardiac puncture and transferred to the laboratory for analysis of cytokines (IL-6, TNF-\u03b1), chemokines (MIP-2, MCP-1) in serum and BALF by ELISA. PMN counts in BALF were determined on Wright-Giemsa-stained slides. Briefly, total cell counts were determined on a grid hemocytometer. Then a total of 500 cells were counted in cross-section per sample, and the number of PMNs was calculated as the total cell count times the percentage in the BALF sample. The lungs were rapidly removed from all mice and washed in ice-cold saline. Half of the lung tissues were stored at \u221280 \u00b0C prior to biochemical analyses including MIP-2 expression in lung lysates was measured by Western blotting and RT-PCR, while the other half of the lung tissue was fixed in 4% formalin solution in preparation for histopathological analyses. For histological analysis, lung tissue samples were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS overnight at 4 \u00b0C. The samples were then dehydrated, embedded in paraffin, and cut into 5 \u03bcm sections. After deparaffinization, the tissues were stained with hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) for histological analysis. Lung sections were scored for lung injury, including the following: (1) alveolar and capillary edema, (2) intravascular and peri-bronchial influx of inflammatory cells, (3) thickness of the alveolar wall, and (4) hemorrhage. The items were semiquantitatively scored as none, minimal, light, moderate, or severe (score 0, 1, 2, 3 or 4, respectively) by a pathologist blinded to the experimental group. The lung injury score was obtained by averaging the score from the animals within each group.",
