Clinical recognition is limited because the symptoms of RSV illness are similar to those of other respiratory viruses, and highly sensitive diagnostic tests for RSV are not routinely performed. Furthermore RSV diagnostic tests, especially rapid-antigen tests, are less sensitive in adults compared to children because of much lower levels of virus that are shed [5] . A surveillance study identified 211 RSV infections in healthy adults from 1975 through 1995; 84% were symptomatic, and one quarter of the symptomatic infections involved the lower respiratory tract [6] . A prospective cohort study involving 608 healthy older adults over 4 winter seasons (2000) (2001) (2002) (2003) reported an annual RSV incidence of 3% to 7% in the cohort; RSV generated fewer office visits than influenza [7] . Other studies [8] [9] [10] have assessed the presence of RSV in samples collected from patients with acute respiratory illness in emergency or inpatient settings. In contrast, data characterizing the population incidence and burden of RSV illness among older adults are scarce.",

Potential participants with illness duration .7 days (.10 days in 2006-07) were excluded to minimize false negative test results. Research coordinators used an electronic appointment system to screen chief complaints and identify potential participants in primary care departments at the Marshfield Clinic main campus and a satellite clinic. Eligible patients were also recruited from the Emergency Department and at the time of admission to the only acute care hospital serving the study population (St. Joseph's Hospital). Many patients who were not approached during the clinical encounter were contacted by phone on the following day if they received an International Classification of Diseases, Version 9, Clinical Modification (ICD-9) diagnosis code indicating acute respiratory illness (codes available on request).

We used electronic ICD-9 diagnosis codes for acute respiratory infections (i.e. MAARI codes) to identify these patients (specific list available on request). For each person in the cohort, respiratory illness visits were classified as either absent (0 visits) or present ($1 visit) based on the presence or absence of a relevant MAARI code during the study enrollment period. The number of RSV episodes among nonenrolled cohort members was estimated by multiplying the proportion RSV positive (among enrolled individuals) by the number of nonenrolled individuals with a MAARI episode (defined by ICD-9 codes). Although rare, a few enrolled patients did not receive a diagnosis code for acute respiratory illness because eligibility was based on presenting symptoms rather than diagnosis codes.

We calculated the numerator as the sum of enrolled participants with RT-PCR confirmed RSV and the estimated number of non-enrolled cohort members with RSV based on the assumptions listed above. Analytic weights were created by extrapolating RSV positivity proportions for enrolled patients with MAARI episodes to other nonenrolled cohort members with MAARI episodes within strata defined by age group (50-59, 60-69, and $70 years), gender and season. Enrolled patients with no MAARI episodes were assigned analytic weights of 1.0. The analytic weights were then multiplied by the appropriate state level adjustment factors as described above. The offset terms were stratified by season, age group and gender. Within each stratum, the offset was the natural logarithm of the following quantity: number of cohort members divided by the sum of analytic weights.

Of these 13,355 (65%) were in all 4 seasons; 2,452 (12%) were in 3 seasons, and 2,313 (11%) were in two seasons. The mean age (6SD) of community cohort members was 64 years (612) at the beginning of each season and 53% were female ( Table 1 ). The age, gender, congestive heart failure (CHF) and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) distributions were similar between the cohort of eligible adults and enrolled RSV infected patients. The percent of community cohort members who had a MAARI episode during the enrollment period (including those not enrolled) ranged from 6% to 12% (Table 2 ). There were 1,326 eligible enrollments across all seasons for adults $50 years old, and 164 (12%) were positive for RSV. Clinical characteristics of the RSV infections have been previously reported [17] ; 93% presented with cough, 79% with nasal congestion, 65% with fever, and 51% with wheezing. Among the 164 RSV positive cases, 154 (94%) received at least one MAARI diagnosis code; the remaining 10 patients had a chief complaint of acute respiratory illness but did not receive a MAARI diagnosis code. The mean and median age of RSV infected patients was 64.2 and 61.5 years, and 101 (62%) were female ( Table 1 ). The median interval from symptom onset to enrollment was 4 days for both for those testing positive and those testing negative for RSV. Seven (4%) of 164 RSV cases had preexisting CHF and 7 (4%) had COPD; 14 (9%) had RT-PCR evidence of infection with another virus in addition to RSV. Ten (6%) of 164 patients with RSV were hospitalized within 14 days after illness onset. The enrollment period included the peak week of RSV activity in Wisconsin during every season, and the proportion of statewide cases that occurred during the enrollment period varied from 56% to 99% (Figure 1 ). Across all seasons, medically attended RSV incidence (cases per 10,000 persons per season) was 154 (95% CI, 132-180) ( Table 3 ).

Medically attended RSV incidence increased with increasing age group (p = 0.048, chi-square test for trend). For persons of age 60 years and greater, the incidence was 176 (95% CI, 144-214). There was no consistent trend in RSV incidence over time during the four seasons that were included in this analysis (Table 2) .

The study was limited by the need to make assumptions regarding the proportion of non-enrolled cohort members with RSV, and the number of RSV cases that occurred outside the enrollment window each season. The assumption regarding non-enrolled patients was supported by our observation that seven common diagnosis codes accounted for 82% to 90% of all codes given during acute respiratory illness visits for both enrolled and nonenrolled individuals with any acute respiratory illness. The assumption regarding the proportion of cases occurring outside each seasonal enrollment window was necessarily based on test results from the Wisconsin State Laboratory of Hygiene.",

            "text": "RSV infections can be particularly severe in adults with chronic disease [1, 7] , but laboratory diagnosis of RSV remains uncommon. The results of this study identify RSV as a common cause of acute respiratory illness among community-dwelling older adults in the outpatient setting. The time lag we observed between the statewide RSV peak and the peak incidence in our population of older adults is consistent with a prior study in the United Kingdom that compared the incidence of lower respiratory tract infection in adults with the number of RSV positives based on clinical testing over 10 seasons [23] . In both Marshfield and the United Kingdom, there was a time lag of a few weeks between the peak RSV occurrence based on clinical testing (largely in children) and the peak incidence in older adults during most seasons. These findings suggest that children may be an important source of RSV transmission to older adults, and interventions to prevent RSV in children may also benefit the older adult population. Greater knowledge regarding the epidemiology and burden of RSV disease in older adults will be useful for future vaccine development and licensure.",
