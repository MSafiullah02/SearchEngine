Until the advent of the antibiotic era, GAS was a major cause of death in industrialized countries due to fatal epidemics of scarlet fever, sepsis, and rheumatic heart disease (RHD). The 1980s saw an increase in rheumatic fever cases in the Rocky Mountain states of the United States, along with an apparent resurgence in severe GAS disease in industrialized countries.1 The subsequent awareness of GAS disease in recent years has also brought to focus its disproportionately high burden in resource-limited settings, especially in tropical regions. The severe implications of advanced RHD and the existence of effective strategies for prevention and treatment highlight the need for better data to accurately determine worldwide burden.2, 3\n",

Compared with the incidence in developed urban settings, which may be as low as one episode per 8 child years, the incidence in resource-limited settings may be four to eight times higher.2 GAS colonization has been detected in the oropharynx of approximately one in eight school-aged children; lower rates occur below the age of 5 years (\u22485%), with groups C and G streptococci being more common. Approximately one-third of school-aged children who present with a sore throat will have GAS as the causative organism; this declines to <15% in adulthood. In temperate climates, there is significant seasonal variation in the rates of GAS pharyngitis, peaking during winter/early spring. In tropical climates, the seasonal variation appears to be less marked, although robust data are lacking.4 It is unclear as to whether other factors affect this (e.g., increased viral transmission or crowding).5 Impetigo is common in childhood; transmission occurs readily in school and pre-school care settings, especially during summer in humid locations. In tropical settings where the burden is particularly high, almost half of children can have impetigo at any one time.6\n",

Erysipelas does not appear to have a predilection to changes in climate and has a bi-modal incidence affecting the young and the elderly.

However, aberrant immune responses to otherwise benign GAS infection of the throat or skin can result in the immune-mediated manifestations: ARF, RHD, and APSGN. In ARF, cross-reactive antibodies are thought to arise in genetically predisposed individuals infected with rheumatogenic GAS strains. These immune-mediated responses affect the endocardial, synovial, and neural tissue resulting in the syndrome of ARF.12 Recent genome-wide association studies have identified an association between RHD and polymorphisms of the gene encoding the immunoglobulin heavy chain, specifically the IGHV4-61 segment in certain populations.14 Impetigo is suspected to cause ARF, although this has not been proven. Case reports exist to support the possible link between a patient with GAS impetigo and concurrent group C Streptococcus (GCS) pharyngitis suffering from ARF.15 Further work is required to clarify a definitive link between impetigo and ARF, as well as the association between group C/G Streptococcus and ARF, as has been noted for APSGN.",

GAS uncommonly causes meningitis; most reports involve individuals with a pre-existing focus of GAS infection (e.g., pharyngitis, otitis media) or with other risk factors (e.g., skull defect or post-cranial surgery).17 Puerperal sepsis caused by GAS was a frequent cause of death in the pre-antibiotic era with outbreaks resulting from nosocomial transmission. Unlike group B Streptococcus, GAS more commonly affects the mother than the infant, manifesting as post-partum endometritis, peritonitis, septic thrombophlebitis, or bacteremia without focus.18 Chorioamnionitis, septic abortion, and neonatal sepsis have also been reported. A study in four tropical developing countries (Papua New Guinea, Ethiopia, the Gambia, and the Philippines) during the 1990s found that GAS was one of the three leading causes of bacteremia in newborns <90 days old, suggesting that peripartum infections remain common.19 Similarly, GAS was the third most common cause of bacteremia in neonates (behind Escherichia coli and group B Streptococcus) in a large prospective, population-based study in Kilifi, Kenya.20\n",

This is thought to occur in severe infections complicated by large bacterial loads, the Eagle effect.12 However, in instances where alternative antibiotics may be used because of differing mechanisms of action, they are generally given as an adjunct to\u2014rather than in replacement of\u2014penicillin therapy. Erythromycin and the newer macrolides have been used for GAS infection where individuals have immediate hypersensitivity to penicillin. Macrolide resistance is common in some settings and can arise abruptly, apparently related to the population level of macrolide consumption. Some mutations confer resistance to both macrolides and clindamycin, but these remain uncommon.5\n",

            "text": "In populations in whom ARF is now rare, antibiotics for the routine treatment of GAS pharyngitis is contentious because of the usually self-limiting nature of the illness. A Cochrane systematic review suggested that treatment of a sore throat with antibiotics reduces symptoms by 32% on day 3 and 51% on day 7, although it was noted that 82% of controls have self-resolved by day 7. It was noted that treatment decreased the risk of rheumatic fever by 73% and the risk of peritonsillar abscess by 85%; however, in low-incidence settings, the numbers needed to treat to prevent complications are likely to be very large. Therefore the aim of antibiotic treatment, if used, is alleviation of symptoms and shortening the duration of illness. Treatment of GAS pharyngitis is essential in populations with a high incidence of ARF and, if diagnostic facilities are limited, empiric treatment of all sore throat cases may be justified. The use of antibiotics to reduce the risk of subsequent APSGN is limited due to insufficient studies.26 Treatment recommendations are detailed in Table 40.4\n. Ten days of twice-daily oral penicillin V or a single dose of intramuscular benzathine penicillin G (BPG) is the preferred treatment for GAS, although once-daily oral amoxicillin appears to be effective for symptom resolution and GAS eradication.5 Short courses (up to 5 days) of macrolides have been shown to have equivalent clinical and short-term microbiologic cure rates, but the risk of late microbiologic failure may be higher. There are insufficient data regarding the efficacy of short-course or non-penicillin regimens for preventing ARF. Treatment of impetigo may be with oral, intra-muscular, or topical antibiotics, although topical treatment is discouraged in high-prevalence settings because of the rapid emergence of antimicrobial resistance. A randomized controlled trial in north Australia showed non-inferiority of short-course oral trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole (co-trimoxazole) compared with the single-dose BPG. The co-trimoxazole group had improved clearance of staphylococci, including methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA).27 Options for treatment are given in Table 40.4.",

Urgent and aggressive debridement of non-viable tissues has been the cornerstone of management of GAS necrotizing fasciitis, along with intensive supportive care and antibiotics.23 Clindamycin is recommended as an adjunct to penicillin for the treatment of severe invasive GAS disease, including necrotizing infections, during the first few days of treatment. Clindamycin has multiple mechanisms of action, targeting protein synthesis as opposed to penicillin-binding proteins and exhibiting an inhibitory effect against super-antigens, thereby reducing the inflammatory response. Observational studies have demonstrated a benefit of clindamycin in reducing mortality in patients with necrotizing fasciitis.8 In instances where clindamycin is used, penicillin should always be given unless there is a history of hypersensitivity. Although supportive data are limited, administration of one or two doses of intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) early in the course of STSS is recommended. Although some studies have shown benefit of early IVIG for preventing the need for surgery in STSS, this should not delay early exploration and aggressive debridement, which remain the current recommended treatment in necrotizing fasciitis.23 IVIG is also recommended by some as adjunctive treatment in severe invasive GAS infections, even in the absence of toxic shock.",
