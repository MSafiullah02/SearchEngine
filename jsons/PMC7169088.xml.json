SARS is a new and probably previously unencountered severe and highly contagious form of atypical pneumonia, caused by a novel coronavirus known as SARS\u2010CoV.\n1\n, \n2\n Since February 2003, SARS has spread to 28 countries and has affected 8202 individuals resulting in 725 deaths worldwide.\n3\n Most of these cases occurred in Hong Kong, mainland China, Taiwan and Singapore, which totalled 1726, 5316, 585 and 206 cases, respectively.\n3\n Other regions in the Asia Pacific are also affected, although the numbers remain low in Malaysia (five cases) and Thailand (eight cases).\n3\n Although Canada has had the only major outbreak outside Asia (148 cases), and currently has largely contained SARS, there are still sporadic cases at the time of writing. The economic impact to Hong Kong has been devastating although the morale of medical and other healthcare workers remains high. Despite the declining incidence of SARS worldwide, the possible emergence of future \u2018super\u2010spreaders\u2019 should remind healthcare professionals and health authorities to stay vigilant, as only one or two of these index patients could trigger another major outbreak.\n4\n, \n5\n, \n6\n, \n7\n\n",

The initial hopes of a speedy delivery of a rapid and reliable diagnostic test for SARS have failed to materialize. Consequently, SARS requires a clinical diagnosis, at least in the initial but often critical stages of the illness.\n10\n, \n11\n, \n12\n Treatment for SARS is also controversial and prognosis for these patients is still unclear.

Although SARS\u2010CoV is likely to be predominantly transmitted by droplets, it is also likely to infect others via contaminated items, particularly as SARS\u2010CoV can live outside the body for several days.\n4\n, \n14\n A recent outbreak in Amoy Gardens, a densely populated residential estate in Hong Kong, also demonstrated that infected stools could transmit SARS\u2010CoV via defective sewage systems.",

Nevertheless, an electronically published article describing the autopsy results on six SARS patients described diffuse alveolar damage, macrophage infiltration and epithelial cell proliferation as the predominant features.\n15\n The earlier histological changes, performed on a ventilated patient by using video\u2010assisted thoracoscopic lung biopsy on day 5 of the illness, also revealed mild to moderate diffuse alveolar damage, manifesting as patchy hyaline membrane changes lining the alveolar ducts and some air spaces, and alveolar septal infiltration by neutrophils and mononuclear cells.\n4\n There is therefore no diagnostic histological feature, other than identification of SARS\u2010CoV by electron microscopy, which would provide a definitive diagnosis. Nevertheless, efforts should still be made, with strictest safety precautions in mind, to obtain histological or cytological samples from the lower respiratory tract of these patients, not only to exclude other mimicking conditions, but also to advance our understanding of this new disease.",

Some patients also present initially with bilateral and fairly extensive consolidation, despite clinically being not markedly dyspnoeic. A very small proportion of patients display bilateral ground glass pattern on initial presentation, and more rarely, might even have nodular shadows over the \u2018background\u2019 ground glass patterns (Fig. 1c). Up to 10% of our cases develop spontaneous pneumomediastinum, and this is often associated with the presence of fairly extensive disease and clinical deterioration (Fig. 2). While there is no definite pattern, most SARS patients would show deterioration of CXR and unremitting fever despite antibiotic therapy.

Naturally, the use of such therapy stirs anxiety in clinicians who face an overwhelming infection. Respiratory physicians in Hong Kong have amassed experience in the recent outbreak and generally concur that the use of high\u2010dose corticosteroids is beneficial in SARS patients who show radiographic deterioration. Needless to say, repeated use of such therapy in the later stages of the disease could be associated with severe secondary sepsis, notably fungal pneumonias (N. S. Zhong, pers. comm., 2003). A number of regimens have been used in Hong Kong. These include: (i) hydrocortisone 2 mg/kg q.i.d. or 4 mg/kg t.i.d. i.v. followed by low\u2010dose oral prednisolone; (ii) methylprednisolone 2 mg/kg q.i.d. or 4 mg/kg t.i.d. i.v. followed by oral prednisolone, and (iii) pulse methylprednisolone 500 mg i.v. daily for 5 days followed by maintenance oral prednisolone 50 mg b.i.d. reducing to 20\u201330 mg daily on day 21.\n4\n, \n7\n\n,\n\n26\n A very small proportion of patients, despite suffering from probable SARS and displaying virological evidence of acute SARS\u2010CoV infection, appear to have an indolent course of illness. These patients could be treated initially with oral prednisolone 50 mg daily (gradually tapering to maintenance at, say, 20\u201330 mg daily over 21 days) and oral ribavirin 1200 mg t.i.d. for 10 days. With more experience, our unit is increasingly more inclined to commence pulse methylprednisolone as the initial therapy for most patients who show progressive disease.",
