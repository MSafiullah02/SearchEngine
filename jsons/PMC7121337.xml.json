In addition, CBRN incidents have also included accidental releases during peace time operations, and many of the principles for CBRN incident response can be applied to other hazardous material (HAZMAT) incidents. The impact of such weapons may have a range of implications for medical personnel both military and civilian. The health consequences related to a real or perceived CBRN hazard are:The initial (immediate, acute and delayed onset) health effects of CBRN agentsThe long-term (late onset or chronic) health effects of CBRN agentsThe secondary exposure risk to medical personnel due to either contamination or a contagious illnessThe requirement to carry out casualty hazard management that may include decontamination, isolation and quarantineThe implementation of wider public health reporting and travel restrictions for transmissible biological agentsThe potential impact on the health of individuals due to use of CBRN personal protective equipment, including heat illness and psychological stressThe potential impact on the healthcare system to implement pre-exposure or postexposure prophylaxisThe management of any casualty, including trauma, in a CBRN environmentThe presence of combined (CBRN and conventional) injuryThe traumatic effects due to a nuclear detonation\n",

The main secondary hazards are:\nContaminated casualties: Casualties coming into direct contact with a persistent agent will be contaminated (primary contamination). This may then be spread as secondary contamination to other personnel, equipment and infrastructure. Contamination may be classified as:\nExternal contamination: External contamination is the coating of an external surface such as the skin, hair or clothing of a casualty by a persistent agent. The agent may be liquid or dry particulate.\nInternal contamination: Internal contamination occurs by inhalation, ingestion or through the skin. Relatively small quantities of agent are internalised by the inoculation route and are unlikely to represent a secondary hazard.\nWound contamination: Wound decontamination is the introduction of a persistent agent into an area of traumatised tissue. A secondary hazard to responders including surgical teams may be present; however, the greater the potency of the agent, the less likely the casualty is to survive before surgery, and therefore the risk tends to be self-limiting. Devitalised (dead) tissue may also act as a buffer to limit systemic absorption of an agent.\n\nContagious casualties: Casualties presenting with an infectious disease may pass the illness to others if the disease is transmissible. Mitigation is by isolation as decontamination will be ineffectual.\n",

However, delay in these symptoms due to a latency period will confound any epidemiological investigation. For live biological agents, the latency period is called the incubation period. In some cases, such as certain live biological agents and acute radiation syndrome, there is a significant period of non-specific symptoms and signs (e.g. fever and muscle aches) that precede a more recognisable syndrome (or toxidrome); this is called a prodromal stage. A toxidrome is a pattern of symptoms and signs (syndrome) due to exposure to a toxic substance. Notable toxidromes are those for nerve agent intoxication and opioid overdose. Figure 46.1 provides a summary of the latency and incubation periods for certain CBRN agents.\n\n",

            "text": "The routes of exposure (sometimes referred to as routes of absorption) are important both for predicting and modelling the medical effects of agents and the provision of protective equipment specific to that route. The routes of exposure are:\nInhalation: This route may present the greatest risk of multiple casualties due to an airborne hazard such as a gas, vapour, aerosol, droplets (in close proximity) or smoke. Protection is by mask, respirator or self-contained breathing apparatus (SCBA).\nIngestion: This route is less likely to cause mass fatalities due to the dilution of any chemical agent or destruction by the cooking process or digestion. It may, however, be a significant route for the introduction of live biological agents with high infectivity. This route may be used for the targeting of individuals or small numbers. Protection is provided by water and food security and the restriction of eating and drinking during and post-attack.\nSkin (percutaneous): There are three methods for CBRN agents to pass through the skin:\nIntact skin (transcutaneous): Although skin is protective to many CBRN agents, some agents may directly damage the skin (vesicants) or have chemical properties (fat soluble) to allow penetration.\nInoculation: This is the intentional break in the skin in order to introduce a CBRN agent causing minimal trauma.\nWounds: This is the gross loss of skin integrity allowing for the opportunistic entry of CBRN agents into the body.\n\nMucous membranes: Although skin provides significant protection to biological agents, mucous membranes, which form the lining of internal cavities such as the mouth and rest of the gut, are more permeable and may allow an effective dose to be absorbed. Moisture on mucous membranes may also be reactive with some chemical agents such as chlorine causing immediate effects.\nEyes: While eyes are not a good route for absorption, there are significant local effects on the eyes and conjunctiva. An example is the pinpoint pupils (miosis) associated with nerve agent vapour.\n",

The level of lethality can be defined as:\nLethal dose 50 (LD\n50): This is the dose required, usually expressed as weight per kg or dose, to kill 50 % of the exposed population; the smaller the value, the greater the lethality. The LD50 is usually specific to a route of exposure, e.g. skin or ingestion. LD50 may also be expressed over a time period such as LD50/30 (30 days), and this is often used for irradiation.\nLethal concentration time 50 (LCt\n50): For the inhalation route, LCt50 is used as it reflects the inverse relationship between concentration and the duration of exposure to cause the same effect (death) in 50 % of the exposed population.\nCase fatality rate (CFR): This is the number of deaths compared to the total number of cases, e.g. estimated pandemic influenza (3\u20134 %) and inhalational anthrax (95\u2013100 %).\n\nDamaging: These effects are those that may not be associated with a high lethality but require significant medical resources, e.g. sulphur mustard.\nIncapacitating: These agents cause a reversible mental or physical disability and inability to function. Secondary effects may also occur and include trauma due to increased risk taking behaviour or heat illness due to the physiological effects of the agent. Examples include BZ (mental incapacitant) and adamsite (vomiting agent/physical incapacitant).\nIatrogenic: These effects are due to the adverse drug effects of MedCMs. In all cases, the decision to implement a MedCM at a command or clinical level will be based on a risk-benefit assessment; for example, a MedCM such as atropine with significant side effects may be used to mitigate a lethal CBRN agent.\n",

            "text": "A CBRN incident has significant security and intelligence implications; however, with regard to incident management, the presence of a CBRN agent or TIM is simply another hazard that requires mitigation. A conventional incident response incorporates safety considerations and a standardised incident report that includes hazard assessment. Where there is a combined hazard (explosive and CBRN), the presence of the CBRN agent may not be initially recognised, and an all-hazards approach is important. For covert releases, including outbreaks, an approach using epidemiological concepts is more likely. For an incident identified as a CBRN incident, the response can be optimised by modifying the conventional incident response. The principles of a CBRN medical incident response (SC3AT3ER) (Fig. 46.2) are:\n\n\nSafety: This includes evacuation of non-essential persons from the area, personal protective equipment (PPE) and hazard management. For all incidents, safety is of paramount importance, and safety assessments should be repeated.\nCordons: This includes establishing hot, warm and clean zones as well as casualty decontamination areas (Fig. 46.3). For a significant biological incident with risk of person to person spread, cordons may support public health control measures with restriction of movement (ROM). ROM may include sovereign boundaries in the case of Public Health Emergencies of International Concern (PHEIC) as defined by the International Health Regulations (2005). The zones are defined as:\n\nThe hot zone is a non-permissive area where there is a direct hazard from the environment (firearm, explosive hazard or CBRN). This zone is sometimes referred to as the exclusion zone especially where PPE does not mitigate the hazard such as in the case of explosives or high dose radiation.The warm zone is a semi-permissive (buffer) area setup usually due to a continuing contamination hazard from casualties or equipment coming out of the hot zone. This zone is also referred to as the decontamination zone and demarcated by a clean dirty line (CDL).\n\nCommand and communications: Each zone and area will require a vertical and horizontal command structure to allow for interoperability between specialist units and the chain of command. The chain of communication should mirror the chain of command and include updates following further safety assessments and on identification or exclusion of any hazard.\nAssessment: Concurrent environmental and casualty assessment is important and both have advantages and disadvantages with detection and diagnosis, respectively. Any report of a CBRN agent must include the source of the information (environmental sampling, diagnosis) and the confidence of the assessment (suspected, probable, confirmed).\nTriage: See discussion to come.\nTreatment: Treatments of individual casualties and agents vary between nations and are subject to national legislation. However, examples of significant chemical agents and suggested initial management are listed at the end of this chapter.\nTransport: The presence of a CBRN agent and risk of secondary contamination or infection has significant implications for casualty transport especially by air. Some methods may also be limited by aviation and international regulation.\nExploitation and recovery: As well as the treatment of CBRN casualties, another implication of a CBRN event is the potential loss or compromise of a medical facility such as a hospital. The priority after casualty management has been completed is to recover back to an original state while also exploiting the scene for forensic evidence.\n",

Skin decontaminants such as Fuller\u2019s Earth and some active decontaminants should be avoided in wounds due to complications and potential delayed wound healing. Surgical management of any traumatic injury should include a wide debridement (removal of dead tissue), whether CBRN or conventional. There is a theoretical risk that contaminated wounds (munitions fragment or impregnated clothing) may pose a threat to a surgical team. For light contamination, this is very unlikely. Standard surgical procedures including the use of aseptic technique and surgical instruments, such as forceps, will minimise any risk. Research has demonstrated that a single pair of latex surgical gloves may not provide adequate protection from some chemical agents where there is direct contact, i.e. wound probing, and therefore double nitrile gloves, which have greater chemical resistance, are the minimum requirement.",
