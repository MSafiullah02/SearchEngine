            "text": "Pasteurized whole milk (PWM) is a common component in calf diets on commercial dairy farms in the United States, as producers seek to capture losses from waste milk. Recent literature, however, has suggested that PWM alone does not meet the vitamin A, D3, and E nutritional requirements of young calves and that these requirements are increased by increased growth rates and immune challenge (Krueger et al., 2014; Nonnecke et al., 2014). Suggested mechanisms by which vitamin A and D3 metabolites affect growth and immunity include the targeting of nuclear receptors to affect cell differentiation, tissue development, and immune cell signaling (Hall et al., 2011; Nelson et al., 2012; Rhinn and Doll\u00e9, 2012), whereas vitamin E is an antioxidant that protects cell membrane unsaturated fatty acids from oxidative processes such as respiration and inflammation (Traber and Atkinson, 2007). Pasteurized whole milk contains approximately 38.4 and 1.8 IU/L of vitamins D3 and E, respectively, falling short of recommended daily allowances (582 and 26.5 IU, respectively) for neonatal calves (NRC, 2001; Krueger et al., 2014). Pasteurized whole milk may satisfy the nutritional requirement for vitamin A in healthy, milk-fed calves, but animals experiencing inflammation have exhibited decreased serum retinol and retinol binding protein (Rosales et al., 1996; Krueger et al., 2014). Thus, supplemental vitamins A, D3, and E may benefit the neonatal calf. Commercial milk replacers often include vitamins in concentrations above those recommended by NRC (2001) as a recent technical bulletin recommended daily fortification of PWM with 20,000, 7,500, and 100 IU of vitamins A, D3, and E, respectively, for neonatal calf diets (Wood, 2013).",

            "text": "Although the health of neonatal calves may be affected by vitamin deficiencies, it is clear that colostrum intake plays a significant role in immune maturation and decreased morbidity. At birth, newborn calves possess cells and other components that compose the innate and adaptive arms of immunity, but lack endogenous antibody and are highly susceptible to infection at epithelial barriers within the lungs and intestine. Feeding colostrum to calves within the first 24 h of life is accepted widely as an effective means of delivering passive protection in a dose-dependent manner (Robison et al., 1988). Maternal colostrum contains IgG1 antibodies, leukocytes, complement, and cytokines that confer passive immunity (Chase et al., 2008). Because colostral leukocytes are degraded during the pasteurization and freezing processes that are recommended for commercial handling of colostrum, immune stimulatory benefits are primarily attributed to compounds in the whey fraction. Fractionated colostrum replacer, used in this study, is concentrated colostral whey that contains IgG1 and many other nonnutritive, bioactive compounds such as IGF, lactoferrin, lysozyme, and lactoperoxidase (Tripathi and Vashishtha, 2006). As passively transferred immunity wanes during early life, acquired immunity is essential for survival, but is potentially impaired by fat-soluble vitamin deficiencies in calves fed only PWM.",

Infection rates of this pathogen are greatest during the neonatal stage when fecal-oral transmission risk is high upon exposure to infected dams in the maternity pen. Additionally, transmission to the neonate can occur via colostrum and milk of infected dams (Stabel et al., 2014). Although infection as a neonate is not known to cause acute inflammatory distress, the organism can survive and replicate in the host during a long subclinical latency before overt immune responses become evident (Stabel, 2010). Complications due to colostrum deprivation, vitamin deficiencies, or both may exacerbate the infectivity of young neonates with MAP.",

Additionally, supplemental vitamins were provided to provoke calfhood immunity and attenuate inflammatory responses. We sought to use vitamin supplementation standards consistent with commercial standards (Wood, 2013; Krueger et al., 2014), which are in excess of NRC (2001) recommendations. A neonatal MAP infection model was overlaid in the study design to ascertain specific effects of colostrum feeding and vitamin supplementation on uptake of MAP in the first 2 wk of life, a critical period of pathogen susceptibility for the neonatal calf. This study was thus conducted to assess whether colostrum and supplemental vitamins A, D3, and E affect the inflammatory status of calves fed PWM by measuring serum acute phase proteins haptoglobin (Hp) and serum amyloid A (SAA), and whether these dietary treatments subsequently alter the MAP infection status of bovine neonates.",

Thus, this study reveals a previously unrecognized consequence of feeding colostral whey to dairy calves as colostrum replacer. Our principal finding was that calves consuming acellular colostral whey exhibit increased concentrations of Hp in serum within 24 h of feeding. The observed increase occurred before inoculation with MAP and, therefore, is not a result of pathogen challenge. Hiss-Pesch et al. (2011) demonstrated that both jejunal absorption of Hp and endogenous hepatic synthesis of the molecule occur within 24 h postpartum in colostrum-fed piglets. Although the present study does not fully demonstrate either mechanism in calves, our finding suggests redundancy across species. Haptoglobin synthesis is induced by IL-6 type cytokines and is thought to attenuate the inflammatory response in a negative feedback loop. Therefore, greater concentrations of Hp in serum indicate more severe inflammation (Wang et al., 2001; Huntoon et al., 2008). Huntoon et al. (2008) demonstrated aberrant adaptive immune responses in Hp knockout mice, including stunted lymphocyte maturation, disruption of antigen presentation, and failure to mount effective antibody-mediated recall responses.",

The neonatal calf is born without immunoglobulin in a hormonally induced, immunosuppressed state, and innate components of the immune system are complete albeit immature (Chase et al., 2008). Cytokines including TNF-\u03b1, IL-1\u03b2, IL-6, IL-1\u03b1, and IFN-\u03b3 in colostrum, and likely in the whey fraction, promote immune system activity, especially monocyte and neutrophil migration to tissues and T helper 2 (TH2) biased adaptive responses (Hagiwara et al., 2000; Chase et al., 2008), thus potentiating a requirement for Hp. Because mature B lymphocytes are scarce and respond weakly to TH2 signaling (Chase et al., 2008), the TH2 bias (and potentially Hp) may contribute to establishment of microorganisms throughout the epithelial barrier tissues until a quorum for commensalism is reached. Thus, Hp in colostrum may have an integral role in immune education by supporting the TH2 bias.",

Thus, we hypothesized that an altered inflammatory status of young calves could correlate with severity of early infection. Three tissues (distal jejunum, ileum, and ileo-cecal valve) were identified as primary sites of neonatal infection, but detection of MAP in these tissues was sporadic, even among calves of the same treatment. The only difference in inflammatory status was observed at d 1, between CD and all CR calves. No difference in acute phase protein expression was observed at d 14 when tissues were collected, and no significant difference in severity of infection in the distal small intestine was observed among treatments. The 3 tissues of interest, however, were negative for MAP in CD calves, thus suggesting that neonatal immune status affects the course of infection. The effects of colostrum deprivation on MAP infection warrant further exploration.",

Quantifiable SAA at d 1 of age in CD calves supports the hypothesis of endogenous SAA synthesis within the first 24 of life.

Calves received fractionated colostrum replacer that excluded colostral fat, and thus was assumed void of vitamins A, D3, and E per the manufacturer. Calves consuming maternal colostrum have additional basal exposure to fat soluble vitamins, but vitamin status of calves fed maternal colostrum (Krueger et al., 2014) are in agreement with calves of CD and CR control groups in our study, which indicates that colostral vitamins have minimal long-term effect on concentration of vitamins in serum. Injection with d-\u03b1-tocopherol caused an obvious and immediate increase in serum \u03b1-tocopherol that was only partially sustained by the oral supplement after 7 d. In contrast, metabolites of injected vitamins A and D3 were increased only after sustained supplementation. d-\u03b1-Tocopherol is the most bioactive and bioavailable tocopherol (Jensen and Lauridsen, 2007). In contrast, retinyl palmitate requires cleavage of the ester to yield retinol, and vitamin D3 is hydroxylated by hepatic 25-hydroxylase to yield 25-(OH)-D3 (Horst et al., 2005). Therefore, the time required for metabolism of the injected vitamins A and D3 may have exceeded the 12 to 24 h allotted before our first measurement of their metabolites in serum, whereas the d-\u03b1-tocopherol measured was the same compound that was supplemented.",
