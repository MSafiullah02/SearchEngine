Within 3 months of initial reporting of this novel coronavirus, cases had surpassed 100 000 worldwide, and less than 2 weeks later, global cases had doubled.1 This pandemic has put immense strain on medical systems, leading to current or impending shortages of personal protective equipment (PPE). On 7 February 2020, the WHO estimated that demand for PPE had increased by 100-fold since the start of the outbreak, with prices increasing up to 20-fold.2 Prices continued to surge throughout the month of March 2020, and the New York Times reported that the federal stockpile for public health emergencies can only meet approximately 1% of the estimated need.3 As a result of the high medical demand and system strain caused by SARS-CoV-2, efforts to produce and stockpile a sufficient supply of N95 respirators and face masks have fallen short.",

Our review was intended to evaluate the evidence pertaining to medical-grade facial protection currently in use. As a result, we limited our search to records published or most recently updated between 1 January 2000 and 24 March 2020 to ensure that the results would be applicable to current PPE standards.

Due to the novel nature of the COVID-19 pandemic, the review included grey literature such as preprint publications, product descriptions, guidelines, guidance documents and news articles in addition to peer-reviewed publications. We initially used grey literature to define best or recommended practices, then analysed peer-reviewed documents. This diverse array of sources was included with the intention of capturing a more complete picture of the rapidly developing nature of the COVID-19 pandemic, need for medical-grade PPE and global responses. A search of Google with no date restrictions was conducted between 15 March 2020 and 24 March 2020 and the first 20 hits were screened.

At least one author reviewed titles initially generated from the PubMed searches, selecting those that were available in English and relevant to one of the components addressed above. The relevant titles were exported and duplicates were excluded. Next, the selected records, including both grey literature and peer-reviewed articles, were reviewed by at least two authors according to the following criteria: (1) the record defined or characterised the state of current PPE shortages; defined or characterised the mode of transmission or prevention of COVID-19; examined evidence for the extended use, reuse and decontamination methods for medical grade masks; or addressed the efficacy and safety of alternative and improvised masks, and (2) the record was available in English. This initial search was further refined to exclude articles that were not applicable to healthcare settings, concerned product design at the industrial level, or focused on PPE other than N95 respirators, surgical masks or face shields (figure 1). Published systematic reviews and meta-analyses were excluded, as meta-analysis was beyond the scope of this scoping review. We resolved disagreements on record selection and data extraction by discussion with other authors as needed. Based on the rapid nature of this review in the setting of a global pandemic, our scoping review required process tailoring. We did not prepare or register a protocol for screening titles and abstracts, and our primary literature search was limited to one database.

Face shields provide barrier protection from splash and splatter contamination, as well as acutely expelled aerosols generated during procedures such as bronchoscopy, airway suctioning and intubation.18 However, the evidence for the effectiveness of face shields in preventing transmission of viral respiratory diseases is minimal, as highlighted in a recent narrative review.19 Our scoping review identified only one study that evaluated face shields for respiratory protection. Using cough simulation, researchers demonstrated that face shields were shown to reduce the risk of inhalation exposure up to 95% immediately following aerosol production. However, protection was decreased with smaller aerosol particles and 30 min after cough simulation, due to persistence of airborne particles and particle flow around the sides of the mask.20 Because they lack a peripheral seal, face shields should not be used as primary protection for preventing respiratory disease transmission, but can be used as an adjunct to other facial protection.",

A small randomised controlled trial (RCT) found that incidence of upper respiratory infection symptoms was similar between groups of inpatient healthcare workers who wore surgical masks and those who did not wear masks.21 However, studies comparing efficacy of different types of medical-grade masks in the inpatient setting have conflicting results. One non-inferiority RCT of nurses working in medical and paediatric inpatient units found that use of a surgical mask compared with a fit-tested N95 respirator resulted in non-inferior rates of laboratory-confirmed influenza.22 Several other RCTs found that rates of respiratory infection illness were lower in healthcare workers who used fit-tested N95 respirators compared with those who used surgical masks.23\u201325 Similarly, N95 respirators have been shown to provide superior protection against respiratory bacterial infections or bacterial-viral coinfections when compared with surgical masks.26 The literature regarding mask fit in the inpatient setting is limited to one study. An RCT comparing fit-tested and non-fit-tested N95 respirators found no significant difference in ability to protect against respiratory illness, despite in vitro evidence of significant reduction in filtration efficacy with peripheral air leakage.24 27 Furthermore, non-fit-tested N95 respirators were significantly more protective than surgical masks.24 In the context of COVID-19, a recent case report identified 41 healthcare workers exposed to SARS-CoV-2 through aerosol-generating procedures. Among these providers, 85% were wearing surgical masks at the time of exposure, and the remaining 15% were wearing N95 respirators.28 None of the exposed providers contracted COVID-19.28 Our scoping review did not identify any other studies comparing the efficacy of medical-grade masks during aerosol-generating procedures.",

However, availability, access and costs of these materials are likely to be prohibitive.65 Of note, a news report from South Korea mentions an innovative washable electrostatic cotton which can serve as a more durable, insertable filter.66 Further research is needed to assess the effectiveness and safety of these materials for preventing respiratory infection and penetration of viral particles.

There are many opportunities for future research in this field. Additional evidence regarding the safety and effectiveness of alternative facial protection is required in order to better equip individuals to make improvised facial protection when necessary. Specifically, further research on the effectiveness of an improvised cloth mask with an added filter versus cloth alone is warranted. In addition, comparisons of different possible filter media are warranted and should include discussion about accessibility of materials and the creation of guidelines for reuse. Finally, development of effective and safe decontamination methods that do not compromise the integrity or filtration properties of facial protection is needed.",

Articles written in languages other than English were excluded, which particularly limited the evaluation of recent articles related to the COVID-19 pandemic. Studies on SARS-CoV-2 have been performed in settings experiencing the early phases of the pandemic, which does not lend easily to standardised RCTs or uniform study planning and execution. Additionally, studies performed prior to the COVID-19 outbreak were not specific to SARS-CoV-2, and it is unknown whether those results are applicable in the current context. Our review also included a number of small RCTs and observational studies, which have less statistical power, as well as non-peer-reviewed articles.",

Alternative forms of facial protection are less effective, but may serve as an intermediary in emergent situations. Based on the literature, the safest approach to address this shortage is to ensure provision of a sufficient quantity of medical-grade facial protection for healthcare workers. Considering the limited evidence, reused and improvised masks should be used as a last resort, but may be beneficial when medical-grade facial protection is unavailable. Face shields should not be used as primary protection, but rather as an adjunct to improvised masks. Public health and medical institutions should be prepared to ensure the safety of healthcare workers in all stages of crises. Therefore, it is necessary to continue research and the publication of evidence-based emergency protocols that include recommendations for improvised protection.",
