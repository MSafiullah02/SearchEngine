The aim of this review was to identify maternal and neonatal outcomes in available articles on pregnancies affected by COVID-19. The articles that had assessed outcomes of pregnancy and perinatal of women with COVID-19 between Oct 2019 and Apr 30, 2020 without language limitation were considered. All kinds of studies such as case report, case series, retrospective cohort, case control were included. We searched databases, selected relevant studies and extracted data regarding maternal and neonatal outcomes from each article. Data of 287 pregnant women with COVID-19 of 6 countries were assessed from 28 articles between December 8, 2019 and April 6, 2020. Most pregnant women reported in their third trimester, 102 (35.5%) cases were symptomatic at the time of admission. Common onset symptoms, abnormal laboratory findings, and chest computed tomography pattern were fever (51.5%), lymphocytopenia (67.9%), and multiple ground-glass opacities (78.5%) respectively. 93% of all deliveries were done through cesarean section. No maternal mortality and 3 % ICU admission were reported. Vertical transmission was not reported but its possibility was suggested in three neonates. One neonatal death, one stillbirth, and one abortion were reported. All newborns were not breastfed. This review showed fewer adverse maternal and neonatal outcomes in pregnant women with COVID-19 in comparison with previous coronavirus outbreak infection in pregnancy. Limited data are available regarding possibility of virus transmission in utero, during vaginal childbirth and breastfeeding. Effect of COVID-19 on first and second trimester and ongoing pregnancy outcomes in infected mothers is still questionable.",

            "text": "Some conditions increase vulnerability of mothers and fetuses to become infected with outbreak viruses especially respiratory viruses. The first one is maternal physiologic adaptive changes in cardiopulmonary system during pregnancy which leads to increased heart rate, and stroke volume, and reduced pulmonary residual capacity. These changes could increase the risk of hypoxemia [9] . The second issue is maternal immunologic alterations and a shift from Th1 to Th2 immunity that occurs during pregnancy. This shift could decrease the robustness of cell-mediated immunity, alter responses to viral respiratory infections during pregnancy, and increase severity of these infections [10, 11] . The third factor is related to characteristics of innate and adaptive immunity in fetus including lower cytolytic function of fetal natural killer (NK) cells compared to adults, lower intensity of antigen-specific antibody response in comparison with adults, immature T cell immunity with suppressed Th1 responses and upregulated Th2 responses, hyporesponsive macrophages, and scarce soluble inflammatory mediators [12] [13] [14] . All of these characteristics increase fetal susceptibility to infections. Furthermore, a viral infection of placenta could produce inflammatory cytokines, activate maternal immune system, impair placenta, induce abortion or preterm labor in perinatal period and lead to long-term neurodevelopmental sequelae in adulthood [15] [16] [17] .",

Result of his throat swab for 2019-nCoV nucleic acid testing was negative on 9th day after delivery. According to the mentioned newborn feeding in 60 cases, all newborns of mothers with COVID-19 were given formula instead of breast milk. Vertical transmission of COVID-19 from mother to the fetus was not reported in available literature. However, possibility of mother-to-child vertical transmission was suggested in three cases [23, 29, 35 ]. The first one was a newborn with elevated IgM level, cytokines, and white blood cell count, normal chest CT, and negative RT-PCR tests on nasopharyngeal swabs taken from 2 h to 16 days of age [23] . The second one was a neonate with positive nucleic acid test of SARS-CoV-2 at 36 h after birth, mild shortness of breath symptoms, mild pulmonary infection in chest X-ray and no fever and cough. The neonate was discharged after 2 weeks following two consecutive negative nucleic acid test results [29] . The third one was a neonate with positive RT-PCR test for SARS-Cov-2, pulmonary infection in chest X-ray 53 h after birth, and no clinical manifestations of Covid-19. The neonate was discharged after subsequent negative RT-PCR of throat swabs on 16 th day after birth [35] . Additionally, two newborns were reported with elevated SARS-CoV-2 IgM antibodies, negative RT-PCR test results of neonatal throat swabs, and no Covid-19 infection symptoms [45].",
