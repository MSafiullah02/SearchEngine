One possible reason was that climate change may be an important factor contributing to the variability in seasonal trends and viral etiologies of ARTI; the cold weather during this period may increase the risk of respiratory infections. When the analysis was carried out according to the ages, we found that the total virus detection rate and virus prevalence of different age groups were not significant different. However, in the study of Li et al, though no significant differences in the positivity rate of the different age groups were observed, the prevalence of viruses was different between different age groups. This differences in the prevalence of viruses in different age groups observed between our and Li's study may be due to the following:first, the relatively small sample sizes of our study; and second, the differences in the sensitivity of these two analytical assays (GeXP and FilmArray) used in the studies.",
