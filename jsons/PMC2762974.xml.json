It is also the most common virus being associated with asthma attacks in children (up to 60% of cases) [1,2]. In wheezy children less than 2 years old at emergency room and hospital settings, RV is also a common agent (up to 41-47%; depends on the risk factors of asthma) only second to respiratory syncytial virus (RSV, up to 68% of cases) [3,4]. Studies how viral etiology of early wheezing may contribute to later development of asthma have focused almost exclusively on RSV, but recent studies suggest that RV is equal [5], or more important viral risk factor than RSV [6-8].",

Despite many in vitro studies, the number of in vivo studies is very limited and focussed almost exclusively on adult subjects [11-17]. Cytokine gene polymorphism studies are increasingly reported in wheezing children [18-21], but there are no studies comparing cytokine responses in RV and RSV affected young wheezing children. The available comparative data among young children with wheezing is limited to atopic characteristics, which have been more pronounced in RV than RSV affected children [5,22], and thereby, as many studies in adults and one in children, suggest possible role for cytokines involved in T cell differentiation [11-17]. The aim of our observational study was to compare systemic T-helper1 (Th1), Th2 and T-regulatory (Treg) cell type cytokine responses between children with RV and RSV induced early wheezing. We hypothesised that RV affected young wheezing children have different T cell cytokine profile compared to RSV affected children.",

The original aim was to study the efficacy of oral prednisolone treatment in hospitalized wheezing children in relation to viral etiology, i.e. a half of the patients were randomized to receive oral prednisolon for 3 days and the other half placebo in a double blind design. The methods have been described earlier [7,23]. The present study included all children of the VINKU study who were 3 to 35 months old, had their first or second wheezing episode, had sole RV or RSV infection and had either acute or convalescent phase serum available (Fig. 1). In addition, we included asymptomatic control children who participated to VINKU2 study in the same institution (10/2008-5/2009). They had not had respiratory symptoms within 2 weeks, had never wheezed and had no chronic illnesses other than possible atopy. All recruited control children were included to this analysis. The study protocols were approved by the Ethics Committee of the Turku University Hospital and informed consent was obtained from the guardian before commencing the study.",

It is primarily produced by T-helper lymphocytes but is also derived from cytotoxic T cells and NK cells. IFN-gamma production belongs to nonspecific defense mechanims, which have direct immunoregulatory and antiviral actions, although its capability to inhibit viral replication is modest. IFN-gamma also inhibits allergic responses through its capacity to inhibit IL-4 mediated effects but may also contribute to airway hyperresponsiveness especially in non-atopic subjects [26]. Previous in vitro and in vivo studies in adults have shown that IFN-gamma is highly and dose-dependently inducible by RV in leukocyte, T cell, or airway epithelial cell cultures and that blood CD4+ IFN-gamma response is associated with lower RV loads and less severe symptoms suggesting protective role for IFN-gamma [11,15,17]. Our study further suggests an important role for the IFN-gamma response in RV associated early wheezing. The results from the comparison between RV-group and the control group argue against the suggestion that the high IFN-gamma levels in RV affected children were due to predisposition. Previous findings in murine models and our findings also support the link between IL-12 and IFN-gamma in virus infection, i.e. the former induces the latter [27]. However, the role of IL-2 and IL-12 appears to be less pronounced in RV infections as shown by us here and by others previously [11,15]. IFN-gamma response was low in RSV affected children as expected [27,28].",

The capability of RV to induce Th2-type cytokines (IL-4 and IL-5) has been less pronounced in previous in vitro studies compared to IFN-gamma responses as also supported by in vivo data [14,29]. Although it is possible that RV-infection worsens Th2-type inflammation, the presence of Th2-type cytokines more likely may reflect a chronic inflammatory state of lower airways, which may increase susceptibility to RV infections [17,30]. Furthermore, Th2-type cytokines could counteract Th1-type cytokines, and thereby, may increase susceptibility to more severe RV-infections [12,15,17,25]. In agreement, the RV affected children had markedly higher systemic levels of IL-5 and IL-13 than those affected by RSV in our study, but this difference appeared to be linked to atopy. The difference in Th2-type cytokines was not so striking when RV-group was compared to atopy/age-matched controls and seen only in IL-5 in the acute phase and not seen at all in the convalescence phase. These findings fit in the previously reported close association between RV infections and atopic characteristics [5,14]. Interestingly, the IL-13 response was markedly higher in RV affected children than in those affected by RSV in our study. IL-13 is known to play critical role in airway hyperreactivity and amplifying allergic inflammation in asthma [17,26]. It should be noted that certain polymorphism, such as IL-4 590T and IL-4Ralpha R551 alleles, could be linked to more sereve bronchiolitis and the IL-13 Gln allele may identify children at risk for persistent wheezing as shown in RSV affected children [18,20].",

            "text": "Of the studied cytokines, IL-10 tends to have immunoregulatory properties and its generation is usually associated with resolution of the inflammatory process [31]. Moreover, it is also associated with airway hyperreactivity, and blood CD 4+ IL-10 level has inversely correlated with nasal RV load [17,26]. Our findings on IL-10 are very similar to the reports by Grissell et al. (2005) [32]. They studied cytokine gene expression by quantitative PCR in the induced sputum of mainly adult subjects (>7-year-old) with virus induced acute asthma (64% of subjects had RV). They found that IL-10 mRNA was increased in virus-infected acute asthma and reduced on recovery phase. We further showed that IL-10 was elevated in both virus groups in the acute phase when compared to the convalescence phase and also when RV-group was compared to the control group. The finding that IL-10 level was greater in the RV-group than in the RSV-group in the convalescent phase is probably linked to predisposition (atopy) since no difference was found in this time-point when compared to the control group. The increased IL-10 level in acute viral infection could mean that IL-10 is a causative mediator in virus provoked exacerbation (triggered by IFN-gamma), and that the generation of IL-10 is a response to a greater degree of pre-existing airway inflammation in individuals predisposed to virus, especially to RV, induced exacerbations, and serve to promote tolerance [17,33]. Whether IL-10 levels reflect Treg activity, it is intriguing to speculate that the patients with decreased IL-10 responses (thereby defective down regulation of Th1 and Th2 responses) could have greater inflammatory response to viral infections (e.g. to >150 circulating RV strains) [9,10] and thereby increased risk for recurrent wheezing. In agreement, a recent study reported lower IL-10 levels in stimulated cord blood of children who were hospitalized for RSV infection before 6 months of age compared to those who were treated as outpatients [34]. Interestingly, children homozygous for the IL-10 -592C, -592A or IL-10 -1082A allele have had a high risk of severe bronchiolitis [19,21].",
