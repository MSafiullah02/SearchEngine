            "text": "Respiratory viruses (RVs) are increasingly recognized as a major cause of morbidity and mortality in solid organ transplant recipients, especially within the lung transplant population. Respiratory viral infections are typically caused by rhinovirus (RhVs), coronavirus (CoV), respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), influenza (FLU), parainfluenza (PIV), human metapneumovirus (hMPV), and adenovirus (AdV) (Table 9.1). Respiratory infections can also be caused by viruses less commonly associated with the respiratory tract such as cytomegalovirus (CMV), human herpesviruses (HSV1, HSV2), and varicella zoster virus (VZV) that will be discussed in another chapter (Chap. 10.1007/978-3-030-15394-6_6). A detailed discussion of other newer respiratory viruses (Table 9.1) is beyond the scope of this chapter, since they have not been widely studied in immunocompromised patients and their clinical impact is not fully understood. However, these viruses should be considered in the differential diagnosis of patients presenting with severe lower tract disease, especially if clinical history indicates potential exposure. The newer RVs are more challenging to diagnose since they are not included in the routinely available diagnostic tests and optimal management has not been defined.",

In SOT, LRTIs have been associated with increased risk of adverse complications and subsequent development of fungal, viral, and bacterial superinfections [2].

The ideal method of sampling has also come into question, as the yield of viral specimen may differ depending on the specimen source. All SOTs with suspected RV infection should have a nasopharyngeal sample tested by PCR, including nasopharyngeal swab (NPS), wash, or aspirate. Between common respiratory specimens collected from the upper respiratory tract, NPS are preferred, since they are practical for widespread use and comparable in sensitivity to nasopharyngeal aspirates or bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) for the detection of all major RVs [1, 7, 8]. NPS should be collected diligently by trained staff, using the standardized procedures of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) (https://www.cdc.gov/urdo/downloads/speccollectionguidelines.pdf; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DVJNWefmHjE) [9].

At present, real-time multiplex nucleic acid amplification testing (multiplex NAT) based on the RT-PCR technology is the preferred diagnostic tool for studying RVs in immunocompromised patients and is incorporated into many of the current guidelines [1, 7]. Both laboratory-developed and commercial RT-PCR assays are currently available, differing in specificity and sensitivity (ranges from 72% to 100%, with best sensitivity seen for FLU and lower sensitivities for ADV and PIV). With the aim of overcoming technical complexity of PCR-based testing, fully automated RT-PCR instrument for rapid detection of RV has been tested in immunocompromised patients with promising results with a turnaround time of approximately 1\u20132 h [10]. Therefore, clinicians should be aware of the performance characteristics of the assay performed (https://www.cdc.gov/urdo/downloads/speccollectionguidelines.pdf). Of note that regarding ADV, negative testing from the upper or lower airway may not exclude infections particularly for SOT with disseminated disease if there is limited to no involvement of the respiratory tract. RT-PCR should be applied on respiratory specimen, blood (quantitative viral load testing), and other compartments depending on clinical presentation (urine, cerebrospinal fluid).",

A number of commercial IA are available for RSV and FLU (A and B) and require little technical expertise. However, false-negative and false-positive results can be generated. A low prevalence of circulating virus within the community decreases the positive predictive value of the test. For FLU, rapid IA has shown high specificity but low sensitivity (20\u201370%) as compared to other assays, making them suboptimal for SOT recipient, particularly in clinical decision-making for antiviral therapy [11].",

In immunocompromised patients (mainly hematopoietic stem cell transplant recipients), RBV has been shown to decrease progression to LRTI when given to patients with URTI. Among SOT, the greatest experience with RBV is with lung transplant recipients. Based on published reports as well as self-reported treatment strategies in surveys from SOT centers, lung and heart-lung recipients often receive RBV for both RSV-related URTI and LRTI [12]. Due to lack of clear evidence of efficacy, wide variation in the management of RSV exists including variability often dependent on availability of the inhaled, intravenous, and oral RBV formulations [23]. Intravenous and inhaled RBV are not available in most European countries. Oral ribavirin appears to be an effective, well-tolerated alternative to intravenous or inhaled ribavirin, providing potential cost savings and reducing length of hospital stay [24] (Tables 9.2 and 9.4). ALN-RSV01, a small interfering RNA that targets the RSV nucleocapsid messenger RNA, has shown some early promise in potentially preventing chronic rejection in lung transplant recipients with RSV; this agent is no longer being developed clinically. In addition, there are a number of other small molecule therapies in various stages of development including early clinical trials [13].",

Existing data suggests that cidofovir and brincidofovir, an orally bioavailable lipid conjugate of cidofovir, may provide the highest likelihood of antiviral efficacy. Brincidofovir appears to have increased in vitro and in vivo efficacy against AdV for treatment of serious infections with less renal and bone marrow toxicity than cidofovir (Table 9.4). RBV does not appear to have significant anti-AdV activity in humans and is generally not recommended to treat serious AdV infections. The use of IVIG remains controversial because it does not appear to have a clear benefit at this time. Adoptive T-cell transfer has generally been limited to a few centers (predominantly in hematopoietic stem cell transplantation) and has been reported to be safe and effective when performed early in the course of the infection [30].",
