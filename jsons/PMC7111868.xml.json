            "text": "In recent times, multicomponent reactions (MCRs) have been considered as a superior synthetic strategy.2 MCRs are usually highly efficient and atom economic. Compared with the conventional organic reactions, MCRs are advantageous in being highly convergent and in requiring minimum time and effort to achieve structural complexity. Thus, MCRs are accepted as green chemical processes. Over the years, hundreds of MCRs are known in the literature. These reactions can be classified in different ways, e.g., according to the reaction mechanisms, the components involved or their intrinsic variability.2 Isocyanide-based multicomponent reactions, introduced in 1921 by Passerini,3 followed by Ugi and others, are the most explored and well studied.4 Currently, various non-isocyanide-based multicomponent reactions5 are being developed for the synthesis of arrays of compounds of potential applications in drug discovery, and material science. These include imine-based MCRs (involving imines as a substrate or an intermediate), which have gained considerable attention in recent years. This sudden rise in the popularity of imine-based MCRs may be considered to be due to two factors: (i) substrate-dependent reactivity of imines, and (ii) commercial availability of several hundred amines and aldehydes to access a large number of imines, which can lead to diverse molecular scaffolds. Therefore, imines are considered as versatile building block in MCRs for diversity-oriented synthesis.",

The electron-rich nitrogen atom of imines may act as a nucleophile. On the other hand, imines behave as masked carbonyls/electrophiles in the presence of good C-nucleophiles and provide Mannich-type products. The electrophilicity of imines can be increased by protonation of the nitrogen atom using a Br\u00f8nsted acid. In addition, imines can be used as azadienes or even as dienophiles in cycloaddition reactions. Although there is much possible reactivity of imines, they often react with remarkable selectivity in specific cases. The reactivity that an imine displays in a given multicomponent reaction depends both on the reaction partner and on the nature of the substituents of the corresponding aldehydes and amines.",

This is generally achieved either by using a Dean\u2013Stark apparatus or by adding drying agents such as anhydrous Na2SO4.

Relatively few review articles on non-IMCRs are known in the literature and, to the best of our knowledge, this is the first on multicomponent reactions in which the chemistry of imines is exclusively described. The objective of this review is to highlight the potential of imines as important synthetic intermediates in MCRs and to discuss the various reactivity patterns, rather than giving a comprehensive data base of imine-based MCRs.",

When a nucleophile attacks a carbonyl system, very little energy is required to distort the polarised \u03c0-bond, since the oxygen atom is more electronegative. Similarly, if a nucleophilic attack takes place at the carbon centre of an imine, an intermediate would be generated possessing a negative charge on the nitrogen, which is not favourable. Therefore, imines are less electrophilic than aldehydes and ketones. They can, however, be activated by treatment with a catalytic amount of an acid. The iminium cation, generated by protonation of the imine nitrogen, is a highly reactive electrophile, since attack upon this positively charged intermediate generates a neutral species 9 (Scheme 3\n).",

The classical Mannich reaction has some limitations, however, such as harsh reaction conditions and long reaction times. In addition, indirect-type15 Mannich reactions using preformed electrophiles, such as imines and stable nucleophiles, such as enolates or enol ethers suffer from the drawback of the necessity for the isolation and purification of the preformed intermediates. Therefore, a modified and improved methodology, known as the direct-type Mannich reaction, in the presence of various catalysts and using carbonyl compounds directly as nucleophiles was introduced. In the literature, several methodologies have been reported for the direct-type Mannich reactions.16 Protic acids as well as Lewis acids are found to be suitable for the catalytic activation of these reactions. As an example, Khan et al.17 have reported a bromodimethylsulfonium bromide (BDMS)-catalysed efficient protocol for the synthesis of \u03b2-amino carbonyl compounds 10 (Scheme 4\n). It is believed that the HBr generated in situ from the BDMS and water activates the electrophilicity of the imine and also helps in the formation of the enol of aromatic ketones.",

This protocol is successful for both aryl and alkyl imines and aldehydes, and the tosylimine could be replaced with a (2-thiophene)sulfonyl imine without any unexpected results. Mechanistically, the first step is a Mannich-type reaction, where the imine acts as an electrophile and the diketene as a nucleophile to provide the Mannich product 28. Imines derived from tosyl amides were chosen, due to their stability towards Lewis acids and, subsequently, the tosyl group would increase the electrophilicity of the imine and stabilise the Mannich product 28 with respect to a retro-Mannich reaction. Next, the formation of an iminium intermediate 29, followed by \u2018Mannich-like\u2019 attack of the enol form of the \u03b2-keto ester, leads to the formation of the piperidin-4-one.",

Generally, these reactions suffer from some limitations, such as poor electrophilicity of the azomethine carbon of imines, formation of the competitive by-products through reduction, enolisation, or coupling reactions, etc. Over the years, significant advances have been made in the Barbier-type imine alkylations. Due to the resonance stabilisation of the allyl anion, nucleophilic addition of allyl organometallic reagents to imines is favourable and has been more explored. Fan et al.36 reported a three-component, one-pot benzylation and allylation of aromatic and aliphatic aldehydes and amines under Barbier-type conditions using zinc powder to yield 45 (Scheme 16\n). This protocol is very simple as further activation of the zinc powder and isolation of the unstable imine intermediates were not necessary.",

The mechanism of this reaction can be rationalised by two competing mechanistic models, involving either a concerted asynchronous [4+2]-like mechanism or a stepwise mechanism. Both aromatic aldimines and N-alkyl aldimines can be utilised as azadiene components. The formation of aldimines is, however, often complicated for aliphatic aldehydes, because they are easily hydrolysed and have a tendency to undergo aldol condensation and polymerisation under acidic conditions. Thus, employing N-alkyl aldimines in the Povarov reaction is challenging. Narasaka et al.49 reported an interesting Povarov-type reaction using Schiff bases derived from various butanals and vinyl sulfide in the presence of a stoichiometric amount (1 mol equiv) of BF3\u00b7OEt2 as Lewis acid. This reaction provides a mixture of the adducts 67a and 67b in 70\u201383% yield (Scheme 29\n).",

In this report, we have discussed various applications of imines in multicomponent reactions. Imines represent a challenging array of functionalities that can be employed to explore chemical space efficiently and identify small molecular probes for biology. We believe that we have painted an accurate picture of the advances made by imines in the field of MCR chemistry, and this review may be a convincing case for the need to develop new MCR processes involving the versatile reactivity of imines towards many other substrates to enlarge the scope of this field, allowing the facile and selective construction of highly functionalised small organic molecules of high synthetic and biological value.",
