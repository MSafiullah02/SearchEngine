The SARS outbreak in Toronto led to 10-day closure of 38% of a tertiary care university ICU beds primarily due to lack of staff because of illness or quarantine [19]. Hence, hospitals should always have plans to augment ICU bed capacity, which may include by transforming general wards into ICUs [20].",

In one report, 41% of hospitalized COVID-19 cases were acquired in hospital, including patients who were already hospitalized for other reasons and healthcare workers [15]. ICU personnel need to follow strict isolation precautions in the ICU to protect personnel, other patients and visitors. Current recommendations are to follow contact and droplet precautions and airborne precautions when performing aerosol-generating procedures [22]. With concerns that the virus remains viable in inanimate environments for a sustained period, special attention needs to be paid to environmental disinfection in the ICU [12, 22]. Intensive care physicians should be sure to keep informed of the evolving knowledge and liaise with their local public health authorities to inform local infection control strategies.",

Sick leaves increase during outbreaks as healthcare workers with respiratory symptoms are requested to stay home until results of testing become available and because of contact tracing of infected patients [12]. Caring for infected patients represents a substantial exposure risk for ICU staff because of high and prolonged exposure to critically ill patients who presumably have higher viral shedding. Severe infections and deaths have occurred among healthcare workers with MERS, SARS and now COVID-19, exerting significant psychosocial stress on the staff. During the SARS and MERS outbreaks, healthcare workers reported concerns for their own or their family\u2019s health and described painful experiences of fear, anxiety and even social prejudice and stigmatization [23].",

For COVID-19, the World Health Organization in collaboration with the Global Research Collaboration for Infectious Disease Preparedness (GLOPID-R) has organized the Global Research and Innovation Forum in February 11\u201312, 2020 to identify the urgent priorities for research in aspects related to the outbreak including clinical characterization, therapeutics and diagnostics, among other priorities. The REMAP-CAP (Randomized, Embedded, Multifactorial Adaptive Platform Trial for Community-Acquired Pneumonia) is designed as an adaptive pre-planned, pre-approved platform trial for ICU patients with severe community-acquired pneumonia. The trial is recruiting currently at 52 sites in 13 countries on 3 continents with a further 35\u201340 sites being activated (https://www.remapcap.org) [25]. The trial is multifactorial, meaning it can analyze the independent effect of multiple interventions and their interactions and utilizes frequent analyses using Bayesian statistics to report results as soon as there is sufficient statistical confidence regarding superiority, inferiority or equivalence of interventions that are being evaluated [25]. Urgent modifications are being made to the protocol of REMAP-CAP to make it suitable to evaluate the effect of a range of interventions that may be active against this COVID-19. If COVID-19 becomes widespread, there are plans to substantially increase the number of sites that can participate in REMAP-CAP.",
