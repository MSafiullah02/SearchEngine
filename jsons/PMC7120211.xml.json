Hopefully, ongoing clinical trial will help resolve this issue. However, corticosteroids should be considered in the treatment of patients with septic shock who have responded poorly to fluids and vasopressors (requiring >0.05\u20130.1 \u03bcg/kg/min of norepinephrine or equivalent) and patients with ARDS who show progressive disease after 48 h of supportive care. Adrenal testing is not required in these patients. Two recent meta-analyses support the use of low-dose (stress doses) corticosteroids in these patients with a very favorable risk/benefit profile.5,6 Additional ICU patients who meet the diagnostic criteria for CIRCI (as defined above) and who have hemodynamic instability or evidence of an excessive inflammatory response should also be treated with corticosteroids (liver failure, pancreatitis, etc.). Corticosteroids have also proven beneficial in patients with the HELLP syndrome (see 10.1007/978-1-4419-5923-2_54) and in preventing atrial fibrillation (and limiting SIRS) in patients undergoing cardiopulmonary bypass surgery.1\n",
