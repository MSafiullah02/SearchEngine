Other common causes of scour for calves of this age are coccidiosis and cryptosporidiosis, though neither is generally associated with such severe clinical signs, rapid deterioration or high mortality as in this herd (Bazeley 2003) . The incidence of Salmonellosis as a cause of disease in calves is probably higher than recognised, and in a UK survey of diarrhoeic calves, salmonellae were isolated in 12% of sick calves and in 24% of outbreaks (Jones, Watson and Wallis, 2004) .",

The common infectious causes of abortion and associated clinical signs are listed in Table 1 typhimurium are by far the most common. Most transmission of disease occurs directly from animal to animal, although it may also be transmitted via contaminated feed, pasture spread with contaminated animal waste or human sewage sludge, or contaminated water. S. Dublin is a cattle-specific organism, and is therefore less likely to be spread by birds or rodents, as other serotypes may, although there is fairly good evidence for local bird spread in SW Scotland. Infected cattle shed vast numbers of organisms in the faeces. Adult cattle often become carriers of S. Dublin, excreting the organism mainly at times of stress, for example after sale or around calving. S. Dublin is often harboured in the gall bladder and the disease is sometimes associated with liver fluke infestation.",

Careful personal hygiene. Although S. Dublin rarely infects humans, it can cause serious disease. 5. Treatment for liver fluke In this herd, cows were not kept fully isolated following abortion and a boot dip and other hygiene measures were not put in place immediately and may have allowed spread of disease from cows to calves. There were no further cases in calves once the infected animals were moved out and the house was thoroughly cleaned and disinfected using FAM 30 (an iodine-based chemical).",
