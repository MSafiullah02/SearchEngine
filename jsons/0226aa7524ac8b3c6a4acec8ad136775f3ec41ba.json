Temperature was 98.5\u00b0F, pulse 114 beats/minute, respiratory rate 18/minute and oxygen saturation 96% on room air. She was awake, alert and had clear lungs. Electrocardiogram showed normal sinus rhythm. Glucose was 143 mg/dL, sodium 136 mmol/L, potassium 4.0 mmol/L, creatinine 1.34 mg/dL (normal baseline) and normal Troponin.

            "text": "angiography of the head and neck showed groundglass attenuation in the left upper lobe. This triggered us to order chest CT which showed bilateral groundglass densities extending from the hilum to the left upper lobe and middle lobe (Figure 1A, 1B). We suspected Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and patient was immediately placed on isolation. Pulmonary and infectious disease were consulted, and broad-spectrum antibiotics were initiated. Novel COVID-19 polymerase chain reaction (PCR) was sent and came back positive. Coronaviruses are RNA viruses where genetic recombination can result in increased diversity leading to emergence as novel pathogens. Their viral spike (S) binds to host angiotensinconverting enzyme 2. Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is identified in disease COVID-19. It spreads via respiratory droplets between close contacts, defined as within 6 feet of the person and at least 15 minutes of time spent in proximity. The virus may remain infectious in aerosols for hours, and on surfaces up to days. Infection may be asymptomatic or may result in an acute respiratory disease with fever, shortness of breath and cough. Bilateral pneumonia, acute respiratory distress syndrome, or death can occur. 1 Some patients have experienced gastrointestinal symptoms such as diarrhea and nausea. Hypertension, heart disease, and chronic lung disease are risk factors for severe disease. 1 Median incubation period is 5.1 -5.2 days. Asymptomatic phases range from 2 to 14 days. 97.5% of patients develop symptoms within 11.5 days (CI, 8.2 to 15.6 days). SARS-CoV-2 specimen (nasopharyngeal, oropharyngeal swabs or bronchoalveolar lavage) is performed using a real time PCR. Leukopenia/lymphopenia is common and liver function abnormalities may present in severe cases. 1 Negative procalcitonin and groundglass densities in chest CT favors COVID-19. 1 Management includes prompt implementation of infection control and supportive management for respiratory disease and complications like septic shock or acute respiratory failure. 1 Role of non-invasive ventilation is limited and in fact harmful.",
