However, existing algorithms cannot predict pseudoknots structure efficiently. In this paper, we propose a novel simulated annealing algorithm to predict nucleic acid secondary structure with pseudoknots. Firstly, all possible maximum successive complementary base pairs would be identified and maintained. Secondary, the new neighboring state could be generated by choosing one of these successive base pairs randomly. Thirdly, the annealing schedule is selected to systematically decrease the temperature as the algorithm proceeds, the final solution is the structure with minimum free energy. Furthermore, the performance of our algorithm is evaluated by the instances from PseudoBase database, and compared with state-of-the-art algorithms. The comparison results show that our algorithm is more accurate and competitive with higher sensitivity and specificity indicators.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Abstract"}], "body_text": [{"text": "RNA is a long chain of nucleotides acid molecule which consists of A (Adenine), U (Uracil), G (Guanine) and C (Cytosine). The four-base arrangement allows RNA to have a variety of functions that can play a role in genetic coding, translation, regulation, and gene expression. The search for the secondary structure of RNA sequence has been widely used as the first step in understanding biological functions [1] . The RNA secondary structure folds itself by forming hydrogen bonds between G-C, A-U, and G-U. Therefore, the prediction of RNA secondary structure is returned to predict all hydrogen connections from the primary structure of the sequence. Many components can be identified in the secondary structure, such as stacked pairs or stacks, hairpin loop, multi-branched loop or Multi-loops, bulge loop, and internal loop.
