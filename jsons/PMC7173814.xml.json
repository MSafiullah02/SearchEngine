As more information became available on disease spectrum, and laboratory testing capacity was expanded, the case definitions were also changed. We searched PubMed for studies published in English from database inception up until April 4, 2020, reporting the effect of changing case definitions on the epidemic curve for COVID-19 using keywords including \u201cCOVID-19\u201d, \u201c2019-nCoV\u201d, \u201cnovel coronavirus-infected pneumonia\u201d, \u201cSARS-CoV-2\u201d, and \u201ccase definition\u201d.We examined 19 studies in detail and found three studies that were relevant to the change of case definition. One study estimated the incubation period in the early stage of the outbreak, which can be helpful for modifying the case definitions. Another modelling study allowed for the change of case definitions in Wuhan via additional parameters for the change in case detection probabilities. A study also noted that their analyses were based on earlier case definitions, and stated that the estimated effective reproductive number was an upper bound because later case definitions could capture more cases. We found no study directly estimating the effect of case definitions on epidemic curves except two studies that briefly summarised the changes of case definitions in the guidelines on the diagnosis and treatment of patients with COVID-19 in China.\nAdded value of this study\nWe collected publicly available information on epidemic curves in China, and summarised the changes in seven versions of case definitions. We found that changes in the case definitions of COVID-19 had a substantial effect on the proportion of infections that were detected as cases. We estimated that if changing case definitions were unaccounted for, the growth rate would be overestimated. We also estimated the total number of cases if a broader case definition had been applied at the early stage of the epidemic and if there had been sufficient laboratory capacity. With these assumptions, we estimated that approximately as many as 232 000 infections could have been confirmed as COVID-19 cases in China by Feb 20, 2020, around four times more than the 55 508 cases identified by that date.\nImplications of all the available evidence\nChanges of case definitions or laboratory testing capacity should be accounted for when analysing an epidemic curve. In China, broadening the case definitions over time allowed a greater proportion of infections to be detected as cases. Taking into account these changes, we estimated that there were at least 232 000 infections in the first epidemic wave of COVID-19 in mainland China. The true number of infections could still be higher than that currently estimated considering the possibility of under-detection of some infections, particularly those that were mild and asymptomatic, even under the broadest case definitions.\n",

We fitted an exponential growth model to the incidence of cases to quantify the effect of changing case definitions on the epidemic curve for laboratory-confirmed cases (appendix p 2). In the model, we assumed that each change in case definition increased the proportion of cases that would be detected among all infections. Also, we assumed the effect of changing case definition was the same for all regions in China. To account for the control measures, such as the lockdown in Wuhan and other cities in China on Jan 23, 2020, and the subsequent days,7 we allowed the growth rate to change on this date. Because the interventions acted to prevent infections but the epidemic curve was based on date of symptom onset in our analysis, the effect of the interventions would be expected to have a slightly delayed effect on the epidemic curve, which we accounted for by incorporating the incubation period distribution (appendix p 2). The incubation period was assumed to follow a log-normal distribution with a mean of 5\u00b72 days (SD 3\u00b79).8\n",

We allowed for backfill up to 10 days before each change in case definition by assuming that a change in case definition could have a partial effect on incidence before the change date t, accounting for the reporting delay, which was estimated from the onset time series and report time series (appendix p 2). We estimated the growth rate as one of the model parameters, and we estimated the doubling time using log(2) divided by the estimated growth rate. We fitted separate models for Wuhan, Hubei province excluding Wuhan, and the rest of mainland China excluding Hubei province, to account for the regional differences in growth rates, epidemic timing, and potential transmissibility. We estimated the basic reproductive number R\n0, corresponding to the mean number of secondary infections from one case at the start of the outbreak, using the formula: 1 divided by M(\u2212r),9 where r was the growth rate and M was the moment generating function of the generation time distribution. We assumed the generation time distribution followed the same gamma distribution as a previously estimated serial interval distribution with a mean of 7\u00b75 days (SD 3\u00b74).8 As a sensitivity analysis, we used another estimated serial interval distribution with the mean of 4\u00b77 days (SD 2\u00b79).10 In addition, we did a sensitivity analysis allowing backfill for up to 15 days before each change in case definitions.",

The first national guideline for diagnosis and treatment was issued on Jan 15, 2020, and required six specific criteria to be met for a patient to be a confirmed case of COVID-19 (figure 1\n, appendix p 6). Notably, patients needed to have an epidemiological link to Wuhan or a wet market in Wuhan and had to fulfil four clinical conditions indicative of viral pneumonia to be identified as suspected cases. They then had to have a respiratory specimen tested by full genome sequencing showing a close homology with SARS-CoV-2 for the final confirmation of COVID-19. In the following days and weeks, several revisions were made to the case definitions, allowing gradually greater sensitivity in the criteria required for case confirmation (figure 1).

The greatest change was in the fifth edition, which introduced a new category of cases (ie, clinically confirmed cases), specifically for Hubei province, which was the epicentre of the outbreak and had the largest number of cases identified in the country. Here, clinically confirmed cases were patients that met clinical criteria and had radiological evidence of pneumonia with or without a certain epidemiological link but did not need to have a virological confirmation of infection.

This category was removed within a week in the sixth edition of case definitions because laboratory testing was deemed sufficient to confirm all cases and the clinically confirmed category was unnecessary.16 However, confirmation of viral pneumonia with radiological evidence could be an important alternative for diagnosis and surveillance of COVID-19 in locations with limited laboratory testing capacity, and could also be a good option if or when a surge in COVID-19 consultations exceeds local laboratory capacity.

Changes in the availability and use of testing can also lead to a similar effect.

One example is to allow for the marginal effects of different types of interventions, such as lockdowns and other distancing interventions that were introduced at different times towards the end of January, 2020, in addition to accounting for the changes in case definitions. As a consequence, analyses of the effects of interventions in China should be evaluated with caution if they do not account for the changes in case definitions. Second, we only explored the effect of changing case definitions on the epidemic curve of all cases because there is no publicly available data for the epidemic curves by severity. There were changes in the classification of severe cases, and future studies are needed to explore their effect on estimates of fatality risk. Third, we were only able to collect data for the epidemic curve up to Feb 20, 2020.

Still, this would be an underestimate of the number of infections up to that point because it would not have captured some mild or asymptomatic cases. Serological studies will be useful to estimate the cumulative incidence of infections.",

Symbols and lines show daily numbers of reported and estimated cases, and colours indicate cases in line with the different versions of COVID-19 case definitions. The coloured shading areas reflect that changing case definitions were adjusted earlier to reflect the assumption that there was a backfill of symptomatic cases who had not yet presented for diagnosis up to 10 days before each change in case definition, and therefore the effect of changing case definition would appear to modify the proportion of infections captured as cases before the actual day of change.
